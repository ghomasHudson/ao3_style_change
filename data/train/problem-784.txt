"Please, hurry", Sherlock said before walking out the door. A couple of seconds later he came back, "thank you", he said before disappearing.
Mycroft to tell him where John lived, and his brother told him as he sported a smirk and a knowing look which Sherlock ignored. He had no time for that, he had to talk to John.
Sherlock nodded, not knowing what John quite meant, was it the place on his back that hit the foot of the bed? Were the scars? Was his heart? It didn’t matter, it all hurt, but it didn’t hurt as much as it used to.
Johnny Adams and the Nightcats started playing and they sounded good, really good. But Sherlock wasn't paying attention to them. His mind was focused on something else, and he hated that.
What the hell was wrong with him? He had to stop this. These thoughts weren’t doing him any good, he’d lose his concentration and he’d make a fool out of himself in front of Sherlock.
John felt a knot down his throat. He tried to swallow it down and smiled bitterly. "Leave it, Watson. Leave it." He told himself.
John looked a little desperate, he threw his hands on the air. "No! No! Don't start saying all this bullshit! For God's sake, I need to know, Harry, I want to know!"
“Lucky?”He pointed at his nose. “Seeing you again is the most painful thing that has happened to me in a long while. I might actually need surgery.”
Of course it was the Black Cadillac. The black Cadillac he had seen completely destroyed three months ago.
Sherlock leaned in and kissed John, in the lips, because now he got to. Their kiss rapidly turned from a lazy snog to a heated one, and Sherlock didn't want to back away, didn't want to break away, he wanted to keep kissing those lips forever.
Sherlock shrugged. “I see nothing but too many colors that look very similar, mixed together in horizontal stripes”.
"No." John said taking Sherlock's hands off him. "Just no, Sherlock. I can't." He was afraid this was his last chance with Sherlock. He thought the greaser would turn and walk towards the door and leave forever, away from John's life.
The old man smiled and John felt terrified. "No, Holmes, you are not allowed to work on your own, but don't worry, Watson doesn't have someone to work with, so you'll do it together."
Mycroft stared at Sherlock for a long time, with that hateful look with which he observed, Sherlock felt as if he was being stripped naked. "Do you think I'd enjoy being the center of attention in
Sherlock stood up in a rush. He went to the bathroom and closed himself. His mind was running, telling him how wrong this was and how all of this was his fault because John didn't know, he didn't know all the things they went through, but Sherlock did, Sherlock did and did nothing to stop him, even though he knew that there was no way out of this, that John could only get hurt again and if he ever chose to erase his mind again-
about him, as you say, you wouldn't have left things like that. You wouldn't have broken his heart, you wouldn't just find someone else just after a fight." She kept shaking her head. "No. That's not what people do. Not when they
“You’re up”, John said as he walked off the bathroom. “Good. I didn’t want to wake you up to say goodbye.”
He stared at them in horror, wondering if his hands had been capable of creating such a mess, it looked out of proportion and asymmetrical and the shadows were in the wrong places and they didn’t look at all like Sherlock’s lean and long and perfect hands.
Moriarty's gaze flickered between the car pulling away by the road and Moran's broken nose. He smirked, raising his eyebrow and keeping his posture perfectly still and cool, as if he wasn't surprised at all. "Don't worry Seb, I know exactly whose car is that." His smile widened. "Time to start the game, don't you think?"
"Ugh Mike, I don't know, I think it would probably be the best to do it by myself. The man must not be very smart."
Melissa's head snapped up. "Wh-what? You can't ask me to do that! That's violating the client's privacy!"
from the boy he used to be at the beginning of the year. "There's no chance for you to ruin it. Just pass it, that's all."
John seemed to have remembered something, because he stood up immediately. "Oh! Hold on a second, the tea! I'll be back in a minute."
John smiled, “alright. I’ll come back later, and see how you are and if you’ve eaten, so you better do.”
1. I'm sorry! But I love angst and a bit of angst is always necessary to make things more exciting, don't you think? ;)
He felt John’s fingers touching his chin and lifting his head up, next thing he found were John’s eyes fixed on him, shining with a light Sherlock couldn’t quite put a name to. “Hey, I’ll be back, and we’ll talk, okay? We have all the time in the world.”
Sherlock gave him a reassuring smile and a nod. "I'm fine. The accident was long time ago, I just... I miss driving my rocket, listening to rock n' roll, feeling invincible. But it's fine."
He really thought he would be done in Serbia. But he found the leaders in Belgium. And so, he gathered all the strength he could and forced himself to go.
John shook his head. What the hell was he doing in a newspaper alongside that maniac addict? Something was wrong. Something was very, very wrong. He had only seen that man twice in his life and now there were pictures of them together on the papers?
After a moment that seemed like an eternity, (and John would have wished it so), Sherlock stood up, shaking his head and pulling his serious, threatening face. He then cleared his throat. "Alright, we should better..."
Okay I know this took long, but I hope you enjoy this MONSTROUS chapter! (over 6k words!) thank you so much for your lovely comments, they are very very much appreciated <3
“-perhaps the killer didn’t know that she had the scar. Perhaps the murder is not related to Lacuna”, Melissa replied.
Six months ago I woke up one morning and thought I was just hungover, tried to ignore the throbbing in my head and wondered why I didn't remember what had happened the night before, but well, hungover could explain it. Except I didn't remember being hungover in the first place.
Whoever was responsible for these deaths didn’t act deliberately. These people knew the killer, they allowed them into their house, they trusted them in order to do so. They knew the killer somehow, but how was it possible that Michael Jones could know all these people? Even if he worked for Lacuna, he was just the messenger, he had nothing to do with the patients, unless he’d show up at the doctor’s office in the middle of the procedures and befriended them. But that was highly unlikely.
Sherlock shook his head. "No, Mycroft. You know exactly what I mean. You kept an eye on him. Tell. Me. What. Happened. To. Him."
"Stop talking and let's go." He said trying to keep the same smile that drew on his face a moment earlier.
Sherlock started typing while he talked to John and sometimes stopped to sing a song and John just looked and smiled. They had a lot of fun actually, and when they were halfway there, Mrs Hudson called them for dinner.
Sherlock stood still for a moment, speechless, feeling not only embarrassed but also at an absolute loss of words. “I- erm”
Sherlock needed a distraction, and he needed it immediately, before he’d lose his mind going over and over and over the same thing.
Sherlock swallowed. Fortunately, in his quick glance at the article, he could see the words "suicide" or "fall" weren't there. "-I... the killer died."
It was an old building in London's suburbs. It was boring. It was not the place he would ever imagine John Watson living in.
"Yes", John replied. He drew back, however and looked at Sherlock seriously. "As long as you don't push me into doing that again."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and forced himself to blink. He opened them and looked and looked and looked, unable to tear the look away from John's neck. Perhaps he was dreaming after all. God, he wished he did. No. He wasn't. He looked. He couldn't stop looking, and saw that horrible, barely visible, hidden-by-the-short-hair scar that Sherlock had seen three times before. In the three victims of murder.
Sherlock hadn’t known Sebastian personally. By the time he was captured he was wearing a suite which seemed as expensive as Moriarty’s Westwood. He looked like a completely normal man, his expression was stoic, he was definitely younger than Jim and, as far as Sherlock could deduce, had suffered an addiction to drugs before meeting Moriarty.
Sherlock nodded while opening the door. "Yes." He stopped there, John, his eyes narrowed, "NO!", he fixed immediately, turning to look at her. "No, no. Send them to", he turned to look at Lestrade, "New Scotland Yard."
But Sherlock was still calm and smiling and trying to sound as a good boy as possible. "Believe it or not, Mrs. Watson, that's not true. I am a brilliant student and I do wonderful in school. You can ask John."
Sherlock's phone chimed and his eyes snapped open. He was laying on the couch, thinking. Not even sure what he was thinking about. He remembered Mrs Hudson had dropped by a few hours ago to bring him tea and had asked him to talk to John. Sherlock, trying to keep his face as still and devoid of emotion told Mrs Hudson what had happened to John, hoping she wouldn't slip and say something she shouldn't the next time he saw him.
The rest of the week passed by. Sherlock didn't come back to school for the rest of the week and John wondered how on earth did his brother allow that? However, he got used to seeing Sherlock every time he came back home, sometimes it seemed like the greaser knew John's schedule and was waiting for him, to talk to him? Fix things perhaps? Certainly not. It was to ignore him and make John feel like shit. Which was working.
John smiled and turned to look at Sherlock, who winked at him. John tried to stop the whirlwind of thoughts drowning his mind after the wink and focused on listening to the teacher. "... You've certainly progressed on the final project with this first draft, so, there's a lot of work left but if you continue down this road, you'll do very, very well."
"Looking for someone, Johnny boy?" He felt a whisper in his ear and turned to look at who it was, when he saw Sherlock right behind him. How had he done that?
"Sir if you would just calm down... Oi! you're not allowed to go in there unless you have an appointment!"
“Surprisingly enough, I can”, Sherlock said just as quietly, feeling the brush of their arms. They stood in silence, staring at the water, looking at the patterns it made as a small boat passed over it.
"You looked as if you had died- you were unresponsive, you would have died had I not found you there!"
He always took Harry with him but asked her not to use the radio. This time he gave up insisting so Harry turned on the radio. "Buddy Holly!" She shouted happily as she turned up the volume.
Sherlock had to lean his weight on John once again when they got out of the cab. John opened the door with his key
“I like his paintings, not the meaning behind them. I like the way he uses proportion and perspective.”
John had absolutely no idea where to start. How was he supposed to talk about Sherlock Holmes? It had been so long... "Um... I met Sherlock on January 27th, 2010. I had gotten back from Afghanistan and was looking for a flat and a friend of mine introduced us. It was a little crazy actually, the next day I was already moving in and he was a bit of a madman and that was what captivated me the most about him: that he was different from everybody else I've ever met..."
"Look, I just want to forget everything about John Watson. In this place you do that, then attend my request and delete him from my mind!"
He closed his eyes. Why? Why had he done that? How could he have done that? That was the stupidest thing he could ever possibly do, how could he have failed to control his brain in such a spectacular way? He sighed.
"He is not a freak, Harry, he is just..." -he turned his face and looked at Sherlock, who was still turning his back to them, staring at the window without saying a word. What could he be so thoughtful about? He preferred not asking, he already knew the answer: the woman. "...different." -A smile drew in his face, he couldn't help it.
funny and they were all a bunch of idiots but still, he kept talking. "So, the old man paired me up with the nerd and I have to work with him now. And, as you can imagine, he is a pain in the ass." He sucked again.
He couldn't see the greaser boy quite well, his back was turned against him, but he was with a girl, Irene.
"Why do you care? Back off and let me live!" Sherlock said without looking at Jim, he just stared at the bricked wall of the back of the school, as he kept sucking up his cigarette.
The problem wasn’t the loss in itself, it was the prospect of what could have been. The illusions, the ideals, the what ifs. That was the problem.
Mycroft pointed the page to Sherlock. "About two weeks ago-" He looked up to meet his brother's eyes. "He visited a clinic."
Sherlock got out of the bathroom buttoning his shirt. He had been expecting John to be still asleep when he left but apparently that was asking for too much. "Yes?"
Soooo, that being said, I just can't really say goodbye to this John and to this Sherlock. I can't right now, and I hate myself for this, but as soon as that thought came to my mind, a thousand ideas came with it, and so, *drums*: a sequel of I Can't Help Falling In Love With You is on its way and I'm expecting to start updating it in the very near future.
than being awake. He sighed and looked up, and the hours passed and passed and passed. And he stood numb and half-asleep.
John chuckled. "Fine. Pity for you, your boyfriend loves studying so you'll have to get used to that."
Harry thought for a moment, while John kept his eyes fixed on her. "Some secrets have to stay secrets, John."
“There you go”, John said, handing him two pills and a glass of water. “Take them, I’ll make you something to eat and you’ll go to sleep.”
But this wasn't the same National Gallery he had visited with his mother all those years ago. So he kept walking, ignoring the raging nostalgia he felt building in his stomach.
John nodded and remained silent. Sherlock finished his cuppa in silence and stood up, fetched his violin and started playing, as he stared through the window.
If John felt somehow offended or demotivated by the comment he didn’t show it. He just squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder, stood up and offered his hand to pull up the greaser.
At the same time, Melissa entered to the room holding a tray and stooped suddenly, standing completely frozen. Sherlock stared at her. "You!" She cleared her throat. "It's true then, you're alive!"
He held the little card in his hands, considering. Harry had explained to him what it did, and honestly, it pretty much seemed like the best solution he could come up with.
John felt a sudden anger rising to his head, because of Jim, because of Sherlock, because of Harry as well. He remembered Sherlock's scar. And his sister, half-unconscious driving their car. The ambulance stopping by, the lights, the noise, the blood...
John's mouth fell open. Was this really happening? Was Sherlock Holmes about to tell him the whole truth? It couldn't be. No. This just probably meant that he was going to get back with Victor or something like that.
But John Watson was there. And he needed to see him. So he tried to come up with a plan to see him again.
They struggled even harder with her but she was starting to recover consciousness and at least was able to walk by herself, muttering words nor John nor Sherlock could manage to understand. Finally they left her at the bedroom shushing her and closed the door quietly, going downstairs and sitting at the kitchen table. "Come on, I'll make you some coffee, I like talking to you when you're sober."
John grabbed him by the elbow quickly, and pulled him back to where he was, and suddenly Sherlock was very, very close to him, and God, he missed that scent, those eyes, that face, those lips.
And John had a flashback to the first time they met and he thought the greaser had finally recovered his sanity and he was expecting the punch, but then all he felt was the eraser hitting on his face, and he was blind. Well, there was chalk all over his glasses, so he was disabled.
John stopped in front of a beautiful and big house, with an ancient architecture, in one of the richest sectors in the town. He looked at Sherlock, surprised.
Sherlock didn't say another word. He just took the cup and drank everything that was on it, trying to shake his thoughts away. Irene decided it was best  to break the tension.
"I'm going to kick that boy's ass!" She said, standing up again and John had to stand up too to catch her before she ran away.
"Yes?" He said, picking up the phone. It had been over a week since Greg visited and he honestly expected he would be needed for a case once again.
He hadn’t felt like this in ages. He hadn’t felt this spur of inspiration, this raw, deep need to simply draw and lose himself amidst the proportions, the muscles and the lights. It had even been longer since he felt like this without the assistance of drugs.
Fine, perhaps he’d created senseless illusions over the possibility of John falling in love with him, and how their lives would be and how many paintings they’d make and how they’d help and save each other and-
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow and pulled that annoying greaser face he knew how to do so well, which gave John an instant flashback of some weeks ago, when that face was all he knew about Sherlock. "Talk about what?"
And Sherlock's self-control slipped off him, and he couldn't help himself from opening his mouth, "John", he whispered, and it came out so broken that he wished John hadn't listened at all.
“There’s- I- I love the classes, I love them, but I want to learn more, I want you to teach me more things, I want to know everything.”
Sherlock turned it on immediately and turned the volume up, as soon as he got to the rock n' roll station, he sighed and closed his eyes. John turned to look at him and smiled.
John took a deep breath and told himself to calm down. "Okay, first of all, the detention wasn't technically my fault..."
Mrs Hudson looked at him with a frown and when he came back to himself, he realized they had arrived to the dining room and Mycroft was staring at him from the other end of the table, quirking an eyebrow.
John turned to look at Sherlock and widened his eyes, as if secretly asking him for help because Mike was going to kill him.
and a little p.s. Never, never, NEVER hesitate in giving me feedback about the story! What did you think? Did you like it? Did you hate it? Did you laugh? Did you cry? I love reading your comments and they help me improve my writing and make the story better, so comments are always, ALWAYS welcome. Chapter 25 will be up soon, I promise :3
"I'm not sure if I would call someone who worked with Moriarty, who almost left a hole in the wealth of England and who betrayed me a friend."
This kiss was somehow different to the ones they’d shared the night before. There was no heat behind it, no desperation, just a sense of affection that couldn’t be put into words (perhaps into colors? He’d have to ask John later if it was possible, he was the expert after all), they melted into the kiss.
Mycroft didn’t have to ask who John Watson was trying to erase. It was pretty obvious. He closed his eyes and begged to find the answer he was expecting for. “Is it done?”
“Okay, but do you have any artist who’s influenced you, somehow?”, John asked, smiling slightly at this impossible man.
So... things are getting better aren't they? :) anyway, just wanted to thank you all for your support down this road and tell you that I'm very sorry but updates will take a bit longer from now on, mostly because I've started classes at uni again and I barely have time to breathe. Love you all and hope to update soon! Please keep motivating me with your lovely comments! x
"...I brought you tea." Greg's voice interrupted them. Sherlock turned to look at him. Greg stopped at the door, his eyes flickering from one to the other, realizing he had just spoiled an intimate moment. Well, as intimate as it could be in a hospital while John still had no idea who Sherlock was.
"Look, just forget about what I say, let's shut up and shake erasers. I don't need your help, I don't need anything." He said taking some of the erasers from the bag and moving towards the windows to open them. He had lots of memories about
He did lots of ‘studies’ -he would call them studies instead of sketches or drawings, it sounded more professional that way- on Wednesday, thinking about different types of human shapes
John cracked in laughter as he stared at Sherlock who raised another annoyed, not-amused eyebrow at him. “Seriously.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned towards the stairs, John was about to follow him but thought it was a little bit rude to Mrs Hudson, so he stood there, smiling. Plus, he was a bit curious.
"Not possible at the moment sir, I'll let you know when he's available. For now, is there anything you need? Anything you need assistance with?"
John had promised Mike he’d go to the gallery. When he received the message, he knew there was no turning back. Mike had photographed him in his studio four years ago, just before everything went to hell, and that portrait would be featuring in his collection.
He felt so much anger repressed inside him, ready to burst. "He cares about me? No he doesn't. He does not at all."
Sherlock laughed, “sometimes I wonder if I might regret teaching you this in the future”, he said, good-heartedly.
"I just...I miss you. I miss you like crazy. You ask me to choose what I want, the answer is simple, and it's the same one you gave me that day you apologized to me: I want
He should have deduced John had taken all his things with him, it was obvious, yet Sherlock hadn't seen it. He walked and stopped in the middle of the room, looking around the completely empty room and sighed. It used to feel like John's place, now it was almost unrecognisable.
Sherlock read the institutional manual of Lacuna once, when they’d first visited it (while investigating the case, not that one time Sherlock had been there because he wanted to get his mind erased). One of the first rules of the institution was to erase every single memory of their patient’s mind that might reminisce them about the existence of Lacuna or any of their workers.
At some point, Sherlock’s breathing ragged, when they stared at each other in silence, they were both breathing hard.
right there. Perhaps she had been driven there by that odd magnetism of a memory that was looking for a way out, just as John had been driven to him, perhaps that was why she had arrived there, and why the killer was waiting for her. Why? Something must have triggered her memory. “Whoever did it, they listened to the tape”, Sherlock said quietly.
"Oh, you sit here? Apologies, I thought you sat right next to the teacher's side, you know to be his...
"And you say you're the smart one..." -Sherlock glanced at him, he looked furious. Mycroft changed the subject to save himself from a fight- "...anyway, is there something you haven't told me Sherlock?"
it”, Sherlock replied, going to their desk and taking a brush. He held it in front of John. Soft. Expensive. Orange.
She looked down. "He had a very serious headache but didn't pay any attention to it. I asked him if he wanted to get a replacement but he refused, I asked him to eat but he didn't and in the end it was all too much so he collapsed."
John couldn't help but laugh as soon as he saw the place where Sherlock stopped: MBE Records. Lots of young people were going in and going out and Sherlock smiled widely. On one of the sides of the street, some teenagers were lining up, waiting to enter. "Do you see that? Oh yes, John. I'm home."
76 hours had passed by the time they had finished interrogating Jones and John still hadn't texted Sherlock, which was fine, perfectly fine, he needed time, that was it. He was
Mycroft stood silent and lifted his eyebrow at his brother, looking at him defiantly. Sherlock realized and widened his eyes, which were looking kind of lost, since the greaser was still very drunk. "Oh. Of course! You knew where I was!"
amidst them both. There was yellow and there was blue and yes, there was autumn orange and a twinge of green and is that Tiffany Blue or Cerulean or Verdigris? He couldn’t tell, he only knew that was the color of Sherlock’s eyes and there was some Army Force Blue there and lots of-
Sherlock dragged a deep breath. "If you don't tell me right now what happened with John Watson I can swear to you I will find a way to demonstrate the illegality of what you do, documents will be provided, an investigation will be opened, and with a blink of an eye everything you've worked for would have fallen apart and you'll end up in jail. Now tell me." He said completely calm, his face expressionless.
Sherlock released a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Alright, so I’ll see you later, at Baker Street.”
He hadn’t forgotten a word. Not a single one. He hadn’t forgotten the dictation the accent the tempo the enunciation. Because that speech had changed his life.
“I was walking in the park and I bumped into Mike Stamford. We were sort of mates when we were students. We got coffee and I mentioned that I wanted to move.”
Sherlock was struck with a deep, profound desire to draw, then and there. His hands itched, just like his lips had done before, but this wasn't about the impulse of taking drugs, no. This was about the impulse of merging himself with the graphite, of carefully drawing each line, each curve, of turning the white into color, into red, into orange. Into yellow.
Those movements of the muscles, the way his arms danced around the proportions of Sherlock’s hands, the way his stained hands reflected the light, seeing John in action helped Sherlock to understand the human body in a way he hadn’t before, because he hadn’t bothered to.
”, he said the last word with disdain, “so obviously it wouldn’t be a masterpiece. Now make good use of your materials and draw.”
He couldn’t explain it, couldn’t find any logical reason, any explanation as of how on earth that was true, but it was.
John turned to look at the paints that were lingering over the table. They had been there since he came back from Afghanistan, in a corner, as a constant reminder of all the things he had lost.
"We have to go to the police station. My friend asked me to pick up some evidence they have on there." Sherlock said turning to John.
He walked towards the kitchen, saw his old microscope, felt warned for a second because last time he had been there he had left a tongue on the freezer, he opened it but it was empty. His papers were still scattered all over the dining table, annotations about experiments, about cases... He peered over and found one of the notes John used to take about a case to write later on his blog. Sherlock raised an eyebrow and looked at it, feeling a bit nostalgic.
But there was something Sherlock Holmes couldn't decode, something he couldn't find an explanation to, as much as he tried. There wasn't enough data to understand that, how was it even possible he didn't have enough data about John after having lived with him for more than two years?
anybody. Friends and lovers…that was simply just an excuse, a way to place your self-loathing and turning it into someone else’s burden, and hide it with the ‘promise’ of love.
As they kissed, Sherlock opened John’s trousers and unzipped them. John gasped and Sherlock smiled into the kiss.
He didn’t know how he would react when he saw Sherlock again. But he knew it wouldn’t be good. It would be anything but good.
"Oh Johnny boy, you're so desperate it's pathetic." Jim said leaning close to his ear. "You're dying to be a greaser, aren't you?"
John, intuitive as he was, understood everything Sherlock wasn't saying. "You can go. I'll be fine."
It was interesting, he had always thought of himself as a logic-driven person who saw the causes and the consequences of almost every action and looked for possible outcomes while keeping his head cold.
"Your date, Sherlock, I heard that you were going out with a girl. I want to know it all!"-she was too drunk to realize all the things she was giving away.
They climbed upstairs, John struggling a bit to reach the stairs but Sherlock knew how uncomfortable he felt whenever people noticed his limp, so he remained quiet and climbed in rapidly, as if he hadn't realized John was limping at all.
John turned to look at him for a second. The greaser was laying on the chair in such a wonderful way, he could barely see him, but his silhouette looked incredible. "And what do you want me to do about that?"
John stood up as he grabbed the pillow and walked towards Sherlock's chair. He stopped in front of him and started hitting him with the pillow. Sherlock grabbed John by the wrists and pulled him towards him, their faces mere inches from one another. John stared deeply into his eyes.
John held the hope things would change a bit once they had History class. They did not. As he entered the classroom, Sherlock was already there and didn't pay attention to him at all. John thought he preferred when Sherlock bullied him, when he rolled his eyes at him, anything,
Sherlock took the sketch and entered to the car. The driver's seat. It had been so long. He touched the steering wheel slowly, feeling it, enjoying the moment. He turned on the car, and felt so excited, yet so terrified. What if it happened again? What if he caused any harm to Harry? What would he tell John? He shook the thought away and pulled off the accelerator. And the car started moving.
A moment later, an arm wrapped around him and he felt the energy and the warmth radiating from his back. And he leaned against that source of energy, that source of light.
I hope to update the next chapter very soon, I know you'll want to know what will happen! Lots of love to you, and thank you so much for everything :3
He had been suspended in time and space for a second. Nothing moved. Nothing happened. Anything. It was all empty. And yet it all existed there.
"I think I'd better should be off." John said with a serious expression, taking his bag and getting up the desk.
Greg sat on the chair again, trying to understand what the sleuth had just told him. He was pretty sure the 'he' Sherlock referred to was John, but how the hell was it possible John wouldn't recognise Sherlock? "John?" He asked thoughtlessly.
"Victor." Was all he managed to say, trying to bring some peace into his brain which felt like it was about to collapse, while keeping a stoic expression on his face.
"Jesus, Sherlock...yes", John said out of breath and Sherlock kept stroking, establishing a rhythm between them, he could tell John liked it.
"Because he doesn't seem to be fine at all! He looks miserable, Harry. And he won't talk to me anymore. That's why I'm asking
All three times had meant so much for John back then, but now Sherlock hated him and it meant nothing anymore and Sherlock could go to freaking hell except John didn't really want him to.
“I still wonder from time to time if it would have been better to never have come back at all”, he couldn’t help himself from saying. He felt a desperate need to let it all out, all of it, he didn’t care if John left, if John was disgusted by what he would say or if he would end up hating him for the rest of life. It didn’t matter. He needed to say it because it was tearing him apart, because it was haunting his brain and scratching his soul. He needed to say it because he needed to be heard.
angry. And no, no, no, he wasn't crying, he wasn't going to cry. He didn't want to cry. The tears started streaming down his face. He couldn't keep them anymore, he had kept them long enough. His shoulder was killing him, reminding him of how absolutely fucked up everything was now. He had all the rights to cry. So he sat with his back and his head leaned against the lockers while tears streamed down his face. He closed his eyes and let them fall.
"Look, I don't know what the hell happened between you and John, but whatever is going on now with you and Irene, it just...doesn't look real. How do you think he feels about it?"
Sherlock stopped walking and was surprised to see that John stopped walking as well and had turned to look at him. He closed his eyes, drew a sharp breath, and simply said what he felt. "The only thought that has kept me on after all of this was that I would be allowed to talk to you once again, John.That I would get to explain, that you'll get to know all the things you've deleted. Closure, isn't that what you need? Isn't that what I need?"
John thought Greg's worry was a very nice gesture and he considered telling him the truth. Well, not all of it, of course, but at least why Sherlock had skipped school and what he had been doing the night before. Apparently, Sherlock trusted him enough. But he stopped to consider it and decided it was better not getting in Sherlock's business, perhaps the greaser didn't want anybody to know he was working with the police and currently solving a murder. That only John knew it. Which made him special? He shook away the thought and replied to Greg, who was looking at him, expectantly. "No, I don't. I really have no reason to know, do I?"
The hand finally stopped over Sherlock's zipper, hesitantly. Sherlock broke the kiss to look at John. "Please", he asked.
“Sherlock Holmes? never heard of him”, he said turning to stare at the picture once again. He couldn’t explain why, but he felt drawn to it, as if there was some kind of magnetism in the artist’s face.
Sherlock Holmes looked…surprisingly better than he did in the portrait. John didn’t expect him to be that tall, or that elegant. He looked like a public-school boy rather than a real and proper artist. Well, that explained the ‘traditionalist’.
He felt his heart was breaking, because this, of all things, was what hurt him the most. He knew Sherlock had made a huge mistake and then the cherry on top was the fact he had said he
"Why?", John asked, his voice so thin and sounding so vulnerable that Sherlock just looked down because he couldn't face looking at him.
The greaser entered to the classroom two minutes before 9, looked at John and smiled, and John couldn't help but return it, and suddenly he forgot why it was that he was putting a stop to this, because whatever it was, it made him utterly happy. And apparently so to Sherlock.
Sherlock went to his bedroom and came back with a big jar filled with pencils of all kinds, John stared at it and whistled, “nice”, he said.
"...you know, after the OD." Sherlock said quickly, thinking he should probably stop forcing John's brain to remember.
Sherlock sat straight in his chair and turned to look completely at John. "See John? That's your problem, you always want to do what's right, for you breaking the rules is something impossible!"
his brain and finally find some pleasure and some calm amidst the pain and the loneliness. And so he took it again and again and he had it all under control until he didn't and he ended up in rehab.
They stared at each other for a long, silent while. God, it felt like it had been ages since they had last done that, that thing where the rest of the world ceased to exist and all there was left to the humankind was John Watson’s dark blue eyes fixed on Sherlock’s gray/blue/green ones. And that was enough to save humankind, somehow.
"Are you sure you're okay?" Sherlock asked John as soon as they arrived back to the school. John had been silent all the way back and Sherlock just kept looking at him worriedly.
"Of course, John. You may know lots of things about everything, but you certainly know nothing about music."
“Is that-?”, John asked as he stared fixedly at the painting Sherlock had finished recently. The one with their hands joined together.
John didn’t say anything but he couldn’t wrap his mind around it. He cleared his throat. “Fine, who’s your favorite painter, then?”
John looked at him as if he was one breath away from punching him, Sherlock barely managed to keep his stare without grimacing. He had never seen that in John's eyes. It looked like hate.
John smiled and his smile was so big it felt as if it could fill all the universes he had drawn inside of his iris.
While he did so, Sherlock leaned against the wall, trying not to expose his state. Lestrade stared at John.
But that was not how he was, he had come to learn throughout time that he was better off alone and that he actually didn’t
"Are you sure? You haven't even touched your food!" Mike said pointing towards John's lunch with his knife.
John smiled as soon as Sherlock opened the door. It was a soft, small smile that immediately irradiated into Sherlock, who couldn’t help but do the same. They stood there, still, smiling at each other, none of them knowing why, just doing it.
"I know I don't deserve much, but I don't care. I want to make you happy. I want you to stop suffering. I can read you like a book, and your eyes tell me you're feeling blue. I want to be responsible for every smile that draws in your face. I want you to be happy."
John looked at him very seriously. "Fine, then leave! But you will never find out who the murderer is or what he wants from you, and the next thing you know from him there will be a gun pointing at your brain and you know it Sherlock! You know the criminal we're dealing with!"
"No you didn't, you got it wrong!" John said with a tiny smile, suddenly forgetting all the tension that had been building between them.
It was surprising how suddenly Sherlock had managed to get rid of John’s demons, one by one, kicking them apart, showing him that it
He longed for something that made him feel alive again, like those years when he had just a couple of pennies in his pocket and a lot of illusions. Like those years when painting was his passion, not his duty.
The day seemed endless, patient after patient and John felt he couldn't take it. The hours passed and, finally, it was time to go home. He didn't take lunch. He hadn't eaten all day, the headache was too intense and every time he thought about food his stomach twisted wildly in return.
Sherlock grimaced without even intending to. Where had John taken that from? What was he doing at three in the morning asking him if they had been a couple? What was all of that? “What?”
"I'm just...I'm just..." And then the tears started falling, and John couldn't stop them, they rolled on and on down Sherlock's t-shirt, and he just had to let it all out.
Then Sherlock entered, looking cool, confident, relaxed and calm, which was the complete opposite from John. He had his hands in his pockets and smiled (fake smile, as John recognized immediately) at the teacher, who just looked at Sherlock and nodded.
As soon as they were free, John grabbed Sherlock's jacket by its lapels, refusing to let him go, holding onto it with his everything, as if his very own life depended on it. As his memories were hidden into the fabric of the suit jacket.
John walked towards him slowly. Sherlock could only blink, dazed by shock and surprise. He stopped in front of him and examined him carefully. He didn't reach out, he simply stared and stared and stared.
Mike looked around, “he must be here, somewhere. Oh! Hi Kate! Thank you for coming!, keep enjoying the gallery mate”, he said, walking to meet the woman he’d just greeted.
But a part of me knew, somehow, because I couldn't get away. I couldn't. I was hooked, from the very first moment, he was like a drug. Sherlock knew of course, he knew I had erased him and he tried to leave, to put his distance and walk away because he thought that was what I wanted, but truth was I thought I'd never really
Which was stupid, because they’d already found the person who’d killed her and even though everything suggested he might be the killer of all these other people they couldn’t prove it. There was no other way to look for evidence. How would they manage to show that Michael Jones was the killer?
After of what it seemed like an endless discussion, which included three weeks of punishment in which she won't be able to go to any party nor to anything fun, her mother left and Harry sat across from John, looking exhausted.
"Condoms?" They turned and looked at Sherlock, who was looking at them with a expression between a smile and a frown. "What for, exactly?"
John took the books to his locker and turned towards the bathroom. When he left, he found Sherlock on the usual bench, sitting and reading. He stopped and looked at him for a moment. He missed looking at Sherlock closed in his own world. He smiled a little and kept walking, aiming to turn the corner as fast as possible so he wouldn't notice him.
Sherlock loosened the grab of John's arm and looked at him , unable to say anything. John fixed his sweater and his glasses and continued along the hall, forcing himself not to look at Sherlock, who was still motionless in front of the lockers. His back was killing him. At least things were crystal clear now. Nothing was ever going to happen and he put a stop to Sherlock and it was all fine, except for his back and his head ache, but at least now everything was clarified. That was the way it was supposed to be, right? Then why did it hurt so much?
“I went and got you erased from my mind. I can tell it was a feeling as strong as that one if it pushed me to do it so.”
Sherlock snorted and turned to look at John seriously. “Don’t make peoples into heroes, John. They don’t exist and if they would, I wouldn’t be one of them.”
He suddenly started thinking about it. It was a very stupid idea, she was putting herself in risk, Mycroft kept an eye all over London, he knew every movement every person made, of course he would find out he was with her, but he had nothing to be afraid of, she was the one who was threatened to be killed anyway, and if she didn't seem to care, then he didn't either, so he put the thought apart and tried to think of something else, to pass the time and don't feel forced to start up a conversation with her.
He closed his eyes against the window. Perhaps he had said too much. It didn’t matter. His head hurt. So did his back.
He knew that if Mike were to photograph him now, he wouldn’t be able to bring warmth into the picture, he would only bring a sense of death, a sense of stillness and quietness. John would impersonate the war.
He had absolutely no idea, but he smiled. Sherlock Holmes. He was far much more than just a greaser, wasn't he? Mike was right after all.
“I meant that- drawing legs and arms is getting boring. I want more. I want a real challenge, Sherlock”, he said, turning to look at him, while Sherlock still stared out the window.
“I never understood the point of using these kind of paints on canvas”, Sherlock said as John grabbed the brush from him.
"Then let's go somewhere else." He said looking at John and smiling in such a nice way that John was almost
John nodded against his shoulder, and moved infinitesimally closer to him, careful not to hurt him nor to touch his wound. "Can I stay here tonight?", he asked softly.
"Well, next time you plan on dancing by yourself don't invite me to your house, then." John said, trying to sound serious, but being unable to hide his mockery tone.
He looked at the clock again and groaned, opened his closet, took out some pj's and put them on, getting under the blankets and looking up to the ceiling. He didn't want to sleep, not anymore, because for once, sleeping was actually
Next thing John felt was the pain on his lip and he sat up, loosening from Sherlock's embrace. "Ouch", John said, remembering all the things that had happened recently.
No. If he wanted to be like another artist -which he didn’t, but he had to set himself a goal-, he’d be like Salvador Dalí, with a masterful use of technique
Sherlock should have said no. It was the logical way to act, to lie. But somehow he couldn't bring himself up to do it. He couldn't lie to her. Why? He stood silent trying to think.
By the time the alarm chimed off, John groaned, rubbing his eyes. He didn't feel well-rested at all and he definitely didn't feel ready to help all of the patients. As soon as he stood up he took his hand to his head. The pain was so intense he felt as if it was going to explode.
Sherlock shook his head with the smallest bit of strength he had left. Victor leaned closer and closer, Sherlock could almost smell him, but there was something else to Victor's scent, there was the faint, slight smell of blood. And ground, and tires. And the sound of an ambulance approaching. "NO! NO!" Sherlock yelled. Or maybe he didn't, he couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. He didn't know what he was saying 'no' to.
John looked at him again and raised his eyebrow. "...Alright." He said after a moment. Then he frowned. "Are you okay? You seem a bit... uncomfortable."
"I knew you hadn't forgiven that one! What was I supposed to do?" Sherlock said annoyed, throwing his hands in the air.
If it's not perfect, it's not worth it. And you know what? I will never be perfect. I will never be good enough, capable enough, smart enough for them. They will always want more. They have all their hopes on me. And they think I'm perfectly fine with that, but maybe I'm not. And I'm definitely not." He said, taking a deep breath.
Jim sat up straight, his expression turning more serious. "You brought him to us, Sherlock. So why did
“There are plenty of cases going around London right now, little brother. I’m sure you’ll be entertained enough again.” Mycroft said passing an envelope to Sherlock.
That night turned out to be quite disturbing for John. After talking to the detective, he went straight to his flat, too exhausted to do anything else. He didn't eat, he just went to sleep.
Mike nodded with a smile. “Well, the gallery is doing an open call for young artists to show their work and get a place on the next exhibition.”
He bent down and kissed him urgently, their kisses turning frantic and urgent. Sherlock kept touching John's chest, his ribs, his stomach, stopping over his heart.
He felt dizzy and weak but his eyes were starting to gain focus and he could take in John’s worried expression and the way his hand trembled. He was on the phone.
He had moved apart just slightly, taken his distance so he wouldn’t look too eager, and preferred to look through the window, but the glass reflection allowed him to take notice of all of John’s soft and delicate movements that treated the paper so carefully, yet with a bit of roughness, as if wishing to leave permanent imprints.
The sound was spreading all through his brain. It was too much. The violin screeched inside his head, its only company being the constant, permanent tick tock of the clock.
If John ever needed a wake-up call then this was it. He realized of something that had always come to his mind but he tried to avoid constantly: he didn't have the slightest chance, not the smallest, not the tiniest glimpse of an opportunity of ever being with Sherlock Holmes. He had to get over it, to leave the hopes behind, to stop dreaming of things that were, well, improbable. No, more like impossible. Nothing was ever going to happen, ever.
are the only person who knows me as I am. Whatever else there is, with whoever else, it's just a façade. But with you, I don't need to pretend, I can just be myself." He said proudly.
"You fucking HAD to!", John yelled. "Well, look at that, it seems that I HAD to erase you from my mind!", John brought his hands to his head and closed his eyes, behind that last sentence there were sobs trying to escape from John's mouth involuntarily. "-How long ago?"
“Great!”, Melissa said, excitedly. “I- well, my shift is over in two hours so could I pass by there just after I’m done?”
Well, he hadn’t texted him back, but as they said goodbye with a frankly breathtaking kiss, John had clearly said that he would come back, or did he?
He remembered his eyes closing while his mind decided that it was too tired to keep thinking. After that, a string of dreams appeared, over and over, as he remembered everything that John didn't. Then he felt a couple of arms picking him up, but he couldn't tell whether it was dream or reality, everything was a blur.
Sarah replied this time. "Yes. My parents are out of town for the weekend and I thought it would be nice. A small party between all of us." She said, and her voice sounded quite confident.
John dragged a deep breath, grabbed the turpentine and the palette Sherlock had offered him and closed his eyes. He could do this, he could.
He didn't know how to make it better, how to fix it, and there was nothing to fix, as John had said.
Phew! Such a long chapter! Sorry for taking so long, but it was pretty difficult to write this little one, hope what you're about to read will be my redemption! :3 See you around for the last chapter and the epilogue! Thank you so much for your support lovelies! <3
"Hold on-", Mycroft said, leaving the phone silent for an excruciating moment. "Yes, the cab has just stopped."
In the picture, he wasn’t smiling, but he looked happy. His face was completely focused on what he was painting. That day he had chosen a palette of blues to mix them with green, and so Mike had chosen the same palette to print the photograph, so it looked mostly tinted with blue.
He threw the rock and no one answered. So he looked for a bigger one, still scared Mr. Watson would show up instead of John. The new rock hit the window strenuously and for a moment Sherlock thought the glass had broken but it didn't. A light turned on and a second later John was opening his window, with his eyes half-closed but as soon as he saw the greaser standing in front of his house, he rubbed them and looked surprised. "Sh- Sherlock, what are you doing here?"
Slowly, slowly, John opened his mouth, just a little bit. His tongue found Sherlock's finger a heartbeat later, and Sherlock's eyes drew closed immediately, as he basked into the absorbing sensation.
John returned the smile and was about to turn when he felt Sherlock's hand on his shoulder turning him back, and he stared into those beautiful, irresistible, blue/green/gray eyes (he still couldn't figure out which color they were, just that they were perfect).
He approached the locker and opened it wider, so Harry's face was exposed. She smiled shyly. "Oh Sherlock, I didn't hear you!"
The scar Sherlock walks over at the Tate Modern is "Shibboleth", an artwork by Colombian artist Doris Salcedo. The scar is still visible on the ground if you ever visit it ;)
John walked some blocks without knowing where he was going, he was thinking, he couldn't stop thinking. Leaving the apartment made things definitely better but he wasn't sure if he wasn't going to punch Sherlock's face the next time he saw it. He arrived to the place where his sub-conscious had taken him: Angelo's.
His eyes widened. John Watson. So this was John Watson? That explained the…anguish and the shapes of the drawings scattered around his studio.
Sherlock had walked into the Battersea Power Station once after the encounter between John and Irene. It had been during his exile.
And John looked up and they stared at each other. And time stopped, and again, it was just the two of them and the world could be falling apart and they wouldn't mind but John knew quite well this was the last time, this was the goodbye. Sherlock knew that as well, he just didn't dare to admit it.
"I'm staying at John's room tonight, so we were wondering if you had any problem with him staying at yours. You know, just for this night, are you okay with that?" -Harry looked at John, who just stared at her with a
"Sherlock?", Lestrade tried once again, his voice shifting from annoyed to worried. "Who, who has it?"
Sherlock rummaged for John's coat and took it off immediately. John gasped and pushed himself further towards the wall, Sherlock pressing his body against John's, desperate to find the warmth and comfort that only John could provide.
As his silhouette disappeared Sherlock loosened from Irene's embrace and let out a sigh, leaning against the lockers. He closed his eyes. This wasn't okay. He knew he was hurting John. And that was killing him.
John was about to answer, when the front door at Sherlock's house opened wide and a man came out. Sherlock looked at it and widened his eyes. "Damn it!" He yelled.
“He was lonely, had been lonely his whole life, except for his brother Theo. He knew he was doomed to failure -or so he thought- but he just…kept on painting. He loved it that much.”
The crime scene was intact, the woman still laying over the typewriter, while the police tried to collect as much evidence as possible. Sherlock stood in front of the body. "She will be taken to the morgue soon, but for now, I want you to take a look at her. Closely. Tell me what you see."
Mycroft looked at him, thinking on what to say next. Sherlock could see the anger pumping through his face, he didn't like what was about to come. "Sherlock Holmes! She died!" -he shouted.
He knew sentiment was the cause of all of his problems, it had already happened once, how did he fall again for that one? He hated himself, for being so weak, so silly, for placing his attention on such mundane things, for being so human.
"The thing is, this procedure is brain damage, and although there haven't been any major consequences, it might happen that the damage could extend and affect your whole brain. Are you sure you want to risk that? Your whole career?"
"I told them I had to pick some stuff at the locker and they left. I was worried about you. Are you sure you're okay? Do you want me to take you to the nurse or something?"
Sherlock frowned and left, throwing a killing look the the teacher. John stood there silent and angry.
John closed his eyes and sighed. Sherlock stared at him, he looked as if he had grown old all of the sudden. He didn't know what to do, how to fix this, how to make this less painful. John stood silent.
“Stop doing that to yourself.”Sherlock said in a moment of weakness. He wanted to help Victor, he really did. “You’re killing yourself slowly and painfully!”
, and now you're telling me that it's all fake and that she is back and ready to tear down the government? Are you aware of the accusation you are making and how serious it is?"
Finally, the bus arrived. Molly smiled at Sherlock and said sweetly. "Bye, Sherlock, it was a pleasure meeting you!"
"Oh, there's a work on couples... A project, a history project. And we're going to do it today, because it's due for Monday."
Perspective. Open or closed? Open, exposing the long palms, the delicacy of them. The fingers half closed, showing the creases of the articulations.
He opened the bag and gave the paper to Sherlock, feeling at complete and utter loss of what to do now. He sat in his chair and turned to look at the greaser, whose eyes were now fixed on the project as he read it all.
“Breakfast in bed, thought it’d be a nice way to wake you up”, John said, finally turning to look at him.
Sherlock cut him off, sounding annoyed, clearly not wanting to talk about it. "Of course she is but I honestly couldn't care less John, the only good thing about that message is that now I know who broke into my room. It was the phone, it was her phone! Case solved! Now if you excuse me I have better things to do than checking on who sends me texts".
"No. John", he walked towards John but John moved apart from him. Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. He sighed. "I- I came back and you didn't recognise me. You didn't know who I was, it was as if-"
John stood up, zipping himself up and going to the bathroom, grabbing a towel and returning to Sherlock’s bedroom. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, a small smile on his lips.
If Sherlock needed any confirmation that there was something incredibly odd and wrong about this whole situation, then that was it. Right now, sitting at Mycroft's office, he remembered the feeling he had when he finally wrapped his mind about what John had done: he felt lonelier than ever. Suddenly, the John Watson who used to talk to him and keep him right in his Mind Palace was gone as well. It was as if, by deleting the blog, John had taken a bit of his memory and a bit of his life as well.
"He gave you the first aids. Controlled the bleeding enough to save your life. He was all Doctor mode when we came in, yelling instructions at us. But as soon as he was taken into the ambulance he nearly collapsed with exertion. He held your hand the whole way to the hospital."
“I can’t say that didn’t hurt”, John said while he laughed. “But you’re right, it makes one feel better about oneself to see the lousy work of others. Remind me again, in which museum are your paintings located?”, he said with a smug smile.
John cleared his throat. "Sherlock?", he asked, silently begging that Sherlock wouldn't be as difficult as the day before.
He passed by his locker to get his books out of it, while everybody was moving across the hallway. He took them out with a sigh and closed the locker, he turned and tried to react but it was too late, Sebastian was approaching him and pushed him strongly towards the lockers and first thing John felt was his freaking shoulder hitting against the metal and the pain came as the greaser passed by. The books fell to the floor strenuously. "Watch your step, Nerd!" Sebastian said between laughs. Jim walked right behind him, having a laugh.
He was exhausted. He didn’t know which force kept him from tumbling into the floor with the next step. Except he did. And honestly, it had been the same force which had kept him right throughout all this time since the fall.
"You will get a good grade anyway, nerd." And he turned again to walk off, and John lost it. He was mad.
"Sherlock!", Lestrade said rubbing his eyes, "can you please explain to me what is going on? What's Lacuna?"
Sherlock saw the boy passing by and sighed loudly as the rest of the gang turned their faces to look at John. Jim looked at the greaser with a smile. "So...John Watson. Nice choice of someone to annoy!"
He walked from Mycroft's bunker towards NSY, it wasn't a very long walk. It was early in the morning, and Sherlock walked over the streets, looking around him, he couldn't deny London looked more magical than ever under the dim light of the sun rising. Not that there was much sun actually, it was a very cold day and he could tell by the sky it was going to be a very rainy one. Not unusual in this city, though.
That had been enough to bring him to life, twice. It had been enough to drive them apart, it had been enough to drive them together, it had been enough to draw John back towards him, it would be enough to help them face whatever that got in their way.
John looked around desperately. "Where is he? Where- where, I can't let him go, I need to hold onto his chest, stop the bleeding. Where is he?"
"Sorry love," John said grimacing as his split lip started to hurt from laughing, "it's just... Your hair is curly!" The boy pointed at one or two curls that were out of place. He loved Sherlock Holmes but he had to admit he looked very very funny right now.
*looks down* I'm so very sorry for taking so long with this chapter, things have been complicated, this one was a tricky one to write and my laptop broke so I've gone through everything, but here I am and I'm sorry. Thank you for all your support with this fic, you're the ones who have pushed me to keep doing this! :D Love you and hope to update soon, although I'd ask you to be a bit patient.
John still felt slightly embarrassed but ignored the greaser and walked towards the car. Sherlock got inside too and the first thing he did was turn the radio on. The greaser then turned to look at John. He said carefully and lowly. "She thinks you are not capable of doing it."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, John couldn’t stop staring at them, they were so incredibly beautiful that John felt the need right there and then to take an empty canvas and start mixing different shades of cyan and green until he’d get something even remotely similar to the color that was staring at him. “People change indeed”, was all Sherlock replied. He turned again and stared at John’s portrait.
She could definitely tell from John's expression in his face he was getting pissed off, very, very pissed off.
They were by their third glass of wine by the time Sherlock finished his story and he was feeling a little loose. John was staring at him, and Sherlock met his gaze, not taking his eyes off him. John's eyes had darkened, just as the man had gone quiet. He stared at him as if he was the most incredible thing he's ever seen. And Sherlock wondered for a second, how was it even possible, how could John think that of
? You are going to wake him up! And no! It wasn't his fault either, well not technically, he is having A DATE!"
“You need a rhythm”, he continued, “that rhythm is determined by what you saw in the mirror, how to draw broad shoulders, a straight back? You follow a rhythm, you set the rhythm, you set the longitude of your traces, you follow along those traces and you have the contour, it all follows a pattern”, he said as he traced the shoulders of his torso, “you also need texture, see?” He said, pointing at the left side of the picture, that had been darkened in order to create the illusion of the chiaroscuro, “the darkness and the light are capable of creating that texture, you believe there’s another dimension because the light effects make you think there is.”
I couldn't understand how or why, it was a composition of things happening simultaneously: touch, sights, ears, I wanted you. I did, I know that much, and I still do. I won't pressure you, I know you've handled enough, I still don't know what you want from me, I try, I try
“I think you must. Alacrity of mind is crucial to what’s ahead. Eat what you can, and rest, if you can’t sleep. I will have you roused at five, to discuss what’s to do. At six you will go to him.”
I was, of all men on earth, the least worthy of advising anyone on the subject of the marriage bed and deficiencies discovered therein. John knew this. I knew this. I sat immobile, terrified, but strangely warmed, that he should trust me so, absolutely inadequate as I was to the question. He took my silence well, considering; glanced at me repeatedly, and rubbed his hands together, and sighed again; but his shoulders had loosened, and he sat straighter in his chair.
The week that went by after was a continual revelation; nothing was different, and yet I felt new. I wished with all my heart that someone, anyone could know how I loved him. That I was his. And yet I supposed that all England knew it, really. They knew he was the best and brightest thing in the world to me. They had read everything I’d written for him. It was only convention that kept them from understanding it.
But as I began to find my courage, he was losing his. He was coming to me less, and quiet when he came. I thought it must be grief over Mary. He would have spoken to her; he had sounded quite determined to do it. I couldn’t imagine what she’d have said, what she could do. He didn’t speak of it, and I didn’t ask. I knew he and Mary would have to piece it out between them. But at last there came a night when he told me quite suddenly, in the very act of putting on his hat to go, that he believed they would separate. He was pale, but calm. He smiled at me, even, before he left; and I managed to keep from pulling him bodily back into the room and keeping him there with me, to defend him against the sorrow I saw in his eyes.
As to the idea that you can do nothing for me when you are gone: You are with me still. You are always with me. I write you out of my head onto the paper, because you are always in my head. I fill my pipe and think about you. I hear a boy singing in the street and think about you.
I sat up in my bed, and flung back the covers; went back out to into the darkened sitting room, the starlight coming faintly through the front window, and the scent of roses from the bowlful on the mantle. I needed something—anything to calm myself. I had no expectation of reaching him; what did I have that was remotely adequate to his loss? I began by looking for the syringe which was tucked up somewhere in my desk, but some vestige of sense stopped me, and I took up the Strad instead and began to play—softly, but after some time it drew him out of his room at last to stand barefoot on the bearskin rug before the fire, pale and quiet, watching me through swollen eyes.
I reached Berne on the second morning as the dawn broke exultant over the distant peaks. The city was spread out below me, sprawling and mortal. It took me some minutes approaching with my eye on it to be certain it was real—I had been alone with my thoughts too long already. In town at last, speaking only French and keeping my voice low, I bought a cheese for my breakfast; ate it sitting on a sunny bench outside the telegraph office while I waited for it to open. I had been traveling by night, and sleeping by day, a precaution against discovery. It was good to sit in the daylight amid humanity again. When the proprietor arrived at quarter to nine, yawning, I accosted him eagerly—perhaps rudely—asserting my need to send a message at once. I had been thinking about John, waking somewhere between the mountains and England (if he had slept at all), still unknowing where I was.
“No. None of us were. Mycroft had just gained a position in the Ministry, and I had set up shop here, and was studying in the Museum at all hours.”
“Family’s family,” she conceded, but doubtfully. John Watson clearly came before Mycroft in both our minds.
After two months he began to rally. Mary had gone to stay with her mother. Returning, she asked him to tea. I watched him off, feeling a good deal of trepidation on his behalf. But he returned brighter-faced, carrying some of the books he’d left at their home, and said to me warmly, “She is a brave woman.”
In the shadows beside his bed, he stripped swiftly, and crept beneath the covers without a glance. I followed suit, helping myself to one of his immense nightshirts. In the silence I blew out the candle, and laid myself down beside him, carefully; laid my hand on his bare chest, to feel his beating heart beneath my palm. My soul felt bruised.
The bright morning following, when I’d gotten myself downstairs at last, and in some semblance of my normal order, or disorder, he came to the table with his cheque-book in his hand. He laid it down in front of me.
with the under-ostler. The boy was just nineteen. Sherrinford would not apologize; he professed to care for his partner in indiscretion. At that, Mycroft stood up on his behalf. My father was beside himself. When Sherrinford was sent off, Mycroft went with him. They were never asked home again, but to my knowledge they were not cut out of the estate--that would have created a scandal. And Father let Mycroft write to me. When I came here after school to try my luck, my brothers were waiting to receive me.” He gave a rueful smile.
“I had been very angry with them both, Mycroft for leaving us, Sherrinford for involving himself with a boy without position or protection. The servant could have been beggared had my father not decided to keep it all quiet, for our reputation’s sake. I found it hard to look Sherrinford in the face. Through his fault I had lost both my brothers and any sense of security. By that time I knew--I understood what Sherrinford had seen in the boy. I could see it too.” He broke off again and swallowed. I had not discovered my own nature until years later. I tried and failed to imagine having kept such a secret, in growing fear, at fifteen.
“And so do I,” I said. But the truth is that I will be at home wherever he is, for better or for worse, as long as we live.
“Wear a muffler!” I shouted after him, as he departed. In his excitement he looked likely to forget even his coat and overshoes. Holmes laughed behind his paper.
"My brother has directed the police, and his own men, into position, following the information I have given him. The organisation is compromised, the evidence in hand. He is finished—he cannot escape. But he knows what we are doing. He is growing desperate. He came to see me this morning." I described to John the events of the morning, and the dangers of the day, culminating in the plans my brother had helped me to lay as I sat with him over dinner, coming slowly back to myself from the fugue induced by a deep and dreamless sleep. He was right: I had needed the rest badly.
“You spoke to them?” I pushed myself up on my elbow, the better to see him. He blinked, and hesitated, searching for words; met my eyes again.
I flung myself down into my own chair and stared. I was used to his reticence and the dignity that demanded it, but this was new—to be denied even a glimpse at what worried him, for fear of my taking offense. “As I wish to be your friend,” I said, trying for a calm and reasonable tone, “that isn’t possible. Whatever's troubling you, I want to help.”
His eyes were solemn. “I’ve written it,” he said, and I struggled to think what he could mean. “The letter,” he added, when I didn’t speak. “To my brother. Refusing the invitation. Perhaps--you could read it over for me? Tell me if it’s reasonable.”
I did think his behaviour strange sometimes. Even after we’d settled in, and taken the measure of one another’s worst habits, and seen one another in our stocking-feet, he seemed embarrassed to ask me what I did for work—a delicacy of manners, on his part, past my understanding. Nor would he admit that he had nothing extra to spend beyond his share of the rent. I didn’t guess he was actually penniless till he’d refused my fourth proposal of an evening out in favor of another of Mrs. Hudson's plentiful but quite unremarkable suppers. And how he ate those suppers! As though he’d never had such food before, and might never again. He grew agitated when I refused to come to the table, or came only to pick at my plateful, and sip at the coffee, and satisfy myself with bread and butter.
I walked him to bed, and held him there. He slept in my arms. I lay a long time watching the shades of night pass through the room.
The little silver circle inlaid with ebony slid on perfectly; settled onto his finger as though it belonged there. “Of course,” he said, staring at it, “of course you know my size, God, you didn’t ask Harry for my ring size, did you? She couldn’t have kept this a secret.”
I remembered his care for my pride at the start, how he’d asked me no questions, and asked him none of mine. Only, “I hope you don’t plan to work for this one,” I ventured. “I won’t be earned. You’ll have to take me on faith.”
He held a revolver in his hand. His stance was military, his attitude intent. He could not have seen me, or he would have brought the rifle to bear upon my future at once; therefore he had heard Moriarty scream, and was now trying, through the spray of the fall, to see whether there was any survivor of our meeting, or whether I was gone. Was this only a stranger hired by the Professor for a guide or a precaution? Or was he a member of the organisation whom I had overlooked? I could not recognize him through the mist and the distance, but I supposed if I had known his face, he would be in irons, and not standing there.
My brave, my beautiful John looked at me without the slightest shame, or any hint of darkness beyond a little wry twist to his mouth, which said he knew exactly what he was about, and would do it anyway. I looked back. I could dare no less, not in the face of that uncowable joy. I said, again, slower, "John," and then I summoned up all my courage and held out my hands. He came to me.
Moriarty found us. John has written about it, since; but he has made it all different from what it was. We had set out together from the hostel to see the Reichenbach cataract, arm in arm, but he'd began to lag as the path up toward the falls grew steeper. When a messenger came, begging for John to return to the last night's quarters and help a dying lodger, I was glad for his sake that he should turn back; he needed a little rest. I was glad for the patient, too, to have so steady a hand to steer them toward Death's farther shore. I am not the infallible creature of my John’s fairy tales. I did not expect danger just then. I did not meant to get him out of the way; he would have wanted that least of anything. He would have wished to be there when Moriarty found me. "Good-bye," he called to me, as he started down the trail; "don't start any trouble without me."
Mycroft, as I have said, is difficult to read, but his brows rose at that, and he set the cup aside. “Has he? He’s cutting your invitation rather close. And you want to know--?”
At the end I rose. "I have to go. You are more at risk every minute I stay here. Mycroft and I will tidy up my end of the affair this evening before bed. I needn't be present in England for the arrests; and I have enough funds to take us anywhere—I've come into enough, through the last few months' work, to make us comfortable forever. We can do anything we like. I'll meet you in the train—I'll take you to France. I'll show you everything."
“John,” I said, but words deserted me, and he turned his face up to the ceiling and laughed aloud. His hand crept about my arm and squeezed it. The heat of it went right through me.
“No,” he breathed, “no.” Still he wouldn’t look at me. “But if you could have seen your face--you were shocked when I mentioned the wedding. You were.”
“Ridiculous man,” he said, very quietly, and held out his hands to me. I met him there on the hearth-rug; lifted the book and began.
Clearly I was missing something else essential, now. I watched him for a minute in silence, wishing I dared ask the hundred questions occurring to me, but he seemed nearly overcome with warring emotions, turning about the room, biting at the stem of the pipe, unable to be still; until all at once he stopped, with a glance at me to be sure I was all right. I nodded, and his expression cleared a little. He set aside his pipe, and took up the Stradivarius; tuned it, and smoothed the rosin across the bow, once, twice, and began to play--heartbreaking music, unearthly, dangerous, deeply sad; a whole range of communication words could not have reached, and I closed my eyes and tried to understand it.
This is Holmes and Watson's story, but it's also Sherrinford's. The struggle to find your balance after a world-shattering event, like losing home, a parent and a first love at one blow, is a long and hard one; and thinking well of yourself, and choosing your own safety and happiness, is an act of great bravery. It can take time to find the courage. To anyone who relates to Sherrinford's side of the story: I honor you. If you've already found your own life or if you're still reeling, I believe in you.
“You look like you’re about to die of nerves,” she said, dropping her voice to a half-whisper, “and you’re fidgeting about in your coat pocket. Besides, you’ve been besotted forever and so has he. Isn’t it obvious?”
"Come to dinner with me," I said. I confess I wasn't asking; I was sure of him. I was already anticipating the pleasure, turning about for my hat.
“God, no. I never wanted to.” If I had been a woman, would I have been forced to watch romantic movies? Would I have wanted to? “What is it about them?”
“Not at all. Just like any crowd--unthinking; boisterous and a little crass. But some of them were interesting; and some were kind to me.”
“Holmes,” he said, and through the exhaustion in his voice alertness sounded suddenly, “what’s wrong?”
The dawn woke us—to Belgium and freedom. Two days till Moriarty was in court, and we had nothing to do but stay together, out of the way of harm. I suppose we knew each other as well as two Englishmen generally can, by that point; yet I found all at once had no idea how to behave. He loved me. He had said so. Now what was I to do with him?
I had to hide myself. I crawled my way across the damp earth to the face of the cliff, out of his line of sight; and then I clambered up a little way, with trembling legs and an ache in my fingers that did not bode well for me, till I found a ledge I could rest on, and wait, and think.
The only light in the room came from the lamp on the table; the only window stood beside it. We could be reached quickest that way. His expression grew more concerned as he watched me sidle round the edge of the room, keeping close to the wall, and fling the shutters closed, and bolt them. I bolted the door, too, on my return.
“Hm?” He looked up at me, smiling, dark-eyed in the low light, and my heart dropped down to my toes, because how was I ever going to find words? But maybe–maybe I should just try for the impossible, anyway. I tugged on his hand again, pulled him up off the stool and said, “Come outside.”
I had not meant to feel for Mary. I had hoped (when I thought of her at all) to be distantly courteous regarding her, and never see her. I did not want to grieve for her. There was nothing I desired less than to comprehend precisely what she wanted from John Watson. I had long accepted that love made a fool of most, and a goblin of me. I wanted unforgivable things, things that would ruin me, things that would repulse him. But his tender, wistful tone when he’d talked of what she felt—he honoured the sentiment; and just then I could not remember why I was required to despise it in myself.
“It’s well written, of course,” I said at last. I was feeling my way. “But if it were a stranger’s letter, I’d say it was coolly phrased. I don’t mean to suggest it ought to be different. I assume he expects no more.”
It had been a long time since he had ordered me anything, and I sank into his decisive air, and reveled in it, as he pulled off my gloves without waiting for permission, and shook his head over the split and bleeding skin.
In the cab, I seized his restless hand between both my own, and brought it to my lips. He looked startled; then a little of the fear left his eyes, and he drew my hands to his own lips in turn, with a sigh.
In the eyes of Moriarty’s company, whatever was left of it, I had died. So long as I stayed dead, we were safe. I could walk through the night. There was a telegraph office in Berne, from which I might wire John and Mycroft, and a bank in Turin with a gold exchange, and captain in Florence who would ship me anywhere at mention of my brother’s name.
“I am not,” I protested immediately. “I couldn’t be, you are—you are—” But I found myself at a loss for words again. He softened immediately, though, and sat back in his chair again; took up a cigarette, and lit it, giving me time to collect myself. The silence between us was sympathetic, now. I was too lightheaded from the sudden exposure to feel much relief; but still—I had said it. And he had stayed.
As it happened, John was perfectly capable of making clear to me what we were to do; and though he looked a little shy at first, within hours of our establishment in a quiet room overlooking the Senne, he turned to me quite suddenly from the little chest of drawers wherein he had been laying our clothes and said, “You don’t have to be afraid of me, you know.”
“Say lover. Yes, but I find I am content to be rejected. If you can’t be satisfied with less than utter absorption in me—”
“All right.” He was growing serious; he could see something was happening. He caught hold of my hand; followed me through the crowd. My heart was beating hard. I got him out into the street, in the December night. It was dark and cold, but the crowds made me feel less conspicuous; alone with him in the middle of a London street’s magnificent indifference, the cabs rushing past, the headlights shining off the wet pavement, and the neon signs blinking above us.
I made a full circuit back to Paris in the end; established myself in the headquarters of the Gendarmerie, and spent a glorious twenty-four hours in which neither time nor human limitations seemed to touch us, while we raced our marks to the finish. And then it was over. I had done what I came for. Five days later, in a lodging house in Calais, I had the last of the evidence in hand which would put Moriarty in the dock. I believe I sat half-an-hour with Mycroft’s letter before I rose all at once to pack my bag. But I know nothing clearly from the time I first read his message until the moment I stood outside the gate, giving my landlady every coin I had left in my pockets, in gratitude for her forbearance, and her kindness, and her existence generally.
“What on earth do you mean?” Whatever I might have guessed, it wasn’t that. I couldn’t imagine a more satisfactory husband existed in England than John Watson.
“Watson, were you out? All night? Without me?” I hadn’t meant to say that last, but he didn’t seem to think it unusual; only pinched up his lips and answered nothing. “But—why?”
"Sit down," he said, pulling me on toward the fire. Obedient, I sat down on the settee. He remained standing before me.
“I think,” she said, “you ought to lie down just a bit. You’ve been traveling a long while, you know.”
I woke in bed from a dreamless sleep to his weight settling behind me, his arm sliding about my waist, his breath on the back of my neck.
He was out on a house call. His absence gave me time to think. It was not a comfortable exercise. I lay in the depths of my arm-chair, picking a hole in my dressing-gown. I had lost John once already, not by choice. I knew what it would be like to watch him leave. Would it be better or worse for me, having sent him off myself? Could I find the fortitude to pull apart the Professor’s operation on my own? But of course I would—I must. John would not be safe so long as Moriarty kept a hand on the workings of London; not so long as John kept up any association with me. I did not delude myself into thinking I would have the strength, or the cruelty, to sever our friendship altogether, even to protect him. So: defeat was inadmissible. I must win.
“Yes. A long time ago. It ended very poorly and my mother never forgave me. Please don’t ask me about it.”
John has written of the blackmailer Milverton, and the drama surrounding his death, but he has not mentioned that his was the first case he accompanied me on, after seven months at Baker Street. Of course he was magnificent. I had told him all about my plan to break Milverton’s private safe, and take back my client’s information, without any thought that John would try to come, but he insisted. In fact, he quite sincerely proposed to turn me in to Scotland Yard if I wouldn’t accept his company. I was so pleased by that, in spite of myself, that I was in danger of becoming cocky as we made our furtive way through the sleeping house, quite outside the law. To have him home was joy; to have him again at my side, glorious in his courage, trusting, and radiantly absorbed in our task, was joy unspeakable.
I can’t imagine what I looked like then, faced with him sitting there quite calmly in the midst of the unspeakable. I might have said anything; but what I burst out with was, “And that pleases you?”
“I mean more than that. I mean what I said. If it was with you, I’d be proud,” I repeated, breathless. It seemed essential that he grasp that. After a moment, his hand covered his mouth. His eyes began to flicker through indecisive shades of deep feeling, and settled at last on a kind of gleaming recklessness.
“I love you,” he said. “I have for years; I know that now. And,” growing gruff, “if I must go I should like to kiss you first.”
I found him by the window in his dressing gown, wild, remote and beautiful in the morning light, swaying, and playing his heart into the air.
I am safe, and have had no trouble. I’d like to give someone trouble. It rankles me that there is nothing I can do for you.
He only looked at me, for a moment. Then, “Never,” he said, very low, “never again, never so long away from me—you mustn’t, I can't.”
“Mycroft was different. He made efforts to develop himself. He was isolated, and controlled, and careful, and steady, and I thought I saw a way I could live. I determined to be like him; to be rational; to remain alone, and grow wise. I thought that was as much peace as I could hope for.”
He clicked his tongue at me, and shook his head in a disconcerting imitation of regret. “You are clever enough—you must see there can be but one outcome to this. You have to withdraw. After all you have done to us, it is the only way. It has been an intellectual treat to watch you at work, and I say, genuinely, that I would grieve to take any extreme measure against you.”
“No.” He always asks this, now, when he comes back, whether his mental absence has been hours or days. Sometimes I don’t think he knows how long he has been gone. “I’ve been fine, here. Working. Thinking, a bit. Reading the new Journal.”
The antique ring Holmes gives Watson actually exists, as described, except that there are two hearts entertwined between the hands.
Having watched the moon set as I boarded the train in Dover, I found myself in London, on Baker Street, at eight o’clock in the bright, crowded morning—just the time Mrs. Hudson would be setting out breakfast. I was strangely moved by every little thing around me—the shouts of the tin-mongers and the newspaper boys, the baker’s children playing kick-the-can in the gutter, the maids sweeping up the front steps, calling out gossip to each other, the elms just bursting into joyous leaf overhead. I thought of John, his hand tucked into my elbow as we came up that street through every change of light and shade and season, the two of us always in one mind. I thought of home.
“It’s all right.” I knew what happened to soldiers who fell into indigence after the war. If I had not found a sympathetic flat-mate, I might have gone the same way. Sherlock had helped me; talked to me, and played for me when I could not sleep, and taken me to the Baths when my wounds ached so that I could barely walk. He’d asked me to observe him, and allowed me to write what I saw, which began my independence from my anaemic pension; and finally, when I was well enough, he begged my assistance in every adventure. It was everything I needed.
“Holmes,” I said, my eyes on the beautiful line of his back in the low light. I rose. He did not turn.
“There were one or two who’d come near, and I admitted it, but, ‘Holmes is the only one now,’ I told him, and he smiled a little, as though he’d anticipated that. Well, he’s been reading the Strand, so perhaps he had. ‘I trust him with my life,’ I said, ‘and I think he feels the same.’”
"No, but—Listen, Holmes, this is what we've been wanting. You know who I am; I am not changed. Whatever you wished for while you were gone, it's yours."
“Cards.” Blunt misery in his voice—I heard it, and suddenly I saw the facts fitting themselves together.
Or I find someone who has an interest in us, John and I, as a crime-solving team (never in us as actual people; we don’t want to engage that sort of fan–things get far too personal). And I tell them stories. John likes those conversations even better. He likes to watch me remember the things we've done. Occasionally, I find someone I actually like talking to (usually the odd guest out, hanging around the back wall). That’s best, but I have to be sure not to leave John out entirely–turn to him occasionally and ask his opinion, or touch his elbow; some part of him is still afraid (somehow!) that I will find someone more fascinating than him.
“Good Lord, must you speak so?” This sort of talk was unprecedented from him, and surprisingly painful. “It isn’t really a molly-house, is it?”
“John’s coat?” I said, to Greg, who squinted at me; pulled it off John’s abandoned seat and handed it over.
“Yours, sir.” Billy looked as though he were loath to leave us without knowing the import of the letter, but Holmes took it behind the map and did not emerge.
“Now, yes, but—all this—” (he gestured to the room, and me with it)— “it isn’t mine by rights, is it? It’s luck, that’s all. I was wounded the same as the rest who died in the mountains. I shouldn’t have made it out. And when I did, I should never have found you; I had no connections here, nothing to fall back on. I’ve gone hungry before—I know how to do that, at least. I should be living in privation like every other soldier past his strength.” I opened my mouth to protest that, but he shook his head at me. “Since by some chance, instead, I interested you, and found a living here, and recovered as I have—still any chance could take it all away. Why not test my luck now, and see what’s coming to me?”
“No—that is to say—no. My feelings toward her are the same as ever, only—I’m afraid they may not have been enough. Not from the start.” His voice was sinking lower, his hands pressed hard together. My own began to tremble slightly. “I thought—I believed it would all be quite natural, once we began.”
I had registered a step on the stair, but I was too deep in my thoughts to question the weight of it. When my door opened, I looked up expecting Mrs. Hudson with her basket, in pursuit of the laundry. Instead, I was met with a face and a form I had only seen in newspaper reports, and one photograph, folded and scarred, sent over to Nantes by my brother’s hand. Familiar, then, to me, the sunken, cold, curious stare, the stooped and hardened form, the balding, fine-featured head. Familiar, but new in their full effect, met in person. I am afraid I started when I saw him in the doorway. Then I reached into the table-drawer, and slipped the revolver I kept there into my pocket.
He drew a breath. “John. My John.” Suddenly he let go my hand, caught me about the waist and spun me round in a dance step for which I was not at all prepared. Then he kissed me soundly; and then he let me go, and went for pen and paper; and I sat down to collect myself. I will never, in a hundred years, comprehend the whole of him: he is endless wonder.
“Again, if I must say it,” very sharply, “I always want you.” It was very nearly the same tone he had used to say, “Because I love you,” for the first time; angrily, with his face turned away. I had pressed him to say why he would not kiss me. I was nearly certain I had not misread his wishes. I hadn’t realized he, the all-observant, all-knowing, could so badly misread mine. I had not known he needed to be told I loved him too.
“Suppose we stop trying to bear it,” he murmured. His eyes were welling with tears. He swept a shy thumb over them, and gave me such a wry, glorious look I felt myself blush. “Suppose we just be mortal for a moment. Let me at least hold you. Please,” opening his arms to me, and I lost all vestige of sense. I went to him. I laid my head on the broad, thick shoulder of his dressing-gown; turned my face into his tender neck, where his pulse raced, and placed my lips to it, slowly. He shuddered; said my name, hoarse and deep and tender. Past speech, I drew him closer; put my arms about him, felt the heat and the strength of him beneath me. Took him in, like a drowning man taking air.
I had known that, or guessed it, but it was a comfort to be told, all the same. A question occurred. “Will Mycroft go?”
“I don’t understand it at all myself, Holmes. I had thought it would all be quite natural, and yet—and yet—I ought to have noticed that I was not all right. I might have known.”
The letter sent, he went to his room. After some little time, during which I tidied my desk and hoped devoutly that this would not end in disaster, there entered an elegant, but nervous-looking gentleman with a stooped posture, black gloves, a neat little beard, and a high silk hat. Under the shadow of its brim familiar eyes shone with emotion. He bent over my chair and gave me a kiss, made strange by the false whiskers’ bristly intrusion, but all he said was, “Let me find you in my bed when I come home.”
“He says Sherrinford has been reformed for some time,” he said, without turning. “Since before he met Cox. Mycroft thinks the change may be permanent, as Cox has pledged the wagon too.”
I was put to some trouble behaving sensibly on the day we’d chosen. We had agreed to wait until everyone else was abed; a practical measure, to make us safe from everyday interruptions, or (God forbid) the sudden interference of an actual case; but the hours stretched on before us. I suppose I was fidgeting, because Sherlock at last sprung up from the sofa, where I thought he’d fallen asleep, and said, “This won’t do at all. Come on!”
He said, “But surely I’ve caused you pain. To be accused of—by association—You called those feelings madness.”
Mrs. Hudson stopped us in the entry. “This came,” she said, holding up another letter. He took the envelope from her and disappeared up the stairs without a backward look.
Beside me, he said into the quiet, “Still, he was my blood. I wanted to know him; so I ate with him in Mycroft’s rooms, or my own poor digs, a dozen times that year. Every time, he arrived drunk. He couldn’t hold a conversation. He would ask us both for money, and seemed offended when we refused him. Halfway through the evening he would suggest we go with him to a tavern, or that I, specifically, accompany him to the Park to find some soldiers for our--use. He knew about me, you see. I don’t know how, but we brothers are all gifted with some measure of that observational capacity which Mycroft has worked into a diplomatic weapon, and I have crafted into a science. It was difficult--to see him like that; to realize he expected no more for me in future than his dissipated, lonely state. It disturbed me. I knew the tendency to self-abuse was in my blood too, thanks to our father.”
I wired Mycroft first, and then sent on three messages for John; one to the hostel in the mountains, hoping he had not yet left it; one to the hotel in Brussels where we had stayed together; and one to his rooms in London. I prayed Heaven he would not need the last. I shrank from the thought of him recrossing the Channel alone and afraid for me. Each said, SUDDEN ATTACK OF FEVER NECESSITATED SCOTT’S IMMEDIATE REMOVAL STOP APPLY TO HIS BROTHER FOR NEWS STOP I AM SORRY STOP.
Still, I questioned my judgment in leaving him there—questioned it, semi-involuntarily, about twice an hour from my arrival in France, alone, until the morning I was served a cup of poisoned tea at a tea-house on the Boulevard. I had been about to take a sip when the faintly bitter scent of the cupful struck my senses like a warning note. I knew that scent. I could not place it for a long moment, and then it came to me: cyanide. A mouthful of that tea would have killed me in moments.
“But as you are evidently under close attendance by multiple undesirables, I think his visit ought to wait for darkness, for both your sakes. You must spend the afternoon here. Ah, tea,” as a knock sounded on the door, and with a raised voice, “Come in, Will.”
Two mornings after he’d sold his first story about me, he emerged with a different shape to his weariness. He had a dirty smudge on his face, as though he’d rubbed his brow with an inky hand, and the stiff set of his shoulders suggested he’d sat up for hours rather than tossing about in bed. Clearly, he’d been working over another story, an occupational improvement over the nightmares. “You shouldn’t write so late,” I offered anyway, hoping (I admit) to impress him with my acuity. “Not while you’re still recovering your facility for sleep.”
According to the timeline I'm using, Milverton was in January and the Fall in April, which means the months Holmes spent in Europe must have started just after Milverton's case ended. That would mean John was lying when he said he and Holmes had drifted apart, and hadn't seen each other for a long time, in The Final Problem--in fact they seem to have been living together during Milverton's case--and what would prompt that lie? Why wouldn't John have been working with Holmes in the months prior, except for during the Milverton case? Why is he suddenly living separately from Holmes in The Final Problem? I tried to answer those questions from a Watsonian perspective here--the Watsons' separation, John's depression, and the threat of blackmail seem reason enough.
“Naturally, you wouldn’t find a simple game like mine interesting,” he said at last. “But I know you like to chance your luck, sometimes. You’ll hazard your whole case on a guess if the answer matters enough.”
“Yes, of course. Obviously.” I even tried a laugh, but it came out high-pitched and faint and I gave up and flipped the box open after two tries, curse my clumsy fingers, so he could see the ring and not doubt himself or me a minute more. “Would you–do you–want it? Should I ask you–”
The bitterness infused in the word was unmistakable. “Happily for him, my parents are no longer in the world to voice their objections, and Mycroft and I will have nothing to add except our well-wishes. I suppose you’ll have to sign the letter of congratulations. Perhaps you could advise me on a gift, as well. Oh, for Heaven’s sake,” for I was staring openly. “Stop looking at me like that! I’m well aware we are not the most respectable of families, but you hardly have the right to be so shocked. I am not the one who corrupted
I find it difficult to put into words the sensations I experienced at this statement. I hardly knew where I was. For one, here was another brother, again, entirely unknown to me! After all this time! And a brother getting married. My experience of the Holmeses, regardless of the unforeseen and wonderful intimacy of my current situation with Sherlock, was all against the idea of them involving themselves in such a public, conventional, domestic contract as legal matrimony. A Holmes to wed--and we two strange bachelors asked to come together! Setting aside the fact that this Sherrinford knew of my existence, despite my ignorance of his--did he know what we were?
And then, emerging out of a long day’s mostly-fruitless work, I looked about to see him curled up in my armchair in the day's last light. He was reading, beautifully intent. I wanted more of him.
"I believe that brings us to the present. We stand under imminent threat to our lives, outside British jurisdiction, with nothing to do but await danger. As we have done many times before. As I have longed to do again, as many times as you’ll have me. So, Holmes, I'd like to propose what you will not. Let us return to where we left off. You have just called me by my name, and in such a tone that I really must leave the room, or else—"
We have discovered him. Colonel Sebastian Moran is the man; your brother will have sent on his photograph, to get your confirmation as to his height and build, but we are quite sure of it. Now all we have to do is wait for him to be a little, a very little uncautious; enough to give us reason to set the Yard on him, and get a warrant to his house. Then we’ll have him. You are nearly there, my boy—nearly home. You will not have to do without me an hour longer than Moran's good behaviour holds.
I had loved before. It was a word I would have owned at the time it happened, but I had not thought to use it since, after my mother’s horror at it, and the finality of my father’s silence. For years after I would have called what I had felt for Victor a kind of perverse greed, at the kindest, and yet I hadn’t even felt frightened when it began; only amazed, that he should like me so. When the holidays came I had asked him home to meet my parents—introduced him as a friend. They were very pleased. They hadn’t imagined Cambridge would have the effect they had never achieved in all my boyhood, of making me sociable. I didn’t mention that we’d met over an injury done to me by his dog; nor that he’d courted me with the offer of the dog’s company, as well as his own, while I was invalided on my couch, and couldn’t run away. I had preferred the canine’s society at first; only for a little while.
He studied me. His mouth softened in sympathy. “Yes, of course. You’ve been having a hard time of it, haven’t you.”
There is a stoat’s burrow in the riverbank, out beyond the university. He has made himself quite a small hole, close to the waterline. Periodically he emerges, slips into the river and busies himself therein with stoaty past-times. He does not seem to mind me. I am very quiet; I sit still atop a log, with my hat in my hands, and breathe softly. The gnats and dragonflies hover over the water, but do not bother me. I have gone there daily since I discovered the place. I often do a little rambling early in the morning while the town is still abed.
He had risen to get his kit, and he paused, then, in the midst of pulling out ointment and tape, to beam at me unexpectedly.
“I presume they are feeling pressured,” was Mycroft’s dry response, as he settled back in his chair. “And therefore they are pressuring you. Tea,” he added, to the boy who had shown me in, and who was still hovering round the door, “and a cold collation, and you will tell Phebe to light a fire in the second bedroom. No,” as I opened my mouth to object, “I don’t doubt you have lost your appetite, Sherlock, between the exhaustion and the shock, but you evidently haven’t slept two hours in the last twenty-four. A little food and a rest are absolutely essential at this stage if you are to make it to Monday. A steady pace, dear brother, not a headlong dash, even as the finish line hoves into sight.”
“After dinner, he was in his room with the door open.  The last time I saw him I was doing rounds of the hall, and poked my head in to find him using his laptop.  His roommate Tim was next door with the other two from their line, reviewing old game footage.  The door between their rooms was open, too.  Tim says Jeff apparently got bad news in an email, threw his coat on, and ran outside.  Tim thought maybe Jeff was off to make a private phone call in the parking lot or something and would be right back, but Jeff never came back to sleep or to get his things.  Nobody back at school or among his family has seen or heard from him in the last day, since we left to come here.  And that’s all we know,” Overton concluded.
There were times when he licked his lips incessantly. They were dry and sore, the skin slowly peeling off it. Sherlock wanted to stitch it back because John had been there, John had whispered and smiled and moaned and stared at those lips and it felt as if the skin was still alive with John's memory, as if it was slowly falling apart, and taking all of John's traces from it.
The next morning, Sherlock arrived to the living room, John was sitting in his chair, reading the newspaper. As soon as he saw Sherlock he stood up. "Sherlock...hi...good morning". He was wearing a warm sweater with winter colors and Sherlock suddenly remembered: it was Christmas Eve, and he hadn't gotten anything to John, he had been very distracted these past few days, but he had also forgotten another important thing: John was talking to him. He felt a slight relief as soon as he remembered. He could still hear the anger in John's voice from last night's fight. They'd been fighting a lot recently.
Sherlock snorted and turned to look at him. "Do you seriously think that if I had gotten arrested I would be leaving the police car and entering to the crime scene? You and stupidity don't match, John, so don't ask silly questions."
"No. Checking on patients at ER." He looked down at his trembling hand, and clenched his fist to hide it. He looked up again. "So what about the cases? Anything new?"
Sherlock bit his lip and leaned closer, stopping just above John's earlobe, his lips barely touching it as he whispered, "I want you, inside me. I need you."
"We're not allowed to", Mycroft said firmly. "He needs to rest and recover. No visitors allowed in, lest of all patients."
He stood right by his car, pacing from one side to the other. He didn't know why, but there was this sudden impulse within him, this sudden
John kept his eyes closed and pressed his forehead against Sherlock's chest. He didn't produce a single sound. The whole room was silent except for their panting and the fire that was burning in front of them.
Sherlock saw John storming into his room and he did the same, he was so angry, John didn't have to do that! How could he call his brother? What a stupid thing he had done!.
People vanished but John stood there, his back against the lockers, rubbing his shoulder and bending to pick up the books. He was
He rubbed his eyes. It was too difficult, all of this was too difficult. Caring was too difficult, but loving, loving was a whole other story.
"This awkward silence, you staring at each other, shutting up when I arrived, for God's sake Harry, what did you do?"
But almost as fast as John turned to look down, the night turned into sunlight, well not much of a sunlight because it was raining, and there were lots of people around him and he looked at them all and couldn't understand why they looked so worried, why they were looking at what was below him...
"I'm not going anywhere, I'm still stuck in detention." John said trying to ignore Sherlock's hands holding his arm so tenderly, so lovingly.
that history! The man saluted seriously, looking at the half-full classroom. "I'll give some time for the rest of the people to arrive but I'll start by telling you that in this class you are punctual or you are gone. It starts at 9. Not one minute later. If you arrive later, please abstain from entering. Clear?" They nodded.
"I know Jim wouldn't mind-" She said leaning close to Sherlock and whisper to his ear. "-if I were with you. We're nothing after all."
He knew the old Sherlock would hold him and tell him everything was going to be fine and he was smart and strong enough and incredible because that was what the old Sherlock did. But that one didn't exist anymore. The new Sherlock was now probably making out with Irene before starting the day of class.
He turned to find a John who stared at him with amusement. He looked… different somehow. It was too difficult for Sherlock to explain why he looked different, but he really did.
"I don't know John, I'd be lying if I told you that I hadn't considered it before, but it just seems so... Fake. I saw him take his own life! Why would he come back? Why now? Why me?"
Sherlock relaxed a bit and, while looking serious, his voice tone was not as threatening as it had been. "I'll wait."
"But- but this John could be all that and more, Sherlock. He believes in you. And somewhere, deep inside, he knows you better than anyone else."
"Great. See you in detention. Now go to class." Hikes said with authority and started walking back towards the building. Sherlock followed him with a sigh. How many more things today could possibly go wrong?.
Lestrade looked down again, not sure if he wanted to ask that question or not. "So, you're alive..." He hesitated.
Sherlock realized he might have said too much, so he cleared his throat and tried to fix it. "...make sure he's fine."
Lestrade was holding a giantic cup of coffee which was indication of the detective's current mood. As Sherlock walked in, he rubbed his forehead.
“They kept talking to me, telling me that- that I’d do the world a favor by dying and I believed it”, he replied with a soft laugh that meant anything but fun.
“Oh, I only chose the ones from the last three years. All the victims were within that group, so I imagined that Michael had been lazy and just chosen to kill the ones in that group. Perhaps because it was more probable that they’d be at the same working place or were living at the same address than the ones who had checked in twenty years ago.”
Sherlock had saved him. Back when they first met. John had felt lost and somehow found another purpose in his life thanks to Sherlock. He couldn’t explain it, but he felt it.
When he stood up from the chair, he felt the edges of his vision getting darker and his legs getting weaker. Numbly and quivering, he made it to Sarah's desk, and he fell down, feeling his mind shutting down and collapsing to the ground, losing the bit of strength he had left.
He saw Sherlock stiffen immediately. His back went rigid and the man wouldn’t turn to look at him. He didn’t say anything.
Sherlock was human. Probably a drug addict? Probably sad and lonely? Who knew? John certainly didn’t.
He took his pencil, opened the pad, closed his eyes and imagined Sherlock’s hands. And allowed his hand to move, just like Sherlock’s had done twenty four hours before.
John smiled, how could he ever forget about that exhibition? It had been there that he met Sherlock and was captivated by his intelligence. He had known immediately that there simply was no turning back. Sherlock was the kind of person that
"Because your mother and father will never let you put your feet inside a driver's seat again, Sherlock. And if you had some respect, you shouldn't let yourself either."
"Not so much, so far. Dimmock asked for anything in the record about the couple. The woman was a writer and his husband was a businessman. Apparently they moved from a big city, because they lost most of their money when the stocks went down. She reported she had gotten threats about five months ago, but then she didn't mention them again. The police investigated them, but this happens all the time so it wasn't taken into account. The rare thing about it is, if she was the one who got the death threat, why did her husband take the worst of it?"
Greg entered to the flat, which was completely different from the one John used to share with Sherlock. He looked around and realized the living room was almost empty. It looked a bit gray and boring, no wallpapers on the walls, nor skulls or big stacks of files on the floor. This place didn't look like John Watson's home. This place didn't look like a home at all.
In all honesty, he didn’t even know what to expect, nor how to expect it, but he couldn’t help feeling slightly- disappointed at their lack of communication. It made him wonder. What if-?
He was already climbing up the stairs, he stopped in front of the door with excitement, as if he was a twelve-year-old boy doing something forbidden and opened it.
"You know? I found out something about you." John said with a sarcastic laugh that sounded more hurt than funny.
Sherlock widened his eyes and ran towards the stairs with a surprised expression on his face. He came back a moment later, checking on the police's evidence and smiling. John looked at him with a frown, looking confused. "See?"
“Please, John”, Sherlock scoffed, “the pupil would hardly be a black hole, it isn’t absorbing everything around. It simply is there. Like a planet. Like Pluto.”
"I just need you to keep me undercover from your brother. Don't let him look at your texts, if he asks, tell him you know nothing about me, and please, please, don't let John talk to him. He wouldn't doubt for a second if it was about killing me."
John didn't say a word. He allowed Sherlock to do this, had asked Sherlock to do it. He bit his lip and closed his eyes. As he moved his hand up and down, setting the pace, Sherlock could feel the small sobs still coming from John's body, combined with pleasure and pain and sadness and need and he just wanted to make everything better, to kiss away all the wrongs he had done so far when it came to John.
That was what he was thinking about until he saw that greaser passing by. Predictably, he took his lunch tray and sat right next to Jim, Sebastian and Greg, who were laughing like idiots. John always hated them, but never paid any attention to them, that until this Holmes arrived, now he despised both the boy and the group. He stood looking at them, thinking about how angry he was.
He was supposed to be angry at him, after what had happened in the record store, but in the moment he saw him getting down the police patrol, the surprise and the shock after the bullets was bigger than his anger.
"What?" John said shaking his head. "Sherlock, my neighbors have died and all you care about is that they serve for a purpose? Do you even care they died?"
"Oh John, I have so many things to teach you." Sherlock said looking at John with a smile. But John was more than confused. He kept frowning.
John had crossed the street when Sherlock opened the door, he crossed it without even stopping to check if there were cars around, that wasn't his priority at the moment.
John nodded, but otherwise remained silent, staring into distance. Sherlock examined him, his breathing was a bit slower than usual, which was probably because his body's temperature was going down.  He grimaced a bit whenever he moved or when a cold breeze passed by, which meant he still had the headache, but other than that, he looked healthier. "Your head is still hurting."
He ran towards Sherlock, the pain in his shoulder (psychosomatic, he knew) completely forgotten out of his instinct to heal and to take care of those who had been hurt.
"Yes, yes." John felt some bitterness remembering the events that had taken place at the beginning of summer. He let out a small smile and they made their way to the door.
John really had no idea what he was angry about until he saw Sherlock sitting in the same little chair at the turn of the corner as always. Damn it. He felt a rush of heat in his head and realized the root of all his problems (as had been usual so far this year) was, once again, the greaser.
"Alright then, I'll call the patients. What's his name?" She said, grabbing the application that was in her desk.
Sherlock stood hesitantly over the ‘send’ button, wondering if it was too bold to ask John to come with him when it wasn’t really certain that John
Harry's eyes widened and her jaw dropped, then she chuckled. "The new boy? Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes? You can't be possibly saying that that bird chose you!"
While he slept, he kept jumping from one dream to the other, not quite sure what he was dreaming of, only knowing the sleuth was there. Within the dreams John wondered what the hell was going on, he was aware of Sherlock's presence on them, but what was that man doing there?
He was about to fall asleep, feeling he had used all the energy he had left on his body, when he heard John's voice whisper. "I'm sorry."
He only came up with one question, "why are you doing this?", John asked terrified, his voice low and soft.
It was 7:00 and they had already finished. John read the paper and sighed, relieved. "Good, I like it."
Sherlock hesitated for a second but then looked at her and without changing his expressionless face. "Fine. I'll help you."
Sherlock shook his head. "Of fighting against this. It has always been like this for both of us, and I'm
John laughed but then his expression turned a little more serious. "Let me take you home, it's the least I can do, after all you did..." He pleaded.
He frowned at it, and saw that it was a call from Lestrade. He hoped with all his will it would be a case that could put his mind to work.
"How? How can you possibly not know? John! It's me, Sherlock! Sherlock Holmes!" Sherlock said almost desperately, leaning closer to John, invading his personal space and pointing at himself with anxious hands.
John sat by the desk and noticed that there were no works in progress in Sherlock’s room. It was empty now. Had he finished them all? Or had he grown frustrated and thrown them away? He really hoped for the former. “What happened to-”
The greaser opened his mouth in disbelief and then closed it, trying to wrap his mind around the voice produced behind him. He didn’t dare to turn, he couldn’t turn, he wouldn’t turn, he wouldn’t look, he would just close his eyes and stay there, waiting. He thought he had seen the last of him.
As soon as she saw him, she stood up and waved a hand at him. Sherlock rushed towards her and didn't greet, he merely said: "What happened?"
The Fall had ruined a lot of things, but the thing that Sherlock despised the most from the aftermath of that moment, was forcing John Watson to forget about that day, a few years ago, when he walked into a room and he saved Sherlock's life.
“Do you believe me?”, was all Sherlock was capable of saying. What if John didn’t? What if he thought all of this had been just another game to get him to forgive him? No. He would never have done such thing, he would  prefer losing John rather than tricking him again. Not again. Never again. No more lies.
“I always pictured it different”, was all John said. He didn’t look angry, not at all, actually he was smiling, not the angry smile he had mastered, but a melancholic smile, a smile that longed to remember and was doomed to regret.
him? No. No. Definitely not. He didn't love John. Love was too big of a word. He smiled again and looked at Irene and they started talking, maybe this would wake him up from his stupidity. Love. What a joke.
John's expression changed and turned more serious than it was before. "Please don't tell me this is a drug bust."
Sherlock lifted his chin in a salute and entered the car, where Johnny Cash sounded loudly. "Go, go, go, my brother will arrive soon!" And Greg accelerated.
Sherlock sat back on the chair, looking elsewhere. It wasn't nice looking at John knowing John didn't remember him.
John looked at him silently. As soon as Sherlock was finished, he sat up straight and shook his head. "It wasn't- it just, you, erm-"
He couldn’t find the beauty. No matter how much he tried. There was something magical and wonderful about the human body, but there was no beauty on it. It was complex and intriguing, but it wasn’t beautiful.
His mom, surprisingly enough, trusted Sherlock. He had no idea how, but that day the greaser and his mother met, Sherlock had been able to convince her he was a good guy despite his clothes and his attitude. She didn't have a single problem with John going to his house, and she was glad he was John's friend. John knew that his mother worried a lot about him being lonely, but truth was he didn't feel lonely at all. He didn't need people like the rest of the world seemed to need people, he didn't care not having someone to talk to, he could find answers in his books. That was until he met Sherlock.
to go to school tomorrow or she'll freak out. And you better not be lying, Holmes. If something is wrong with John..."
He talked about their last conversation, about his 'confession' of being a fake, of inventing Moriarty, he said they'd talked on the phone, and that no matter what John would have said, he would have been forced to jump anyway, for there was no other way out.
He opened his eyes. The ceiling was no longer yellow and light blue and dark blue and white, it was just white.
When he finally reached him, Greg took a look of the hall, trying to see if they were alone. Clearly, he didn't want to be seen talking to someone like John, who rolled his eyes and wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible.
They didn’t stop, they didn’t care. They didn’t see what all of this was doing to Sherlock. He felt his hands getting cold.
"Oh! And one last thing. If you mention anything about this conversation to my brother, I will kick your ass. Clear?"
His voice was shaking, barely above a whisper, it contained all the rage and the hurt John was trying desperately to conceal. He cleared his throat, "Who are you?", he repeated, his voice already failing him by the end of the sentence.
The greaser leaned down and held John's chin, lifting his head a bit and looking at his lips, "your lip is looking better."
