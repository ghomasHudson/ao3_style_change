I can't guarantee that she won't.
I walk along the path, through the bright green trees.
I nod.
Just when I think I'll be here forever—when I keep refusing to give them information and they keep torturing me, even though there isn't much of me left to torture, Mycroft steps in.
It doesn't take me long to pack all of my things I still had most of it in boxes from when I moved in a few weeks ago. I didn't want to unpack everything, because then it would feel so . . . permanent. I wasn't ready for that. Not yet.
“Sherlock!” she screeches, running towards me with open arms.
John shakes his head, not quite understanding.
I look back out the window and see someone leaning against a streetlamp across the street.
. "Hey Sherlock, you okay?" he asks.
x x x
I silently thank Mycroft for teaching me so many languages, because without him I'd have no idea what the man was saying.
“Are you ready for dessert?” Mrs. Hudson asks, even though I'm not even half done with my first plate of food.
Today I will get lost in them, one last time. . .
Hi! Sorry it's been awhile since I updated this story. I kind of lost my inspiration for it and didn't know where I wanted it to go.
When I wake up in the mornings I still expect to find Sherlock to be standing at the open window playing violin.
“Did you figure it out?” I whisper.
Sherlock Holmes.
I wouldn't. I told myself that I wouldn't leave, too. If anything I would stay for Mrs. Hudson.
Sorry for the short chapter, I'll try to make it up on Tuesday with a longer chapter! Thank you so much for reading.
“You have no idea what you put me through.”
Mrs. Hudson must have arranged the funeral. There were far too many flowers for my taste, and I know John wouldn't have done that.
"The newspapers were right all along," I go on. "I want you to tell Lestrade, I want you to tell Mrs. Hudson, and Molly . . . in fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes."

I don't know how long he's been here, or why he didn't intervene sooner.
“I know,” I say. “I'm sorry.”
Such a funny word,
But he hasn't yet, and this will be the last day he visits. He has nothing left to say, and I don't blame him.
I open the door to 221B and as soon as it closes behind me I slump to the floor and I pull my knees up to my chest, letting my head fall into my hands.
For now.
"This phone call," I say, "it's, um. . . it's my note. It's what people do, don't they? Leave a note?"
"I do care. And you bloody well know it," he replied. Sherlock snorted and pulled his dirty sweatshirt tighter around himself.
for help?
ricocheted into his shoulder and he dropped the plate with a clatter. Sherlock glanced over and away, unconcerned.
"I don't know. Think, whose fault is it, John?" he mocked. "I am certainly not keeping you in the middle of Alaska."
The delivery men finally left and Sherlock’s relief was palpable. John watched Sherlock walk back into the living room and prepared himself for another

I pull him in for a hug, holding him tightly. It's really him.
“John.” I say suddenly.
When Angelo comes back I order pasta, the same thing I got last time, and roll a straw wrapper between my thumb and forefinger while I wait for my food.
“Don't put it up for rent!” I say hurriedly.
I stare at the smooth marble. At the name SHERLOCK HOLMES, and all of the flowers crowded around his headstone.
After I eat I take a long hot shower and go to bed. I’m completely exhausted. This has all been a lot. It’s great to have Sherlock back but it’s tiring as well. It was tiring when he was gone though. Maybe I’m just always tired.
Because he's my everything.
I spread my arms out and fall forward off the building, hoping that something will catch me—trusting that this will all go according to plan.
I cough and blood streams out of my mouth.
“I know.” I interrupt.
I think.
I open my mouth to talk but he speaks before I can.
“What do you say we get you out of here,” Mycroft says once everyone else is gone. “Brother mine?”
Okay. Okay. . .
John's voice breaks at the end when he says, “Don't . . . be. . . dead.” And I'm honestly surprised he's made so much progress. I know he's been seeing his therapist—she even made him say it out loud—but most people can't. Say it out loud that is.
I say what everyone thinks of me, "No one could be that clever,"
Even if he knew I was still alive I could never admit that.
My mind is in a million different places, but the main thing I'm thinking is;
“I did this because of you.” He says.
John clenches his jaw. And I continue, "Before we met, I discovered everything that I could to impress you. It's a trick. Just a magic trick."

Many thanks to KeelieThompson1 for writing this compelling story and giving me permission to create a podfic of it.
Length: 23:21
Size:  41.7 MB
This is a fic that I thought about recording years ago, but had procrastinated because there are a lot of different languages in it, which is something I struggle with.  It was written after Season 2, Post-Reichenbach Falls, before Season 3 aired.  I’ve seen it listed on some ‘top 10’ Sherlock fic’s, and the author, SilentAuror, has previously said this is one of the stories she is most proud of.  It’s really a spy/action story, with drama, angst, love and choices.  And one of the best reveals that Sherlock is alive that I’ve read.
Love to hear from you.
Reminder, the chapters in this podfic are stand-alone vignettes to go along with "Rocks of Salvation" and "Nest Among the Stars".  This chapter is just some fluff and tells the story of Mycroft babysitting Ava, which happens 'off screen' but is referred to in Rocks 30.

Reader's Notes:
And thus concludes this part of the Ava Watson ‘verse.  The story will continue in “Crush it ‘till the Petals Fall”, which I have already started recording, so keep an eye out for it.  That will be the concluding part of the main trilogy, which began with “Rocks of Salvation”.  It’s a wonderful tale.  The character development and storytelling is top notch.
The penultimate chapter!  Buckle up!

We switch to John’s point of view in this chapter and show the events of the previous chapter from his POV, as well as some flashbacks, then continue the story forward.
A few thoughts
I fell in love with this story when it was a WIP, and when I started recording the series, it was still incomplete and it seemed likely that it would never be finished (there was a 14 month gap before the final 2 chapters of "Crush.." were posted.  Happily, and luckily for us all, the marvelous KeelieThompson1 DID return to finish it, for which I am exceedingly grateful.  It was lovely to have the tale finished.

Also, there’s at least one line I don’t like how I said, and there are a handful of relatively minor things my Beta suggested could be better, but I am not currently in good voice and have been unable to patch.  So, I’m sending it out into the void anyway, since you’ve waited long enough.  And it’s a fascinating chapter.  This is a key turning point in the story.  It may be a bit confusing to listen to (as opposed to read) due to the nature of how the chapter is presented in the text.  There are timeline changes that may be hard to follow.  It would behoove you to pay attention to the date/timestamps mentioned.

While the original “Tea and Coffee” fic was a single chapter, with all the vignettes, I decided to break it up into chapters so they could be released individually as the chapters that they correspond to are posted (that way spoilers can be avoided).

I have avidly followed this series over the 4+ years it was written.  In fact, when I started recording the podfic for the series, this was a WIP.  And, at the time, it had not been updated in almost a year.  I dearly hoped that it would eventually be finished, and took a leap of faith.   I was beyond thrilled that, about a month after I started the podfic for “Nest Among the Stars”, the author finished the series.  I’m so, so pleased we get to see how everything turns out in the end.  It’s been an amazing story arc.  The character development!  *fans self*
I don't know where this fic is going, but it's an incredible story so far, and I'm buckled in firmly for the ride.

Sorry about the delay on this one.  I really don't like how my voice sounds on this chapter, so was having motivation issues on doing the editing work.  Anyway, here it is.  It is also a bit disjointed - there are 19 different scenes in this 32 minute chapter, so I shorted the musical interval a bit so it wasn't as annoying.  Quite the sell job I'm doin', eh??  There are bits that I like (and no, I'm never complaining about the writing; always when I complain, it's about my vocalization of it).

Sorry about the long delay for this chapter.  I became very, very ill about halfway into recording it and was hospitalized for 5 days.  I've been out for almost 2 weeks now, but still don't totally have my voice back.  However, people tell me it is less noticeable than I think it is.  So.  Um.

I am a pretty harsh critic of my own voice, and there will be some whinging occasionally when I post something that I really am not happy with.  I really did struggle with this particular chapter – the voice was not cooperating this past weekend (which is the best time for me to record), so this chapter is from, hmm, probably six different sessions, and thus the voice matching is not great.  I am not happy with the quality of my voice, but, as my Beta tells me, it’s likely that most other people wouldn’t be able to tell much of a difference.  I can, because I am saturated in it, and I can practically feel sympathetic pains in my throat even listening to some of it.  Just ignore my grousing. :)

I guess I shouldn’t have believed that everything would change since Sherlock got back. I shouldn’t have expected him to spend every waking moment with me, tagging along with me to the store and kissing me when no one was looking

Angelo places a steaming bowl of pasta on the table in front of me and I thank him. When I look back out the window, the figure is gone.

Oof. Sorry for the short chapter, for my absence lately and for the Johnlock kiss being so close yet so far away. I'll hopefully update a longer chapter soon. I hope you're all doing well. <3
As soon as the door closes I rest my head in my hands and breathe deeply. My chest feels tight and I'm tempted to go ask John for those pain killers he offered, but I know he wouldn't give me any now.
I sit on the edge of my bed and quickly survey my room while John stitches up my back, shoulders and chest. I had assumed Mrs. Hudson would have donated most of my things, but looking around the room I find that everything of importance is still here, gathering dust in my dark, vacant room.
I turn back after a few steps as the tears start to escape, streaming down my face. I don't bother to wipe them away. “No, please, there's just one more thing, mate. One more thing—one more miracle—Sherlock, for me. Don't . . . be . . . dead,” my voice breaks on the last word.
While we eat she tells me about this new place she went to for lunch yesterday. “They have

It takes me a moment to process everything she's saying, she was talking so fast.
“Where's Sherlock?”
Thanks for reading this so far, I hope you're enjoying it. Please let me know if you find any spelling errors, this story is not yet edited.
“I need to move on,” my voice drops to a whisper. “I'm sorry.”

I look up at him and his eyes are stunning in the soft afternoon light creeping through the dusty curtains. I think about the day I left—how bright his eyes were against the gray sky. They were almost glowing.
My tears blur her face as I look up at her. “Before he jumped.”
“I'm angry,” I say, taking a deep breath.
“So,” she says, sitting back down. “Why did you suddenly decide to come back?”
I don't know what month it is exactly. I know it's been around six months since I got here because one of the men holding me hostage said, “We've held him for six months and we still can't get any answers,” but what would that make it? April?
Blimey, that would be embarrassing.
Mycroft rolls his eyes again. Nothing has changed. With him at least. “Alright, fine. You don't have to see a doctor, but you should at least make yourself presentable. Watson will think you're homeless.”
I'll come back. Every week.
I bet it was wonderful. Mycroft could brag all he wanted about his job and I wasn't there to take away from his attention or shoot him down.
He rolls up his sleeves to reveal all of the cuts on his forearms. Some of them have faded into scars by now, but the rest of them are fresh—just scabbed over.
“Um . . . ,” I shake my head a little, trying (to no avail) to keep the tears at bay. “You told me once that you weren't a hero. Um. . . there were times I didn't even think you were human, but let me tell you this; you were the best man, and the most human . . . human being that I've ever known and no one will ever convince me that you told me a like. And so . . . there.”
Too risky.
Mrs. Hudson came up earlier and helped me make sandwiches, then she disappeared back downstairs and I haven’t seen her since.

When I can't figure anything out about anyone, I pick the blade back up, pressing it into the skin below my wrist. I drag it across my arm, watching the blood start to run down. It's enough to distract me from the other pain. I'm not with him yet, but I will be.
I open my mouth to protest but Angelo holds his hand up. “Please, I insist.”
The tired but happy look on his face when we solved a case together . . .
It's been almost six months since Sherlock died, and I still don't know what to do. I know know how to get past this horrible black feeling buried deep in the pit of my stomach. Every time I try to move on I think of him and what he would've wanted for me. I like to tell myself that he'd want me to be happy—to finally move out of Baker Street and move on—to start a life without him. But I know him better than that. He would want me to stick around. To wait up for him, even if he's never coming back home.
“I'm fine with my old room, just as long as . . . as long as you don't let anyone else rent it.”
I shake my head and clench my fists. “I can't go back to the flat again—not at the moment.”
Mrs. Hudson's eyes get wide and she looks like she wants to laugh for a second, then she sees the serious look on my face and decides against it. “A fake?” she repeats.
Mrs. Hudson purses her lips and nods, closing the door behind her.
The last thing I see is John's face filling with fear as he says my name again, and then it's over.
“I'll rent it,” I tell her, before I even make up my mind, “I'll even move back in if you want, just please . . . don't let anyone else live there. Not yet.”
Do you think John would've seen Sherlock at Lauriston Gardens if he hadn't taken the long way?
“John?” Mrs. Hudson calls from the kitchen. “Did you find Sherlock?”
He crosses his arms. “Let me take you to a doctor.”
"Okay, shut up, Sherlock. Shut up. The first time we met. . . the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right?"
I take a deep shaky breath as more tears fill my eyes. I'm not sure I'll be able to keep them at by much longer. “Okay.” I say and start to walk away.
“John.” He says softly.
I never meant to cause him so much pain. I'm sorry for that.
I look out the window at 22 Northumberland Street and sigh.
He shrugs and pulls the blanket up to his chest. “Some murderers like to keep souvenirs.”
He nods. “Murder.”
We finish the rest of our meal in silence, save for a few questions from Mrs. Hudson about Sherlock's whereabouts the past year and a half. Sherlock doesn't share very much information. He says he was working under cover for Mycroft and that's about it.
sleep with chains tied to my wrists and ankles. I hear the shouts and screams of the other people around me. I lay on my stomach, because my back is too cut up to sleep on. I've been living off of dirty water and stale bread for the past six months. My ribs noticeably stick out, but that's not even on my top ten things to be worried about list.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You,” he stops crying almost immediately. “You have no idea what you put me through.”
John pulls the phone away from his ear and shakes his head, blinking back tears. He puts the phone back up to his ear and says, "Leave a note when?" even though I'm certain he knows exactly what I'm talking about, even if that's the only thing I'm certain of right now.
“Um . . . I could really use a cup of tea . . . could you . . . ?”
I'm sorry I didn't post this chapter yesterday. I was having a really bad day and couldn't post. The schedule is still Tuesday's and Friday's, it's just this chapter that was late.
The doorbell rings again and that's when I remember Mrs. Hudson went out.
“Sherlock?”
"Just do as I ask!" I yell, then take a deep, shaky breath. "Please," I add, trying to stay calm.
“We need answers!” the man yells. “And I'll do whatever I need to to get those answers. Hit him again.”
"No, I'm coming in," he says, still walking towards the building I'm standing on.
I hear her footsteps getting louder as she approaches and she lets out a small “Oh,” when she sees me.
“Alright,” John says, sighing and rubbing his hands together. “That should do it. Do you need pain killers?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I walk across town to 22 Northumberland Street. I go into the restaurant across the street. Angelo is at one of the tables, taking someone's order.
I call Mrs. Hudson as soon as soon as I get to the car.
Mrs. Hudson clings to my arm again, and I have a feeling it's something I should get used to.
[This chapter has a serious trigger warning! Please proceed with caution]
“Sherlock—”
I nod a little, then throw the phone on the roof behind me.
Mrs. Hudson holds my arm the whole time. I think she's afraid that, if she lets go, she'll lose me too.
I know it's time to move on, but I can't bring myself to do so.
“I'm sorry if there is something I did—or didn't do—to make you leave. I know . . . I know that you didn't actually . . . do it. But—why are you laughing?”
t was stupid to even hope that Sherlock would come back, but I couldn't help it. I had to make sure that I wasn't giving up on him too soon.
and it's comforting—even if that's the one thing that will never change, I'll take it.
But it’s going to be the same. I’m going to tag along to crime scenes and be the person he talks to while he solves the crime. I’ll pretend I know exactly what he’s talking about and it’ll piss him off when he realizes I don’t.
She hangs up and I slide my phone back into my pocket.
He blinks rapidly. "Sherlock,"
Although I'm sure she knows the answer, I say, “I couldn't be alone anymore. The flat I was in was small and boring. Plus, I knew you could use the company.”
John takes the phone away from his ear and screams, "Sherlock!"
“I was so alone, and I owe you so much,” I say, wishing it wasn't too late to say these things to his face. Wishing it wasn't too late for . . . well, everything.
I sigh and sit in the chair. “Fine.”

I brace myself for another kick to the ribs. I can already feel them bruising.
I let out a long breath and look over my shoulder to make sure Mrs. Hudson didn't come back before I rest my fingertips on the cold stone.

"You could." John says, and the way he says it makes me think he actually believes it.
“No. Let me say it.” He says firmly.
“I didn't expect to see you here. You know, after what happened . . .”
“What did you say?”
He used to crumble his biscuits or scones with his fork so it looked like he took a bite out of it. Sometimes he would even hide it under another kind of food so no one asked questions. Sherlock hated that. Whenever I would ask why he didn't eat his food he would roll his eyes and sigh. He never answered.

"An apology. . ."
"What?"
But none of those things happen. Mrs. Hudson hasn't reminded me to pay rent—I think she's afraid I don't have the money. Or, if she does remind me, that I'll end up leaving. We need each other now, because we don't have anyone else.
"I. . . I. . ." I shake my head, "I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this."
Angelo hands me a menu as I sit at the table—the one Sherlock and I sat at with the large picture window.
“Well, I'm glad to have you back,” she says quietly, still not looking up at me. “Whatever the reason may be,”
We sit in silence for a few minutes before John clears his throat. “Sherlock?” he says softly.
Moriarty's henchmen were still out there somewhere, and they would kill John and Mrs. Hudson as soon as they found out I was back.
Sherlock has barely touched the food on his plate, which would be normal for him if his ribs and hip bones weren't sticking out so dramatically. The only clothes that fit him were pajama bottoms with an elastic waist and a white tee-shirt. Most of his clothes were donated after he left, but I kept a few of his things. I'd like to say I kept them because I thought he would come back, but that isn't why. I kept them because—
I sit there while Mycroft (looking far too pleased with himself) makes few phone calls.
“—slows you down,” he finishes for me. “I know. I just thought I would offer.” As he stands and walks to the door I feel panic rise in my chest and I don't want him to leave.
The breeze ruffles my hair and I can hear Mycroft saying, “You need a shave.” I try to replace his voice with John's, but it's slipping away from me.
I don't say anything, because I know there's more he wants to say and I want to give him the opportunity to say it.
“I guess I had hoped you'd come back,” he admits. “But I know now it was stupid to hope that. I was there that day—I saw you jump. I felt for your pulse but there was . . . nothing.”
She nods. “Okay. I'll leave you alone to, um. . . you know.” She lets go of my arm and walks away. I can hear her crying and I turn to see her take a tissue out of her purse and blow her nose.
“I thought—”
I put my left hand out, suddenly out of breath, probably because I'm not used to crying this much. The tears are running down my face now and I don't even bother wiping them away. "Keep your eyes fixed on me. Please, will you do this for me?"
“I . . . I just . . .” he sighs and runs a hand through his short, graying hair. I wonder how much of that gray hair I'm responsible for. “I want you to know that I'm . . .”
“Do you want to come with me?” Mrs. Hudson asks, wrapping her scarf around her neck even though it's still surprisingly warm warm outside. Sometimes I sit in Sherlock's chair that I moved to the window and look outside. I'll watch the water droplets stream steadily down the window. Sometimes I'll press tobacco into Sherlock's pipe—the one he rarely smoked because he liked cigarettes better—and light it, blowing smoke out the crack I opened in the window and watch the smoke swirl, then get beaten down by the rain.

I held his wrist, still warm and covered in blood, hoping and praying I would feel a pulse. But there was nothing. No heart beat, no sign of life whatsoever.

If you follow any of the other stuff I do, 'and your very flesh shall be a great poem' is up to date, as well.  'Echoes of Love and Absence', Chapter 15 is recorded and in pre-beta editing.  I did do one little schmoopy, pure fluff piece for just simple enjoyment which I may get out before I go, but no promises.

And so here we are, on the last part of this amazing story.  We left Sherlock, John and Ava in a pretty grim set of circumstances at the end of “Nest Among the Stars”.

Not super happy with my voice this chapter, it sounds quite hoarse to me.  However, I am very aware that I am my own worst critic and my Beta is too busy today, and I didn't want y'all to be hanging on the cliffhanger from the previous chapter, soooo, here it is.  If it's horrible, sorry.

Hey peeps.  Normally I would spent several more hours processing this chapter, to tighten it up a bit (almost always removing dead air space to improve the pacing), BUT, I'm heading out in the morning on a trip (overseas!) and didn't want y'all to have to wait until I got back.  Wish me luck - going somewhere where I do not know the language - scary.

Gentle listeners, what with dealing with my latest hard drive crash (the second I’ve had in the last 9 months), and my upcoming vacation, I’m feeling bad that I don’t have a finished, final, polished chapter to post for y’all.  However, what I think I will do is post an ‘early look’ preview of Chapter 8, which has been through Beta, it just hasn’t gone through my final pass (where I check/adjust the pauses between phrases and do a last check for background noises that should be cleaned up).  It’s still a good listen, just not ‘quite’ as polished as I like to get it before posting.

Reader's Notes:
After three book length tales, plus two side collections of short stories, it appears that The James Holmes Collection has been brought to its conclusion.  I shall miss hearing how things are going with James.  Such a fascinating, complex character.  There will be many hiccups along the way in his life, I’m sure, though I will just have to imagine them and how they would all eventually pull through together.

As people who have followed along with one of my podfics in progress before know, I am fairly slow at getting chapters out.  The fact that this chapter came out 3 days after the first is an anomaly, I regret to say.  I do get them out as I can, but various things can interfere (job, travel, etc), plus I do have 3 WIP podfics in flight right now, that I update as the authors do (“and your very flesh shall be a great poem”, by CaitlinFairchild and “Only With the Heart” and “Let Us Beware”, by prettyvk).  Several of the chapters later on in the fic are more than double the size of these first ones, and will thus take more time for me to do.

As you’ve probably already detected, I am crap at different languages, and don’t even try to do accents (because I really can’t).  I am doing my best on the language thing (there are a lot of different languages in this fic).  Everything that I am unsure of, I check on the forvo.com site (which is awesomesauce), google translate, and sometimes youtube videos, to try and pronounce it the best I can.  I most likely fail miserably a lot of the time – but I really am trying.

The short musical interlude bits between scenes for this podfic comes from “Civilian”, from Wye Oak.  It is a bit bouncy, which may not always feel appropriate after particular scenes in the story, but I kind of wanted to go with something more lively for this recording, since it’s such an action tale.  And I just like the song -- check it out sometime to hear the whole thing.  In general, I try to have a unique musical interlude for each podfic (especially the multi-chapter ones).

Ok, now, after you've listened to this chapter, image what it was like to follow along with this fic as it was written.  After this chapter, it was 14 *months* and 9 days before the next update (not that I was stalking it or anything).  This is not a complaint.  I love this story and I am oh-so-grateful that the author came back to finish it, it's just that it was agony to be left in limbo for that long after the way that chapter ended.  You will not have to wait that long.  I should have the next chapter up within the next day or so.

I hope this podfic gets some traction.  I got a bit spoiled with ATBABC, which had a pretty large following as I created the podfic for it.  This little orphan doesn't seem to.  But trust me, it's a GREAT STORY!  The main three fic arc (Rocks of Salvation, Nest Among the Stars and Crush it 'til the Petals Fall) is an astonishing tale, with some really interesting character development, drama, humor, etc.  It's worth a listen.  Don't be scared away by parentlock; it's a compelling story!.

Chapter 9 of "Crush it 'till the Petals Fall", written by KeelieThompson1
Gird yourselves, my lovelies.  We’ve come complete circle back around to the events of chapter 1.
“Enjoy!”
Such an interesting premise, that Sherlock would come across an abused child when he confronts Sebastian Moran as he attempts to take down James Moriarty’s empire in order to keep John Watson safe.  Prettyvk deftly wove a fascinating tale of Sherlock struggling to deal with this damaged child, at the same time as dealing with the consequences of coming back years after appearing to commit suicide at the Reichenbach Fall.  All facets of the story were told with sensitivity and a delicate touch.  The growth in all the relationships is subtle and believable and heart-wrenching … and lovely.

It starts with a prologue, set seven months in the future, which, fair warning, is chock full of angst and melodrama.  Sherlock is Not In A Good Place, emotionally.  Then, with the next chapter, it goes back in time to just after the end of “Rocks of Salvation” and this story tells the tale of how things went from there, to the catastrophic events of the prologue.  The third part of the story arc then continues with “Crush it ‘till the Petals Fall”, which deals with the aftermath.
"Oh, God." He looks up and fear fills his pale face and his eyes that always seem to be a different colour. Today they're a piercing blue.
“Because. 'Do it.' You sound like a preteen who's afraid to say sex out loud.” I snort.
I tell Mrs. Hudson I'm going to take a walk to clear my head and take the long way to Lauriston Gardens, the first crime scene I went to.
Tears stream down my face, not because I'm going to die—because I'm not—but because of John. The look on his face as he figures it all out. "I'm a fake."
“Are you sure you don't want to take anything?” he asks, glancing at my back.
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't worth it.
I push myself out of Sherlock's chair and go to the door. They ring the doorbell again just as I open the door, and the person standing in front of me is the last person I expected.
He's angry, and I don't blame him.
make sure to stay out of view while I watch John talk to my headstone. Little does he know, sitting below him in the damp, fresh dirt, is an empty coffin. I try not to think that someday I will fill that coffin. I wonder who would go to my funeral then, when I'm old and have lied to them more times than I can count.
John looks shocked.
It's when I hear a man—my brother—say, “Leave us. I'll try to get answers myself,” that I know I'm going to make it.
I sit up straight as he hands me a steaming cup of tea. “Thank you.”
he thing about someone leaving your life so suddenly—so unexpectedly—is that you don't have time to prepare yourself for it. You can't make a plan for the bad days when you really miss them and want to go with them—to find them in the afterlife or wherever it is people go when they're gone.
Don't thank me yet. You should read the chapter first.
Sherlock climbs into bed beside me and sighs.
I take my phone out of my pocket to call Mrs. Hudson, but I know it's no use—I can't force her to come every week.
Mrs. Hudson pats my arm sympathetically and I try not to break down.
When I don't say anything, Angelo claps his hands and rubs them together like he just came up with some evil plan. “What can I do for you?”
I force myself to smile.
I laugh and he stares at me sadly from the ground, probably wondering for a moment if I'm right. If I'm really
I dream about that moment every night. I dream about my best friend—my only friend—jumping off of the rooftop. About the blood covering his face and my fingertips pressing against his wrist, hoping for a pulse. Then nothing.
The thing about Mrs. Hudson is that she can’t be tied down. She does just fine on her own and she doesn’t really need a man in her life.
There are tears in both of our eyes now.
I make a mental note to confront Mycroft the next time I see him and ask him why he let his younger brother get beaten to a bloody pulp.
I turn the corner and walk to Lauriston Gardens, the first crime scene I took John to, and stand outside of the house for a moment.
'm home.
I inch closer to the ledge, looking down at him. "John," I say, hoping he will hear the longing in my voice—the longing for him.
I make a mental note to have Mycroft's men find them and have them arrested—or killed, I don't mind.
I'd seen plenty of dead people before in the army, but this was different. This time no one knew how the person died. They weren't just stuck in the line of fire.
With every day that passes I forget small things like the colour of John's eyes, and how his whole face would wrinkle up like a puppy's when he laughed.
“Sorry doesn't make it better. I was your best friend. I deserved to know you were alive. Even a phone call, Sherlock. Is that too much to ask for, a simple phone call?”
He turns and looks surprised when he sees me. “John!”
“And the fighting!” she continues, her voice shaking. “Drove me up the wall with his carryings-on!”
"No, stay exactly where you are. Don't move." I order.
The cracking of the whip is deafening as it hits my back.
My face falls when I see the empty space beside me. Because John isn't here. He hasn't been for months now, but I still can't used to the feeling.
"Stop there." I tell him and he stops. "Okay, look up. I'm on the rooftop."
Now that I'm all caught up and I've posted everything I have written so far, I'd like to inform you of my updating schedule: this story will be updated every Tuesday and Friday at no specific time.
Mrs. Hudson comes back upstairs to make sure I’ve eaten and to see if I need anything before she goes out.
“What about the eyes?”
I nod and take an bite of beans, mashing some up and scattering then across my plate so it looks like I ate more than I did. I learned this trick from Sherlock. If you mix your food around and crumble it up, putting some in piles and scattering the rest around, it looks like you’ve eaten more than you have.

And because Dr. John Watson was apparently a very tolerant man, he took the phone. James exhaled slowly, relieved.
