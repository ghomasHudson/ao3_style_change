"Alright..."
"And why would that interest you?"
"We've heard some rumours and therefore wanted to discuss them with you face to face," Oleander replied.
"W...what? When?"
*"Once upon a time…"*
"Do others usually assume you're a murderer?"
"Hmm?"
"Alright."
Sherlock nodded; "Alright then," he turned to his companion, "Joan, in the meanwhile I want you to talk to Sebastian. He won't tell me anything but maybe you can get him to talk. Any bit of information you can get out of him about the case or about Moriarty might be crucial. I've arranged everything with Mycroft. He will send you a car in a few minutes."
After sherlock was ready and they had shared breakfast while laughing over stupid jokes like two school boys, John took sherlock's hand in his.
"Because the previous two victims were vampires and our murderer clearly has a pattern."
Nothing criminal happened for another forty five minutes. Joan ordered a lemonade, she needed to be sober and have a clear mind tonight for whatever that was about to happen and she's never been one to drink too much anyway. Sherlock didn't drink anything at all. When she looked up again, a young looking man, dressed in a black suit was walking in through the entrance. He had dark black hair which he'd combed to the back.
"It's not ok."
"Maybe they simply enjoy the harmony," she said, trying to focus on their topic to avoid thinking about the glass.
Once he was assured that Sherlock had enough blood in him and his starvation didn't pose any potential threat any longer, Mycroft left 221B. He wasn't sure why Sherlock wished to protect his companion so badly, even from himself, but he'd promised to protect her and he would keep his word.
Of course Mycoft was aware of what Sherlock had done. It was wasn't a surprise. The caution in Mycroft's voice was deadly serious and it irked Sherlock."Whether it does or doesn't is no concern of yours."
"Owe me?"
"Well, you're a vampire. I don't think getting in will be too much of a trouble for you."
Suddenly her wound started aching again. Mycroft was right, this was a battle indeed. "Out of one battle and into another… well done, Watson," she whispered.
Well I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter. ❤ kudos and comments VERY appreciated 🙏🏻
"He believes that feeding slows him down so he neglects it when he's busy with a case. This isn't the first time he's been like this but it's by far the worst condition I've ever seen him in."
He smiles and plays with his ring on his finger. "It'll snow tonight."
"Of course I'm sure, Mycroft. There's no doubt about it," Sherlock said, careful to keep his voice down.
Sherlock was (and still is) so fascinating and beautiful that I was immediately mesmerized by him. We only briefly spoke and he said that we should meet the next day to look at a flat he's had his eye on, before he dashes out of the lab.
Sophia & Sherlock go to confront Jackson. How will it go?
He watched her in silence for a moment and then he replied; "You're welcome."
"Hold on. Why are you telling me all this?"
"What rumours?"
There was only determination in her eyes and nothing else, "Yes."
"Yeah, you may be. But I'm not ready to go through seeing you high again; don't think I'll ever be."
"John?"
"Why do you think there'll be another target at all? Maybe that's all there is and the murderer will just stop."

Death couldn't be so loud and painful and you don't hear other people calling out to you with urgency in their voice when you're dead. No; he wasn't dead, he couldn't be and yet he couldn't stop the disappointment that accompanied the comprehension of this fact surge through him. He only half opened his eyes, but that was still a good sign nonetheless. When his vision regained focus, he was surprised to still be alive and even more so to find a stranger by his side. "Who... are... you?" he asked in a barely audible tone when his eyes landed on her.
"Of course... their hands were tied and they were running out of time. They desperately needed help. So the only remaining question now is that if they ever found the antidote."
"Our bodies don't use much energy, our hearts don't beat and we don't necessarily need to breathe. So we have a lot of energy stored away for when we may have need of it."
"The violin?" He asked with a small frown of confusion.
"What? What are you talking about?" She looked up at him, her eyes widened with what she had heard.
He rolled his eyes. "And what were you doing with your 'life' anyway? You constantly saved the lives of unimportant people who wouldn't even bother to say 'thank you' in return, ate crap hospital food and drank it's horrible coffee on a daily basis and lived alone in a matchbox sized apartment."
"I'd honestly come here to help you, Sebastian, but I can't do that if you don't cooperate with me."
"Yes. We rarely get to have breakfast together because either I'm working or we're on a case so I thought it'd be a nice change for once."
"So you just bluffed to save me? It's not true then, is it? You don't think that I'm your companion?"
Sherlock watched the night sky through his bedroom window. Stars winked at him and he couldn't help but wish that he could be as far from the earth as those blinking stars were.
"Is she alright?"
"Look, I don't like it either. But we have to try. Desperate times and all that."
He looks at me with a sceptical gaze, he knows something is up but doesn't know what and he hates not knowing.
"Well... yes."
He sat down on his armchair, remembering that night was enough to fuel his anger anew. "I saw what he was doing and yes, rage took over me. It was instinct. I didn't stop to think about it."
"And how exactly is that supposed to be reassuring for me?"
"He trusts you, and I trust him."
Alright. So we sort of unravelled the case in this chapter. Understandably things are a little bit awkward between Joan and Sherlock right now after the last chapter but they sorta put that away by the end. So I hope you enjoyed. 🥰❤ Kudos and comments appreciated
If this was meant as a threat, it surely wasn't an empty one. He was perfectly capable of locking her up in this room like a prisoner and she knew that no matter how hard she'd try, she wouldn't be able to get out on her own.
"That's not important! Venenum will want to see my companion for themselves now that they think I have one. If you leave and they don't see my companion; they'll be searching for you. You can't escape them and I don't even want to think about what will happen if they catch you which they WILL ."
"Oh. It's what you you'd left for me last night for the party. Clothes and etc."
"Your bond is at the early stages now but it will only grow stronger over time."
Eurus stopped weeping and grabbed John’s hand, “You mean it? You really think you can pull it off John?”
Despite the assurance he had just given and his inner vows to keep this as professional and distant as possible, as soon as the car was out of sight John literally hotfooted back to the bedroom to be with Sherlock.
“Oh thank God….no, no, I mean, thank God you are not….no, forget what I just said,” Sherlock mumbled, wishing he could disappear. John’s eyes never left him and his bemused grin grew wider as Sherlock backed off till his back hit the tree trunk. John moved closer till their bodies were almost touching, their breaths nearly mingling, their body heat buffeting off each other.
“Papers…..”
“Sure thing ma’am. Good day everyone, we shall take our leave.”
Half an hour later John had to intervene though. “I think we better get to Northern Lights now. Someone is waiting for us there, remember?” He said to Sherlock.
Alone with Sherlock for the first time, John felt overcome by emotions as he remembered his days with Sherlock along with his earlier life. Gosh, had he known better he’d have acquitted Sherlock in his own way.
us. This is the
“Yeah, but who did it?”
That was when John saw someone else, another figure crouching in the other corner of the kitchen. He was about to lunge at that one too when a bright light was flashed on his eyes, causing him to squint and pause midway. Damn! He wished he could switch on the lights now and see how many more were hiding there. Somewhere at the back of his mind another thought itched,
The entire room had been done up exactly the way his mother used to prefer.
“But these are not even his favorite,” Victor frowned, “Scotch, games……?!”
“Goes without saying,” John said instantly, also feeling a bit bad about being too self-centered, “But what really happened to Molly? She has a susceptible stomach, hope it’s not a bad case of food poisoning.”
“You were one of my prospects my pretty Sherly,” Jim said with cool confidence and utter disdain, stalking around Sherlock and making clucking sounds at the back of his throat, “Look at yourself in the mirror! You’re the perfect bait! You are cute, good looking, educated, someone a rich dude would eventually fall for. There’s no dearth of foolish rich people and stupid poor people. All you need to do is ensure they meet! So that’s what Sebby and I did. We ensured you guys met and whatever else happened afterwards was pure and simply chemistry. Two sexually repressed and pleasure deprived men; put them on the same cozy bed and they would start monkey-humping sooner or later, yeah? Hahaha!!!”
The gun was pressed a bit harder into his skull before it was removed. Then a smooth, cultured, polished voice said, “Follow me.”
Lunch alone, dinner alone, evening alone. Finally it was night time again, past ten, and Sherlock found himself sitting on the bed and watching something on the laptop John had given him. But he was only half-watching it. His mind was totally on John’s strangely evasive behavior.
“Ohhhhh…..!!!”
Victor suppressed a grin and turned back to his lunch, thereby ending the conversation for now. But he was very sure Sherlock would speak about this man soon. For the last three weeks he had been mentioning him off and on but nowadays it seemed things were getting hotter. Sparks would fly between them soon and they’d be forced to communicate. Perhaps if I can expedite it in some way…..
“Fuck it’s cumming!”
“Are you out of your mind Dyson? Waste this awesome leaf….. They call it the first flush of autumn, a very rare blend of sweetness and slight wood and vanilla taste….. If you’re not drinking it then I am. I am thirsty. I missed this tea…..”
“What?” Sherlock blinked, as if he hadn’t even heard him properly.
Culverton’s head was spinning. While he was quite relieved that one more customer hadn’t stormed in cursing at him for selling that car by deceit, he was also worried that John would not part from it now. He had an opportunity to win a bigger profit from this car.
Again a totally regular pic, such as those taken by millions of tourists every year.
Within seconds John got there, yelling out his release as his hips jerked and thighs spasmed from the sharp throbbing all over his lower body. He release burst after burst of thick seed, grabbing the headboard of the bed to stay upright as his strength completely drained from him. His orgasm seemed to linger on and on as he kept fucking the eager mouth, staring at it in wide eyed wonder, enjoying the sight of seeing some of his creamy release cling to Sherlock’s chin.
At one point John felt his semen rush up and buried his nose in Sherlock’s hair, breathing him in deep as he experienced a mind-shattering orgasm of epic proportions. ‘Yeah Sherlock...Sherl….’ were the only words that came out when he came so hard his soul nearly parted from his body. John shuddered hard enough to almost smother Sherlock into the pillows as he came and came, filling his lover to the brim with his essence.
John smiled and smacked Sherlock’s rump hard, making him yelp. “It seems my little missy can’t even speak at this moment. What did you say about you being mostly your brain and the rest being merely an appendage? May I safely assume that I have your brain in my grasp now, through that pretty pink cock of yours? Yeah?”
“Fun? Bomb in your own flat is fun?”
“Jim? Jimmy?”
not a virgin, she had had several relationships before, but I suppose she has already told you so, she’s an honest person who doesn’t fake it,” Sherlock muttered.
“Maybe,” Sebastian murmured, though he was a bit taken aback by the sudden change in his boyfriend’s mood and pretty sanguine the scream originated somewhere close by, he didn’t poke or prod his man over this. No use spoiling the day!
“Feels like Christmas, feels like home,” Elizabeth Smallwood announced as the lights came on that evening. She also forgave Sherlock for not ‘coming back’ sooner and acknowledged the mistakes John made, thereby burying the hatchet with the young man.
“There is nothing to share, really.”
“Captain?”
An hour later John had sold back the car for full fifteen thousand extra pounds to the same man who had conned him six weeks ago. He quickly called one of his ‘hired hands’ and said, “Come over and take your ten grand back, plus two thousand more for your services. Thank your boys please and thank you too.”
“Wasn’t that supposed to happen inside me?” Sherlock asked, hips moving in pumping motions as he tried to grind himself against the sheets beneath.
The impish grin on the Irishman’s face disappeared and he looked sharply at his taller friend, ferociously peeling a banana. The “Stop assuming you oaf,” Jim snapped and added crossly, “I went to check on the guys but found out that only the women were there. The fellas are staying at the inn. You were right.”
“Wait and see what an intergalactic-level fuck I give to
I’m afraid it’s too late for me to change that sir.”
“I…. um…. I need to go…..”
“He didn’t tell anyone, so how could we stop him. He left something for you though. A note and a gift which you’d love it for sure sir.”
“You be here….um, I need to….erm….go to Mrs. Hudson’s for a bit…..see if she needs anything for tonight’s dinner.”
“Come, let’s have some champagne then. The best in town is waiting or us to uncork and start the party!”
No problem.”
Maybe Mike was right, he was being way too conservative and a doubting Thomas. He would get a job soon. Until then he could sure afford to pay this low rent. But he was 100% sure he had heard the figure incorrect or maybe Mike had heard it incorrect. How could anyone rent out a flat on Baker Street with no security deposit and a six hundred a month lease?
Not that he wasn’t happy for his friends, he sure was, but it all added up to his own loneliness and confusion. He cursed John for making him desire company and then abandoning him without a reason or warning.
Mycroft interrupted him quite uncharacteristically. He had always been a very good listener and his impeccable manners prevented him from cutting off someone/anyone in the middle of a sentence,
“Is Sebastian also like his father?” Sherlock asked, helping her sip some water.
“It is okay.”
“Sherlock?” John called out to him as the latter was leaving the room.
“Wait, wait,
“C’mon, it’s not that difficult to find out, is it?
I could understand why he was upset. Leaving a case half-way or inconclusive wasn’t his way of settling it for good. It was a murder, of the patriarch of an upper middle-class family living in a spanking new town house on the newly posh Boynton street. The victim was a seventy five year old man who had been found dead under the Christmas tree but none other than his six grandkids, all aged between five and fourteen, barely a day before his family had landed up at the new house to celebrate Christmas with him and his wife.
Sherlock felt a sense of dread spread inside him. For a moment he thought he’d ask John straight up about his intentions but that would only warn him in advance and he could back off for now, only to try again. He wanted to see John’s heart, he wanted to see his values, he wanted to see if John truly cared about him and was the same man he came across as. Good, I will lead him on and let’s see where we go from there.
“I don’t really like them,” Jim grumbled as the four men made their way back to the town after dropping the girls at a shopping mall for some purchases. They would come back in a rental car and the next morning move to a hotel in town.
“A woman who’s jealous and obsessed does better research than FBI and can be far more persuasive than any detective. See, I told you what she really was. Someone who’s trying to make her life better, an ambitious woman who doesn’t want to work her way up but marry her way up. I was right all along. So why don’t you trust me now and get in touch with her before she comes down to our doorstep.”
“The last thing I want is for my romantically naïve son to think you two are in an exclusive relationship or this is moving towards a commitment,” she added, bringing him down to earth.
Sherlock waited for John to say something more or ask him more questions but John never did and he didn’t add anything to his answer either.
He regretted his outburst immediately. Her eyes were filling with tears. Raising his hand in a gesture of honesty and sincerity he said, “Sorry, I said a bit too much. But I’m not okay with some things and you did cross the line. It was a bad idea trying to date someone at work……”
“But sir…..”
“I-I-I saw a pair of, a couple of….. I-I don’t know, you will only laugh at me if I tell you what it is,” she hesitated and sat down heavily on her bed, “I went to the washroom and when I came back, I saw someone peering into the room. Thank God the windows have rods otherwise it could have just come inside!”
But that smile had nothing pleasant about it, not did it reflect happiness. It was sinister, sharp, sly, it almost cut through Sherlock’s skin as it focused on him for a bit longer than necessary. John seemed quite pleased to see his cousin though and stepped up to give him a hug. They made quite the contrast as two brothers, nearly eight or nine inches difference between them in terms of height.
John grinned, “Well said and well corrected. This feels like our old bedroom and I feel like my old self once again. I couldn’t have asked for something better than this, a clean, airy room with freshly laundered sheets and the whiff of flowers. Well, well, well, something is going on around the house isn’t it? What have you been up to baby?”
“Try me,” she said confidently.
“I won’t,” she answered, “But how many days do I have left?”
“What’s the legend of the lake anyways?” Molly asked the woman sitting to her right, frowning slightly, “And those three deaths that you spoke about, Anth? How did those happen and are the two things, the deaths and the legend I mean, interconnected somehow?”
“We are all on a spectrum John. Sometimes we are strictly straight, sometimes we are slightly gay. Most of us.”

I know AO3 has a diverse group of readers and writers, therefore a small word of caution to all. This story doesn't exactly have saintly characters and a lot of things they do in this series are wrong, just wrong. But it's only part of a plot line and I do not intend to encourage anyone to behave like these characters. It won't hold up in real life and you'll most likely get either into trouble or get hurt.
Then came the 8:40 train. The same one John had been taking for the past three months even though he could easily afford a cab or simply start much later. His office offered him flexi-hours and he could easily reach by ten or ten-thirty. It wouldn’t make a difference.
“Can’t…..ohhh….let me?”
John’s eyes collided with Mycroft’s and the moment he saw the older man’s brows lower, he turned on his heel and walked back the same way he had come.
Soon Sherlock established that the death of the dog was actually accidental and the actual target was the old family retainer who was walking the animal. It was assumed the old retainer had run away but he was actually clubbed to death and lying under the walkway bridge over which the mutt had been shot to death. Eventually that was connected to a family heirloom, a priceless diamond that once belonged to Marie Antoinette, which the count’s mum had given her son before she passed. It was worth several millions and the culprit was none other than the journalist, who was actually Bergo’s first-born, a son born out of the wedlock to a teenage sweetheart who, out of scorn from being abandoned, had filled her son’s head with poison. That son, born and raised in the States, had disguised himself as a journo and visited the estate to con his dad and take the jewel, and killed the old retainer since he refused to steal the jewel on his behalf. He killed the dog when the canine had tried to attack him. “It was my share of the wealth, I too am your son,” the unrepentant criminal thundered.
“NO!”
Sherlock wears leather and makeup
“I understand. Actually it’s a personal thing. Till two years ago I used to live in London and live the sort of life you just described, minus the family and kids part. I was working hard to get my PHD, teaching online and occasionally in the class, going out with students and friends from Uni. But then one fine day my parents passed in a road mishap. It was so sudden that I was left bereft of speech and even tears.  I thought I had more time but….. so I moved here, started working at the local Uni, completed my PHD and focused on the sort of work my mummy and papa used to do. Help the needy.”
“You have. And you just did, once again. You set me straight. I wish someone else had done that years ago. But it’s you, just you, who pulled it off.”
“I’m here,” came the reply from a foot behind him, “J-awn….I knew you’ll save me.”
“That would soon be Sir Mycroft Holmes. He will be knighted soon.”
“Wow! Sounds like something that’s too good to be true. I saw his photograph, he’s quite good looking as well. Despite the long nose and the too close-set eyes. Something very captivating about him, I have to give him that.”
Sherlock was rushing down the slope, unbothered by any risks of falling down himself, constantly calling out his fiancé’s name. The lack of answers made him feel a sinking sensation inside but he labored on. Maybe John had survived. Maybe if he took the man to the hospital he would recover and things would be okay again.
With that he stood next to the door, “Now, if you don’t mind, I have other things to take care of. I wish you all a very good day ahead. Excuse my rudeness and lack of hospitality but I wasn’t exactly expecting you.”
“Yeah, I am just…. I have motion sickness, I think.”
“This-This is just the right size.”
“Oh leave him alone and let’s enjoy this afternoon,” Reginald said jovially, buttering a scone, “Whatever he is, admit it he’s the darling of the family. He can get away with murder if he wishes to, all he will need to do is smile or make that puppy face. Relax, he will change his mind as soon as he realizes we have some nice plans for him…..for example that tree house. Then, as he finds some friends around these parts and realizes how convenient it is for him to visit his mentor, the professor who’s assisting him with his thesis and lives close by, he will surely change his opinion and actually start enjoying his life here. As for London, it’s only an hour by train and an hour and half by car. The Baker Street flat is in his name,
“Yes, yessss!!!”
John had gone up ahead into the woods and was looking at something in there. Or rather, he was searching for something or someone in the woods. When he felt Sebastian’s hand on his shoulder he jumped and got a real start. “Gosh, don’t do that man,” he said panting, putting his hand on his throat, “Jesus Christ! My heart jumped all the way into my mouth, almost. Are we starting already?” He looked at the Lexus and the three ladies bundling into it in a hurry.
, ohhh
“I have never cheated on you. I never stole from you.”
“You could call it a ‘getting to know each other better’ thing.”
John grinned. Sherlock pouted, looking away.
“I am glad that I was able to be of some help. So now would you…..”
“Yes-Yes daddy,” Sherlock replied, enjoying the mood and role play. He wasn’t acting, he really did feel a bit intimidated at the way John was claiming him. But it was the sort of fear he welcomed and enjoyed. Meds of not, it was intoxicating to watch John’s transformation and this avatar, where he couldn’t help himself but ravage Sherlock over and over again. Sherlock reached out for the lube in the top drawer of the nightstand but was flipped over to lie on his stomach. “Jawn…. I wanted to take the…..” Hard hands held him down in response and John placed sucking kisses on his bubble butt cheeks before the wonderful feeling of a hard, wet tongue swiped up and down his crack.
He thought of buying some figures and putting them on the deck, the captain, the man at the wheel, a few sailors, a first mate.
“No, I mean, you cut quite a dashing figure that time….despite your height.”
“But before that, we need to get rid of a thorn in our flesh.”
“Nothing,” John said too quickly, “Nothing at all.”
,” Sally repeated, picking up a chicken drumstick with a crispy batter coating, “Does he also feel that way?”
John was so lost and distracted by the events from the previous evening, the dramatic revelation of Mycroft’s lover and Sherlock’s overall ‘silence’ towards him, that he couldn’t eat as well as he would have liked to. He had only half an appetite and concentrated mostly on the cod and some salad and a few pieces of the excellent fudge. He avoided the wine during lunch but noticed, much to his consternation, that Sherlock was downing it as if wine was about to go out of fashion soon. A stolen glance or two at Mycroft showed he was also affected by the situation and concentrated more on his phone than the food on his plate. For a man who pigged out on the food that came from his beloved mummy’s kitchen, he ate very modestly that day.
After a pause he added, softly, almost in a whisper, “You are a good man John Watson. You’re humble, modest, sincere.”
Eventually Sherlock solved a case sitting at home. It took him three days and endless complaints about how his lack of mobility had slowed down his mind too, but John knew the whole complaining aspect had a tinge of ‘I still did it’ kind of euphoria in it.
, got used to all kinds of surprises when he got back home after a few days of traveling, be it for business or personal reasons. Not that he traveled alone too often, since his alternate profession as a general surgeon was limited to a private clinic in London and the two days he visited Barts as a consulting surgeon. But there were times when he visited a different city to attend a friend’s wedding or a rare occasion abroad when he had to attend a medical conference or seminar.
“You sure you don’t want some coffee or tea….” Mike insisted. “No, no,” Sherlock refused politely, “I have to be back to work. I have already missed one class.”
John smiled, “Eight years of prison life has changed me immensely. I stepped inside in 2008, now it’s 2016. I heard we have something called WhatsApp now, a texting application. We have iPhone 7 whereas I had seen the first version and owned one…..” a wistful look crossed his face, “Gifted by Sherlock. I have written a trilogy of books, as you know, and my friends Jim and Sebastian have kept up my travel portal and it seems it’s doing well. I’ll go back and take charge, try and get my books published, I hope the house I owned can be back in shape in a week’s time at the most. There’s plenty to do. Also, I am a man of forty three now, no longer a younger adult but an early middle aged one. I guess I have enough to fill the next thirty to forty years or so.”
There was pin-drop silence in the kitchen. Mr. and Mrs. Holmes exchanged glances. John sat there, shocked. Even Sherlock held his tongue thereafter, realizing he had spoken too much this time. Mycroft looked a bit pale and stricken, but recovered admirably well and quickly to excuse himself from the room. He took the backdoor and exited the house, walking away towards the kitchen garden.
. They visited the culinary museum of the college, the visitor’s area of the space institute and the Cathedral, then had some famous fish and chicken fare the town was popular for and departed for London in the evening! But that was not all that West Eden was known for! The lake beside the town was also huge, as was the wide, gushing brook that fed it, and many anglers came by for the weekends and filled the inns and Airbnb’s, returning home on Monday mornings with fresh and plentiful catch.
Later that evening John came home looking scared. I told him I wasn’t angry for him being late. He gave me a helpless glance and a watery smile. I told him I could get him something and he jumped three feet from his chair. Then, when he saw it was a can of beer he sighed loudly and smiled and said, “Oh something which isn’t cooked. Yeah, bring it on, come and sit on my lap baby.”
“God! This isn’t happening!! He told us he feared for his life and I thought he was mentally ill.”
Sherlock exhaled hard, “This is news. I am supposed to be fixing our future, not his.”
“You’ve found a woman yet?” Sebastian asked.
John resisted the temptation of hiding behind the poplar tree, listening in and having a quiet laugh. Mycroft sounded like a college boy on his first blush of romance, trying to please his mate at any cost. It was so unusual for the staid, stern and dour Mycroft to behave like that, it made John wonder if falling in love made people do silly stuff.
John laughed, seeing Sherlock squirming. “Don’t worry. I am not going to ask for sex tonight. tonight we just get used to sleeping next to each other.”
They had reached the flat and were stepping inside. The last parts of the sentence were easily heard by Jim who was, for some strange reason, caressing Sherlock’s butt. “Oh don’t believe him Johnny boi,” Jim giggled, “I have changed but only where I see the need.”
“Ah I see. But why did you come down all the way just for this? You could have called. Or maybe called his cell phone.”
Instead she stumbled and fell and rolled down at least thirty feet into a ditch. That thing was still following her and she feebly pulled and tugged at the loose branches earth, stones and dried leaves to cover herself completely. Hopefully that thing would go away, hopefully.
He looked around. Sherlock’s clothes were scattered everywhere. A suitcase and a duffel were missing. He had clearly returned to the flat when John was not around, packed a few items and left again. Was that for good? There were still many, many items of Sherlock’s lying around. But if John knew his lover/friend, he was aware Sherlock could do without all those items or just buy them again. Thanks to John and his interventions on Sherlock’s finances, the detective had a neat sum tucked away in accounts and investments that Mycroft had no visibility to. He could rebuild his whole life and no one would be any wiser.
When they reached home on Wednesday night, Sherlock did something strange. He just climbed on the coffee table, curled up and started snoring.
, sit down, we shall discuss this properly. And wear this, my robe, even if it’s a bit too short. Your teeth are chattering so loud Mrs. Hudson can hear it from her flat.”
Sebastian! How are you? What did you say? No, I am not trying to sleep with Jim. No, never. I am a married man now. I was calling you for another reason altogether. You see, John misses the cheese, olive and cracker snack you used to make while you guys drank together. Yes, he was telling me no one can make it the way you do. Oh wonderful, thank you so much.”
“Hmmm, by doing that they’re effectively locking me down, choking me. I need to be out and about, do things I like to do.”
“What’s crawled up your arse now?” John asked a bit irritably. He was already tense and Sherlock’s weird behavior was the last thing he needed.
The bespectacled lawyer still gave the ailing old woman a pleading glance and she noticed it immediately despite the sudden coughing fit she had. Taking a sip of water that the nurse offered her, she took a few deep breaths and said softly. “I haven’t become senile Mr. Holmes. Your father retired last year, otherwise he would have been the first person to advise me to do something like this. For the past forty years he has advised me, perhaps before you were even born…. Oh yes, he wasn’t even married then.” She wheezed a little and asked, “How’s your mum doing? She is a doctor, I remember that correct, right?”
They sat quietly for some time, hearing the various birds and bees in the garden and the quiet flow of a stream nearby. Sherlock could sense the reasons behind John’s natural trust issues and inability to have healthy relationships.
“Had some personal work. Sorry to have kept you in the dark. Now, can you start work a little later today? Is there someone who can fill-in for you? Maybe two hours or so?”
“I can understand why,” Sherlock responded evenly, “But for a man like you, whatever I have observed so far, I am sure you will find ways to cope.”
“Nope, they have the evening and night off. No one will be disturbing us there, unless of course…..” Jim trailed off, tapping his chin as he effortlessly reversed the car. I can’t believe you’re cursed, you look so innocent, so dazzling, so pure! “Unless what Jimmy?” Sebastian asked, trying not to give away his inner turmoil to his boyfriend.
“Don’t swear, mummy wouldn’t approve.”
John chuckled and kissed one nipple, making the beautiful green-eyed man hiss. “Then let’s expel that fear forever, shall we?”
“Get back in bed so I can have some ice cream off you???”
“Then why not tomorrow? On Christmas morning?”
Mycroft snorted, “I was unable to understand why he was so obsessed.” He neither confirmed nor denied the whole thing and went on, “Then we bonded, spoke, even after he left we stayed in touch, he started visiting me, there were gifts exchanged, late night phone calls, jokes texted and pictures shared. John, he makes me feel younger, better, happier, it’s a feeling I cannot describe.”
“Cut him some slack, it’s a lot to take in and process, isn’t it?”
The great detective had everything, to put it in simple words. A brain that was unparalleled, a profession that adored him as much as he adored the profession, fame and reputation, money and respect, even a fandom that fantasized about him and his work and even his personal life. Thanks to his colleague, housemate and lover John Watson’s blog and books, he was now a celebrity. They both were. There were T shirt and diaries and even small chibi dolls of them which sold like hot cakes. The proceeds from them were mostly managed by Mycroft and John, who bothered about smaller things like money and investments, while Sherlock continued to do what he loved to do – His chemistry experiments and inventions and purging the world of crime.
. John braced himself for an earful, something he had been expecting from Janet for a while. The entire week she had avoided talking to him but he was sure she was saving up all the anger for a final outburst.
“Well you certainly have a fine way of showing that to us Harry,” Mycroft said in a contemptuous voice, “I am disappointed.”
for him. Whether you’re a male or female, you eventually look for someone who’s perfect for you. They needn’t be perfect for real, they just need to be what you need. Find out what Sherlock needs, feed him that and he will be yours forever.”
“That’s the thing,” Agnes said as she served the dessert, a delicious flakey, aromatic pastry with some crushed cherries and sweet and sour cream on top, a local dessert that tasted Heavenly, “Those days a group of villagers formed a team, armed themselves and killed all those kids in one go. Many of the mothers screamed so loud in anguish and distress when their beloved children were being taken away that their screams could be heard by the town across the lake. All of them were put inside a hut and the hut was burned to ashes. But who knows, maybe someone escaped, a few of them. Once in a decade an incident or two would happen when a tourist or traveler or a visitor would be found mauled to death and in the past a few young men and women committed suicide, for no good reason.”
The night before John was supposed to join Barts, Sherlock managed to outdo himself in creating an annoying situation for his housemate. He began to play the violin at 2am.
“I shall take care of that.”
It was supposed to be a quickie and it sure was, but the results were blinding. Both men nearly lost their five senses as their orgasm shuddered through them and Jim punched the closed window a few times, head turning from side to side in ecstasy. His legs were in the air, his fingers digging into the older man’s skin, his pale skin flushed crimson as Mycroft heaved and moved over him.
“I’ve been working with him a while now,” Pierre said, softening his approach slightly, “If you’re okay maybe I can…. I mean, we can formulate some strategy together. You don’t have to talk to him for anything and everything. You’re on your own now and Mr. Lestrade always had a lot of faith on your judgment.”
He couldn’t tell them ‘I tested it on my boyfriend’, could he?
When he emerged from the room, showered and in fresh clothes (he noticed that John had kept all the items he had left behind when he’d hurriedly packed and left half a year ago), the first face he ran into was Mary Morstan Warwick.
He’s hateful.
John groans around his cock and that sound pushes him down and he’s falling, his muscles tight, eyes closed. He feels as if the time has stopped suddenly, there can’t possibly be anything more than this sensation, relaxing his body, soothing his nerves.
Sherlock tries to swallow, but his mouth goes completely dry.
He’s pathetic, he knows.
, he thinks.
When he gets out at King’s Cross, it’s almost noon. He buys a sandwich in one of the fast food restaurants at the station and puts it into his bag, and then takes the lift down to the underground.
"Sherlock—”
He thinks about Tantalus. Sentenced by the Gods to endless hunger while surrounded by fruit and eternal thirst while knee deep in water. Every time Tantalus almost reached the fruit, it drifted a centimetre away from his hand, and every time he bent down to take a sip of water, the riptide blew it away from him.
, but he didn’t say that. He honestly can’t remember which lie provided by his mind he agreed with; in the end, it doesn’t matter. John was too furious to actually listen, and Sherlock will remain the only person who knows the truth.
Mrs. Hudson greets him with a hug and it’s clear she’s worried and she’s been crying, for four nights at least, probably not in a row but is that even relevant? Sherlock takes a deeper breath when her arms embrace him and she tries shoving them into the kitchen for some tea and “herbal soothers” for Sherlock, but John politely explains that Sherlock should probably rest now and she lets them go upstairs.
He lies to himself that this is better for both of them. He even starts to believe it.
A month passes. Sherlock knows the exact date, hours and minutes, when he saw John for the last time.
Sherlock looked away. John can’t remember when.
All the words are stuck in Sherlock’s throat. He just watches John breathe heavily, not allowing himself to look away, not allowing himself to surrender this time. John’s eyes skim his face and Sherlock raises his hand, putting it on his chest, right below his heart — in the place where he still bears the bullet-shaped scar. John lowers his gaze and Sherlock can pinpoint the exact moment when John’s face softens that he realises what exactly Sherlock is doing. His eyes meet Sherlock’s once again, that never left his, and John opens his mouth but this time Sherlock doesn’t even let him begin.
Lestrade looks at him carefully.
“You’re married,” he forces himself to say it, to take the burden off this moment; his voice is barely audible even in the absolute silence of the night.
Sherlock doesn’t move. He sits on the edge of the bed completely naked, embracing his knees with his arms. He feels John moving closer, feels the heat of his body, and then arms embracing him from behind and a delicate kiss on the nape of his neck. He takes a deeper breath and turns around, meeting John’s lips. John moves back, not daring to stop the kiss, and slowly rolls onto his back so that Sherlock is on top of him. Sherlock places a few short kisses on his lips and then draws back a little. John runs his hand down his face, strokes his hair, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. When he puts the hand down, Sherlock lies down next to him, snuggling him. John hugs him with his arm, pulling him a bit closer. Sherlock closes his eyes as John’s thumb caresses his skin.
He solves the case. He doesn’t even tell his own brain to shut up that often. It all turns out to be fake, but Sherlock can’t force himself to care, even in the slightest.
John has absolutely no idea about it.
There’s only so much damage you can do.
Barely does he wonder why all of a sudden
“I cleaned up your bedroom. Tea’s in the kitchen.”
At night, Sherlock often reaches for the gun hidden in the closet’s drawer. In most cases, he doesn’t shoot it; he’s too tired of explaining to Mrs. Hudson why there are constantly more and more holes in the wall. Most often, he only tightens his fingers around the cold handle of the gun. Most often, he only checks if it would fit his hand.
“Of course I would, John,” he chokes. “I’ve never wanted anything or anyone else.”
Lestrade phones him a week after he came back, asking for his help with a case that the Yard can’t work out. From what Sherlock hears it is a trivial case, yet he agrees to come anyway: quite possibly only out of habit.
Mary had said she’ll
. Of course, she will. When the first shock is over, John will accept his apology, whichever Sherlock offers, and everything will be back to how it used to be.
Sherlock lets out a broken gasp and grips John’s face in both his hands, crushing their mouths together. John lets him dominate the kiss, to take whatever reassurance Sherlock needed from it. When they move apart, there’s no more subtlety in Sherlock’s gaze — now it’s filled solely with desire.
One month and six days. One month and six days until John is
"Well, be careful what you wish for,” he says, letting the tears stream down his face. "If I hadn’t come back, you wouldn’t be standing there and— you’d still have a future… with Mary.”
He remembers how a few weeks after he “came back to life”, when John was still not talking to him and he was spending the days lying motionlessly on the sofa, Mycroft asked him how
“Who’s done this to you?”
do whatever you want and that’s how you got in this state. You’re going to stay in your bed, eat the fucking soup, drink tea and rest. Your heart might not make it through third cardiac arrest.”
“We’re leaving.” His voice stifles the rain ringing loudly against the window.
“Then take me. Take all of me. I’m yours, John. Always yours.”
“I’ve only just moved in!”
, John, John, John… He sees the bonfire and it must be it.
Lestrade stands there, dumbfounded, as Sherlock leaves before the man composes himself to reply.
"It’s not too late yet. Do something so you won’t regret it later.” Then she’s gone.
For a long moment neither of them says anything and they just look at each other. John sighs and Sherlock takes it as an incentive.
Sherlock steps back, looking away.
“Tell you what?”
, that’s the established order which, maybe, he shouldn’t have disrupted.
"Not really in the picture anymore.”
Sherlock opens his mouth.
There can’t be multiple chances and there are no coincidences.
“What pregnancy matter?”
"Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I’m capable. John—” He cuts off, trying to compose himself. "You sit between the two people that love you most in all this world. And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say I will never let you down and I have a lifetime ahead to prove it, although I will probably never deserve you in my life, no matter what I do.”
Sherlock wakes up in the morning in an empty bed and knows something has been decided.
He arrives at Baker St. a couple of minutes before 1 p.m. Walking to the 221 building, he passes, it seems, the people he knows, but all of them are hidden behind huge hoods or umbrellas, and that’s why he doesn’t worry about the looks they give him. Sherlock’s voice (
He passes next to John sitting in his chair and as soon as he does, he hears John put away his newspaper.
, his brain hints, but it’s oh so irrelevant. He leans his back on the kitchen counter, taking advantage of the height difference. Fooling himself with the seeming dominance.
“Americans want her back. Extradition is imminent and, I’m afraid, unstoppable,” Mycroft says without an ounce of sympathy.
know.
Suddenly, it seems completely quiet. Mute raindrops stream down the car’s windows, they pass people without a word. He can only hear Sherlock’s breath next to him, quiet and smooth; he listens to that rhythm, loses himself in it. Only the touch of a still damp hand on his shoulder gets him out of this trance. John gets out of the car and follows Sherlock. Before he enters the crime scene, he stops, closes his eyes and takes a few deep breaths. He feels Sherlock is waiting for him, standing still and most probably watching him. He swallows, meets Sherlock’s gaze and nods, letting him know he’s ready.
Gregory appears at their flat often; maybe even every week. Mostly he just presents them the old cases, as if trying to get the most out of Sherlock’s temporal good mood. Sometimes Lestrade takes Sherlock back and tells him something shortly and intently; Sherlock never replies. At first John was surprised by Inspector’s behaviour because before there never were things that only regarded Sherlock and couldn’t regard him as well. Although he supposes many things have changed since his marriage.
ends just now.
Sherlock doesn’t even want to think about how utterly unaware of everything John is.
. Sherlock doesn’t ask.
“I didn’t know the pregnancy was fake,” Sherlock says slowly and his voice is husky and broken, but he doesn’t care. “I—I’m sorry, John.” He swallows and looks up at him. “I was just trying to protect you.”
It feels like the midday sun burning your skin. Or like lying down on the grass in the middle of nowhere, not a single street lamp in sight, and watching the night star-studded sky. It’s like the perfect alignment of all the planets. Like total eclipse, once in a lifetime. Inevitable and unforgettable, unchangeable. Incomparable to anything else.
“You have.” Mycroft raises an eyebrow. “I’m not interested.”
, goes through Sherlock’s brain, but John speaks before he’s able to deduce more.
he hears Mycroft’s voice say in his head.
“You’re done here,” John whispers sharply, and though Sherlock wants to protest, he follows John out to the corridor. “Jesus, Sherlock,” he says after Sherlock closed the door. “Sometimes I wonder if you don’t just do it on purpose.”
John hangs up. Sherlock reaches for his secret cigarette supplies. He opens the window and lights the first one, not thinking about anything. He puts it out and immediately reaches for another.
Before they leave, John goes down to say goodbye to Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock moves John’s red chair back into his bedroom. His thoughts are unbearably light; they’re empty.
John loses his breath when it’s Sherlock’s turn to examine his body with his lips. His eyes close automatically when Sherlock goes down to his jaw and neck; he doesn’t stop and soon falls down to his knees in front of him, embracing him, pressing his face to the soft fabric of John’s jumper, just breathing in his scent. John softly runs his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, waiting for Sherlock’s heart to calm down.
Sherlock always thought about how paradoxically easy it would be for Tantalus to just bite off his tongue, to bleed out and die. He could do the same. He could overdose, shoot himself, drown, there are thousands of ways. He doesn’t know why he’s behaving so irrationally, why he continues to suffer when the only logical solution is to just let it end.
He places the empty cup in the sink. He’ll have to come back here in a couple of minutes, having realised that Mary will no longer put it into the dishwasher for him; that once again, he will have to be the responsible one. For now, he walks twelve steps up.
John appears on the doorstep and, God, he looks so
ever happened between them.
There is no literal translation in English. Sherlock can’t think of one word to describe it, at least.
He stands on his tiptoes and their mouths touch once again, at first slowly and tentatively, only learning one another, but when Sherlock clenches his hands on his jumper, pulling him closer, John tangles his fingers in his curly hair and kisses him harder. Sherlock parts his lips, letting John’s tongue inside, farther and farther in. Their tongues finally meet, tantalising each other, and John deepens the kiss.
“That was amazing,” John says, trying to catch his breath when they both climb up to 221B Baker Street. Sherlock leans his back against the wall and breathes heavily, tilting his head back and smiling broadly. John brushes his hair, still damp from the rain outside. There is perfect silence between them. The darkness of the night is only lit by the glow coming through the half-open door to the corridor. John shakes his head, smiling to himself. Sherlock falls down on the couch and John, not thinking about it, sits down next to him. Their knees brush lightly, but neither of them does anything about it. John stretches out his arm across the back of the sofa. It’s almost as if he was embracing Sherlock. “Just amazing,” he repeats, more quietly.
“And this is why you went through all this trouble to come here? You really have to be unbearably lonely.”
do you mean?” Sherlock asks irritably.
"If anyone has reason for these two not to wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.”
“I think…” John begins. His voice croaks and he has to clear his throat before he’s able to say anything. “I think what I’d want to tell her. Mary. I was thinking about it and…” He cuts off.
Maybe John takes him to bed. Maybe he kisses his naked, vulnerable body – which in that moment is already his, and maybe he notices his scars and with a wordless
“No, Sherlock,” John steps closer to his bed. “Everyone always
“And wouldn’t that be convenient,” Sherlock murmurs to himself.
With hindsight, Sherlock knows he should have been more careful. But he hasn’t slept for three days and threw up yesterday’s dinner. Putting on his dressing gown after shower is honestly the last thing he could possibly worry about.
While kissing, thirty-four facial muscles contract.
The room looks exactly like it did the last time he was here. For a moment he has a surreal feeling, as if nothing has changed throughout all these years. As if he’d come back after a week abroad, after a long day at work, after a walk. The hard cold metal ring he wears on his finger quickly reminds him it is only a delusion. He closes his eyelids for a moment, taking a few deeper breaths, and then comes down to the kitchen, washes the cup and goes to the living room. Sherlock stands still facing the window, holding the forgotten violin in his hand.
He leaves with a “I have to go back home” and Sherlock tries not to think when Baker Street – when Sherlock – stopped being home for John.
Sherlock smiles blankly, knowing fine well John will see through that fake smile. He takes his cup of coffee and leaves the room.
. His heart starts pounding in his chest faster than it should but he has no time to think about it. He clears his throat.
He doesn’t say a word about it. He suspects John thinks he didn’t notice. Sherlock never corrects him from that mistake.
Eight months. Eight months, more or less, that’s what he’s got left. He knows that if he doesn’t let him go now, he’ll only make all
All that matters is that John is back at Baker Street, even if only temporarily. The universal order has been restored.
“You went into cardiac arrest, again. It was hypoglycaemia caused by malnutrition and lack of—“ he cuts off, running his hand over his face. “Why did you try to hide from me that you were in such a bad state, Sherlock? I’m a doctor, I could have helped—“
John takes Sherlock’s hands into his and helps him stand up. Their lips are again next each other, but this time John teases him first with a warm breath right next to Sherlock’s parted lips, this time he touches their lips lightly only to draw away a second later, to make Sherlock look for him, finally letting Sherlock’s deeper. Not stopping the kiss, John slides his hands down Sherlock’s chest and undoes the first button of his black shirt. Sherlock finishes the kiss but doesn’t move away; despite that John raises his gaze in an unspoken question. Sherlock meets his eyes and nods once to confirm whatever John is asking, observing as John undoes another button. Sherlock straightens his shoulders, allowing the shirt to fall down off his arms to the ground. For a moment John is unable to move and only examines Sherlock’s pale body with his eyes, and Sherlock doesn’t do anything either to break this moment. John raises his hand, breathing shallowly through his mouth, and moves his finger down the long line of his collarbone, encircles his left nipple and stops by the roundly shaped scar, a bit paler than the rest of his skin. Sherlock takes a sharp breath as John’s finger moves around it slowly. John doesn’t touch it; instead he raises his head, kissing Sherlock’s lips again shortly, and then places a delicate kiss on the scar, feeling how Sherlock shivers under his touch. John kisses him again, kisses him until Sherlock stops shivering. Only then does he take Sherlock’s hands in his and leads him to Sherlock’s bedroom.
didn’t you tell me?” John’s voice is hoarse.
Sometimes Sherlock wishes he really had died on that rooftop.
“I can inform him, of course. But I thought that probably, you’ll want to do it on your own terms. And perhaps you could finally shed some light on the pregnancy matter.”
"Have dinner?”
“I shall be going. I’ll show myself out, don’t get up.” And then Mycroft’s gone.
Not all his dreams are of John. Sometimes he sees Magnussen in them, well-alive-and-still-watching-him Magnussen with a huge hole in his forehead where the bullet went through. He never says anything but his gaze never leaves Sherlock, slicing his skin inch by inch until all Sherlock can do is beg to wake up.
“Let me come through, John,” he says quietly so that John can’t hear his voice is weak and unsteady.
, why would anyone else?! Brilliant!” he finishes and once again they’re so close their faces almost touch.
After a two weeks Gregory calls him again, and this time, before he follows, Sherlock texts Molly Hooper. It’s the first person that comes to his mind, besides: it’s not like he has much choice.
He’s know he’s pathetic. But when he looks at John, he realises that John is probably the only person in the whole universe that
”I gave the speech, solved the murder, did everything I was supposed to do, therefore I did not see the point in staying any longer,” Sherlock lies smoothly. He knows John will believe him.
“Does John know?” he asks bluntly.
Mycroft finds him lying down on the sofa. He’s barely moved for a week. For the sake of Mrs. Hudson Sherlock pretends there’s nothing to do, no kidnappings or murders, and it seems the woman prefers this lie to the truth.
“Method!” John repeats, louder. Sherlock wants to step farther away, but his back hits the wall. “Not everything is based on your goddamn methods! Especially when you’re working with actual people, you know!”
God, John.
“Thank you.”
It’s Mycroft who tells John, in the end. Sherlock tried putting a speech up in his mind, something he could tell John to somehow make it all right, but he just couldn’t. Nothing he could say will make this right.
John comes closer and if he only took one step farther, Sherlock could have touched him, could have dived into his lips or wrap his arms around his waist and never let him go, but John doesn’t step any closer so Sherlock stands still.
“—cares about is himself!” he continues louder and louder, stepping closer to Sherlock.
His scarred back, that’s what John’s asking about.
Mycroft is quiet for a while.
“How could you
He pulls the jacket’s hood up and goes to the bus stop. It’s quiet, dark and hollow – there isn’t a single person out as he walks. He waits at the bus stop for 23 minutes (it doesn’t matter) until one of the suburban buses arrives. John takes his suitcase and gets onto it, brushing his wet hair with a cold hand. He sits at the back of the bus, fixing his eyes on the window, not really looking at the passing view. Fields and houses sneak between one blink and another, and John finally relaxes his fists.
"Lestrade.” He frowns.
“I see your dwelling in self-pity is going great.”
"Of course I agree, John,” he replies after a while. "It would be an honour.”
It’s really too damn easy.
“Don’t say that, John—” Sherlock says quietly, but John doesn’t let himself be interrupted.
John pulls him into his arms and Sherlock rests his head on John’s chest, closing his eyes and breathing in his scent. He can actually feel John’s heartbeat.
Soon, he lets himself go.
He stops the motorbike; he takes Mary with him. During the ride she keeps showing him the messages, but it doesn’t matter. All his thoughts revolve around John,
John meets his eyes and Sherlock notices something in John is breaking.
“John…”
Sherlock spits at the irony of her words. He regrets every second even though he knows it makes no sense. He’d turn back time and bleed out in front of John just to show him he’d do everything for him, but it would all end up here anyway.
John shook his head resolutely, deciding not to let his guard down, “I feel just as weirded out by what I just did but I’d be damned if we don’t take the step we’ve discussed and debated all night about. People have been dying Seb, we can surely take a couple of days off romancing and enjoying ourselves and take a proper step towards….. I don’t know what it will be but I need to be sure. And I know for a fact that you need to be sure too. Don’t you want to be able to sleep easy at night knowing our men are normal, that we can spend a lifetime with them without regrets???”
“The name’s Sherlock,” the young man said, voice steady and confident, “I don’t go by William, so just call me Sherlock.”
“Oh God, please help us!” Molly whined.
“Shut the fuck up.”
The New Beckett village and the lake surrounding it is now free of the curse. People’s memories are short. Soon all those deaths and attacks, which were attributed to that of some wild animal, would be gracing the pages history.
during sex.”
“So then why are you talking about is Irene? I assume you mean Anthea and Molly, why didn’t they mention anything about it to me? I had breakfast with you Anthea and I did check on Molly when she reported she was unwell and would stay in bed today. They said nothing.”
“You are absolutely right. I’ll go home and fetch something.”
That was when I realized he wasn’t joking or teasing or mocking me. He never said anything about sex once we were done with sex, strange as it might sound. He preferred for sex to be this unspoken, undisclosed, undiscussed topic between us, almost as if talking about it would jinx it in some way. Anyways, when he said he enjoyed the fellatio I did feel flattered enough to forgive him his earlier offense and pay him full attention. “You know my dear Watson,” he lit up his pipe and pulled the blanket over his feet, which had begun to get cold, “Some weapons can be easily devised, like one can break a glass and use a shard to stab somebody, there are other weapons that could be improvised from their original shape. Like this candy cane!”
He had no idea someone saw him leave from a distance.
“Julia,” Mycroft picked her up and carried her back upslope while Greg took off his coat and covered her, “Julia, what happened to you? What’s the matter girl, speak up! Where is your boyfriend, where is Redmond, which way did he go?”
“I love the way you call out my name,” John said as he nuzzled Sherlock’s pubes, all the while as he slicked up his own cock and added a dollop to the now-open and relaxed hole, “I want to hear it when you cum, with my cock buried deep inside you!”
“Johnny the man,” Mike Stamford greeted John cheerfully as the former army doctor entered the now empty autopsy lab to meet his former college mate and current referee. Well, the lab was almost empty. One nurse was still there and she gave John a pointed look as she left.
Night time brought a new problem. They had been assigned only one bedroom but Sherlock didn’t seem to keen to share the bed that night. By then John was so upset with himself, so tense and nervous about his future with his housemate, that he took his ire out on Sherlock.
“Hnnnn, pleeeease!”
“We went through the data by day and client by client, matching previous and next photos…. I mean ‘before and after’. You see, Photoshop and Adobe editors, several other software can be used to manipulate photographs and sometimes people pay us handsomely to do so. For example this one where the couple wanted their wedding photo to look like they were standing atop the Mount Everest. Another one where a young man wanted his dad’s pic inserted in his graduation photo.”
“Famous Hungarian playboy and bestselling author, Előd Toth wrote this book. This was released in the nineties – The Pragmatist and the Adventurous. Very popular with people aged between twenty and sixty. It outlines such methods of seduction on page 240, for married folks as well as single’s. Read it, you will get some tips and tricks to help you along.”
John was about to wrap up for the day when the sound of a soft, sweet voice made him look up from his briefcase. A redhead, petite and slender, with big green eyes stood there, holding a gift package in her arms. “Yes?” He asked pleasantly.
Sherlock looked a bit perplexed. “He owns a hamlet? I mean, what is this property actually? I thought it would be a mansion and vast, expansive grounds.”
“No, no, no,” Jim held his sides and laughed on while Sherlock waited impatiently, tapping his foot on the floor, “Ooooh, the delusions of grandeur you have Sherlock! I was laughing at the fact that you think we are in a relationship!!!”
Sherlock shook his head, “Wasteful expenditure. I need that money for other reasons.”
“No, I am serious. I was doing an animal profiling. Jim is a spider, can also pass off as a fox. Sebastian is a tiger, sometimes a panther. You are a wolf at times and a hedgehog the next. Mycroft of course is a panda, no two words about that…..”
“Yeaaaah?”
At any other point in time John would have groaned with frustration, letting himself get crushed by defeatist thoughts, but this was John rebooted, the new John 2.0 and an improvised version. He could easily handle the likes of a Phillip Andersen and swallow that obnoxious pretentious idiot with his breakfast tea. “Oh damn,” Sherlock huffed, “How did he show up here? Oh I forgot, last night he was here, waiting in my house for me.”
“Is this your grandfather’s omega?”
Sherlock blinked, “For sex?”
To John’s shock, the only answer he got was a trembling Sherlock suddenly clinging to him, all emotional and speechless.
“And dumb,” Greg Lestrade scoffed, “Neither is even a graduate. They work in places which would give them a rough edge and we don’t have time to smoothen them out. One has a dad who is in jail and the other still identifies as straight and calls himself gay for pay. Not to mention he has worked in the porn industry, even if it’s just two or three odd short films. This one is the best. Honestly, if I didn’t know he was an orphan and had no one in this world, I’d have thought he’s definitely from an educated, affluent and cultured family.”
They made excuses in their heads about this nonchalance.
“Oh Mrs. Chakraborty?”
Sherlock woke him again sometime later on the same night. This time John was a bit irritated and turned the bedside light on, checking the time on the digital alarm-clock he always kept on the nightstand. “Christ Sherlock, it’s only four-thirty am. What’s gotten into you?”
Mycroft seemed a bit perplexed, “You are doing
John woke up feeling so refreshed it seemed like he had been reborn overnight. The sun was shining and the room was nice and warm, breezy and comfy. He was not sure exactly when he’d fallen asleep but it felt so amazingly good to have finally got some rest, whatever number of hours they were, that he knew he was ready to take on the world again. He sat up, rubbing his eyes and smiling, temporarily in the same happy head space he inhabited until a few days earlier. He reached out to the other side of the bed, “Sherl, wake up, I think we might have overslept….I have definitely overslept…..”
“Yeah, just that way, oh fuck-fuck!”
Not for money, but because John was a much better human being, a man he truly respected and adored.
“Darling not like this,” John kissed his neck.
“Of course. That’s my duty and honor as a doctor.”
“Theater or play instead?”
“You want me to change my mind?”
As Sherlock said those words, he began to realize he really meant them. No longer was he acting or putting on some pretenses. The feelings he had earlier for Jim were shifting towards John and John had indeed turned out to be someone completely different from what he had expected. Not the grumpy, reclusive, money-minded, brusque, conniving billionaire but a real man with real problems and insecurities. He tightened his hold over John and said, “What do you want to do then? Is there something you really wish to do? If so, what is holding you back Jawn? Maybe we can iron out those impediments together. I know I am young, I have no clue about your past and how to act in a world you inhabit…. But at least I can offer moral support without biases and prejudices.”
No one looks like that in a house where someone had just passed away and where people are supposed to be in deep mourning. This is about something else.
As one of my friends here stated, John is about to grow a pair of them between his legs....
“I just hope Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t be offended,” Molly said, stifling a giggle, “After all we are not in an inn. At the inn they allow you to be out until midnight but I think Hudson’s Casa has an earlier deadline.”
While she always knocked politely on Magnussen’s door and waited for his permission to enter and at least made a customary knock on Mike’s door before entering quietly, with John she was a lot more casual and nonchalant. Her entry made a great clattering sound. She had opened the door way too hard, as she often did whenever she came to his cabin. It had hit the wall behind, making the hinges and the good luck charm hanging on the wood rattle. “Jesus Marlene, I have asked you several times about knocking before you enter my cabin,” John objected, a bit offended at the start he got when his nerves were already jarred, “If you can’t do that, at least try and keep it down. You are entering an open door, you don’t have to act like you gotta break through it.”
“Good. Good that you accepted it. It means you will be at peace.”
“Well, they will be paid very well. So they better ‘play’ the part to perfection.”
Precisely at that moment there was a text on John’s phone. The good doctor, still a bit shaken from the incident, looked at the text and read it out aloud. ‘Bubble and squeak stands for Sherlock’s bubble-butt and Johnny boi’s squeaky fucks as he plays in his own spunk – JM’.
“No, we can’t keep doing that,” John said firmly, “Now use the toilet. I am right here.”
Phil made a noise at the back of his throat but couldn’t get the words out yet.
The old man and several others intervened as they started to beat up John mercilessly but despite the whole effort, they dragged John away from there and shut him up in what was called ‘Black Box’, a cell that had a small pigeonhole and nothing else, a twenty by twenty room where offenders were locked in for 24 hours, without food or water. “Not again,” one of the men whispered into the old man’s ears, “Craig, this is the third time in two weeks. Does this man have a death-wish, huh?”
A huge panther jumped on the hapless man trying to bolt the kitchen door and tore him to pieces before their panic-stricken eyes. For a while everyone was shell-shocked and couldn’t react but as the beast finished and looked up from its ‘kill’, its green and orange eyes shooting sparks in the darkness and chilling them to the bone, the remaining five men gasped and shouted and tried to bolt from the scene. As one opened the front door, another panther crept in, making the entire group back off in fear. Two beasts stalked them at once, from either side, cutting off all chances of escape. Irene was so scared she couldn’t get a word out, her lips moved and her teeth chattered but she remained mute as ever, staring wide eyed at the horrific spectacle before her.
Unbeknownst to him, Sherlock was just as charmed by him as he was.
The true reason was – He wanted to meet and greet Santa that night.
Sherlock receives a rather ominous warning
“No, no, no, I am not,” John hurriedly slid downwards and started licking Sherlock’s opening.
“Between you and me, you could renegotiate the terms in a few months, ask for a bit more.”
“Do you know what John went through? You don’t know his side of the story. Let me tell you bits and pieces of it, at least. After you left he had a nervous breakdown, an attack of anxiety that got him straight to the hospital for a whole week. After that he was in rehab for a month but he ran away from it and attempted suicide. Back in the hospital for a fortnight and then he was committed.”
“Please Jawn, take me in your mouth and suck my brains out through my cock.”
“Sherl, you’re asking me to marry you?”
“Oh John, what would he or I do without you?”
The next day John left for a business trip. It was to last three days and before leaving he told Sherlock very clearly that the moment he returned, he intended to meet Sherlock’s family as well as call his lawyer and organize a new will and some legal transfer papers to a few properties. Nothing Sherlock could say or plead made a difference to him. He was totally determined to do this.
“Now you may wanna ask why they can’t increase the number of people at the station,” Jim cracked up with laughter and Sally and Phil, taken aback, quickly mumbled their goodbyes and rushed into their vehicle. Greg appreciated the joke and winked at Jim, “Always ready with a cutting edge response eh Jim? Well, the reason we aren’t more in number is because we have, for the past thirty five years, managed with these numbers. From the time my dad Gordon was the inspector to the time that I am.”
Lucy got a bit frightened, “Sir?”
“It’s a center piece of a heavy and priceless necklace I once owned. I was not always a penniless widow you see, my husband was a Baronet and my family had connections with earls and wealthy Jewish bank owners. Even a Russian oligarch was a regular at our place. It was this oligarch who ran into bad times post WWII and took a loan from us. When he couldn’t pay off he gave the necklace.”
The third door led to a less formal entertainment room. There was a pool table in the middle, a large wet bar in one corner which was lined with half a dozen bar stools, a ping pong table on the opposite corner, a couple of PlayStation, plus some lounge chairs and low tables. Clearly it was a boys’ room and playing pool all by himself was a handsome man in his early forties. Tanned and toned, with slight streaks of silver in his otherwise neat and closely cropped head of hair, he had the looks of a sexy silver fox. Accompanying him were two women, one was holding his drink for him while the other took notes on her iPad.
"I'm sorry, love," he murmured, and threaded his fingers through Sherlock's curls, a habit for which Sherlock had always had a weakness. John liked to grumble at him about his hair — it had mostly turned a sort of iron-grey, but Sherlock still had all of his, whilst John's had noticeably thinned and was nearly white now. Unlike John, Sherlock didn't mind; it was also finer and softer than his own, and he liked to feel it brushing against his shoulder in the mornings.
John stirs and pushes himself up on his hands over Sherlock.  He can see the thoughts flickering behind John’s eyes like a burgeoning candle flame, going from confusion to satisfaction to what looks like joy.
John has never hurt him. Sherlock gives his assent.
Sherlock saved the EEG in his mind palace, in the annex that belongs to John. When he needs to sleep and can’t, he traces the peaks and troughs with his mind until they blur into a single wave that pulls him under.
He’d asked Mycroft to keep the papers away from John, but Mycroft refused, saying it was necessary to avoid suspicion. Sherlock can’t decide whether he hates his brother more for refusing, or for being right. For his own part, he’s finding it more and more difficult to do what is necessary, in light of the fact that the cost of such necessity is becoming higher and higher every day.
Sherlock has never been particularly attached to his dwellings, but it’s difficult to leave 221B when the time comes. He was content here, even happy. There are memories stored in every corner, every case file, every bit of damaged wallpaper. He studied John here, left and was left by him here, and he fell in love with him here, which Sherlock can finally admit to himself since it won’t matter for much longer.
want to — "
John is standing behind her, unnoticed by anyone else. He’s sneering, which is incongruous on him and makes him look more like Sherlock than he would have thought possible. Sherlock suppresses a shudder.
It's worse than the cocaine. Synthetic opiates are a pale shadow of it, can't hold a candle to the intensity of its nuclear immolation. All those years of wanton self-destruction, and in the end, it will be selflessness that kills him.
John could be in any one of these abandoned buildings with a killer who ambushes his victims from behind, and Sherlock has to find him first, he has to
The honey-strained morning light brings with it the sight of smoke smudged against the sky like sooty fingerprints left by a malevolent hand. John stands stock-still at the window, staring.
Sherlock waits for days for a sixth body, but none is forthcoming. If the murders
They’re at a crime scene, with cautionary police tape strung across the entrance like a promise made to be broken, but Sherlock can’t stop watching John.  Objectively, John is quite ordinary-looking, but subjectively, to Sherlock, he’s beautiful—beautiful as the Fibonacci sequence, as Euler’s identity, as the sonorous curves of his violin.
“The victims are all people who threatened us at the pool that day, directly or indirectly. They were killed in the same manner and left where they could easily be found, suggesting that the killer wanted to make a point, possibly for symbolic reasons, more likely as a show of vengeance. The bodies all showed signs of extensive injury and possible torture before death, and the damage to their faces implies that their murders were deeply personal for the killer, probably either on behalf of himself or someone he loved. The murders escalated from henchmen to Moriarty himself, perhaps as a ranking of the victims’ perceived culpability. I had wondered whether there would be another body, although after the death of Moriarty, I—
do you want to share the bed?  And, well —
“For what?”
In his dreams, London
Sherlock makes an involuntary sound of disgust at John's terminology.
The world is ending, and London is burning, and it's such a beautiful day.
Even if it takes forever.
Looking at Sherlock is a new, enlightened experience now that John knows; it's like facing your doom and welcoming it with open arms.  It makes more sense this way, really.  It explains why John would kill (again) and die for this man, why watching him walk across a room is better than poetry, why Sherlock rearranged John’s life into the two epochs of Before and After.  Every furtive teenage glance at a boy was just preparation for this, for him.  It's better this way, cleaner, to stop pretending and living in denial, even if it never gets him anywhere.  At least he doesn't have to be torn in two anymore.
Sherlock's remaining bees work alongside him and keep busy, as bees do. He finds comfort in tending to them, and still more in tending to John. Sherlock smokes the hives and harvests the honey, thick and golden with promise, and feeds it to John, anoints him with it in bed. What they do there is much slower than in the days of their youth, not so much a combustion as a steady hearth fire, the warmth of home and love and John, summoning blood from the depths of him to burn his cheeks and heart and belly. Sherlock gently smoothes out every wrinkle like a sacred scroll, reverent in his worship, and kisses all of them, holy relics of the fact that John chose him, has stayed with him against all odds and, arguably, against common sense.
After Afghanistan, he couldn't write at all, therapist-assigned blog be damned.  He'd seen too many futures bleed out, including his own.  Most of the time, he just wanted to disappear like his life and career and purpose had.
Some days he almost wishes he weren't.  In this place, it’s a disadvantage more often than not.
"So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there.  It was easy then because there was always one true sentence that I knew or had seen or had heard someone say." — Ernest Hemingway
"Now, John," he said as John's giggles died down, "what shall we do about your costume?" Sherlock prowled in close to loom over him. "Those are some rather tight trousers. Will you need help getting them off?"
Los Angeles, New York, Paris: the world’s cities are flickering out like guttering candles, and London will be next.
“Good. Take me through what you’ve got so far.” John settles into his chair, puts his palms on the armrests, and waits for Sherlock to begin.
"Yes.  Well, and the data gathering aspect is also interesting.  Did you know your left shoulder is lower than your right by three centimetres?"
"I'd only get more sweets than you."
John is dead.
John’s eyes widen.  They are very dark and deep and boundless, like the North Sea at twilight.  Sherlock watches John’s quick breaths and the myriad emotions that flit across his wonderful, changeable face.  Time dilates, stretches and lengthens, because Sherlock’s heart is travelling at light speed and he cannot slow it down; it will either burst or implode waiting for John’s response, waiting for him to say—
John huffs his exasperated-but-secretly-fond sigh.  "You're impossible.  Well, if it's
Sherlock is still pondering this numerological approach when John coughs once, assertively, from across the room.
Sherlock nods a yes at John, one small dip of his chin. John smiles again, all teeth.
"A month, at most. Probably less."
"Hello, Ian. This is my husband, John." He will never get tired of saying those words; they give him a deathless thrill every time. "We're here to pick up his birthday present."
"For Halloween, John," Sherlock said in his most put-upon voice. "Obviously."
, stop John looking that way, stop causing him pain.
Sherlock does, and suddenly there's so little distance between them that he only has to dip his head to touch his forehead to John's. Their noses brush. Sherlock tilts into John's orbit like a drunken planet.
John would fit in here, with his weathered colouring and talent for survival. It would be second nature to him, camouflaged predator that he is.
After the third time his breathing shifts while watching John's shoulders move under his T-shirt as he makes tea, the threadbare fabric clinging lovingly to his trapezius muscles, Sherlock is willing to admit he has a problem.
He's stopped automatically correcting people who assume they're a couple.  He wonders if Sherlock notices.  Scratch that; he wonders what Sherlock thinks about it.
Sherlock shuts his eyes and tries not to think of the void.
Neurochemically, severed attachment is similar to the comedown after a high: decreased endorphin levels, dopamine deficiency, diminished activity in the nucleus accumbens. So it’s perfectly rational that he should feel this way, as though something is missing, because it is.
The fourth body belongs to one Sebastian Moran, mercenary, hit man, and a favourite of Moriarty’s, having gone so far as to help carry out the logistics of some of his ‘fixes.’
He watches one of Moriarty’s assassins bleed out in a field near the Appian Way and thinks that he is building a road of corpses back home, back to John: skulls for cobblestones and blood for mortar.
Sherlock turns his back on the fireplace and examines his map of Moriarty’s network. There are seventeen members left to track down and neutralise, and he estimates that this will take at least another six months. This seems like an unacceptably long time, but it cannot be helped.
Sherlock barks out a laugh at this, hoarse and raw. He sees Sally snap her head up at the sound, breaking off her latest argument with Lestrade. Sherlock knows what she’s thinking. He’s not even sure she’s wrong.
No. No, that’s not right. Perhaps it’s Sherlock who is dead. He can’t quite keep that straight, anymore.
They're in equilibrium with each other, a perfectly balanced equation.  Part of him is afraid to upset it, but another part wants to discover what product their reaction would produce. Probably an explosive one.
He wants to feel John breathing against him for the rest of their days, the warmth of John's skin welling up under his fingertips like the radiant heat of yellow suns, stellar birth in the depths of John's eyes every morning, nebulae in the linings of his lungs, gravity wells in the palms of his hands: Sherlock's own little pocket universe, safe against the tidal forces of destruction, or so he'd like to believe.
He feels, more than ever, as if the universe has disappointed him in some deep and unforgivable way, and not least because he can no longer resign himself to the disappointment. Before he met John, he had almost learnt to manage it, had put aside the cocaine and used the Work to mitigate his disgust at life. If he believed in such ridiculously unscientific concepts as karma, he would have called John his reward for good behaviour.
"Food is not unnecessary, Sherlock," John said, purely by reflex. He'd probably never get Sherlock to eat reasonably during a case, but he kept trying. As windmills went, it felt like a noble one to tilt at.
Sherlock, still sitting, looks up at John. He likes John like this, artificially tall from Sherlock’s perspective, towering over him even though he's short. It's a pleasing symmetry to the unsettling, sentimental truth that John towers over him in other, more important ways as well, blocking out almost everything else.
"Another hive is dead," he mumbled thickly, but John still understood him.
.  Sherlock can feel his trembling start to subside, and smell John's homey, woolly, gun-oil scent.  Most shockingly, Sherlock's brain is slowing down, not in an impaired way, but in a calm, clear, still-water sort of way that is so exceedingly rare he wasn't sure he was capable of it anymore, and certainly not naturally.  His mind hasn't been this uncluttered since he was small enough to be bundled into Mummy's arms when he was distressed.  He feels the last of the nervous tension leave his body, in remarkably short time, and quickly organises the remaining facts of the case in his mind palace while marvelling at how John is the perfect height to serve as a brace for Sherlock this way.  John holds on for a bit longer — it might be seconds or minutes — before patting Sherlock's back and letting go.
At the wedding, he’d learned how it felt to watch John leave him behind.  He knew they’d never go back to the way things had been, and he realised that that existence, with John, was actually all he wanted out of life, but his own actions had erased it forever.
"I might. Do you perhaps have any other . . . accessories to go with that costume? Isn't there meant to be a whip as well?"
" — so
wondered, though not in any way he’d ever act upon, whether John was special in any tangible, empirical way, any way that would explain why he was so endlessly fascinating when the rest of humanity was so irredeemably boring. But now John has offered, and it’s possible that this is still a dream, so looking can’t do any harm. Can it? No. Maybe. Probably not.
John grinned. "Never," he vowed, and kissed him again, gentle but with an edge of teeth. Sherlock held him in place by the hips and welcomed him in. His mouth was hot and seeking, and his broad chest was a bulwark against the wet damp of the alley. John deepened the kiss and slid his hands up Sherlock's neck and into his hair, dragging his fingertips against his scalp until Sherlock went almost limp against him, leaning his weight into John's body.
Lestrade soon arrived in a constellation of red and blue lights and hauled Kellerman away. Greg got in some good-natured mockery about their costumes in the process, which included taking a photo of Sherlock on his mobile before he could stop him, "for the Yard newsletter". Once he'd gone, the thunderous look left Sherlock's face, and he sloped off the wall and toward John, sleek and soundless as a cat. He kissed John, slow and heated, a fire stoked with promise of things to come.
He needs to be brave.
He thinks about it occasionally, between cases. When he's bored.
"Sherlock," John says softly, "it's all right.  Look, I'm fine.  Just some bruising; he knocked me against a skip and I fell, but it's not serious.  You checked me yourself.  What about you, though?  You're shaking.  Have you eaten today?"  John starts checking him over, running hands lightly over his sides and tilting his head up to check pupil dilation, and Sherlock breathes out in a rush.
"How long have we got, then?"
Sherlock cannot speak.
"Sherlock, um.  Why are you stroking my hair?"
He finally realises it at the wedding, and feels it after in a way not even the drugs can erase.  Chemical defect, human error, sentiment: the last great fall to which he thought he was immune.  But he has eliminated the impossible, so what remains must be the truth.  He is a scientist, and however terrifying the conclusion, he cannot bring himself to twist the data to his own ends.  So: he is in love with John.
“You were,” Sherlock blurts out, “you were with me all the time.  I mean—”
this weekend, you realise." Sherlock sighed his most martyred sigh.
He’s never said it, not properly, not to anyone.
"Happy birthday, John."
John has no illusions of grandeur about his writing, and he's no prose stylist, but he flatters himself that when he's really on, he at least communicates some of what it was like to be there.  He needs people to know how it feels to watch Sherlock's mind go off like a rocket, or to see him running through the gentrified wilds of Shoreditch, lovely and incongruous, silhouetted against the street art and far more beautiful than any of it, winded but still detouring on the way home to show John the sites of Jack the Ripper's murders.  It's almost blinding to look at him when he's like this, as joyful and delighted with himself as a little boy.
Spring arrives like an allied army. Wildflowers are massing in pinks and golds on the Downs, and the wisteria in their garden is climbing its trellis with florid determination. The orange trees are in bloom, and the honey this year will be the best yet. John will love it, will use it to make the honey cakes Sherlock covets, and will give him even more coveted praise for harvesting it.
Sherlock turns in John’s arms to recapture his mouth and flips them so John’s back is against the countertop.  He proceeds to break John down into his constituent parts just as thoroughly as he dreamed of doing, and John gives as good as he gets, sucking a mark onto Sherlock’s neck and stroking the small of his back, fingertips slipping below his waistband.  Sherlock makes a deeply appreciative sound at this and presses in even closer, but still not close enough.  He unbuttons John’s shirt and tugs it off, fumbling but reverent, and is rewarded by the sight of John’s chest suffused with a deep blush, all the blood in his skin rushing upwards to meet Sherlock’s questing mouth.  Sherlock kisses everywhere he can reach, skims the freckled tops of John’s shoulders with his mouth and learns the shape of his scar against his tongue.  He pulls back to press his fingertips gently, wonderingly against John’s flushed throat just to see the paleness appear and then disappear when the blood flows back in, rosy under his skin.  John takes Sherlock’s hand and kisses the pads of his fingers, the centre of his palm, the circumference of his wrist.  Sherlock watches, dumbstruck, as John’s lashes drop over his eyes in evident bliss, and he has to remind himself to breathe.
“Sherlock, it’s not— it’s not like that. I just need… I need more time. We both do.”
”Tea?”
fucking deserve to know, no. I didn’t deserve to know you were still alive after that faked suicide and I didn’t deserve to know my fucking wife is a trained assassin and now I don’t deserve to know my baby is—“ John breaks down and covers his eyes with his hand.
Sherlock doesn’t care about the metaphorical significance of this organ.
It’s like having his skin set ablaze. He burns himself up to give John light and the thing is: if given a choice, a chance to end this, he wouldn’t. In all pasts and presents and futures, he wouldn’t give up on John, even if not giving up means paying the highest price. He would pay it and burn his heart down over and over and over and over again for John.
patients. I am fine, you needn’t have worried. Just bring me my laptop and let me work.”
“Would it have made a difference?” Sherlock asks, looking into his eyes. “Tell me, John. Would me blatantly stating the obvious fact change a single thing?”
“Ah, yes, right. I forgot that all that
Sherlock spreads his arms, pointing at 221B.
Sherlock shakes his head, biting on his lower lip as he raises his eyes to meet John’s.
“You kept turning me down, Sherlock. You kept me in the dark after the wedding, you began working on your own. It was as if you were deliberately pushing me away.”
“Tell me what?!” John repeats almost shouting and turns around to face him. His eyes are burning with anger. “Maybe that you’re still using? Hm? Didn’t you think that information was worth sharing?”
“Uhm,” he clears his throat. “Yeah. Yes, I think.”
He has to remind himself a couple of times everyday that after all, this is why he faked his own suicide, this is why he gave up on everything he used to care about, this is why he sacrificed himself and backed away from his life for two years, this is why he let himself be tortured and beaten – so that John could be happy. With hindsight he knows that this has always been only half of the truth; but it doesn’t matter now.
They are trying to catch a murderer whom Sherlock tracked down based solely on his deductions. Sherlock runs first and John is right behind him, hearing only the sound of police sirens in the distance and the insane beat of his own heart. Another lit building passes before his eyes distorted; his gaze is focused on the tall figure in front of him, on the coat fluttering as he moves, on his windswept curls.
"So, John…?”
Sherlock shoots him an irritated look from the couch, not even bringing himself to the sitting position.
Sherlock leaves, passing him without a word or a single glance.
“What you’re
“I’ve never wanted anyone else,” John whispers into his ear. “I’ve never dreamt of anyone else. You’re my everything, Sherlock.”
In the morning, they don’t talk about it.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything but Lestrade must have read everything right from his face because he cuts off.
John tells him to lie down on the sofa and once again, Sherlock does what he’s told because he is too drained to be stubborn and he is too drained to argue and he will do it John’s way now, always John’s way. John brings him dinner and medication and Sherlock tries to sit up, but the movement must be too abrupt because the scar on his chest starts burning fiercely and he’s suddenly out of breath. John drops the plate and the mug on the coffee table and rushes to him, and holds his wrist and presses a hand to his forehead. When Sherlock finally catches his breath back again, John pushes him gently onto his back and crouches next to the sofa, still not letting go of his wrist.
"Any cases… George?”
John sits by the table holding a newspaper he immediately puts down the moment Sherlock enters the room.
They go on another case the next morning. John comes back to Baker Street with groceries to see Sherlock already fully dressed. Sherlock takes the shopping bags from him and puts them on the kitchen table, and then urges John to get ready. This time John doesn’t hesitate, even for one second.
. He doesn’t even look at Sherlock and goes straight to the kitchen to put the kettle on. A few seconds later Sherlock hears the sound of glass shattering.
"Till death do us part.”
“Mary,” Sherlock says without preamble as his brother enters the living room. “Something about Mary, isn’t it?” He sits up slowly, looking at Mycroft.
Sherlock closes his eyes and lets out a short sigh.
He leaves with a towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is dripping, water trickles down his face.
John slowly moves his finger on his lower lip; Sherlock doesn’t even dare to shiver. He holds his breath and looks straight into John’s eyes.
John grinned, “That we are but not all of us wanna force someone…..”
Now if he went back there, he’d lose his equilibrium.
Sherlock sat on the arm rest of the chair John was perched on, pressed up against him. “I don’t know but sometimes I feel all this is a dream too and one fine day I shall wake up and find you gone. It’s been picture perfect so far and we both know life cannot be perfect by any means.”
“Did you really mean it or was it something you said just to annoy your brother?”
“Mmmm…..”
“Who?”
“It’s going to be William Sherlock Scott Bouffler.”
The two women landed downstairs the same way, by riding the bannister and sliding down like kids would do. Noiselessly they went to the door and stood behind it, listening carefully.
Sherlock moaned out loud, arching his back and throwing a leg over John. John in turn gripped his shoulder and sucked a bruise on the marble like skin of his long neck. He had missed ruining inches of the most perfect skin with his teeth and tongue.
“Are they behind these…..???”
“Yeah. Look, I like your parents and this is my only chance of having a family around me.”
“Agrees on what?”
Jaw sweeping the floor, eyes like saucers, John watched in stunned silence as a marvel unfolded before his wide eyes. From the bed spread to the curtains, the rug to the color on the wall, the incandescent lighting and even the orchids displayed in vases of various shapes and colors, the room was now clean, airy, fragrant and colorful. It was in fact so vibrant that for a moment John felt like his seven year old self. Whenever he used to walk into his mum’s bedroom he always felt he was entering wonderland.
The haircut wasn’t the best and Sherlock felt John looked like a hobbit but he chose not to comment on it. It could be given a better shape later but for now this would have to do. He didn’t fancy looking at John that way, with shoulder length hair and split ends. The shave did wonders though, as did the bath, and when John got into clean PJs and sat on the bed, he looked almost like his former self. Maybe thinner and a gaunt face, bags under his eyes, but still fairly similar to what he used to be.
“I understand,” Greg smiled, “Take my car. And buy a new one after selling that scrapheap of yours.”
“You try not to be, but from what you’ve been saying it seems you do have some internalized homophobia. To figure out that source we will need to do proper sessions. I am not sure you really want that, do you?”
“I mean, I have known him a while…. It’s a couple of months, maybe less…..”
“I just
“Thanks Jawn.”
, Sherlock thought as he quickly made his way there. Nope, no luck there either. Amidst a sea of different faces he searched in vain for the one face he wanted to see, John’s. He saw a few blond mops here and there and eagerly craned his neck to look at those people, none of them turned out to be John.
“Jesus Phil,” Eva snapped, “You almost put that in my soup.”
Sherlock took a long moment to respond to that and when he did, only words straight from the heart came out. Clutching at John, tremors still shaking his willowy frame, his lips quivering and his eyes watery, he managed to gasp out the words that he knew to be the absolute truth.
Still there was a part of him which refused to believe this man. It was the affectionate elder sibling in him that kept making excuses on behalf of Sherlock and even Jim. He had known them all through their lives and never had he even once suspected they could be contaminated by a curse or be tainted in their behavior and character. For him they were little boys who could do no wrong. Yet there was a rational and responsible side of him which knew something was wrong. Those two were always suspiciously close to the events that had taken place. For example, he knew Sherlock returned home pretty late the previous night. He knew from enquiries with the innkeeper that Jim was there until very late
“We’ll look after your business, homes and of course you’ll be our friend when you’re out,” Sebastian said with a brave smile.
John looked rather handsome too. Suave and sexy in the combination of his fawn and dark brown suit with a cravat around his neck, he appeared like the typical genteel young man with refined manners and a solid education in a blue-chip school. Yet he didn’t appear pretentious, nor did it seem he was trying too hard like Sherlock was. He was a natural. With his dirty blond hairs, caramel brown eyes and that easy, sunny smile, he could easily fit into the guy next door category too, his confidence and poise making him appear taller, broader, almost like a stalwart. Sherlock felt lucky one moment and petrified the next. What if things didn’t go well? What if the Dame disapproved of him?
Jim stopped the car and got out. Sebastian stared in astonishment for a moment before he did the same.
“And the farm we wanted to buy here?”
“Date….I still remember,” Sherlock drawled, sounding sleepy and spent.
“Of course you did things personally. I can see it written plain and large on your face Superintendent! Anyways, do you think his…. I mean John’s amnesia case is really genuine?” Jim asked.
“Okie.”
century, not the
“That’s no problem at all,” he said happily, sending Sherlock off to fetch them from his bedroom, “You don’t need to wrap them in sparkling paper or pretty bows. None of us are ten-year-olds.” He quickly took out his own gifts and placed them underneath the tree, feeling a bit nervous. This was their first Christmas together, eleven months into this unique arrangement of living and solving cases together, and never before had he bought any gifts for his housemate. He thought he knew Sherlock well and all the gifts were things he would most definitely use…..still, he felt a bit nervous about the whole thing. What if Sherlock didn’t like any of them or laughed at them openly.
She said she was sending us dinner that night through a cousin who was in the area nearby and passed by Baker Street on her way home. In the background I distinctly heard daddy say, ‘Oh Eugenia, where did we go wrong’. I think they messed up the plumbing again.
“You are a man I can never be Seb,” John tried to explain, “A decorated military officer, an exemplary one who made to the rank of colonel in just nine years, a celebrated author and the poster child of alpha male community. You have made your own fortunes in the past few years, in both fame and currency, and I don’t think you ever need to beg anyone for cash again. Whatever I gave you in the past will never be brought up again, nor will I be talking about what we’re going to do today.”
“Hello mummy….hi, no, the invite stands. Have you started yet? No? Oh okay…great. Needed one small help really. I have managed everything here aside from the roasted chicken. Yes, the one you make with caramelized onion sauce, cashews and peas on the side. I tried but failed magnificently. No no, I am fine, not hurt. John is cleaning the kitchen after the mishap. Oh thank you mummy. But can you manage? Oh you can,
“Well, if we don’t help him soon we both shall be out of business and you might be in jail.”
“If you are not that into him…..tell him, okay?”
“Annoyed? Upset? Irritated?”
All warm and rosy from the kudos he had accumulated, the professional success and the newfound respect he’d acquired, John decided to pay a visit to Greg Lestrade at his loft apartment at a posh neighborhood in Chelsea. He wanted to share his success story with his guru, first and foremost.
Wow, the man was good looking, with a big presence and persona, very jovial and cheerful. There was something about him that was warm and reassuring. Sherlock started feeling emotional tugs inside him, like an unseen force was trying to draw him closer to the stranger.
John doesn’t turn the light on as he passes through the living room and to the stairs.
The grip on his arm tightens. John stands so close to him that their faces almost touch.
Sometimes that light seems even more real.
Sherlock tries to compose himself enough to say something, anything at all, but he can’t. All of the words are stuck in his throat, on his tongue, his mouth, but he can’t say them out loud. Mycroft’s smile faded somewhen but he can’t pinpoint when and now his brother is looking at him with clear worry in his eyes. Sherlock can’t bring himself to care.
John keeps quiet and Sherlock takes that as a confirmation. He does not dare to lift his head, to meet John’s eyes and show him his bleeding heart. He can’t.
“Oh for god’s sake, John, please,” Sherlock sighs, rolling his eyes. “Please save your pity for your
. Slowly, he comes closer and gets down on his knees in front of John. John doesn’t react, but he seems to sit a bit straighter, as if he was waiting for this move. Sherlock lowers his head, swallowing hard as he takes John’s shoes off, and then straightens up to help John take off his surely damp coat. But before he does it – their eyes lock and Sherlock freezes.
“You understood, didn’t you?” John says slowly, eventually. “You knew the dosage was potentially fatal. You—you
”And Mary’s,” Sherlock adds quietly. John looks at him. “Yours and Mary’s.”
Sherlock turns around from the window and for a moment, his eyes meet John’s. He reaches for his scarf and tangles it around his neck.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow.
He leaves to the kitchen and drinks the entire cup of tea. Sherlock must’ve prepared it before he had appeared on the doorstep. How he’d known at what time he’d arrive – John has no idea.
After three months of living together his presence still doesn’t wake John from his sleep. Sherlock, when he thinks about it, snaps at the astonishing kindness of the stars.
He’s not got long.
John sits next to the woman’s bed in the hospital room. Sherlock stands next to the exit door. His voice is strong and cold. He asks concrete, detailed questions, looking only at the woman, not caring about the looks John keeps shooting him, which he can feel from time to time on his skin.
John doesn’t stop kissing him as he pushes inside, slow now, careful with his movements. He leans back slightly, studying Sherlock’s face as he goes deeper.
passes inevitably through his mind, but the question is quickly smashed by the cold tone of Sherlock’s words.
”You’ve not called… for some time.” It takes all of his willpower not to shout right in his face the precise number of days he’s spent regretting the fact that he didn’t die then, three years ago, the precise number of hours he’s spent wondering what John was doing, the precise number of times he’s recalled every conversation they’ve had in his mind.
“Is that alright?” John asks quietly.
"Are you seeing him?”
John sits up and looks at him, furrowing his brows.
He follows Lestrade down the stairs, to the basement. The human skeleton sitting in a Shakespearean-like pose would have seemed to be a treasure trove full of mysteries to him. It ought to fascinate him.
Sherlock doesn’t know when or how, but he and John manage to fall back into their safe routine. John makes breakfasts and they spend the evenings together watching TV and it feels so wonderfully, devastatingly natural. Sherlock knows he shouldn’t get his hopes up but it’s just too difficult not to fall when John pushes him.
His lips wander up Sherlock’s neck, putting the first delicate kiss on it. Sherlock sucks in air rapidly when John’s lips mark his skin with other kisses, moving up, kissing his jaw, and at last finding his lips. John stops for a moment and only catches Sherlock’s lower lip between his lips, and then takes one step away, waiting for Sherlock to open his eyes, so John can see consent in them. Sherlock opens his eyes and for a moment John forgets how to breathe because he sees
all the time and there’s no self-loath and hatred and regret in him and it’s all—
John stops by the desk that Sherlock used to sit by during lazy Saturday mornings, listening to the sounds of John preparing breakfast in the kitchen, not thinking about anything in particular, just allowing himself to breathe in the domesticity.
“What
"It’s just to make you look good even though you’ve behaved like…” He breaks off. Sherlock folds his hands as if he was praying and shoots him a pleading look. "I just wanted you not to be dead.”
“Promise me, Sherlock.”
When he wakes up, it’s completely dark inside. He feels someone’s weight next to his body and notices John has fallen asleep sitting on the floor, head resting on his folded arms on the sofa.
“What do people have to do with this?”
“A case.”
“Oh.” Mycroft’s smile broadens. “You don’t know, do you?”
Gregory meets his eyes and doesn’t let go.
"No you didn’t.” John raises to his feet and hugs him, his hand touches Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock melts at his touch, just for a moment, because few seconds later John draws back, smiling.
John looks at him expectantly and Sherlock can’t bring himself to lie anymore, so he just embeds his thoughts into words.
John leaves, shooting him a bright smile. After the door closes behind him, Sherlock clenches his hands into fists and keeps hitting the wall until the purest physical pain overshadows his mind.
The next case is different. The next case is rape committed on the US ambassador’s daughter.
“And how should I know? I’ve never done this before.”
“You’re in deep, Sherlock.” Mycroft shakes his head, finally speaking. “Way too deep. Deeper than you’ve ever intended to be.”
Molly agrees. Sherlock suspects it’s mostly pity that drives her decision. He decides to brush it off of his mind.
Mrs. Hudson nods sadly, watching him carefully. They both know John isn’t going to ask, but the woman doesn’t say anything. Sherlock almost wants to thank her.
Silence falls between them. For a moment John stands still, allowing Sherlock’s eyes to examine and measure him, and then he nods slightly. Sherlock turns around and reaches for his violin. John has a feeling they both know that no words are needed.
Sherlock comments on the ignorance of the writers of the detective show they’ve been watching and when John smiles at him lightly, Sherlock hates the goosebumps that appear on his skin immediately after.
John doesn’t apologise. He brings Thai in takeaway boxes, asks about the cases, and Sherlock cuts himself only to answering the questions he’s asking.
off it. John, startled at first, quickly returns the kiss, clenching his hands on his coat, pulling him closer and closer, standing on his tiptoes to reach farther. And maybe after this first, feverish kiss John meets his eyes and kisses him again, and then it is a confirmation.
, how would we fill the time if you didn’t ask all those stupid, extraneous—” His voice is suddenly stuck in his throat and he can’t catch a breath. He tries holding onto the wall but it doesn’t support his weight anymore and he slides down to the floor. John’s next to him in a second.
The sun is starting to set, painting the sky in bright orange and pink, when he hears John’s slow, measured footsteps on the stairs. He tries to brace himself for whatever is coming.
"He’s getting married, for God’s sake.”
They break away only for short breaths, and their lips immediately try to find each other again, to merge into what seems to be a perfect whole.
“I’m sorry,” he says hoarsely.
"Okay, Scotland Yard, then.”
That would be it.
John moves his hands down Sherlock’s back, supporting Sherlock’s weight as he gets up with a small groan. Sherlock wraps his legs around John’s waist, careful with his head as John carries him to his—their—bedroom. They stumble onto the bed, with John still on top of him. John starts unbuttoning his shirt, kissing his lips softly, gently, as if they had all the time in the universe. Sherlock’s breath is lost in his chest, his heartbeat is in his throat, his thoughts spilling onto the floor, escaping in just one word:
“John,” he whispers and tries to open his eyes but God, he has never been more tired.
"I know,” he doesn’t even have to lie.
“YOU COULD HAVE DIED!” John screams at the top of his voice. Sherlock takes a step back without realising it until his back hits the door. “Don’t you understand?!”
Mycroft measures him with his eyes for a moment.
“Of course,” he says weakly, because that’s what John is expecting from him. “My congratulations to the both of you,” he adds, because that is probably a proper thing to do.
, after all.
Sherlock gets up abruptly, stepping onto the coffee table and then to his chair. Mycroft sits down in John’s chair.
Or maybe in every universe, including the one he’s been placed in, John leaves, and Sherlock is left alone.
John writes on his blog that Sherlock is
John wondering if maybe Sherlock has been there before. Neither of them speak of the matter, but it still weighs between them heavily.
John looks at him for too long and Sherlock’s smile fades away slowly, and he doesn’t dare to look away. For a spare of a second he notices a realisation of kind in John’s gaze, but the delusion becomes diluted when John turns away to look at Mary, and Sherlock remembers that John simply
Sherlock!” John raises his voice. ”I thought after everything that has been said—” He cuts off, breathing heavily. ”Okay, arguing in the middle of the street isn’t the wisest thing to do.”
“These,” Sherlock says flatly, “are just the side effects of my job. Utterly irrelevant.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath.
John goes tantalisingly, torturously slow, deep-throating him, then coming back to just licking the tip. Sherlock feels like a volcano that’s just about to erupt, feels it building up in him from his toes to the top of his head. He forces his eyes open and sees John looking up right at him, his cock still in his mouth, and that sends him to the edge.
, his scent and his taste on his tongue; maybe Sherlock finally knows how he tastes.
For a while – or a longer while, John isn’t sure – they both sit still, absorbed in their own thoughts. John feels the warmth of Sherlock’s body and it’s the only thing that reminds him of the other man’s presence; and maybe also his own regular breath, coinciding with his heartbeat.

heart weighs heavily on his chest, blocking his lungs and not allowing him to breathe.
Another tear streams down Sherlock’s face as he crushes their lips together. When they break apart to catch a breath, Sherlock touches their foreheads, his hands on John’s neck.
There was only one possible scenario so the probability that it will happen was one hundred percent. Therefore, it doesn’t surprise Sherlock at all when the day after the kidnapping John shows up at the doorstep of their former home.
“You just didn’t find it important enough to tell me, huh? Because I
Molly doesn’t go on cases with him anymore. Sherlock never offers it again, anyway. Lestrade always asks about John, and Sherlock never replies. Ironically, he notices, things are starting to fall into place.
in Sherlock’s gaze, he sees the years of yearning and want, and regret, and the unspoken suffering, and John has never, in any life, any version of reality, expected he’d ever see Sherlock so open and so completely vulnerable.

"The signs of three.”
Sherlock doesn’t move, but doesn’t turn around to face John either.
”You left my wedding rather quickly.” John meets his eyes.
Sherlock tries to get up without disturbing John’s sleep and goes to his bedroom, closing the door behind him.
“J-John—” This is above him. John’s son (and Mary’s, and Mary’s, and Mary’s,

"Maybe you’ll learn to enjoy weddings.”
“Yes, John, I noticed. Get your coat, we don’t have a minute to lose.” John stands still. Sherlock meets his eyes. “Get your coat.”
He wakes up in a bed that’s certainly not his, John’s or Mycroft’s; he opens his eyes and sees the familiar white walls and floors. St. Mary’s Hospital. Sherlock spits at the irony.
Sherlock shuts his eyes, swallowing hard. Of course. John has seen him naked, but it was dark and heavy with the burden of that moment, and he couldn’t have possibly had a good look, but now in the daylight it’s painfully visible.
“John, I’m—I’m gonna—“
In this universe Sherlock can’t stop imagining John kissing Mary.
"I-I can’t, John,” he says, folding to his knees. "I can’t do this. I don’t know how.” He swallows hard. “Forgive me. Please, John, forgive me for all the hurt that I’ve caused you.”
The light we see has travelled for millions of years to reach Earth just in the time of our lifespan. The star that produced it might not even exist anymore, but that doesn’t mean that the light we see isn’t real. It’s just as real as it was when it was emitted by that one particular star. It’s as real as anything else our eyes perceive and transmit in the form of nerve impulses (simply electrical current, really) to our brains. As real as anything else we see.
”I’m sorry Sherlock, that’s not what I meant. Things have changed a bit but no, it wasn’t a goodbye.” He shakes his head as if he was having an inner argument with himself. ”You’ll always be a part of my life.”
John raises his eyes and meets Sherlock’s. He doesn’t know for how long, but the time stops and hangs between them. He’s drowning in Sherlock’s gaze, in everything that has not yet been said out loud. He feels as if Sherlock’s hand covered his again, grasping it and making him follow. John opens his mouth but the words are stuck in his throat. He blinks a few times and the reality slips in between them again. He hears the sirens, the street’s roar, the buzz of policemen’s conversations mixed with intercom.
"I know.” Sherlock looks away. It’s over. "Look, I find it difficult, I find it difficult, this sort of thing.”
which John desperately needs and which Sherlock can’t bear because it seems to cut his heart in half.
Sherlock hates everything.
He caresses John’s face with his shaking hands. Mary doesn’t stop him.
know?” Sherlock smiles sadly and shoots him an agonised gaze.
"Yeah, I think Mike Stamford would agree—”
“Your back looks like it’s been whipped repeatedly.” John steps closer to him. Sherlock feels sudden dizziness and has to lean on the wall slightly. “I want to know who did this. When did it happen?” Sherlock keeps quiet. “Answer me, dammit!”
But in this universe, it’s not possible. The world keeps swirling and the stars will never let them fall into the same orbit.
"Solve crimes?”
“Good night,” he says, stopping the yawn escaping his mouth, and walks twelve steps up to his bedroom.
He meets John’s gaze again and nods, confirming… he doesn’t know what.
“You really want this, don’t you?” John pants in his ear and yes, he’s never wanted anything more, he’s never wanted anyone at all, anyone but John. He doesn’t know if he’s saying this out loud; from how John’s expression changes, he guesses he is. “Lube?” John asks and then goes on to kiss his jaw and neck.
John kisses Mary and smiles at her the way he used to smile at Sherlock and Sherlock has to remind himself over and over again that
is that there never was any pregnancy at all.” Sherlock’s heart skips a few bits and then, he reckons, completely shuts down. Realisation knocks the wind out of him; it’s been already more than 9 months. She should have given birth around the beginning of January, today was 28th. “She fooled you just like she intended to. She’s not pregnant, never has been.”
Sherlock can pinpoint the moment when possessiveness creeps into John’s gaze as he realises what has just been said. John’s eyes run over his face and then he kisses him again, feverish and passionate, marking him, claiming him. Sherlock melts into the mattress as John sets a steadier, faster pace, still kissing his lips and neck. Sherlock’s cock is hard again, trapped and leaking between their bodies. John’s thrusting into him mercilessly, drips of sweat on his forehead, but it’s not pardon Sherlock is interested in.
) clashes in the back of his head as he passes by the known, indifferent faces. Hands are clasping the umbrellas’ holds; John pushes his hands into the pockets of his jacket.

“FUCK!” John shouts and storms out of the kitchen. Sherlock flinches in his chair. “You knew, didn’t you?” Sherlock bows his head. “’Course you knew, you’re Sherlock bloody Holmes, you
Sherlock moves to stand next to him while they wait for Scotland Yard, and starts planning.  If their brief hug was any indication, John could be the best means of mood regulation Sherlock has found since he was a child.  This requires much more study.  Is it only hugs that have this calming effect?  Would other forms of non-sexual physical contact have the same result?  He's already designing the experiments in his head.  John has already proven himself a marvel, but now he may prove capable of increasing Sherlock's case-solving brilliance even more.  Conductor of light, indeed.
"Can't be separated, yeah, I get it," John says, grinning wildly. "I think that's a solution I can work with."
Perhaps it means something, perhaps not, but either way, Sherlock plays on.
Sherlock glares.  "Luck is for the small-minded."
"Tried that.  Didn't help.  I think you should — "

second chance and start living again.
John clears his throat, clearly a bit uncomfortable at the display of emotion, but not regretful as far as Sherlock can discern.
"Of course they do." Sherlock was wearing an old-fashioned black tuxedo with a brilliantly white fitted waistcoat, shirt, and bow tie. And a black floor-length, high-collared cape, lined in what looked like silk, red as the jewelled interior of a pomegranate. Nearly anyone would have looked laughable in the over-the-top costume. Naturally, John thought with exasperated fondness, Sherlock looked fantastic in it, the Byronic bastard. John was more than a bit tempted to suggest they skip the party and stay home instead. He suspected the same idea had occurred to Sherlock.
Either way, Sherlock is in hell.
so warm, and Sherlock wants to curl up with him, bury his face in John’s jumper and nudge his head up into John’s hands so his nimble fingers can card through Sherlock’s hair.
"If you're feeling up to it," Sherlock ventures, "I thought we could go for a walk into town today, perhaps have lunch and visit a few of the shops."
John is here, and John is waiting.  Waiting for him to take his
“John,” he says softly, haltingly, “I’m sorry.”
Two days later, there’s a commotion outside his cell, culminating in the thud of a body against the door and the rusty creak of hinges as it opens to admit a black-clad figure.
When he lifts his head from the body, John is there on the other side of it, grinning as if he’s just told a very good joke. He is wearing the rust-coloured jumper today, and in the dwindling late afternoon light, it is almost precisely the colour of dried blood.
He wants to analyse John's proteome, every single building block of his cells and his constituent chemicals, until he understands exactly which substances in John catalyse such a reaction in him, which ones induce affection and addiction and why they've never had an effect on him until they belonged to John Watson.
"That would be . . . good." Sherlock clears his suddenly tight throat. "'To die would be an awfully big adventure'," he quotes, and John chokes out a suspiciously wet-sounding laugh. His face does something complicated.
“I’m not an idiot, Sherlock. I know that ‘Sherlock is actually a girl’s name’ wasn’t what you wanted to say on the tarmac. I realised it later, just like I realised you weren’t going to come back. You were going to leave again, go off and die without me—” John’s voice breaks, and it's shocking. His chin drops down to his chest, and his fists clench; Sherlock can see the muscle contractions cascade up to John’s shoulders, straightening his spine in military command. “So,” John grits out, gaze snapping back up to Sherlock’s, “what were you going to say? What would you say if it were your last night on Earth, since it actually might be?”
