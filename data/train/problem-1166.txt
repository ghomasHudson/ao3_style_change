He repeated this sentence to himself again and again as he slotted his shoe in to each foothold of the wall trellis under Sherlock’s window, and he knew it was her window because of the beautiful, ornate telescope in the window.
“Your tone is slightly nervy, the pitch of your voice is raised, you keep moving your hands, and looking around you. You’re worried. Somebody made you worried. Obviously.”
“You know how it is.” She said, sympathetically squeezing Sherlock’s shoulder. She’d always liked Mrs Watson. She was nice to her, and always had ginger nut biscuits.
“How’s the tea?” Sherlock questioned as he settled on the armrest of the sofa, slowly dropping the dressing gown off his shoulders and on to the floor.
Sherlock tried to act as though he wasn’t offended, although he definitely felt as though John had just punched him right in the chest. In a way, he had.
I take a look at the list of inmates as I walk down to the corridors. As fate would have it, Sherlock is on the list.
Sherlock had completely forgotten about his brother, and all but fell through the bathroom door in a fit of giggles.
“We will, don’t worry. I’ll even make dinner to say thank you. Sherlock, just sit there and look pretty.” John chuckled.
“How about one last, rough prison fuck?” I growl by his ear, pulling in his earlobe with my teeth as I stop my hand down between us. He’s rock hard.
I hope all is well with you. It’s not so bad here. My bed is uncomfortable, I have to wake up too early, and one of my bunk mates snores, but other than that, It’s okay.
John was stood in front of the mirror trying to decide how to wear his hair. He’d changed outfits six times before deciding on a green v neck jumper, and dark blue jeans. He flipped his hair to the right, then the left, the spiked it, then combed it down. He eventually settled on wearing it combed to the side, holding it fast with gel. He tried to use some of the body spray he’d been given at Christmas, and ended up choking on it. John was hoping his mother wouldn’t notice that he’d put in some effort when getting ready, and start asking questions. Thankfully, his mother didn’t have Sherlock’s talents, and hardly noticed John was even downstairs. She was the least observant person on earth.
“Could you please... do whatever it is that stops her wailing?” Mycroft asked, gesturing to the rather too large to be carried toddler slung about her hip.
He knew this was going to hurt Sherlock, and he knew he would be the cause of it. What if he finished too fast?
Sherlock normally prided himself on being exceptionally intelligent, but this was definitely an act not even a person of average intelligence would make. Only those who were, colloquially put, stupid, would do something like this. But while his normally highly active brain was left to stew in a soup of pent up hormones, his judgement had been extremely mangled. He blamed John. This was entirely his fault. John went out of town. What was Sherlock supposed to do? Just sit and write his blog? As he sat in his restraints, he came to the conclusion that this was probably what he should have done.
Sherlock was grateful for the change in whether, for it meant she could spend more of her time outside.
“No, daddy, no! I only want to- Agh! Please... you... oh...” Sherlock protested, his whole body convulsing.
Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath. Johns fingers tickled his skin as he pulled his briefs down. John quirked his eyebrows. Sherlock’s cock was a decent length, and as pale as the rest of him, nestled amongst dark curls. John grinned to himself, and licked his lips. Sherlock was the picture of awkward as he watched John’s reaction. When John finally looked back up, his usually gunmetal blue eyes had turned navy with arousal.
“She does always have supplies.” John said, winking at his blushing boyfriend before jumping out of the chair to go into their shared bedroom. Sherlock and John had been introduced at a party in freshers week by a mutual friend, Mike Stamford, and had started dating after the Christmas holidays. The couple now shared a flat with Rosie, and two other girls, Molly and Irene; the nymphomaniac.
John wondered for a moment if he would be able to find Sherlock’s prostate. That would probably get him off.
The brunette was light on his feet as he sauntered back over to John and handed him a green tinted bottle full of a glue like fluid.
“So I’m thinking that... I’m going to... for a lack of a better way of putting it... fuck myself... but you’re going to stay here.”
“No, no don’t... don’t stop.” Sherlock garbled, grabbing at johns shoulders when he went to pull back. “Please, don’t stop. Please... Please.”
“What do you want to do for the next few hours?” John asked seductively, pulling Sherlock to him by his hips.
“I don’t want you to just be fine, “ he said after a moment, stilling his hips. “I want you to enjoy this.”
“I wonder how the Watsons are holding up. I saw Harriet downing something a little stronger than champagne.” Mycroft murmured.
School was difficult. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to hold John’s hand, but he knew he couldn’t. He sat with him in lunch, and they walked to and from classes when they could, but they had agreed on keeping their relationship just between them for now. He’d made the mistake of googling ‘how to give a blowjob’ and after hastily deleting his internet history, practiced on a banana. He knew it was stupid, juvenile, but he didn’t want to fuck up. He was now loitering in the playground for John to finish football practice, anticipation pooling in his stomach. He couldn’t help but ogle the blond as he ran over, hair a mess, skin glistening with beads of perspiration, his football kit stuck to his toned figure.
John had a massive growth spurt over the summer, and had built up muscle from rugby. This made him look a lot older.
After I get over my initial surprise, I wrap my arms around his neck and tilt my pelvis forwards so our groins are pressed right together.
Sherlock was breathless beneath him as John finally connected their lips. It was heated and passionate as John slipped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. He bit gently at Sherlock’s lower lip, drawing moans from the curly haired teen. Sherlock pulled back after a moment to breath, his cheeks flushed. He lifted his pelvis when he felt Johns hands slide down his thighs, and under his back. He pushed a pillow underneath his narrow hips, and spread his legs so they were butterflied. He closed his eyes while he waited for John to find some lube, his heart hammering, his stomach doing back flips. He felt the mattress dip under johns weight as he clambered back on to the bed.
She followed John onto the dance floor once more. She placed one of her hands on his shoulder, and the other remained entangled with his. His previously free hand found its way to her hip. She silenced a gasp. The intro for the song changed into the melody, and the pair began to step in time to the piano. John kept eye contact with her as best he could, but looking down at his feet as he tried not to step on her. As the song slowed to an end, Sherlock rested her head on johns chest. She didn’t know how long it would be until she had another opportunity to show him such affection, so she took it with both hands. She couldn’t help the smile that spread to her face when she felt John rest his head on hers. For a moment, she blocked out the music, and all she could hear was his heart beating, loud and as fast as hers.
The next morning, Sherlock had to be prised out of bed, and his mother dropped him at school to ensure he didn’t run off. He hadn’t said anything about his injuries to his mother, although then he could have blamed the tears on physical pain rather than emotional. He felt his heart wrench when he saw John talking to Rosie a few yards away. John looked up, but quickly looked away after making eye contact. Sherlock walked swiftly through to the bathrooms were he collapsed in one of the stalls, sobs violently wracking his body. It was bad enough just having to deal with his one sided feelings for John, but this was down right unfair. What was John playing at? Maybe he was just like the rest of them. He’d been used before by people who got him to do their homework, but this was worse by a factor of 1000. He walked to his first class, chemistry, still bleary eyed, and sat down at the back.
Accustomed to her daughters cert and abrupt manner, she abided without question, and brought Sherlock’s writing set to her.
As time goes on, Sherlock and I only spend more time together. Sure, it’s only for a few minutes at a time most occasions, but sometimes there are moments when we have free time, and we can sneak away for half an hour or so for our more... intimate activities.
Mrs Watson just stood, and watched. She couldn’t comfort him like Sherlock could. This alone amazes her. She’d known her since she was very small, and was very accustomed to Sherlock’s blunt, seemingly emotionless manner, but yet she was there, by John’s side, mumbling words of reassurance to him. After a nod from Sherlock, Mrs Watson crept out of the room, and left them to it.
He grinned when he felt the younger boy quiver against him. Without his sight, everything else was intensified. Johns breath in his ear, the satin on his wrists, the cotton bedsheets on his bare legs, the smell of arousal and sweat driving him mad.
John was mesmerised as he watched Sherlock’s body react to him. All his muscles were tensed, his hands were gripping the sofa cushions, and he was breathing frantically.
He rested his chin on his hands as he stared up at Sherlock in adoration. He looked so gorgeous in his post climactic bliss, his dark curls stuck to his forehead, eyes dark, cheeks flushed, tears staining them... oh shit.
Sherlock would have protested, but she had been throwing up every couple of hours for the past three days, and simply didn’t have the strength to do so.
Sherlock wasn’t quite sure what she should say. Their nearest and dearest knew of course, but that was it.
I pull away from him for a moment; not quite confident enough to do this without looking. I fiddle with his belt buckle for a moment before moving on to his zipper. Without the confines of his navy blue trousers, I can see just how... big... He is... His boxers are red with a small, dark patch wetted with fluid.
Sherlock blushed, and thanked him quietly. She had already that thought that morning when she first put on the tasteful, cotton candy dress.
She pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock heard her leave through the front door, and watched as she walked down the path. She decided to take her mother’s advice, and took up her knitting. The pain in her wrists came and went by the hour, but she didn’t notice. Knitting would give her something to do, but all the tasks in the world wouldn’t change the fact that nobody knew were John was.
Train tomorrow cancelled. Excellent. Yes, you have plenty of warning to sort out a back up, only that back up happens to be a day earlier! So, no, having to pack hastily to get a train back to London that was departing in the next hour was not ideal, but at least he got to see Sherlock a day early. He gazed fondly at his lock-screen as he listened to the general noise of the train. It was cliche, and cheesy, he knew that, but he couldn’t help himself but set it as a picture of him and Sherlock kissing under a mistletoe. He rolled his eyes as he read through the text messages from the brunette.
The brunette smiled, and thanked her mother. Mr Holmes cried upon seeing her, and brought her into a warm hug.
Sherlock pondered this for a moment. He didn’t mind mike. He was a nerd, and got bullied because of it, like Sherlock. He was interesting to talk to, and was by no means Stupid. He was also one of the only kids who tolerated Sherlock.
Sherlock was coming home for the Christmas holidays, and John had gone to collect her from the station. He was desperate to see her again. He’d missed her so much, and although her letters declaring her loathing for the other children was a great source of amusement, nothing compared to holding her in his arms. His face lit up the moment he saw her get off the train. She ran over to him and practically leapt in to his arm.
And yet, I may be forced to stand corrected when I feel John’s hand immediately reaching between our bodies and brushing up against my clothed erection.
“I would have taken you in my mouth, slow and gentle. I’d work you till you were a thrashing mess, pleading, begging me to let you cum. Then right when you were on the brink, I’d slip my fingers in to your tight, little, virgin hole... and make you cum... and I’d swallow every sweet drop.”
He tried to keep too much mirth out of his voice as he squeezed John’s bulge through his trousers. The blond’s eyes flew wide, and his hands curled into fists at his sides. John was only great full that Irene can back at that moment, and inadvertently distracted Mycroft and his parents.
He finally located a pair, and jumped in to them, struggling to get his feet through the leg holes. After falling backwards on to the bed, he managed to wriggle in to them. He sprayed himself with deodorant and body spray, then raced in to the hall.
She kissed him again, for longer this time, and flung her arms around his neck before moving him backwards and pushing him down on to her narrow single bed.
“You should have said yes. That way if we got in trouble, I could throw you under the bus, or get him to do both of our homework. Next time, think things through.”
He smirked when he felt Sherlock shiver. He sat back, and looked at the other boy who had turned a deep shade of pink.
“Mikey? What’s wrong?” Mrs Holmes asked from the kitchen when she saw the disgruntled look on her eldest son’s face.
Per instruction, John always carried wet wipes and lube in his pockets in case events like this presented themselves.
I can’t take my eyes off of him as I utter words of agreement and take my arms up to his broad shoulders.
His little display worked better than he predicted. John’s normally deep navy eyes had darkened to black as his lust grew. He was staring at Sherlock with an almost predatory gaze as the brunette
Sherlock sat up, and looked down in between his legs. When he looked back at John, his cheeks were flushed.
Sherlock wandered around the room, picking up papers and clothes from the floor, and chucking them into a corner.
John motioned for her to come down. She crept down the stairs, hugging her blue dressing gown to her. She unlocked the back door to let John in.
I am really going to come off as an asshole, but it’ll be worth it for the minutes alone with Sherlock.
Both boys laughed at this, and it dawned on mike that he was the gooseberry. He hadn’t intended on playing matchmaker, but he couldn’t help but smile at the scene playing out before him.
She didn’t care if anyone saw them, and neither did he. As she ran her tongue along his lips, John couldn’t help but note that finishing school hadn’t changed her at all.
Sherlock drew his lip between his teeth, grinning. He settled down next to John, a few inches away, then pressed play. Throughout the film, he shuffled closer to John until they were shoulder to shoulder. John looked over to Sherlock, who was completely immersed in the film, gaze transfixed on the fight scene before him. He reached over, and took Sherlock’s pale hand in his. He tensed, then looked down at their joined hands, and smiled. By the end of the film, Sherlock had fallen asleep on johns shoulder. The older boy looked down at his dozing form, and tentatively pushed a dark curl away from his face. At the contact, his eyes fluttered open.
She held out her arms, and took the small bundle. Lucy had only been born two weeks ago. Her father had never seen her. Sherlock had never imagined Mycroft as a mother, never mind herself as an aunt. But now, as she held her niece, she felt an attachment to her. She gently ran her fingers through her soft blonde hair, careful to avoid her soft spot. Her eyes opened then, crystal blue orbs, just the same as Sherlock and Mycroft. Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder what her own child would look like. And would John be the father? She felt tears creep up on her as she looked down at the baby, who had also begun crying.
“Then turn the fuck around.” John ordered. Sherlock shivered before turning around again, on his knees, bent on his elbows, ass in the air.
Today was a day nobody thought would come. Mycroft’s wedding day. She and Greg had been courting for about a year and a half. He’d finally met her father that summer, and they’d got on very well. He’d asked for permission to marry Mycroft that same day. Sherlock had promised her mother she wouldn’t interrogate the guests, or insult Mycroft, and she’d try and remember her soon to be brother in law’s name. The family was all bustling around the house, Harriet was up in mycroft’s room helping her get ready, and Mrs Holmes was fighting a loosing battle with Sherlock over the matter of her hair.
I quickly run my fingers back over his rim to make sure he is loose enough before positioning myself between his legs.
Sherlock lifted his hips, rubbing his pelvis against johns groin. He was hard as a rock. John pulled off the jumper that he didn’t remember giving Sherlock permission to borrow, and threw it behind him. He gripped Sherlock’s wrists, and pinned them above his head.
Sherlock swivelled on the bed so he had his back to John. He felt him unlock his left wrist, but not his right.
He was still lose from where he’d stretched himself earlier, but John wanted to make sure he wouldn’t get hurt, so he slipped a finger in to work him open further.
I push my tongue past his tight ring of muscle. His knees clench around my shoulders and he tugs harshly at my hair as he tilts his pelvis up in to my touch.
“Never handcuff oneself to anything if one is the only one in the house.” Sherlock said in a questioning manner, turning his head to look at John over his shoulder.
“Feeling any better this morning?” He murmured, gently tracing little circles on to Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock suspected John was playing along with the soul purpose of being difficult. He stomped out of the room, and down the hall. John turned to Mrs Holmes, and revealed why he effectively threw Sherlock out of the room.
John had been away traveling around Wales and Scotland for the entire summer, which left Sherlock plenty of time for her chemistry experiments. She’d also taken up interest in scrap booking, and had kept track of the things she’d done that summer. She doubted it was as interesting as johns. The only real thing that had happened to her was a huge growth spurt, and she’d started to develop curves. That was hardly something worth telling John. Mycroft had been at home, causing her usual nonsense. The peculiar child had turned into a rather beautiful young lady, having grown into her sharp features. She now wore cream lace gloves, a hat, and carried an umbrella when she went out. The corset she wore beneath her blouse hardly had any effect on her immaculate posture, and her high heals only made her seem more frightening. It was often a concern of Mrs Holmes that she would never find husbands for her daughters. Sherlock would put them off with her lack of a filter, and Mycroft would scare them away.
The room was filled with loud moans, cries of pleasure, squelching noises, rattling headboards, and bed springs. It was fair to say their neighbours hated them.
John arrived outside the house addressed 221b Baker Street. He hesitantly walked up to the door, and knocked. A woman opened the door. John tried his best to hide his confusion. She was too old to be sherlock’s mother,  possibly his grandmother. She had shoulder length brown hair, and kind, hazel eyes, laughter lines surrounding them.
Our lips are still connected as I begin to slide my hand up and down his cock, but John pulls back a few millimetres every few seconds to exhale a shaky breath. When he leans back in, the kisses are heated and messy, a sense of desperation clear as I open my jaw wider to allow him better access.
“Getting lube.” John replied, head bent over as he looked through their draws tantalisingly slow. Sherlock suspected he was being slow on purpose.
Sherlock sat on the sofa till long after dark, locked away in his mind palace, dreaming of John. Although he only had dream John now, on Monday he would spend all day with the real John. His John.
“John Watson.” He said, pointing to the blond who was currently running with the ball. “What about you?”
His mouth is on me now, and oh god it’s taking all of my willpower not to buck my hips up in to his mouth.
The whole room lingered with the aroma of the libidinous activities that had taken place. They should probably do something about that.
As of now, I’m loitering in the utility cupboard down the hall from commissary whilst I wait for John to finish in the dorms. After numerous, tedious minutes of waiting, the arcane pattern of knocks sound on the other side of the door.
This was a common request of johns, but it was the exact opposite for John to apply lube to his own fingers, and start stretching himself too.
Sherlock was sat on the bed, actually tied to the bed, staring up at John with pained eyes and parted lips.
I gape at him as he turns me around by my shoulders, steers me out the door and out in to the darkness.
He opened his eyes just in time to see Sherlock swallow the salty liquid. He fell back, and lay still, breathing heavily.
She hadn’t even got dressed, and was still only clad in a night dress. She went to run up the stairs, but the blond occupants of next door were all standing in the hall, John included.
He undid the knot, and let the towel fall to the floor. John gasped when he felt Sherlock’s lips wrap round his cock.
‘Oh yes, help me with this heavy thing, officer’. It’s cliche and degrading, but I knew it would work. An individual, no less a former soldier, will attempt to woo a potential partner by proving physical strength. My plan, simple as it may be, proved my theory that he is on some level attracted to me.
“Don’t suppose you’re close at all?” John grunted, his hips snapping forwards in an unsteady rhythm.
Thompson was a bright young thing, who was still enjoying the adventure that he was told war would bring.
John moved closer to Sherlock so their bodies were pressed together. He placed his hands on Sherlock’s narrow waist, moving their hips in tandem.
Sherlock curled up against johns side, and lay his head on his shoulder, breathing in the exotic smell of John’s body wash.
Sherlock knew that wasn’t all they were to each other, so it didn’t matter what the rest of the world knew. She knew, and John new.
Sherlock was already dripping with sweat, some from dancing, some from anticipation. He had a feeling John would like the underwear he was sporting. It would definitely make tonight more interesting if John saw them now, but how to get him to see them? He slowly slipped his leg in between John’s, and brushed his knee up against his groin.
He was hot and hard, a simpering mess, unapologetically sounding out his desire to John. He needed John to touch him, but so far, John was keeping his mouth everywhere but where Sherlock needed him most. He ran his tongue back up Sherlock’s body, dipping it into his collar bone. He pressed kisses along his jawline, and proceeded to kiss at his nose and cheeks. Sherlock tried to move forward to catch johns lips in a kiss, but the blond sat back, just out of Sherlock’s reach. He whimpered in frustration, yanking his arms forwards in vane, his wrists aching.
“That my darling...” He drawls as he mouths at my jaw. “Was your prostate. Being a medical student does have the oddest perks.”
He waited patiently for her response. They were long passed the point of her thinking he was crazy, and asking to sit elsewhere. She knew very well how odd he was.
I’m not sure anymore whether I’m talking to him or myself, some of my own words only resonating with myself now as I speak them aloud.
“Well thank god you’re above that. Jumping out of alley ways...” John mumbled, determined not to show any signs of fear. He was used to people cornering him. Usually to tease him about his height. He felt his phone buzz. He took it out of his pocket, and saw a text from Sherlock. When did he get his phone number?
We have a few moments together, but those moments are always ‘a moment where I don’t have to be supervised’ and ‘a moment where he’s not on duty’.
Before Sherlock had a chance to finish his sentence, John had leant forwards, and pressed his lips up against his own. Sherlock felt his brain short circuiting, everything about John's lips hit him in a wave. Soft, warm, minty, and exactly how he'd imagined. What was throwing him was that he wasn’t imagining it anymore. John was kissing him. He still hadn’t had time to comprehend what was happening by the time John pulled back. He sat, in silence, just staring at John. John had just kissed him. He and John had just kissed. His mind swirled as he tried to arrange his thoughts.
“Oh, that would be lovely.” Mrs Watson said, a smile tugging at her lips. “Speaking of tea, I must invite you in for some. I’ll have Lillie put the kettle on.”
Sherlock giggled as John pulled her closer and pressed a kiss on the sweet spot where her ear met her neck.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, panting quietly. John slowly sunk to his knees between Sherlock’s legs, tightly gripping at his thighs. Sherlock let out a whine when he felt Johns hot, wet tongue run across his dripping slit. Sherlock tasted sweet with almost a tropical note.
I learn more little tidbits about his life, like his hobbies, his family, particularly the older brother who intrudes in every aspect of his life.
After a moment, John left for the bathroom to get some flannels, but he was back within a few seconds.
I slam in to him as hard as I can, the sound of Sherlock’s groans and our skin slapping together fills the space.
Sherlock darted his tongue out to swipe it across John’s slit, lavishly licking at the beads of pre-cum at the tip.
I’m sure I’ll berate myself for that later, but I’m still battling the sea of emotions I’m experiencing right now.
With shaking fingers, Sherlock managed to pull the football shirt John had failed to change out of over his head.
Sherlock lifted his head to give John a small nod. He felt excited, exhilarated and aroused as he always did when they tried new things. There were a few things he’d not taken to, but that didn’t stop him being optimistic. He let out a squeal when he felt the foreign object at his entrance. This was similar to when John fucked him with a dildo so he settled with it fairly quickly.
Sherlock glared at the babbling woman, his nostrils flaring. John couldn’t help but notice he looked like a pissed off rabbit.
Hi guys. Jesus, I’ve dragged this story out. I promise i’ll jump to when John comes home in the next few chapters. Thank you for the comments! 😊
“Well... I don’t know if we’ll be welcome back here... because I’m pretty sure Mrs Hudson heard everything.”
I grip his shoulders, and lift myself on to his lap. He moans softly at this, and pulls me closer to him by my hips.
“Oh, Yes I’ve seen her.” Sherlock said as he recalled seeing the girl talking to her brother outside the tennis hall.
I can’t help but grin to myself as I saunter through the corridors, Sherlock’s underwear clutched in my pocket.
I ball both socks up and hide them underneath my bed before settling down and drifting off back to sleep.
She found one that would fit him, and tossed it on top of the armful of clothes he was already holding.
He shuffles me about a little bit before bucking his hips up, ramming his cock in to me with substantial force, and then he hits something, and my fucking god!
“Watson, one of the inmates in the kitchen has cut his hand. Adler has taken him down to medical, and I need assistance in the cafeteria.”
Irene lead the other two girls out into the living space, and to the door. This gave Sherlock time to sort himself out, just in case things went where he was hoping when John came home.
As she spoke, John couldn’t keep his eyes off her. She had the same beautiful cat eyes as always, that appeared blue and gold from some angles, and almost silver from others. Her hair was longer than before, and fell in neat curls on to her shoulders, framing her face, which had got longer, and more angular. Her figure had filled out, her blouse and skirt advertising the swell of her hips and breasts. She was most definitely a young woman now. Sherlock listened intently as John told her a selection of somewhat sugar coated stories. They were sugar coated not for her sake, but his own. He wouldn’t mention the cold that made you wish you were dead, the huge rats, the grotesque smell, the lice, the bodies, none of it. He couldn’t. His body visibly tensed, his eyes glazing over.
John was peering at his boyfriend over the sofa, watching as he appeared to be fighting a losing battle with a tin opener.
He bit back a moan as he witnessed john pull off his football shorts, leaving him in his red boxer shorts that did very little to hide his arousal.
“Ditto.” John said, quickly picking up his orange juice, hoping the glass would hide his quivering lip.
And so was our rendezvous, hidden moments in staff bathrooms, cupboards, the bubble, wherein which we would converse on the day’s matters; our lives outside of here; John would encourage me to develop my repertory of music of the non classical variety; and we would exchange kisses ranging from gentle and sweet to heated and desperate.
“Age is not necessarily a factor in the art of making friends, besides I neither want, nor need friends, so your logic is moot.” The teen stated matter of factually, folding her hands behind her back.
“He’s trying to keep the weight off. Puberty, natural fat burner. Went from being a hippo to a beanpole over night.”
“And you just know he’s a psycho. You can see it in his eyes. One of these days, winding up the other kids won’t be enough. He’ll snap. Psychopaths get bored.”
“I’m his mother. A mother is supposed to be able to comfort her child when they cry. I don’t know how to help him.”
“As long as you want. My father is away at a conference, so his opinions on the matter is moot, but my mother won’t mind, and I don’t care what Mycroft thinks.”
He does have a point. The only thing noteworthy that happened yesterday was one of our fellow inmates thought that super noodles was a television show instead of a brand of dehydrated carbohydrates.
Sherlock wriggled back in to his trousers, then fell back in a heap of giggles as John pushed him back on the bed. He ignored the unfamiliar taste on his lips as John reconnected their lips, and responded none the less. John trapped Sherlock underneath him, his knees either side of his narrow hips. Sherlock ran his hands down johns chest, and undid the zipper on johns jeans. The blond sighed happily as he felt Sherlock slip his hands down the front of his boxers.
There was now a very noticeable bump beneath her dress that drew unwanted eyes and questions, shame too if it hadn’t of been for the diamond ring proudly displayed on her left hand.
John allows a low groan to fall from his parted lips, his chest heaving as he comprehends my request.
John silenced him with his mouth as he crashed their lips together. He ran his hands up Sherlock’s back, then gently clawed at his skin as he dragged them back down.
He looks so peaceful when he sleeps. I think it’s the only time his mind is ever at rest, the only time he ever stops.
Sherlock lifted his dark head off the bed, and glanced down at the image from the sports direct catalogue John was showing him from where he was sat on the floor.
The next morning, Sherlock awoke before John. He was sleeping soundly, his hand hanging off the bed, still clutching hers. She squeezed his hand gently before letting go, and getting up to go in to the kitchen. Mrs Watson was sat at the table with Lily.
"Oh, Good. Now, what do you two want for breakfast. And no, Sherlock, it is not an option. You're eating it."
John let go of him, and allowed him to crawl across the bed. He pulled out a box from John’s bed side table, and presented it to him.
Sherlock hid his face in johns neck as they paid at the till. This was often his manner, regardless of whether they were buying cock rings or condoms. John always found this amusing because as soon as they got home, Sherlock would be on his knees, begging for the blond’s cock without shame. John grinned to himself as he looked at the boy nuzzled up to his shoulder as he waited for the cashier to ring up the bill. Shy in the streets, freak in the sheets indeed.
I hate opening my eyes, and seeing the empty space beside me. Empty, alone, empty, no one, no body, empty, empty empty-
“Her vitals all look fine. I believe she is suffering from heartbreak, although I cannot hear it with my stethoscope.” He said sadly, glancing over to the young girl.
With that, she ran off towards the boy who called out to her, and left the school grounds. John left too, and wandered along the street, kicking rocks out of his path, and contemplating what a weird day he’d had. Sherlock was incredible. I mean, John could see why he annoyed people, but he was brilliant. He wasn’t going to allow that sally girl to make deductions for him, and chose to make his own judgments. A noise from the left startled him, which made him halt in his tracks. He whipped round to see a tall figure step out from an alley way.
Mrs Holmes had blonde hair that was pinned up in a bun, and the same bright blue eyes as Sherlock, which were staring up at her in annoyance.
Sherlock didn’t have time to react before he felt John crash their lips together, and pin him to the wall. He closed his eyes as he felt himself melting in to the kiss, but it was only briefly, as John pulled back a moment later, eyes closed, chest heaving. Sherlock just watched him in silence, waiting for his heart rate to return to normal, and just stared up at John from where he was trapped between his muscular arms.
Sherlock realised she shouldn’t have been so quick to suggest John, and should have jumped straight to denial.
Sherlock had opted for covering up how nervous he was with allowing himself to get lost in the foreplay, but he couldn’t deny the nagging feeling in his stomach that got stronger and stronger as the moment got more real.
John gasped loudly as he came hard into Sherlock’s mouth, shooting ropes of hot cum down his throat. Sherlock swallowed as much as he could but some of it trickled down his chin. He looked up at John as he coyly licked his lips. John groaned deep in his throat, his eyes wide, chest heaving. After he caught his breath, he pulled Sherlock up from the floor, his fingers under his chin, and sat him back on the bed.
John couldn’t help but stare when he turned around. He was tall with ebony curls, bright blue feline eyes, and cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass.
Sherlock snapped her attention back to John. He was regarding her with worried eyes, scanning her face.
John felt his cheeks burning up immediately as his mum all but forced a box of condoms in to his hands.
“We have to stop at his house before hand. He hasn’t got his school bag.” Sherlock quipped from the other side of the room where he was poking around in the fridge.
“Oh, that cool. You’ll have to play me a tune sometime.” John grinned at her, little dimples in his cheeks appearing.
He lets out a whimper, but the previously established safe word, ‘September’, doesn’t pass his lips.
Since having met him, Sherlock has grown another inch or two and is now taller than myself, but he’s still built like a noodle, so carrying him isn’t exactly a difficult task.
“You better not mess up my sock index again.” Said the dark haired teen who was perched on his desk chair, critically watching her every move.
Mr Watson didn’t even try to pretend he wasn’t lying as he spoke. He knew Sherlock would see straight through it. There was no deceiving her. She headed back to her father, her stomach sinking, and her heart crumbling.
Sherlock nodded in agreement as she walked over to where the infant was lying in his basket which was set on the table.
Sherlock tried not to let this fact distract him as he fumbled on his bed stand for his alarm clock.
“Your turn.” John husked as he slid his hands up Sherlock’s legs. As usual, he started of with slow, steady strokes, but Sherlock was already so hard and desperate for John to touch him that he was thrashing about and moaning in seconds.
“No, Sherlock, not for that. I need a fake girlfriend so mother and father won’t give me a condescending lecture on how I don’t have a real one.”
"Your ribs are bruised, but I'm not too worried. Obviously, I'm not really, or at all qualified to make theses diagnoses, so maybe you should see a doctor?" John said cautiously, his eyes landing everywhere but Sherlock's.
“You’ll be off the university after the summer. You both have exceedingly high IQs, and here you are at the bloody breakfast table fighting over a bloody jar of bloody fruit compot!”
God, his erection is rubbing between my thighs, and fucking hell its getting me so wet for him, the tip of my cock leaking pre-cum at an alarming rate.
Mycroft paused for a moment. He enjoyed the solitude that his persona brought him. He’d never considered for a moment that Sherlock felt differently.
“Since I’ve known you, I always knew you were special. I always knew there was something about you. I haven’t felt this way about anyone else. I guess what I’m trying to say is...” he trailed off, presumably moving his head away from the phone.
John stood before her, arm extended towards her. Although she’d never say, Sherlock was very fond of dancing, and would often practice in the drawing room to the tunes of ‘Yankee doodle’ on the gramophone.
School was the same as always, the embarrassment of PE, fending off Molly in biology, and staring holes in the back of Rosie’s head in French. A new thing he found himself doing was spending morning break in the bathroom, crying his soul out in an empty toilet stall. At the end of the day, John had a phone call from his mother telling him to come home. He’d gone home with Sherlock to pick up some stuff, thanked Mrs Holmes, then trudged home. Sherlock sulked in his room, and refused to come down to eat his dinner. The plate of food his mother sent up was promptly thrown down the toilet. The next day, Sherlock overslept, and had to be driven to school. His mother knew his mood had something to do with John, but she daren’t ask. He’d sat with John during lunch, but as always, Rosie was there too. John had declined Sherlock’s offer of going to see a film, and had said he was going to spend time with Rosie. Sherlock had excused himself to cry in the bathroom, and hadn’t made it back before next class. It was unknown to him that John had panicked, and asked Rosie to hang out. Why did he think of Sherlock all the time? He wasn’t gay. He wasn’t. At least that was what he told himself. He felt like punching himself in the face when he saw the look on Sherlock’s after he declined his offer. He’d gone to a cafe with Rosie, where he found himself thinking, slash worrying about Sherlock the entire time.
“There’s no way he did this. I know him well, remember. He’s always in medical.” She reinstates, eyebrows raised.
John was pleased at how Sherlock was responding, the sight of him squirming and pulling against his restraints was one that turned him on immensely. He decided to up the ante a little by dragging the cube further down, down to Sherlock’s chest to circle his nipple.
John tentatively wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s midsection, and allowed him to lean his weight on him.
They stared at each other for a moment, gaze flickering from the others eyes and lips. Sherlock eventually broke his gaze, only for it to fall on a number of johns fellow teammates embracing and kissing their girlfriends. John followed his gaze to the group of teens, then turned back to him with a sad smile.
The Holmes manor was a large one, so there were plenty of rooms to be done up as a nursery, but Sherlock had insisted on keeping the baby in her room, so instead, a few necessities, a cot, a changing table, etc, had been moved in to her sizeable bedroom.
John got her to lift her hips again as he pulled the delicate, cotton garment down her legs. This was the first time he’d seen her like this. Exposed. Apart from the stockings and the belt that held them up, she was completely naked.
He lifted his arms to allow John to pull the garment off, then reconnected their lips in a hungry kiss.
Her mother didn’t ask why, she simply moved the chair across the room, somewhere Sherlock seemingly deemed appropriate. She wouldn’t say out loud why the chair had to be moved. She just couldn’t bear to look at his empty chair. It was johns chair.
“I’m sure you are.” John cooed. “Why don’t you go get in a towel while I get washed? Pick a movie, and I’ll come join you in a minute.”
“You’re telling me.” Sherlock quipped. “My mummy always kisses it better so it doesn’t hurt so much.”
Sherlock hints at his issues with authority while he and knight in shining armour, John, play doctor.
“So wet, aren’t you?” John teased as he brushed his fingers over the sensitive tip of Sherlock’s cock.
With John was always where he was happiest, Well happy full stop, and lying here, naked, lying on top of the handsome blond, was by far the happiest he’d ever been.
John looked up at Sherlock with his big, grey eyes, a few strands of blond hair falling into them. Hasn’t had his haircut in approximately seven weeks. His mother hasn’t had time to take him. She doesn’t have time for him full stop.
I stand there, dumbfounded, in the corner of the library just holding a bundle of cloth... what even is this?
Without my gloves, I can feel how soft and smooth his skin is. I can also feel how fast his pulse is palpitating.
“Nothing. I mean... I got a bruise during P.E. It’s nothing.” Sherlock said hastily, trying to pull his shirt further up his neck.
“I did training with the girl guides. It was about the only useful thing they taught me. So, I can do it. If you don’t want me to-“
Sherlock followed John down the stairs back to the party, and sat with their parents, siblings, and friends as they waited for the countdown. Sherlock and John had both been given some champagne, and had been sipping at it faster than they should have. It was fair to say both of them were rather tipsy.
“And yes, you are an asshole. I won’t lie to you. But you’re also a great young man. In fact, one day,” he said, standing up. “You might even make a good one.”
He’ll start with an accidental run in which will evolve in to a full on physical confrontation, and end with me dragging him away in to the old break room.
“They were having sex!” Rosie hollered. She was steadying herself on Greg’s arm who must have arrived since the couple snuck off.
John was sat in the living room when she came down the stairs, a cup of tea already clasped between his hands.
He clearly wasn’t fooling anybody with his vulgar words because john pulled back and stared down at him with a look of concern.
He quickly looks around him before crossing the library floor so he’s standing on one side of a bookcase, and I on the other.
It was quarter to four, and each second felt like a minute, and each minute felt like an hour. That’s how the whole day had gone for Sherlock in anticipation of having tea with John and his family. The doorbell finally rang, and Mrs Hudson went to open it while Sherlock watched from the top of the stairs. She focused on John, who was wearing a white shirt tucked into a pair of grey shorts along with a pair of knee socks which weren’t even. Sherlock wondered if she should tell him.
Sherlock wasn’t normally one to back away from confrontation, but she wasn’t use to being the objective of this sort of male attention, and found herself backing away to stand behind john.
“Yes, there are left overs for you and harry in the fridge. If she can be bothered to come down here.” John said, trying to keep the edge out of his voice.
She couldn’t open her mouth to speak any words, so an incredibly enthusiastic nod was all she could provide.
“That works well. I’m not quite ready either. I’ve never had a relationship before, so... Anything else?”
And for the first time in over three years, Sherlock leant in, and connected their lips in a kiss. Johns lips were warm, chapped, but still soft, and exactly how she remembered. She broke away for breath, and pressed her forehead against his.
It amuses me when he gets all nervous and coquettish. He has a blush that starts at his cheeks and goes all the way down his pale chest, a few curly strands of dark hair residing in the middle, reminding me of his adolescence.
“That makes sense. Kind of like a pen pal, I guess. You’ve never met them, but you you know them anyway.”
John looked up at her with sad, bloodshot eyes. He patted his knee, and Sherlock carefully climbed into his lap.
“I came to the thought of you.” He blurted, shifting his gaze to John’s for a brief second. Johns lips pulled into a grin. Imagining Sherlock getting off to the thought of him turned him on even more so than he already was.
“Oh fuck. Quick, think of an excuse why I’m late while I find my pants... god, where the fuck are they?”
“This is the second time I’ve had to shower today.” Sherlock grumbled, referring to the jam incident.
Sherlock was lead into the shop by a very determined Irene, his cheeks pink. The lighting was low, giving it a slightly daunting feel, and the air smelt of incense which made Sherlock’s nose itch. Lining the walls were sex toys, lingerie, handcuffs, whips, everything from fifty shades, red lights in the shelves highlighting the objects.
I feel my heart thump in my chest as we gaze at each other. Call it cheesy, call it cliche, but I feel myself falling in love with him even more with every passing second.
He almost immediately assaults my lips with his, lust a vicious motivator for him to begin thrusting his tongue down my throat.
“SHERLO- AH! NNNGGGHH!” John cried out before biting down on Sherlock’s pale shoulder as he felt his orgasm hit him.
She was being pulled back to the safety of the platform, behind the yellow line, where she fell into a heap on the floor, along with whoever had saved her. It was only when she picked up in the familiar scent of the perfume that she recognised her saviour.
“Wish it was-ngggghh... ah... your cock hitting my- ah!- prostate- gah!” Sherlock howled as he rode his fingers.
When Friday rolled around, Sherlock was there to watch johns game. What John hadn’t counted on, was his father being there too, and only a row away from his curly haired boyfriend. Thankfully he didn’t notice, leaving nothing to distract him from his game. He scored the winning goal with three minutes to spare. Half the school was there to watch, but the only person John cared about, was Sherlock, who was cheering away with great vigour. The brunette came running over to him as soon as the game was over and his teammates had scattered.
Mrs Hudson smiled broadly at John, then turned to regard the lanky teenager who had propped himself against the kitchen door.
“I... I’m so sorry, John.” I wail pathetically, grabbing fistfuls of his shirt with my shaking hands.
“John... I... I’m gonna- Ah- Cum!” Sherlock  screamed, his eyes flying wide, muscles spasming, the corners of his vision going black, endorphins flooding his  bloodstream as ropes of sticky, white fluid shot from his cock. He fell back on to the bed, breathing heavily as the last few spurts of cum trickled from his length. John reached his own climax a moment later, making Sherlock cry out in his hypersensitive state as John released his seed inside him.
Sherlock pressed a parting kiss to johns lips before sauntering off in to the bathroom. John sat himself down on
“Alright... Do you want to hold my shoulders? This ummm... this might hurt.” John says as he moves forward to line himself up with my hole.
“It’s nearly ten o’clock. Early night for you I think.” Mrs Watson said in a soothing tone. “Sherlock, dear, you’re welcome to stay if you’d like. We could put you up in the spare room.”
“Oh fuck!” Sherlock screamed as he felt John brush up against his prostate, his pleasure peaking. He knew he was close, and so was John. His rhythm was becoming sloppy, and his breaths were short and shaky.
John and Sherlock both got up, and followed the doctor to where harry was being kept. On the bed lay a girl of about 19, same blonde hair as John, but with green eyes instead of grey. Her face was washed out, and there were remainders of makeup under her eyes, but she conformed to the desired, traditional beauty.
“Yes, I suppose I am. I’ll actually be allowed to do experiments without being told it’s ‘unsafe, and bloody well stupid’” She said in quotation marks.
“Well, I started at secondary school.” John said slowly, knowing it was a sore spot with the younger child.
Sherlock knew he’d have to engage in small talk with her if he wanted to keep on her good side. She was rather useful, and an adequate partner.
“I’m gonna take a shower.” Sherlock mused, running his now free hands down johns chest. He climbed off the bed, and took a long stretch. John rolled over in the purple cotton sheets to sneak a look at Sherlock in all his glory. His long, lean, and lightly toned body was glistening with sweat, adorned with fresh love bites, and a proper bite mark on his shoulder. He bent over to stretch, tensing all the muscles in his back and ass. John shook his head at the tease that was his boyfriend. He crawled across the bed, and placed his hands on Sherlock’s waist. He added to Sherlock’s collection of marks by biting softly at the smooth skin of Sherlock’s ass.
“You’ll be joining him shortly. I’m sure it’ll be different then. For starters, you’ll have less time to notice his absence.”
Sherlock had been sat in her play room all morning, leaving a few times, only to be ushered back in because she was getting under people’s feet. Her father had left for work, her mother was busy baking a pie for the new neighbours, and her older sister was no doubt holed up in her room. The age gap was substantial, meaning the pair didn’t have anything in common, other than their nature. Both were very clever, and blunt, but it was slightly more palatable on the wiry teenager than it was on the curly haired child. Sherlock had a habit of freaking out her peers, and there for spent a lot of time alone. The older of the two was much the same, but she rather enjoyed the solitude, unlike Sherlock, who was alone by default.
John’s voice was a deep rumble that Sherlock could feel vibrating from his chest, raising his cock to full mast.
Sherlock was already stretched and ready for johns cock, but he still gritted his teeth at the initial feeling as John began to slide in to him.
He stroked John one more time before the athlete gripped both his hands, and pinned his wrists to the walls.
She had insisted that Mycroft and her mother left the room. If she’d had it her way, she would have done this all on her own.
Sherlock was practically on the verge of tears by the time John managed to free him, and all but collapsed in to the blond’s arms.
His pink cock, engorged with blood, throbs between his legs, dripping with fluid, outing him for how desperate he is for this.
I falter for a moment before looking up. He’s regarding me with a look that doesn’t read as unimpressed in the slightest. In fact, he looks rather bemused.
“Please.” John said suddenly, looking up at her with his blue grey eyes. They use to remind her off a calm, picturesque evening by the sea, the waves gently washing up to shore; but now, she could see their was a whole thunderstorm chopping the waves, sending them crashing down on to the beach, and john, a lonely little boat, lost at sea, trying not to capsize.
“No.” Replied the brunette, his voice deep and strained. “Maybe this will teach you to pay better- oh fuck- attention...”
John glanced down at Sherlock the best he could to where the curly haired teen was resting on his shoulder.
The taste of his pre cum floods my mouth, and makes me wrinkle my nose. It’s not awful, it’s just a little bitter.
“Oh...” Sherlock moaned both in pleasure and realisation as he watched John begin to circle his hole.
“Did I actually have an eyelash... or were you just looking for an opening...?” I mumble against his lips.
John didn’t know how to respond to this, so he simply offered a curt nod, lips drawn in to a taut line while his mother returned to the kitchen.
John began to rock his hips softly against Sherlock’s ass, their trousers causing maddening friction.
Sherlock awoke before John the next morning, giving him enough time to sneak to the bathroom, and wipe away any evidence of his tears. He thanked his lucky stars he hadn’t had another wet dream.  He woke John with the closing of the door when he came back.
“Hey... you know this is probably one of the last opportunities we’re going to have for you to fuck me like the dirty criminal I am...”
He could feel his erection throbbing as John moved his lips down his thighs, then right up again to the edge of the fabric.
Sherlock mouthed kisses down johns neck, sucking hard at his collar bone. When Sherlock let go, John pulled back to take his shirt off. Sherlock attached his lips to John’s chest, kissing all the way down to his pubic bone. John groaned, his head lolling backwards when Sherlock began biting and sucking at the skin on his hipbones. Sherlock’s tongue sent every nerve ending singing. When Sherlock brought his head back up, John gave him a sloppy kiss, all tongue and teeth.
I can feel tears in my eyes, my throat, threatening to spill over, but none run on to my cheeks, and no sound falls from my lips.
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh as she walked over to him, nor could she help the tears that sprung from her eyes when he began to walk towards her.
And just like the acid, words of her big secret came creeping up her throat and escaping her lips, spilling out in to the room for everyone to see.
John pressed his finger back in to her dripping, wet heat, and slowly began to pump his finger in and out.
It was a nice wedding, very cheerful, no arguments, and an all round nice day, with the exception of Sherlock and John getting told off for starting a confetti fight. They all went back to the Holmes’ estate for the after party, which spilt from the house out to the garden. They had tea and cake on the lawn, and danced in the dining hall, cleared of its chairs and tables. Mycroft and Greg danced their first dance alone, then everyone else took to the floor to dance. Harriet had danced with the young man who had been Gregs’s best man, and John had only got up to dance with his mother. Sherlock was otherwise occupied providing the music. She had insisted playing her violin, a touching gesture that unbeknownst to her, was much appreciated by Mycroft. She eventually went to sit down when one of the newlyweds’ friends from university got up to play a piano solo. She sat in the corner observing the guests, quietly deducing them.
Sherlock shivered, his mouth parting slightly. He was so turned on it was almost painful. John helped him down to the ground, and placed a pillow under his knees. Sherlock listened intently as John unzipped his trousers, and pulled them down his legs. His breath hitched when he felt Johns thick cock press against his lips. He opened his mouth, and placed his lips around the head. There were already beads of pre cum at the head for him to lick.
“You are wearing a skirt and tights, to be fair.” Rosie chuckled, and nudged his shoulder affectionately.
I shake my head as I feel the nagging thought attempt to spread, causing my every nerve to cease up and panic me.
We don’t need to exchange anymore words, but our lips find their way back to each other without them.
“What if...” John husked, slipping his other hand down the back of Sherlock’s pyjamas. “They saw you coming in your pants like the dirty teenager you are?”
One would have thought a sixteen year old wouldn’t need to be told to share, but Sherlock had always been a little different.
Sherlock caught johns eye when he looked back up. Johns gaze switched between his lips and eyes before the slighter boy broke the gaze, and went into the kitchen.
John looked up at him with dark eyes, his cheeks flushed with arousal. Sherlock’s whimpers were tearing down his walls of defence. He couldn’t resist Sherlock’s begging, he’d never been able to. He smirked as he covered Sherlock’s body with his, and pressed their lips together. It was sticky, and sweet, both of them tasting like whipped cream and chocolate.
“Maybe I am.” I mutter as I hiss out the lie. “Maybe I am ordinary. Maybe you... are smarter than me.”
An empty bed. An empty coffin. An empty promise that he was coming home. Charlie Clark’s body hadn’t been found. No more car games, no more snoring. John never thought he’d miss the snoring, but it was painfully quiet now without him. Charlie wasn’t the first soldier to be lost, and he wouldn’t be the last. John had lost friend after friend. He didn’t think he could bare to see another one die. As he sat on his bunk, something Mycroft had said to him years ago came to mind.
“I’m gonna make you cum just from this....” John whispered, his voice low and husky. “Then I’m gonna fuck you long and hard...”
Sentiment... not something I am used to feeling, but I’m also not used to other people expressing it towards me. Perhaps that’s why I find myself whispering the same words back to him.
I waste no time in excusing myself for ‘an important phone call’ and following in Sherlock’s footsteps to the break room.
Sherlock sat himself on the toilet lid, tapping his fingers on his knee as he waited. John came back a moment later carrying a chair which he set down beside the now three quarters filled bath.
Mycroft startled Sherlock when he lunged across the table so much so that both he and the jam fell to the floor.
Sherlock would always consider John groaning like that as the hottest sound he’d ever heard. The broad teen settled in to a rhythm, careful not to go too fast as Sherlock adjusted to his size.
“I loved her dearly, but she did drive me bonkers. Though, I suppose that’s all mother in laws.” Mrs Holmes chuckled.
I let out a quiet whimper, but John definitely hears it, I can tell that much by the grin that appears on his face.
“Must do something about your hair. Martha, could you sought her out? Maybe put her in a nice frock?” Mrs Holmes said, her eyes drawn to her daughter’s curls which had already sprung up again.
He inhaled the smoky air, breathing it down, warming his insides. He put his feet together, and brought his hand to his head in a parting salute.
They spent the rest of their day dosed on painkillers, drank litres of water, all the while Irene just sat back and enjoyed watching them suffer.
My legs feel as though they’re about to give up, and become one with the floor as his words are whispered in to my ear as a raspy husk.
John eagerly followed the taller teenager into the hall, and up the stairs. There were four doors along the corridor. The furthest one along had a sign that read ‘consider whether what you need is worth knocking for.’ John guessed this was Sherlock’s room. Sherlock moved around him to open the the door, brushing up against John as he did. Sherlock stood aside to allow John through, then closed the door behind them. There was a single bed, unmade, a desk, it’s surface scattered with papers, a few clothes here and there, and a collection of odd items strewn about, such as deer antlers, and conical flasks. They were kinda hard to miss.
Johns words sent shivers down Sherlock’s spine, and blood to his groin. He looked up at John and batted his dark lashes at him as he swallowed around his cock.
“Oh god yes. Keep going!” Sherlock panted out, breathing heavily as he tugged at the soft roots of johns hair.
“No. How could I have? I didn’t know you were here till five minutes ago.” Mike chuckled, looking between both boys.
“I love you... and I want to have this experience with you. I only hesitated when I thought we wouldn’t have time to...”
John grinned as he watched the brunette squirm under his touch, his eyes closing, his hands gripping the bed sheets. Sherlock was turned on to the point of painful, his cock throbbing between his legs. John kissed all the way down to his pubic bone, pausing to suck the skin in to his mouth.
“Sherlock...” he groaned low in his throat, his hand going out to rest on the back of his dark curled head.
When she returned, Mycroft was sat on the floor of the parlour with an asleep Lucy curled up in her lap.
Sherlock did as he was told, and patiently waited for johns next instruction. He felt John right next to him, his warm, minty breath tickling his skin, and turned his head towards the sound of his voice. He yelped when he felt Johns hand on his cock.
Sherlock began to bob his head slowly. After a moment, he hollowed his cheeks, and took about three quarters into his mouth. Normally he’d resort to his hands here, but that wasn’t really an option now. He swirled his tongue around the head, tracing the muscle along the slit, gently grazing the sensitive skin with his teeth.
“Sherlock,” Her mother started. “You have to have a little faith. He’s missing. There’s still hope.”
Sherlock frowned, and shoved the biscuit in her mouth anyway. Tea was poured for the mothers and the two older girls, whereas John and Sherlock had lemonade. Sherlock had zoned out contemplating what would happen if she set up a system of pulleys in Mycroft’s room that would smack her awake with mechanical hands that she hadn’t noticed the gingernuts slowly disappearing. By the time she’d snapped back to reality they’d all been eaten. She grumbled in annoyance, looking down at the plate. She crossed her arms, folded herself up on the chair, and buried her head in between her knees. Everyone else was too caught up in conversation to notice, even Mycroft, who had begun talking at Harriet about the different currencies in various countries, but John noticed. He got up, and walked over to the sulking brunette, who looked up upon noticing his presence. He presented her with the gingernut biscuit he’d been holding on to for the past few minutes.
“In any way that footwear can be nice... yes? Why?” Sherlock asked, rolling over so he was on his stomach to get a better look at the picture.
The brunette did stir, much to John’s delight, and batted his eyelids profusely as he adjusted to the light.
"Of course. She's upstairs. I'll take you up. Mother, Mrs Watson said she'd be by soon. Best for you to entertain her rather than myself."
I internally roll my eyes at my gentle tone. I mustn’t show weakness, not even if what may be the most beautiful individual I’ve ever seen is standing right in front of me... No. No weakness. No... no... I clear my throat, and straighten up. When I hand him the book, my tanned fingers come in to contact with his long, pale digits. I feel my brain threatening to short circuit again, so I quickly retract my hands, and march back to the bubble as fast as I can with my limp. I am fully aware that it’s psychosomatic, but the knowledge of this doesn’t change anything. My doctor cleared me to work, saying when it came to it, it wouldn’t actually physically stop me from doing anything, but you can’t show weakness of any kind in a place like this. No, this is not the kind of job my doctor recommended, but I knew I would lose my mind in any of the places she recommended. Gardening. Really?
It was no longer a warmth, but a blazing heat that made sweat drip down her neck and stick her dress to her skin.
The familiar feeling that accompanies waiting for John to come in for his night shift comes around once again.
He moved towards Sherlock, only to have the younger boy throw himself into his arms, and crumple in a heap.
His mum came bustling into the hallway, her knitting clutched in her hands, undoubtedly another scarf or hat for Harry, which would be tossed into her wardrobe, and never seen again. John’s mum was a short, blonde woman on the plump side, with bright green eyes and rosy cheeks, which were often stained with tears, his sister’s doing. Harry had been at the drink since she got her first fake ID at 15. Some days she was perfectly fine, and was relatively content. Those were the days she was sober. Then there were the days she would drink herself to sleep. She would hurl abuse, throw things, and lock herself in her room for hours on end. Then of course there were days when she wasn’t there at all. She could disappear for days, then tumble back through the door, reeking of vodka, without so much as a simple explanation. It tore his mother to pieces. It wasn’t exactly easy for him either. They used to be close. She used to look after him, and watch out for him. Now, she acted like he wasn’t even there. John quickly pushed these thoughts aside, desperate for his mother not to notice the tears brimming in his eyes.
“But... the children are worth it, aren’t they, Mycroft?” Mrs Holmes cut in, raising her eyebrows at her eldest.
“Too smart for your own good.” I believe was the expression he used. “You need to stop running your mouth, and start running away from the thugs that are beating you up.”
She bit down on her lip so hard she drew blood, but she didn’t even notice, her focus entirely on the agonising burning from between her legs.
“You know I don’t even watch TV when you’re not here?” Sherlock chuckled as he curled up in the crook of John’s arm.
“I’m going to touch you... and pinch you... tease you...” John snarled in his ear. “Till you’re a whimpering mess, begging for my cock.”
“Then don’t jump out of alleyways. Talk to me in school, or friend me on social media like a normal person.”
She explained what she was doing to Mrs Watson, and she gave her the first aid kit from on top of one of the kitchen cupboards. She walked back to the living room slowly, bracing herself. Was she ready to see johns souvenirs from war?
“Fuck.” He hisses before quickly buttoning his trousers back up. “Oh shit, it’s Rosie. Come in.” He beckons to her, turning himself in the chair so that hopefully, I’m blocked from her view.
I can practically see the smug smile spread out on his ostrich-Esk face as he leans back in his chesterfield, his feet propped up on the matching footstool, cigarette between his fingers.
He was close, so close, his erection throbbing, his whole body convulsing and spasming in intense pleasure.
His chest is rising and falling steadily, his Adam’s Apple bobbing as he swallows, and his heart is beating away like a rapid drum. It’s just too tempting an offer to resist. I slowly dip my head, and press my lips against his milky white skin.
That was when John stopped entirely. He wanted the first time he saw her come apart to be when he was inside her.
Sherlock rolled back under the covers, and buried his face in the pillows as resisting John in his rugby uniform was a less than favoured task of his.
I tried to make this as realistic as possible, awkward and bumpy. As their relationship progresses, i’ll have them settle in to themselves, e.g. John will become more dominant. Also, I don’t believe that having a discussion about boundaries and rules is a mood killer. It’s important.
Sherlock smirked over her teacup at her niece when the small child’s face reappeared, a piece of pink tissue paper balanced atop her head.
I grin at his confidence, and suddenly feel all giddy when I think about how his confidence is not misplaced.
“I could hide it in here somewhere... no, wait, that won’t work, because the guards have no reason to search your bunk... could be a random search I guess... wait, no I hid this in here four days ago, and even you didn’t notice.”
John was out of breath when he finished. He’d never confessed his love for Sherlock not out loud, not even to Sherlock himself. His mother was quiet, but maybe that’s because he hadn’t given her a chance to respond. Maybe it was because she was angry, ashamed, disappointed-
It was fast, and hot, desperate and passionate. Sherlock couldn’t even begin to fathom the ungodly noises that were coming out of his mouth now as John fucked him. John was thrusting his hips with abandon, hitting Sherlock’s prostate again and again.
“You’re a life saver. I normally have help, but the nurse is on sick leave, and no one bothered to find me a replacement.” Dr Hooper says as she hands over a first aid kit.
That’s how Sherlock joined the police. In fact, he made up his own job and became the world’s only consulting detective.
Sherlock’s desperate begs caught Johns attention, and the blond went back to furiously jerking his wrist up and down the other boy’s length. He moved his hips faster, hitting Sherlock’s prostate with every move.
“I’m five and a half.” Sherlock said, her attention splitting between Mrs Watson and their surroundings.
John felt his emotions pin balling around in his head, dipping and circling like the craziest roller coaster he’d ever had the endeavour of riding.
Even though this is completely staged, I find myself obligated to avoid my normal tendency to obstinate, and obey instead.
Every time one of them missed, they took a swig. After the first few misses, the gaps between swigs got a lot shorter.
“Correct. So... what is your favourite kind of music?” I ask, desperate to get back to the previous vibe.
New job. First day at a new job. That’s what I have to look forward to. That’s why I’ll get out of bed. That’s why I’ll get through today. I repeat this to myself as I climb out of bed, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast and drive to work. I can do this. I can do this.
I quickly clean up the floor and myself before heading back out in to the corridor. I look down at my watch.
“I can’t believe how much you’ve grown. Such a beautiful girl you’ve become. Now run along, your mother will be looking for you.”
“I do believe you’re right... about that...” Sherlock groaned as he raised his arms for John to pull his shirt over his head.
The bell rang before Sherlock had a chance to blurt out anything. He walked away, but remained in earshot for a moment.
John said casually before getting to his feet, leaving a whining Sherlock behind. Although he was desperate to get back to Sherlock, the idea of having him sat there, a horny mess, not allowed to cum, was worth the wait. He took his sweet time, actively trying to piss about. He paused to have a drink, and even took the time to water the plants. Sherlock was probably going insane by this point. John finally snapped, too turned on to loiter in the kitchen anymore. He walked over to the freezer, and retrieved the frozen cubes of lube he’d set last night. He’d read about it on the internet, and he couldn’t wait to try it on Sherlock. He was only grateful it wasn’t summer, and no one had accidentally used them as actual ice cubes. He had no idea how he was going to explain that one. He wandered back in to the bedroom, and smirked at the sight before him. Sherlock was sat on the bed, legs spread wide, bottle of lube cast aside, fingers buried deep inside himself. His eyes were screwed shut, teeth gritted, short, strangled moans escaping him. John could tell he was close. He was so focused on pleasuring himself he didn’t even notice john was in the room. John almost didn’t want to announce his presence, quite content just observing the arousing display before him. He watched with hungry eyes as his cock throbbed desperately.
“That guard on the way in.” He tilts his head in Johns direction... “you’re wearing his aftershave.”
“Nnngghh! Ahh! Oh!” Sherlock yelped, thumping one of his fists on the door as Johns tip brushed his prostate.
Sherlock was sat in the dining room with Mrs Watson whilst a nurse saw to John’s wounds. Sherlock would have been happy to continue, but Mrs Watson said she couldn’t ask that of her. She didn’t like the nurse. May Darson. Sherlock had never allowed jealousy to affect her, but she found herself glaring daggers at the redhead through the window whenever she pulled up on her bike.
The videos were cartoons of stick men like figures in black and white, with bad puns, and slapstick comedy. Sherlock found them rather amusing, although most of his laughter was caused by John, who giggled, yes giggled, at nearly every clip. After they’d watched all 11, they were both out of breath from laughing. They collapsed backwards on Sherlock’s bed, still giggling and wheezing. Sherlock turned to look at John, who had his eyes closed as he tried to catch his breath. He looked so wonderful when he was laughing. Sherlock wanted to be the one to make him laugh. John turned to face him, tears of joy brimming in his eyes.
He turned to look at Coach Davis. Now, Sherlock was normally never intimidated, but Coach Davis was built like a tank, and Sherlock was built like a noodle.
Sherlock watched closely as John pulled down one of his socks to show her a scare about three inches long down his knee.
Sherlock squealed indignantly, scrabbling to keep the sheet wrapped around his waist, as if modesty was any concern of his.
He pulls my shirt up and dips his head before sucking on the taut skin over my stomach. “And at least you’ll know.”
John nodded, and moved over to allow Sherlock to sit beside him. She unraveled some bandages, and opened up a packet of gauze.
I’ll delve into Sherlock and John’s relationship more in the following chapters. Also, how smutty do you lot want this? Let me know ;)
John continued kissing him hungrily as the brunette’s nimble fingers made short work of the buttons on his chocolate stained shirt.
Sherlock pulled his dark blue coat up around himself as they walked through the streets to the police station. The pair wandered in to the station, and waited for an officer to come over to them.
Keys in the door alerted their attention. Hair in a messy bun, eyes shielded by sunglasses, a loose fitting shirt hanging off her frame; Molly stood in the door way.
Sherlock allowed her eyes to wander him fully for the first time. It was then that she noticed the bandages on his shoulder and his leg.
Sherlock wrapped a sheet around himself before getting to his feet, and trailing after John to the front door.
John obliged, and sat down to allow Sherlock to curl up on his chest, and drink his milk. Johns theory of why Sherlock seemingly turned into an infant was because his brain was constantly whirling, never stopping for a moment, that when he was drunk, his brain went back to very basic functions. In short, his brain took a break.
He’s always on the alert, like a meerkat, looking around him, deducing, the cogs in his head constantly turning about.
I have a long wait till I need to meet John, and each of those hours goes by achingly slowly, my job of turning soil doing very little to occupy me.
John placed his hand on the small of her back, and steered her over towards the shop she was so eager to get to.
“Thank you so much, Sherlock. I love it.” Sherlock’s cheeks turned pink, and she hid her head in her curls. She turned her attention to the neatly wrapped package in her lap. A beautiful telescope with ornate patterns swirling up and down the length. Sherlock was in awe. Before she could really think about what she was doing, she had leapt forward, and wrapped her arms around John. He was surprised to say the least, but allowed his arms to wrap around the narrow girl, and hug her back.
He felt Sherlock’s whole body seize up suddenly, a long, drawn out whine escaping him. A wet sensation spread to the front of his jeans. Sherlock had cum all over himself, his ejaculate soaking both their jeans. Sherlock stilled completely, his breathing shaky. He looked so small as he sat in John’s lap, clearly embarrassed about what had happened.
Harriet gave Sherlock a knowing smile before steering her mother out of the room. Sherlock raised the phone to her ear with a shaking hand.
Hope you guys enjoy this. I hope it’s not too out of character for Sherlock. Mycroft did once say he was a very emotional child on the show, so... also, he and John talk about their feelings in the next chapter. ;)
“Are you wearing two pairs of underwear?” John asked curiously, pulling back to glance down between them.
Sherlock clambered out the side, and wrapped himself in his towelling dressing gown. John followed suit, and wrapped himself up before trailing after Sherlock in to the living room. The pair settled down in the front room, all curled up on the sofa. As they sat, Sherlock pondered how his day had started with an act that should have left him incredibly embarrassed, and ended with him making out with John in the bathtub. The universe works in strange ways, he thought, a quote made by someone who would probably curse him for applying it to his pig’s ear of a day.
“One, You look way too happy, two, you’re sneaking back in the early hours of the morning, and three, an innocent person would have just flat out said ‘no, I didn’t.”
“No, I mean why are you here now? I thought you were going to John’s.” He said through gritted teeth.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, and reached for a biscuit. A chocolate bourbon. Sherlock held it with shaky hands before putting it back down, and eating a custard cream.
There’s nothing that pleases me more than seeing a soaking wet Sherlock on my bed, hair all awry, fresh out of the shower.
“Such a drama queen. Anyway, you don’t have to worry now. He’ll probably stay in there till tomorrow evening.”
He said, shaking the hand of his Field Marshal. John knew he should be happy at being promoted, but it was meaningless. Sure, he had more privileges, but did it really mean anything? He was still just a soldier, fighting in a war. Away from his family. Away from Sherlock. God, he missed her.
My wrists were cuffed, and I was lead out of the house. They pushed my head down as they loaded me in to the car although I doubt it was to avoid hitting my head on the door. Like they care. I closed my eyes, and leant my head on the window as we drove, the quiet whirring of the engine and the chatter of the officers in the front of the car doing little to keep my entertained.
John didn’t mean for his eyes to wander, but he couldn’t help but notice that the rosy cheeked child he use to play chess with was becoming a young woman. He adverted his eyes before she noticed, her attention on the tea leaves at the bottom of her cup.
He had no idea how much time had passed. He wasn’t sure if that made the hours go by faster or slower. He did after all, have plenty of time to figure that one out.
I shuffle my hips a little to try and accommodate him better. It helps a bit, and helps to reduce the twinge in my back.
John felt his blood rushing to his cock, his jeans suddenly uncomfortably tight. Sherlock looked so gorgeous.
“Yes I’m fine. I just wanted to see you.” I shrug, suddenly feeling sheepish under his intense stare, the mind of stare that makes my knees go weak, and my insides turn to jelly.
I state honestly as I begin to walk back to my bunk. Lestrade follows me down to the dorm, asking a few questions, primarily about my ‘confrontation’ with the librarian.  “I hear there are going to be new guards. Am I correct?”
That something ended up being john’s shoulder as the blond pushed himself further inside Sherlock’s tight passage.
When his vision returned to him, he could see John sat in front of him, restraint key in hand. He felt a rush of adrenaline as his gaze landed on what was binding his wrists together. Black, leather handcuffs. Handcuffs were his favourite, closely followed by blindfolds. Both at the same time was pure heaven. He loved being tortured, completely at John’s mercy.
I have no frame of reference, but from what I know about the science of kissing, it reached the stated expectations.
He scrunches his brows; confusion, one of the easiest expressions to read. Perhaps it’s that, or maybe I have just witnessed it more due to the number of individuals I have rendered baffled. Having said that, I have been informed that I rub people up the wrong way all the time, and the look of ‘extremely pissed off’ is still one that is lost on me.
The first inch or two was always difficult, and it usually resulted in Sherlock leaving claw marks down John’s back. But he was a little tied up for that, and instead pulled his arms forward, rattling the headboard. John kept his gaze firm, but he was cautious as he adjusted himself. He kept his weight on his arms, positioned either side of Sherlock’s head. Said boy was gazing up at him in adoration. He was completely immersed in the moment. The only thing he saw was John. John, with his dark gaze, tousled hair, muscles glistening with sweat. Sherlock felt completely safe. He relaxed after a moment as his body grew more accustomed to John’s movements.
She left down the corridor leaving Sherlock to state after her. When she returned, there was a maroon dress draped over arms.
Normally when sherlock asked people about their lives he zoned out, and their responses ended up resembling the noise packman made when he died, but he actually listened to John.
“Shame. Your mothers gooseberry jam is to... die for...” John trialed off, eyes flickering round the garden.
While in the outside that may not seem like a long time, but this place has a way of slowing everything down.
Sherlock began to walk around the room as he spoke. “Orange lipstick? Who wears orange lipstick? Jillian obviously, and one of her male coworkers... do you follow? No of course you don’t.” He quipped before the officer could answer.
After a few more precious minutes, I return Sherlock to his dorm with the solum reminder that I will actually have to write him a shot.
Johns lips were on his, desperately kissing him, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth. His hips were rolling against his, grinding down on him. John wanted him, he needed him. The hard, generous appendage between his leg advertised this. Next, his lips were on his neck, sucking and biting on his alabaster skin, leaving dark purple bruises. Sherlock was moaning as his neck was abused, his head thrown back in bliss. John moved his hands down sherlock’s body, and pulled his shirt over his head. The blond begun trailing kisses down his chest, drawing moans of appreciation from the other boy.
“Sentiment? Who are you, and what have you done with my Sherlock?” John laughed as the brunette buried her face in his neck.
“Sherlock... I need to... be able to... see what I’m doing.” John chuckled as Sherlock kissed him desperately.
John had eventually caved, and taken Sherlock up on the idea of staying with him. He didn’t dare go back home, so the pair had gone straight from the hospital, to Sherlock’s house. Sherlock felt a small sense of pride in that John trusted him, not Rosie, and it was his house John was staying at.
“I’m a high functioning sociopath, so... anyway, what do you want to do?” He asked after a moment of silence, getting up from his chair.
This close, I can feel the warmth radiating of off him, along with the familiar scent of his aftershave.
She grins at me, then exits the room, leaving me alone with the notion that this was an extremely bad idea.
Sherlock closed her eyes, unable to look in to John’s any longer, unable to see the horrors playing out behind them.
I shouldn’t be surprised he knows all of this. Like myself, he can read a persons’ occupation in their hands, and their marital status in their clothes.
Mr Holmes had said goodbye to her before he’d left for the home guard that morning, but she still needed to say goodby to Mycroft and Lucy. She and John briefly stopped by on the way to the station. Mycroft almost seemed sad to see her little sister go. Sentiment was never something present with Mycroft, and yet her face was definitely more solemn than normal. Lucy was too young to understand, and sat quietly at her aunt’s feet, playing with her shoelaces. They arrived at the station, and quickly bustled on to a train in to town.
We manage to get all the way inside without anybody seeing us, down the corridors and in to the break room.
John gave sherlock the details of the events that followed that evening. When he’d finished, the other boy remained silent.
“Definitely. In fact, we should probably clear out when he gets back. I don’t need you moaning his name stuck in my head again. Worst ear worm ever.”
“Alright. Thank you for the invitation. John will be at rugby pretty much all day anyway, so I’ll be great full for the company. When are we going?”
“Always been good with your mouth, haven’t you baby?” He husked, bucking his hips against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock looked so hot in his little kitten ears. They were a nice, vibrant contrast to the dark curls they were nestled in. He’d put them on as soon as they’d got in, and was just floating around the room with them perched on his head. John was desperately horny, and wanted nothing more than to plow Sherlock in to tomorrow, but unfortunately he’d discovered his paper was due tomorrow, not Tuesday. So, he was buried in his work while Sherlock waited patiently. Well, he was patient up to a point. He’d been waiting now for about an hour, and he’d got bored. John didn’t notice as he slipped a CD in to the stereo, a smooth jazz CD to be precise. The blond looked up immediately, eyebrows raised as he caught sight of his boyfriend. The brunette was facing away from him as he slowly swished his hips from side to side.
She could nothing about the aching sadness that pulled at her heart, and punched her in the stomach.
I frown at him for a moment before grabbing him by the ankles and throwing his legs over my shoulders.
That was the first day John left the house.  He was bound to a wheelchair, but he’d been responding well to physiotherapist, and there was hope he would be walking again within the year. Sherlock had barely left his side. Neither her mother nor Mrs Watson said anything about it, and simply let her do as she pleased. She’d been going to school begrudgingly, then racing back to John. She would be leaving school in a few months anyway, but for now she was stuck. Then of course she’d be off to finishing school, then university. She’d always looked forward to the later, but now the idea of leaving John was almost unbearable. When she got home, John was waiting for her by the back door. They’d originally gone out on the premise of picking gooseberries for Mrs Holmes to make jam, but the amount obtained seemed rather sad, and were now sat having afternoon tea on the lawn. Mycroft was due over any moment with Lucy but she was late as she often was since the arrival of the latter.
Sherlock thought to himself as he made his way over to the kettle, and aggressively threw tea bags in to a pair of mugs.
Sherlock wiped his eyes on his sleeve, and looked up at his favourite teacher, although there wasn’t exactly much competition.
I wearily nod my head against his neck as I support myself against him, traces of his stubble grazing my cheek.
She was tall, and thin, with sandy brown hair in braids resting on her narrow shoulders. Sherlock quickly glanced over at the wiry teen before looking over to the Watsons. All three of them were blonde, Johns was more of an ashy blonde, but regardless, all of them bore a close resemblance. Sherlock and Mycroft could not have looked more different, the only thing they shared being their neuroticism and piercing, blue eyes.
All three of them turned towards the door when they heard two pairs of footsteps. A young girl with braided, blonde hair entered the room first, closely followed by a boy who bore a close resemblance to her, except from his startling, grey eyes.
As John moved his mouth up and down, all the crazy crap Sherlock had done last year sprung to mind. He’d had nothing to do with the Nair in the body wash, albeit he was rather fond of the results, he still wanted to come up with his own prank. A brilliant slash evil plan came to mind as he listened to Sherlock’s cries of pleasure.
Sherlock’s gaze was flickering between his lips and his eyes, their faces getting closer and closer.
We sit for a moment, exchanging hushed whispers of affection, and tentative touches, ranging from lust to love.
He made a series of unearthly noises as he began to work himself open, plunging his finger in and out. John gulped loudly as he sat in awe of the erotic scene before him. He drew a shaky breath as he watched Sherlock add another finger.
After that, she always talked to Sherlock. She’d hadn’t been sure if the pair were just friends until John scored the winning touch down in a game, and ran to the stands to pull Sherlock into a kiss.
“I’m good.” He said calmly. He wouldn’t tell her how much he was suffering. She didn’t need to hear about the sleepless nights, the heartache, the homesick.
“John, stop. You’re going to hurt yourself!” Sherlock yelled as the blond went to kick a rubbish bin.
She smiled weakly at him. He took her hand in his, and squeezed it gently. He still saw her as a child, as she suspected he always would.
He does as I say, a little smirk playing on his face as push his narrow body firmly up against the cold wall.
Sherlock caught sight of John as soon as he entered school. He was talking to a blonde girl, and she was laughing. Sherlock stalked over to them, an uncomfortable nagging feeling in his stomach.
That was the day I got arrested. It was a rather tedious day to be honest, as were the days that followed. It’s worse than tedious now, mind numbingly boring to be more accurate. Is it weird to find prison boring? Yes, probably. The only thing that amuses me is deducing what other people are in her for. It’s intimidating as well, of course. My first night, I’m pretty sure my roommate watched me sleep. Within a week, I’d been given a black eye for being insubordinate to one of the ‘top dogs’. I’ve been threatened, pinned against a wall, called a selection of colourful insults, and been thwacked in the ribs with a very heavy book. My counsellor says I bring it on myself.
“Wipe that pout of your face. You and Rosie have boyfriends, you can just grind with them. Molly and I have hunting to do.”
My abdomen is pulsing, tight and tense, my inner walls all clenching, my raging hard on throbbing almost painfully between us.
Mrs Holmes and Mrs Watson were stood at the bottom of the stairs, looking up at the two youngest children with tear filled eyes. They shared a knowing look witch was only caught by John. He let go of Sherlock as soon as they got to the bottom of the stairs. She didn’t notice, as she soon became the objective of Mrs Hudson’s fussing. A moment later, Mycroft appeared at the stairs. She was dressed in a fishtail gown, her hair was up, and her makeup was immaculate.
The adrenaline filling my body does just as good of a job at providing me with courage as I can imagine an alcoholic beverage would do.
The group turned their heads to see John in the door way juggling a folder, a textbook, and a bottle of wine.
John shook his head, bottom lip chewed between his teeth in frustration as he pressed his head against the door.
The subtle raise of his eyebrows is a gesture not lost on me before he disappears out in to the corridor.
I can just about see her face from here. Her eyes are soft and her lips are chewed in between her teeth as she waits for John’s answer.
“At least now I know why you never fancied me.” She teases lightheartedly, a grin on her face as she squeezes my arm.
Sherlock beamed up at him before reaching for his zipper. John groaned when Sherlock’s long fingers brushed against his raging hard on. John lifted his hips in order for Sherlock to slide his jeans and boxers down his muscular legs, then threw the garments across the room. Sherlock licked his lips when John’s thick cock sprung free, beads of pre-cum leaking from the head, and dripping down his length. Sherlock made sure John was watching as he bent forwards to give it an experimental lick.
John chewed the inside of his cheek. Sherlock rolled on to his front, and sunk in to the water, leaving only his eyes atop the water, watching John like a crocodile as he stripped himself of his soaked garments. John slowly sank in to the water in front of Sherlock before pulling the brunette in to his lap, his long, pale legs straddling his hips. John leant in, and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s wet lips.
The police officer was in his late thirties, with a crooked smile, beady eyes, and was clearly a dickhead.
She’d stayed awake most of the night before, anxious to see John again. She hadn’t seen him since he was 17. He was nearly 21 now. She hadn’t felt like celebrating her own birthday, and the day had just passed by like any other. She’d been too worried about John to do anything about it. She didn’t need to be worried now. He was coming home. She didn’t need to worry. He’d be ok now, wouldn’t he?
“I know I heard. The lady doth make a good point, baby.” John teased before allowing Sherlock to settle back in his lap. “But I love you anyway, you quirky box of fries.”
He only had ten minutes to get down the road to Sherlock’s. He also had to get dressed and eat something. He cleaned himself up, then quickly pulled on a fresh pair of boxers.
April fools. Arguably one of the worst days ever, to the people who lived with Sherlock anyway. The others were all fully aware of Sherlock’s fondness of using his brain for evil. If the opportunity arose to create some drama, Sherlock could almost certainly be found in the middle of it. Everyone was on edge, just waiting for him to strike. He’d started off with simple pranks, switching the salt and sugar, setting people’s phones in jelly; the cliche tricks. But last year, he’d really upped the ante, and now, they were all sat in their living room, waiting for him to strike. John in particular was watching his boyfriend with caution. Said brunette was currently perched on the kitchen island, swinging his legs back and forth in a juvenile fashion.
It’s not a king sized bed in a luxury hotel, there aren’t any candles, there aren’t any roses, we didn’t have a nice dinner, we don’t have any champagne, but I don’t care.
Somewhat gingerly, he slips the elastic waistband of my trousers down over my hips to my ankles. I quickly kick off my shoes and discard the trousers also.
Sherlock wasn’t sure what it was, but he found he felt sad at being called johns friend, but that’s what he was. That’s all he’d ever be. Sherlock cleared his thoughts, and focused on the matter at hand.
On the one hand, I’m pissed as fuck at him because how dare he do this do himself, but on the other... I feel sorry for him.
Mycroft smiled softly, and affectionally squeezed the younger girl’s shoulder. She left for her room, quietly humming ‘sweet Adeline’.
John began moving his mouth up and down sherlock’s length, humming gently. The brunette felt a pressure building in his abdomen.
John had his head thrown back, his eyelids fluttering as Sherlock worked his zipper undone. After some shuffling about, she managed to pull them down his legs. She could see his erection straining against the confines of his cotton briefs clearly now.
“More! More!” She cried, her toes curling, fully aware that she had repeated that word numerous times that night.
The very notion of Sherlock and his little plan has had me all worked up from the moment he mentioned it, and I’m fairly certain I’ve been half hard since.
The dress was perfect. It was a beautiful colour, and it fit almost perfectly. Mycroft was right; John was going to love it.
John couldn’t resist the temptation of assaulting Sherlock’s pale neck, dipping his tongue in to the hollow of his throat.
Sherlock and John have a little alone time, and Sherlock first begins to realise he might have a thing for authority...
I follow her down the corridor and in to the cafeteria. It’s a decent sized room with benches and tables, a serving line, and five dozen inmates at least.
Sherlock is a bit of a dick here. He likes John so much, and it doesn’t even occur to him John feels the same. Hense the ‘dickery’. That’s not a word...
The blond settled into a steady rhythm, burying his cock to a hilt before pulling almost all the way out.
It’s not actually got any force behind it, although I suspect that a real assault from Sherlock would have much the same results.
“So, where was it? Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, or Chilli?” Sherlock asked, his attention going to the boy’s eyes.
“Please john... cum inside me- oh Christ! Fuck... gah! Fill me with your cum!” Sherlock’s desperate howls tipped John over the edge.
Lucy has developed her mother’s obsession for treats, and polished off a whole packet of bourbons last night. Needless to say, Mycroft was not impressed. It may or may not have been my fault... how was I supposed to know she could open tins?
Taking Sherlock to a bar went as well as John expected. He didn’t like most of the alcohol, and refused to dance.
I glare at him, but this only seems to broaden his grin. He falters after a second, and breathes in deeply.
“You don’t have to be here, but here you are. I really appreciate it. And I’m sorry for shouting at you earlier.”
I arch my hips off the cushions to meet his thrusts, and let out a low whine as I murmur words of love back to him.
“Look, I’ve wanted you for a long time, the only thing that had me deterred was the knowledge that I wouldn’t be able to hold you afterwards, kiss you gently, tell you how much I love you...”
“Thank you for the biscuits. I’m sorry I couldn’t send you anything direct. Unless you’d like bullet shells, or a pack of cards.”
Sherlock bit back a moan, his bottom lip chewed between his teeth, eyes squeezed shut as he tried to fend off his impending orgasm.
John grinned when he felt Sherlock’s cock twitch against his knee, and his nails rake his skin. Another smack came, and Sherlock yelled louder.
“I ummm... do you know what we need to do now?” John asks cautiously, gently dragging his fingers down the column of my spine...
I go to nod my head, but find my neck rigid in place, my body clearly acting on an impulse my incredibly swift brain is yet to run through my thought processes. Sometimes I have difficulty keeping up with it.
“Yes, yes. Do it again. Don’t you dare stop this time.” She groaned as she pulled him back down to her.
“Ok, just you four left. Mary, visitation room; Adler, cafeteria; Donovan, Kitchen, and Watson, I want you in the bubble in B dorm.”
“Actually, apparently there’s a batch of new guards coming today. Knight overheard Lestrade talking about it.”
Sherlock drew up a list of names she liked, the fact that she’d rather a boy made very clear by her handful of girl names as opposed to the large number of boy names.
“Oh!” The brunette yelped when he felt John take his throbbing cock into his warm, wet mouth. “Oh John... mmm!”
So here I lie, alone. Alone, locked in solitary confinement. Well, that is generally what is meant by solitary confinement. It is a special gift to be alone surrounded by people...
John shrugged off Sherlock's neuroticism, and turned his attention to the plate of waffles that had just been put in front of him.
Sherlock and John get interrupted, the former gives the latter a little gift to compensate, and the possibility of moving their relationship to the next level present itself.
Sherlock was pressed up against the window, small patches of condensation forming where she was breathing.
It took Sherlock a moment, but once he was accustomed to the weird sensation of having johns cock in his mouth, he began to bob his head up and down. He had about two thirds of Johns cock in his mouth when he felt the tip hit the back of his throat. He moved his head back momentarily, not wanting to gag, but continued his rhythm after a short pause. It was becoming a rather pleasant experience him, his arousal spiking, his nerves tingling. He was achingly hard himself, but he wouldn’t allow that to distract him from John, who was defiantly finding this more than pleasant. He was in ecstasy, head thrown back, moans of pleasure racking his body.
John had remained quiet throughout the exchange, simply enjoying the view, but Sherlock still needed to be punished properly.
“I guess everything will be like that when we get out. Going to bed whenever, eating at six o’clock, wearing what we want...” mike sighs.
Both boys grumbled their responses. She let them wake themselves up a bit more before asking any questions.
I have to pull away so I don’t choke on the mouthful I’ve already obtained, my eyes watering at the sheer velocity and magnitude of the fluid.
John gripped Sherlock’s shoulders tightly as he reached his high. Spurts of white liquid shot out the end of his cock as he orgasmed, straight down Sherlock’s throat. Being rather experienced now, he took it all without gagging, swallowed, then sat back to wipe his mouth. John was breathing heavily, his eyes fluttering as he came back down.
Officer Mary is stood before me holding a pair of blue jeans, a navy jumper, and a pair of sneakers.
At the table, Sherlock and John had been throwing peas at each other trying to catch them in their mouths. Harriet had found it amusing, where as Mycroft spent the entire time with her eyes rolled.
Johns voice breaks me from my thoughts, and despite nearly all of my worries centring around him, the second I look up at him, it all melts away.
“Oh yeah. See that redhead over there?” She asked, pointing to a girl sipping on a Cosmo at the bar.
John nearly came in his pants at Sherlock’s words, a strangled moan escaping him. The brunette in question was eyeing John intently, wiggling his hips suggestively as he waited for john’s answer. His chest was heaving, his cheeks were flushed, eyes wide, lips wet and sticky.
“No.” She said suddenly. “No, John. You killed him, yes. But you did it because you had to. You’re not a murderer. He would have killed you.”
He sounds partially confused at what’s happening, but mostly he’s overwhelmed by pleasure, that much I can tell by the way his eyes are rolling about in his skull.
Sherlock didn’t bother waiting for any more information. She ran out of the house without her shoes, or a coat, ignoring the chill down her spine, and the rocks under her feet. She knocked frantically on the door till the housekeeper came to let her in.
“Honestly, I was waiting for them to shoot me during that god awful matinee of Les Miserables. If I have to listen to one more reprise of the same bloody tune with different lyrics...” He grumbled as he stalked round the house, his rich blue dressing gown twisting about in his wake.
If nothing else, Sherlock’s birds’ nest of hair was a dead give away on what they’d been up to, that and the dark blemishes covering his entire neck and torso.
John pushed himself all they way forwards this time, his sharp hipbones pressing in to Sherlock’s soft body.
He leans back, and nods his head. He’s not crying anymore, so I suppose that’s a good thing. He grimaces after a pause, and looks down between us.
Sherlock watched with wide eyes as John unzipped his trousers, and slid them down to his ankles. He felt his breath hitch when he saw John’s pulsing member spring free.
“Nothing babe.” Sherlock said calmly as he sipped his tea. “Well, obviously I’ve done things, but the matter on which I assume you are asking about; no, I haven’t done anything.”
I wait not so patiently for lights out, but manage to keep still for the remaining 56 minutes till I can see John. I spot him in the bubble already, doing a cross word to pass the time, the same way I am doing by counting the number of threads on the back of the stitched writing on the label of my pyjama trousers.
John kissed him full on the mouth, gliding his tongue along, but not parting his lips. He pulled back to grip the base of his pulsing, red cock, and line himself up with Sherlock’s entrance. After a quick look up at Sherlock, John tantalisingly slowly sank his thick cock into his channel.
Sherlock whipped his head round to see a girl standing at the end of the aisle, clearly staring at his outfit.
“When no one talks to you, you use your own ways of finding out stuff about them. I forget that I don’t need to do that all the time.”
I clock out, then head back down the corridor. Thankfully, it doesn’t seem like anyone has been down here.
“Mmmmm, we could got to our room, but in there, we’ll just be too tempted to have sex. Out here, we’ll just stick to making out.” John said with a grin, turning to look at the blonde girl. She made a face at him, and went to get something out of the fridge. Sherlock went bright pink, and buried his head in John shoulder.
“I trust you to be sensible. I won’t say anything more about it now, but if you want to talk, I’m here.”
“I suppose he needs some time to get use to me.” John chuckled, but his voice was a little strained. “Is he like you with strangers?”
John makes this decision for me as he brings his hands down to my ass and begins pulling me towards him with rapid vigour.
His eyes we’re screwed shut, and his face was all wrinkly. Being blasted through the birth canal will do that to you.
“Oh he didn’t try to, he succeeded. He’s been in the system a long time... No clue how he ended up in minimum.”
Every movement reminded her that there was actual life inside her, life that was half hers, half John’s.
Not to sound pretentious, but it’s like all my skin is on fire, and the only thing that will quench that burning is John.
He takes a moment, then returns his attention to me, a look of pure lust on his face as he allows his eyes to roam my exposed, nude body.
Sherlock looked up at him with puppy dog eyes, his bottom lip glistening with salvia, and chewed between his teeth.
Sorry this took a while, things have been busy, and I’ve had a touch of writers block... hope you enjoy!
John walked through the door and in to his living room with the intention of watching television, but the look on his father’s face said otherwise.
I realise he does have a point. The signs were there, I just didn’t see them. I didn’t want to see them.
Although Sherlock had already worn his new clothes to one of his lectures last week, and that was all well received, this was a rugby game. The atmosphere here was a little different to a bunch of nerds listening to a ninety year old professor ramble on about carbon. Rosie didn’t want to leave him on his own.
Watson. It had been a long time since anyone had called him John. He turned his head, and saw the colonel standing beside a boy.
The sight of him coming undone and the intense heat of his spasming channel clamping around me just pushes me over the edge.
He finished checking me about five minutes ago. Now he’s just holding me, and stroking my hair. It’s nice.
“Yeah. There’s a little bit left, but ummm... ugh, we’ll have to get more later.” John grumbled as he threw his head back on the pillows, pulling a defeated Sherlock down with him.
Sherlock stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, unsure whether John was mad at him or not. The pair ate their dinner, the atmosphere clearly having changed. There was a lot of unspoken tension, questions, and answers floating in the air. Although all the topics were brought about by Sherlock, John was more than happy to respond. The distance between the pair had increased, and were sat on either ends of the sofa instead of in the middle, another sign of the awkward situation. John put the telly on again, a sitcom about a police department. Sherlock found the jokes and humour rather enjoyable, and did his best to pay attention.
Sherlock had finished off his homework faster than he’d thought, and had dragged Rosie with him down to watch John’s game. The pair were stood in the stands at John’s rugby game, dosed on coffee and chocolate biscuits. It was crisp and cold in the early spring morning, and Sherlock’s new skirt was very doing little to keep him warm, even with John’s rugby jumper paired with it. He blew air into his hands, and placed his face between them.
“I do.” She said sadly, fiddling with the hem of her dress, trying not to think about the three unanswered letters she’d sent.
Sherlock nodded, a smile playing on his lips. John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s, and began to move it up and down.
If so, how do I tell her I’m not interested without upsetting her. I can’t tell her I’m seeing someone without inviting questions I can’t answer.
She still didn’t say anything, but this time it was because she knew that if she tried to speak, sobs would wrack her throat, and make any words she managed to get out unintelligible.
“I tested to see by how much a turtles’ reaction time would increase if it was dosed on caffeine, and by how much it would decrease when dosed on alcohol.”
Sherlock returned to his room after a quick shower, clothes hanging off his damp form, hair wet, towel around his shoulders. When he opened the door, John had his head pressed against the wall.
Sherlock jumped, and wrapped his legs around johns waist. Josh pinned him to the wall adjacent to the door with his hips, keeping Sherlock trapped between the wall and his muscular body.
“Fucking do it again!” Sherlock exclaimed, bringing both hands up to cup johns face and pull him in to a sloppy kiss.
“Agh!” Sherlock yelped, his eyes flying open as he felt one of Johns fingers probing at his entrance.
I manage to peel my eyes open, and take a quick glance at John, his face contorted in pleasure, eyes screwed shut.
We’re standing very close to each other now, our chests are centimetres apart, our hips are touching, our faces close as we breathe each other’s air.
We pull apart, and go about retrieving our clothes. I stand up to reach for my shoes, but almost immediately topple over and fall back down on to the cushions.
“Well he’s pissed alright. He’d put Anna Nichole Smith to shame at this rate.” John remarked as the boy in question was attempting to climb him like a koala.
“The same way I know that your limp isn’t a genuine one, it’s psychosomatic. The events in which you obtained your injury were traumatic; Wounded in action.”
John offered a still trembling Sherlock a hand, and carefully helped him in to the bath. It was warm and soothing on his skin, the herbal sent of the lavender bubble bath relaxing him further. John sat himself in the chair and let Sherlock rest his head on his thigh. They sat like that for a moment whilst John relayed stories of his trip, and Sherlock listened eagerly.
Before she knew it, John was on a bus to the station, and she was back inside, knowing that the only eternity she would experience would be the wait before John came home.
His breathing is harsh and laboured, and his heart his thrumming away so harshly I can feel it in my bones.
“Honestly, labels don’t mean shit. I just want you. It doesn’t matter whether you’re either gender, neither, inbetween, or undecided. I like you. Sherlock Holmes.”
“Sure. But no, he’s not home. Door knocker’s to the side. He left before I went to school, and hasn’t been back since.”
“John, I need you so bad.” He groaned seductively, lifting his hips up, and grinding them against john’s pelvis.
She was four months gone now, and each day that passed, was another day that John wasn’t home to experience it with her.
“We’ll tell you about it now, and she can find out later.” His mother said as she beckoned him to sit down.
She spun around, and there, standing at the gate, was John. He was standing up, his wheelchair no where to be seen.
“Well, the game itself is of very little interest to me, just people running around a muddy field... but you...” Sherlock rambled. “You have a technique that seems to work out in your favour-“
“If you don’t mind.” Sherlock furrowed her brows at John’s manner, but didn’t pay it much attention.
“He wants his mother.” She said softly, kind eyes regarding the dark haired girl in the bed. “I think he’s hungry.”
“Ah! Ah! Ah!” Sherlock groaned as John rammed his cock further inside him with each buck of his hips.
John brought his hands down to curl in sherlock’s hair, yanking softly, making the brunette moan around his cock.
His eyes quickly snap back up to meet mine. They’re slightly wider than before, and his pupils are dilated. Physical attraction.
“Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?” The older boy asked, looking at John through the wavy fringe that had fallen over his eyes, which made him look somehow even more scary.
Sherlock had been looking forward to school for one of the first days in a long time. He actually had a friend. He had people he considered friendly acquaintances, and although he didn’t mind their company, he wouldn’t seek them out. John was different.
P.P.S if there’s anything you’d like me to write that I haven’t put on there, I’m open to suggestions.
“Are you sure you wanna do this?” John asks as he slips a warm, calloused hand up my shirt, running his pinkie finger down my side, eliciting goose bumps across my pale skin.
