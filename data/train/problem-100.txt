"Hello, Mr. Uyehara. This is the new student John." Sherlock said proudly, gesturing towards his new friend.
"Oy you two, get a room. It's only been half a day and you're already flirting with each other." Mike said and took a sip of his soda deviously. Sherlock's face turned red and he saw John's turn an even darker shade.
“Of course, love. Anything.” Sherlock felt like an infant in John’s arms, but that didn’t matter right now. All that mattered was that he was loved and John was always going to be there for him, no matter what.
"Please sir, Captain Watson I need more". Deciding to give Sherlock what he was desperately pleading for, he inserted a third finger. Being an army doctor and knowing his way around a body, he brushed his prostate, teasing him. Sherlock let out a sharp cry and his head fell back, his curls falling on his face.
John was lucky and he knew, god he knew, how lucky he was to have a life where he had accomplished so much. A soldier and now the boyfriend of the best, and only, consulting detective in the world. Lucky indeed. A vision of a future was starting to materialize in John’s imagination. A future that included growing old with Sherlock and never leaving each other’s sides. It was as if John had known Sherlock his whole life. Almost nothing was as significant as meeting and falling in love with Sherlock. Nothing could even compare. Sherlock was the most important thing in John’s life.
"Yes please, Daddy. I need it now." Sherlock whined. John slapped his arse again and saw the redness swell up right before his eyes. He positioned himself over Sherlock and slowly pushed himself in. Sherlock's moaning and cursing were beautiful music to John's ears and he pushed in a bit more.
"God, oh my- Christ that's good. You're such a good boy." John panted, sweat now dripping down his face. His hands were resting on the top of Sherlock's head, running his hands through the dark, silky curls. Sherlock went down once a more, this time flicking his tongue at John's balls and then trailing it the whole way back up until he reached the tip again.
person?” Sherlock said cocking his head to one side and grinning down at John. He realized what he said and blushed profusely. He took a sip of his wine and looked away quickly to cover it up, but he knew Sherlock had seen.
"Get out now John! I can't have you here right now. I just can't. You betrayed my trust and I just can't." Sherlock looked so desperate and helpless, sitting there on the ground with tears streaming down his face. He looked like the frightened teenager must have, all those years ago. Sitting in a chair in a bright room being poked and prodded and jabbed. John's heart ached when he thought of what Sherlock must have gone through.
"You don't think half the people here already know? You've been staring at John at any chance you get and blushing at the mention of his name." Greg wiggled his eyebrows.
"Real mature, John. I'll get the milk sometimes. Deal?" John positioned himself so that he was on top of Sherlock and had his head resting on Sherlock's chest.
“Shh keep your voice down, mate. It’s supposed to be a surprise!” John whispered, remembering that Sherlock wasn’t that far away.
"On my way. SH" John had to laugh at this situation. They had just sexted and now Sherlock was coming home to be fucked. John decided that a change of wardrobe was appropriate. He thought about wearing his army uniform, but it would take too long to get off. Instead, he chose a thin dressing gown and plopped himself down on the bed to wait for Sherlock.
John put his hand to his head and sighed. Whatever Sherlock had in mind, it wasn’t good. He was going to get himself seriously hurt or even killed if John wasn’t there to keep his emotions in check. John had always taken a huge amount of pride in the fact that he knew how to calm Sherlock down, how to make sure he wasn’t about to make a rash decision. Of course, this only helped as much as Sherlock allowed it to. And sometimes, he would take off running and make John feel like he didn’t even exist. This preyed on John’s insecurities and worry that Sherlock would find someone better than him. Someone who could better match him at an intellectual level: someone
"Sherlock?" John said gently nudging his shoulder. John hated waking Sherlock up since he rarely got enough sleep, but John needed food and he wanted Sherlock to come try out a new Thai restaurant a few miles away from the flat. Sherlock stirred and opened his eyes sleepily. "Would you like to go get dinner with me?" John asked hopefully.
“We’re together. As a couple.” John said as normally as he could. Harry practically exploded. “You’re what!? I’m only now just finding out about this?”
"John, my pants are getting a bit too tight for my liking." Sherlock groaned. John immediately unclipped Sherlock's belt and pulled down his trousers. He rid himself of the robe; tossing it somewhere away from the bed. Sherlock finished it off by tugging off his pants.
What would it be like to date Sherlock… His thoughts started to wander and he stopped himself. They were best friends and flatmates. That was it. As far as John knew Sherlock was not interested in a relationship with anyone, except his work. “John, I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work.” Those were his exact words that night at Angelo’s. And more importantly, John was straight. Wasn’t he? He never really questioned his sexuality before because he had no reason to do so. He had dated women all his life. Was it possible? John groaned as his head started to hurt. He turned over and cleared his head as best as possible. Images of Sherlock drifted in and out of his thoughts. John had no time to do this now; he really needed to sleep. After a while, he finally drifted off.
“Who hasn’t?” Valerian laughed. Sherlock smiled a bit at that. John gave Sherlock a reassuring smile and then seated himself in the corner with a chair to watch the lesson.
"Joh-John?" Sherlock croaked. John burst into another fit of tears at the sight of Sherlock swallowing the blood that must have been in his throat. He had cuts all over his face and his eyes were almost completely swelled up. Whoever those people were, they had hurt Sherlock and John was going to find them. He was going to make them pay for what they had done.
He groaned and crawled out of bed to make himself a cup of tea. John would still love him even though he pushed him away, right? He understood that Sherlock had needed some time to cope with seeing his parents, right? Sherlock started to sweat profusely, feeling the material of his shirt sticking to his skin, he unbuttoned it and threw it to the ground. How was he going to face John later if he couldn’t even function properly without him? Sherlock sat on the sofa and buried his head in his hands in defeat. He really loved John and losing him… Losing him would kill him.
There will be intense smut in the next chapter. If you do not wish to read, please skip foward to the chapter after. You will not have missed any of the plot. Thanks, guys!
“I choose a dare this time. Why not spice things up?” John thought that was probably the worst thing that they could do right now, considering the fact that he wanted to shove Sherlock up against a wall and fuck him into submission. He focused again and realized that he was clenching his fist and staring at the wall while biting his lip.
"I said no sex tonight; I'm so exhausted. I'd be complete rubbish at it." John said then yawned to emphasize his point.
“I may not be a consulting detective like you, but I know a dancer’s stretch.” his eyes twinkled as a playful smile lit up his face.
John: No Mrs. Hudson it's alright. We're fine. We were just wondering if you were free tonight and want to come to a party at our flat at around 7.
"Actually yes. Would you mind coming along with me to a flower shop? It's for the case. I have a theory of mine that I would like to test."
“I suppose I have to confront my parents.” Sherlock looked anxious. John placed a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek and squeezed his hand.
. The only thought on John’s mind. He needed to get to him. It didn’t matter how fast John had to run, how far he had to go. He was going to find him.
What John wondered was: why did everyone think that they were a couple? It’s not like they hugged or even touched much around people or anywhere. The most physical contact the two had was the time when John stayed out too late drinking with some of his mates and he couldn’t get up the stairs himself so Sherlock decided to carry him upstairs to John’s room and put him in bed. John could barely remember that night, however many months ago, but somehow he remembered Sherlock tucking him in. He blushed in spite of himself.
“I’m uh, looking for an engagement ring,” Sherlock said meekly. She looked him up and down still smiling.
John walked slowly towards the now pleading Sherlock. He already knew what he wanted to do to that perfect body. He already knew just how he would break Sherlock, then put him back together again
“Shite.” John jumped out in a panic and scanned their surroundings to see where Sherlock went, but there was no sign of him. They had been dropped off right in front of their flat, but Sherlock took off in the other direction.
When Sherlock woke up, he was momentarily confused until he remembered where he was. The next part of confusion came when he felt heavier than normal. He looked out the window and saw that it was still dark. When his eyes finally adjusted enough for him to see what was going on, he almost had a heart attack. John was wrapped around Sherlock’s long, bare legs, still snoring peacefully. Oh god, when did this happen? He hesitantly moved his hand towards John and rested it on his head. When John didn’t move, Sherlock started to run his hands through it gently. He had every intention of moving it before he fell back to sleep, but that was not what happened.
“Very handsome. I think that a silver band would suit him very nicely. We have our selection right here.” she gestured to a bunch of gorgeous silver bands and one immediately stood out to Sherlock.
WASSUP FUCKERS!!! Hi, okay so I know it has been almost a year and all of you are probably either low key done with this fuckin fandom because Moftiss kind of failed us in season 4 and you also might think I'm dead because I haven't uploaded in so long, but tbh I just haven't had any motivation to write. Recently, however, I hit a really low point in my life and I think that writing and FINISHING this fic will give me some purpose. Seeing all your comments is extremely refreshing and I don't want to let you guys down. So expect some new chapters hopefully soon ;) Love you all lots!
John: Sherlock and I are having a bit of a get-together tonight at 7 and we would love if you could come.
"I love you, Sherlock. I really, truly love you." Sherlock looked at John and smiled the most genuine smile John had ever seen.
Am I really? Sherlock, you didn't come out to me last year so that I could be a supportive friend. I mean, you did but that's not all I'm here for. If I see you checking out a guy, I want to help you out."
He thrust again, faster this time and shoved his mouth against Sherlock's; enjoying just how soft and full his lips were. John realized that this is what he had always wanted with Sherlock. He wanted to claim Sherlock as his own; be his master. He wanted to memorize every detail about Sherlock.
Can you see how hard I'm trying to update this fic on time?? *cries* I need sleep. I hope you enjoy. Please leave comments and constructive feedback. Also: here is a bonus. I don't remember writing this, but it was on the google doc that my fic is on so enjoy.
Sherlock started to lay down on the couch, but John grabbed his arm. “Oh no, you don’t. You are not getting messy food on our couch.”
“Yes, please,” John said smiling. Sherlock couldn’t bring his eyes off of him. He knew his defense was slowly crumbling. The facade he put up, to make people think he was a horrible sociopath, so they would steer clear and not get hurt. There were times that he didn’t care. He wanted to be vulnerable for once and just be held in John’s protective arms. They sat across from each other at a small, metal table and said nothing.
“I’m a sociopath John. Almost everyone except you thinks that I’m a freak or crazy. I just figured my luck had run out and the person that I care about the most thought so too." Sherlock said with a small smile. John’s heart fluttered at Sherlock’s words and he blushed. “Thank you, Sherlock. That means a lot coming from you. For the record, I don’t think you’re a sociopath. Whoever the doctor was that told you that you are a sociopath, is an idiot. After an hour with you, I could see that you care. You just care about certain people is all: Lestrade, your brother, and me.” John hoped that he had made the right choice by saying those words. Sherlock smiled a warm smile. “I appreciate it, John,” and closed his eyes again.
“Then help me,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth. “Sherlock I really am sorry, but it’s none of your concern and I'm sure I'll be fine soon enough.” John lied. “Are you embarrassed by me?” Sherlock’s voice came out as a whisper.
“What game?” John asked raising his eyebrow a bit, having a vague idea of where this could possibly go.
The whole next day was filled with wallowing in self-pity, roaming around Harry’s flat in search of something to do, not finding anything to do, sitting down on the couch, and wallowing in self-pity some more. By the time the sun started setting, John realized just how boring a day without Sherlock was. He remembered how incredibly boring his days were, post-army and pre-Sherlock.
"Good, I'll call them." John gave one more squeeze and then stood up to go get his phone. The calls went a bit something like this:
"My friends. They said that there was this boy in the orchestra who could play the violin beautifully and deduce your life story just by looking at you. I thought they were just screwing with me, but good god..." He trailed off and looked away.
“Bored, John. What were you thinking about?” Sherlock said looking up from his tea and today’s paper.
“Get down on your knees and suck me,” John commanded. Immediately, Sherlock obeyed and grasped John at the base of his cock with his slender fingers. Again, a jolt of pleasure surged through him, and he instinctively bucked his hips forward. Sherlock lightly brushed his lips over the tip and John felt a gasp escape from his lips before he could stop it. Sherlock put his whole mouth over the head and John threw back his head and moaned.
As the door swung open, Sherlock knew this meeting wasn't going to end well. He wanted to run and hide in his room for the rest of his life and never see those monsters again.
It made sense that Sherlock was a mess when John wasn't there by his side. He couldn’t think of any reason why John wouldn’t still love him, but he worried anyway. He had seen Sherlock break down in front of the people who should love him the most. And yet, the people who should have loved him the most, his parents, had allowed those horrendous things to be done to him. Sherlock hadn’t trusted anyone after that. Except for John, of course.
"Sherlock, believe me when I tell you that I didn't save you; you saved me. I was lost in the suffocating darkness of depression and I didn't care. Hell, I didn't want to get better; I had no reason to. Until you." Sherlock took John's head in his hands and brought him closer into a tender kiss. It was the most delicate that they had ever shared; full of love and content.
“How about we start with the basics? Show me what you remember.” Sherlock nodded and positioned himself. Although John knew how Sherlock’s body worked while they were being intimate, dancing showed off Sherlock’s physique in a much more beautiful and pure way. His body moved in a balance of perfect, precise movements and long, passionate ones. John was in awe of how flawless Sherlock’s meticulous motions were. He felt his breath hitch in his throat as Sherlock did a jeté and landed with barely a sound. From there he moved gracefully into a piroutté. John would never cease to be amazed by Sherlock dancing. One who didn’t know Sherlock might never assume that he was musically gifted, but John knew.
"Well, I'm not as good as you are at violin, but hopefully, those four years have given me some ability." He sat down and positioned his cello. Sherlock recognized the piece after the first few notes and he felt his heart beat faster. Viva la Vida by Coldplay. John played it perfectly and Sherlock was glad that he was already sitting down.
“Oh, well perhaps those aren’t the best words.” his father said quickly, seeing the anger flash in his eyes. Sherlock took a few deep breaths, telling himself to stay calm.
“Harry, where are you?” In an obviously intoxicated voice, she told him that she was at a bar a few streets away. John decided to walk there then call a taxi and ask if he could stay at her flat overnight. His feet were aching from all the walking he was doing tonight, but he knew he deserved every bit of pain. He arrived at the bar, and Harry was sitting outside on the front steps.
. Were they ever really safe in the world they lived in? How could John have been lulled into a sense of security, when he and his boyfriend solved dangerous crimes for a living? John gritted his teeth. He felt like such an idiot for not seeing this coming. He should have known that Sherlock would have run off by himself to try and keep John out of it. One of the only people Sherlock would ever be selfless for.
“Mmhm,” Sherlock hummed in response. John looked absolutely smitten, and Sherlock wanted to shove him up against the wall right now and kiss the life out of him. He fought back every urge and instead licked his lips and started walking to the bathroom.
He was being teased. John knew with every fiber of his being that Sherlock was going to be a dick and not make the first move, and knew he had to try to not let himself. It made him furious (and aroused) every time Sherlock teased him. He would seductively wink at John in public and John was forced to stay calm. It was killing him and the only way that he could get back at him was to be an even bigger tease. John didn’t mind it much, but it
“That one.” He pointed at one of the rings in the far left corner. She brought it out of the glass case and instantly knew that it was perfect. John would love it.
"Let me," he said in a low voice. Sherlock only closed his eyes and nodded, while biting his lip sexily. After John had taken care of Sherlock's pants, Sherlock reached over to do his. He moved hesitantly at first, but as soon as he saw John nod at him, his hesitations turned into quick, decisive movements.
"Do you have lube and a condom?" John asked cupping Sherlock's face. He got up quickly and ran to his bedroom. When he emerged just a few seconds later, he had a tube of it in his hand.
"Yeah. I do." John flew at him and wrapped his arms around him. Sherlock stumbled backward and they both landed on the bed.
He sat in his favorite chair and tried desperately to calm himself down. How long had he been without John? It couldn’t only be a day, could it? He took a deep breath and grabbed his phone from the table. He was barely able to send this simple text, due to the blurriness.
Sherlock's bow glided gracefully over the strings of his violin, emitting a sweet melody. His long fingers delicately placed to get the correct notes, using just the right amount of vibrato and applying the dynamics accordingly. He neared the end of the peace and slowed down gradually. He held the last note and let it ring in the air for a few seconds, then put his bow and violin back into their case. It was at that moment that he noticed another presence in the room. He turned and saw a boy his age staring curiously at him. He had dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and a cute button nose. Sherlock felt his face get hot as he checked him out. The boy spoke with a shy smile.
, I want-need you in me" Sherlock whined. John was momentarily stunned at Sherlock's new name for him. He was surprised that Sherlock had a fetish, but that just made John want to find every single one he had and exploit them. Sherlock seemed to get excited when John was the dominant role; the soldier and commander. John didn't mind playing that part at all if it meant he could finally do what he had longed to do since he met Sherlock: bury his cock deep into him and fuck him to submission.
“Nevermind it; I’m starving,” John said grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling him along. Sherlock gasped quietly at the touch and followed wordlessly.
“Let me go! Let your abomination of a son go out into the world. I’ll probably just be stoned to death anyway for being such a sin!” He spat at his father. He was so shocked, his grip loosened and Sherlock managed to get his arm free. He ran out of the clinic and didn’t look back once. At the time, he knew those memories would haunt him, and he knew that eventually his parents would find him. He just didn’t know it would be at the hands of the person he loved most. He didn’t know that John could do such an awful thing.
He turned the faucet off and stepped out onto the bath towel. He grabbed the nearest towel and gave his hair a quick ruffle with it then wrapped it around his waist and exited the bathroom.
At about 10 o’clock, Sherlock got a call from Mycroft. John couldn’t hear much over the loud shouts, but he did manage to understand that Sherlock and Mycroft’s parents had tried to confront Mycroft too. They knew that he had a position in the British government and tried to find him. Luckily security had stopped them, but Mycroft was still miffed. Sherlock hung up and walked back over to John. He looked like her was in desperate need of a hug, so John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso and mumbled reassuring things to Sherlock.
Sherlock blushed and mouthed the words thank you. John nodded and grabbed the paper from him. He sketched something on it for few minutes and Sherlock watched every movement he made; captivated by it. He finally stopped and handed it over to Sherlock shyly. When he saw it he was pretty sure he gasped out loud. It was a quick, but an absolutely brilliant sketch of Sherlock smiling.
"No. That would be giving up. We don't give up John." Sherlock looked at the kitchen with new determination.
He closed the door and immediately took his trousers and pants off in a hurry. He almost couldn’t get them off fast enough. A few strokes and picturing Sherlock’s arse in those
John felt like he might throw up. He had caused all of Sherlock’s misery just because he couldn’t stay away from a challenge. He really thought he could help Sherlock with his family troubles. He sat down on the curb and buried his face in his hands. How was he ever going to fix this?
"You don't have to worry. I'm going to help you get through it. Now that I can hold you and kiss you, things are different." They smiled at each other warmly.
"Oh that's awful; I'm so sorry. You're always welcome here, though." Sherlock gave a small smile. "Thanks."
"Honestly, you two. It was just a matter of time." Mrs. Hudson said and wiped at her eyes. They cut the cake and talked about life in between bites of sickeningly sweet cake and rather bland Chinese food. It was a lovely evening and John was a bit disappointed when it was over. It was nearing 10 when they started heading back to their houses. They all left with a pleasant goodbye and wished Sherlock and John a happy relationship. Then the door was closed and they both exhaled simultaneously.
“Sherlock, oh my god.” He went further down his shaft and John had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out. His whole body felt hot as if there was fire running through his veins and controlling him; making him writhe in pleasure as Sherlock went up and down, applying just the right amount of pressure. He felt himself building up to his climax, and he knew that he needed to stop Sherlock before he came.
HOLY SHIT, YOU GUYS! I actually finished a fic. I can't believe I did it honestly. Thank you so fucking much for all your support these past couple of years and thank you for sticking with me. Your kind comments and leaving kudos have helped me so much and gave me the confidence I needed to continue this. I never in a million years would have thought that people would actually read my stuff and like it. Thank you so much. Please share this with anyone who would want to read it and let me know if you have any feedback. Also feel free to follow me on tumblr @mybaeisbaymax :D Bye!
your own good. Then Dr. John Watson would contact my parents in an attempt to "fix everything." Sherlock said sarcastically.
"How many people are usually in one of the capsules?" John asked looking up at Sherlock. He grinned.
“I was serious about getting those trousers off” Sherlock mumbled through the kiss. John stood up and hoisted Sherlock up with him.
“I’m Dr. Watson, but please call me John. My er- partner, Sherlock Holmes is the one who will be receiving lessons. He’s just this way, please come in.”
"I was hoping there would be some of that in our private capsule." He wiggled his eyebrows at the word private.
He slowly climbed out of bed and walked to his bathroom for a quick shower and freshening up. When he had finished, the music was still going on. It had gotten faster and the notes were a shorter, more intense staccato. It reminded John of being on a fast-paced case; possibly being in pursuit of a criminal and chasing him through the winding streets of London. John quickly put on a robe and walked out as quietly as he could. He loved watching Sherlock play. It was so incredibly amazing that he could transform everything in his life into music that could make you feel everything he was feeling right along with him. He just stood there mesmerized by Sherlock's music for what seemed like forever. Sherlock ended the piece and John clapped before he could stop himself. He sat down embarrassed. "Oh, John. you're up." Sherlock said as he set his violin back in the case and loosened his bow.
"I just draw whenever I can. It's a great stress reliever, along with playing an instrument." John said with a shy smile.
You all must hate me for how long it takes me to update! ;-; I promise, I'm not trying to make you guys suffer (sort of). I'm so close to the end of this fic!! Just bear with me guys, it's almost summer so I'll have tons of time to write :D Thanks for sticking with me and believing in me.
"Sherlock, I'm so sorry. I didn't know they would show up tonight. I didn't think this would happen." Sherlock sank to his knees and looked up at John.
The scene he saw before him would be burned into his memory until the day he died. Sherlock was slumped against the wall, pressing on his abdomen as hard as he could. Two figures were surrounding him yelling something.
The cab stopped at 221B Baker Street and Sherlock angrily got out. He tossed the driver some money and stormed inside the flat as John chased after him.
Sherlock saw John’s eyes flutter open and he immediately smiled and kissed him softly. It lasted longer than usual because Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to pull away.
"Sherlock, I love you. Look at me, love." Sherlock stared into the beautiful blue eyes of the man he loved, and the man who loved him, and he felt safe.
"Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?" John sat up quickly and stared into Sherlock’s gorgeous eyes.
"I never thought I would spend the rest of my life with someone as wonderful as you. I never thought I would ever be that lucky." It was John's turn to try and keep himself from crying.
John pulled away the duvet and set Sherlock down gently. He pulled off his shirt and lay down as close to him as possible. Sherlock’s sobbing had turned into heavy breathing and a hot feeling in his face. His eyes had swollen shut and he had a headache, but he knew that John was next to him and he loved him. He knew that everything was going to be okay, so he put the past and those horrible memories behind him and focused on the present. He drifted to sleep with John’s lips on his forehead.
"I see," Sherlock said, obviously skeptical of John's claim. "Well I'm glad you found what you were looking for," Sherlock nodded and walked into his bedroom shutting the door. John let out a sigh and plopped down on the sofa to watch some TV.
“You don’t have to, but if you do, I’ll be right next to you the whole time.” Sherlock looked up lovingly and John and they cuddled some more in each other’s arms, the drama slowly being forgotten and forgiven.
“What?” John asked, genuinely confused. “Do I embarrass you, John Watson!?” Sherlock practically yelled.
"In the bedroom. Do hurry." John growled. With every step up the stairs from Sherlock, he felt his anticipation rise. Then he saw him: his perfect consulting detective boyfriend. He was standing in the doorway with a sheepish, shy smile on his face. He had his hands behind his back and appeared to be holding something.
"Hey freak, you're in my seat," said a voice all too familiar. It reminded Sherlock of the bleakness of this class.
"Well, I can see that you've played the cello for three, no, four years now." John stared at him in utter disbelief.
John: We are having a get together at the flat tonight at 7 and I'd like it if you could come. You know, if you're not too busy that is.
“Shite, Sherlock” John cried out as he kneeled to check where Sherlock had been shot. Blood was pouring out in a steady stream and John knew that Sherlock didn’t have much more time. They needed to get him to a hospital, and fast.
John felt his pants getting uncomfortably tight as he kept watching Sherlock move. He shifted in his seat to cover it up, but he was sure that the combination of his face and Sherlock’s ability to deduce practically anything gave away the fact that he was hiding a boner. Sherlock smirked and turned so that his backside was facing John.
“What do you think would be the best way to meet your parents?” John asked Sherlock after taking his hand and massaging an area by moving his thumb in small circles. Sherlock took a deep breath.
"Well I'm just taking it for the credit, but maybe it would be fun with you as my lab partner," John said, still smiling. Sherlock was seriously considering running at this point. All these emotions were too much for him to handle at once. All of that anxiety, however, was washed away when John grabbed his hand and said,
"It is not." Sherlock fussed and tried to straighten it out. John ran his hands through it and made it messy again.
John awoke to the sound of the violin. He listened for a few moments to the beautiful sounds that Sherlock could create out of that piece of wood. The bow moved across the strings in drawn-out notes. He put so much passion and emotion into each phrase, that John couldn't help but fix his ears on the magnificent sound and soak it in. Sherlock playing the violin this early meant that he was perplexed and couldn't sleep. John understood that, but he didn't understand what on earth could be bothering Sherlock.
“Well, would you listen to that. We’re being kicked out by our own gay son and his lover. How utterly surprising. The shock therapy was a good idea. You should be thanking us for trying, Sherlock.” his mother spat. She stood and pulled her husband up with her.
. Do it now.” Sherlock looked surprised and actually whimpered a bit. John felt himself harden as Sherlock’s long fingers fumbled with the buttons on his purple shirt. God the things he wanted to do… Sherlock’s shirt was now gone and his beautiful, pale torso was now on display for John to admire.
John felt himself get close and sped up, even more, pushing Sherlock into the mattress like he'd promised. With one last slap and pull, Sherlock came yelling John's name, squirted all over John's hand, and buried his face in the sheets. A couple thrusts later, John came into Sherlock's arse hole and fell on the bed in a sweaty mess next to Sherlock. He admired the work he had done on Sherlock's back, the bright hickeys gorgeous on his pale, alabaster skin. Neither of them said a word and just laid there breathing heavily and holding hands. They didn't bother to put on clothes, and just curled up together and fell asleep in each other's arms.
20 minutes later, the duo found themselves at the only flower shop in a 30-mile radius of Baker Street. The sign looked like it had gone through several years of hardship, as it was just barely staying up. In a hideous font, the name "Fancy Flowers" was displayed. Sherlock scoffed as he took it all in.
"So now do you understand chemical bonding?" Sherlock asked looking at John's busy notebook, full of little doodles.
"I do believe you're trying to get me drunk," John said and nuzzled at his neck. He felt Sherlock shiver under him.
Speaking of the past… John still needed to get in touch with the Holmes family and figure out why they needed to be forgiven, and why Sherlock wasn’t eager to.
“Well, she’s the boss. We better do as she says.” John said and hopped onto his bed. Sherlock stayed seated on the floor and stared at the bed wearily.
“So, do you like him?” John asked, trying not to give into the temptation of grabbing Sherlock, ripping his clothes off, and fucking him right there. Sherlock just kept smirking, his lips turned up ever so slightly.
John’s flashback ended abruptly as his phone started ringing. He didn’t bother looking at the caller ID.
"Water we talking about?" John asked and then giggled, "get it? Water? Because we're at a drinking fountain?" Sherlock managed to smile even though all his instincts were telling him to leave right now while he still could.
"Yes, John?" Sherlock said in a monotone voice. John replied, "Where do we keep the spare light bulbs?"
That night, after coming home from another exhausting case, Sherlock suggested that they play a game.
They had moved from the floor, after their mind blowing shag, onto the much softer couch to cuddle. Sherlock's head was in John's lap and John was absentmindedly playing with Sherlock's curls. He was essentially petting Sherlock's head, but he didn't seem to mind, so John continued.
. It always happened that way. He rolled his eyes and tossed the driver a couple of notes before climbing out and following his flatmate. Sherlock went immediately into case-mode as soon as his feet touched the pavement, and John just stood around awkwardly. Lestrade walked up to him in an attempt to make friendly conversation. “Hello John,” he greeted warmly. “Nice to see you, Greg,” John said smiling at him. Greg Lestrade was a nice guy with a warm, friendly personality. He was only intense if he was wrapped up in a lot of work which happened frequently, but John wasn’t around him most of the time.
"Sherlock, I would love to be your boyfriend." His face lit up with a smile. "On one condition, though." Sherlock raised his eyebrow.
"Since you've been such a good boy" John went to work on Sherlock's neck, sucking and biting until the skin turned red and purple. With every mark, he muttered a
a genius after all. As soon as they reached 221B, John excused himself to bed and didn’t give Sherlock another glance.
"Come on Sherlock, or we're gonna be late." John had a firm grip, Sherlock knew from the handshake that day in orchestra, but holding hands with him was nothing Sherlock could have imagined. I guess it wasn't really hand holding; more like John grabbing and pulling him, but Sherlock couldn't help but to get butterflies as he let himself get dragged by John Watson down the halls. He saw Greg give him a wink and a thumbs up before he rounded the corner and found himself at the familiar science room door.
"I'm just joking! I could use the fresh air." John said, enjoying the annoyed look on Sherlock’s face.
John thought to himself. Sherlock had never mentioned his parents now that he thought about it. Maybe he should call them up and invite them to Baker Street. Sherlock could probably use a bit of family. He decided that he would contact the Holmes family and have a reunion whether Sherlock approved of it or not.
“It’s not something you can get rid of! I like people of the same-sex and you need to wrap your brain around the idea that I always will!” He screamed at them.
There he was, tossing and turning in his bed, realizing just how empty the flat felt without John. “Where was John right now?” Sherlock wondered. Probably at his sister’s place. Sherlock wondered if maybe, just maybe, things could go right and they would both forgive each other. Sherlock rolled over for the millionth time and looked at the clock on his nightstand.
How could Sherlock just leave all these letters here and not open them? He obviously didn't want anything to do with his parents. "We really wish you would forgive us." What did they do that was so bad that Sherlock wanted nothing to do with them anymore? John heard the scraping of Sherlock's chair against the ground and John quickly shoved the rest of the letters in the bin and snapped the lid back on. He shoved it into the closet, shut the door, and walked out of the bedroom with the light bulbs in his arms.
“Okay the give him some time. Let him reach out to you. You can stay at my place until then. Only if you cook, though.”
“Finally John. My god, I thought you were going to be in there forever,” Sherlock said as he opened the door. “I took less than fifteen minutes, Sherlock. Good thing you aren’t living with a woman. You would lose all of your patience.” Sherlock made a sort of huffing sound in John’s direction before stepping outside into the brisk London air. John followed, feeling mildly annoyed, but mostly just happy that Sherlock was up and about. He had been moping around the flat with nothing to do and it was driving John insane, almost as much as it was Sherlock. They needed this case.
"They're gorgeous, John," Sherlock said in awe, soaking them all in. John buried his face in his hands. "You really mean that?"
The cab ride back to the flat was the longest 7 minutes Sherlock had ever experienced. He was a complete mess. His pants and boxers were completely soaked through with tea and his coat and shirt were splashed red with the soup. John kept apologizing to him the whole ride back.
It had been 24 hours without John, and Sherlock felt like he was slowly spiraling into a dark, bottomless pit. His anger towards John was subsiding, and now he just missed him terribly. John hadn’t known what his parents had done to him. He really believed he could help. John always tried to help people no matter what the cost was. Sherlock was still irritated that John had gone through Sherlock’s stuff without his permission, but people make mistakes.
Back at the flat with containers of Chinese food strewn everywhere, John suggested that they watch a bit of telly and then go to bed.
“Yes, thank you very much,” John shook his hand again, “It was wonderful to meet you.” They showed him out and made sure he knew where he was going. As soon as the door closed, Sherlock stood in front of John smirking. He felt his face get hot.
"So, what about us? I mean, I assume we aren't just friends and flatmates anymore." John asked cautiously. He didn't want to upset Sherlock.
He took a few deep breaths and ran after Sherlock. John may have been a soldier, but he knew that Sherlock was going to be considerably faster. Regardless, he pushed his body harder and sped up.
Sherlock cut him off, “Well, you need to figure out a way to say it because I feel like I’m going to pass out.”
Two short raps on the door, followed by more desperate knocking, sounded. Sherlock sprang up and threw open the door. John soaked all the way through from the rain, stood there with tears forming in his pale blue eyes.
Sorry guys, I got sick halfway through writing this and was only able to finish it today. Thank you for being patient!
“Oh god, I want- I want so many things. Fuck me- God please, John. Just fuck me.” Sherlock cried out.
"I-I brought you some flowers." He said handing John the bouquet, flustered. They were beautiful; blues and purples combined. John smiled and led Sherlock over to the bed. He put the flowers on the bedside table and pulled Sherlock into a kiss. Sherlock quickly kissed back with equal force and passion. They fell onto the bed and continued their kiss; John was running his hands through Sherlock's curls hungrily and enjoying the soft moans coming from the man underneath him.
"Do you want to be a good little boy for daddy?" Sherlock nodded eagerly. "Go deeper Sherlock. Deep throat for me, baby." Sherlock moaned at the new instructions and took John's whole cock down his throat.
"Hello?" A voice that was unmistakably John's came through the phone, into Sherlock's ear, and into his brain to be processed. It was at that moment that Sherlock felt extremely unprepared and not at all ready for a phone call with John.
“Were you thinking something flashy or simple?” she asked, showing him a selection of men’s rings. Sherlock thought for a moment about what would look best on John.
Now they were almost fully naked, with John still in his shirt, and both of them still in their boxers. John undid the buttons I his shirt slowly while kissing Sherlock softly. John was finished removing his shirt, and now they were bare chest to bare chest, feeling each other hungrily and with so much need and passion. John slid his own boxers down and did the same with Sherlock’s. The feeling of their bare skin rubbing together and what they were about to do, made them both achingly hard.
"Be a good boy, Sherlock. Be a good boy and I'll fuck you very good. Right up against this wall. You want that?"
"Dumb name. Old sign. The only reason they are still in business is because they have no competition."
They arrived at the flat and John helped Sherlock out of the cab. He dragged him to the door and pushed him into the flat.
I am SO sorry for the late update. Life is crazy again and I might update less, but I will still try to update once a week. I love you all!
"Aw come on. That's not true. You have tons of great features. Your height, your dark curly hair, your eyes, your-"
"It was Diana Reid," Sherlock said as soon as Lestrade walked over. "Who is that and how do you know?" Lestrade said with a puzzled look on his face. Sherlock took a deep breath.
The next step was figuring out the best place for them to meet each other and the best time. They also needed a safe word, as weird as that sounds, just in case Sherlock couldn’t stand it anymore and needed to be bailed out of there as quickly as possible.
“Okay, I’ll get dressed.” John sighed to himself and walked slowly up the stairs to the bathroom to get cleaned up.
"The man we found at the lake was wearing gloves and we never thought to check under them, well you didn't. I took a look and saw a cleaned prick on his finger. At first, I didn't know what it was from, but after a quick background check, I found out that his ex-wife Diana Reid owns a flower shop and I knew it was a prick from a rose thorn. It didn't take me long after that to figure out that she coated the thorns with poison and gave the rose to her ex-husband. Sure enough, I found a bottle of arsenic in the back room while John was keeping Diana occupied. Good job by the way. My theory is that she gave him the rose as an “apology” and he didn't want it so she took that opportunity to shove it into his hands, therefore, pricking his finger and getting the poison into his bloodstream. After a few hours, he would have been paralyzed and Diana then was able to throw him into the lake to make it seem like he committed suicide and he drowned." Sherlock finished his long speech and handed Lestrade the evidence.
He flopped down on his bed and tried to control his breathing. How bad was this situation? John would say pretty bad. He barely managed to catch up on any sleep. His thoughts were mostly of Sherlock, and John knew that the more he thought about him, the worse it would get. But he just couldn’t help himself.
"Hey, it's not your fault. It was the drunk driver's." John took a shaky breath and leaned in towards Sherlock. He wrapped his arms around him and it took Sherlock by surprise at first, but he remembered that normal people are supposed to hug back. He awkwardly put his arms around John and breathed in his scent. It was marvelous. When John finally pulled away, Sherlock was unsatisfied. He wanted more; he wanted to claim John as his own and map out every inch of his body beneath his fingers.
“Okay, yes I got a boner, and yes I went to go take care of it during your lesson.” John sighed, slightly embarrassed. Sherlock walked up to him and bent down a little to whisper in his ear. “I know.”
They walked over to a park bench and sat together, watching the lights come on in the distance as it started to get dark. Why was John suddenly feeling this way about Sherlock? It's not like Sherlock had these thoughts about John. Well, he didn't exactly know that. John sighed deeply. Was he really developing a crush on his best friend? That couldn't be safe. Sherlock rarely showed affection unless it was to John. Wait... Only to John. Was it possible that Sherlock was hinting at something? No; John was his friend and that was it. They solved crimes together and shared a flat, but that was it. That was all it could ever be.
“Come on Sherlock. I don’t bite! Unless you’re into that.” John laughed and Sherlock managed a giggle. He climbed onto the bed and made sure he was, at least, an arm’s length away from John. He wanted to be closer, but he couldn’t trust his exhausted self to not reach out and hold onto John in the middle of the night
"We have traced the call and we are coming to you. Plea-" John hung up and threw the phone down in anger.
"I'm a natural born chef. It's like chemistry: Combining things with specific measurements. If you don't put the right amount of something, you could blow up the whole flat."
“I love you too. I honestly couldn’t ask for anyone else in my life. You’re the only one I need to make me happy.” They sat together in silence for a while, listening to each other’s breathing and hearts beating. Sometimes the quiet was what reminded John most of the war. Most people would think that it would be loud, chaotic situations, but it was the opposite. The moments that haunted John the most from the war were the quiet moments right before a bomb went off or a shot was fired. The moments when he had no idea what was coming next. After the war, John was plagued with suicidal thoughts and post-traumatic stress disorder. The silence in his life was killing him slowly. Sometimes for John, the quiet was more violent than the noise.
“Harry… I thought you said you were trying to stay away from alcohol for a while.” John put his hands on her shoulders.
"Oh, that. Not really. Sally isn't bad, but she doesn't play with any feeling. She's too much of a perfectionist."
Guilt didn’t even begin to describe the feeling John had at the moment. He was ashamed of himself for being so clueless as to Sherlock’s situation. Sherlock was absolutely right: John couldn’t help but pry and try to make everything better even if it was beyond his capabilities. Only now, walking in the cold, did he realize how badly he had fucked up.
Sherlock, in danger. As he ran, he thought about how he would much rather have Sherlock by his side to make him feel safe. That’s what Sherlock did for John, what he had always done. He gave him a home, a purpose, and made him feel like he belonged. Sherlock had a way of making John feel like nothing bad could ever happen to him.
They started walking and John felt oddly calmed by Sherlock's presence. Sherlock had this aura about him. One look at him and you could tell he was strong, smart, and confident. John wondered what people thought about himself when they saw him. Probably just a wounded soldier that was lonely and now only slightly less so. It didn't matter because he wasn't lonely anymore. He had a genius for a best friend and he was perfectly happy.
“Sure,” he says picking up the cheese and reaching over to put it on John’s side. John reaches for it and knocks over Sherlock’s tea in the process.
"You know," Sherlock said, shifting a bit so he was closer to John. "I finally understand why people are so obsessed with sex." John stifled a laugh.
"Allow the cake to explain." Sherlock uncovered the cake on the table and John nearly fainted. It was covered in sentences, and these were sentences that were not exactly supposed to be on a
Hey, guys! I'm currently cleaning up and rewriting some parts of the beginning of my fanfic. Go check it out and tell me if you like it! Thanks :)
"What the hell?" He gasped at the spotless kitchen. "I was in the shower for 10 minutes and you cleaned the kitchen?"
“John, I am almost certain about the killer. Would you like to come with me to present the evidence to Lestrade?" Sherlock's voice shook him back into reality. "Yes, I'll come; I want to know what happened," John said smiling at Sherlock.
“I’ll be right there the whole time, love. You don’t need to be nervous. If they say just one thing to upset you, I’ll throw them out.” That got a small smile from Sherlock.
"It will be fun, come on." Sherlock nodded slowly in defeat. All that he could hope to accomplish from this game was performing some sexual act on John. Dare to dream. They sat across from each other on John's carpeted floor and just stared. Their eyes were locked on each other's and neither of them looked away.
“You shouldn’t have left me, you bloody idiot. I love you. You hold on you hear me? Hold on for me.” John sobbed as he held Sherlock’s hand.
You’ve never called me that before; why are you in such a good mood?” he asked playfully and kissed Sherlock.
"My cock; please can you help me?" Sherlock pleaded. John saw how red and hard Sherlock was and he groaned, thrusting again. He took hold of Sherlock's length and pulled. He thrust and stroked to the same pace, and it soon became faster and faster. John was jerking off Sherlock with one hand and slapping his, now pink, arse with the other.
"I want to know what makes Sherlock Holmes tick. Who are you? I barely know." John leaned forward a bit.
Sherlock wasn't the best at eating a lot. In fact, he barely ate twice a day, and that was only if John forced him to sit down and shoved a plate at him. So it was no surprise to John that Sherlock looked at the menu with distaste and only skimmed through. "Come on Sherlock. I took you to dinner and it's on me, so please just eat a little something?" Sherlock's face softened and he nodded slowly.
"That was fun." John giggled. Sherlock thought it was more arousing than fun, but he didn't dare say that out loud. John hoisted himself up and rifled through his dresser. He finally found a large shirt and tossed it at Sherlock.
“No. Don’t ever talk to me again. Don’t you dare come looking for me! I’m going to make it on my own, and I don’t need you two. Don’t ask Mycroft where I am, he won’t tell you.” Sherlock stood and started to walk out, but his father grabbed him by his arm.
"I'm sure it's not too hard." Sherlock called back. Boy were they wrong. Six failed attempts later, John looked at the wrecked kitchen in defeat.
"Alright, Sally. Next class, we can have a seating test. You will have to play all of Viva la Vida in front of the class, mind you." She looked over at Sherlock with an evil smirk.
Before Sherlock walked back into the flat, he noticed that the same car that had been parked outside his flat for the past few days was still there. He hadn’t paid much attention to it before because he wasn’t completely focused lately. However, something about that car made Sherlock’s skin crawl and he quickly hurried inside.
John thought of what he could do today to pass the time when it hit him. In all of the confusion and confessing feelings for each other, John had forgotten all about the letters. With Sherlock gone, it was the perfect time to contact Sherlock's parents and have them come over. It was time for Sherlock to get over whatever this was. He was a grown man bickering with his parents. Then again, John didn't exactly know what they had done to Sherlock to make him that upset. It didn't matter anymore because John was set on repairing the bond between Sherlock and his parents.
"They sent me to clinics and had them use drugs and shock therapy on me," Sherlock whispered helplessly.
The best word to describe what Sherlock was feeling right now? Shock. His whole damn world had been flipped upside down and he had no warning whatsoever as the awful memories flooded through his brain. It was as if actually seeing his parents had broken the dam that he had worked so hard to build after all these years that was keeping those unwanted memories pushed back. In his mind palace, those memories had been placed in a vault. He knew they were there, but until he actually saw them, actually felt them, did he remember.
“Well I was practically asleep until you decided to wake me for God knows what reason.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and took a sip of tea, looking smug.
Sherlock went back to his laptop and John sat at the table across from him. He sipped his tea and his mind wandered back to the thoughts that he was having before he’d fallen asleep. He felt his face get hot, as he remembered one of the more explicit thoughts he had experienced. Sherlock was too engrossed in his laptop to notice his rosy cheeks, and John was grateful for that. He wondered what it was like in Sherlock’s mind palace. It must be a magnificent, terrifying place. The kind of place that Sherlock was naturally drawn to. He finished off his cuppa and stood. Sherlock hadn't touched his and John sighed knowing that it would be cold before Sherlock even remembered it was there.
“Lestrade called and asked us if we could meet him in half an hour. Something about a body of a man found in the lake…” Sherlock trailed off obviously deep in thought about it.
“Tell me what you want,” John said in the most commanding army voice he could muster. Sherlock actually whimpered and looked up at him with pleading eyes.
"I'm uh, I'm fine. Thanks. How about you?" Sherlock was still in shock that John Watson had called him.
"Don't be like that dear, please. We've come all this way." His woman who was obviously his mother spoke. She had silver hair and almost a perfect match of Sherlock's eyes.
"Sherlock... I'm so sorry." He sent it and closed his phone. He didn't know how long it would take to earn back Sherlock's trust, but he would stop at nothing.
“Yeah, they are really good to paint with. Truth or dare?” before Sherlock could answer, John’s aunt peeked her head in the door.
“Tell me what to do. I want to obey your every command. Punish me if I misbehave.” John felt himself get even harder at Sherlock’s words and all he wanted was Sherlock’s gorgeous lips around his cock; sucking him until he couldn’t take it anymore.
"Will there be a seating test for the upcoming concert to see who is the most deserving of first chair?" An unhappy Sally spat out.
did most of the talking. He had learned her whole life story in just 10 minutes, and it sounded like she was about to tell it all over again. "Sherlock, are you almost done?" John asked impatiently.
, which made Sherlock tremble in pleasure. He went down Sherlock's back, licking and claiming him, leaving hickeys wherever he went. Finally, John grabbed Sherlock's legs and spread them apart himself. He squirted the lube on his fingers and traced his fingers lightly over the spots he had marked on his back.
"You still don't see what's wrong with this? You looked at my obviously personal stuff and contacted my parents!"
"Okay, enough Sherlock. I don't want to come too soon." John gasped, feeling the heat in his groin intensify.
“So what are you still doing standing there?” Sherlock turned and started walking towards the sofa. John followed and grabbed his arm before he made it there.
"That could be arranged." John made sure to set down his champagne glass so that they wouldn't have another accident like their first kiss. At the thought of their first kiss, John sat down on Sherlock's lap and caressed his face lovingly.
John's hand was warm and inviting like his house. Frankly, all of John was like a beacon of light and warmth. He radiated sunshine and happiness and his smile was earth shattering. Sherlock didn't know how he got so lucky as to meet him, but he was definitely grateful.
Hey! I am so sorry that I took forever to update. This chapter is kind of short so I'll try to update again soon to make up for it. Let me know that you think!
"It's getting late, want to head back?" Sherlock asked, no doubt worried about how John all of a sudden looked as if he made a life-changing discovery. Which in a way,
He was back in his small flat, alone. It was before he had run into Mike and before Sherlock had come into his life. He stared out the small window and saw only gloomy skies. The whole room seemed to lack any sort of color. What was the point of trying anymore? John couldn’t remember the last time he had felt any form of happiness. He was haunted from visions from the war, awake or asleep. He opened the drawer next to his bed where he kept what few possessions he owned. There was a computer, a pen, a journal, a few coins, a button from a shirt, and a gun. He traced his finger along the outside and sighed deeply. Could he really do it? End his life just like that; one bullet? He picked up the gun and felt the heaviness in his hands. He saw the battle field in front of him and he shut his eyes to block out what he could. John was certain that there was no solution for him. There was nothing left. He raised the gun.
"Do any of you have any suggestions for pieces that we could play? I heard Sherlock and John playing Viva La Vida by Coldplay earlier. It sounded really good. How does that sound?"
“I-I’m at this bar somewh-” The call cut off. His sister was always doing this. Drunk calling him and expecting him to get her home safely. The phone rang again and he picked up with a heavy sigh.
"Alright everyone, before we tune, I would like to introduce our new student. His name is John Watson and he's a cellist and pianist. I hope you all will welcome him warmly into our little orchestra." Mr. Uyehara addressed the students. Sherlock looked back at him and smiled. John smiled back with a small hint of a blush. Probably just from all the attention he was getting. Sherlock was determined to make John like him, even if all he could do was a platonic relationship.
John needed to figure out what to do. Should he risk it all and tell Sherlock, just to possibly get rejected and lose the special friendship that they had? That was most likely what would happen and John just couldn’t bring himself to do it.
"Yes, I've got a few errands to run. I'll be back soon, love." John couldn't help but smile as Sherlock pressed a kiss to his forehead. He adored it when Sherlock called him love. He was the only person Sherlock truly cared about that way, and it made him feel good.
A slideshow of his absolute worst memories played non-stop in his mind, but none of them were even close to as bad as the situation before him. He blinked back tears and tried to swallow down the panic that was quickly rising up in his throat. He put as much pressure on the wound as he could to keep Sherlock from losing as much blood as possible, even though the blood and the cold made him want to throw up. John was used to blood. As an army doctor, he had seen his fair share of bullet wounds, most of them fatal, but the sight of Sherlock bleeding out in front of him made him sick. There was so much; soaking through Sherlock’s clothes and onto his hands. He still heard no ambulance coming to their rescue.
"Well," John squeezed Sherlock's hand and let go. Immediately he felt the absence and wished it could be filled again, "time for class, I guess."
As hard as it was, John tried hard to act natural the whole time they were walking back to the flat. Sherlock kept pestering him about his sudden change in attitude. John insisted that he was fine, but he figured that Sherlock knew otherwise. He
"Cool," Sherlock said absently and walked towards his next class, sighing every step at how in love with John Watson he was.
The food was delivered and Sherlock stared at it as if he couldn't believe he had agreed to eat it. John gave him a look and Sherlock sighed. He took slow bites as if making sure the food endured every bit of torture it could, before being swallowed. He chewed with such anger it was almost funny to watch. "Oh come on Sherlock, what did the food do to you?" John said, handing him a napkin. Sherlock grimaced, "It decided to get set on a plate and eaten. So that's what I'm doing to it."
, oh my god." Sherlock panted and gripped the sheets so hard his knuckles turned chalk white. With his free hand, John gripped Sherlock's waist and inserted another finger. Sherlock squirmed under John's touch and grunted through gritted teeth.
John couldn't believe what he was reading. He stared at the text over and over again, overanalyzing. Although overanalyzing was Sherlock's special talent, John occasionally couldn't help but think too much about something.
“What- No don’t be ridiculous” What was he supposed to be doing? He took in his surroundings. Right! Walking to lunch with John. He had just solved a case.
"I know." He laughed and walked into his room to find some clothes to put on. He chose his favorite grey jumper and put on the first pair of trousers he could find, then walked back out. Sherlock was taking the perfectly baked cake out of the oven.
. So, if you know what’s good for you, you will run and never look back because I will hunt you down and make you pay.” Apparently, they needed no more convincing than that. They took off down the alley and disappeared around the corner.
Sherlock whimpered and immediately laid himself face down on the mattress. John leaned over to the drawer and grabbed the bottle of lube.
"How could you? If you only knew..." His voice cracked. "If you only knew what they did to me." There were tears now.
Three short raps on the door sounded, and Sherlock felt his heart stop. All the blood rushed to his face and he felt his knees go weak. John's strong grip on Sherlock's arm and reassuring nod helped a little as he walked slowly with him to the door.
"No, it's okay. It's just... I don't think I'll have enough money. My parents died when I was young in a car crash and I was left with next to nothing."
“Ah, the lucky lad then. Come right this way, and I’ll help you find something special for him.” Sherlock exhaled with relief and smiled. People were actually starting to accept people like him; a time Sherlock never thought he would experience.
” with an evil grin. John completely lost it. He stood up and marched over to his flatmate. With a yelp of surprise from Sherlock, John climbed on top of him and slammed his lips into the softness of Sherlock’s. It took Sherlock only a second to process what was happening, and for him to respond and kiss back with the same amount of force and energy.
“If you say you’re sorry one more time, I swear to god.” John blushed and hid his face in his hands.
“John it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. Stop blaming yourself for everything. The cab made a sharp left and Sherlock was pushed into John. He moved himself a bit so that he was only leaning on John the smallest amount.
He thought about what Sherlock liked doing most in all the world. Well, aside from chasing murderers around London, that is. He loved to dance. That was one of the many things that John adored about Sherlock. He was an amazing dancer, but he never wanted to show people for fear of being judged.
This was a bitter-sweet moment. Sherlock hadn't accepted his apology, but he wanted to see him again. At least, it was something. He responded as sweetly as he could.
"No, because I have something better in mind," Sherlock said with a smirk. He placed a quick kiss on John's lips, then left to go to his room.
“Why does it sound like you’re saying goodbye?” John’s heart skipped a beat. The cab stopped and without giving him an answer, Sherlock pulled away and took off running.
"The view is fantastic," John said looking out from where they were. It was a clear day and they could see all of London displayed in front of them. It still made John a little uneasy to be so high up, but he could always squeeze Sherlock's hand for support. They were practically glued together; neither of them moving more than a centimeter away from each other. It was all so amazing, and John couldn't believe that Sherlock had arranged all this for him.
Sherlock was lying on his bed staring at the ceiling when he heard his phone ring. He groaned and sat up to answer it, not bothering to look at the caller ID, assuming it was Greg. He was the only person Sherlock ever talked to on the phone anyway.
"Be a good boy and spread your legs for me," John commanded. Sherlock moved slowly, and John reached out and slapped Sherlock's arse. He cried out in pleasure and groaned.
John was famished. He hadn't eaten in 24 hours and his stomach was making sure he knew it. It was four o'clock and Sherlock was taking a nap on the couch. He was muttering incoherently, and it was amusing, to say the least.
“I’ll be right back. Have to use the loo.” John excused himself while Sherlock flashed him a knowing smile.
"Come on Sherlock. Don't lie to yourself. It's okay to be nervous! How about we practice together sometime? At my place; well my aunt's more like."
"So," John said setting his cello case on the ground and unpacking it as he spoke, "why were you here so early?"
"Yours. I like the smell; It smells like you." John went up to his room to get changed into his sleep shirt and came back to find a fully naked Sherlock lying on the bed.
“I don’t care. I love who I love, and neither me nor any doctor can change that.” Sherlock cried out. Why couldn’t he just get them to understand?
"You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, so we're even." He hugged Sherlock back even harder.
"Are you going to art school? I mean after you're done with high school?" Sherlock blurted out. John's expression grew sad and he put down his pencil. "Sorry. I didn't mean-"
"Mr. And Mrs. Holmes." was on the front of almost every envelope with the exception of a few from other people John didn't know. He held his breath and quickly opened one before he could stop himself.
"I'm fine. My name is Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes." He managed to get out and raised his hand out for John to shake it. He grasped it firmly with a steady hand.
“Come on let’s get these clothes off of you and get you into the shower.” John must have realized how that sounded because he quickly turned red and looked down.
“Of course, I remembered, Love. It’s one of my favorite things about you.” John smiled lovingly at the perfect man in front of him whom he was lucky enough to be in love with. Most of the people who knew Sherlock would never get to see this side of him the way John did. The gentler, more human side. The man who was a fantastic violinist, dancer, a passionate chemist, and most importantly: an incredible boyfriend. While most people saw Sherlock as a cold-blooded machine and a sociopath, John knew that he was just misunderstood by people who didn’t take the time to really get to know him. That may be partly because Sherlock wouldn’t let anyone see that side of him like he let John.
"Come here, you" John pressed himself against Sherlock and kissed him passionately. He pressed Sherlock up against the glass and let his hands wander. He heard Sherlock let out a small moan and he felt himself get hard.
After a lovely dinner of spaghetti and meatballs, John's aunt thought it best that the two of them get changed into what they would wear to sleep.
“Actually,” he began nervously, “I need, um, a ring for a man.” He braced himself, half expecting her reaction to be extreme. She just kept smiling.
"My name's John. John Watson. I'm supposed to be in the orchestra class that starts in half an hour. Your playing sounded amazing by the way. Are you the first violin?" Sherlock tried to speak, but the words refused to come out.
"Hey, Sherlock don't worry." John said putting a hand on his shoulder, "your playing is amazing and anyone who doesn't think that can answer to me." He puffed up his chest dramatically and everyone at the table laughed.
I am so sorry that this took me like a year. Like, really sorry. I don't have an excuse. It's just my life. Let me know if you want me to keep writing this and if you want me to finish.
"Someone probably left something here. I'll answer it" Sherlock said. John heard the door open and then complete silence.
Sherlock stuck his arse out way farther than necessary while he did another turn and winked at him in a completely flirtatious way. John shifted his weight again as it became almost painful how hard he was.
By the time he came downstairs and was dressed and ready to go, Sherlock was already waiting by the door, tapping his foot impatiently. No surprise to anyone there. Sherlock was probably dying to get outside and solve a case. His big brain was throbbing from lack of excitement, John was sure. It had been at least a week if not more and he was, no doubt, already halfway through solving the mystery without even seeing the evidence.
“Well, I’d say they fit quite nicely.” John laughed. He bit his lip and kept his gaze transfixed on Sherlock. He was completely unable to look away.
"Another perk of paying all that money was, we don't have to wait in line," Sherlock stated proudly and handed their tickets to the person working at the front.
"John, dear. Did you invite Sherlock to stay for dinner? How about stay overnight? Would your parents be okay with that?" John's aunt asked him.
"I know." John stuck his tongue out at Sherlock's ever growing ego. Sherlock took the opportunity to put his, now clean hands, on the sides of John's face and kiss him. They spent a full two minutes snogging there in the kitchen.
"They had to make mistakes so that they could learn from them and the relationship would benefit." That's what John told himself over and over again before Sherlock woke up. When he finally rolled over and fixed his fascinating eyes on him, John felt uneasy.
"Alright, Coldplay it is." Mr. U said and took a sip of his tea, "I will get the sheet music printed out as soon as possible. For today, how about we do some scales, and then I'll let you out a bit early. Sound good?"
"What's up you and the curly haired girl?" John said taking a bite of his sandwich. Sherlock saw him eating alone and invited him over to the table that he normally sat at. Greg Lestrade and Mike Stamford joined them.
Guys! Oh, how I have missed you! It has been far too long! I am so sorry that I haven't updated this in over a month. I haven't had any time at all to write and I apologize. Hopefully, I'll get back on track and go back to weekly updates. Until then! Enjoy!
He cleaned himself off and returned to the bedroom. Sherlock and Valerian were talking and motioned for him to come over.
“Where are you going to go?” John asked. Sherlock could tell that he was trying to control his breathing; something that he did when he was on the verge of panicking. Sherlock did his best to ease John’s worry.
“Alright then. I dare you to take off your trousers. Not your boxers, though.” He sipped his wine and added “
“The people who tried to kill you were hired by your parents. The car out there is owned by some of Mycroft’s men. He made sure that they would be out there to protect you because, well…” John trailed off.
“He sounded a bit too enthusiastic when I called and mentioned a dead body, although thinking about it now, that does sound like Sherlock.” John laughed.
"Today we will watch a PowerPoint presentation made for you by Anderson Michaels on how certain chemicals behave." Mr. Coleman started off class. Sherlock couldn't stop himself from rolling his eyes. Anderson was a stuck up fool, who just happened to be Mr. Coleman's pet. It didn't matter, though, because Sherlock was Mr. Uyehara's pet and that made Sally Donovan pretty pissed. Sally and Anderson were known around school as being the "power couple." Whatever that meant...
“I can’t believe you got me a lesson,” Sherlock said, still amazed, “I mean, I can’t believe you even remembered that I like to dance”.
. He was going to unlock the pleasures that Sherlock kept buried away, deep in his vast mind palace.
John made a choking sound and started laughing to cover it up, but Sherlock saw a hint of lust in his eyes. John carefully removed Sherlock’s coat and draped it over the chair. Sherlock started undoing his belt while John undid the buttons on his shirt. His fingers slipped a few times, due to the tomato soup, but eventually Sherlock was in nothing but his boxers. John stared at Sherlock’s chest and stomach and swallowed.
"To us" Sherlock replied with an adorable smile. They clinked glasses and took each other's hand in their own. Their compartment started going up and John squeezed Sherlock's hand a bit tighter.
His doubts were becoming larger and larger by the second. Was it really any of his business? He opened up the laptop and the home screen was displayed. There was no password, which John found a bit odd. He quickly clicked on the address book icon and waited for it to open. He typed Holmes in the search bar and saw 3 contacts pop up: Mycroft Holmes, William Holmes, and Katherine Holmes. John though it was a bit strange that Sherlock had to write this information down at all, but he only had room for "important" things in his mind palace. The email addresses for his family members were not important to him.
.” Sherlock exhaled and stared at his hands. John fought every urge to roll his eyes at the detective. He knew how Sherlock got on cases, but this time it was different. Sherlock usually relied on John to save the client while Sherlock solved the mystery, but Angelo wasn’t just a client. John took a deep breath to calm himself down and put his hand next to Sherlock’s. Sherlock took the hint and slowly laced his fingers in between John’s.
“Please, call me Walter. Are you Dr. Watson or Mr. Holmes? Gregory is never specific enough.” He laughed.
“And you’ve saved me countless times, too. We need each other.” John said, smiling gently. Sherlock realized that if he was going to propose soon, he needed to buy a ring. He really had no idea where to start, but he supposed that the mall was a good idea.
"I guess you will just have to wear your pants." John shrugged. Sherlock's face felt warm, but he nodded and pulled his shirt over his head. Changing in front of John Watson was probably one of the hardest things to do. He didn't dare let himself look at John's reaction to his naked chest, or bare legs. It drove him crazy, but he had to keep it together. This proved almost impossible, however, when John informed him of the sleeping arrangements.
"You're so gorgeous," John said looking deep into Sherlock's captivating eyes. He saw them fill with tears and heard Sherlock choke back a sob.
"Yes, well you are probably wondering why you are wasting your Friday evening at our flat," Sherlock said with a fake smile towards his brother.
He set his cup in the sink and went to his back to his room. He turned the light on and the bulb flickered a few times before returning to its previous dark state. He sighed and called out,
“Oh, thank you. That’s very kind. It’s just this way,” John led him to Sherlock’s room, “Sherlock decided to push his bed to the side to make more room for you two.”
“Are you going to explain what’s going on, or just sit there staring out the window?” John said after a few moments of painful silence.
"I hope you don't mind if we both share that bed. We're a bit short on space and I don't want to have to make you sleep on the floor. It's big enough right?" Sherlock felt his eye twitch.
“Get the fuck away from him, you hear me?” John pulled his gun out and growled at them. He must have looked absolutely terrifying because the two of them glanced at each other and backed away slowly. John aimed his gun at one of them and said, “If you don’t get the hell out of here now, I will fucking shoot you. Don’t think that I won’t. Do you know who you just shot? The world’s smartest consulting detective and
"It's okay, John. We can call him later and tell him." Sherlock put his hand on John's shoulder and John leaned into him.
"Lay down and take your fucking. I am going to fuck you so hard, it will hurt to walk for the next week." John's voice was husky and velvety at the same time. "That's an order!"
Orchestra was probably Sherlock's favorite class next to Chemistry. Music was his outlet; it allowed him to feel certain emotions that others thought he was incapable of. People thought Sherlock was some kind of sociopathic freak because he only cared about a few people. Maybe if he could get John to like him, he could show them.
The safe word “jam” was quickly thought of and agreed upon. It was an hour before Sherlock’s parents were to arrive, and Sherlock was pacing the flat like a madman. He was muttering to himself, running all the possible situations that could happen through his mind.
“I think,” John said, tracing Sherlock's jawline with his lips and leaving a trail of kisses down his neck , “you need to be taught a lesson.”
John smiled nodding in Sherlock’s direction “Believe me, it was his pleasure.” Lestrade smirked and leaned in to whisper in John’s ear, “And I’m sure you would know lots about that, mate.” Then he walked away, cackling before John could process what he meant. His face flushed and he felt his cheeks go hot. He looked down so Sherlock wouldn’t notice. He knew how everyone loved to tease him about his relationship with Sherlock. They had been flatmates for as long as he could remember. In fact, John could barely remember his life before 221B Baker Street and Sherlock. Coming home to experiments in the kitchen, and listening to Sherlock play his violin late at night while John drifted to sleep. John didn’t need any other life than that; he was content. “Come along, John.” Sherlock interrupted his train of thought.
"I made the cake myself," Sherlock said proudly. The guests just stared at it with a mix of horror and a bit satisfaction. Finally, Mrs. Hudson spoke up. "You boys finally realized your feelings for each other. Long after the rest of us realized it for you." The others nodded in agreement.
"Well, I think I'll er- head back to my dormitory now. Goodbye." Sherlock said taking his food. Not exactly the best exit plan, but he needed to go before he made a mess out of everything. John Watson was having an effect on him, he knew that for certain. Now the only question was: what was he doing?
It was obvious to both of them that something was definitely “up”. Sherlock was pretty sure that neither of them wanted to confront each other about it, though, so they looked at their menus. The waiter brought some bread, cheese, and grapes to them and set it on the table.
"I've got to go out for a bit today. I'll be back before lunch okay?" Sherlock said after they had snogged a bit in bed and then had their morning tea.
"Oh don't worry, they're always like that. They have a bit of a rivalry going on." He heard his friend Greg, who played viola, say with a chuckle.
“You’ll see.” He laughed then walked back out of the kitchen with two full glasses of wine. John gulped and took the wine carefully, as to not have another accident involving spilling liquids. Although, not that John thought about it, getting Sherlock undressed certainly seemed like something at the top of his “to-do” list. He sipped the wine and relaxed into his chair.
"Nice to meet you! You must be Sherlock! John's told me a lot about you!" John's aunt shook his hand as soon as he walked through the door. He felt his heart flutter at her words. How much had John been talking about him?
"Yes. He's your family." John said and squeezed Sherlock's thigh. A soft moan came from Sherlock's ever so slightly parted lips.
"I feel so vulnerable", Sherlock whispered and hung his head. John lifted Sherlock's chin up with his fingers and their eyes met.
"Oh well, it's been far too long. We deeply regret that little... incident that happened before and we realize how unfortunate it was for our dear boy." Sherlock felt all his muscles tense up.
"Great. Well, it's only 9:00. I think we could stay up, at least, another hour. What do you want to do?"
“I obviously don’t want to talk to them, but since it appears that it is necessary, I would prefer to meet them here. I want them to be fully aware that this is my flat and they are not to do anything that would displease me.” John nodded and kept massaging Sherlock’s hand.
"Please, Sherlock." He heard the desperation in his own shaky voice. Pushing down on Sherlock’s abdomen as hard as he could. "Don't leave me." John collapsed on the cement sobbing, clutching Sherlock’s freezing hand. He felt a small squeeze in return and quickly sat up.
Sherlock suddenly felt a pang of terror as the realization hit him: he might have lost John for good. He tried to steady his breathing, but he felt his throat closing up and his vision get blurry. He recognized what was going on all too well. He had gone through many panic attacks as a teenager, coming to terms with himself. None were this bad.
"Welcome to orchestra class, John. We're happy to have you. If you want, you can call me Mr. U, if Uyehara is too much for you."
Sherlock knew something was up with John. He could always tell when John did just something a little differently and knew exactly what each thing meant. Not this time. He has absolutely no idea what was wrong with his flatmate. The more John acted strangely, the more it affected Sherlock. He knew he had feelings for John, and that they were in no way platonic, but he couldn’t control them. He had to push them down, even though all he longed to do was push his lips onto John’s and just lay together for hours. His eyes started to water as he imagined a future that couldn’t happen.
“Hey, could you pass the cheese? I’m starving and I don’t think I can wait until the sandwich arrives.”
“Thanks again, Harry.” He walked into the other room and sat on the couch. The only things he had were his phone and his coat. He closed his eyes and exhaled loudly. Sherlock was the only thought on his mind. He wished for nothing more than to just curl up together and wrap his arms around him. His phone chimed and he saw that there was a text. That text was from Sherlock.
When Sherlock slept, it took away years of pain and worry from his face and left him in a state that people rarely ever saw from him: vulnerable. John figured that he was the only person that Sherlock trusted to see him when he was in that state, and John was proud of that fact. He smiled knowing that Sherlock trusted him.
“You know perfectly well what I’m talking about! The tests, the abuse, the neglect!” Sherlock’s voice raised to a shout.
“Thanks for the help John!” He yelled back and purposefully pulled down his boxers before he got fully into the bathroom. He was positive John could see.
"Don't be cheeky; it doesn't suit you. I like it when you're commanding and sexy." Sherlock said with a straight face.
“Why do you care anyway?” John spat out before he could stop himself. Sherlock’s facial expression hardened. “I’m your friend and it doesn’t take long for me to deduce that something is wrong. You have been drumming your fingers on the seat for a total of three minutes even though you usually have a completely still hand. You keep looking over at me and then looking away as if you can’t bear to look at me.” John was terrified. He was falling for Sherlock and because of that, he was getting all the wrong ideas about it.
When he finally heard the door opening a few minutes later, he smirked; thinking about just what he was going to do to Sherlock when he got his hands on him.
"Usually, there are up to eight, but I've booked us our own. It's complete with champagne and truffles."
He carried the sleeping Sherlock up the stairs carefully, making absolutely sure that he wouldn’t wake him up. He set him gently on the bed, curled up behind him, and wrapped his arms around his torso. John exhaled the breath he had been holding in since he knocked on the door to 221B. John had woken up at the sound of thunder, and he couldn’t stand being away from Sherlock any longer. He walked two miles in the pouring rain to get to Sherlock and didn’t regret a second. Now here he was, curled up behind his favorite person, the way it should be. The way it would be, forever.
“We only did it because we loved you. We wanted it to work so that you wouldn’t have live with that burden, those demons inside of you.”
In his post orgasmic state, John realized a few things about himself: he was definitely bisexual, he had strong feelings for Sherlock, and he was a top. Of course most of these things, John had realized earlier, but only now was he coming to terms with them.
"My closet. I'll get them for you if you want." Sherlock said, still obviously still absorbed in his laptop.
"Sally Donovan and I, are constantly trying to win the position of the first violin. We are basically equally good at the violin and it just depends on the piece." Sherlock said bitterly staring down at his salad.
"Damn it!" He heard Sherlock shout, followed by the clattering of pans. John winced at the mess Sherlock was making in the kitchen. At least, he was trying.
For about an hour, Sherlock inspected each rose in the shop carefully while John was forced to make conversation with the shop owner: a quirky, middle-aged woman named Diana Reid. She was okay to talk to, although
"Hm? Oh yeah, it's fine." He lied. It was most definitely not fine. He wasn't sure if he could handle being so close to John with such few articles of clothing on.
John didn't know where his destination was or when he would arrive, but he just kept walking. It was too dark to see 20 meters in front of him and the streetlights were his only means of seeing where he was going. How could he do this to Sherlock? He had specifically kept those memories locked away on purpose so that he wouldn’t have to face them. He left every letter from his parents unopened because he didn’t want to face them. He couldn’t. John understood now. He understood all of it too well. What this must be doing to Sherlock… He couldn’t possibly imagine what horrors he went through.
“You’re not going anywhere, young man.” Sherlock wrestled to get his arm free, but it wouldn’t budge. His father’s grip was like an iron clamp.
The second John saw how tight Sherlock’s pants were, he knew he was in trouble. They hugged his lean frame and displayed every perfect muscle in Sherlock’s legs.
"That is how we bond usually. If it weren't for you spilling tea on me, I never would have taken off my clothes in front of you. Which led to you finally working up your courage and admitting your feelings for me while taking me up against a wall aggressively."
When Sherlock got to the mall, it became immediately apparent to him that he had absolutely no idea what he was doing. Buying a ring to propose with was not exactly something he had experience with. He decided to go to the first jewelry store that he saw and go from there.
"Don't worry, I've got some extra clothes that you can wear. Well, it's just a big shirt, but I hope it will work for you?" John led Sherlock into his room. It was small and organized, with a large bed pushed into the corner. What made Sherlock the happiest, though, was what was on the walls. Tons and tons of John's drawings; beautiful drawings.
John stared at the letter as if it was from outer space. He kept forgetting that Sherlock even had parents and that he was, well,
"Only if you promise me that you will shag me very hard back at the flat." Sherlock kissed John again.
"I'll eat something for you since you seem to think it's important," Sherlock said, exasperated. John swelled with pride. Sherlock was eating something for him. That was just about as nice as his flatmate got, and John was overjoyed that he could, at least, convince Sherlock to take care of himself like this. It was highly unlikely that anyone else could.
"We'll be back." His mum huffed indignantly and walked back to the car with her husband. The door was shut. Eyes were met shakily. Shallow breathing and heavy hearts filled the room.
John just stood there, shocked, while Sherlock's ego inflated a tad more as he looked at him with a smug smile. John just shook his head, "Is that a yes then?"
Anderson shot him a look. It was bleak. "All I will say is we are behind, very, very behind, though the label's official word is that everything is moving on schedule."
He watched silently until John moved over to the mantle. When he got to the Grammy's, he decided he'd waited long enough.
Last weekend, international popstar Sherlock Holmes, was spotted inside the men's bathroom stall of famed L.A. hotspot The Viper Room, doing what witnesses said were several lines of cocaine alongside a group of his friends. A source close to us has released these following photos from inside the club, and while the figures can be clearly seen bending over what appears to be a white substance, no one's face is clearly visible, and Sherlock's camp vehemently denies that it was him, even though social media is flooded with tons of photographic evidence showing that Sherlock was at The Viper Room on the night in question.
The last video he clicked on was down in the sidebar; it was an interview done with MTV News. John wasn't sure what he'd been expecting, but holy shit. Sherlock's speaking voice was nothing like his singing voice. His singing voice was a tenor all the way--most male vocalists fell into that category--but when he spoke it was with a velvety rich baritone that John felt in his bones. It was almost.... erotic. And just like his brother, so very posh.
At the top of the bio was a picture; Sherlock was a cute kid, fresh faced and with a trace of baby fat still left in his cheeks. It was obviously not a recent photo. John continued to click through each section, and there was just so much information. From the hospital in Sussex he had been born at, to the names of his parents (Violet and Sigerson), to even the name of a beloved childhood pet (Redbeard), no stone had been left unturned. All the statistics, awards, and minutia about his career was there as well, and he scanned through the surprisingly lengthy discography. He wanted to know more.
"Alright, you've got three seconds to tell me who the hell you are and what the hell you want." Reflexively his left hand curled into a fist, and he pumped it a few times, trying to steady the tremor that had ratcheted up a notch.
John's heart lept up into his throat, and his whole body felt like it was moving in slow motion as he pushed open the bathroom door and flipped on the light. "Oh, shit. Oh no, Sherlock." John fell to his knees at Sherlock's side; he was curled into the fetal position, his head lying next to a pile of fresh vomit, his breaths coming in rapid and shallow and he was barely conscious.
John ignored how once again a total stranger knew things about him, while he was still completely in the dark. If he was smart, he would have said no thank you and split--it was an incredibly dodgy situation--but he was hooked. Damn it, he did get off on danger.
Overall a stunningly good effort for the British singer at his first Met Gala, and dare we say it, we wouldn't be mad if he worked that coat into his regular clothing repertoire.
"Well don't you look like something the cat drug in, dear." She tutted at him, over a sip of her tea. "You and Sherlock were making quite the racket last night. Woke me up from a dead sleep with some rather interesting singing."
With that, John nodded and closed the distance between them with long strides. He then shoved Sherlock up into the wall behind him, while kissing him hungrily. Sherlock gasped and started to unbutton his pants, but John stopped him.
“It appears that the tests were a failure. He shows no change in sexual preference. I’m very sorry that we were not able to help you.” The doctor handed them Sherlock’s paperwork as the frightened teenage boy shrunk away into the nearest corner.
By this time, it was almost midnight and the pavement was luckily devoid of pedestrians that could get into John’s way. As he neared Angelo’s he sprinted even faster. Memories of the very first case that he and Sherlock had ever shared together flooded his mind. He felt his face get hot and a tear escape and run down his cheek at the thought of Sherlock,
“We’ll take those sandwiches to go. I need to get him home.” John says obviously trying not to laugh at Sherlock’s pouty face.
“Sorry. Anyway here’s what I think. On one hand it wasn’t really your fault because you didn’t know what Sherlock’s parents had done to him. But on the other hand, you did snoop in his private things.” John looked down in shame.
"Do you have an extra pencil? I left my pencil case in my locker on accident." John whispered in Sherlock's ear.
“My goodness sir, I am terribly sorry.” The server apologizes profusely. Sherlock feels the gooey mess dripping down him and closes his eyes.
"I love you too, John." Sherlock’s breathing was becoming more faint and John could feel his heartbeat slowing. He heard the sound of sirens coming from the distance as he clung on to Sherlock’s lifeless body in the cold alley.
When they got off of the Eye, John was extremely happy that they were at ground level again, but he was also sad that his first date with Sherlock had come to an end. It was a surreal experience to walk hand in hand through the streets of London with his detective by his side, glancing over at him occasionally and smiling. John felt like a teenager again; all of the new emotions flooding through his body. He was sure that his dopamine levels were extremely high and he felt nothing but happiness as they walked side by side in the afternoon weather.
"Actually, Sally" Sherlock hissed back, "I'm first chair now. I believe second chair has your name on it." Her face went from disbelief to anger in a matter of seconds. She looked over at Mr. Uyehara, but he just nodded.
"Yeah, here." He handed him his nicest pencil and tried to smile normally. The whole concept of flirting was entirely new to Sherlock and he was pretty sure that he was failing miserably. Anderson started his presentation and Sherlock ignored it completely. John slid a piece of paper over to Sherlock that read:
"John," Sherlock said, stopping with a concerned look on his sculpted face. Wait, sculpted? Where had that come from? It's true Sherlock had beautiful cheekbones, but-- Damn, he had done it again.
When John awoke, the flat was silent. He figured Sherlock was busy on his laptop trying to solve the case. He went to the kitchen as silently as possible to make some tea for himself and Sherlock. He hummed quietly and waited for the water to boil. Sherlock sat at the table, his face illuminated by the glow of his laptop. He was completely engrossed and focused until he seemed to notice John’s presence and looked up. John smiled and Sherlock returned it warmly.
Hey, guys. Sorry for not updating in a while. Hopefully, this long chapter will make up for it? Probably not... Please rec this fic to your friends if you think they would like it :)
"You want to know why I never wanted to see my parents ever again? As a teenager, they sent me to clinics to "cure" me of my homosexuality. They let those awful doctors shock me and inject me with all sorts of drugs. They stood by and watched as their youngest son at age 15 was tortured brutally. Mycroft had no idea until they had stopped. He was already away in college by the time they started." Sherlock had his head buried between his knees and was sobbing.
"Don't push your luck." They stepped into their compartment and sat down next to each other. It was quite spacious and there was champagne and truffles as promised in the center. Sherlock poured John a glass and then one for himself.
“To this day, we still wish it had worked.” His father added with an awful edge to his voice. The room became completely silent. You could have heard a pin drop. After almost a full minute, John stood up and walked to the door. He opened it and said “get the hell out of our flat, you monsters. If you ever come here again, let me warn you that I was in the army. I have killed people. I love your son more than you ever have. Get out now.”
He was in so much pain; screaming out. He was screaming at his parents, at Mycroft, at anyone who would help him. Mycroft wasn’t there, but Sherlock knew he could get him out of there. He just kept yelling for his big brother. After weeks and weeks of “tests”, the doctor’s released Sherlock to his parents.
"There's nothing to worry about, love. I've got you." John's heart melted at Sherlock's words. John leaned into his warmth and breathed in the scent that was purely Sherlock. It was a comforting smell that included tea, cinnamon, honey, and something else that John couldn't quite place. They all made him feel comfortable, though, and they made John feel at home. John always knew he had a home with Sherlock in 221B, but now it felt more real; more permanent.
"Great. I'm just going to go pick up some Chinese food for all of us while you do that." Sherlock just kept smiling.
“Calm down, won’t you, love? Everything is going to be okay; I’ll be with you the entire time.” John said, taking Sherlock’s hands, forcing him to stop pacing.
He checked the water for its temperature and slowly got into the shower. He let the water run down his back and legs. It was times like this that John thought of Sherlock the most. His dark curls and perfectly sculpted cheekbones, accenting his face. He was definitely going to try taking a shower with Sherlock some time in the near future.
"You didn't answer my question." He said through gritted teeth. "What the hell are you doing here, at
Sorry for not updating in forever. Writer's block is a bitch... Also, sorry for it being so short. Again, writer's block .-.
“Sherlock why did you always have to take things the wrong way? You still do apparently.” John’s mouth fell open and he met Sherlock’s ashamed gaze.
“We’ll be back,” Sherlock yelled over his shoulder. When they got outside, it was already nighttime and the streetlights that were just now coming on were their only means of seeing. They hailed the first cab that drove by and quickly got in.
"Your playing was brilliant," John said and smiled in Sherlock's direction. He felt his face get warmer.
“Just for a walk, my love. I’ll be safe, I promise.” John still looked worried, but he kissed him slowly and nodded.
“I know you miss him, John.” Harry sat down next to him and put her arm around him comfortingly like their mom used to. Unlike Sherlock’s parents, John’s were not alive anymore. They had passed away in a car accident when John was 11. To this day, he swore that if he ever found the drunk driver responsible for their death, they would wish they were dead.
"Normally people tell me to either shut up or slow down because I talk so fast," Sherlock answered looking anywhere, but John's perfect face.
He clicked on William Holmes and copied down the address onto a piece of paper. He carefully closed the address book and left the laptop looking as if it hadn't been touched at all. Hopefully, Sherlock wouldn't use his deductive skills to figure out what John was doing. He might try to stop him, and that was not going to help. On his own computer, John put the email address into his mail account and thought of what to say. What he finally came up was pretty good.
John was surprised. Sherlock rarely expressed his gratitude unless he was in an exceptional mood. John wasn't complaining, though. Happy Sherlock meant no holes in the wall or just a generally grumpy atmosphere.
Oh my god I am so sorry guys. I've had no motivation to write at all and I finally pushed myself to finish this chapter. Also I'm very sorry if this has many errors. I am TIRED. Love you guys so much :)
“Fine.” He sat up and ran his hands through his hair nervously. Everything seemed darker. As if most of the color had been drained from every object. John didn’t like it one bit.
Sherlock walked over and smiled coldly. "I believe my work here is done. Let's go John." He turned to face Diana. "I'm sure I'll be seeing you again soon." He gave another cold smile and walked out leaving John to wonder what he meant and why they just spent an hour in a flower shop.
"M-me too" Sherlock stuttered and dug his fingernails deeper. John felt a pool of heat collecting in his groin, and he kept thrusting up into Sherlock. After a few more thrusts, John felt himself go over the edge and everything was momentarily white. He was vaguely aware of Sherlock coming to his climax as well and scraping his nails down John's back as he released with a loud shout. They collapsed on the floor in a heap of naked, sweatiness.
After explaining the story multiple times to Harry on the cab drive to her flat, she finally looked like she understood it.
"I'm close, Sherlock," John said, feeling the sweat dripping down his forehead. Sherlock reached out to John and his fingernails dug into his right shoulder.
"Sherlock? You okay?" John called out. Still silence. He moved towards the door and realized why Sherlock had frozen in place. An elderly couple was standing in the doorway.
"Thanks." She gave a small smile that was obviously fake. Everyone knew how she had a crush on Sherlock, but it didn't seem right for her to not know that he and Sherlock were together now and it was okay for her to give up. John was thinking about how he met Sherlock that day in the lab and how lucky he was to have met him. Then he remembered.
John was often made aware of the fact that he was nowhere near as smart as his boyfriend. He had to accept the fact and try his best to keep his jealousy at an absolute minimum to not seem overly possessive. (Not that Sherlock would have minded.) John quickly realized that he had to put his insecurities aside for the moment. They would only distract him from making sure that Sherlock made it back into his arms safely tonight.
“Sherlock, listen…” John started. “No, John. I’m sorry I overreacted. You don’t have to tell me, but I
He got up from the table and walked into Sherlock's room for the letters. He grabbed a piece of stationery, a pen, and sat down once again at the table. It was a bit old-fashioned, yes, but John didn't know their emails. Unless... He reached for Sherlock's laptop but hesitated. This was getting to be too much; first, he was looking at Sherlock's things and now this? He took a deep breath and told himself repeatedly it was for the greater good.
John knew that he had to help Sherlock in whatever way he could, but he wasn’t sure how to. There was no easy way to deal with Sherlock’s parents. They weren’t going to give up without seeing and talking to Sherlock so that needed to happen. John just had to make sure that Sherlock was comfortable and that the right things were said in their conversation.
"Good evening, Captain Watson." John got up from the bed and walked over towards Sherlock with long, confident strides.
"Let's have the violins and cellos look at measure 57. Who can tell me what volume we going to play it at?" John raised his hand and was called on.
The wineglass that Sherlock had been holding shattered to the floor and Sherlock took that opportunity to use both of his hands to bring John closer to him. He ran his hands through John’s hair and he let out a soft moan. John could feel Sherlock’s erection through his pants, and he experimented by rubbing his own against it. Immediately, a ripple of pleasure made its way through John’s body and he groaned in time with Sherlock.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice flooded through his thoughts and into his brain. He sat up on the sofa groggily and opened his eyes. The afternoon light was flooding through the crack in the closed curtains.
Their tongues were in a fight for dominance; both of them tangling and rubbing against each other in time to their grinding. Sherlock gave up and John leaned as close to him as he could.
"Sure, I wouldn't mind," John said trying to keep a poker face. "Wonderful. I'll see you in a few minutes. We'll take a cab," Sherlock said grabbing his coat and putting on his navy blue scarf. John was sure something would go wrong, but if Sherlock had a lead, it was only right that he should tag along.
"God, Sherlock. Are you kidding me? There's no one like you. You're extraordinary and unique." John seemed like he believed everything he was saying.
"Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, please have a seat," John said, keeping his hand firmly placed on his back. They entered the flat and took everything in. Sherlock could tell by the looks on their faces that they weren't impressed in the slightest. He could also tell that they were suppressing their rude remarks about how untidy and disorderly everything was. He had experiments that he had yet to finish on the kitchen table, and piles of books stacked virtually anywhere there was space.
