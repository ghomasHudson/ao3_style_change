Since these past events, there was a secret service was experiencing this remote collapse. The advantage was that they could think of strategies, look for help, move forward with the support and solicitation of the government. No, contrary to what you might think, it wasn’t MI6. The MI6 who was far too preoccupied with gathering the ashes of MI5, while managing his own problems. They were Saville Row’s luxury tailors. Harry Hart and Kingsman, 'the independents'' as Gareth Mallory liked to call them, were for once quiet and able to handle what others could not. Amazing, when we knew their agents had been through hell.
He delayed his business to come to the young woman. Once in front of her, his hands stroked her cheeks with infinite tenderness. For her, he was doomed. The two had loved each other, but as the love faded, and their routine, which had taken place when the two had moved to Switzerland, he bore it less and less. It had finally reached its climax during the holidays they were on in Jamaica. In the end, the two had nothing but affection for each other. Bond had come to understand that he loved Madeleine but was not in love with her.
"What about him?" she said when pointing to Lestrade who was being looked after by nurses.
All turned to the voice that seemed to come from behind them. Mallory tightened up to his voice, he sighed again and showed his most serious look forward to their interlocutor.
"If he is dead, then who is the one that Guillaume and I saw?"
"If it’s not for your country, do it for him." Sherlock finished.
"This is not a triple attack. This is a quadruple attack."
"John! Sherlock! I mean! Where the hell have you been?"
"Sorry to interrupt your passionate conversation but you know I’m here, so I can hear you." the voice of Hazel sounded like an echo, Guillaume looked at her with a look that seemed to analyse her. He sighed and turned to Marina before letting them in.
"I will." She said, watching the blonde walk away and leave her definitively.
"I had to see that with my own eyes in order to know what to do." Mycroft said, approaching them, Anthea followed him closely and turned to look at John for whom she had her usual little smile. "You are relieved of the case at the moment. I take care of the rest."
"Are they
"Oh, I see ... I hope the change is that the office is more inclusive now !" She said smiling. Marina laughed at Hazel, who was right, the BDL, finally Bureau des Légendes, had meanwhile become more inclusive since her arrival and the return of Malotru.
"Madeleine, I’m just..."
They had already been living together for 3 years and had made their relationship official. They had two dogs, a new apartment and especially a lot of love for each other. And since Kingsman had evolved, Eggsy was less on a mission as the newbies took over with great skill, leaving him and Harry to live a normal life as a couple.
"No. I’ve already had enough watching it." Sherlock laughed. "I don’t hate him if that’s what you’re laughing at, Sherlock. I see what’s going on out there. Not funny. Mycroft is concerned, but not only by that."
"News from London?" asked Marie-Jeanne, settling in her place.
Goosebumps, thanks for reading ! If you have anything to tell, feel free to comment this post, i'll answer for sure ! Hope you've enjoyed this first chapter.
"Yes, I'm sure you found perverse ways to put your favorite puppet back on track."
"What should I see Tanner?"
At least once a month, he went to visit Eurus, their little sister, in Sherrinford prison with Sherlock and his parents if they did not leave. Their last visit was long before the attacks and shortly after Sherlock and John's wedding. Sherlock’s marriage had been a real event for everyone. Sherlock being a public figure, it had made a lot of talk. Already, it was weirdly surprising to see that so many people were 'shipping' Sherlock and John as if they were fictional characters, but in addition it had ended up reassuring John about his fear of judgement for his bisexuality. Because everyone thought it was great and it even brought him closer to Harry. But the subject of the day was certainly not going to be the wedding or Rosamund's official adoption. Mycroft knew that as always Eurus would judge them, them and their actions. Well, only if Sherlock could be on time.
"How can you know?"
"Oh okay..." Marina shook her head.
"Leave him to Mycroft. Right now, I can’t get much out of it."
Raymond seemed to be getting better, but he was terribly tired. This reassured Marina, she knew that the hunt for Debailly and covering Jonas with Iodine 3 had been hard for him.
Mallory sketched a smile for Moneypenny, who gave it back to him and waved to Bill to turn to Mr. The relationship between Eve and Gareth really seemed to have improved. The two had come to know and even appreciate each other.
It was necessary to admit that Dr. Balmes was of a great help, like all the military doctors but she was also very intrusive. It was strange because she was extremely respectful towards the entire team. She was the one who insisted on taking care of all the agents.
"If you say so," Sherlock replied with an arrogant smile.
Marie-Jeanne who was the last to leave, turned to Marina and Hazel with a benevolent smile.
or rather a clandestine was an honor and that only the best of the best were recruited, so it was always interesting to see what a new agent has to prove.
"Nice to meet you." their words echoed.
Little by little the Latin text was subtitled by the translation of each sentence. Bill began to read them aloud while waiting for a sign from Q, who carried his cup of tea to his mouth as if to tell him to start.
"Eggsy." murmured Harry in a breath.
"Promise me you’ll take care of yourself."
"From the beginning, we had been prevented of the situation, indeed, but nobody understood that this was what it was about."
No one imagined that action and words would eventually merge. It left a bitter taste in Mr. He thought that the person who orchestrated this triple attack was certainly the same person who had been harassing Q-Branch for a month. He had heard from MI5, their numbers were definitely reduced. The country’s internal security was compromised and the losses were substantial.
Fiona got up early, a hard day for her, full of appointments for her newborn and things to finish here and there. She had just completed an article on the Brexit she sent to the Daily Mirror and was very happy to be on maternity leave so that she could do it at home. Her husband took care of their daughter so that she could get ready in time for a bus instead of the subway.
"I have her legendary file if you want, I can give it to you when you're done, I thought MJ gave it to you."
"So this is the office where the Colonel sometimes comes to check that everything is going well between us and that no one is killing each other. Otherwise, in general, you will find him in Marie-Jeanne’s office, in a crisis cell or in his office at the DGSE. In fact, we don’t see much of him. Now I think I’ve told you everything about our department." The young woman paused a moment and looked at her future colleague, making sure that she had followed.
"What exactly are we waiting for?" "Take me to St Mary's." he said in an exhausted voice, looking at John and Sherlock.
"And its legend? She holds her legend under alcohol?" Balmes asked again, eating her salad.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock. Where are you now?"
"So the biggest terror of this world in reality? Yes, you are not uninteresting otherwise you would not be there, especially when you carry out an attack."
Mycroft continued to fix Sherlock who resumed his seriousness. He knew that when we spoke of Q, it was always tense. Always sensitive. Always complicated. All three held on to Q more than anything and even Eurus. Even if she only saw him from afar or in a covered way, he was his favorite.
"What about the Statesmen?"
"You want to go alone?"
"I hope Molly has nothing." John murmured. Sherlock turned to him to give him a reassuring smile.
"Marina ?"
"Anyway, forget, have you got some news from London?"
"Uninteresting." spat the terrorist. "I am a hetero cis white man."
"Why are you taking him with you?" asked William in a cold tone.
"I hope so." She smiles at him.
"Are you worried about our brother? You see Mycroft, I would like to help you but I still can not see him, since you've forbidden me."
"All right. Now close the door and don’t say a word."
"Sherlock? Sherlock!"
It was raining international tributes since the Queen spoke publicly to reassure the public. The government had planned a national tribute and MI6 had to stop its own activities to devote itself to it. The press took great pleasure in feeding both fear and hope, which meant that everyone had their opinion on the situation. The headline of the Sun read, 'Are we still safe today? '.
You will not be bored. I promess.
Their eyes crossed, Madeleine’s gaze was tinged with anger. And James, he was both elsewhere and present.
"Ugh ... Well, John and I will do our research on our side, if we get something, we'll come back to you, in the meantime, contact Mycroft and do what you have to do. I’m sure your men will be very happy not to see me on this big case any longer." Sherlock replied the most seriously and ironically in the world before resuming his way to the exit.
." Marina cut off to prevent her from saying more. "I'm here, I help with the mission, I'm fine." she said, supporting his words. "I'll bring you back Hazel's file."
"Yes ?"
"What ? What... What do you mean Sherlock ?"
"She's fine, Guillaume is working on it too, I get the feeling that at two it's going faster and she's learning fast." Marina smiled at her as she finished her sentence.
"As always, it makes you wonder if she doesn’t feel anything for him. But, I take it." She sighed before shooting her cigarette. " I hate him for it."
"Here's the freak."
"He’s busy, Bill!"
"Gonna be complicated sir. I'll do my best, ye."
She glanced at hze again before leaving the canteen. She crossed the premises and stopped in the yard to smoke a cigarette. Balmes had noticed her change of attitude, still happy that she thought it was because of the Russians and everything that had happened because of the FSB. After all, it's true that being a hostage was a traumatic experience, but that was to be expected with a such job.
"I was protecting France. I was not breaking the codes. Much less the code of loyalty, thank you. I know who she is and you’re not answering my question. Good to see you again, Odelair."
"I’m coming, darling. I absolutely wish to finish this now or Mycroft will come tomorrow and I’d like to avoid Merlin having a migraine." he answered calmly as the young man had already entered his office.
knew you."
"What do you know?" she quietly added.
"Go ahead. I’ll look through the camera. I’ll be very careful."
Bill and Eve came close behind him, both paying close attention to the Quartermaster’s response.
Fiona started moving, looked at her phone that rang, it was a reminder. It was 10:30 am, there were five minutes left to be there. It was always 10:30 am when a thud was heard. Black smoke filled the landscape and her lungs, Sarah woke up crying. Cries, many cries were heard while being clogged by the shrill sound that pierced her ears. Passers-by ran in every direction and people were covered with dust, with blood and debris. Fiona was as if paralyzed, a man came to her aid and drove her away. But another thud, was heard in a little distance. Several passers-by shouted when they saw the same smoke invade the sky, some began to shout that it was Hyde Park without being sure. Suddenly, shots were fired, Fiona fell to the ground, the man with her too, he had been shot. Fiona did her best to calm Sarah’s tears, which became more and more insistent, but they drowned from the multitude of cries of the crowd. Between these men, these women, these children or teenagers who were looking for a way out of this certain death that awaited them.
"Well, the program has already begun, so has the final phase of Miss Odelair’s training. This meeting is over." launched Colonel MAG on his way out of the crisis cell, which made the rest of the room follow him.
"Oh, yeah. She’s fine, she was shocked. She was sent to St Mary’s Hospital, but she has nothing physically."
Eggsy could only smile. He put his lips on his lover and engaged a kiss that quickly became languorous with desire. He was no longer thinking about the film, the bombings, or France, in his mind there was only Harry, the man of his life.
"Dinner's ready, Haz. Leave the work at work."
"Oh, all right, excuse me for being polite." She turned to Hazel who smiled at Guillaume. "Soon Hazel will be on the field, we must integrate her, make her feel good among us."
"He's better, he's no longer shocked by the event itself, but he's more .. How to say ... Hm, bitter that he lost the main track to the brain of the operation. I gave him time to get back on his feet but now we’re not moving forward and I need him."
Sherlock watched the eye-to-eye duel between the two and couldn’t help but want to laugh.
"Tell me something I don’t know."
The fascination was present on the faces of passers-by who came to hurry to try to see the scene, the dead, the police securing the place. All this, this morbid voyeurism, this fascination with horror, Greg Lestrade didn’t understand it as much as he could understand it.
"Madeleine, it’s over."
"No way! She’s not ready!"
Q backed back and placed himself behind his computer, making several manipulations.
Special thanks to my beta reader Léa and my twitter readers who are really helpful with their support xxx
Raymond frowned as he stared at Marina. He could read her like an open book, if Marina had told her that it was not trivial. She wanted to tell him something because she was hiding something, and if there was anyone who could help him, it was definitely him, who was in charge of the watchman service.
"What about you, detective?"
"You know very well who.
"Welcome to the
"Lieutenant! You need help?"
has changed."
Further on, another thud made itself heard in the city leaving a hospital in flames. It was the hardest to see, the screams were present, the emotional shock too. Death had hit St Bartholomew Hospital and this time it wasn’t just a picture. Three attacks, within minutes of each other, London was torn open.
"Of course he needs help, dark fool. Even in the worst moments, you are not able to have an ounce of intelligence." spit out Sherlock by picking up Lestrade and moving him forward.
(See the end of the chapter for
The two men began to walk towards the building. They had not seen each other for some time. Both were far too busy and Sherlock was solving cases that people would leave him on his blog or via Twitter to pass the time and ignore Mycroft.
"Do you remember Max Denbigh?"
"All right, go on then. Don’t complain if I eat everything. Oh, by the way, we have answers from the baguettes!"
"But, I brought my violin back! John and Rosie had to do. You don’t ask Mycroft about Lestrade?"
"Yes, them." Eggsy’s narcissistic smile seemed to display a childish joy. Knowing what that means, Harry looked at Eggsy slightly surprised.
Malotru had returned in 2015 and since then, the problems had only deepened further, to the point that the French Intelligence had also been in danger, the loyalty of the agents had been put to the test. Especially of Malotru who had difficulty at first to abandon his legend and to resume his life, then other problems that this basic problem had engendered. In addition to the number of double and triple agents in the DGSE and the Bureau.
"Sure they would agree. They knew that Mycroft would eventually contact them. Yet, they are as surprised as we are."
"You’re in deep shit." He said in a cold tone before looking at his colleagues. " Take him. I want to have him a little bit before the intelligence takes it away."
"John and his bloody hat. Sorry, it burned in a fire." Sherlock glared at his brother. "Are you new here?"
"The French."
Four years, that’s right. It was a long time, four years trying to find a way to live peacefully together, to establish stability, to love each other, to make love. But also four years of thinking that retirement, while deserved, was boring. He should have been there, he should have experienced the attacks in London, the deaths of the MI5 agents with them. He backed away and looked at Madeleine before opening his suitcase to finish it.
"It happened once, and it’s more complicated than you think. "
"Yeah, the woman who looks like the child in The Ring. She is on the 7th floor, she was moved and put in a new, bigger room. And now she has a telly too. Here are your access passes." She was staring at the luggage that Sherlock had with him. "What do you have there, Mr. Holmes?"
Having almost all been decimated, the remaining four had succeeded in eliminating those who sought to destroy their inheritance. This reviving their rivalry with the MI6. Of these four agents, Harry Hart became the new Arthur, Merlin resumed his Quartermaster's duties, despite his infirmity. Roxanne "Roxy" Morton also known as Lancelot, who had managed to survive the explosion of their headquarters, remained the best knight of the agency. And Gary "Eggsy" Unwin had to go through a lot of twists like saving the world again or being dumped by the Princess of Sweden on their wedding day. Maybe it was crazy but at least he was staying at Kingsman and Harry was back in his life. Today, the agency was stronger than ever, and had new recruits, both knights and simple agents operating for Kingsman had everything back in their hands. A whole new era was present since 2016.
They were all amazed.
"Never mind, say it."
"And you're not a mere inspector, you're Sherlock Holmes, and if I know you, it's because
At the agreement of this voice, Holmes turned and ran towards the voice, Anderson followed him and the two fell on Lestrade’s limp to reach them.
When she heard that name, the young woman turned to the voice calling her away. The glance of a piercing blue finally captured her interlocutor, walking towards her, the young woman combed her hair, placing her strand of hair on her side in the wake of her short hazel hair. Once arrived in front of two women, displaying gracious smiles despite eyes slightly tinged with fatigue, Rocambole smiled to them followed by a "Hello Marie-Jeanne, Hello Rim."
"Who is this?" corrected Harry with a teasing smile that made his boyfriend melt.
"Who are you ?" Sherlock asked, still impassive.
A minion noted the sentence that had just appeared on the screen in the notebook he was holding. There were other unreadable sentences in the sight of Bill, Eve and Gareth.
"I know. It has been for some time."
"And they are. But, I can’t use my secret card now, can I?"
"What is it, Marina?" Raymond got close to her looking into his.
"Raymond. I’m glad to see you. It feels good." They both hugged each other. The embrace was strange, it was peaceful but at the same time full of emotions. Marina finally backed up and pulled out her package to offer a cigarette to the superior of the watchmen section and friend. " At least I know you’re not mad at me."
"Crisis cell 1." said the director of the department.
Marina was the most recent clandestine. She had never seen an officer go through the same process as her. She was thrilled, she also knew that becoming a future
"You can ... You can help us this time? Really ? Sherlock." Greg asked.
"Sir, you should come and see this."
"Okay, I’ll try to be gentler with their agent when he or she is with us."
"You don’t know and you brought me here for this?"
"Who spits in the sky, it falls back on his face... Soon to come on you." Mallory finished, frowning.
When she was about to speak again but gets interrupted by a tall, slender, thin man with brown hair, tired features and grave eyes. It was him, Malotru.
"Um, yes, yes. Greg, we’ll come and see you at St Mary’s. Mycroft, Anthea."
"If we have a baby, one day, I should be sweeter with them." Eggsy's voice was innocent, as was the look he gave to his lover.
"Not yet, but let us not dwell on it. We have to do here, Marie-Jeanne." replied the colonel. "Rocambole."
After all, getting to the BDL even when you're an experienced agent is always a little complicated. So, for a new agent who has only been through the DGSE before that can be complicated.
"Lestrade!"
Rim, the assistant to the director of the department, gave her a radiant smile as a greeting. How could she always be in shape with everything she had to deal with? She admired her sincerely.
"This is not the subject!" Eggsy retorted, dramatizing his voice and gestures.
"Yes, he was the head of one of MI5's services, he died in 2015, why?"
Did he think that showing latent homophobia with sufficient air would destabilize him?
"St Bartholomew Hospital, please." John answers by fastening his belt.
Sherlock stepped back without losing his guard. He did not know why but this "he" had made him feel a strange feeling.
Lestrade and other policemen, including Sally who had not left him, and experts exchanged with Sherlock before he entered the room. Sherlock had nothing against all that heavy atmosphere, he could deal with it. He felt all of John’s benevolence with him through his eyes so it had to be okay.
"Here. Talking to yourself now? Although it turns out to be an excellent practice for mental health."
I hope you've enjoyed this new chapter !  If you have anything to tell, feel free to comment this post, thanks for reading ! peace out homies
"You didn’t even bring your daughter and John, I’m disappointed."
i left you on a cliffhanger last so.... hehehe
Sherlock said nothing and kept looking at the man who seemed to be losing confidence.
A silence settled again and Mycroft sighed.
"Indeed, you are uninteresting."
"Mycroft, you know I hate to start something without finishing it, Lestrade will eventually come back to me." he said, adding a small smile before passing the retinal scanner to go to the reception where the secretary seemed to be waiting for them.
Hazel looked at them without understanding, and their glances simultaneously posed on the young woman before Marina shot her to chase Guillaume Debailly.
"You will make a wonderful father."
"It’s me we’re waiting for." The voice was too familiar to their ears. Greg sighed of both frustration and relief. Sherlock looked at Mycroft with a distrust.
"Why ?" she asked, following the two women into the offices.
"You know it’s going to continue, don’t you... ? Mycroft, you can’t rule out any help, I see, we’re offering you help."
The young stranger in the room stood up and she was beautiful, indeed. Her hair was slender, well in the flesh, pinned in a bun, and baby hairs were also pinned to her forehead. She was in her twenties and had a minimalist style that was too stylized for a DGSE officer. It was obvious that she was noticed with these many rings on her fingers. Her eyes were fixed on Marina, they were brown and gave her an intense look. It was almost fascinating.
"You’re late." Eurus' voice was cold. Sherlock sketched a smile and Mycroft walked towards her. "Is it just the two of you? Not Dad, not Mum?"
To reassure him, Sherlock gave him a smile before returning to his path with him, more slowly this time. John knew that smile, it's the one which felt like a kiss on his lips, so yeah he trusted him and his
"Marina!"
"Not them but the British government, you have no idea how much." Marina’s remark made him smile. " Kingsman will know what to do with Hazel better than us."
"He was with you before John and I left the building! You must know! Use your brain, damn it!"
"If you say so."
"Have you waited all this time to dare to come to the scene of the attacks?"
Anthea nodded as she looked at her new phone.
"For the French... That’s okay. They’re going to help." threw Eggsy in the middle of the movie, caressing JB.
"Who ?" Sherlock asked.
We don’t know yet. We were trying to put the sentences in order so that she could say something more meaningful." answered R with annoyance. She looked at the minion and gave him the signal to give the notebook to 006 who watched with calm Olympian Q in his maneuver.
It was strange how a person could come into your life and change everything, destroy everything without warning. But if Rocambole had returned from Iran, or rather, had been removed from Iran, it was also for this reason. Every time she stepped into the office, something was going on, and there she felt something was going to happen.
"You and I, here, are talking, what do you want to hear, Sherlock Holmes."
Lestrade looked around him, Scotland Yard had to do the job, the secret service could not always have the hand, especially in a story with so many wounded and dead. His men would hate him again, Sally and Anderson would want to kill him, but they came with him all the way to Piccadilly. John had even participated in the observation of the corpses, he knew he was not going to go far without them. He sighed as he looked at his colleague.
"He?" asked Sherlock perplexed. What could he be talking about? Sherlock was no longer really following.
"Rocambole, you will be in charge of Hazel’s training at the Bureau. Malotru will be able to assist you in this task if necessary, he will be Hazel’s chief reference in her mission." Marie-Jeanne added.
Eve sighed at Tanner. She stood back and watched Gareth Mallory glare at his Chief of Staff. Bill could only throw a discreet "Excuse me." before turning to Eve who raised her eyebrows as if to tell him she had warned him.
"You're suspicious, I understand, but these are our best allies."
"The government is getting involved." Sherlock added, looking at his brother. "Let's go, John."
"Bloddy hell, Sherlock! What the hell are you doing hiding like that?"
In the rubble of the explosion, they were looking for him. Sherlock and John were on the lookout, they both thought the explosion had to come from the room where the terrorist had been left. They were indeed right, the explosion generated by the suicide bomber arrested in Piccadilly had caused part of the Scotland Yard offices to collapse. It was weird. Scotland Yard attacked. Scotland Yard joined the other three places. It was the drop of water that broke the camel or the icing on the cake.
"You shut me out of the case, Mycroft!" Sherlock shouted back. "You know damn well I need cases like this."
"Over 7 years of working together and you still can’t call me Mycroft. How heartbreaking, M." He said, shaking hands with Gareth and then moving forward to greet everyone. "Mr. Tanner. Miss Moneypenny. R. 006. Q." He said, shaking hands and finally standing beside Q to give him a slight smile that Q gave him back. "I’m listening."
"If you show me what you have right now, maybe I can help you find out."
weak?"
He took out his violin, Mycroft sat down and watched his brother and sister play in harmony as usual, while coguing on his words. Even if their siblings were the strangest, they understood each other, they supported each other and maybe they really loved each other. They knew they had to protect the one thing that really connected them, a person, their little brother who also turned out to be the young Quartermaster of MI6.
"Oh joy." Sherlock's voice was flat and sarcastic.
He glanced up and saw John. He winked and grinned around the toy.
Mike nodded. He couldn’t help much with the guns and bad guys, but science? Science he knew something about.
She sat across from him at the table and got a good look at his face as he stared listlessly at the slice of brown cake on the plate. His eyes were puffy and red. His curls were lanky with grease and he had a bit of a funk about him. He looked liked he'd aged ten years in a week.
“Holy shit.”
“Well that changes things a little bit.” Greg said, slipping the page back in the envelope. “Sherlock was being antagonized by this bastard.” He looked at the sub, then at John. “John, could you step outside for a moment?”
John laughed. "Well, that's the story anyway. Every house has a its own protector."
“John.” He reached over and flapped at John’s back, buried under a pile of blanket.
"I've streamlined the process. I'll have it done in time."
Sherlock spied some mistletoe tucked above a door and walked over to it with a small "oh!" and planting himself underneath. John watched him, one brow up in confusion. Sherlock curled his fingers, beckoning. Curious, John came closer until he was standing beside the prince. Sherlock reached out and grabbed his lapels to pull him into a breathless kiss.
“He hasn’t texted…” John sent a fifth text to his sub, asking if he got to Bart’s okay. The meal was mostly over and there were only a few leavings left in the dishes.
"It's just, you zoned out, or something. For a long while."
Sherlock sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now who tried to kill you?” Sherlock asked.
John stared. This had been the last thing he was expecting. He was expecting to be told to get on the bed and into some sort of creative position. Asking for help on an assassination attempt, well, that was a new one.
“Me too.” He tilted his head and kissed the part of Sherlock’s cheek that he could reach, and settled his hands comfortably on the sub’s back. He could feel him humping slowly against his groin and the heat was delicious. “Did you still want to do some dom and sub stuff tonight?”
And sent it off. He put the phone down and went back to the microscope, a little grin playing at his lips.
"The highwaymen?" She asked, her voice an awed whisper.
The boys get Mike's hint, but Sherlock is stubborn. Fortunately, so is John.
“There you go. Good boy.” John petted his damp hair. “We’ll talk tomorrow, love. Sleep now, just settle and sleep.”
“What do you think?”
“So what if it is?”
Sherlock nodded and leaned back on the headboard, looking up at John with adoring eyes. His knees were splayed apart and his cock was red and hard. The blush of pink on his bum matched his flushed neck and ears and he watched John put the paddle away in the box and take a little bottle of lube out before closing the lid. He opened and closed his mouth a few times to stretch his jaw, then rolled his sleeves up. He crawled onto the bed and Sherlock watched him with bright eyes.
"A king has many priorities, yes." Mycroft said, trying to shift the subject away from Jim's sick fixations. "Do you keep as close an eye over Hibern's economy as you do your pets in the herana? Are your people content? Fed? Employed?" Mycroft’s emotions were clouding his judgment. He reined himself in with a quiet, deep breath. Mycroft had seen the starving people and barren lands on route to the west coast. Farms were patchy and many homes ramshackle and run down. Roads were in disrepair and Gregory had reported sightings of bandits and thieves—likely Hibern’s infamous highwaymen gang—trailing their carriages. They’d stayed in the manor home of one of Jim’s lords. The poor man and his wife were on edge the whole time, terrified that they’d offend their King or his guest and be sent to the gallows. Mycroft had seen at once the lord’s threadbare waistcoat, the skillfully repaired holes in the lady’s dress.
John stared at him. Whether or not it
“I’m not saying this is where he is, but he’s been in and out of drugs since I’ve known him.”
“Come to the Yard with me.” John picked up his phone to text Greg. “We’ll give statements.”
“Just your ribs and then you can sleep again.” John promised. “Lean forward.” John braced his arm across his sub’s chest and the nurse raised the head of the bed. Sherlock tilted forward and John shucked the gown up. This one hurt. He grit his teeth and squeezed the hell out of John’s arm as the nurse efficiently stripped the bandage, cleaned the stab wound stitches, and stuck new gauze on there, all in about a minute.
“Can we use the crop again?” Sherlock asked hopefully.
“And that night is when you were drugged?”
“Lestrade won’t let anything happen to me.” Sherlock said it with complete confidence and conviction. “He hasn’t yet.”
"You've not left your cabin all day‒"
“Let me rub some lotion on your sore spots, then you can look at the footage, okay?” John stroked his arm, not wanting to lost him to the case and the mind palace so early in the day. “I
John froze and blinked at him. "I, your Highness, I'm…getting prepared?"
Sherlock growled and waved the little voice away. It was true, and it hurt, so he ignored it.
There was a slight awkward pause.
Paul stopped talking and Mary stared at Sherlock with her best "I'm judging the hell out of you and finding you wanting" face on.
"I thought the general 'stay out of danger' was implied!" John snipped.
"You're welcome, dear."
"Thanks." He said. "And that looks lovely."
"Have a biscuit, dear."
Mycroft leaned back in his chair and dabbed daintily at his mouth. "Stealing money away from merchants who hope to make a living in London?" Mycroft asked, shrugging. "What are you thinking?"
“Yes. Do you hurt?” Sherlock asked.
"I think so. Do I need stitches?" Sherlock asked.
"Morning, Kate." He raised his brows. “Something wrong?”
“No, sir.”
“Do you talk to him about the war?”
“Yes!” Sherlock scrabbled on the desk and clenched his arse muscles.
"Alright?" John asked.
“Mm, good, so good. You make me feel so good, Sherlock. This is wonderful.”
He rubbed some numbing ointment onto his skin and stood up. He adjusted his collar and sparkling earrings and lifted his chin.
“Do you want to make me tea?”
"Oh that sounds fun!" Molly said. "Greg and I aren't doing anything tonight." She and Greg had been dating for a few months.
“I have a case.”
John stood, silent and fuming and terrified. He tried not to tremble.
"Now that's the kind of ending I like." Mel said as the cameras swarmed the couple.
A sense of loneliness washed over him like a tide. Sherlock wasn’t here and Walker was dead. That’s all there was to it. He had no idea when he’d see his boy again, but he’d never wanted to hug him as badly as he did now.
“Good lad.”
John licked his lips. “You’re swollen and red, but there’s no blood. Did you have any bleeding yesterday, love?”
“Are you in pain?”
“Excellent. Get dressed.” John kissed him. “We have to go.”
John could only kneel there, stricken, numb, and nauseous as the rest of it played out. Guards led Edgar up to the dias, put the noose 'round his throat. John said a quick prayer to himself, the words jumbled and frantic even in the confines of his own head. The noose tightened, the door dropped. Edgar's neck snapped cleanly and John knew that was the best he could hope for.
It wasn't a familiar arrow, certainly not one of the ones on his mud-soaked back. He'd been the only one today on the hunt to carry arrows so that must mean there was someone else in the woods‒someone who wanted him dead. He blinked. Who in Hibern wanted him dead? He didn't know anybody here. Unless he was mistaken for someone else?
“It’ll just take a tiny bit of the sting out. You’ll still feel it. Hand me that flannel.”
“That’s not why I made that noise, and remember what I said? You never need to ask.” Sherlock said.
She stood beside him and hugged him, her arm around his shoulder. "I know you didn’t. We do worry about you though, Sherlock. I worry. I don’t like you smoking that rubbish. You’re better than that.”
Fingers tapped his hip and he looked back down. Oh God. John
"Oh dear, I worried that it might be too advanced for you but His Majesty insisted! I take full responsibility! I should have considered what sort of rider you were."
“And how it would be nice if you actually had a competent assistant?”
Sherlock smirked. "That's not what people normally say."
Sherlock grabbed the pillow. John sat on the far side of the sofa and angled the table out so he could access both his and Sherlock’s dishes easily.
“I don’t care.” He said.
“After dinner, I’m taking you the hell down and fucking you into the mattress.”
He swept out of the office in search of Lestrade.
“Sit up. I’ll unclamp you.”
“I wasn’t
“No—”
“I hope he says yes.” Mike added, glancing at the phone. “He’s about as social as a rock, but he’s been at our flat a few times and he’s always at the hospital.”
An ambulance roared into view. Mycroft strolled across the street, unruffled as ever, and pulled Lestrade aside, speaking to him. Sherlock watched the paramedics check Seb’s vitals and load him up. John was facing the wall, still breathing hard. He was quieting under Sherlock’s hand and voice and the sub watched his brother. He spoke confidently to the Officer, who was nodding. Mycroft gestured to John and Sherlock and Greg sighed. He put his cuffs away. Sherlock wondered what he was telling him.
John continued speaking in that no nonsense dominant tone. “We still need to sign some paperwork and then I’m taking you home and I’m going to look at that arm that you’re favoring.”
He sighed and stood up. There was no way he’d go back to sleep. He was wide awake and without John beside him he wouldn’t be able to anyway. He went out into the kitchen and grabbed his phone, wondering if John would want to sub again. He doubted it somehow. Last time, John hadn't taken off out of the flat after the nightmare. He opened up the text thread he had with John and his thumbs hovered over the keyboard. He couldn’t think of a single thing to say. He put the phone down and went to his violin, placing it on his chin and putting his hands on autopilot.
Sherlock made a pouty face at the phone. Dinner. People and wine and sitting, ulgh. He headed for the Tube and texted him back.
“Hold still.” John told him. “Back straight and don’t huff or sigh anymore. Tell me, why are you over there?”
He tossed and turned and sweat all night, throwing up into hastily provided bowls. If his nausea subsided, he couldn't get comfortable. If he was sweating, he was exhausted. If he slept, nightmares plagued him every moment.
“Angelo’s is close if you want lunch.” Sherlock suggested. The lure of free carbohydrates and tomato cream sauce was too much to resist, and John laced their fingers together as they strolled the two streets over.
John was mostly wrong. Sherlock wasn't beginning an experiment, he was already well underway. John, fully dressed to face the day, was treated with the sight of every piece of living room furniture draped protectively with white cloths and Sherlock's rear end sticking out of the ashy, dirty fireplace. He'd left the tree uncovered and it now sported a fine mist of charcoal. John didn't care. Some people used flocking and tinsel on their tree, they used hearth ash.
“Not now.” Sherlock shook his head. Lestrade glanced at John. “Later. I’ll call.” He got into his car. The ambulance was gone and he merged into traffic, disappearing up the road. Whatever Mycroft had told him must have worked.
“Where else do you think he would go?” She asked calmly. Betsy walked over to the curtains and pushed one aside, peering up and down the street.
“I know. You always want all the answers. There’s just better ways to go about finding said answers. If you had Lestrade with you and if I was aware of the situation, it would have been fine. If you had me with you, it would have been fine. Better, anyway.”
"Let's see who we have here." A cultured Britannian voice spoke from inside the carriage. The man, elegantly dressed in a rich green overcoat and silvery-white shirt, descended the narrow steps. He took a lantern hanging from the side of the carriage and approached John and tugged his gaiter away. He blinked, surprised, before a satisfied grin crossed his smarmy face. "Well it must be my lucky day." His voice was soft and he spoke slowly. “Captain John Watson. You've been making quite a name for yourself in this little…” he glanced at John’s team, each held fast like he was. “…ragtag group of yours. You've a positively massive price on your head and when I deliver you to King Moriarty, we'll both get what we deserve. How convenient. I was on my way to visit him anyway."
"Yes I can manage!" John pushed him away and tore open the yeast.
Sherlock grinned at her annoyed face and tugged his arm out of her grasp and strode away. “Car grease!” he called over his shoulder.
They went back to the sofa, each drinking in silence for a few moments, watching the flickering fire cast the room in glowing crimson gold. The room warmed up and a pleasant heat settled in Sherlock’s throat.
"To who?"
“Thank you.” He said quietly. It was small, and John had seemed to get it with relative ease, but no one had ever given him a more perfect gift. Not since his grandmother had brought them a red furry puppy one year for Christmas when he was very young. Seb certainly hadn’t encouraged his experiments much, getting him expensive tie pins and cuff links instead. He didn’t even wear tie pins. He and Mycroft didn’t usually exchange gifts. He admitted to himself that he was moved with something very close to emotion.
John stared at him, panting, teeth grit, as Jim left the dungeons and the doors clanged shut once more.
“Oh, that’s impertinent.” He pulled back. “Who’s in charge here?” He asked. Sherlock looked away, his lips twisted in a little smirk.
on you?!” He growled.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and smirked. Oh this was just too perfect.
Sherlock raked his hand through his hair. It was so much easier when he was alone, in a way, but it was so much better with John at his side now. His thoughts drifted to Lotto, his dealer, and he rolled his eyes. It was easy when he was stressed out about a case to just pop over and buy what his body craved, but he wouldn’t. Not now. Not anymore. He went back out to the sitting room and looked at the wall again and all the pinned up photos, hoping for a ray of light.
“Hopefully…”
“I don’t want it!”
“Yup.” Sherlock shrugged gingerly out of his coat.
"What? Oh‒yeah! I forgot, her and I hadn't met before you left. Yeah," he was smiling stupidly, playing with the thin collar. "I went and got myself caught."
John nodded and bit the inside of his cheek.
Sherlock was familiar with the good pain. He experienced it every time he did coke. The sweet crazy high was bliss and the crash of it made his brain flash and throb. He didn’t think John was talking about
? He really, really hoped so. One day, anyway. The element of ‘public’ appealed to his exhibitionist side and pushed his buttons the way nothing done in the private safety of the bedroom did. John tightened his grip on the paper cup and sipped.
“Yes.” He said.
Greg blinked, then got pissed off.
"‒I don't talk about him that much!" John said.
"Sherlock." He said.
John picked up the jug and poured the fresh water over Sherlock's head, careful to keep the dirty water out of his eyes.
Sherlock strode out of the lab. He read his texts. Both were from John.
“Good lad.” John kissed his lips. “Elbows on the floor in front of you.”
“We’ll need new bathwater now.” John murmured, amused as Sherlock blushed. They stood up to shower and finish washing and John dried him thoroughly before taking him back to the bedroom. Unable to resist, he pushed him over the bed and peppered his arse with light spanks.
“That soil composition originates in Norwich….specifically in the region of The Broads.” He mused.
John went to the kitchen, where he had left Sherlock’s pills on the table. His sub padded after.
“No, here.” John gave him money and sent him on his way, then paced around on the pavement. Okay, okay. Breathe. Don’t be an idiot, just think. How could he find out where Sherlock went? He grabbed his phone and texted his sub.
idea.”
John snorted. Like that could possibly happen.
"J-John." He whispered.
Sherlock was coming back today! He looked at the time stamp on the texts. He’d sent them hours ago. And—Bondage!? Hell yes he was amenable. He gulped his snack and thumbed out a response:
“I do, but not now.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock did, wincing a bit as the bruises pulled. John pursed his lips and pushed the button again and left the room. Again the machine beeped. John came back in. "Okay." He pulled the exposure out of the panel. "That's your chest sorted. Anything on your legs?" He asked.
They used the lift and walked down the narrow, clean corridor to Greg's flat. He unlocked his door. They stepped inside and he flipped on the light, illuminating the slightly shabby yet comfortable space. A brown leather chair and squashy sofa faced each other and a small television was on a side table. Some laundry was piled on one side of the sofa and there were a couple mugs and glasses on the small table in front of it. Sherlock inhaled the musky, vaguely cinnamon-and-sweat scent of Greg's flat. His dom smell was a little spicier than John's but was still satisfying and familiar.
“Faster, John.”
“No.” Sherlock made a disgusted face, even as the thought of being with John Watson made his sub soul soar. “Are there any cases?” His voice was dull.
“I don’t need to be doted on.”
“Yes. Though the facility demanded he take a suppressant if he wanted to stay with you.”
John awoke the following morning and was instantly relieved to be on two days of leave. He was still sore and stiff and promised himself a cup of steeped oregano, thyme and honey. Who knows what kinds of infections he could get if he did nothing? He wasn't the only who had begged for leave. Moriarty's guests were a raucous lot and many of the concubines had been used the night before. John knew that despite it being a rest day, his other job, that of a healer, would be in demand. He welcomed it. Anything to chase away the demons was welcome.
“Good lad. Bedroom. I want you bare and on your tummy.” John put his empty plate aside.
They regarded the Mills board. Mills was like chess but easier. Each player had twelve pieces, either black or white. Once all the pieces were down, the point of the game was to create lines three pieces long, called "mills," while simultaneously attempting to eliminate the opponent's pieces from the board.
“What was that?” He looked down at the phone suspiciously. “Who has my number?”
John glanced at her neck. No collar. Sub? Dom? It was impossible to tell. He would tentatively guess ‘sub’ but it was just a hunch. Sherlock certainly would roll his eyes and tell him her life story, and John’s face softened at the thought.
Wo ist er hin? = Where did he go?
“He’s asleep. In hospital.” Greg said. Sherlock frowned and sat down. “He lost a lot of blood and the doctors are keeping him sedated.”
“Yes, though I don’t know why.”
“Clearly.”
“A bit.” He said in a smug voice. John rolled his eyes, a fond expression on his face. Lestrade sipped his coffee to hide his surprise. Maybe John really was different. Lord knows Sherlock needed a dom with a spine made of steel and a low capacity for bullshit.
That evening, John sat between Sherlock and Molly on the sofa. Mrs. Hudson had joined the fun and was sitting in Sherlock's armchair. Greg was in John's. It wasn't bad, really. John had ordered enough food for everyone and Greg and Molly had brought a load of snacks. He and Sherlock were sharing a blanket and Sherlock was sweetly curled against him. Sitting by the glow of the Christmas tree, with a fire crackling in the hearth, and surrounded by the company of friends, there wasn't much more a person could ask for.
"I know. I'm going to give you a long leash where you need it, but you need to listen to me and obey me when I step in.” John looked at him meaningfully. “Failing to do so will mean punishment."
“A very exclusive club.”
The side of Sherlock’s mouth went up in a grin and he stretched, rolling over and yawning mightily.
"You shouldn't have met with them." John said harshly. For a moment Sherlock had no idea who John was talking about but then he realized his dom had gone right back to the Barsanti Brothers. He couldn't get over how bad the nickname was. Even Diamond Duo would have been better. More accurate too…
He shrugged.
“Fucking hell, John…” Sherlock rubbed his face.
“No, no Logan, we don’t have to do this—is this what Anthony would have wanted?”
"Well sure, if Sherlock's talked about half as much as you've talked about him‒"
"Of course." Sherlock pulled John close to his side. "I love Christmas parties."
“If you don’t like it, why did you lick your finger?”
The wonderful scents of eggs and toast and coffee had Greg blinking awake the next morning. He was sprawled on his too-short sofa with a narrow afghan thrown over his body and he listened to the noises in the kitchen: pans clanking and food sizzling. He vaguely heard two male voices and he sat up. He rubbed his face and staggered to his feet, then stretched and wandered into the kitchen.
"Oh, that's me too." John said. Sherlock opened the container and took out two eggs. He held it open for John. Their fingers brushed and John could swear Sherlock's breath caught in his throat. John licked his lips, taking four eggs in suddenly clammy hands. His crush on Sherlock exploded a childish giddiness bounced around his guts.
, picking his way into Jamie’s house in a matter of minutes, very nearly breaking his own personal lock picking record. Smallish home, decorated in lots of florals. Who needs a warrant now?
“You too.” He mumbled. “You, you blew me too.”
The guest John tended was vile but uncreative. John was made to suck the man hard before he was bent over the bed frame and “shown his place.” The meds John took beforehand loosened him up and made him woozy. He knew he’d have a raging headache the following day (the herb was technically a poison) but it was worth it if he could beg off the next day and claim to be sick. He was one of only three concubines who was ‘off duty’ the following morning. Jim’s guest rooms were full and his friends had many colorful desires. He tended the others, giving each a light sleeping aid. He smeared ointment on his sore knees and took willowbark for his head. His thigh muscles burned and his hips were tight. Lying on his pallet all day would make him stiff as a board. He needed to move. The herana wasn’t very big but he did a few laps around the wide room, reveling in the rare quiet. The walls were bare stone and felt like sandpaper under his palm.
At the laptop, Sherlock scowled. Mrs. Hudson laughed and disappeared down the steps.
” John grabbed his lapels, hauling him upright again. Oh yes, he was in Defense. That hadn’t taken long at all. His eyes were dark and glittery and his cock was rock hard. He was snarling and growling and so angry he was actually spitting.
Sherlock glanced at the square white envelope, heavy paper, expensive, addressed in a neat, small, familiar hand. Mycroft chose it first so it can only mean…
"I have my nerves firmly in check." He said. "They're just squirmy."
“You don’t say that to people—especially distraught friends of the victim!”
When John still didn’t do anything, Sherlock rolled to his feet, took two steps, and swatted the paper out of his hands. That out of the way, he got into John’s lap and curled up, burying his face in his shoulder and hugging him.
“He wanted it!” Seb yelled. A livid bruise was rising around his eyebrow. “I was coming to see why he didn’t text me back!”
“Oh sorry.” John said. “Too much?”
“What happened?” Mycroft asked.
“Sherlock?”
as the gate attendant scanned his boarding pass and wished him a good flight.
"Yeah." John chirped. "See you Sunday, Molly."
"Here." She tossed a blanket over him. "Just lie still. Let me tend you?"
Sherlock mumbled something at the floor.
She startled. "Yes, Prince!" She darted off and had the sense to pull the door closed behind herself.
“You’re antagonizing her.”
“Easy. Take a breath.” Mike put his warm hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “We’ll get to the bottom of this, we always do. No need to fret.”
John watched him go. Something uneasy was lurking around his chest. “I should have gone with.”
“Has he gone to a clinic?” John asked. “They don’t have the kinds of stigmas that they used to.”
“Hush, just stay quiet.”
“They’re all supposed to be dead!”
He slid it back in his pocket and kept walking. The phone went quiet, then it rang again. John looked again. Same thing on the display. Frowning, he put it back in his pocket and it went silent. He crossed the street and was walking past a petrol station when a young, dark-haired man with a gold collar around his neck flagged him down from his parked car. John stopped walking, confused as the man jogged up to him with his phone to his ear.
“You sure?”
"No, Lestrade!" He snarled.
Mycroft set his cup down in the saucer with an angry clatter. "It sounds like you have a tight grip on your concubines." He said airily.
He’d scared the servants off and they’d hasted away, leaving him alone with his bags of clothes and things he’d brought. The one thing these bags didn’t contain was opium and Sherlock wondered how hard it would be to locate some in this wretched castle. If ever he needed a high, it was now. Surely there was some nefarious person downstairs who could get him some. He reasoned that away from home turf it would be way too easy for Mycroft to find out and he pushed the idea aside. He growled under his breath and pushed the velvet window coverings. The room looked out over the Iron Sea. He could see the dark water frothing and churning. It stretched out into the fading horizon falling under a starry night sky. He closed the drapes and a knock sounded on his door.
“Put that on your elbow.” John dropped the carrots on the table. Sherlock wrapped them in a paper towel and held it to his arm as behind him, the kettle bubbled and John found a mug in the drainer. It was weird to have someone else in his flat, in his space, doing something as mundane as making tea. He didn’t have much company, save Mike, clients, and unwanted visits from Mycroft.
John kissed him gently and Sherlock pulled him close. They fell on the sofa John-first and kissed like they were about to be led to the gallows. John bent one leg up between Sherlock’s thighs, pressing against the sub’s hardening cock. Sherlock growled in his throat and John squeezed his nape, very aware of their cocks pushed hot beside each other. He rubbed up and down Sherlock’s long smooth back and eventually they slowed and broke apart. Sherlock rested his head on John’s shoulder, breathing hard and gently grinding up against John’s stiff erection, trying to get himself harder.
"You haven’t." John said.
Sherlock took three deep breaths and John marked the chart. “Good. Pulse next.”
The merchant puffed up at this and strode over to the table, sitting across from Sherlock and pulling his girl into his lap. She freed a few coins from his pocket when he wasn't looking and gave Sherlock a wink.
“Yes.”
“He’ll be fine.” Mike said, grabbing more potatoes. “He’s gone to Bart’s a thousand times.”
Lestrade hooted in a sort of lewd delight and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
The gallows.
"Sherlock, are you going to try?" She called.
Sherlock eyes narrowed.
scripted onto the stonework in curly white letters.
“Go, if you want. Thanks for your help.”
“Take your gown off.” John commanded.
They sat in a silence for a few moments. Sherlock fiddled with the polished contraption, staring into the eyepiece and adjusting the height of the little platform. It appeared to be some sort of magnifier. Fascinating. John sipped the liquid and was grateful for Sherlock's patience and kindness. He set the empty cup aside.
“I can see that.” Sherlock muttered. He frowned at the toast before grabbing it and taking a bite. It was perfect, of course. Not burned at all and the butter was right up in the corners and everything. He sipped the coffee, sort of hoping it would be foul. Amazing. Hell.
"Sherlock!" John snickered as it banged into the bins below.
Sherlock stood up off the toilet and slipped the gown off, then looked at himself in the mirror. His back was dashed with little circular marks from the flogger and his nipples were bright red. There were pink marks near his mouth from the gag and his wrists smelled of leather. The cuffs were comfortable, if nothing else. He looked like he hadn’t slept in about forty years. A shower. That’s what he needed. He got in the tub and turned on the water, then pulled the curtain and let the warmth gush over him, rinsing away all the evening’s tension. The dried semen loosened on his thighs and the water was cool enough to not aggravate his sore back and chest. He stretched his arms and felt the tension pull in his muscles. He tentatively reached between his bum cheeks. His hole was tender. John hadn’t harmed him though. He didn’t think John could ever really harm him. He would be fine.
“Sofa?” Sherlock suggested, his voice slightly breathy.
Mike jotted some notes, more perplexed than concerned. The Prince had been visiting him regularly since he was a lad and Mike a fresh-faced young healer. Holmes the younger had been a child of extremes, often keeping quiet for ages and observing the world before unleashing a torrent of questions. He could vault from placid and content to anxious and nervous, often within a span of hours. One day he’d be the tidy, polite gentleman prince and the next he’d be a wild tatterdemalion releasing rats and frogs upon the ladies of the court. Mycroft, in contrast, was even-keeled and dependable, logical and quiet even as a child. Sherlock was a smoldering stick of dynamite. The boys’ parents had despaired and sent the then six-year-old to Mike demanding he discover why Sherlock was the way he was.
She wasn't sure what he meant. She wanted to stay with him but she had an assignment, with Greg as it happened.
A month later, Sherlock was just about completely healed. His angry crimson cuts faded to pink lines and then the smallest of them disappeared. Sherlock was so fair skinned that the faint scars would take a long time to dissolve but until then, he was back to his charming self. John came home from his shift at the clinic to find his fiance pacing in and out of the sitting room, his red dressing gown flapping around him like disgruntled wings. The stench of vinegar and old shoe leather made John wrinkle his nose.
Sherlock cranked on the tears. “I would, I really would, I just miss Owen so much!” He sobbed. It sounded a little forced, but he was desperate now. He didn’t think Vincent would really try anything, but Sherlock was more concerned about getting his cover blown.
, of course.”
The doctor froze for a moment. "Yes, please." He blurted. "Trade?"
"Harry, shush!"
John bit into his ham on rye as Sherlock detailed an experiment he had growing in the toilet tank in 221B, grinning as he waved his arms, miming having to plunge the toilet. The man was probably certifiably insane, but John found he loved it. Sherlock said and did some of the most bizarre things—he kept
How did that feel? That was good. That was nice. It was…pleasant. Tender, even. Sherlock frowned, realizing he had no place to store this new information. He needed to clean a room out a room for John…but until then—Sherlock leaned over and kissed him soundly on the mouth. He could feel the doctor’s surprise at first. His body tensed and his hands stilled, but after a moment he was back in gear. He cupped Sherlock’s neck and returned the kiss, quietly taking control, urged on when Sherlock leaned back against the cushion and pulled him along. John straddled his thighs, cradling Sherlock’s neck and jaw lovingly as he tasted and explored this rude, brilliant man.
“Not coming. Let’s go.”
"You look done in." Molly said. "Come on, sleep next to my pallet. We can be neighbors and talk healer stuff."
Mrs. Hudson’s raised voice in the kitchen caught his ear. “That bloodstain better come off, young man, other people will want to use this fridge someday too!”
“Was it just the four of you that went?”
John laughed.
“I’m storing the fingers in there.”
"John Watson." The man said, smiling, oily and slimy. "I heard Jim had cast you down into his whores and I thought to myself, my, I must pay him a visit."
He was pretty pink all over by now, splotchy in areas but covered well from neck to knee in enticing little red crop blotches. John nodded in approval and wiped the sweat from his brow. It had been a while, but he was impressed with his own skill after so long. He always did have good aim. He reached up and put his hand on Sherlock’s forehead, pulling his face out of his arms so he was staring right into the mirror. His ice eyes were dark, the teal rimming the black pupil in a fine line. His lips were crimson with arousal and tears were running down his face.
“Probably.” John said, laughing.
“Alright?” Sherlock looked up at him, glad to see him smiling. “You won’t hurt me, John. And though I have no doubt you can subdue a large man in seconds, if you attempt to do anything to me that I explicitly don’t want, you’ll regret it.”
“Yeah, I have.” John grinned. She went into her flat and they kissed a bit more. “Let’s bring these up.”
“Mm.”
John looked at the sumptuous bed with longing. He had slept there last night. He and Sherlock had talked until John nodded off. He’d slept like the dead.
It was hard, flat pain that simmered through his bottom and made him feel like a naughty sub who'd disobeyed his dominant. He wished more than anything that John wouldn't be upset with him but he also knew that that wouldn’t begin to happen until the spanking was over. He squeezed the bed sheet, whining softly in his throat as the pain deepened into something harsher and longer lasting. John was smacking him pretty hard and he would feel this tomorrow for sure.
“They feel okay…”
Sherlock looked down at the mug and nodded. They went back to the bed. John set his tea down and stripped out of his clothes. He put Sherlock’s tea beside his own and they slipped into the sheets. Sherlock whined as the cotton rubbed his bum.
"It doesn't hurt." Sherlock mumbled.
"You're very handsome, John." Sherlock said. He eyed John's bare chest in the flickering firelight. “I find myself becoming very…interested in you.”
, John. In the singular.”
, understand?”
“—Where are you going?” Sherlock asked, lifting his head.
Sherlock’s phone chimed in the bedroom and he reluctantly pulled away fand went to the bedroom to grab it. His dom followed, instinctively guarding his sub’s back. The text was from Lestrade.
Sherlock buzzed their door number.
“Did you have to mention that in front of her?” Sherlock groused as the went into B.
He made a face at that but hunched himself into John and hugged him.
Molly had devised a valerian-based ointment that relaxed muscles and had a pleasing numbing effect. Her breadth of knowledge in healing was stunning and since that first day when she’d shown him kindness, her and John had remained friends and close allies.
“Of course.” He waved him off. “I’ll come back if it’s not too late.”
"Agreed." John said.
"Of course. Sherlock."
“I won’t get sick.”
"We don't house nearly as many concubines as Jim does.” He sniffed. “A number of on-site concubines are normal but an overabundance is just gauche.”
“Thank you.” John said, exasperated.
“Mudd Coffee House.” He said, flipping it over. “Some kind of punch card.”
“Of course.”
John hissed and humped a little harder into his mouth. “So good…oh fuck yeah, just like that…” He spread his knees further and his balls tightened up. “I’m just about there, love. If you don’t want me to come in your mouth—”
on this investigation, and Lestrade went back to the kitchen. Sherlock paced out the front door and hailed a cab. He’d get there early. He needed to interview those mechanics
“I perused this, didn’t see anything
“What’s your poison?” Mike asked.
"Betsy," John said, swallowing a piece of lamb and mint sauce, "this is amazing."
him!”
"Christmas Vacation." John said, finishing his eggnog. "You know, Clark tries to have the perfect Christmas and fails at every turn." He watched the movie every season. He and Harry could quote entire chunks of it back and forth to each other.
“When you disobey me, Sherlock, this is what will happen. You will get punished.” Smack, smack. “Spankings get right to the point. A submissive with a smarting red bottom is a well-behaved submissive.”
“Love?” Seb blurted.
John hung up and Molly winced. “Oh Sherlock,” she murmured to the blinking display. “What have you done?”
"Dungeons." Moran commanded. "I'm sure his Majesty will be down to see the prisoners soon enough." He grinned at John and swept off into the depths of the castle.
“Good. I would too.”
"I'll take all the help I can get." He smiled gratefully up at her. He was glad of her help and he was more glad of her company.
“Two milligrams should be plenty to keep someone sedated.” Molly said.
“Some people are really skittish with bondage, and we’ve never done it before.”
“John,” Mycroft called from the sitting room, “how is it spending so much time with Sherlock? Hellish, I imagine…”
“I think it’s going to last a while. Ignore it.”
"Thank you much, sir!" She did a little curtsy, eyes on the shining coin, and bit the silver to check if it was real. Sherlock mounted up and clucked the horse into a canter and cruised up the winding dirt path. There were few people out. A couple of the small homes had candles in the windows and Sherlock noted a few of the palace guards doing rounds. The Barrens used to be the worst sort of slum, rife with violence and homeless, hungry citizens. Sherlock's grandfather had done a load of work to make the Barrens safer and least relatively habitable before he died. Sherlock’s mother had taken up the project, creating more housing, jobs, and schools. She'd done much to improve the place before she died, but there were still pockets of homelessness, poverty and filth. Crime wasn't nearly the problem it had been in generations past. Boring.
The doctor smiled. “Up now. My back is starting to act up.”
John pulled back, looking up at him. “Domming me?”
“—if my dom is annoying, I’ll tell you.”
"Of course." John shut the fridge. "It's her fault. Or it's my fault. It's never yours. You can never just admit you're wrong and fix it and move on."
"Hello, John. Don't mind me, I'm just bringing some bikkies up for you loves to have with your tea."
He got off the Tube and headed for Scotland Yard on foot twenty minutes later. Sherlock strode past the desks and glass partitions, heading confidently for Lestrade’s office. He was such a fixture at the Yard and so abrasive towards most of the employees there that no one gave him a second glance or acknowledged him in any way. Lestrade intercepted them on his way back from the printer with a stack of warm white inked pages in his hands.
“Mike?” He said at the screen. He tapped the ‘answer’ button and put the machine to his ear. “Hi Mike. Everything alright?”
He threw the phone down in disgust and stormed to the bedroom. Mycroft was right—subs were the weaker dynamic. He was so needy and clingy—if John wanted to leave him, he would just have to deal with it. He looked at the bed and the rumpled sheets and remembered John’s recent nightmares.
The other doctor gave him a grateful smile. “That’d be great, John.”
“Look at me.” Lestrade said.
“A hospital, of a sort. They specialize in discretion and the highest quality care.”
“Makes sense if they live in different directions.” John added.
“Just stand here for a minute while I get the water going.”
"My brother is coming back from the border.” Sherlock sighed. “I shan’t be free."
The next few days passed in a mundane way. Wake up, coffee, shower, Internet or newspaper. He might run some errands or meet with Ella, but really that was about it and as he did all this, somehow John always found his thoughts wandering back to Sherlock.
“No.” She said. “That model doesn’t come with a ring.”
She lead him to the bathing room and poured him a fresh bucket of water. He shucked off his loincloth soiled by blood, shit, come, and other fluids and tossed it aside. He dunked a rag into the bucket and  hissed as the cool water  burned his fresh scrapes and wounds. He wiped gently to get the semen and blood off his back and thighs. He reached behind himself to feel between his cheeks. His eyes watered at the touch and he grit his teeth as he rinsed cold water over his raw skin. Molly fetched him a new loincloth and he put it on, grateful to be covered. Slowly, hanging on to Molly's arm, he went to his pallet. He crawled onto it and laid still, trying not to shiver too badly. He felt a little better now that he was clean.
"He's a good guy." Mike assured him as they walked. "He really is, but just…don't get offended, yeah?"
“I can bring you the leashes we carry in this brand.” She said.
He put his fingers together, nearly ready to snap, but paused. It was still okay. A little part of him was morbidly curious to see how this would all turn out. “I think these,”
“We need to tidy this place up for tomorrow.” John hugged him and they both glanced at the messy sitting room.
“I didn’t get the name of the hospital.” He stood behind Sherlock and rested a hand on his shoulder. “He hurt you so I hurt him.”
Sherlock did. John glanced around. There weren’t convenient throw pillows like at 221 so he grabbed his own pillow off the bed and dropped it in front of his sub. “Use this.” He helped him wedge it under his knees. “Now,” he straightened and spoke to the back of Sherlock’s head, “you think about your sore red bum as you stare at that corner. I’ll come get you when I’m ready.”
He managed to drag Sherlock out for a walk in the sunshine. He bought them both coffees in the park and they sat on a bench, watching the passersby. John would pick out the most plain people he could find, daring Sherlock to get their life stories right. Of course, he always did. Not that John could tell when he was wrong, but it was fun anyway.
“Sometimes they are!” He yelled. “Everyone is an idiot.” He tugged at his hair in frustration.
Sherlock helps his dom and the boys spend an evening together. More evidence reveals itself in the case and John is less than thrilled with it.
“Yes.”
“You were kidnapped by smugglers and nearly killed.” Sherlock snapped. “I’m disinclined to believe you’re ‘alright.’” He threw his coat off and huffed as John went to the loo to take paracetamol and clean the blood off his head.
Sherlock ignored the text like he had all the others and sent a note to John—
Goodness.
“Whatever you say.” Mycroft sounded impossibly smug. “Don’t let me interrupt you.”
to the home of a suspected murderer!” He was shouting now and Sherlock cringed, very aware that his poor sore bottom was still very vulnerable and his angry dom’s paddle wasn’t very far away. He hated this!
"You don't even know me. Or them."
"And to make a point." Sherlock said. "Your existence is a message to anyone who would oppose him."
A nod.
Sherlock blinked at him in the mirror.
"I don't know." John yanked sleep trousers on and tugged socks over his feet. Sherlock watched, pained. "I just need air." He grabbed a shirt and stormed down the hallway. There was some rustling and then the door opened and slammed, followed by feet on the stairs and then the door downstairs opening and slamming. Sherlock scrubbed fingers through his hair. He wanted to go after him, but John clearly wanted solitude. Fine. If that’s what he needed, then Sherlock would give him distance. He looked at the empty spot on the bed and rested his hand where John had just been. Still warm.

John didn't need to be told twice. Sherlock's desire to continue to keep his company was heartening and he enjoyed spending time with the "Mad Prince." He wasn't so mad. He was a bit demanding and certainly odd but he
In response, Sherlock groaned and spilled over the desk, splattering over the sheet of paper containing the lines. John rubbed his arse as he humped and Sherlock panted and shivered with delight.
“Please? Same color if you don’t mind.”
“Coming…” He glanced at the text again and pushed the phone down deep in his coat. He would ignore it. Seb would leave him alone if he just ignored it.
Logan stepped over Sherlock’s body and picked a thin Tshirt up off the table. He came back over and knelt beside him, rolling the shirt into a rope and forcing it between his lips. He tied it around his head. Then he picked up the knife then and slashed it cruelly over Sherlock’s forearm. He shouted out around the gag and jerked on the floor as fresh blood poured out to the tarp.
Sherlock stepped his feet apart. His cock hung heavy and sensitive between his thighs and he felt exposed and horny.
“Yes, I can. My mother taught me.
Sherlock has listened to Santa’s long speech, trying not to let his eyes drop. He is terribly thirsty and getting tired, although his shivers are growing violent.
“You… what?

Sherlock contemplated him: “And you are interested in both. Men and women, I mean.
He sprints on quiet feet to Sherlock’s small room, isolated from the other bedrooms. Two guards are positioned in front of it, like every day, so John uses the secret tunnel to get into the room. It’s his usual method.
Sherlock whispers into John’s ear, who is now leaning directly over him, shielding Sherlock from the rest of the room. Suddenly, Sherlock is able to speak in monosyllables.
“I’m in desperate need of my husband.
A stressed nurse came in, dragging a young boy of maybe 7 years behind her. The boy was short and had blond hair and kind blue eyes.

When the doctor came out of the operation room to announce that the patient’s heart was no longer beating, his heart stopped for a few agonizing seconds too. Greg couldn’t even remember John’s reaction, he only heard a soft, whispered no‘. Then someone shouted for the doctor from the hall, and she ran back, looking shocked.
Sherlock would do everything for him (except maybe buying the milk, because honestly, how boring), for John’s safety and his happiness. That why he didn’t think much about jumping from the roof of St.

Sherlock insists on an answer. John blushes
“I have watched and read and everything about you and Dr. John Watson in the news. There are a lot of amazing stories about you over the last few years. First you suddenly get famous, then you fall from disgrace and then committing suicide, John Watson moving out, you come back two years ago, seemingly changed, John Watson marrying, Sherlock Homes having sex with a random woman, Sherlock Holmes getting fake engaged, Sherlock Holmes getting shot and nearly dying, and then Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, the great heroes, saving London from a terrorist attack with only two casualties, one of them your brother, the other one John Watson’s wife! Of course, I got interested in you!
Sherlock says.
Sherlock repeats, pouting.
“How were you going to do that?
John asks while scrubbing, “From which, the Daily Mail and The Sun? Almost everything that’s written about us is made of lies and complete rubbish.
You are too. I mean, you are also my best friend.

"Mary shot you."
John promises, and Greg finally leaves. John helps Sherlock into the bathroom, takes the blankets and carefully puts him into his small shower. They barely fit in there together. Sherlock moves very stiffly and slowly. He must be exhausted from his swim in the Themes, and of course from whatever happened to his fishtail.
Well, hopefully Sherlock would answer some of his questions. He was probably already terrorizing the poor hospital stuff, demanding to go home or at least to get better food. Lestrade had spent two days in a clinic once and after he got home he immediately stuffed everything left in his fridge into his mouth. Sherlock was released today, so maybe he would do the same, although it’s weird to see the detective eating.
He is begging in his frustration. Sherlock’s heart bleeds at the sight of it.
, one day even for a trip to a London Christmas market. Sherlock cancels every time, and he can sense John’s growing frustration and confusion.
Still, Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
He packs a few glasses of marmalade as a payment and manages to survive the trip with the tube without any big accidents. 221 Baker Street is right next to a small cafe, and Paddington contemplates staying there for a while, but decides against it. He has more important stuff to do.
"Is not our convenient babysitter, John! She will be 80 next month. It wouldn't be fair."
Mary was nodding him, while John only spared him a short glance, his expression troubled. Sherlock was staring at his feet, his face more pale than ever. Lestrade could see a few beads of sweat on his forehead.
Sherlock giggles at this mental image. This whole scene feels like one of these romantic teenager comedies Molly is always forcing him to watch.
They arrived at John’s
“No, I’m just very busy.
There is no escape, and John feels very sorry for all the employees who have to survive it for eight hours every day. This week they started playing some Christmas songs in the waiting room of the clinic as well. John doesn’t mind the songs, but this is just too much.
There is nothing more warm and cozy than Paddington Bear.
Maybe something happened and John had to get out of the plane last minute? Maybe Sherlock read the message wrong and John is taking a later flight?
John says, his tongue licking his lips while staring at the fighting buttons on his chest. Sherlock manages to stammer

with their eight legs and black eyes. A herd of white unicorns, hunted by wizards for their powerful blood. The centaurs with their long beards, arrows and their scary predictions for the future. Some say a vampire lives in the darkest area of the forest as well, waiting for their next victim. Another popular theory are the werewolves, who are rumoured to be the source of the howling in some nights. Sherlock is not so sure of that. If there were any other werewolves, he would have known.

John understood him without a word. Perfect.
Suddenly, there is a loud scream carried over by the wind. Sherlock can just catch the two broomsticks colliding. One of the boys manages to hang onto their broom, the other one slips and falls.
Sir Walter pushes him off the metal chair and wraps an arm around Sherlock’s shoulder, like the mock embrace of a lover. Sherlock tries to protest, to get Walter’s touch away from, but of course no sound emerges from his closed-off mouth.
"Why do you think that?"
After an extra sweet kiss on his mouth, John suddenly entangles himself and rushes off to the left way.

Sherlock mumbles, then opens one eye to check on John. “How is your shoulder.
John busies himself with sorting through his discarded food trail, before sitting on the bed. Sherlock’s body heat has a soothing effect on him. John wishes he can comfort Sherlock, but he doesn’t know if the other man would accept touches right now. Not after what happened.
John was trapped, and the constant fighting between him and Mary made him want to hide under the cover until hopefully an adult would come and save him from whatever hell this is.
His captor snapped handcuffs on his wrists carefully rolled him of the table. To Sherlocks horror he couldn’t stand without help and had to be guided to the noose. The man let go of him for a second to place the wooden chair under the hook. He then grabbed Sherlock by his hands and put him on the chair. He moved around and laid the noose around his neck. Sherlock could sense the panic creeping in. He always knew that he would die young and probably in a very brutal way. Maybe an assassin, like Mary, maybe some dumb criminal who had a lucky day, maybe the government would execute him but he never thought it would go like this. Calm, clean and without any resistance on his part (because there was a thing stuck into him and it had sucked all of his energy out of his sagging body and he was still shaking and still sweating-) The man tightened the noose around his neck.
WARNINGS: Blood and murder,
John smile turned into a wide grin. They both smiled at each other like idiots, and for once, Sherlock didn’t care.
John asks.
They haven’t progressed much further from that. Sherlock had been lying in Johns lap on Bond night (dreadful movies, but they made John laugh), John had taken his hand during breakfast (after that Sherlock spent hours categorizing Johns lovely and strong hand. There was so much to find out!), John had nuzzled his face into his curls, Sherlock had dragged John on top of him and they had a snogging session (Johns body was heavy and warm and never failed to make Sherlock feel protected and treasured), John had. Sherlock had.
into his thighs. Sherlock let out a short scream, and she hit him again. Satisfied with herself, she dresses him again and ups the doses of the hallucinogen. It is time to end this.
He puts his right arm around Sherlock’s neck, careful not to jostle his injured arm, the left hand is used to carry Sherlock’s legs. John carefully cradles him close and pulls him up. While they make their way out of the basement, Sherlock starts sobbing uncontrollably. John’s warmth surround him, and he never thought he would have this again.
It is my first attempt at porn, so please excuse any lingering awkwardness. I tried my best.
“At the start of each training, I want to do some warming-up with the kids before they climb on their brooms. Meaning, some running around, maybe a few push-ups, and I want to practice throwing and catching the balls of course.
It is the mysterious Professor Watson, who then actually winks at him. Sherlock cannot remember when someone last did that towards him, so he carefully winks back. Watson chuckles, a lovely and low sound that makes Sherlock ache to hear his voice. It lights up Watson’s whole face.
Sherlock had come to the conclusion that kissing John was the best thing ever. A simple touch of their lips fired up a thousand fireworks. It was salvation and damnation all at once. He would be happy if only he got to kiss John Watson for the rest of his life.
The hospital room has a small Christmas Tree is well, and the room is bathed in comfortable light. John walks up to the bed. There is no window, but it’s bright enough. Sherlock is lying on the bed with his back towards the door. The blanket is drawn up to his chin, and only his head is sticking out.
"I cannot wait for John to see this. I hope it will finally open his eyes, and he sees how disgusting you are.“ Mary spit out.

Paddington recites his story: “I have lived with family Brown for two years now. There is Mr Brown, who is a businessman, Mrs. Brown who paints, and their two children. Judy wants to be a journalist and write about feminism. She has a girlfriend. Jonathan is trying to improve his maths grades. Mrs. Bird is our cook, and she sent me to you. They are all wonderful people, and we live in a fabulous neighbourhood, apart from Mr. Curry. Since Monday, my orange marmalade has been stolen every single morning. It’s my breakfast, and I prepare the marmalade the evening before.
John is starting to gather his clothes, but Sherlock grabs his arms, surprised at his own braveness, and gestures at the space on the bed next to him.

are talking in the kitchen about something Brexit-related. They are listening to a live broadcast from Trafalgar Square, that plays the most horrid music of the year.
Sherlock answers, not wanting John to ever think less of himself. John blushes a bit, and Sherlock makes a mental note to do this more often from now on.
“You were always a good father to me.
“Perfect. Now we just have to do the face!
His doctor had strongly advised him not to leave the house, because Sherlock’s lungs sometimes suck at being lungs. The word “immunocompromised” has been thrown between Mycroft and his parents whenever he begged them for just a walk in the park, goddamn it. He perfectly understands theirs and John’s reasoning
The scent calms him, and he lets himself guided through the endless corridors of the castle until the noises from the celebration fade in the background. John opens a door and leads him in. There is a huge bed in the corner, two big windows, a burning fireplace, several impressive looking bookshelves where Sherlock spies several of his favourites, and to Sherlock’s surprise, his violin on a table. John must have insured that the priceless instrument is brought to his room.
John inquires.
“It is Mario Kart. And you are dreadful at it.”
sat busy in his counting-house. There was a terrible weather outside, and people hurried along, trying to find solace from the biting wind, rubbing their hands and stomping their feet. Big Ben had announced it was 3 o’clock, but it was far too dark for that, in fact, it hadn’t gone light the whole day. London was in the stranglehold of a brutal winter. The neighbours had lighted candles, and the fog was creeping under the windows and the heavy door. You could barely catch a glimpse of the opposite house.

Mrs. Hudson announces. “We need groups of two, and someone who reads the questions out loud and who checks if everyone is playing fairly. Absolutely no cheating allowed, so please put your phones into this box.
Which is why he is a bit confused when John is suddenly free from his rope and in front of
Well, John did find the pipes. And he found out what caused the noise that kept him up at night. Most importantly however, he found something that would change his entire life, again.
“Quiet, both of you.
Sherlock repeats his own little pep talk a few times while he runs through the corridors, now without a strategy, since the last one did not help much.

A nurse approached and nodded to the only occupied hospital room. John stands up and prepares himself mentally. Sherlock will need him now as his boyfriend, not as his doctor or even worse, a soldier.
“I can.
“Did you play
He should have acted on the constant taunting the first time they happened. It would have been embarrassing to tell a teacher, but at least it would have ended, instead of dragging on before imploding into chaos. The words Mary had written were burned into his retinas, and Sherlock doubted he would ever manage to delete them.
Sherlock asks.
The Forbidden Forest lies in front of them. No light from the sky shines through it, and it is eerily quiet.
“Amazing.

"It would be only temporary, anyway. I do think I will be ready to date again, not right away, but in a while. Rosie needs a mother, after all. You will have us out of your hair soon enough."
and Sherlock couldn’t wait until the day when all of this -London, John Watson- would be something he could enjoy every day.
“Let’s get you some water, alright?
Mrs. Hudson whispers to Sherlock as she whisks past to shake John’s hand.
That’s the end of the lesson. Leave your brooms here and go back inside.
“Just please, John. Don’t go with her. She was working with Moriarty, she has too many enemies who are hunting her. If you go with her you will die! I won’t ever contact you again, I will disappear from your life, but please, stay in London!

first wives throw open their coat to press their husbands enthusiastically, while the girlfriend is engaging in a long shared kiss with her girlfriend. Two minutes later, and all the waiting people have found their person. Everyone is hugging and laughing, while Sherlock is still standing there alone, feeling stupid with his lilac poster and the cactus.
They sit a few minutes in silence. Sherlock uses the time to take all the different sounds of the approaching city in. The various languages, from tourists and citizens alike, the loud music from a pair of headphones, the “All I want for Christmas is you
“Does this mean Sherlock will be allowed to stay?
He tries, but a man just shoves him to the side and mumbles something about Sherlock being a bloody dickhead.
Sherlock has a headache.
“Why would he do that?
“I do not care. It is not like they are sympathetic to your headache.
He asked quietly.
Sherlock begged him with his eyes, but John would not back down until he received a real answer. The detective opened is mouth, then closed it again. Open, close. John waited patiently.
Lestrade thoughts wandered back to the last month. No one had bothered to fill all the gaps for him yet, but he wasn’t a Scotland Yard detective for nothing. Contrary to what Sherlock believes, he is able to make some dedications on his own. In this case however, he hopes the two men will leave him in the dark. Whatever happened, Sherlock first disappeared and then had to spent the last days in the hospital and John had barely left his side, with yesterday the only exception. Greg suspected that John had business with his ex-wife to tend to. Speaking of Mary, he hadn’t seen her in a while. Not that he cared much about her, but with Sherlock Holmes, you never knew where people might end up. She could be in a high-security prison for all he knows, guarded personally by Sherlock’s strange older brother. Mycroft also had disappeared from the face of the earth. John hadn't mentioned either of them yet, and Greg feared the worst. No one in their close friend circle (Lestrade, Molly, Mrs Hudson) had particularly liked Mary, but the presence of the older Holmes, while often overbearing, also radiated a sense of safety.

Both sons shout back. John takes this as his cue and pulls Sherlock closer to him and shuts him up with a kiss. Sherlock immediately melts into him.
That’s what scared him. He forced himself to move his hands out of Johns comforting grip and tried to wriggle out of his trousers.
John snorts: “I’m glad Hogwarts remains exciting, I don’t want to experience you bored.

Mary smiled.
I’m already better than you will ever be,
Sherlock stutters. To be honest, he entirely forgot about that thing. The rest of their conversation had been much more exciting.
John was training together with a new gladiator in sword-fighting. Gregor had bought him just two days ago, a man around his age from
“Don’t thank me, thank the students. I will expect you both tonight at the Christmas party for the teachers.
“That’s why you married me.
He says hastily, tugging his arm free.
John stares at Colin Firth’s broad chest. Why is Sherlock so enthusiastic about him? The man is now over fifty, for goddess sake! Sure, he has great hair and a deep voice, but a lot of people had that.
“What happened?

The nurse cried and went to bother someone else.

As a sixteen-year old boy in love, he had every reason to be dramatic.

jumped up from the bed: “I don’t have friends! And I don’t need you or anyone else to berate me over my choices.
Together they chug John’s shirt away, then Sherlock’s.
“Turnips first, the rest later.” Sherlock says and starts sprinting, following John’s instructions (“Oi, don’t step on my flowers!”). John’s character, dressed in a doctor’s mask and wearing army trousers, is running behind. Just as they always do in the outside world.
Sherlock blurts out and wants to press his hands in front of his mouth to stop another sound from getting blurbed out.
“I thought I would bring a few more players, and surprisingly, these two did not have anything else to do, one day before Christmas Eve.
Surely, the detective is going to break any day now. He spends most of his days laying face-down on the couch. John can hear his stomach grumbling from the bathroom.
John says, and Sherlock chokes on his hot chocolate. He starts coughing, and John leans forward and pats him on the back.
"Will you please now save my knees and answer?“
You have to take an extra tour through the rain, on Halloween no less, and yet you call it a treat?
Now, he has a problem. The handsome medical student with the short hair is slowly moving along the line, and it looks like that Molly will make him his drink, and that is unacceptable.
He hears John shouting his name in his head when he jumped from the roof to fake his own suicide.
“Drink your scotch too, Doctor Watson.
Only later, when they are laying in bed and John is asleep, does Sherlock wonder why the Clown knew his name.
if Oliver’s potion essays were something to be proud of.
Please, John, hurry up! He pleads in his silenced head as he is thrown in front of the throne.
The stag night was definitely something else. He thought he could go through with it, in his drunken state. Confess his love for the detective while groping his knee. Then their client busted in, and the moment was gone. Probably better that way.
Molly congratulates him, and Sherlock is glad that she means it wholeheartedly. “Greg won a lot of money with the Scotland Yard bet. It had been going on for years.
John suddenly asks hastily out of the blue, not looking up from his plate.
You’re Sherlock Holmes, you can do everything!
“What?

John says and starts unwrapping the man. His skin is cold, but he looks otherwise unharmed. How did the man land into the Themes, naked? Did he get got into the net on his journey?
Still, the offensive question angered him.

“Yeah, why?
I was "inspired" by the Q&A mockery from Moffat and Gatiss. They call the works of Arthur Conan Doyle their bible but have no problem writing a John Watson who cheats on his wife, who returns and forgives said wife after she nearly kills Sherlock, a John Watson beats Sherlock Holmes bloody, a weird redemption arc for an assassin, a baby that somehow disappears very often, a Mary Morstan who tells the boys it's not important who they are, and a stupid parody of the fandom-loved Garridebs scene. And I didn't even mention the Shutter Island and the secret sister who can do mind control like an X-Men and is apparently worthy of forgiving.
John’s eyes turn dark with possessiveness. His left-hand strokes the angry bite mark from the anonymous werewolf who bit Sherlock years ago.
“Cheer up, Marley, it’s Christmas Day. We are only celebrating!
The man wonders aloud while his eyes wander over Sherlock’s body. Sherlock ignores the temptation to pull his shirt tighter around himself.
John first realized his dog tags were missing when he unpacked his boxes in his new, mouldy small flat in a dingy corner in London. He always kept the tags in a former shoe box with some other military memorial stuff, including pictures. He didn’t notice it when he packed them in 221b. John had been so feverish to get away and finally move out that he just threw all of his things into boxes without any care.
The old lady introduced herself properly, and Sherlock quickly found himself inside the store, with a cup of tea in one hand and a vanilla muffin in the other. Mrs. Hudson prattled on about her dead husband, Florida, and how much she needed a second part-time employee as she is only getting older, but could not afford one.
“You mean the past of my father, Ernest Marley?
The man finally introduces himself, and Sherlock shakes the offered hand. John’s hands are rough from the hard work, and they fit perfectly into Sherlock’s.
John tips Sherlock on his shoulder, and Sherlock nearly blows himself into space, so startled is he.
“Do you need any help with him?
Grey eyes met blue eyes.
“Wow…
“Wow, that is some serious fucked-up stuff. I’m sorry.

had brushed his hands against Sherlock’s left cheek, and John wished to rip his entire arm out.
Sherlock says and nuzzles his head deeper into John’s shoulder. John follows his plea and starts caressing his hair.
The handsome (and now also caring!) man explains. He takes Sherlock’s red hand into his and opens the tab.
Sherlock knows John hates to share him, especially since John hasn’t done his special trick yet.
He closes the curtains with his wand and throws the blanket over him. Tomorrow, dozens of students will expect him to be healthy, interesting and engaging, and Sherlock needs to sleep for that, no matter what he would prefer.
The blanket moved a bit, but Sherlock didn’t appear. Mycroft watched as John carried one, seemingly not bothered. He was amazed at the patience the blond boy exercised. The blond boy blabbered on, filling the cold air with words. Mycroft watched them get up, eat a few pieces of bread and a glass of milk, and finally how they were sent to bed. Two or three children had to sleep on one mattress with only one blanket, and John choose the place next to Sherlock.
“Thank god, we are home, right Gladstone?
That’s all over now, he reminded himself. Time to look into the future, a future with this great, good-looking nurse. Time to be a good husband for Mary.
John says, and opens their tent. A group of fourteen kids have gathered on the green grass on the

had left to build a great career in the Senate for himself. It was a pure coincidence that Sherlock was brought to Rome as well. On the long way to the capital, he unfortunately had built himself quite a bad reputation among the slavers. He was fast considered a problem and therefore much more guarded than the others. At a stop he was the first they put the iron collar on. Sherlock had struggled so hard that the burn marks on his neck would stay forever. Even if his master would show mercy and free him, these scars would show everyone who he truly was.
A bookstore is a magical place. You wander in either with a specific purpose or for just for book browsing. The shelves, if white, brown or black, if old, expensive or new, are filled with hundreds of new worlds. Whether it is s snowing, raining or (less often in London) the sun is shining, a good bookshop will make you forget what is happening outside. So, when you are leaving a few minutes or even a few hours later, you will be blinking confused to the darkened sky. Hopefully, you will be clutching a bag in your hands, because leaving a

Fortunately, a few participants arrive. Molly welcomes her two friends from university, Tom and Stella Hopkins with open arms. Next up is Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Hudson’s neighbour, bringing her two married tenants, Finn and Isaac. Mrs. Turner is greeted with applause, as she is bringing her famous apple pie, and into the chaos three young men step in.

She asks him.

“Nonsense.
love changes life from water to wine.
John wondered if Sherlock had missed him too.
John broke protocol, took a step in his direction and took his hand. They fit perfectly together and John couldn’t stop the laughter falling out of his mouth. He brushed a curl from his soon to be husband’s forehead.
“Even better, that leaves more for me.
Willow. The Forbidden Forest lies in the dark and is completely still, no gigantic spiders are to be seen. Thousands of stars, far away from pollution, are shining in the sky.
John and Sherlock enjoy an evening in the pub.

Santa seems happy with his thought process: “I’m glad you figured it out yourself, Mr. Holmes. I am giving John Watson the perfect gift for Christmas: Sherlock Holmes’s body. He will be finally free of your dangerous presence in his life! Your corpse, wrapped up in cheery red paper with little reindeers.
Sherlock sits up so fast another dizzy spell nearly overcomes him.
John wishes he could shield Sherlock from all these prying hands, but for now, the door to the ambulance has to remain open.
John helps him up and throws his coat around Sherlock’s ruined body. Sherlock does not dare look at him through the Scotch Bridle. What must John think of him, completely falling apart without his husband by his side.
As far as John remembered, Lestrade had only moved into this flat a few months after Sherlock’s fall. The whole investigation only just saved Lestrade from being fired, and the divorce did the rest. His flat looked more spacious than John’s small flat, but not terribly nice either. Not even with a high-ranking job at Scotland Yard could someone afford a nice home in London.
“Why, I’m excellent at

found them, and after his near death on the battlefield he considered himself living on burrowed time.
John nods.
John asks.
Sherlock nods frantically. This is going surprisingly well.
Paddington tells him. John gapes at him in astonishment.
Alone.
Oh, a joke! He could make a joke, people loved them.
Now the tags were missing. John even forced himself to call Mrs. Hudson and ask her to look if it somehow slipped under the bed or behind the desk, but she didn’t find them either.
Now it is Sherlock’s turn to blink surprised. Thank Merlin Mycroft is not here to witness his embarrassing evening.
Sherlock whispers, and John’s hand stills.
The wife pressed his hand reassuringly: “Don’t blame yourself darling. You tried to do everything you could.
Sherlock closes his eyes and waits for the punch that will no doubt explode any second in his face.
“Can we please change the topic?
interrupts him.
What are you doing here?
He preens.
“You’ve travelled with the tube before?
“He is ready for visitors now.
Sherlock answers confidently, although his voice slurs far more than he would have liked. The cold water did not achieve much, he is still standing unsteadily.

"How's her preparation?"
How could this have happened? In such a short interval. It was unprecedented! Everything was temporarily blocked, the police had started their work and the civilians were hardly supported. M sighed thinking of the call he had just received, announcing nothing good. He was about to get up when Bill Tanner furiously entered his office held up by Eve Moneypenny.
"I don't do it for you." Eggsy added about ten minutes later. "I'm doing it to train because the blocks are accusing me of always wanting to fight everything and everyone."
"Thank you Greg, we'll be back to you soon. Say hello to Mycroft for me." John shouted before shaking his hand.
"Sherlock!"
"In less than 15 minutes, thank you." added Sherlock, leaning towards the driver.
"Very good, thank you Marina."
"I’m looking for him too, Holmes!"
"I’ll do it myself."
"Yes. It looks interesting."
"You did not say anything yet."
Indeed, it was complicated the traffic being blocked with these numerous detours put in place but the taxi had managed to find a way and in thirteen minutes, the duo had arrived. Sherlock gave the driver 50-pounds, and then they both took a quick step to the secure location where they came across a Sally Donovan not surprised to see them.
John knocked on the door of his next assignment, and it was answered by no one other than Sebastian Moran.
Mike, a father of three, saw the problem right away: Sherlock was bored silly. His energy, boundless even for someone his age, had no focus. He hated wearing his fine clothes, he threw his crown across the room, he couldn’t sit still (Mike had politely told Sherlock’s parents that this was typical of a small boy but they’d insisted Sherlock must be different because he was royal. Mike was too smart to argue.) Sherlock was too young to wander on his own and expend his energy on the grounds. He hated every governess. Mrs. Hudson managed to distract him for a time with stories and games and while that calmed him, he was still a bundle of nerves and inertia. Mike had sat down with Sherlock and in the end it hadn’t taken very long to discover what would appeal to him.
crying.
“It was a long time ago.” He ground out. “If Sherlock doesn’t want that, then I won’t give it to him—not that this is any of your damned business!” He was shouting by the end, and the man looked up at him. “Is that what his other dom did to him?” John asked in a quiet voice. “Forced him to do things he didn’t want?”
John went to work half an hour later and Sherlock called
“Not at home?” Betsy asked.
Sherlock looked surprised, but he stepped aside and she crept in, setting the mug down carefully.
Sherlock pouted, his lips pursing minutely as he thought over what John said. "I don't like rules imposed on me." He grumbled.
“Yes.” Greg muttered. He put the siren on again and did a hairpin turn, kicking up plumes of dust as they screeched off.
“Oh shut up!” He barked at the wall. The person yelled something unintelligible back and he stood there in a sulk, the violin and bow hanging limp from his hands. What if John never came back? What if that was it? Sherlock shook his head to scatter the awful thoughts. He set the violin down and took up his phone. He pulled up the text thread he had with John and had fingers poised to add to it, but he paused. What would he say? I miss you? Come home? Everything sounded needy as hell and he closed the thread. Seb’s most recent message popped up and he stared down at it listlessly, scrolling through the rest of them. John
"Mine too." He nodded. "Burned a bit, but it was good."
“Ow—John!”
“Do you want help cleaning up?” Mike asked Sherlock, wringing his hands and looking at the mess.
John switched the crop to his other hand and walked up to the fireplace. He glanced down, staring at Sherlock’s happy hard cock, before he gripped it in his fist. He grinned when Sherlock gasped and humped into his hand
He strode from the room, past the guard lurking in the hall and out the door into the dull cold morning. He pulled his coat collar up higher around his neck and another waft of
The peon finished speaking and bowed before scuttling off. A small gold dish rested at Mycroft's elbow, containing a pile of letters and an envelope opener with a handle in the shape of a gilded lion.
“Certainly, sir.” The waiter took John’s order and left their menus at the table, probably for reference later on. “I’ll have the chef come out to speak with you.” He said.
The doctor gave him a mild glare and Sherlock grinned. “Did she recover?” He asked.
Michael Jenkins woke up two days later on a rainy morning. Sherlock and John were at the hospital, outside his door with Lestrade while Jenkins’ doctor ran some tests. John and Lestrade were waiting quietly with large cups of coffee. Sherlock was pacing like a captive wildebeest doped up on adrenaline.
“Fascinating.” Sherlock kicked the door closed and pulled him into a kiss-hug, cradling the nape of his neck and humming happily. John kissed him hard and dug his hands into his bum cheeks and Sherlock made a surprised “mph!” noise.
“No.”
“I don’t know!” Greg put his hands up in supplication. “You come in here, wound tight as a snare drum and I’m trying to figure out why.”
“He’s injured.” Mycroft hissed.
“If you blow me right now, I’ll take them off.” John didn’t look away from his magazine and he turned a page.
Lestrade had wisely stayed back this whole time and he cuffed the man and handed him off to backup officers. John came away from it all with only bumps and bruises. When Sherlock stood up he had a metal star-shaped ornament sticking out of his bicep. Blood drizzled down his suit sleeve. Two customers fainted at the sight of it and the paramedics were summoned. Sherlock refused to linger in the shop, insisting that John would make him right.
“Thanks.” Sherlock gave him his best shy smile and crept inside. “You have a really nice house.” He said, glancing around. Lestrade was right about the guy being well off. The home was furnished in clean modern lines and dark wood. Leather furniture and the scent of wood oil and peppermint and fine whiskey tinted in the air. It was masculine and minimal yet the ruddy leather sofa, blankets and pillows, and seventy inch flat screen TV hinted at a man who liked comfort. Price was an afterthought here, not a hurdle.
It was easy to ride this train of thought, he’d been on that route countless times.
A laugh shot out of Sally’s mouth, but she quickly sobered when she saw neither John nor Sherlock laughing. “Is he serious?” She said to John. “What, did you lose a bet?”
“Are you hurting?”
Sherlock bounced up.
The leather slackened and then John was unbuckling the gag. He slid it slowly out of his mouth, wiping the saliva away again.
the way we are.”
“Any indication of a dom?” Lestrade put his hand out for the wallet and Sherlock passed it over.
"People you 'serviced'?"
His opponent didn’t look nearly as confident or cocky. In fact, he looked spitting angry. John watched, smiling, as Sherlock moved around the table and soundly beat the man. Based on the reaction of the audience when he won, this wasn't the first round Sherlock had played. A few notes went to Sherlock and John laughed. Sherlock gave a little bow to the applauding crowd and peered up when John wolf-whistled. His face lit up and he walked over to John, pushing his pool stick at a spectator. "How's the party?" He asked, smug.
“John, I’m fascinated by crime scenes and I own my own skull—two, actually.” He glanced at the bison head. “I’ve only ever been with one dom in my life—and I couldn’t even handle
Mycroft opened the folded letter and read it. He grunted and shook his head. Sherlock glanced down at the envelope, unable to place the generic, legible print. A scribe's hand, most likely.
“Of course he did.”
“Up.” John snapped at him. “Not here.”
“I’ll be, my clothes?”
“Liar.” Sherlock nuzzled into the side of John’s neck and kissed the sensitive spot under his ear as they moved up to the counter. Mrs. Hudson was at the register and she smiled. “You two.” She typed up their orders into the machine and winked at John. Sherlock was nosing around the doctor’s neck, tickling the skin there as John tried to pull his wallet out.
“Good. I feel awful.”
“Good…settle.” John’s hand fell away and the cool flat tip of the crop came to rest on his left scapula. It tickled as it it trailed over to his other shoulder, then down, grazing over each rib and ghosting across the tops of his bum cheeks, right above his crack. Sherlock licked his lips, closing his eyes as his mind spiraled down and down, the technicolor incandescent lights of power and thought dimming and slowing down to a fuzzy, greyscale hum.
"Do you regret it?" Sherlock asked.
“Is this okay?” John asked. “Do you want to eat at home?”
John laid some soft little pats on his cheeks with his hand to get him warmed up and sensitive. Sherlock stretched his arms forward and rested his face on his bicep. His shoulders were a little tense but he was relaxing, soothed by John’s touch. The doctor patted him a few more times, then smacked him a little harder. Sherlock squirmed and John couldn’t resist pinching his thigh. He yipped and spread his legs, encouraging John to touch him lower.
"Thank you. Fingers are slightly frozen but it went well enough." Sherlock handed John the violin. He gripped the neck, careful not to drop it on the concrete, as Sherlock crouched and picked the money out of the case. He replaced the violin and bow and stood, swinging the case across his back and cradling the hot cup in his cold hands.
"Why not? All the horrible inconveniences you've caused me. I killed your group of friends. Why not kill you?" He set his glass down and walked towards John. "Have you ever wondered why I didn't kill you that day?"
“Now your elbow.” He scooted forward in the chair, then paused. “Can I touch?”
“Good. Take my gown off.”
"I wasn't asleep." Greg stood up and stretched. John looked frazzled. His eyes were red and tired and his hair was a nest. Even his wrinkled, rumpled clothes looked exhausted. He set his bag aside and glanced around.
“Them.” John nodded at a grey-haired man in khakis and a blue shirt standing beside his female sub—a woman in a dark, modest dress with little polka dots all over who was kneeling at his side while they waited for the bus.
“I don’t know.” He murmured.
The servant's jaw clenched and Sherlock could see him putting his polite face on. "John will likely be unfit for service once his current appointment concludes. It will be very late and‒"
The door jingled and a loud group wandered in.
“Wait,” John said, “how do you want this to go?”
“Then quit wasting time and get your butt on the bed. Lay on your belly.” John pointed at the bed with the paddle and Sherlock scurried over, crawling onto the duvet and grabbing more handfuls of sheet. John pressed his hand to the small of Sherlock’s back and started thwacking him with the paddle over and over.
want to think about Mycroft while he was naked on top of John, thanks very much. He pushed the thought away and gave his dom a sly grin. “Enough about that though, there’s plenty of ways I
“You’ll see very soon that I’m not.” Sherlock finished the cigarette and rubbed it out in a nearby ash tray.
“Who is it?” The sub asked into the phone. Then to John, “He won’t say.”
Donovan was coming down the hall when he rounded the corner to head for his rooms. He’d forbidden her from riding with them.
"Sherlock Holmes."
“The dom showed up unexpectedly. She was in Defense and attacked me.”
“How long before you scare this one off?” She nodded at John, eager to shoot a barb back at him.
The second group ignored it all. They were enigmas. They went about their duties with a sort of soldierly commitment. They never caused fights, they rarely spoke. They were almost like ghosts, drifting about, doing what they were told. Just last week one of the men in this group climbed up the east wall that looked over the Iron Sea and cast himself down into the icy, jagged rocks. No one was sure of his name.
Sherlock hummed and John could feel the delicious rumble of his voice in his shoulder. He rinsed him off and turned off the water.
The argument continued for another ten minutes, with Sherlock snarling that John was emotionally constipated and John yelling about Sherlock's fixation on being right all the time.
“Oh?”
“Wh—me?” John spluttered.
He sank down onto his green chair, stricken with grief even though John was fine and very much alive in the loo not thirty feet away. Was this at all how that distraught sub at the crime scene a few weeks ago had felt, seeing her dom dead on the floor? The image of John, dead, tied to a chair with an iron spear piercing his bleeding chest and his dark eyes lifeless and cold made Sherlock pop to his feet again and pace for the loo. Subs didn’t go in Defense the way doms did, but Sherlock felt the overwhelming dark urge to hunt Shan down and kill her slowly and painfully. No one hurt his dom.
The doctor paused. Should he? Sherlock was his sub, but….
Sherlock brought in two cups of tea and eyed the wad of lights. "The longer the length of a cable, the more likely it is to tangle. The rigidity and diameter of the cable‒or in this case, the string of fairy lights‒also affect whether or not it tangles, as well as how much the disturbance the cable experiences." Sherlock sipped his tea. "Of course in this case the tangling probability is compounded by the fact that there are bits of glass sticking off the cable every eight or so inches."
The doctor yanked off his shirt and trousers, his hard cock bobbing up to full attention.
“Sh, sh. Hold still, good boy, hush.” John murmured nice things to him as he smoothed the cream over both cheeks, getting a generous amount on there. “Your bottom has taken a lot lately.” John noted, rubbing circles over the skin.
The pub was frequented by prostitutes, opium dealers, and all sorts of riff-raff. A long-standing fixture of the borough called the Barrens, Angelo's pub only attracted the various less reputable citizens of London. Sherlock loved the pork pies Angelo served and how little the patronage paid attention to him. Even if someone did recognize him they would dismiss it as a trick of the light. No one would expect to see any member of the beloved Royal Holmes family here.
“Because I’m asking you not to, and I’m your submissive.”
"What's popping, Doctor?" She asked. She sniffed the sugar and cinnamon apples.
“Phew.” John smiled weakly and willed his heart to please stop trying to escape through his chest, thanks. He stood and slid the band onto his sub’s left ring finger.
“When did this happen?” Mike asked.
Sherlock left and was back in moments balancing three cups. He set them down and closed the door.
“There now.” Logan nudged his limp arm with his foot. “Nice and quiet. Pliant.” He pulled the gag out of his mouth and untied Sherlock’s wrists, then his ankles. “Come on, roll over.” Logan grabbed his body.

"By what, adding fireplace soot to it?"
It was similar for doms, he knew from research. Doms also got a sort of chemical high from domming.

"What is that, exactly?"
Sherlock woke up, groggy and with a headache splitting his skull. He opened his eyes. Bright light blasted his retinas and he slammed them shut. His brain struggled to snap to conclusions.
“John, I can’t let you kill him. If you kill him, that’s jail time and Sherlock’s going to need you after this. I can turn a blind eye to that cabbie, but this? No. Take the pills.”
His arse blazed and he winced.
The attendant demanded silence and everyone resumed listening.

“Thank you, Michael.” John said. “You’ve been helpful.”
Sherlock gave him an incredulous look. “You think
Coel rested his hand on his shoulder and Sherlock giggled. “If I didn’t have a dom, I wouldn’t mind, but…”
The DI rolled his eyes. “What’s going on?”
John was quiet, scrolling and reading.
The victim had been the recipient of a rather amorous sub interested in cheating on his own deadbeat partner. That partner had possessed quite a jealous streak, and didn’t like the idea of the victim wearing his sub’s wedding band—hence the poisoning.
