He grinned all of a sudden, and his eyes sprawled wrinkles. John swallowed again.
"Yes."
But on those lonely, cold winter evenings, when the fire is cracking and the air smells like burned wood and the very unique odour of the flat, he feels repulsion. It is a false smell without John here. It should never smell like this when he isn't here. Sherlock wants to forbid the universe, the physics, all the air around him to lull him into this illusion of his own senses still. It would only cause the lump in his throat to grow further.
He doesn’t want to hold back anything, but they are in an office of bloody New Scotland Yard, for Christ’s sake! Sherlock’s head bobs back and forth over John’s throbbing cock. He looks down to see him there, swallowing between his thighs, and isn’t he everything he could’ve wished for? With the dark curls of a forest prince, the concentrated expression that makes that little wrinkle on the bridge of his nose appear, and those plum lips, pink cupid’s bow that he would die for.
"Mrs Hudson, you're a saint." He put a quick kiss to her forehead, and off he was. Throwing himself into the next command of Sherlock Holmes, taken off by a cab with unknown destination.
When they lead him the way, John shot one last glance in the direction of the woman, or The Woman, whose eyes were following them like that of a hungry lion.
like a new idea had sprung free.
John could not help but listen and obey the rumbling voice in which he spoke, soft as a purring jaguar. His eyes fell closed even before his back had touched the sofa's cushion. Yet, he gave his best to stay awake.
He hears Sherlock letting out a deep sigh of his own. John’s hand doesn’t stop there, and soon he is digging his fingers into the plum and muscular flesh of his arse. Sherlock gasps in his still sleepy state, and he is so warm and so limp. John presses his naked chest to Sherlock’s back as he uses both his hands now. He can feel his own hot arousal pooling in his groin, and the desire to rub his cock all over his beautiful genius detective gets ever harder to resist, the longer he is massaging those two arse cheeks beneath his hands.
How John was aching to say it. To tell this story to somebody, to get at least a grain of dust lifted off his chest. But he couldn't. Even if there had been only the two of them in this pub, he couldn't have. But that didn't mean that he was not aching to say it.
"The public knows me as Magnussen. Charles Augustus Magnussen. I am a businessman."
They had lost everything. No matter the outcome, the loss was certain. Eurus was triumphantly stepping on her brother's throat with her foot. Moriarty was lying to her feet. He tried to reach for Moran. But Moran, dead and empty behind his eyes, was facing the other way. And somehow, that made Moriarty's eyes just as empty. There was no energy of him around. No aura. No more will to live. No family. John saw himself in Moriarty's place, saw through his eyes across the battleground, past the piling bodies, a dead Sherlock Holmes. Heard in the distance no noise but that of fire, comfortably burning away homes and feeling nothing of the heat. Only cold, cold death's grip. And somehow, he did not want him to die like this.
John felt heat raising to his cheeks. He couldn't blush now. It really was quite inappropriate.
"Hoo, it's freezing out here! I should've brought a coat."
This could be exactly what John had been searching for. The shelf almost reached the ceiling, but he tried to take in what he could find. Most of the shelves were full of fluids. Chemical solutions coloured violet, striking green or brown and muddy. Other shelves had very questionable contents. He leaned down to make out what was swimming in one of the jars, for at first glance it looked like a gigantic tadpole. He was recoiling quickly as he realised that something was staring back at him.
“First of all,” he manages then, “I don’t think I want a wife and children, thank you very much. And maybe… maybe I’m not that serious when I call you things like that.”
"I'm not really... the dancing type."
, tells him
He held it out for him to take it, but John only hesitated and waited for the joke to come. When he realised that Sherlock was as serious about this as one who was about to lend an eye to someone else could possibly be, he let out a groan and opened his palm.
Little drops of water are running down his smooth jawline (recently shaven) and Sherlock's eyes cannot help but follow one of them all the way down the muscular neck (pulse visible) until it disappears beneath the crook of neck and shoulder blades, nestles above his collarbone. John's skin is less tanned from his chest down, nipples slightly hard from the sudden change of temperature in this room in opposite to the steaming shower.
Sherlock took the goggles from the instrument and placed them onto a pile of notes in a manner that could not exactly be described as careful. John almost chuckled at this, for the man and his contradictions still remained a mystery to him.
John quietly smiled to himself.
"I'm 'ere, ser."
(See the end of the chapter for
They moved on from this, but Sherlock had this look on his face. It was rare to ever see him this concerned. He had clearly seen something in that painting that he feared. But before John had the chance to ask him, Sherlock distracted him with another explanation about a painting. John tried not to be embarrassed by how little he knew about art. Instead he tried to listen. To learn. Not necessarily about art, but about the man who was walking him through it. About the way he moved, the way he retold and analysed the painter's intentions and mistakes. The more passionate he was about something, the more beautiful he became.
It helps. He shuts up, his brain shuts down and the fires are lit again.
There was a moment of stillness before one of them moved.
A curly-haired police officer came rushing through the door past Sherlock, ignoring everyone in the room but Greg (apparently) Lestrade. "Sir, some of our officers claim to have seen-"
"What do you want?"
, why aren't there enough facts, it should be so simple!
John tried to suppress a laugh. He failed. "Are we really doing this?"
Oh God. This was bad. He would laugh at him. Sherlock tried with all that lay in his power to not let his smile fall, but it grew smaller, lost its hope. He was beginning to feel ridiculous.
Suddenly John was overcome with the very overwhelming feeling of nausea. All the pretenses, the fake smiling, the passive-aggressiveness of it all was beginning to make him furious. He clenched his hands into fists to suppress the abrupt urge to punch someone, punch away the facade. Preferably Moran. He didn't know why.
"That you might mean it."
"Identity?" one of the men asked.
John seems to know what he needs, but makes a frustrated noise as he forces himself to stop moving. Breathless panting is filling the room as he tries to catch his breath to say something. "Hold onto the headboard."
Their eyed locked with a flicker of desperation and importance in the air between them. Something was about to change. It would crash down on both of them, on everyone they knew and the world itself, and it would leave them to be changed men.
"I'm not working for you," John protested.
He squeezed his hand tighter as the world exploded. Left and right from the stage rockets fired off and into the air like a hundred shooting stars. The noises were numbing their ears, a deafening whistle on a scale, and their hearts staggered as the sparks kept sprinkling above them. White and red and yellow shots of firework attacked the high ceiling,
"Sherlock!"
James.
Sherlock almost looked offended for a second, and John gulped. "You, uhm, you said that, uh, Moriarty stole your heart? What did he want with it?"
of two hands applauding, accompanied by the sound of heels over stones. They all threw their heads around, tense, expectant. But as an alluring voice began to speak, John knew exactly who it belonged to.
,” while he tries not to die from the overload of pleasure and the lack of air.
"Fun?" Sherlock tried not to laugh. If this was what John thought had happened then … Well.
Someone came by with a tray full of champagne, and John took a glass. Who knew how long this evening would be?
On their way out Sherlock and John did not say a word to each other. There was simply nothing to be said. They were walking the stairs up and out of the back door, leaving behind mouths that knew better than to argue and eyes that looked down on the ground in defeat. In that room, they were leaving behind the possibility of all of them meeting again, while ahead there lay the war. They may all find each other again on streets turned into a battlefield behind the trigger or bleeding out in the open. Sherlock might end up as property of the knighthood with someone studying him inside out or maybe used as a weapon himself. John hated even the briefest thought of it.
"What are we doing?" he wondered aloud.
Now that he had time to run his eyes over him properly, he noticed something else. This was not his first glass of champagne. It was his
John, mentally being on his way already, forced himself to hesitate. He wouldn't feel at peace with himself feeling like his head-over-heels decisions were putting other people in danger.
Next stop: The City of London.
John chuckles beside him. He can feel the vibrations of it, and it grounds him a little.
“Let’s have sex.”
John shook his head to himself. "Jesus..."
He wants to never look down again. Because he can barely stand the whole universe above him, but he is absolutely on a loss when it comes to John Watson right here, right next to him. Sherlock knows that John is looking at him, instead of the events the sky would have to offer. He starts to feel insecure, slowly embarrassed, because he also knows how childish his expression must look like. His eyes wide, his mouth slightly open. He can't help himself.
"Well, he was on the verge of becoming a rather public figure, so I suppose most people in London did."
"You are being expected, Captain," they told him as John and Sherlock were led through the gate and across the yard.
Lestrade had never left their side, ready for answers.
"Well, you're talking about Irene Adler now. A part of his own abilities he gives to her to take control over her. But you don't seem to be affected by this. You are still yourself."
"Christ!" John shouted out, finally realising what had just happened. "You said we wouldn't kill her!"
"You will never ever have to share me with anyone. Not as long as I live. And you will never have to give me away." Whispering the words into his ear in a low voice, "This is forever, Sherlock. We’re forever."
. Think about it-" she continued, but Sherlock's raising hand shut her up.
out. Sherlock looked agonised himself for a second, his brows pulled together, building a bridge that wrinkled above his nose. But it eased out as the eyeball suddenly sat between his fingers, a red tail hanging down from the back of it.
He had seen so many dark places himself, he had started feeling that there was not one bit of him left now that would belong to a place that was not covered in shadows, in order for him to make sure that the sun could keep on shining. Not that he would consider himself a hero. He was just doing what he was good at, which was facing the darkness. His face was much too worn, now, to be cast in the light.
Only seconds later he wanted to punch himself for this. After swallowing this urge, John retreated from this scene as fast as he could.
"It is no hardship for me to come down here," she continued.
At least she gave him a deserved, if half-hearted, smack to the chest. "Running off on your own without telling your friends … If I didn't have so much faith in you, I would be very mad at you, just know as much. And you too, Dr Watson!“
He took the mug from John's hands before he could even think of protesting. With Sherlock not sitting opposite him in the armchair anymore, he seemed to notice the large window behind the chair for the first time now. All of a sudden, he startled.
"Dr John Watson," he introduced himself.
John sat down on the red chair. "Yes, I have recently had the pleasure to meet Charles Augustus Milverton. Marvellously insufferable."
John shifted closer to the window before the man could stop him to see if there was anyone – Sherlock, Lestrade, anyone! – who could help him if this really was a trap. His hand was on his gun. The man grabbed him by his sleeve.
Sometimes he wished the detective would stop expressing himself so cryptically. They had arrived at Scotland Yard, quickly adjusting their pace to the other one's steps like a unit. Lestrade was already waiting for them at the reception.
The world was blurry. Blurry and defined by one constant sting at the back of his head. No, not constant. It let go of his nerve endings every time his heart paused between beats. Every throb that shot through his veins brought pain to his temples. It drowned every other sound for a while. Blink, blink, blink. John began to gain back his consciousness. He was sure he had opened his eyes, but his world was still covered in darkness. For a moment too long he worried that he might have lost his eyesight. A moment that made his heart stagger in his chest and brought another wave of pain to his head. He realised then, by looking around and blinking more, that his eyes weren't used to the dark yet.
"Wagner," said Sherlock.
"You trusted each other," John tossed in, trying to gulp down the tiniest twinge of unreasonable jealousy as hard as possible.
John felt sick in the stomach. As silently as he could he pushed the door open and entered the hallway, gun out and raised to the side of his head. He went up the stairs, cursing under his breath as one creaked under his step. It was awfully quiet, and his nerves were tense to the point of breaking. He let the door to the living room fly open with a push, ready to shoot.
He shook off his train of thoughts and instead focused on the long wound that stretched itself around her whole forearm like a glove out of burned skin. He should have seen it at first glance. They were seated opposite each other, on one of those elegant, golden tables. She looked much smaller now, the aura of dominance thrown off her, which was now replaced by a curiosity that made her look far less like a seductive demon. She had to be more than sharp features, keen eyes, vicious smile.
Mary walked towards him with one knee buckling, and her dark red coat was hanging around her shoulders like the wings of a blood-soaked, sleeping bird.
"I built this body. Not James Moriarty."
The man's face showed a sly half-smile. Was there something funny?
"Ball? What ball?"
"Are they in?" Sherlock asked, hiding his guilty conscience by ignoring it.
Then John thinks about what has just happened, trying to blink the confusion off his face before it finally clicks. "Wait a minute. Are you jealous?" Well, that is… surprising. That, as well as the possessive and excited flutter of arousal he feels at the concept of this. Sherlock is rarely ever jealous. At least not in a way John would recognise as jealousy. He knows he is a very jealous person himself. Various events in the past (hello Irene, Janine, Jim from IT) have made that more than clear to him. Additionally, during the last several months of them finally being them and together in
John didn't have to think about it for long to feel a shiver run down his spine. "Imagine if a whole army could do it," he whispered.
John's head snapped around in anger. "Listen-"
John only frowned at him. "First of all, I am a doctor, not a tinkerer, and if you think I would just blindly-"
Sherlock very loudly cleared his throat and took the liberty to position himself in the center, and between John and Molly, and do the rest of the introductions himself. "Very well, everyone knows our little Doctor now, do we? Good, John, so you know Molly Hooper. Next to Molly we have … Tom?" looking at the one John had referred to as awkward up to now, and he nodded at the mentioning of his name, so yes, Tom.
"Territory? You're making yourself sound like a dog, Sherlock."
"Sally Donovan?"
So here they are now, a couple of hours later, making out on the sofa. Sherlock isn't able to keep his hands off John since he knows he is allowed to do all of these things now. But luckily, he doesn't have to. John very happily lets Sherlock climb on his lap for him to be snogged senseless. Physical intimacy with him fills a crack in his heart, and the feelings of this are so new and yet strangely familiar to him. It's so perfect, too perfect almost, to
Sherlock stops moving for a moment and then an overwhelming shudder flashes through his whole body, and suddenly he feels every muscle in his thighs clench, he feels the beginnings of an orgasm starting to take over him. His strokes are quick and utterly out of control, only serve to finally get him over the edge, and his knees buckle enormously. He starts to move the finger that is still inside of him around just a little, but it is enough to wash over his vision and his lids are pressed together before he opens them, only to see that the world around him is flooded and his whole body lights up to become numb. He can only distantly hear himself shout out
"We should like to make a little trip through the museum."
They swap positions and Sherlock lets his hands run up his thighs, his hands still shaking and his heart still pumping too fast. He has to put his head down, and his jaw lays above one of John's hipbones because he has trouble holding it up himself.
"Sherlock?"
together. But no, you had to crawl right into Sherlock Holmes's fucking mind and make yourself at home." He had the slightest Eastern accent that he was trying his best to hide under an American. He had seen his share of the world. An expert on murder and assassinations. Someone like John … Who was he to someone like him? Just another pawn in the long-term game of destruction and taking over the world.
again after this. But if you'll still have me, John," His eyes linger on him with the intensity of a thousand suns, "I will never leave you again."
"I'm not- please, I know what this sounds like. I am not trying to lecture you, to criticise your work. Alright, perhaps that last one, a tad. But what I am actually trying to tell you is ... I do know what happens when one is playing the hero. I have experienced it, I have seen deaths, and many. Deaths that could have been so easily prevented. It was the hardest part of my job in the knighthood. To see men die, good men, women, and tell my troop they had died for a greater cause when I knew with every cell in my body that they have not. If only everyone had played by the rules."
Sherlock's hips stutter on their own and his cock slips up John's crack. He makes a whimpering noise in the back of his throat as John's hips move in little circles and he is slowly riding Sherlock through three layers of clothes.
"Them. The vampyres."
He pulls them apart ever so slightly, exposing the hole in between, and Sherlock throws his head back (almost straight against John’s forehead) to let out a loud growl.
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes flickered. Their hands, John's face. "Sherlock," he offered in kind.
"Mr James Moriarty," he said sternly, raising his voice to increase the impact the name bore, "has personally engaged me to take a look at Ms Irene Adler's injury. I'd rather not disappoint him. Would you?"
Somehow, this hurt more than anything he could have said. John was breathless. "Why?"
John frowned. "What against?"
) has the audacity to look up to him from under his lashes like a naughty boy who knows exactly what he has done but would still lie in your face about it.
"One of my theories. The transfer of energy of an organic matter into a lifeless one." He stood with his hands on his hips. "Needless to say, it didn't work."
But he can't break eye contact yet, gives his best to keep them open – because he is
What? Not
When John took a deep breath, he was surprised by how much it felt like he was coming back to life. "Hold on. Are you saying he wanted you to be involved in a battle?"
"This way, I can keep my eye on you."
"A magic trick." The voice filled the room, though there was no owner in sight.
John could see that it truly had not been that difficult for her to catch. Now he wished he wouldn't have asked.
"They say the brain and the heart are opposites, but they work together. What they need in a body, like the fuel of an engine, is my soul. And that only transfers with the help of..."
"...This is how I knew what he was doing. He did it to me."
"We wait," Irene interrupted. She received ten eyes full of shock. Except for Wiggin's pair, who was the slightly bemused bystander that he always was.
“We all have British accents.”
John actively decided to ignore this. His senses narrowed down and time slowed. He could hear a thousand teeth clasping, a million legs tapping, scratching floorboards, hissing. He could hear Kate's hands tightening around the sheet and her whispered, "Where's Ms Adler?" enhancing to a cry. There seemed to be no way out.
Moriarty who did this," Sherlock responded between clenched teeth. Anderson was not listening.
"I- Er, I just..." he starts, but his voice lacks the air to say more.
is supposed to be. But he doesn't. He is almost sure they both don't, for once.
"Have we arrived already?" he asked.
John can only sigh and shake his head as he watches the way Sherlock shoves their last client out of the door of 221B. He looks more than just a little taken aback. Clearly surprised by Sherlock’s manners. He is in his mid-thirties, tall, lean and a little… John wouldn’t call it geeky but no better word comes to mind. Shy, possibly. His sister has gone missing - or so he presumes - and Sherlock has looked bored throughout more than half of his story. John wonders why he agrees to take the case in the first place. He knows why, actually. Sherlock Holmes is, and he would childishly cover his ears and try to talk over him if John just so much as tried to tell him so, a very kind-hearted man of philanthropic nature. He just isn’t very good at expressing it at times. Just like right now.
"It was a tiny bit funny."
"Look. You don't have to explain. I understand. Apologies for asking."
. So could it be that perhaps James Moriarty, the possible criminal mastermind, was actually, in a very questionable and twisted way, on their side? An idea to save the people of London and win this war that could only come true after lots of people were murdered first.
"But – and let me remember this correctly – doesn't he think you're missing?"
Watson? After all, it was yourself who advised me to rest my leg, did you not?"
Sherlock hasn't looked down yet, but he knows that John is not looking at him any longer. He does not feel the warmth of his eyes, as sentimental and illogical as this sounds. He coughs once before speaking up. "No, I mean ... what are they? Why are they falling?"
John had not said another word to him after the heated conversation in Lestrade's office had ended so abruptly. Confusion had taken over in his head, and he wasn't sure how to feel about this whole business anymore. To be fair, it had been quite the ride for him so far, rushing into what turned out to be this huge thing that cast a dangerous shadow over the capital of England. There was this renewed pressure of the responsibility for so many lives in his hands, as well as the general lack of faith in himself ever since his return, that created a dangerous mixture. If he wanted to be useful in this plot, full of madness and the unknown, he needed someone to rely on. He already knew that Sherlock tended to just leave people behind. He didn't think this was something he could take. Yes, he decided, if they were going to be partners, they had to be able to trust each other.
John gave him a tense smile. That hurt. Hearing him say out loud what he thought would happen to them like it was written in stone. In that case, he thought, to the Major it should be a disappointment to see him again. Not knowing what to say, John looked around like there was something else to be found here. Arms behind his back, he stared at the windows.
"You have any allies?"
"You're a spy. Is that what you do? You, spying on Moriarty?"
, he thought.
It didn't take him long to examine the injury. Focused on the foot beneath his hands, he began to explain his findings out loud: "Yes. Sprained ankle. Thought so. A very common type of sprain, inversion. It's a good thing you had the sense to come here so quickly. The foot is a little swollen already. Probably causes pain along the outer side of the ankle, but it doesn't strike me to be all too bad an injury."
"You are a fraud," John observed. It made sense. The man had always reminded him of a shark.
John's hands were wandering again. Slowly, they were running down his neck. "Tell me, Sherlock," he murmured in the sweetest of tones.
"Yes, I think there are indeed, young man."
“Yeah,” John whispers roughly, so rough and so low he could hurt himself on that sandpaper voice. “You’re still a fucking posh boy.”
"I suppose."
The instant thrill of excitement rushed through his veins, starting from the back of his neck to his arms and fingertips. He was involving him. He needed him. At once, he said. There was only one problem...
"But- But there is so much that I... and- and the war?"
It was a little colder today, but Sherlock wore his long coat, and it wasn't like he would freeze anyway. The streets were crowded, more so than on most days, and on this one in particular. Sherlock and John were standing on the other side of the street, watching the rich and the beautiful enter the big house in their posh evening attire. Long dresses and masked faces were all around them. People were streaming in to become this cluster in front of the entrance doors of The Professor. John had already spotted Lestrade among the crowd, but he was sure Sherlock was able to recognise a variety of other officers in their disguises.
Now it is John's turn to let his voice go much deeper as he doesn't cease to point out, "I'm an army doctor," and then takes advantage of Sherlock's gaping mouth.
Among all the graveness and horrors of all the terrible things out there that were breathing down John's neck, there was a thin silver lining on the horizon now. It was ridiculous, really, and childish to laugh in this moment, and John had rarely felt greater relief or freedom.
"I don't believe you, Dr Watson."
"He did not mean to do any harm. At that time we were, him and me together, trying to save him from the big bad spider."
"We can't both stare, Doctor."
John cleaned the wound with woollen cloth and a chemical solution he had pulled out of his medical bag next to his hat. She hissed as he tried to gently pat the burned off skin, but she held herself back from retreating.
"I don't think so," he said.
"Listen. And I need you to trust me, do you understand?" He grabbed both of John's upper arms, forcing him to focus on him and only him. "The Woman is not what you think she is. In fact, not at all. She is extremely dangerous and she is part of the ring of people who did this to me. What do you think is this place? Do not think for only one
"We've come so far together, John. I am so, so proud of you," he whispered. His hand reached out for him and John took it. "Did I ever tell you?"
is all on his account. He is the one having made a mistake! He chose the wrong direction, and of course the suspect did not miss the opportunity to run out of their reach again, his chance to flee. Not something an innocent man would do either, so this failure is even the more fatal.
"Yes," Sherlock told him. He hadn't looked up nor made a move. "Enjoy the little pleasures of life while I cannot."
"You don't sound surprised."
"They are certainly taking their time!" Sherlock was attacked from both sides and shoved the one from him while the other was trying to bite his neck before realising he hit a bunch of wires. He shot the first one in the face and met the other with his elbow before John kicked his feet away and his sword pierced the heart as the vampyre lay flat on the stones. Ten others followed one dead beast, and even though one knight fell after twenty vampyres had fallen before them, it wasn't looking too good. They shot back and bit back, and knights around them were dying and screaming. Slowly, Piccadilly Circus filled with blood. Even the fountain water couldn't wash it away.
"Witchcraft
He came closer, and slowly. "I never thought our paths would ever cross again."
particularly related to his own existence and the possibility of this reality), John has managed to get up again during the kiss, and the observant detective just notices this as he places himself on top of his own lap.
"And you are not from here. Interesting," the man continued. "But this is not all there is to you, is it?"
"Yes, well. Let's just say the owner may owe me a favour."
"So." Sherlock let him wait.
Could he feel the sensation of skin on not-quite-skin, the squeeze and the thin layer of sweat that was slowly covering John's palm? There was something in Sherlock's eyes – something he felt oddly connected to, and something that sparked in the space between them. Finally, they let each other go. John realised his tea had gone cold.
"I am afraid that, for now, it must."
John nodded, still trying to wrap his head around this man. It was a bit obvious that he was doing some of it on purpose. (Playing the violin like an angel for John's arrival, for example – a Wagner interpretation,
"I visited Ms Adler to see after her, you remember? As a test for Moriarty to judge what I'm worth, probably. That's, erm. Yeah, that's where I met him."
The voice out of the dark made John's whole body jump. The torch fell out of his hand and to the floor with one loud noise; the sound of wood hitting stone.
"Ah. So you've built a team with real people? Who you share real information with? Are perfectly open and honest with at all times?"
"I promise I will look after your
He kicked her off and pinned her down instead, and in a blink, she was Sebastian Moran again. It didn't matter, same person, same enemy, so he punched him in the gut and watched him spit out air and then, with the incredible strength he had, roll back on him, now with his claws scratching on his armour. The tiger was back, keeping him down with its five hundred pounds and immeasurable strength. It bared its teeth and John was sure if there was ever a time for a tiger to bite a person's head off it was now.
The waitress brought the breakfast, an omelette and boiled eggs. Nothing fancy, though he hadn’t seen a proper meal in such a long time that it still made his mouth water. The lady had also put a small basket full of sliced bread on the table, perhaps expecting Sherlock to eat something as well. He was not having any of it, though, of course he wasn't. As soon as John took fork and knife in hand and was about to take a bite, Sherlock started talking.
"Who?"
But as much as John liked their brunch dates, he was glad to be back in safe and warm 221B, having it be just the two of them. It was almost time for a round of afternoon tea. But first, there was something else he craved a little more. Standing in the middle of their living room, with the curtains drawn wide open before the large windows, he smiled at Sherlock from across the room and held out his hand.
"Hmmh. Let's not."
“I can wait for you to figure this out.”
"If you must know," Sherlock tilted his head with a pointed look and a mocking smile, "Yesterday has made me curious as to what this body is able to do. Hence, I tried out one thing or another."
But he doesn't write poetry. Why waste your time on something so trivial to his work? Also: why risk giving away more of what lays in the very depths of your heart than strictly necessary? (Which has already been more than enough at this point.)
is the word John Watson has looked for. Something he is currently lacking, standing in a cramped locker with Sherlock Holmes pressing him against the wall. He’s kneeling, a sight John can hardly ever not be mesmerised by, and at the moment massaging his hardening cock through the dampened fabric of his underwear.
"...I have begun to learn what it means to hurt. Pain and loss and heartbreak. Only from missing you so much. And through that pain, I fear, you have saved me again. I just- I needed to- to survive to see you again. Even if that means you will never want to see
"I think he's right. Whatever he has to say might be bigger than us right now."
"Life is as full of contradictions as it is of similarities. And besides," Sherlock raised a brow and one corner of his mouth. "One doesn't have to be stupid and draw attention by standing around. But one should certainly be allowed to be fashionable."
“Listen to me, you ratbag! Fancy playing the hero one more time and I will be there. You won't be able to run or hide from me and I will kill you very slowly, make you feel every atom of your pathetic being while I skin you and lay eggs in whatever will be left of your flesh.”
Sherlock, in turn, gave him a knowing look. He knew he was at fault here. But there was something else in that look. The curiosity that John arose in him, the fear of him knowing more than he ought to.
"Dr John Watson," Moriarty announced, "Having been here for so little a time, and already done so much good. He cured our beloved Ms Adler on his very first day, did you know? What a remarkable man!"
"I wasn't going to," Mrs Hudson chuckled and took a few steps aside for them to walk past her. If she was wondering why Mary would call her doctor by his Christian name, she didn't say so.
"Stripes," the man completed.
Sherlock gasps and John lets go.
When he exhaled the next shuddering breath it painted a milky cloud onto the window.
John let that pass without comment. For such clever a genius he seemed to have a lot of steam to let go, and John could relate to that incredibly well. With the slight difference that, when his frustration boiled over, he usually ended up punching somebody rather than some
in the morning, those wonderful mornings where Sherlock has actually slept and still looks all soft and not quite awake. He calls him
Sherlock is back at the Landmarket. John (with a lot more facial hair, he almost forgot about that), an engagement ring in front of him, and this
The eyes of everyone in the room were boring into him, and the man was exposed. He swallowed, once, his mouth twitching downwards. Until he finally threw his hands up and gave in.
Not to value the gift that had been given to humanity, the gift of being healthy and loved. Suddenly, he wondered if one's mindset could only come to this conclusion when one did not know what it was like … Being valued, loved. Only knew what it was like to be alone. What that had to be like, not feeling alive? Not having flesh, nor bone, nor cells or a heart. Being an engine. But now John was reminded of something else.
"Maybe," Sherlock whispered with a tiny smile on his lips, looking down at his fingers or the tablecloth.
Always more than sheer amazement. And between the two of them it will always be so much more than sex.
"I shot him." Seeing Tom as a walking corpse, empty eyed and broken, took all the willpower she had left in her to pull the trigger. But she had pulled the trigger. Saved Greg's life. "He can rest now."
That's how Sherlock finds himself behind the shower curtain for the second time this morning. His racing brain gained some blood back already, desperately trying to work out what is happening and how and why and that slowly but surely gives Sherlock a headache. The hot water doesn't help, only in making him dizzy and his sight blurry. He lets his body stumble forward a bit, his cheek pressed against the cool tiles and his mouth hanging open.
, he added in his head. But this was not the time for self-pity.
He stood again, motioning John to get up as well.
"You know, Dr Watson, men like you would be very much needed at the place I work at. You are quite quick."
When the taller man shook his head and closed his eyes for a second as if to keep his thoughts in order. The dark curls on top of his head quivered and bounced from one side to the other. His eyes opened again and regained focus on John and John alone. This could not be considered staring anymore, it was something else entirely. He opened his mouth and this peculiar voice flowed out like water from a breaking dam.
"With our work fuelling me, my head became clearer. I understood what I was doing, what he was doing. We began building this body together. Measured me, designed me up to the very last detail. I knew I was going to... lose to him. He was going to steal my mind from me."
The hot water is washing away the sweat he knows must be spreading all over his body by now, caused by the sheer thoughts of John's hands on him.
"Well, although I'd say they are obliged to teach you this in medical school, but an ear is the body's tool used for audible purposes. It is a receiver, not a transmitter. We cannot communicate through it."
John had read about him in the papers. That was why the name of the inspector had struck him as familiar. He just hadn't been sure about the pronounciation.
No one else was allowed to know of them. Of the existence of a race that was superior in battle, bestial and yet sharp. John had been able to live with the bearing of those secrets and he knew what was at stake at all times if he was anything other than ready for the next day full of life or death choices. He knew and everyone else knew, and that made them share something that was truly special in its own tragic way. They shared their losses and joys, secrets and traumas.
"Are you … ?"
much.
Enjoy the epilogue!
Moriarty, blinded by his loneliness in an ever changing world and the chance of a family, did not see her true intentions. Or perhaps he actively chose to look the other way one too many times. John's eyes switched back and forth between Sherlock and Irene. They were so alike, Moriarty and he. Two lonely boys caught up in the dangerous game of battling their own demons. Only that Sherlock Holmes had chosen to fight against the pain that Moriarty inflicted on the world. God knows they would all be lost, had Sherlock ever decided to follow Moriarty on his dark path.
John had to suppress a laugh. "A magician? Really?"
The room turned dark for what felt like far too long a moment in which to be surrounded by complete darkness. The flames recovered from the impact and bathed the walls and ceiling into an orange light. John could hear his pounding heart in his ears. With his instincts still working, his body had settled into a defensive posture before he could even think about it. Weapon? His eyes searched the room. Do not move. Where the hell was it?
The way in which that man was eyeing him from head to toe made an actual shiver run down his spine. He was not sure what it said about him that he was slowly becoming angry as much as uncomfortable. John had no idea what this grandfather could want from him, and just as he began wondering he asked himself if he really was that little girl's relative.
They settled further into the back of the pub near the window. John had finished his drink already, and they were both drinking Porters now, sitting opposite each other as the sun was going down outside.
"What about you, then?” he found himself asking. “You and Lestrade? How did all of that... happen?"
So John really was the exception to the rule? Sherlock had never particularly kept his distance with him, but he had also never felt completely trusted by him. After all, he knew now that there was yet so much more he had not told him.
"You're right. We need to find Lestrade and evacuate the building."
When Sherlock starts feeling, his whole body tenses for a second. It's all too much. His lips tingle with sensation, move on their own, every time John pulls back a bit, they push. There is a pleasant pain that makes his limbs feel numb when John holds his bottom lip between his teeth and
She would kill him. The thought ran soberly through his head on a line that was just on the verge of panic. She would either choke him or crush his windpipe before he got the chance to gasp for air.
"Sherlock?"
"Is this what you think happened?" Sherlock asked, his tone less sharp.
John curses under his breath and wiggles his hips, nothing being quite enough. Insecurity manages to slip through and poke into his dizzy head for a second. He has never done this before (he thinks). But as he looks up at John,
He lifted the necklace over his head and let it sink into his hand.
The two guards came up on stage and hastily began getting Moriarty's head through the noose. Moriarty nodded at them in sympathy. "Pardon me for the delay. Of course, I don't know about you, but you see, I didn't exactly have any other plans for the day."
His head falls back and a loud moan escapes him, the prickling doesn't stop and he can clearly feel something twitch down there. This would be much too embarrassing, wouldn't he be too distracted by John's mouth which is currently climbing up his inner thigh, dragging another heavy breath out of him, another acceleration of heartbeats.
Elizabeth? There was something so familiar about her face.
It was beating like a drum.
together), only now he is smiling broadly, almost showing teeth. He looks down on him with pure affection and Sherlock feels naked. (He is naked. Did he forget?) Absolutely exposed.
His eyes widened behind the white crow. Losing the mask behind the mask for a second too long.
, there is nothing he wants to do more than fuck him, mark him, come on him. The hand Sherlock has wrapped around his shaft tightens around him, slowly. The slowest and most pleasurable torture. His hand moves upwards. Sherlock’s eyes are glued to the sight of it, the first little drips of precome leaking out. His cheeks are flushed. He feels his hot breath going fast, and knowing he is so affected by
John exhaled, carefully. Sherlock's voice had dropped, low and transforming into a shudder running down John's back.
Sherlock’s heart feels like it's bursting.
Ah. That explained his reaction.
Sherlock's mouth had become a thin line like he was forcing himself to keep from bursting. In the end, he just gave him a sharp nod and turned to the moon, closing his eyes. John imagined he had never before heard words that came close to how much John cared about him. His heart was aching at the thought but it also jumped with delight at being the first to give this to him now. Whatever this misunderstood little boy in there might need for him, John was ready to do it. Even if doing it meant dying with it.
Of course, John had limited experience on that particular thing, but then again, he didn't. The night in the forest, the night he had been bitten ... a part of him had died back there. He had been convinced that it was over, had said his goodbyes to the world, and he had accepted death. Had been more than willing to tolerate the short period of unbearable pain the bite inflicted, and then a part of him had separated from him to raise to heaven or to hell. He would never know. And he would never see it again.
“You want everything to be clever, don’t you?”
"I won't have you die on me," he whispered to him as they sank down together. "Not on my watch, I won't have it."
The yard was full of what could only be people of the police, walking up and down and around one body and a puddle of blood on the ground. Or rather, one half of a body. Sally Donovan was approaching them with a look of displeasure on her face.
John stood up as well and watched Sherlock through the glass of the tube, which made his face look even more alienated and his eyes more colourful than they already were.
. Apparently, everyone was giving Wiggins far too little credit for his abilities.
Sherlock is currently caught in a disturbingly realistic kind of dream and will be utterly shattered as soon as he wakes up.
“And that makes you angry?” Sherlock asks.
John, or rather John's body, decided that for now it was the best option to trust the detective once more. "If she is not dead, then where is she?"
Sherlock blinked, a lot, and he mouthed a word or sentence that had no sound because his voice was stuck in his throat. John slowly, slowly let his hand slide out of his own and stepped away from him. He had been called for. They would both be fine, for now.
"Whatever."
A little smile fell to the floor. "I'll leave you to it," she said quietly. Hoping the great Sherlock Holmes deduce this one for himself.
Sherlock smiled a smile at him that pulled one corner of his mouth upwards. "Baker Street," he confirmed, then turned to leave him.
John enjoyed it. Not so much the steam engines or horseless hansoms that drew the attention of excited crowds and journalists, but rather the little things in life. Like new models of wooden rifles, refined through magnifying scopes and golden cogs that reminded him of clockwork. Some knights even built their weapons themselves. They were not allowed to discuss their personal lives, of course, but even as a Knight Captain, giving his instructions and dominating his unit in battle, he still found himself wondering at times. He knew that this had, and would probably always be, a problem of his. The more you knew about a person, the more attached you would eventually become. And attachment, he had learned, was always a bad idea in the life he was leading.
But Moriarty was spreading out his arms and held his stand in front of Sherlock who was still on the floor. "You are my greatest creation," he told him over his shoulder, "Don't think I'll have her destroy everything you are."
"I will have to get back to you, Dr Watson. But for now, there is work to do. Feel free to address all of your questions to Mr Wiggins, who will escort you back to your home. You are dismissed."
The next thing Sherlock says, once again, just sounds like the deep murmuring of a baritone, unable to be recognised as English, let alone words. Although Sherlock could be insulting him in a language of which John had never even heard before, for all he knows. "Come again?"
, universes and the sun is there and the moon is there. John is there. John is not up there, he is down here with him, but he could be. John could be up there, could be his whole universe. The only solar system he has ever cared for: John Watson - a whole different universe in itself. How can he be like this? How can anyone stand him without feeling like John was swallowing them whole?
"Sherlock," John breathed.
John's heart recoiled in his chest and his eyes blew wide at the sound of his name from that man's mouth. He could not be serious, this had to be a joke!
"I feel like you're trying."
It felt strangely inappropriate to walk side by side like this with Mary. John had shrugged off his white coat before she placed her hand around his shoulder, and when she almost tripped, John caught her by tightening his grip around her waist. They walked out of the clinic like this and he did not even dare to look back at Sarah Sawyer, knowing her look of confusion would make him reconsider. But that had to mean, undoubtedly, that he didn't want to reconsider.
Magnussen smiled. "You could offer me a secret."
He was glaring back at him, took in the high cheekbones and the perfect structure of his face, so different and yet pleasing in a way he could not explain. He could not quite believe that someone like this should have existed before, because how could anyone look like this? Until now he had simply believed that Sherlock's former body had looked just alike him, but now he wasn't so sure. Maybe it was all just a constructed web of lies that fooled him. But maybe he found he didn't care in the slightest.
"Yes."
John rolled his eyes and grinned.
John took the ear, and his fingers brushed his (oddly enough still soft and warm) palm before he tucked it away into the pocket of his waistcoat. "Alright, alright, van Gogh."
side of him. He knows it has always been there, but to see the detective display his emotions almost without any protest - on the surface - is still a bit unusual, if not overwhelming at times. Now is a time to be overwhelmed a little, not for John but for Sherlock instead. He doesn't want to have this conversation. Yet, he so very much wants to make it clear to John that it is not his fault. That it never was and never would be. That, in fact, it always was Sherlock, because Sherlock is useless and imperfect and he makes too many
"Pray, take a seat, Dr Watson."
Now the name set even his nerves on alert. "You could say I've heard of him, yes."
"John, what are you doing here?" Sherlock asks, meaning the whole situation, the whole odd morning and the confusing behaviour, and he hopes he could finally wake up from this dream. He just wants his defences back.
"The time has come!"
John watched his eyes darken. "Have you found your answer now?"
His other hand joined Sherlock's in mid-air where they found each other naturally. Sherlock took a step back, and John followed. He taught him each step without saying a word, made his body the only language John would have to read. John's body read for him, followed even though Sherlock gave him the lead. Soon his ears picked up on the music on their own and began to understand the pace, the highs, the lows. His body moved to it, but his eyes never left Sherlock's. He switched from the one to the other inside the shiny mask of a crow, between the long beak, finding those eyes to look like an iceberg in the sun, but never cold. How could he not be cold if he wasn't flesh and bones?
John did not look back. He didn't have to. His eyes were blind, and before him, he saw the past. One thought reached him distantly, and it was that without Sherlock's steady hand he would have collapsed then and there.
But John continued, "Some just aren't made to play by the rules. There is nothing wrong with that."
This time, he can actually hear John moving his head so quickly and watching him with astonishment. "Wait, you mean ... you don't know anything about shooting stars?"
"Well, Sally Donovan you seem to already know for some reason," he rather murmured than said.
“Who?”
He’s not only alive, he is relaxed, he is calm, he is healthily resting, and gloriously naked underneath the blanket they share. It’s different, of course, to wake up in the not very well known environment that is Sherlock’s bedroom, with the light illuminating the room in ways foreign to John’s routine. But he can’t help but feel that he has not once felt more like he was never meant to be anywhere else.
Sherlock stopped for a minute. He was standing in the middle of the room, and with the cup and saucer in his hands, he looked like he was waiting for a guest who had long left his restaurant. A little bit beaten, his hair tussled, his eyes light blue. What had he done while John had been sleeping? Probably scouring more newspapers and old case files, running through a few calculations and pulling on his hair all night.
"What does my brother want from you?"
"Am I right to assume that you know where Scotland Yard is located?"
"One of the mad ones, aren't you? What, you just ride with a stranger 'cos someone told you to? You one of that sort?"
"John, I need you," doesn't even care about how desperate he sounds. "I need you in my mouth, can I?"
"They will have to do without music for now. Strengthens the group dynamics." And she gave him a wink and a wicked little grin.
stag night? There wasn't really anyone else involved.) The vision that crosses his mind's eye is blurry and wobbly, a drunk man's memory.
They both handed their coats to someone who took coats, and a moment later they were inside. John forgot where he was for a second. It looked like a different building entirely, decorated and filled with high society dressed expensively and extravagantly. The chairs and tables had been put aside to make room for dancing and above them there was a giant chandelier with strings of jewellery hanging down, slowly revolving around itself and scattering raindrops of light over the room through its reflection. John turned to look over to Sherlock. Then the room stood still.
Once the brain was was in place, he waited. For anything, a sign from the universe maybe, or an instruction from the other Sherlock, an insult even, telling him he was an idiot for believing this would work. But neither of the Sherlocks would make a move. He remembered Sherlock's story. When he told him of his decision to die. The thought calmed him like nothing ever had before. Now he could make his own decision. So he, too, decided to die.
. Where do you believe she got it from?"
On the call of his name, Wiggins took a step forward. "The vamps are streaming into the city like salmons down the river. Acting like animals at night, but right now they're silent. Won't take 'em long to press forward, though. Ah, my news, ser. It's 'bout the Queen."
His subconscious appeared to have decided for him. There was no turning back now.
"Yes." Now John was watching her too, jumping around and seemingly telling the stories of her adventures.
"Where is Molly Hooper?" Sherlock asked.
"Too human for a vampyre and too much of a monster to be part of our world. Forever caught in between two forces. And he has found a way to take revenge on both of them. Become a consultant, expert in murdering people on behalf of more cowardly men, then use the corpses to build a robot army, and use the army to fight what he knew was coming. A vampyre invasion. I regret to say this but, in a way, it is rather brilliant."
It was to be expected. Even under hopeless circumstances, the man remained obsessed.
"Sorry, sorry." John draws back a bit, and in the next second he can feel one of his hands on each cheek again, stroking them with his thumbs in little circles. "Are you alright?"
"It's poisonous," he said.
"Er, th-thank you," he murmured.
She should never have dared to address a man with such slander and such boldness. Mary Morstan, however, did not appear to care much about what people thought. The remorse she showed through the hands that immediately flew to her mouth was obviously an act. "I'm sorry, I meant
He has become rather good at reading his face, might not be as brilliant as Sherlock is, but he can at least claim proudly that he is good at
"Surprisingly okay."
) and that night Sherlock Holmes dreams of the solar system, starry skies, the sun and the moon, and shooting stars, burning him up like a firework that he knows is so beautiful that it could be the last thing he would want to see before he dies. But hopefully, he doesn't have to yet.
With the sudden movements of a wild animal, James Moriarty's head turned quickly, his eyes scanning the room.
"Oh. Excuse me, sir, but I cannot recall a Dr Watson being one of Ms Adler's assigned doctors. As you will understand, without further assurance I will have to ask you to leave, I'm afraid. Good day."
Another realisation made its way through his head. Something new. Important, exciting. He took the glass from John's grip before he could protest and placed it on the tray of a waiter passing by. Instead of a new glass, he offered John his own hand. He still looked utterly confused (and a little tipsy). Sherlock cleared his throat without needing to.
He took one deep breath. "I will offer you a secret of Sherlock Holmes."
see?" John whispered.
"Yes, yes, of course, we’ll inform you when we’ve solved it. Good day." He tries to shut the door in front of his face, and Alex raises his voice for John to hear him, "Bye, John, was very nice to meet you," but John only sees his hand awkwardly waving over Sherlock’s head.
"Erm..." John didn't know what to say to this. He didn't know what he was still doing here. How was he even supposed to feel? Disappointed now? Scared? Should he have fainted? But all he could feel was mild embarrassment. "It was certainly an impressive trick, so yes. Extraordinary."
John felt a bit ridiculed, and he could not help but think that he was being used. But of course he was, what else had he expected? They were nothing more than strangers that have met under the weirdest of circumstances, and this Sherlock Holmes did not look like someone who would waste a chance like this. He had gotten up and rummaged around in the shelves, only to pull out a small test tube with a liquid inside that was lilac in colour.
"Oh, did she?"
"I wouldn't usually come here myself. But I had to know if it was you, brother mine."
John did as he asked and grinned to himself, remembering how they quoted him in the newspaper article. Sherlock was quite good at dramatising. Had Mrs Hudson mentioned that?
Now he was only waiting for a sign. Sitting on his bed he was barely able to keep his feet still as he expected something tremendous to happen. The sign of
John and Sherlock exchanged a glance. John nodded, assuring him it would be fine. Sherlock pressed his lips together, telling him he wasn't happy about this but he would comply if he must.
John lets go of his hand and just frowns at him for a moment, grinning a bit, because he is used to Sherlock being a little ... random. Grinning about himself still not being able to follow his train of thoughts. For Sherlock, on the other hand, that reaction is rather disturbing.
"Sherlock..." He pressed his hand to his mouth. How could anyone bear this weight? He felt crushed. Putting his life into the hands of another person was the hardest thing to ask. And yet, Sherlock Holmes was asking him.
"And now," he breathed into his ear, but John didn't feel a tingling of breath.
His mind slowed down. He didn't understand. That was Sherlock's voice, so close, so deep, but...
The effect this has on Sherlock is probably not what John has been hoping for. He stiffens as he feels the panic return that makes his lips tremble with the thoughts and the knowledge that
"Oh, really?" Sherlock tilted his head in mockery. "You thought I would simply abandon you, now that I got what I wanted? Whatever stories you might have heard of me, Doctor, I assure you I may not be a man of honour, but I am at least a man of logic. It would be highly illogical to send you away after I've seen of what you are capable. No, I won't let you go that easily."
They ended up pressed back to back, panting and shooting. Above them, the stars shone bright and clear out of the midnight blue ceiling of the night sky. Distantly, John could see beyond the next target and the muzzle of his gun. He saw Moriarty fist-fighting one vampyre after the other, blood dripping from his whole face and mouth. The fireworks had stopped, but the smoke was still hovering like a thick fog. Noise, screams, everywhere, but there was one distinct sound suddenly cancelling out everything else. John could hear it loud and clear but he didn’t see, yet it sounded like ... bloody hell, where did this
A few minutes later the tension in the room alleviated, to John's relief, and left both of them in an environment shaped by foreignness. However she played it, it had to feel odd to have strange men, including John himself, be sent to her house to watch over her as if she was a treasure that could be made worthless by injury.
She spoke in soft tones, but her voice was off. A layer of a second, a lower voice had embraced her throat and made it sound like two or three people speaking at once. The result was a creepy choir of sing-sang quiet, very quiet chanting.
"This is everything we were trying to prevend from happening," he stated quietly.
"Running off without telling your friends. Abandoning people. That's something you do?"
John quirked a brow at him, this kind of easy communication needing no words. Sherlock waved him off. Talking to him about generosity where modesty would be the more appropriate term. He took a sip from his wine glass and was well aware of Sherlock watching him. His thoughts were hidden behind his poker face. He might be imagining the taste of the drink on his own tongue or he might be deducing how long it has taken John to pick the suit he was wearing.
Sherlock smiled at that but not without a twinge of sadness in his eyes. "Looks like I am not the only one in need of you."
has the potential to give John exactly what he didn't know he needed but now finds himself hoping and craving for.
"You're a doctor, John. You should be capable of saying-“ but then he realises that as he tries to come up with a word for it, to say it out loud and have it hang here in the space between them, his mouth stands still. The mocking but loving smile is wiped off his face again, and his open lips form the gap he is feeling between his heart and mind.

) The detective's ability to
"I doubt that, Dr Watson. He made it a habit of seeing and hearing as little of me as possible, even when he wasn't in hiding, which I
"Oh, a doctor?" she playfully asked. John recognised that kind of tone. A bit puzzled at this himself, he was only now starting to look at Sally as a rather attractive woman who was, potentially, flirting with him. But just as he opened his mouth to respond in kind, he heard someone repeating his name behind his back.
"Do you never read any newspapers?"
"Pardon me my impatience, Dr Watson, but I have to see to something. It won't be take me
"It's just… I couldn’t stop seeing it, John. His eyes on you. The looks he gave you, with the eyelashes and the blue eyes. How his voice softens and deepens when he talks to you, all politely as if to impress you. And then, my mind went further, imagining you two together, and- ugh, it’s terrible! How can people stand this?"
Before John could protest, he became aware of the fact that he was holding an eye within his palm. It felt different from what he had expected. Neither slimey nor too squidgy. Not that he, as a medical man, had never touched an eye before. He shot a glance at the eye he had seen earlier – the one that was swimming around in the dirty glass on the shelf – and it was looking back at him
"Tea?" she asked, having already brought the tray and the hot brew, and she pattered into the kitchen.
"May I have this dance?" he asked again, now inches from his face.
"Who knows? But I am positive we will find out soon enough."
John probably sees what he wants to see, and there might be truth in his suggestion - that his friend has just been caught off in the middle of a sentence he had not bothered vocalising. And curious as John was, he naturally started thinking about it for a moment. The things Sherlock would be likely saying.
begins, with one psychopath meeting his equal and pulling everyone around him into massive destruction! At this point, there is nothing that tells me all of where we are now did not happen because of you!"
"Dance with me."
He holds onto him like he was the rest of his life (he hopes he can be) and he has no idea how it happens, but somehow they fall asleep just as they are (sticky, disgusting,
The louder he is, the more it turns Sherlock on, regrowing arousal making him moan. It hits him like the head of John's cock hits the back of his mouth that he is really in his
"Alright," he said, taking one slice of bread from the basket. He could not remember the last time he had eaten that much food – or even the last time he had eaten anything at all! But the next time he spoke he tried to do so before taking the next bite, not wanting Sherlock to mock him for his manners. On the other hand, Sherlock and manners...
body. My heart. I- I need it."
"Enough of this nonsense! Hang him already!"
John cleared his throat roughly and pursed his lips as he calculated. Was she expecting him to be frightened of Moriarty as well? Or was she just testing him, trying to provoke the opposite? She was impossible to read, and he licked his lips as he realised he could probably only lose if he tried to play the game of lies and bluffs with her. So he decided he would not even start it.
"So do you-"
"John?" He asks dumbfolded, as if he would have expected someone else entirely.
"Sorry, sir, I don't think I could possibly do that for you."
"I mean you shouldn't have to soothe me every time I don't seem okay."
With a bit of reluctance, he took a deep breath and rolled his shoulder like he was preparing for battle. Well, it was a battle of sorts. A battle of the unknown that would lie behind those walls. An entry of flat stairs led up to the big front door, and John walked up to knock and announce his arrival. His fingers tightened around the metallic handle of the door knocker; a black snake that wrapped its tail around the handle. The figure eyed him with suspicion and its tongue stuck out and mimicked the unspoken message it spread.
There were a strange five metres of distance between them. No one moved. Sholto's sharp intake of breath signalled the world that it could spin again, the clocks could tick again and with them, a conversation that should never take place was just beginning.
Mrs Hudson gave a quick laugh, but John could not place it. Had he mispronounced the name and she was mocking him for it? Or had something else shown on his face?
Pure electricity sparks up the length of his body, creeps underneath his skin and stops to leave a hunger that takes place right below his stomach, shoots upwards to meet the heart. John kisses him again, almost without touching him at all, and the soft sensation kills him. He spreads his legs even wider and his robe cannot hide anything anymore, especially not after the belt falls open.
like the sound of drums, or a roaring
Pleasure pools in his lap, and he is harder than he can remember ever having been before, his skin so sensitive from the harsh material of John's jeans. He feels this strong urge building up inside him, leading him to think about ripping John's trousers off to feel his throbbing erection against his own, and
"Wanna try again?"
"Are you two coming?"
"Let the lady speak, Mycroft, I know you are not very good at that," Sherlock told him.
that John thought. It was strange because he wished that people would understand, but they did not. He really thought he was behaving obviously possessive or in awe or, well,
Gaze following the path over strained nipples –
"Rest well, everyone." General Midnight broke the silence. "Tomorrow will be a long, long day."
"Well, an object could be lit or even moved, surely. But it would never be alive, would it?"
Sherlock, being there, right in front of him in the door frame on his knees. He also realises that he is now in the perfect position to kick him in his pretty face. Sherlock's voice sounds unusually thin and breakable as he says those next words.
It's his body he cannot believe. His actual, naked body that is above him, so close, and he not only feels but sees him breathing. The chest rising and falling. While, in the darkness of the room and the pale moonlight shining through half closed curtains, his skin appears in mostly blue shades, his chest and face melt more into fading purple colours – flushed. Hints of John's arousal.
"Dr Watson? You fell asleep?" Sarah gave a disbelieving laugh, and then immediately looked apologetic.
John was confused as he walked him backwards until the back of his knees hit the sofa.
He can't stand this, he can't comprehend this, and there is no way on earth that he could deserve this.
She had to be burning internally, burning up with the desire to hurt him, kill him for what he had done. It was an act she mastered so well that John was almost willing to forget. And if she comforted him in the illusion that even her smile was innocent, she had to be truly dangerous.
Sherlock and John turned their heads around to look out of the window panes. Another huge ship had docked! Even though the process of that could have been a gentler one. They quickly walked up the stairs and rushed out, and for a moment John was so taken aback by finding himself in the clouds, breathing the air that was so fresh and thin as they were so far up in the sky. From so close a distance, the other airship was gigantic. A bridge was being lowered to connect to their own ship. Only a few minutes later, a man with grey hair and tanned skin was stepping out to cross it, and behind him all the people Sherlock had denoted family. Oh, and Anderson.
"When I found Victor, I knew that he was dead. There were wires in and outside of him, machines surrounding him. But he was not moving. He was not going to move ever again. James Moriarty killed my only friend."
Sherlock's eyes dropped to his hands, but his mind was elsewhere. And suddenly, John knew exactly what had happened.
up in all these years. John thinks it matters. This man is influencing him
Someone recognised them and helped them get to their seats. They had been arranged for them and they sat down with polite smiles in the last row of a stand for the privileged. John didn't feel privileged. It should never be considered a privilege to get a better view of people dying. So many people had come to Tower Hill on this cloudy day in late-autumn; people from all classes and ages, guards in their uniforms, old ladies in their corsets and children with holes in their shoes. Everybody wanted to see a vampyre hang.
, when he hears John (brave, kind, wise) chuckle above him once more.
"Yes," he caught him off. “Me too … Me too."
John likes to pretend he doesn’t like it. His body betrays him in that regard. All the blood his brain could’ve used to apply common sense to this runs south, pooling between his legs where long lovely fingers do what they do so expertly. But it’s not only this alone that makes his flesh harden so quickly, makes his eyes roll back in his head as Sherlock’s fingers hook into the elastic of his waistband. It’s the constant awareness that what they are doing is so scandalous, so forbidden, that creates the bittersweet thrill just beneath his skin, his nerves on alert. His cock springs free, and he feels goosebumps running over the skin of his thighs. What follows now is (
He was absolutely dashing tonight. He wore black suit trousers, tightly and tailored, matching with his black jacket, which he fell over a dark green silken waistcoat, and a white neckcloth. Just
"Oh good," Sherlock said, turning away from him. "I was really worried." As he rolled his eyes behind Anderson's back, John turned his head away to hide a grin.
Suddenly, Rosie starts to wiggle in Sherlock’s arms. She stretches both her arms out as far as she can, reaching for John in desperate attempts. "No!"
Sherlock’s warm torso presses against his back, and he can feel hard muscle through two thin layers of clothing. His cold nose tickles the skin behind his ear. Sherlock takes a long breath, takes in John’s body, smelling him and reducing his racing thoughts to simple words, to thoughts of comfort, of softness, of homecoming. John feels how his limbs lose the tension that conserves the masses of energy that Sherlock forces himself to bear at all times. For now he is giving himself a rest.
"Ehm, Sherlock-"
The sand was hot beneath his feet. His shoes were heavy, separating his body from the fire. It all burned. When he tried to look past the sun, he saw the world drowning in flames behind his eyes. Dried blood clung to his hands, his uniform, painted across his face in sprinkles. None of the blood was his own. He was lucky. He could hear his sister’s voice speaking to him in moments like this. She had never wanted him to do this. All she had wanted was peace.
"What?" John shouted from up on the horse, frowning. "Are you telling me the Great Sherlock Holmes is afraid of horses?"
John Watson, the one with great potential and a future that did not look like a tedious tragedy. John really wished he could see that, too, could feel like that again and be naive and young. But most unfortunately, he knew he was not
The anger that has slowly begun to build up inside of him now gets replaced by another feeling that makes his heart beat faster and a warmth raising up his neck until it reaches his face. John is
"James Moriarty. Pleased to meet you."
him. And Sherlock hasn't seen him. It hurts, physically, and right now more than ever. It breaks down on him, like the piano on a cartoon character, that he could be anywhere right now and wouldn't know, that this could be anybody there, he wouldn't know. The greatest fool, believing everything his mind tells him to. It has happened often enough. The possibility is still not eliminated, after all.
"You think he would have liked me?"
" ... Thank you."
naked and how did he get here?
"Sherlock," he gasps out in a rough voice. It travels down Sherlock's spine to the base of it, makes the muscles in his thighs jerk and his legs fall open further.
He had found the matchbox and lit one match in a quick hand movement. Sparks sprayed and a flame illuminated Lestrade's face. His grey hairs turned golden and flickered as he held the cigar between fingers and lips and tried to light it.
Moriarty had entered the stage. He was watching over the crowd with a sly smile carved into his face. He had something to him, something so unmistakably dark that it could hardly be ignored, nor should it be. It challenged you to look at it directly. The first to look away was the first one to lose. He watched over everyone. He would find Sherlock. The mask he wore was like golden metal. It was pure mockery to those who knew what it meant. A robotic half-mask of gold and silver and bronze. The mask of a cyborg.
Once entered, John had to admit that Scotland Yard did not look all that special on the inside. Floor, ceiling, door frames and most of the furniture was wooden, the walls were painted in a dirty yellow, which appeared even dirtier in the shallow light the blinds let through. There was a potted palm tree in the corner, and the walls that were not covered in posters and pictures of missing people were decorated by framed portraits of Queen Victoria and other renowned personalities. For a moment, he thought about looking through the posters and see if Sherlock's face would appear somewhere between them, but there was no time for this. (He would see Sherlock again soon enough.) He walked over to the reception where a young man in uniform gave him a polite smile and asked, "How can I help you, sir?"
"Leave it. Just... leave it. There is only so much that is holding me back from ripping your head off and kicking it from this ship."
He held the ear up now, close to his mouth. "Going to Scotland Yard now." Already feeling ridiculous enough, he almost bit his tongue to cut off the
It would always start so innocently. From the moment you caught yourself laughing off the inner tension and sharing it with someone else, exchanging honest smiles more and more often. The soft, lively fondness that gleamed in their eyes, should you only caught their glance at the right time. This was special, this was irreplaceable. A moment never found anywhere else in the world. But a comrade could die in a heartbeat. You swore to yourself you wouldn't take your eyes off them, you would have their back, but when you turn around they would be gone. It didn't matter then, that you didn't know their stories, their backgrounds. It hurt, and should you learn about them afterwards from families and friends at their funeral or from letters that spoke of tragic loss, it only ever fed the pain.
There is something in the way he walks, and this is about as much as Sherlock is capable of taking in and making sense of at all, that is not quite the usual kind of walk and one of his inner voices (the one responsible for the blood streaming in his lower regions, perhaps?) whispers to him that this was also his fault.
to him.
– up to the flexing muscles of his upper arms, and there, on the left shoulder – crushed skin, marked by the wound that has brought him into his life. It raked around his skin as far as it would come, creating the form of something reminding him of a star. Sherlock could only describe it as beautiful.
There had never been someone more deserving of being called
He stopped clapping. Everyone else stopped with him.
Suddenly Donovan spoke up from where she sat. "This is
He eyed Magnussen critically and was now glad that he didn't.
"That’s it, I’m gonna google it."
"Where are the others?" John shouted.
John thought, pursing his lips in the attempt of not calling him out on his stupidity. "You do know," he started anyways, "that there were women in armour where I come from, fighting with me side by side? A lot of those attitudes have changed already."
(And not bloody at all.)
But Sherlock waved him away.
Don't want to call you in the night time, don't want to give you all my pieces. Nor hand you all my trouble, or give you all my demons. Oh trust me, there be demons. In here, these walls. This 'palace', in which I hide away while you have to watch me struggle from several rooms away. But tonight I need you to stay.
What does John think he's doing?
"Two damned souls," Sherlock commented. There was remorse in his tone.
"Let me go."
"This is the very difference between me and a machine, for the soul is the obvious and unique medium. And if the soul exists, does it not go hand in hand with the heart? So with a heart separated from soul, what am I?"
"Hey!" one of them cried.
"We cannot do that alone, of course," Sherlock added.
John nodded again. It had just hit him how mad the story sounded. A crow, a Moriarty spy, a sudden chase through a gallery. But Sherlock and him had seen far crazier things. He seemed to believe him. That did not change the fact that John was losing his head a little, and then it all came out at once.
Behind him, he could hear Donovan and when he looked over his shoulder, he saw her talking to another higher ranking knight, discussing battle plans. He had no idea how she ever got here, became a police officer in this time and place and had her talents be recognised enough to do undercover work and picked up useful knowledge of military operations somewhere on the way, but they should be more than glad to have her on their side in a time such as this.
"Oh, really?" Sherlock quirked a brow. "I could have sworn that you did."
He had turned them over, so he would be the one to hit the ground first. He couldn't be sure, of course, but John was rather surprised by how grateful he suddenly felt for having been saved. Now lying practically on top of Sherlock, he looked up at his face. What he saw there should not have made him panic as much as it did. Sherlock's temple was covered in –
The room felt like it was underwater. Dead silent, and pressure of the masses weighing them down. Every sound was hollow. They would drown down here, and Mycroft Holmes, desperate for air, would do anything to live. The question was: Would Sherlock?
, he thought.
John opened his mouth instinctively without knowing what to reply to this. But he didn't have to. She was retreating already, her flashing gaze was being adjusted to false kindness and her gown had fallen open further. John looked away.
The hand in his hair disappears, and Sherlock is just about to complain as John is putting his arm around his shoulder to hold him closer.
"I'm also ... very hungry ..." John is talking between kisses, "... and you will eat, too ... because I made this ... and I'll make you feel guilty if you don't."
. Of course, there is a lot more to being human than owning a functioning brain. Good Lord, are there many who possess the organ only for the echoes in their heads to not deafen their inner ears! But would you not say that your theory made any form of medical treatment just as wrong, just as unethical?" The colour in his eyes went from clouded grey to roaring blue, gleaming somehow, despite the mild light of an almost set sun. "I told you to think about it, did I not? Now, consider it – really consider it! What is so unhuman about it is the ability to
"A snake?” John wondered out loud. “Isn't she rather..." He thought about her hundred pairs of eyes, about her body sacking to the floor and releasing one giant swarm of animals that were definitely not snakes. "...you know, a spider?"
"Who are you?" she hissed, hissed her words at him like a snake. "You don't belong here. You are an invader, an impudence! You must know that by now, do you not?"
"Yes, please."
Sherlock was behind him, shooting another vampyre that was trying to enter through the broken window. There were shots all around him as the woman who had just burst through the door and her troop of ten knights kept shooting the creatures.
nicely?"
John stared at Sherlock instead. "What now?"
John thinks he has finally found what he was searching for, but realises too late that he is not alone within the dark halls of the basement. There seems to be no way to escape what he is forced to face, and it will not only change his path, not only his perception of the world around him, but perhaps the story of a stolen heart can change his heart as well.
He heard him,
. The word spins round and round all over again before his inner eye and it makes him feel sick. He miscalculated and his instincts have failed him. Like they do these days, whenever John is close to him. He even was selfish enough to insist on John, wanting to get him out of his dull almost-married everyday life to spend time with him. If Sherlock was going to feel bad and horrible for making such a mistake, John is not allowed to feel the same. He deserves to feel better. Otherwise, most of his own suffering would have no use at all.
"What you're thinking I am thinking or what you are thinking also?"
John nodded. It might even be that his ex-commander had killed some of them with his own hands.
Sherlock has never cared much about the solar system before.
Before John had even processed everything Sherlock had just said, an answer had already slipped from between his lips. "Alright. Yes, why not?" He blinked a few times and there was another question rising up. "But how-"
Sherlock Holmes and his dramatic entrances.
"Hold on."
They had reached the end of the street in a slow pace that kept the world from spinning too fast. Still, the world of their thoughts appeared to be revolving around a somewhat mad and fireball-like persona. Maybe Sherlock Holmes was using witchcraft too, after all, to be stuck in the minds of those who meet him and stay there.
"I almost didn't-" She began anew, looking him up and down. From the top of his perfect curls, all the way over the green waistcoat and the long tailcoat down to expensive, shiny boots.
“It wasn’t that simple,” said John.
"Bedroom?" John breathes into his neck.
"Does this doctor fellow have anything to do with this? Does he know more?" Lestrade asked, and the others followed his example by now asking wild questions about John while talking directly over his head.
could easily belong to anyone. Why would he be known in a place like this? It was just a dirty pub and no one was supposed to know him here.
They both started giggling. Her smile was the first to fade when she looked down at the newspaper in his hands, and he felt his fingers tightening around the edges protectively. The headline of the article seemed to do something to her, and John would have assumed it was similar to his own reaction. But as her eyes softened and the fine smile on her lips wavered, he knew there had to be more to it.
hanging onto this reply like an ad banner onto a plane. "I already solved it."
He looked at himself in the mirror.
. Simply want. He's scared by the intensity of this feeling.
Sherlock stripped the fake beard from his face and threw it on the seat, followed by the wig on his head and, last but not least, the crooked nose.
"Well." That brought an end to their afternoon of just the two of them. Sherlock let go of John while his eyes told the story of what he wanted to do instead. But the little smile on his face gave the promise of a later.
John hesitated. "I- Erm. Absinthe, please."
He should have known this genius knew nothing about modern art. "Ah, not important."
"Well," he walked over to his rightful chair and sat down. "Shall we?"
"Me?"
, he had also not missed to remark) and was more or less willing to listen to what this consulting detective had to offer him.
"Only just back from whatever dark hole you jumped into again, and already back to mistreating yourself. Have you eaten anything today?"
"Alright," he said as he rejoined him. "Let's go."
John ran towards Sherlock, offering him a hand up. "Are you alright?"
"He is a very wealthy and well-deemed expert on exotic poison."
Moriarty did not seem to mind a lot. "I am the owner of everything you can see within these halls." He spread his arms, and also the cane, using it to increase the impression that it gave, to demonstrate the widths of his ownership. "It was a very ugly theatre once, and I renovated, redecorated. However, long story short, Dr Watson. Accidents do happen."
He was standing on the stage, clearly enjoying all that attention from his employees. They were listening now, after his outbreak. (He had this habit of turning absolutely monstrous). His pet was by his side, loyal and broad-shouldered like his fallen guardian angel.
... that's as close to admitting he doesn't know it better for once as it will ever get, possibly.
"Been evacuated. Just outta the city. Location unknown."
"I will make you a new one."
"It’s cat videos, John. They don’t talk. I cannot talk over them because they don’t-"
"Look," John says, and he almost whispers, "Sherlock, I just- I'm just not sure where you are right now, and I know you can be confusing sometimes, but are you- is that about a case? Is Mary a client or a murderer or is she …someone you want to forget?"
"I didn't know you did not," said Sherlock as he stood up and off the ground and put the papers on his chair.
The next day, after almost having overslept thanks to the outrageously delicious wine from the previous night and the nightmare-free hours of sleep, John finally found enough courage to quit his job. Especially Sarah Sawyer was disappointed to hear of his decision. It came to such a surprise, she said, for John had seemed to have grown rather passionate about it, if a little bit tired, over the past few days in particular.
"Yes, yes, very funny. I would’ve solved it sooner, but his idiocy gave me a headache and I needed to clear the room off him." Sherlock is making this sound as though their client was a cloud of industrial smog.
There isn't enough oxygen in the room for his brain to keep on functioning, or so he feels, and he is sure what he is feeling right now is neither rage nor relief but the threatening signs of a panic attack. Sherlock stretches his hand out to reach for him, maybe to catch him if he fell, and it requires all the strength still left in his body to not slam it away.
There was the twinge of a thrill rushing through him from head to toe, making a stop around his chest and pressing there tightly. For a moment he could not breathe, for relief made it hard for him to swallow. Sherlock Holmes, the genius (he had seen what he was capable of, as well) wanted to see him again. Not abandoned yet.
"Yes!" In an act of desperation, John took one of Sherlock's hands, and he could not help but feel proud at surprising the detective. Sherlock looked at him with widened eyes but made no move to escape his grip. "I believe in you. I believe that I know you, genuinely, and that what you have shown to me was real. You feel so real to me, Sherlock Holmes. I wouldn't care if the whole world despised you and told me to keep my distance."
John looked up at her, and finished securing the bandage around her foot blindly while he held the other hand out to her. "Sometimes I just go by John. Nice to meet you."
Watson. I have to disappoint you. We don't approve of small talk and other tiresome activities in this house. Even if it is quite sweet of you to want to distract me."
John was supporting almost all of Sherlock's weight as he was hurrying them through the chambers. He wondered briefly if Sherlock knew this place better than he did. He remembered the patterns of the black stones, the artificial light of the shark tank, the flat faces watching. He remembered the glow from the room in which Magnussen had met his end, whatever that meant for the man. And he just wondered, not that it mattered, if Sherlock had seen all of this before. He did not care but he forced himself to think about anything, anything else, and so he kept on wondering. If he had worked here, so close and yet far away from Baker Street, against his will. Or maybe not entirely against his will. He knew that there were times where he had wanted to die.
"It was me who taught him the practice of witchcraft. You have to understand, he promised me things. This isn't me justifying my actions, this is me explaining them. There was enough money in it that it made no sense for me to keep my own business. Soon I was owning a house, and not long after I got to know Kate. Suddenly I had things to lose." Her eyes turned to Sherlock, and there was an emotion in them that met its equal. "We're so vulnerable when we have things to fight for, are we not?"
wouldn't be able to recognise the importance of matters at hand, and I shall be proven right."
"Hmmh, thinking," Sherlock mumbles as a first response, still a bit put off by his sleep-craving body and mind.
"Right. And when she saw my gun she didn't say anything, which makes a little more sense, looking back on it now..."
"You should have said so earlier."
His head turned to John, and John was feeling somewhat caught in the act. Sherlock's blue eyes were intense, and he gulped down the feeling of being flustered by this. His voice even seemed to have dropped a few octaves at his next words.
"And what do I say to him?"
His gaze drops to the floor then, so that he doesn’t see how Rosie pulls John back into the room by the fabric of his jeans, stumbling back in Sherlock’s direction, and he doesn’t see John warming up again. He doesn’t see it until he hears it, hears his whole-hearted laugh. With wide eyes, Sherlock's head turns sharply to look at him.
John shook his head in denial. "No. Stop this. We can..."
"Sorry about Tom," he said, not being sorry at all.
when John takes charge, in fact, is utterly turned on whenever he does so. It is a weapon John has learned to put to use. He was, after all, Captain John Watson, served in the army for Queen and Country, and Sherlock is
He runs his fingers farther up his skin, spreading his legs a bit as he leans down. Sherlock is still naked if it wouldn't be for the dressing gown, but that damn thing still makes him feel as if John can see everything of him, and it just feels as though John is touching every bit of him, as well. His legs fall open by themselves, and he has to grab the edges of the chair to hold himself upright.
He hugs Sherlock tighter, and the atmosphere switches from steamy to sensual, but it's nice. Sherlock feels warm and protected and
“Alright, you know what? It’s you. Okay? It’s your fault! You just make me so angry all the time. No, don’t- don’t look at me like that.”
"Hi," John whispers.
"Alright, out now! Out! No time to lose, I need to think."
"You cannot even fathom all the things you do not know about," he said, making it sound like a threat. He was probably good at threatening people. Well, with John he would have to put in a little more effort.
"You are not one of her regulars.
"I thought about you, you know? When I was lying in bed. Could barely fall asleep."
“I see posh boy’s being a lazy butthead again…”
"Two days from now," John said.
Sherlock caught up to walk next to him and they crossed the road. He had taken the two-sided hat from the back seat and pulled it down over his forehead. The cabman outfit fell uncommonly over his lean body. That thick brown coat and the old washed-out scarf didn't look like him at all. Which was exactly what Sherlock wanted.
And maybe John was wrong. Maybe the way Sherlock Holmes looks right now, right in this moment, all blissed out, boneless and smiling, the pure happiness rolling off him like waves, illuminated in early sunlight, hair ruffled and crinkles around his eyes that have fallen shut - maybe that could be, by far, the most beautiful thing that he has ever seen. And he will never be able to unsee it.
John shook his head and chuckled.
When Sherlock opened his eyes and they found his own, he saw something else in them. Something new. He wanted to kiss him right then and there. It was oh-so-tempting, with him bent over him, pressed to him, thigh around him, open lips only inches from his face. Sherlock's expression had lost its focus, dream-like eyes wandering to John's mouth and blinking slowly. Then his head dropped to the side.
"Why now?" he breathed.
A few people stepped aside like they had somehow rehearsed this beforehand, and from in between the little group emerged … Mrs Hudson! John's face decided to join Sherlock's widening eyes. (They made quite the pair now, looking like that.) First Jane, uh, Janine, and now Mrs Hudson! Who else was in on this conspiracy? And, more importantly, did John want to be a part of that? That had to be almost out of question. If sweet, innocent Mrs Hudson was here, the brave knight in rusty armor could stay, too.
Sherlock nodded. "Not fully a vampyre. That I would have noticed, inspector. The signs were all there. No family, never eats, hardly sleeps. But I ... For too long I ceased to believe in such a creature. I saw it and I ignored the illogical, ignored that whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
"We're not open this early," she explained, as she probably mistook his look for confusion. "Come on. Let's go in." John, more or less voluntarily, had to follow.
"You don't care about that."
"I mean, there certainly is a lot to appreciate in here. This is a very nice house."
things.”
Sherlock can't do anything, not one thing at all but close his eyes and suck in a sharp breath when John presses his clothed chest against Sherlock's flushed skin, and suddenly he has two hands full of his lovely bottom and
John just has to get used to this new side of Sherlock, is all. The sentimental, the careful, the
. Just … John."
So they were really in it together now. John had not only been a means to an end for Sherlock. Or maybe he had been, in the beginning, but something had changed the detective's mind.
in German, Petrarchan sonnets in Italian,
"Are you a guard?" John asked, even though the man didn't look the part. But why else would he be on the other side and John behind bars?
"I know because-" Mycroft took his hand in his own and demanded with his eyes that he looked at him. "You mean the whole world to me, Sherlock. And your loss broke my heart."
They both turned to the door in surprise, and John smirked – actually smirked! – when he saw Bill Wiggins standing in the door frame. He had no idea why or how, but right now he only had to know one thing. Turning back to look at him, he saw the previously so intimidating man covering his face with the palm of his hand as if utterly done with the world.
"Her name... was Eurus."
Silence goes on from there.
"My, my, one leaves you alone for about an hour..." Mary greeted them mockingly and her lips curved into a grin. She visibly enjoyed their delighted expressions as they looked down at them.
you're asking me to-" John wanted to shout, but Sherlock stole his thunder, not asking,
"Depends," said Sherlock, "Do you have your gun on you?"
"So you
Sherlock takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. When he opens them again, there is courage in the one and fear in the other.
His legs are already trembling from either the lack of touches and friction where he wants it the most, or from the overload of sensations he is currently exposed to. He feels like a stranded creature suffering from amnesia, so that it doesn't know if it will die from the water in its lungs and the inability to breathe enough air or if it has to crawl back into the ocean and to breathe underwater. He doesn't know what to do with his hands anymore, constantly switching between pulling on John's shirt and running up and down the bare skin of his back and raking his fingers through short hair. John seems to enjoy both equally, and Sherlock can't stop to trace and file away the different reactions. He tries to concentrate on this now, to distract himself from the aching and yet untouched erection between his legs.
A young man raised his voice from a corner of the room. His face suggested at least one week without any sleep (or full of unpleasant habits), and he spoke in some kind of London accent that was in any case associated with
God. And he can still smell him. Ridiculous actually, but his senses tell him John has been in here earlier, and the thought makes him almost dizzy. He always told himself he was, with all his heart and soul, a rationalist. But this uncontrollable body urges are on their best way of taking over him. All his shields seem to be down. Leaving him weak and defenceless. Suddenly, he gets very angry with himself. Which is also an emotion. A never ending circle.
"John, get up!"
He looked up as she was leaving his Christian name at the end of her denial of a threat, which, mind you, sounded fairly threatening. He could not recall when they should have passed over to those terms. She was leaning over the table, so her face was closer to his and the mischievous twinkling had reappeared in the light of her blue eyes.
Their hands did not let go of each other, even as John looked up and searched his eyes with a hard look that was blue steel. He tried to lock his mind to prevent the detective from somehow reading it again. "I'll do
"This isn't the end," he said. "Moriarty must know someone is after him."
They are trying to figure out how to braid Rosie's hair, and Sherlock (since he has deleted braiding a while ago) suggested a video tutorial. Turns out John is terrible at those.
"Sherlock Holmes," John breathes, his voice not more than a thick whisper. "You never swear."
John sighed deeply, frustration and suppressed panic both going into it. Of course, there had to be a why, there had to be a reason for him to help John. As if they weren't both used by the same evil mastermind. But business criminals never changed, he supposed.
They exchanged a long stare. John's glaring eyes hopefully told the man all he needed to know about what he had wanted to do to him. But Moriarty's eyes met his through a broken mask. He saw a little boy. He saw young Sherlock staring back. Shaking his head, he swallowed it all down for another day. There was no time to lose.
"Ah, there you are. Most of the team aren't there yet. But you can still go through, if you like."
"Did you hear the screams through the night?" Sherlock asked quietly.
He can only barely open his mouth until John invades his personal space, still grinning smugly, getting Sherlock to lose his voice (which in itself is something to get admired for, to be honest) and tilts his head a little.
His grip is strong, too eager almost, and he starts stroking with shaking fingers while the other arm is pressed against the wall to hold himself upright. With each stroke something electrifying is striking down his spine, making him lose his mind, but it is not enough. John is there again, so close in his head and has yet left him alone to resolve this problem. In his imagination John is sinking to his knees now, gently taking Sherlock's hand and putting it away from himself. He is humming, pushing his face against Sherlock's hip, and it's getting too much already.
"Of course not," he says, the word
Sherlock obviously had to bite his tongue at her comment but kept going somewhat sulkily. "As I was trying to say, it might be very hard to believe just how evil a mind he possesses. What he is planning to do goes against every good thought that can be born, every good will of nature, why, against the very concept of a God. Every evidence suggests that James Moriarty wants to control his very own army of cyborgs."
She brought the flower closer to her face and inhaled deeply. "What do you think, Kate? He misses me so desperately already? Cannot be without?"
There wouldn't have been enough time to object, so John buried his anxiety with the knowledge that this boy was his servant and therefore of lower prestige than himself. Even though he was beautiful, and beauty, he had learned, was always shameful to be wasted for the Englishmen. The waiter took his hat and jacket and left him to a table by the window, a little off from all the rest of tonight's baggage. He promised that a bottle of wine would be on the way. There was still no sign of Sherlock.
"Hmh," Sherlock agreed without looking up. "More like every night. Booked out for weeks in advance sometimes."
Relief, relief, his whole body feels lighter, his heart having lost one big thorn. For long minutes they just lie there and breathe together, smiling like the perfect couple of idiots they are. Sherlock listens to the beating of John's heart only inches away from him, calculating the beats per minute and thinking about nothing else at all.
His brain hurts. Not his head, no, he is ninety one percent sure that it actually must be his brain that hurts him, and he can feel it through the walls of that thick head of his.
"I am." Sherlock's response was as dramatic and mysterious as the man himself.
"-because if we are to work together, you and I and everyone else I have met tonight, I need you to promise this."
The girl reminded him of Harry a little, and he felt the presence of this hole in his chest where he ought to miss her. Harry, the little annoying sister who would never let him play with her toys. And in a way that equalled their relationship as it was today at least partially. He knew she also lived in London now. But London was big enough to avoid her at all costs.
She winked at him, and John felt a grin parting his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
They each let out a sigh of contentment.
"Look, I'm sorry I just left your side. Shouldn't have done that, I know. But you looked like you still had... fun." He tried for a smile. Didn't go so well.
He turned around to face her, and she looked to the left and to the right. "Has he run off already?"
Sherlock had disappeared behind the corner, and as John followed him he was astounded that the rooms were even bigger than he had expected. The living room led to a kitchen, or at least it looked like the vague idea of a kitchen, with tumblers, test tubes, rakes and flasks all over it. It reminded him a lot of what he had seen within the shelves of Irene's basement, only with slightly less disturbing contents. Although … were these
"Here, take Silverblaze." The General offered her leash.
"Language, little brother."
"Do I know-"
He nodded towards John. "Our Doctor here has said the injury was surgical. If we assume that this, meaning consulted murder, is how Moriarty earns most of his money – and there is clear evidence that this is what he did before The Professor – then someone must have paid him to assassinate Woodbridge. So the questions is why would someone want to see a middle-aged, dull, slightly overweight guard in a museum cut in half? Why if he didn't know something he was not supposed to know? The lost Vermeer painting provides the missing link."
"I wonder what had her so upset," John joked.
"John, I am so sorry-"
"Yes. This is what I do." He repeated, and took another sip of wine. It ran down his throat and left a somewhat bitter taste with a hint of fruit, subtly rising to his head and made it lighter. Made his smiles even less rare, kept him from hiding it so often. Made his eyes shine brighter.
A suspiciously familiar voice. Of course, he reacted to his own name by default, but he knew that a name as common as
," he knows he sounds so desperate as he is feeling the first drips of pre-cum smearing against the silk of his pants. God, he needs to get them off. He's so hot, how hasn't that bothered him until now? John's hips move forward again and-
"Oh please, God."
John. To feel his muscular thighs between his own, feel his hands run up his back, the back of his neck, into his hair, and down again. Yes, all so perfect. But there is one thought – one annoyingly persistent thought – that just won't stop pulling strings in the back of his mind, bringing him down to earth when he only wants to be in John Heaven.
"Oh, a handful of people. Me, a few others and... James Moriarty."
. When the hand around his throat disappeared, John sank into the dirt, back rubbing against the brick wall, holding his own neck like it might just break if he didn't.
"Caring is not an advantage," he answered coldly.
John turned his head, too, and suddenly he understood.
He could practically hear Lestrade rolling his eyes next to him.
The boy handed him a telegram and ran off as soon as he had come and to wherever he had come from. John looked after him in wonder. He could not recall having seen him here before. Shaking his head, he held the piece of paper up to read it.
"Sherlock! Would you shut your goddamn mouth for a minute and
, he wants to see it. His cock twitches heavily just from imagining it.
His eyes were hit by the glowing red light. His heart seemed to have expanded in his chest with each,
It looked like the inside of a church. Maybe it was. Maybe they did pray here. Seating rows to the left and right made of red wood, ceiling high and adorned with paintings of angels. The windows wore colourful patterns that the sunlight threw across the tiles. At the end of the room, one man stood tall, watching Jesus Christ on his cross as if it were only a matter of time until he would free himself and come back to life.
They woke up very late in the morning, at noon almost, and spent an inappropriate long amount of time just looking at each other. Softly first (and Sherlock found the ocean in John's eyes again.
"What investigations?" Anderson hissed, but someone elbowed him in the side and he shut up.
“Something happened to you, John. What happened to you after he fell?”
But enough of this now, he told himself, shaking his head. This was not about him, and such thoughts were inappropriate for a lot of reasons and in a lot of ways. These weren't his real hands, not his own fingers, and he had to remind himself of this. These were the same hands that could transform themselves into loaded revolvers, the same arms he could simply unscrew whenever he pleased, and the stunningly blue eyes the same he could just take out and place into John's palm if he found it useful. This was not a man at all. It was nothing more than a gracile illusion.
"Meets with our neighbour Mrs Turner every morning to have breakfast and …
"Wiggins and my Irregulars will look out for criminal activity around London, since the police is known to be too slow when it comes to important work, and report to me whatever arises suspicion." From the corner of his eye John could see Lestrade rolling his eyes.
The whole room stood as still as John's heartbeat. He felt, distantly, how Sherlock wrapped his leg around his own waist, holding on and pressing against him, close, so close.
John is not quite sure what to do and starts looking at him a little perplexedly. "My … what exactly? What are you on about?"
John could feel the excitement quietly tingling under his skin. He felt him wherever they touched, where they connected and his body was warm.
"Sherlock, now! You're dying."
"I mean, can't say I didn't expect that, but…"
And he hasn't even taken into consideration what he has felt in there. All those impressions of him and John doing all those … things. His head is spinning with confusion and clouded with the scent of Army Doctor.
"The way you hold yourself speaks for years of training in a knighthood – this is a fighting posture you stand in, defensive – your first reaction was to look for a weapon, so experience in battle. Still, you did not dare to grab for something to defend yourself, or even pick up the torch on the floor, because you could not be certain keeping an eye off the shadows was a good idea. Trained eyes, therefore, also used to dangers that hide in the dark, dangers of agile and deadly nature. You have enough confidence and trust in your own abilities to not try to run away. No, instead you were calculating the right moment to attack. Your bravery and obvious experience told me it could not have been the
Sherlock's eyes dropped down and he was studying the table's surface absently. "Funny," he said, not amused at all. "I think that the idea that you have implanted in me has broken me. Never to care about anything at all. I was taught to be this way since I was a child. Now the inside matches the outside."
"John!"
His abs are still clearly visible, although it is also clear that he isn't exercising anymore (most married men don't do that anymore, so he heard), his lower stomach indicates a little bit of pudge. Just below his navel grows a lightly golden line of hair, disappearing somewhere between his hipbones into the area only hidden by a white towel.
Sherlock has always seen himself as someone who is very in control of a situation. He has to be. He has trained himself to be for decades, and it was hard work and led to a very lonely life at times. When he met John, he was scared at first. Or worried, rather. More and more often he felt himself slipping out of this carefully constructed bubble of self-defence and cold logic. He found himself laughing with John.
. This was something else indeed. Something else that was happening to him. Here, in the basement of this strange lady. Today, on behalf of the professor everyone else feared. And still, he had not cared. Blindly, ignorantly had he followed his addiction without arriving anywhere, and now, now for the first time, he found himself speechless. Moved. Absolutely stripped of anything he thought was left of him these days, simply by this man's words that contained his own former glory. It was not only about being read. It was also about being
John clenched hands to fists. "You will have much more to lose if you put that plan of yours into operation."
"I'm Sally, by the way."
"Wonderful! I have to say, I never doubted you for a second, my boy!" he spoke to him in varying tones, all of them too over the never-to-be-reached top because this man did not seem to know what limits were. He continued. "In that case, I'd say that Mr Sebastian Moran here, and I, are ready to see you in my study. So that we can discuss what will now happen to you..."
." Sherlock repeated that word as if its very concept was something he was unfamiliar with and suspicious of.
Molly mounted the horse they had come with, and Moriarty was behind her with his hands cuffed to the saddle. The last thing they needed was the man getting stupid ideas from too much freedom. This time, Sherlock had no more strength to mind the horse and he let himself fall against John on Silverblaze.
how is this real?) pressing against his body's entrance. He's shivering all over, but he barely notices. His observation skills have narrowed down to one man and one man alone. The temptation to just reach for him and pull him towards and inside of him is almost irresistible but, technically, he has never done this before. Even though he remembers, distantly, somewhere in the back of his mind, that they should've done this a thousand times by now, technically, he knows he has no experience. But he isn't nervous anymore. John is here. John will guide him.
"Must be hard living on the streets. London's a dirty place in so many ways."
"No worries, Inspector. 'Tis alright you 'aven't invited me."
"Oh no." He shook his head with a mocking smile that spoke of how he wished that only this would be the case.
"Pray, tell me about your relationship with Sherlock Holmes." This time he did not ask but demand.
He was just about to give up hope, undress again and go to bed early when, as he was hanging his jacket over the nearest chair, he noticed something on his desk he couldn't remember putting there.
There are more wrinkles now, the bags under his eyes are deeper, the grey strands have long dominated the blond ones. His face looks more worn, his jaw stronger and his eyes harder from all the battles fought, from all the hate and sorrow he swallowed. Sherlock loves his face probably more than ever now, as much as it makes him sad, and as much as it completely flashes him right now.
"So why won't you tell your own team then?"
A sweet pain struck the area around John’s ribcage. Only too familiar. "I can."
He would have given this up. All of this. And he has. He knows now that John's decision to get married is none of his concern, and that a friend would help out as best as he could. His casewall had last been abused for sorting out seating arrangements and choices of food.
It was not as if John had wanted to stay longer, but rather that he was tired of being shoved around and told what to do by people like Mycroft Holmes. He had served to follow orders, but he was a civilian now. He chose who he wanted to follow. There was one and only one consulting detective who he belonged to, and he needed him now. He needed to see him, to speak to him, to make him explain. But first and foremost, he needed to know that he was okay.
He told the final part of the story in a low voice. "I built this body. It was the golden thread drawing through my whole life, it was the accomplishment I couldn't help but crave for. He forced me to finish the work we had started, but when he threatened to make me into the first one of my kind … In that moment I saw him through the lens of a scientist. I saw the opportunity to truly overcome death.
She did not. "One of
"Oh, don't concern yourself with high society's short-minded folk that gathers here, Doctor. I picked this spot for a reason. No need to bother oneself with more people than strictly necessary."
"Sherlock?"
John's mouth fell wide open. Not knowing what to say he only blinked up at this odd, intimidating person that took his breath away.
, he thought.
A second later, Sherlock had disarmed John, pulled him up for all to see and pressed the gun to his head.
John's turn to look away and smile to himself. Sherlock was too beautiful not to look at, so he was forced to look at anything but him. His thick curls, his eyes that displayed so much to live for, his porcelain skin. The light of the sparkling chandeliers paired with the danger of his smiles allowed him to be sinfully divine.
. He remembers having once thought Sherlock Holmes was like a drug to him. Well, look at his replacement now. This isn't even ironically funny anymore.
He doesn't want soothing. But he does. Oh, how he does. And needs.
His mouth uttered the three words before his common sense caught up, but now that they were out there, he never wanted to take them back. It felt so right to him to say it. He wanted to hear himself say them again, knowing Sherlock could hear him. His body shivered at the thought.
The elder Holmes pushed his chair back and stood tall behind his table. He reached down for the glass of brown liquor and began pouring himself two fingers of it. "I'm afraid we have not been able to find enough evidence to come to either of the definite conclusions. Any...
"You read his mind?" John asked in astonishment. He could not begin to imagine the experience.
Took me a bit longer this time. But it's a long chapter, and I hope you like it!
time. But not the first."
John held his strong grip around the bar and took small steps backwards. He was the knight, the protector of Sherlock's lifeless human body. He was prepared to fight the witch with everything he had. She raised her arm and he swallowed, convinced she would try to cast a spell on him or do whatever she had done to Magnussen. But she didn't. Instead, she slowly approached him like one would to soothe a frightened animal.
"I thought you were dead."
come from?!
A loud noise echoed in their ears as the glass cracked around the bullet hole and split into a thousand little pieces. Gunsmoke was swirling upwards from where his hand had been replaced by the revolver. The spiders looked unimpressed, one of them even jumped and tried to ram their fangs into John's leg, but John kicked it and sent it flying across the room.
He realised that he was still running. Stopping abruptly and taking a proper look around, he found that his body had carried him, entirely by itself, to the street opposite the building with the green sign and the golden letters.
, had he needed a moment like this to lift some of the tension that he was carrying with him for far too long.
John started to become fairly suspicious. After all, there had to be a reason for this stranger to know so much about him. (Maybe he was really reading his mind.) There had to be a reason for him to know of the Order, or for him to be hidden away in the cellar of this mansion. Could it be that he was also himself a monster, tricking him into thinking he was cleverer than that, something else than that?
But sometimes (especially after the difficult cases, the hopeless ones that take all day and night) they don’t go to bed separately. Sherlock becomes so enormously needy then, his body craving and yearning for all the things that he has previously neglected. There is a lot of snogging in those nights, a lot of groping and hard pulling on clothes in inappropriate places (apologies to Mrs Hudson who just wanted to bring out the trash and did not have to see this), but too often Sherlock’s lids will grow too heavy to keep them open, or his limbs will become too weak to remember the signals his brain has given them. (Once this ended with John having a curly-haired detective fall asleep in his lap with his jeans half-opened; an adoring but frustrating sight.)
The hole in his chest had only widened, screws and framework exposed. Sherlock, despite all the odds, was smiling. It was no happy smile.
Which means that it has always been this expression. That maybe, just maybe...
Sherlock rose up from his seat in an instant. "Superb! Masks, disguises, mystery – it's just what we need."
"Then this must be for you, sir."
John smiled back. "Promise.”.
Something in him shuddered at the name. "So you are working with him?"
"Our biggest advantage is that Adler doesn't know of you and me as a unit. That is a benefactor in strategy," Sherlock stated as if it wasn't news at all. "I believe you know something about poison?"
. His engine was running slower and slower. Groaning and huffing and with weakening muscles, John fell to his knees in front of the glass tube that glowed blue in the dark, helping Sherlock to lie down on his back before him. He looked over, and there he was.
"Yes, Wiggins told me my brother found you."
Clearing his throat, he remembered to bid her welcome, and he quickly crossed the room to offer a hand. She mirrored him and stepped forward. Her long red coat swirled around her legs. He felt patterned lace within his palm as they shook hands, and her big, blue eyes were fixated on his.
"Holmes?" Lestrade said quietly.
"Irene knows the way. Let her go with us, let Lestrade take care of him."
alright?"
But what he can see in the sky is more than a little unexpected. There are stars up there, yes, millions of stars he would usually never notice. Without John he would never care.
Feeling his world turn a little, all John could do for the moment was blink. A million questions came up, about this story, about Sherlock, and yet he asked something else.
"I was just too eager to have you."
Of course, he would never think of crying now. He isn't allowed to cry, never really has been.
. There, he said it. In his head, of course, never out loud. But Sherlock, with his many frustrating qualities, of which many are outrageously attractive to John, is practically forcing him to feel provoked. Those feelings then lead to … petnames, apparently. He’s had stranger coping mechanisms before.
John has trouble breathing, has trouble telling his heart to not combust behind his ribcage.
"So what is the plan now?" John asked the Adler woman. "Do you know any of their strategies in taking over the city?"
him. Recruited him. Sherlock has always liked to believe that he had been the one to pull John with him. Made him a part of his oh-so-exciting new world, full of mischief and mayhem. But in all those years it had always been John who grounded him, lighted up what used to be dark for so long, pulled him away from the edge when he was getting too close. And one time, there are suddenly signs of a lump in his throat while he thinks of it again, John has given him a reason to stand right on the edge, look down and jump.
He comes untouched with John's name on his lips until it's all just
Moriarty seemed to consider that. "No … He wouldn't, would he? He wouldn't know..." His eyes came back to them and his pupils flickered.
"I will waste my time trying to count every star of this night sky. But isn't it funny that I can't help but try?"
"Yes,
"Dr Watson." Sherlock Holmes offered him the hand that was still part of his body this time, and John shook it with his free one.
, when suddenly John appears right in front of him again. He grins down at him in mockery pride, and this face is still able to surprise Sherlock, almost as much as does the strong, deeply-settled look of affection in his eyes. "Look at you," he mumbles, just as Sherlock's Adam's apple bobs and his voice is yet again sandpaper. "Just say you want me to take you to bed now, Sherlock, and maybe I can still hold myself back for more than two seconds."
, as Sherlock would apparently put it (who would have thought?), much to Sherlock’s amusement and later delight at John taking drastic measures. (Rough and hot wall sex, for the most part.)
Not without the renewed fear that he was going to make a fool of himself, he hesitated. Sherlock's eyes bore right through him. The song was going to end. They both felt the end coming. Sherlock let go of John's hand in his, leading it to his neck instead. Sherlock's warm neck, just the tip of his curls brushing the back of John's head. His breath caught in his throat. Then Sherlock closed his eyes. Let himself fall.
And the red stretched over her teeth.
Sherlock Holmes left him with this, a smug expression and a wink.
"John Watson."
"Have you even worked with the police before? I thought you were a private detective."
"Uhm..." John forgot what he had wanted to say, a bit taken aback by the place Sherlock would probably call a home. He owned so much. And what did John have that he could really call his and mean it?
Sherlock's body was tense. Frustration was worn like a second skin. He had given up everything, all of him, and yet he was not able to quit all emotion.
John pretended to break free by hitting Sherlock in the face with his elbow. Although, he did so by actually hitting Sherlock in the face with his elbow.
"What? What do you mean? What version?"
Hearing John's sweet rumble next to his ear, the hot breath on his neck, followed by him biting his earlobe. Sherlock thinks the noise he just made might have been a little too loud and a little too high for him, but there is simply no time to be embarrassed, there is only time for him to swim on this wave of lust.
While they were here, Irene Adler was attending a meeting at the Diogenes Club. Since she had defeated (or devoured) the vampyre's initial queen, she had gained a rank of respect and authority over them. They were intelligent but they were still a huge pack, demanding a purpose in life and for someone to give that to them. The counting of their losses and the understanding of the Moriarty sibling's madness had made them see the world clearer. Irene was aiming to negotiate the terms of peace between the humans and the inhuman, hoping that one day they may live side by side. It would take time to eliminate the prejudices and let history be history, but they wanted to begin by tearing down the wall around the city piece by piece, stone by stone. But, as Mycroft had put it, the people still demanded that justice follow. James Moriarty had to be hanged from the gallows.
"This is my fault," he whispered.
John's question had given him the choice of either keeping this part of him to himself entirely or to tell him. Tell him everything. What made him like this. Hearing him refer to Moriarty as
just by going out on the streets of London. His routine was broken and soon something was going to happen. It should scare him more to be at such a loss, so out of control, and the absence of greater fear did not mean he trusted Mary. She painted a torn picture of herself. She was demanding and captivating, but right now, the only thing he could feel for the figure in his arms was compunction. For him to touch her and be so close to her while she hobbled along the pavement had to look like there was something else in between them than empty space, like they knew each other longer than half an hour.
He let himself be led out of the office, then out of the building and into a hansom cab next to Bill Wiggins.
and, especially in the last chapter, from Doyle himself. And yes, I admit to having been inspired by the first
"Hello," the deep, sensual voice said seductively and through lips curved in a red devious smile.
"But it is still a secret?"
John looked into his eyes, so full of the sky after a storm. He thought he knew enough to close the distance that was left between them. His heart threatened to fall out of his chest just for considering this. He was nervous, was feeling light-headed, out of his mind, but his fingers never trembled. Knees weak, he knew what this man did to him. He really thought he knew enough...
"I love you."
They were walking up to the door but stopped in front of it. From this close, John noticed that there was more to the colourful pattern in the stained-glass of the door than met the eye at first. It appeared to be a pair of tigers with their tails up in the air and their heads held up high and proud. They reminded him of the mocking version of what might be found in a church window. (He'd never made it through, but as far as he was concerned there were no tigers in the bible.) Mary knocked on this very window a few times and waited.
He opened the other eye again but still looked dangerous. Not monstrous at all, now that he knew who the man was, knew how this angular face moved and changed when he was smiling, but still... dangerous. John found he couldn't look away. And the longer he looked, the stronger he was feeling the thrill that was pumping hot blood through his restless body.
"Marvellous," he said. "Absolutely brilliant."
Lestrade clenched his hands into fists. "You gotta be bloody kidding me!"
Don't want to call you in the night time, don't want to give you all my pieces, don't want to hand you all my trouble, nor give you all my demons. No longer I can watch you struggle from several rooms away. Tonight, I'll get you. I need you to stay.
They didn't break eye contact once their eyes had found each other, and John could see the exact moment something clicked in Sherlock's hard-working brain. His eyes widened just a fraction and his lips parted to form the tiniest
"James Moriarty … He is your employer, right?"
"He is the Professor," Mary stated, a similar grin defining her features.
"You report?"
John smiled and he smiled back at him, and the roof was full of warm blood and corpses. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the small moment of peace. Only that it didn't sound like a horse at all. They looked down into the alley where the smoke had finally cleared. The city burned but through the flames emerged a different species. Metallic and blackened from the soot, they ran over several knight soldiers, just crushing their heads with hooves of steel. Then they came for their horses. They were headed by no other than James Moriarty. Moran was on the horse next to him, shooting vampyres with a shotgun.
Mrs Hudson cocked her head at him as there was a question forming in her eyes. "You really don't, do you?"
When John speaks, his voice is low, his voice is rough how Sherlock likes it and treasures it deep down in his mindpalace, his voice is soft, almost as if. As if there was a possibility that he does. Maybe he does. But it can't be. Yet he keeps going. He said,
Mrs Hudson shook her head in immediate objection. "No, dear."
"John Watson?" the man asked, with a voice that spoke of too much smoke in his lungs and too much whiskey that had passed his throat.
"Jesus!"
"Mr Stripes?" he asked, probably having it all figured out already.
he know now? Irene's explanation about his bag had been absolutely plausible to him. Ridiculing, even, for he had not thought of it himself.
"I did say that."
To John's relief, she fixed her gaze on the stage again before she spoke again. "Take Kitty, for example. Yes, she has been difficult from the start. Very petulant, and difficult to work with, I assure you. She is our newest, but dressages do normally not take as long." It was clearly meant as a joke and she herself laughed about it, but John still felt a sting.
"I am very sorry I made you wait so long. But dear Kate required immediate help, and the matter was of highest importance, and therefore impossible for me to ignore. But now, Dr Watson, I will guarantee you my fullest attention." She was smiling now, and John noticed she had also not only refreshed her lipstick but also replaced it with a darker red, almost purple tone. Once again he had almost forgotten about the ugly wound on her arm, and then he also remembered that he, never mind the oath he had sworn once, was not actually here to make her any better.
"This is not…"
he thought and mentally patted himself on the back for the more or less random choices he had made when choosing his clothes. This place still looked like he remembered it. Stone-paved, wooden frames and rusty-looking. The walls held a fair amount of pictures of former owners, some strange portraits, as well as paintings of airships and the London skyline. John could feel the heat in his jacket, so he peeled it off and swung it over his arm. He clenched his fists as he passed through the bunch of other inhabitants and service members with confidence, his chin up high. In all his years of serving in the knighthood, he had forgotten how to walk into a room and not carry a certain aura around himself. Out here, within this lot of feisty, drunken men, this might become a problem, but he didn't want to care about that tonight. He was here for the same, legitimate reason as everyone else, after all. To have a drink.
"Irene Adler," he said, opening his eyes to see him. "And you."
John used the time in which he was once again invisible to take a closer look at Mrs Hudson. She did not appear to be quite herself. He walked over to her and sat down.
"James Moriarty?"
He squinted at her. "Adler."
"Shhh, that's right. I wanna make you feel so good." He moves on, wet lips behind his ear. Sherlock can feel his fingers twitching underneath his head. The ache to touch himself, the

It sounded like everything John Watson had dreamed of.
Could be
The thin-haired man smiled a sly half-smile like he was pleased by John's impolite response.
"It's alright, dear. He won't notice your absence."
The ride in the cab felt oddly quiet. London that was passing by to the clattering rhythm of horseshoes. For the first time in the last twenty-four hours, he felt somewhat calm. Yet, there was still an itch in his fingers.
Sherlock's grey eyes were piercing and stern. "Make no mistake. You might think the enemy of your enemy is your friend. But once he defeated them, he would have no reason to stop. Once his knife has torn the skin of the limb he wanted so badly to remove, he would never retreat from cutting through all of it. That way he can pretend to be the only one capable of stitching it back together. He could lead two colliding worlds, caught in his web."
"Where are we going?" John asked perplexed.
cannot do that."
"Dr Watson, you are most interesting to me. How could I decline your generous offer?"
"Sherlock-"
“What?” he asks instead, going for a weak smile, “You don’t see yourself with a wife and children?”
"Come now, they're heading to the fountain."
"Good afternoon, sir. How can I help you?"
His nude body was pale as snow, seemed to be light as a feather, kept in place by wires coming out of his chest and vertebra. He was glowing in a blue light of like he was the ocean and the moon was caught on the room with him, making him glow. John did not understand it. The dark curls whirled around his head in slow motion. He looked stunningly beautiful, and John was pinned to the spot in shock and confusion and heartbreak. This wasn't

"Hold still, would you?"
Sherlock decides not to answer, because he doesn't know how, and to just let his head sink down to be held by John's shoulder. John immediately slides his fingers into his curls, and with short nails he strokes his sensitive scalp. Sherlock can hold himself back before he would start purring like a cat. They stay in this position for a while, his boyfriend (
Truth was, he loved dancing. He had always loved it.

war. If she is not our traitor, then she must be Moriarty's. She was in on it all. Knew it all.” Her eyes moved quickly over the wooden tabletop as if she was still putting all the pieces together. But she was smart. She already had. “She is the one leading the vampyre army, is she not? Please tell me I'm wrong."
"Are there a lot of people waiting?" he asked, getting up from his chair, for his back was already complaining, and stretched his arms to loosen his stiff muscles.
Body is betraying him, he realises whenever he shifts in his chair, and the material of his fine trousers has more and more trouble hiding the bulge that is undoubtedly straining against them.
Before John was given the chance to respond, Sally Donovan called for him.
"Of course!"
"For the ball," Mrs Hudson explained, but didn't explain further.
Not for the first time in this short last week, John Watson started to wonder if any of this was now his reality or if they had put him in a coma after being shot and he was still dreaming. As easy as it would be to tell oneself this, deep down he knew. His mind could never come up with this amount of madness and magic. This was not a dream.
Sherlock raised a brow and shrugged. "A little." Now even he could not repress a smile and John, obviously, joined in.
His face fell at this. He hated that she was right, but he could not deny it. Biting the insides of his mouth, he turned around to look back at the tank. "I'm not leaving him."
“Yes, Sherlock, come. Come for me, you’re so close. You’re so hot.”
He looked at Mrs Hudson with heavy eyes. They spoke of gratefulness, somewhere under the thick layer of apologies.
"The soul is in itself nothing more than a densely compressed bundle of energy. You see now why, if Moriarty has found a way to transfer a soul into a lifeless body, he will have no trouble controlling one from its core."
"It's okay," Sherlock assures him once more. He has already tried to tell him so a few days ago when John finally broke down.
) eyes were staring down at him intensily, and he, too, takes a deep breath. "Not. Dead," he finishes. They have always completed each other so perfectly.
Sherlock takes more and more of him back into his mouth, and John curses him internally with every swearword he has ever known.
Who knows, maybe we'll read again! (I have some more stories and no sense of subtle self-promotion. *awkwardly flies into the sun*)
Clearing his throat, he tore his gaze away from the other man and looked around the room.
"You say 'please' an awful lot today. So polite. Makes me kinda want to hear it again."
He walks over to join Rosie in front of the laptop. Sherlock rolls his eyes in utter adoration. Then he joins them, too.
"No, I am impatient with you specifically, and- oh, you still look so tense at all times! Swing your hips a little more, or do look like you actually enjoy being here! Jane manages it, too, frankly, it cannot be that difficult!"
He blindly reaches for John's face and presses their mouths together roughly, not quite meeting his lips, but he simply goes with it, kissing the corner of his mouth, his chin, the stubble on his cheeks, every now and then he has to stop for breathing and sighing loudly. He is blinded, absolutely blinded, just rolling his hips, pressing himself upwards, his eyes closed and his own mouth hanging open.
Now, as he looks at John's armchair in his mind's eye, it doesn't feel as empty. Behind it he can see the kitchen and the unlit hallway to his own bedroom. The bedroom John is currently sleeping in. For whichever odd reason he would do that, in this foreign world he has been sucked into. It should scare him more. Or fascinate him more, if anything. But all his thoughts were covered, clouded by a veil of the memories of one person's smile, one person's touch, one person's kiss. He could fall asleep to this. To the dreams of John all around him. Hands tucked underneath his chin, eyes closed, mind somewhere far away and yet so close to reality, he doesn't hear the slow steps over the quietly groaning floorboards that are slowly approaching him. He doesn't hear someone walking up behind his chair.
"So you're not one of his homeless irregulars or other?"
"As if that wasn't mutual."
"Just tell me," he whispered, tired of fighting her, tired of distrust, "did you know that I would come and find him? Is that why Moriarty sent me to you?"
He fished the ear out of his pocket and held it out for Sherlock to take back, which he immediately did, and soon he had as many ears as he had eyes and hands again.
"Ah."
"Quick, don't let him get away!" John cried.
"And I have known you to be a man with many things going over your head, Chief Inspector."
"No, I mean... I don't mean this," and he says that as if he knew what

Sherlock tilted his head. "You heard the man."
than Sherlock Holmes at this very moment. He stood there, in the doorframe. The light of mid-day hit him, and John's prior image of him twisted and rewrote itself. His dark brown curls were as wild as they were well-behaved enough to not fall into his stormy blue and gleaming eyes. His skin looked even paler, his clothes even more rummaged, but he looked, above all things, highly dangerous. His plush lips were a straight line, his focus solely on Irene's blemished body. It looked like there was a gun in his right hand, but at second glance he could see that the end of his hand
“What?” John’s heart is beating faster once more. He’s so tense.
"I didn't know you could dance," she said after a while.
She let out a sigh. The dark stone walls were oddly illuminated where they walked through, and soon he understood why. The hall opened into a large tunnel entirely made of glass. If John had not been feeling claustrophobic before, he was certainly feeling it now. The glass was keeping tons and tons of water secured behind its surface, casting them in an alien kind of blue light. He felt like his skin was cooling and a quick wave of goosebumps ran over his arms, up and under his rolled-up sleeves. Against the glass and in these masses of water, he saw movement. Floating flat faces and dead eyes, belonging to some of the greatest predators. Seeing them should be a privilege reserved for the vast territory of the open sea. Yet, here they were, swimming and twisting and turning above and around them.
He opened his teary eyes to see Moran on the ground with him, his face all red and eyes wide open. A huge, green snake had crawled up and around his neck and the legless animal, with all its strength and thick form, pressed the air out of his lungs. John was still too dizzy to feel anything, but when he came back to himself, he realised Moran was trying to reach the gun that lay an arm's length away. Before he could take it from him, the shot fell, piercing through the reptile's skin. It went limp in silent pain and Moran breathed.
, he thought. But he could keep that little secret to himself.
Maybe he should be more worried or averse to the way she looked at him. But instead he felt a thrill rushing through his bones. He wanted to hear her out at all costs. So he swallowed and waited for her to go on.
In his mind, John is stroking him slowly, frustratingly slowly, and his other hand is reaching in between Sherlock's cheeks. His whole back is pressed against the wall and the warm water almost doesn't get to him at all anymore, but he has long stopped feeling cold. John finds his perineum without any effort, as if he knew his body like it was his own (because, in reality, these are Sherlock's own fingers, but by now he is too caught up in sensation to notice anymore) and begins to carefully press his forefinger up into the hole.
Sherlock's eyes still lingered on him a little longer before he made a dramatic gesture with his hand and the silver chain of the pocket watch in his waistcoat swung with the motion. "Finally! I began to wonder if your stomach had started to digest itself and killed you in your sleep."
"I understand that you have reason to be angry-"
"Get away, Sherlock!"
"Do you believe that he is?" John asked carefully.
John couldn't deny the little twinge of jealousy he felt at the sight of that. Was that his wife? He had never spoken a word of her before. But one look at Sherlock's pained expression, a clear sign of discomfort, told him that no, this didn't look like a man reunited with his significant other. Although he couldn't tell if the face he was making wasn't also due to her calling him alive when he himself knew that this wasn't quite true.
It was a fine place. The ceiling was high and decorated with paintings of angels and harps and flutes. The walls were made to look like ruby-coloured silk, the floor was tiled like a chessboard. The room they had first entered was exhibiting a set of Greek statues and lots of smaller paintings. Once Sherlock spoke again, his voice was low and respectfully quiet. He pointed towards a sculpture showing two figures.
The music had stopped. The song was over. Laughter and a single compiled sound of murmur refilled the room. Molly's breathing was heavier and her heart rate had increased. Sherlock, obviously, remained unaffected. Without a heart, without blood pumping through his veins, he was always fully functional.
Sherlock sits in his proclaimed chair in his thinking position for hours and hours straight. John has gone to bed a long time ago. He has walked off and made his way into Sherlock's bedroom as if it was the most normal thing in the world. As if he has done it a thousand times already. It is simply frustrating not to know what is going on around him. He feels knocked out. The ground has been taken apart from underneath his feet, and now he is falling and falling, caught inside this endless loop of nonsense.
He shot one last glance at him, over his shoulder. "Good luck, Doctor."
Sherlock obeys willingly. There are only few occasions in which John is in charge, where his word becomes the command, where he gets to say what to do next. But when it comes to sex, Sherlock is ready to give him everything. And John is more than willing to take it all. Sherlock
"Of course!“ Lestrade's rising temper turned up the volume and the strength of his voice. "Of course I'd be expected to do bad police work, give out case files to complete strangers, because it was so bloody likely that The Great Sherlock Holmes had it all worked out, sending out men who he apparently trusts more than his closest friends! Of course I should've known you would just take some time off, return from the depths of God knows wherever you've been-"
John gives him a smile that tells the story of how much he does not want to go out there himself, and he bends down to kiss both of the blushing cheeks.
In this moment of distraction, Charles Augustus Magnussen sprang to action. He came running towards him and reached for the crowbar to rip it from John's grip. John, caught by surprise, let go of his only weapon. He was prepared to fight him, but Magnussen, the coward, was already running away. He was his only way out, he could not let this happen! He still had so many questions, so many thoughts filling his head and spilling over.
"She is
"Is that something you worked on? Before?"
John was gaping.
Now he looked at him with a long intensity in his cloudy eyes like he was seeing something in him that had not been there before.
She arose, not only to her feet but in height, in presence. Her very soul arose and John could only look up to her growing frame. Everything was blurry.
John hums, seemingly pleased with himself, as Sherlock's head falls back and a low groan escapes his throat. The twinge in his lower stomach grows stronger, and the wanting has long stopped scaring him.
When Anderson's frustration took over his face, John had to look away to hide a grin from him.
John doesn’t hold anything back with him. He kisses him in every spot, he bites his lip and neck and,
This is the moment his senses activate again. First, a soft sort of humming in his ears, until he starts hearing again, and what he hears is the slow, wet slide of lips. Then the exchange of breath, of low sighs he later realises are his own.
Sherlock came over to him, taking his place in the middle of the room. He put a hand to his shoulder to lean in and say, "I'm going to take over from here." He watched Sherlock take the lead again, so at ease with all the eyes on him.
"You- you're." Breathe, John. Breathe, just breathe. "You're-"
"I know," John said, with the same smile he blamed on the wine. In fact, he blamed every word that continued to leave his mouth on that good Italian beverage.
Sherlock raises his head to look at him, tracing his laugh lines with his eyes. His own expression, on the contrary, is dead serious. He needs to get this right. "John. There is no way on earth I'm going to regret this in the morning."
"First of all, Lestrade." He stepped closer to the painting and pointed at the stars below the frame. "Alexander Woodbridge's wife mentioned that he was obsessed with astronomy. I believe you were there as well, but I could have overestimated your powers of paying attention to the words of a woman."
That's when his whole body suddenly startles, and he is wide awake.
"Your heart. But-" he stopped himself. But his heart was missing.
"You … bought me flowers."
Another quick smile. "Ah yes, the courageous knight. Courage is by far the kindest denotation for a fool, is it not?"
"Slamming the door in my face, you git? What is wrong with you?!" He saw through a filter of red rage and it made him want to shove him again for getting them into this situation in the first place. But the shrill voice drew his attention again. They had just broken into a bedroom.
