Sherlock looked like he was considering it as a more favourable option, but John was not going to pass up the opportunity to sleep in the tackiest hotel room in England. “You said there was an ensuite? With a bath?”
“Pardon, dear?” Mrs. Hudson said.
Sherlock closed his eyes in pleasure, and the sight was enough to make John’s heart swell. Then he remembered that he was not yet in the bath, and that he was the one who had taken a dunking in the pond, and that there was a tub full of naked consulting detective right in front of him.
,” Mycroft said.
He tilts his head back towards the sitting room, where John and Sherlock are standing awkwardly. “They’re – ahm – looking for my brother. My twin,” he says.
Survival was no longer as drastic an issue, and there was now a community present that all doted on Rosie (so few children had survived, and so those that had were revered). Rosie, after so long without contact with other children, chose to spend more and more time playing with them. Sherlock had to admit that she was improving the mental state of Georgie, who had apparently been found wandering alone and had been in a state of shock ever since. He was beginning to interact with Rosie, however, and Rosie herself was the subject of a great deal of admiration as a result.
The staleness of the room had nearly been choking him since day three, and he realized he had been looking forward to fresh air only when the door swung open and fresh air was completely and totally absent. The air outside was equally stale and still. Thick dust covered the sitting room of the flat, and shattered glass from the high window. When he saw the glass, he picked Rosie up and held her high in his arms.
“I’ve always had enough clients here. There’s not many Companions left anymore. You’ve been to Ariel?”
He turned; Sherlock was right behind him. The glassy look was still there, but a slightly amused smile broke through it. “May I?”
“Yes, sir. So Mr. Holmes insisted on leaving, and Detective Inspector Riggs insisted on the paperwork being completed first, and Mr. Holmes refused, and…”
Sherlock let out a long breath, feeling a little dizzy and sick. He became aware that Mrs. Hudson had entered quietly.
“He doesn’t like the glass,” Mycroft murmured, almost to himself.
,” Sherlock said, extended one foot in a point in front of him, then raising it to hip height.
“Yes.”
It hadn’t been hard to find a buyer for his and Mary’s old flat, once he’d gotten around to it. A young couple, their first flat together after uni. They were glowing with excitement and potential as they signed.
And now he was becoming the personal Companion to James Moriarty.
“Move, and I’ll mirror you.”
“Um. Well, you put your fingers in your ears-”
Sorry
“Those who would say so have no understanding of your true value,” Inara said. She accepted her tea from him, cupping her hands around the warmth of the cup. “And now you are the most renowned companion on Persephone.”
“No. Next.”
“Don’t scare me like that!”
“Well now, sir, you’ve caught me, and I suppose you know that I was here last night. I assume the squire’s dead?”
He crouched over Rosie. She looked up at him and smiled, her blue eyes so much like John’s. She raised her hand and squeezed his nose.
“I’ll think about it,” John said. “I was also thinking about the-”
“Tell me about him?” she said.
Sherlock nodded, biting his lip.
Holmes smiled and nodded small to Inspector Martin, who was standing with his mouth hanging open. But Holmes did not revel in his small victory, and pressed on. “Now, you said you were woken by a loud noise. Did you hear one report, or two?”
“I’m shattered, John.”
“And we all know how well that turned out,” Jen added.
“Fantastic,” John said, and Sherlock couldn’t see his face but he could hear him grinning. “Can I…”
John shrugged. “Once I realized it was the gas, I remembered to breathe differently. Shallow. They teach you that in boot camp, in case of a gas attack.”
Xiānshēng = Mister
JOHN: How do I turn it off?
“You’ll have to excuse – terribly sorry. We have a… guest that often comes here for, ah, independent study. His methods are, shall we say, unorthodox, and… He is a genius, no denying, but a bit… Well. Let me, ah, introduce you.”
Mycroft slid a small black box across the table. Sherlock sighed impatiently, opened it - and found himself speechless.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Horror and shock were sinking away, and John was beginning to think that there was more to this situation than he had thought. “What do you mean, ‘unexpected result’?”
. And this,” he bent his knees more fully, his arse nearly touching his heels, “
“You should have something to eat,” John said. “I understand you’ve had a concussion.”
“Langstaff’s an idiot for not leaving Persephone immediately, he got caught, and he’s boring now. What did you do after you left the NAF?”
Sherlock sighed, as though all the tension in his body was leaving him. “John. John.”
“Wouldn’t dare.”

Busy but still thinking. Phone tucked away but still obsessing. Kept thinking about what a great kisser he was, how his fingers felt against my waistband. What it would have happened if the flatmate hadn’t showed up.
He heard the splash of Sherlock getting in the tub. It wasn’t going to be a satisfying soak for him, John thought; he had noticed that the bath was shorter than the one at Baker Street, and there was no way Sherlock’s long body would fit in it. He got up and gave into his curiosity, peering through the crack of the slightly open door.
?’ –  but the man didn’t blink, and merely returned the handshake with a jovial smile. His hands were small but strong, and weathered with hard work. “John Watson.”
“Nice show for the vidders, don’t you think, Jim? The last Companion jumps to his death less than an hour after being with Jim Moriarty?”
One of the nurses standing by the bedside glanced at John, and he nodded. She carefully pulled the mask away from Sherlock’s face, allowing Sherlock’s voice to echo more clearly in the room.
Sherlock had crept into John and Rosie’s room at dawn, just as Rosie was starting to stir. He had allowed himself a single glance at John, sprawled across his bed, mouth slightly open, his brow unknotted and clear in sleep. Then he gathered Rosie up and took her downstairs before she could let loose her morning cry.
Sherlock’s mouth went dry. “Who is dead?” he said, giving up on speaking French.
Sherlock thought quickly. Giving away the fact that he was British would not be wise, and would lead to his identification quicker than he would like. Who should he pretend to be, from where? Not American, they were not well liked on the international stage right now. He cursed himself for not following world news more closely. Claiming to be French was dodgy, he couldn’t remember what the relationship was between France and Serbia. German? Also not certain. He certainly couldn’t pull off Japanese, and he wasn’t strong enough in the language anyway. Ah!
“He… he was married before.” He sounded stunned, as though he had suddenly had a massive paradigm shift in his life, and his boyfriend hadn’t even said ‘yes’ yet.
“No, I’m working the bombing case. I’m the lead, in fact. And Detective Lestrade came to us with a witness testimony that cleared our only suspect. When we questioned him about how he came to getting a witness testimony from the famous Sherlock Holmes, it came out that he’d been consulting with a Companion,” Dimmock sneered on the word, “on dozens of cases, without permission or notifying his superiors. Clearly bringing a civilian into New Alliance investigations is just slightly against the rules, so he’s on leave.” He smiled without mirth. “And what can I do for you?”
. But there was no answer there either.
In the end, it was easy. After some time, they saw a man sauntering up the road to the house, and he barely had set foot inside before Martin had the cuffs on him. John was glad to see the man surrender immediately, sitting sadly with his manacled hands dangling between his knees.
They stayed still for a moment, hardly breathing, hardly believing what was happening after all these years. John realized that he needed to say more, explain those years.
“Hm?” John’s head snapped up, to see Sherlock looking at him.
“What are you talking about?”
From his shuttered view of the floor between his feet, he sees John’s shoes. Cleaned but not highly polished; still spotted with sea salt from the boat; comfortable but not fashionable – John dressed prepared for activity, for a case unlike any other.
Sherlock’s eyes widened in surprise. John was fully dressed and standing on the far edge of the shower room, his plaid shirt and jeans sharply dark against the white tiles. Normally if anyone had intruded on Sherlock in the shower, he would have snapped at them, ordered them out. But now, he didn’t.
Sherlock said absently as he fiddled with the hem of his dressing gown.
!”  John said loudly.
“All right.”
, kicking the gun from her hand. It skittered into the shadows of the street, and he thought he heard a minute snapping sound from her hand. She cried out in rage and pain as Sherlock landed and ran into the night.
“I believe I do,” Sherlock said, as though he was surprised at himself.  He leaned back into John, his lips parted slightly. John let the tip of his tongue taste Sherlock’s mouth, delicately, and Sherlock made an equally delicate moan.
“In a tent?” Rosie said.
John released the button. “You sure?” he said.
. Why, thank you.”
The next thing Sherlock was cognizant of was clearly a few minutes later, and John was curled around Sherlock’s side, breathing hard against his neck, and his cock softening against Sherlock’s hip.
“I left film school because of their prudish attitude. There was no point in staying, just to be molded into their version of a filmmaker, their cookie cutter mentality. I’ve been working independently ever since.” He leans forward, conspiratorially. “I’m just in the final stages of setting up a meeting with Lars Von Trier.”
But as he worked, he found his thoughts wandering to Holmes, who now puffed on a pipe as he read. As much as he tried to focus on his work – first the Great Ormond Street Hospital in Bloomsbury, then up to the Liverpool Royal Infirmary in mid-February – his mind returned to Holmes’s words the previous day, his despite-all-odds accurate observation that John had been in Afghanistan. The fact that John wasn’t actually from Edinburgh wasn’t so surprising, as John was well aware of his limitations with accents, but Afghanistan! How could –
“Just a quick one. About my… my study. Of the morgues, you recall?”
What’s his name again? Matthew? Mark? Oh fuck, it’s Luke, isn’t it.
, when it ran aground off the coast of South Carolina. He had had the liver scared out of him at the sound of the cannons roaring at each across the expense of water between the two ships. He had briefly glanced Bonnet, the infamous pirate commander, as he was taken by the British. John had slipped away from the celebrations of the victors to a small cave east of the beach, and saw the glittering of the net opening, and emerged, sweating and bloody and filthy, back into Oxford in 2058.
“No,” Sherlock said as he batted John’s hand away. “It’s part of you, so it’s beautiful, you see?
“-but he weren’t happy because he weren’t Romeo. Had this idea in his head that it was the lead role or nothin’ else. Got so fixed about it he was willin’ to kill for it.”
“But she doesn’t,” Sherlock said.
“I want to hear about more about your work on the freighter,” Sherlock said as their laughter died down. “Your captain sounds fascinating – what was his name?”
“Leave? What do you mean? He was working the bombing case.”
Sherlock was clearly mollified by this, and sat back in his seat. “Tell us about the coin.”
Of course, this is Jim we're talking about, so warnings for him being creepy and discussions of non-con.
, which soothed the sharp corners of the piece.
“John?” Sherlock said. “All right?”
Sherlock’s eyes were wide, like a spooked horse. “I had to urinate until the moment I walked in here. Now I fear the urge will never hit me again.”
He could see Sherlock’s pulse racing in his carotid artery, see the flush on his cheeks. “I do,” he said in a near whisper.
“Then let’s look at platinum,” she said gently, as she steered him over to the counter.
“Who the
John patted his jacket pocket. “I’ve got a journal and pen here, but if I fill it up, they’re readily available in that era.”
Finally the Met arrived and took control of the scene, rounding up the last of the gang. Sherlock and John were cleared and went off in search of the nearest curry.
The nurse exited quickly, without even finishing with his blood pressure.
Okay.
“What are you doing?”
All avenues to get word back to England or his brother, cut off. “You can’t – you can’t,” he said.
beat out of him, I said to myself, ‘Well, a good fight would go down well too,’ and not one hour later I find myself breaking into the Poli-Station lookin’ for lost teeth.”
“I had been backed into a corner, and Moriarty was using my vulnerabilities against me. I felt there was only one solution open to me, and I took it. But I realized later, when I came back, that the ramifications were greater than I had ever anticipated – that I had forever broken your trust in me.”
He rose and went into his study, trying to bring his heart rate back down to normal. Papers, maps, notes still overwhelmed the room, and he wandered around, touching books and notes as he passed.
Sadness crept across John’s expression. “Yeah. He was meeting with our prime contact and they were both gunned down at the square in New Palace. I had to go to ground, and when I eventually stuck my nose out, I couldn’t track down any of my contacts. And I was so deep here I couldn’t reach anyone back home. I think MI6 assumed I had been killed, too. I couldn’t leave the country or they’d have been on me. I’ve been stuck here since.”
“Eileen was the one who-”
“No.”
“He has a watch, very proud of it, won it at a card game during the war. He thinks it’s a knock off. It isn’t.”
John couldn’t breathe for a moment. “But-”
“John – John – John -” Sherlock panted, and then there warm wet between them, Sherlock’s cock pulsing under John’s belly. John moaned at the new slickness sliding around his own cock, and thrust hard, one-two-three. Sherlock’s hands gripped at his arse, and then John was coming too, crying-laughing as Sherlock kissed his face all over.
, John.”
“No.”
Sherlock realized his eyes were damp, but when he got the courage to look up he saw that John was in a similar state.
Dobro jutro - Good morning
Three dots. Nothing. Three dots.
“Look,” Sherlock said as John came around to his side of the desk. “We were looking at the dentist as a common factor, but they were all different. But hygienists work in multiple offices, all over Persephone City.” He tapped the screen a few times. “See, there’s a list of the hygienists at the first victim’s dentist, and,” he opened another window, “the second, and…”
“Case?” I say. Totally confused now.
The vidder whistled again, and Sherlock’s eye flicked at the sight of the name of the incoming caller.

“Mr. Sigersen? How can I-”
Shǎqì = stupid, ridiculous
“Nonsense. It’s not as though I carry that amount of money on me. Moreover, I am not responsible for Wiggins’ debts.”
“That explains the strange dung smell,” Sherlock said. “Excellent!” He jumped in the air, pumping his fists as though his footie team had won, even though John knew he’d never seen  football in his life. “Let’s go to High Park, gentlemen.”
“He’s a very private person, I think he’d prefer-”
Sherlock woke after what felt like hours of sleep, more than he’d had since the bombing. He blinked, momentarily disoriented, at first wondering what the time was, then realized that time no longer mattered. He was in the Black.
“Fine,” Sherlock intoned blandly.
“Sure.”
“Choreograph something of your own. Or improvise. It would be getting a bit of your own back, in a small way.”
“Schwooz waller…”
Sherlock’s kisses had gained in confidence, and despite his best efforts to keep things from getting too intense, John found himself getting hard. Sherlock kept pressing them closer and closer together.. He distracted himself by weaving his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, disrupting the neatly combed style. His hair was surprisingly soft, a little slick with pomade. He had thought it was dark brown, but close up he could see auburn highlights.
Sherlock was no longer sure who was leading and who was following, but they were moving in sync. They weren’t precisely the same, but each moving in their own way, their own style. John’s movements were tight and loose limbed at the same time, and Sherlock’s held the long lines that had been trained into his body since childhood. Sherlock tried to adapt a more relaxed and natural flow from John, and he could see John altering his movements to increase his stride, lengthen his limbs in imitation of Sherlock. They were dancing, together, each borrowing from the other.
“There’s a spelling error, that’s all,” said John.
John bounced a little on the bed. “It’s still a bed, and a nice mattress at that. And look, it’s huge. It won’t be like that little cot you ended up with when we had that case in Edinburgh, remember?”
He raised his fists. He had a longer reach, even though they were the same height, but the other man outweighed him by at least fifteen kilos. There was the cosh to look out for as well. He circled, looking for an opening, while trying to get his back to the alley entrance; he could land a few solid punches and then make his escape. He darted in and connected a good right hook into the man’s solar plexus, and darted back – straight into a wall of muscle and bone.
“Quite sure,” John said, half-laughing.
“Clearly you do, Sherlock Holmes. You played me for a fool years ago, and you’re playing me for one now.”
He was examining a Grecian perfume bottle when he heard Holmes call softly, “Watson! Come here, look at this!”
“Stupid film. People hanging off the edges of buildings.”
“Yes, but that’s different.”
I own a café. I make sandwiches. All I know about knives is which end to pick it up with.
Inara had aged since Sherlock had last seen her, her body frail and thin and her face lined, but her hair was thick and pure white, cascading down her back, and her voice was still strong and girlish.
John hesitated, then grinned, and shook Sherlock’s hand.
“No, it’s just that…” Lestrade scratched the back of his neck. “Well, he’s not acting quite himself. I think.”
He found himself kneeling at Commissioner Yun’s side, not knowing how he got there. His hands fluttered uselessly over Yun’s body, knowing somehow that there was no point in checking his pulse.
“He’s the top Admiral with the New Alliance and he’s suffering from severe depression. His visits to you are the only thing that keeps him functioning. You don’t want a man with bottled up emotions in charge of our military, do you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh no you didn’t,” John snarled. Without hesitation or thought, he reached through the nunchuk’s radius, earning a hard whack on his wrist. Ignoring the sharp pain, he grabbed the intruder’s forearm and jerked back and then down. With his other hand he twisted the nunchuk free. He threw it blindly behind him, and a
. Anderson –
The man was portly and rosy cheeked, and if he was smiling, he would doubtless make an affable image. But he wasn’t smiling: rage was simmering under the glossy surface of Victorian etiquette. “Sherlock Holmes?” he said, looking between Holmes and John.
He took his bows to the rapturous applause of the audience. The stage manager brought a huge bouquet of flowers to Janina. She subtly looked at the card, and smiled rapturously at him. He smiled back, and brought her downstage to take another bow.
Sherlock puts his hand into John’s but does not yet pull on it to stand. “John.” He has to say this, but he is aware of every camera, in the room, in this prison. “We’ll talk too. All right?”
“Why do you call it a bedroom then, if there’s no bed?”
“We can deduce that those symbols stand for a letter that is repeated often. And what is the most
When Lestrade had more or less secured the scene, Sherlock escorted the Professor to a hovercar.
“… the baby,” John finished. “All true. Well reasoned, for a fellow who’d been recently shot.”
“Her nursery is doing a nativity this afternoon,” John said. “Sorry, Sherlock.”
He cleared a space about a metre in diameter as close as possible where the door to 221 Baker Street had been. There he collected another pile of small rocks, forming them into the figure of an arrow, pointing north to Regent’s Park.
Sherlock pointed to the high corners of the sitting room, then waved to the invisible audience. “Cameras. There, and there. You had better check your bedroom unless you want to put on a show for the security staff downstairs.”
Sherlock looked around, and saw that no one else seemed to want his attention at the moment. He made his way down the hall, tapped softly at a door and let himself in.
“According to this account, Wilde was offered multiple chances to leave for the continent before his trial and sentence; he refused.”
together,” her face shifting into a disgusted grimace,  “and I needed to up the stakes.”
Sherlock was still running his fingers over the scar. “It healed very cleanly. What kind of gun was it?”
JOHN: Yup. You’re doing great, love.
“You bastard, don’t you-”
“I’d like that.”
They both froze. This was a change in routine, and a change in routine was not good.
“Brother,” Mycroft said.
“There’s nothing like that smell, is there?” Jim said, his voice pitched low and quiet, as though the room demanded it. “I have a screenreader set up over there for newer books, but I’m very fond of the old format of reading. There’s a section here on history, and,” Jim crossed to another shelf, his excitement infectious, “here, here’s the science section – I’m very proud of this, look.”
Soon they were settled with a latte for John and an Americano for Sherlock. Sherlock sat for a moment in silence, fiddling with the handle of his cup.
John released him with a slurp and a teasing lick around the crown of his cock. “No, no, let me hear you, let me hear the sounds you make,” he said, then swallowed him down again.
“Of course I do.”
Sherlock danced for hours, focusing exclusively on the Goldberg Variation piece he had spoken of with Janina. He wondered if she was watching him live, or if they gave her a recording of his rehearsals afterwards. Part of the façade to maintain was that he genuinely planned to dance on Friday, when in fact he hoped that by then he would be on a plane back to England by then – with John beside him.
Sleep was hard to come.
“So I’m asking this as both your manager, and as someone who knows you well: What do you want? What are you going to do next? Of course we cancelled the Japan and China tour. And you’ve got the season at the Paris Opera in the fall, but say the word and-”
Sherlock’s jaw worked in frustration with a flush of embarrassment. “Elvis Presley. A Little Less Conversation. My father used to sing it to Mycroft and me when we were arguing about chores.”
“I think Juliet can be ruled out. She’s onstage almost as much as Romeo, and when she’s not onstage she’s looking over her lines. You can practically see the book in her head as she speaks. Friar Lawrence-”
John felt something huge and wonderful rise inside him like a bubble, and before he could stop himself, he let out a most un-Victorian snort of laughter. He turned his head away from Holmes, towards the window, to hide his face.
“Watson?” he whispered, harsh and low.
John’s first reaction was to be appalled at the ego on the man, until he realized that he was right – he did have questions. “How-?”
John’s face was pale, and shocked. He shook his head slowly, as though dazed, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s.
“And you fulfilled every prophecy of Ms Serra, and are more beautiful now than ever. It’s outrageous, it’s not fair.”
,” Mycroft’s voice went sharp, and the combination of his tone and the French language they had both grown up with brought Sherlock’s mind back like a slammed door. He straightened his back.
He kisses me on the cheek. “You’re really lovely,” he says, and I hear a car horn outside. “I’m sorry,” he says again, and he should really just get cards made up that say that.
“Can you get to the Embassy?”
“Yes. The authorities have already been alerted, and Moriarty will doubtless be in custody within the hour. You may safely return now.”
On the other hand, if this was a long term thing, well... he could seize the moment and just let himself go a bit.
“Nappy is fine. And you don’t smell hungry. Was it a nightmare, little Watson?”
“They’re back.”
Mycroft and his serpentine dragon with blue topaz scales appeared during breakfast. His brother had a book between his hands, and the dragon snaked through the air beside him. When he sat down, the dragon curled itself in his chair and poked its head above Mycroft’s, releasing a light cloud of smoke–smelling as the incense ‘Night Queen’–through the nostrils. Sherlock liked to play with Mycroft's dragon, although it also used to be quite ... despotic. However, what he loved most above all things, was sitting by the fireplace to read and having the dragon lying beside him, to smell the incense-like smell that floated around.
Hearing the violent growls of

“I already told you…”
John was glowing more now, a faint red light, instead of the clear, white one he used to be made of. The cobblestones around him were beginning to dry, puddles nearby exuding vapour as they evaporated. He could feel the heat radiating from John in constant waves. The static in the air was concentrating, begging to be oppressive. His head was hurting.
His voice was deep and there was a certain something, an almost musical sound, behind it. A reminder of other times, when his voice made stars wish they could cry. Now, it sounded almost bored. Bothered. Dispassionate.
John knew, that the look in Sherlock’s eyes would haunt his dreams.
“Go feed, John.”
Sherlock remembered all too well how it felt to be asphyxiated and fully convinced of dying, and he could honestly have lived without it. Culverton Smith had created a serum to kill vampires, after all. And his system was nearly flooded with it by the time John came to his rescue.
The first time that Jim wanted to see him was the day that the was captured.
See you soon!
was being blown up. The ship went down too quickly. Another pirate ship nearby came to offer support but by the time  they sank the attacking vessel, our ship was already destroyed and on its way down beneath the water. I can’t recall much except sinking under while my lungs burned for air, and the pain of a piece of wood lodged deep into my stomach. The next thing I remember was  the heat of the sun, sand everywhere, and a thirst I couldn’t explain. I killed all three of the vessel’s sailors that managed to survive and swim to the same islet where I rose. I fed from them until they died.”
“You. Made reservations. For us both.”
He saw John’s shoulders drop, as if relieved. He had not noticed how tense he had become. What was wrong with him? Had John fallen without him knowing about it? Had he been casted out?
And later, they became… more.
With his eyes fixed on the flames, he looked sleepy and tired. Younger. His muscles were soft and relaxed. John pulled him closer and dropped a kiss on the top of his head, burying his nose into the curls.
If Sherlock’s dead heart had been able to beat again, he knew it would be galloping. John said he loved him! It was something Sherlock had never thought he would hear said to him, and he never thought he would want so much to hear it.
“Sherlock.”
Even after John rose again as a vampire, this would remain an emotional moment he could not avoid. Sherlock had thought he would do this another way, in a situation where John had accepted every step of the process and they were alone. Definitely not in a despicable alley, on a winter night, both of them covered in blood and trash.
He had sometimes seen symptoms like those, in the shelters of the dystopians which stood in the outskirts of the ‘Lion Den’. They were located under the bridges in the banks of the Thames to assist those who were wounded, but the few that were able to escape from the ‘clean’ side after being captured and separated from their animals. It was the distance, the pain inflicted to their other side or their spirit, which caused the physical pain. And the same thing was happening to him. He wondered what they were doing with the animal of this poor dystopian, and where it was located. And how long it had been there.
“Mycroft decided to adapt the basement cave and turn it into a training area after another vampire almost managed to kill his bodyguards in the forties. Even though vampires can’t grow any extra musculature or strength by training, werewolves absolutely can. My brother thought they should have a place to get fit if they needed to.”
“So you are half French?”
“I know. The other option is the vampire who changed me could have fled somehow. They could have taken me out to the shore, changed me there, and then somehow they managed to disappear leaving three healthy humans behind. Not bothering to check if I made it.”
Sherlock took a sip of his wine, eyes never leaving John’s. The wine was good, his taste buds singing from the wonderful offering. Just because he was a vampire did not mean he couldn’t enjoy the wonders of human food, even if it was useless for him. He saw how John’s pupils dilated and his heart raced for a minute.
It was normal for people to go in search of other partners after the mourning period was over. Sherlock guessed John’s had finally ended, and he supposed he should be happy John was starting to be a healthy human male again, especially after the ordeal of Mary’s death. And even more so because, maybe in the close future, Rosie might get a new mother.
“First things first. The messy part is over, so get rid of those terrible things before I find another lover. You being a newborn vampire does not excuse you for being filthy.”
Sherlock looked at him, a grin on his face, and bit softly at John’s chest.
Sherlock’s eyes rolled inside his skull when he felt teeth close around his other nipple, sucking and licking the trapped skin while busy fingers tugged on his shirt and pulled it free of his trousers.
The voice over him sounded concerned. He was about to ignore the man in favour of getting up, when whoever pushed him away from the car rose and lent him a hand. Frowning, he took it and used it as a leverage to get himself up again. A spark like static crossed his whole arm, right from the spot in which their skins touched.
Sherlock smiled.
“Bloody hell. Where is all this water coming from?”
“Molly...”
“I think it’s time I spent some time with my niece, don’t you?” Mycroft’s tone was polite and soft. He had already met Rosie, when John first moved back to Baker Street.
The mentioning of his rank made an icy finger climb up his back.
And with that said, I’m letting you read.
With John’s voice whispering lowly in his ear and his muscles contracted in controlled pressure against Sherlock’s cock, the dormant beast inside him awoke and flipped both of them so John was underneath him resting on the pillows. He growled, deep and animalistic, mouth still firmly closed with teeth clenched, and buried his face in John’s armpit, sniffing the spot where his mate’s body odour was most intense. John moaned and made a surprised little sound when Sherlock took both his legs and settled them over his arms, making room so he could thrust more fervently.
Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes, committing those words to memory. He would study them during the morning. Maybe he’d have something relevant by night.
And the families who had dystopian children were punished severely. The government could easily command them to leave their property and possessions. Many of these people were evicted, as they couldn't afford to have a house because they could not pay the fines.
John gritted his teeth, without losing sight of Moriarty. He did not struggle, he didn’t move. He did not even try to escape when Jim bent down to untie the knot that tied the strap to the ground, and took the leash to pull him towards a pair of white doors on the other side of the room.
John saw there were no windows, so his wish to see where the Manor was or simply to know the time, was useless. Sherlock had mentioned Rosie was sleeping with Mycroft, so he deduced it was still night. But for how much longer, he couldn’t know.
Nuts. The crow had brought him a small pouch with ten nuts.
It happened on a quiet Friday evening, after John had come back from the clinic. Sherlock had been receiving crossed signals from his friend for the last few weeks. One day he was extremely tactile, resting a hand on Sherlock’s hips while crossing by him in the living area. Another time, John was Standing at his back, close enough for Sherlock to feel the heat of his body against his backbone while he had Rosie on his lap. At first he thought it was a parental thing, a way to mark his territory, so to speak. Perhaps to make sure Rosie knew who her real father was.
Sherlock’s nose pressed against John’s carotid, high on the smell of blood and sex emanating from his mate’s skin. “Maybe we should take this inside.”
He was being intubated.
The place was illuminated by LED stripes falling across the irregular stone walls, which had activated once they stepped into the cave. The cold, white light shone over the stone floors.
Greg laughed.
“We can’t all be the golden boy, can we?” John replied. Then, after a deep breath, he continued . “So you got out of hell because...”
John gasped.
Sherlock could feel his tears choking him. He had wanted John to become a vampire, too, but not like this. When he thought of the future, he could not fathom one in which John was not with him. He wanted to share everything eternity had to offer, to discover it with him. He had planned for this moment another way. He had had a completely different idea, another way of telling him.
“It does. Guess that’s what happens when you charge high prices for the food and keep your reputation up. Add to that a bit of taste and the presence of mind to find a good interior designer and there you are.”
But there was no way he would let the man he loved die in his arms, or die at all. He couldn’t. Not now, not ever.
Sherlock clicked his tongue.
Sherlock swallowed air. "Good."
So Sherlock bit down right on the man’s carotid, taking a hard suck. He felt the blood fill his mouth, spicy and hot, and he muffled a groan against the man’s skin. The suspect screamed, suddenly very awake, and realising he was in a very real, very present danger.
’, then you had to have one of the medical vans. Fortunately, the workers in the only two functional hospitals on that side of London were also dystopic, so collaboration was often helpful and close.
John snuggled him closer.
“Clothes,” he ended up gasping, and it almost sounded like a plea.
“It’s not just fire that burns. Acids or lime would also do the trick. Fire is just the most popular method because of its  easier access.”
Damn. It was good to be alive.
She knew for a fact that good faith was for the children.
“John.”
“Hmm?”
“No, I... It’s too soon. And I wanted...”
He opened his eyes after a while and rose to stand in front of Jordan’s bed. Looking under it, far beyond a casual hand’s reach, was a wooden box with some sort of animation promo engraved at the top. He loosened the lid and opened it.
John seducing her, working smoothly to encourage her to invite him over for coffee.
Holmes laughed. It was a serious and humorless laugh. His hands were gripping to the wheel while he slowed down, stopping at the light at Piccadilly.
A/N:IMPORTANT STUFF AHEAD PLEASE READ
The bartender handed Sherlock a bottle of Scotch, and asked John if he wanted a drink. The Archangel considered it. It wasn't like he could get drunk, but he sometimes liked the strong, burning flavour of the strong liquors. He asked for an
“You don’t know how breakable you are... Were. Bones and flesh are so tender. I learned, over the years, where I could touch without causing lasting damage. How much strength to use when holding someone’s hand. The first time I hugged someone human after being turned  I almost broke her ribs. It took me some time to be able to establish a ratio between my strength as a vampire and a human’s. Mycroft and I spent years working on ways to pass as normal men, to act and behave as humans do. Until then, it was mostly a nightmare to touch anyone.”
“Aha!”
Sherlock was sniffing the air, trying to find a clear path out of all the various and disgusting smells.
"He has turned into James' personal dog. And when I say personal dog, I mean that literally."
“We are not doing this again. Why are you here?”
. To the coast.”
The wood trembled, but the door remained closed. John sniffed and flexed, hands clenching and unclenching before he settled again. He took one deep breath, and gave a hard kick onto the wood next to the door handle.
“Beans?”
He only had to search for him or her and pray that nothing happened to them along the way.
“Would you try to kill me if I tried?”
was too far away from Buckingham, and he didn't remember having received any beating worthy of a transfer to Bart’s.
Sherlock blinked again.
It had all been bright, blinding light at the very beginning. Just voices and a feeling of peace, belonging and right. He was just a thought, an idea. Strong and fierce, as all convictions are at its origins. His mission, was to serve and protect the Creation. He had been immensely happy, filled with joy and being true to his core. He delivered Justice, hard but with kindness, firm but compassionate. Always the vigilant protector of God’s favourite creature.
As you might have noticed, this is the end of this fic... but not of the story!
“Get up. Now!”
. They couldn’t.
He rose his eyebrows, moving so he could get to his feet. The man walked, his naked feet sinking into the burning ash of the ground. Enormous wings folded back leaving trials behind him. The milky skin burned with glowing embers, before sticking back again by its own accord. His expression betrayed no feel of pain. He looked at the creature at his feet.
“Mrs. Hudson’s flat is flooded.”
“Of course, Jim”
Sherlock gasped, blinking at the sight of those eyes, and decided to kiss John again, deeply and passionately. John answered automatically, opening his lips for him, welcoming the exploratory tongue. Sherlock felt the taste of sweet honey dying to ash when he touched it. Unable to taste anything since he fell, he chased the rapid sparks of flavour coming from the Archangel. He was hungry for more. Starving not only for sensations he had not felt for a very long time, but for touch and closeness from the light that had been prohibited to him. One he could only remember and dream of chasing again. Sherlock felt the increasing heat of John’s body against his hands, and it began to itch, hurting the soft, tender skin of his body. But he’d be damned if he pulled away now.
The dessert was lovely and Sherlock had been high on John’s smell since his declaration. It was hard to control his fangs. He was glad he had had two blood bags that morning and his steak had been pretty undercooked so that helped, too.
“He’s been shot in the leg. I’m going to take Dimmock.”
Moran didn’t even look at him. He was looking forward, watching the indicator with the numbers, which changed every second.
The clear memory of a black raven filled his mind. It was as if he was looking at it, in front of him, piercing him with its black eyes...
this. Never you. Or Rosie. Our family.”
Mycroft was now the leading druid of all Great Britain covens, which was not an easy task. He had been raised inside the London coven, and his master, seeing how his mundane career was progressing, got him ready to get ahead of his fellow apprentices. Eventually, Mycroft’s magic was too good to ignore, and his position inside the British government was important enough to grant him the majority of the votes in the chief elections during the Samhain council.
Flashes of his dreams came back, and he saw a bright light and gold blood running down tanned skin.
“No.”
One of Sherlock’s hands found his, and he entangled their fingers, giving John a light squeeze.
He was about to move, concerned, when at last John turned to look at him. His pupils were back to normal, his eyes relaxed and shining with a light that hadn’t been there before. There was a bit of blood trailing down the corners of his lips and across his chin, and dark splatters on the fabric of his sweater. John’s mouth was glossy, crimson coloured, and Sherlock couldn’t look away from how his tongue lapped at his lower lip in an attempt to clean the mess.
, he could easily picture him with his sandy fur bristling, his bared fangs and bloodshot eyes. If his wolf was going to get, they were going to hurt him.
“I know why you are here John. I know who you sister and your mother are, and I know where they are located”, said Mycroft, pressing a button in the glove compartment. John looked at him in horror, squeezing his hands into fists. “Don’t worry, I won’t say anything. Jim doesn’t know about them, and if he figures it out, it won’t be from me. Give me a little credit, Captain.”
A year after entering Moriarty’s service in order to protect his group, the rebels and his own family, John would have felt revulsion for someone in his situation, and because now, after so many years of wear he had reached a point where he had really stopped caring if anything dangerous happened to his body. He sincerely hoped that the situation that he was in would change someday. That the madness he was surrounded in would disappear and everything would go back to how it was before Jim changed him, but he knew it was nothing but a dream. And dreams were for children.
“It’s ok. You can come in my mouth,” he said, thinking that was what might be bothering John.
Sherlock had explained more details about his new life as a vampire. Sun would not damage him, nor were sacred ground or wood especially harmful. He could go weeks without blood but he would get slow and hungry. Anything able to destroy his brain permanently, keeping him unable to feed until his body rotted, was enough to kill him for good. They talked about many things, yet Sherlock’s past remained a mystery.
The case hadn’t been particularly complicated: a locked door murder (which Sherlock loved), poisoned med student in his own room, no safe way to know who did it or where it happened. The Yard had arrived first (obviously) and (luckily) hadn’t messed around too much with the evidence.
“Well, because we are two people who like each other and like to have fun together?” he ventured, carefully looking at him. His eyes searched Sherlock’s, as if trying to read him. “I didn’t get it wrong, did I?”
John pulled out the gloves of his attire, flexing his fingers. He sighed, frowning. He knew that this day was coming.
Sherlock found himself enjoying a more civilian lifestyle, one where he went to the park with Rosie to feed and chase the ducks or to find squirrels while John was working at the clinic. He would sit peacefully reading a book from the shelf while John played with Rosie building with her foam-made construction games and her stuffed animals. He was delighted every time he heard the sweet sound of the child’s giggles and learned how not to be terrified each time she decided to cry, especially at night.
The source of it all was the receiving end of a baby speaker. It was on the table near the bed, with lights indicating the incoming sounds flickering softly. The volume was set on low, to his surprise. He was tempted to turn it higher, just to test and make sure he was indeed hearing Rosie, but he refrained. Sherlock had kept it low for a reason. Because it had been Sherlock’s doing, he was sure. Maybe he wanted to keep track of Rosie’s sleep while waiting for John to rise to make sure everything was fine.
John frowned.
“Gone for the weekend,” John growled against his skin.
noticed?
Sherlock couldn’t do it.
“You are the Archangel”, he said. Even if his glamorized voice wasn’t as soft and dimensional as his real voice had been, it was still beautifully deep. Something forgotten and captive tingled inside him at the sound, and he was torn between crying and singing back.
“Brilliant.”
Grabbing John’s head and the hair at his nape and pulling back to separate from him was the most difficult thing Sherlock had done in a very,
“That seems... oddly coincidental.”
Let go. Let go. Trust me. Don't fight. Use it in your favour.
Unsatisfied with the current angle, or maybe seeking something to chew on, John abruptly changed the side of the neck he was drinking from, bitting down his own way to reach the blood.
's breast. He was called after one of Odin’s ravens, the Norse God. Sherlock had always liked the old myths. And the name had its own joke since it was the thoughts were the only thing capable of keeping Sherlock alive in recent times.
"I'm a doctor." I calmly tell you.
"Yes, John, I'm alive." Sherlock said, crouching so he could get to John's eye level, a small smile twitching at his mouth. "I'm glad you finally came to that realiza-"
It was only after Mrs. Hudson walked away that John stepped ever closer to Sherlock's grave, a hand resting on top of the smooth black marble. He never imagined he'd have to see this day, to be here, experiencing this. The entire thing was rather horrible.
John silently added, but he didn't say it out loud. There was another beat of awkward silence on the other end of the line, and John worried for a moment that Sherlock had hung up.
I want to ask. Oh. They're probably taking me to surgery, so that's why. But I want you there anyways. You've broken rules to do what you want before, why not now?
"Nggh, Jesus, no." John tried to stand, but his legs would not work. "God, no."
Scrambling to his feet as quick as he could in his current state, John ran to the group of people now gathered around the scene. The police sirens seemed like a mild thrum in the back of his mind, unnoticed and uncared for by the doctor trying to force his way past the crowd.
"Just checking." John muttered to himself.
"I hope it's alright. We never really had much use for it before, I already went ahead and changed up the sheets and all that."
"Sherlock! Wait!"
I need you here, Sherlock, with the warm weight of your hand on my arm.
After he'd changed, washed up, and laid down, John felt himself relax for the first time in a long time. It felt comforting, to have someone else in the house besides him and his daughter. And the fact that it was Sherlock, that he now knew Sherlock was safe, put him at ease. It was easy to fall into a doze.
"Sherlock, for
John sniffed deeply, looking over his shoulder once before he looked back down at the grave.
John nodded before going into the sitting room to shut off the telly, putting Sherlock's mug in the sink. He'd wash it in the morning. Sherlock was in the bathroom by then, soft light flooding out from underneath the shut door, so John left him to it, going to his own bedroom.
"Sorry," was the first thing to exit John's mouth, and he could've slapped himself for it. Although, it did gain Sherlock's attention, accompanied by a questioning look. "It's late, I know, but- I was worried. About you, I suppose. I hadn't heard from you since . . . well, you know, and I thought that you'd like a place to stay."
You look like you haven't slept well in days, or at least gotten a few minutes at a time, judging from the dark circles underneath your eyes. You haven't showered, either, as your hair has a greasy look to it underneath the fluorescent lighting. You've been here the entire time I've been unconscious, haven't you? You haven't gone back to 221B, those are still the same clothes from when I was shot. I can tell, there's blood on the cuff of your sleeve.
that's what."
Oh, lovely, why had he suggested a call? It wasn't like he wasn't going to see Sherlock again, considering that they'd most likely bump into each other once they went back to Baker Street to assist with the rebuilding, so why on Earth did this feel like such an important thing to do? But he'd already extended the offer, Sherlock had accepted, and that was that. John pulled up Sherlock's name in his contact list, hit the call button, and held the mobile up to his ear as it dialed. The call was picked up almost immediately, but there was only silence on the other end, accompanied by a bit of rustling about.
"Okay. I'll see you then." John said, before ending the call and immediately setting off into the kitchen to put a kettle on to boil.
We pull away and meet gazes for a second, before we both burst out laughing. And it feels good,
John's heart just about stopped when he heard
that, really? It's creepy, and I shouldn't.
"A kind offer." Sherlock murmured in reply, setting his untouched tea on the coffee table. "I wasn't ready to reach out to anyone yet, I was still . . . sorting myself out. But, thank you for extending the invitation. It might have been just what I needed."
John watched, in mute horror, as Sherlock's body was put onto a gurney and wheeled away into the hospital, and that was when, at last, tears began to fall from John's eyes, hands resting on his knees as he drowned in his own sorrow. Just like that, Sherlock had been painfully torn from his life, from everyone's lives.
but I don't pay attention, my eyes on the stars. Stargazing calms me, and I count the different constellations in my head. There's the Big Dipper, and there's-
"Alright. So, I'm going to go put away the groceries that you caused me to spill all over the floor, and you . . . do something with yourself, I don't care what." John got up from his chair, stretching his arms upward before heading over to the entrance of the flat, getting to work on picking up the food he'd dropped.
"Yes, dear." Mrs. Tawney gave a tired chuckle in response, shaking her head as she was tugged to her feet by her eager daughter. "Have a good day, Doctor Watson."
Upon reaching Tesco, John took out that week's list of groceries from his pocket, scanning over it before he gave an affirming nod, taking a cart and pushing it into the store. The music in here was always far too cheery for his opinion, but he was focused on his shopping, and nothing else. He didn't use the self checkout once he was done, instead going to the manual checkout lanes and making small talk with the cashier as he fumbled for his wallet in his pocket. Everything seemed to remind him of Sherlock, especially the chip-and-pin machine, but he swiped his card and went on his way.
Sherlock?!" John snarled, and Sherlock watched in silent wonder. John hardly ever cursed so vulgarly, only when he was extremely upset. "You let me think you were dead for two years, two yea- I bet you heard everything I said at your funeral, didn't you? And you just had a great bloody laugh to yourself! How could you
A breath hitched in John's throat as he stumbled upon a picture frame, shoved deeply away where he wouldn't have to see it. He and Sherlock had been taking pictures for the newspaper the day it was taken, and whilst John smiled, Sherlock wore an extremely serious expression. The detective was never really a fan of all the newfound fame, and it showed. Although, once the newspeople had turned off their cameras, Sherlock had leaned down to John's ear and whispered a deduction about the cameraman, to which John had laughed heartily. Lestrade had managed to snap a photo of the moment when they both weren't looking, and sent it to John, who had gotten it framed and kept it in his office. The pair of them were both smiling and laughing, and while back then it had been a good memory, now it was just a painful reminder of what had been.
"John." your voice is hoarse, and I can dimly see your face in the moonlight. "John, listen to me. I
So, here we are, running through the dark streets of London, feet slapping the pavement and hearts racing. A man with a gun, a
"Goodbye, John."
I can tell when we're at the hospital, I can hear the doors open. They're wheeling me out, but they're going quicker this time, and I know they're running because I can hear their feet slapping on the linoleum floors. I can hear you, too. The doctors are telling you to go to the waiting room, but you don't want to listen.
The doctors pause, staring, but you take that chance to push past them, settling beside me in the ambulance. You're there again, worried, and your presence relaxes me. You're there, and I can take another breath. Your hand comes to rest on my arm again as we ride to the hospital, and you talk to me, your voice low.
"Yes. Alright." I say, and you're taking my mobile from my hand. "Sherlock, I've already-"
John squinted at the clock on his bedside table, trying to determine exactly what time that it happened to be.
Holmes had carved himself a place within John's heart, nestled himself there, forced himself to fit, and it'd been a gaping wound after Sherlock had taken his fall. It had torn John apart, and he'd just been putting himself back together again when
I'm in a chair, my chair, the one I've made myself so comfortable in at the flat. You have your armchair, and I have mine. You always look angry when your brother visits and he takes my chair. I wonder why.
John heard the ping of the collar button falling to the ground, and then Sherlock’s detachable collar parted and fell away from Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock threw the collar in the general direction of the bedside table, muttering, “There,” and swiftly undid the first few buttons of his shirt. “Sorry,” he said, and moved back in towards John.
“I can rename the place, maybe. ‘A Café of Idiots’.”
John's day at the surgery goes unbearably slowly.
He wiped his hand over his face and tried to get his brain working properly again. Was this shock? Not surprising if it was. John would –
“It’s been a fucking nightmare.”
“I think so.”
“But how do I get over this?” Sherlock spluttered.
“Do you want-” he began, and Mycroft held up an imperious hand.
As Sherlock lay there in the dual comfort of Rosie breathing softly against his chest and the gun cool on the small of his back, he heard the sounds of activity out in the park. After so long of not hearing or seeing anything or anyone, voices of other humans were disconcerting.
“An old friend let them know. I didn’t know until today.”
Today's prompt is "lights".
My brain kind of goes offline, goes back to my old ways. I’m so fucking horny that I don’t think it through. When the café is quiet enough, I go to the loo and take a quick picture of my vagina and send it to him.
me. But that’s all right. As long as you can – stay. Be near. I am grateful for every minute I have with you. That’s all I want.”
“Without the risk of a stinking bodyguard around the corner.”
“Go home and change, and for God’s sake don’t forget to return your costume,” Michael said. “Waters will come to your flat, you know. Want to grab a pint tomorrow?”
Sherlock let the door slide shut, and leaned against the door, letting all the tension out of his body with a gust of breath.
There was snow on John's face. Sherlock could see every tiny detail of one snowflake, its crystal lines and edges clear against John's cheek. Then it transformed into a single drop of water, sliding down John's face.
John found himself smiling, and turned away himself, forced the smile off his face.
John shifted uncomfortably. “I guess I was always taught that seeking praise was being selfish.”
“Do you think he will, Holmes?” John asked.
“Two suitcases, maximum, love,” John said, grinning.
“Feng is on a six month field study of the silk industry in 19th century China; Charles is cleaning up the last of the threads in WWII Suffolk, Amanda is in Myanmar observing the 2029 revolution, and Teerha is on paternity leave. I’m desperate, John, please.”
“What do you think, Doctor? I’ll take the lower room, if you don’t mind – I’m a night owl, often doing experiments through the night – don’t worry, Mrs. Hudson, it’s harmless. Well. Usually harmless. But they’re excellent rooms, don’t you think?”
John blinked, and followed her dropped jaw and line of sight to the door. To his surprise, Sherlock had just swept in, leaving a sea of staring art students in his wake.
Sherlock broke into a run, circling the space, John only a half step behind him. Sherlock lengthened his strides, running not for speed but to wake his body and to feel the air rush in his face. He heard John adding taps to his run, and not to be undone, Sherlock added a few pirouettes and ended with a turning jump.
“Your English is just fine,” John said. He turned back to Sherlock. “Breakfast?”
“You need to forgive her.”
“Of course I do.”
“And if you love me, it doesn’t matter to me if you’re a man, or asexual. All I wanted – it’s enough for me, if you love me. It is. So. Do you love me?”
John decided he needed to make up for the extra time kneading, so it was a little shy of an hour later when he tipped his dough out and punched it down, per the instructions. When Sherlock entered the kitchen again, John was already happily kneading again. Sherlock said nothing but turned his full attention again to his bread, having spent the last hour solving a cold case from 1962.
Many thanks to PipMer, my lovely beta, and to everyone else who followed along!
I should call Claire. She’d probably have something to say about all this. Likely along the lines of ‘Run, you stupid idiot.’ But she married Martin, so is she really one to judge?
Like a mirage, the door to the embassy was opening. Sherlock smiled.
“Time, gentlemen!” Lestrade bellowed from the lounge.
“I can see why
They received word from Mrs. Hudson that she was safe, in Kent with her sister. As happy as they were to hear this, they were relieved that she had decided to stay permanently - it would be better for her health. John began work with Rajjit to figure out a way to arrange a visit, but petrol was still limited.
He shook his head slightly to dismiss the irrelevant data. “Lestrade, show me a map of where they’ve been found?”
He had stripped off his jumper and was down to his vest. He was wearing a pair of tap shoes that were clearly old and had seen better days. He had clearly been dancing for some time – his vest was dark and stained, and his face was ruddy and sweaty from exertion.
And he was gone, with a flick of his (rather nice) coat.
“Just-” Sherlock twirled his hand in the air. “Whatever comes into your head. I think I’ve got everything from my childhood and early adulthood, so anything after that…”
“So what are you doing now? Aren’t you just fooling around with the steps?”
His voice is clear and crisp but not angry, even though the words are. I realize like a gut punch that he knows exactly what I’m talking about. I look up and I see Boo, and she’s nodding with a sad smile on her face. I sit down, and Sherlock and I just sit together in silence for a long time.
Sherlock’s phone trilled, and he broke eye contact with John to look at it.
The chef gritted his teeth, turned and left. Sherlock knew that John and Mary were looking at each other, hiding their smirks, amused at Sherlock but trying to be nice.
The gutural voice of the suspect came from behind John’s body, low and tense. “I’m not going to jail.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Pain and hurt blossomed at Sherlock’s core, the flame on his head licking viciously his horns. He could feel the bone itching right down to his skull.
Modern times came and his core changed. He found himself coming back home more times than necessary. Hope was running low and his core suffered because of it.  Being an Archangel, one of God’s commanders, he had been able to manage it. He could not even fathom how this would affect the younglings.
Many centuries had passed since his quest began. He had seen the wars of men, sometimes even found himself in the middle. A kind soul, a helping hand, a protector. The ancient times had been easier. Closer to his own core. Not much of his nature had been forced to change. And yet, every time he went back to heavens, he felt a little more bitter. A little more sad. He needed the cleaning of the Grace to keep going. It helped. He got rid of the negativity, and found peace in the love and acceptance of his family. Once he found himself balanced, he went back. Every time, he dropped his ancient identity and took a new one. A chance to start anew. To find new clues.
The sound of John’s coat moving with the wind as he walked past him made him blink, suddenly aware of the chill around him. He shivered as he saw the compact, familiar shape of the Archangel leaving the intimacy of the street they were in, and turn around the street. He saw, from the distance, how he took a phone out of his pocket and fast dialled what looked like a police number. If he was going to anonymously call the police to report the dead body, he’d better leave. Not that he couldn’t deal with a bunch of human officers. But it wasn’t worth the effort.
He had been sent to the 'Lion's Den' along with a team of doctors in order to perform a collection of samples that all of the dystopians by force had to be present. Sherlock sneaked into the hermetic exam room, passing the DNA sample to Mike, by taking the identity of one of the dead junkies in the usual smoking room. It was his only way to have five minutes alone with him. And, in a way, to smuggle contents it in a small extent. It was just enough to get by.
Well, I have created this sort of experiment with the AU of the Soul Mates, because for a long time I have wanted to do something similar. It was supposed to be a One Shot, but I think that it's going to be a Short Fic. Although the ones that have been following me for a long time know how little value my calculations have ... so we will see. (Definitely not going to be a short story, my lads. The original in Spanish is nowhere near the end)
“I’m calling Mycroft. Stay awake, John. Can you hold my hand?” Sherlock asked, trying to keep his voice still. There was no time for an ambulance. By the smell of it, the knife had pierced the kidney and also a lung. No ambulance would make it in time with injuries that serious.
Resisting the urge to lick it clean, he carefully passed the boxers over John, being careful not to overstimulate the sensitive area. Once it looked decent enough, he cleaned himself and then threw it the soiled fabric over his shoulder, not caring where it fell.
“Kissing you, idiot.”
Wound? No doubt that would explain the morphine, but it did not explain everything else.
. Second, of course I know you can take care of her. Don’t be daft. But you can hardly attend to her if you are coming with me, don’t you think?”
He discovered the Leader's name when he appeared in an official statement put on the weekly report on the TV. The image barely lasted twenty seconds, but Sherlock was able to remember. And with the name and the face, the bastard's days were numbered. Sherlock was twenty-six years old, and Mycroft was thirty-one.
“Are you five years old all of a sudden?” Sherlock seemed outraged.
Then a flash of pure white covered the world, and the sound of the universe exploding filled his head.
“No, you didn’t.”
John was hurting. He hadn’t known he could be capable of that. Not with him. The John he always knew had been a kind, loving soul. Always caring. But now, it was hard to see him under that hard and cold cover. His eyes ran over the Archangel, recognising the marks of past fights and ugly scars on a soul he had once seen as perfect, untouched. It was almost impossible to recognise his John in the being in front of him.
“Sherlock.”
So bloody much.
Without a second thought, he took the already damp head into his mouth.
“I.. You can call me by my first name, sir. Mr Holmes sounds a little strange to me.” He explained and wondered if it was appropriate to tell a teacher to call you by your first name?

“Let me interrupt you here and add a few things to the list of things I never want to hear you say anymore. Sexuality, puberty, hormones and
It was probably still locked as it was still roughly half an hour until class would start. But on the bright side, he would 100% be on time. Including that ten minutes earlier he had set for himself.
“Yeah, I’m gonna need to see some ID.” The guy said and Janine gaped.
"Fine, you too." Sherlock muttered, before turning and starting out the kitchen.
Then again, what if there would someday be someone who would convince the detective otherwise? Was there someone out there Sherlock could actually fall in love with? John felt bad for thinking it, but if there was John hoped Sherlock and him (or her – who knew with Sherlock Holmes?) would never meet each other. He knew he couldn't bear to see Sherlock with anyone else.
“Nice to meet you too, darling.” His mother chirped happily and bloody
»Oh, you should.« she said and shot Sherlock a smirk around the cigarette. »I'm the hottest thing in this place although I might have to share my crown with you...« she said giving a small wave of hand to underline her words. »
"Sherlock! Get up! You gotta be in school in half an hour!" Speaking of the devil, Mummy called from downstairs as if by command.
“Quiet.” Watson said in a very low and threatening voice, cutting off the laughter. “So you mean to tell me, he’s gay?”
»Sh... Sherlock... what...« the doctor breathed in confusion, his voice trembling slightly as he felt Sherlock's hips against his own. Then there were soft cupid bow lips kissing his neck, teasing it with tongue and teeth, the pleasure emphasised by soft locks lightly tickling his jaw as those perfect plum lips moved over his skin.
Janine chuckled at that, “You’re such a nerd, I love it.”
Sherlock:
Slipping into the small corner, Sherlock sighed silently to himself, finding it crowded, instead of being empty as it had been during the first period. Great. That was just great. Rolling his eyes, he occupied a small spot to himself, that was as far away from everyone else as possible, leaning against the brown-ish brickwall of the gym as he pulled out his cigarettes, taking one out of the pack and lighting it up, before slipping the pack back into his pocket and taking a deep drag, relaxing into the blue smoke that left his lips as he exhaled.
) that he was gay. He really did need that social tutoring, apparently.
Okay, John didn't exactly turn Sherlock's world upside down, yet, but in the next chapter then, promise ♥
See, told you there isn't happening much. But in the next chapter John will show up and turn Sherlock's world upside down ♥ sort of :)
“Are you joking?” Janine asked, following Sherlock over to the table he had spotted. “The guy is totally into you and you just walk off?” she asked with a laugh. “Don’t tell me he isn’t your type, because he’s super cute.”
The day went by just about exactly like the next one and a half months did. Sherlock – to his mother’s surprise and unknown to Janine – continued to go to class just as early. And like clockwork, Mr Watson was always there to unlock the classroom and they’d just sit there, like they had on his second day of school, him sitting in his seat and Mr Watson at his desk in the front and they’d just.. chat.
“I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable before, dear.” His mother said as she sat down on the bed, “I just thought you and that Janine girl were… are you doing
“Well, I guess..” Sherlock murmured and continued to watch the man.
»Someone's picked up with
Sherlock sighed, gritting his teeth ever so slightly, his mouth forming a thin line. » There's a difference between being shy and not being interested and with you, it's the latter.« he stated firmly, pressing his back tightly against the wall now and feeling a little trapped as there was no way to escape this girl. If that was what his mother meant by making friends, then Sherlock was right to have been wary about it.
Time passed slowly and Sherlock felt like even watching an hour glass would have been more exciting than listening to A level english. He was almost bored enough to actually work.
It was about an hour later when they walked up to Sherlock’s house, which left Janine gaping at the sight of it.
“Basically that, yeah.” Janine said and picked up a piece of very purple fabric.
“Well, I should hope so.” His mother said and laughed again, “And the other students? Apart from Janine, I mean.”
“So.. you want to go inside now? Pretty sure
“I guess not..” Sherlock said and thought again of Mr Watson. “The teachers aren’t all horrendously stupid.”
He spit into his hand again then, gripping his throbbing erection and slicked it with the same mixture of fluid, before he lined up with Sherlock, his heart thumping against his ribcage as if it wanted to break through it as the tip of his arousal pressed against Sherlock's entrance.
(See the end of the chapter for
Preparation. Okay. Right. For a moment, he sat knelt behind Sherlock, tempted to switch on the light to see what he was doing. To make sure he didn't do anything wrong, ignoring that he had no idea what he was doing anyways. He knew the human anatomy though, thank god he did.
"I do." Sherlock murmured after a moment of silence, looking at his food, stirring the cereals.
“Well, we’ll see about that.” Janine said confidently, standing up again, “Come on then, take that godawful jacket off so I can get to fitting the other for you.”
“No, we shouldn’t.” he said quickly, “Wouldn’t that be weird? Like casually hanging out with our teacher?” not that he wasn’t already doing that most days anyway. “Pretty sure he isn’t interested in hanging out with his students in his free time anyway.” Doubtful, again. Although Sherlock liked to think that this was in fact true, but he was the exception to the rule.
“It was nice to meet you, Mrs.. I mean, Violet.” Janine said and chuckled as they went up the stairs.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "It still looks awful." he murmured and sat down at the breakfast table, where his mum had already prepared a bowl of cereals and a cup of tea for him. He wasn't hungry, but he had promised Mum that he would regularly eat, if she wasn't making him find some sort of part time job to pay for the ruined kitchen – which would have been ridiculous in itself, since his family was rather wealthy and a ruined kitchen was really not such a big deal, it didn't even take a full week until it was looking like nothing ever happened. Must have been some sort of parenting method. After a long discussion Sherlock and his parents had come to the conclusion that it would suffice for Sherlock to learn his lesson if he would go for a regular breakfast routine – Mum had wanted breakfast
colour better, but.. it looks good on you.”
"Of course, I'm nervous, I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be nervous if he was going to be beaten to a pulp..."
“Lock. I’ve decided that it’s the perfect nickname for you, also if I say Sherlock all the time, I’m bound to get caught up in some tongue twisters. It’s that or Shazza. Take your pick.”
“Just wondering if I’ll get us burgers or ice cream with that five pounds you’ll hand over tomorrow.” She said cheekily, starting to unpack the jacket and sewing kit while Sherlock huffed a laugh.
Sherlock huffed, grumbling a barely audible, "Sorry." His mother was the only person on this planet Sherlock found somewhat intimidating. "But sending
“That’s two weeks of detention for you.” Watson told Anderson who looked aghast.
»Oh for fuck's sake!« Sherlock grumbled, slipping past Irene with just enough force to push her a bit aside, but not enough to hurt her. »I'm not a virgin, I'm just gay!« he stated loudly, having meant it to be the perfect excuse to break out of this situation, hoping that'd once and for all make her leave him alone.
“Holy shit.. you seriously live here?” she asked and continued to stare at the cottage. Admittedly it was a very large cottage, not excessively so when you considered that it was meant for four people. He could see where she was coming from, though, especially compared to her home. Not that there was anything wrong with it. It was a cosy townhouse and decently sized, but yeah, it was definitely another price class.
“I… I haven’t planned anything yet, but I’m sure I’ll find something to pass the time.” Sherlock said vaguely, he wasn’t going to speed up the process of her getting sick of him by telling her that he was going to dissect that dead frog he had found at their garden pond last night to figure out its cause of death and if it had anything to do with the water quality.
»I was wondering if Mr Holmes has a first name?« she asked and Sherlock couldn't fight a little huffed chuckle.
“I’m doing fine, thanks.” Sherlock said, feeling somewhat undignified, even though she kinda had a point.
. No, nope,
“Whatever gave you that idea?”
Alright, so I've taken a bit of a different approach on this one :3 There really wasn't a lot that'd happen until Sherlock's birthday so I've tried a bit of a time skip, might be a bit lazy, but it felt like it'd keep it more interesting than typing out every single conversation (because that'd have been A LOT :D), but yeah it's honestly more difficult than I thought to go back to a normal writing style after three years of only rping, so basically focusing on just your characters, writing just small snippets and not really bothering with chapters or worrying about skips as long as it's fine with the other person you rp with :D anyway, I said it before and I'll say it again, let me know what you think, especially regarding the skip this time :3
dinner, but Sherlock had convinced her that a regular breakfast was already quite much to take for his stomach.
“Well.. thanks, I guess. That’s.. good to know, actually.” Especially the part about not bringing home anyone as that was still a very likely possibility. So knowing that they didn’t necessarily expect him to be normal now was a bit of a weight off his shoulders. “I should probably get back to that homework though..” he said and his mother nodded, standing up and picking up the tray.
– dressed, with his school bag right next to his chair, chewing away on his mandatory bowl of cereals when she walked into the kitchen that morning.
“Well, I’ll use the money to buy us burgers then to cheer you up after I’ve told you that you’ve lost the bet.” He said when Janine dug out her measuring tape.
It wasn’t until Sherlock had arrived at the biology lab, that he looked back at his lesson plan and realised – this had to be a joke – that his teacher here too was Mr Watson. Undeniably handsome, but also a bit of a cock, Mr Watson. Great. Just bloody awesome. Because his day wasn’t already bad enough. Realising that he still hadn’t changed a thing about his appearance, Sherlock was already mentally preparing himself for another public humiliation. His classmates were probably already getting used to it anyway with the scene in English and that fiasco in the break.
Sherlock barked out a laugh, kissing John again. The joy of having him back, of having him there, alive and like him was nearly too much. He felt high, but if it was from John himself or the sedative-contaminated blood still being purged on his system, he had no way of knowing.
But, then again, John
He took off the essential part of the uniform and then closed his locker, towards his cursed fate.
“Shut up.”
He bent again to lick the drops of come clean and heard John moan quietly above him. He kissed his slightly soft tummy and drew a trail of kisses up John’s torso till he reached his lips, swollen from their previously frantic kissing.
He noticed the collar, of course he did. Someone with his powers of observation could not overlook such detail, and let alone after the gesture of the individual in question. He didn’t care about it. He knew what that meant, and he couldn’t care less. He was here. He was alive. They were together. They had found each other. Nothing else mattered.
John fucking her on the kitchen table, his hands all over the woman’s body.
Why would I want to lift a bloody car?” Now Sherlock looked annoyed. He crossed his arms over his chest.
It was difficult. Because he was mad, mad as hell. But every time he saw him reminded John of long, lonely centuries and sadness and regret... but it was also as if no time had passed. Like nothing had happened.
“I regret... a lot of things,” John said, spitting blood on the floor away from them. Sherlock raised his eyes to look at John’s and discovered they were slightly moist. John pressed harder on his knee, his other hand clutching the collar of Sherlock’s shirt desperately. “But never,
John was surprised to find himself clenching his fists at that sudden thought. He had always been Morning Star. For everyone. For the whole universe he had just been the golden sweet boy who couldn’t do anything wrong. But he had always known him better. Had seen the mischievous glance when he made stars blow into colourful clouds of light and dust, when he sang and everything stilled just to hear that lovely sound. When he teased with forbidden limits out of curiosity for what was beyond. When he frowned at some of the Mighty’s decisions and forced himself not to say a word.
That left him here, at 10:32 PM on a bloody Tuesday, feet wearing treads in the carpet of his sitting room as he paced back and forth in front of the coffee table. He'd put Rosie down for bed a few hours ago, but yet (there was another one of those but yets), he couldn't sleep. He hadn't really slept since after Mary died, and even after he'd reconciled with Sherlock after putting him in hospital. His mobile sat, motionless, on the coffee table, the very source of his internal debate. It was late, of course it was late, but a part of him was itching to at least try Sherlock, to reassure himself that Sherlock was alright. It'd been itching for days, but being manic on three cups of coffee at a late hour seemed to do the trick.
Sherlock laughed as he rose to his feet, striding over to John and taking his hand in a strong grip, pulling him up to a sitting position. "If this were heaven, I certainly wouldn't be there. I'm hardly an angel. Far from it, actually."
"Personal hygiene didn't seem like much of a priority when your life was at stake." You say, rubbing the back of your neck. "I didn't want to leave, you might have . . ."
"Here I am." Sherlock repeated, although a sad smile appeared on his face. "I know, John. I was there. I heard you."
you to stay awake, alright?"
"I'm fine." I say firmly. "I'm awake, and I'm alive. That's what matters."
"Mycroft knew? He
But no, you're slowly slipping away from my side, your longer legs giving you the advantage. My leg hasn't acted up in weeks, but now, it feels wobbly, like it isn't going to hold me up for much longer.
"Goodnight, John."
It took John a minute or so to regain his bearings, blinking slowly as pain began to ebb, in rushes, through his head. He'd have a massive migraine after this was all over and done with, that was for sure, but for now, only one thing was on his mind.
alone, and I owe you so much." his voice was tearful now as he took a step away from the grave. "Okay."
Sherlock's pale-eyed gaze upon his back, although he did not acknowledge it, pretending that this was normal, although it was anything but.
since his best friend had committed suicide, and John had never completely gotten over it, no matter what he told everyone else. He had considered moving out of 221B, considering all the memories it held, but he just couldn't. Baker Street was his home.
I manage to not fall asleep, and the sirens come before I know it. The ambulance is suddenly there, and I'm being lifted, strapped down. Although, I keep my eyes on you, and you do the same to me. But the doctors are trying to hold you back as I'm put into the ambulance, and you look furious.
John's breath stuttered in his throat, his hand moving up Sherlock's arm, underneath the fabric of his sleeve. He then pinched the detective's skin, hard, and Sherlock edged away from him, his nose scrunching in confusion.
"Sh-"
that he was seeing what he was seeing at the current moment in time. Sherlock had been dead for two years, and John had seen the body at the bottom of the fall, so this was certainly some hallucination John had somehow managed to conjure up, or some lookalike trying to mess with him.
John almost laughed, but refrained, crossing his arms as he looked up at the ceiling. Sherlock had actually been there, lurking in the trees, listening to everything John had been saying to his grave. How utterly . . . Sherlock Holmes. He took a sip of tea, which had cooled a bit by now, and sighed.
Much more than that, though, I hope that you, your families and friends are all healthy and stay safe ♥♥♥
“Guess so.” Sherlock said and shrugged.
"I fear I don't, my dear son." Mummy said and Sherlock didn't even have to look up at her to know she was smirking.
Barely twenty minutes had passed when someone knocked at the door to Sherlock’s room, making him groan. He had tentatively started to hope that he’d get through this without a talk after all, but the second knock sealed the deal.
“It wasn’t like I read them voluntarily.” Sherlock complained, but smiled a little.
"See you in the afternoon!" Sherlock called from the front door, slipping into his coat and scarf.
Sherlock thought, wondering if Mr Watson would join right in making fun of him. He was pretty sure the wrath of teachers had legal limitations and they weren’t allowed to join the students making fun of someone.
"Of course, I'm nervous, I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be nervous if he was going to be beaten to a pulp..." he muttered and shovelled another spoon full of cereals into his mouth, just because.
“What about you, Mr Anderson. Would you kindly inform me what everyone’s so excited about?”
“Oh my god.” Janine said and yeah, if she hadn’t said it, he had. “Is that Mr Watson?” she asked with a laugh and pointed at the person Sherlock was already staring at anyway. “We should totally go and say hi!” she chirped and Sherlock’s head snapped around to look at her.
“You’re aware that she probably thinks we’re up here to snog, right?” Janine asked, flopping down on Sherlock’s bed, which left him astonished that she hadn’t so much as scrunched up her nose at the state of his room. It wasn’t dirty or anything, but it also wasn’t tidy. Cluttered. That was probably the best term for it. Really, very cluttered.
Johns breath stuck in his throat as Sherlock rolled them over in his turn, moving himself on top of John and straddling his thighs.
Busying himself with his phone under the table did help a little and apparently Mr Watson wasn't paying attention to him anymore as he wasn't going off about rules again.
“I’m sorry?” Mr Watson asked and looked back up at Sherlock.
"I don't want to go there at all. What part of 'leave me alone' didn't you understand exactly?" he snapped and looked up at his Mum.
Back with another one :) And yes, it's still the same day in the story :D but I'll try to pick up the pace a little bit... I feel like seven chapters for a single day is kinda excessive xD aanyway, moving on, so I kinda wanted to state something... so like it's five years later.. and while I still write Johnlock everyday (I actually had the same rp going on for like three years now, it's insane :D), I've kind of grown out of writing smut as such, that isn't to say that there won't be any smut, I've just started to focus more on the build up of the scene and the aftermath rather than the actual ... devil's tango xD unless something in that scene happens that moves the story further along, that is. So all in all, it will likely still be mature, but not AS graphic as I tended to write smut scenes :3
Tonight, John would start the next attempt. Another date. Another desperate – faded to fail – try to forget about his stupid feelings for him. What was her name again? Oh, right Sarah. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah... Would be better if he'd remember her name, right?
“Oh.. so.. you’ve found it.” He said, grinning guiltily.
“You look like a million dollars.” Janine said in awe of her handiwork as the two stood in front of the mirror attached to his wardrobe and Sherlock chuckled.
“Well, you sure are full of surprises, Mr Holmes.” Mr Watson said, looking down at his papers and Sherlock scrunched up his nose.
“But I wanna dance!” she went on and nearly fell over on her own, but caught herself again just in time.
“Thank god..” Janine murmured and leaned into Sherlock, “I think you’re right.. we should go home.” She said and Sherlock nodded, leading her out of the bathroom, where John was already waiting for them.
“Because my parents would probably murder any guy they find half naked in my room, even if I’m just fitting a suit jacket for him, no matter how gay the guy may be. Like he could have I’m super gay written on his forehead in lipstick and a pride flag under his arm. My dad would still flip.”
– straighten the knocker. Due to hormones – tedious things, thank god Sherlock hadn't had to deal with them yet – mothers were basically unable to find their own children weren't perfect no matter how far away they were from that term. Fathers had a similar problem, but it wasn't as bad as it was with mothers.
“The cab’s outside. Come on, I’ll take over.” John said and took Janine from him.
“I think you just thought that and didn’t say it out loud.” Sherlock said to make her feel better.
"That was the closest I've come to an actual 'I love you, Dad' since I gave him that high tec microscope for christmas a few months ago." his father joked and Mummy chuckled along with the man.
His mother rolled her eyes, “You know what I mean.” She said and ruffled her son’s hair, before Sherlock pulled his head away and ran his hand through his hair to fix the damage she had caused.
