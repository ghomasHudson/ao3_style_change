Yes, very silly. He was fantasizing about his teammate, shouldn’t he had leaned with his former fiancee that it wasn’t a good idea. Natasha at least had been a bro with tits, when we were now talking about a guy who had broken some drunken asshole’s nose just because he had tried to grope a feel.
“He was a minute go. But then somebody cockblocked...”
“Because they always do this. They give me young and innocent things. Want to make me look like a rabid animal. Tease the bull with a red sheet. Hurt the circus lion with a whip. I am not going to dance to them.”
After those ominous words, the security tape from the lab was showed. Steve’s awaking was followed by lot’s of screaming and blood, and yeah, Banner had not lied. He had died and gotten better.
“Good. Glad that all is well. You see, the last time somebody went crazy scientist, the Hulk happened. Not that it says anything to you, but… maybe it will. Director Fury asked me to give you this.”
Nat’s blinis, Thor’s bellowing laughter, even Clint’s stupid jokes. The easy camaraderie was gone and instead they had their usual doses of nasty sarcasm, brooding, and sly glimpses from the eyes of the people they had to again learn to think as their teammates.
“I…” the man started. He was not able to say anything more before Steve kissed him.
Rogers’s eyes moved toward Stark. It was only a tiny action, but told Fury almost too much and his innards filled with ice water when a list of possible consequences rushed into his mind. It took all of his considerable self-control not to bury his fist into Stark’s smug face.
“I can’t say for sure”, Tony hesitated. “I mean, he could be a bad guy there. He could be some Hydra subplot, but...”
“I don’t know if he was. Probably. He was in a bad place. We all were, but he was just a boy. A young man. Too young to make decisions of life and death.”
A pool of sorrow and disappointment broadened inside her chest. Maybe she didn’t deserve it, but during their time in the Avengers, Steve had started to trust her. She respected him as a leader and as a man out of his own time, still keen to learn and not afraid to ask if he was confused. And what had been even more surprising, somehow during those tutoring sessions and team missions they had become real friends.
Tony came back from the closet still dressed only in his shirt. The fresh smell of alcohol lingered around him when he slumped on the bed next to Steve. He turned and hid his face on the pillow, which muffled his words. “I know that you… You think like a soldier, you make a plan and then you execute the plan and that’s it. You instead of booze and coke, that is a… Oh God, it kills me to say this but it will not be enough. I have been drinking since I am teenager. I can’t just quit, my body will go into shock and I will die. I have to check into rehab and take shitload of meds and go to the therapy, and it will take time. Weeks… maybe months. And years and years after that without… Are you really selling your ass out just to dry a little old me?”
“Uh… hello?”
“Oh god”, the other Steve commended and tapped the comm device in his ear. “Tony! Armor up. We gotta go. It looks like Spider-Man is having his ass handed to him by all the animal themed big guns he has beaten up during the last years. No… Tony, I don’t mean Sinister Six… yes, I know Mysterio can… Yes, I am looking at it right now, but… No, Tony. It is definitely not a hologram, Spidey was almost run through by it… Tony, they are ripping the downtown apart, what do you want me to say to Pepper when she asks me why you didn’t get your ass out of your workshop… Yes, I will take my own ride, meet you there… no, I don’t think it will be hard to find. Alright, Tony. Cap out.”
“Oh, you were worried about little old me”, Tony said, giving him one of his infamous playboy smiles, which never endeared his case to Fury. “I was indeed suffocating in something. He was...”
Maybe it was Steve. He was the problem. He had never been the most social person in the world, and this bunch. Their introductions hadn’t exactly gone smoothly, Steve had literally killed one of them. He didn’t like Barton’s attitude and couldn’t trust Romanoff. Banner wasn’t much of a conversationalist and Thor was that too much.
“Let’s start with the family then. What was yours alike?”
“Are you a vegetarian?”
Back to the search, he ordered himself. He didn’t found anything overly useful, though. There was an empty swimming pool, and lots of gym equipment. He returned to the shop and started to search it more diligently while desperation clawed right under his schooled calm exterior.
Steve-sitting-and-shouting stopped his angry tirade when everyone looked at him again.
“Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that then.”
“You can use… you?”
“Shut up, Tony”, Steve mumbled, but didn’t otherwise deny Tony’s remark. “I’m no dame.”
“Now, that was what I call a proper shovel talk.”
“Incoming, three o’clock. Hawkeye, he is behind the summerhouse.”
“Copy, Cap. I got it now.”
“The body is indeed well-preserved”, Fury mumbled from inside his surgical mask. “I bet Doctor Banner is the one doing creaming at the thought to study… Yes, Tony?”
The armor stood still, even if the man inside sounded he was about to faint. Tony opened his visor and took a long pull from the water bottle. “Yes, much better. The new cooling system… some adjustments… but about our visitor here...”
Kiss, that had been a key word. So smart a person Antonio felt too often stupid afterwards. What had Fury said about his bad impulse control? That even if he was healthier, he was too unreliable for real tough missions?
“Well, you don’t let me touch yours”, Clint reasoned. “Really. How about his guns?”
“Alright”, the other Steve said, crushing the empty cigarette box. “Now when we are nicotine high about two seconds, let’s not beat the bushes. You said you had a fiancee. I knew what that would have meant for me, no secret rendezvouses in Paris or hasty hand jobs along the road. In other words: no experience with guys, and naturally not with other gals either. So... you were a bit clumsy while you were playing and then Tony was being Tony and in your post orgasmic sensitive state you took in ill.”
“You don’t need them here. Tony has this state of art alarm system… And Captain can’t be seen shooting around. Hopefully, the woman you shot will be alright. For her sake and ours, if you wonder. Pepper will be very angry with us again.”
“This is nanotech we are talking about.” Richards seemed to find his bearings when they moved from social relations back to the safer ground of science talk. “Those particles can't be seen with plain eyes nor will they all disappear without special cleaning procedures. If you have used your uniform even once in the vicinity of that technology, we will have all the samples we need from it. Do you like to watch police series, Captain?”
Gail’s tone was light, but Steve’s heart was throbbing in his throat when he waited what Bucky might say. His best friend gave him an amazed look, before his nose pinched and eyes flashed in a way they had done when Steve made his bragging decision to leave the airplane without a working parachute.
They went to the elevator and ride down some five floors. There was a large lounge area and after that a common room and a kitchen. Tony had continued the journey down, but the others seemed to have rooms of their own on that same floor.
So much so different people. So funny clothes, hairs, make-ups. It was like being in a cabaret show just when he jogged down the streets on ordinary Wednesday afternoon.
“Alright”, he continued after a while. “It seems it is my turn to apologize. I always forget… Even if you look the same, we are different persons. You are not me. Who knows, maybe you are the more clear-headed one of us. Wanna tell me what happened?”
Steve took his shield and stood up, his gloved hand over the door opening mechanism, ready to engage. “For the record, I understood both of those pop-culture references… alright people. We do as we planned. Janet, do not engage SteveToo in any means. Your mission is to find Antonio. Our only chance to end this quickly and cleanly is that he talks some sense to that big oaf. Let’s hope he is still alive.”
He hadn’t actually washed himself. He was wet, but still dirty.
“Or then what, heroes?” Jake snorted, starting to find his bearings. “You gonna arrest us? Go ahead, you got no evidence. If you wanna do some third degree, lady gallfly, maybe you better tag-team yourself with something more intimidating than Mr. Goody Two Shoes here. Everybody knows Captain America won’t...”
“Steve, don’t be like that. Nothing about what happened was your fault. Mine either. We were so young and naive and didn’t have even ounce of knowledge every teenager have nowadays.”
When the safety lever was released, there was about three and half seconds before detonator would explode and ignite the charge. Antonio wasn’t going to throw the thing at her. No, he had pushed it against his own chest and while the sight broke Janet’s heart, her sting was already hitting his hand, making Antonio drop the grenade. At the same time it was infused by Pym particles and when the thing finally detonated, the explosion was so tiny it made less harm than a child’s firecracker. Even Antonio’s sweats didn’t get burned.
“Where did you put my guns?”
Steve slept like a roadkill (smelling but not especially in pain) and after he woke up, he gave himself a thorough rub in the shower. It made some of his bigger wounds bleed a little, but the other Steve had foreseen that possibility and left him with a first aid kit. Overall, his bruises and wounds were much better than yesterday and would probably disappear altogether during the next twelve hours.
Steve snorted. “No, I don’t think… no more than I miss Thor.”
“Yes, and not my field of expertise. But shouldn’t he be furrier? Not just teeth?”
“What is that?”
Barton’s snickering ruined his dignified sentences. Richards was pushed lightly aside from the camera by the blond-haired woman. Sue Richards seemed to look the same in any universe; no-nonsense taking, efficient, and as it turned out, more people savvy.
It was only a whisper. Not exactly a threat, only stating the fact. The father who was so hungry he gorged on the flesh of his offspring.
There was a tiny box, which he was passing to Rogers. Fury bent forward like doing that he would see better. But damn, maybe it was something dangerous, and if not that, stupid and inconvenient.
He started saying that one aloud when he noticed Antonio was awake and able to listen. Of course that didn’t go as expected either. Or maybe it did. When had Antonio been able to take anything seriously?
Steve’s fingers halted on the buttons. “I have seen your battle scars, Tony. I don’t resent them. But if leaving the shirt on makes you comfortable so be it.”
He muttered something about being sticky and wanting a shower. Then he really had one, after he had put his dirty clothes into the hamper. He knew that those stains would tell anybody what he had been doing, but he felt too drained to care. His enhanced hearing had been picking up signs there would be a guest waiting when he opened the bathroom door. He put on new underwear and sweats and then it was time to face the music. The other Steve was sitting in the armchair like he owned the place (which was actually true), but he didn’t mind that now, only continued dabbing his hair and neck and chest with the towel.
Steve was born and raised on the wrong side of the tracks. He knew well the thoughts of men who asked other men if they were nancy. How they were cheering themselves towards violence with those talks.
Steve didn’t get to know what else Tony wanted to be. Antonio was out again and missed wholly those pompous stairs, Steve carrying his precious load to the second floor feeling like Clark Gable. Now he just had to find a room which had some furniture left. That proved to be an easy task. Like downstairs, the rooms were lightly dusty but otherwise they had most of the furniture intact. He chose one with a huge four poster bed because it still had its mattress under the dust cover, and because it looked like Tony, the room seemed girlish in a same way as Tony’s silken dressing gowns. (He couldn’t imagine to wear one himself, but they looked so good on Tony.)
“Well”, the other Steve said, taking a long pull from his cig. “I can’t know about that… It took the SHIELD and Fury almost eight months before they even started to think I could be let to the field. There were psych evals which lasted for days, and after those I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Tony invented some pump thing which they needed to regulate my massive doses of antidepressants. I am alright now, but just thinking about it… that was a drag. Then when I was finally able to pull my head out of my ass, it was weeks after weeks videos and books and lectures and practices how to live in the modern society. Not just technical stuff, but… You know.”
“I can’t, Tony. I am sorry. I know I should, but I can’t… I can’t...”
“Sorry, old habit. I can say that here and now… and most people don’t mind, don’t even understand. But you know that a dead father is just a euphemism for a good Catholic girl to be knocked up without any prospect of marriage.”
“Alright, I am now a bit confused… Or… is this a virgin talk? Oh god, this is a virgin talk, isn’t it? You don’t have that much experience, and… Yes, I see. You want somebody to show you the ropes, and what is under and over them? Some tips to make it more exiting for your lady-love? God, what did Janet do to you, tried to ram a vibrating dildo into your ass? That could be nice, but maybe not for your first time… Alright, you contacted just the right man-whore, we aim to please.”
When they had thought they were going to die and Steve had considered doing Tony that one final favor.
The End
Fury felt a strange emotion, which he had let himself feel only seldom since his childhood. He was curious. That was the thing which killed the cat, he tried to remind himself, but his guts told him there was a riddle which was not preparing to bite them in the ass. A god honest pleasant surprise was waiting, and finally, after three hours of testing, probing, and rubbing, both men were sitting (as Rogers had guessed it) in the interrogation room, their hands cuffed to the table.
“Wasp! Stop taking those damn pictures and come here to help!”
“Oh, sorry. There is no counterpart of me in your Ultimates? I am Janet van Dyne.”
Tech people and Stark were now out of the room. Fury didn’t let his guard down but he relaxed a bit for he was now only one left who would get hurt if something happened. The thing lifted its head and stared for a moment right at Fury. Its brows wrinkled in confusion. Then its gaze dropped downwards to the gun pointing at its direction.
“His recovering is happening as expected. Overall, his operation went well. Damage was lesser than it seemed… except his tumor, of course. Have you gone through this with Captain Guard Dog there? The nurses report he hardly takes time to eat. If they let him, he would prefer to piss into the bottle instead of using the bathroom.”
Tony’s brief giggle had some desperation on it. “Right, Steve! Could… could you please carry on… soon like. Pretty please, Steve. How about… would you do this face to face?”
“Public executions?”
“A good point. If Tony were still a drunken lecher and tried to grope that guy’s ass, he would beat him black and blue. He got this total different air than our captain. He seems… uptight.”
She had thought Antonio was sleeping, he was so still, but his eyes were open and looking at her when she took his right side beside the bed.
“Alright”, Fury interrupted. “I called you here, because… Stark, really? As I said it is 2 PM.”
“I don’t think so. Steve doesn’t feel anything like a dame, and… Maybe when we get Antonio stabilized we need a little chat with him.”
“Against those losers?” It was so odd to see the archer grinning. Barton hadn’t had nothing much to laugh about recently. “I bet Spidey could have handled them alone, but Steve is always such a mother hen. Or adrenaline junkie. Maybe both. What do you wanna watch? A war movie? Hey, do you have
Maybe that had been a mistake of his old, foolish hart. “Son of a bitch”, Fury mumbled, looking at the sight below him in the lab. He had read Rogers and Stark’s report, interrogated them himself, but seeing this with his own eye was still spooky.
“Come on, Jake. Let’s get rid off the trash.”
“It is so cute!”
“We could”, the other Steve admitted. “And we could still be naughty, I bet alcohol doesn’t have any effect on you as it does not have on me, but do you like to smoke? And I mean tobacco, that other thing is still illegal in our state.”
“If it was me, I would be searching the mansion right now”, Steve was saying. “Are you sure there is nothing in our old stuff that the other Steve can find and use to harm us?”
Fury waited to hear a displeased grunt which always followed Stark’s endearments, but maybe Rogers had now other things in his mind. He pushed and twisted something and the armor Stark was wearing started fall apart at the seams. Soon Stark was standing there without his metal cover, wearing only black onesie.
Nothing much had happened. The guard had greeted him, said he was glad that Mr. Stark seemed to be recovering. He mentioned something about the weather and Steve answered, explaining about fresh air and how that had always helped his own recovery, but it seemed he didn’t need to bother. A black SUV drove in and stopped outside the white and red bar, and the guard had to focus on the newcomer, so Steve had continued walking when the bar was lifted for the car. He had started to realize how bad their situation was, because that was it, literally the end of the road. Barton’s leering and his stupid jokes, reminding their bending trial had been just a trigger. They were trapped in this strange universe were the homosexual acts led the perpetrators to the gallows, and Antonio…
“Is that so. I am good, but thank you, Natalia.”
It was tested right now.
Yes, after his catastrophic relationship attempts with Gail and their Janet Antonio was maybe allowed to say things like that to him. It still made Steve want to hit his fist in the wall. This was exactly what he was talking about. So confusing. If Antonio liked women too why did he then…
“Did he? I don’t recall. Wasn’t he playing that Wilkes character in
He didn’t want to wait. But he had to. “It is like in a fucking war”, he mumbled. “Only dryer.”
“I knew it! Sam, I told you… he looked so much like Stark, that guy must have been a son of one of his mistresses’...”
He had nothing to say to that one. If he had liked to say something, it would have been impossible right now. His heart had started pounding so fast his ears ringed as his lungs tried to get more oxygen into his bloodstream. Any other person, and they would have said he was on the verge of a panic attack. That was impossible of course, Captain America didn’t have anything to do with some ninny business these modern people were so good at.
Barton whistled. “Oh shit, Nat. I knew your feelings were hurt when Steve here started name calling, but you shouldn’t need to make us a new one. What if he hates you too? Then we have to listen to them in stereo, and he is so old I doubt he comes with DTS sound.”
Oh how Steve was being cocky! He slid his hand slowly down over his stomach, turning his sensible words into a pure filth. Tony god honest whimpered. His neck was blushed and he moistened his lips. Howard had been a handsome fella in a slick, big city way Steve could appreciate, but his son was something else. If there were male sirens, Tony was a descent of those. He didn’t want nothing more than to mess Tony’s combed hair again and suck that delicious looking skin until his pulse points throbbed beneath his probing tongue. But Fury had decided Steve was going to be the leader of the Avengers. A proper leader couldn’t do decisions only with his dick.
Tony cleared his throat. “SteveToo, there is something I want to...”
“Yes, Virginia Potts. Tony’s fiancee.”
“Not at all”, Steve said calmly. “Let’s hope he is more sappy guy than me, those really tough ones usually are.”
“Oh… sure”, Tony stammered, still not believing his ears, and then Steve was already pulling his T-shirt over his head. He stopped, the shirt halfway down his arms and looked at Tony with serious eyes. “I am not doing it to you, you know.”
“Not what?”
He didn’t stay to listen as Janet oiled the guy for details. He rushed into the garage. Those at least were places which had chanced only a little from his time. Maybe he wouldn’t have seen most of the electric tools they used nowadays, but unlike with those pesky controls and computers, he could guess what they were used for or how. On the floor there were dark stains he knew were motor oil. Over them though…
“I wasn’t worried.” He really wasn’t, only annoyed. “What the fuck is his problem… Oh, sorry, ma’am.”
“What would you know”, he hissed, throwing the towel on the bed. “A perfect hero with your perfect team and perfect family. With your nice, perfect Tony”, he added, unable to wipe bitterness out of his words.
“Tony! Take a break.”
He left Nat in the balcony and shot upwards. Clint had already shot Steve with his net arrow and while the super soldier tried to sort himself out of the mess, it was easy for Tony to disarm him.
Then she was given an order which would turn her life upside down. She should expose and kill an American superhero, Iron Man.
“I didn’t mean his medical condition. In this same situation, I would have killed our Tony, fast and painless.”
Then it all crashed back into his mind. Mechanoids! They had been fighting... Where was Steve? Was he hurt too? Tony tried to call his teammate, but his dry mouth let out only faint, raspy sounds. He tried again and now he succeed better, but nobody answered.
“Or we are copies of them”, Stark corrected, after Fury had nodded he could speak. Really, spooky. “Or we both are copies from some third party. Reed Richards of theirs, he had this interesting theory the universe would keep inside infinite amount of possibilities. That was the problem in his original equation, which he couldn’t solve. He could have sent us away, but he had no means to pinpoint the right place from those infinite possibilities, so there was no sense to risk it. Just think about it, an infinite amount of Tony Starks, flashing their genius and extremely cute butts. But as Steve said, there were differences too. Pepper and Natasha looked exactly like our Pepper and Nat, but were completely opposites as persons. Anthony Stark looked only a bit like me, but he had invented an armor almost like mine.”
“Oh hey, Nat”, Tony’s voice answered. “I am just coding… now is not a good moment… if you could call back later and… hey, did you get me that strawberry chocolate I asked?”
The thought made him feel angry and betrayed. They were strangers, but he had already liked them a little, even that cunt Romanoff… No, probably not her, but the others. They had seemed to be so no-nonsense about his and Antonio’s situation that Steve had thought they would really make it back home. And instead…
“Tony! Focus! He in probably on his feet again and you know how fast he runs. I don’t want to be there when he catches me up. I have to hide. I got an idea. Follow my signal.”
The elevator pinged and somebody stepped to the lounge. His body tried to tense, but it was at the end of its tether, he could hardly move his head to look at the newcomer.
Steve tried anyway. His scream of rage and pain made Tony halt his explanations. Tony was... maybe he was drugged or under some spell. He sounded different, like he was not totally coherent, not knowing what to say, and that wasn’t normal; Antonio Stark was the most eloquent man on God’s green earth.
The other Tony was staring at him, a nervous twist in the corner of this lips. “Maybe he really hates that wall”, he whispered to Barton, who nodded, mock serious.
“Yeah, sure. I will start, we can always rewind back to that opening scene. That is the best part of the movie… but take your time, Cap. It is just me and all those heroes of Omaha beach. All the real, real man.”
Their prisoner was still sleeping and it pissed Fury off for some reason. Maybe the thing was pretending.
As if they had been only waiting Nat’s sure words, meters started blinking on the left corner of the dashboard.
, Steve wondered. He didn’t catch the sound the second time, but the smell of sweat with its familiar mingle of booze and chemicals lingered in the air for a long time. Was the joke on him, the team, or Tony himself, he couldn’t decide.
“Your funeral”, Sam mumbled. He had been warming leftover pancakes in the microwave and came now sitting next to Clint, who had pushed the pause button to talk with Sam.“What are you watching… Oh crap, Clint! Don’t say you were going to show that to a WW2 veteran.”
“You can do it to me, if you please.”
“A game? Not quite. And that would be like leaving half out of it. I am not exactly like you, darling. I like women too.”
“Barton, shut up! Stark, put your fucking clothes on! Nobody wants to see your scrawny ass! Captain Rogers, are you alright?”
“Brother Monster, I don’t understand what that means”, Thor said, when Steve peppered him with the questions. “I don’t understand your agitation. There is always a war going on. I have fought in hundreds of wars during hundreds of years in all the worlds of nine realms. One is no different from the other. Only the honor matters. We fight with honor and skill to avoid the bony grip of Hela, Loki’s grim daughter, Mistress of the Underworld. After we die, we go Valhalla instead. Here. Sit! Take more mead!”
He could have explained it to himself he was cold. His wound was still bleeding, maybe he had lost too much blood, he was going to shock. It was that too, but it just wasn’t the whole truth, was it? It had to be at least two days, his head tried to burst through his eyes, and no pain meds to keep the feeling away. But that was only a part of it. There were other things his chemical balance was lacking too, and Steve would have said he deserved this, deserved this pain and humiliation because he had done this to himself. That stupid armor, which he couldn’t operate without a horde of tech support, his body which he had weakened during his adult years with his constant drinking, everything in him was so disgustingly weak, no wonder he was never Fury’s first choice to important missions. No wonder Steve would never…
“I made a quick scan and it was negative for both... Wait a minute! What did you mean that I am not Tony Stark?”
So started the twitter war of the decade. A social media tsunami, which rolled around ordinary people as well as politicians and influential celebrities. There were congratulations, from private people and organizations. There were demands that Steve Rogers should step aside as a leader of the Avengers. Anything any people had even thought in his or her mind was said aloud, for and against. But one, maybe insignificant tweet among all that political, cultural, and historical heavy talk which was later analyzed by social science researchers, stuck into Steve’s brain and he remembered it now, while looking at Tony, so near but still over his reach.
“Janet gal!”
“Maybe he knows something we don’t. It could be a Russian wall, ready to betray us.”
There was no way around it here. Nothing to distract him from his thoughts, so he sneaked to the fridge to get food, sneaked to the room the other Steve had arranged for him, hovered at the door of Antonio’s room, watching the nurse, who was chancing his drip. And Steve was thinking: that bed could be empty, Antonio could be dead. Not because of Barton, who was wise enough to stay elsewhere after the incident. Not because of the other Steve, but because of him. He had almost done that to Antonio.
“Be that as it might. Listen up, ladies.”
“Thanks, but it was many years ago. About this other thing. Do we have a deal?”
Janet nodded. “His father passed away. He will stay in his realm until situation stabilizes.”
Whatever that was.
“Alright”, Steve sighed. “Director is still insisting we do not engage. I would like to say it is because of the hostage, but...”
“Fuck! Why is the gas not working? He will soon be all over us.”
Bucky… James Buchanan Barnes. Could he be the same here? Still alive?
“I… I had almost forgotten. Tony got us new ones, and… Thank you, Sleepy.”
“We know.” The armor was now talking, and as gods would have wanted, there was no getting rid off Antonio Stark. “Steve was talking about the raid we were doing in the base of neo-Nazi organization. Steve, darling, let me out of this can, will you.”
She jerked backwards. The movement seemed involuntary.
He didn’t know? Steve who had fought four years in the biggest war seen by mankind? He who had risked the existence of his very race to make the horror and slaughter stop faster? The plan of the Elders had been a clever one. Elder Erskine was supposed to invent a so called super soldier serum, which would then “change” the young ones of their clan to superpowered champions of the nation. And then, maybe then they would be again like their ancestors had been under the rule of the great Alexander the Conqueror. They would be respected for their skills and power, not feared and persecuted like some fairy tale monsters lurking in the darkness.
“Alright!” he interrupted Anderson’s musings. “No evil magic. I got it. No magic of any kind. If you say so. How about a werewolf? That is only a matter of lycantrophic genes, isn’t it?”
They walked in an awkward silence down the corridor until their trail ended in front of the room-sized glass jar. Technically the walls of the cell weren’t glass, but unbelievable strong alien substance which would take a nuclear strike without a scratch, but Fury always called it glass, because its major ingredient was unpronounceable with human vocal chords. And it was see-through if they wanted it to be.
“Steve, maybe Antonio came here trying to repair his armor. I know our Tony would have done something like that if he noticed he is stranded in the strange universe somewhere far from home… Tony, anything?”
“Good afternoon, Captain. Tony explained the situation. That nanofluid you mentioned... Have you been in contact with it regularly?”
“We gave him a pig”, Fury protested, looking offended. “Bruce said he would probably want to hunt his meal.”
“Tony is still alive? Jesus, look at that hickey! Damn, I should have bet only about that, now I lost twenty bucks. Hey, Sanders! Could you make a copy of that surveillance tape? Split the profit?”
Then there were the most precious. The uniforms had their own track like helmets and boots and gloves had selves of their own, but he didn’t touch them. He chose dark blue jeans and a white T and a gray button down over his fancy, because he was sure that the other Steve hadn’t mean those when he said he could choose anything he wanted. The uniform was so much like his, but it wasn’t his for real, and he knew what he would have thought about any guy who dared to borrow one of his own without his permission.
Some instinct made him suck. It was not a hard decision, it was a gesture every infant mammal managed. Tony let out a whimper, which were getting loader when Steve repeated the gesture. Tony’s hand was not over his anymore. They roamed freely on his back and flanks, Tony moved his head to get a better angle for their kisses, pushed his fingers through his short hair to move his head.
For some reason, Steve also thought it was a splendid idea. Damn that fire wine!
“Please sit down, Captain. I see that Doctor Banner got you your new gear. How does that feel?”
It was a bag, for god’s sake. There was no reason for him to have a bad feeling about it, when the guy giving it to them didn’t look like a suicide bomber. But then the screen of the locator went crazy with all those blinking lights and she opened the zipper and he saw…
It was Captain Rogers, and he wasn’t at the same time. Like those other figures were not Janet Pym, Tony Stark, or James Barnes. Their Stark had been right. This newcomer could have fooled them. He was so much like their Rogers he could have been an illegal clone.
Steve wasn’t through the front door when Gail noticed his full finger. She raised her brow, but Steve shook his head. So they ate dinner, which was excellent as usual, even if Gail needed nowadays their home nurse’s help to cook it.
“Tony…” Pepper tried.
First Count Nefaria fiasco and now this. If they were a corporation, one could say their quarter report sucked.
“No coffee for him”, Nat said firmly. “He is still dehydrated and caffeine would make it only worse. He is going to drink more sport drinks and water, and after he has told us everything, he can eat. Not before, the food will make him pass out faster.”
Fury seemed like he was only a few seconds from the moment he would blow a gasket. “Barton, one more and you are out of this meeting”, he barked. “At ease, Captain Rogers. And welcome. I assume you know everyone.”
There would be lots of nasty bits, but the rest, maybe not so bad after all.
Would the other Steve have done that? Killed her? Really? He could be rough, bordering sadistic, as Janet had seen when they interrogated the goon who had taken Antonio. The thought made her shiver as she remembered their team leader’s other words.
“Yeah, man! We will get thousands from this tech.”
“Yes, Agent Willard. What is it?”
Was that it? Did they want to use Steve as their weapon? Maybe that was why this sudden change of tone.
“Why are you here?”
“Sure you are.”
“Excuse me. Captain... Thank god you are here! My grandfather was in Normandy… real honor, sir. I was about to call the police.”
“Detainment with a minimum damage for the public safety, that is our goal. The Avengers Initiative is a wholesome face of superpowered community and enjoys wide public trust. It has taken us years of work and diligent cultivation of public opinion to get this far.”
There was a brief surprised silence and then Barton started laughing. And not only him, also Banner let out a brief giggle which was soon sunken under Thor’s booming jolliness.
“Not like your Pepper, I presume”, his counterpart mumbled.
“Maybe you are not totally objective in this”, Nat said. “I got an impression you were getting along quite well before he showed you his interrogation techniques. Just think for a moment that Fury has something here. It could be that our visitors lied. Maybe they coming here wasn’t an accident at all and SteveToo’s worried act was just like that, an act. What better way to make them seem harmless than to play a part of the helpless victim.”
“But what?” Steve asked, when the silence seemed to linger. He had also noticed the fleeing looks Sam were giving towards Clint, who had observed their powwow exceptionally quiet.
“Steve, darling. Nobody is going to hurt anybody. We prepare and use a ton of lube and… Let’s forget that thing for a moment. I don’t ask about Gail because I am sure she didn’t… but did Janet give you head?”
“Yes, Nat told me. His story of her nastier skills I can comprehend, we all know Nat could take over the world if she wanted to, but that some poor woman would have made children with Barton, that thought is like from some tragicomic fairy tale.”
“Stark, I said shut the fuck up!”
“What… Tony!”
There had been an incident last week. Fury said it was something called programming error, but Steve knew better, it had been Tony in his cups. “I have been watching the recordings of our team in action. Last week you almost killed that little girl, Tony. And I have seen dead little girls to last me a lifetime.”
“Don’t get greedy, Stark.”
“Isn’t that swell”, Steve sighed. “Alright, people. Listen up. A chance of plans...”
Steve’s muscles screamed with agony after pummeling for hours unyielding metal bodies. The buildings around him should be in ruins, the smoke from the burning cars filling the air… But there was no signs of their on-going battle with that alien menace, he was in the busy street somewhere which looked like Manhattan (how had he moved there from Long Island?). Tony was gone, and people walking past him in the sidewalk were looking at him curiously. Some of them had taken out their phones, taking videos or pictures, as Steve turned desperately this way and that, trying to decipher what had happened. This could not be real, but Tony was nowhere to be seen. His teammate was badly hurt and Steve had lost him. How?
“A movie star.”
“Are you accusing me of something, Stark?”
“But... you look normal.”
After he had waken up from the ice he had seen many strange things and fought many hard battles. This wasn’t in top ten.
Antonio had been afraid that… but no, Steve was not coming towards the bed like a sacrifice lamb, but not like a prowling big cat either, more like a curious, eager puppy.
Again this. No Tony, he would not consider surrendering to a bunch of complete a-holes, who were just waiting Tony to get better that he wouldn’t raise pity in judges or public watching his trial. There was no hiding. No matter where Steve would go, they could track him with those nanoparticles. And what good would that do for him when Tony was gone.
That was at variance with her former, comforting words. “A hunch?”
Steve didn’t know should he go or stay. He didn’t like the way Tony passed out right away, because it couldn’t be natural. Hopefully, the pills were just harmless sleeping aids like barbiturates. Steve listened to Tony’s breathing. Even if Tony seemed to be alright, Steve knew himself: it would be useless to go to his bed. He couldn’t get any sleep when he worried about Tony.
The question was for both of them but Tony’s eyes were now on Steve. His whole demeanor was like a maiden’s who was surprised naked in the lake. Perhaps Steve had been staring. There was no trace of suave gentleman in a fine suit. Tony was wearing a ratty T-shirt and sweats. His hair was all over the place and dark skin circled his eyes.
“I am sure it did.”
“Well, duty calls”, Tony said, putting down his glass. He gave a few brotherly taps on Steve’s shoulder and was gone again, mingling with these wealthy and famous people of the NYC, who ate his presence like bees ate honey. Steve had to move, or he was forced to chat with Thor who was glimpsing his way time to time. For some reason, the alien prince was the most uncomplicated of the lot. Before their abduction they had changed a few friendly words while lingering in the kitchen. Steve had warmed some milk and Thor was eating cookies: warriors and their bad dreams and insomniac ways.
Make up your mind, Fury”, he mumbled and took a long sip. “What did you want to show me?”
“Why would I trust some commie cunt, who has sucked treason from the tits of Mother Russia! You pox-ridden whore! You think this is because I am little sore at you. Never mind that SHIELD captured and tortured me because of your crimes. You betrayed Tony! He was your fiance and you tried to steal his fortune and kill him! You let your cronies butcher Clint’s wife and children! You shot Jarvis in the head and plotted with our enemies to conquer our nation!”
It had been that famous one time between them, but what most people didn’t know, their fumbling, painful act of love and curiosity had its severe consequences. After Steve had gone missing, Gail noticed she was pregnant. The government didn’t want a scandal which a bastard child of their national icon would have been during those days. They took her son away and lied to her he had been adopted into a decent family. In reality, he grew up in a military base with soldiers and scientist until adulthood. His leaving home was something else though. It turned out he had just played a role of an obedient soldier boy, biting his time, and when that time came, he killed every living soul in the camp, making it a flashy start for his career as a psychotic, murdering gun for hire.
… vampire. But you…”
“No, not the boots, but… You.”
, Fury thought bitterly. Now they had a supersoldier whose main reason for being was to watch nobody talked back to his sweetheart.
“Back off”, Steve grunted to his comm between the hits. “I will handle this.”
Thor was swept away to the dance floor by a horde of glittering debutantes. Tony was now chatting with a woman of his own age, who seemed to have problems keeping herself upright. Or was there any other reason for that proprietorial grip from Tony arm? Steve’s instincts were screaming it should be him. He should be the only one touching Tony that way, but…
“Doctor Richards”, he said his voice shaking with tiredness and hardly contained anger. “Are you really implying that you are not going to help Antonio, if you are not getting a strip tease from me like right now?”
Fury ripped the piece from his ear. He probably didn’t want to say anything so unsavory that HR-department was forced to send him an angry e-mail.
He picked up a few bottles. His temper tantrum seemed childish now. Suddenly he was so thirsty he felt sand on his tongue.
“Yeah, as you said. You are not one of those great minds. Come here, you big oaf”, the other Rogers said. The leader of the Avengers put his arm around his former comrade in arms and hugged him again. Rogers pushed his jaw onto his shoulder and left it there, and it seemed to Fury they hadn’t been doing it the first time. His voice had gotten hoarse as he explained: “Bucky had cancer. He had been ill so long. It was expected. Even a relief. For him and Gail too. She would be happy to see you, James. I have told her about you enough times.”
“So… there is really no Mechanoid infusion in Long Island?”
“So… Alright. I think… this about us”, Tony confirmed. Steve nodded. His cheeks had gained that endearing light pinkish tinge, and Tony felt how saliva started gathering into his mouth. “We could negotiate. Yes, of course, darling. There are few things I actually don’t do, like never. I hate strangling, even the playful kind. Or any excretions...”
“Stand down! Get Rogers and Stark here. Asap!”
“In that other place, you mean.”
“Immortal kiss”, his son was now whispering. “You made a deal.”
When it was put in that way, it sounded pathetic. Like being tough meant he was making himself weak, maybe not in the body, but in many other aspects of life.
“We have to find that other guy first.”
That was finally an easy order to follow. He had no energy to wonder why he believed all those other things too.
“Alright, my father was a conductor”, she mumbled. “No trains! We lived in Saint Petersburg when… No farmers, no.
“Good. Now when we are all on the same page, we have to start deciding how to introduce your particularities to the media. Our PR department has some ideas, and I can discuss about them with you later. Then there is a practical question where you should live. The SHIELD personnel without residence are naturally welcomed to live in the base, but if we think your inclusion into the modern times, it would be better if you lived elsewhere. Maybe in Stark Tower with the rest of the team?”
She reached with her hands and the man gave her the piglet. It wriggled, didn’t like the way they moved it through the air. When it was safe in her lap, it calmed down again.
The monster came closer. When it was about three yards from her, it halted, taking a deep breath, smelling the air around her. Then it let out a sneeze. Her mouth opened with surprise to hear such a mundane, humane thing.
“You want me to return the favor?” he asked, his heart pounding. He was already moving his hand, the question had been only common courtesy. Why wouldn’t Tony want to orgasm? But Tony’s next flippant words put the end to his movement as efficiently as somebody had severed his arm.
“Where you there when I woke up?”
The silence that followed his question was an answer in itself. Fury sighed again. Rogers didn’t do anything halfway, did he? Too bad he needed a whole new universe to get his ass out of the closet.
For long minutes, they lay there like beached, misshaped whales. The smells of musk, cum, blood, and sweat lingered heady in the air, making Steve’s mind spin. He collected Tony into his arms and licked first his neck, then his chest and abdomen which were covered with white stripes of Tony’s semen.
“Whoa! Hold your horses, big guy. Nobody is trying to rattle open the door of your itchy-bitchy closet.”
he ordered his body.
“Red Skull!” he shouted lifting his prize high over his head. “Why do you still send your underlings against me? Why do you still test me? You know what I can do! You can sent down the whole pantheon of your false gods, I will fight them all! I will never give up! Do you hear me, you Nazi filth! I don’t care if you and your lot have run over the whole world! Freedom and democracy will rise again! People will rise against you and your foul ideas! If you think Sarah Rogers raised quitters then you better think again!”
It had been only an hour when Tony started whimpering and trashing in his bed. A measly hour. No wonder Tony didn’t want to sleep. Why bother, when you didn’t rest anyway?
“That... thing”, Steve said and clarified his opinion with some PG-13 hand gestures, which were so endearing Tony watched them a lump in his throat. Steve was meaning penetration.
“You got a fiancee... How did that work for you?”
It was one of the nicest things ever said to him.
Steve cursed himself. During his time in the SHIELD compound and the Stark Tower he was used to eat so much and so regularly he didn’t have his endurance anymore.
This universe had the Stark mansion, that was right, but the place seemed abandoned. The windows were dark. They were not covered with panels and tarpaulins, this was too good neighborhood for that, and after he had broken the lock in the door, he saw the place was far from the crack house the team had found Antonio. It was clearly uninhabited but somebody looked after it, and he wondered if he had launched some of those fancy electronic alarms with his burglary.
“How about...”
“Captain Danvers. Take a memo. Start vetting suitable orphaned children. Call a heads up to the PR-department, and… they probably suggest the kid should be PoC, I think. Well...”
“That guy gave me a few names. People who have access to this place, that kind of thing. I put them forward to Tony. He is checking them out right now. We should soon get some results.”
Tony was nice and loose after his tongue. Steve was still planning to take it slow, but Tony was as patient as always, pushing into his fingers and moaning like a two bit whore, except for Tony that wasn’t an act. No, Tony was not voicing his pleasure to get rid of Steve as soon as possible. His chest and face were flushed and he shivered every time Steve scissored his thick fingers inside his hole.
Steve didn’t try to keep him on the bed. He had said his piece and now was Tony’s turn to make a decision. His feet were already turning towards the closet which hid his stash of booze. Steve heart sank. But no, he hadn’t thought it would really be that easy.
...and now he was talking to his dick. Really, Antonio?
“Talk about yourself”, Clint mumbled. “I am one cool badass.”
Fury could hear it. The howling of the alarm would have raised the death and made them annoyed in the process. It did the same to Fury, but for another reason. It was
In one of their rooftop meetings, after his and Tony’s wedding, the other Steve had mentioned how lucky they were, meaning their unfamiliarity to the general public. Then he had showed what kind of “congratulations” he had received when he had come out of the closet, and again after he had married Bucky. There were the usual rude words and death threats, but the hardest ones to bear were the people lamenting how Steve Rogers had now ruined Captain America, their childhood hero. How it would have been better for everybody, if he had died in the war and saved the nation from this disgrace.
“Odin’s beard”, Thor mumbled. “Brother Monster, please release Mjolnir. I think my comrades in arms are laughing at us in their magic device.”
“Wrong info? SteveToo already saw that we live elsewhere. Maybe some kind of symbolic strike?”
“My brain is fine. I even remember the Avengers Initiative is not officially started, so technically Bruce and I are not teammates. Close acquaintances? Yes. But...”
“Well, no. In our universe he is a human being, but his relationship with Reed is strained at best. The last time Tony checked, they were pummeling each others. The Fantastic Four managed to escape Doom’s first deathtrap, and… the nerds and their nerd grudges… Let’s hope they get it sorted out as soon as possible.”
“Stark! I will not repeat myself!”
“That played well with the Krauts, sir.”
“No”, Janet said with a kind smile. “This is not alien tech, but actually one we have been looking for. We highly value your diligence and co-operation in this matter.”
Steve listened (somehow he always seemed to listen very carefully when Tony talked, expecting some kind of gay trap, perhaps?) and he seemed to buy it. Of course. It probably wouldn’t occur to Steve that his teammate would be dishonest enough to lie to him. Or to bend the truth for his own benefit, even if in his mind Tony said he was doing it for Steve.
It shouldn’t hurt. That was what he had always admired in Steve. His honesty and loyalty. Even if Janet and he were not really together, they were not being either. “That is totally understandable. This situation… it is no wonder you miss her.”
“Thanks, Nat. Did they mentioned anything about the hostage?”
“Hope this espresso works… Lots of it, he seems like he is about to collapse.”
Antonio was giving up. Of course he was, it was for Steve, so it was almost a patriotic act. Tony felt very noble indeed, but how come the supersoldier continued to look like things were not going the way he wanted?
“Oh Steve. That was so long time ago. I am sure your friend would have forgiven you, of course he would. I did Steve, when you asked me to.”
He pushed the door open and then they were on the roof. The flying vehicle was in the usual place, its hatch door now open. There were two figures standing on the ramp, the other Steve and some unfamiliar black guy in a red and white uniform. They seemed to be deep in conversation, which ended when he and Janet came along.
“The… the package. Do you mean..?”
“Yes”, SteveToo said. The glowing net was suddenly gone and he stood up, locking his knees and standing at parade rest as his host continued the introductions. “That guy with the worst one liners in town is Clint Barton aka Hawkeye, and Tony Stark… Anthony, actually, not Antonio. Our invincible Iron Man and a tech genius, the designer of the sci-fi goodies you will see around here. There are others, but they are on a mission or rotating their free days, so you are not going to meet them at least today. We are part of the SHIELD’s strike team against superpowered or extraterrestrial threats. We are called the Avengers. Do you have something like that in your universe?”
“Agent Tailor here. The subject bought drinks and snacks and is now heading back to his car.”
“Seal the doors!” he shouted to his comm when he was out of the room. “Gas its ass! Now!” He elbowed himself through agents milling at the door. Another door and a few steps, and he was back in the observation deck where Stark had been watching the scene unravel. Stark was pale under his tan. Maybe it was because of all the blood or the flask which lay empty on the floor.
“Why don’t you give Steve some lack, Fury? Eighteen months is a long time. Were thought we were stranded in that universe. We made friends. We lived and fought among them, started to built life and home. And now it all is just gone.”
“Super soldier serum”, Doctor Banner was mumbling. “I suspected it could preserve his cells on some level, but like this… this is incredible.”
, Steve thought, taking a glass.
“Director, there is no concealing the magical rot of living dead. There should be a clear evil presence. Even hair should stand in your head and blood curl in your veins, if we are talking about a vampire strong enough to pull off a feat Captain performed in the lab. But there is nothing. Whatever he is, he is not a vampire in a way our dimension has used to deal with those dead husks and their malignant spirits. Magically I could as well be looking at an average human being. His aura looks quite nice, actually. A perfect balance on his every hue. His reds for example: so grounded, strong-willed, energetic, sexual, and passionate. But also sensitive, artistic...”
But a Nazi spy had skilled Erskine before he was able to complete their plan. Steve had been the first one, a pretty-faced specimen to prove the serum’s worth to politicians and Army generals, and then he was all alone. What he had seen this far, or rather not seen, told him his people were still hiding if they had not been found out and discreetly murdered by the government during his long sleep. Just like the Nazis had tried to do to the children of Abraham.
“Straight to the point, I like that. Alright. As long I am here, we have private time. The cameras are showing in the control room a computer reduced piece where we talk something else altogether. Anyway, I have been reading my dad’s old archives. I want to make the same deal he had with you. You see, I am influential man”, the little prick continued, the teasing, smug expression never leaving his face. “I can easily get you out of here. Fury and the SHIELD don’t know what to do with you, and they would be thrilled me taking this problem out of their clumsy, governmental hands. I am not only that influential, I am rich too, actually a billionaire, so money won’t be a problem. I can give you wealth over your imagination. Anything you want.”
That earned him a curious twist of that pretty nose. “How do I look in your universe then?”
“No, I bet they don’t”, Steve admitted. “They are right about it though. He was a bad man. Murdered his own brother.”
“You are not exactly a prisoner here, more like in quarantine. That is just one thing I would like to talk with you about. You knew my father.”
“We had a fight, and now I feel bad about it… Nat, what is it?”
Years were hours, decades were days. There were too many faces and names to remember the day after.
That suggestion earned Steve a lucky boot in his nether regions. That was also the moment Antonio Stark staggered out from the front door. He was supported by Janet, or half-carried was maybe more accurate description. Janet might be short in her original form also, but she was no way a powerless and frail insect.
The uniform felt like it was glued to his skin by sweat and blood and that odd substance those Mechanoids had leaked all over them. Fifteen minutes was too much time to wait, but too little time to soak himself free. He ended up cleaning his face and hands. The bathroom was warm, and his eyelids began to droop with weariness but he yanked them open, rubbed away the green goo, which made his fingers glitter in the light. It felt partly like he was rubbing away Antonio himself, and the feeling of anxious displacement made him bite his teeth harder together.
“No! Not in that way at least… Sorry, no, no war. We thought you would feel more comfortable if you had something familiar to wear. Tony made it according the old film materials and his dad’s designs.”
The big and vaguely familiar hands were pushing him back to the bed. They were pulling the duvet around him and not letting go until he lay quietly on the mattress. “At ease, soldier. The perimeter is secure. Now, just try to get some sleep. Your watch will come soon enough.”
“Hugs and kisses, and I awarded her with a rate A gossip”, Steve promised, waving his full ring finger in front of his friend’s face. “Please, don’t sell me to paparazzi.”
“This is the one you have been waiting for, you big fussy! Let’s go! Let’s dance then!”
“Steve is a little sore about it, you know. It was only a standard psych evaluation and orientation course. He asked for it himself. To clear his head, you know. The thing you should have arranged for him when we dug him out of ice.”
He passed out.
When Steve noticed what was on the workbench, his eyes released poor Tony as he took involuntary step forward. It was Iron Man. Or its arm.
He tried to sit up, which turned out to be a bad idea. First, his armor was dead, so no moving for Tony in a near future. Secondly, jerking his body made a lighting of pain shot through his rib cage and chest, indicating he probably had gained some internal damages. No, he thought, when the tell-tale numb feeling started to move from his fingertips to the other parts of his body and his eyes sparkled with tiny lights.
A little stinger, perhaps. It had been Steve’s initiative. He had started the kiss and ripping off his clothes like a horny tart. There was no reason for them to badmouth Tony all the time. That was Steve’s plan, but it backfired spectacularly.
“Tony… uh, no. We have sometimes common science projects, he and I, but for the SHIELD he is only a part-time civilian consultant. Not Director Fury’s favorite, I am afraid. And now, after his little stunt... No, Tony will not be here for a long time.”
“Steve will do better. Well, Natasha. Have you been here often?”
“Alright. Can I connect the other Steve to our comms now or do you still want to keep him out of the loop?”
“I see. Have a nice meeting then.”
“Let’s go to our living quarters. Then you can tell us about yourself and this Antonio. Do you think he is also here somewhere? And how did you actually get here?”
That said, the other Steve returned to the stove. He was making pancakes, blueberry ones, as he noticed after raising the heat retaining cover. He moved a good pile onto his plate and stuffed it with syrup.
“Y-yes. I am b-being sensible, a-am I? I w-want to be…”
Rogers managed to look as if Fury had spat him into the eye. “I would call it a little more than that, sir. We got married two months ago.”
