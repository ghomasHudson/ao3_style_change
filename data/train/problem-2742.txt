“You also like prime numbers and trench coats,” Dean says wryly. He grins. “Sometimes you’re just way off base, man.”
Dean pulls back, but he keeps both hands on Cas’s upper arms just to feel him. Solid. Warm. Alive. “You okay?”
Jo pokes her head out, looking askance at the pair of them. “Are you still out here?” She glares at Dean. “Stop complaining about your diet, and let Castiel come back to work.”
Cas laves his tongue over Dean’s dick a few more times, slowly, savoring the taste like a fucking gourmand. Which - flattering, but also totally not what Dean needs right now. He squirms on the bed, trying to get more of Cas’s mouth on him.
Dean chokes on nothing, eyes wide and panicked. “What the fuck dude? And you let me spill my guts like that?”
Eventually, Dean raises his hand just to get Cas’s eyes back on him, and he has to fumble his way through a point about similes.
Castiel shivers, lowering his head to slot his chin against Dean’s neck and worry the skin over his mating gland.
“That’s right,” Cas says, and Dean imagines him smiling. “You mentioned it during your order. How was the fit?”
“I’ve given it a fair amount of thought,” Cas says as he methodically strips Dean of his flannel and shirt. “What I would do to your body if I had the chance. How I would use my knowledge of human anatomy and physiology to give you pleasure.”
Cas holds back his wince. He didn’t see Dean as more than a tool for Heaven back when they first met. Dean was the Righteous Man first, a human being second. “My apologies.”
” Cas whispers like a confession. “Kelly, she was so positive I was the person for this, but I’m starting to doubt her judgement.”
Benny just scowls at a nearby tree, clearly not enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of the park near Dean and Sam’s first hotel at all.
“I know nothing of the sort,” Cas says gravely, and, by the way Dean chuckles, he knows Cas’s ignorance is feigned.
“Pride Man,” Cas deadpans, lifting his cape with one hand like there was any way Dean could have missed it.
He finds Daphne in one of the far booths, tucked away with Castiel and Dean, surprise, surprise. After snagging another beer at the bar, he slides in next to Daphne. “What’s up?” he asks the three of them.
Sam hurls a demon bomb the Empty, and the vibrations to the floor of Hell itself almost make Dean drop the second vial of blood.
Cas hesitates. “Would you like to go to Nine Spheres instead? I’ve had business dinners every evening I’ve been in Chicago so far, and, while the food has been
“He’s me?” Dean asks, his expression completely confused. His gun lowers, but he doesn’t stow it away.
She stops by the Language Office, pleasantly surprised to find it empty. No Dean, Kelly, or Castiel in sight. Daphne quickly gathers her freshmen pop quizzes to grade this weekend and her copy of
Dean nods slowly, unable to look away from Cas’s face. “So you figured you’d pick up Audrey II before you blast Pleasant Town off the map?”
Jo all but slams Dean’s latte on the ledge above the sink. “You know the health inspector is here. I can’t let Ruby near the guy, and you know how Kevin gets around figures of authority.”
you didn’t time travel, but me you did,” his Dean says, lowering his hands and fishing around in his bag. Silently, he tosses Cas a fun sized Almond Joy.
Dean, wide-eyed, nods, so Castiel gets back to the task at hand. “You are beautiful,” he repeats into Dean’s skin, the tops of Dean’s thighs, the sensitive skin between his knees, the heel of his foot.
“It’s a legitimate area of study,” Castiel assures him. “I research music as it pertains to culture and diverse elements of social life. Ethnomusicology focuses not only on the music itself but music as a social process, as a medium for humans to relate to each other. In short, it examines how music functions in a particular society.”
Cas leaps to his feet, on his guard. “Watch Jack,” he tells Dean. Without waiting for an answer, he takes off down the stairs. His blade slides into his hand smooth as quicksilver, and he grips it firmly.
Novak lifts one shoulder in a half-shrug. “She used far more expletives, but that was the general idea.”
Dean unclenches one hand from Cas’s lapel. He reaches up to cup Cas’s jaw, the raspy stubble a physical reminder of the goddamn win he’s finally getting. His knees twinge from awkwardly leaning over, but rampaging Leviathans could burst into the kitchen and Dean wouldn’t give any less of a fuck.
“James Hetfield, John Bonham, or is it Angus Young?” cuts in the blonde girl, appearing by their table and holding,
words like they’re nothing and everything, and added his life goal was not dying before spending the rest of his human life with Dean.
Castiel shrugs. “It depends on if you want to walk through those doors in the first place.” He inhales a sharp breath. “When I was younger, I really wanted to be a beekeeper.”
Family love, sure. Cas might love all his haloed siblings. Cas has been around for all the Top 10 worst decisions that are the Winchesters’ version of brotherly devotion. Cas even said the big L-word out loud himself, when he was bleeding out in that barn a month ago.
“I take it you’re not in favor?” Castiel asks, reaching for the paper ball and smoothing it over curiously.
“There you go,” Rowena says, lifting her nose into the air. “Most men don’t have that innate knack for the magical arts.” She turns to Sam, giving him the most obvious come-hither look Dean has ever seen. “There are some obvious exceptions, of course.”
I don’t know how to say this over the phone and I have no idea when they’ll send me back out to the Midwest, so by letter it goes. This is my fifth draft of the stupid thing, so hopefully it gets the point across. I’ve met someone. She’s nice and human, and she even has a kid.
“A guy, then,” Dean says to make sure they’re on the same page - because last time he checked, waves of celestial intent cared less about acing a Gender and Sexuality 101 class and more about whether a meatsuit could withstand a holy oil molotov cocktail.
Jesus Christ, how many pairs of shoes did this woman bring? He backtracks and shuts the door behind him, breathing heavily. Pissed off and confused, he makes his way back to the office.
Castiel crawls up the bed, his cock hanging heavy between them over Dean’s spent body. “How are you feeling?”
Castiel doesn’t say anything for a long moment. “Very similar to how he is now,” he says, which doesn’t tell Aaron much. “Charming. Caring. Intelligent in the strangest of ways.” Castiel pauses. “Handsome.”
and getting Kelly and Daphne so they can witness the big reveal with him, is still rooted to the spot as the door bursts open and
“Christ,” Dean gasps as Cas licks a long stripe up his cock, root to tip. He gets one flash of brilliant blue eyes before Cas ducks his head, swallows Dean down, and sucks like his life depends on it.
He let Cas drag him to one LGBTQ Students Association fundraiser at the beginning of term (Cas also invited Meg and Akobel from their class) so he met Charlie. He’s ran into her a handful of times since - the hair makes it easy to pick her out of a dining hall crowd.
Gabriel even stops by once Chuck starts slurring his words. “Think it’s time to cut you off, old man,” Gabriel says as he leaves a pitcher of water on the table. He surveys them all thoughtfully. “So these are your replacement kids?”
“You don’t have to tell me twice,” Deans says fervently, internally groaning as Crowley texts again, just a very judgmental question mark. “Okay, I really gotta go. See you in five or fifteen, depending on how much pity Crossroads’ hostess takes on me.”
Castiel throws him an incredulous look. “How do you expect to get anywhere without a senior keycard? I’m coming with you.”
“And yet you went along with it anyway,” Dean says, slumping over so he can lay horizontally on the bench in his own cell. His boots make a muffled thump as he props them up, bending his knees so he can rest them against the wall.
Dean nearly busts a gut as he takes in Cas, striding towards him from across the quad. A giant rainbow flag trails behind Cas, tied in a secure knot around his throat like a cape.
prepared to take that secret to his grave, but Showerus had to go hit that pre-chorus like an oncoming, warbly, freight train, so Dean joined in with,
Without looking at him, Dean asks, “Lemme guess, you need a shitton of rare ingredients delivered that we don’t have here?”
Cas knows him, knows him better than anyone except Sam. And despite all the fucked up shit in Dean's head, Cas is staying anyway, with his eyes wide open like nobody else Dean has ever been with.
Aaron, almost offended on Castiel’s behalf, opens his mouth as he catches sight of Castiel’s face, lips pressed tight together like he’s trying not to laugh. “You knew?”
“Plenty of people can’t swim,” Dean says, not getting why Cas kept this a secret at all, “It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Andrea didn't even go in the water.”
“I’ve been living with my cousin while I’m in graduate school at Columbia,” Castiel explains, his tone apologetic for his earlier comment, “and he has a horrendous sweet tooth. I don’t think he’s ever seen a carrot that wasn’t in a cake first.”
Cas pets him on the head. He feels a little dry, but nothing to get worried about yet. “I try not to think about them - Jack should be more than enough to keep me occupied - but I can’t help myself sometimes.”
Dean grins as he makes a show of wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “Sorry, man. We’ll go… somewhere else next time.”
Dean sticks out like a flannel-wearing sore thumb. “Cas,” he hisses, “hold on. I don’t think I’m dressed right for this place.”
. He scrolls through the options until he comes across a video of a leafy enclosure filled with half a dozen European tree frogs. Cas listens, rapt, as the host briefly covers the European tree frog diet and housing.
Dean can’t bring himself to speak until they’re both out of earshot, their footsteps fading off into the distance. He turns to Cas, trying to keep his voice detached and failing miserably. “So, you think it got you after all?”
“He never gave us a deal,” Dean says honestly. “Sammy and I had no idea who Chuck was until he sent us an email two weeks ago.”
What Castiel wouldn’t give to scent Dean’s joy for himself. “He would probably love that latte,” Castiel continues wryly.
It takes all the tricks in Castiel’s book to stop Dean from immediately disinfecting his kitchen once they untie from each other.
“Dean!” Kelly greets, pasting on a fake smile as she cranes her neck around to scan the aisles behind him. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”
Dean’s shoulders hunch as he curves in on himself, chin ducked close to his chest. “I’m so fucking sorry.”
To their left, something else chirps - lower in pitch and less tonally pleasing than the crickets. A small green frog with black accents sits on one of the ledges halfway up the pillars supporting the front porch roof. It blinks up at them slowly, slitted pupils widening infinitesimally.
“I don’t really know anything about keeping a frog.” Cas leans the broom against the wall and sets the dustpan down. He peers at Wart, his gaze taking in all of the frog’s telltale features, mentally cataloging through all species known to man and angel.
“Yeah, since I’m pretty sure I’d be in Hell by now,” Dean says, forcing a smile on his face. “Your turn.”
“The song you just sang,” Showerus Interruptus called, his voice echoing off the tile in the bathroom. “What was it?”
Dean blinks at Cas, his stomach turning over with dread at the very idea. He tries to picture some nameless angel yanking him out of the Pit or marching into that barn with all the righteousness of Heaven on his heels. Dean can’t do it.
have something against teenagers making out in every hallway and empty classroom, which they will if they see their two favorite teachers doing it.” She shakes her head. “If you want to hold hands or take an ad out in the school paper, be my guest.”
Dean guffaws, nearly inhaling his drink. Swearing unrepentantly, he shifts the cup to the crook of his elbow and takes his sunglasses off. He rubs his temple with his free hand. “Christ, I’m too hungover to laugh like that.” He squints over at Castiel before sliding the sunglasses back on his face.
As Cas shuffles guiltily in place, Dean wracks his brains for a reason - any reason - why Cas would keep a secret like this.
Truthfully, it could be worse. He’s spent plenty of fun weekends staying in with Cas, squabbling over whose turn it was to use the stove for frying burgers (Dean) or boiling hiccup cures (Cas). As long as Cas springs for next-day delivery, Dean could be looking at freedom in under 48 hours.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy,” Cas says, glancing down at the instrument in his hands. “I’ve been content before. I’ve appreciated the route of flowers. I’ve masturbated, which is very satisfactory but also very fleeting.” He shrugs. “I adore my work, my friends. What am I missing?”
“Of course,” Cas says, rolling his eyes, “How could I forget? That’s why she broke up with you the first time.”
“I can send you a picture,” Dean blurts before he can think better of the idea. He shakes his head. What the hell would Cas need a picture of Dean’s brother’s dog? Dean already paid him. Transaction over. He shouldn’t even be calling-
"Later." Dean swings his bag around front and pulls out his baggie of plastic teeth molds. "I wouldn't have pegged you as a Halloween type of dude," he says good-naturedly as they hike up the steps and pass through the double doors.
Daphne frowns, meeting Castiel’s gaze over Dean’s head. “We are a LGBTQ friendly school,” she says sharply. “Dean runs the Gay-Straight-Alliance. If you have any… issues with that, I’d recommend talking to Jody before we leave.”
“Busy,” Castiel replies. “We have a new hire, and so far Kevin can only draw genitalia on lattes instead of flowers.”
Castiel turns to Dean in surprise, and Aaron really doesn’t need to be here for that conversation. “Oh-kay,” he says, sidling around them, “I still gotta,” he jerks his head towards the men’s room.
Aaron makes his exit, sighing in relief as the door closes behind him. He should be fine if he doesn’t touch anything. Or look at any shiny surfaces too closely. Once upon a time, he lived with a dozen Alpha Epsilon Pi brothers. He can do this.
Cas groans a stream of indistinguishable words that might not even be English - knowing him, he’s probably insulting Todd’s mother ancient Aramaic or something - before he concludes, “It was a very uncomfortable situation. Todd is an imbecile.”
Kelly huffs an impatient sigh, blowing a few brown strands of hair out of her face. “I ran into them shopping together a few weeks ago.”
Dean braces both elbows against the desk and slides Cas’s book towards him, idly flipping through the pages. “How many siblings do you have?”
Cas winkles his nose in distaste, and that’s it; Dean will always call it a grace boner from now on. “It would be no different than manipulating your body’s physiology to speed up healing or render you unconscious.”
“We all have names,” he says reasonably, “I’m Cas. The baby is Jack.” He rests the broom for a moment. “How do you like ‘Wart’?”
Half the time, Dean is convinced Cas doesn’t even like him - he just tolerates him because Dean claimed the seat next to him in Professor Tran’s seminar that first day. But that thought’s been cropping up less and less as the months have gone on, and Cas keeps indulging Dean's stupid asides when Professor Tran is focused on another student.
Castiel smiles back. No words come to him, but Dean probably won’t take offense. The post-orgasm endorphins are still flooding his veins, and he could stay in this bed, tied to Dean, forever, and have very few complaints.
Dean strips in record time and hops in the shower after him. They might as well get started now - Cas has a lot of skin left to cover.
Cas wraps a hand around the back of Dean’s neck, pulling him closer. “I don’t have bad ideas, Dean,” he murmurs.
Dean inhales sharply, his fingers twisting in the sheets, as Cas bends down lower to lick the head. The wet, slick touch is gone too soon, and Dean moans at the loss, “C’mon, Cas.”
Dean snorts. He sits back, palms braced behind him. His expression carefully neutral, he asks, “So what now?”
Dean exhales a loud sigh. He studies Castiel, face scrunching adorably. Finally, he says, “I guess, the first thing is to say goodbye to privacy.”
“Cas wanted to get settled in before people started saying he was my trophy husband,” Dean says with a wink.
“Hello to you, babe,” Dean says, amused. He raises his head to fully look at Cas, now face planted into his pillow. Dean would like to say it’s unusual to see Cas this drained and frustrated after another shift at the Gas n Sip, but it’s become pretty much standard. And, because not-that-deep-down Dean’s a shitty person who lucked out and got a (fallen) angel to fall for him, he can’t entirely squash the pleased feeling in his gut every time Cas comes home to him, no matter the circumstances.
Painstakingly slowly, Wart rises out of his crouch and leaps for the tray in front of Jack’s high chair. He stays in an alert position, back legs still tensed as if poised for flight.
“Okay, so, what,” Dean says, “is the kitchen off limits? ’Cause that’ll be a problem for Future Dean, the way I figure it.”
“Woah,” Cas’s Dean says, both hands up, one, of course, laden with a plastic bag full of discount Halloween candy. “This is… not good.”
Cas makes a little wounded noise as Dean deepens the kiss, nipping at Cas’s bottom lip lightly. Cas’s hands slip under his shirt to grip his bare waist firmly, and Cas must run hotter than the average human because his touch is like fire against Dean’s skin.
Castiel walks around to his side, his own plate in hand. “I’ve met plenty of terrible alphas in academia. They’re equally awful; they have more diverse interests.”
Castiel frowns but nods, and Jo’s expression eases once he doesn’t challenge her request. Still, he has to ask, “But why doesn’t he order at the counter like a normal customer?”
Donna throws her hands in the air as Kelly, Daphne, and Aaron converge on her like piranhas tasting blood in the water. “Jeez Louise,” Donna grumbles, “a little warning wouldn’t kill ya, would it Jody-o?”
“If the Omega insists,” Castiel demurs as he resumes his previous position between Dean’s spread legs.
“Oh,” Castiel says, looking relieved. He glances at Aaron out of the corner of his eye. “And do you still… like him?”
Cas touches the inside of his wrist, his expression turning almost shy. “Of course, when I first pictured introductions, it was strictly as a friend. I don’t really know anyone else in this city well, and I’ve told you about my difficulty in social situations, so it would’ve been more for moral support than anything else. But after this evening -”
“Like what?” Cas asks as he frowns up at the ceiling. “I don’t have much experience except in inventory management and customer service.”
Cas’s cheeks heat. “I’m not.” He clears his throat. “I’ve been at peace with how I feel for you for a long time. At first, I thought it meant I was broken. But I now take it as something to be treasured, something precious that I needed to nurture, not stamp out.” He lifts his hand from Dean’s shoulder to cup his cheek instead, the stubble rough against his palm. He half expects Dean to knock his hand away.
“Worse - he’s been trying to set me up with his roommate,” Dean grumbles, his words slightly muffled. “He’s got some weird idea that we’d be perfect for each other.”
The hallway is, of course, eerily familiar with his floor, just with 4s in front of all the lettered doors instead of 5s. He figures the sound must be travelling down the apartment lines. He lives in 5J, so 4J is a good bet. He rings the doorbell and waits with bated breath.
Cas tilts his head, his eyes narrowing. He’d been planning on going over the books tonight, but he could put it off until the weekend. “Do you have late check-ins that require a place to eat?”
Plus, it's not like Cas, graduate student of the Occult School, brings in anything worse than Dean, graduate student in the School of Nursing. Between the two of them, Dean definitely holds the lead in coming home splattered with questionable fluids. Cas is practically Mr. Clean compared to him.
“Busy day in hospitality?” Cas asks, eyebrows rising as he grabs his pad and scribbles down an order for a cheeseburger deluxe.
He has trouble focusing for the rest of the class, sneaking sidelong looks at Cas, who seems determined not to let his attention wander from the discussion. If he’s not staring at the person talking, he’s focused on his notes.
Before Aaron can think of anything else to say, Kelly appears over Daphne’s shoulder, her face flushed as it always gets when she drinks too much red wine. She slides into the side of the booth vacated by Dean and Castiel. “Some party, right? Did you see Garth doing shots?”
Dean sighs, muttering, “Of course you don’t.” He doesn’t look up, so he misses Cas’s flinch. “You drive a hybrid car. You freak out if you don’t return your library books on time. You have nothing
“What mile-” Dean cuts himself off as another illustration slips out behind the one of Cas. It flutters to the table.
Castiel throws him an incredulous look, which Dean ignores. “If you think I’ll be done with you after only 24 hours, you are severely mistaken.”
“Uh, it wasn’t so bad,” Dean says, reaching up to run a hand nervously through his hair. “The legs took some time getting used to, but I could get so much air, man, you have no idea.”
“Oh my god,” Dean mutters as Naomi strides into Crowley’s office. Half horrified, half entranced, he strains to eavesdrop on their conversation through the glass door.
But the man behind the desk actually winces as Dean approaches. He ducks behind his book, a romance novel, judging by the perky nipples of the dude on the cover and swirling script of the title.
That is so blatantly untrue, Dean almost bursts out laughing. But before he can make a sound, Cas’s other hand slides underneath his shirt, his fingers tapping lightly against the buckle of Dean’s belt. Dean raises his head to catch sight of Cas's face, and Cas’s eyes are dark with want.
Dean picks it up tentatively. He really can’t handle reading about a fictional version of himself banging Cas, but before he can flip the letter open, Cas nudges him with his elbow. “Sam’s right. This one is obviously of us,” he says, tilting the drawing so Dean can get a full view.
His Dean laughs, clapping Cas on the shoulder. “Cas isn’t so bad once he gets the stick out of his ass.”
as he unbuckles Jack from his carseat and lifts him into his arms. He walks with sure - but exhausted - steps to the front door.
To his infinite frustration, Cas still can’t get Amanda’s face out of his mind by the time he’s finished folding the laundry. He braces his hands on the lid of the washer, closes his eyes and tries to clear his thoughts.
“Negative information sticks with us longer and more strongly than any positive counterpart,” Castiel says with a shrug. “It’s something I always keep in mind when reading my course reviews after the semester is over.”
Castiel shakes his head as he throws the balled-up tissues in a nearby wastebasket. He misses, but Dean doesn’t seem to notice. “No, that was definitely on my agenda.” He licks his lips, chasing the last taste of Dean’s drying slick.
“You lasted longer than I did, if it’s any consolation,” Novak says conversationally as he gestures for Dean to take a seat in the mediocre waiting area in front of the welcome desk. It comprises of two chairs, a couch, and a coffee table covered with magazines at least six months out of date.
Dean is almost finished with his standard gun cleaning (once a week whether they need it or not) when footsteps approach from outside his bedroom door. Heavier than Eileen but lighter than Sam - must be Cas.
Jack finds him after a few attempts, nearly falling over as he tilts his head to see that far up. He is rather top-heavy, but Cas’s parenting books assure him it’s only temporary.
Dean’s face loses some of its hostility. Almost intrigued, he asks gruffly, “D’you know who wrote it?”
“I’m not,” Dean says brusquely. They speed past several yellow lights, heading downtown. “They’re playing again tomorrow.”
Aaron leaves the pair of them laughing, with Kelly trying to pry Daphne’s hands away and Daphne getting louder with each tug.
“Hey, I don’t judge,” Dean says, not entirely truthfully. He holds his hands up in a gesture of innocence. “Homo it up, man. Love is love.”
Cas scans the foliage, his gaze catching on the telltale lighter patch of green. Wart is crouched about three fourths of the way up, his slitted pupils watching Jack with amusement.
“Practice,” Dean says curtly. “’S not like I could go panting after every alpha that smelled like sex on legs over the last five years. Would’ve killed my career.” He gestures to the elevator, eyebrows rising. “You waitin’ for a written invitation?”
Castiel smiles. “Can you forgive me for taking my time? I can only have,” he raises his fingers, “‘sappy sex with the lights on’ for the first time with you once.”
If there is the slightest chance that Dean will change his mind, Cas cannot stay here. He cannot jeopardize Jack for anything.
Cas looks up from his tome on Babylonian chaos magic or Shang dynasty dragon taming or whatever he’s moved onto now. All Dean knows is that the book smells like rotting flowers and mouse shit, so he banished Cas to the other end of the war table.
Dean seesaws his free hand back and forth as he sips at his latte. “Not always.” He lowers his voice. “I actually like cleaning - it helps me relax and shit. There’s nothing like blasting some tunes and scrubbing out that stain on the counter that’s been annoying you forever.”
What is this spell, anyway? Ancient Klingon? Elvish Pig Latin? He could fuck up the pronunciation, and this’ll all be for nothing.
Cas looks up, frowning. “I - “ he gives himself a little shake and starts again, “Is Rowena having trouble with the spell?”
“More,” Dean says, based on the anecdotes Jo tossed around over the past two weeks, “Definitely more.”
Castiel shoves his hands in his pockets. “Should I not have said that?” he asks, brow furrowing. This can’t be the first time Dean has been complimented on his looks. As Castiel understands, good looks are one of the main precursors to acceptance in Hollywood.
Dean barely checked that Cas came home in one piece before the phone rang, and Dean had to talk some podunk sheriff out of throwing Krissy in jail for desecration of a dead body. By the time FBI Deputy Director Willis got Krissy out of that jam, Cas had disappeared into the bowels of the Bunker.
Inordinately pleased that Dean had asked Jo about him, Castiel shakes his head. “No, I’ve never been mated.”
Cas sets his menu down. “As I told you before, it’s too dangerous. You could cause a temporal paradox, and we’d have to send that distress call to Jack, who, as you know, is busy with being God.”
“I was raised by a single dad,” Dean protests, “and he raised me and my brother right.” He holds up a hand, and Castiel snaps his mouth shut before Kelly had even noticed it opening in the first place. “Don’t you start. I know you have
Amara and Castiel sit through his bullshit pitch patiently. To Dean’s surprise, Amara, not Castiel, sometimes pauses him for questions and fights him on the quote he offers her for an initial fee, but otherwise it seems like an easy sell. Not surprising, since Sam scammed about fifty thousand from that first round of emails.
Castiel shoots Aaron a desperate look, but Aaron just grabs a mozzarella stick and settles in. Let the girls have their fun.
Dean glowers. He turns to Cas, an edge of incredulity to his voice. “Come on, she’s making this all up. You’d know if you got dosed with Love Potion No. 9.”
Dean’s mouth twists. “Me. I know dating me comes with a lot of baggage, so I get it if you want out. ’S not like I could turn it off - be, y’know, normal for you.”
“Normally, I wouldn’t say anything, but I had no idea your self-esteem issues ran so deep,” Cas carries on, fully aware he is speaking too much but unable to help himself. “It might not be worth much, coming from a boring homebody like me, but that’s why,” Cas swallows, his throat dry and palms damp, “why I won’t leave you. That night, after Benny left, I had thought there would be… more between us. But there wasn’t. Regardless, I didn’t realize I was behaving differently, and I apologize for that. It wasn’t my intention.”
According to Chuck, he lost his job because his old Hitter joined the company as a fixer and reported him to management.
Dean chews a fry, scowling between bites. “Not really,” he says in a low voice. “Sammy’s the farmers market maniac in the family.” Wistfully, he continues, “Give me a good cheeseburger deluxe every day for the rest of my life with a side of pie, and I’ll die a happy man.”
Whatever Dean was expecting him to say next, it wasn’t that. He straightens. “Dude, did you just apologize to - ?”
"I'm pretty sure every bar in town has a no shirt, no shoes, no service policy," Dean says with a shrug, relaxing as Cas doesn’t immediately turn him down or laugh in his face, "but, if you wanna take that risk, I know the owner of the Roadhouse. Jo would get a kick out of it."
“And if you need help…” Cas drifts off sheepishly, “I do have requisite experience managing inventory. I cut down on unsellable food by fifteen percent two weeks ago.”
Dean’s eyes widen, and he makes a very strange noise above the rim of his coffee cup. “That’s not…” He drifts off, going red in the face, “No… just no.”
Well, until Cas messaged him on Bobby’s new ask-a-mechanic feature on the garage’s website. Cas had inherited a banged up 1967 Mustang and had no idea where to start with restoration. Apparently
Dean stands his ground, averting his gaze, though, because he’s not a complete asshole. “I’m telling you, you gotta leave. I can give you ten-” Focused on a patch of dark grey carpet by his feet, he barely catches the movement out of the corner of his eye.
taking it to him?” Castiel says, eyebrows rising. “Kevin’s moved onto multiple hearts now. Admittedly, his first set looked like labia, but he’s gotten much better.”
Cas’s blood boils. How dare Dean come here and try to trick him. Cas already knew they were no longer friends after all he’s done, but he had thought Dean had the decency, the respect, to meet him face-to-face. But no, he resorted to subterfuge, to magic - which Dean hates more than anything.
Cas shakes his head minutely. “Enjoy your party, Dean. It’s fine.” He swallows. “I’m sure there will be more co-eds at Sigma.”
He went to sleep late last night, watching one of Dean’s earlier movies. He was slimmer and younger, but he still shone with his signature charisma and talent. For the first time since Castiel started the morning shift at Hunter’s Cafe, he snoozed his alarm.
after their whole discussion about which earpieces to use. The moron spent a whole hour arguing for the most expensive ones with a ton of bells and whistles they didn’t need for the con. “Pull the fire alarm.”
Dean exhales a slow breath. “Great, just great,” he mutters, glancing down the hallway for an excuse not to look at the one witness to his most recent let down.
“He might get out into the wild,” Cas says, turning to glare at Wart as he edges back towards them. “And because he isn’t a native species, he could eat food and take resources that the other frogs need.”
“Saving us seats for the meeting?” Daphne says, crossing her arms over her chest. “Like I do every month?”
is going on?” Dean demands, his gaze flicking between the two of them but lingering on his older self. “Did I time travel again?”
“I don’t remember the last time I told someone I loved them to their face,” Dean says hesitantly, and it’s excruciating to say these things out loud. “Not Lisa. Not Bobby, or even Sam.” And before Cas can stumble right back out the door, Dean reaches for his hand. Dean’s palms feel gross and clammy, but Cas doesn’t seem to care, judging from the wonderful world of Disney look coming over his face. “So if you need that sort of thing, you’re angling to get with the wrong dude.”
Castiel has no idea how to respond to that, so he doesn’t. Dean can’t mean it like Castiel thinks it sounds. He’s an actor: intuitively being what his audience wants is the dictionary definition of his job. Instead Castiel asks, “No french fries this time?” because he’s not nearly ready to leave yet.
Dean’s mouth twists in distaste at the question. “It was, I dunno, a few years ago? In Purgatory, when I was praying my ass off, Benny kept telling me it was a waste. But no man gets left behind, not in my book. We’re friends. I wasn’t about to ditch you when the going got rough.” He shakes his head, staring hard at a nondescript spot on the bedspread by Cas’s left knee. “But it was more than rough. Benny got the whole story out of me - you betraying us, joining up with Crowley, betraying
Dean feels faint. He glances down at Cas’s hands and jerks his gaze back up to his face. He can’t think about how those hands have been all over his collars, testing their strength, feeling for their softness, fastening them for the first time-
Still, he’s taken all the history talk he can stand, especially after teaching it for four hours to a bunch of high schoolers with varying degrees of interest.
Sam takes one look at the screen, grimacing, as he clicks the mouse forcefully. “Really, Dean?” he gripes. “Cas was sitting
Dean shuffles forward, doubt dragging every step. He could be going in the complete wrong direction, and if he gets off the yellow brick road, how will he ever get to Cas in time before the Empty comes back?
“I mean, Mom’s a fan, but not that big of a fan,” Dean says, chuckling. “I’m pretty sure she’d rather get a twenty-minute call from yours truly than sit through a two-hour flick with my name on the poster.”
“Honestly?” Dean spent all day putting things in boxes, Adler has been breathing down his neck for the past week to get the Q2 reports in before Monday, and he’s got to buy a present for Eileen’s birthday next weekend. “I’m pretty wiped. I might call it in. I’ve got a big day of moving tomorrow.”
“Good.” Castiel surveys him thoughtfully for a long moment. “Because before you interrupted me with your ridiculous inferiority complex, l was about to eat you out until you screamed my name. But we can always just ‘get to the sex’ if you’d prefer -”
“But maybe you were just spitballing,” Dean hedges. “So if you really think restarting the Roadhouse would be a bad idea, I can take it.”
It’s not the smile he expected Dean to wear once he got Jack within his grasp. It’s not a smirk. Not a sneer. It’s more like the face Dean makes when he finds he’s secured the last slice of cherry pie, or when Led Zeppelin comes on the radio by chance. But it’s somehow more.
So maybe that’s why Cas has always been so hard to pin down, so eager to leave Dean all the time. He’s been off pining after this mystery guy.
Dean pulls out his phone to check the time. He makes his next move in his Words with Friends game with Mom. He replies to Sam’s request to meet for lunch at the diner down the block from Sandover.
“I should really put you back outside,” Cas says after he empties the dustpan into the little trash can he keeps by the edge of the desk. “You can’t really prefer to be here, in this strange place, separated from all your frog friends.”
After that, I decided not to risk cross-continental trips more than once a century. Obviously, this was before aviation became available to the general public.
She sprints forward, nearly bumping her shopping cart into several bed frames. “Jack!” she says loudly, and Jack stops at once.
Dean sets them up in a swanky downtown hotel about a mile from the meeting spot. That evening, he scopes out the bar Chuck chose, noting the lack of security cameras and a pretty blonde sitting at the corner, nursing a straight whiskey. Back in their room, Sam does a thorough background check on the bar itself.
“Let me help,” Dean drawls, pushing Cas’s coat off first. He lets it fall to the floor in a puddle of tan fabric, quickly followed by Cas’s suit jacket. He captures Cas’s mouth in another kiss, blindly undoing the buttons of Cas’s shirt. He lets it flutter to the floor and yanks Cas’s undershirt over his head, laughing softly as Cas has a little trouble with the neck hole.
Castiel waves his protests away. As he slides on a pair of boxers that may or may not be Dean’s, he says, “You’ll be providing the food while we watch Star Trek, yes?”
Dean tips back his cup, his expression falling into pure bliss. “Christ, that’s even better when I’m not hungover.”
A few steps away, Dean catches sight of him, and it’s like some magic switch is flipped on, and he is Dean Winchester again.
Dean sprawls out on the couch. He might as well get comfortable if he’s going to be staying here for an hour.
Only a few years ago, he would have repaired the house with a quick flicker of grace. But divine fixes attract the wrong type of attention, and Cas already runs the risk of discovery by letting Jack use his powers without restraint.
Cas clears his throat as Professor Tran turns to write something on the chalkboard. In a low voice he asks, “Are you coming to the LGBTQ Students Association’s Halloween party?”
Dean leers at him unashamedly and grandly gestures to the nearest shower stall. “Don’t let me stop you.”
“He used to be,” Cas says evenly. “But then he got complacent. And complacency leads to sloppiness.”
Cas shakes his head, his gaze focusing on Dean’s face with his patented laser intensity. “You have no idea what you’re asking for.”
Jack turns to Cas, the faintest hints of alarm lurking behind his eyes, but Cas just nods approvingly. “I’m sure Wart appreciates the softer landing.”
Castiel’s mouth falls open as he takes in Dean’s body lying before him - sculpted to perfection through Dean’s hard work and painstaking lack of cheeseburgers. Castiel trails a rapturous hand between Dean’s pectoral muscles, firm and defined, down his abdomen, tracing the hard ridges with two fingers.
Turning slowly on the spot, eyes straining against the darkness, he continues, “I’d never believed in something I couldn’t control with my own two hands. Before you. Because it’d never felt like I had a complete handle on you, not really. And apparently I was right, if I could miss something like that for
“I hope you can hear me,” Dean continues. “I came all the way here to, well, not grip you tight and raise you from perdition, but you get the idea. So I need you to get your feathery ass over here so we can go home.”
Foot jiggling on the barstool and eyes trained on his hands clasped in front of him, Dean deliberately does not look around as the door opens.
Castiel nods and motions for Dean to settle back down. Fingers back in Dean’s hair, he says quietly, “I went to college because everyone expected me to. Sometimes I wish I was brave enough not to.”
“You got that playing Monopoly? Wait, Jo did this to you?” he demands, gesturing to the cafe behind him. “Jo Harvelle?”
“Cas?” Dean asks, jerking him out of his spiral. “You good?” He pushes off the couch and steps closer. The barest flicker of doubt crosses his face. “Do you still want to do this?”
Dean chuckles. “Just about. Apparently your grace is more powerful outside your vessel than inside.”
Now it’s Castiel’s turn to flush. His colleagues, while they respect his academic reputation, have nearly all looked down on his chosen focus. “One of the main tenets of ethnomusicology is a global perspective on music-”
Dean grins. “I mean, if you spot me a six-pack and don’t tell my trainer about it, I’ll clean your kitchen.”
Fog has been rolling in all morning, so they have plenty of visual cover from any curious neighbors or stray joggers. Initially, Cas was reluctant to leave the warding of the house for anything, but by his second month cooped up in this musty, drafty house with only an infant for company, Cas finally understood the human phrase “climbing the walls”.
Dean shrugs. “Game nights get intense. Why do you think I’m always bangin’ down your door the morning after?”
Dean always hides a spare bottle of booze in the bottom drawer of the desk in his bedroom. It's mostly empty, but, hopefully, by the time Dean's polished it off, Cas’ll be cured, Rowena will be gone, and they all can pretend this never happened - Dean can pretend that Cas stopped keeping secrets because he’s learned they always blow up in his face in the past six years.
“And who are you to judge how people spend their fortunes?” Dean challenges, not entirely sure why he’s asking.
Jack perks up at the sound of his name. He crawls to Dean, resting both hands on Dean’s thigh as he stares up at Dean’s face like it’s the most sublime piece of art in the world.
Dean leads him through the crowded sidewalks. Once again, Castiel is following that all-consuming scent, sending his alpha instincts into overdrive. His pants, uncomfortably tight, rub the wrong away with every step.
Dean turns to her in surprise. “Darla?” he repeats, scouring his memory. “I don’t know any - oh, Layla,” he says quietly. “Layla Rourke.”
“I’ll go first,” Cas volunteers, his voice understandably subdued. “I lied last weekend when you invited me to the beach. I wasn’t busy, but I didn’t want to go because I can’t swim.”
Dean inches the rest of the fry into his mouth. “Don’t knock it ‘til you try it,” he says with a wink.
Dean snags one of Cas’s curly fries, ignoring his look of mild offense. Silently, he offers a sip of his own coke since sparkling water is for sad people who spice up their life with a different type of
“Good, ’cause you kind of suck at that game,” Dean says, rolling his eyes, “Who the hell uses ‘popular shipping insulation’ as a clue for
Castiel doesn’t know what to make of that, so he continues on, “Anyway, I see why Jo keeps making those drinks.”
Castiel shakes his head. “It’s alright. I,” he pauses before throwing caution to the wind, “always enjoy talking to you.”
Dean doesn’t need to be told twice. He bolts for the stairs, and Castiel can only make himself wait until the door slams back shut to take off after him.
Castiel hums as he switches to the other side. Dean’s harsh pants of breath echo in his ears, and his hips buck rhythmically with every new lick to the side of his neck.
On the drive to Los Angeles, Sam reads the rest of Carver Edlund’s books. “Apparently he’s got another series, about the Thief and the Hitter. His next one is this big crossover event. Publisher’s Weekly said it’s one of the most highly anticipated thrillers of the year.”
As Cas finishes portioning out the sweet potato, Jack’s eyes flare gold again and Wart rises from the table.
“According to Jo, he’s the best - I hadn’t seen it for myself before, though,” Dean says, equally impressed and horrified.
James says, his voice slightly raised to be heard over the din, “I’m a bit late, but is there a reservation for Winchester? For 4:30?”
Cas shakes his head, replaying all of Dean’s bizarre hesitations, obfuscations, and subject changes in this new light. Dean has always been tremendously uncomfortable talking about emotions unless someone’s life is on the line - even with Sam, and their love for each other has been well established.
Cas crouches by the lake, dipping his fingers in the freezing water. Minnows swim, unaware of their presence, only a few feet away. He turns his head as Jack makes a noise of surprise.
“Thanks,” Deans says, his voice sour as old lemons. “I told Charlie tequila shots before Monopoly was a bad idea, but did anyone listen to me?” He gestures to his face. “Next thing I know, Jo’s throwing Charlie’s bag of DnD dice at my head.”
“Why?” Cas’s grip has turned to iron around Dean’s forearm. Meeting Dean’s gaze squarely, he answers his own question after an excruciatingly long moment, “You don’t think I like you back.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Like you could hide from Skynet Sam. There were signs up the wazoo that the Omen was going down in Washington.”
Sam runs a nervous hand through his hair. “Stupid question - you’re by a lake, of course you got hundreds of frogs - but maybe there’s been a weird one hanging around?”
“Oh, yeah, you should know about him, Cas,” Dean says with a laugh. “Kid’s a horndog. Gives my libido a run for my money.”
“I know what I did,” Dean cuts her off bitterly. He runs a hand through his hair. “If it matters at all, I had no idea about her tumor when I did that job. It was just migraines, as far as we knew. And by the time I did-”
Dean opens his mouth, but Professor Tran finally gets going on the teaching, so he has to shut up and listen to Meg gleefully explain why Emily Dickinson was a lesbian.
“But Ruby didn’t show up, so we’re short staffed,” Jo says shortly. Outside, Kevin yells something indistinguishable though the kitchen door, and Jo winces.
Cas’s cheeks pink. “Unless you were opposed to it,” he mutters as he stops in front of Room 1518. He sighs, making no move to insert his keycard. Instead, he lifts his head to meet Dean’s gaze squarely. “I’ve put in a transfer request to Chicago.”
“Dean turned back into a human this morning,” Cas says as Dean appears by his side, Jack cradled in one arm.
A strangled “Cas-” is all the warning he can get out before he comes with a shout. It feels like Cas’s throat wrings every last drop from him, leaving him in a hazy euphoria.
“It’s like you read my mind,” Dean says, grinning. “My sister-in-law, the paranormal ones are her guilty pleasure.”
“In that case, I will accept payment in public displays of affection,” Castiel says primly, tugging Dean closer.
“This is Castiel,” Kelly introduces, and Jack wastes no time in chirping out, “Nice to meet you Castiel!’
“Which means, you have to stay in the house,” Cas concludes. “If I let you back out into the wild, you might become part of an invasive species.”
“Dude,” Dean says in a rush, “if you think that makes you less interesting, you’ve got another thing coming.”
Jack wriggles in his arms, turning this way and that to see the frog, but it’s stuck fast to the crown of his head.
“So this was because of Monopoly,” Castiel says dubiously. In his experience, a board game has never led to actual violence.
Cas keeps the door open in case Jack needs him and gets to work. He sweeps the first floor of the house, and it’s miraculous how much dust accumulates even when both occupants are away for a two-day trip to the pediatrician’s. He puts on the radio and listens to a female singer croon about her tarnished reputation and delicate situation.
Face flaming, Dean touches the new thought, trailing a light fingertip over the second word. “Can you feel them appear?”
“Right,” Cas says, mildly irritated that Dean’s prediction of his past horniess failed to materialize. Instead, the younger Dean just seeks to mock him, which Cas really should have seen coming.
“It arrived a minute before you did.” Cas pulls the bag of takeout from under his desk and starts divvying up the food.
Cas leans back a fraction, his eyes widening in alarm or shock. But before he can utter another word, Dean brings their mouths together.
Dean groans as Cas wraps his hand around him, his grip gentle but sure. He gives Dean a few experimental pumps, and Dean’s in serious danger of letting this all end too quickly.
“Thanks for rubbing it in,” Dean says sourly as Cas looks away. “And, not that it’s any of your business, but I scene with plenty of people. A whole cast of characters, in fact.”
to keep with the animal companion theme. He briefly considers a National Geographic documentary on amphibians, but the little promotional clip shows a snake lunging at a toad, and Cas shudders at what else it might contain.
They walk onto the street, and it’s almost offensively quiet after the noise of the bar. It’s a balmy Spring evening, the sun still relatively high in the sky.
Castiel hands over his phone. “Here,” he says, tilting it so Dean can see the summary of Ghostfacers.
Dean howls, his nails raking down the back of Castiel’s back as he holds on for dear life. He comes again, back arching, toes curling, gasping Castiel’s name.
“Before I got to see how magnificent you really are?” Castiel finishes, eyebrows rising as he lets his gaze linger down the miles of Dean’s bare skin.
By the next morning it’s still drizzling and unsuitable conditions for roof repair, according to three online experts.
Castiel silently despairs. He has never been in a place this nice, or expensive, in his whole life. For God’s sake, he sleeps on a futon in Gabriel’s old home office. He spends his free time wistfully looking at adoption sites, all the while knowing he can’t afford
“But,” Dean says, words failing as he wars with himself. He could push Cas for more info or keep on living in blissful ignorance. But if he has to choose between his own personal peace of mind or Cas experiencing the one pinnacle of human happiness (or so Dean’s been told in countless chick flicks he’ll take to the grave), it’s no choice at all. He starts again, “If you tell me about him, it’ll make this a lot easier.”
The rain doesn’t abate during the night. Cas does the laundry and checks the local news. The arrhythmic staccato of the rain beating against the roof outside and dropping into his various pots on the floor inside the house calms him in a way he can't put into words.
“No worries at all,” Daphne says with tittering laugh. “I was just wondering if you wanted to get a drink?”
Dean chuckles. “We’re facing the wrong way for that, but I’d still be down,” he says, anticipation briefly running through his scent. He yawns, settling back down. His stubble rubs against Castiel’s chest, just the right side of ticklish. “Should’ve known you’d be a kinky son of a bitch. It’s always the quiet ones.”
Cas wipes his perfectly clean hands with a rag, ducking his head in a futile effort to hide his reddening cheeks. “You should celebrate. It’s a big day for the Royale Inn. It’s the least I could do, Dean.”
“Thank god,” Dean says as he reaches for the latte. “I was starting to think Jo was gonna stiff me.”
“Christ, I should’ve known you were only after me for my money,” Dean sighs, his scent teasing, as their hands find each other.
I hope this letter reaches you before you relocate permanently. I understand what I told you, and showed you, had to be a major shock. It never seemed like a good time to tell you, but I couldn’t stand living a lie any longer. I don’t tend to make friends easily, but you were so insistent, so charming, I couldn’t help going along, even though it was one of the stupidest things I’ve done since stepping foot on the Titanic almost seven decades ago.
Dean’s breath is hot against the side of Castiel’s face. He tilts his head, pressing a sloppy kiss to his cheek that sends a flock of rabid butterflies straight to the pit of Castiel’s stomach.
And maybe in a week, once Daphne and Castiel know each other better, they can get drinks alone together. Or Kelly can get drinks alone with him. Daphne won’t fight Kelly for him, and Kelly won’t fight her.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean says quickly. As he follows Cas down the maze of rooms, he has to ask, “You were planning on introducing me to your coworkers?”
Cas chuckles. "You interrupted the spell before I could finish it. Neither of us are under any magical influence."
“We’d probably be alone,” Cas says, drawing the words out, making sure Dean understands the implications of his proposal, “if you were planning on coming back here after you get off.”
By the end, Dean is squirming and his scent is filled with some combination of embarrassment and arousal.
Rowena beams. “Well now, if he were already in love, it would have no outward effects. He’d…” Her expression becomes stomach-turningly sly, “...function normally, so to speak.”
Dean lets out a sound that might be a whimper. He nudges the car faster, and a red light whips past overhead.
Cas nods, his eyes narrowing. “Your opinion on homosexual relationships is part of the reason I’ve never brought it up before.”
Jo falls onto the nearby park bench, limbs sprawling out. To the sky, she asks in a deadened voice, “What now?”
Cas found him, sitting alone in the restaurant, head in his hands. Dean didn’t cry - he would have to be actively dying to cry in public - but he looked broken in a way Cas had never seen before.
But, in the alley behind Hunter’s Café, Castiel’s nose is completely overwhelmed by the fryers of the fast food restaurant next door, the set of dumpsters directly to his right, and the almost-offensively
Sighing, Cas walks around and crouches in front of the pair of them. “I’m sorry,” he says sincerely as he plucks Wart off Jack and sets him down on the floor a few feet away. “Wart can’t come with us.”
Jack, hanging almost upside down by now, grumbles his nonsense words. His face scrunches, and Cas quickly rights him. It’s too late, though, since Jack lets out a wail.
The next morning, Castiel left his number on a scrap of paper and attached it to Dean’s refrigerator. He half-expected Dean to throw it in the trash the minute Castiel was out his door, but, a week later, he received a text from an unknown number, asking if Castiel was free.
Cas smiles and, because he is not a jackass, he doesn’t make Dean wait before returning the sentiment. “I love you too. Shall we go?”
Dean swallows against the ball of self-loathing and disgust clogging his throat. “Some lady angel, then? Been dreaming about plucking her harp strings?”
Dean mutters something that might be a swear underneath his breath. Raising his voice, he says, his tone apologetic, “’Course. Sorry for keeping you.”
Castiel surreptitiously scents the air for a better gauge of how discomfited Dean really is, but, as always, all he gets is trash and fryer oil. “How are you doing? Apart from the injury, headache, and general hangover-related malaise.”
“Knowing you has changed me,” Cas says, his throat dry, “Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you.” He drops his hand. “How did you know?”
Dean reels back, and he can’t save himself in time before an undoubtedly pained look spreads across his face.
Maybe Dean will give him a call after his drink with Cas. Hopefully, once James finds out that Dean’s just a mechanic, lives in a shoebox apartment in Bucktown, and has never been to Aspen or the Alps, he’ll tell Dean to take a hike.
I had thought I was given this curse to make the world a better place, a cog in a bigger machine marching humanity towards progress. Why else would I be granted eternal life? But you showed me another way. You, with your Star Wars Episode IV, Led Zeppelin, and countless other “time wasters” that aren’t a waste of time at all. You made me feel younger, lighter, than I have in hundreds of years.
Castiel stops dead in his tracks because, despite the sunglasses, the baseball hat, and hunched shoulders, Dean Winchester is unmistakable.
With a small grin, Cas gets up to fetch the sweet potatoes instead. “You can’t live off sweet potatoes forever.” He holds out a spoon for Wart to sample. “They don’t have nearly enough protein to sustain you.”
Jo throws him a look as she pushes a clean coffee cup into his hands. “Yeah, you already smell, I dunno, crisp but sweet? A little like apples. That’s probably why the latte dials it all up to eleven for you when it’s more like a nine for everyone else.”
Cas ducks his head, and Dean just glimpses reddening cheeks. Interesting. Cas mutters, “I may have looked you up on social media - once.” He moves to a particularly good spot on Bones’s belly, since his hind leg starts kicking like crazy. “For your first order, you said you didn’t care about what color it was. But I at least had to know your coloring.”
“Slide a note under my door or something if it works out!” the redhead calls as she pushes the button for the elevator.
Wart’s slitted eyes dart between Cas, the spoon, and Jack and back again before his tongue snakes out, quick as a flash, to grab another morsel.
Castiel doesn’t bother pretending to protest this time as Jo barges into the kitchen, the telltale scent of sugary apples wafting around her like a palpable shield. Castiel has already braced himself for heartbreak where Dean Winchester is concerned. He might as well take advantage of every interaction he has left.
hits the shelves, and the rest is history.” She squints at him. “Did Chuck offer you a different deal?”
Without a warning, it explodes in a soundless shower of sparks. The remains of his grace rain down like stardust around them.
“How are you doing, Dean?” Cas asks warmly, his tone shifting from the distant-customer service voice to something warmer.
In all my years on this Earth, I’ve never felt for anyone like I feel for you. I’m sure you didn’t intend to go to bed with me last night, but I can’t bring myself to regret a single second of it. The sight of you tangled in my sheets, the expression on your face, the sounds you made as I touched you like no other man has before - it will all stay with me forever.
He spent an hour and a half on the phone with Cas, telling him stupid stories about the worst things people have done with their cars.
“I know they can be a bit much,” Aaron says, jerking his head back at their table. “If you want them to cool it with the questions, just say so.”
Dean turns back around. “She set up this fairytale matchmaking service - literally. For a price, she casts a spell that gives you the chance to meet your very own true love. Your very own Prince or Princess Charming.”
He was so stupid, thinking he could fuck with destiny, fate, or whatever shitty power up there decides soulmates.
“Not unless you count Garth,” Daphne says, grinning, as she pushes open the door to the Language Office. “He owns a motorcycle, if you can believe - oh, hey, Dean.”
“A fucking tragedy,” Dean declares as he dials Paulie’s number and places their order. He sets his phone down, smirking over at Castiel. “Turns out I can take more meat after all.”
Cas huffs. “In practice, yes. But I spent millennia watching humans copulate. There’s hardly a sex act or position that would surprise me by now.”
Cas tentatively reaches out and touches Dean’s shoulder, squeezing gently. “And you think it isn’t a lot for me?” He smiles, and it takes everything within him not to let his true joy show all over his face. Dean is in a fragile state, and Cas can’t risk overwhelming him completely.
Cas lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder and squeezes. “Apparently I am a gay icon now,” he says, his face completely serious.
“Dean,” Cas says, leaning forward so they’re practically nose-to-nose, “If you’re really concerned about coming too soon, I can get you hard again.”
with her juniors. Yes, Homecoming is this weekend. No, their essays aren’t due until next week, but that doesn’t excuse their behavior this Friday afternoon. Nobody wants to be in class at a quarter to three. High school juniors don’t. Daphne sure as hell doesn’t. They can’t cut her a little slack?
Cas smiles. “Then I’d better save the rest of the pie.” Under Dean’s disbelieving stare, he takes the stand and stows it under the counter, out of sight.
Castiel nods because if he opens his mouth he’s not sure what exactly will come out. Probably something highly embarrassing.
Dean shrugs. "Definitely since Benny," he says, glaring at the floor between his feet, "Maybe a little before that. I mean, c'mon, Cas, you gotta see it."
“Me neither,” Cas says in an undertone. “I apologize for prying. It’s just-” he breaks off. “You’re much more beautiful in person.”
Cas’s expression hardens, but he doesn’t give up hope. With Dean, backwards as he is, an angry reaction might mean Cas is right. Dean has always been the most defensive at his most vulnerable. Still, Cas has to remind him, “Just because you’re uncomfortable with your emotions does
Dean glances over at his guns, disassembled and gleaming on his desk. “I’ve been thinking about it. Sammy doesn’t go on many hunts anymore, says it’s more important to teach the next generation of fighters than handling everything by ourselves.”
Castiel leans forward, bracing his hands on either side of Dean. “You are gorgeous,” Castiel tells him seriously. “I have,” he bends down to kiss the hinge of Dean’s jaw, “no idea how,” he kisses down the side of Dean’s neck, right over his scent gland, “you got this far in Hollywood,” down his sternum, “without knowing this,” further down his abdomen, “but I find it unacceptable.” He peppers kisses over the juts of both of Dean’s hip bones while his hands stroke down Dean’s sides, pressing the pads of his fingers into Dean’s oblique muscles.
Dean could probably afford a hundred guinea pigs. And a special guinea pig handler to look after them.
Plus, Cas always makes this funny little face when the bubbles hit his tongue, like it's a surprise every time.
Cas has no idea how these series of events led Dean to the revelation that Cas loves him. Of course, in the beginning, Cas did it all for Dean - watching him with Lisa Braeden, knowing his supernatural-free life was in peril from the civil war. But he never told Dean that.
Dean glances to Cas for reassurance, who shrugs as if to say he doesn’t understand it any more than he does.
Cas frowns, leaning over to read the thought for himself. He straightens. “But they don’t look like pandas.”
Cas continues to point out various significant trees and, once, a squirrel, before Jack starts to flag. The soothing motion of the stroller wheels over the trail do their work, and Jack is down for his mid-morning nap, mid-walk.
“Until then,” Cas says, “I can see your soul. I just didn’t know how to read what you were feeling until now.”
“You sure?” Daphne asks, blinking hazily up at him. And okay, it’s probably good she had a breather between rounds.
Daphne giggles. “Garth’s wife - have you met Garth? He teaches Chem - owns it. There’s a whole story there, but I can tell you later, if you like.”
“It does count because highly processed sugars shut off your satiety hormones, causing your hypothalamus to-”
of Hebrew school. Organized religion has never been his thing, anyway. Two Sundays with Kelly sandwiching Daphne in the pews wasn’t going to change that.
Most things about Castiel are plain compared to Dean, who swaggers into bars wearing a leather jacket and surprises everyone by hitting on men and women. Dean, who drops all sorts of culture references that Castiel can never hope to understand fully. Dean, who makes him laugh even when he has no idea what Dean is talking about.
And Cas didn’t smite him. Didn't tell him to fuck off. Didn't flutter off to the moon for shits and giggles.
He sulks through most of the movie, only perking up as the prince rides off to rescue the sleeping princess. He leaps out of his salad bowl and hops over to Cas and Jack on the couch. For a better vantage point, Cas lifts him up and sets him down on the armrest.
Cas raises an imperious brow. “So what would you rather talk about, if not your poorly-thought out plan to woo Lisa back into your arms by breaking into her apartment and declaring your undying love?”
Jody pinches the bridge of her nose. “Okay, that’s all that was on my agenda for today’s meeting-” she waits for the cheers to die down, “-but, Dean and Castiel, can you stay for a sec?”
“You were planning on introducing me to your family?” Castiel asks, surprised and inordinately pleased.
“I miss all of them,” Cas murmurs to Wart. “I keep waiting for it to stop, but I don’t think it ever will.”
“Fuck!” Dean’s hips buck violently, seeking more of that delicious heat, but Cas keeps him still with a hand that might as well have been made of iron. And, Jesus, if that not pinging all of Dean’s buttons. Dean groans as Cas gives a particularly hard pull.
Dean crosses his arms over his chest. "I put that one together for myself, thanks. You’re not doing anything dark, right?" Because if the guy is doing black magic on Dean's property, Rowena's about to get a hell of a wake up call. Beauty sleep be damned.
“You could at least make it hard,” Jo says, tossing her hair behind her shoulder. “Sometimes I think you’re letting me do it. I’m not sure why, though.”
Without looking away from the windshield, Dean says, “For everything. Breaking the curse. Saving my ass. Raising Jack - he’s gonna be a hell of a kid.”
That girl I wrote about last time, that didn’t work out. Not by a long shot. I didn’t name names, but she got the impression I was holding onto someone else. I wanted to love her, to love her like I love you, but I couldn’t.
“Because what I see is a successful omega despite the odds, who works incredibly hard and is willing to make great personal sacrifices for what he believes in.”
"I was initially against it, but this costume has grown on me," Cas says, fingering the edge of his rainbow cape.
“Hello, Dean,” or that’s what Dean assumes Cas is saying, based on their past million and a half conversations over more than a decade.
. Jack will probably like it - after all, he has already recruited one loyal animal friend, just like the main character.
“Anyway,” Castiel coughs, embarrassed he made Dean sit through all that, “I also teach Rock and Roll from the 1950s to 1980s. There is a great deal of crossover with my specialty since most tribute bands recreate acts from the ‘60s to the ‘80s.”
Dean takes in Cas’s unamused face and scowls at Rowena's tinkling laugh. “Okay, Sabrina, what the fuck do you mean by ‘love spell’?”
Dean might’ve said something along those lines. Truthfully, he’d been pretty drunk. It took a bit of liquid courage to even dial Cas’s number.
“Could be at the bar,” the hostess says flippantly, tilting her head to the crowded area. “Most of ‘em don’t check in.”
Cas huffs an impatient breath, shaking his head. “I understand our relationship is complicated, but I had hoped -” he breaks off. He leans against the door, keeping as much space as possible between him and Dean.
Castiel slides his hands under Dean’s flannel, slipping his thumbs under the hem of his shirt to touch Dean’s heat-flushed skin. With a gasp, he breaks their kiss. He ignores Dean’s whine of protest, and ducks his head to kiss the sensitive skin over Dean’s scent gland on his neck. When he sucks, hard, Dean all but convulses against him.
Dean paces back to the bed, his expression conflicted. He takes one look at Cas’s face and backtracks to the window. “Me and Sam, a week ago, we ran into a witch,” he says, a complete nonsequiteur.
“Hmph,” Rowena sniffs. “Men really are oblivious to matters of the heart.” She waves her hand again, eyes glimmering violet. “Like I thought,” she continues, placing both hands on her hips,
leave Novak and hop in his baby. Valentine’s day still has plenty of hours left, and there are bound to be miserable singles hanging at the local watering holes, even at this hour.
Dean stares down oddly at the demented pear and takes a sip. Face going slack with a bliss Castiel doesn’t need to smell, Dean groans.
It takes a moment for Dean to get what he’s seeing. Everyone in the illustration is fully clothed, first of all. It shows a darkened, windowless room. An outsized television illuminates the three figures watching an episode of Scooby Doo. One of the men is sprawled out on a recliner, Sam’s long, hippie hair a dead giveaway. Another man is asleep in the second recliner, covered in a draped trenchcoat - Cas? No, there's a third guy standing above the second, his elbows braced on the back of the recliner, his fingers tangled in Dean’s hair as Dean sleeps on.
Cas straps Jack down into his car seat. The Impala’s back seat wasn’t built for safety features of any kind - save the lap belts Dean installed himself - and the car seat wobbles precariously. Cas nudges it again, testing its stability.
Dean wouldn’t even be in his apartment, but Castiel’s roommate took off in the morning for a day of grading essays in the main library, and Dean’s upstairs neighbor made some sort of eye-watering chili for lunch that practically smoked him out. As Castiel had zero desire to have sex with Dean on some secluded park bench or, God forbid, his office at the university, he brought Dean back to his place for the first time.
He makes his way through the thinning crowd, waving to Eleanor when he spots her getting ready to leave and nodding to Charlie as she adjusts the empty shot glasses in front of her, Jo, and an impossibly red-faced Garth.
Dean swallows. Cas can’t be - she can’t be implying - that’s impossible. He’s an angel. They don’t feel things like that.
Castiel probably shouldn’t tell Dean what is exactly on his mind. Castiel has found very few people appreciate his default brand of honesty - Hunter’s Cafe customers, especially. But Dean isn’t technically his customer - he’s Jo’s - and Castiel has reached the point in his life where he doesn’t need to hang onto people who don’t like him and vice versa. Dean isn’t even providing extra publicity for the establishment, since he’s getting serviced in the alley behind the kitchen.
Wart croaks in defeat and jumps down. However, he’s not airborne for long before Jack’s eyes glow gold, and Wart finds himself floating back down to Earth, light as a fluttering piece of paper.
Castiel’s whole body heats with the force of his blush. “Thank you. I asked Jo how to make it, since it seems like I’ve taken over your delivery duties.”
Dean turns to him. “I wasn’t joking when I said the rest of the alphas in Hollywood suck balls,” he says, his expression going soft.
The kitchen window bangs open. Cas jumps at the noise, whirling in place, but Jack just claps and beams.
The automatic doors to Nine Spheres open, hitting them with a burst of perfectly conditioned air. Dean hasn’t stepped foot in the hotel since Cas paid for his stay, but it hasn’t changed one bit. The same tiered giant chandelier glitters overhead. Giant pillars bracket the concierge desk to the left and the enormous staircase to the right that leads up to the second floor rooms. The tiled floor, so polished Dean can practically see his reflection, stretches the length of the lobby.
Cas opens his mouth, pausing for a beat before saying, “I was never intending to leave permanently. I will still help you figure out how to deal with Kelly Kline. I will still assist with research, translations, anything you need.” His blue eyes bore into Dean’s face. “I can still be useful.”
Castiel’s mouth falls open as Dean reaches out and pulls out his phone to show him a ticket confirmation email.
“Aw, Benny, you say the nicest things. You’re the best cook I know - don’t tell my mother I said that.”
Dean’s head snaps up, nostrils flaring and pupils dilating. His mouth falls open, Castiel’s name dying on his tongue.
Dean groans. “I don’t appreciate the sass, Jeeves. But fine. Hold that room for Fergus Crowley, and I’ll be calling back every day to see if someone other guest had to pull out or died or something.”
Dean takes a seat at the foot of the bed. Leaning in close, he almost breaches the incorporeal perimeter around Cas that constitutes his ‘personal space’.
“It’s not for you, doofus,” Jo says as she rolls her eyes. “There’s a customer out back.” She jerks her head towards the service exit that leads to the alley where they dump their trash (and where Ruby takes her furtive smoke breaks). “I need you to take this to him.”
He brings his last apple pie latte home to Gabriel, and his cousin makes him write down, step by step, how to make it. In between actual licks into the cup to get the dregs, Gabriel swears to visit him at Hunter’s Cafe more often.
Cas pulls off of him, licking his lips in a lewd display that sends every last blood cell Dean has left rushing south. “Are you alright?”
Dean throws him a baffled look as he pushes himself off the ground. “One, you already have my home address, dumbass.”
But no, Cas had to go and switch up their meeting time at the last second, and Dean had run into James instead.
Castiel steps inside cautiously. He makes his way down a short entryway, which opens to an expansive living room.
“Yes,” Cas says quickly, his gaze raking up and down Dean’s face. “I have misunderstood your actions in the past, and I have no desire to do it again.”
“We did it!” Dean calls victoriously as he jogs down the hall to the corner office, where Cas is apparently working diligently at his desk directly outside the door.
Castiel waves off Amara. He waits until the door closes behind her to turn to Dean and say, his expression grave, “You need to call off the job right now.”
Cas’s mouth thins, lips pressing together as he raises his glass to his mouth. “You don’t need to stay to keep me company, either,” he says in a low voice. “I’m the one under the spell. If you have anything more pressing, I can wait here for Rowena.”
Maybe he feels off because he let Cas out of the mental toybox of kink he usually keeps squashed tightly shut (unless he’s at his BDSM club).
“Not an ex,” Dean grumbles. “We had a thing. Briefly. Years ago. It was before-” he coughs, “anyway.”
“If it means I can’t afford to mate a house-omega, I’ll just have to keep cleaning my kitchen myself,” Castiel finishes with a shrug.
Cas scowls, but his exasperated frown doesn’t reach his eyes. Not by a long shot. “You know I have enough trouble reading conventional social cues, why on Earth would you think I have any ability to read the more covert ones?”
Cas flies them to a strip mall restaurant a few minutes away from their motel. “Where did you eat last time?” Cas asks, glancing around the parking lot for the telltale gleam of the Impala.
Castiel actually smiles. “Chuck is sending you on a wild goose chase for a goose that doesn’t exist. There is no copy here.”
After the lamb-soft leather slid around his throat, the buckle clasped shut leaving just enough room to breathe, and the first tug to really test the fit, Dean was a goner.
The ice pack slips off his face again, and Dean doesn’t bother trying to put it back. Instead, he gets to his feet to hand it back to Novak. “Thanks.”
The air between them hangs heavy with their mingled scents. Castiel glances down between them; Dean is hard again and leaking. Castiel inhales deeply as he thrusts back inside Dean, grinning as Dean flails and grabs onto him for purchase.
James’s face falls. Shoulders slumping, he pulls out his phone, squinting as the screen lights up. “He said he was here,” he mutters.
"It's pretty late, but I think I’ve got some decaf somewhere," Dean says, forcibly shoving down his rising embarrassment at being so presumptive. He’s asking out
To his infinite relief and dread, the bowl with the blood starts to glow. As it reaches blinding levels, Rowena calls, “Pour it over yourself!”
“Just one more,” she pleads. “Man, I code all day and read fantasy novels on the weekends. Nothing this exciting ever happens to me.”
Dean slaps his hand over Castiel’s mouth, pressing down a little harder than necessary and rubbing his hand against Castiel’s lips. He spares split second to mourn the fact that it isn't his mouth ravaging Castiel's - but Dean's a gentleman (thief) at heart. When Castiel kisses him, it will because he wants to, not because of the con.
Novak shakes his head. “Believe me, it’s still infinitely better than attending dinner with any of my relatives. The last time I did, apparently I had the gall to bring an American wine. They lorded it over my head for a full year.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says as he shoves his hands in his pockets. His smile turns a shade wry. “In case you didn’t notice, webbed feet and ribbits aren’t usually part of the package.”
So Cas’s one big happy loving family message was only a deathbed thing. That’s… fine. Dean’s done it himself, a time or two. Told Sam to live his life and not go looking for revenge or a way to fix it - all a crock of horse shit, of course. He should’ve figured Cas was more human than angelic with that poison pumping through his veins, making him all weak and sweaty. ’Course he wasn’t above feeling human sentimentality in his death throes.
Dean drags his feet up every step. This is stupid. Some old lady with too many cats will live in 7J, and Dean will slink back to his apartment with his tail between his legs.
time. “It’s complicated,” Cas adds, like any part of this fucked-up situation could fit under a goddamn Facebook status.
Cas clears his throat. “I think it went well? You said you and your partner were satisfied with the final product.”
“You know, if you invite me up to your room,” Dean cuts him off, “you’re going to have a bitch of a time getting me to leave, right?”
Castiel chuckles as he reaches for the box of tissues on his nightstand and cleans up the mess he left on Dean’s stomach. “Can you believe I forgot that was an option? My roommate is practically vegetarian, so I haven’t had it in months.”
If Dean wants to let the bond fall to the wayside, Castiel won’t stop him. Asking Castiel on one date hardly compares to a mating. Neither of them had any idea they were true mates. Castiel can hardly blame him for second thoughts. The timing isn’t ideal, but revelations like these hardly ever are.
“No matter what the setup,” Dean breaks off, a flush spreading down the back of his neck down into the collar of his shirt, “swans, glass shoes, dancing bears, all the curses could be broken by…” he drifts off, impressively managing to look even more uncomfortable, all with his back still turned to Cas.
Castiel reaches over to his nightstand and snags his tablet to pull up a recent reading he assigned his students. “It’s a standardized alphabet that academics use to write the sounds of speech.”
“I’m sure you do,” Amara says as she sits back down. “This is my colleague, Castiel Vauxhall. He’s our Vice President of finances.”
“Okay,” Dean starts, his head still mercilessly void of the right thing to say, “So that guy, the one you’re - well, it’s - he’s me?” he asks, stumbling over his words like he hasn’t since that one time Rhonda Hurley opened her underwear drawer.
Castiel says, utterly bewildered how Dean could come to a different conclusion, knowing what he does about Castiel.
Cas includes links to the memorial service announcement and news article. They won’t need any additional details.
“Yeah,” Dean says, feeling like a tongue-tied idiot. If only he could be more like Cas with the grand declarations.
“Hang on,” Dean says, grinning, as he taps their plastic bottles together, “Are you actually saying I was right about something?”
“I don’t know,” Kelly says, throwing her hands in the hair. “Sue us, we liked seeing you happy for however long it lasted!”
Work’s going to take me by your neck of the woods in two weeks. If you’re still in town, we could go to the movies, get a burger. Just like old times. I saw an advertisement for a new movie, Blade Runner, the other day. It’s science fiction, so you don’t have any leg up on me like when we watched Heaven’s Gate. What do you say?
“You’re welcome,” Chuck says magnanimously. “Now, I bet you’re all wondering why I gathered you here.” He lowers his voice, holding for dramatic effect. “I need you to steal the very first printing of of Dante’s Divine Comedy.”
Castiel probes deeper, dragging out bitten-off moans from Dean. He flicks his tongue over the already wet skin, and Dean’s hips twist up, trying to get more friction. Slick smears over the lower half of Castiel’s face, spreading Dean’s scent all over him.
“You got the antidote to Cas’s little problem?” Dean asks brusquely, clomping down the stairs. He already feels claustrophobic surrounded by the windowless walls piled high with pickling jars and boxes spelled shut, never mind Cas boring holes into the back of his head.
Castiel hesitates. “Why is it weird that I cleaned my kitchen?” He frowns. “I suppose you employ someone to do that for you.”
Cas doesn’t understand why Wart fixated on them so strongly; he had assumed the call of the wild would be much stronger than two celestial beings trying to live as humans, but Wart loyally stayed with them all morning. Looking down, he sees Wart perched on Jack’s knee, watching the trail scenery trundle by.
“Where’s Jo?” Dean asks once he resurfaces. He jams a few fries in his mouth. Before he’s finished chewing, he sucks down some more latte in an unholy taste combination.
“Great, just great,” Dean says sourly as he sinks back in the cushions and stares out at the television without absorbing any of the cartoon action going on on screen.
Instead of watching Cas prepare breakfast as he has always done, Jack keeps his gaze trained on Wart, who has doubled down where Cas left him. Wart has tucked all his limbs beneath him, looking more like a rock painted like a frog than a living animal. He stares back warily at Jack, not moving a muscle.
Cas’s initial irritation at Dean’s blatant rule-breaking dissipates like the morning fog over Mount Washington. “That’s fantastic.”
Cas doesn’t ask; he has more pressing concerns than Dean’s many hypocrisies. He just meets Dean’s gaze briefly, mentally kicking himself. He should have realized Dean’s eyes are the exact same shade as Wart. Determined to get some answers, Cas demands, “How did you find us?”
“Dude,” Dean says, “I’ve never stayed anywhere this nice in my life. Between the food, the water pressure, and the robe that felt like I was fucking a cloud, I had enough of a hard time leaving last time.”
Dean tugs him back down for another kiss, grinning against his mouth. “Don’t you dare,” he whispers.
“Bold, hiding it in plain sight,” Dean muses, “Then again, I wouldn’t expect anything different from him. Did you hear he stole the Stanley Cup? The replacement isn’t very good.”
Cas bends down to pet Bones, who flops over, exposing his belly, paws in the air. Cas rubs vigorously, and Bones transcends to doggy Heaven, tongue flopping out, eyes closing with bliss.
I already said you and your brother cost this company fifty million dollars. Whoever you’re working with, I would bet they cost the company something equal to that if not more.”
Kelly resists the urge to facepalm. “What did I tell you about wandering off? Or talking to stran-” She backtracks, finally focusing on the man. “Oh, hi, Castiel.”
Cas resists the urge to sigh again. “You’ve never cared about amphibians before,” he says, brow furrowing and glancing up at the frog. Shaking his head, he takes a tentative step towards the nursery door.
Wart keeps Cas company through the rest of his nighttime chores, watching from a safe distance at the kitchen table as Cas boils more sweet potatoes to make into baby food. Wart even sticks out his tongue to taste a very small cube once Cas has let it cool enough.
“And if I don’t want you to leave?” Cas asks in an undertone as he pushes the up button for the elevator.
He hasn’t dared reach out to Dean or Sam since he left them unconscious by the entrance to Heaven. That look in Dean’s eye as he yanked the stolen Colt back out of Cas’s hand - it was an expression Cas won’t ever unsee.
Castiel might as well have crossed the border to Heaven itself as he climbs in. He could live here, with Dean’s scent soaked into every piece of metal, every scrap of leather, every molecule of air trapped in the car.
Dean pretends to gag. “I got him back by getting frog slime all over his hair while he was sleeping.”
“Lemme guess, you could have handled it?” Dean asks rhetorically as Cas maneuvers the younger Dean’s body onto a nearby bench.
“You know, maybe Crowley and Naomi aren’t that bad,” Dean muses as he rips open a ketchup packet with his teeth. “I wouldn’t have met you if not for them, I guess.”
“That was on Earth,” Cas says flatly. “The same cosmic rules don’t apply here.” His gaze drops to the blade in Dean’s hand and takes it.
The voice sounds wrong, but Dean has to be sure. He shifts his weight to his other foot, hitching a hopefully charming smile on his face. “You don’t by any chance like to sing in the shower, do you?”
“To celebrate the end of the first week?” Daphne adds. “Kelly, Aaron, and I have a little tradition.”
Castiel checks his email no fewer than five times on the way to the concert venue. First, to revel in the fact that he has
Dean’s tongue finally unsticks from the roof of his mouth. Face flaming hotter than the inferno where he first met Cas eight years ago, he rasps out, “Cas - what the hell are you saying?”
Castiel scowls at her observation. Her intuition is what makes her an excellent cafe manager, so he can hardly fault her for that. He doesn’t respond to her question.
“Like that,” Cas says, turning to Jack. “Now that you’ve shown him you respect his boundaries and care for him, maybe he’ll come closer. What do you think?”
Dean’s had counted down to nothing at exactly 4:01 PM, fifteen minutes ago. Fifteen minutes of running into his soulmate, getting his number, continuing on his way to this bar, and telling the bartender to keep ‘em coming.
Dean doesn't bother. Class doesn't start for another three minutes, and the professor isn't even here yet. Instead, he asks, “Can you even name a single superhero?”
“If you wouldn’t mind staying,” Castiel says, speaking up. “I have a few additional questions for you.”
“Yeah, that does sound like him,” Aaron agrees. He’s been on the receiving end of Dean’s charm offensive once or twice. It’s always left his head spinning.
you lo-" the next word gets caught between his teeth before he restarts, "Well, you have to, or else it wouldn’t have worked.” He scrubs his hand down his face, a weak laugh escaping him. But it sounds more desperate than humorous.
“Whatever you say, man,” Dean says, grinning as Cas rolls over so he’s lying normally on Dean’s bed. “Y’know, you could always do something else. Quit the Gas n Sip.”
“And B, I’m not inviting you back so you can put on a Zorro mask and slap me ’til I can’t think straight,” Dean finishes.
“I guess it might be better if you could water it down with plenty of booze. I was twelve, so…” Before Novak can say anything, Dean asks quickly, “What’s the book about?”
Whatever. She doesn’t regret the question. It’s been plaguing her and Daphne - and by extension Aaron because he had to listen to them - for a whole goddamn week.
Cas raises his head, staring out at the cracked window. Rain lashes against the panes, obscuring the lake beyond. “I feel so useless,” he tells Wart hollowly with no preamble.
Aaron waves him off, unable to hide his smile at Dean’s casual Yiddish. He only picked up two or three words from Aaron, back when Aaron dove head-first into his ill-advised thing with Dean so he didn’t have to think about all the other shit going on in his life. “Here, grab the sides will you?” Aaron asks Castiel. “I think we’ve left Dean alone with them for long enough.”
“Would I - ?” Dean breaks off incredulously to kiss him. “Of couse I fucking want to. But you really think it’s a good idea?”
One corner of Dean's mouth lifts in hopefully a charming half-smile. “It’s just to talk. I promise.”
Cas bites his lip, and this close, Dean can see how his eyes have blown black with want. “I - I can’t.”
Dean grunts acknowledgement, spinning on his heel for the door. It’s not like Dean has ever had any real say on Cas’s comings and goings - mostly goings nowadays.
Cas scrambles for a lie. “It was dirty.” Thank God, he zipped jacket three quarters of the way up his chest, and he left his flannel (stolen from his Dean’s closet) back at the motel.
“C’mon, Cas, it’s me,” Dean says - pleads, really. “You know me better than anyone else, ’cept Sammy. I won’t do something like that.”
Castiel’s dating history can best be described as ‘dismal’. During his last visit to his pediatrician before college, his doctor called him a “late bloomer,” which Castiel eventually realized just meant socially awkward. In the decade since, Castiel’s slept with a grand total of three people. And, to his supreme regret, none of them managed to bring his rusty people skills up to par.
