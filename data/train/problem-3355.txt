They'd get out of the car and look up to the clear, dark sky. Cas could name every star, every planet, every constellation. He could describe distant galaxies with such detail and precision that when Dean looked up photos of them later, he was always disappointed by the quality of the images. Sometimes he would tell Dean about a certain celestial body, or describe an event that was happening. More often, they sat in the grass or on the trunk of the Impala, making no sound except for their breathing.
Dean carefully lowers himself to his knees on the floor, away from the broken glass. It takes a few minutes of rummaging before he finds what he's looking for. The jacket bearing Cas' handprint, lying crumpled and half-hidden under his nightstand.
The thought summons an icy feeling in Dean's stomach, reminding him of a winter long ago, when Sam had dared him to walk on a frozen creek and he'd fallen through the ice. The shock, the cold, the suddenness is all back as Dean realizes that he doesn't know where he'll go.
He hears something that he thinks might be his name. He's not sure. Is it his name anymore? Is he the same person he was before Cas was gone?
He tries every door that he knows of in the bunker, and even a few he hadn't known about before. Every one ends the same way.
The key doesn't work on his room door, but Dylan, curiosity overcoming his apprehension, begins picking the lock. Dean is frozen watching him work. It's something Dean has done so many times, he can almost feel the tools in his own hands.
"You said...you said happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being," and even though his eyes are closed Dean can see Cas' face, alight with understanding and peace and love, love for Dean, love Dean was too stupid to see. His heart beats faster. "Cas, you had me. You've had me for so long. Maybe always, maybe since we met, I don't know. And I didn't tell you..."
The kids exchange glances. Then Dylan nods, and they all break into a run, sprinting out the door past Dean.
"Sammy?" Dean calls softly from the kitchen entrance. Sam doesn't move, but Miracle lifts her head off her front paws and stares straight at Dean. She jumps up, barking. Sam raises his head from his mug and looks toward Dean. Looks through Dean.
Dean's halfway through a thousand-year-old text on the nature of the soul when he hears Sam and Miracle getting up. Dean hesitates. hand hovering over the page he was about to turn. It's not that he doesn't want to see Sam, just that there's not really any easy way to say "hey, it's me, your dead brother who made you promise not to bring him back." Sam might not believe it's really him. Worse, he might try to banish Dean. God knows Dean has jumped the gun on some hunts before, mistaken a friendly spirit for an evil one and nearly gotten them killed. Dean's not ready. His work isn't done; he can't go yet. Fear rising in him, Dean channels it into his fingertips. He uses the energy to fold over the corner of the page he was reading, closes the book, and returns it to his stack. Best to stay out of sight.
Dean has lost Cas before. He's lost so many people. But this time, this time is different. Dean wishes he didn't know why it feels different.
Dean grabs the beer next to the laptop and downs half of it in one go, his head spinning when he tilts it back.
Jack is...something, now. He brings the people back. He even brings the dog back. Sam is way too interested in the lore of it all, asking about Chuck and Amara. Dean isn't really listening.
Goodbye canon, hello the happy ending they deserved. It's ridiculous! It's cliché! It's tooth-rottingly sweet! I'm not sorry!
Burt grumbles wordlessly. He stares off into the distance for a long moment before he sighs and drops his gaze.
Sam slides his left hand from Dean's back to his upper arm. His right hand carefully avoids the bloody handprint on Dean's jacket, resting instead on Dean's left forearm. Dean can barely feel Sam's hands as they lift him to a standing position. All he can feel is the ghost of Cas' hand on his left shoulder, the warmth of his face quickly dissipating from Dean's palms.
Dean's next exhale is a sigh of relief. "He's okay," he murmurs. "He's gonna be okay." Dean finally tears his eyes away from Cas and looks to Jack. Still crouched on Cas' other side, Jack sets his jaw and nods bravely, though his face betrays him.
He remembers gripping the coat a little too tightly before placing it gently in the trunk. Yes, Dean thinks, he knew. He hadn't admitted it to himself until Purgatory cleared his mind, allowed him to live free and pure and himself. He prayed to Cas every night.
Dean hasn't told Sam and Jack yet. He doesn't know if he can find the right words, and he doesn't trust himself to talk about Cas without becoming utterly lost. So Dean does everything he can to keep it together - for Sam, for Jack, for everyone Chuck vanished. He can deal with the aching emptiness later. The way it feels like Billie is still clutching his heart with frigid fingers. The way his shoulder still feels too warm and too cold, set ablaze with a fiery handprint and doused by the clutch of the Empty.
A blond man with round glasses pipes up, voice quavering. "It looks like no one has been here for a long time," he says nervously.
Sam moves quickly towards the door, only barely managing to avoid walking through Dean. Miracle waits for a moment before following him out. As she passes by Dean, she looks up at him, holding eye contact for a moment before running to catch up with Sam. Dean chases them, watches Sam climb the stairs above the War Room and pause on the balcony, surveying the bunker.
Dean laughs a full, hearty laugh at that, and he holds Cas' left hand in his own as he moves his right hand to cradle Cas' face. "Sorry, I guess. But in my defense, you did try to rupture my eardrums." His thumb wipes the tears from Cas' cheekbone.
"Wouldn't be home without you," Dean says. "Although I've had enough of this place to last a lifetime."
It really was that simple, wasn't it? Cas had sacrificed his own heart rather than let Billie take Dean's.
The first voice is casual, conversational. "Shut up, Wendy," they say to the third voice. "David said people hear things around this place. Someone calling out for someone else. He said people walk by and they just, like, cry uncontrollably."
Sam sounds tired. He looks tired. Dean wonders how long he's been gone. Wonders how Sam has been dealing. It's hard to see him like this. Dean glances at the clock and sees it's nearly three in the morning. Shit.
The chorus is deafening and barely audible at the same time, echoing around his skull. He recognizes some of the voices but can't place them. Even if he could, Dean isn't sure he would want to remember everyone he's sent here.
"You can trust me, because you know what I dreamed about. You saw me fight to bring Cas back. You saw me lose everything, chase everyone away, hurt people, to bring him back. He's the one thing I want. If he's safe...that's enough for me."
Dean has never understood how people can live with no regrets. He tried - God, he tried. But he's at the end of his life and he still has one.
Dean raises his left hand as if to give Cas a playful smack, but lowers it as he realizes that there's nowhere he can touch Cas without literally poking a sore spot. He settles for an eye roll of his own, though his mock exasperation is betrayed by the way the corner of his mouth quirks upward in a fond smile. "Smartass," Dean laughs. Cas smiles at him.
"It's a hell of a time to bail. You got a lot of people counting on you, people with questions, they're gonna need answers."
Now it's Cas' turn to laugh, because if there's one thing they've both been guilty of, it's wasting time. "I understand," Cas says. "And Dean, you know what I want. I want you. All of you."
"Dean?" Cas says again, and it's uncertain, and confused, and he's about to keep talking when Dean interrupts.
Dean remembers how sure Cas was. How certain that Dean deserved love. He thinks about returning that love to Cas. About finally having somewhere to put all the love simmering in his sinews.
Surrounded by invisible legions of presumably angry and extremely powerful beings, Dean should be on the defensive, minimum, if not downright panicking. But a bizarre calm has settled over him. He's the eye of the hurricane. They can't touch him.
His body is slowing but his soul is thrashing against its bounds, raging against this end. He doesn't want to go. He has so much left to do. So much left to say.
He copies down a few suggestions into his notes. It isn't long before the information has dissipated from his mind. The discomfort that comes with forgetting lingers much, much longer.
He remembers how Cas held him then. Unconsciously, Dean's right hand moves to cover Cas' handprint. He squeezes. It doesn't calm the searing ache in the left side of his torso. Dean doesn't know if the pain is radiating from his heart or his shoulder. They might be the same at this point. Both touched, claimed, owned by Cas. Cas, who's gone. Again.
The Empty really is an apt name. Endless, featureless nothingness stretches in front of and behind Dean, and he just keeps walking.
Dean repeats it in as many places as he can. Mirrors, countertops, on scraps of paper. He can't seem to make them see.
, it's Cas, his deep voice familiar and yet somehow wrong. Dean again feels the sensation of being underwater and hearing someone speak from miles above him. There's an inexplicable distance distorting the sound and twisting Dean's feelings.
Dean leans down over him and checks for a pulse, feeling his own rapidly speed up. Jack's alive. Just asleep. Dean moves his hand to Jack's arm, and gently shakes. Jack opens his eyes slowly.
Looking into Dean's eyes, Cas remembers the last time he saw them. "Look at me," Dean had said. "Cas, please, look at me." And when Cas had raised his head from the concrete floor, blood spilling from his neck, he had seen Dean's face, horrified, desperate and pleading. But still beautiful. "Cas," he'd said, "it's gonna be okay. You hear me? You're going to be okay. Just hold on, Cas, please. Hold on."
Before answering, Cas takes a moment to think. There are flashes - a shadow here, a shout there. "No," he answers slowly, stretching out the word.
They sit in silence for a while, hands still clasped on the bed. Dean seems content to just look at Cas' face, animated as it hasn't been in days. Cas ponders what they'll do next. He doesn't have a clue where to start. He never thought he'd get this chance, to have Dean at all. Let alone to create a new life with him. The potential is endless.
Dean stares at the simple cloth that holds all he has left of Cas. It's a bizarre kind of intimacy to see Cas' blood on the jacket and know that it pumped through his veins and was touched by his heart.
"I might be crazy for doing this," Sam says quietly. "I might just be crazy, period. But Dean...I hope you're not here. I hope I'm wrong. I hope you can't hear me right now. But if you can..." Sam takes a long pause. His eyes well with tears, and he looks up towards the ceiling as if gravity might hold them back.
Dean starts writing more than he reads. After forgetting Eileen, he's determined not to do it again. He writes names like hers, like Garth, like Charlie, like Claire. Jack, Sam, Cas...he can't imagine forgetting them. He writes them anyway. Over, and over. On scraps of paper torn from useless books, receipts from places he doesn't remember visiting.
Cas blinks, and blinks again. The room is coming into slightly more focus, the smaller details sharpening. He's still too cold, but his various injuries are unpleasantly heated, like walking on summer asphalt with bare feet. There's one point of warmth that feels different though. Cas shifts as best he can to look at his left hand, lying down near his hip. He finds there's another hand in his. It's Dean, of course, the fingers of his right hand placed perpendicular to Cas' and wrapping around the back of Cas' hand where it rests on the bed. Dean's palm, nestled into Cas', suffuses him with a soft, healing warmth.
Meg turns to Billie, menacing. "You do not speak for the Shadow, reaper. I do." She snaps her fingers, and Billie is gone.
Out of habit more than anything, Dean lowers his hand and shakes out his wrist. It doesn't make him feel better.
Dean inhales a sharp, stabbing breath when he realizes that nobody ever told Cas he was loved. He can feel Sam's worried glance in his direction, but Dean can't look at him. His eyes flood with tears again, recognizing that Cas died without knowing he was loved, so loved.
"I love you, Cas. I always have. I have loved you so much that it scares me. I love you, and I want to have you, but more than anything, I want you to be here. So please...please be here."
The journey knocks the wind out of Dean, and as he recognizes the familiar sight of his bedroom and gasps for air, he fears that he's back in the nightmare again.
"Cas, I love you so much. I've loved you for so long, longer than you know. And I spent so long lying to myself about it, about you, because I was scared to screw it up. I was scared of screwing you up. I haven't always been good to people, I know. But you make me feel, not just like I want to be good, but that I can be good. You make me feel like there is good out there. Loving you makes me better. I love you more every day. I used to think I knew what I wanted out of life. But I was wrong. All I want - all I need - is you. I want to be with you, wherever you go, whatever you do, for as long as we've got left. And I've wanted to ask you this for so long, but the time never seemed right until it seemed like we were out of time. So. Will you marry me?"
"I thought I lost you," Dean whispers. The "again" lingers in the air between them like a waft of acrid smoke. Every time Cas has come back, he's understood more what his absence does to Dean. He's slowly piecing the puzzle together, but he knows that the scars Dean carries are deep. Cas briefly thinks of what he would do if he lost Dean, but brushes that thought away.
These questions are much easier to answer. A soft smile appears on Dean's face as he lets his heart speak for him. "Well, I guess I got a little faith."
Cas runs his thumb up and down the back of Dean's hand, which is the only part of him Cas can reach. He tries to reflect back to Dean the soothing energy Dean is bringing him. Dean's breathing is more even now, and after a long moment he picks his head up and looks into Cas' eyes.
Stupid, stupid, stupid, Dean curses himself. Of course it didn't work. He's gone, he's dead. And it's your fault. As always. You thought he could love? You thought he could love you? You thought you deserved love? You're a killer. Daddy's blunt instrument. A tool, a weapon. They don't need you. No one needs you. That's why they leave. They'll always leave.
Dean stares at the wooden table and resists the urge to bang his head against the hard surface. He's not sure what would happen, but he's also not sure he wants to know. But what is he supposed to do? How can he save Cas if he can't even pick up a stupid book?
Dean waits. He waits seconds, or hours, or weeks. He paces around his room as if searching for better cell reception. He prays until his voice is hoarse, his fingers stiff and clawed from clinging to the jacket like a life preserver.
Dean wakes up to a poke in the back. He doesn't remember what he was dreaming about. He thinks he probably doesn't want to.
anymore, but he's going to make damn sure that he has control over his existence. He can do what he's always done. Protect Sam. Help others. And he can do what he failed to do. Bring Cas back.
He walks a fine line between helping Sam and staying hidden. It's not easy, but it's worth it to know he can help keep Sam safe. Dean tries to keep an eye and an ear out for any cases Sam is working on, so he can nudge Sam in the right direction. Nothing major - leaving helpful books lying around, moving useful spell ingredients to the front of shelves. One time Dean sneaks a brass blade into Sam's gear bag before he leaves for a hunt. He doesn't think Sam notices, but sometimes...sometimes Sam looks over his shoulder for a little too long. Sometimes he walks into a room and looks right at Dean. On one terrifying occasion, he actually comes into Dean's room and nearly walks into Dean, who just manages to dive out of the way in time. Sam stares straight at the spot on the wall that Dean had punched. Thankfully, a backup phone in Dean's desk starts ringing, and Sam answers it. Something about missing hearts in Texas. Sam's gone for a while after that one.
"Cas," Dean repeats, but it's pure, unadulterated relief this time. He squeezes Cas' hand back, drawing in a great shuddering breath before releasing it in choppy waves. The gust of his breath seems to clear the last of the fog hovering around Cas' head. Cas can see Dean's forehead drop to the bed beside their clasped hands, as he begins to let the weight of his worry go. Rather than speaking, Cas just grasps Dean's hand tighter. They've always been good at reading each other like this, and Cas knows that Dean has a hard time saying what he feels on a normal day. At times like this, when Dean is so completely overwhelmed by his feelings, he can hardly speak at all. Cas knows Dean will talk when he's ready.
Dean turns to look over his shoulder, hoping to catch Sam rolling his eyes at Dean. But instead he sees that Sam and Jack aren't following him.
Then she continues, "What's to stop you from breaking your promise? From sending thousands more to scream into this void? Coming back in here to disturb our rest yet again? Why should we trust you?"
"Oh," Cas replies. He feels like he should say more, but the words are fleeing from him, hiding in the dark corners of the hospital room.
A dozen years' worth of memories flash through his head like a hacky movie montage. He tries to skip past the painful ones, where someone or something - sometimes Dean himself - has hurt Cas. He tries to catch the rare little moments of bliss, like snowflakes on his tongue, barely present before they melt away. Cas smiling at Jack, Cas laughing at something stupid Sam said, Cas gazing at Dean in that way that feels like it pierces his soul.
Sam stares straight at him, and it becomes one of those moments where Dean is uncomfortably aware of time passing. It feels like Sam looks at him forever. Then, he blinks, squeezing his eyes shut hard.
Dean unclenches his fist and holds his hand up to his face, examining his knuckles. He's not bleeding - he doesn't think he even has blood anymore - but his hand feels different than it did before. It's almost feeling...more.
"Dean, are you - do you - really?" he manages to stammer out. His eyes scan across Dean's dimly-lit face, searching for a tell in the clench of his jaw, the furrow between his eyebrows. But there's nothing to see. Dean's face is so familiar to Cas, but the open, warm honesty it currently holds is rare. It's becoming less rare by the day, but it's still a joy to behold.
The laughter continued, Cas remembers. He squeezes his eyes shut, as if the darkness will illuminate his memory. He just remembers Dean's eyes, wide, fierce. Cas reopens his eyes and looks to Dean, who finally raises his head. His eyes are wild now, just on the edge of tears.
Dean can see slightly darker shadows silhouetted against the blackness that surrounds him. They're moving just enough that Dean can spot them.
I've been thinking about the scene with Chuck in 15x19, the one where crew members could hear Dean crying out for Cas from streets away. I was thinking, what if that was an almost-reunion, like the Lucifer prank call? So I wrote what I think happened there, and then I got really carried away.
Dean watches as they explore the bunker, careful to stay out of contact range. Appearing satisfied with the warding, they eventually return to the War Room and set up sleeping bags on the floor.
Dean retreats into his room and stays there. He doesn't leave until he hears Sam go to bed the next night.
One corner of Dean's mouth curls into a gentle smile as a memory floats back to him. "'A more profound bond,' you called it once. What we had. What we still have, I hope." Dean unconsciously clutches the jacket a little tighter as he continues.
Dean feels like he's drowning. His emotions, his memories, the things he couldn't say are crashing in and around him, battering the dam he constructed long ago to protect himself. He throws himself into old patterns again. Saving the world is always a good distraction. But when he meets Chuck, the storm surges.
Sorting through his lethargic brain is a challenge, but Cas carves winding trails through his memories, searching for the most recent. The scene is clouded, dusty. Trying to recall is like peering through someone else's glasses. But he remembers the laughter, echoing around him.
Dean leaps from his bed and rushes to the nearest blank stretch of wall. He tries to summon the strength to push at it, but his hands keep going straight through. When he's pushed his forearms through, he can feel his world start tilting. He's pushing forwards but tilting backwards, and he knows if he goes any further he'll just find himself flat on his back in his bed again.
Sam, discomfited by Miracle's upset, drains his cup, then pushes his chair back from the kitchen table and stands. "Come on, girl," he says, and moves to leave the kitchen. Dean hops out of the doorway just in time. He doesn't know if Sam will be able to feel his presence physically, but he doesn't want to risk Sam walking through him and freaking out. Sam shuffles toward his bedroom, Miracle at his heels, taking a last glance over his shoulder before he goes. He looks right at Dean without knowing it.
She's there, of course. Right where they had found her phone on the sidewalk. Waiting for them. Dean hasn't even fully stopped, just slowed the car to a roll, when Sam throws open the door and runs to her.
"You didn't answer my question," Meg responds, her eyes glinting dangerously as she raises an eyebrow.
Meg narrows her eyes. She stalks across the space that separates them, and comes within an arm's length before she stops. Dean stands firm as she looks into his eyes, then drops her gaze to Cas' face, solemn in sleep.
It's impossible to tell exactly where he was standing that night, but Dean figures that he's close enough. An eerie peace settles over the barn as he comes to stand under the one functioning light, darkened but unbroken. He switches off the flashlight.
Cas smiles at him so gently that it's almost imperceptible, like it's a secret for the two of them to share. Cas looks around the room, sees Sam and Eileen hovering in the doorway, Jack at his side.
He is. He's broken the chains that were holding him down, and he's swimming towards a blinding light. His head is spinning. He can barely keep a giddy smile off his face. It feels like his body is full of tiny helium balloons, lifting him up.
Dean hesitates. He doesn't want to dump that burden on Jack. Where would he even begin to answer? Jack's eyes search Dean's face as he finally decides on an answer that's vague, but true. "I did something they didn't expect."
"He left," she says, and her voice cracks as she begins to cry. "He said he couldn't be in this life anymore. Said I reminded him of what he'd left behind. He needed to forget it all. Forget you, and me, and us."
Billie ends on a wheezing chuckle. She wipes her eyes needlessly. "Oh, Dean," she begins, but Meg cuts her off.
He lets Chuck think he's breaking him. When Chuck tells them to give it up, Dean just laughs. He's felt pain. This? This is relief. With his bones snapped and his mouth full of blood, he doesn't have to think about anything except Chuck.
Suddenly too warm, he pulls off his jacket. Shifting to a cross-legged position on the floor, he holds the jacket in his lap. It reminds him of pulling Cas' coat out of the lake. Did he know then? Did Cas know then?
Dean starts making a list of possible spell ingredients, places conducive to a portal, conditions that could make it right. It saves him from having to remember where bits of information are located, and from moving half the library into his room, which he's pretty sure Sam would notice. Instead, he scrawls his findings on a piece of paper he keeps hidden in his room. Sometimes he'll go through a dozen books without adding to the list. Sometimes the list gets shorter, as Dean finds new evidence that contradicts something he'd found earlier. Writing is a struggle in and of itself, but mustering the energy to lift a pen to paper and scratch out a bit of hope...it's too much, some days.
Here would be still. Dean's never been good at sitting still, after a life on the move. He's not good at being alone either. Remaining in this plane would mean an eternity alone with his thoughts.
The next day, as they check out of the hospital, a sign catches Cas' eye. He nudges Dean with his good elbow, and points to it. "What do you think?"
"Cas, I don't know if I can do this anymore," Dean confesses. Cas' stomach drops to somewhere between the fourth and fifth circles of hell. His face must show it too, because Dean's eyes widen in horror.
He opens his eyes to a soft, watery light, like a new moon. Above him, he can feel trillions of glittering stars and shining galaxies. He looks down, and Cas is there. It's not the Cas that Chuck showed him, it's the real him, lying outstretched on his back, motionless, eyes closed.
The sigils on the barn's interior walls are faded and peeling. Dean's boots crunch over broken glass, the remnants of the storm that was Castiel. He remembers the literal electricity in the air as the lights exploded overhead, and can't shake the feeling that it's still buzzing around him.
Dean's in the library when they get in, and he watches them walk towards Sam's bedroom. Miracle is leading the way, much quicker than the two humans. They're both shuffling along with the gait of two people who are bone-tired, as if it's been weeks since they've slept. Watching them walk arm in arm, Eileen squeezing Sam's elbow a little tighter than necessary, makes Dean's chest ache. He's happy for them, of course, but he can't help but remember what he's lost. It's getting harder to push those thoughts away. But after they disappear from sight, Dean shakes himself out of it and goes back to work.
, he thinks. He doesn't say it out loud. Doesn't want to waste his potential last words on a self-deprecating joke. Besides, it's hard enough just to keep breathing when it feels like drawing air into his body displaces everything else inside him. He can feel his blood draining out of him, streaming from the wound in his back, but he doesn't feel like he's losing anything. There's not enough space in him anymore. It feels like he's too large for his body, or maybe his body has shrunk. There's too much of him for this world, or maybe the world doesn't have room for him and the burdens he carries.
"Well, all things considered, you appear to be on the mend. I think we'll be able to discharge you tomorrow, if you remain stable and continue to rest," the doctor reports.
They all step into Dean's room, turning their flashlights' gazes onto its dusty contents. They pause on the smashed beer bottles, the cracks in the walls, the piles of dusty papers.
Dean loves him. He knows, he's always known, but he's never felt it like he has in this moment. His shoulder tingles, the ghost of Cas' handprint crackling across his skin.
Subconsciously, Dean knows it won't do him any good, but he balls up his fist anyway, and before he can think it through he's punching the wall in front of him.
Dean flashes a real, genuine smile at Sam, and he can't remember the last time he did. Sam's face smooths into a look of mere concern as he waits for Dean to explain.
He hurls the book across the room. It hits the ground askew and skids through the dust, leaving a scar in its wake.
It was what he was supposed to do, and now Dean is dying young and pointless, and Cas is still rotting in the Empty. And it's Dean's fault.
"Whoa, girl, easy, it's just me," Dean says, squatting down and reaching a hand out towards her. She backs away, closer to Sam, who reaches down to stroke her back.
Dean considers staying. Wherever he is, it's better than hell. But that's not exactly a high bar. Staying wouldn't be too bad. But it wouldn't be good either.
As he's walking away, he thinks about what he would have wanted in a childhood home, if he'd allowed himself to want. "Y'know what, we'll spruce the place up a little, get some recliners, we'll get you one of those big-screen TVs..."
"I feel terrrrrrrific," he slurs. Dean opens his eyes and sees a beer bottle and his laptop. Two distractions right at hand. He shuffles awkwardly on his knees to face the chair so he can drape his upper body over its seat, pushing himself up to a near-standing position before maneuvering himself to sit down.
"Yeah?" Jack asks, a little bitterly. "And how do you even know we're out? How do you know we aren't still dreaming?"
"Your husband has refused to leave your side since you arrived," she huffs. "Maybe you can talk some sense into him now that you're awake." She turns and leaves, dimming the lights again before shutting the door behind her.
Present-day Dean finishes his story in a low mutter. "I watched the light go out in your eyes," he says. "I saw it. Just before you lost consciousness. And I - god, Cas, I was so scared. I didn't know how you could come back."
He immediately regrets the harsh words. But Jack is confident and self-possessed as he fires back, "And those answers will be in each of them." He's so sure, so absolutely sure, that it takes Dean by surprise. Jack's words clear the air between them, a clean, cold breeze that brings a memory with it.
Jack shakes his father by the shoulder, gentleness evaporating as he becomes more frantic. He calls out Cas' name. Cas doesn't stir. Jack turns to Dean, panic etched in every line of his face.
Dean pulls away just far enough that he can see Cas' face. Just far enough that he can see Cas' blue eyes blink open.
"Cas," Dean cries out, and he's breaking, decades of protective barriers shattering as love and hope and terror and loss threaten to drag him under, filling his eyes with tears. "Cas, Cas, please, Cas, it's me, I'm here!"
He leans in close and gently presses his mouth to Cas'. It's barely a kiss, just a brush of lips, just the absence of space between them.
"I...I'm proud of you. And, uh," Dean inhales here, trying to breathe in enough energy to say his name, "Cas...Castiel would be too."
Dean continues to hold Cas' hand through all the tests, clenching his jaw and glaring in the doctor's direction. Cas catches his eye once, but Dean just shakes his head, jaw tightening further.
"Cas," he starts, and then he realizes he doesn't know what to say. He's never done this before. He's never said it before, to anyone.
"Not a chance," Dean responds, tone just on the edge of menacing. He locks eyes with the doctor, who sighs. She looks at Cas instead.
"Dean, I don't know if you're here. Sam thought you were." The past tense freezes Dean to the spot, even as his mind races to remember the woman's name.
Dean hesitates. These are uncharted waters for him. It's hard to ignore his brain, shouting at him to bury his feelings, disguise them with half-truths and stupid jokes. But his heart is still thundering along, and it's telling him it's time for the truth. The real truth.
Alone in the bunker, Dean has more freedom. He doesn't have to hide his notes or spell ingredients in his room anymore, but drags them out into the library. When he has the energy, he reorganizes the books on the shelves into stacks, sorting them based on how promising they are. He piles up the books he's already finished.
"Hey!" protests the second voice, who must be Dylan. "I'm not, I just think it's scary in here. Hazel, don't you?"
"Everywhere," Jack says with a little shrug. And Dean loses the conversation for a moment, just staring at Jack. Everywhere? How could anywhere be better than at home, with your family? Dean remembers how it felt when Sam left for Stanford. When Cas left. When he made Cas leave. And he's so angry at himself, so angry that he believed he might finally, finally get to live the way he always wanted, that Dean lashes out.
Dean suddenly notices his heart pounding in his chest. He can feel warmth spreading outward, thawing and cracking the ice in his veins. The drumming of his heart is a call to action.
Then he feels the weight of Cas in his arms, the flow of the air in and out of his lungs, the pain and fear and love and joy in his heart, and knows it's real. Jack reaches out to help Dean balance Cas' weight, and they gently lower him to Dean's bed. Just as they did in the Empty, they take up positions on either side of him - Jack on his right side, Dean on his left. Dean's wearing the jacket with Cas' handprint on it, just as he was when he originally stepped into the Empty with Jack. It was the most important part of the spell, a tether to what they sought. He presses his hand to Cas' shoulder again, renewing their connection.
No one ever got that high. Rowena cheered but Bobby looked grim and Dean knew why, he was now a threat.
He didn’t care who Dean hooked up with or loved. Unlike Dean, he read his father’s diary to the end. He was surprised when he saw an entry regarding Dean’s sexuality.
"We responded to the call, came across hostage civilians in an abandoned house who were tied up and gagged, once the said civilians were safe we split up and came across these men... Although they seemed like men... Their eyes were pitch black and they had these abilities that not even Red here could defeat." he gestured to Wanda.
"Wait there was an apocalypse?" Stark asked, looking even more intrigued. Winchester sighed. "Yes, but I don't want to get into it, it's not the point I'm making." Winchester sounded off. Almost distant.
“Really? Because I thought people always hated dressing District 12.” Dean snarked. He felt a slight shiver and realised that he was still naked and as if sensing his discomfort Benny handed him a golden silk gown.
"So, now that your knowledge of Demon lore is done, let's get to the matter at hand, the message you received was obviously mentioned about a higher power, even more powerful then a Prince of Hell, it can't be Lucifer because he's in a cage trapped for eternity with Michael the Arc Angel,"
His heart went out to Dean. When Thor confronted him he felt sympathetic and understood how loosing your family can feel.
They settled in a place for camp and Castiel saw movement on the trees, he would have alerted his fellow allies if he didn’t see the amulet spark in the artificial moonlight.
He told them to leave him alone. But it seems that stubbornness runs through The Winchesters blood because here they were.
He proceeded to hunt for rabbit, after covering Castiel with his tarp. Fruit can only do so much. Castiel was still unconscious so he proceeded to shred and clean the rabbit before starting a small fire.
As Winchester finished his last piece the phone rang, startling everyone. They heard Winchester sigh.
It did sound ridiculous but they have fought Aliens and a purple, big chines Titan so... Nothing really surprises him anymore, hell, he even met a talking Racoon.
Just to mess with him, Castiel leaned backwards and when Winchester popped his head out again, he looked like a deer caught in headlights. With the most amazing green eyes.
It was then he acknowledged the bandages that was on him. Seeing Winchesters distant look he decided to not mention it.
He was getting back on the train after their stop in Fort Smith and entering the first class compartment. Castiel was already sitting in the compartment, looking out the window at the passing landscape, the train already gathering speed. Dean had the impulse to back out, find another compartment. There weren’t any empty ones on the train. There weren’t many on this route and he’d already checked the other three, finding them with a single Alpha already occupying them, in one case, an Alpha smoking a large and odorous cigar. It wasn’t that it was forbidden or anything for an unaccompanied Omega to ride in an compartment with an Alpha, but experience had taught him that it would lead to harassment, subtle or overt. Dean’s only other option would be to claim a seat among the chattering Omegas of the Omega and Women only carriage, thus forfeiting the first class ticket he’d paid for, hoping to find a little peace and quiet.
“I’m going to take a shower bath,” Dean said. He was sticky and odorous. Not that there would be washing the scent of his Alpha off him now, but at least he could be not sticky. In all his imaginings about what it would be like to lie with an Alpha, mostly it had far exceeded his expectations, but there was a messiness to it that he had not expected.
Bobby appreciated a horse, for sure. A good horse meant the difference between a good day working the stock and a bad time. He just didn’t have the love that Dean did though. The boy was something special, for sure.
“A word, Alpha,” Meg asked Castiel and outright grabbed at Castiel’s sleeve to tug him away from Dean. They walked a few strides away, to speak in confidence. Dean slipped into the waiting van, took a seat. They waited a moment or two longer, then Garth pulled the van door shut, got into his driver’s seat and pulled the van away and onto the road.
“It is of no import. I know my duty, to country and to the world. There is no time in my life to get entangled with an unsuitable Alpha.”
Bobby kept the revolver raised and pointed as he backed to the phone hanging on the wall. Dialed a number and said to the person on the other end of the line, “You need to get an ambulance and a squad car out here now.”
“You tell me. I think you could list all the ways,” Jimmy said. “Bobby and I trusted you with him and you are breaking him. Fix it.”
“August Twenty-fifth. Our first day of eighth grade. Father thought it would be better for us to try public school in Folsom.”
“She punched me right in the face when I tried to kiss her,” Castiel said, remembering with a strange kind of fondness. “Hard. She broke a tooth, if you recall. And she’d punch me in the face if I tried to do it again today.”
“Your blessing means more than you could know,” Cas said, holding out his hand to Sam, like an adult Alpha would to another Alpha, so they could shake hands. Sam was still cautious, reticent, but he took Castiel’s hand and shook it like a little man. Perhaps it was the beginnings of something like a friendship. Or Dean even dared to hope, like they might be family one day, if only because they both loved Dean.
He knew that Dean wasn’t his mate. He hadn’t earned that yet. But he couldn’t stop himself from saying it.
“I’ve never met a horse I couldn’t charm,” Dean said, stepping a little closer, thinking to move the tie up away from the middle of the lean to, so as to make room for all three of the beasts. The gray horse didn’t give a warning sound, but there was that flash in her eye and suddenly her ears were pinned back. Dean stepped away quick. A second later, her hoof occupied the spot he’d been standing, striking against the wall of the lean to with a hard thud.
Dean came to awareness again sometime later. He was stretched out on the shower room floor, tile pressed hard into his face. At least the water raining down on him was warm. His ass was a blaze of pain, his whole body ached and oddly, so did his chest. Someone, Mr. Cardoza, who was his gym teacher, pulled him to his feet and directed him to stand more fully under the shower, washing him carefully, like a little kid, with soap and a washcloth. Dean shivered when the water was turned off, but then was led to the locker area and towelled off.
He pulled up the texting app immediately. He’d been strong. He hadn’t tried to contact Cas once since he’d gone, no matter how much his heart had ached but he had to now.
“Of course not,” Jimmy said. “Well, I’m done here. I feel like I’m talking to a wall. You’re a smart man. Get your crap stowed and go after him. You need to figure out what your mate needs from you, because it’s not what you’ve been doing. If you’ll excuse me. I’m going to buy my mate flowers even though it’s not Tuesday.”
Jimmy seemed to come to sobriety first as he gathered himself together, but they both separated, half chuckling to themselves, unrepentantly, both breathing heavily from their efforts.
“I know,” Dean said, softly. Then a moment of silence before he continued. “It definitely crossed my mind. I could go, but I don’t want to. I want to stay here with you. I want to complete our mating. I don’t think I’d even mind risking getting pregnant if you were around to do it with me.”
“Never needed to. Especially not with Impala here,” Dean said, stepping up in the stirrup, mounting Impala. She danced a little, eager to get moving again. It wasn’t that he objected to them so much. The Marshal had used his spurs correctly, not to hurt the Pinto, but just the lightest of touches to the horse’s sides. The rowels were well blunted, not at all pointed. But Dean took it as a point of pride that he didn’t need them to communicate with a horse.
Dean couldn’t think of a reason anywhere to ever let go of his Marshal again, so he said, “Of course. I’ve never seen a movie before.”
“I’ve always gone by what was originally my middle name, James,” Jimmy said. “My first name was an Angel name too, but I’ve had it legally changed.”
Sam was stung. He knew it was rotten of him to talk the way he did to Dean sometimes, to take his foul moods out on his brother, but Dean never complained and never stopped loving him, despite it. He wouldn’t have thought that anyone noticed him talking to Dean like he had but he been noticed and he could see that Castiel was not pleased with it. Castiel stood up, so out of respect, Sam rose from his seat as well.
Castiel straightened his hat on his head, stood up taller and said, “You’ll see that Impala gets back to your ranch yourself?”
“He left, Sammy,” Dean said. “One day I was as mean as homemade sin to him and he left me to ride off north that same day. I drove him away.”
There was a top, more of the white linen from the pack’s workshops, embroidered by hand. It was old, thin and nearly worn out. Dean sniffed it gently to see if he could tell who had lent it to him. There were only three scents on it. Amelia, Jimmy and the little powdery baby scent of Claire.
Dean hurried away upstairs. Castiel settled down at the table to wait for him. He didn’t think it was snooping to see what his mate had been working on. It was obviously school work and had been left right out on the table in plain view. Dean had been writing in a work book, open to one of the early pages of it. He’d just finished a summer short semester, Castiel remembered. And started a new one. Classes had started just earlier in the week. The half finished workbook page was just the Enochian alphabet, just having the student practice making the symbols. Castiel flipped the workbook to the cover. “A Practical Introduction to Sacred Text Enochian,” it said. Dean was taking Enochian?
“I’m nobody’s sweet little Omega,” Dean said, setting his jaw firmly. “Now, show me my father. I’m liable to get unhappy if I have the wrong body hauled back home to bury.”
Cas laid his hands on Dean’s face, gently, then kissed Dean’s forehead. Then he said, “Of course, you’ve already raised your brother, haven’t you? You’re so young yet have had so little time for your own life. Children would be a blessing someday but only as many and if you want and when you want.”
“Oh,” Castiel said, realizing what Dean meant and what might happen very soon. Much sooner than he expected. But it had been twenty five years and it was more than time.
Dean ended up crawling back into the nest he’d built on the bed in the room they’d given him, wrapping himself in blankets like a burrito, exhausted by the sudden gusher of emotions. He’d hardly thought about his family for so long and now he felt as guilty as hell. To be fair, nobody really talked about it, but he had the feeling that he’d been clinging just barely to life for a while. Even now, he was still a lot weaker than he should have been. After this blow of realizing just what he’d done to his mom and dad, he felt so weak he couldn’t sit up again. He’d cut himself off from the people who should have done the most to protect him when his heart was literally breaking.
At last, he couldn’t put off leaving the shower any longer. He was clean, foul odor neutralized, if not the mood itself. He scrubbed himself dry with a towel brought from the laundry room and dressed himself in the black clothes he’d found in the dryer, as Jimmy had said. They must have been the ones Jimmy had borrowed to go on patrol the afternoon before the mating. Yes, the shirt was definitely his. It still had one of his old laundry tags on the side hem- C.C. Novak, TSgt. It took a while, just staring at the shirt, just lost in thought. No, not even thought really. Just lost. He pulled the shirt on finally, pushing away the memories of those days when that the shirt had been part of his combat uniform. Dressed, boots back on, he was finally fit to head back down to spend the evening with his family.
“I’m not going with him, I don’t care what he says,” Sam said. “I earned my way to a good school. He should be proud of me. Why isn’t he? Why does he think I have to go be a Marine like him?”
Castiel couldn’t help but think of his thought from earlier that evening, that felt true more than ever at this moment. He could either be forsworn or a rapist. He fell back on the bed, limp despite the nearness of his mate and his earlier eagerness. Dean did not want this and all of this was a mistake. Dean did not want him.
The woman appeared by their side. She’d been dressed so prettily last night in the outfit that was obviously her best. If it weren’t for the red trim, her dress would have been a mating dress.  She wore it still and looked as fresh and clean as she had yesterday evening, despite the difficult night. She should have been the one getting mated to Castiel last night, not Dean. She’d proven that by how she’d handled the prayers with aplomb, even after the disruption of the storm, by how she looked ready and capable to handle anything this morning while Dean felt like a pile of sticky trash.
“You’d be packless,” Dean whispered, an ache in his heart. He wouldn’t let them do that for him. To paraphrase that one sports coach, Pack wasn’t everything. It was the only thing. When he was young, he had always dreamed and ached for the thing he had right now.
“They’re safe,” Jimmy said. “I had all the children, the Omegas and the other vulnerable members of our pack gather in the Hall where they can be guarded. Michael is openly attacking now.”
“It is of no importance,” Castiel said. “Sometimes when Alphas have a disagreement, there’s a physical fight, even when one of them is the Pack Alpha. Sometimes words alone are inadequate to the feelings involved. The issue is being handled in the best way I know how. It must appear alarming but it’s not a bad injury and there are no hard feelings between myself and the other Alpha.”
The next morning, Bobby made his way back to Dardanelle, nursing a sore head from indulgence in Rufus’s whiskey and if it was a little hard to sit on hard bench of the train’s second class car, that was nobody’s business but his own and well worth the bother of it. He was a cheap old bastard, but if it had pained him enough, he might have paid the extra for the plush seats of first class.
Something about how he said it caused Dean to not just leak, but spray milk from his tits spontaneously. The breast pads soaked up instantly and started to leak.
“Maybe it’s time to retire that old thing,” Dean said to Sam, later, after the kids had been taken up to bed and they were sitting looking at the tree, each with a small glass of whisky in their hands.
“Well, they do say intercourse takes a tremendous amount of calories for the average Alpha,” Angel said. “And I could go for a burger. Do you know someplace we could get a burger?”
“So what, I’m just supposed, get on a plane and leave my whole life behind. Leave you and the kids behind.”
So Dean did the obvious thing and wrapped his lips around Michael's cock, feeling it spray the back of his throat, every bit as generous as you would expect an Alpha's come to be. It had the same spicy, rich flavor it had when he'd licked it from Castiel's cunt. When the flood had stopped, Cas put a small hand mirror up to him, showing how the pearly stripes dripped from his face.
It seemed playful, more like the tussling of two young Alphas than anything dangerous. Not a real dominance struggle, but two Alphas letting loose. There wasn’t any of the stink of two Alpha scents competing to blot out the other. Still, there were limbs all over the place and the sturdy, heavy kitchen table, which had been made out of stripped and peeled logs, got shoved and moved by the vigor of their struggle, a kitchen chair got tipped over. Dean wondered if he should vacate the kitchen for safety and ended up climbing to perch on the countertop, so curious he couldn’t make himself leave. You would have thought Castiel would have the clear advantage. In many ways, the twins were exactly, equally matched, but Castiel had gained some muscle mass from working his body that Jimmy didn’t have. He must have had hand to hand training as part of his military service. But every time it seemed that Cas had Jimmy pinned, Jimmy shimmied and twisted his way out of the pin, usually flipping Cas in the process.
“Duty calls,” Castiel said. In one instant, his world had crumpled until all that was left was that duty. He had best attend to. He held his head high and plastered a smile on his face as he left the Ball, no Cinderella, no Price Charming, just a broken hearted man whose Omega didn’t understand why his mate had been near and now was gone. Soon,  they were back on the highway, headed to Kansas City and his hotel. He stared out the window at the flat land they drove through, so unlike the mountains of Eden. It was dark out there, a long race to the horizon filled with the glittering lights of Kansas City. He felt dead, like the part of him that was him had died and desiccated.
Dean just about went weak in the knees at that sound. His voice was like honey and smoke. It seemed to right through Dean’s ears directly down his spine to parts below. Dean flushed a little because he could smell the scent of his own slick rising up from him, his arousal obvious to all the but the scent blind. There were things an Omega couldn’t help, but it was all so pointless and embarrassing. The Marshal was as delicious an Alpha as Dean had ever come across, that was true, but Dean would never surrender himself to an Alpha, not even just for a single night. He had obligations. Important ones.
“You can’t come in here. There’s an official investigation,” they were told by the man. He was kind of ugly, doughy in the middle and with five o’clock shadow that was the opposite of sexy somehow. His name was agent Figgis.
It hadn’t changed much since Dean had moved in, but the night stand on Dean’s side of the bed had a handful of framed photographs- Dean and Sam, young Dean, almost a toddler still, with a lovely blond woman- Dean’s mother Mary. Even a small photo of young Sam and Dean with the elder Winchester on the hood of that wreck of a car he drove.
Castiel frowned and sighed heavily, but he stood up straight, easy stance, hands resting on the butts of his revolvers. “Since you insist. It seems a waste of a deck of cards though.”
“Why’d you wait so long?” Dean asked when they could breathe again. By then, they seemed to have lost the interest of the crowd and were about as private as you could be on a public street. They could talk and maybe Castiel could give some explanation. “I know when you left for Omaha, I wasn’t ready for you then. Maybe not even when I saw you at the show five years later. But on the train to Kansas City I was. Twenty five years you made me wait. It’s almost more than a man can stand.”
“But it’s better than nutthin’ right?” Added Johnny Bob. He was always the more optimistic of the pair.
A make-up or rescheduled celebration wasn’t their custom. If a sacred or other important date was somehow missed, it was let go. Celebrated the next year if it was one of the cyclical holidays. They should give Dean this though, given the circumstances. Castiel wished he could give Dean a whole new mating ceremony on a night that wasn’t also a natural disaster, but that was the sort of thing you didn’t get do-overs for.
“Ah, he’s an Omega suffragette. Isn’t that cute, Clarence?” Meg said, but when Castiel starting getting supplies out of the pack to make some kind of supper, she said, “He really does have you whipped, doesn’t he?”
“The man was throwing away money left and right in a poker game, about to start a fight with the man relieving him of it. Your pa tried to break it up, get your hired man to call it a night. Half a dozen witnesses saw them exchange words in front of the saloon. Azazel pulled a revolver, shot your Pa point blank in the chest and stole something from his pocket. That’s what the witnesses say.”
“Like she’s mental?” Charlie asked. She went to dig through a closet and returned with some kind of spray cleaner. She flourished it and sprayed down the desk with an enthusiasm that seemed far in excess of finding anti-germ cleaning spray.
It didn’t matter though. Dean felt so loose and peaceful that he easily drifted to sleep on top of his Alpha. Dean woke alone in his own bedroom, covered by a blanket, in the bright sun of mid morning. He’d been downstairs when he’d fallen asleep for sure. Castiel must have carried him upstairs. He should have expected it, the Alpha being so much bigger and stronger than him but it felt strange, but good. Like there was no question that Cas could protect him.
They all bent to their individual work for a while. These full moons were one of the few times in a month they could just sit, relax and not have Meg or Castiel riding their ass about some chore or another. Sam was working on another tunic, a winter one in thick, green wool. He was working the embroidery first and doing another knot work pattern, this one outlined in buttonhole stitch.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief when he got the last box and set of envelopes out to Baby, ready to be dropped at the post office. He had his school bag with him and his bag with his uniform for later working at the Dew Drop Inn. Sam was off to the high school already. Dean had discovered, thanks to Sam, that even an Omega didn’t need a father’s permission to enroll in the community college. They’d even helped him find a small scholarship, one meant just for Omegas like him,  that covered most of his tuition and books. So he’d enrolled, told himself just enough to get his GED. He was still working on that. He could only manage a class at a time and sometimes he still had to drop the class, so two years after he should have graduated from high school, he was still working on getting his GED.
The handwriting style seemed a little like Jimmy’s, like they’d come from a common place a while back, but Jimmy’s had gotten more relaxed, gained some curves, while this writing was as sharp and harsh as the writer.
Once Dean had taken up his responsibilities as pack Omega, Castiel would see how much of this could be automated. He couldn’t picture Dean wanting to run things with a little notebook and manually written checks. Perhaps, despite her supposed talent at it, Hannah should not have much more to do with the financial management of the pack. He thought again about Meg’s warning, that there needed to be a pack split and Hannah needed to go with the other faction. He dreaded the thought, but Meg probably had a point.
That brought a moment of sadness, Dean seeming to be on the verge of tears suddenly. It was probably the first time in many years where Sam didn’t have to be Dean’s first thought on waking and the center of his day. Maybe it would be a good idea to go on that road trip honeymoon first thing, to ease Dean into his new life. On a road trip at least there would always be the distraction of the new. The need to get miles under the tires would substitute for something to do.
“One, I’m serious. Any dishonor to you is a dishonor to my Alpha, so yeah, Imma bust his chops. Two, you let them talk to you like you’re a bitch and they start treating you like one. Three, it’s literally my job to bust his chops. If it wasn’t that, I’d find something,” she said, before stomping off, probably to find another person to make their life hell too.
Castiel stood in front of a rather larger crowd than he’d anticipated. For someone whose pictures were seen in hundreds of movie palaces by untold thousands of people, he was surprisingly nervous to stand here with all those eyes watching. It wasn’t that it was many more people than had been to the movie premier he had faced relatively nonchalantly. Perhaps it was that most of these faces were familiar ones, not strangers in a crowd. These were mostly people he had known. Many of them he cared for deeply, like Gabriel who was standing to his side, his witness. Sam was already at the altar to the far right, waiting for Dean as his witness. There were people from Fort Smith, like Jody and Garth. There were people that he didn’t know, but he had seen Dean talking and laughing with earlier in the day.
“You seem to be enjoying yourself,” Castiel said as Dean was finishing up, just about ready to mount up.
They stared at each other a moment. They stared until the point where it was uncomfortable, like Novak’s blue eyes were boring wells down deep into Dean’s soul. The man didn’t even seem to blink. Then Dean held out his hand. “We have a deal then? Be ready to ride. We’ll leave first light.”
“Dean, Meg is not a friend, nor even particularly friendly, but if she decides it aligns with her personal interests, she may render us assistance. I have allied before with her on a hunt.”
With that, Castiel turned to his bed. It was framed into the wall of the long house like a cabinet or closet, raised up from the floor. Back in the lands of their ancestors, the closed-in space kept heat in for sleeping on those long, long winter nights of bitter cold. Not needed in modern houses, but still appreciated in the longhouse during the winter when the only heat was the central hearth fire. Thankfully, his was bigger than those traditional box beds. His ancestors thought sleeping flat was too much like the sleep of death, so they always slept in a semi-reclined position and their box beds were sized for the semi-upright position.
Dean could go back to bed. It wasn’t like he had to get Claire up and get her ready for the day. He couldn’t even do that any more. He didn’t have classes today.  He had nothing, not really.
“I wouldn’t count on it,” Castiel said, standing up from the table and walking away. “I’ll let you known if I’m available again sometime. I may not return for some time. I might not return to California at all.”
I don’t want to say too much when I do because I don’t want to spoil anything coming further up in the story. Suffice it to say, thank you so much. It feels like such support of my work to see them.
Dean had cleaned Castiel's pussy, licked it clean of the semen the older brother had left behind. It tasted spicy and rich, delicious. He loved the smell this older brother Alpha left on and in his best friend and Omega lover.
"That's done any good it's going to do you, hours ago," she said. "You won't have to wear one anymore, unless you want to. And if you do, we've got much better ones for you to pick from. Well, no rips or prolapse. That's good. Just a little swelling, which is normal, given your circumstances, and will go down soon. We'll give you cold packs for that. Now, I was told you were given three injections? Could you show me the size?"
“Yes,” Dean said, his heart all twisted up with all the words that had been said to him in the last few hours. Promises had been made and bonds of affection and love had been affirmed, but there had been rejection as well, and Dean had been slighted by the pack this afternoon. There had been so much love and drama his head spun. It wasn’t what he really wanted but it would be enough, he thought. It would not be that bad to be mated to Castiel. Everyone said he was a good man. Dean just wanted to go home, maybe to Bobby’s house or even his room at Jimmy’s house in Folsom, and to lie down. He wanted this to be over with. Sometimes the only way forward is through, so he would just go through with this.
“You are my mate,” Castiel said, as if that explained everything. “I would do anything in my power to keep you safe.”
Castiel was surprised. He would have thought Dean would think only about last full moon and their disastrous mating, that there would be bad memories here. He thought of a shaking, fearful mate and of a coupling where there had been no joy and little pleasure. He thought of Dean so frightened he’d asked for the calming pheromones.
“Me too,” Angel said. “I wasn’t even intending to walk in that bar, but I got a hint of your scent on the sidewalk outside and I followed it to you. I hope you never let me go again.”
Castiel nodded his farewell and walked up to the farmhouse where he might find Garth. He settled up, paying him for the days the big bay had been there. He gathered his gear, saddled his new horse. As he mounted, he supposed he ought to give the horse an actual name. A kind name. He’d had four different mounts in the previous ten years and each one of them he’d called dumbass, thinking them nothing but big, stupid animals. He’d definitely call the big bay a name that had less dumb, less ass in it.
“His mating should have been the happiest day of his life and he’ll look back and think only that the people that should love him the most didn’t and that the people who should have been around him weren’t. It didn’t seem right. I couldn’t imagine any one of them could be that unkind, much less all of them, so I asked around. I should never have relied on Hannah to organize it even though I didn’t have time myself. I didn’t know. I didn’t think. Every Omega I asked told me the same thing. They were all disappointed they weren’t able to take part but they understood that Dean needed to not have such a big crowd around him at such an intimate moment. Everyone except Bess and she’s still denning with Gertie for a couple of weeks, so she couldn’t have been asked. Hannah told them that, that Dean didn’t want more than a few people with him.”
“You cannot understand what you’d face,” Novak said. “The Territories is no place for an Omega. The protections of American law do not exist once the river is crossed.”
He reached for Dean, thinking to gentle him into this with soft kisses and tender touches, to make love to him. Castiel had been celibate since meeting Dean, but he was not a virgin and most of his former lovers had said good things about his skills in bedroom matters. Thinking about what would happen next, even before their bodies touched, Castiel grew achingly hard and eager to begin. As Castiel pulled Dean close, he felt the Omega shivering, as if in fear, and Dean said, “Please, don’t. Just do what you have to do, but don’t do anything else. Please.”
“Not with Michael as my father’s heir,” Castiel said. “I’m Pack Alpha only because two of my brothers have died and two of them might as well have. I never thought it would happen. The expectation was that I would go out into the world and make something of myself. Jimmy was Michael’s favorite brother, so there was a place for him here because Michael insisted on it.”
Dean didn’t say anything. Couldn’t say anything for the shock of it. Just last night, he’d been ignored, not even acknowledged, much less offered the seat at the right hand of this Alpha.
That didn’t seem right, but he could scent it on the Omega and felt Dean’s small, hard cock against his body. Could he hope that it was actually him that Dean wanted? And not himself as a proxy for his twin? He should have carried Dean over to the family room sofa. They could scent together there, innocently. He was selfish though. He wanted. They were mates, after all. He could take Dean to a bed. He wouldn’t importune, wouldn’t even suggest they get undressed together, but they could lie together in a bed, their bodies seeking closeness and maybe see what happened.
It wasn’t that he’d forgotten that he’d invited Dean to eat with him in the Hall that night. It was that the Jimson farm had officially come onto the market that day. The timing was almost too fortuitous, but the storm had taken down the barn, the farmhouse and almost every structure on the property and it would be sold as is, no clearing or salvage done. Much of the current corn crop had been ruined by the storm apparently, enough to make it not commercially viable to harvest this year.
“Are you sure you want me to do this?” He asked again, holding up a hank of hair, wondering just how to start. “Maybe we should go into town and get it done professionally.”
He didn’t have to worry about that. Or moving. Dean took care of that, riding Castiel’s cock up and down, a little slowly and cautiously at first, but then he closed his eyes and a look of bliss transformed his face. From that moment, it was as he were driven. Perhaps he was, just driven in search of this sensation. He moved and Castiel’s world was moved. He had never thought it would be like this, mating with his Omega. Even though he knew that Dean would not be satisfied to lie back and be taken, Castiel hadn’t expected it would be him, being taken by his Omega. That’s what it felt like, like being eaten up, but not somehow, diminished at all by it. Dean was demanding, searching for every bit of sensation and pleasure that Castiel’s cock could bring him.
“Don’t change. You look lovely wearing that,” Castiel said. He did look beautiful, the soft green Smokkr picking up the color of his eyes, the rest of the garments in muted browns and whites. They suited Dean far more than Amelia, who’d looked washed out and pale in that combination, perhaps why it was her second or even third best, despite the fine needlework that had gone into it. Maybe he would ask Amelia if she could help him gift Dean a similar outfit. One always intended for an Omega though.  One cut to Dean’s petite size.
“That was the judge’s verdict,” Castiel said, lowering his hands. “I did not remain to see it done.”
He should have gone with Dean though. He was torn. He was needed by his mate, yes. But he was needed on pack lands, not just because of last night’s disaster, but because his sense that the danger was there. He couldn’t escape the feeling it wasn’t just his mate in danger, but his whole pack. Meg was ferreting around and she would find something, but it wasn’t enough. It hadn’t helped that when they’d walked out into the light of the new day, Dean had seemed so small, so shaken. He had done that. He’d been so ashamed and he’d given into cowardice. He had turned away from what he had done.
Garth and Bess were good people. Castiel couldn’t possibly object to Dean spending time with them. Maybe having Bess to visit would give him an excuse to visit the pack lands. That was something he could do, right? Visit with another young Omega matron. He wouldn’t be in Castiel’s way if he were visiting with Bess. Cas didn’t want him to work in Folsom, but maybe Dean should try for a job on pack lands? That would give him a reason to be there? The weaving workshop? He didn’t like it, but he knew how and he was moderately skilled at it. Maybe they would follow through with that plan for Dean to take over Pack Omega stuff?
“He and I will see that the head house is cleared and closed down until I need it,” Castiel said. “Or, he might elect to stay here more now.”
“If only we could just make him go away for good,” Cas said. “There has to be something. A restraining order is only a piece of paper if the police are willing to release him after he did this to you.”
“No, we have to get going. We have to get out of here,” Dean said, reaching for the door handle, but finding it hard to even get a grip on it. Sam was watching him, looking alarmed. He looked pretty exhausted himself, but going nearly feral like that was bound to take it out of a pup.
She was gentle as she helped him lie back on the table and spread his legs. She pulled a pair of socks out of a cabinet and helped him pull them on. She gave him a medical gown- the first kind of clothing he'd had in hours. And as she finally got down to examining him, she explained everything in a soft, deep voice as she touched him here and there. She tugged and pulled out the plug from him. She dropped it into the trash.
She was so pretty and Jimmy. Well, Jimmy looked at her like a real life illustration of that heart eyes emoji. Dean had figured that the existence of Claire presupposed the existence of some kind of mother. He’d thought it would be an Omega, but here she was, Beta, blonde and blue eyed, and full of that kind of loveliness you only ever had when someone looked at you like Jimmy looked at her. Yes, Dean had met the man of his dreams and his beautiful wife and their perfect daughter.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Sam said. “Look, now isn’t a good time to discuss this. I’m in a meeting.”
Not many people were out, though Dean always walked cautiously. He’d been able to map out a route home that only took him across Eden Pack ‘territory’ for a block. An Omega on their own usually wasn’t in danger, not on the safe streets of Folsom anyway, but there were always Alphas who liked to harass and pester. One of them, a jogger, started to try their usual game, doubling back to get a better view, wolf whistling maybe, trying to chat Dean up even when Dean thought it made it pretty clear he didn’t want to chat. This time though, as the jogger got close again, he stopped dead in his tracks, flaring his nostrils and coming no closer.
For years, Dean had had a recurring dream of riding the trail with Castiel. In the dream, they weren’t riding in search of a killer. Just riding to ride. The stars and moon would be brilliant in the sky overhead, the sky itself a velvet black dome that stretched from horizon to horizon, limitless, the trail never ending.
Cas laughs, and the movement causes a fresh wave of tears to spill from his eyes. "Dean, how could I forget the first time I saw you on Earth?" He laughs again. "Which was also the first time you stabbed me."
Dean gives Sam a level, steady gaze. "Positive," he says firmly. "I need to do this by myself. And besides," he smirks, shooting a wave to Eileen over Sam's shoulder. "I'm sure you have a lot of catching up to do."
She stands for a moment, breathing deep through her nose to compose herself. She turns to go, and Dean calls out to her in desperation.
Until Dylan pulls open his closet door, and Dean feels his tether to the earth, stronger than he's felt in ages. Dylan is brushing his hands over the clothes, nearing the handprint jacket, when Dean shouts, "No!"
When Cas is recovered, they move out of the bunker. It's just them. It's quiet. They leave all the ghosts behind.
Dean holds the jacket tightly, with the handprint facing up, as he bows his head and closes his eyes.
Dean takes a shaky breath and tries again. "Cas," he murmurs. "I don't know if you can hear me. God, I hope you can hear me. You always could before."
He crosses to his closet and opens it, reaching out to touch the jacket Cas stained with his bloody handprint. Dean barely has to think about it. His fingers brush the stained fabric with ease.
"He's been here too long," Dean says, and the stab of guilt is worse than any knife. "We'll get him outta here. He'll be okay."
So Dean gets more aggressive. He starts moving objects, displacing them just enough for it to be eerie. He scatters books around the library, opened to convenient pages. When he can muster up the energy, he painstakingly underlines the relevant parts of the text.
Dean turns to look back to the portal through which he came, but there's nothing there. Nothing behind him. Nothing in front of him. Nothing around him.
Dean hears Chuck's mocking laughter again. "And you thought...what, exactly? That you'd be able to save the day with the power of love? Don't be stupid. That's just bad writing."
It's easier to focus outwards. Dean reminds himself to hold it together for Jack, for Sam. It's not Jack's fault. Dean can't blame him. He did his best.
Sam and Miracle both turn towards him. Miracle starts growling low, and Sam's eyes widen. Usually Dean would be laughing, telling him he looks like a moose in headlights, but usually Dean isn't the one making Sam look like he's seen a ghost.
Dean speeds after them, calling "help me, help me, help me," but they don't stop until they get to the door. Wendy is the last one through, and Dean cries out desperately, with all the fear boiling up in him, "help me!"
Dean is almost halfway through the library when a sound shatters his world. It's quiet, but the bunker has been silent for so long it may as well be a jet engine.
They find Michael and bring him back to the bunker, but he can't open the God Book, so that's a bust. Sam is trying to plan next steps when Dean's phone rings. He's five or six beers in at that point, so he doesn't realize how weird it is that his phone is ringing when there are only three people left on Earth, and one of them is in the same room as him.
There is a hushed, musical sound, like tinkling bells. Dean opens his eyes, and sees a dark, twisting portal opening before him.
Dean looks at Sam, but doesn't actually see him. He sees Cas instead. He sees Cas on the first night they met, the way he looked when Chuck brought him back. He blinks, and he sees Cas in the Croatoan future, shrugging loosely and saying, "I like past you." He sees Cas walking into the lake. He sees Cas as Emmanuel, not recognizing Dean. He sees Cas in Purgatory, for the first time and the last time. He sees Cas grinning brightly though his eyes are filled with tears.
So when Sam goes out to the garage, Dean follows. He's getting better at the whole walking-through-walls thing, so slipping straight through the car door to rest in the backseat seems easy. He tries to stay still as Sam opens the driver's side door and folds himself into the driver's seat, calling Miracle up after him. She settles in the passenger seat as Sam starts up the car, and Dean can still feel the familiar rumble of the engine vibrating through him. It's comforting and alien at once, feeling something that makes him feel so alive when he knows he's not.
He's dead, he knows that. He's died before, but he's never been here before. Wherever he is, it feels unfamiliar. Dean has never been able to remember the details of his previous deaths (for which he's grateful), but he can remember where he went afterwards.
Most days, Dean doubts whether he's a good person. Most days, Dean doesn't think he's ever deserved to be saved.
Dean fights the urge to clench his jaw the same way Meg just did. He smooths out his features, and remains calm.
Meg clicks her tongue. "Clever boy," she says, and snaps her fingers again. Chuck and Amara appear in the no man's land between Dean, Jack, and Cas, and all the inhabitants of the Empty. The two deities are motionless. Asleep.
Then Jack sits bolt upright, and Dean takes a knee beside him, keeping his hand on Jack's arm in the hopes that it's reassuring. "Dean, I'm so sorry," Jack says, and his eyes are filled with horror as they find Dean's. "I couldn't - I didn't - it-"
For the first time in his existence, he feels like he has a real choice over what he does next. It may not be his
"I'm really as close as this," Jack concludes, placing his hand over his heart. He contemplates the feeling for a moment, then lifts his hand in farewell. "Goodbye," he states. So simple, so unpretentious. So unlike Chuck.
"It's been a long week," Sam mutters as he turns away from Dean and continues down the hallway. "Let's go, girl. We both need some sleep."
What Cas did for him, what Cas said, what Cas felt, it wasn't easy to handle. Dean has grown over the years, but there's a younger, more selfish version of himself that would have raged at Cas leaving him like that, leaving Dean to carry the burden of their love alone.
More than anything, Dean hopes that his actions in death can make up for his actions in life. He expects no reward, no express ride to Heaven. He just wants Cas to get the life he deserves. Cas deserves to be saved.
He's considering drowning Chuck in the lake when Chuck says he'd be honored to be killed by the Winchesters. He looks at Dean. "The ultimate killer," he laughs.
"Yeah!" agrees Wendy, a little too enthusiastically. Dean follows them back upstairs, still clutching the paper with his spell on it.
"They're already dead," whispers Burt one night, his face lit eerily by the portable lantern they have set up in the War Room. None of the bunker's lights work, though the power is running.
He fills his lungs to capacity, summons every ounce of will he has, and bellows as loudly as he possibly can, "I'd like to speak to a manager!"
That one hits him, and Dean starts to sway. Sam slings an arm around Dean's waist and turns them toward the Impala, half-dragging, half-carrying Dean. He carefully seats Dean in the passenger seat, finds the keys, starts driving away.
Burt, the bald, bearded man, seems to notice very little in general. Nervous Jamie, despite his thick glasses, misses all of Dean's messages. The woman, Flora, comes closest, but the best reaction Dean gets out of her is when she looks over her shoulder as if to check she's not being watched. She is being watched, but Dean is right in front of her.
He takes it gently in his hands and dusts it off without realizing he's doing it. It's not actually dusty, but he feels he has done it some harm by throwing it away like he did.
Dean rises to his feet and extends a hand to Jack, who lets Dean pull him up. "So, we got zero exit strategy, one missing angel, and two gods on the loose. Whaddya say, kid? Do those bastards even have a chance?"
Cas doesn't stir under Dean's touch. Dean can barely register Cas' body under his hand, neither cold nor warm, neither dead nor alive.
"And it isn't about you. Well, it is," Dean is full-on babbling now. "But if you want to keep going, you can, you can do whatever you want, but I think it's time for me to retire. For me. And for you. And for us."
A tiny, distant star twinkles to life in his chest. It's not much, but it's hope. It gives Dean enough to finally rise from his place on the floor of the War Room. There's a fine layer of dust on every surface. He skates his fingertips over one of the tables as he walks to his room. Nothing is left behind.
Based on the slash in his neck and his current environment, Cas guesses he must have been hurt, badly. Loathe to make any major movements, Cas wiggles his toes, which all appear to be in working order. He starts to catalogue the sensations in the rest of his body, noticing several twinging muscles, a deep ache in his chest that he suspects are several broken ribs, and a sling holding his right arm to his chest. He tries to take in a deep breath, and hisses at the way his expanding lungs press against his fragile ribs, and notices another line of pain burning up the left side of his abdomen. Stitches, he thinks, and some serious ones. He tries to remember what happened before he woke up, but the memory, like the room around him, is shrouded in mist.
"We won," Dean says, allowing a note of righteous fury to bleed into his voice. He watches Chuck flip through the God Book as they explain "Plan B," but Dean's patience is wearing thin. He can't wait to get his hands on Chuck, finally, after so long.
Could this be his chance? Maybe the hunters could help him get what he needs for the ritual. Or they could get spooked and run away, leaving Dean alone again. Or they could hunt Dean, banish him, and end his existence permanently. Shit.
"Cas, you had me. You always had me. Maybe from the night we met, maybe from the first time I lost you, but you always, always had me. I didn't know I could want you. I didn't know how. But I did, I do. I have never loved like I have loved you. I love you." And Dean's eyes well over, and he's laughing and crying and he can't stop saying it. "I love you, I love you so much, I-"
He noticed it when Cas had sacrificed himself. Sacrificed himself for Dean. Knowing the truth had made Dean feel like he was bursting at the seams, chafing at the inside of his skin. Everything he wanted to say, everything he felt, all the love he had to give, was struggling for a way out.
"They brought you to where they were holding me, so they could kill you as I watched," Dean whispers. "Kill you, then kill me. That was the plan. And it was all my fault, Cas, I'm so sorry. I couldn't get out, I couldn't get to you."
A lot of his prayers turn to apologies. To Cas, to Jack, to Sam, even though Sam is just down the hall. The list is long. Guilt, a constant companion in Dean's life, is never far away in death either.
Pushing himself up to a sitting position, Dean overcorrects, and has to grab onto the edge of the table to avoid falling. A few empty beer bottles clink as they roll across the floor, much too loudly, and he groans.
They're home, technically. Dean wonders if he can still call it that. Sam offers Dean a hand to help him out of the car, but Dean brushes him off. He's had enough pity for today.
From the floor, Dean watches, desperately trying to force some kind of sound from his chest, some words that will stop Sam from leaving. But he can't seem to remember how to speak.
Chuck turns to say something to Sam, but Dean doesn't hear. Chuck vanishes. Dean gasps for air, and understands how it feels to drown.
Dean gets back to work. He tries to focus his mind solely on Cas, to keep himself steady. He's going to get Cas back. Cas is going to come home. After so long away, Dean has to re-train his body to interact with the physical world. It takes some time before he can even pick up books again.
Meg raises her hand straight up at the wrist. She's opening the portal to Earth, but it almost looks like a goodbye.
Looking to his left and right, Dean can see the hints of outlines of shapes. Looking down, he can almost see his feet. Looking up, a few gentle twinkles, like stars peeking through cloud cover.
Jack's mouth twitches upward, just a little, his serene, peaceful smile becoming something wistful. He turns back to fully face Dean and Sam. "Thank you, Dean. I will do my best."
He would make Dean pull over as they were driving through one middle of nowhere from a different middle of nowhere. Sam would sleep in the backseat, and Cas would ride up front with Dean to keep him company. He'd make sure Dean was staying awake, change out cassettes when they needed something new, watch the sides of the road for any animals fixin' to become roadkill. Mostly, they just rode in a shared, comfortable silence. But some nights Cas would crane his neck around, stick his head out the window and gaze up at the sky, before announcing that there were excellent stargazing conditions. He'd stare at Dean solemnly as he delivered the news, as if it was just an important fact Dean needed to know. But Dean knew that if Cas was saying it, he needed to find a pullout to park the car.
Gravity may not work in the Empty, but it definitely still works on Earth. As the portal closes behind Dean and Cas, Dean nearly topples under Cas' weight. He manages to carefully lower them both to the floor of the barn, kneeling as he carefully supports Cas' head with his right hand and covers Cas' heart with his left.
Cas raises a hand to Dean's jaw, and gently turns Dean's face so their eyes meet again. He's smiling, and it's more perfect than Dean had imagined.
"Did you hear that?" she asks, and it's Wendy's voice. She shines her flashlight directly into Dean's eyes without seeing him.
"I gotta get out of here," Sam says. "Because either I'm talking to a ghost right now, or I'm crazy enough to think I am. This place isn't good for me, or for Miracle. We're going to move in with Eileen, and hopefully...hopefully I can put this all behind me. I miss you, Dean. But I can't let you hold me back."
"It was supposed to be a simple job." Dean still can't meet Cas' eyes. "Just a grab-and-stab, something we've done a million times. But I screwed up."
Jamie picks up a few of the books and scans through them, but he doesn't appear to do anything with the information.
"It looks like someone was buried alive in here," Hazel adds. "You know, those stories about claw marks on the inside of a coffin lid?" She shivers.
Dean has been struggling desperately against the current for the past few days. This is what finally makes him let go, with neither rage nor hope to cling to. He averts his eyes downward, trying to focus on anchoring his feet to the earth. Knowing this is a battle he cannot win, Dean still tries to resist being swept away by the powerful waves of loss and grief that crash over him.
Emotion buzzes in the air, fury and fear. Dean can't see anything distinct, just layers upon layers of shadows, darting into and out of his periphery. He shouldn't be able to see anything in the black void of the Empty, but his eyes instinctually pick up the movement.
He was so stupid, thinking he could save Cas. Dean could never do anything like that. Never do anything that good.
Dean tears his eyes away from Cas' face when he hears footsteps in the hallway. Sam skids into view, Eileen and Miracle right behind him. "You're back!" Sam cries. "I heard the portal close, and Eileen felt it, and-" Sam comes crashing to a verbal halt as he notices Cas, unmoving. "Is h-" Sam starts, but Jack holds up a hand to stop him.
Dean nods almost-imperceptibly at the most recent vision of Cas. He can feel Cas' warm hand on his shoulder again. When Dean blinks, he's gone.
Most often he retreats to his room, which Sam seems to avoid. Dean doesn't need to sleep, but he does find it easier to physically manifest when he hasn't done it for a while. It's like his ghost batteries are recharged. Most of the time he spends thinking. Sometimes he talks to Cas, telling him all the things he's been wanting to say since Cas was taken. Other times he'll update Cas on his progress, share excitement over a new possible ritual that could open the Empty. When he's really missing him, he prays, though he knows Cas can't hear him.
A weapon? Maybe, but Dean has so many that he doesn't think he could attach himself to one. It's gotta be something important, something that anchors him. Something Dean wouldn't be Dean without.
It's empty. Cleaned out except for the furniture, reminiscent of every cheap, bare-bones motel room of their childhood.
In the meantime, he keeps researching, and he helps Sam. Dean tries his best to steer clear of Sam, but it's hard to tamp down his older brother instincts. One night Sam is up reading in the library long past his usual bedtime, and Dean, curious, sneaks a peek at his notes after he goes to bed. It looks like Sam is tracking a lamia, but he's mistaken it for a vampire. In the stack of books next to Sam's computer, Dean finds the one with the most information on lamias and leaves it on top of the pile.
The same quiet tinkling of bells as before announces the opening of a portal. Dean looks up at the stars, giving a nod of thanks before he steps through.
He's interrupted only moments later by Eileen and Sam coming back down the hallway. Each of them is carrying a heavy-looking box in their arms. They pass by quietly, and  Dean races down the hall to look in Sam's room once they've gone.
Dean paces around his small, cluttered room until he hears the hunters rising from their rest, presumably the next morning. He hears them go into the kitchen and start making coffee. As with most other things, it makes Dean think of Cas.
Standing now, Dean is acutely aware of the absence of the solid earth that was supporting him. His thoughts are swirling around him, crashing over him, threatening to drag him back under. Like sneaker waves, they catch onto his ankles and pull at his knees.
Rituals, spells, ingredients, potions. In desperation, he hunts the storerooms. He finds a few of the things he needs, but not enough. There's nothing else Dean can harvest from the bunker, and he has no way out.
"I bet there's a key around here somewhere," Wendy contributes, and Dean hears footsteps tromping down the hallway, away from his door.
"They did," says Meg flatly. "It was not easy to subdue them." She snaps her fingers once more, and they disappear.
Sam's voice drifts toward Dean, but it's hard to make out the words. They're blurry. He can't understand them. They're an ocean apart.
He can feel a pull in his...body? He's not sure if he's even corporeal, but it's like his cells are being drawn to a magnet, embedded invisibly in the gray in front of him.
"You...you brought everyone back...even..." Dean's voice gets lower as he continues, and his voice cracks on the last word. It was hard enough to say Cas' name the first time. It feels dangerous to ask for something - someone - out loud, in the open. Admitting he needs Cas back feels like he's inviting every monster within a thousand-mile radius to interfere. He's in shark-infested waters, and speaking his need aloud is reopening dozens of bloody wounds.
Dean's staring at him from the doorway. He's gone completely numb, all emotion pushed out of his head by one all-consuming thought.
Dean throws himself into reading while Sam is away. It's slow going. It's not like he expected any of the books to have a grab-and-go Empty-opening spell conveniently highlighted, but it can become tedious to read through thousands of pages for a single phrase that offers hope. But Cas is worth it.
Dean sighs. It's not that he expected the afterlife would be a walk in the park, but it sure would be a welcome change of pace.
The silence that follows in her wake is significantly less comfortable. The easiness has evaporated. Dean is shifting nervously in his seat, stare fixed on their joined hands again.
The doctor raises the lights in the room, and Cas blinks in the sudden, harsh glare. "Good, good," the frazzled doctor says, and she looks to Cas' left side, as if she's thinking about asking Dean to move. She must think better of that plan, because she moves around to Cas' right. She examines his various injuries, takes a look at his stitches, asks a series of rapid-fire questions about his condition. Cas answers as best he can.
For the first time since Cas woke up, Dean pulls his hand away, and Cas fears he's done something horribly wrong. Dean turns around, reaching behind his chair to rummage in his duffel bag, which Cas hadn't noticed until now. When he turns back to Cas, there's a small box in his hands.
Dean has always appreciated a good movie montage. He likes the way they move the story along, how they inspire and uplift. The music is usually pretty badass too. He wishes he had his own montage right about now, because being a ghost is
"Hey ladies, how you doin?" Dean asks. "Love what you've done with the place." He throws on his cheesiest, flirtiest grin, and receives identical scowls in return.
The door cracks open, revealing a doctor in navy scrubs and bright yellow clogs. "Hello, Mr. Winchester," she says, but she's looking straight at Cas. He shifts his eyes to Dean, who gives a brief, sure nod. He looks back to the doctor, whose eyes are thankfully on her chart. "It's so good to see you up. How are you feeling?"
Dean thinks about how proud Cas would be if he could hear Jack right now, talking about a beautiful new world where God has faith in people, where belief and love matter. He decides to follow Cas' example.
But Cas says, "I'm here, I'm hurt, can you let me in?" and Dean doesn't need feelings to tell him what to do as he sprints up the stairs and wrenches open the door.
Stepping softly, Dean makes his way to the back of the barn. Something catches the beam of his flashlight near the ceiling. Dean looks up and sees, in the back left corner of the barn, one lamp with a single, intact lightbulb. The lamp sways gently in the night breeze drifting through the patchy roof.
Sam gets in the car, and Dean turns the keys in the ignition, bouncing his left knee impatiently. He shoots a mild glare at Sam, tilting his head as if to say, "really?"
Dean slams the door shut, and it's all he can do to not collapse again as the last embers of hope in his heart flicker and fade.
"Absolutely not," Jack responds with a grin. "Let's get 'em." He picks a direction and starts walking, Dean alongside him.
Dean makes his way down to the dungeon. He remembers why he avoided it. Remembers the way Cas said "I love you." But he doesn't remember how he was taken, or why he did it. He can barely picture Cas' face.
Raising his eyes to meet Jack's, Dean sees his soft smile before he meets Jack's eyes, which are sure and certain.
It's for Cas. It's for kind, brave, unyielding, stupid, beautiful Cas, who gave everything he had to save Dean.
"Yeah, it kinda gives me the creeps," adds a tall, dark-haired woman, shining her flashlight into a corner.
It's a strange kind of peace, just sitting there in the dark, anchoring each other through their hands, Cas ruminates. It's strange, but everything about their time together has been strange. The past few weeks, after Dean brought Cas back from the Empty, had been stranger than ever and yet so frighteningly familiar. There were no more apocalypses to stop. Cas was human. He and Dean had both confessed their love for each other. They were more open with their affections, sure, but much of their relationship was the same as it had always been. It was just easier to say out loud.
"Cas," and it's a sob this time, almost a scream, too loud and too honest even though it will never be enough. He raises his shaking hands to cup Cas' face, praying his touch will light some spark of recognition in Cas' empty eyes. "Cas, I'm sorry, please, I need you, I lo-"
Jack raises his hand again, gives a single wave of his fingers, and turns away. He walks a few paces before dissolving into light.
Cas wouldn't hesitate in this situation. He wouldn't wait around for someone else to man up and take action (and Dean winces at that particular thought).
Dean steps through his bedroom door into the lit hallway. He walks the halls, taking stock of the bunker. He eventually finds Sam and Miracle sitting in the kitchen, Sam hunched over a steaming cup of something.
Dean gasps as he feels a hand on his shoulder, covering Cas' handprint. He doesn't dare open his eyes, afraid of what he may or may not see. The touch warms his skin, heats his muscle, sears his bone, burns his soul with the white-hot light of clarity.
"I want out," Dean says. "Jack, Cas, and I go free. No tricks. No strings. We walk outta here, back to Earth."
Dean should be afraid, but he doesn't feel it. He feels calm, steady. Cas keeps him grounded, reminds him what he needs to do.
Dean tips his head back to rest on the top of the seat, looking up toward the ceiling. It feels like a way to keep his head above water. He tries to breathe deep, but his breaths are stilted and ragged. His chest feels too small. He is again reminded of the feeling of Billie clutching his heart, crushing it with her fingers and puncturing it with nails like knives.
It's loud. Countless overlapping voices in long-dead languages, which Dean simultaneously can and can't understand.
"See, Jack here told me that the Empty got loud. I have a feeling he kicked that off, but it's still loud in here. Everyone is awake. In fact, the only ones gettin' any sleep around here have been the three of us," Dean says, tipping his head towards Jack as he finishes.
But day by day, as Dean fails to get their attention and their comrades fail to appear, the air in the bunker feels heavier, thicker.
He reaches out and picks up the book, and it's so easy. Dean smiles to himself. Montage accomplished.
"Of course you will," Dean reflexively replies, and he means it. The unfamiliar feeling of pure, unfiltered honesty is intoxicating. Dean heaves a deep breath and asks what he's been too afraid to ask until now.
Sam frowns. He even gets his eyebrows to turn down along with his mouth. "Dean, slow down," he says with exasperation. "We need to talk about this, whatever it is we're doing. We need to stop and think." Dean resists the instinct to roll his eyes again.
Faith is a funny thing. It's something Dean had never had, and something Cas had always had. Until they met. Cas was an unstoppable force and Dean was an immovable object, but Cas stopped and Dean moved, and they did it for each other. For love.
And then Chuck vanishes Miracle. And if it was easy to fall back into his work, it's even easier to fall back into his rage. Dean has one thought, and it's to end Chuck. He might even break out his good knives for that.
Cas has a sudden vision of the scene. He doesn't know if it's real, but he's able to picture himself unconscious and bleeding, bleeding out, blood staining Dean's shirt where Dean had carried him out of the demons' trap, cradling Cas against his chest and whispering a litany of prayers and pleas. He can see Dean carefully passing Cas' limp form off to the EMTs, watching as they lay him down on a gurney and load him into the ambulance, one EMT throwing out an arm to stop Dean from climbing up behind them. "Family only," says the EMT, and Cas can see Dean's eyes go blind with panic at the idea of leaving Cas even for a moment, and blurting out, "he's my husband, please," before the EMTs help him up into the ambulance to huddle next to Cas' side.
After a few steps, or a few hundred miles, the darkness becomes less dark. The shadows gain more definition. Holding a hand in front of his face, Dean can almost see its outline.
Deep scratches are etched into the walls of his room. They may have been words, once, but the scars overlap so that only occasional letters are legible.
After a long moment, Dean raises his eyes to meet Cas'. "They said I couldn't come with you. Family only. I wasn't gonna leave you."
He's rewarded with a short bark of laughter, and a little tension eases from Dean's shoulders as it becomes a quiet, continuous chuckle. "Jesus, man, I'm sorry. Yeah, you do. I just...I...didn't want to waste any time," Dean explains, a current of guilt woven into his words.
He still doesn't know what he's doing, but Dean at least knows where he's going. Pontiac, Illinois. It didn't come back to him immediately, but after skimming a few maps the inconspicuous little city had flashed at him like a beacon. He drives the Impala east out of Lebanon, pressing the gas pedal down further and further, racing his car almost as fast as his heart.
They walk until the silence feels a little less loud. A little less lonely. They walk until the shadows slow.
Billie cuts in before Meg can respond. "There's no way we're even considering this." Her tone is sarcastic, but there's real fear bleeding into it. "You can't bargain with a Winchester!"
Dean remains vigilant, constantly scanning the darkness on the horizon, checking behind them, looking for any hint of movement. It means that Jack sees Cas first.
A week after the hunters' arrival, Dean is getting desperate. From their conversations, Dean has learned that these three are on the run from an organized gang of demons out in Wyoming. They're hoping the other half of their band will join them soon, as they had promised to rendezvous at the bunker. Dean knows they won't stay forever. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Alone in his room, Dean shuts the door. His legs, having valiantly carried him this far, finally wobble, and he collapses with his back to the door and his knees drawn to his chest. It's so cliché, he thinks to himself. All he needs is some sappy music playing in the background, and his life would be a full-on chick flick.
Dean comes back to himself with two near-simultaneous thoughts. First, he thinks that this cold, dark, weightless silence must be what it feels like to be in space. Then he remembers how much Cas loved stargazing.
The voices are just outside Dean's bedroom door now. He can see light from their flashlights reflecting off the hallway floor.
Something flares in him when he thinks about going backward. Sanded down and blurred by the gray, he can't tell what exactly the feeling is. It feels positive.
Dean doesn't realize he's been frozen to the spot until he can suddenly move again, a boiling wave of panic freeing him. He rushes forward, grabs Cas by the shoulders and looks into his eyes, and they're...blank. There's nothing there.
There's a gentle, dim gray-white haze hovering just above Cas' eyes as he blinks them open. It reminds him of the low fog that clings to fields on autumn mornings. Just as chilly, too. He shivers a little, the air wherever he is a bit too cold for comfort. Where is he? Cas turns his head to look, but only manages to twist a few degrees before pain sparks bright before his eyes. A long, narrow line burns on the right side of his neck, running up from his collarbone to wrap behind his ear. His blood seems to be running right below the surface of the cut, searing his flesh. It must be a deep one.
Dean nods, gaze dropping to their clasped hands, where Cas' thumb is still tracing a soothing pattern over his skin. "You have a minor concussion," Dean says, and that explains a lot for Cas. "Coupla torn muscles, several broken ribs, dislocated shoulder. You lost a lot of blood when they slashed your neck. Ruptured spleen didn't help either." He pauses to let Cas take all this in, or maybe to steel himself for what comes next.
He may not know much about what happened for Winchester to call himself a monster but the way Winchester expressed his love caused Steves big heart to break.
Dean met Lee after the games. Castiel was asleep when Dean had a nightmare and because Dean did not want to disturb his boyfriend he walked on the outskirts of District 12, just a few feet away from the electrical fence.
“Burn in Hell, b*tch.” Dean hissed and aimed the arrow at Allister back palm, Allister cried out, in return releasing Castiel who sucker punched him in the throat.
Once they were out of the way, Dean took a breath and aimed his arrow. Focusing on the pack of apples hanging just above the mine.
Castiel, ever the adorable puppy yet possessive angel, “No one is allowed to get you pregnant but me Dean, no Norse God and no Knight of Hell who ha has issues about himself.” Stated firmly.
Unlike other Knights he was not only immoral and had the normal Demon Abilties but he also had the power to control the mind and reality of a person, he was also the Knight that created Druid magic, the ability to manipulate nature, which was apart of his power.
"Yup, he bore a mark that made him immortal, Humans call it the Mark of Cain, once you have it you become a Knight of Hell... I took the Mark."
"You mean you were kidnapped and the torture felt like Hell, like our Cyborg?" Tony asked, Steve ignored the nickname for Bucky.
Dean didn’t know why he felt this pull towards the boy from the Luxury District. There was something about him that screamed attention.
3 rabbits was their win. They hid their weapons in the usual tree branch that no one would come across.
“No, but we do have ways to give us an advantage, if what Crowley says is correct then you can’t fight a war without an Army, and recently, monster activity has been down, so my guess is, This douchbag is creating an army, and I am going to be teaching you guys how to kill monsters from the Supernatural world.”
"Start again, Stark... What actually happened?" Fury asked once he was done. There was something off though. It was as if Fury was pleading to be wrong. Which was so wierd.
Slinging the arrow and backpack over his shoulder, the bow resting across his chest, he grabbed onto a tree branch and then climbed to the middle. Heaving heavily as he heard the canons go Boom, Boom, Boom, indicating death.
Checkings in the prisons all over the World including the outer World, but no information was received about the
“He’s doing well.” Lisa commented idly and the Gabriel appeared on the screen talking about the relationship between the two males.
"Ooo guys, can I go now, Hope just came up with a hypothesis on the Quantum Machine, if what she discovered is correct then we could be getting a huge barrier break." Scott said excited. Forgetting his leg was castrated and then hissed in pain.
"You need to live Dean, for your brother, your life is important." Castiel gritted as he pinned Dean to the ground, holding the dagger against his own throat.
. The Supernatural world (except for heavan and hell, who refused to partake in humanites fight) was affected by the snap or blip.
In the beautiful crystal room, Gamesmaker Dick Roman stared at the berries in disdain. He expected this. He went against the rules.
Also I realised (read as forgot) Vision dies in Infinity War so this will also explain how he is alive.
Castiel, seeing Dean’s reaction, smirked and Dean tried to ignore the arousal at the hot expression.
He, like Cain, was Lucifers only and closest ally. But Druid got greedy for power and fell in love with the power Cain held,
After Dean left his rather proud message for the careers to see he started making his way towards North. He ate some fruit, drank some water and then trekked all the way towards the river.
"Winchester has been slipping on and off our radar and we were lucky enough to find out that he is here, in New York." Maria took over.
"What you came across, we are suspecting, was Demons." Fury held up. A hand at the interruption. "Wait for me finish... You see there is other crtures in this world as we found out first hand, Aliens and Mad Titans but there also creatures that come from legends."
He snuck out of his room towards the balcony, he stared at the sky which was clear and full of stars.
“People are betting and cheering on innocent kids as they kill each other… murder each other…for what? Pleasure, fun? It’s sick that they find freaking kids killing each other fun, bloody vultures.”
"It was Castiel that manged to do it, I was tudne Shuman, but the Mark can't be removed, it still whispers to me... To kill... To hurt... That with the guilt if trying to kill Sammy and nightmares of Hell... I was a danger, which is how I ended up here."
"Holy Shit, I got kidnapped by Captain freaking America." Dean said gleefully. Excitement and puppy dog expression.
"Stark, Rogers and Vison will be the Extraction, Barton, Barns and Wilson you'll be on look out, Banner and Lang you both are on comms and Wanda..." Fury looked at her with a pleading look, "You're on Parker duty."
They waited for the score haring. Gabriel and Dick Roman were calling out scores as each picture of the Tribute came on screen.
“No, too obvious…wait…” Dean then proceeded to whistle a soft tune and to Castiel’s surprise, a bunch of birds whistled back.
Stamina that beat the Super Soldier Serum, Super strength that beats the Super Soldier Serum, Telepathy, ect.
And Dammit, Sam looked like a kicked puppy and brotherly instincts forced Dean to pull his brother down into a hug.
Everyone’s eyes popped out of their head when the man pulled Dean into a full blown lip lock. Taking full control of the  kiss.
"Crowley, focus, and No Deals, these guys been through enough already." Dean scolded. Tony felt gratitude float through him. At least someone understood.
"So... Are we just going ignore the fact that our mark is currently moaning like he's having sex... whilst eating pie?" Tony Stark asked. They watched as the attractive man eat pie. The comms planted in the beautiful classic 1967 Chevrolet Impala was picking up the moans. The small Stark camera picking up the visual.
Thank you for the comments and Kudos. Even though I don't reply to most comments unless it's to clarify information in this book, it still motivates me to write more.
Dean stepped in the room and now knew why Jo was so pissed. It seemed like his audience was board already and were now eating and talking.
Castiel ignored the noise behind him as he aimed knife after knife. He pushed away thoughts off Dean Winchester as he aimed for the stimulation targets. Castiel wasn’t gay, he never actually found himself looking at the same gender sexually, but Winchester made him feel things.
His father caught Dean, Unknowingly, kissing a boy from a bar. Surprisingly his father just shrugged it off. He said he didn’t care who Dean slept with, as long as it didn’t effect his hunting and he wasn’t banging some monster.
“FRIDAY what’s going on? And if it’s dangerous please evacuate civilians and children including Pepper and Morgan.”
"What did you ask for? And how come you had a year?" Barns grunted. Winchester looked grimm. "My brother was killed, I asked to bring him back, little did I know that the it was all pre prophacised, but that's not the point of this, you don't need to know how the apocalypse was started yet,"
Sure it was a brave thing to do but District 12 was nothing. When his mentors, Uriel and Naomi, gave them the analysis he found himself captured by the beautiful man in District 12. The man with forest green eyes holding so much yet nothing, long eyelashes and pink plum lips. Freckles scattered like stars on his face and Castiel was curious as to weather he was littered in Freckles.
“Attention Tributes, unfortunately, there can only be one Victor, we are sorry for the inconvenience.” Dick Roman’s voice called,a clearly heard grin in his voice.
“Do you know what happened after you pointed out the berries were poisonous?” Shurley asked naturally.
