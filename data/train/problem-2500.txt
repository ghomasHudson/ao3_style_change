Maybe he should leave Dean alone to grief. Maybe he should go make some time to grieve, too. Maybe he should tell Jack about Cas. Maybe he should try some more to get through to anyone, anyone left on this planet, anyone who could be on their side. Maybe he should rest. He needs rest. Desperately.
That’s where you can’t keep going. The tears shake you up, you can feel yourself crumble, inside and out. “Please,” you whisper once more, with no wish behind it, because wishes are for children and for people who still have hope.
“Cas,” you whisper. “If you were here, maybe I still couldn’t say the words, but I could show you. Please let me show you.”
You think about the prayers you sent his way, all this time for all these years. You think about the times you prayed for his help, when you were backed into a corner with no way out. Even more you think about the times you prayed for his forgiveness – “please come back to me, please, I’m so sorry, please don’t leave me,
Hell. No wonder then, that Dean is like this. Sam can’t even imagine… what it must have been like for his brother, to hear Castiel say the words, and then to lose him. Sam can hear it in Dean’s voice: The disbelief, the wonder, the confusion. So, he really didn’t know. Sam was never sure, and he never wanted to ask. Knowing Dean, asking would have made it worse, most likely. He pulls Dean closer to his side, puts his chin on Dean’s head. Tries to make Dean feel what he’s probably not allowed to say, not even now.
Dean still doesn’t have a plan. So he licks his lips, clears his throat again, hopes quietly that he’s getting this right, and begins. “Look, I don’t make speeches. Not unless someone dies, or I die, I guess.” He chuckles, and he supposes that’s a sick inside joke to have with yourself, but then again, he didn’t choose this, all the dying and death around him; so he might as well make light of it. This – his words – he really gets to choose for once. It’s even harder than he imagined it. “You were gone before I got to make my speech for you. Not that I had one prepared, definitely not one that was gonna match yours, because. Damn.”
“What happened?” he asks again, and when Dean keeps on staring into the middle-distance without showing any reaction, Sam grabs his wrists and shakes him gently. “Dean.
You think of all the times you opened your mouth, but the words just wouldn’t come out, but even more. Even more you think about all the times you wanted to say something, you got
Where he is now, he can’t hear you. He will never hear you again, and you will never see his face again, and that’s how your prayer starts. “I wish I had looked at you more often when I still had the chance.” That’s not a prayer, not yet, but it becomes one when you add a choked “Please.” What you’re pleading for, you don’t know. Or rather, you do know, but it’s useless.
“Please,” you start again, but then you remember that begging is useless, and it’s even more humiliating than it always is, and you try once more. “If you were here…” You think about it. Yes, that’s good. That’s what he would have deserved to hear.
Dean holds onto him tightly and cries, and suddenly, Sam can’t stop himself anymore. The pain rips through his chest, claws its way up his spine, fills up his head and escapes him in breathless sobs. He holds onto Dean who holds onto him, the weight of all this loss around them.
Sam closes his eyes and takes a shaky breath. He can’t bear it, any of it. He knows he has to, but for a moment, he feels all of it. The despair. The exhaustion. The grief. He just wants to give up. They have no allies anymore, no family other than the three of them. They’re standing alone against God, and they’re all broken. It feels like they’ve already lost.
Cas nudges him, then pushes up Dean’s hand on his to lace their fingers together. “Time is something there’s plenty of here.”
knowing. Dean licks his lips and looks away, grinning sheepishly. “So,” Bobby adds. “Finally free to do whatever you want. Got any plans?”
And Cas continues to hold him, still gently swaying with him even though the music has long since stopped. “I’m so sorry,” he murmurs, stroking Dean’s hair.
Bobby shrugs and takes a sip of his beer. “Around, probably. He’s been talking about you a lot.” There’s that smile again. So it
Of course nothing happens, you knew that, you knew he couldn’t hear you. He’s gone. For a moment, you imagine what it might be like. To hear that ringing in your ears, softly first, then louder and louder, painfully so, just like when he was first trying to speak to you. You imagine the sound of wings, the way he takes a breath before he says your name. You imagine the wall beneath your fingertips becoming warm, the Empty itself growing soft over your pathetic pleas, opening up the portal again to take mercy on you and swallow you, too.
He leans back, finally ready to look Cas in the eyes again. Cas is crying, too, so Dean brushes his tears away with his thumb, just like he wished he did last time. Then, he was frozen in place by fear. Now, he’s cupping Cas’s face. He’s still afraid, a little. But he’s also so in love.
They don’t talk for a very long time. And something unravels in Dean now, dancing cheek to cheek with his angel. Something inside of Dean moves, and it’s making his heart race in panic at first, because this moving thing feels like whatever has kept him together in one piece for all this time – what if he just falls apart now?
You imagine it all so much that you can almost feel it. The ringing, the warmth. As if a reality where all this was possible were just a few inches away.
“Me, too,” Dean replies, even though he isn’t sure what Cas is sorry for. Dean is sorry for this, for not letting himself have this sooner.
Even now, you don’t have the words. Maybe it’s your fault after all, maybe he was right in never letting you speak, because he refused to let you start what he knew you couldn’t finish.
There’s a warm beam of afternoon sunlight falling through the window, bathing half of Cas’s face in gold. And suddenly Dean has an answer to Bobby’s question from before, that already seems so long ago. Finally free to do whatever he wants to do, he knows exactly what he wants.
You have only the words he left you with. That’s what you decide to hold onto. If you didn’t, you wouldn’t be able to go on. You know he can’t hear you, but you pretend. You know you’re not what he said you are, but you’ll try.
Another wave of sobs rolls through Dean, his body shaking against Sam’s. All Sam can do is hold onto him, keeping this shapeless, strengthless mass in some form that still resembles his brother. This, Sam decides, this is what he can work with. What will make him pull through. To be there for Dean, who just lost his love.
Strange to think now that what held him together for all those years – the jokes, the repression, the alcohol, and the brooding silence – didn’t only lock up the bad feelings, but the good ones, too. That he never realized it before. How big his love suddenly feels now that it’s free to go anywhere inside him. How it fills him up. How it spills out of his mouth. “I love you,” he whispers, then again, loud and clear, “I love you, Cas. I love you.” He overflows with it, presses it into Cas’s lips with his own, into his temple, his cheeks, his jaw, his chin, then his lips again, over and over until he can’t breathe. Until he realizes that he doesn’t have to breathe anymore, this is heaven, he’s free. He’s free.
It hits him bit by bit. The grief, for a life he never had, all the lives he could have made for himself, all the missed opportunities. He grieves himself. All the versions of himself he couldn’t save. There’s some guilt in there, too, but that passes, and then there’s anger, because why was he the one responsible for his own saving, why couldn’t anybody ever do that for him? Then, there’s the realization. They did. Others did save him, whenever he let them. Sometimes even against his own self-destructing will. Sam. Bobby. Charlie. Donna and Jody, the kids. And Cas. Over and over again.
It’s not actually a plan. Dean hasn’t given himself time to think about what he wants to say or do. He didn’t expect to see Cas again so soon, he was thinking he’d get to plan a big rescue mission from the Empty first. He didn’t expect to die so soon either, so he’s had to do a lot of restructuring and re-thinking plans. Maybe just this time, he could try to make it work without a plan.
“Is he gone?” Sam asks. He tries so hard to keep his voice steady, but he can’t. He can’t stop thinking about every single person in front of him turning to dust just hours ago, or the static on the radio on the way home, while they were frantically trying to reach anyone they know, or the look on Charlie’s face before she vanished. They’re all gone. Sam won’t let himself think about Eileen, not yet, because if he does, he’s gonna fall apart, and then none of them have a chance.
Sam might not have anything to offer that can fix it, but he has to try. He wants to try now. Make God pay. Find the puzzle piece that makes it all fall into place, save the world. Bring them back. He’s gonna bring them all back, he has to. He has to believe that they can.
. Dean instinctively knows that sometimes, this place will give you just what you need or want. And yeah, this, he can do. This, he wants to do.
Finally, Cas lets Dean pull him closer and puts a hand on Dean’s waist, and Dean puts his free hand on Cas’s back, warm and firm between his shoulder blades.
Dean falls asleep not much later, cried out and weak. Sam carefully takes off Deans shoes, puts a blanket over him, then takes off his own shoes and lays on his back next to Dean. He needs to be here with his brother. Dean needs him here.
Dean laughs, unsure what to say. Somewhere between ‘Good to see you, too, man’ and ‘I know,’ he settles for, “It wasn’t my plan, but now that I’m here…” And he pulls Cas into a hug.
Dean’s voice is hoarse, like he can barely get the word out. His eyes are dry, but he sounds like he’s been crying for hours. Sam holds onto him tightly, trying to help him up, but Dean won’t move. Trying to see if Dean is hurt, but there’s not a scratch. Just that broken expression on his face.
“We’ve both hurt each other. Don’t put this all on yourself. I only brought it up because I think it would be good for us. I trust Linda.”
“I believe you hurt the simpleton’s feelings when you implied that the time you spent with him didn’t matter to you in the grand scheme of things. Of course, the idiot didn’t bother to explain himself.”
“Cassie, there’s something you should know about our previous guests. They’re from another universe and so are you. In fact, you actually already had a crush on Dean, and boy, does it show,” he says, chuckling to himself.
Old Dean would have shrugged him off already. New Dean is man enough to admit he’s touch starved and perfectly happy to stay in Cas’s arms for as long as the angel wants to hold him.
Cas turns pale with an expression that says he left the stove on and now the house is on fire. It goes away quickly, and he hums noncommittally as he suspiciously moves away from him. There’s something there, and Cas is the definition of the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. He’s not going to let this go, especially if Charlie’s involved somehow.
When he’d disappeared from the crowd, he felt a strange compulsion to seek him out. After chatting with the bartender, he’d discovered that Lucy had invited two men upstairs. His heart jumped, more often than not, that meant Lucifer was trying to set him up with someone he found suitable. For some odd reason, he felt butterflies in his stomach when he discovered the guy he had his eye on was someone the devil approved of. He had a sneaking suspicion that life before Lucifer had been hard and that his angel family rarely approved of anything he did.
Castiel can’t think of a better reason. If his other self was as terrible as his scant memories seem to confirm, he can’t conceive of a reality where that gorgeous green eyed man could possibly want him back. Dean must have simply lost his nerve when he realized he didn’t remember anything he did. Why else would he be so angry that Castiel didn’t recognize him? Not that he blames him for feeling cheated, there is no real point taking revenge on a blank slate after all.
Castiel reveals his dark shimmering wings and disappears with a whoosh, and Lucifer decides he is not drunk enough for the day he's had. When Amenadiel finds a black feather in the morning and asks if Cassie has stopped by, he can honestly answer yes as long as his brother doesn't pry further. Thankfully, he doesn't. The Detective would call it a lie by omission, but he doesn't believe in those. Besides, he would let Amenadiel in on their little brother’s interdimensional love life once Castiel reunites with his Righteous Man, and he gets all the juicy details. Something tells him that his brother’s next visit won't take nearly as long as the last.
“You’re seeing a therapist Lucifer recommended? Are you insane? She’s probably passing on everything you say to him! And in case you haven’t noticed, Lucifer is an unrepentant son of a bitch!”
Castiel was right to come here. His older brother is truly wise. Despite this, Lucifer seems alarmed by his conclusion, desperately grabbing hold of his arm.
“Dean, I know you. As soon as I say yes, you’ll text Sam, and by the time we get back, the wedding will already be planned.”
Cas removes himself from Dean’s presence, clearly displeased as he throws him an exasperated look, the rare my boyfriend is an idiot one that almost never comes up because his angel is under the mistaken impression that he’s the world’s most precious gift to mankind.
He’s annoyed, but the feeling is muffled by the sudden intense heartache. The angel who always believed in him doesn’t think he’ll follow through when it matters.
“Luckily, their mannerisms are completely different. You should be able to tell them apart easily, especially after their last battle.”
“You misunderstand the situation, Dean. As much as he disapproves, Lucifer is aware of how much I care about you. So, my brother is very indirect and subtle in his criticisms. He is less subtle about the fact that he thinks I can do better,” he says, obviously annoyed by Lucifer’s meddling.
If he can’t bring his angel home, he might as well drink up. It’s a poor consolation prize but better than leaving completely empty handed. Sam shakes his head and grimaces, but dutifully, plays designated driver for the night and watches over him. He doesn’t expect the angel to return to the club in the middle of his drinking binge.
Cas vehemently shakes his head, putting a hand on his knee as a small show of comfort that won’t make Dean back away.
“You gotta stop saying things like that. I’m this close to bawling like a baby, and I haven’t even heard any of the crap Lucifer is saying about me yet.”
“So, don’t look so down about being second best. You’re family. It doesn’t matter how many times you fuck up. I'll always want you by my side.”
“I wouldn’t worry too much. I’m sure you’ll like Linda,” Cas says giving Dean another reassuring squeeze.
“Shut up, I know it’s stupid. I’m working on being less of a jealous angry asshole, okay? I know I don’t deserve you, but-” The angel cuts him off, completely exasperated.
The man had been flirting, right? Then again, he hadn’t actually answered most of his questions. Maybe, he’d come on too strong, or Dean had realized that he had too much baggage for a one night stand. He hated himself for messing everything up. The feeling triggered something inside him, an echo of an unpleasant memory that he couldn’t begin to place.
That gets Michael’s attention. He gets close and personal, pressing his blade against Dean’s cheek, taking perverse pleasure when he steps back to avoid being cornered.
Uh, Dean’s not really sure how he’s supposed to salvage this. Wasn’t the guy trying to turn his reputation around? You’d think he’d be happy that he comes across as the good twin.
Lucifer looks just as thrown as he feels. He raises his hands up in surrender, especially when Sam gives him a disapproving look.
And yeah, that’s probably something they should be asking, even if Dean’s already figured as much. He’s just not a hundred percent sure it’s due to brainwashing yet.
The mention of Superman is enough for him to look up. And yeah, the giant beefcake next to the devil definitely looks like a Clark Kent type. In less dire circumstances, he’d introduce himself, even if the guy gives off total wet blanket vibes. Dean’s always been charming and has a knack for getting people like that to loosen up a little, just look at Cas. It takes all his will power not to fix his eyes on the angel again. He’s not sure he’d be able to look away this time. Instead, he narrows his eyes at the carefree devil enjoying the show, all tempting smiles and expensive drinks.
Sam’s guard if possible drops even lower at the sincere apology, and Dean definitely wants to get out of here as fast as possible. Unfortunately, their one Cas short of being able to take off.
“That’s actually a lunch fork. A dinner fork is a fair bit larger,” Aziraphale says, coming up from behind Crowley.
Castiel expects him to say no. The man doesn’t owe him answers, not after everything he’s done. The angel can live with not knowing if it will spare this man pain.
“Sorry,” he mumbles to the sleek black tiles below him before finally daring to meet the devil’s eyes.
Cas obviously doesn’t mean to be cruel, but the words still hurt. He starts tearing up, because maybe, he doesn’t mean as much to the angel as he thought.
“Oh, okay. If I’m still your second favorite, does that mean I’m forgiven? I still don’t know exactly what I did, but I’m sorry, Dean. I can’t speak for the person I was, but I would never intentionally hurt you.”
“Yeah, I know, and of course, I forgive you, dummy. Everything you’ve ever done since you met me has always been for me. I couldn’t hate you if I tried.”
“I wasn’t stalling. You’re a Winchester. Trouble finds you. Best you’re not caught off guard because I neglected to share a vital piece of information,” he says like he hadn’t been super vague about the whole thing.
Like all Michaels he’s stupidly sure of himself and somehow intimidating without ever having to try. He takes note of the guy’s hunched shoulders, probably an old injury he can take advantage of if things escalate. Cas derails his battle couple fantasies and presses him as close to his body as physically possible. His eyes glow blue with grace as his hidden wings fan out.
He throws his angel into Lucifer’s prized liquor collection like it's nothing. More than half the bottles break and the alcoholic in him mourns their loss. The rest of him bolts upright and goes to Cas.
It should, but instead, he starts wondering if his angel had slipped away from him at some point and had a hot girl summer with this Diana chick, not like it would be the first time.
No, it’s his rotten luck that Castiel’s current role model is Lucifer. That’s bound to end super well. He’s not salty or anything.
“Anything you wish,” Cas says. And it sounds suspiciously close to a Princess Bride’s reference. He curses Metatron again for making him fluent in Dean’s language of choice.
He tries to withdraw, half remembering the man is big on personal space, and he’s held onto him longer than what is probably appropriate. Dean grips his arm and keeps him in place.
Cas is speechless, and it’s so satisfying. They don’t really talk about his life before he showed up and yanked him out of Hell, but he’s sure, stick up his butt, OG Cas would have freaked if he’d seen his collection of opioids, and current Cas is reeling now that Dean has all but admitted grace is kind of addictive. Lucifer is unphased and immediately tries to spin the conversation in his favor.
He assumes this will be a simple question to answer that might clarify a few other aspects of their relationship he’s unsure of, but Dean blows up as if he’s asked him about the size of his genitals in public.
“I only recently reconnected with Lucifer after your untimely demise. I visit when you are busy with your other loved ones, and I have nothing to attend to. The last time I did so was when you forbade me from going with you when you finally went to visit your father," he explains.
He didn’t used to believe it, but he knows somewhere deep down that he is not worthy of the kindness that Lucifer has bestowed on him. He’s done terrible things. He just can’t remember them right now. Every time he tries, there is a void so vast he can never cross it.
Dean hates how dread builds up in the pit of his stomach. Is it really too much to ask to be free of bitter in-laws when traveling the multiverse? He’d been hoping for a do over with angels that weren’t dicks out to raze the planet.
That immediately gets Dean to refocus. He grabs Cas’s arm and stops him from pulling out his phone while simultaneously invading his angel’s personal space. His eyes widen in surprise, and Dean grins.
Dean rubs his neck, more than a little self conscious. He’s completely out of his element here. Even with Lisa, he hadn’t really had the inlaw experience, because Lisa, bless her soul, realized he wasn’t ready for that. Part of him is sorry he couldn’t fit into the picture perfect Apple Pie life she’d offered him but most of him has greedily latched onto Cas and will fight anyone who so much as looks at him wrong.
Cas sighs again, but he feels the building tension ease. He wants to believe him. Dean’s sure of it.
“One day, receiving my unconditional love will be so natural that you’ll simply accept it, and you won’t cry a river because love will be a constant in your life and not something held back, only said in one’s final hour. ”
“Oh Cassie, always so blunt. I’ve missed you,” Amenadiel says, giving him a quick embrace that his angel eagerly returns.
Tcht, like that proves anything, Jack turned out amazing in spite of Dean. Sam was doing all the heavy lifting before Cas miraculously returned to them.
Cas hesitates, aware that Dean fears being replaced. He has a feeling he knows exactly what the angel's about to tell him. He braces himself, expecting Castiel's version of events to hurt him him just as much as Jack's if not more.
“You’ve invited if the wedding ends up happening,” Cas says as he once again carries Dean bridal style out the door because this is their new normal apparently.
What he wouldn’t give for an archangel blade to appear in his hands so he can tear this holier than thou jerk a new one.
“I’ve known him for over a decade. Dean never gets any easier to predict. It’s impossible to tell what’s going through his head unless he blurts it out.”
“Not all of it, no, Michael’s sudden appearance has recently forced me to come back and set things right. You’re lucky I was even here to get punched in the face.”
If possible, Cas gets even closer, and Dean feels even warmer than before. His angel squeezes him so tightly that he finds it hard to breathe for a second, but his tiny gasp alerts Cas that he’s over doing it, and he eases up, still holding him protectively against his chest.
Lucifer proves the old adage true and pops up behind them at the mention of his name. He idly wonders if Dean accidentally prayed to him, regardless of his original intent.
Cas frowns, sensing that an overwhelming majority of their friends and acquaintances had assumed the same thing about them.
“I’m trying to be better about it,” Cas says, echoing Dean’s words as he cautiously returns the hug. He really wishes he wasn’t his angel’s primary role model for how to be human.
Crowley never looks away from Dean which is kind of funny because he puts enough effort into being human that he makes a show of holding up a menu. There's a part of him that wants to edge him on when the server addresses him.
Lucifer laughs good naturedly, more than used to being blamed for things that were definitely not his fault. In this case, he’ll go easy on the guy.
“So, what’s special about you? Lucifer’s been trying to set me up for ages. Can you see my true form? Are you especially pious? What do you think about the plight of bees?”
Honestly, his angel didn't start out picky. He could have put an apple and a can of spam in front of him, and Cas would have loved it, simply because he had nothing to compare it too. Dean didn't want to do him dirty like that and introduced him all his favorite foods before . . . well, he didn't like to think about what Cas ate when he was homeless.
“I swear this is the first time he’s actually been interested. Normally, he’s like a deer in the headlights and ducks out before the fun starts, and I have to send the unlucky guy or girl home, or he just ends up staying up all night helping the poor boy or girl have an emotional breakthrough.”
“So, we ever gonna visit your third secret family? With the nice Devil and the Angel Baby Daddy? Or was that just pillow talk? ”
Slow your roll Dean, you’re getting sidetracked. The angel isn’t leaving you, even though he should. For some reason, you’re it for him.
Lucifer laughs in spite of himself. Well, if this isn’t the cherry on top of his miserable day, he supposed he had that coming for projecting his own issues onto Castiel’s relationship in the first place. He’s wearing the same tan trench coat, but it's wrinkled and well worn. Hell, even the suit is the same, Lucifer’s first instinct is to offer him a better suit from his extended collection so he’ll at least have options, but the open fury on Castiel’s face makes him think better of it.
“So, what you’re saying is you need a couple of Xanax before the ceremony, let me give Linda a call and see if she can’t hook you up.”
“Dad’s idea of a joke I assume. Because he chooses to be vulnerable around you, he’s practically mortal in your presence. At least, while you’re here, different universe, different rules.”
“Dean’s not a baby. Maybe, he can’t make someone explode with a snap of his fingers or say what he means, but he tries, dammit,” he shouts, eyes overflowing with cosmic energy.
“T-Thanks, I’ve made a lot of mistakes, but I love Cas more than anything. I want to be better,” he says, keeping his eyes on Charlie who babbles at him encouragingly.
Huh, some things never change, do they? Dean laughs, assuming it’s not a world ending thing there. Cas doesn’t seem overly worried at least.
The ride takes less than thirty seconds but feels like an eternity. He wishes he’d thought to fly out the balcony. Then again, he doesn’t want to encourage the rumors that he’s a real angel and blow his cover. Rainbow wings don’t exactly blend into the background. The club is unbearably crowded. He didn’t used to mind, but the hundreds of dancing bodies are in his way, and he needs to see Dean more than he needs the grace thrumming through his veins.
Cas rolls his eyes, not at all worried about the Empty anymore. He knows he is loved. There is little the Empty can do to hurt him anymore.
His face is unreadable, but his lifeless looking wings dragging on the ground carelessly tell him everything.
It takes all of Cas’s willpower to keep his wings from spontaneously bursting forth in front of all the bar’s patrons at the affirmation that Dean always wanted him back. The problem is he’s too stubborn to admit it on his own. So, he takes a page from the devil’s book and watches the chaos unfold in front of him. After all, he has plausible deniability.
“I was less aware of the subtleties of language at the time and thought he was trying to insult me. So I turned back and said ‘What do you want, human? He never tried to use it again.”
Cas sounds annoyed, but in a fond way. Dean hates it. Hates that he’s spent months with the guy. Hates that the demon likes classic cars and Queen, and that they’d probably be friends if his name wasn’t freaking Crowley. Hates that some part of him still thinks they’d be a better match than what he and Cas have going on because Crowley hasn’t ever thrown him out on the street with no money or IDs. Crowley’s never had the chance to say the awful things that Dean has said. Crowley can’t ever die and invalidate the stupid sacrifices Cas made for him.
It reminds him of the looks Lisa would give him when he made Ben laugh or went above and beyond the call of duty helping him with his homework. Dean’s always been nurturing, and he’s sure that was one of the big pluses that kept Lisa from dumping his emotionally distant ass at the time. His mind wanders to his competition. He doubts the devil is the nurturing type, but it wouldn’t hurt to check. If nothing else, he’s securing their place as the go to fun uncles before their little visit is over.
Cas is torn as if Dean is a fragile little human who needs him to sugar coat things. He hates that he’s given him every reason to believe that. Before he makes up his mind on what to say, they get an unwanted visitor.
He blushes and willingly initiates the hand holding. Okay, maybe, he doesn’t mind starring in a romantic comedy.
He must have gotten better at witty banter since they first met because Dean looks mildly shocked before he grumpily pushes him away.
“Take it from someone who knows, sometimes you just have to say what you mean and let the chips fall where they may. Your angels is far too literal to read between the lines otherwise.”
The devil sounds exasperated, but Dean feels the tightness in his chest lessen. That sounds a lot more like the Cas he knew. Maybe, he’s still in there somewhere.
He comes off way more accusatory than he intended, but this is definitely the other shoe dropping. The reason this classy devil has his angel acting distant.
A strange devilish aura surrounds Cas then as he smiles wickedly at Crowley, but it disappears when he turns back to Dean, the picture of innocence.
“Dude, seriously, everything? Crowley gave me stink eye for a week just because he suspected I jacked up royally. Which you know, fair, but the devil isn’t exactly the forgive and forget type.”
He’s so awestruck by the devil’s classy digs that he almost misses Cas’s tucking his wings back into a different plane of existence. It’s only three seconds but the ethereal prismatic beauty of Cas’s wings make him go gaga all over again. He laments not being able to bury his hands into his angel’s soft feathers, but he takes comfort in the fact that Cas’s wings are still faintly visible to him.
Aziraphale successfully turns the customer away with the excuse that he’s currently dealing with a family emergency which is a bit of an exaggeration, but Castiel still nods gravely and looks down. The man leaves in a huff and threatens to return in a week’s time. He’s clearly familiar with Aziraphale’s avoidance tactics and looks undaunted by the delay. Crowley helpfully fills him in, telling him that Mr.Poe is the angel’s best customer which naturally makes him Aziraphale’s least favorite person.
Dean laughs which if he thinks about it was probably the angel's goal. Cas's question seems to have killed Aziraphale a little inside.
“I originally planned to stay no more than a few hours which would have added up to minutes in our world. You were never supposed to miss me,” Cas explains, eyes fixed on their entwined hands.
Dean shakes his head. For once, he’s going to say what he means and clear the air, even if he’s terrified. He was in charge of his life for all of two minutes before keeling over last time so admitting that a big old traditional wedding scares the bejeezus out of him shouldn’t be that big a deal. Cas will understand. He always does, and the devil . . . well, they only have to tolerate each other a few days a year. If he’s polite, maybe, he can’t get through this without the whole thing turning into a fist fight.
“Who says I’m not?” Dean says playfully, not sure what she expected. He’s not going to paw at Cas when he’s busy visiting his nephew.
He nods sagely before Lucifer can get into a panicked spiel about how he would never disrespect Sam’s boundaries after his trauma with the last devil he encountered. He’s not about to let his brother ruin the mood anymore than he already has. Cas takes Dean’s hand and drags him out of the bar to make new memories that hopefully won’t require an English degree to decipher should he ever lose them again.
“No, I’m afraid not. I thought it would be unwise to introduce you two at this juncture. I know you are not fond of Dean,” Cas says bracing himself for Lucifer’s response.
This time, his angel senses something isn’t quite right and looks at Dean for clarification. He claps Cas on the shoulder to let him know he has everything under control.
“I told you his brain was scrambled so I unscrambled it. Salvaged the important bits and wiped the rest clean. Voila, good as new,” Lucifer says right in front of Cas who barely blinks in acknowledgement as if this is old news to him, like he doesn’t care.
Thankfully, his stupidly patient, understanding angel gets it.  He nods, wrapping one of his translucent wings around him protectively.
“Thank you so much for your help Lucifer. I will not forget this,” he promises, leaving in a flash of blinding light.
“I was kidding. What is it about these puny humans that triggers the Cain instinct in you and Lucy hmm? Personally, I don’t see the appeal.”
“If that ends up being the case, I’ll respect your wishes Dean, but please, give Linda a chance,” Cas says, ever the supportive boyfriend.
Dean would prefer not to make an ass of himself this time, and he’s not super confident he can pull it off as he is now. His emotions have been all over the place lately like the bottle containing all his stupid feelings has finally popped open, and its too late to put the cap back on. Sam would say his sudden emotional vulnerability is a good thing, a sign that he is healing.
He rolls his eyes, kind of over being called out like a misbehaving dog every time he does something the angel doesn’t like.
Dean could, but he doesn’t want them to break up for the upteenth time over something stupid. In fact, it hadn’t even occurred to him at the time that his actions might be taken that way. He was just so damn thankful he’d gotten Cas back.
“Not gonna happen,” he says, grabbing the angel by the shoulder. He’s surprised when he manages to restrain him. Cas might as well be human.
Dean sits up abruptly, nearly falling off his chair as he scrambles to face him. His eyes are puffy, and the man is still a little misty eyed, but Cas can’t help the warmth that fills him at the spark of hope in his eyes. He must want this too.
The dude has a point. There is no puppet master pulling their strings. No terrifying darkness compelling him to give in to his worst desires. No mirror of himself he can succumb to in order to be daddy’s perfect blunt instrument, and the monster at the end of the book has been vanquished for good. In fact, no one can ruin his own happiness except himself. The idea should be freeing but . . .
Linda takes over after that, ready to go on a rant. Apparently, it doesn’t matter what universe they’re in. Lucifer will always be annoying, and Dean finds that really comforting for reasons he rather not examine right now.
“I know. I wasn’t going to suggest that. Believe me, Crowley has pointed out every conceivable flaw in every one of my proposed solutions for the dilemma we find ourselves in.”
Lucifer smirks, taking the opportunity to finally get some alcohol in his system. If he had his way, he would be good and smashed already.
“Honestly, you two are just as bad as Aziraphale and Crowley,” Lucifer says, finally allowing the elevator to close.
“I’m sorry, Aziraphale. I did come here because of Dean. He’s being difficult, and I find this world very comforting. I like you two,” he admits shyly.
When they return, the place is spotless, and the alcohol’s been replaced like nothing ever happened. The benefits of being rich if he had to guess. The devil is on the piano playing some haunting melody of his own creation that hits him deep. He stops abruptly when he notices them, far too relieved to see them safe and sound. It’s strange to see the devil worried, to think of him as something other than an obstacle to overcome.
Dean decides this isn’t a battle worth fighting. An angel grace engagement ring is admittedly awesome, and he’s going to be a greedy bastard and accept it.
Strange, he knows it's not his first, but he’s sure that it didn’t compare to what he’s experiencing now. It is short but passionate and more than a little possessive. Sure, the man still reeks of alcohol, but he can’t find it in himself to care. Everything about the kiss is so very Dean, and this Righteous Man is all he ever wanted even before he was capable of wanting.
“That’s all anyone can ask for. Lucy will take some time to come around, but you have my blessing,” Amenadiel says with such sincerity he wonders how anyone ever mistook him for a regular old human.
“Here, consider it a show of good faith. I really did just come to say hello and warn you two to get out of dodge before all Hell breaks loose, figuratively speaking. I’ll give you till tomorrow evening to finish your business here,” he says, not at all concerned that he just handed Dean a weapon that could easily kill him.
“I’m fine, green eyes. If I don’t remember by now, those memories couldn’t have been that important to me,” he reasons.
Cas nods, deep in though for several minutes, longer than what most people would be comfortable with. He waits, knowing the angel will snap out of it when he’s good and ready. Eventually, Cas takes hold of his hands and pulls him even closer. Dean gulps, distracted by the proximity of his boyfriend’s lips. How did he ever manage to keep it together during the apocalypse when the embodiment of lightning constantly stared at him like that? Well, he has no reason to hold back now.
Cas smiles as he looks into Crowley’s gorgeous reptilian eyes, familiar enough with the subtle signals Dean tended to use to know the significance of the gesture. He decides then and there to spend a few weeks with his brother and life partner before returning home. It’s been a while since he’s spent more than a few hours with them, not since . . . Jack.
“I love Cas, but a big wedding just isn’t me. I’d end up taking off faster than Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride.”
Cas sighs and finally puts the book down and joins him on the loveseat. Dean freezes up when he takes his hand, and he can’t help but glance at the other angel in the room. His eyes haven’t left the book he’s reading, but he’s smiling knowingly. Dean feels some of the tension in his muscles leave him and turns to look at Cas. He looks guilty but unashamed. There’s something determined in his gaze, and Dean knows he’s gearing up for a fight.
The steel pressing against his opening makes Dean’s eyes widen in shock. This is the big one, the one-point-three pound plug that Cas got for their anniversary, the one they’ve only used a handful of times.
There’s a drawer opening, a snick from the cap of the lube bottle, and then two cold fingers are mercilessly pushing into Dean’s ass. He groans and pushes back, trying to adjust, but they pull out and return with more lube, twist and disappear again. When three fingers return with even more lube, Dean spreads his legs and whimpers. Cas finger fucks him by punching his fingers in, fist hard against Dean’s bruised and sore ass, and  fresh tears spring into his eyes.
“I can’t,” he says, wiping at his cheeks and rubbing his face before staring straight at Cas. “I can’t do this without you, Cas. I don’t want to.” He breathes. “Babe, I
When he comes back to himself, Cas is bent over him, fingers gentle on Dean’s forehead and Dean blinks wearily. He’s trembling and sweating, his mouth dry.
More sweat runs along Dean’s back. More hits fall. Dean groans and grunts and draws noisy breaths. He watches carefully as Dean’s shoulders gather back tension that’d he’d already let go. Dean’s eyes, when Cas kisses him again, are slightly glassy, and his lips are trembling. Cas’ fingers itch to run down Dean’s back, but he doesn’t. Instead, he goes back to the heavy flogger. Let’s it follow the red lines from the narrower whip, throws his arm back and follows the movement of the flogger to land punching hits. This time, when Dean goes up on his toes from the blows, Castiel doesn’t stop. He counts instead. One, two, three…
“I don’t think this is enough,” Cas mutters. “Where’s the lube? This hole really needs to be filled, it’s just begging for it.”
,” Castiel hisses, and Dean does it again, and again, and then Castiel is pushing him down, down, down and coming. Dean can’t breathe, but he just hangs there with his nose smashed into Castiel’s skin, content and breathless, because it’s okay, Castiel’s got him.
“I withheld information from you, Daddy, ‘n I shouldn’t, ‘cause you love me and worry about me,” Dean squeezes out between sobs. “I won’t do it again! I won’t, m’sorry!”
There’s some more chatter, but Dean doesn’t listen. He lets the smell of grass and dirt mix with Cas’s weight until it all consumes him. Cas really,
Another finger joins the first two and Cas crooks them slightly, searching before - Dean keens when Cas’ fingers hit his prostate, pleasure jolting through him. He pushes back hard, fucking himself wantonly on Cas fingers, wanting that feeling again, and again, and -
Cas kisses his neck, stroking his sides slowly, almost reverently. Then the cap of the lube bottle clicks open, and slick fingers slide slowly between his cheeks. It’s been so long, it’s been so very, very long, and Dean forces himself to go limp. When Cas finger breaches him, his breath stutters again. His skin prickles, like goosebumps rushing all over, as that finger gently and slowly prods in and out of him. Soon, it’s joined by another, and the stretching is delicious. He groans, spreading his thighs further apart and rocking back at them. Cas twists and scissors slowly. He’s not looking to drag it out, there’s no teasing in his movements, but he’s being careful, as though he’s expecting Dean to tell him off.
This is not a guide on how to set up a scene. I'd say this isn't a healthy way to handle your emotions, and the characters know that too, but heaven knows I've done it, so make of that what you will.
from behind the improvised gag. The handcuffs are solid and hard, keeping his hands behind his back.
Cas pulls back, looking searchingly at Dean. It’s been a while since they played, closer to a month probably, because something, something he can’t put a finger on, is going on. Even now, there’s not the usual eagerness in Dean’s eyes, but a darker, dangerous glint. Perhaps he should refuse, should avoid it, but he doesn’t, curious to see where this takes them. See, the thing is, he trusts Dean. He knows Dean. It’s been two years since that first kiss, that first, slightly awkward, stumble of slightly too much alcohol and a very handily placed wall. They’ve hashed out
One day, Dean decides that internet dating is a good idea. There might have been some alcohol involved, but that’s entirely beside the point. Sammy’s at Stanford, it’s goddamn November and the weather is miserable, so he signs up. He’ll blame the booze for skipping right past the regular websites, Tinder and Grindr and whatever the fuck - No. Go big or go home. He needs some lovin’, thanks so much, and there was that one time with the girl in a zorro mask, and then he’s on some website with a black background filling in shit like
Cas obviously doesn’t care, as he guides Dean down on the slick plug, conveniently spreading his legs over the corner. The plug presses relentlessly against Dean’s bladder and he whimpers and wriggles. His feet can’t reach the floor like this and all he can accomplish are small circles with his hips. That just makes it rub against his bladder and prostate, which hurts in dull throbs.
Cas stares at him for a moment, as if contemplating Dean’s worth and Dean shuffles closer, opens his mouth, tries begging with his eyes. Cas sighs.
Dean tilts his head back, sees Cas’s eyes narrow slightly, the observant bastard, and then the hand is squeezing gently, questioningly, and goddamn, Dean wants, wants this so bad.
“I’m just -” Cas starts and then he seems to hold his breath as Dean rolls away, getting out of bed. He flicks off the light and plods back to bed, where he falls down and buries his nose against Cas’ neck.
The closet opens and then items thump down on the bed. Dean doesn’t dare look, doesn’t move. Cas strokes a hand over his bottom and Dean holds his breath.
Dean’s mouth goes dry and he has to close his eyes for a second, but he shakes his head again and wiggles. Cas lifts up a little, and Dean turns over on his stomach, spreading his legs a little.
“No, I did not. I got home to find dirty clothes all over our floors, but I thought maybe you’d had a really bad day, maybe you needed to get them off real fast for some reason. So I came to find you, didn’t I?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean babbles. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again, I’m sorry, please, please, Daddy, please.”
Moments later, he’s inside, wrapped loosely in a blanket because it’s still July and hot, curled up in Cas’s lap, telling him everything.
Castiel comes around, kneeling. Dean shakes his head weakly, but Castiel’s patting his hip comfortingly as he reaches for the last books beneath Dean’s feet. Dean’s left on his toes, sinking another inch back, bent forward. He’s so helpless, but Castiel’s got him. Castiel always has him. Castiel walks around him again, prodding his entrance, where the dildo disappears into him, rubbing curiously, trailing fingers over Dean’s back and into his hair, which he pets for a long minute. Nimble fingers find the buckles and the gag falls to the floor beside them. Dean heaves for air, trying to work his jaw loose. It’s sore.
,” Cas says, slowly and clearly, “condone anything John Winchester did, apart from bringing you and your brother into this world. That man was a pathetic waste of space, and the damage he did… Dean, you brought the belt. Then you put yourself in the corner, for far longer than I would have, and you came out crying. Even after that, you begged for something more severe. I have clearly failed far harder than I thought, and I am so, so sorry.”
“Yes, it’s a safe space!” Dean rolls his eyes. “The fuck do you want from me? Are we going to sing kumbaya now?”
His tears have almost stopped by the time Cas comes back, slacks and shirt exchanged for soft pants and one of Dean’s t-shirts. As soon as Dean sees him, he reaches out with one trembling hand. It’s barely a twitch against the floor, but it makes Cas come crashing down next to him. Then he’s in Cas’s lap, face buried against his neck, and Cas is rubbing soft hands over his back.
Dean crawls. It’s slow, because his limbs feel like lead, but he crawls all the way up the stairs, carpet burning at his knees. He makes it to the foot of their bed and collapses there, shaking. The hand in his hair, dragging him up on the bed, makes him moan with gratitude.
Limbs flailing, he bolts from Cas’s lap, scrambles up the stairs as Cas follows, calling for him. He rushes into their bedroom, flings open the bathroom door and manages to toss half the contents of their bathroom cabinet on the floor before his hand closes around a small box.
Granted, Cas had caught him on the last one, face down, ass up, four fingers in his ass and hand flying on his cock. The bastard hadn’t even told Dean he was there, until after Dean had come. He’d made Dean tell him every detail, before mounting him and using his loose, oversensitive ass until Dean had cried and Cas had come, biting Dean’s neck.
He’s shaking so bad now, he can’t see through his tears, but obediently he presses the button again and groans in pain. By the time he’s wiped his eyes enough to see, all he sees is Cas with the palm of his hand pressed over his cock. It makes Dean sag in his seat, the fight nearly running out of him. Nearly.
He stays, covered in piss and come and with more come leaking out of him, as Cas uncaps the pen again. Something gets written on his ass, then the plug is shoved back in and Dean closes his eyes and floats.
The ropes get reattached into a hobble and cuffs as Cas leads him around the house, handing him tools. Eye bolts go in random locations. The cement floor in the garage; one of the ceiling beams in the living room and a hidden one in the floor beneath it; on the underside of a bench in the kitchen; the back of a leg on their bed and another on the headboard.
BEWARE: Tags have changed (humiliation tag added!) - if you want an explanation, go to the end notes.
Dean whimpers again and buries his head in his pillow. He’s on full display now, rutting into the sheets like an animal.
Cas presses kisses against Dean’s chest, when Dean remembers he has hands. That undershirt is so much in the way, he needs more of Cas’ skin, so he slides his hands back in below it (when did they end up fisted in the covers?). The feel of Cas’ back under his palms is hot and he needs more. He pulls Cas’ head up from where he’s been kissing Dean’s chest, and kisses him deeply, tugging at the undershirt.
“We do go through quite a few of these tubes,” Castiel muses, as though he isn’t coating his fingers with lube, filling the room with slick sounds, as though there isn’t a giant purple monstrosity about to go inside Dean. “I bought more earlier.”
“I’m perfectly capable of protecting my little brother, unlike some people. Now, if you excuse me, I have to figure out how to kill a cursed immortal man,” he says as the elevator doors start to close. Dean forces the doors open.
Dean winces picturing every instance where he’s failed their son. Cas really has no idea how badly he messed up with Jack. The kid was too much of a sweetheart to rat him out, especially after he did a one eighty and started treating him like their kid instead of Lucifer’s.
“You’re seeing a therapist? Seriously?” He can’t help but sound bitter. Dean finally thought he and Cas were in sync.
“A few hours? That’s unfortunate. We have an appointment with Linda today. I suppose we’ll have to reschedule.”
Before his angel can reply, wonder twin number two steps out of the elevator. Isn’t this just damn perfect?
Dean rolls his eyes. He may be a little out of it, but Cas is still ninety percent of his impulse control. He doesn’t think the therapy session will be a disaster if they go for it.
Dean flinches. He really hates that particular Jedi mind trick. Maybe, he can bring it up in therapy and get him to cut it out.
“Granted I wasn’t the first name he called, but I was the one who answered. Do you know how loud you have to be to be heard across dimensions?”
“Okay, you were right to reschedule the appointment. I don’t think it would be ethical to talk through your issues when he can’t hold back,” Linda says, silently psychoanalyzing him with a worried frown on her face. He’s too blissed out to feel self conscious about it.
The years have changed his little brother. He’s not the quiet disciplined little thing he was trained to be anymore, and part of him is proud of how freely he’s expressing himself and the other part is annoyed that his anger is being directed at him. It’s not even his Cassie. His little sister is currently somewhere in Hawaii wearing a tacky Hawaiian shirt with her equally dorky significant other drinking a Mai Tai.
Though to be fair, how could he have possibly predicted Lucifer 2.0 kidnapping Cas in the first place? In fact, why would the devil care enough to even arrange such a thing? He has to be plotting something, something big. Of course, Sam is giving him the look. He silently waits for his lil bro to open his big mouth and let it all out. Sam sighs, almost reluctant to say anything, but unfortunately for him, he soldiers through.
Castiel’s eyes widen a fraction as everything clicks. Perhaps, the issue is that they love each other in different ways. Since his memory is coming back to him in strange fragments, it will likely be a while before he can get a complete picture of what his life was like before Lucifer. He thinks it will be better to be frank and clear the air, even if he doesn’t like the answer he gets.
Dean’s eyes widen as he realizes how screwed he is. He can think of three things off the top of his head that would be more than enough for the devil to write him off as an abuser who needs to get gone yesterday.
“My, you really have been making rounds, Cassie. Never quite shook that fear of abandonment, huh? Smart to keep your options open if your future hubby here turns out to be right about not being worth the trouble.”
Cas scratches at the stubble on his cheek and is suddenly fascinated by the bunker’s wooden floor. He doesn’t miss the slight blush on his face.
Oh, he hadn’t even considered that. Maybe, he could mentor kids who had the unfortunate luck of being dragged into the hunter life, kind of like what Bobby did with him and Sammy.
“He asked me to,” Lucifer says as if he’s a good older brother that didn’t disintegrate Cas on sight last time they saw each other.
Next there’s a soft clinking sound and then Castiel’s fingers guide his head up. Dean lets his mouth fall open when he sees the gag, the ball fitting snuggly behind his teeth. Castiel fastens the straps around his head, and Dean closes his eyes for a minute to get used to the feeling. It’s always intense, the ball pushing into his mouth and forcing it open, the strap under his jaw, across his cheeks, over his nose and back. Castiel’s hands settle over his cheeks, fingers splayed wide, and he rubs Dean’s stretched lower lip with a thumb. Dean whines briefly, and then he’s falling off the edge, flying, staring up at Castiel and hoping that he can read his mind.
“Dean,” Cas warns. “I’m doing you a favour and letting you get off tonight. You promised you’d do it anyway I wanted. That spanking is still an option.”
He still tries to swallow, tongue trapped under the ball, when Castiel moves aside and there’s a giant fucking dark purple dildo attached to the bed frame. It’s thick, probably as thick as Dean’s wrist, standing straight up. It’s obscene. The tip is way higher than Dean’s hip and he glances at Castiel again. Castiel just smiles.
Dean shakes his head and now he’s terrified. Cas’s hands are on his thighs, pushing them wide apart, his thumbs digging into Dean’s muscles.
He yanks Dean up by his hair, and shoves him into a corner, where Dean crumples as Cas leaves the room. He stays there, curled up into fetal position, and cries. Huge wrecking sobs that he didn’t know he had the energy for tear through him. He’s worthless. He’s useless. He’s not good for anything. It’s as awful as it’s liberating.
When Dean’s nose touches the plaster, he feels like sagging in relief. This is safe. This is a net around him, holding him together. This is an old, soft sweater on a cold night. This is the world righting itself after an earthquake, when up becomes up again, and the ground stills beneath his soul.
“Do you think they’d be impressed by your cock?” Cas says, and the finger returns. “Or do you think they’d look at it and say
He looks ill, pale and face swollen from crying, one eye nearly glued shut where it’s gone purple. His head hurts. He looks at the ring again, then snaps the box shut, shoves it back behind the hairspray and turns the tap on. He washes his face quickly, ignores his sore ass, and downs some water and Advil.
It’s weird to be wearing panties in broad daylight, outside, watching the world go by. Nobody can see them, yet Dean feels so vulnerable, vaguely embarrassed. Cas’s hand is a comfort, tethering him to reality lest he float away entirely.
Cas cuts the rope tied to Dean’s balls, yanks the chair around and pushes his cock against Dean’s lips, tugging him forward until the rope collar digs into his neck. He starts out soft, but hardens fast against Dean’s tongue, thick and salty as he pushes inside him. Between Cas’s cock and the collar tied to the back of the chair, Dean is helpless and breathless as Cas pounds into him with absolutely no regard for Dean’s comfort. He’s taking his pleasure from Dean’s mouth, using him like a true cocksleeve, and Dean’s heart sings.
talk about this, Dean.” There wasn’t an inch of give in that voice, and Dean nodded jerkily to show he’d understood. Yes. They’d talk about it. They always did.
Dean climbs out, feeling for all the world like his legs are unsteady as he walks up the stairs to the door. The satin cups him, soft and silky yet firm.
Cas hums against his lips then spins him around. It’s been a week and the bruises are fading slowly, but Cas can’t seem to stop wanting to stroke and fondle them, or potentially he’s just that obsessed with Dean’s ass, which also seems likely. Right now, he’s petting the marks, spreading Dean’s cheeks, then pushing them together again. Hey, maybe Dean can convince him that rimming should be on the agenda for tonight. God knows Dean’s gotten rimmed within an inch of his life more than once this week.
“Listen!” Dean barks. “It don’t work like that. I’m a contractor, a builder, Cas. I report this to my boss, and it’s gonna be me outta job soon as he can let me go. I go to the police? He’s gonna fire me so quick. Easier to fire the cocksucker than to make fifty guys think it’s alright to take it up the ass. I know how the world’s supposed to work, I know what I oughtta do, but that ain’t gonna help now, is it?”
Cas is solid, all angles and hard muscle and hot skin. His cock stands slightly shorter, but fatter than Dean’s own, and Dean traces his fingertips over it. Someday, someday soon, he’ll tease and play but for now he just dips down. It’s been so long since he did this, he’s forgotten the heady smell of cock and precome, and there’s new notes, a smell that’s entirely
The cold smile on Cas’s face tells him it’s the right choice, then his balls are pulled away from his body and a heavy steel ring fitted around them, slotting a small plastic box snugly against his perineum. Dean pants, eyes wide. Cock hard. Stupid cock. Cas pets it with a single finger, but his eyebrow is mocking Dean, blood rushing to his face as he struggles not to hide.
Cas stands abruptly and Dean scrambles backwards. His legs are on fire as he straightens them, his knees chafed from the living room carpet and bruised from the kitchen.
. There’s a hand, one of those glorious big hands, palming over his cock over his boxers. Dean’s pretty sure he stops breathing for a second or two, before he keens.
The coffee’s good though. Hot, black, bitter enough to make his mouth feel almost dry after swallowing. He sips it slowly, leaning against a counter, watching when a man in a trench coat and an awful sweater rushes in, hair on end and a briefcase in one hand. He weaves through the tables and to the counter, catching the blonde’s eye. The blonde nudges the redhead and magically, a paper cup is ready at the end.
Cas hushes him, patiently pressing the plug inside until it’s a heavy, solid pressure on Dean’s insides.
“Today I want you to be good for me, Dean,” he says, stroking Dean’s cheekbones and jaw. “I want to do something to you, and I want you to let me without fighting me, just because it’ll make me very happy. Can you do that?”
The strap tears into him over and over again, hitting the same spot on the bottom of Dean’s ass over and over with the thick leather strap, while Dean writhes, screaming. Let’s himself feel it. Let’s himself react.
Cas’s cock shoving into him is an electric current waking him up, making him strain and keen. Cas holds onto his cuffed arms as he thrusts, short hard jabs that grind Dean’s oversensitive cock against the edge of the counter. Dean stares at the open window, their yard and patio. Piss and come make squelching sounds under his stomach, but he doesn’t care. Cas said he’d piss himself and love it, and Cas was right. He’s nothing. Cas using his body is all that matters, it’s what he was made for. Everything else is inconsequential.
Dean clears his throat, though his eyes burn. “When I break the rules, Daddy punishes me, because Daddy loves me.”
It touches the back of his throat and he swallows, listening to Cas breath hitch. Castiel fucks his mouth lazily, and Dean lets him, lets him have everything. He coasts, floating free on the burn in his shoulders, the brilliant pressure in his ass, the smell and taste of Castiel in his mouth. He’s surrounded, swallowed up, covered in everything that is Castiel, and he surrenders to it with all he has to give. His nose smears snot and saliva over Castiel’s skin, Castiel’s balls bump against his chin, wet and slippery. He tries to stretch his tongue out, urgently needing to be
When the fingers disappear, he regrets asking, if only for little while, listening to a condom packet being opened and the click of the lube cap and then Cas is pushing his legs together, kneeling over his hips, his thick cock sliding between. Cas pushes in slowly, gently rocking back and forth as he goes deeper, and that hot feeling crawls over Dean’s skin again when he feels the stretch. He wants to arch up, to fuck himself back on Cas, but he’s pinned below Cas’ hips and that probably shouldn’t feel as good as it does. He puts his forehead against his arms and whimpers loudly when Cas leans down and kisses his neck.
Snivelling, Dean crawls after him, sees Cas settled on the couch with his legs spread. Cas snaps his fingers and points at the empty space between his legs.
Dean yanks his arm back and scrambles for the stairs. Cas’s arm goes around his waist like an iron band, hauling him back. Dean’s pleading behind the gag, trying to wrench free and kick after Cas’s legs. He needs the damn bathroom! When Cas calmly drags him back towards the kitchen, Dean goes limp and lets himself noodle out of Cas’s grip, flopping to the floor. Cas sighs in irritation, bends down and wrestles grip around each of Dean ankles, turns him onto his stomach and unceremoniously hauls him right back into the kitchen. Dean screams behind his gag, angry and humiliated.
“Sir, please,” Dean whimpers, “I know you’re in charge, I swear, it was a mistake, I’ll pick the clothes up now, I swear!”
To say Dean’s hard now, would be an understatement. He’s hard like diamond, his boxers sticking uncomfortably against the tip of his cock where precome must have leaked onto the material.
No, no he would really rather not. It’s awful, terrible, the pleasure building and building until it drools out of him.
“No, listen.” Dean puts his fork down and fixes his husband with a stare. “I get what you’re saying, but you gotta realise, I’m not joking when I say I don’t want nice. I wanna be yours. Do you hear me?”
Cas presses just a little closer and Dean thrusts once, twice, and with a long groan he throws himself off the cliff and comes, and comes and floats away entirely.
Dean starts rolling over, then remembers he’s not supposed to shake the bed, so he shifts slowly, gently, until his back is against the bed and his tented boxers are fully on display. Cas hums gently, putting Dean’s pillow behind his head to prop himself up enough to see.
His tea mug goes flying, shattering on the floor, the hot liquid spraying Cas’s pants and soaking into his socks. Cas ignores it.
Cas yanks him from the wall and thrusts him away, making Dean trip over his ankle and crash to the kitchen floor. The tiles are unforgiving against his knees, his hip bangs against the cupboards as he slides back.
“No, I’m intrigued,” Cas says. “I want to know all about your filthy little mind. Why do you think you need to earn it?”
The next therapist is a mousy woman in a big cardigan. She insists on speaking to them separately first, but when it’s Dean’s turn, she tries to push pamphlets on domestic violence at him.
Dean’s face must show his confusion, because Cas reaches in, turns the tap off, then leans back against the cabinet opposite to the tub, crossing his feet at the ankles.
Dean closes his eyes tight, and rushes out, “You’re awake right now because I can’t control my needy little cock and am humping the bed.”
The fist closes back around his cock, and Dean jerks, pushes back onto the plug, but Cas strokes him soft and loose, barely enough to keep him hard even after his orgasm. It’s so intense, far too much. He screams when Cas rubs his palm across the head of his cock, kicking and twisting, tears and snot streaming down his face.
It’s as though he’s just waiting to break, wanting to shatter into a million tiny pieces so he can be put together again, cleansed and refreshed. He expects a tension to grow between them as they near the weekend, but there’s only this lump in his throat that grows bigger by the day.
the paddle connects with Dean’s left ass cheek, punching deep and hard and Dean screams straight out, fingers scrabbling at the duvet,
He coughs and gags, draws a desperate breath, and then he’s forced down again. Cas fucks his mouth, moves Dean’s head as though he’s a toy, and Dean fights to stay conscious, feeling the the tension gathering in Cas’s thighs. If he’s just good a little bit longer, Cas will come, he thinks deliriously, manages to gather another half-breath and drives himself as far down on Cas’s cock as he can. The weight at the back of his throat is delicious, too much and not enough, and he swallows around Cas repeatedly. Cas stiffens and then he’s coming, fingers pulling hard at Dean’s hair as he shudders through his release.
“Let’s do a couple on your thighs first, boy. Spread your knees.” Cas is leaning forward now, eyes intense as Dean spreads his knees and aims at the top of his thighs. “That’s right. Five on each side. Don’t wimp out now, look at how hard your cock is, you want to get that all the way down so that it remembers how useless it is.”
Cas nods miserably. “I fought so hard to get out of it, Dean. I can’t stand the idea of going back in.”
“What do you think you can give me, that I can’t take from you, boy?” he says, and goes right back to it.
He doesn’t speak during the second minute either, only pressing the button after glaring daggers at Cas.
The guy stands awkwardly for a moment while the high schoolers leave, and Dean tracks him silently. Then he turns and looks around the coffee shop, before spotting Dean.
“I was thinking you’d want to hurt me,” he says. “This one looks so small, but Daddy, it hurts so bad.”
“I could have hurt someone,” Dean says promptly. “I could have hit someone with my car, if I’d swerved, or not had time to react. Me driving was dangerous.”
Scratchy twine wraps around his balls, then Cas ties one string to each of his big toes, forcing Dean’s legs into an awkward bend where he can’t straighten them without tugging painfully on his balls. He tries taking a deep breath through his clogged nose, but looks up and chokes.
Working with the cage on is definitely a whole new world. The site they’re contracted to is going to become an office high-rise and there are dozens of dozens of other workers milling about. It’s busy, to say the least. Twice, Dean freaks out and thinks someone knows what’s going on in his pants. Twice, he has to run to the bathroom to discreetly check in the mirror. It doesn’t show. Going into the stalls to have a piss is strange.
Cas gets up and Dean follows silently, seeing the way Cas’s eyes are narrowed at Crowley’s back. Which is exactly the moment he remembers Cas’s jealousy. Uh. Oh. Oh, no.
It sure as fuck doesn’t, but Dean gets dressed, all the while hoping Cas isn’t going to make him walk into a store with a shock collar around his balls.
Dean’s on fire, he’s one giant nerve ending and he groans around the fingers in his mouth, sucking desperately on them before coating them in as much spit as he can. He’s shaking by the time he reaches back and presses them against his hole.
Sleeping next to Cas is surprisingly hard, because all Dean wants is to slide down on the floor. He misses his cage. He misses his bag. He misses chains tethering him to reality. It helps that Cas is octopusing all over him, holding him tight and sleeping more or less on top of him, sleep-heavy breaths against Dean’s collarbone. He still lays awake the majority of the night, eyes swollen from all the crying. He’s not done this much crying outside of their sessions in years, and Cas… Cas hardly ever cries. Dean can count the times on his right hand.
Eventually he sags into the floor and gives up. The tears continue to burn his eyes, which is so rude because he eyes are already swollen and sore. It’s not the first time he’s cried today even. His mouth is dry, the belt buckle is hard against the back of his neck and eventually he taps his forehead three times against the floor.
Dean presses the button, then folds over, whimpering, as a small shock of electricity sparks through his perineum, into his balls. Sonofabitch. It's the lowest setting, but that
Cas, however, loves seeing him in pain. The more he hurts, the harder Cas gets. The more he moans, grunts, screams, the more Cas wants to put his cock anywhere inside Dean. Snot and tears can get Cas hard in the blink of an eye, because if Dean’s crying, it means he’s suffering. Cas’s cock doesn’t care one whit if Dean’s hard or not. Cas confessed once that it’s even better when Dean isn’t, because that means he’s not gaining anything from the pain. His suffering is all for Cas’s pleasure.
This isn’t helping the hardon situation at all. Awkwardly, he manages to piss and put his pants back on, but it still shows.
about it. He could feel his legs trembling from how tense he was, knees locked and back ramrod straight, poised to fight.
“But, what if I hurt you for real?” he'd whispered into Dean's hair one night. “What if I'm too much?”
Going to the bathroom requires sitting down. Putting on the briefs that have magically reappeared in his drawer is interesting since the cage lifts his package slightly forward and it feels like the entire world will know.
The only thing he gets is a hand on his cock, which wants no part in the proceedings. It takes a long time for Cas to stroke him into hardness, even longer for him to get Dean rocking between the plug and his hand. Dean draws comfort from that hand, their only point of connection, and fucks himself desperately into hit, back on the plug, then into Cas’s hand again. He comes hard and slow, gasping for air and almost falling forward off the counter with the force. A hand on his shoulder stops him, even as Cas’s hand twists, wringing it out of him. It goes on forever, his balls hurting and legs cramping.
The cap of the lube snicks open and the tube makes an undignified farting noise that seems loud in the quiet room. Dean snorts.
He turns his head, watching as Castiel plucks some rope from the bed, tosses it over his shoulder and then moves two piles of books into place by the foot of the bed.
Which is how they end up here. The waiting room chair is uncomfortable in that way only waiting room chairs can be. Cas looks vaguely glum.
Cas drops down, gathers him close, murmuring praise as those clever fingers ghost over Dean’s cock. He brings it to life, making Dean gasp and arch from it. His weight pins Dean down onto the floor, Cas effectively sitting in his lap, and Dean struggles against him for a moment before Cas gathers his hands up again and forces them up above Dean’s head.
That cuts deep. Dean hangs his head in shame as Cas opens and closes kitchen drawers. He knows he can’t really win, but he could at least not disappoint Cas. He’s so fucking useless. He should have done the hot sauce, even though it scared the fuck out of him.
“Did that excite you?” Cas asks. “Your cock decided to try get hard. Do you think I can keep it down with just the shocker?”
“Why do you let me do this to you?” Cas asks, as he strips Dean of his jeans and palms the green-yellow bruises.
Dean blinks, but Cas’s gaze is firm, so he pulls his t-shirt over his head and kicks off his boxers and jeans, tossing them in a pile to the side.
Cas grabs the base of his cock and squeezes and Dean’s eyes fly open, nostrils flaring as he sucks in more air and tries to understand what’s going on. Cas grinds the heel of his hand into Dean’s bladder, and Dean tenses, thinking he’s going to piss himself even as his cock throbs with how close to coming he is.
“Oh uh, I came in a little while ago.” Cas shrugs awkwardly. “I was googling and I wanted to talk to you.”
“I think about you taking me for walks,” Dean gasps. “Hands cuffed behind my back and my cock in a tiny cage, and you’ve got this dainty chain and you’re leading me around by my cock where anyone could see.” He’s fucking into Cas’s hand now, “I think about you tattooing your name into my ass, or maybe burning it in, god that would hurt, it’d hurt for so long, but I’d be yours, I’m always yours, Cas, god, I can’t.”
Dean huffs. “I want cuddles,” he says, a slight blush on his cheeks, “but I gotta know you’re cuddling me cause you wanna.”
Dean’s standing before he knows it, fists clenched at his sides. Cas stands too, slowly, staring so intensely at Dean he doesn’t really know what he was about to say.
“You’re too hungry for cock to be a good cockwarmer,” Cas mutters. “Such a disgrace, can’t even do something so simple right.”
His hands work suddenly and he’s pulling Cas’ shirt out of his slacks to try to get more skin against his own, and then Cas growls again, but this time it’s a frustrated noise, and he’s shoving Dean up the stairs. Dean goes willingly, scrambling up the stairs, Cas right behind him. They kiss again on the landing, and Dean manages to untuck Cas’ shirt the rest of the way.
He hangs his head, and begs, sobbing. “Please punish me, Daddy. Please, please make it hurt, make it really hurt, I won’t do it again, Daddy, I swear.”
Dean swallows and feels Cas’s hand on his face. He has just enough time to draw half a breath before Cas clamps his fingers around Dean’s snotty nose. There’s no air, and he fights for it, pulling back even as Cas’s other hand fists into his hair. Cas’s thighs wrap around his head and there’s nowhere for him to go but further down the cock in his mouth. Tears well up in his eyes as his panic grows, but just as the room starts to fade, Cas lets him up again.
He doesn’t know how long it takes until Castiel crowds him from behind again, wrapping strong arms around Dean’s chest and holds him close. Castiel’s warm, so warm, and Dean sobs at the contact, pushing backwards, uncaring that he’s impaling himself further, he just wants more of that comfort and heat. Castiel is shushing him, rocking him gently, his erection pressing against Dean’s lower back. The tension goes out of the ropes that are holding him up.
“Nice,” Dean mutters, then tries to raise his voice a little. “You hurt me, yeah, but you don’t push me. You’ve been… the rules, you’ve let me push, but you didn’t push back as hard. I know I’m a brat, I know it’s exhausting to push me down all the time, and I’m sorry, you’ve no idea, but Cas--I’ve told you, I need this. I need you to. I can’t…”
“I didn’t think,” Dean says, voice cracking. “I’ve driven after a whiskey or two before, no biggie. It’s - it used to be who I was,” he manages a glance up at Cas.
The cool air against his hard on is a shock. He whimpers slightly as his cock straightens out, finally free of it’s confines, as he brings the soiled boxers into his hand and up towards his face. He stares pleadingly at Cas, but Cas doesn’t stop him as he turns the sticky wet spot out and puts it on his tongue. It’s bitter and salty. He must look like an idiot with the front of his boxers shoved into his mouth with a leaking cock laying against his stomach.
Cas grabs the cover from their bed and dumps it on the floor, before grabbing Dean by the shoulder and shoving him down, onto his knees. Dean goes gracelessly, tumbling down before managing to straighten up. He’s barely stable when Cas pinches his nipple and hauls him up by it.
. I wanted to give you everything, every little piece I had, so you wouldn’t go. It hurt, Cas. It hurt so bad.”
“Shhh,” Castiel says, his slick hand carding through the hair at the base of Dean’s cock, fingers smoothing over Dean’s balls. “Not yet, love. Relax.”
Dean loves him so much he doesn’t know what to do with all the feelings. When they got together… he’d no idea this dorky idiot with his sharp wit would become one of his favourite human beings. Granted,
Cas groans, but retreats to the couch where he does, indeed, seem to have built himself a nest from blankets and tissues.
The shock makes him grunt and tense, but Dean keeps his hands on his thighs, butt on his heels. The next one makes him whimper and shake. They’re still small, but Cas keeps them coming with regularity; one, two, three, zapp. One, two, three, zapp. It doesn’t take long before Dean’s sweating and shuddering, because there are sensations he never ever wanted by his balls and feeling like he got zapped by touching metal is definitely not on the list. Sweating just makes the shocks more intense, the prongs of the device digging into the skin of his perineum.
Fear curls in his stomach, goosebumps on his body, breath shallow. He can’t look up. This is what they do. If Dean breaks a rule, Cas punishes him. Cas has never refused to punish him before.
“My what now? Listen, buddy, I don’t know what information you have, but I don’t have any daddy issues.” He’s glaring at his therapist and he’d walk out, but Cas made him promise he’d sit through at least one session.
Dean chokes on some lettuce and takes a while to cough before managing to answer, “No! Jesus. I know you wouldn’t.”
Cas doesn’t even answer as he aims. The belt tears into Dean’s sit spots, crossing where the wood paddle must have bruised him, then moves down. He thrashes and kicks, screaming into his pillow. He’s fighting now, fighting to keep away from the belt, unable to stop the pain. Eventually, he runs out of steam, sobbing into his pillow.
The there’s a smack and he screams, whiting out entirely, hole clenching shut from where Cas has smacked it with the spoon. He comes back to his face mashed into the carpet, gasping sobs wrecking through all of him.
A slight pause, until he relaxed back onto his feet, then the blows came again and again and again, harder and harder, until he could barely get a breath between them. There was nothing about this that was predictable, the flogger raining down, each blow a like a punch to the gut, hard and determined. He stared ahead, gritting his teeth, the rage welling up inside him again. He’d do this. He could do this. His back was on fire, covered in embers, but he could do this. He would not break.
