Cas tried to hide his face behind the glasses and mess of hair.. “I, um… I’ve been having nightmares lately. About my family.”
“That’s a damn shame. He’s such a sweet kid, how could-” her voice broke, and Dean heard her take a deep breath. “Why did they kick him out?”
Cas let out a tense sigh, a puff of air escaping his lips and dissolving into the sky. “Look, I just wanted to apologize for being a dick earlier. I was mad, but it wasn’t your fault. I’m sorry for taking it out on you.”
“Alright, I’m sorry. I’ll go.” Dean reopened the window, climbing out onto the tree branch. He watched as Cas closed the window and shut the curtains.
Dean let out a soft sigh, dropping into the seat by his bed. “I, uh, brought you some comic books. Did anyone tell you how long you’ll be in here?”
Dean looked over at Cas, who was having his own sidebar with April. His eyes lingered worryingly on Cas, who looked, well, off. He couldn’t put a finger on any of it. “Oh, uh, that’s awesome.” He looked back to Lisa. “We can go whenever you’re ready.”
Dean’s vision became brimmed with red. He squeezed his fists at his side. “Your brother? Your brother did this to you?! Where is he? I’m gonna fucking kill him!”
Dean turned off the street and started to bike down a dirt path surrounded by trees. It wasn’t long before he stopped at an old cottage, obviously abandoned. Castiel got off the bike with a huge grin. “Woah, this place is awesome!” Dean leaned the bike against the wall and led Castiel up onto the porch.
Dean walked up the driveway, just a little unsteady. He laid in bed, staring at the ceiling and trying to understand the conversation he’d had with Lisa. Who did she think Dean had feelings for? As he drifted off to sleep, visions of a dance played in his head. Only this time, Cas was there, and they were dancing and laughing together. The last thing he remembered thinking about before he was out for good was that one kiss he’d given Cas.
The blush on Dean’s cheeks only darkened when Castiel ran his fingers along it. “You don’t not want, so you do want?” Dean sucked in a harsh breath, letting it out slowly.
“No,” Cas answered, looking down at him over his glasses. Cas had started wearing contacts a while ago, but every now and then he would bust out the old glasses. Now, Cas looked like an angry librarian scolding Dean for talking too loud.
Cas took the paper and stuck it in his front pocket. “Thank you for everything Mrs. Winchester,” he said as he stepped out of the car. “Goodnight, Dean.” “Night, Cas.”
When they got to the Winchester house, Dean knocked on Cas’ door. Cas had already been in bed, but Dean could tell from the glasses, lamp, and book face down on the bed that he hadn’t slept. Anna was hidden behind Dean, who couldn’t hide his grin as Cas rubbed at his eyes and yawned. “What are you smiling for?” Cas asked, looking at Dean with bleary eyes.
The cottage was waiting for them, like always. Cas dropped into his chair and pulled out the comic books Dean had let him borrow. Cas started talking about the books, which ones were his favorite, which ones he needed sequels to, the works. But try as he might, Dean couldn’t quite listen. He found himself analyzing every little thing about Cas.
Dean stood back and blinked the tears away as Cas’ family spoke to him, his mother and sister openly crying. “I’m so sorry,” his mother whispered over and over, pushing back his thick brown hair.
“I do,” Dean argued, getting off the bed. “You can tell me absolutely anything and I’ll never judge you for it.”
“You’re a very good friend, sweetheart, but you have school tomorrow. How about I pick you up when I’m done at work, we’ll go get Cas’ things, and you can go visit him after school.”
Dean swallowed thickly, making his way to the desk. Cas looked so small, sitting there. He looked like he was trying to shrink so small he’d disappear. Dean placed a curled finger under Cas’ chin, tilting his head up so their eyes would meet. Cas looked absolutely broken. “Dean, please, you-”
“It looks delicious, Mrs. Winchester,” Cas said. Dean couldn’t help but smile, as that was somehow exactly what he thought Cas would say. “Thank you, Cas,” his mother said with a smile. “But please. Call me Mary.”
Cleanup was tense too. Dean was on leftovers, and Cas was on dishes. Once they were alone in the kitchen, Dean spoke softly. “Cas?”
“Your parents seem tough,” Dean said softly. Castiel nodded. “Yeah, they’re good people. They’re just… sheep.” Dean furrowed his eyebrows. “How do you mean? “They blindly follow a religion, with no proof, no evidence. Their beliefs aren’t backed up by anything!”
sorry for the slow updates! i’ve only got one week of classes left so hopefully i’ll be able to write and post more then! thank you to every single person who reads this!
Cas looked down, his voice shaky. “No, Dean, it’s not okay. I don’t think you realize how good you are to me, and how much it hurts knowing I can’t have you.”
Dean felt Cas squeeze him tighter. “I know… but I still…” Cas wasn’t sobbing, but his breathing was rapid and inconsistent. Cas’ hands gripped the back of Dean’s shirt tightly. Dean opened his arms up and put his hands on Cas’ shoulders. “Hey, hey, look at me. C’mere, look at me,” Dean whispered.
Cas looked up at Dean and gave him a soft smile. “Sure, but first we gotta burn the tie and blazer.”
There was no way of telling how much time had passed before Cas let out a small yawn. Dean lifted his head to look at Castiel, a relaxed smile on his face. “You should get some sleep,” he recommended, giving Cas a soft pat on the back.
Dean sighed for at least the thirtieth time that morning. These summer days seemed to just drag and drag. The summers of the past had been different. His best friend Benny was in Lawrence, and they would ride their bikes, toss around a football, do anything. Anything was fun with Benny. But, of course, Benny just had to move to New Orleans. What he wouldn’t give for a fun summer day.
“You love me,” he repeated, stepping closer. He could see that Cas was afraid, which only affirmed his point. “But it’s okay, Cas. It’s okay.”
She was quiet for a moment. “Alright. I’ll have Sammy set up the spare bedroom. We’ll go over there tonight and pick up all his things. That’s no problem. How’s he doing physically?”
“Race ya!” Cas’ chair scraped as he shot to his feet. “Son of a bitch!” By the time Dean was on his feet, Cas was halfway out the door. The creek wasn’t far, but you couldn’t see it from the cottage. Dean caught up quickly and passed him. Cas was the eventual winner though, Dean’s legs getting heavy and slow about halfway there.
hey guys sorry for not posting for a while, things have been crazy as my school year wrapped up! decided to post this as my school year and theirs are ending at the same time!
When Cas had stopped crying, Dean let go of his hand. “I’m gonna go call my mom, tell her what’s up.” Cas nodded.
Dean was still sitting in quiet shock. Prison. That explained Cas’ reluctance to talk about his other brother at the beginning of the summer pretty well. Shit.
It was technically Dean’s dad’s car, his baby at that. But he’d told Mary that Dean could drive it when he had his license, and so he did. He took care of that car just as well as his dad did. For a nearly thirty year old car, she was a dream, especially for an aspiring mechanic.
“I… I do, yeah. But you need to sober up, okay? You’ll feel a little better tomorrow, and we can talk then if you remember.”
It only took a moment for Dean to close the distance between them in the small motel room. His arms looped around Cas’ waist and pulled him against his still-damp chest. Castiel let out a soft gasp that was quickly silenced by Dean’s lips on his.
Cas’ glasses pressed up against the tip of Dean’s nose, bringing him back into the reality of it all. Dean pulled away quickly, not sure what he should do with his hands.
“I mean, I can’t, okay?” Cas rinsed the plate off, put it in the drying rack, and left the kitchen. Dean rushed to put the rest of the food away.
Cas flipped a few pages backwards in his sketchbook and turned it around. On the paper stood a little cartoon version of Dean. “Woah…” Dean breathed. “That’s amazing!” The cartoon Dean was wearing his football uniform and holding his helmet under his arm. He was looking off to the side with a little smug smirk. Every detail Dean noticed awed him even more. The grass stains on his knees, the messy helmet hair, even the freckles across his nose.
“Hey Dean!” Lisa walked over in her uniform, her brunette hair pulled back with a sparkling red bow and topped with the silver homecoming queen crown. “Wanna get some dinner? The girls were going to go to Buffalo Wild Wings, but I was thinking we could go somewhere, just the two of us.”
“You know, like one of those stupid touchy-feely romance movies that girls like to make you watch on a date,” Dean said. It was quiet. Cas’ ears went red and Dean immediately realized it.
Cas turned around, surprised to see Dean. “I’m eating dinner, what else would I be doing here?” Dean rolled his eyes and grinned. He was surprised to hear Lisa speak up. “Why don’t you two join us, we got plenty of room!” She slid her food across the table and took the seat next to Dean, smiling.
Dean squared his jaw but obeyed, ushering Anna out into the hallway as she wept. He watched through the window, doing his best to comfort her. Dean couldn’t hear their conversation, but he could read their body language pretty well.
“That’s what being human does, buddy. Quit studying the cup and just drink the damn water.” Castiel felt his face contort in mockery before he took a slow sip. He drained the cup in one long pull.
Cas’ eyes were still glassy when he looked up at Dean. But Dean could tell that, at least for now, Cas was happy. And that was all he needed.
They landed with a heavy thud, Dean on top of Cas with his legs straddling Cas’ waist. Cas’ glasses had flown off, and his bright blue eyes were wide and surprised. Once the initial shock wore off, Dean got up, sitting on his knees. “Here.” He offered Cas his hand to help him sit. As Cas took it and sat up, Dean realized that he was practically sitting in Cas’ lap. He scrambled to his feet, feeling his face heat up. With a short glance, he saw Cas’ face was red too.
Cas was staring at his hands, and Dean was staring at his face. There was something inside Cas, something that was troubling him. Dean didn’t know what it was or even what it could be, but it was heavy. And he just wanted to reach out and help him carry that weight. He leaned against the desk and opened his mouth to speak, but then he heard the doorknob move and jam.
Nearly a week went by before Dean saw Cas again. He was doing his homework when he saw Cas walking on the sidewalk and staring up at his window. Dean opened it with a lopsided smile. “Hey, you gonna climb up or use the front door?”
It was December when Cas missed his first movie night. Cas was the most perfectly punctual person Dean had ever met. When Dean would say “Come over around 5:00,” Cas would knock on the front door the second the minute hand hit 12. So by 5:10, Dean was reasonably panicked. Mary was trying to calm him down, but starting to get a little worried herself.
Soon their plates were empty, their stomachs were full, and there was laughter in the air. Dean was back in the conversation, though he mostly watched Cas. Mary got to her feet with a smile. “Sammy, sweetie, can you help me with the dishes? Dean, go pick out a movie. And Cas. You are cordially invited to our movie night. That being said, start some popcorn in the microwave.” “What happened to Cas not lifting a finger?” Dean asked. “That was when he was a guest. Cas, honey, you’re welcome here anytime.”
The line went dead and Dean stood there, holding the phone up to his ear. “Dean, what happened?” Sam was standing next to him, curious as ever.
The second the bike started to move, Castiel tightened his grip on Dean’s shoulders. It was less than a mile to the pool, so they didn’t ride for too long. “Oh my goodness,” Castiel breathed when they parked. “That was so fast!” He let out a laugh, the kind of laugh that someone laughs after their first time on a roller coaster. That nervous, breathy, but excited laugh. Dean couldn’t help but smile at that.
They laid together for a while, foreheads pressed together and eyes locked, speaking through smiles and soft kisses. Dean took in a deep breath and sat up. He stretched his arms over his head and cracked his neck. “You smell bacon?” he asked.
There was Cas, and he was fine. Well. sort of. The doctors had set his nose back into place, his bruises were nearly gone, and his cast had a fair amount of signatures. He loosened his horrendous tie as he approached the car, opening the back door and tossing his bag and blazer into the backseat.
Cas didn’t answer Dean’s question. He just closed the space between their lips. Dean felt a weight lift off his shoulders that he hadn’t even known he was carrying. He looped his arms around Cas’ waist and kissed him, really kissed him. And it was right.
Cas suddenly went stiff, taking a step back. “We should, uh, go get dinner,” he mumbled, refusing to look at Dean. Dean looked at his hands, still suspended in the air, holding a phantom of Cas. “Uh, yeah. Good idea.”
Dean didn’t notice that he started crying until Mary said “oh my sweet baby, come here.” Hugging his mother tightly, he cried a good solid cry. And Mary held him through it, running her hand along his back.
Castiel’s vision swam as he floated to the bed, guided by Dean. He flopped down face first and clutched a down pillow above his head. “Humanity is so… fragile,” he muttered, feeling the bed shift as it bowed under Dean’s weight.
Dean used a finger under Cas’ chin to tilt his face toward him. “Hey, it’s gonna be okay baby. Just because you don’t live with her doesn’t mean you can’t see her.” Cas shook his head. “They won’t allow me there, or her to come here.” “Cas, Anna strikes me as a rule breaker. And you should’ve seen how upset she was when your parents made her leave. I imagine she’ll find her way over here sooner or later.”
Cas shot to his feet and went to the door. Dean followed him, taking a hold of his arm. He wasn’t holding him tightly or anything, just a soft touch. Cas turned to look, his eyes landing on Dean’s hand and then dragging up to meet his eyes, almost painfully slowly. Dean felt his eyebrows scrunch up on his forehead, concern taking over.
It was a Sunday. Dean knew he wouldn’t be seeing Cas because of his parents. Now that the school year was nearly over, though, he knew he’d be seeing more of him soon. The phone ringing caught him off guard. Dean paused the game.
He rested his head against Dean’s shoulder, closing his eyes. He couldn’t say how long they sat on the bed, letting the silence envelop them. “My stomach feels unsettled,” he said after a long moment.
Cas’ half-open eyes landed on Dean, causing Cas to smile faintly. “Dean’s here,” he croaked out. Dean’s voice came out in a hoarse whisper. “Yeah, buddy, I’m here… What happened?” “My brother… got mad.”
Dean didn’t make any sort of move to pull away from Cas, so he kept talking. “And those freckles you have just soften you so much, but you’re still so strong and solid and so... Dean.”
He felt a soft laugh rumble in Dean’s chest. “You’re funny, Cas. Now get some rest, really. I’ll be one bed over if you need me.”
Dean walked out with the rest of the boys nominated, meeting his partner in the middle of the field. Charlie was probably his best friend at Lawrence. He offered her his arm and they walked to the front of the field. “Have I told you how grateful I am that they put me with you for this shit?” Dean asked under his breath, smiling at the crowd. “Tell me about it,” she replied through her grin.
Movie Mondays at the Winchester house with Cas became a weekly sleepover event. Each week, Dean would get a sleeping bag down from the attic (though after a few weeks it moved to the front hall closet) and set it up in his room. After whatever movie it was that they watched, the boys would retreat to Dean’s room and stay up late. They’d read comics, play games on Dean’s Super Nintendo, or watch TV. The best nights, though, were when they would just talk.
Castiel found his eyes focused on the cup again. “You all are complicated beings with grey morality and seemingly endless motivations. And I suppose all humans see a negative aspect of their own personalities, but you seem to be blind to all else.”
Dean glanced into the pan on the stovetop, seeing the beautifully orange cheese that only comes from boxed macaroni. “Looks awesome, Cas,” he said with a grin.
Table set, Dean joined Cas in the hallway. “Is that your father?” Cas asked softly, looking at the happy family in one of the photos. Dean was quiet, but he nodded. “Is he…” Cas trailed off, turning to look at Dean. Dean smiled softly. “No, he’s not dead. He’s in a little country called Bosnia protecting civilians from war,” he explained. Cas nodded in understanding. “A soldier.” Dean’s smile widened. “A hero. But don’t talk about him in front of Mom. She misses him a lot.”
“You’re so beautiful,” he whispered, letting his lips trail down Cas’ neck. Cas let out a soft moan, tilting his head. Dean couldn’t help but give his warm skin a little bite, smiling at the way Cas moved and whined from it.
“Because I said so. Seriously, dude, even if you guys ‘called it’ or whatever, both me and Cas need to be ready to tell her, and in our own time. Don’t be a dick.”
There was a thick tree with one long branch that extended towards what was hopefully Cas’ window. But the trunk was bare for the first ten feet, so he’d have to climb another tree to get onto that one. Dean took a deep breath and started climbing, trying to stay quiet.
Dean ran it over his hair a few times before draping it over his shoulders. Castiel tied it around his waist. They went back out to Dean’s bike. “Can I show you something?” Dean asked. “Maybe,” Castiel replied. I guess it depends what it is.” “It’s just a really cool place that I found a few years ago. You have to promise to never tell anyone about it.” Castiel nodded, climbing back onto the bike. And they were off.
Cas turned to Lisa with a sweet smile. “Lisa, right?” She nodded. “Nice to see you again. This is April, my girlfriend.” Lisa smiled at April. “Hi April! You two are so cute, how long have you been together?” “Almost two months,” April answered, taking Cas’ hand. “Awwww!” Lisa squealed.
“I’ll get you some more wa-” Dean was cut off by Castiel’s hand pushing down on his thigh. “No, no, don’t move. I’m comfortable.”
Ah, yes. That was the voice. Even though he was on the phone, Dean felt himself adjust his posture and he cleared his throat.
“I know it’s going to be different when Lucifer comes home. We will all have to adjust. But he’s changed too, son. He’s reformed. He strayed from the path of God, and he reaped the consequences. He sought the light in the dark times and he found himself reunited with the Lord. Remember Isaiah 44:22?”
It wasn’t a thought he’d meant to say out loud, so Dean’s response elicited a small start. “Me too.”
Despite Cas’ excitement, by the time the credits rolled, Dean was the only one still awake. Sam had fallen asleep cuddled up to Mary’s side, and Cas’ head had spent the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie on Dean’s shoulder.
By the end of the game, Dean was exhausted. Cavalry had their biggest comeback in years, the game ending at 57-12.
Dean smiled. “That’s easy. A mechanic. Cars are cool as hell, and I already know a lot about ‘em. I wanna have a motorcycle, too. And I wanna have my own shop and everything,” he said.
Dean turned to go, feeling defeated. But he paused, remembering the way Cas had looked at him earlier. That look that he’d never seen, at least not on Cas. But he’d seen it before. In girls that he wooed and the characters in their movies. It all made sense. All at once, the pieces connected in Dean’s head.
Cas made a face of confusion but picked up the pencils, thinking a moment before starting to draw. “I’ll still live right down the street,” Cas said, still focused on the paper in his lap.
Dean crawled in, not exactly gracefully, but definitely quietly. Thankfully, Cas’ bed was right under the window. “Nice place ya got here,” Dean remarked, looking around at the bare walls. “You still unpacking or something?”
Dean wrapped his arm around Cas’ waist, pressing a kiss to his jaw. “You know what else sounds good?”
“Humanity is beautiful but Dean, you’re…” Castiel trailed off, wanting to use the most eloquent and flowery phrasing he could. “Beautifuller.”
“Practice? On who? I don’t know any girls that would be willing to just, just kiss some guy for practice.”
Mary and Cas chatted a little more, Sam even piping in after a while. Dean almost envied how likeable Cas was. He could carry a conversation with just about anybody, he was sweet in a genuine way, and he really listened.
Dean hunched over, his gloved knuckles brushing the turf. He cleared his throat and called to the center receiver. “Set, hike!” Dean caught the ball and ran a few paces back. He turned over his shoulder, sending it flying to the wide receiver. Cavalry made the tackle, but not before Garth had gained them 35 yards. Dean couldn’t help but wince a bit. Garth could catch anything, and ran faster than anyone he’d ever met, but the boy was a damn noodle. Garth popped right back up though, and the teams took their positions.
“I’ve never had a friend in my life that treats me like you do. You.. you care about me. Your whole family cares about me. I mean, I live here now. I just can’t risk it.”
Cas tensed up for just a moment, searching Dean’s eyes. Whatever he found there must have been satisfactory, because he let out a relieved sigh.
He looked back at Cas, who had started to chew on his lower lip, pushing his fries around on his plate. He seemed decidedly not fine, but Dean didn’t press. Not here.
“You know, son, no amount of locked doors can stop the Lord from watching over you.” “I know, sir. It wasn’t-” “Don’t argue with me, Castiel. Gabriel used to argue, and look at him now. All alone, no family to guide him.” “I’m sorry, sir.”
Dean helped her sneak out of Cas’ old window and went down the tree first to catch her if she fell. He wasn’t too surprised when she made her way down much more quickly and gracefully than he ever did.
Dean cleared his throat. “I’m not,” he replied shortly, laying out the sleeping bag. He ignored the rustling behind him, focused on making the sleeping bag align perfectly with the bed. When he finally turned around, his heart fell into his stomach.
Anna looked over to Dean. “Don’t be a doofus. I am home.” Cas let out a little laugh and squeezed her hand. “He’s right, though. Chuck and Naomi would flip their shit if they caught you,” he said. Anna snorted. “Chuck? I love it.”
Dean rode in the backseat with Cas, the ride over much shorter by car. It was only 9:10 when they got there, but Cas looked really nervous. “I’m gonna be grounded forever,” he whined as the car pulled to a stop in front of his house. Mary reached into her purse and pulled out a pen and a little drug store receipt. “If you’re not allowed to hang out, just shoot a call over,” she said, handing him the receipt with their phone number scrawled on the back.
He crossed the short space between them and paused only a few inches away from him. Dean’s hands found their way onto Cas’ hips, pulling them towards his own. Cas looked up at him for only a moment before they were kissing.
“You kiddin’ me? ‘Course not. I figured you’d tell me when you were ready for me to know,” Dean replied, reaching behind him and closing the window to stop the cold from getting in.
“Cas, you don’t have to be sorry. Being human is messy. It’s okay to let yourself fall apart a little.”
“Is there something you need, Lisa?” Cas’ tone was a little sharp, and when Dean looked at him he understood. Jealousy was painted all over Cas’ face. Dean wanted to take his hand and promise him that there was no reason to feel jealous, but he knew he couldn’t. Not in public.
“Stop saying you’re sorry, I’m fine,” Cas said. His voice was a little raspy and breathy, and Dean could feel his heartbeat still racing.
The three of them drove back to the Novak house, watching Anna shimmy up the tree and slip into the empty bedroom. Cas looked at Dean with a smile. “Thank you,” he said softly.
Dean opened up his arms and Cas practically fled into them, tucking his face into that oh-so-familiar place. Just where the neck and shoulder met. Dean stroked his hair, pressing soft kisses to the top of his head. “You don’t have to worry about them anymore, you know?”
Dean’s mouth went dry and his heart skipped a beat. “N-no not at all, something wrong with your pajamas?” Cas shrugged. “They don’t smell like you,” he replied simply.
Thoughts of the worst-case scenario ran through Dean’s head as he waited on the sidewalk with his backpack. A white minivan came down the street, stopping in front of his house. The side door slid open, and Dean saw Anna waving him towards the car.
“Well, you’re super expressive, with your face and your body language. And you’ve got those freckles and eyes and-”
The homecoming game seemed to come out of nowhere. The Lawrence Lions would be facing off against the Cavalry Cougars. Soon, the stadium was packed with red and blue. The Lawrence student section was absolutely full. In front of the bleachers, the cheer team was rallying the crowd, led by captain Lisa Braeden, Dean’s date to the dance the next night. She was plenty nice, not to mention incredibly attractive.
“That’s cuz it’s summer,” Dean said. He turned on the radio, the cassette player picking up where he’d left off on the Back in Black album. As they pulled out of the parking lot, Dean turned up the music and rolled down the windows. Cas let out a laugh and raised his good arm to flip the building off. The boys looked at each other and grinned.
A split in the curtains appeared, bathing Dean’s face in yellow lamplight. Cas stood behind the window, eyes and face red. He opened the window a crack. “Dean?” he whispered, “what the hell are you doing here?”
Cas smiled and shook his head. “It’s not so bad. I shadowed there for a few days at the end of last year. A bunch of the students are atheists too. Mass is gonna suck so much though.”
“A man can dream,” Cas replied, unbuttoning his sleeves and rolling them up his elbows. “It’s hot as shit out.”
Dean nodded. “Thanks.” He walked over to Cas and smiled. “Hey. Sammy’s setting up a room for you. My mom and I are gonna go to your house and get your stuff.”
“Roger that.” Dean practically ran down the stairs, meeting Cas barefoot in short sleeves on his front porch.
Dean chuckled softly. “An atheist angel, huh?” Castiel glared at him. “I’m not an angel, I just have a stupid name.” Dean put his hands up and laughed. “Sorry!” He glanced at his watch. “Oh, shit, I gotta be home in fifteen for dinner.”
The boys got to their feet, heading towards the door. “Can I call you Cas?” Dean asked. “Cas?” “Yeah, Cas.” Castiel was quiet for a moment. The red hot anger from moments before was gone, replaced with a solemn sort of quiet. “I guess so.” He picked up his backpack and they left the cottage.
The ride home was quiet, Cas’ head on Dean’s shoulder. When they parked, Cas started to get out of the car. “Hey,” Dean whispered. Cas turned around to look at him. “Don’t I get a kiss goodnight?” Dean asked with a pout. “You’re incorrigible,” Cas replied, rolling his eyes. Dean didn’t know what that meant, exactly, but he figured Cas didn’t mean it as he leaned in and kissed him softly. Dean played absently with the hair at the nape of Cas’ neck, toying with the cute little curls that formed there. It was a soft, sweet, and slow kiss, the kind that made Dean feel like this was where he was meant to be. And in that moment, with his car and his angel, Dean was sure that it was.
Dean nudged him awake, Cas making a soft and sleepy sound as he opened his eyes. He took a sharp breath in through his nose, stretching and letting out a yawn. “What time is it?” Cas mumbled. “It’s only 9:02, and you all knocked out,” Dean said with a chuckle. Cas shot up off the couch. “9:00 is my curfew!” he exclaimed, panic in his voice. Dean couldn’t tell if it was the volume or maternal instinct, but Mary woke up. “You need a ride home, hon?” she asked Cas, already on her feet and searching for her keys.
“Here,” Dean said softly. Cas sat up and took the cup of water he was offered. He peered into it, wishing he could examine each molecule. “I used to have a tolerance for the drink, Dean. Now I seem to have lost my edge.”
Dean stared at his watch, smiling to himself as he heard Cas’ front door open the moment it turned noon. “Ya know, if I say noon but I’m here at 11:55, you’re allowed to come outside,” Dean said with a laugh. Cas rolled his eyes and got on the bike, backpack stuffed like always. “Just drive, dude.”
That night, Dean couldn’t sleep. He wrestled with thoughts of getting older and wiser and sadder. That wasn’t what he wanted. But it was almost too late. Now that he had a job, summer could never be biking around and swimming and hanging out in abandoned cottages. He was starting to become an adult, and that thought didn’t sit well with him at all.
“I’m so Dean?” Castiel caught another amused flash of a smile. He mirrored it and nodded, closing his eyes and letting his cheek press against Dean’s chest. He became hyper aware of Dean’s hand gently resting on his hip and his own hand on Dean’s thigh.
Dean laughed, peppering kisses across Cas’ neck and jaw. “I saw your face when you were talking to Lisa. You don’t have to get jealous, baby, you know I’m all yours.” Cas didn’t respond, Dean taking that as a prompt to continue going. “Y’know, I like seeing you all protective though, I will admit. It’s kinda hot.” Cas let out a whimper and Dean grinned.
Dean called the Novak house. It took awhile for it to be picked up, but Dean let out a relieved sigh when Anna spoke. “Novak residence, Anna speaking.”
Now Dean was blushing. “Did you have to give him the freckles?” he groaned. Cas smiled and pulled the book back towards himself. “Uh, yeah, it’s easily one of your most defining characteristics. So do you like it?”
Dean took the back way to Lawrence Middle. The longer country roads let Dean drive as fast as he wanted, and boy could the Impala fly. Regardless of taking the long way, they arrived at the school before Sam was done with his band banquet.
Dean’s next line was a bit softer. Maybe he’d noticed Cas’ reaction to how loud it was in this damn room, or maybe he knew to tread a certain topic lightly.
“No. She dumped me after homecoming, cuz she could tell I like boys.” Cas let out another giggle. “Boys are pretty…” Cas wore a tired half-smile as he dazed off into his thoughts.
“Yeah, I know, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m the guy wearing it. I’m not gonna change up on you just because I have to go to this stupid school. You’re my best friend, Dean. No ugly jacket and awful tie is gonna change that.”
“That’s still like not even half as much time as we got to hang out in the summer. And we’ll have homework and stuff. Your parents will probably only let you have sleepovers on Friday and Saturday nights! Well, not Saturdays, you’d have church in the morning still. What if you make a new best friend? And he lives closer and he’s cooler and rich and-” “Dean.”
Cas caught his eye and smiled at him. Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen Cas smile so much in the nearly year he’d known him as he had in the past week.
They played for a few hours, and spent the rest of the evening talking. Dean was halfway reading a comic book and Cas was drawing something in a book Dean hadn’t seen before.
The door gave a sad squeak as Dean pulled it open. “Hello, Mr. Singer, I-” “Dean, you call me Mr. Singer, you may as well call me old man. How’ve you been, son?” Dean couldn’t help but smile a little. “Sorry, Bobby. I’ve been good. You?” Bobby let out a little scoff-chuckle. “Yeah, yeah, fine as ever. How can I help ya?”
Cas blushed and paused for a moment, giving Dean the chance to win the round before noticing. “Hell yes!” Dean cheered, tossing the controller. He looked over to see Cas sitting there, lost in that brain of his again.
Sam walked up to the car and tossed his backpack in, waving goodbye to the blonde girl. He got in and buckled, looking up to find the two older boys staring at him. “What?”
Castiel looked back to the house and let out a tired sigh. “Well. I guess I might see you around,” he said. Dean nodded, watching as Castiel walked away. “Hey, wait!” Dean called. Castiel stopped and turned back to him. “Um, do you want to go to the pool later? I’m sure you’re tired from all that stuff you’ve been carrying.” Castiel smiled softly. “My parents would never let me go to a public pool,” he replied. “Who said anything about asking your parents?” Dean asked with a lifted eyebrow.
Cas’ shirt landed haphazardly on a tree branch and he leapt into the water, tucking his legs up to his chest. Dean followed him in, diving headfirst.
Dean raked his fingers through his hair, looking back at Cas’ drawing. “You know, you surprise me every day.”
Dean didn’t pay mind to the ding of the door opening until the new customers walked by his and Lisa’s booth. Cas and April were on their way to the other end of the restaurant. “Cas? What the hell are you doing here?”
When the boys arrived back at the house, there was no one else home. They went up to Dean’s room and played Mortal Kombat 3, Cas sitting in Dean’s lap. Dean had to wrap his arms around Cas’ waist to use his controller, but neither of them seemed to mind. Dean rested his chin on Cas’ shoulder. They didn’t hear the front door open or Sam’s footsteps up the stairs. They did, however, hear the loud gasp when Sam saw them, cuddled up with the door wide open. “Oh my god I fucking called it! Yes! Mom owes me twenty bucks!”
Lisa made a face at him. “Of course I won’t tell anyone. That’s not my business.” She smiled, looking between them. “I’m really glad you guys figured it out. Honestly. Have a good summer, okay? And, please, wear a condom.” She tossed the bag into the dumpster across the alley and went back into the diner.
“Normally, I’d be right with you. But…” she trailed off. “You’re a wonderful guy. Fantastic, actually. You’re funny and sweet and you’re like really hot and-”
“Not as hot as this, though,” he continued, his voice low and breathy. “Something thrilling about knowing we might get-”
It was 12:25 when Dean found himself back at the Novak house. But Castiel didn’t come outside until 12:30 exactly. He had a small backpack, and it looked absolutely stuffed. Dean laughed a little to himself. “Step on up,” Dean said. “Step up where?” Castiel asked, looking concerned. “See those little bars sticking out from the sides on the back wheel? That’s where you stand, and you hold onto my shoulders.”
“Hmph,” he grumbled, handing the cup back to Dean. “I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to drinking water, though that was rather pleasing.”
Cas was covered in bruises and cuts, his nose was broken, and his left arm was in a sling. In the hospital gown and bed, he looked so pale and fragile. Dean didn’t even notice the tears welling up in his eyes until they blurred Cas into a black and blue mess.
The second Dean’s head broke the water, Cas launched a splash at his face. “Aw, come on man, that’s not fair!” Dean whined, splashing back at him. And the war was off, the two boys splashing at one another so quickly they could hardly hear. Dean got an idea.
Cas was still coughing, but it was dying down. Guilt swept in, grabbing Dean’s shoulders and digging cold, sharp fingertips into his skin. Dean used one hand to help Cas sit up, and the other to push his wet hair out of his face. Dean didn’t even realize he was talking until Cas’ hand covered his mouth as the coughing stopped.
Cas’ father put a firm hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Now, Dean, rage does not befit the human race. Only our Lord can truly-” Dean pulled himself away, turning on him. “Oh, I’m not just mad at him. You were the one who insisted that he come live with you, despite Cas’ obvious aversion to it. Ya think maybe Cas knew he was dangerous? Knew that something like this was gonna happen? You don’t even look upset! Do you even care about him?!”
Cas and April looked at each other for a moment before agreeing. Cas sat across from Dean with a soft smile. “So, what’s up?” Cas asked. “I’m eating dinner, what else would I be doing here?” Dean echoed smugly. Cas rolled his eyes and laughed. “I cannot stand you.” “Good thing you’re sitting.” “Shut up!”
When they walked in, Mary was still at work, but there were three little presents, wrapped up on the table. She’d written their names in Sharpie. Sammy got a book of blank sheet music, and Dean got Mortal Kombat 3. Cas had been given a set of colored pencils, but they weren’t a brand that Dean recognized. They looked expensive. Looking at Cas’ face, Dean could tell that he was fighting back tears. “Cas, wanna give this game a test run?”
“In the office,” the guy - Benny, according to the nametag- said, jerking a thumb towards a grey door nearly hidden in the wall. Dean nodded his thanks and headed towards the door, knocking. “Come in,” came a gruff, familiar voice.
“Okay,” Dean repeated. “We’ll take it nice and slow, okay? And, you know, we’ll stop if it gets too weird. And we won’t let it make things weird between us. Deal?” He barely registered Cas saying ‘deal’ back.
Dean parked in the parent pickup lane and turned the music down a bit. “So, how’s it feel knowing you’ll never have to go back to that damn school?” Dean asked.
Dean smiled faintly. “Thanks Sammy.” He went up to his room, grabbing a few comic books so Cas would have something for the boredom. What if Cas wasn’t even awake? What if he was sick, like really really sick?
“Uh, no, sir, it must be stuck. It does that sometimes. You just have to wiggle it a few times and it’ll come loose,” Cas called back. The doorknob jiggled as Dean tried to get the rest of his body under the bed. Cas adjusted the covers so Dean couldn’t be seen. The second Dean got his feet under, he heard Cas open the door.
He stopped laughing when Cas came back up. The look of panic on his face as he coughed and thrashed was unlike anything he’d ever seen. “Cas?!” Dean wrapped Cas’ arm around his shoulders and swam him over to the creekbank, walking up the wall of mud and sitting Cas down in the grass.
“No, no, sorry to bother you guys…” Lisa went red and went back behind the counter. Dean felt her looking back at them every so often.
The morning sunrays were blaring against Castiel’s eyelids and he could practically hear how bright they were. Fumbling for the nightstand, Cas saw that Dean had refilled his water, and placed two little white pills next to the glass. ‘For the headache,’ a note read.
Dean drove home feeling like he was on top of the world, windows down and music blaring. He parked the car in the driveway and went inside, pausing in the front door. In the kitchen, he could see his mom and Cas hovering over the stove.
Castiel looked around, tracing his fingers over the stove. “Dean, this place is amazing! How did you find it?”
Castiel stood there, motionless. “Uh, well, I guess… What do I tell them?” Dean shrugged. “You look smart. I’m sure you’ll think of something. You got a bike?” Castiel shook his head. “Hm. That’s fine. I’ll be back around 12:30.” “Okay then. I’ll see you soon, Dean.”
Dean couldn’t say for sure how much time passed between when he woke and when Cas did. When Cas’ eyelids fluttered open, Dean was simply staring and admiring him.
With a quick almost-glance, Cas could tell that Dean’s eyes were on him. He tried not to feel his gaze. “In yourself you see flaws and faults and… absence.”
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at the dreamy expression on Cas’ face. Cas chuckled along with him, shaking his head. “Fuck that place. Wanna help me burn my uniform?”
sorry i kind of fell off this, ive been super busy lately! anyway, shits about to hit the fan, so hold onto your hats. as always, comments are appreciated so i don’t feel like i’m just throwing words into the void
Castiel scrunched up his face and shook his head. “I hate falling asleep. I much preferred my existence as an angel where sleep was futile.”
Cas closed his eyes and nestled into Dean’s chest. Dean fell asleep pretty quickly, and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so relaxed.
Football season made it hard to see Cas. Even when Dean didn’t have practice, he was spending time with his team for “bonding” or whatever. Coach Singer made it clear that he had to be there if he wanted a shot at captain his senior year. “A team does more than play together,” he would say. The guys were fine, Dean thought. He didn’t dislike any of them, but he wasn’t really close with them. They got along just fine. But compared to the friendship he’d built with Cas, they were practically strangers.
“Well, your dad seems like a boatload of fun,” Dean mumbled, stretching his arms out. “He always so charming?”
Cas pressed his lips together, and Dean couldn’t help but watch. He suddenly thought back to the kiss they’d shared at the end of last summer. When Cas’ lips parted again, Dean had an overwhelming urge to lean in and taste them again. He looked back to Cas’ eyes, those bright blue eyes, staring back up at him with a feeling he couldn’t place. Dean knew Cas well, but not this well. This was new. Cas stayed frozen as Dean’s other hand, with a mind of its own, reached up to cup Cas’ jaw. He watched his thumb trace a soft line along Cas’ cheekbone. He barely even registered Cas tilting his head to rest it in Dean’s palm.
Cas moved away from the bed and sat down in his desk chair, letting out a sigh. “You don’t know that,” he said quietly.
Cas followed her instructions, focused entirely on the pan in front of him. Mary looked over as Dean closed the door. “Hey, sweetie, you’re just in time for lunch!” Dean kicked off his shoes and walked into the kitchen. “Smells good,” he said, “what is it?” Mary smiled. “I’m teaching Cas how to make mac and cheese. He’s a very quick learner.”
By halftime, the Lions had a huge lead, the scoreboard blaring a bright 27-0. The teams took to the locker rooms as the cheer and dance teams overtook the field. Dean pulled off his helmet and rifled through his bag, pulling out his homecoming court sash. He wouldn’t be king, as he wasn’t a senior, but he could be a prince. Like that meant anything. He pulled it on over his jersey and headed back outside.
Castiel wasn’t exactly sure how he got the key to turn in the lock, but he felt a surge of satisfaction as he swung the door to the motel room open. His body fell into the room, supported by the death grip he had on the door.
Castiel nodded. “The Bible. My sister and brothers and I are all named after angels.” Dean quirked an eyebrow as Castiel took the seat next to him. “You got brothers?” he asked. Castiel nodded. “Yeah. Gabe left the second he turned eighteen. None of us have heard from him since. My parents just act like he never existed. All the pictures we have… it’s just me and Anna.”
Cas didn’t say anything, but Dean could read his face all too well. Cas wasn’t used to loving parents.
The current team captain, a senior named Gordon, was leading the team in a pep talk. If Dean was being honest, they didn’t need much of a pep talk to beat Cavalry. Every year, like clockwork, Lawrence handed Cavalry their rich Catholic asses on a silver platter.
Other than a few snaggy twigs and one really pissed off bird, Dean had no trouble getting up to the branch. He slowly crawled out on it, knowing that one wrong move could send him down nearly twenty feet to the ground. Keeping his weight steady he reached out and knocked on the window.
They stepped out into the hallway. “Anna, we’re leaving,” his father said, his face expressionless. “What?” Anna asked, wiping at her face. “I said we’re leaving.”
Dinner was awkward. Cas acted normal around Sam and Mary, talking about his new pencils, his plans for the summer, Sammy’s band award, and all the other hot talking points. Dean was too busy thinking about what the hell had just happened. He ate, spoke when spoken to, and tried not to stare at Cas. Their eyes didn’t meet throughout the meal, but he could feel Cas’ gaze when he looked anywhere else.
At that, Cas started to cry. Dean held him close, running his hand up and down Cas’ back. The feeling of Cas’ fingers clinging to the back of his shirt caused Dean to tear up too. As much as they bickered, he couldn’t imagine losing Sam like that. And so suddenly? That would be hell.
They made their way to the bed, Cas laying down beneath Dean. Every movement was slow and smooth. Dean took a moment to just look, taking it all in. Cas, laying on his bed, cheeks flushed and hair even messier than usual. Dean’s heart melted.
Dean smiled a little. “Hey, Cas.” He looked at the nurse with an eyebrow raised, asking a silent question. “Morphine,” she answered. “For the pain. He’ll be a little goofy for a bit, and then it’ll knock him out.”
Hmmm, whoever could Lisa be talking about? Also sorry for how badly the game is written, I only went to football games to sing the anthem. And it’s about to get angsty, so hold on to your mf hat.
Cas visibly suppressed a smile and opted instead for a nice eye roll. He opened the window the rest of the way. “You know you’re insane, right? It’s like twenty degrees outside!” “I’m wearing a coat.” “Keep your voice down.”
Dean shook his head, taking the bottle. “I don’t wear sunscreen. I would if it prevented these damn freckles.” He sprayed Castiel’s back. “I think your freckles are nice,” Castiel said, turning around when Dean was done. Without the glasses on, Castiel’s eyes looked ten times bigger. Dean didn’t know if he’d ever seen a blue that bright before. They were a shocking sort of electric blue, even clearer than the pool water on this sunny day.
Lisa picked up her purse. “I had fun, guys. It was really nice to meet you. April, next time I see you, you have to bring me pictures of that dress! It sounds gorgeous.” Dean scooted out of the booth. “Yeah, it was great meeting you April. I’ll see you on Monday, Cas.”
Dean cracked his knuckles, turning the old dull doorknob. He had to use his shoulder to open the door, a grunt following as he shoved his way into the small one room cottage. There wasn’t much left as far as furniture went, just an ancient iron stove, two steel chairs, and a couch that seemed to be barely held together. The floral wallpaper was peeling away from the wall.
Dean’s eyes went wide. “Oh my god I am so sorry I didn’t mean to-” “You’re all good, kid. Happens all the time. What’s up?” The older guy was rubbing the back of his head. Dean caught a glimpse of the nametag on his jumpsuit. “Is Bobby here?” Dean asked.
“Seriously?” he groaned. “Mom, I’m fifteen. I think it should be illegal for fifteen year olds to have to fold laundry.” His mom laughed. She had a pretty laugh, Dean thought, and even though she was still young, she had smile lines and crow’s feet forming from all her laughter. “I think it should be illegal for you to be such a little shit,” she replied, plopping the basket down on the floor at the foot of the couch. “Home by 6 for dinner,” she called over her shoulder as she left the living room.
Getting Cas moved in was easy. By the time Cas got out of the hospital, Dean had set up his bedroom very similarly to his old one, but he’d hung up posters of Cas’ favorite movies, games, and bands. When Dean had picked Cas up from the hospital and brought him to his new home, Cas had broken down in tears and clung to Dean for a while. And Dean just held him through it. His fingers became used to carding through Cas’ thick hair, his shoulder used to Cas’ head.
Dean laughed. “Hell of a game, huh?” Cas shrugged. “I dunno. Again, I don’t know anything about football. Well, except that Cavalry is terrible at it.”
Dean got up and met Cas at the closet door, finding a navy blue t-shirt and trading Cas the sleeping bag for it. He tried to hide the fact that his cheeks felt hot, but Cas’ smile told him he wasn’t successful. “Why are you blushing?” Cas pried, a smirk growing ever wider across his lips.
Cas nodded slowly, his eyes still wide and bewildered. “Uh, yeah, I’m fine. She took that pretty well…”
Castiel smiled up at Dean, nodding. “Just peachy, thank you very much,” came his slurred response. His next step was another stumble, and he fell into the sturdy warmth of Dean’s chest. Strong hands supported his shoulders and he could almost hear Dean saying something else.
He disappeared under the water and opened his eyes. Through the murky water, he could see Cas’ legs. He swam over, grabbed his ankle, and pulled. He surfaced, laughing so hard he could barely breathe.
A tap on his shoulder brought him back. Dean hadn’t even realized he’d been staring. “Sorry, what?” he asked, looking over at Lisa. “I asked if you were ready to go,” she asked with a smile. Something had changed in her smile, but he couldn’t figure out what. Maybe she was just tired. “Oh, yeah, right. Uh, have we paid?” “April paid for all of us, because she’s the coolest,” Lisa replied. “You look tired,” she continued.
Castiel got off first, Dean following and locking the bike to the bike rack. Dean led him through the locker room to the showers. He pulled off his shirt and took a quick rinse. Thankfully, this pool let people wear their swimsuits in the shower. Castiel was quick to follow, setting his glasses carefully on the bench next to his backpack. They stepped out of the locker room into the sun. They found a chair to leave their stuff at, Castiel opening his bag and digging through it. He pulled out a bottle of the spray on sunscreen, spraying his arms, chest, legs, and neck. “Could you spray my back?” Castiel asked, holding the bottle out to Dean. “I’ll get yours.”
Less than a week into the summer, Dean knew he had to get a job. If he was going to be taking Cas on dates, he’d need money. Thankfully, he didn’t have to look far.
“You are loved. My mom adores the hell out of you, Sammy looks up to you, and me?” Dean pressed a kiss to his forehead. “I can’t imagine life without you.”
Once the initial surprise passed, Dean looked at Cas. “Did my family place bets on us?” Cas didn’t answer, too busy cracking up. Dean couldn’t help but stare. The way his nose was crinkled up, his bright smile, just the sound of his laugh. It was enough to melt his heart. He tightened his arms around Cas’ waist and peppered his face with kisses. This, in turn, caused Cas to laugh even harder.
When Cas’ hand wrapped around Dean’s own, he knew he’d helped. Dean wasn’t an expert in helping others or emotional intimacy or anything like that, but sometimes he felt like an expert on Cas, and that was enough. Sometimes, Dean was able to be whatever Cas needed him to be, and he was even able to say the right things.
Lisa was quiet for a moment, looking like she was carefully choosing her words. “I can’t do this in good conscience. You don’t have feelings for me and I can tell you have them for someone else. And that’s fine! Really, it is. That kind of connection just isn’t something I want to get between.”
Loving Cas was easy once Dean let himself fall. It was like every moment of his life led up to this, and he couldn’t believe his luck. A few days after their first real kiss, Dean took Cas out to lunch. The diner was packed, but they were able to get the same booth as last time. Cas was talking, and Dean wasn’t listening. He was too busy looking. The way Cas lit up when something got him excited just melted Dean right to the core. Dean had a dreamy smile and part of his straw on his lips, his chin in his hand, and his eyes unwaveringly focused on Cas.
It took a few moments for the boys to find the glasses, Dean eventually spotting them under the bed. He reached under and grabbed them, handing them to Cas. The fall had bent them slightly out of shape, so they didn’t sit quite right on Cas’ nose. Dean reached out and fixed them, placing his hands on Cas’ shoulders when he was done. “There. Good as new.”
Castiel sat down in the chair next to his bag. “Castiel, what are you doing?” “Sitting.” “Why?” “I don’t know.” “Let’s get in the pool!” “Oh, I, uh…” “You can swim, right?” “No.” “Then I’ll teach you.” “Really?” “Yeah! Taught my brother and my friend Benny, I can teach you too.”
Dean and Cas rode off on the bike, the sun just starting to set on the first day of a beautiful friendship.
They swam and played and laughed for hours, until one of the lifeguards blew her whistle. “It is now 5:00, the pool is closed. Thank you for your patronage.” She sounded less than grateful for their patronage. The boys climbed out of the pool, Cas tossing Dean a towel from his backpack.
When they sat down, Lisa was eyeing him and Dean was eyeing her right back. He ordered fries and a chocolate shake, Lisa getting a salad and water. They made small talk, flirting and laughing.
Cas’ eyes were wide, his glasses crooked. Dean reached out and adjusted his glasses, licking his lips as he did. Those blue eyes flicked down to Dean’s mouth and he pressed his lips together self-consciously.
Dean smiled, feeling a little relieved. “Yes, sir, I’m very serious. I’d like to work here, and not just as a summer job. I also hope to open up my own shop, though I promise I won’t steal any of your boys.”
Dean sat down and talked with Cas until he fell asleep. As their conversation went on, Cas was less and less coherent. “Oh, Cas, I almost forgot. Mom said to tell you she loves you.”
Cas went to the closet to grab the sleeping bag, getting on his tiptoes to get it down from the top shelf. He paused for a moment. “Dean, would it be weird if I slept in one of your t-shirts?”
Cas put his hand up. “I know, Dean. I know I can tell you anything. Except I can’t. Because some things you can’t come back from, and I can’t lose this.”
Dean grinned, nodding. “Yeah, I do. It’s awesome. Like really incredible. I mean, I kind of look like a tool in it, but ya know.”
Dean stared at him and they had a silent conversation. ”Dude, what the hell?” “I dunno, she asked!” “Well don’t get me in trouble, asshat!” “Okay sorry!”
Castiel put a hand to his head. “Regretfully so. I feel like I crossed quite a few of your personal boundaries.”
As Castiel swallowed the pills, the bathroom door swung open. Dean stepped out, a towel wrapped loosely around his hips. Castiel tried not to stare, instead looking at Dean’s wet mess of hair.
Those broken-glass eyes that met his nearly shattered his heart. “Hey, it’s okay.” Dean’s knuckles traced a gentle line down Cas’ cheek. “I’m here. I’m right here and I will stay right here. I can’t even imagine what you must have been through but baby I’m here.” Dean cupped Cas’ face in his hands and kissed his forehead. “I’m right here.”
Soon, the laundry was put away, or at least in a stack on his closet floor. So Dean hopped on his bike and started to ride around town. He didn’t really have any sort of destination in mind, usually Dean found adventure along the way. A few miles from his house, he saw a big yellow moving van. Either someone was lucky enough to be getting out of Lawrence, or some poor soul had no idea how boring it was going to be. Looking back to the road, he squeezed the brakes on the handlebars of his bike so hard he almost crashed. In the road stood an orange cat, just staring at Dean. He stopped just in time to avoid running it over, but it just stared. Dean stared right back. “What’s your problem?” No response. “Asshole,” he grumbled.
They got there a few minutes early. “Hello, boys!” Mary called from the kitchen. “Dean, set the table. And don’t let Cas lift a finger!” Dean let out a quiet sigh. “I heard that,” came her voice. So Dean went to set the table. Cas stood there awkwardly at first, but started to look at the pictures that were hung in the hallway outside the dining room.
It was the first time he’d biked to Cas’ in the dark. He leaned his bike against the side of the garage and walked around the back of the house. There were two rooms visible on the top floor in the back, and one had pink walls. So, Dean decided to take his chances with the other room, looking for a way up.
Cas paused. “Lucifer called me a faggot when he was hitting me. They asked me if it was true. I said yes. My dad told me to never go back to the house and then they just left.” Cas broke down crying. It wasn’t like the quiet tears from minutes before, or even the angry tears from that night in December. This was a whole new level, a side of Cas Dean had never seen before. Dean walked back over to the bed. “Hey, hey, it’s gonna be okay.” He took Cas’ unslinged hand and squeezed it. “We have a guest room, and my mom will let you stay. I know she will. You’ll be okay.” With his other hand, he reached up to brush Cas’ hair back from his forehead. “You’ll be okay.”
“Yeah, you’re right.” Dean chewed at his lower lip. “I mean, don’t take this in a weird way or anything, but I’ve got a lot of, uh, experience. I could sort of… teach you.”
“Yeah, and I liked her too. I think she thought I was in love with Charlie or something,” Dean said with a chuckle. “Charlie’s even gayer than you, though.” Cas had met Charlie a time or two, and they seemed to get along really well.
Dean quirked an eyebrow. “C’mon Cas, ‘course I’m not gonna laugh. I’m only a little bit of an asshole.”
Cas finished his school year at Cavalry, as his parents had paid for the entirety of his sophomore year. On the last day of school for both Lawrence Public Schools and Cavalry, Dean waited in the Impala to pick Cas up. Oh, the Impala.
“I don’t want you to get in trouble for being here. Does your mom even know you’re gone?” Cas asked.
It was quiet for a moment. Dean worried he’d overstepped some kind of boundary. He was going to say something but Cas beat him to it. “Okay.”
He was met by a cool breeze and bright blue eyes. “Hello, Dean,” Cas said. He was wearing a blue Cavalry jersey, standing with a pretty girl with long ginger hair, tied half-up in standard good girl fashion. Dean smiled brightly. “Hey Cas! This April?” Cas nodded, Dean offering her a smile. “Nice to meet ya, I’m Dean, Cas’ neighbor.”
Lisa released another squeal. “Aww! I could tell from the night of the game, you two were sooo sweet on each other. This is so cute!”
The student council president, Jo Harvelle, walked to the center of the field with a microphone. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a ponytail and she wore the official homecoming game t-shirt. “Hey everyone! Thank you so much for coming out to the 1994 homecoming game!” The red half of the stadium erupted into cheers.
Dean opened the door. Cas was sitting at his desk, his colored pencils out. Dean eased the door shut, leaning back on it. “Cas, look, whatever I did, I’m-”
Within minutes, the team was running out onto the field, met by loud cheers and an amp to the music. Dean spotted Sammy and his mom almost immediately, Mary waving around a big #67 sign so crazily that her arms might fall off. He glanced briefly at the visitors' bleachers, hoping to see Cas in the field of blue. He didn’t have any luck, taking position.
With one bite of pancakes left, Dean decided to come out to his mother. He set down his fork on his plate. It clattered a little louder than he had planned and completely hushed the conversation. Everyone was looking at him.
Dean cut him off with a soft kiss. He felt Cas freeze up, so he pulled away only far enough to speak. “Who said you can’t have me?” he whispered. When Dean opened his eyes, he saw a tear running down Cas’ face. “I never… pictured myself with a guy. But when I kissed you last summer, it felt… it didn’t feel like practice. It felt real. It felt right. And maybe it is a bad idea, because if it goes south everything would get so messy, so fast.” Dean took Cas’ face in his hands and smiled softly. “But, Cas, I’ve never felt the way I do when I’m with you. It just feels… I dunno, it feels right. Believe me when I tell you this is something I want. Took me a while to realize, but I do want this. I want you.”
Mr. Novak stood silent for a moment. “Due to his own life choices, Castiel is no longer welcome in our home. And I suggest you come home with us, unless you’d like to join him.”
Cas was pretty quiet for the rest of the night. He’d pipe in every now and then, but Dean could read him like a book. He was lost somewhere in that head of his, thinking about something that seemed to be bothering him. Dean nudged his leg with his foot. “Hey, man, you alright?” “Hm? Oh, yeah, I’m fine.”
“Look, Cas…” Dean started. “I’m not gonna say I get it, because I don’t, I really don’t, but you know you can tell me anything, right? I mean, you’re my best friend. Part of my job is to be here for you. Don’t get me wrong, you’re allowed to keep any secrets you want, but you don’t have to. You never have to.”
Cas shrugged. “Nothin’ wrong with having a nice shirt laying around. And have you seen my ass in these? I’m keeping ‘em.”
Cas was quiet for a while. “What do you wanna be when you grow up? When you get out of Lawrence and you can be whoever you dream of being?” Cas asked, his pencil still.
“I love you too, Dean. So much.” She hugged him, and Dean noticed for the first time that they were the same height. He squeezed her back for a moment before heading out the door.
Cas cracked open the door, looking pale. Dean sat up, squinting against the yellow light of the hallway. “Did I wake you up?” Cas whispered, shuffling into Dean’s room.
“Well, what do I do if I’m a bad kisser? I’ve never kissed anyone before, so I won’t even know, and then she’ll know, and then she won’t like me anymore, and then-” Dean grabbed his shoulder. “Cas, take a breath, dude.”
Mary let out an excited squeal. “Oh, yay! My baby got a job!” She paused for a moment. “Oh my god… am I old?”
“That doesn’t seem safe,” Castiel responded, his eyebrows scrunching up behind his glasses. “You’ll be fine,” Dean laughed, “my kid brother rides like that all the time.” Castiel seemed to analyze the situation for a moment before stepping onto the bars cautiously. He wavered slightly, gripping onto Dean’s shoulders. “Ready?” Dean asked over his shoulder. “I guess,” came the response.
Their lips met. Cas’ lips were soft and tasted like salt and popcorn butter. At first, they didn’t move. But as they slowly got used to this new feeling, their lips started to move together and they were kissing. Like really kissing. Dean felt Cas’ shoulders lose their tension under his hand and he, too, relaxed. Dean’s hand moved to the back of Cas’ neck, pulling him closer. Cas put a cautious hand on Dean’s waist.
Cas rolled his eyes and April giggled behind her hand. “He’s my best friend,” Cas said, pointing a playful glare at Dean. “Anyway, just wanted to see how you’re doing. I have no idea how football works, but you seem like you’re doing a great job,” Cas continued, running a hand through his hair. Dean laughed. “Thanks, Cas. I gotta run.” He gave him a firm pat on the shoulder before jogging over to where the rest of the court was lined up.
Cas seemed to light up at that, going into the kitchen to get the popcorn ready. Mary showed him where everything was. Dean watched them with a smile. He loved how easily Cas fit into their little family. Still smiling to himself, Dean went into the living room and searched the drawers for a good movie they’d all enjoy. The DVD case for Raiders of the Lost Ark looked back at him. Cas had just finished the comic books for that movie. It was perfect.
“Cas…” Dean looked away, his face reddening. Blushing was one of the strangest human behaviors in Cas’ mind. The silence felt like forever. “I’m not gonna do something like that when you’re drunk. I don't… I don’t not want to, but I won’t.”
Dean glanced over to the girls, who were talking about something excitedly. Lisa was making nig hand gestures, and April was smiling and laughing.
Lisa narrowed her eyes ever so slightly. Dean couldn’t help wondering what she was thinking. She looked over to Cas. “How’s April doing?”
Cas still smelled like a campfire a few hours later as they played Mortal Kombat. At first, Cas was easily the worst at this game that Dean had ever seen. But as they played, Cas learned where the buttons were and what they did. Soon, he was winning every match.
... it’s been a minute, huh? I’m working full time but this is my last week of summer classes so hopefully that should free me up to write and post more? I guess we’ll just have to wait and see lol
Dean got up and called out into the hallway. “Sammy! Don’t tell Mom yet, okay? You’ll get your money and everything, but just don’t tell her.”
“Come on in,” Dean said, pushing the door open. It was then that Dean noticed he was carrying that damn backpack, stuffed full of whatever.
The blazer took forever to catch on fire. The tie, however, burned up quickly. Once they got the fire to take to the blazer, though, they couldn’t have stopped it if they wanted to. Thankfully, they didn’t. Cas was laughing and smiling, bantering back and forth with Sam. Dean just watched them. Cas fit into their family so well, it was like he was meant to be there.
Castiel wasn’t normally the touchy type, especially around Dean, but neither man moved away from the contact. The weight of Dean’s cheek pressed against the top of Cas’ head and he let out a soft sigh.
Cas let out a sigh. “Oh my God, you can’t imagine, Dean. I didn’t believe in Heaven until I knew how it felt to walk out of that place for the last time.”
A soft pat on the shoulder signaled Castiel to roll over onto his back and peek at Dean, who outstretched his hand.
Cas was wearing the t-shirt - and only the t-shirt. His flannel pajamas were abandoned on the floor next to him, his glasses set carefully next to the alarm clock. Just as Dean had hoped, the navy blue shirt made his eyes look even brighter, and the waxy moonlight was only helping. Cas was obviously a little out of his comfort zone, and Dean realized wearing this little was probably a first for Cas. The pink tinge in his cheeks and shaky eye contact told Dean that Cas was a little nervous, but ready for… well, Dean would have to see.
Dean chewed at his lip. He hated to interrupt the moment, but he knew he had to. “Alright, Anna Banana, don’t want you getting into any trouble. Let’s get you home.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know…” she chewed at her lip. Lisa looked like she had a burning question that would explode inside of her if she didn’t ask it, but for some reason she kept it inside.
“Just for the summer, then I’m going to school in California. What are you guys up to?” Lisa had that same unreadable look from the last time they were in the diner, and she was watching the two of them like a hawk.
Castiel Novak had always seemed so sure of himself, confident in his uniqueness. Seeing him look so embarrassed and vulnerable made Dean want to pull him into a hug, just so he knew he was loved.
Bobby’s face seemed to light up. “You serious? I was just about to put up a help wanted sign! One of my boys just moved off to start up his own shop and took a couple boys with him, so it’s been just me and Benny. He’s good, but he can’t do it all.”
After he set it up, he helped Cas finish up the popcorn bowl. Once the fourth bag was in, they brought it into the living room together. The four of them squeezed onto the couch, Mary on one end next to Sam, and Cas on the other end next to Dean. Dean pressed play on the remote and Cas gasped. “They made it a movie?” he asked incredulously. Dean laughed a little. “Yeah, yeah they did.”
The dance was fun, even more so when the punch got spiked. Dean danced and bantered with Lisa, and the weird way she’d been acting the night before seemed to vanish. His head hadn’t cleared up all the way by the time Lisa had him back in front of his house again. He leaned forward to kiss her, but she stopped him with a hand on his chest.
“Draw it,” Dean answered pointedly. He hopped off the bed and went over to his desk, rifling through a drawer. He tossed Cas a box of colored pencils and a notebook, going back to the bed.
Dean shrugged. “I’ve lived in this town my whole life. I like to explore.” Castiel turned to him and smiled. “You’re a really good explorer.” He took off his backpack and unzipped it, digging through it once more. “Are you thirsty?” he asked, looking back up at Dean.
“Castiel is at St. Josephine Memorial Hospital. His mother and Anna and I are about to go visit him and Naomi was- er, we were wondering if you’d like to come with us.”
Dean’s room was practically covered in posters for video games, movies, classic rock bands, and more. To compare it to Cas’ room was downright sad.
He walked into Singer Automotive with a confident smile to hide the nervousness. This job could be the first step in a life-long career he’d always dreamed of. There was a guy bent over in the hood of a car, so Dean walked up. “Excuse me?” They guy jumped, smacking the back of his head against the hood. “Shit!”
It was nearly 2:30 when they both settled down for the night, lips swollen and hearts full. Dean was on his back with Cas’ head on his chest and arm draped across his waist. Dean was getting sleepy, but Cas didn’t seem to be. He was lazily drawing shapes over Dean’s now-bare chest with one finger, humming a soft tune.
That night, Dean didn’t tell Cas where he was going. He simply took his keys and left, driving straight down the street. He parked his car far enough away to be inconspicuous and took to the trees again. He couldn’t reach the window he wanted, so he found an acorn and tossed it delicately against the window. When Anna peeked her face through her pink curtains, it took her a second to find Dean. But when their eyes met, she grinned.
“Sorry!” called out a voice. “He’s not supposed to get outside, but I guess with all the chaos and the door being open…” The voice belonged to a boy around Dean’s age, with a mess of dark hair and thick-rimmed glasses. The boy scooped the cat up into his arms, and the cat immediately started to snuggle into his arms and lick his hand. “Hi, I’m Castiel,” the boy said, looking up from the cat to Dean.
“Is this Dean Winchester?” The voice on the other end sounded vaguely familiar, though Dean couldn’t put his finger on it.
Dean couldn’t help but smile. Anna was the only other member of Cas’ family that Dean had met, and she reminded him a lot of Sammy. “Hey, Anna Banana, is Cas home?”
Cas seemed to feel better, and Dean was relieved. He had a difficult time shaking that feeling he’d gotten when he saw Cas’ face across the creek.
“Dean, you’re about to get smacked if you don’t shut up and drive,”  Sam spat, narrowing his eyes. Dean laughed and pulled out of the parking lot, taking them all home.
“Look. I’ll give you time to process your feelings on your own. But in the meantime, I... I just can’t.”
Dean shook his head. “Nah,” he mumbled, turning to check the clock on his nightstand. 1:52 AM. “What are you doing up, baby?” Now that the door was closed, he could see a little better, and Cas looked terrified.
Cas let out an exaggerated sigh. “Come on, Winchester, get it together. I asked if you wanted to go swimming in the creek.”
It was the streaming sunlight that woke Dean up that morning. But the soft mess of hair just beneath his nose and the curled up hand on his chest were a sight to behold. Cas had tucked his face between Dean’s chin and chest and was out like a light.
The rest of the day was quick and fun, like any summer day should be. Dean felt an odd sort of sentimentality, for when he was a kid and summers felt like forever. He had a feeling the summers would only get shorter as he got older, and that made him sad.
