He thought about that night, that perfect night, weeks ago. That night so much like this one and yet so far away, with Perlman playing and John’s arms holding him close. It had been so wonderful. It still was. It seemed stupid to think so now, but Sherlock still knew – whatever else had happened since then – on that night at least, John had loved him. There was no burying that.
“And don’t let me catch you again, or I’ll put you both in detention,” John went on sternly as he passed by them. “You wouldn’t want another session mopping up the gym floors, would you, Alex?”
“Hi,” he muttered. His own voice sounded dull, lifeless. “How was the honeymoon?”
he was close, he was close, just a bit more…
John blinked; his brow was creased, his eyes boring into Sherlock’s, searching.
He nosed his way down the sparse hair on his chest, sending electricity shooting through the neurons at the sensitive follicles, and then kissed at one of his nipples, lapping gently, coaxing it into a hard nub. Sherlock writhed and gasped above him, his arm coming up to cradle John’s head against his chest, urging him onward with his touch.
“Um…” He sputtered stupidly, shuffling papers around in his embarrassment. “If we, uh.” He cleared his throat.
That had gone well, hadn’t it? Sherlock wanted to talk to him, wanted to know what he thought of his work…
The woman’s jaw dropped. “Oh,” she said, sounding awed.
“I guess it works as a love nest after all,” John muttered.
“Hmm,” Sherlock murmured, hardly listening, his eyes still locked with John’s. “Shouldn’t you be off to breakfast, George?”
“Come on, you old dandy,” John chuckled, pushing Sherlock forward. Sherlock gave an exaggerated huff of annoyance, but obeyed. They still had their massive list to get through, after all.
tell her when we go over there on Christmas Eve. We’ll need something to liven the night up, after all.”
Sherlock shook his head. “I got some terrible news today.”
John gave another gentle sigh, and a faint kiss to Sherlock’s temple.
She was craning her neck forward, looking excited. “You’re not who I think you are, are you?”
love…” John whimpered.
“Sentiment,” John agreed.
John offered one of his own, and pulled Sherlock close enough so that their noses brushed. “I don’t ever want you to hide from me.”
“They’re all of me,” he murmured.
Over near the far wall, next to a retro-style jukebox, another girl turned around. She was blonde and pale, wearing a fur wrap, and just as beautiful as Stacey.
“That was the Christmas effort from the once great Sherlock Holmes. Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen! I can safely put my hand up my arse and say that is the
For some reason, concern about the President’s upcoming visit seemed to be the main thread of conversation at Downing Street as the weeks wore on. Sherlock couldn’t understand why for the life of him. It wasn’t as if he’d have to deal with that
He pulled him in, and gave a fond little chuckle as Sam burst into giggles.
Sherlock huffed out the barest breath of a laugh.
He’d never stuck his own foot in his mouth that hard before.
And then, with just the barest shift his eyes, Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him.
He knew who they were talking about – one of the new boy bands whose pictures Sherlock had seen lining the lockers of some of the kids in his class. They’d only been around for a year or so, but still people couldn’t stop talking about how
And there was something about it – about the gentle ray of happiness shining out of him – that made John’s heart lurch in his chest. It was more powerful than anything he’d ever felt.
Sherlock stared down at the picture, hardly daring to hope, to realize.
The wedding really was lovely. Stamford had been delighted to see John again, and he looked quite good even with the weight he’d put on. John hurried back along the street after the pictures were over, keen to tell Mary all about the surprise live band Mike had arranged for his new wife – at the end of the service when audience members had popped out of their seats with instruments to play along to “All You Need is Love”.
Sherlock’s words were so quiet, he wasn’t even sure John had heard them.
, John could feel within him that this was a bad idea, but there was no way he was going to turn it down now. Just like this morning, just like last night, there was no part of him that was prepared to refuse whatever he could get.
He held the cards against his chest, blank side facing outward. They were too big to carry without some awkwardness, but they were ready. He held the CD player with his other hand, ready to go as well. As far as he could tell, the plan would go off smoothly, as long as Mary didn’t answer the door.
“It’s snowing a bit,” he said, with a note of suppressed excitement. “Come look.”
The worry in John’s expression melted away, and was replaced by a tenderness so profound that it seemed to push all the air out of Sherlock’s lungs. John’s subtle smile was fond and understanding, and he gave Sherlock’s hand a reassuring squeeze and rubbed his thumb soothingly over the back of Sherlock’s palm.
“Sherlock…” John’s voice was dark and husky with desire.
been able to refuse John’s request, so joyfully, obliviously delivered, he’d only have to fend off his questions. And, sooner or later, he’d have to give in. He’d have to either show him, or tell him why he couldn’t.
John hurried back around the corner to where Sherlock was standing, looking a bit startled.
“For God’s sake, would you stop fussing about?” Sherlock asked him, on an unusually sunny Saturday afternoon.  “You’d think the Christmas holidays would let you relax just a little.”
He gave him a little nod, then stepped aside, his hand on Sam’s shoulders as he guided him towards the door. Behind them, a second or two of silence, before John heard Sherlock’s footsteps fading away back towards the theatre.
give us a break, apparently”, but they only seemed to buoy up his good mood, and he deliberately passed by her on his way back and gave her a cheeky smile, which made her shut up quite quickly.
and how
The second window creaked as he pushed it open. It was a fairly old place, rustic in its design and hardly updated, in order to preserve its nostalgic air. The walls were faded brick, with clay shingles on the roof, and the interior was full of handmade oak furniture, probably crafted from the trees outside. The old woven carpets and sunken armchairs had a layer of dust covering them, and John hoped the warm breeze would clear it out a little, air out the musty feeling of being shut up too long.
The screen went black, and the silence in the flat was absolute.
one final thing I think we should look at, something very close to my heart.”
He heard Sherlock shift a little on the mattress. “It’s alright,” came his soft reply.
“Very satisfactory indeed,” Magnussen replied.
husband.
The music pulled the tears out of him, dripping down his chin, and he let them fall.
“Please, love.” He made no effort to keep the roughness out of his voice – that earnest plea he’d been dying to let out. “Please. Please don’t push me out.”
Sherlock dropped his bag near the door, beaming as he approached him.
“Make my wish come true,” John sang. “All I want for Christmas…”
It was already dark out. Getting in had been easy enough, but getting a flight
Sherlock’s hands were buried in his pockets, his body still. But he gave a miniscule huff of his own, and it made John look back up at him.
He rolled himself over, quickly as he dared without jostling the bed too much, and slipped out from under the sheets. His bare torso immediately began prickling with goosebumps - he moved swiftly, and scooped up the jumper hanging off the edge of the hamper. John's, discarded from last night, the soft merino wool one with the black and white stripes. Maybe Sherlock's favourite.
are for you.”
Sherlock’s coat fluttered slightly in the breeze. He was staring back, making no move to leave, looking so desperately wistful that John wished he could pull him close and wipe that look away.
“Is that okay?” Sherlock asked, grinning softly.
John didn’t feel himself being woken up, but suddenly he was. There was a low howl coming from the direction of the window, and the sound of tapping and rustling. John felt goosebumps break out all across his arms.
He huffed out a miniscule breath of laughter. “But you don’t have to.” John turned his face toward Sherlock’s neck, breathing him in. “I’m getting stronger every day, thanks to you.”
His eyes softened, and for the first time that night, his lips wavered.
Sherlock’s smile split wide as he let out a chortle. “You’d better not.”
“Go on then,” he said, doing up his belt and smiling. “I’ll shower and meet you down there in a few minutes.”
Sam’s eyes crinkled, and he sank back into the cushions, looking slightly dreamy. Maybe he was thinking about her. Hell, maybe he was even
The days leading up to Christmas were drizzly and gloomy. Sherlock took to spending evenings in the biggest sitting rooms downstairs, the curtains on the huge windows pulled wide on the off chance that the tiniest bit of light might find its way through. It never did, and the incessant rain battering itself against the glass just made him sink further into melancholy. Fitting, really, he supposed. It wasn’t as if there was a way to stop it.
Sherlock’s face fell, slightly “Unless, you’d rather…”
Something had changed in his expression – the lines of his brow had turned hard, and his lips were pursed in a thin line.
“How’s Joanna?” He asked. It was probably the wrong thing to say, but he was grasping here.
“The innkeepers won’t go upstairs again for the rest of the morning,” he supplied in a quick, low breath.
Sherlock gasped out a humorless laugh. “But it was,” he said, so low he wasn’t sure Mycroft could hear him. “I let him go first.”
“This is Martha Hudson,” Mycroft said next, indicating the older woman next to Lestrade. She had a very sweet and motherly quality about her, and Sherlock liked her instantly.
, leave you.”
His cheeks were tinged an adorable shade of pink. Sherlock laid a hand over John’s where it clutched at the box, then bent low for another kiss.
“I do.” Sherlock nodded. His hands were settled on John’s shoulders, a firm and comforting grip. “But I also know that it’s worth it.”
“Just one second,” John repeated, a bit steadier this time. And to prove he meant it, he found Sherlock’s hand still clasped on his collar and pressed his keys into it.
John was staring, gape-mouthed. Mike looked elated.
(See the end of the chapter for
But the night wasn’t over. John hadn’t even made it all the way home when Sherlock called him. He was a bit frantic, but there was a current of excitement in his voice as he told John about the party that his mother had spontaneously decided to throw at her Wandsworth flat, and would John like to come along?
sweetheart,” John rasped out, his face buried in the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, his lips sticking to Sherlock’s damp skin. He held himself there, his mouth moving hot and wet, more of a sloppy lapping of lips and tongue than an actual kiss, but to Sherlock the feeling was as sweet, as passionate as any kiss could be, because John had simultaneously picked up his pace to thrust long and fast, rocking deeply, more deeply within Sherlock than ever and finally,
After what felt like eons, the cab finally –
There was a pink flush creeping up his long, beautiful neck. John had to tear his gaze away from it and fix it on Sherlock’s unsure eyes, because it was making him think decidedly
Mycroft laughed humourlessly. “Oh, I rather think you’ll be in right away, because I have done you a
“And now he’ll think I’m a massive twat if
“And you’re mine.” John breathed out. “You know you’re mine.”
“Well, give the painkillers a minute.” John hid his chuckle in another sip of his tea. “I’m fine, love. Really. How could I not be, when I’ve got you?”
“Mycroft called us.” Lestrade’s voice made an attempt to be comforting, but didn’t quite manage it. “He said to say he’d be here as soon as he could, and he’s sending a car for Mrs. Hudson.”
It had been quite the end-of-term concert. Sam’s girl, Joanna, had absolutely stolen the show – she had a voice far beyond what anyone expected to come out of an eleven-year-old, and had stunned everyone in the audience. She’d walked off from her wild applause with the rest of the band, and if Sam’s plan turned out right, he’d have told her how he felt soon afterwards. Hell, maybe John should just go wait outside for a while, and let the boy get a good snog in before he took him home.
“You’re on the road to disaster,” Sherlock said, lowly.
He said all this in one rush of breath, before he could lose his nerve. But he felt strangely light after he did. It felt…a bit of a relief, just to finally have someone else know.
23. “I’d better get back to work.”
“All Mary wants is one shot of us that isn’t bright turquoise.”
“Oh, God,
to call!”
A few hours later, he burst through the door of the tiny airport, into the freezing night.
The plane wasn’t full – apparently, very few people were keen to head to Milwaukee when it was ten degrees below. John stretched out in his aisle seat, enjoying the extra space.
“…reckon he’ll be traded by the end of the season, don’t you?” John was asking. But Mr. Sawyer was suddenly giving a strange jerk of his head. John blinked, then realized he was trying – and failing – to subtly indicate something behind John.
“Would you wait around to find out if it was
“Impatient,” Sherlock murmured back, a shadow of a smirk pulling at his lips.
When he pulled his eyes open, groggily, the sun had shifted to the other side of the sky.
“You left,” Sherlock said quietly, and he was hoping it didn’t sound prying or accusatory, because that wasn’t at all what he felt. He just needed to
John’s expression was suddenly filled with something like trepidation.
“Mmm, yeah, come on, Sherlock,” John whispered. He kissed blindly at Sherlock’s bottom lip, his mind whirling. “Come for me, let me feel you.”
“I’d like that,” John replied, finally.
call her. You just sit down and relax.” Lestrade’s voice was firm but his eyes were sympathetic. He gave Sherlock’s shoulder a squeeze and then moved off into the corner to find the number.
Lestrade looked over at him for a second, then gave a little shrug and drained his glass. Sherlock couldn’t look anywhere but straight ahead, at the little space that had cleared around the spot where his husband was dancing with a young, beautiful woman, who was staring at him with a sultry smile.
“Oh, God,” Sherlock groaned, quietly. “It’s the longest street in the world, and I have absolutely no idea.”
John stood there, blinking, barely noticing that his mouth was hanging open stupidly, or that people were still shuffling by them in either direction. The apparition in front of him had seemed, in that moment, to make everything else vanish.
“You almost died, John,” he whispered, evenly, but the fear running through it was palpable – there was no hiding it.
He felt Sherlock’s lips quirk up at the corner.
John’s heart thundered against his ribs. This was it. This was the moment, finally.
He pulled off his coat slowly, finally mustering up the courage to break the silence.
“You could never,
smaller, definitely
He pressed his palms to his forehead – everything ached, his head, his chest, every inch of him down to the tips of his fingers, numb from the cold. There was no stopping it. It was all going to pour out of him in a moment, and he’d just have to let it happen.
“No – please come,” he said, his smile wavering a bit now. “It’ll be great.”
“He’s going to burn down the restaurant!”
John gave him a small, playful shove.
“I love you too.” Sherlock’s eyes were shining brightly, his lips turned up ever so slightly into that small, soft smile that made John’s heart crack with emotion. He leaned in to kiss him again, slowly but just as profoundly, holding him close, so close, close enough that he could convey everything he was feeling in the sturdy press of his hands and the slow movement of his lips, and know without a doubt that Sherlock would understand.
It’s up to his chest now, sparkling silver, and John can feel his breath coming in deep sharp blasts, trying to push out his stone-cold lungs.
“Merry Christmas,” John echoed.
“– hell, she’s got people there for her all the
“This is our first really important test,” said Jeremy, to Sherlock’s right. “Let’s take a stand, and come out strong.”
Flashes of white teeth, shining blue eyes, laugh lines swam in front of his vision and flickered out before he could reach them. The front hallway at Baker Street, the ornate walls of Buckingham Palace, the darkened shadows behind brick buildings, the soft glow of their bedroom – they were everywhere, everywhere, and Sherlock couldn’t hold onto any one of them. And that laugh – that beautiful, joyous, resounding laugh echoed through them all, cruelly out of his reach, and for a moment Sherlock wondered if he’d ever truly remember what it sounded like, or if he’d have to settle for the crude approximation by a faceless resident in a white coat, and somehow be thankful for it.
Sherlock scanned him, looking absolutely lost, until comprehension washed over him, widening his eyes into stunned grey pools.
“You alright?”
Somehow, his London flat seemed quieter than the isolated countryside, even with all the bustle of the street just outside his window.
John gave a little chuckle, glancing at Sherlock over his shoulder. “You’ve stayed rather close, haven’t you?”
“Very good, sir,” the driver said, and set off.
“I think it’s
And then the second soloist stepped up, a confident stride and a shock of blond hair, its owner standing in front of the microphone looking completely at home there.
party, John.”
It had hit him after he’d rushed past John and his friends after class before he could be seen – he’d been shouted at by the teacher for arguing with her about the material again, and his face was still red with anger and embarrassment. He didn’t want that image to be probably the only memory John had of him.
“Are you sure?” The crease had reappeared between Sherlock’s eyes. “I can send Mrs. Hudson.”
disappointed,” Julie said again, placing her hand on the head of the young boy in front of her, presumably her son.
Oh, God, he was bollocksing this up. Sherlock was going to say no. John tried to backtrack.
was any word he had learned – and then another, younger man stepped out from the doorway at the end of the hall.
“Great, because I don’t really want to get the train back, so you don’t mind if I tag along, do you?”
Sherlock exhaled raggedly but no longer painfully. He nodded, and wiped again at the tears that wouldn’t stop falling. “Thank you, doctor.”
“John, you haven’t thought this through.”
“I’m not,” John said, nearly giggling.
“You will
Here he was, in a bar with the three most beautiful girls he’d ever seen, and all he wanted was for them to leave him alone. He couldn’t
Sherlock’s hand didn’t shake as it reached out and pressed down on John’s doorbell. In fact, he the nervousness he’d expected to feel had just sort of melted away on his way over.
“Uh, fine.” John’s reply sounded equally strained. “It was good of Mycroft to bring me in so quickly.”
By the way, I don't speak Portuguese, so I apologize in advance for whatever I've gotten wrong here. I've provided the English translations in the end notes, in the order that Sherlock says them (or you can just Google Translate as you read, if that's easier).
“I gave it to her tonight, when Harry was in the bathroom. You were still doing the washing-up. She gave it to her after we left, look – Harry sent me this a few minutes ago.”
He returned to the window, trying to calm his anticipation by gazing out over the city.
“I doubt it.” Sherlock smirked back; he settled his hands on John’s hips, softly tracing patterns with the pads of his fingers.
His voice struck up again, deep and gorgeous, as he started on the next section of his book. It was sort of a fun story, what with the evil witch and the strange creatures and the childlike wonder of a magical world, but it wouldn’t have been half as interesting in anyone else’s voice, wouldn’t have swept though him like a warm, glittering tide, filling him with the gentle flicker of sheltered bliss that he loved about this time of year.
John deepened the kiss even further, so intense now it could have blinded him. Sherlock’s hands roamed up his back, over his shoulders, up his neck to cradle his face. He began to pull back, gentling the kiss with softer, lighter ones, until John finally relaxed his hold on him a bit and allowed him to break off, just a little. Their noses brushed, their breath mingling – John’s lips still tingled with the contact.
“Come on, we’re horribly late,” he said with a brusque note in his voice. He stepped out to the very edge of the curb and flagged down a black cab.
A part of Sherlock knew that his anger at his brother was misplaced; even a man as powerful as Mycroft Holmes couldn’t dissolve Russia’s intolerant laws, at least not in the necessary time frame. Sherlock knew that even two men as clever and carefully deceptive as he and John would be taking a risk by coming here together. And yet Mycroft’s cool, immovable insistence in the face of his and John’s vitriolic protests had set his teeth on edge even as Sherlock had grudgingly accepted the case, under his brother’s repeated assurance that he would only need to be away for a couple days. But as the targeted Russian family unexpectedly went underground
One or two people laughed – harsh, mortified sounds that sliced through the silence.
But John was smiling at him, that sincere, genuine smile, and Sherlock knew how much he meant it. Every word.
Sherlock cast his eyes downward, his teeth worrying his bottom lip, clearly weighing the possibility in his mind. His fingers fiddled with the handle of his coffee mug, a tense gesture that John recognized immediately.
“It’s
“And that’s not you?”
the cutest!”
Moments ticked by, dragging on for hours, it seemed, until finally John heard the familiar footsteps coming down the stairs from inside. His heart stilled in his chest. The street behind him had gone quiet
“Yes, alright, bye now,” Sherlock said quickly and opened the door for him.
“Sherlock –
John’s eyes fell closed. He gave himself a moment – just one moment – to enjoy the remains of the feeling as they floated away, leaving him empty again.
“Husband,” Sherlock echoed, barely a murmur. “My husband.” His hands were nearly trembling where they cradled John’s face. “Oh,
this all was hitting him square in the chest all of a sudden.
every day.”
He couldn’t dial; his hands were shaking so much they could barely land on the screen. Lestrade stood up and gently took the phone from him before he could drop it.
“No!” he shouted in a whisper. He whirled around, scanning the other kids around him to make sure no one had seen.
Sherlock blinked, and then, to his surprise, a smile spread across his face like it hadn’t done in weeks.
“There was for Westley and Buttercup,” he said, quietly.
“Love you,” John murmured against him.
this was like heaven. His heart was soaring, his head mercifully light, and John’s entire body was flush against his, warm and sturdy and wanting and
John sighed and sank back down onto the pillow, rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling. A strange mix of relief and disappointment was clouding over his thoughts, collecting into something greyer than the soft yellow sunlight seemed to allow.
she got sick he became the biggest softie you’d ever seen.”
“Brilliant Sherlock,” he began, haltingly.
Sherlock blinked back the wetness in his eyes, exhaling unevenly.
I asked him if he was. He said, “Of course, John, why do you ask?” I told him his face was so blank it was hard to tell what he felt, and that he’d just seemed—passive. He thought about it for awhile. I left him alone. Later he came into the kitchen and put his arms around me, kissed me, and said he couldn’t explain, but that he was fine. Really fine. He asked me not to worry about him.
Hard to tell, sometimes.
On days when John works in the local surgery, Sherlock meets him there and they strike out, sometimes south over the downs towards the sea, and other times into the forest at the southeastern edge of the town—Beech and Hornbeam, dormouse and deer. Sherlock likes it there. Daily walks are part of his new regime—doctors’ orders—and if he’s honest, he likes them.
There’s so much they both have to lose, but sitting there in the neurologist's office, his hands clenched in his lap, John can only think of Sherlock, betrayed by his body. He turns to watch his partner in profile, searching his face to see how he bears the blow. Sherlock has aged, but he’s still striking and arch—serious and arrogant in a way that John knows isn’t as impervious as Sherlock would like people to think, and it pains John to see the bruised dignity in the way he holds himself steady, his fear and horror held firmly in check. John can see that it’s all vibrating under his skin, which has gone papery and white. John knows Sherlock will contain it and keep it down, but he feels his own fear and sadness bubbling up liquid in his chest, filling him and threatening to brim over. He doesn’t trust his own voice, so he takes Sherlock’s hand, wordlessly laces their fingers together and squeezes, his smile tight and falsely bright. He knows his eyes give him away, so he looks at his shoes, aware that he’s hiding nothing.
Sherlock froze, his hand hovering in midair. Magnussen was whispering something back, which he could only hear snatches of.
John’s expression was of aloof civility, not unlike Mycroft’s. But
He made a beeline for his office and found Mycroft in there, collecting some files from his desk. Perfect.
. He’d known it was going to be cold, but this was unlike anything he’d ever felt. The ground was completely covered in snow, including the road where the cabs were lined up. Just before him, on a little patch of grass which the cars were circling around, a sign displayed
“Will you–?” he began, but Sherlock had read his mind again and was already sitting down next to him, and with an arm wrapped around his shoulders pulled John in to rest against his side.
“Thank you.” Sherlock allowed himself to laugh, too. This really would be alright, he thought; anything would be alright, as long as he was still able to make John laugh.
“Here,” he huffed, holding out a folded piece of paper.
scrawled on it leaping out at him.
“Where is he?” Dad asked as they stepped out the door. Sherlock was already scanning the crowd.
“It’s alright, John, I don’t need to hear promises we both know you won’t keep.”
“Maybe an extra blanket, too,” Sherlock went on, eyeing the window that was slightly ajar and letting in a cool draft. He crossed the room briefly and shut it, then headed for the door again. “Can’t have you catching cold, now, can we?”
John looks up at him, tears falling silently from his dark eyes.
“No one else could have done better,” he consoled me, his fingers playing along the seam of my trousers at my hip. “But, did you talk to the neighbours?” he asked, “What were their opinions of Amberley and his young lover? What about the barkeep at the pub? Was Dr. Ernest the gay Lothario you’ve been led to believe? I would have thought, John, that you would at least have spoken to the barkeep. With your…” Sherlock cast his eyes down to my lap and then up into mine from under his lashes, “...natural advantages, I can imagine you whispering some soft nothings and getting some…” his hand stole into my lap to palm me through my trousers, “...hard somethings in return. You seem to have left quite a lot undone, John.”
His heart was all but vibrating against his ribs.
“It’s just him,” Sherlock gasped out. He reached into his pocket for a spare magazine and snapped it into the handle of his revolver. “His contact must have run off.”
They kissed softly, framed in the doorway of Baker Street, lips moving gently and tongues dipping in to explore – to discover each other, familiarity winding itself into the newness of it all, exhilaration flooding into John’s heart at the point where Sherlock’s was beating against his chest.
, and the fire of want was burning hotter inside him every minute.
Sherlock took his time, gradually moving lower. John’s shoulder sang out with relief, as the pressure melted away, carrying the tension with it. He hummed out his appreciation.
“Think they’ll be alright now?” John fell into step beside him, as they moved down the sidewalk, giving themselves some distance from the building and the surrounding officers.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, smirking. A large framed poster of the young, four-man group was standing beside him, as well as their recent platinum record, almost like a challenge. “I saw them on the show last week – they weren’t very nice about my record.”
“Alright,” John agreed, though his heart was sinking slightly. He turned back to Sherlock.
But when John seemed to nod at her, and then followed her out onto the dance floor, Sherlock felt the fiery rage flickering up his chest and into his throat suddenly turn into ice. The gallery, he thought, must really be at the top of a building in a powerful wind, or at the bottom of the freezing river, because surely that could be the only reason all the breath had drained from his lungs, why the air around him seemed to bite into his skin like an impermeable frost?
“Alright,” he said, a little too sharply, and they all cheered.
“So what do you say?” John asked, feeling a smaller, watery smile stretch across his lips. He searched Sherlock’s gaze, bright and beautiful and infinite. “Sherlock Holmes, will you marry me?”
John sighed, the warmth in his chest swelling up. He pressed his nose into Sherlock’s hair and closed his eyes, breathed him in.
And for some reason, it made it hurt even more.
Then silence again –
“I thought you were at Elton John’s?”
Sherlock’s hands circled back to his shoulders. They were warm, and soft.
“Make sure you eat something. And drink lots of fluids, so that –”
Sherlock couldn’t explain why his heart felt like it was sinking slightly in his chest as he sat down on the bench next to John, still facing away.
This time, John wasn’t letting go.
So much of what he was feeling was reflected back in John’s eyes, and Sherlock didn’t quite know how to express it.
Sherlock gave a soft snuffle of quiet laughter. “Next time I’ll get us home in time,” he murmured, gently.
“Come on, get a grip,” he murmured sourly as he straightened back up. “You’re the Prime Minister, for God’s sake.”
He was tall, with a high brow line like Sherlock’s, but there was a haughty air in his face and his hair lay flat.
Sherlock was almost laughing now, swimming towards John and snagging papers as he went. “Que tipo de idiota não copia?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched up “No. Mycroft knows of at least three others. But with Sokolov down, they’ll all be vulnerable. Worried for their safety. They’ll change their patterns, try and avoid the mistakes that Sokolov made. They’ll get reckless. Some of their activities will necessarily bring them out into the open. And now the police know how to recognize the signs, they should have no problem sussing out at least a few of their seconds- and thirds-in-command. Get them under control again.”
away altogether.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Sherlock said, and he meant it. He smiled up at John as he took a sip from his mug, and was rewarded with John returning it in that brilliant, familiar way.
“You love me.” Sherlock cut across him in a whisper. It was a question and not a question all at once. Could this really be real? Could John really –
John tried to speak, but no sound left his lips, so he clung tighter onto Sherlock’s back and let himself be held – let himself be filled, completed, protected by his husband, knowing always that Sherlock would give him what he needed.
now, desperate soft sounds escaping from his throat as he arched into Sherlock’s fingers.
“I am here to ask your son,” he said, stumbling over a few consonants, “for his hands in marriage.”
Sherlock sucked in a small gasp. John’s eyes were wet with tears.
“Let’s go,” Sherlock cut across him. He held open the door for John to climb in first. “They’re waiting for us.”
A sudden prickling sensation crept up behind John’s eyes. His throat was blocked.
“You are.” Sherlock bit his lip, suppressing a wide, relieved grin. John wanted to kiss it out of him, pull it to the surface.
“Your turn,” he breathed out.
Their eyes locked, and for a second time seemed to stand still. John’s eyes were seeing him,
Sherlock spun around and let out a heavy sigh, feeling the tiniest bit lighter.
“What do you need?” he asked, softly.
“Yeah.” He risked a glance at him out of the corner of his eye, looking away before Sherlock could look back.
“Listen,” John said, haltingly. “I –”
John quickly rearranged his face into a warm smile as he set the bags down on the floor and stepped towards him.
Despite the tender swelling in his heart at John’s earnest promise, Sherlock couldn’t suppress the smirk that tugged at the corners of his mouth. “Good,” he said warmly against John’s chest. “Maybe we can do this again in Kiev, or Bucharest. I think Mycroft has a few leads there.”
“Yeah, not always the case, is it?” John had crossed his arms over his chest now, unsure of what to do with them. “I was um, standing in for Chris Pine once, on
“Mmm, Sherlock…” John panted. His entire body was burning with feeling.
The details didn’t matter. Anything that happened now was secondary to the fact that John was alright, that John was stable, that John was
Sherlock chuckled in surprise. “I don’t know many people who would say that.”
John’s reply died in his throat. He didn’t
Sherlock tried to laugh, but it was so sudden and harsh that it sounded more like a sob. More tears were slipping out from underneath his screwed-up eyes, so overwhelmed with this respite, with this reaffirmation, with knowing that things were going to be alright after all – it was all so much for his fragile, newly-restored heart.
John smiled softly, apologetically. “Sorry, love. I wasn’t trying to.”
“Sir, please try to-”
touches. His spine tingled with an ever-climbing tide of arousal, Sherlock’s fingers sending hot sparks out along his every nerve.
Sherlock stared down at his mug. He hadn’t properly eaten in a long while, but the thought of food now made his insides churn. He sipped at his coffee, trying not to wince as he forced it down.
After a moment, Sherlock broke off, then reached toward the drawer of the nightstand. Massage oil wouldn’t do now, lube was needed, and John had just a moment to catch his breath while Sherlock slicked his fingers.
Waves of confusion, of desire and caution crashed against each other in his mind. He felt disoriented and lost. How the hell had this happened so quickly?
When he turned around, all four of them were on their feet, looking fearfully expectant. Molly was wringing her hands together in front of her chest, and even Mycroft betrayed his worry in the twitch of his brow.
Sherlock waved his driver away to wait in the car. Slowly, his eyes raked up and down number 102, from the garden path to the chimney and back again.
He crossed the floor over to her glass-panelled office, and she closed the door behind him. She had a look of mild amusement on her face.
The way he was speaking, so slow and deliberate, made Sherlock’s brow furrow with confusion.
“Not to worry, you know I’m a patient man. I’m happy to wait till tonight –”
“Don’t worry.” Sherlock turned around with a soft smile. His phone buzzed in his trouser pocket. “The Lestrades send their love, by the way.”
John let out a low giggle.
He counts the compressions with each of his own gasping breaths. One, two, three, up to thirty, and John’s still not breathing.
“It’s going to be a very good Christmas.”
He turned his head and peppered kisses all over his face, along his jaw, on his cheek, down to his chin. Soon Sherlock raised his head and kissed him full on, slowly, and deeply. All his tenderness and hazy contentment flowed from his mouth into John’s, then trailed down to the glowing embers of adoration in his chest.
“Can I drive you home?” he asked.
“I will always be here, John.” Sherlock’s voice cracked, and he buried it in a kiss. “I promise you – always.”
“Do.” Sherlock beamed back. “The SAS are absolutely charming. Ruthless trained killers, just a phone call away.”
But then they’d start chatting, light and comfortable together as if they’d known each other for years, and John’s will would falter and the request would die in his throat. It would all just seem too much all of a sudden. So impossible.
had a wonderful life, haven’t we?”
“My brilliant husband,” John was saying now. It was like listening to a voice he’d never heard before.
, no.” John was shaking his head almost frantically now, his lips trembling. “It was for Harry.”
John could see that the sparkle from a moment before had left his eyes.
“Thank you,” he said quietly. His eyes were cast down a little as he took the phone back, and – was it John’s imagination, or was there a twinge of pink tinting his cheeks?
He tugged lightly at Sherlock’s grip, and Sherlock stood up without hesitation. John shifted over and pulled Sherlock to lay down next to him on the bed, Sherlock guiding him gently so as not to put pressure on the wound. Sherlock settled himself on the pillow, tears flowing freely from his eyes that never left John’s gaze; he kept the fingers of one hand laced with John’s and reached up to cradle his face with the other, anchoring himself with a soft touch, holding onto that contact which was tangible, evidential proof that John was still here.
“Can’t imagine why,” Sherlock smirked. “This is a proper love nest.”
Sherlock nodded, then added “Yes,” when he realized that Mycroft couldn’t see him. “I don’t – they won’t let me –” He cleared his throat, painfully. “That is, I’m waiting for news.”
He heard Sherlock hum contentedly above him. “You feel incredible, John.”
” Dad exclaimed spreading his arms and punctuating his words with enthusiastic gestures. Sherlock felt his heart kick up in his chest. This could
John didn’t intend for it to happen. He
He shook his head forcefully.
“Yes?”
“Oh, Sherlock,” John murmured into it. “God, you feel so good.”
Time seemed to grind to a halt as he stood there, bathed in sunlight, his back muscles rippling, his strong arms stretching out. John’s eyes travelled slowly up that long neck, to the errant curl at his nape, to his crown of black hair catching each beam of light. His face was set with determination, his perfect lips quirked up, his eyes reflecting back the green and gold pond and making it shine brighter. More magnificent.
“Well, I’ll do my best to schedule one,” Lestrade chuckled in reply. “Hard to get them to work with you sometimes though, these murderers.”
All your comments are very much appreciated :)
“You’re sure about this?” he said to John.
all the time; it was as if every part of his body was trying to distract him with pain, preventing him from figuring out what to do.
John’s heart was beating harder than it ever had before.
Sherlock’s mouth opened under his without hesitation, and he pulled him in tighter by his shoulders. He angled his face, inviting John in deeper; and John clung onto him fast, sinking into him, swaying lightly with him on the spot as they slotted into each other, matching their rough edges and smoothing them out into something beautiful.
“It’s ‘Christmas is All Around’!”
John was gone.
“Er, yes, in fact, I am,” he said, casually, putting on his most genial smile. “Merry Christmas.”
It was over.
Sherlock couldn’t help it – he let out a deep, satisfied laugh.
“No,” he said, giving a bit of a nervous laugh. “Little scamps.”
“Hello?” His voice sounded raspy and heavy; he swallowed, and tried to imbue it with some levity. “Hi. Yes. How are you?”
She looked stunned, as she shook her head no.
“Ta,” John muttered, swallowing down a mouthful and reaching for it.
Sherlock gave him an amused smile, which reached his eyes and brightened his whole face. “Fair enough,” he said. “It’ll be worth it, though. I think you’ll like some of the holiday designs.”
All your comments are very much appreciated :)
His hands were sweaty where they were locked around Sherlock’s back, he realized dimly, and he had to dig his fingers in for purchase, but he wasn’t going to risk losing his hold, not when Sherlock’s thrusts were stroking the very centre of him, the sweet slide of his cock against John’s prostate sending him keening in his grip, every beautiful, unhurried movement of his hips flush against John’s body making his heart sing with warmth in his chest.
22. “Frightening?”
just want to make sure Sherlock was alright.
Then, he felt a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around again.
“Just – um,” John spluttered a bit over the words. This was all
Sherlock’s eyes crinkled with confusion at the overwrought lead-in from the next song, then closed entirely when the lyrics kicked in.
But the thought made a shock of horror shoot down into Sherlock’s already-churning stomach.
He ended the call before John had the chance to reply, and slouched against the seatback.
“She calls a lot.”
Still, the sudden proximity, the increased warmth emanating from Sherlock’s body, seemed to give John a burst of courage. Before it could fade from him, he made himself speak.
Sherlock had the sudden urge to laugh. If John only knew what those words sounded like to him. What this all
“Ah,” Sherlock said lowly. He remembered once, an unfortunate cab ride he had taken that way after leaving an impromptu meeting at Mycroft’s house. “Yes, that
“Mmm, go on.” Sherlock’s honeyed voice spilled over him like a sensual tide.
, there was a knock on the door that startled them both back to full consciousness, and then Sherlock was scrambling to gather up his clothes while John desperately searched for a pair of pants and a dressing gown.
“Oh, God, he’s in.” John blurted out.
Sherlock’s eyes fell closed again. “Mycroft…”
have expected.
“It’s my favourite time of day,” John said, no higher than a murmur. “Driving you.”
Dad finally took a deep breath, and looked sideways at him.
” He sang.
John paused in the doorway, then, with seemingly enormous effort, looked back.
“Mmm, great,” John replied with a smirk. He wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist and leaned into him, though not entirely because he needed the support. “Maybe we can talk her into a game of Cluedo – liven things up a bit.”
Two cups of tea melt away from the sitting room table.
He looked up to see that the window had swung open, and a harsh wind was coming through it. One of the trees outside was rapping its branches against the glass. John could hear the air
They cheered again, raised their glasses again. Sherlock hopped down from the table and several people patted him on the shoulder, some barking words of congratulations. He shook a few hands, smiled genially at a few others, then picked his way through them all as they started to mingle and celebrate amongst themselves, heading for the door.
told them that the DJ they’d picked was rubbish).
A bartender spotted John, and stepped over to him. “Can I help you?”
,” John gasped out. “Yeah – that’s it – oh, you’re amazing –”
Come follow me on
“Yes,” Sherlock said, pointing out the first reporter he saw raising his hand.
But the clock ticked mercilessly on, and she opened her mouth to speak.
“Nothing.” Sherlock turned away. “Let’s go.”
John stepped out of his jeans and followed Sherlock’s hands that guided him gently to lie down on the bed. Sherlock was kissing him again before John could even reach for him, climbing over and settling himself carefully on top on John, pressing their chests together and letting his weight settle down against him, surround him like he knew John needed. John’s hands wrapped around his back to pull him closer, closer still, and he opened his mouth under Sherlock’s to let him take whatever he needed, anything John had to give.
Sherlock smiled at him, cradling the mug in both his hands to warm them.
Sherlock nuzzled into John’s neck again. John could feel his low sigh of contentment against his jaw.
Sherlock blinked, looking almost somber. “Boa noite, John.”
Sherlock nestled back into John’s chest, and John reached down and drew the blankets up over them. Sherlock sighed contentedly, John’s arms holding him close, his breath warm and comforting against Sherlock’s cheek. They drifted off to sleep, feeling whole and peaceful, the city lights shining radiantly up through the darkness outside the window.
Sherlock smiled softly, trying to convey everything through the simple quirk of his lips; his gratitude toward John for coming, his happiness at their working together again, how much he’d missed him these past two weeks, along with all the words he’d been dying to say to him during their time apart, but hadn’t had the opportunity for.
, of loving and holding and kissing Sherlock Holmes, was his, and his forever.
John’s heart burst open in triumph.
“Yes, fine,” Sherlock said, sounding supremely unbothered. John relaxed a bit.
The day came. Sherlock came with John as far as the airport, where John would return the car, and Sherlock would get the train the rest of the way.
“So that’s a no, then?” she asked, facetiously.
There was silence, just for a second. A heartbeat. And then, like a rubber band pulled taut and snapped, they surged toward each other.
“You’re sure it’ll be alright?” He whispered, and his voice was so deep and rich it felt like liquid fire pooling in John’s chest.
“I’m sorry,” he said, following her with his eyes as she moved towards her desk and pulled out two chairs. “I just got held up this morning, it won’t happen again.”
“And I think you might be the man that I really –”
“John…” he gasped out.
He could almost see Sherlock pursing his lips above him. “But it still hurts.” It was only barely a question.
“Ah, how kind of you to do me the honour of answering.”
Sherlock’s hands curled around his cheeks, warm and solid. He was smiling a little, an unsure quirk of joy that bloomed into the kiss, blossoming bright in John’s chest.
“Come on,” John gasped out, still grinning. “We can watch from backstage.”
Sherlock stopped, mid-sentence. His mouth hung open, unable to form more words.
Sherlock brushed the hair away from John’s temple, stroking along his skin, warm and real and living.
There was silence for a few moments while the AD went back to check the cameras. John sniffed a bit, continued his thrusting. Sherlock was staring off to the side, his eyes glazed over with boredom and fatigue.
John stared after him, lips hanging open and trembling, and he watched Sherlock walk away. His coat billowed out behind him, his footfalls echoing on the pavement, and he gave a little shake of his head but didn’t look back.
He turned around to slip back under the covers – in his hurry, though, the mattress dipped a bit too roughly as he lowered himself back onto it.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, gathering every ounce of courage he had, and smiled.
“What?” came Sherlock’s voice, finally.
“Yep,” he answered brightly. “Solid gold shit, maestro!”
“Harry,” Sherlock choked out, his voice low and hoarse. “I should call Harry.”
“Well.” The doctor closed the file now. “I’d like to run a couple more tests just to make sure, and I won’t say anything for certain until then, but –” he stood up, buttoning his coat, “– I think we can safely expect to see you around for next Christmas, at least.”
“Excuse me, Sherlock.” The assistant director came out from behind the camera, gesturing towards them. “If you could lean down over him, please, and stay a bit to the left?”
John stood facing the altar, staring straight ahead. His vest and tailcoat looked stunning on him. Not that he needed the help. Sherlock was standing next him, his suit identical, staring in the same direction, trying not to look at how John’s hair caught the light shining through the stained-glass window.
John’s heart felt like lead in his chest, as he reached his hand out to curl over Sherlock’s.
“I mean, the dog, Dr. Frankland, the bloody minefield…” Lestrade’s arms were crossed in front of his chest as he rambled on, oblivious. “Good job Anderson wasn’t here, his team would've had a field day out in that hollow.”
“I know.” Sherlock replied by tilting John’s head back for a soft kiss, then pulled off and kissed the corner of his mouth with a gentle smile.
“Great, excellent,” he sighed. He gave himself a moment to collect his thoughts, then turned around. “Thanks, Sarah.”
“This is really great,” he said in a rush. “Normally, I’m not so shy about these things, but – I don’t know, it just took me a while to get the courage up. So, thank you.”
“Let me go first.” His eyes were bright with adrenaline in the dim light of the alley. “He hasn’t seen me yet – I can surprise him.”
“Mmm. Well. Mostly I just love you.”
“I love you,” he murmured back.
He extended his hand. The motion felt wrong, cruelly inadequate. But Sherlock reached out and grasped it all the same.
John just smirked. “See you later,” he threw over his shoulder at Mia, who smiled that secretive smile again.
Sherlock drew in a quick, sharp gasp, like a drowning man.
“But – you –” John took a deep breath. then plowed straight on through. “You don’t fancy going for a Christmas drink, do you?”
“Sir, you
John laughed aloud, wincing only slightly at the pang it sent through his head. Sherlock joined him, his low chuckle ringing out in counterpoint to John's higher one.
“He’s the coolest boy in school, and everyone worships him because he’s heaven,” Sherlock finished, in a defeated tone.
He didn’t know why he was saying this, but it felt…strangely liberating, somehow. He could say whatever he wanted, really. The worst Sherlock could think of him was that he just loved the sound of his own voice too much.
“Thank you, sir,” John smirked. “I’ll think about it.”
“Merry Christmas,” Sherlock replied, softly, gazing down at him with fondness pouring out of him like the sun.
“And I just want you to know, it’s gonna be just the same as it was before.” John’s eyes were bright now, with something Sherlock couldn’t quite place. An invitation? A plea? Sherlock was afraid to guess, knowing his judgement was clouded.
“Cool!”
He’d reached out and taken hold of John’s jacket, just under the collar, and he leaned in and kissed him.
on the door. The driver got out and followed him.
John laid a quick, reassuring hand on his shoulder before opening the door and stepping out onto the pavement. He looked up at the flaking paint on the sign, as Sherlock drove off to the car park;
“John!” Sherlock called out. He pressed a hand to the glass, as if he could reach out.
“It’s the most prominent star in the sky, John, it doesn’t have to be seen make itself known.” Sherlock’s cheeks were slightly flushed with cold, but his hand was warm where it wrapped around John’s. “See the silver gleam on the bottom edges of that cloud? That’s its rays shining through.”
“You know perfectly well that’s not what I meant,” John replied, a hint of laughter underlying the sincerity in his voice.
“Why don’t you shut off your mobile phone,” Sarah went on, and paused for a second while John fumbled in his pocket to obey, “and tell me exactly how long you’ve been working here?”
The room was totally silent. Time seemed to have stopped.
. Thank you, Sherlock.”
“This man wants to marry him,” Mr. Holmes explained.
“You did,” he said, a little smile twisting his lips. “Didn’t you declare war on America or something?”
John knows what’s coming. He’s already shivering.
amount by allowing me to finish this all off quickly.”
“Good,” John said, and he released Sherlock’s arm. “Go on, then.”
“Heathrow,” he huffed as he slid into the backseat. “As fast as you can.”
” Sherlock rasped out. He wrenched open his eyes to search Molly’s unsure face. “Tell me about the children?”
, John thought, his confidence ebbing slightly. Time for a new approach.
“And…” Sherlock finally drummed up the courage to look John directly in the eyes. “I realized that…it might be that, the people I love, is, in fact –”
“Yes,
“I had to.” John tried to smile as he said it, but suddenly felt his lips wobbling a bit. “You were waiting for me.”
He moved forward, just a fraction of an inch, opening his mouth as if to say something, waiting for a cue –
Sherlock let out a long, heavy sigh. He’d stopped trembling, and his heartbeat was elevated, beating through him and echoing in John’s chest, but stable.
“Thanks…John.”
Sherlock stared at him a second longer, then nodded.
–” And John’s voice was breaking too, even as he stroked his hands down Sherlock’s back in a slow, soothing pattern. “I would
John reached around and covered Sherlock’s nipples with his hands. He started his little thrusting movements again.
Sherlock returned, bare-chested, and John stepped in behind him and took hold of his hips again. They held still, Sherlock leaning forward, and someone came by to mark their position.
Sherlock managed to nod, to blink open his eyes to see John looking down at him with pursed lips, concern worrying the crease of his forehead. Sherlock brushed a thumb over his eyebrow, wanting to smooth it away. “Yes,” he choked out. His heart was hammering; Sherlock was sure John could feel it against his chest. “Please, John, I need you, I need you
Sherlock stared down at him, his face completely blank. He looked like no emotion had touched his face since John had seen it last – not one line around his lips or across his forehead to betray anything behind those stone-set eyes.
A knock sounded at the door.
“Oh, good evening,” she said, straightening up. She seemed almost surprised to see somebody this late.
He took the final few steps forward, stopping just before the door through which John and his parents were about to disappear.
“Right, right, yes,” Sherlock raised his voice over a few more “hear, hear!”s that had risen up along the table. “I understand that, but I have decided…not to.”
“Yeah, well,” John smirked back. He gave a deep satisfying exhale, as Sherlock worked his thumbs into his shoulder blade. “It wasn’t a planned thing.”
He tugged off his jumper, and hopped gracelessly around as he tried to pull off his shoes.
“You should go back inside,” Sherlock breathed back. His head sagged a little on his shoulders. He didn’t bother to lift it. “Mary will be waiting.”
“Contrary to what you may believe, Sherlock, I am far from indifferent to the welfare of my brother-in-law.” Mycroft’s voice was terse. He picked out a splinter of wood and held it up to the light. “Nor am I prepared to sit in an office conducting an investigation when there is a much more significant crisis happening here.”
show!” He shouted, spreading his arms wide. “
“Hello, Sherlock.” John said, with a brief smile and a nod. Then he realized what he’d just said and his eyes widened. “I mean – sir” he stammered out.
The shrieking, synthesized solo kicked in, and Sherlock let go of the neck of the guitar that he didn’t look remotely like he was playing, turned around and dramatically swept the jacket off his shoulders. He paused for a moment, his bare back to the audience, letting the camera get in for a flattering close-up of his arse, then spun around and ripped off his tearaway trousers too.
It took a moment for him to take this in, and for his smile to fade slightly. “It’s Greg, sir.”
Mycroft dispensed with the pleasantries as usual. “You’ll be pleased to know that we have John’s assailant in our custody. He’ll be tried for attempted murder in addition to his several counts of treason.”
The bartender rolled his eyes, looking annoyed.
“You think love is a weakness.”
“We got what we came for,” Magnussen carried on, “and our special relationship is still very special.”
“I was embarrassed,” he said, nearly whispering now, too. “I didn’t know how much you’d seen, or what you would think…”
This was insane. Surely, if the concert idea had been ridiculous, then
He turned back to the dance floor, trying to ignore the way Janine’s eyes were still trained on his face, probably seeing what he’d been doing a very bad job of hiding all evening.
“You’re sure about this?” John’s eyebrows were raised tensely.
“I just want you for my own.” John pulled the microphone off the stand and swaggered over to centre stage. “More than you will ever know.”
don’t go in, too…”
He cast his eyes downward, at a complete loss.
Suddenly, John was pulled backwards by a hand on his shoulder, forcing him to break the kiss. His mind reeled, very put out at being interrupted, and he saw Sherlock’s father there beaming jovially at him.
“Please, John, please…” he whimpers.
Sherlock soon emerged with a steaming mug in one hand and a small plate of biscuits in the other; he smiled a bit shyly and set the biscuits on the table before pushing the mug into John’s hand. “Try to eat
His hands shaking a bit, John reached into the pocket of his coat and drew out a small, folded slip of paper, which he pressed into Sherlock’s hand.
,” Sarah said, and now she
He swiped his thumb over the head of Sherlock’s cock, and Sherlock gave a ragged gasp in response. John swirled precome over the tip, then twisted downward, slicking them both.
“For actually giving a real answer to a question. It doesn’t often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.”
John’s lips
7. “Sorry.”
“You really believe that?”
Sherlock replied with a kiss to John’s temple. His lips were warm, his heartbeat steady against John’s own, and his hands trembled only the slightest bit as they held John like they would never let him go.
John raised a tremulous hand, and rang the doorbell of 221B.
But John shook his head abruptly and smoothed his hands up Sherlock’s sides. “No, sod that. Let me hear you.” He bent low and kissed Sherlock’s chest with closed lips, right over his heart. “Please, I want to hear you.”
Sherlock took a deep breath, then turned away from Magnussen and back to the crowd.
John slipped off the dressing gown and obeyed. He settled down on the soft sheets, with his head resting on his hands. His naked body was laid bare before Sherlock, and it sent a thrill out through his every nerve. He couldn’t quite see, but he suspected Sherlock was taking a moment to stare at him, to take him all in, and it made him feel incredible.
His voice cracked; he swallowed it down. Dimly he could feel a warm tear sliding down his cheek.
“I’m sorry,” he said, nearly in a whisper. He shook his head, slowly. “I should have done something.”
“John, you’re a lonely, idiotic romantic,” he said, with a dismissive air. “Accept it.”
“I’ve been waiting so long for this.” John settled himself on top of Sherlock, his hands cupping Sherlock’s face, his leg slotting between Sherlock’s thighs. “God, has it really only been two weeks?”
John’s voice was bright and smiling. Sherlock had to shut his eyes underneath the weight of it, pressing down on his chest.
“Well, step aside, ladies,” she crooned. “This one’s on me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Give me one second?” he asked.
else, and came up with nothing. “Kensington,” he finally spat out, lamely.
“No, you’re right,” he said, quietly. “Total agony.”
Sherlock nodded vigorously. “Crime...Mistério…?”
Sherlock hesitated a moment longer, his eyes raking over him for a moment, and John fought the urge to duck his head in shame. Eventually Sherlock nodded once, his lips twitching up into an obviously hollow smile, and he swept out through the door, leaving John alone in the bedroom with an ache in his chest deeper than any knife could carve.
“Hey, Mr. Holmes,” Sam said. He had his drumsticks clutched in his hand.
about the way John was looking at him. It made it impossible to contain himself.
Deep, grasping, profoundly visceral. It was the time they had lost and everything that they had gained. Sherlock reached up to lay his hands on John’s cheeks, and John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back, holding on like a lifeline. They were both drowning, and Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever need to come up for air.
“There will never be a need,” Sherlock muttered along with Westley. The film was one of his favourites. Dad’s, too.
“Perfect, alright, keep that going!” The director was shouting out. The set was bustling today, all hands on deck to get everything done on time.
“Just a moment!”
Suddenly, movement seized him, and Sherlock was pushing the door open.
She side-eyed him, then picked it up and wrapped it around her neck, tossing the longest end around John’s shoulder.
It was the cold that made Sherlock realize he was awake. The clock read just after two in the morning, and the air in the bedroom was creeping into his body. He wasn't shivering, exactly – it was only a breezy, drizzly darkness outside the latched window – but it was the kind of cold that settled over him like a slow wave, where he only felt it once he curled in on it and realized he was carrying it in his fingers, in the section of his bare shoulder uncovered by the blankets.
Not two seconds after he’d hit the end button, and another call was coming through. He answered it. “Hello? ...Elton!”
They were swaying more and more deeply with every awful warbling line. Sherlock stared straight ahead at John.
Sherlock swallowed down a particularly powerful wave of desperate cries. John’s lips were starting to tremble.
“Oh, God, there better not be eels in here.” John suddenly froze, the very notion of it making him afraid to move.
In the grate, there were still a few embers left of the fire from earlier – just little fragments of warmth, of light, flickering gently in the stale air.
“No, I’m –” A pit of dread was swelling larger and larger in John’s stomach. He glanced guiltily at Sherlock, then looked away. “I’m not busy.”
“Goodnight,” John echoed.
They’d reached the intersection with the main road, and stopped walking, but stood facing each other for a while. Neither of them seemed able to tear their eyes away.
“Oi, don’t get too smug, you’re almost there yourself.” John let his eyes fall closed, an arm coming up to cover Sherlock’s, letting himself sink into the moment.
“Oh, God, sorry!” Molly backtracked with fervour. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to – sorry.” Sherlock could almost see her sputtering, panic-stricken, on her own artlessness.
Behind him, he could hear Sherlock moving at last, swinging his legs over to sit on the other side of the bed with his back to John.
“Hey, it’s alright, it’s alright,” John nearly whispered, his eyes shining bright. “Oh, come here.”
gorgeous girl – another blonde, but with shorter hair and blue earrings that dangled all the way down to the fur coat wrapped tightly around herself.
fine, but there was an edge of determination in his voice that John couldn’t argue with. Almost as if by saying it, Sherlock could make it true.
“Tell him that you love him.” Dad’s mouth was open slightly with surprise, as if this was the most obvious thing in the world.
Now John couldn’t look away again. He stared at Sherlock, who looked calmly back at him like he hadn’t just placed something so fragile in John’s hands and trusted him to take care of it.
A spark of adrenaline shot through every cell in John’s body.
” Sherlock exploded, spitting sharply as he whirled around to face them.
Sam blew a loud raspberry in his direction, and John’s shoulders relaxed.
“This is exactly what we were hoping for, Sherlock, thank you.”
a book – John turned it over – a dark brown, leather-bound volume, with embossed gold lettering emblazoned on the front:
Sherlock hummed, turning toward him with interest. “What have you been working on?” he asked.
of shoes and the squeak of gurney wheels dimly registered in his brain full seconds after their sources had rushed by in front of his eyes. The material of his chair was scratchy – odd, he didn’t remember sitting – and the cushion was understuffed, so that the wood frame dug into his thighs as he leaned forward heavily and folded his hands in front of his face.
“I’ll make sure we do,” Sherlock said back.
“You’re welcome,” he said. “Look, I’m so sorry about that day.”
Sherlock melted into the embrace with relief, wrapping his arms around John and holding him tightly. John cradled Sherlock’s face tenderly with one hand, wrapping the other around his shoulders and drawing him in, kissing with a fervour unmistakeable in adoration, in gratitude, in absolute
He sounded annoyed, and for a moment John faltered where he stood in the doorway. Sherlock had always been happy to have John stay in the spare bedroom before.
“I’m glad,” Sherlock said softly, taking the box back so John could hold the chain between his fingers, letting it fall through them, cold and glimmering in the dim light of the bedroom. John turned the case over in his hands, so overwhelmed with its beauty, so touched by the gesture that he didn’t dare speak. The case was magnificent, sturdy and untarnished, the decorative swirls sweeping around the sides like tiny silver vines. John fumbled with the clasp for a moment, opened it up to see the face of it and –
“– and that night meant
John was already out of his seat, walking a bit too quickly toward the inn.
“No, her alibi checked out.” Lestrade cut in. “She was out of the country.”
“Yeah, they are,” John grinned. “Don’t be modest, you’re wonderful.”
The next few houses gave him a few more elderly people. Then some teenagers who didn’t recognize him. Then one man who apparently hadn’t voted for him, and shouted some very rude things as he hurried away.
, making the murders exponentially more difficult to follow, and “a couple days” stretched on to a couple weeks, Sherlock’s resentment grew deeper and more irrational, his temper becoming shorter and shorter at every stiff interaction with his brother.
had flown out of his head. He needed to leave, and right now, before John saw – before he –
John made a noise low in his throat, somewhere between surprise and relief, and pulled Sherlock closer to him, one arm wrapped around his shoulders, the other snaking around his torso and fisting in the material of his shirt.
The crowd roared with appreciation as he stood there, stark naked but for his high silver boots and the skin-coloured pants the studio required him to wear behind the guitar, beaming up at them all. Maybe this was the stupidest, most ridiculous thing he’d ever done in a career of stupid, ridiculous things, but he didn’t care. In that moment, as he bent his legs suggestively and mimed strumming at the guitar, he felt young, and wild, and blissfully exhilarated.
“Sorry, sorry,” Sherlock said in an urgent whisper. “Are you alright?”
The question took a moment to register in Sherlock’s mind, and then his expression sobered. “No, not entirely.”
“It’s not like I can’t still help her, right?" he said weakly into the crook of Sherlock’s neck.
John stepped out of his office, straightened his back, and set off down the hallway. There was a bit of commotion around the corner where the older classes were, so he detoured in the direction of it, following the sound.
John was practically vibrating with insane, reckless energy. He’d been holding it back all morning, waiting for a moment to tell him.
him, and John had known.
John straightened up, and gave Sherlock that smile again.
before he drove himself out of his mind.
“Can I see him?” His eyes blinked away wetness as they flickered up to her kindly face.
“No, no, not that.” John said quickly. He smoothed his hand gently up Sherlock’s back, though he was unsure now if he was trying to comfort him or just get back that gentle closeness of a few moments ago. He wished he hadn’t said anything.
He’d been hoping at least to get some of the boring stuff done before turning in, but it really wasn’t looking very promising. His mind didn’t seem to be able to focus on any one thing, and he was spending most of his energy trying not to think about why that was.
“Don’t be. You’re recovering.” So gently John almost didn’t feel it, Sherlock pressed a kiss into John’s hair. “You need it.”
“You’ll see,” he said, simply. “I’ll come back with a throng of models with me. Then you won’t be laughing.”
“Them.” John jerked his head back toward the crime scene. “With bringing down the rest of the families. Sokolov and Orlova can’t have been the only major players.”
“Well, here’s one that says, ‘John and Mary’s Wedding’, do you think we might be on the right track?”
Sherlock had run back for him.
Jonathan sniggered again, then angled himself in his chair to peek out around Sherlock and look into the camera. “That’ll never make number one.”
Sherlock couldn’t look away. He wondered if his face looked exactly the same.
“Hey.” He moved out from underneath Sherlock as he spoke into it. He couldn’t look at him. “How are you doing?”
Sherlock stared back, lost for words again. What could he say to
Sherlock could hear the tears rising up in John’s voice, but he couldn’t open his eyes to see them. He could only pull him in for a deep, breathless kiss – a kiss so powerful it
“Well, basically you’re fucked, aren’t you?”
John sat, apparently paralyzed, staring at the blank telly, his mouth hanging slack.
“Better.” John breathed him in, stroking a thumb gently along one gorgeous cheekbone. “Much better.”
“Eu não quero me afogar com merda salvadora que minha avó poderia ter escrito.” Sherlock muttered.
Sighing, heavily, Lestrade got to his feet. “Mia, you can finish this for me, right?”
“John,” he said. His own voice sounded strangely distant to him.
Watching him as he worked, so precisely, so deliberately, made a pool of misery well up in his stomach. All he had to do was type out a few more pages, and then he’d leave. Sherlock would go back to Marseilles, and he’d never see him again, never have a proper conversation with him at all.
,” Sherlock corrected him with some bitterness. “And also the same Curtis who we just chased half a mile down the South Bank.”
of them together, of their love – comforted Sherlock, grounded him, slowly brought him back to himself, making him aware of their bodies, of the deep simmering heat pooled in his abdomen, of his aching cock lying pressed between them, of the line of John’s body pulled taut with careful restraint. All at once that need overpowered him again, flaring up in his chest like a match struck on tinder; John felt it too, Sherlock knew he did, and suddenly it was apparent that they had waited long enough. Sherlock slid a hand slowly downward, stroking sweetly down John’s back until it reached his arse and gripped shamelessly. John’s hips kicked forward, apparently involuntarily, sending a hot flame of pleasure licking its way up Sherlock’s spine and causing them both to break the kiss with a gasp.
“Perfect, thanks mate.” Lestrade grinned at them both, and then turned to climb the stairs after John. Sherlock followed them, his footfalls a bit heavy, and he caught John’s eye just for a moment as he turned over his shoulder with a doleful smile, just long enough to give him a curt nod and look back down at his feet. Maybe it was better this way after all.
But then his eyes snapped back to Sherlock who had run out onto the dock.
John’s hand was beginning to warm under his touch. Sherlock held his lips to it, suddenly unable to pull away. His eyes had fallen closed.
He scanned the faces, trying to see behind the crowd, but couldn’t make out anyone else, any familiar strand of hair or glint of an eye.
But those smiles, those little moments of sincerity came flashing through Sherlock’s mind like those godawful press cameras. His face came to him, over and over again, cheerful and grinning and with that pure unguarded humour that he’d so looked forward to seeing, every day. He had made his world so much brighter, his impossible job a little less daunting. He’d been so utterly
” John all but yelled. Sherlock had frozen with his shirt half-buttoned, eyes wide. “I mean, don’t worry, we’ll –
Every emotion in John’s brain seemed to flood to the surface in the same instant. He pressed his lips together, to prevent them from spilling out all at once.
Sherlock shut his eyes and grabbed the edge of a table for support.
“Yes, I agree.” Sherlock did his best to match the brightness in John’s eyes, and supposed he must have succeeded. “And besides, we were away.”
He gave her another little nod, and left. Maybe he’d better pop back in before the reception, just to check on her. She’d like that. Probably.
“Well, you’re not immortal, John.” Harry took a swig of her tea. “And just because Sherlock’s been looking after you doesn’t mean he can fix everything.”
“Um – alright,” John said awkwardly. “That’s done.”
This story is one of my personal favorites from the movie, and the one that may be most befitting of Sherlock and John: the one between Mark (Andrew Lincoln), Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor).
“Well, give them a quid and tell them to bugger off!” Mary shouted back. Sherlock heard some indiscriminate voices filtering though the walls. She’d turned on the telly. Perfect.
Sherlock shook his head, trying to rid himself of that possibility. No, he’d seen John’s face, he’d seen how desperate he’d been to get out of that room. He’d seen what Magnussen was like.
“Fine. Okay.” Sherlock twisted his face into something he hoped was acceptable. It felt like a grimace. “Absolutely.”
She closed the door behind her, and Sherlock sighed, letting it fill the silence. He looked down at the tray. She’d brought him the plain biscuits.
“Well,” Sherlock murmured back, casting his eyes down sheepishly. “You know what they say about fame breeding idiocy.”
They chuckled together. John felt a twinge of heat rising in his cheeks, and he cast his eyes downward, a little awkwardly.
Sherlock panted into the side of his neck as he caught his breath. His fingers curled around John’s, gently.
The thought sent a dreadful pang through Sherlock’s chest.
“Sweetheart, please, I need –
“Yes,” he said again, nodding once.
“You gave me everything I needed,” John said, his voice quiet, earnest. “Absolutely everything, and I’m so grateful, love.” The heavy weight of his words was settling slowly in his chest, pushing up against his lungs. “But what I need, right now…” he paused for just a moment, catching his breath, “…is for you to take me to bed.”
“Apparently he’s on his way to kill Sherlock!”
the tactless one.”
He was staring down at Sherlock’s desk. Then he cleared his throat, and shifted the files again.
“Assustador?” He asked, and gave a dramatic gasp.
John huffed out something between a laugh and a groan; the idea of Mycroft
Sherlock made a move to step closer, to finally close this interminable space, but at that precise moment a car horn sounded and pulled him out of his reverie.
“But…” he said, his words deliberate. “I will be very sorry to drive away from you.”
Sherlock turned around to see Dad watching him. He was grinning from ear to ear, letting out a low, gentle chuckle that was escaping him like he couldn’t contain it.
“Verusha Sokolov.” He extracted the file triumphantly and handed it off to John, who began poring over its contents. “Forty-seven years old, kingpin of the Sokolov family, and all but untouchable for the past ten years. The Sokolovs have storied and bloody history with the Orlovas, the family to which all the victims belonged.”
John sucked in a shuddering breath, his eyes stinging with sweat or tears as he tried to steel himself against the shaking. He felt as though he’d been wrung out, his body too light, his mind full of sharp static that trembled all along his skin and down toward his heart.
professional thoughts.
“Try to relax for me.” John lightly circled Sherlock’s entrance with a slicked finger. Sherlock sucked in a deep, shuddering breath and tried to acquiesce, but even those lightest of touches sent bolts of electricity streaking up his spine.
They collided with a kiss, deeper and more passionate than the first. John’s arms were wrapped tightly around Sherlock’s back before he was even aware of moving them, and one Sherlock’s hands was sliding up to John’s nape, the other firmly anchored around his waist. There was no preamble; Sherlock’s tongue plunged itself into John’s mouth, and John pulled him in, desperate and hungry, tasting him everywhere, feeling him like a burst of white hot flame. He was flooding in through John’s every pore, and John wanted to sink into this moment and never re-emerge. He wanted to get lost in Sherlock.
Sherlock pulled the blankets around himself, huddling into a tight ball. He kept his eyes on John's gently-smiling face as he cast his mind around. Was it worth it to step out into the chill to try turning up the heat? Or maybe – ah, yes. That would be perfect.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh yeah?” John beamed back, his breath catching a bit in his throat; snowflakes had settled in Sherlock’s hair, tiny pinpricks of light dotting those ebony curls. “And where would it have taken me?”
John pulled into the rental car park with a pit of misery in his chest so profound he thought it must be spilling out of him. His entire body felt like it was made of stone.
“Thank you, love,” he said softly, stretching up to kiss him, quick but gentle. Then he looked down at what was in his hand. “Well, what have we got here? Feels like a book…”
Slowly, he let out a shaky exhale and stood up on unsteady legs. Molly and Mrs. Hudson reached out to lay clumsy hands on his back as he steeled himself, one last futile attempt at comfort.
“I trust you,” said Sam.
“Or is it – something worse?” Dad asked, his face grim now. “Can you give me any clues at all?”
“É a parte mais triste do meu dia,” he replied, lowly. “deixando você.”
“You okay?”
“No, I haven’t worn it in a really long time.”
The Prime Minister’s office: wood-panelled, dignified, and comfortable, with ancient furnishings and paintings, and a beautiful stone fireplace on one end. The place every English politician dreamed of being every moment of their professional lives. The place Sherlock had been planning on non-stop for
Sam’s eyes were downcast, avoiding John. Avoiding everyone. John felt a pang that was more shame than grief, and the guilt that flooded in in its wake didn’t surprise him one bit.
He felt it too, then. Felt what had just struck John with the force of a high-speed train. It was indescribable – so intense he thought it might sweep him away before he even realized what it was.
“You’re not serious,” he said, sounding appalled. “Because of that thing about English girls?”
Sherlock seriously considered not answering it, but when had he ever been able to ignore John, even when it
*    *    *
“Mhm,” Sherlock hummed – a low rumble next to John’s ear. He wrapped his right arm around John’s chest, resting his hand on John’s left shoulder, close to their faces. As close to an embrace as he could get, from where he was standing.
“Right,” Sherlock nodded. God, this was awful. His entire body ached with a need to move toward John, to hold him, to feel his warm skin under his hands. He thought he’d been miserable before; he hadn’t counted on how unbearable it would be to have John right in front of him, within his reach, and not be able to touch him.
“Of course not,” Sherlock had smirked, and John had thumped his head against the back of the sofa, but he was smiling.
John nodded slowly, jaw set in a firm line: the subtlest indication to the experienced John-watcher of barely contained revulsion. “So she picks off her mark’s family, strikes fear into his heart, so he knows she’s coming for him and then…”
“Sherlock…” It was barely a sound.
, alright?”
The thing gathering in John’s throat was threatening to overwhelm him now, and he almost wanted to let it.
“Yes, except we’ve changed the word ‘love’ to ‘Christmas’”. Sherlock eyed Mike up and down, wondering if he needed to be on his guard with this one.
“Like
Sherlock turned to John with a beleaguered sort of look. “Excuse me,” he said.
Molly finished the story with a rapturous laugh, and a giggling Lestrade launched immediately into another. Sherlock took it in and smiled along in the appropriate places, letting himself be caught up in their enthusiasm as much as he was able while his mind was still struggling back to whatever was going on in that operating room, a steady eye on the infernal drag of hands over the clock face,
John swallowed painfully, and pulled back to look him square in the face, searching for some uncertainty, some doubt, some revulsion at this whole awful affair.
“I’m ready, Sherlock, please…” John moaned as Sherlock stroked over that spot again, setting his nerve endings alight. “Now, please…”
“Yeah.” John grinned a bit and opened his eyes, bringing the mug to his lips and sipping at the milky liquid. “Bit unfair though, me lazing around all day while you do all the work and worry about me.”
husband bought a necklace, and, come Christmas, gave it to somebody else…”
“You’re one to talk, you bloody gorgeous creature.” He crossed back over to the bed, his voice soft but with a hard edge of desire lurking just beneath the surface. He crawled back up over Sherlock and straddled his legs, his free hand reaching down to stroke over Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Do you have any idea what you’ve been doing to me all day?”
“Why…” He shook his head slowly, dazed. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
, and whatever wrecked expression was on his face made her retreat back into her chair.
Then, just off to his right, the drummer clacked his sticks together.
“Neither am I.”
His voice sounded hoarse. John turned to him as the door swung open.
“But what if that’s not enough?” His voice was quiet, but the depths of his worries rang out sharply through his words. “What if one day something happens that I can’t fix, or there’s a puzzle that I can’t solve?” His eyes shone as they bored into John’s with quiet melancholy.  “What if you need me and I fail you?”
“I’m fine,” he breathed. “Everything’s fine.”
Sherlock sat himself down on the floor in front of his chair, with surprisingly little difficulty. John grabbed the blanket that was slung over the back of it and sat down beside him, throwing it over both their legs.
,” he said. His arms were spread wider now, as if in supplication. “Sherlock, you’ve got nothing to lose, and you’ll always regret it if you don’t.”
They left him in a rush, and he watched the breathy cloud they created break across Sherlock’s lips.
John cut in, desperately. “But, Mycroft, surely –”
“– and I
Sherlock dipped his head to catch them with feather-light kisses. “Alright?”
John shook his head, an exasperated chuckle escaping him as he stood up. “I’ll just get it all ready, shall I?”
John’s heart sank. “Oh, Christ,” he sighed. He bowed his head, and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Not quite,” Sherlock said, and he was laughing now, too. “Almost, though.” The only reason they weren’t was because they were bent, hooked around John’s.
Another sob racked through Sherlock’s frame, and John wiped away his tears with his thumb.
“It was just really hard to pick it back up again after I’d stopped for so long,” he went on. He gestured half-heartedly out towards the space outside, the pond and the trees. “It’s easier here. It’s…inspiring, I guess.”
He watched him, beautiful and lithe and completely focused on his task at hand, apparently no room for anything else.
Sherlock chuckled, that deep, gorgeous, affectionate chuckle he had, that came from low in his chest. He pressed a kiss to the top of John’s head. John closed his eyes, savoring it.
And now Sherlock stood in the blinding, bleached-white hallway, alone.
Sherlock swallowed back another wave of tears, and let his entire body relax with a deep sigh.
The entire floor was, of course, swarming with Russian police officers.
“Not unless they decide to use the occasion to split up, no.”
“No, it’s fine,” John said. “I’m well shot of her.”
“Do you remember what happened?”
“Yeah.” John felt massively thrown off balance. But he’d put himself on the defensive, now, and he had to stick with it. “They’re…stuck up.”
“Isto é melhor ser bom.”
John smiled too – Sherlock’s arm was outstretched, and John leaned into him. He sighed again, feeling some of the weary rawness ebb away. Having Sherlock close to him was always a comfort. A blessed familiarity.
Harry glanced down at them, then looked back into his face, her eyebrows pinched. “What’s going on with you?”
“Best not.” Sherlock sent back from the kitchen, over the sound of running water. John sighed; he’d never thought he’d yearn for the days when Sherlock neglected the washing-up for weeks at a time.
Sherlock’s gaze darted back to him, eyes wide.
John smiled and crawled up Sherlock’s body to kiss the desperation from his lips. Sherlock tasted himself on John’s tongue, warm and salty, and the sensation pulled a deep rumbling groan from his throat. He reached down to pull John’s body flush with his own, pressing their chests together and aligning their cocks through the material of John’s trousers, eliciting a gasp from them both.
Sherlock’s mind had gone completely silent. He couldn’t think a single thing. How
John tried to savor it too, but even the little movements as Sherlock’s fingertip worked its way inside him were driving him mad. He wanted all of him,
Sherlock risked an unsure glance, found John pursing his lips nervously.
A few people walked off the floor, uninterested, but Sherlock didn’t move. His eyes fell upon John, with an embarrassed smile on his face. He ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair.
“Well,” he said, finally. “I just – wanted to say…” Something stuck in his throat. He had to swallow it down painfully before he continued. “…thank you for the Christmas card.”
go to England, Sherlock,” came Mycroft’s voice from John’s left. “Please, do me a favour – ow!”
“I don’t want a lot for Christmas, there’s just one thing I need…”
John burst into giggles above him, muffling his laughter against Sherlock’s hair. “Oh
“Too much detail, Clara,” John piped up, louder this time.
Sherlock sucked in a small breath, blinking at him.
, Sherlock. Look at me, can you see me? Can you feel me? I’m
But the room had fallen silent – or it might as well have. The crowd behind him was shushing each other, the diners had abandoned their food and were looking around in quiet awe.
Sherlock plunged his tongue greedily into John’s mouth, his hands sliding up John’s back to frame his face, holding him there to deepen the kiss into something desperate, something solid. John responded enthusiastically, licking his way into Sherlock’s mouth with visceral need. He crooked his fingers inside Sherlock, brushing up against that perfect spot, that bundle of nerves that sent Sherlock’s mind spinning out of control, that pulled a sharp cry from his throat and caused him to throw his head back, to grit his teeth against that flash of pure, unadulterated pleasure.
“I love
“Even if that’s the case, yes.”
He straightened up, and kept working down John’s back. It only took a few minutes for John to feel looser than he had all week. He sighed, contentedly, but the feeling of relaxation was fading to the back of his mind, now, the longer Sherlock’s hands were on him. The warmth of them, the skill of them, the way they were drawing up the heat inside him to the surface with every sweet, reverent touch. A different kind of tension was building up in his body.
John couldn’t bear how he was looking at him, with a mixture of shock, incomprehension, and hurt in his face. He had to move away.
“There was nothing you could have done,” he said. “And I’m fine, nothing happened, really. He just said some,” John’s face contorted strangely, for a second or two, “…things…”
The attendant looked a mixture of surprised and offended at this. “You can’t come in without a boarding pass.”
