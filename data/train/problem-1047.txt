His mind palace is packed full of little details of John in the morning. Of a sleeping John, a waking John, a smiling John, John, John, John.
The constant threat of even more personally degrading things.
Sherlock looks pensive and thinks over everything John has just said.
John picks up his tea and stares into it's murky depths. No help from the tea leaves for this. He's on his own.
He always texted.
John feels the familiar tightness in his chest as he continues to casually stare at his flatmate. The choking feeling that always comes with thoughts of Sherlock and how they are here together, but not actually
He can pick up his own coffee.
This seems to spring a small well in Sherlock. "You have?" he whispers.
"I've wanted to kiss you. But not just on the lips. I've wanted to share with you forehead kisses and nose kisses. And kisses on the back of your neck where that little patch of skin is exposed between your collar and hair when you're bent over your microscope."
"You wouldn't be here if this were real."
The beatings. The degrading things they said.
Sherlock's curiosity consumes him.
Mirrors.
, in his indignation, splutters, "Now wait just a minute. You don't know the first thing about Sherlock and I. You've only been her a few months, ok? We have a- a code, we stick to and the matter of my feelings, because Lord knows what Sherlock's are, are just personal, okay?"
John feels like his whole body is alive and every part of him is warm with fondness for the man in front of him.
He knows John has his heart and, true, John has said he doesn't need kids to be happy with him; that he loves Sherlock. But the thought eats away at him nonetheless because before they became a couple, kids were definitely part of John's ideal future.
Sherlock is already in bed, tucked up to his chin on the far side from the door.
"Why on earth would I be disappointed?"
Which leads him to today. He has nothing on and had assumed he and Sherlock might go out for a nice brunch, but his plans are dashed as Sherlock comes swanning out of his room an absolutely dark look on his face.
And that's a form of insanity isn't it?
grow the necessary equipment?
tucking tail. And now, with that thought, he can feel his ears flatten to his head.
Sherlock nods, "Some of it seems general. I am experiencing some of that."
For now, he revels in the fact that he's both a mother and father.
"Well. You know how cats have 9 lives? Well, I'm on number six. Five times I've watched you two meet up, fall in love and then freaking pussy foot around it, mutually pining to death. It. Is. Driving me. Nuts! And, quite frankly, I blame you."
It's what they say as the hold each other's gnarled hands and watch the sun set.
Found in his bed by his wife after she came home from a weeklong business trip. He had stopped answering her calls two days prior.
John leans back, but keeps one arm around Sherlock and brings his other hand up to cradle Sherlock's face. John looks straight into Sherlock's eyes, "I love you. I will tell you again and again as often as you need it and then once more just in case."
told everyone he was in a relationship, and with a man at that.
Sherlock continues to put away the groceries. "Yes. We were in the middle of our second watch as a matter of fact. She liked the Mickey one a lot as well as the whales. The butterfly one and the forest nymph one scared her a bit I think, but she didn't complain."
Soon John is taking pulls of milk from Sherlock's breast in time with the slide of Sherlock's cock in and out of him.
He tries to say John's name. Tries to tell him to go away, but his throat is tight and he can barely breathe.
"Are we in a relationship now?"
Stupid new body parts.
"That had more to do with you suddenly begging for me to fuck you then with you suddenly having quite lovely breasts. Quite honestly if you had begged me to have sex with you before the breasts I would've said yes."
He's happy to be proven wrong, though.
John just tries his hardest not to smile at Sherlock's ridiculousness.
What if...?
John and Sherlock get themselves inside and shed their coats.
- he'll be able to have John's child. He's not sure how he'll explain his sudden ability to conceive a child, but he's also not even sure this'll work so, whatever.
John had clearly made a mistake but his embarrassment had him doubling down. "Well! If you weren't always mooning at him and. And. It's not like you ever told me who he was! How should I've known? It's not like you have that much family resemblance."
"I'll make us tea."
They are rutting together hard now and Sherlock can feel his orgasm about to be imminent.
Rosie begins chatting about the food and the movies. John answers appropriately where necessary.  He's distracted though and can tell Sherlock knows he's distracted.
Sherlock's brow furrows and he tilts his head to the side slightly, assessing John. "You okay?"
"I'm sorry."
effect. I wanted to surprise you. Can you please stop ruining the moment?"
"Did you just propose to me?"
Sherlock feels like his whole body is being held with that touch. It makes breathing just a little bit easier.
come from?
It's quiet a moment as they all start their meals.
Sherlock feels his heart rate suddenly jackrabbit. Oh God, he's going to
Sherlock forces air and words out of his lungs again, "I have everything to be sorry for. Because of me you've lost everything you've ever loved. All I am is darkness in your life."
within your power to try and make me happy and all I kept doing was hurting you. So I did the only thing I could think of and left."
And John will never doubt Sherlock's ability to see him again.
"Be out in a minute!"
"Sure. Fine. Why not? Show me my past life then."
It's an electric shock to feel John's naked skin beneath his.
Oh, John.
They curl up, entwined together and fall asleep as John gently strokes Sherlock's back.
John smiles sadly. "There is. We won't remember any of the life we already lived. And if we can't love each other by the time you're 38, then we never meet again."
Sherlock looks over his shoulder and down his back where his tail responds by perking up off his bum slightly. A shiver runs down his frame. He can feel where the bed brushes against his tail, a foreign sensation, but not entirely unpleasant.
"It means RUN, SHERLOCK, RUN!"
like you for you."
What can he write? Their most recent case wasn't terribly exciting and the only other thing that occupies his thoughts is Sherlock.
"The fucking tail Sherlock."
John watches in fascination as a gentle blush graces Sherlock's cheeks and Sherlock looks away for a moment, clearly proud, but very much not wanting John to know it.
There will be no more nightmares.
"John. You heard Rosie. You have to kiss me. It's the rules." Sherlock smiles at John one of his truly happy eye wrinkling smiles.
"It was in our historical health class. You know, where you learn about ancient surgeries or whatever? Well, apparently this," John gives a wave of his hand to the whole of Sherlock's person, "is something that used to happen. It was still rare back then, but because of the closer living between animals and humans it did happen on occasion."
Which is how things are when Christmas finally rolls around. Sherlock had spent most of the month of December sulking and complaining that Christmas was a pointless holiday (Really, John knew he loved it because of all the fairy lights and baubles and whatnot. No, what he really disliked was that the number of violent crimes and murders went down and the incidences of petty theft and simple assault went up.)
John's face is unreadable. It's not pity. If Sherlock had to guess he'd say maybe sorrow?
Sherlock looks on as John's face turns a scarlet color. Fascinating.
And then Sherlock looks down to his mouth and then slowly back up to his eyes. And John must telegraph how open he would be to such a gesture, because Sherlock leans in.
They lie like this for a while, until their skin has cooled and their sweat has dried. Until Sherlock decides to break the silence.
Sherlock closes his magnifying glass sharply, stands and folds his arms under his breasts. "Are they a problem, inspector?"
Give me your mouth." Sherlock demands.
Sherlock orgasms.
A knock on the door and Mycroft enters before either can invite him in. John instinctively doesn't like the smarmy way Mycroft enters and sits in
The grey light of the day seems to come from everywhere at once. There are clouds hanging low, threatening rain. A heavy tension thickens the air. It's quiet save for a low humming off in the distance.
He doesn't know this man, but he knows with a bone deep certainty that his next question will cut him deep.
that he's somehow failing Rosie crushes John. Sherlock is perfect with Rosie and he says as much.
The humming grows louder to him as the adrenaline drains from his limbs, leaving him drained and drifting again.
Sherlock looked down at his breasts. "Looking like what?" He looked back up at John and cocked an eyebrow.
He can feel Sherlock's body pressed up behind his, a single lanky arm loosely draped over his waist. John gently strokes Sherlock's arm and hand. He traces the veins that pop up from Sherlock's thin hands. They're  big and strong and yet so delicate.
"I realised I wanted your love."
John rubs his hands together and turns up the heating. "Shall I get a fire going as well?"
He thinks to the mangled body of the man that started all this. His body found in his bedroom. Pods upon stalks bursting from his back.
"Oh yeah? Well I shall after dinner then. Thank you." John smiles at Rosie and then looks over to Sherlock who's still under the blanket on the couch. Sherlock gives John a small smile. John goes to return the smile, but is suddenly caught off guard by a small hand pushing his face back towards Rosie.
He wakes to the sound of the hall door opening and John setting his bag on the table.
Rosie puts on what John has begun determining her 'deductive face' because it looks so similar to the level of concentration Sherlock has on his when deducing.
"Don't know how she-"
Sherlock leans in towards John very slowly. He can feel John's very soft breathes as they hit his lips and then he feels John hold his breath and then he is kissing John. His lips meet John's slowly and chastely. The kiss only lasts a lifetime and then it's over. Sherlock pulls back slightly to focus on John's eyes. To see his face.
"You're being obtuse on purpose. You know I meant
It's at the Yard where John finally figures out what he's tasting when he eats food made by Sherlock.
In addition to his regular ears he now has cat ears with long, furry tassels on their tips.
John gives a huffed laugh, "Pretty sure that's my line." He reaches up to explore the planes of Sherlock's muscles. Sherlock leans down and they kiss again. Tongues gently sweeping into each other's mouths.
Sherlock unbuttons his shirt a couple more buttons and unclasps the front of his bra, letting his breasts fall free. "Please tell me how exactly I should have left these at home."
He feels something soft brush against his leg and startles. He's weak from whatever that pain was, but he still manages to scramble to a seated position up against the wall. He looks down between his legs and realises there is a long, black tail leading from his backside. He stares at it and it twitches. He feels the twitch. He realises it's a part of him.
Several hours and some liquor later, Sherlock had learned a few things about John Watson.
John gapes. Had Mrs. Hudson and Irene been talking? Or did the professors actually notice what a cretin John acted like at Hogwarts? John honestly can't decide which is more mortifying.
* * *
John is roaming around the dim café with a mop, slowly wiping up all the spills and messes from a busy day. The mop is mostly for show (he's not very good at manual cleaning yet - isn't that what cleaning charms are for?) A bubbly, bright song begins with a woman’s vocals and a brassy beat.
As rehearsed, John stalks Sherlock across the stage. Each step forward is matched by Sherlock’s step back. They’re never more than two inches apart, heat boiling between their bodies. During the music break, John spins Sherlock around in his arms and dances against him, the two of them simulating a shared dance in a club. The audience
begins to pound through the speakers, and the air thickens. The song is a blatant seduction, full of predatory imagery: it’s about a hunt, a primal, animalistic pursuit, and the anticipation of pleasure upon capture.
As the piece pulled to a finish, Sherlock put the violin down with tender care. “I need you here. We can forget about everything that just happened if you want. Chalk it up to adrenaline making us do stupid things. Nothing has to change.” He perched himself on the arm of his chair, “We weren’t thinking properly, it would be a shame for half an hour to ruin years worth of- whatever it is we had.”
“John, please.” Mycroft calls after him, his voice resonating through the empty streets.
. They wanted to sacrifice Sherlock to a fucking Elm tree.” He must look quite desperate right now to Greg.
“Hungover?”
Sherlock’s only response was one word and John felt him shudder underneath his demanding touches. “Couch.”
"Right. Something to drink?" Tea? No. John needed something stronger than that to cope with all the memories that floated around them. "There better be some brandy in here- You want?" Alcohol was probably not the wisest idea, but he really couldn't care less.
As the shadows disappeared one by one, Sherlock bowed his head to whisper into the doctor’s ear, "We need to get into the house. We need to find anything that has to do with the girl. Stay close."
"All he needs is for you to help him. Help us. You two can save the other girl. We can do that for you two," she dared to approach John now.
John was just simply -
,” Sherlock added as a subtle dig while sitting down, making one corner of John’s mouth tug up.
, you smirk and shuffle those luscious locks whenever I praise you for your brilliant deductions.” He saw the detective put a hand to his own cheek as if he tried to block out what was happening in front of him.
to look at.
Silence.
. Sherlock’s posh aftershave filled his nose and his hands roamed preposterously over his shoulders, arms, and chest. He tried to touch him back, but Sherlock captured his arms and pushed them against the wood behind him. So John found himself captured, trapped, and apparently, definitely, absolutely...Not. Straight.
Pushing his chair back, Sherlock stood up, smugness practically radiating off of him. “I think that’s all we need.” John knew that look. It meant ‘I was right. This will be good’, meaning that the tosser was probably going to expose a network of dangerous occult. Precisely what he needed to satisfy his cravings.
“Right. Sorry.” John meekly replied, decided against getting another sip from his drink. He cleared his throat and tried to maintain direct eye contact with his friend. “I didn’t want to offend you. I am having such a good time in, hell, a very long time.” He paused. What should he say now? “Thank you for having me.”
Sherlock remained seated, looking at him still with that infuriating deadpan expression. “ ‘It doesn’t have to matter’ Because it did not matter to you, right?” John groaned, swirling on his feet and advancing towards the door. He was moving so fast that his thoughts did not even have time to process his actions.
The place was small, far too small for two people to hide comfortably.
"It was inevitable,” Malina sighed. “I'm glad you came, dear doctor." She had the audacity to smile at him.
Right. Silence. He could do this. John had countless times before. But the thing was, John was not necessarily a silent man, especially not when one ought to be preparing for a stakeout. Sherlock, however, always retreated into his own mind to go over countless possibilities and microscopic details.
“Please let me carry you back before you bleed to death Shakespeare style.” He grabbed Sherlock’s right arm and threw it around his shoulders. Looking at Malina, he noticed that she was returning his gaze with grief in her eyes.
“Obviously.”
He ignores the shout of his name and starts walking to the tube station. The streets are almost deserted at this hour so he is alone in his flight, trying to keep ahead of the car following him.
John was being
him with his deep-set eyes. John felt his face flush under the intensity of his gaze, or it happened because the alcohol finally found its way through his system. "So," he sighed, "this is the first interesting case presented to you in what, three or four months?"
Sherlock looked at him with a deadpan expression and John felt his heart sink at Sherlock's words, and he knew it was showing on his face. He knew Sherlock could be such a coldhearted, rational bastard, but he had not expected it anymore after seeing and feeling him let go. What had he missed?
“Floor. Couch. Bed. Decide.
Putting his hands over his chin, Sherlock suddenly looked soberer than he did seconds ago, taking the last swig of his brandy before lying on his back and putting the cool glass to his cheek. “I’m going to leave you to figure out this next mystery.”
Probably burned flesh, given the picture John’d received earlier. His stomach churned at the memory of him being trapped underneath a large pile of burning wood, almost being fried to death if it hadn't been for Sherlock.
John snorted, “At least you enjoy filling out all the puzzles.” He noticed how easily they picked up from where they’d left all those years ago. Bickering over breakfast. Mary would have a field day if she could see them now.
He placed his feet between Sherlock’s legs and hooked it behind his left ankle. With a quick, hard pull, Sherlock staggered sideways, giving John room to take over. He pushed Sherlock against the wall next to the door, attacking the skin underneath his right ear in a desperate attempt to figure out what madness tasted like. “Tell me to stop and I will.”
. He did not know what was happening, but he felt Sherlock literally lose control underneath him. It felt exhilarating. It was extraordinary to witness that he, simple, plain, obvious John was able to reduce such an exceptional mind to such a primal state. Movements were desperate and forceful. Sherlock couldn't bite back whines and groans. Sweat clung to both their skin and, suddenly, the world and the sticky feeling of the sofa beneath him didn't really matter. It was them and this strange strange moment. No time nor room left for Sherlock to deduce, his internal dialogue had snapped from intense analysing to “
John shot the cuffs and watched Malina crawl away with her injured leg. She would not get far, anyway.
Sherlock and John in a church, trying to catch witches.
"I find it hard to believe that they might notice us, Sherlock, given the fact that we’re sitting here in this fucking shed, hiding between wood and used cannabis sticks." John’s temper was dangerously deteriorating. He noticed that all three figures moved towards the window, then stopped. The candles flickered briefly before another shadow appeared next to the group.  "I hate it that we do not know what the hell they're doing. For all we know, they are sacrificing somebody right now, severing and brewing hands."
“Apparently she was a prostitute. Or that was the theory anyway. No one actually identified who the skull belonged to.” Sherlock sounded like he was trying to appear sober by not slurring his words. John thought he wasn’t doing very well on that front as the words started to blur together in a haze. Running and mixing together.
John felt and saw Sherlock’s breathing hitch, aquamarine eyes searching his own in a doubtful haze. For a moment, Sherlock stood still before he moved to wrap his arms around John. “I’m sorry.”
When Malina came back, setting the tea down, John noted she used tea leaves instead of bags. He regarded the interesting texture suspiciously, not looking up when he heard Sherlock’s low baritone voice interrupt the silence. “What’s your relationship like with your son in law?”
"I'm so close-"
“Please, make yourself comfortable,” Malina shouted from the kitchen. John sat himself down in one of the big, fluffy, plastic-covered chairs at the dinner table, hearing Sherlock shuffle behind him. He also quickly found out that there was a fourth chihuahua hidden under there. “Sorry,” he muttered after hearing the animal shriek because John had hit it with the chair. “Oh, that’s alright, dear. Timbo likes to hide underneath that chair. He should know better by now.” He frowned again at that. Did the woman have eyes in her back? Taking a small intake of breath, John pursed his lips at the thought of how the hell they would begin to question a mother about her missing daughter’s hassling activities.
“But that’s what you’re doing, right? Good cop,” he nodded at Sherlock, “Bad Cop,” before glancing at John.
Sherlock knocked on the door and, at the same time, John saw a woman disappear behind the curtains upstairs. Faced with Sherlock's Belstaff and John's military stance, it crossed his mind that the poor woman probably thought the feds had arrived. Sure enough, when a small, red-headed woman with curly hair and heavy make-up opened the door, the first thing she said with frightful eyes was, "Is she dead?".
Ending the call, he looked again at Sherlock who was still lying on the sofa, brooding. "Well, thank heavens it isn't a weekday. I owe Molly so much already."
Small talk. Great. They were back there, dancing around the tension. John decided he needed more brandy so he generously poured them another glass if it were an automatic function of limbs. “Good. Mostly potty-training, handling tantrums, clearing away toys and forced feedings. Nothing new, I’d say,” he chuckled in his drink. He was getting drunk really really fast this way. “I heard Molly caught you on another rooftop a few months back.” He swallowed, averting his eyes. “Planning on disappearing again?” John turned the glass in his hand.
Without looking up, Sherlock deadpanned “Definitely. Just in the cupboards.”
, John-!"
, Sherlock, she was married. That’s even odder.”
John forced out a slightly irritated laugh at that, feeling somewhat offended at the thought Sherlock might think he wouldn’t dare to enter witch-territory.  "I am not so sure whether you would make a good impression of a gnome. Unfortunately." He nudged Sherlock, noticing the bastard was way hotter than John currently was.
As soon as arms wrapped themselves around him, John’s own came alive, hugging Sherlock back with force and hiding his face in the detective’s neck. “Me too. God, me too.” It truly was extraordinary how they always ended up like this. Extreme heights and extreme lows. And he knew he could not live without it.
“I know there’s often similar graffiti, but what caught my eye was how perfectly precise it was. Exact same typography- but the edges didn’t look harsh enough to suggest a stencil. Doesn’t seem like something a drunk teenager could do. Not to mention the placement. It’s down on the obelisk, the one to mark where they burnt witches. Normally quite busy.” Sherlock pulled up his phone, sliding it across the table. John squinted at the picture on the screen, silently cursing his older age for needing to bring the phone closer to his face in order to see it properly.
“Like this?” John moved his hand the way he liked it himself, using long, languid strokes that were alternated by quick, hurried ones. John thrusted his hips forward, desperate for some friction too. “Thought you would be way more talkative than this,” he smirked while biting his way from Sherlock’s neck to his mouth. He was going to give the man a hickey at this rate, marking him to know he was his. John was not going to last long if Sherlock kept looking like he was on fire, gasping for air, his pale skin flushed deliciously.
John was sitting on his knees beside the detective, peering into the dark and knowing he was going to regret being in this position tomorrow. Sherlock had chosen the exact spot because it gave them a perfect view of Selina’s house, the smallest one in the row. Nothing had happened for the past two hours and John felt the cold slowly seep and ingrain itself in his bones while the detective next to him appeared to be unaffected by the dire circumstances of the cold night.
all over again, but somehow, it felt more final now.
When Molly’s response came almost immediately too, John let out a small chuckle for not believing his own naivety. Knowing the detective’s thorough measures to get and maintain his devoted attention, John should not have been surprised that Molly was already on her way over to his apartment.
. He was safe.
. They knew we were coming.”
John knew Sherlock wanted to argue back and he was a bit surprised as the detective remained silent, undoing the ropes around his legs and standing up slowly.
"It has come to our understanding that your missing daughter, Felicity, was -
He grabbed Sherlock’s blouse and yanked him forward, turning him around and pushing him towards the couch. When Sherlock’s calves were touching the couch’s arm, he pushed again so that Sherlock fell with his back over the end. “Your favourite pose,” he commented before he jumped on the lanky figure, earning a small huff from the man underneath him. Bold and extremely turned on, John opened Sherlock’s trousers so that he could touch him underneath. John was uncomfortably hard by now and, by the feel of it, so was Sherlock, who was melting like butter under the secure control of John. It was more than a little concerning how much he seemed to enjoy this, thrusting his hips up a little, aching for friction. Patience, John surmised, definitely wasn’t Sherlock’s strong suit.
Best to keep the bastard waiting. Sherlock probably thought John was going to respond immediately at his every whim. He should realise by now that times had considerably changed.
Why was he even repeating himself? “Alright.” He rubbed his thighs, feeling himself sobering up. That was not a good sign, considering the situation he found himself in. He looked back at Sherlock, unsure of what to say or do next. “You want me to check for missing prostitutes?” Wait.
"Sherlock?" The detective was absorbed in his music, he could tell, but John also knew that he was listening with one ear, especially considering everything that had just transpired.
, John was going to embarrass himself very soon if he did not take back control of his body.
‘Meet me at the Chinese restaurant just opposite Baker Street at 6. SH’
The detective remained silent, not moving a muscle. He just stared blankly back at John before he picked up his phone again, blurting out randomly, “Right, so there must be some sort of driving reason this happened now. They seem quite ritualistic. There must be some significant date-”
Well, so much for not responding,
“The woman with the gun wound in her hip is, we believe, the instigator or ‘criminal mind’ behind all this shit.” Running his hands through his hair, John felt suddenly very tired. Exhausted.
“Yeah- Just. Whatever. That was-” his ineloquent train of words were cut off when a taxi stopped next to Sherlock’s raised hand.
The way the woman moved and sounded made all alarm bells go off in John’s brain.
It suddenly dawned on John, his face cracking a huge smile. He was experiencing true mirth and happiness at that point. He imagined that he started smiling like a lunatic, but, god, this man. He startled him by dropping a wet kiss on his mouth before he let his head fall on Sherlock's chest, chuckling. "O, God." He did not know what to say at that point and laughing was probably not the best response when one's lover was currently experiencing some sort of mental breakdown. But. Sherlock, who always felt so superior and so confident and sure of himself was... insecure.
“- He needs medical care,” John grunted towards the medics approaching him. “Abdominal stab wound on the left, not deep, but definitely not superficial either.” Handing Sherlock over to their care, he strode over to Greg.
Those deep-set eyes bored into John’s, holding his gaze in a blatant stare. “Mhm, but I thought I’d get you to come along so I seem less... well. I’m not sure I’d be exactly great at talking to people who pretend to be witches.”
When night fell, everything looked remarkably more eerie on the camp site. Scattered light was hard to find as it came only from a street lamp adjacent to the place. Now, the doctor and the detective had to find a place to hide, which was seemingly more difficult than they first thought it would be.
John knew what he meant by that. He'd seen the detective struggle through painstaking realisations that he was, in fact, human. A human who sometimes had to deal with losing control of the inevitable. He'd seen Sherlock broken at the loss of their friendship and at losing Mary. He'd seen Sherlock smash an empty coffin meant for the person who mattered to him. Who'd saved his life.
Unnerneath his arms, he felt Sherlock wince, probably due to his stab wound that was unromantically bleeding on the both of them. Unlike his composure, his voice sounded composed and determined. “I don’t want to forget what happened. I mean it. I don’t know what it means for us, but I’m okay with that.” Sherlock held him at arm's length for a moment, looking into the muddy colours of John’s eyes.
, he was already sold, completely intrigued, and Sherlock had probably already deduced John would eagerly sink his teeth into a case like this by the way he had held his menu or by some minor peculiar detail that was only obvious in hindsight. Clearing his throat and twitching in his seat, he continued, “What makes you think people are trying to re-create this type of murder?” John suddenly realised, “Are there new graffiti signs?”
John’s mundane routine was disturbed when he received a rather absurd text message during his lunch break at the clinic.
“Pink Floyd?” John snorted. “God, I’ve missed this.”
Sherlock exhaled rather loudly, opening his eyes and responding a bit harshly. “What’s there to go over?”
Desperately.
“Right.” He said again, looking back at Malina and shooting her in the hip, quickly swirling around to see the two ladies run away from him. He smiled as their naked bums disappeared from view. Lestrade would not know what he saw running out of the woods, walking straight into his arms. Smirking, he looked back at Sherlock who looked a little bit pissed off.
He felt Sherlock sit down next to him, the lingering booze flowing through his system still putting him slightly at ease- even though they found themselves in a situation where they had to talk honestly. It should’ve made John’s stomach churn and he tried desperately to think through what he would say next. To speak clearly for once without the foggy haze of self-inflicted repression.
“You Englishmen are fascinating ,” she breathed, regarding them as if she was seeing them for the first time.
, with his bloody coat turned up, looking entirely out of place in the shady, dimly-lit restaurant. When the bastard approached their table, John saw his smirk and dreaded the remarks that would follow about how desperate John must look to him. True, he was desperate, he would give him that. When Sherlock sat down in front of him, John realised he had been holding his breath since the moment his old friend had walked in.
Even if John wanted to be gentle with him, he did not think he could. Not this time. "Okay," was all he could quietly mutter in response. He too had done this before, just not with a man. But then again this was not just a man, this was Sherlock. "O. Fuck." The feeling was excruciatingly delicious. He'd always enjoyed this particular part with women, but with Sherlock, he felt even more powerful, more in control, more in sync with the feelings that were coursing through his mind and body. John knew there was a brief moment of pain as Sherlock’s face scrunched up before relaxing into the rhythmic movements. Their bodies now melted together in a way that made Sherlock roll his head back, soft moans were all his brain could handle. "Fuck-”
John regarded Sherlock for a moment, noticing the other’s still and contemplating posture, his eyes practically gleaming in the pitch dark night like a jaguar hunting its prey. What was Sherlock thinking? He had not moved even an inch, only ever slightly averting his attention to respond to John’s questions.
Sherlock nodded, hands gesturing vaguely as he spoke. “I didn’t touch it. It’s the only place that’s actually clean.”
Why a detective should never venture alone into the woods without a doctor.
Sherlock was the first to get out of the shed, and when John followed, he felt his whole body ache from the uncomfortable crouching. They crept around the small building, the soft pattering of feet and a rapidly increasing heart beat was all he could hear. When they approached the back of the house, Sherlock rummaged in his pockets to extract a paper clip. Rolling his eyes behind Sherlock’s back, John thought once again that the detective would’ve made a very effective criminal, which should probably be an unnerving thought for anyone associated with him.
. Although, in that exact moment, he couldn’t really come up with reasons as to why it was such a bad idea to snog his a-sexual best mate?
Boredom seeped into him. It always did. It was inevitable. Whenever he got bored he could practically hear the apartment begging him not to take his frustrations out on it. He sprawled out on the couch, as if he was posing, and squeezed his eyes closed.
. Smiling smugly, he sat back, crossing his hands in front of his body.
“Mmh. Definitely. Sex work is an infamously deadly industry - mostly because it is partly criminalised and they can’t get the assistance of security without it being an offence. Try to find something out about Felicity. Maybe this was premeditated for a while. If this is related- it may be too late for her.”
. The boy probably didn't even know what that tattoo meant. "Try to explain "association" to us, will you?" John knew he sounded like an irritated parent at this point. He did not know what it was, but this kid made the blood under his skin crawl.
.” It was just probability. They might not even see anything exciting. It’d be incredibly anticlimactic, for Sherlock standards.
“Cases are great for adrenaline. I can see why you’d miss it. Can’t imagine potty training has quite the same high as chasing serial killers.”
Looking up to Sherlock, John saw a pained expression on the detective’s sharp, catlike features. John knew empathy was something Sherlock had tried to forcibly turn off in his unbiased brain. For the detective, it made everything so much simpler when he was able to treat people like puzzle pieces. Unfortunately, John knew it was only good in theory and that the pretence of being a sociopath had long been abandoned in the aftermath of Sherrinford. Sherlock wasn’t as sociopathic as he liked to claim. It was just a wall he had to keep up to stop how intense everything seemed to be.
“Fuck, yes.”
“Stop. Fucking. Thinking.” Seriously, John was having the best post-coital bliss of his fucking life, but he felt Sherlock tensing underneath him. Like John’s high was Sherlock’s ‘post-coital tristesse’.
“Hell yes.” John stood abruptly then swaggered a little on his feet, his right leg throbbing tremendously. “You did mean right now. Didn’t you?”
The boy remained silent for a long time, alternating his stares between John and Sherlock. When he finally opened his mouth, quickly making eye-contact with Sherlock before averting his eyes, John was relieved. Maybe he did not have to play this the hard way.
Placing his hands under his chin, Sherlock focused his attention on John, ignoring his last remark. “Right. Who do we want to interrogate first? The husband sounds insufferable so I suggest we get that out of the way first.”
“So. It was originally theorised Bella was killed because of a ritual called hands of glory. Her hands were broken off. Hands of glory... originally they used the fat from the hands of criminals who had been hung to make candles. So. Maybe not Wiccan. More occultist.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Sherlock had begun to thrash harder against his binds, ignoring how the cold metal was digging into his flesh. John noticed Sherlock’s coat was soiled with blood and, although he couldn’t see the detective’s eyes, he knew they must be burning with an unmatched rage he hadn’t felt in some time.
“Fine fine- if you’re sharing a room with me I might actually have to tidy up for once.” Sherlock stood up, aching legs staggering across the room. He turned his head around towards the window when he heard a car pull up to the entrance of the street, leaving a few seconds later.
John knew from the look Sherlock was giving him that he was on the verge of saying something along the lines of ‘No, John, but I very much want you to stop being a fucking ass and just shoot her already’. Instead, he just shook his head and murmured,
"Y'OK?" John had lost all sense of eloquence right now. "Don't think, I-".
"Right, I'll order Thai."
“See,” he said, crunching down next to him, “they also have a lot of fat on their arses and they still chose to go for the hands.”
“Are you bleeding again?” John crouched in front of Sherlock on his knees, his hands exploring the bandage wrapped around his lower chest. After a second of inspection, John decided that it definitely needed redoing.
get to decide?" He let out a small laugh. "Who are you, and what have you done with Sherlock Holmes?" Seeing the man's eye twinkle, realisation dawned upon him. "Goddamn, you." He looked at how he was gripping Sherlock's arm and then quickly decided to drop it.
To no avail, however.
. That thought didn’t strike him as odd at all.
Sherlock remained silent as minutes passed, staring at the ceiling. John felt the body underneath him tense slightly, knowing Sherlock’s high was subsiding and his brain fog parting. He could practically feel the thoughts spiraling through the detective’s brain, the period of coming down off a tremendous high sinking him the lowest.
They way Sherlock’s chest is heaving betrays the hard, rhythmic pulsing of his heart, revealing that the screeching panic of it all only served to excite the detective more. This would wreck them. It was a guilty indulgence of it all that made it more perfect. John wondered if Sherlock could process all of it or if he was experiencing some sort of sensory overload.
Waiting in his clean, polished kitchen, watching his daughter eat, John felt nervousness build up in his lower belly, rising till it was fully running through his veins. The feeling never left his system when he kissed Rosie goodnight, said his thanks to Molly, got in the tube, and finally arrived at the restaurant at 5.56 pm. Sighing once again, he dragged his too eager body inside, hoping he’d be able to maintain some decorum for the rest of the evening.
” Or something like that. “Weird.” Trailing his eyes over the wall, John faltered when two familiar faces stared back at him from behind the remains of two old newspapers. The pictures were clearly taken from the print media more than three years ago and, to John’s vexed opinion, did not portray him well.
He didn’t dare figure out if that was platonic or romantic but it didn’t matter. He allowed himself to admit that. In the stillness of the moment, the calm before the storm, he realised he always had. He wanted to spend his life with the infuriating man. He had to. That’s the only way he could picture his future.
“Good choice, again.”
Unmistakably.
. On the back of the first photograph stood a date, place and time. “
. That was interesting. They entered the living room that was decorated solely in. Well. White. White shiny floor, walls painted white, white furniture, white decorations, and an awful lot of white decorations. To make matters more intriguing , the woman was the proud owner of three
“Or anything about his character - or
They stopped at house number 4. The small front yard was decorated with angry-looking dwarfs, which John found fascinating to look at. Why anyone would want to greet ugly, frightening goblins every morning was beyond him. But then again, it could be that the doctor in him had just learned to become 'opinionated'.
Chuckling at his ex-flatmate’s whining, John slid further down into his seat, almost laying down in his chair before he blurted out, “Your arse.” As he found his outburst to be quite funny, he started chuckling in earnest. “O god. I did. I really did think about your arse.” Pure mirth was showing in the doctor’s kind eyes, revelling in the knowledge that he’d been able to shock the detective. “You could not deduce that, eh?”. He gently kicked Sherlock’s left foot.
The night was pouring through the windows, no stars in the sky from the pollution of light. Everything was still busy. London never changes. He sat there for a moment, deciding he couldn’t let this end like this. It would ruin so much to leave
“Oh.”
most certainly would regret later.
'In the North, there are worthier threes'
The smells of food rolled in waves. They had done this before. So many times. Though now something felt different, there had been an intangible change that neither of them could quite put into words. John opened up his menu, intending to select nothing at all, but just doing so because he could not keep his hands still. Smiling, he acknowledged Sherlock’s eagerness, “Trust you to skip right to the case.” Turning his attention back to Sherlock, John regarded him over the edge of his menu. He looked disturbingly familiar and inviting. Like a magnet pulling John down to experience deep heights and extreme lows. John shut his menu and sighed.
Somehow, John had the honest feeling Sherlock meant it. That he was sorry for the way he’d changed John's life so completely, into one of uncertainty and danger. For just a moment, Sherlock looked up at him and John tried to swallow down the words that were stuck in his throat. Unsure of what to say, John chose to say nothing. He just kept looking at the man in front of him, seeing things he'd already seen before but had never acknowledged.
With his black, thick curls tousled from the activity,  Sherlock groaned at the loss of touch, watching John with a predatory, mesmerised look. "John,
. “- You didn’t sleep well?”
A devious grin spread across John’s face when he realised Sherlock might be secretly enjoying John’s admiration. Yep. This was even better than playing Cluedo with the tosser. John silently berated himself for not having done any of this before. Well, when he thought of it, he kind of had. When he asked Sherlock to be his best friend man. Best man friend. Best man, friend. Whatever. Both. John had flustered his best man friend then, shutting him up quite nicely. “Ha!”
He was a part of John that could never be ignored nor detained. A part that would forever spiral around him, move him, aggravate him and arouse him to his core.
John was literally being dragged up the seventeen narrow steps and he let it all happen, worried that if he waited- if he wasted a single second, they’d start thinking about the consequences of whatever this would be.
"What's next? You contacted Lestrade?", he held the phone up for Sherlock to take back.
"Out of the ordinary, you say. Everything here is out of the fucking ordinary." John was shivering uncontrollably at this point, grinding his teeth and cursing under his breath why London’s criminal class always had to be active at night. He grazed his right hand over the SIG he'd hidden in the inside pocket of his coat just before he left 221B. "We've been here for over 2 fucking hours and nothing has happened yet." His teeth were chattering and he feared he’d have a case of bronchospasm if he’d stay there any minute longer.
Maintaining eye contact with Malina John continued, “And I agree with that statement.” He saw Malina’s face contract a little bit, before she audibly sighed again and straightened her posture.
"Your friend," Malina said, looking at Sherlock's writhing body, "is bleeding terribly." John had seen the bloody stains on the detectives' coat, hoping against all knowledge the blood did not belong to him.
, but he was also in quite some state,
Sighing, he continued, "Don't know why you want to know this. It has nothing to do with what I've seen."
It was getting later and later, and the clock had already struck 3 am. Tomorrow, it would be a Sunday, and he'd promised Molly to return as soon as possible. Leaving this flat now, however, felt more final than anything. In his oblivious mind, he did not know what the best course of action was at this point. He absolutely wanted to refrain from doing something he or
Descending the stairs and opening the front door, John noticed a rather large package left outside stamped with the words ‘from Mycroft’ written in beautiful italics. John quickly peered inside to find perfectly hand carved pieces of oak wood, unmistakingly belonging to a toddlers bed.
“Well. Yes, I guess so. God. That’s a bit depressing.”
“Back the fuck off!” He yells as he slams the hood of the car in his passing.
John noticed that a girl was propped next to Sherlock and he assumed it to be Felicity. Her skin was flaking, slowly decomposing as nature ran its course over her body. If John wasn’t so used to spending time with Sherlock’s experiments or in a morgue, the sight of where her hands had clearly been severed would’ve made him gag. Her lips lost all colour and her head had rolled forward. Just by the looks of it, John knew the smell would be awful.
The table they'd sat around numerous times before, eating, discussing,
Irrevocably.
Could you get Rosie from daycare and bring her over to Baker Street? Including some of the essentials, like clothes, toys-“ He paused to look at Sherlock to know how he was taking all this.
"You're on the right track, my boy. Give me your teacup," she nodded at the empty cup in front of Sherlock. "Felicity enjoys anything spiritual, mostly nature-based. I believe she joined a group of old ladies practising periodic rituals. Nothing harming, mind you. All in the spirit of Mother Nature, of course." Squinting at Sherlock's cup, she continued, "I met them, they seem quite lovely. They haven't seen her since, unfortunately." She quickly glanced at John's teacup. "Finished, dear?" Reluctantly, John handed over his cup too, realising too late that they'd both fallen in her trap to accept her tea.
The thousands of text messages he'd received from Molly and from Mycroft over the week had not helped to take his mind off from the pain he was feeling. They wanted him to return to Baker Street, to
"Well, that's one sacrifice more, isn't it?" John said to the naked, old woman who did not show any shock at the dead body of her friend nor at seeing John's figure emerge from the deeper part of the forest.
"Charming." Was all Sherlock said in reply, cracking a fleeting smile. John, however, felt his throat constrict again. Images of Mary and him floating in front of his eyes. How she'd laughed at his boldness when he asked her out of the first time, how she'd stared wide-eyed at his failed marriage proposal, how she had died, taking the bullet that was intended for his dear friend. His best friend. The other person he could not live without.
Clearing his throat, he continued in a louder tone of voice, "What are your thoughts about the girl's connection to the church? Those ladies, do you want to investigate them further?" John had a bad feeling that this was just 'the tip of the iceberg'. A damn big iceberg hidden in some occult society in London. Or in a goddamn trailer park with terrifying looking goblins. And Chihuahuas.
Blood diverted to his trousers and he was desperate to feel more of the madman in front of him, but he didn’t want to make him uncomfortable. The suddenness of it all was intense. So raw.
The lights in John’s flat were out and everything felt so serene and quiet in comparison to Baker Street. As he’d expected, Molly had taken the spare bedroom adjacent to his and Rosie’s. Checking on his daughter and touching the softness of her hair, he let the tears fall. It was
“Christ! There are seven billion people alive, at least one could bother me with a decent case. Have the criminal classes just decided to have a holiday to spite me?” He yelled out loud, to the audience of a wall and an old skull. Ever one for the dramatics. His own monologue with no one watching.
John noticed a photograph of the girl they knew as Felicity, next to her was a photograph of a girl having the same facial features as the missing girl: brown long hair and brown eyes. She looked much younger than Felicity and John estimated the girl was not older than 20.
Running in the city center of London, John tried once again to contact Sherlock but reaching the bastard’s voicemail once again. "Fucking hell, pick up!" John roared into his phone. The goddamn bastard was probably ignoring him. Aggravated and worried, John tried a different number.
John knew he should break it off. Knew this was a
John didn't see shit. To him, they were just dried, wet tea leaves that left a bitter taste in his mouth. Malina smiled at them before continuing. "You-" she nodded her head towards Sherlock, "- should be more careful. You do not need mental stimulation in the form of chemicals designed to be addictive. You already have what you need. Don't waste it by maintaining this indifferent facade. Caring is the best advantage you can have."
“Right.”
John knew Sherlock had said it a million times before. Not in words, but in his actions. Now, however, it was out in the open and John wanted to tell him that everyday too. Pointless sentiment now meaning the world to them.
“It’s complicated. I don’t-“ the detective sighed, clearly still unaffected by the cold air, his answer interrupted when the living room in Selina’s home was slowly illuminated. The lighting wasn’t even enough to suggest anything electric. “Candles.”
Well, John had taken action. More precisely, John had followed what he thought he desired at that point. And where did that leave him? Mother fucking alone, grieving the loss of a friend and the start of something new altogether.
O god.
John scoffed, frowning. “O come on! Like you never thought about that part of someone else’s anatomy.” He regarded Sherlock for a moment, whose pretty protruding cheekbones had turned a nice shade of red.
One of the older women left the bonfire and stepped to the right. John followed her movements, hiding low to the ground and behind the surrounding trees. It was then that he noticed the woman had walked towards three other bound bodies on the ground, one of them being a very irritated, disoriented detective.
The woman turned to Sherlock with a horrid look on her face, the deep lines on her face tainting her features. "I don't have a son in law." She turned her attention to John then, who was still eyeing the tea suspiciously out of the corner of his eye. Malina carefully placed the cups on the table, gesturing to Sherlock to take a seat. "Please, my dear. The vibe you're giving off is tremendously nerve-racking." Sighing, she sat down across from him, placing Timbo on her lap who was staring at John very distrustfully.
Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on anything but John when he responded, “I know it would be easier. I get that John. It’s frustrating.”
The sender's identity was unknown, so John dismissed it as being some weird spam message and  made a silent promise to himself that, from now on, he wasn't using his mobile for looking up porn again.
The park was deserted and no disturbing sounds were coming from the woods. With his SIG at the ready, John ventured into the dense forest, making sure he was not making any sound.
No way.
. "I think you'd be more successful if you were to ring their doorbell and present yourself as a new member of their severing fat arses cult."
Chuckling, she looked up to John and responded, "Michael and Selina were having an affair. Totally unholy to his Church's standards of course, and I believe poor Selina did not care much for his advances. But, after you came after me, we needed a replacement. What a surprise it was to read your tea leaves."
. But Sherlock had dashed off, going around the opposite of the table to circumvent John, ending up lying sprawled across the sofa again. John approached him carefully, suddenly quite aware of the absurdity of it all. Here he was, naked, about to have sex with a person about whom he'd thought did not even felt the urges normal people normally felt. Not that John considered himself to be normal, though. He approached the detective, who looked at him so fucking wantonly. "That looks good on you." He tried to sound smug, relaxed, but it came out a lot hoarser than he'd planned.
“Yes, definitely.”
"I'm sorry too."
So the spur-of-the-moment conclusion was that John wanted him too.
. "I think she was just upset and wanted to set us off a little bit. And you're the one to talk. You actually fled after she instructed you to use your fucking heart instead of narcotics. Why do you still find it so fucking difficult to care.” John did not know what set him off in that exact moment, only that he definitely needed to quit fucking swearing. He had a kid, for fuck's sake.
John smiled broadly. “We have a motive!” He cringed at the sound of his voice, berating himself for sounding like a hormonal teenager and promising himself to never drink again as it did nothing good for his ego. “Then again, she could have been abducted by one of her clients. I’m curious to know who reported her missing. I don’t see any missing ads on his page, but on her mother’s-” It pained John to see the mother’s desperate pleas for help. “If Rosie went missing-“ he stopped himself just in time.
At that moment, John saw something flicker across the detective's face that he could not yet identify. He was not sure whether it was a reaction to something that he'd said or because Sherlock suddenly realised something about the case.
They kept running until they were too exhausted to physically move anymore. By that time they were closer to civilians. Safety in numbers. A few people were staring at them when they tried to catch their breath, steadying themselves with their hands on their thighs. John hoped to think their audience had seen stranger things than a pair of men a little roughed up.
The following morning, John woke in a familiar but strange bed. Instead of hearing Rosie babbling through the baby monitor, the doctor heard London buzzing outside. For a few seconds or so, John experienced a feeling of pure bliss, like he was on a short break from his normal, mundane life. That feeling, however, did not last very long as the memories of the previous night fought their way through his foggy brain. He tried to sit up, hating his inability to refuse any liquor, and dressed himself quickly to face the music downstairs.
! John was running now, crossing busy streets, having no clue where he should go only to find that his legs brought him back to Baker Street.
Always.
, was about to happen. Unfortunately for him, his phone remained deadly silent. The hardest part of all, John had not even dared to contact the person who he knew could offer him the excitement he was looking for. He was ashamed of his absenteeism, having ignored the stream of messages in the past, now, John was afraid the consulting detective did not even want to text him anymore.
Still catching his breath, John noticed two things. First, he really should start using the bike again.
"There is always time to do both. Are you going to be coming?"
, who was he even kidding. Of course he knew the sodding bastard had this effect on him. He'd wanted him to. John could tell that he was becoming frustrated by the minute. Not a good sign when you just had sex.
A week had passed and, during that week, John had tried - hopelessly - not to think about anything that had transpired that dreadful Saturday. He had even tried to forget the memorial, the church, the witch hunt, Malina...
“You might want to check the front door,” he drawled as he left a bewildered John behind in the living room.
"It's my understanding," he continued looking at Malina, "that you have to call off this ritual altogether."
“Right. Where to start.” Sherlock said with his phone in hand, breaking the silence that covered the awkwardness between them. The silence was something they were used to. For days, sometimes weeks, they'd sat silently in each other's company, neither saying a word. Back then, it had been a comfortable retreat from Sherlock's outburst of boredom. Now, it was nerve-racking.
. You enjoy being complimented. Your ego thrives when someone pays you a compliment.” John felt he was on a roll, adding smugly, “
When he prepared himself for his next client, a little boy with a mild form of asthma, John heard his phone chime again. A nervous flutter started in his stomach, thinking for a moment he would see two familiar initials pop up on the screen. Quickly checking his mobile, John saw that the same anonymous number sent him an attachment.
John did not give him a verbal answer. Instead, he ran to the window, shoved it upwards with incredible force and
From what John heard from Molly, Sherlock had been in a bit of a slump for the past months. He’d been trying to stimulate his brain, anyway he could. Reading. Experiments. Having unfortunate experiences with LSD which led him to profess he knew the meaning of the universe before climbing up to the rooftop singing at the top of his lungs while he watched the clouds dance.
John moved a little closer so that he was standing before him with his hands in his pockets, balancing on his feet. “I do recall - quite vividly- that we actually went on a case, drunk to our core.” He didn’t think that was the right expression, but there you go. “On that occasion, you even had a little nap on the client’s carpet-,” he continued, stressing the t, “-your big arse stuck out in the air.” He frowned at himself, his mind providing the mental image for him. “I really should get laid”, he muttered, only to realise that he had actually said that out loud, for unintended ears to hear. Ashamed, he pursed his lips and bit the inside of his cheek. “Right. I am going to make some tea.” Without asking whether Sherlock wanted any, he advanced towards the kitchen.
John looked sideways at Sherlock who had a terribly big smirk forming on his lips. Locking eyes, a rush pulsed through him. A nervous, divine buzzing energy that came when one played Russian roulette with his life.
“I’m trying.”
“You know the tales of Bella and the wych elms surely,” the detective stated, quick enough to stop John trying to whine at him about doing this so out of the blue or how he was sick of his attitude. Whenever he complained like that he knew he sounded like a disappointed spouse. “Well. I have reason to believe someone - some group of people are trying to recreate it.”
He swallowed before answering John, "No. She lives in some trailer park outside London. Her parents probably took her phone, 'cause she did not respond to my texts."
Their relationship had always been a bit odd, but the distance between them had built a terrible tension that could’ve made him squirm. It had been weeks or...well months since they had last spoken. He grabbed his phone, typing and re-typing the same message over and over again. Eventually, he settled for simply saying.
"I am not a superstitious man, Sherlock", he said, ignoring the poignant fact that he'd talked to Mary's ghost for months after her passing. "But, somehow, she was also right about me." John glanced at his partner. "I just want to believe that I'm finally taking matters into my own hands. By, for instance, joining you on this chase -" More softly, he added, looking out of the window, "- and by moving in with you.
Deadpanned, the boy whispered, "I was looking for Selina. We'd promised to meet each other at the Church. When I arrived, she was not there. Instead, there was- " he took a deep breath before continuing on. "I saw someone painting Jesus."
They had been fooled.
Nor just his best friend.
Sherlock regarded John for a while as if he were cataloguing him with new eyes. It startled John slightly as he found it a little nerve-racking to watch. “Sit?” He asked, gestured to the chair next to Sherlock. “I really killed the mood. Didn’t I?” Looking at him with kind eyes, John hoped to reassure him that everything was ok. Going to be ok. Sort of. John wanted to be back, wanted to be involved. Involved in cases. Involved in Sherlock’s life. To what extent, he honestly did not know. He just felt extremely comfortable with him. Drawn to him like a drug addict in need of a fix. John got that now. “Sometimes, I wonder how Mary put up with me. Leaving everything behind to follow you on cases. To be involved in all this madness. But then I realised,” he turned his attention to a very interesting looking spot on the table, “she was as addicted just as I was. She was addicted to the person I became whenever I was with you.” That was the most honest and difficult thing he had said in a while. Thinking back to his lengthy, quiet therapy sessions, he suspected his therapist would be very proud right now.
Sherlock’s lips were tugging into a small smile and John felt his heart burst. He knew that the happiness that was suddenly coursing through his body was showing on his face. He felt himself smiling like a lunatic.
"I don't know, some ladies worshipping Nature Mom and brewing perfume." Good god, this kid was a fucking imbecile. Rubbing his hands in his eyes, he groaned. "Have you any idea where Selina might be right now?"
"Right. So you can't complain I don't tell you where we're going, you can decide."
"Shit."
He knew Sherlock would be able to forget about all that had happened. To delete everything that had just transpired as if he was wiping off the dust from a window sill with one swift movement. To continue as if nothing had changed. But everything had changed. Considerably. Horribly, even.
And so it happened again. John’s hurt morphing into a deadly form of aggressiveness. His therapist used to describe this phase as his most 'unfunctional' phase. A tad more mildly put than the description he once heard from an ex-teenage girlfriend. She used to refer to him as the 'pufferfish'. Soft and hard on the outside, but when poked in the wrong way very explosive and lethal. If you did not watch out, you would choke on its venom.
I’m not-
They made their way up them, ending up in another dark room that led into a smaller one. Sherlock opened the only door they could find, determined in his actions. Peering over the detective’s shoulder, John immediately noticed the repugnant smell of copper and rotten flesh. Shit, Sherlock-”
" Sherlock scoffed softly, carding a hand through his dark mess of curls. "We're not
And oh god. John cared for him.
“Want to get closer?” Sherlock suggested, his vocal timbre sending shivers through John’s spine. His hands were steepled in front of his face and the way he’d uttered his suggestion sounded as if he was testing John’s bravery. “Mmm... we could hide behind another caravan, or disguise ourselves as
. John was shouting now. He’d moved forward so that he was standing next to his old chair, a few inches away from Sherlock’s rigid posture. John felt so fucking angry that he felt that he was about to combust. “To follow you around on fucking cases? To praise you? To make you fucking tea? To what? To fuck you? Tell me!”
“Ah. Well. I may have been singing Pink Floyd very loudly while on hallucinogens.“ The bastard had the audacity to smirk. “Just a calm afternoon for my standards.”
. He silently muttered, “Still trying to get the damn thing fixed due to all the viruses you put on it.” Scrolling down the missing person’s website, the doctor found it rather odd that a few older ladies were missing. True, there was a prostitute named Felicity who had apparently vanished into thin air, but that had happened two months ago. The last few weeks, three ladies around the age of 60 had left their loved ones one morning to never return. “Odd. Wouldn’t a grandmother return to her grandkids?” John muttered more to himself than to anyone else in the room. “Three women, aged 57, 64 and 66 have disappeared within the last two weeks. What do you think of that?”
his body. As if Sherlock was memorising John’s squamous cells one by one. The intensity of it all made him gasp and cry out when Sherlock let him know he wanted to advance to the next stage: making sure John’s prefrontal cortex was momentarily occupied. Years and years of unresolved tension, frustration and balancing on
"By descending together with him," she glanced at the detective, "to nature." She held up her hand when John wanted to scream, to yell at her mental blabbering-
“ ‘You are not making sense, but I am more than happy to let it go.’ ” The way John tried to lower his voice to imitate his friend’s low baritone felt pretty spot on to him. What did he want? John wasn’t sure. Definitely some water to clear the fogginess in his head. Getting out of character - or back into it, whatever - John rubbed his face and groaned. “Is the upstairs bedroom still operable? Don’t think I want to go back tonight.”
His inner turmoil must’ve shown on his face for he thought he saw regret filling in Sherlock’s eyes. Seeing his own turmoil reflected in front of him, he let his mind speak the decision he had already made when he had stood outside 221 B earlier that evening. “Alright.”
.” He said, a bit startled at how fierce his own voice sounded.
“Trust me, kid. You don’t want to go there. You just don’t want to piss me off. You want to avoid that. At. All. Cost.” He said tightly.
“Honestly. I don’t know.” John felt he was going to rattle when Sherlock would give him the chance to do so. Sighing unevenly, John turned around to place two teacups on the kitchen table, carefully avoiding making eye contact with Sherlock. “I am just glad to be back that’s all. And it was a long time ago since I was this plastered.” His chuckle felt forged and he quickly tried to cover it up by stressing how solitary the last few months had been. “Being alone with Rosie in that big apartment... Everything reminds me of Mary. I-,” he paused to get the boiling hot water. “I sometimes really want to go back to how things used to be. Joining you on cases. Listening to your whining,” he dared to raise his eyes at that one. “Talking. Listening. Just. You know.”
When they were first crammed somewhat involuntarily inside a shed, now they were sitting closer than necessary in a cab. John noticed Sherlock was practically glowing next to him, the giddy energy coursing through his veins, radiating off him as he was not even trying to hide his pleasure. Although Sherlock was quiet for the entire cab ride, his right leg was bouncing and he tried to capture John’s eye every few seconds. John returned the sentiment completely. They had practically cheated death with every case they had taken on and that high made them both lose every feeling that wasn’t pure impulse and pleasure. Tonight was no exception.
It suddenly dawned on him then and he turned around to start running in the other direction of the forest, completely forgetting his intentions to be quiet.
Without breaking eye-contact, Sherlock cut him off. “You’re straightening your posture. Your eyes aren’t fixed anymore and you’re glancing around. I can tell when you’re lying. So I’ll ask again. What were you doing?”
Sherlock looks at the floor, silently thinking. Then he looks up at John.
John groans and feels his cock flex in need. He needs to touch, but somehow he knows Sherlock is in charge of this scenario. Sherlock is the one to decide how this will go.
John gives him a confused look, "What?"
John hears a disgruntled noise come from the man in his arms, "I am not a bird. I am a cat."
Sherlock gives him a bewildered look, "Option?"
"But she's gone, Mary is gone. Moriarty is gone. All that's left is you and me. Just the two of us. And that's all I need Sherlock. It's all I ever wanted.
He didn't tell John.
He moves to toss the letter in the fire, when a very small, very American, very
Lestrade puts up a placating hand, "What I mean to say is that anything he's ever made for me has either been blander than sand or absolutely bitter."
But Sherlock is a genius, completely brilliant of course. He can taste a million different nuances (well maybe not a
The fungus comes up behind John and uses Sherlock's hands to turn John around to face them.
He pulls out an older pair of pajama trousers, grabs a pair of scissors from his bedside drawer and cuts a hole in the bottom for his tail. He doesn't bother with pants. Why ruin more than one piece of clothing?
If he could cry he probably would.
John is confused by Sherlock's reaction for a full second before he replays what he said in his head and feels himself blushing hard, "Ah! No, I didn't mean that. I mean I would like to. Eventually. But-uh-,I mean-" he's floundering for the right words, absolutely lost in his mortification at how rude he just sounded.
And that's how John got the best Christmas gift he could have ever asked for: Sherlock's Love.
"I love you John Watson."
John brings his hands up and runs them through Sherlock's curls, grabbing them, ensuring their kiss doesn't break for a moment.

how it
However, now, standing at a crime scene with Sherlock, he really wishes he had asked what Sherlock had bought when he went out earlier.
"Why on earth would I think about the dishes?"
The ride home simultaneously takes no time at all and feels like forever, but in the end they get there and it's just as well they decided to leave when they did. A heavy snow has begun to fall and the streets are already filling with it.
"Sometimes I think about you."
He can feel the swelling of his belly has stopped and he feels the sensation of a baby moving inside him. He rubs at his taut belly and then moves his hand lower until he can shove his trousers and pants down and grasp his cock. He gives a few strong tugs and then slides his hand lower, but startles with the shock of what he finds. Distracted by all the other sensations of his body he hadn't felt the very distinct change to his anatomy. Behind his cock and balls is a new opening into his body. He sticks his hand back down and wishes he could see the new change to himself but exhausted and aroused as he is he can hardly stand to find a mirror; an exploration by touch will have to suffice for now.
John watches as Sherlock places two sugars into his tea and stirs slowly.
"Out. Clearly you don't want me around."
He's still hot and achy, but most of the searing pain that had consumed him before has dissipated. He lays like that for hours, or possibly merely minutes, he doesn't know.
It's what Sherlock thinks to himself over and over again as John kisses him. Pulls him down by his hair and roughly claims his mouth, his throat, dark marks bruised into his pale skin.
John rolled over and Sherlock pulled him in close to be the little spoon for their cuddle.
He walks up the stairs to 221B and into the sitting room.
Sherlock stares off into the distance. There are mountains he doesn't remember being off the coast of England.
John's gaze softens and he gives Sherlock a small smile before looking out at the pond, "Yeah. I am." His voice is quiet, pained.
And this is the way his world ends, not with a bang, a cosmic crashing of forces; but with a whimpering sigh, as Sherlock slides his hand from John's neck to cup his cheek and guide them into a kiss.
Forever.
Sherlock startles so badly he
"I take it you two watched Fantasia today?"
"How long have you been here?" Sherlock tries to add a tone of imperiousness, but he's not even sure his voice carries any sound.
Their conversations always have.
"Ah, no, I hadn't realized." John can feel his face flush with embarrassment.
"What kind of, um, 'affections?"
He looks wrecked already, his body flush and his tumescent penis incessantly grinding into John's body beneath them.
They lie together in the quiet stillness in the morning. Sherlock wishes this could last forever, this moment, but he's burning with questions. His best asset and greatest flaw: his insatiable curiosity.
Sherlock wakes and he is on the back porch. He's in a reclining lawn chair facing the fields behind his small cottage.
"I'd take you there. I
The sudden change startles Sherlock and he jerks back from the pot and then curses under his breath as he guesses the flame must have blown out under the pot.
This gets Sherlock's attention. He sits straight up, his ears perked and his tail lashing agitatedly. "Where are you going?"
Sherlock pauses his eating, his ears flattening to his head, "You didn't tell Mike what's happened to me, did you?"
Sherlock gives John a dubious look and takes a sip. What he tastes causes him to drop the cup and grab John by the face to kiss him passionately, which John accepts wholeheartedly, smiling into the kiss.
He doesn't know if he thinks it for himself or the held tea kettle.
"Doesn't change the way I feel."
John for his part is stunned. He can't honestly remember the last time he heard Sherlock apologize.
Before John can say anything, ask anything, Rosie comes thundering down the stairs and into the kitchen. "Daddy! Sherlock! Elsa and I are ready for dinner." Rosie has put her Elsa dress on over her regular clothes and made sure Elsa was wearing her blue dress as well.
John climbs onto the bed and then over Sherlock's body. John can feel his heart beating super hard and can see Sherlock's own carotid racing.
"That's interesting."
After everything, he's finally ready and able to reach out, but he can't reach far enough.
"God. I love you. I will never tire of saying it now that I can. I love you Sherlock Holmes. Have done forever now and likely will forever."
He watches as John quietly steps into his room. He's wearing pajama trousers and an old threadbare shirt. His hair is rumpled. Belatedly Sherlock realises that he's also holding a glass of water.
"Ah. Ok. Did you forget you should probably confess your undying love for someone before you start snogging them senseless?"
He looks into the sweet-smelling murky soup and grimaces at the idea of drinking it. While it smells nice, it does consist of other
They will tease me until the day I die.”
Sherlock still looks worried. “But you-“

John has to bite back his own tears. He lies there, arms around his best friend, his source of light, this boy he loves
“What?”
John pauses, shifting his weight as he tries to think of an answer that doesn’t make him sound like a lunatic.
“Finished for the day?” John asks.
“Looks like a pretty minor sprain. You’ll need to keep it elevated tonight, I’ll get you some water and paracetamol back at the cabin. And remember to ice it
“That isn’t the John Watson I know.” Mike says, shooting a spell at John that steams out the creases in his borrowed shirt. “You’ll find a way to catch his eye. Do you remember your fling with Reggie Musgrave back at Hogwarts?”
"What a pretty thing man is,” Sherlock began in a breathy voice, “when he goes in his doublet and hose," Sherlock leaned just slightly back and roamed his eyes up and down John's form- he was shorter than Sherlock, but, God,
he wants to watch stupid movies with you until you fall asleep?”
For a single moment, Sherlock smiles so soft and sweet. “Good morning.” John aches for this to happen every day. To wake up tangled together, tender and warm, over and over again. Then a cloud passes over Sherlock’s face as he remembers. In a heartbeat, Sherlock extricates himself from John’s arms and rolls out of bed, rubbing his eyes. “S-sorry! Again. About last night, about all of this. I really don’t know what-“
Only took Sherlock
John wants to throw up. Instead, he takes a shower, trims his fingernails, and pretends to read a biology textbook for another hour before he gives in, and calls James.
- too long with big lips and heavy brows: strange, and almost alien. But John thought that it might be one of those faces that would stop being strange and start being handsome, given half a chance.
Nurse - Janine Hawkins
John and Sherlock walk back out on stage together to cheers. John says something to the lead guitarist as Sherlock tests out the violin. The song begins almost as Sherlock remembers it, except this time John sings it with dramatic gestures as he describes the pain and longing of the Pauper before he meets the Prince. Sherlock rolls his eyes, but as he picks up the violin part and John’s face breaks into a blinding smile, Sherlock can’t help but mimic it.
dragged him into this, after all.
The plan goes off without a hitch, Molly hesitating over pursuing Mrs. H long enough for John to dart through and reach the small square of grass where Sherlock is reclined.
“It’s
“Three hundred pages on the Science of Deduction and its practical applicability to the field of forensic sciences.”
No matter what Irene said, John can’t help but think about it for the rest of his shift, whenever he catches a minute to himself. The mad Muggle who made his blood sing.
Sherlock scowls at him, but his cheeks are pink with embarrassment. “Did you come here to help me catch a diamond thief, or to ogle me?”
Irene flaps a hand at John. “

“That means I have to wait
“That’s not what most people say.”
“Who?” John asked as he walked towards Sherlock. “Who’ll die?” He reached the Sherlock-shaped shadow and tugged it down. He hissed in the boy’s ear, “Get out of here. Now.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” John murmurs. That sounds somehow worse than a partner cheating with sex.
so he just wraps his own arms around Sherlock and squeezes right back.
“Ah. Right,” John replied, awkward.

. "Anyways, better get back to the, eh, grind." John jerked his head in the general direction of the Shop, where Sherlock saw an abandoned a screw gun and some lumber.
, Sherlock thinks, giddy. “John…” he tries to begin, but finds no words to say it all. Instead, he leans in and presses his mouth to John’s.
John didn’t blame the audience for loving Mary. She was mind-blowingly intense up there, completely believable and sincere. It was twice as impressive considering she was talking to Anderson.
Sherlock smirks, and does just that. “The army training is discernible in your posture and bearing. I deduced doctor by the way you washed your hands, thoroughly and up to standard medical practice. Invalided due to gunshot wound is obvious. They don’t let army doctors go easily and
Sherlock grimaces.

“Dull. But looking up. I have plans for us tonight.” Sherlock wiggles around in John's grasp to continue looking through the dishes.
“Ties to the mafia.”
. In an instant he dropped the flirtatious act, straightened, and raised a single eyebrow at John. “Satisfied?”
Sticking out his tongue at his smirking boyfriend, John throws the robes at his face. “Put these over your clothes, you poncy smartarse.” John orders, marching into his own room to change out of his Mungo’s garb.
“Okay.” John shrugs, inwardly delighted with this game. Upon further inspection, Sherlock’s papers are an oddball mixture of charts, hand-written notes on scraps of paper, and photographs that don’t move. John’s brow furrows as he thumbs through picture after picture of ordinary ash, in a variety of subtly different colors and textures. “What’s with all the ash?” he holds up one of the photographs, which Sherlock snatches out of his hand with a huff.
comments are highly appreciated!
“Oh, alright. Sherlock! Come on over to team ‘Winners!’” There are “aww”s and “eww”s in equal volume as Sherlock moves to stand behind John’s shoulders, offering a kiss on John’s cheek as he passes. Their relationship has been a great source of amusement and distraction for everyone on camp these past few weeks. Many counselors and some campers had known and universally hated Victor. Luckily they found John a vast improvement. Had they not, John suspected he’d have made himself some enemies, and quickly. His boyfriend was utterly oblivious to the loyalty he inspired in these kids.
Jeff Hope seemed a bit off, tonight. He spoke his lines well enough, but his face was red and sweaty. John could see his discomfort from his position in the balcony. Did he have a bad case of stage fright? Sherlock did say that Hope wasn’t a trained actor.
we fly to Tahiti and elope but my Jamie wanted a real ceremony with his sisters there and all. And I can’t help but give him anything he wants.” James chuckles as he strokes a hand through Victor’s hair.
Luckily, he catches himself in time not to hit his head, but his phone is not so lucky. He’s gathering its scattered pieces when he hears a woman’s voice.
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh. He rather adored this girl, red talons, dares, and all. “What’s this new dare you mentioned?”
“Yes?”
Irene laughs merrily. “Oh no, Sherlock is gayer than a Billywig. But he hasn’t dated anyone since I first met him three years ago. Not since his childhood sweetheart broke his heart.” There’s a sad smile on Irene’s face.
John snaps. “Victor is a real person and my
“But, I mean,
Soon, Irene arrives at the door to drag them inside. She ushers Sherlock off somewhere immediately, scowling at John when he tries to follow. With a shrug, John finds an open seat and tries to look inconspicuous, appreciating the overwhelming loudness and

” were where he’d lost his first tooth (lower center incisor). Where he’d made his first friend (Molly). Where he’d had his first kiss (Victor), lost his virginity (Victor), and only two summers ago had his heart broken for the first time (Victor yet again). Sherlock sighed, noting the trend. It was a relief that after that infamous summer, Mrs. Hudson  refused to re-hire the counselor. Sherlock suspects Mycroftian intervention. (For once he doesn’t mind.)
Complete silence for a moment followed by the renewed delight of small voices.
John, in Victor's place, kissing warm-soft-full lips, fingers tangling through the curly hair he knows so well.
John doesn’t notice it until James points it out (from India for fuck’s sake).
?” Sherlock asks, exasperated. John giggles.
John’s aforementioned gorgeous smile falls. “Mary and I split up, actually.” John tries to pull his grin back up, but Sherlock can see lingering pain written there. “We don’t want to date long distance, and I’ll be shipping out soon enough, if everything works out. So, c’mon. No more excuses. Dance with me.” Sherlock knows this is a terrible idea, but he obliges John. He loves dancing, and the thought of dancing with
“You do.”
Sherlock huffs, feeling playful. “Don’t be ridiculous. If anything, I'm a Trev-Whore.”
“I didn’t understand before: your stage persona is so different from the real you. It’s all about ‘the thrill.’
When Mary pulled away from the fierce hug, there were tears in her eyes. She wiped them away at once, her scowl daring John to mention them. “I just care about you. And that’s a difficult job, considering the stupid things you do.” Mary perched on the side of John’s hospital cot and put a warm hand against John’s cheek. Touch-starved, John leaned into it.
“I think I might just go and say hello to our newest recruit! What do you say, John?” Irene calls, already heading for the door to the hall.
“Are you planning on joining the army as well? To pay for school?” Sherlock asks, like he’s an interviewer, and feels stupid. Sherlock

“I know what she said!” He all but shrieks. In the startled silence that follows, the fight, the
“Yeah, what’s that about, Johnny?” Harry asks through a mouthful of scone –
“Some things never change, do they Anderson?”
“Lovers?” Sherlock says at the same time.
John smiles back, helpless and bursting with light. “God, I hope so.”
Looking back to his computer, Conan has climbed up onto his desk and the audience is going wild. Conan points into the camera. “John Watson just implied he had a boyfriend on
“Can I tell Molly? That you’re my boyfriend?” he loves the feeling of the word in his mouth and suspects he's going to be using it a lot.
“Nothing?”
“Sherlock, Irene is not going to appreciate that.”
James barks out a laugh. “Y’always were a bit thickheaded, John. Need a good, solid whack over the head before you understand these things.” James leans back into Pranav’s arms, and twists to look up at him. “Have I told you the story of how John and I got together in the first place? I used the ‘I have a fake date and need to practice kissing, with you of course’ scenario on him.” They share a laugh while John scowls.
"You can't." His voice is deep and quiet, but he knows John heard him because he tenses up next to him.
and then tell yourself your love for the man is just the world's most epic
It still hurts to think about that period of time. He's long since forgiven Sherlock. He knows it was necessary, but it still hurts.
The next time he comes aware of his surroundings, the humming surrounds him like the bees of his hives.
Sherlock's mind is panicking as he realizes what's happening.
John averts his eyes and notices every officer within view do the same, including Lestrade.
John sets his coffee down and steps to Sherlock pressing their bodies together, "Bed does make more sense. Best idea you've ever had." John reaches up and places a soft kiss on Sherlock's lips.
They sip their tea in silence only occasionally sharing a heated glance with each other.
The light is a shallow grey and the storm has reached him, though it has yet to start raining.
. So. Still deeply attached.
Sherlock's eyes are trailing over John's face rapidly, "You seem really shocked by that."
"Sherlock?"
That isn't to say they won't fight. That there won't be days where one or both of them are upset.
Right? Isn't he horrible? He deserves this, doesn't he?
He never ate on a regular schedule and his love of stinky food was incomparable. (Sometimes John thought he did it on purpose.) He was also prone to hiding dead things around the flat. He always claimed it was for some such experiment or other, but John was pretty sure it was just an instinct.
"Thank you."
*****
He feels an irrational panic and need to hide, an instinct so strong he almost scrambles under his bed. He only just stops himself.
"Don't let me fall." It's a whispered sigh on Sherlock's lips.
He's sorry for Mary, for who she was and who she wasn't. He's sorry about the baby that never was.
Sherlock knows with a startling clarity as John comes up the steps that he will be the end of John Watson.
He's a man of science and here he is stirring what basically amounts to a potion. But it's a necessary evil. He couldn't find what he needed elsewhere. Every lab or research facility he called (and there weren't many to begin with) who were studying male pregnancy gave him the same disappointing answer.
"It's just me. Don't worry about it. Probably just the short days getting to me." John knows the reassuring smile he gives is anything but reassuring.
John stands from his chair and then settles onto Sherlock's lap, straddling his legs. Sherlock brings his arms up and caresses John's back. They meet in the middle for their kiss. John is elated that Sherlock actually does like him and wants him like this. Romantically and sexually.
John looks down at a spot next to Sherlock's head, "Why don't you put something on and I'll order in?"
John reaches out and grasps Sherlock's behind pushing them harder together.
John is halfway up the stairs to his room to fetch some pajamas when it really hits him.
John let's go of one of Sherlock's hands and reaches up to caress Sherlock's face. "Let me try to say that again. Sherlock, if you're okay with it, I would very much like to sleep in the same room as you tonight. I don't think I could bear to be separated from you."
He feels (both with his fingers and with the skin being stroked, which is an odd but not unpleasant sensation) the new soft moist folds of skin. He can feel himself dripping. He smears his fingers around and gathers some up so he can bring it up to his face. It's clear and slightly viscous, with a musky scent.
Or rather, they're in this together.
Sherlock gave an appreciative hum, "That's good, because I intend to love you at least that long, if not longer." Sherlock pulled gently at John's hip. "Come here and turn the other way. I want to cuddle you."
John drops his hand from Sherlock's face and gently pulls Sherlock's hand to lead him to Sherlock's own bedroom.
Another moment passes and then John is slowly stepping into Sherlock's room as if Sherlock were a predator who at any moment could devour him.
"Awww...Look at the lovebirds. Made up I see?"
John can't begin to fathom the depth of courage that took. Lord knows he would have kept tumbling along, pining, never saying a word for fear of losing what little they had.
Sherlock feels as if the man is familiar but at the same time as though the man has no memorable features to himself.
"Adaptable too. There's nothing like waking up to
John feels wanted and blessed and every morning his heart swells infinitely bigger with the tender love he feels.
Sorry I took forever with this. I hope it lives up to expectations.
"Oh God. John you taste of my milk."
Which means Sherlock must like something about him. Must find some part of him attractive. He takes a deep breath and wills the nervous butterflies in his stomach to calm down.
John gives a low moan, "Or not. I guess we can,
He can feel the baby moving through him. An odd sensation that quickly becomes overwhelmingly pleasurable as the baby seems to be pressing against his prostate as it makes its steady way out of him. He writhes on the floor and sinks to his back. He hikes his legs up and starts bearing down. For as quickly as everything else has happened it feels as if this, the birth itself, is happening in agonizing slowness. He's sweating and panting with the exertion and the unending stimulation.
Six hours later Sherlock clatters back up the stairs and to his room.
Harry comes out after Bethany and let's her eyes go wide at the sight of her brother on the couch with Sherlock. "So can I say it was a lovers quarrel now?"
Lestrade watches as John walks off slightly in a daze.
Sherlock gives a choked laugh and leans forward throwing his arms around John giving him a hug.
John feels a need to hold Sherlock and so he gives in. He slides from his chair to his knees, slides his hands up Sherlock's arms and around Sherlock. He tucks his face into Sherlock's neck and breathes in the smell of him. The odor of slightly sweaty skin and home.
*****
"John? Can I ask a question?"
"Have we always been English, too?"
Sherlock hands him his coffee.
"Oh, I'm sure you two have done enough eye-fucking to qualify for the phrase."
Sherlock made am affronted noise and pulled his head back, scandalized.
He steps forward until he's right in front of Sherlock. He looks up into Sherlock's every color eyes, "Ok. Let's try."
The answer is always yes.
"I promise."
He's so old.
He looks to the man with frustration, "I don't know what that means!"
ATTACK
"Hey!" John chastises gently, "There's no such thing as a silly wish. Why would you say something like that?"
He notes its limits and then gives it a steady, gentle tug. Again, he pulls until he begins to feel pain. He adds an additional mental note to never ever let anyone else pull his tail. The idea of the pain it would cause makes his stomach drop and his whole body shiver. He drops the tail and lets it resume its subconscious role of hugging him.
. "Amazing," immediately scrunching up his nose at the realization he had given in so easily. "So, what are we waiting for? You must want to speak with these Harry Potter people." If, of course, Sherlock hadn't already done that. With those long, violin fingers, Sherlock could easily fire off more text messages per hour than anyone or anything he could think of. "If they are under any real threat, they might know who wants to hurt them."
“Mm, how’s civilian life treating you?”
It struck John as odd that Malina kept referring to her daughter in the present tense, and he felt bold enough to point it out to the woman who was peering at their dried-up leaves. "You believe she is on the run?"
"Care to explain what you're doing here, mmh?" John heard footsteps behind him and he turned around, pointing his gun at the two naked ladies in front of him. One he definitely recognised as Felicity.
“You promised me to never run off again without me, and what do you do? You go after witches alone. Witches who want your fucking arse underneath a damn tree.”
“Yes. I, unfortunately, remember too. Hence the ‘no fit state’ thing.” Sherlock’s voice trailed after him. “John. Is this all too much too fast? Being back here I mean.” His friend had followed him into the kitchen, standing behind him and keeping a moderate distance when he watched John try to make tea in the right order.
Sherlock’s hands were bound with two pairs of handcuffs and when his friend moved around frantically, the male figure kicked him in the stomach, causing Sherlock to shriek out in pain and roll over.
Apparently, security cameras had last seen Sherlock near the park at the memorial, running frantically towards the adjacent forest.
A soft smile tugged on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth and he snorted a little before he tried to resolve John’s dubious state of mind, “Yes- that would definitely be useful.” John surmised that Sherlock could have easily made a wisecrack about it and appreciated his friend had decided against it. The whole evening felt like a case of deja vu. John was back at Baker Street. Just for a night and then he’d be off in the morning, or whenever he was sober enough to realise this probably wasn’t a good idea. “OK. Hand me your phone.” He was not doing this on his own outdated, little machine. Typing was already difficult as it is, his fingers being too big for those fucking small buttons. John held out his right hand, urging Sherlock on and sounding somewhat demanding, “Come on.”
"And," Malina continued with a somewhat laboured voice, "our dear detective is not spiritually natured as the girl." She chuckled, "Help me with Selina here, will you?"
Sherlock cared.
. John realised he’d just crossed too many boundaries at once. He had invaded the enemy’s territory without a clear plan or backup, and now he was screwed. Did he just think of Sherlock as the enemy?
“Yes- that's a good point.” His friend cracked a smirk. “Nothing interesting. Half of this is just ads - the other half is celebrity gossip and sports.” He put it down, “I have no idea how people actually get through reading these every day.”
“They were offering the bodies to bloody trees.
Mycroft tried to sit down in John’s chair, but his brother’s glare intensified at his very movement. Sighing unevenly, he decided to lean against the damn furniture instead. “Yesterday, I was somewhat concerned about the text messages I received from you mobile. They all expressed the abundant part of flesh that seems to be attached to a certain part of your lower autonomy. Then- “ he went on, softening his voice, “It came to my attention that you and the good doctor renewed your partnership, investigating
'No. JW'
“Look, it’s fine. You can go and we can talk it over tomorrow.” The Detective Inspector hesitated before saying, “I hope things work out between you two.”
. He still sees the deadly expression in front of him. How he’d been so cold heartedly dismissed as a functionality. A means to pass time.
“I’m sorry I left you alone today.” He whispered to his daughter’s sleeping form as he sank to the floor and rested his head against the bars of her crib.
Sherlock put a hand against the elm to steady himself. Running a finger over where he’d been stabbed and groaning at the discomfort. “Did you contact Lestrade?”
"Mmm what do normal drunk people do? I assume investigating occultists wouldn't be a very typical night out with the lads." Sherlock laughed a little, sitting down in the middle of the coffee table. It was just incredible how many ways he'd find to avoid using furniture normally. It was funny and endearing to see Sherlock sitting so relaxed on a small, wooden coffee table. Like he owned the place.
Craning his neck, he tried to make eye contact with Sherlock, grasping his face in both hands. “See my face? What am I thinking? Deduce it. Come on.” A small smirk formed on his lips.
Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed, creating the impression of a fish out of water. In the dimly-lit room, John could make out that soft shades of crimson rose on his face, tarnishing the clear white of his skin. A small splash of colour on a blank canvas. John dared to think that if he’d been able to listen hard enough, he would have heard the detective’s brain stopped functioning, as if he’d momentarily broken him.
Up close Sherlock looked a frightful mess. Splotches of blood served to be the only colour on him. He was more pale than normal and he looked like he’d lost weight too. There were deep bags under his eyes. It was clear that even before this happened, something was definitely off with him. He put on a weary smile before letting it drop.
Aha. There it was, John thought. Sherlock was, after all, a little bit bothered by the woman's remarks that afternoon. Or he just wanted to piss off John.
Sherlock bit down hard on his lip to hold back a moan, his eyes fluttering close for a moment as if he just wanted to focus on the sensation. “Please,” the tiny word felt jumbled and the detective’s cheeks burned brighter, opening his eyes to lock John’s in a submissive and so impatient haze.
Grasping Sherlock’s hair, holding him in place. “I fucking love you too, you bastard.” He managed to get out. As he broke contact, he saw how affected Sherlock was by his blunt kiss.
So, that's why John did nothing. He ate, he slept, he cared for his daughter and for the patients in his clinic like the good GP he was.
John snorted, "Offended? Why would I get offended? I just thought you two had confessed your love to one another when we visited your sister for tea." The desperate, broken look on Sherlock's face when he'd spoken to Molly was ingrained in John's memory. John had seen that face in the mirror on two occasions. After Sherlock had jumped off fucking Barts and when Mary had just died in his arms. The doctor decided not to mention that for he knew it wouldn’t do them any good.
Right.
Sherlock managed to pull some strings to get the kid out. In a day or two, just to spite him for being a bit of a prick. The hypocrisy of that didn’t deter John. "Christ, you can't just rush off like that anymore without telling me where we're going." Sherlock had practically dashed off out of the police station and John tried to keep up with the erratic man. While hailing a cab, John noticed that the smug look on the detective's face had not faltered. "God, you already solved this one, didn't you?" John also noticed that he used an awful lot of religious swearing words lately.
The detective squirmed against his bindings and John wondered why the martial art expert didn’t break free. After a few fruitless attempts, Sherlock stopped for a moment and looked down at his wrists which had started to bleed from just how tight it was.
. Whatever
They were, after all, moving back in.
More quietly, John countered, not looking at Sherlock while he redressed himself, "I recall that
“What’s going on?” Sherlock called out again, only to get no response from his captors. Trashing one last time, John saw that he gave up, disappearing in his mind to come up with some sort of ploy John knew wasn’t going to work with these madmen.
He stayed relaxed for about three seconds when he stood up abruptly.
"We can only finish this if we sacrifice an unwanted match. After you visited me, I knew we could not go after Michael anymore- the police are monitoring him non-stop nowadays." She sighed, getting onto her knees next to Sherlock, brushing his sweaty hair out of his face.
“I already told you that.” Sherlock suddenly froze, his eyes focused on the deserted hallway. “John, if you jumped out a window do you think you could keep running while you hit the ground?”
Ignoring Sherlock’s poor attempt at sarcasm, John continued scrolling down the pages.
“John-” Sherlock sounded exasperated and John averted his gaze to block the detective’s state of distress from his mind. He had given up fighting with the ropes, just sinking down now and his body crawling with a horrid pain. It wouldn’t do them any good to panic right now if they wanted to get out of this mess.
“Two victims, both dead. I think the girl whose hands were severed off goes by the name of Selina. You will also find a deceased male - I shot him because he was threatening Sherlock.”
“I figured we both needed something to do.” Sherlock leaned back in his rather uncomfortable chair, not bothering with the pleasantries of ‘How are you? How’s the kid? Some terrible weather right?’ Small talk was not particularly important to him. He probably thought of it as bland niceties.
you thinking about anyway?” Sherlock looked at John now. Fixing his gaze in a deducing stare, probably inferring his loneliness or fatigue.
It was drying by the time they found it. Placed on a desk on top of a newspaper. Pale. Discoloured. The blood completely dried out. Looking closer, John saw that it was cut bluntly with a dull blade.
him. Had made him feel as if Pandora's box was finally allowed to be open to reveal all her treasures, only to drop all of her curses onto John in the aftermath.
for all I care.”
That earned him a chuckle. John felt giddy again, eagerly taking Sherlock’s phone and set on doing all things imaginable just to piss off his flatmate.
Sherlock, for one, definitely seems to enjoy it, begging him to continue, lose moans slipping from his mouth. Nothing embarrassing to be found there. To reassure him that this is what John absolutely wants too, he kisses the detective fiercely, then slowly, adjusting the rhythm of his kiss to the movement of his fingers. "Got to grab something, hold on." He whispers hoarsely, reluctantly getting up from the sofa to reach for his wallet. He was a doctor, after all.
, lives in a relatively nice house half an hour away. Dug through his Facebook a bit but it’s painful to read him talk about how much he adores his dogs and his car. He is well off. Stuck in some soul-sucking middle management position in a company. Parents that seemed to have made a lot of money back in the ’60s. Everything about him seemed perfectly suburban. The most blank, space-filling person imaginable. His wife just happens to be a sex worker.”
“I’m not sure it was her spirit that drove her to meet dangerous people.” Sherlock deadpanned, drumming his fingers on his now empty teacup. “What aspects of spirituality was she interested in? Do you know if she was in contact with like-minded people?” There had to be a connection between her and the church. Seeing the detective mulling over Malina’s words, John knew he didn’t even entertain the possibility this was a red herring. Something seemed off. Something in the thread of London was being tugged at, and Felicity was the loose string.
on me first,” stressing almost all words in that sentence. Little did he know that Sherlock would have that effect on him.
“And second?” The boy’s sounded smug.
Mycroft had caught the infectious smile that day too.
John stared in disbelief at the message's preview on his phone.
The bastard had kissed him. Had
“Oh I’m not a lightweight - I just hadn’t eaten in-” He paused, clearly containing himself to answer truthfully. “I just hadn’t eaten that day. Besides, you’re much worse than me.”
One of the naked women picked up the young girl and dragged it away from Sherlock, John could hear his friend curse at the position he was in. Following the woman, he saw that she brought the body to a hole they had dug underneath a giant oak tree. Soon, a naked man appeared behind her, dragging the detective with him. Sherlock thrusted his head back in an attempt to ward off being dragged, but it was to no avail. “For fuck sake will someone tell me what the hell is going on?”
I need you." His voice sounding soft and pleading, "Please."
Just like Sherlock instructed, he intended to start running as soon as he - painfully - felt the ground underneath his hands and feet, but pain shot through his leg when he hit the concrete. Two hands hauled him upwards and pushed him forward. John staggered a little, cursing his damned leg and dashed after Sherlock once he found his footing.
And John.
"Time."John frowned his eyes. "Alright." He sat up, not knowing what the hell the detective meant by that.
“Is that weirdo not gonna say anythin’?” John gritted his teeth. Oh, he definitely was gonna play this the hard way.
Sherlock complied by putting his legs over John’s shoulder, sending an exasperated look towards his captor. His answer was a familiar drawl, "Don't be gentle."
"Ye-es. 'Though some might believe otherwise, Jesus definitely was not there." The boy dared to roll his eyes at them.
How dare he- But he was right, wasn't he? John
Sherlock and John both furrowed their brow, and the doctor pleasantly pretended not to hear her insinuate there was something ‘going on’ between him and the detective, listening intently to Sherlock’s follow-up question. “Well, what did you think of him? Or the two of them together?”
They were doomed, John realised. They were going to cross so many boundaries of which John thought he would only cross when fully inebriated, but somehow that only added to the thrill of it. John was going to return Sherlock the courtesy of utterly devouring him. While he bit and sucked the pale skin of his throat, he wedged his thigh between Sherlock’s legs, making absolutely clear to the detective where this was going if they did not stop, right now.
“And, I’m going to make the upstairs bedroom ready for Rosie. I’ll order in, so I might wake you later just to eat and to renew your bandage.” Softer, he asked, “Agreed?”
is what we require. So, we must wait for the match to arrive. He should be here very shortly." She gestured for the man to help her drag the young girl’s body under the tree.
Influenza had struck again, meaning that the days at the clinic were long and dull. Newborns, toddlers, elderly, John had seen them all, never being able to do more than give them general health advice and painkillers. The most interesting cases never reached their clinic, for they had already called in an ambulance, leaving John and the rest of the staff to deal with insufferable, meaningless ones.
“John, please, it’s not worth it. Think about Rosie.” Sherlock did not move as Malina touched him, his eyes locked onto John’s, his look urging John to shoot her or to just walk away.
Drunk John admitting his obsession with a certain part of his ex-flatmate's anatomy.
“And there it is again,” John muttered at Sherlock’s bossy tone. He’d forgotten how demanding his lanky friend could be when his interest peaked. “Alright, she does fit the bill. Height 5.7, slender, brown long hair, brown eyes.
They made a stop back at the flat to gather everything they needed. They had about 2-3 hours to kill before it would be dark. Funny how fast the day goes. They didn't need much. Nothing that would weigh them down. Most of the stake-outs were spent trying not to get horribly bored. They needed to document everything they found, so a charged phone was all they needed. No need to lug anything around and if things go south they could always call Lestrade. Not that that was ideal as that would mean they would be more exposed to whomever they were observing.
True, John thought, dropping his face in shame. It hadn’t taken him more than just one glass of devilish liquor to start blabbering about his friend’s arse. Disregarding John’s inner turmoil, the detective continued, firing off a long stream of words in a smug tone of voice. “Anyway, the husband,
"Don't you dare fucking touch him!"
John felt himself immediately sobering up, his heart was pounding in his chest, blocking his throat. He knew he was staring at Sherlock with wide-eyes, not quite believing that those four words were just uttered in each other's vicinity. Coming from Sherlock. Directed to him. Silence spread while John fought an inner-battle to unclog his throat. He wetted his lips, a telltale that he was trying to form words that were worthy enough to be uttered. “Me too.” John knew he was an expressive person, his non-verbal behaviour often betraying how he felt, especially to Sherlock. Now, he hoped his aversive characteristic would help him to convey everything he thought and felt to Sherlock. “If it wasn’t for Rosie, I would be back living here within a heartbeat. If you’d allow me.” He didn’t know how much more of this he could handle. It was so intense. The smallness of the room was becoming more apparent with every second. There was nothing left but the two of them. The edges and the clutter of the world fading to white.
Sherlock laughed and took in a breath before whispering in a voice so slight as if he were scared to hear himself say it.
John smiles softly and kisses Sherlock.
"Alien, but whatever floats your boat."
John takes a deep breath and realizes that his heart has fallen into Sherlock's waiting grasp.
"Fascinating." Sherlock sits up in his chair and leans towards where John is leaning towards him. "Then in that case, will you take me to the bedroom John and please fuck me?"
"Ah. This is a hallucination. My brains gasping last pulses. I suppose this is preferable to a recap of my life."
He starts to reach for his baby when he gives a small cry as he feels a second birth begin to unfold. He's stunned as he realizes as he's giving birth to twins. He's having a second baby right here, right now. He feels it move down and through him, the sensation no less odd then it was with the first one.
In a matter of moments he can feel it begin to spread him open. This baby must be larger than his first was because despite his already stretched body, he can feel his body struggling to stretch around it. He bears down hard but it feels like the baby is barely moving out of him. The baby is digging into what feels like every sensitive spot inside of him to the point where he can't resolve the pleasurable sparks through his body and it feels almost like pain.
"Then why do you look so sad?"
"Oh."
Mycroft cuts in, "John. What my brother means to say is that we both already know how the other will respond and so we can each carry out the whole conversation within out minds without uttering a single word."
He doesn't realise immediately that John is at the door, in fact he doesn't realise at all until John gently calls his name.
If John had known what Sherlock had bought he might have had a chance to intervene before every officer in the yard was also staring at Sherlock's cleavage and clothing choice.
Sherlock purses his lips in disappointment, but on reflection he knows that John is right. He doubles down and shoves the food into his mouth, chewing and swallowing as quickly as he can, pointedly ignoring John's amused smile.
"Daddy pay attention. I'm not done. We also watched a movie. It has-it has pretty music and there were butterflies and the daddy butterfly protected the baby butterfly and there was also Mickey Mouse and he couldnt stop the brooms. He was a-uh-um..."
Sherlock answers, "Of course. Did you?"
John laughs at the indignation in Sherlock's voice at being compared to a bird.
(See the end of the chapter for
The moment feels endless and perfect.
They embrace each other tightly and John never wants to let go of him.
John steps in after Sherlock and shuts the door behind them.
"We are in a relationship."
"Sherlock? You up? I've made breakfast."
He watches John grieve Mary.
She nods her head once, "Ok."
Admittedly, he's always been a bit touchy about the possibility of John leaving (and there's that aggressive feeling of possession again), but not like this.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder from where he was curled on the couch, "Why would I do that when everything clearly is?"
And now here he is, in bed, body wrapped and shielded from all the horrible shadows of his fears by the only person in the world who matters to Sherlock.
It's been quiet the last few days. John suspects something will come up soon; it's been snowing nonstop since yesterday evening and people in close quarters are dangerous.
John shakes his head, "Yeah, I'm fine. Just suddenly realized how warm it is in here." He walks around the table and opens the kitchen window a crack. An ice cold breeze drifts in.
"You okay?"
He adds water to one sample in an attempt to rehydrate it. It's moderately successful.
"Oh." Really, it's the only response John can manage. This is unchartered territory, outside the normal bounds of their conversations.
Sweat soaks him and he is so thirsty. He carefully pushes himself up and out of the bed and takes a couple of steps into the bathroom. His body is pale save for two red spots high on his cheekbones. His hair is a mess and stuck up in odd angles. He runs his hands through his hair and gasps at how sensitive his scalp has become.
"Me too."
John moved in with Sherlock the same day he saw the flat. It took him nearly two weeks though to meet Sherlock's boyfriend. He had said at dinner when Sherlock returned from his outing that singular evening that it was all fine. Sherlock claimed to be married to his work and that was that, or so John thought.
Soon he'll be quiet.
What if they had followed through on their darker threats?
Sherlock wants to believe him. Wants to believe that he can be loved and that John would love him.
He doesn't let go of Sherlock's hand even after their standing. Sherlock's heart stutters. People will see. People will think John is in a relationship with him when John absolutely cannot be in a relationship with him.
Sherlock's body goes limp as the fungus has finished with him.
"I didn't think you wanted anything like this with me, so I thought it best to keep it to myself. Though why didn't you say anything?"
"Of course John. If my choice is between a second guaranteed chance and a possible maybe, in a few centuries, second chance, then I choose now. Besides I know we'll do it right this time."
He falls and the waves swallow him, cover him in their depths. He gasps and takes in only water. He is too late.
John groans at his sister, "Harry, we just slept. We did not have sex on your couch."
John feels his face go soft and he's sure that if Sherlock looked to him in this moment he would see nothing but love on his face.
"Ok. So first things first, a small caveat. Almost all the information available is either anecdotal from actual cat people or their spouses or from extremely niche scientific papers. So. We should be prepared for anything, but here's the gist of what is known.
Sherlock's cooking and occasional baking are literally the best food John has ever eaten. He doesn't taste much of Sherlock's emotions when he makes the food, but whatever it is he's feeling makes every meal simply divine. John told him that exactly once which was received with a look that said, 'Of course it does,
"It won't get better than this."
Sherlock watches as John's expression changes to shock.
That was not the question John had wanted to ask.
"It won't get better than this."
"Really?"
"Good?"
"You really love me?"
He'll wake with a scream of terror stopped in his throat, his body covered in a night sweat so bad it's as if he stepped out of the bath, and if he passed out somewhere other than bed, then the likely destruction of whatever was breakable within reach of his thrashing.
"I'm not her father. We wouldnt want her confused. I'm just...helping out. Until you find a new wife."
Distantly, he realizes he's panting again, both in arousal and from the physical exertion of the changes he's going through. He rests a hand on the outermost portion of his belly and takes a quick breath at the shock of pleasure. The skin is hypersensitive. He can feel it still gently stretching slowly. He feels an odd pickling sensation in his nipples and swipes his hands up his belly and to his chest. He moans and stares in fascination as he feels a rush and then his chest is swelling into his hands until he's holding palmfuls of tender flesh which he can't help squeezing and which begin leaking thick milk as he does.
"Ah! Fantastic. It seems Princess Elsa
John scoots closer and braces his weight with his right arm between them. He's careful not to touch Sherlock anywhere else. He leans in and kisses Sherlock's blush on his cheeks before trailing kisses down to Sherlock's plush lips.
"Well. After you went to bed I did a bunch of internet searches and I also called up Mike to see if they had anything in the hospital library. He dropped off a book this morning, and between that and the internet, I've got a general idea of what's happened to you and what you can expect."
Without turning around, he whispers into the thick tension that now sits between him and Sherlock, who sits behind him at the kitchen table, "What did you say?"
"I haven't actually said I liked you."
The one thing he couldn't do is burden John with his pathetic weaknesses. John has his own worries, he doesn't need Sherlock's.
Rosie gives John a kiss on his cheek, "Thank you. Love you daddy." She then runs off upstairs to fetch her doll.
"I think I've found the connection..." Sherlocks stops feeling the obvious tension in the air. "What's going on in here?" Sherlock looks to John who blushes from ear to ear cherry red and guiltily looks down at his coffee. "Lestrade had a sip of your coffee."
Nothing.
Sherlock smiles back, licks his lips, takes a deep breath and says in a quiet voice, "You're beautiful too, you know."
"Where are we?"
Sherlock watches as blood splatters onto John's face and begins oozing in a thick foam from John's mouth.
John runs his hands down Sherlock's back and brushes up against his tail. Sherlock gives a full body shudder and cries out. "Again, John, again."
"Yeah, physically you're stronger, faster, and more resilient now. Night vision will be better. You'll probably want to sleep more though, too. Tradeoffs and all that."
A shiver runs down his spine and a heady heat centres in his abdomen as a spark of arousal goes through his groin. He has an intense urge to rub himself and the tightness of his abdomen turns into a soft fluttering squirming feeling again. He looks down his body and sees his cock thicken in his trousers. He's so unbelievably horny. He starts to stroke himself through his trousers when he feels another weird sensation and stares down at himself as he feels his abdomen begin to slowly swell.
"Sensitive."
"About time!"
"Oh God, Yes."
Carefully, he gets up and looks outside.
"I had hoped that maybe you would want to try."
Sometimes his mind forces him through more than just his memories. Some nights they force him through the what-ifs.
Sherlock grasps John's hands against his chest and hugs him back.
Inevitably, John begins to notice Sherlock's extreme aversion to sleep.
Sherlock draws his head back and scrunches up his face, affronted, but most surprisingly- and this stops John's laughter at once- he lets out what can be best termed a growl. From somewhere deep in his chest, a short warning noise. His tail also perks up slightly and puffs in warning.
What the hell has happened to him?
Sherlock faces John again this time clearly annoyed by his new emotive body parts, "Last week, when I went to do research for that banker case, I was scratched by a cat. Here." He turns up his arm and shows John the neat row of pink scratches, nearly healed. "I thought it was superficial and typically cats don't transmit rabies, so why should I be concerned?"
John gives Sherlock a perplexed look.
John listens and contemplates Sherlock's words, stated so simply and plainly as they were. John hears the genuine reflection in his tone.
"Oh my God, Sherlock! Oh, thank God."
"Who are you?"
"Rosie, why on earth would you say that?" John asks her gently.
"Can I tell you of an affection I've wanted to share with you for a long time now?"
"Maybe. But you're complying."
Their synchronicity is hypnotising and beyond erotic for John, almost more so then the act itself. John feels as if he's no longer in control of his body. He is Sherlock's to do with as he pleases. It's heady and subsuming.
More than a doctor...he needs John.
"How so?"
Sherlock can't look John in the eyes so he focuses on a water stain on the coffee table before telling John neutrally, "I'm no good at this John. You are better off staying away from me. I'll hurt you no matter how hard I try not to." Sherlock swallows tightly, "I already have."
His hand drops his pencil. Sherlock thinks to pick it up, but his body ignores him. With a gripping panic he tries to will himself to do anything, but he's paralyzed, no longer in control.
"Was she talking to you or me?"
"How do you know that?" Sherlock starts tucking into his meal but regards John with an inquisitive gaze.
The man points into the distance, "Are you forgiven?"
He strokes himself and uses his other hand to stimulate his belly and nipples; it seems to work as he experiences what feels like an orgasm, but is much more powerful and centered around his new opening, but he doesn't ejaculate. The force of it has him squeezing his eyes shut and shouting which turns into a cry of relief as the baby's head slips out of him.
John gives a heaving sigh and watches him go. Lestrade sidles over and looks between Sherlock's retreating form and John. "So, uh, Sherlock has breasts now? Like proper centerfold breasts?"
"My nightmare was about my time away. And then it was about you. You...dying." Sherlock gives a ragged sigh, the fear and panic from the dream threatening to consume him again.
"Pretty sure he is." John can feel himself getting defensive.
When he returns, Sherlock is in his chair rubbing his body all over it. John stands in the doorway a moment, then, "Another symptom, is it?"
They rush to Sherlock's bedroom, both of them quite eager to explore each other's bodies again.
John can't help the sigh of disappointment he gives.
"Hey little brother. Lovers quarrel?"
It presses into John's groin and Sherlock can feel John straining even through the stiff fabric of his jeans.
"Which is?"
And that has him jolting up in shock, eyes wide now, because
"Ah, bed, I believe, makes more sense. Though less rhyme-y."
"Always."
"You leaving was the worst thing I ever had to endure."
But it is one he'd really like the answer to.
"I'll read it for myself, but I do appreciate your summarizing it for me. So. You leave me in suspense. What's in store for me? Please don't tell me I'm going to grow fur all over."
Then Sherlock whispers into his ear, "
John sits impaled on Sherlock's lap and can feel tears coming to his eyes as Sherlock relentlessly strokes his cock with one hand and his nipples with the other. He's so stimulated. It's a painful pleasure.
It's not enough to make him come but it is a beautiful sensation of teased arousal, like scratching an itch. He moans again, this time at the sight of his body. He hadn't known what that concoction would do, if anything, but this is beyond anything he thought possible. He, a man, is very much pregnant and ready to burst with a
"John. I said I'm sorry for being rude yesterday and saying the things I said." Sherlock cocked his head before giving a dramatic sigh and throwing himself forward and into a kiss with John.
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm not saying you didn't hurt me, but you were a net good in my life and we could have worked together to fix our problems. You thought leaving was the best option? You coward.
He looks in the mirror one last time before turning around, flicking off his lamp, and heading down the stairs.
Sherlock knows he is forgiven and that he can forgive.
Sherlock carefully removes himself from John's chair and walks haughtily into the kitchen. John rolls his eyes and follows, setting their food on the table.
And then John happened.
There will be no more nights (or days) without John.
John doubles over with laughter at the look on Sherlock's face as Lestrade suggests he take his breasts off.
Much to Sherlock's surprise John gives a sputtering laugh, "I'm sorry. Are you high?"
John doesn't face Sherlock, staring unseeingly at the counter before him, but he tilts his head in acknowledgement that he's heard what Sherlock has said.
"It won't get better than this."
As evidenced by Sherlock's statement a moment ago, apropos of nothing.
John purses his lips and narrows his eyes at Sherlock, "Now you're just taking the piss."
"Ah. We were, weren't we?"
John finished Sherlock's breakfast and did the dishes.
John.
John generally isn't the passive aggressive type but he can't help himself from handing Sherlock his coffee and plunking Mycroft's next to the man.
He's old and so tired looking. His face isn't fresh and youthful anymore. His body is dense, a combination of leftover muscle and Mrs. Hudson's leftover cakes. He isn't lithe and gorgeous like Sherlock.
They're must have been something in Sherlock's breast milk, because they had sex four more times after John's stomach settled, before they were finally spent in every sense of the word.
Sherlock shakes his head and growls in frustration, "I'm not being clear. Mycroft isn't my type. You are."
"Except you, John. You may continue to stare."
"That we would always be together."
John looks to his left to see their grey tabby looking up at him impatiently.
"You just drank something Sherlock made."
They sip a moment in silence, until Sherlock makes a displeased sound.
To run.
Time doesn't seem to have meaning to him anymore.
Suddenly he feels dizzy and collapses slowly to the bathroom floor, first to his knees and then completely, feeling the coolness of the tiles. He clutches his head as a burning intense pain rips through him, starting in his skull and then continuing down his spine. He convulses and arches. It feels like the pain will never end, but suddenly it's quiet except for his heavy panting.
