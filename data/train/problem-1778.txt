“I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes,” said the butler. “But the major does not desire to see you.”
“The same to you, James.”
“I did!” the valet piped up. “I was attending the major when I heard a loud crash. I ran in here and... and saw him in a heap on the floor.” Barton winced. “I called out and the major came running.” He pointed to the ceiling. One arm of a gas fixture was bent. “I think he was only up there for a few moments, sir, but I thought he was stone dead!”
Men were standing at the bar or sitting at tables, drinking and speaking together, their heads close. A common enough scene, yet not so common if one knew what to look for. No females, not even a barmaid. And many young men who were – how shall I put it? – of a theatrical bent. It seemed an alien world to me now, but that had not always been the case. No, not at all.
I walked up to the King’s Road and hailed a hansom.
“I’ll say I’m sorry, Doctor,” he said, hanging his head contritely. “But I’m not really.”
I paused on the pavement. “I don’t think I could swallow even a single bite. Let us return home. A good night’s sleep is the remedy that would suit me most.”
“I would not know,” he returned. But his face said otherwise. “I am not privileged enough to be a guest of the earl and his mangy brother.”
“More than you can imagine,” he said darkly. “I could strike at your ridiculous paramour at any time, but I refrain. Always remember that: he’s only alive because I do not wish to kill him – yet.”
“If you wish to question Mr. Fisher, you are an hour too late.” Lestrade glanced down at the corpse, which was already beginning to stiffen. “We have everything under control here, Mr. Holmes. And you may put away your gun, Doctor. We have the victim – and we have the perpetrators. There is no need for your services tonight.”
“Rudimentary, dear boy,” answered Holmes. “Henry Sherringford-Holmes was his lover. You know your history, man! King James was infamous for lusting after beautiful young noblemen and then showering them with titles and gifts of land and jewels. Henry was young, noble, and beautiful – if his portrait in the drawing room is accurate, which I assume it is – and, apparently, not averse to the king’s attentions. The result is this house and the continued fortune of the Sherringford-Holmes family. Oh, and the title, as well.”
“But they never do, do they?” Holmes reasoned. “They make their rounds of the floor to ascertain that all lights are extinguished and then they retreat to their break room to gossip, cruise the internet, eat the junk food that is forbidden to us, and otherwise ignore the inmates. I’ve been here long enough to know that the staff rarely deviate from their tedious routine.”
Greg carefully and
“Wiggly worms in–!”
“But…” Mycroft continued, and Jawn’s brow furrowed even deeper. “Only little boys with dry bums can play the game I have in mind. Wet little babies…like you…would have to sit and watch.”
Mycroft followed behind him, having left Greg to collect a sippy cup.
"Jake an' a pira'des! I y'ub i'd!"
“I halp!” Sherlock said, belly flopping back onto the bed, long fingers searching through the bedding.
“Cheater!”
"He's right though, now the suns going down it's gunna cool off fast."
“Well, Sherlock’s going to sit there until–” There was a tugging at his sleeve, pulling the bite of food away from his waiting mouth. “Yes, Jawn?”
Jawn huffed again and plopped down onto the floor with an audible squish, then immediately looked as if he realized that hadn’t been the best idea.
Sherlock shoved the entire biscuit into his mouth and clambered under the covers.
"...Could you start over, then?"
"Hey, hey," Greg said, putting his hand on the baby's back to steady him. "No one said anything about sleep, muffin."
“His bum’s red,” Jawn replied, still frowning.
"G'eg helb," Sherlock nodded.
Mycroft stood at the bottom of the steps with Sherlock, watching and shaking his head. Finally, he gave Sherlock a nudge; "You too. Let's get you ready before our meal arrives."
"Hur'ds," Sherlock sighed, staring sadly at his cereal.
Jawn chewed the thumb that had made its way into his mouth.
Greg took the glove from him. "Myc! Did you not hear me say they'd get stuck?!"
"They c'n go bay'cation in the ki'dchen."
"God...no wonder he sucked down three cups like they were nothing."
"Broken?" Mycroft asked as he took Sherlock's hand and kissed it, his voice tight.
Sherlock wilted at that; "A'course, Jawn. Promise.” Sherlock scooted over to make room for Jawn, who hesitantly slid into place.
Mycroft pulled the nappy over Jawn's bits, and taped it closed. He smiled to himself as he watched the tension drain from the little doctor’s chest. “Not vile, brother mine, pragmatic. And, anyways, spoon feeding two fussy little boys doesn’t sound like an enjoyable time.”
"We c'n do i'd, G'eg!" Sherlock deposited his stash of sparklies onto the bed. "We ju'ss ha'bba ta'ge pan's off!"
“Wha’d! Sh’erry is my fa’brite!!!”
Greg cackled. "Where do you suggest we go then, darling?" he asked, eyes glinting at Mycroft as he leaned his elbow on the counter.
Sherlock put a finger to his lips; "I'sh n'ah as good as se'ben, bu' I s'ill y'ike i'd."
...and then he realised what the baby was saying.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, then leaned towards Sherlock. "Do you want another piece of pizza first, or are you ready for your biscuit?"
"I can'nah y'ick a' fros'ing off?" Sherlock asked, looking up at Mycroft curiously.
Mycroft cleared his throat and grabbed a small, squarish pillow from the couch, then placed it in a chair at the table and had Sherlock sit down on it gingerly. “It’s been brought to my attention that we had a little visitor back there, even after I asked for privacy,” he said, taking Sherlock’s arm and rolling up his sleeve for him.
Sherlock took the scoop in one hand, with the other one still curled over the bridge of his nose, and dipped a full scoop of dark brown, chocolatey batter.
Sherlock, still sniffling and whimpering, climbed up onto the bed and lay on his back without having to be prompted, and Mycroft felt a slight twinge of guilt that he had to ask him to sit up so they could take off his soaking wet onesie. “I know, it’s no fun sitting on a sore bottom,” he said over the little detective’s whinging as the outfit was pulled over his head. “But it wouldn’t be sore if you had only listened to me and not made a bigger mess in the first place, would it?”
Mycroft snorted. "We had plenty of fun this afternoon, didn't we?"
Mycroft dropped his hands that he’d been holding in the air, trying to keep Jawn in place through sheer force of will. “I told you to lie back down.”
"And red. This is the one we're going to mix with blue to get a lavender flower."
Sherlock giggled and put his left foot into the leg hole of his pajamas; "Y'ef foo'd ou'd."
The little Doctor grimaced a bit, but dutifully chewed and swallowed.
“Jawn…” Mycroft took around, expecting the worst…and saw Jawn sitting on the floor, fridge door wide open, and eating the slices of carrot from the bag of pre-mixed salad. Okay, not the worst. He put his hands on his hips and stared down at the worried-looking little boy; “…I thought you said you weren’t hungry, you little thief. Get out of Mr. McGregor’s garden!” he said, and playfully snagged the bag from him.
"Ta'. But very funny...'specially when you hit your target."
"I y'ook e'berywhere," Sherlock said. "C'yoset is on'yee p'yace no'd a'yyowed."
"I don't know what that means, pet," Mycroft said as he got Sherlock settled in his lap.
Mycroft picked up the leftover biscuit with two fingers, and dropped it into the waste bin beside the bed. "Do you."
"Bu'd, um, you jus' say'ed, uh, you jus' say'ed tha'd he say'ed, um, 'No mu'ppins'."
"Noooo," Sherlock mumbled. "E'very'fings' spinny."
Once dressed, Sherlock peeled the plaster off his eyebrow without looking at himself in the mirror. He tossed the plaster into the rubbish and turned out of the nursery with a determined air.
Sherlock held the phone to Jawn's ear, tears pouring down his face. Jawn was hurt, it was his fault, and he was going to be in huge, massive trouble.
"Cha'yyer box?"
“Dunno,” Jawn said, his voice watery. He knew what Sherlock was trying to do, but he couldn’t focus on much besides the fact that Mycroft, frontrunner of the British Government and overall snobby prick, was changing his nappy…and being
"Don't tell us, or it won't come true."
“Good boy.” Mycroft murmured, pulling up Sherlock’s nappy and trousers as gently as he could.
Mycroft held his breath and waited, but Sherlock only turned onto his side and curled into a fetal position.
Mycroft hung back, watching as Greg eased Sherlock up the steps. He waited until they made it to the top landing, then turned, and went back downstairs.
A particularly brutal thrust pulls at the stitches that run in a crescent over his left shoulder blade and he can’t stop from moaning in pain.
“Eating barely enough to stay alive is patently ridiculous.” Sherlock growled at him but John pushed on. “The human brain uses about twenty percent of the calories we consume in a day. Do you really think that that massive intellect of yours is being supported properly by a single serving of chips?” Sherlock continued to huff but stayed reclined against his chest.
Greg seemed dubious. "That's going to wake him up," he said, eyeing Mycroft.
"Me either," Greg mumbled dryly, thinking of the smack over his arse that still tingled, even now.
"It's not even properly dark out yet."
"No. We are going to rest now."
"I'ss b'ery good," Sherlock said, licking his lips and paying no mind to the fuss.
He smiled at Sherlock’s antics to preserve himself. Since when had Sherlock Homes cared about his modesty? When John had demanded that he lose it, of course. Sherlock would walk around the flat naked before Daddy came along, because he was in control of his body and his own state of nudity. The second that John had slapped Sherlock’s hand away when he was trying to remove his own trousers had been the moment when Sherlock began to fight for his own idea of modesty. It had not worked, and John had won each and every battle since then, proving what John had already known. Sherlock fought him for the very fight, not because he was embarrassed by any of this.  Why Sherlock had picked this issue was beyond him, but it had been the one that his mind had settled on, and no one tried to explain Sherlock Holmes’ thought process.
Jawn hmphed. “Okay…give!”
"S'yow'yee," Sherlock repeated. "Cu'bca'ges done now?"
"The wet nappy says otherwise."
"Lavender? That's a complicated color."
"I y'ike p'yaying be'dder," Sherlock yawned.
"You had three. Is your tummy full?"
" 'm no'd a bay'bee!"
“Yea! Wai’d...Wha’d?”
“L….list’nen,” Sherlock nodded emphatically, pressing himself against Mycroft’s front and burying his nose in his older brother’s neck.
"A'cause murders?" Sherlock asked, eyes on the cup Greg was filling with apple juice.
Jawn was dumping all of his stuffies onto the bed and climbing in on Mycroft's left side. "Turn i'd o'bb for hims," he whispered back, wiggling under the covers.
"Not a chance."
"Owwch, G'eg. My 'ello rea'yee hur's."
"So many b'ootiful dresses!"
"Yes, be right back. We'll just be down the hall." Mycroft brushed the suds away from Sherlock's cheek and kissed it, then left the room...hooking Greg's arm on the way out, and dragging him along. "You'll have to calm down," he whispered as soon as they were out of eyesight and earshot.
Sherlock skidded into the room, his coat on and Jawn's in his arms. "Clever boy. You knew what I was going to ask next." Sherlock hiccuped, not even registering Greg's words. Sherlock gently draped Jawn's coat over his back. "Good job. Let's go." Greg guided them out of the flat and down the stairs.
John comes forward and unzips the onesie to mid-thigh.  “I think if Daddy has to help you with your pajamas you’re probably too little to stand up to have a wee Pet.”  John says, guiding Sherlock’s arms out of his sleeves. Sherlock huffs at him and makes to retort but John’s cocked eyebrow stops him. John helps him tug his trainers down and then leans against the sink, trying not to smirk at the bright blush across those impossibly high cheekbones as Sherlock places his bum down on the toilet. When Sherlock is finished John helps him up and back into his clothes.
The little detective’s face fell immediately, and Mycroft detected a glimmer of fear in his eyes. “…My’coff?” he asked in a tiny voice, a voice that matched the way he was physically shrinking into himself.
"Did you find some jewelry to go with my gown?" Mycroft caught her chin with his finger redirected her focus.
Mycroft put Sherlock's tray in the dishwasher and dampened a flannel; "Fine. But you're both on warning."
"No. I'm s'iny."
, you come here right this instant!" Mycroft bellowed from the doorway of his and Greg's room.
"My? Bu'yee?"
Mycroft looked down at the other one; “Jawn, aren’t you going to wear trousers, lad?”
“An apology for laughing at him, for starters.”
"I don't have the power to mine every single detail about him, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised I don't know shit-all." Greg formed the ears of his elephant snowman and attached them roughly.
Mycroft cut one into soldiers and handed her half; "There you are."
"Do we have yellow bubbles?"
Mycroft chuckled as he flipped off the bedside lamp; "Counting your sheep before they hatch."
“Here,” Jawn pointed to an invisible spot on the bridge of Sherlock’s nose, making the little detective go crossed eyed trying to see his freckle. “And here,” he then traced his finger down Sherlock’s nose and to the top of a high cheekbone. "They are very faint, but I can see ‘em well. What should we name ‘em?”
“There had better be tea in this flat, children…ah!” There was a box of his favorite, right there at the front of the cabinet, still in cello wrap. “I’m going to buy you both a pony. And your Nana a yacht…and a housekeeper.”
Sherlock turned the plainly wrapped package over in his hands, his powers of deduction slowed from headache and days in headspace. And a concussion. Couldn't forget that bit.
"Ah, I see." The thought of their downstairs neighbor making homemade jam for her tenants was...well, it had a certain, 'domestic' charm to it. "Does she always make you lots of treats?"
"It was, for the most part."
"Fibs!" Greg blew a raspberry as him.
, Your Majesty!” he shouted mockingly at Mycroft’s back while Jawn stuck his tongue out and giggled as if it were the best joke in the world…then, he stopped.
Jawn rolled his eyes before picking up a pink crayon to begin painstakingly drawing a cherry.
"And you will." Mycroft sat the bowl on the counter. "Here," he said, placing an egg in Sherlock's upturned hand, and then leaned towards Greg. "Watch this," he muttered. "This is
"We'll need to fill out pots with dirt and flowers first."
"Just come make sure he doesn't roll...Christ!"
"That's quite a lot already," Mycroft said, keeping well back from the glitter.
He wondered if Sherlock could remember that, too.
"Not at you, sweetheart."
"And then we can frost our cupcakes."
He turned his head to the side and studied his poster of the periodic table, distracting himself with putting them in order by their atomic mass.
“Yes, fine. Up.” Mycroft released his hold on his baby brother and watched him bolt out of bed. “How shall we spend the rest of our afternoon?” he sighed...if only he still had that sort of energy.
And he...had
"Hello, sweet boy." Mycroft kissed the top of Sherlock's head. "That sounds like a wonderful idea. Go and finish your snack, please."
"And they are free to do as they wish. But..." Mycroft trailed off and stared into his water glass, slowly swirling the half-melted ice cubes around.
"Sherlock, come give us a smooch before I go."
“Gross!” Sherlock added.
"C'og." Sherlock nodded and scooped another, bigger pile of bubbles over his flower with his free arm, creating a mountain of flashing colors. "Y'ook, My'cob!"
She also refrains from killing him. In that, she is a decided improvement over my esteemed friend with whom I share rooms in 221b Baker Street, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
He stared deeply into my eyes until I could feel him piercing my very soul.
“Yes, yes,” he said as we moved briskly down the pavement. “I want you to come with me to the gaol. They won’t let me see either Wiggins or Dilly Mitchell, but they will let in a doctor.”
“I know. Which is why you can piss off.”
“Just to the kitchen.”
"Y'ah," Jawn said, his chest puffing up. "Sher'yock i'sh MY bay'bees, 'memeber??"
Sherlock moans as he hears John's words. He bites his lip and nods his chin up and down; he’d stay forever like this if it would please John.
"Midnight snack," Greg winked at Sherlock as he took the tray off his booster.
“Who said you were sleeping alone?” John asked, wrapping an arm around his middle and tugging him upstairs. “We’ll have a sleep and some takeaway, and then you can finish your experiments before your bath. Sound good?”
"Ba'ff?"
“Sau’shes are yum,” Jawn said with his mouthful.
The little detective nodded minutely.
Sherlock sat cross-legged on the couch, trying to lean to the side and watch what Myc was doing. When Mycroft stood back up, dummies in hand, he reached for them.
"NO!"
"No." Sherlock held his mouth open for another bite, eyes locked on the television.
"You nee' any'fings else, My'cobb??!!"
"The peanut butter is crunchy; that's good enough." Mycroft picked out the biggest chunk of crushed shell, still in the shape of the whole egg, and tossed it into the sink.
“Watson.” He stepped to my bedside. “You look a fright.”
Holmes coughed on his whiskey at that remark.
“You didn’ do a better job!”
"Right. So, with that in mind, do you really think Daddy is going to buy you a detonator set?"
"That's definitely true."
"Add that too the extensive list of things Gregory Lestrade doesn't know."
Greg picked up their bowls and led them out of the kitchen and down the hall; "If it's not on telly, it's on Netflix." Once in the sitting room, he threw down a whole mess of pillows and blankets onto the floor, while Sherlock stood and watched him as if he'd lost his mind; "...G'eg?"
"I di'id!"
"A cutie muffin-free zone then."
"I s'yee'b af'er is over."
Mycroft muttered under his breath as he fished his keys out of his pocket and climbed the stoop. "
"Is that why I can't come with you?"
"You've had three," Mycroft put the cover on the tray.
"Once we've had a bath, you can have as much juice as you please."
Jawn crowed as he caught the handle of the bucket and swung it off the top of the refrigerator. He turned and hopped off the chair, ignoring Mycroft’s proffered hand and cocked eyebrow.
When he realized that Mycroft wasn't about to let on any further, he sneered. "...I bet my copy of the Little Mermaid is in there, too," he muttered, and finally took a begrudging sip.
answered:
"Molly is going to use a regular cup this time, muffin. What cup do you want?" Greg asked, directing his question to her.
Mycroft turned around just as Greg came up behind him, wet towel still draped around his shoulders. " 'Course I'm back; did you think I'd skip out on cupcakes?!"
"And then we saw the tigers and one of the tigers was swimming! They were Bengal tigers, My!" John smiled at his laptop as he listened to Sherlock chatter into the mobile while he paced about the sitting room.
The house seemed smaller than I remembered. I think that is often the case with places from the past – they grow in your imagination beyond the boundaries of reality. But it was still a dark place. Dark and foreboding, the windows blocked from the world by heavy curtains, the front door painted grey, making it look like it was made of banded iron.
“Don’t cry, my lad,” I said, taking him into my arms and patting him. “Holmes will not fail you. You were one of the Irregulars. You know the worth of his methods. Think of all the cases he’s solved and all the miscreants he’s brought to justice.”
“Obviously,” I replied. Then I turned to Young Charles. “Do not despair, my lad. All will be well. The blackguard will be dealt with.”
"Don'd pin'ss my toes, p'ease."
Greg sighed; "Why d'yah have to say it that way," he mumbled, looking down at the floor.
"'No? But there are so very many other just as beautiful options.' Billy and Baxter began to scour the field for a new home for the fairy, pointing out the prettiest orchids and the fanciest lilies or the brightest daffodils,  but she turned down each new option. This one had 'too many petals', that one was 'too yellow'."
Jawn grumbled to himself, glaring in turns at Greg, the sun, and then Sherlock, who was busy making an elaborate castle for Ma’ti’ya the alligator. He imagined himself going over and stomping the tar out of that sandcastle. But Sher'yock would cry, like he
Mycroft smirked as he stripped Sherlock of his trousers. Smart arse little thing. “No, Jawn. Pick out something comfortable to wear to snuggle. I saw something green in the drawer.
Greg took his chance and scooped up the phone as Sherlock dropped it to cover his bum. "Not in front of the child, Myc."
"My be'yee y'ubs fros'ing. I'ds no'd u'bse'd."
Both Mycroft and Greg held their breathe.
!" Mycroft hissed back, and left.
"We're NOT hosing him. We'll just bathe him. And if he falls asleep during dinner, then he falls asleep. He'll live." Greg stood up and held the extremely soggy nappy at arm's length, then dumped it in the bin and reached for Sherlocks' hands. "C'mon sweetheart, bath time."
“That’s possibly the cutest thing I’ve ever seen,” Mycroft said, putting a sippy cup down in front of each of them.
“I should have left you both fuming at each other,” Mycroft muttered.
Sherlock blinked at them both, his hands over his mouth as he chewed on his thumb, and then dropped his gaze to the floor.
"Mycroft said you had a cast on your arm when you were teeny tiny."
"Poor thing. We're going to be taking it very easy today," Greg took a bite of his own sandwich.
Sherlock was on his belly in the guest-slash-sometimes-playroom, reaching under the bed. Then he scrambled back out, pulling a Tupperware container covered in stickers with him.
"No-no, muffin...let your brother do that part."
"Jawn jus' y'ikes cheese and roni's."
"Liiiike...hm,"Greg found himself struggling to think of another comparison; "...liiiiiiiiiike, glue and glitter!"
"Can you send a car around to Baker Street?"
“Now, I think with some rest this Triceratops--”
"Do you want help?"
"Who's still mad?"
"Y'iddle."
"I am not!" Sherlock whinged. "Where the fuck are my clothes??" Sherlock had emptied the hamper onto the floor.
““That’s not going to happen, Sherlock. I’ve no intention of leaving my little boy”
"Where?" Jawn wriggled, struggling to sit up.
"You're naked because you're not covered in frosting..." Mycroft put a bit of frosting on the tip of Sherlock's nose and chuckled when the baby went crossed eyed. "Now you're a cupcake."
"Y'ah," Sherlock mumbled. "They're a' bes'."
"Because I don't want you to hurt your mouth, pet. Do you understand?"
“You can have a bite, yes, but I’m not having that one.”
Sherlock held onto his cup and eyed the spoon warily.
"Okay. You can pick one, and then you can pick who puts it on."
Greg made a face. "That sounds terrible, given the circumstances."
"It's not a mess." Sherlock snarked, intentionally dropping a stack of papers onto the floor. "It's a very specific filing system." He shot her a wide grin as he pulled the box of markers from beneath a tea cup, up ending it and sending the last sip skittering across the desk.
Mycroft swatted a bare thigh with his fingertips. "Stop that. For the lavender one, we're going to try two red drops, then one blue one, and see what color that gives us. Can you do that?"
Sherlock is eager to please Daddy, and he takes the cock so quickly that John almost falls over the edge the second he begins. It’s a promise of what’s to come, Sherlock’s mouth is heaven. And as he sets in to do his job, John’s closes his eyes and leans back to enjoy.
"You ready to talk about the new rules, Pet?"
"If we do that, he'll fall asleep right in his plate."
Mycroft rolled his eyes. They were only a block away. Keep them moving.
"When he's feeling better, I want us to do this on purpose."
run," Mycroft reminded him as he let Sherlock out of the car. He did walk, but at a quickened pace. Mycroft sighed as he shut the door and followed, while the car pulled away towards the garage.
He could hear her stop in her tracks. "Yes, Mr. Holmes?"
"Clever boy, let's go see if our chips arrived."
"Yay, G'eg!"
Mrs. Hudson wrinkled her nose at him. "You'll keep your filing system out of my flat young man."
"What do we do?" Greg asked.
Sherlock took held onto Greg's wrist and sucked all the soup off the bread before biting down and chewing it.
"Indeed. One caramel, one currant. Try them," he said, and popped the lids off of each one. "Just the tip of your finger."
"Anything."
“You’re a right mess, aren’t you?” Mycroft asked as he leaned over and turned it off.
"I wan' y'oud ones!"
"Well either way, it's lovely."
“That phone would survive the toaster.” Sherlock called after her. When no reply came he spent a minute glaring at the table. Now that lunch had started to be prepared, he was hungry. And Grammy clearly didn’t love him enough to feed him, too engrossed in conversation about a real baby.
"It makes it two different toys! Puzzle first, then noise machine."
"Do we have to keep watching this movie?"
"They wings is y'ike dragon. No fea'vers. G'eg on'y use y'ibbon?"
"We'll see, buttercup."
“Jawn?”
"Okay, then can we pull up the footage on your computer and maybe see where he went?"
"Fucking Christ," Greg utters again and hurries over to Sherlock's chair. "C'mere, sweetheart."
Mycroft sighs. “Yes?”
The movie began and, no less than 15 minutes in...before the story had even really started, really... Mycroft was asleep.
"You're right, that's nothing to joke about. I apologize."
"Handle it?"
"I c'n do'id!" Sherlock's tongue peeked out of his mouth as he carefully poured the rest of the powdered sugar into the mix. "Sme' a'licious!"
Mycroft sighed to himself; so much for that being a distraction. “Alright, if Jawn wants to sit and stink all day, that’s fine...”
Sherlock was busy fiddling around with beakers and flasks on the kitchen table. They were mostly full of water and other harmless chemicals. John had not liked the idea of Sherlock playing with dangerous things while he was so far regressed. Sherlock looked up, his goggles falling of the bridge of his nose.
“Yes, well. Normal is boring.”
"Or the hose."
"Sherlock will make an honest effort to get eight hours of sleep at night," John wrote on the paper.
"You wouldn't be if you had eaten your dinner."
Sherlock blinked, then smiled at her around his thumb and tilted his head back to look up at Greg.
"Myc."
"You ma'ge fairy house wi'f me bu'd 'm no'd a bay'bee."
"Waiiii'! I s'uck! Halp!!!!" Sherlock wailed from the backseat.
“Yes, you are…I’ll give you that,” Mycroft said as he quickly scooted the little yellow detective off of his lap before he could whinge anymore. “So you must be smart enough to realize that you and Jawn are both going to tidy up in here. You can either make a game of it, or make it boring and tedious…up to you.”
"As much as Sherlock strives to deny it, he's a hot house flower. He takes care and maintenance. Which John gave up on providing."
“Uh-huh!” Sherlock sat up and dug into the pile of crayons again, swishing his hand around to make them rattle and clack against one another.
“Can I have my Hero one? And can we watch Hero’s, too?”
Jawn beamed with pride as he plopped his bottom back on the floor and took up his green crayon.
"How tight?"
"John," Mycroft answered, carefully." Checking on the baby."
Sherlock moans behind gritted teeth as John grips the flesh of his stinging cheeks and rubs. The pain of having his freshly spanked ass groped so roughly causes him to buck, trying to get some friction for his aching prick. "Yes... Daddy... please... do..."
will clean up this mess. Am. I. Clear.”
"Mm-hmm...those might be bracelets that end up getting 'lost'."
“Are you psychic now, as well?” The defiant tone in Sherlock’s voice was undermined by the faint blush underlining his cheekbones at the snapping sound the medical gloves made. John had conditioned him well.
"I y'ike d'is too. I kee'b id?" Sherlock fiddled with the ribbon curls on the box.
"Whatever you want."
"No one's trying to trick you, muffin."
"Can you give Jawn the phone? Can I ask Jawn?"
"C'n I ge'd in?" Sherlock already had one foot dangling over the water.
He looked his little brother's chest up and down...there was one great big dark, ugly bruise, right over the left side of his ribs, surrounded by an orbit of smaller ones which he could only surmise was from john kicking him...repeatedly.
Greg came back in and tossed the stuffed animal onto the bed within Mycroft's reach, then continued to the bathroom on the other side of the room.
“Would you believe that’s why I picked him out?” Mycroft chortled as he rose from his chair and dropped a kiss on the top of his brother’s head.
Greg turned and leaned back against the counter, with his arms folded over his chest.
look awfully content to sit in his older brother’s lap. And Mycroft, while still being his normal stuffy, proper self, doesn’t sound as nearly condescending as he usually does. And John is starting to feel a bit left out.
. "Bugger," he muttered, and waddled over to the cabinets to start rifling through them.
Mycroft scrubbed a hand over his face; “...What’s the record in this flat for most spankings in a day?”
"Quit snorting in my ear," Mycroft said, batting him away.
"We can't have birthday cake without candles," Mycroft griped as he sifted through rolls of tape, bits of wire, and pen caps with no pens once more.
"And you're egging him on!"
Both Mycroft and Jawn let out a deep sigh of relief; it was the first quiet moment they’d had since…well, since naptime ended. “What’s the Captain’s power?” Mycroft asked, absently patting Sherlock’s bum with his free hand
"Molly Hooper will be here in roughly 20 minutes if you'd like to put on trousers."
Sherlock rubbed at his stingy scalp and pouted as Jawn sprawled on Mycroft. Without the immediate attention available on Mycroft’s lap, he quickly became bored of Jawn’s dumb book and wondered to the toy box. He’d use his action figures to play out his own story. No crayons allowed.
"Why not?" Greg ushered Sherlock out of the nursery, limping along behind him while the blood returned to his feet.
"Don't ever say 'easy peasy' again."
Greg reached over and pinched Sherlock's ear. "You're a brat."
"Ouch! My ears!” Sherlock giggled over his own joke, ignoring the pointed look Mycroft sent him.
“Dino'rawrs, My'coff!” Sherlock peeped, waving his tiny bubble wand at the screen.
"Of course they're yours. Gregory was talking about the mountain of other stuffed animals we have." Mycroft set Sherlock's cup on his tray, only for it to be immediately snatched up again. "Slow down, darling...you're going to make your belly ache."
"Thank you," Mycroft said, running his hand back over his thinning hair. "Why don't you stay for lunch, Molly? I'm sure Sherlock would love to have someone else to talk to, for once."
"Yes, please."
"And you're not going to," Mycroft said, trying to urge him along again. "But we're going to do something about your shoulders."
"My eyeballs?"
Even sniffling hur'd. Sherlock took the pills and swallowed them with a sip of milk and a grimace. "I ha'd i'd."
Sherlock froze, mid-chew, and went an extra shade of pale....even his sunburn looked a little peaked. He leaned over his plate and let the rest of the half-chewed pasta fall from his mouth; " 'm not hun'ree anymore," he said, leaning back against his seat.
"That's a good choice; that one's my favorite." Greg took the box from him and poured a small handful of cereal into the bottom of the big, metal mixing bowl.
Sherlock stopped at the drawer that held his and Jawn's bibs. "I y'am no'd!' he protested as he grabbed the first bib on top.
"I c'n ha'b yo'r cu'bca'ge?"
"Pur'ble," Sherlock pointed at a pair of especially gaudy clip on earrings.
"Jawn..." The tone of Greg's voice was a warning. Jawn wasn't going to get spanked right now, but taking his medication was non-negotiable.
“Yes, but why was it naughty, Sherlock?”
"G'een?" Sherlock pulled away to look at Mycroft.
“Awwww, I wan’ come wi’f you!”
“No. We are going home.”
Jawn reached back and patted his own bum; “P’ease?”
"It's easier to clean cereal and milk off the floor, y'know, in case of an accident."
A short time later, Mycroft slipped back into the room; two teacups and their saucers balanced precariously in one hand, and a nappy and baby bottle in the other. "Did he give you much trouble?" he whispered as he carefully set down one teacup on Greg's side table.
Mycroft’s hand stilled on his brother’s bottom. “Sherlock!!!” he shouted over all the noise. When Sherlock continued to wail, he pinched his thigh.
Sherlock grinned and baby-clapped for her. "Yay, Maw'yee!"
"You only fuss when someone else does that?" Mycroft asked, popping a noodle into his mouth.
"I'm going to take care of you too."
Sherlock flopped down on the bed, fuming. His bees weren't stupid. Jawn was stupid. He and his dumb frogs could just stay down there forever.
"They are, but you have to clean up first. Don't want your new treasures covered in frosting."
"M'nod." Sherlock winced as he pulled himself up, even with Greg's help.
Mycroft felt the corner of his mouth twitch; no, he couldn’t say THAT. “…And that’s anything new?”
"What?"
"You want to help frost?"
Mycroft frowned slightly. Jawn’s skin looked a redder than it had at the last change. “How long were you wet, little boy?”
“I was terrified about that bit to start. What John got out of it. Then we switched roles once and it made sense.”
Greg held out his hand and Sherlock gladly took it. "Da'yee sayed tha' manners is b'ery import'ed."
"No need for that here. Sherlock's in the sitting room with Gregory."
“Don’t speak with your mouth full please.”
"I dun' y'ike it, G'eg."
“I think you should go get the naughty stool and have yourself a seat until you remember how to talk properly to Daddy.”
"Can you play the ukulele?" Greg trailed his nose down the curve of Mycrofts' neck, then came to a stop at his throat.
“Say it again, where we can hear you.”
Sherlock grinned at all the praising, letting thin twin lines of soup dribble from the corners of his mouth.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. "C'ack!"
"Listen to your brother," Greg said, scraping the bottom of his container for the last bit of curry and rice.
“Right. Wait, what?”
"You don' nee' my hel'b!" Sherlock tried again to wiggle out of Greg's arms, and started to cry when it became obvious that he wouldn't be getting free. "S'obb'i'd, G'eg!"
"Oh god Daddy, so tight...so deep, could fuck you...unhhh." Another slap and Sherlock finds himself losing pace with his thrusts. His hips jerking wildly as Daddy presses hard into him and he presses all the harder into the mound of silicone in his fist.
"You don't have to sleep if you don't want to sleep." Greg kept a hand on Sherlock's back.
Greg looked up at Mycroft through his lashes; "...What do you own in Soho?!"
"You said you'd eat noodles if I ordered them."
"Gently." Mycroft intercepted and took it from him before Sherlock could get it into his mouth to chew off the cap.
"Where's Jawn, sweetheart?" Sherlock pointed to the nursery, and Greg jogged past him down the hallway. "Jawn?!"
“You’ve had some naughty behavior. You are not bad,” Mycroft corrected. “What naughty behavior are you in trouble for?”
Telly time and takeaway went over with only minor problems. They hadn't sent along enough malt vinegar and Sherlock was seconds away from a strop when John found some in the cupboard. Once Sherlock had eaten, with John only having to coax him once, they moved to the unpleasant task of tidying up the kitchen.
"Then why are you--?!" Greg started, then huffed and sat back down as the fuzzy feeling in his legs intensified the moment he tried to take a step.
"You can't be naked while you make cupcakes."
Greg took his hand and kissed Sherlock's fingers. "He must actually be hungry if he's this insistent, y'know?"
“No. I winned. I a'ways c'ean a’ kitchen. Your turn.”
" 'm no'd a p'ish, G'eg."
"Hmm. I'll be home shortly." Mycroft ended the call.
"...Oh," Greg said again.
"Aww jeez," Greg huffed as Sherlock made puppy eyes at him. "I'll be 'goo', too."
“Look’id, Sher’yock!” Jawn babbled excitedly as he showed off his new plastic-moulded friend. “He’s a shar’b tooth!”
"Well, let's go check anyway, because I can already tell you he's not in the greenhouse or the shed, or fuck'all out here," Greg snapped.
“…You’re only this cute when you know I’m not happy.”
“Nigh’time is for sh’eeseca’ge!" Jawn crowed, putting a lopsided bite of cheesecake up to Mycroft’s lips. “Hurry! The sau’sh!”
...Mycroft sighed, leaned against the counter, and hung his head.
"Maybe we can get some toys and have a lie in."
"We ha'bba ge'd shells ou'd now?"
Sherlock slid off the step and onto his hands and knees, then started to crawl after Greg...but after just two strides forward, he paused mid stride; "Owwwwwwwww'sh," he whimpered, and looked up at Mycroft with a wobbly lip.
“The box said it’s a ‘pocket pussy’, whatever in hell that means.” Sherlock mumbles into the duvet with a shrug.
"Order me a new pair then."
He watched to be sure Jawn went into time out as instructed before sitting at the table next to Sherlock, then added some vinegar to his own chips before popping one into his mouth. They were barely warm. Rotten kids messing up his lunch.
"I know for a fact there's at least five tiara's in there."
"My'cobb?"
“NO, that one’s g’een!!! You can’t have it!” Jawn was standing at one end of the table and leaning over it, his open hand thrust out at Sherlock. “Give back!”
Sherlock looked around, then pointed over to the cots he and Jawn used when they didn't sleep in the crib.
“That’s better.” Mycroft sat on the closed toilet lid next to the bath, and started to look through the massive bucket of toys. “And whatever I give you will be dried off thoroughly before being put away so it doesn’t mildew, understood?”
"That's right, muffin," Greg said, patting Sherlock's back. "You count as many sheep as you can."
“He was very much like he is now…” Mycroft smiled to himself. “Sweet and endearing and moody beyond words.”
“It didn’t land in the sink.” Mycroft slowly poured water over Jawn’s hair while gently working the shampoo out with his fingers.
"C'n we ha'b g'yitter, My'cobb?"
Greg gave him a careful sideways hug; "I know. I do too."
"You aren't sleepy,
"We need to get you a dummy leash...several dummy leashes. You're up to three lost ones a week." Mycroft rifled in the top drawer of the dresser and pulled out another two-pack of dummies. "Come along."
"Owww'sh? Mmmmm f'ree. Ce'bt when I ben', then is mo'."
"Y'ots o'b p'etty f'ings,' Sherlock said, beaming as he opened his purse and began to show Mycroft everything he had packed, while Greg caught up to them.
"Well, we certainly aren't gunna be putting any cupcakes in such a potty mouth."
“Sh’eeseca’ge!”
"When have I ever?!" Greg looked genuinely offended.
It's also the first time Greg's been able to see him since he's gotten home from the hospital. Yeah, John had told him that he'd hit him, and he thought "Okay, the boys had a scrap, Sherlock was manic, shit happens."
"That's very kind of them, but I don't need help bathing."
Sherlock startled. He’d been swaying on his feet, mostly asleep. “Hun’ree.”
"Myc'll have my arse if he finds out," Greg grumbled to himself as he pulled the cupcakes out of the fridge.
It didn’t seem worth it to correct Jawn, again. And if a sword would stem the water works…“Would you like to carry the umbrella, Sherlock?”
“We’ll see.”
"An' p'yay??"
"You eat your own food and take a break, y'ah toff." Greg scooted Sherlock's chair away from the table and sat down next to Mycroft, with the tiny detective in between them. "It's Greg's turn to play with the baby, isn't it?" he said, with a big grin plastered across his face.
"It's easier to say 'powdered sugar', isn't it." Mycroft picked up the bag of sugar that Sherlock had fetched earlier and tore the corner open.
John hummed his agreement as he fell into his chair, cuppa in hand.
Jawn reached back and rubbed the back of his head, mussing up his hair. “Tha’d, um, tha’d word you say’ed, um, you say’ed a ba’ word.”
“My tee’f is soooo c’yean righ’ now.” Jawn took the cup and swished the water in his mouth before spitting it out.
"No. We'll just rush up to the bath. Later."
"Yes," Mycroft sighed; "So did I, for a few wonderful moments."
Mycroft thought as he hoped he didn’t have to pick him up and carry him. “No, they won’t,” he said, trying to coax Sherlock along.
Sherlock thundered over to the table and threw himself into his seat, still eager to please. “I’m sitting, My’coff.”
“You should add’a choc’ate snowman! With a head fer’a cherry!”
Sherlock pulled back and giggled. "I y'ike b'obs."
"Blue."
"I y'ike d'is game."
"Yay!" Both Mycroft and Greg cheered and clapped. "Good job, muffin!"
Sherlock popped his thumb out of his mouth; "Wha'd kin' she was y'iving in?" he asked.
on the driveway."
Greg helped Sherlock get one arm into his shirt. "Finish your biscuit. Once you're dressed, you can have another."
Mycroft shook his head; “No, you can’t have both…it’s one or the other.” There was no chance he was letting them leave the flat with that thing in his mouth, but he let Jawn have the illusion of choice…for now.
"I figured." Greg rolled the nappy up. "But glitter doesn't make for good eating."
- Mycroft typed back (even if there was a part of him that wanted to tell John to 'fuck off' just as much as Gregory wanted to).
Mycroft paused; "Jawn..."
"I y'ub gra'by." Sherlock hesitantly offered Greg a filthy hand.
"Ary'el."
Mycroft gave his brother one more once-over, and replied to John with everything he'd just noted.
“My, My, My, My!” Sherlock cried, wrapping himself around his older brother like a sniveling little barnacle.
He winces as a second finger joins the first. John opens him up in a perfunctory fashion, there is no caress, no prodding for his prostate. Sherlock tries to settle into the rhythm. Once they’re joined it’ll be different, feel different. He bites his lip as fingers are replaced with John’s cock. He’s not open enough but he forces himself to relax, John won’t hurt him.
Mycroft took one and unfolded it. “Sherlock?”
"Awww. You can'nah p'yay wif me af'er y'unch?" Sherlock pouted.
Greg nodded and pulled out a bar of soap...no scratchy loofah tonight. "Do you like warm bums?"
"Nooo, dun' y'ike i'd."
"He's going to be sore either way, but he seems fine now. Just enjoy the peace."
"Se'ben..."
“Daddy; it’s very rude to interrupt my phone conversation. You tell me all the time.”
"I thought you were excited for them to go on vacation?"
" 'Course we didn't," Greg said without missing a beat; "...it's also for piss."
Greg threw his hands in the air;"I did no such thing, you fibber!"
"Something. Or someone," Mycroft glared at Greg. "I'm going to take a bath."
"Tha'ds Peanu'ds sea'd." Sherlock shuffled back and sat at the table next to Molly. "Maw'yee wan juice?" he asked, and slid over his cup.
Sherlock stared at him, breathing hard as his tantrum winded down. Jawn crossed the landing and wedged himself onto Sherlock’s lap, burying his face in Sherlock’s shoulder. “Don’t be upset. I’ll find your shoes, too.”
“Sher’yock said I had to pick my treasure from the top las’ time!”
He had to check and make sure!
"The boys have watched this movie no less than six times while they've been here. Are you really telling me you've never seen the end."
Sherlock nodded...if Myc'off said it, it must be true. He finally reached down and carefully plucked a Daisy that had several extra petals growing from the center of it by the bottom of the stem, the way he'd seen his brother do it, and placed it with the others.
“Oh, o’gay.”
"Love you too, Sherlock."
“No. But I like juice.”
Mycroft chuckled, and rinsed his plate. "Bring me the baby's tray, dearest."
“Choc'ate,” Sherlock mumbled, distracted by Jawn hopping down the stairs with the umbrella over his shoulder.
"Sherlock, sweetheart, it'll be okay." Greg had skipped the elevator in lieu of taking three flights of steps, then rushed to his car. "Now tell me...can you see if Jawn's bleeding anywhere? Did he hit his head?" Sherlock stuck his thumb in his mouth and shook his head.
"No! I need my pills and to go home!" Sherlock's voice broke on the last word; 'home', where?
"Come on, let's get you into the bath before I get into more trouble."
Sherlock reached for the elephant and squished it under his chin; "Mine."
"Though, that might have been easier for him to swallow," Mycroft said, and handed his little brother a second biscuit.
"Do you remember when you last took your medicine, hm," Mycroft hummed, lips still pressed to Sherlock's forehead.
"Hurry back. Sherlock needs a cuddle."
Jawn obeyed, slowly.
"Hey!"
"B-bbax'err n-n-ne'b-ber..."
"M-My'coff?"
"You swear'd!"
“I’m glad that you feed each other up,” Mycroft said. “Bum up.”
"A little bit, huh." Greg began to slowly pour water down the back of Sherlock's head. "That's better than not at all."
“G’een!” Jawn said, nodding and bouncing on the balls of his feet.
Daddy says, tugging lightly on his ear.
"It is fine. He'll just go back to sleep when we're done."
Sherlock shook his head and stuck the spout of his nearly-empty cup back into his mouth.
"Yay, you did!" Greg cheered as he ran his fingers back through his hair to brush the dirt out.
Mycroft sighed; "I know. But, John is still family. Just as much as you are."
John glanced in the kitchen, and groaned. What a mess. Sherlock had meant well, but he was not looking forward to cleaning it up.
"Stranger things have happened."
“No, but I’m not fetching it out if you lose it under the refrigerator. Go ahead and pick, Sherlock.” He was eager to put the bucket back up and remove the source of conflict.
Jawn turned his head just enough to peek up at Mycroft with one still-wide awake eye. “Were we ba’?”
"I'd feels g'woss."
"My turn!" Sherlock clapped, dropped to the floor, and then crawled down the hallway with a sea of neon pink taffeta completely obscuring him.
After dropping his armload of cups in the sink, Sherlock popped a free thumb in his mouth and joined him, coming to stand at Mycroft’s side and lean against him while looking down at the load of colorful little trinkets and treats.
"If only they'd filmed it in grainy black and white." Greg carefully brushed curls off of Sherlock's forehead; "He's gunna have a scar."
"Unlike speaking through a mouthful of food?" Mycroft asked dryly.
"I y'am b'ery smar'd."
"Good, because it makes you even moooore cute, which I didn't even know was possible!" Greg leaned in and kissed his nose.
"I'm b'ery s'rong!"
"Uhhh, the whole yard, your Royal Highness?"
Jawn clapped his hands before falling to his knees in front of the bathroom cupboard, rooting through a large bucket of toys. “I foun’ em!” he crowed, holding up two small nets.
Sherlock squinted at Greg before steepling his hands beneath his chin and surveying the yard. Greg choked on a laugh. The worlds greatest detective in a T-shirt and soggy nappy, with sand sticking to his legs.
“I don’t wan’ different clothes!” Jawn protested, letting his dummy fall from his mouth and bounce on the floor.
Sherlock looked ready to protest, but another smack on the leg sent him scurrying for the steps.
"In here, Molly," Greg called.
"Y'uh. Hei-hei is a goo' sh'ig'en," Sherlock yawned, his fingers in his mouth.
"After all of this? He'll be sick."
Mrs. Hudson rolled her eyes at the mess on the floor and the demand for chips. "In my flat we eat more than chips, Sherlock Holmes," She scolded, putting the bag on a chair at the kitchen table.
Sherlock leaned back into Mycroft’s arms, head tipped back. “Whisper, Jawn?”
Sherlock went stiller than a stone and stared up at Mycroft with wide, shocked eyes…eyes that started filling up as the rest of his face crumbled and quaked with what promised to be a massive squall.
"Col' stuffs s'posed be col'."
"Have some faith in my problem solving skills. If I can keep the U.S. from imploding under their own stupidity, I can keep our sheets clean," Mycroft smirked as he smeared nappy cream over Sherlock's shoulders.
"Dir'd. Y'ots of dir'd."
"Fall asleep sooner, and you won't notice."
A small laugh huffed out of Sherlock's nose, and the corners of his mouth twitched.
"What about slippers? You wanna borrow my monkey slippers?"
"She see'd i'd aw'rea'y."
"That's right, think about it...the only difference between them is that cupcakes have frosting."
"Soun'd g'oo." Looking as if his fit had taken a lot of energy out of him, Sherlock slumped back in his seat and held the stuffed elephant against him, his thumb rubbing along the trunk.
John gets up stiffly, psychosomatic or not his leg still hurts sometimes; and flips on the nightlight before moving to the door.
"Like this?"
“It’s not fair to make Nana clean up all of your messes either.”
"Not much of a conversationalist at the moment, huh?" Greg kissed his forehead again; "You can't let this happen again, sweet-pea. Old Greg's heart can't take it. You have to take as good a'care of yourself as I would. And this ain't it."
"Me? I'm not mad."
Jawn carried over his trash and put it in the bin, while Mycroft turned on the faucet at the sink and squirted soap into his hands for him.
Mycroft sighed; he’d said one scoop of ice cream each...but he hadn’t thought to limit toppings. “In a cup please.”
“Right, of course.” John rolls his eyes as he tosses the paper onto the coffee table and pulls himself up. Sherlock had been fiercely independent about using the toilet less than a half hour ago. “Let’s go then little man. Don’t want to have wet jammies do we?” Sherlock shakes his head emphatically before turning and trotting down the hall in front of John. Sherlock flicks the light on and moves to stand in front of the toilet, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
"Sauces."
"Poor muffin, can't catch a break."
"That's definitely not true."
Greg turned to meet his gaze, a skeptical eyebrow raised. "You think he's really going to go for that?"
“Let’s give that dirty mouth something to do, eh?” He says giving Sherlock’s head a gentle nudge.
Jawn pressed himself around Mycroft; he had to get to his baby.
"She's
Sherlock stopped tearing his bread into chunks and leaned forward; "Y'ah, p'eathe," he said, sucking melted butter and parmesan off his fingers.
“Sher'yock turn a’ pick the story?”
"I think they marathon Peeps Big World at this time of night," Greg leaned down so Sherlock could snatch his bunny off the bed. Mycroft remained tangled in his blanket.
"What did you order???" Greg 'helped' Sherlock into his booster.
Sherlock nodded. "Y'ah, those."
“Do so!” Jawn insisted, even as Mycroft reached under his chin and made him tilt his head back, anyway.
"No."
Greg sighed. "Poor love...d'yah wanna just pack a bag and go home first, hm?"
“S..sss...sorry, M-my..My’coff!” Sherlock stammered in between sniffles, his free hand going back to rub his stinging bottom.
"I swear I put it back on there tight."
"I don' y'ike d'is par'd."
“Jawn, Mon’gey. You a’posta p’yay wi’f me.”
Mycroft clasped his hands behind his head and closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath through his nose as his mind raced. Then, he exhaled slowly; "...He couldn't have gotten out of the yard. Not with you right there. Or Sherlock," he said, and then opened his eyes. "Let's check the greenhouse one more time, then we go look in the house."
"Yes it is," Mycroft agreed, and took out the parchment-wrapped, generously portioned slice of cake to put on the plate.
Mycroft chuckled and pinched Greg's thigh; "Prat. Come along then."
"How many eggs?" Greg interrupted, standing in front of the refrigerator.
He banged on the front door and Sherlock jumped, dropping his phone, then scrambled up from the floor and ran to open it. After fumbling with the lock and chain, Sherlock let Greg into the flat. Greg rushed in, nearly breathless, but immediately saw Sherlock staring at him, wide-eyed and shaking, and he tried to keep calm.
"Let's put a cupcake in this hand-" Mycroft carefully took the paper off a cupcake and handed it, candle and all, to Sherlock; "-and a present in this hand," he said, handing Sherlock the more-ornately wrapped gift.
"Make what, muffin?"
“I had quite hoped that you would be small for my visit, dear brother. We do get on so much better then.” Sherlock pulled a face at Mycroft before flopping onto the sofa, rolling so his back was to the room.
"Y'ah, g'yoves." Sherlock went to kneel beside her, and winced.
"Why no'd?"
"And the muffin tins."
Mycroft shook the bucket, moving some of the bottom prizes to the top in hopes of avoiding another scene.
Greg walked over and waited for Sherlock to crawl out from under the table before helping him up. "Right, noodles for everyone," he said, lifting the baby up and plopping him in his seat. "Keep your bum in your chair, muffin."
“We’re not buttoning it; you’ll melt.”
“What do you usually eat for snack at this time of night?”
"You have a disposal?"
"Which part of him hurts?"
"Yeah." Greg tightened the bow on Sherlock's trainer and patted his leg. "Can you go get Jawn's jacket for me?" Sherlock nodded, then scurried up from the floor.
Greg came back in with their kit and Sherlock sat up, curious. "P'yas'ers? P'incess?"
Sherlock took the spoon while Mycroft opened the jar. "Bi'?"
"My big, strong knight in shining armor." Mycroft unfolded one of their thicker bedtime nappies and laid it in the bottom of Sherlock's sleeper. "A bit of powder...and you can set him down."
"Gen'le," Sherlock agreed, watching Mycroft with rapt attention.
"Wan' res' wif' G'eg now." Sherlock corkscrewed out of his brother's arms and flopped himself down next to Greg...who was having a helluv'a time not looking smitten beyond words.
"Bax'er an' Peanu'd nee' p'yates, G'eg!" Sherlock whispered across the room.
"I go'd i'd, G'eg."
"Sea'gre'd," Sherlock nodded, letting Greg wipe down his hands.
Greg glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. "Don't rub your face, muffin."
"I carr'ee my bay'bee," Jawn said again, firmly, and held out his arms.
"I y'uuub i'd!"
"He's got a whole order to himself?"
Sherlock suddenly found himself wishing that he’d wee’d on his bespoke suit.
Greg looked up and was surprised to see Mycroft sitting in the back. "What are you doing here?"
"Tha's a fib, G'eg."
"Wouldn't be the worst mess that's ever happened in our bed."
"I'm no'd a bra'd. Mo' su'gar?"
Soon, the quiet got to be too much, even for a stubborn little pirate captain trying to make a point, and Jawn pulled himself out from under the bed and crept down the hallway wondering why he couldn’t hear anyone anymore. He peeked around the corner into the kitchen--Mycroft was washing something in the sink while Sherlock looked on from where he sat at Myc’s feet.
“…and we are going to go through the flat and find all of the hidden dummies and if you refuse to share your dummies with Jawn, then I’ll have to get him some of his own. And he’s not going to share with you since you haven’t shared with him." Mycroft finished cleaning the dummies and held them down for Sherlock. “Which one?” The little detective made to grab both, but Mycroft pulled them out of reach. “One."
“You didn’t break anything. Grass grows around the base of mountains.”
But Greg had no time to sit and sink back into his maudlin funk; Sherlock was there, tugging his hand towards the back door. "C'mon, G'eg!"
"I couldn't have my intellect and beautiful golden skin. God had to be fair." Mycroft sniffed.
Sherlock put a finger to his mouth while he looked over all of their craft bins, and finally chose a selection of various shells, plastic rhinestones, a bottle of gold glitter, foil stickers, and brightly colored feathers.
“Hey!” Jawn bent to pick up his dummy and turned to look up at Mycroft. “Did you see that?! He threw!”
Mycroft was at a loss. Sherlock had orchestrated this visit so that he and Jawn could build a relationship and now…
Mycroft fought another sigh...God, he was
"Is no'd? Wha' time s'id?"
"Jawn cas' a'morrow?" Sherlock asked around the thumb in his mouth.
His gaze zeroed right in on his little brother. "I told you
“Bu’d you didn’t hear me a’firs time!”
"Yes, you're very good at that." Mycroft took the bottle from Sherlock and leaned him up, patting his back. "And so Billy and Baxter went to adventure through the forest with a bit of red string tying them together."
"It's a lovely bed." John said over his shoulder. Sherlock made an effort to growl like Daddy, but even to his own ears it sounded more like a whinge than anything else. Sherlock settled for glaring at the floor instead.
"Yea. G'eg halp." There was suddenly a lot of activity on the other end of the phone, Greg shouting at someone Sherlock couldn't see.
“Yea!” came the reply in unison.
“I wanna help! I can help!” Jawn scrambled up and around the end of the table until he was kneeling opposite Mycroft, green crayon poised for action.
"John, that is unreasonable, nobody can make someone sleep." As John had predicted, Sherlock had an objection and was attempting to show his displeasure by thrashing around on John's lap in a desperate attempt to get up. John held him tightly, until he finally settled, his chest rising rapidly in quick, defiant breaths.
Greg took the baby's hand and walked him into the house and up the back stairs.
Sherlock shrugged helplessly. He knew well before he had knocked the stool down the stairs that he shouldn’t, but only because he knew it would upset Daddy. More and more he did (and didn’t do) a lot of things simply because of how Daddy would react. That had been true throughout their relationship, but seemed to increase since he’d been little.
"Is nice a'member f'ings you y'ike."
"It won't be me."
"Moana has sharp pokey fingers and isn't welcome in our bed."
"I had them from before."
"She's going to watch the movie from the nightstand. She can see better from there," Mycroft said, half biting his tongue to keep from laughing at Greg's gobsmacked expression.
Still hiding her face, Molly swayed from side to side, making the fringe fly out and swish against her knees.
"On second thought, I will have your fish with me in my bath," Mycroft took the fish from Sherlock and headed into the bathroom. "I'm going to show the fish what the stork saw while Gregory helps you with your toys."
"Heeeeeeey."
“Please.”
"From years of covering my own arse." Mycroft kept his eye on Greg. "You know," he said, "...if Sherlock does well in the crib this afternoon, he can sleep in it tonight as well."
Sherlock whinged behind his dummy and tried to snuggle closer.
"You din'na do i'd ri'de."
“You are a 100% welcome to waste time rechecking the shed, dear heart.”
“Stubborn little thing you are, always have been.” Mycroft used a finger to lift Sherlock’s chin up. “Jawn’s more than ready to forgive, but you have to be willing to say you’re sorry first.”
“Where on earth has that little beasty gone?” Mycroft reappeared in the entrance.
Mycroft ignored him. "Where did we leave your cup?"
"I, I, I w-wan', I w-wan', I w'an--" Sherlock snivelled and hitched as he laid against his brother's shoulder, trying to speak and catch his breath at the same time, and just being an overall miserable little boy.
"Yes Pet, I know. You've told me four times in the last hour," John murmurs as he sits on the bed next to Sherlock, running a hand over his fleece covered shoulder.
“JAWN! THA'S BAD! My'coff gunna be mad a’ you!” Sherlock shouted.
Mycroft nodded his head in Sherlock’s direction; “Go on; I know you want to.”
"Sea'gre'd p'yea bargain."
"Alright then?" He asked Mrs. Hudson, as he shucked on his jacket.
Mycroft set each of the pots down carefully as he watched the pair cross the backyard, and chuckled when Sherlock finally grew impatient enough to drop Greg's hand and dart over to where he was standing.
"One thing at a time. Sweetboy? Do you want some milk?" Greg touched the nipple to Sherlock's mouth and he automatically began to suckle, making a contented noise about the warm sweet milk.
“I…sometimes.”
Jawn looked amazed as he took the last bite of cheesecake.
"Nothing too spicy for him," Mycroft said as he stood up and brushed away the glitter that his little brother had transferred onto him.
Greg picked up Jawn's sunglasses and put them on him. "In a bit, I promise," he said as he kissed Jawn's forehead, and then laid back on his chair.
Jawn shrugged. He was a little boy; it wasn’t his job to keep track of these things.
“Very good, Sherlock. Eat your dinner.”
"B'wown G'eg."
"Then mo' bis'sit?"
"Y'ah."
"Like butter and toast."
“Oh!” Sherlock took the phone back, hopping on the balls of his feet. “My! They had hedgehogs! They were European Pygmy Hedgehogs. They’re an endangered species.” Sherlock stared at John’s fingers, tracing patterns in his palm as he pecked away at the keyboard one handed. “No My, ones at pet stores are African Pygmy Hedgehogs. I was gunna make a blog post about it but my laptop’s still on restriction.” Sherlock said, giving John a pointed look. “I’m not sure, but I don’t deserve being on restriction.”
"N'ahh, G'eg!"
"Nope. That's a perfect amount. Switch on the mixer."
"Choc'ate?" Jawn asked, sticking his greasy fingers in his mouth.
He ignored Greg again. "I'm going home."
Sherlock dipped a stick into a beaker of water and he stirred, making a loud, obnoxious clinking noise. He pretended to ignore John's announcement.
Sherlock giggled and bounced over to the sink, thankfully unbothered that his job had been taken from him. “No want cake?” he asked, feigning innocence.
"Billy followed the thumping and came 'round a tree, hoping that the thumping was Baxter...but no, all he and Sally found was a tiny squirrel thudding a big walnut against a tree. Billy was so disappointed, he felt like he might cry."
"You were supposed to wait for Gregory ON the bed." Mycroft had his arms crossed over his chest, while staring down his nose at the baby.
Mycroft carefully slid off his chair and sat next to Sherlock on the floor. The little detective’s lip trembled. Mycroft held his arm out and waited for his brother to decide what he wanted to do…before he could blink, Sherlock slid over and tucked himself at his side.
"Ohhhhhh...I dunno."
“Sher’yocks haaaaaaaa’des them.”
"No, f'ank'oo."
“I need help, Daddy.” Sherlock mumbles, making his best sad puppy face.
"Smack's hurt," Sherlock reminded him, wrinkling his brow.
"G'eg rea'yee not y'eave?"
"Gregory."
"C'nah ha'b cu'bca'ges wif'out fros'ing. That's s'gus'ing."
“Na’ all of ‘em,” Jawn protested. “Just when we bo'f little.”
“Shhh, I know…worst part’s over now,” Mycroft spoke quietly, then kissed his little brother on the forehead before putting a hand on his shoulder and making him lie back, stark naked.
Sherlock hurried over, his own cheeks tearstained, and crowded in on Jawn’s other side, surrounding him in snuggles.
Jawn frowned, crossed his arms, and stayed glued to the spot in the doorway.
!” Sherlock's knees buckled, and he melted to the floor.
"Oh." Sherlock settled back down and, now that his brother wasn't holding his hand, stuck his thumb in his mouth. "Ca' we go see 'im?"
Jawn pointed at a pile of rumpled green cloth across the floor.
Molly nodded, that made sense. "Sa'yee give out your pig'shur as her chris'mas car' las' year."
"Is c'ear." Sherlock shook off Greg's hand and crept into the nursery. He bent forward and whispered something to Jawn before softly kissing his hand (the only bit he could reach). Sherlock came back to Greg, glowing; "F'ank you."
"Molly?" Greg glanced over at Sherlock's bruised face. "Right. Good. Trousers. Can I have a sip of that?" He held his hand out for Mycroft's mug and proceeded to down the entire thing.
He gave sleeping Gregory the stink-eye and picked up both bowls to be carried into the kitchen, where he started himself a pot of coffee.
Mycroft followed them not a minute later. "He was out before his head hit the pillow."
"Ohhh."
“Where on earth did you get this thing?” John asks, poking at the toy where it’s dripping onto the sheets.
"There's only so many places in the yard, Gregory." Mycroft appeared in the window, leaning on the sill. "How many of those places have you actually searched?"
Sherlock looked especially smug. “I can have cherries on my whip creme.”
"Maybe we can decorate it with stickers."
“I’m waiting…”
Sherlock only wrinkled his nose at him while he chewed.
"Ya', I y'am."
idea what to say.
Sherlock fought to keep his eyes open, but he barely made it twenty minutes into the film. His mouth continued to work as if he still had a dummy.
Jawn nodded emphatically and plopped his bum In front of the bookcase.
“We’ll find it after the movie ends,” Mycroft said, rolling Sherlock at an angle onto his side so he could still see the screen and popping his bottle back into his mouth before there were any more complaints. The little detective grunted and tried to spit it back out, but Mycroft was adamant; “Finish it.”
"Tha'd doesn't coun'd!"
"Greg got in very much trouble." He swept some of the bubbles aside and filled the cup with clear water, then made sure the baby's eyes were still covered.
Sherlock shook his head as he chewed. "On'yee w'if Jawn," he mumbled through a mouthful of food.
John has stopped spanking, and his hand is trailing down his stomach towards his own erect prick. “Mmmm…. Daddy is going to touch himself….”
"Ca' I do it now?"
"Another tool never hurt. I'ma have a cupcake for breakfast," Greg said, headed for the fridge.
"I dun y'ike i'd."
"No."
“I y'ike dis one.” Jawn patted the puppy on his chest.
"Why on earth would you need glitter before?"
The little doctor startled and looked up.
With Mycroft following, Molly came in and gingerly sat down on the sofa near Greg, placing her bag on the floor at her feet. "Well hello, Sherlock," she said sweetly.
Greg cocked an eyebrow at him before glancing at Mycroft. The British government had a pinched expression on his face. "He was crying."
"You know you're not supposed to climb up there by yourself," Greg scolded lightly as he walked over.
"No. Cupcakes."
“I’m right about being wrong.”
“Wouldn’t she be so pleased to see that you’ve cleaned up your mess all on your own?”
Molly hopped up and scurried to the full length mirror on the closet door. "Oh! Is so b'ootiful," she touched it carefully. "Can you put the tiara on?"
"My'cobb is a model!"
“Oh.” Jawn stared ahead, puzzling it all out for himself. “But Sherlock’s big enough, inn’it he?” he asked, looking back up at Mycroft and wrinkling his nose.
Sherlock perked up. "C'n I ha'b some? P'yease?" he asked.
"We could move the crib into our room, if needed," Mycroft drawled, judging Greg's reaction. "But we would have the bed to ourselves again."
"Broked Jawn."
"There's nothing to discuss," Sherlock scoffed, his face twisted into a grimace.
"Jawn hurted."
They came to the pond within moments and scanned the shore, but Baxter was no where to be seen.
"Cu'bca'ges."
Greg stuck his tongue out at Mycroft the moment he looked away, making Sherlock giggle, which made Greg chuckle.
"We'll order some more." Greg whispered back, urging Sherlock onto the bed. The bedside clock read four thirty. Christ. "But not until seven."
"You don't want to go back in the garden and play in the water?"
He stands in the doorway for a second, just staring at him.
“Ohhh,” Sherlock whinged, putting his chin on the edge of the tub while he gave his duck the stink eye.
"Y'ah, My'coff."
"They won'd?"
"Luckily I don't intend to wear pants for the rest of the week."
"Then we'll make cupcakes."
Sherlock clears his throat, shifting nervously. "John..." He voice sounds smaller then he wants it too. "I feel that this sleeping thing is completely irrational... and I feel like we need to renegotiate the terms of our relationship... especially this bedtime bit."
Sherlock struggled to answer. He knew that anything he said in this moment would appear childish. How could he tell John he didn't like the word because it made him feel little when that was the whole idea? He continued to wiggle around; frustrated with how the ability to access his extensive vocabulary seemed to disappear when he was on John's lap. "I just don’t like it."
Mycroft had opened the frosting slicked packages and had Sherlock's toys laid out on the counter.
"Pffffft," Greg snorted. "You're just like your brother," he said, and kissed the top of Sherlocks' head. "Is it my turn again?"
Mycroft began to fill the mug. “You mean, when you’ve spent more than twelve hours
*the rest of the fic reads as a fic and not an RP cause we are amazing like that ;-)
"Wha'd?" Sherlock asked, his curiosity having been piqued.
Greg reached over and rubbed Sherlock's tummy. "Yeah, yeah, yeah...let's watch the movie, muffin."
“Bugger all,” Mycroft huffed as he turned and scooped the little detective up onto his hip.
He hugged his arm around his torso, feeling the tenderness at his side, underneath his fingertips, and made his way to the stairs. He went to step down on the first one and, for a split second, he hesitated and the clear phrase "no'd a'yyowed" flitted through his head.
Mycroft turned to find Jawn standing in the doorway…well, partly standing, partly hanging onto the door frame and looking apprehensive.
“No. I’m not going to bathe you in lettuce.”
“Not yet, he’s not.” Mycroft swatted a bare, wet leg, causing a yelp, then tore both sides of Jawn’s nappy open and let it drop to the floor. “Oh, God,” he groaned, looking away.
Sherlock stood in the middle of the kitchen, thumb still in his mouth, damp flannel hanging from his other hand. “I dun’ wan'a.”
"I'm so e'cited!" Molly let go of Sherlock to bunny hop behind Greg.
Sherlock shook his head.
Jawn took a step back, and stomped his foot. “But My! He needs it!”
“No I’m not!”
"P'ish!!! They's a'righ!" Sherlock dropped the end of his spring roll onto his tray and made grabby hands at his toys.
"Yusssss!" Sherlock clapped his hands and turned moon eyes on Greg.
"Like I said, your meds are on my nightstand. Are you going to sleep on your cot or do you want me to make up the guest bed?"
“Sherlock…”
Mycroft glared at him, then sighed as well. "You," he said, turning to Sherlock; "You need to do as you're told. Next time is a spanking, understand?"
"Oops. Greg said that would happen, didn't he."
"Ohhhhhhhh," Sherlock said, and beamed as he turned to Mycroft. "I know where's they are!"
"That's alright. No harm done," Mycroft bent and grabbed the cup, then put it on the counter next to the baby's hip. "Now we need butter and the confectioner sugar."
"Ha'b mo' cu'bca'ges."
"Never mind, we'll manage," Mycroft said, pulling a bib over Sherlock’s head and putting a breadstick on his plate. Greg looked up, about to say something else, and again hesitated when he saw Sherlock's tear-streaked face. He gave Mycroft a questioning look.
"Ob'bius."
“Do not!”
“Settle.”
"A'mon mu'ppin," Sherlock smooched Baxter's face. "Buh'bye, My'cobb. I y'ub 'oo. I see 'oo y'a'der!"
“Why come you have a sword?” Jawn asked, staring up at Mycroft in awe.
Now that he didn’t have his baby to play with anymore, the switch flipped and Jawn glared at Mycroft. “I’m not very happy with you.”
"Sage advice. Come on and get in; supper will be ready soon."
"I'm really never gunna see the end of that, am I?"
"G'eg a p'etty faerie."
"You'll have to ask Molly, muffin."
“As you can see, Sherlock is cranky and needs to be fed and then put down for a nap, so hurry along.”
“You can’t do that! You promised!” Sherlock cried, the fight going out of him as his shoulders slumped.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, “Which of you am I bribing again?”
Sherlock followed him docilely into the bathroom, holding his hand tightly. Mycroft wet a flannel and wiped his face, chuckling as Sherlock grumbled and tried to move his face out of reach. Mycroft untangled their hands so he could clean those as well.
"Yeah, muffin?"
Molly moved the stuffed elephant out of the way while Greg carried a protesting infant back to the table. "Noooo, G'eg, I wan'd down, down p'ease, I wan'd down, I wan'd help'oo, down, down p'ease!"
Mycroft smiled back as he stepped into the room, but his was much,
Sherlock moved to greet him, far more eagerly then he usually would, the card hidden behind his back. "Hi! Daddy."
Sherlock stood beside him, fingers shoved in his mouth, crying too. He'd forgotten about Jawn's arm for a moment as well. He hadn't even tried to stop Jawn from clapping.
Mycroft picked up his suitcoat from where it had been draped over the back of a chair and went to put it on, then paused, frowned, and sniffed a sleeve; “…How does this smell of baby powder??!” he whispered fervently, his nose wrinkling.
"Peanu'd nee's tea! G'eg! C'n Peanu'd ha'b tea?" Sherlock was back out of his chair and following Greg around the kitchen.
"An' je'yee."
"Yes. She's going to tell us how to help them heal properly so that you don't have any more ouchies."
"P'etty. I y'ike l'ellow. One mo' is four." Sherlock held up the bottle of yellow dye.
"I wan'd crun'shy cu'bca'ges."
"A' dun'? Cu'bca'ges now?"
“You do love Nana, don’t you?”
Sherlock sniffled and rubbed his hand under his nose. "Y-ou, no'd, n-n'od mad a'd m-me...?"
"I no'd sick, My'cob!"
“You are never getting a treasure again!” Jawn snapped, pointing a menacing finger at the little detective.
“Me too?”
"Everyone had better be in bed,
"Pan'a?"
Sadie: Mycroft hears him rustling about and tries to keep a sharp ear on him and pay attention to Jawn at the same time, letting the little doctor take over the story and read out loud.
"Now pour it into that cup there."
“Yea, sam’widge A’cause I’m star’bing. Sher’yock hun’ree?”
"I don' y'ike i'd."
Sherlock did a happy wiggle and held the egg over the bowl, biting his lip in concentration...then squeezed as hard as he could until it broke with a loud 'splat'. "I di'id!"
John pulls away with a disenchanting squelch, tucking himself away. He’s moving around the room with purpose, putting his clothes to right. It doesn’t make sense to Sherlock, but he hasn’t been given permission to speak so he keeps his head down and waits.
"What if I let you pick, muffin?"
"Then we're gonna get you in a nice, dry nappy."
"Yucky, indeed."
"Gregory is quite fetching," Mycroft winked at Greg who was trying to sift the glitter out of his hair. "Let's go inside and start some cupcakes."
Greg sighed and leaned back in the chair. He was getting too old for this. He sat there and held Jawn's bottle for him, pushing the chair back and forth with his foot...then, he felt a pair of warm hands close over his, and he smiled as he cracked an eye open and looked down to see Jawn staring up at him, hands clasped over his.
“Cudders?”
"I wan' se'ben choc'ate cereal."
If Daddy missed him, why did he leave him behind? Sherlock frowned. It was too big a thing to think about right now.
"Presents before cake?" Greg bounced the baby and then put him in his booster, scooting it close to the table as the tray was in the dishwasher.
