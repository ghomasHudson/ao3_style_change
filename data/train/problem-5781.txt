Fury paused for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he took a breath. “Before you take the mission, Rogers, I need to know that your loyalty isn’t going to waver. Stark can talk his way out of a paper bag, and his silver tongue has gotten more than one of our agents compromised before. If you went in there and did what we were asking for, are you sure that you wouldn’t lose yourself?” Fury winced slightly. “Because we would be expecting you to get… up close and personal with him, if you know what I mean.”
“Oh, but it’s your job to defend mine?” Steve asked sharply.
With another terribly smug grin, Sam handed it over. Steve pressed his hand over the button, before sparing all his friends a withering stare. “If any of you make sex noises when I answer, I’m burying each and every one of you. And yes, I’m looking at you, Barton.”
bias. Whatever.
Steve opened and shut his mouth a few times. “You sure?” He said quietly, “I don’t mind staying in the guest room for a few nights. I just… I just want you to feel safe.”
Peter gurgled in delight, fisting a hand into Tony's hair and tugging. He winced. "Ow, see? Why do you do that? What does that achieve?"
Steve rolled his eyes, peering into the lab that the group of scientists had just exited from. By the looks of it, it was entirely abandoned by that point, and so Steve didn’t bother much with stealth approach. “I don’t think I can just tell him to leave his billion-dollar company behind to come and speed up the job that we already have someone doing for us, Hawkeye.”
Steve just kept walking. He had a job to do now. And nothing on hell or Earth was going to stop him.
Of course, Steve didn’t even acknowledge him- simply placed his fingers against the hinges of the door and inspected it for a few seconds. Tony folded his arms and watched from his vantage point on the floor. Steve, feral or not, had a very spectacular ass.
“Indeed Mr. Rogers, apologies for the fright,” came the disembodied voice, and Steve squinted around, looking for a computer like the one in Tony’s room until JARVIS added: “I’m not attached to one hard-drive or computer down here. Unlike in Sir’s room, I operate through an external system running through the whole basement. Sir finds it especially beneficial when working.”
“There’s a chopper up top,” Hawkeye said with a curt nod, beginning to lead them off in the direction of the roof. Tony rushed along with them, but in his mind, he already knew what they would find once they made it to the Avengers Tower.
Steve tried not to think about it. Tony had said he’d come- so Tony was going to come. He hadn’t bailed for someone else’s party. He hadn’t suddenly decided that he actually hated Steve and wanted nothing to do with him or any of his friends.
They arrived back at Nat’s place fourteen minutes later, and by that time darkness was covering the city, the streetlights being the only thing to illuminate their path.
He didn’t even have the energy left to hate that.
Tony just shrugged, flicking Peter gently on the nose and sitting him up again. The kid smiled his gummy smile over at him, his hand reaching up for the arc reactor like he always did when he got level with it. He had a strange fascination with the thing. “Well, I don’t like my home to stink like shit, and it doesn’t seem like any of you other lazy fucks are gonna do i—”
Tony looked around the room, blowing out air and shrugging. “We have to hand him over to social services,” he said, looking at Clint’s twisted face and making a helpless gesture with his hands, “we don’t have any other options. We don’t know who this kid is, who he belongs to- whether he already has a family and a birth certificate or if he needs one. This is not our area of expertise, quite clearly.”
“Oh, that reminds me,” Darcy turned to Steve, who jerked his head back up and tried to recall what had just been said, “someone told me that you’ve gotten on the wrong side of Tiberius Stone. What did you do, dude? That’s dangerous territory to walk over.”
He carried them both back into the cabin, and on his way there an idea began to form in his head. It was rough and risky, but when he ducked back into the room and caught sight of the way Tony looked, he knew that rough and risky was going to have to do. They needed to get Tony somewhere safe, and they needed it quickly.
“You need’a stop checkin’ your watch every two minutes, buddy,” Bucky patted him on the arm heavily, halfway along the road to rip-roaring drunk as he sipped on one of the obnoxiously strong bottles of mead Thor had brought along and glared solemnly.
“It’s very misleading hair! Too- too blonde. And perfect.” Tony’s nose wrinkled a little, and Steve sat up indignantly, running a hand self-consciously through the too-long strands that fell limply over his forehead. It had dried funny, and he could feel the stupid kinks that had formed in the process, making him look like an idiot, no doubt-
And it felt stupid just to entertain it—Loki was a liar by birth and a cheat by nature, he’d do anything to get out of a fix, but… “I think I do. Yeah. I just have no idea what to do about it.”
On the couch, a head popped up and turned to him, looking his way in surprise. Steve’s face softened as his eyes met with Tony across the room, and his walking sped up while he heard Thor following behind him. “Steve?” Tony asked in surprise, “what… why are you…”
He shook his head, so Bucky instead handed him his own mobile from out of his pocket. “Well I do. I think you should call him. Ask if he knows what’s going on there. That- it sounds like a sort of… I dunno, I don’t want to call it that on a whim, but Rhodey might know more than we do.”
She at least had the decency to nod at that. “I never said what he did was right,” she told him, “and maybe I am trying to justify it, but at the end of the day Bucky still acted like a knobhead because of his own pre-conceived ideas about Tony and who he was as a person. I think we were all just freaked out by your disappearing act, to be honest. It was stressing Bucky out. Then he got a call from you an hour later saying you were fine, and you had been fine for what was obviously quite some time, but you were with Tony Stark? The guy we’d looked up on the internet and found a criminal record the length of your arm? And more than that; when Bucky asked to come see you, Tony refused to let us?”
Well. It was sad.
“I love you,” Tony told him, feeling something disgustingly similar to tears prick up behind his eyes, “I love you so much.”
“Never better,” Rhodey said softly. “You scared the shit out of me, man. You blacked out. Bruce said you’d wake up but, fuck, I dunno—”
There was a deep sigh, and then Steve watched Paul move his hand to the dial on the radio and turn it down a few notches. He brought his other hand out and placed it on Steve’s shoulder warmly. “How many times do I have to ask you to call me by my first name?”
Tony’s voice was filled with laughter as he pushed weakly against Steve’s chest, “I really have to go.”
Since their bare-all conversation during bath time just over a week ago now, Steve’s whole attitude toward Peter had done a 180. It had taken a little encouragement here and there, and Tony still saw the brief look of panic in the man’s eyes when Peter started to cry while Steve was holding him, but Captain America was nothing if not adaptable. It seemed that all he’d needed was someone to say that they trusted him not to mess up, and suddenly Steve was all over the little boy, picking him up and tossing him into the air easily with a huge beam on his face or helping out with mealtimes, ever-patient and collected even when Peter threw his mash potatoes all over the room.
News really traveled fast, huh?
“Yes,” Steve said, the word ending up pressed against Tony’s mouth, “the answer is yes. Obviously.”
“I like the cute ones. Those little kitten-types were nice.”
The trainers under his feet didn’t make a noise and he stuck to the walls, making himself as small a target as possible as he passed them on the opposite side of the street, but one of them noticed him anyway. Steve watched their eyes snap onto him; giving him the same analytical gaze he’d just given himself a few seconds previously. Instinctively, his pace picked up. He was past them now, walking fast down the lane, and they were just kids, dammit, it wasn’t likely they were going to start-
“Your dad hits you,” was all he said in the end, which really was terrible, because he saw Tony’s face just shut off completely, turning away from Steve and then beginning to start walking again.
“Oops,” Bucky made a face and then turned back to Steve solemnly. “Dude, I know you’re in love with him an’ all, but if ya want I’ll still punch him for ya.”
But Steve just held onto his hand tighter and then shook his head vehemently, his face sad and pained. “I promise,” he whispered, “I’m not going anywhere.”
Steve straightened slowly. “Yep,” he bit, “sorry about th-“
“No, sorry, I didn’t mean it… It was fine, honestly,” Tony waved him off, “honestly, genuine excuses to leave parties are great. You did me a favour.”
, Steve wanted to say, except his mouth didn’t agree with him, and so nothing came out. The world was fading around him, and he wanted to fight it, preserve this memory of having Tony holding him, but the urge to just
“Yeah, because we don’t need to—”
Tony had pushed too far. He should have just accepted Steve’s apology five minutes ago instead of being a fucking asshole and getting angry, and then none of this would have happened.
The faceplate lifted. Steve briefly wondered whether Tony would have had to stick his arm out of the window and wave it around for a little bit while he and Rumlow had been fighting in order to find a signal. That would have been funny to watch. “Alright. Okay, just hold on, Steve. I’ll get you out of here, I promise.”
“You said you wouldn’t have sex with me ever again if I didn’t protect you from his wrath when he found out, and I told you that you couldn’t go more than four days without me. You agreed, and said I had to protect you anyway. I did, because I’m a pushover for you in the mornings. Well, who am I kidding- I’m a pushover for you all the time.”
Tony looked out of the window with bleary, wistful eyes. “Do we have to go?” He said quietly. “I could buy us a place like this, if you want.  We could just… I dunno, be farmers.” His head turned and he smiled bashfully over at Steve. “What do you think?”
Tony’s smile warmed him. His hair was dusted with grays, and the glasses sat wonky on his nose like always. ‘You can’t stay here forever,’ he muttered with a fond roll of his eyes, tucking one of Maria’s little strands of hair out of her face.
Steve gave an audible laugh, walking forward and then bending down to press a kiss against Tony’s forehead. “Whatever you want to believe, sweetheart. Just try not to get shot.”
“Wanna stop off and get donuts for breakfast?” Steve asked him when he hopped into the driver’s seat, and once Tony nodded in agreement, he hit the gas and they were gone.
Meryl Streep. But right now Peter might as well have just recited an extract from Jane Austen by the way Steve was reacting to it. Tony figured that poor Meryl now paled in comparison.
he mouthed wildly, stumbling back as she began talking.
Steve pushed off Sam and turned away, starting to march down the street. He paused, in order to point a finger over to Bucky. “You- you leave me alone, you got that?” He yelled across the road.
God, Steve was smitten.
He cried as he shoved all of his shit into the single suitcase that he kept under his bed for business abroad. Didn’t stop for the whole hour he packed, and with each item put in, he felt a different piece of him break. Everywhere he looked in his room, bits of Steve begged him, pleaded him to stay. Pictures of them hung on the walls. Steve’s shirt that Tony wore more than him. The sticky notes Steve left on his desk sometimes.
"There was nothing you could have done," Tony tried to tell him when Steve was sent home on leave, hastily brushing the tears off his own face in order to try and lessen Steve's own sorrow. "She made her own decisions, and you aren’t God. This wasn’t your fault."
Steve smiled wetly, breathing in a long mouthful of air before he gently pressed the wipe against the blood that had crusted over his face. He felt physically sick at the idea of them just leaving Tony on Thor’s couch when he was concussed rather than getting him to a hospital, but he couldn’t in good conscience go against Tony’s pleads. No doubt Tony was already in trouble as it was; Steve didn’t know how much worse things could get if he got Tony to a hospital and subjected him to the cameras of the general public.
Tony harrumphed and folded his arms. “Yeah, unlikely,” he muttered, sharing a look with Steve. Steve just smiled at him and shook his head fondly, eyeing up Thor as he tipped the entire box of cereal into his mouth, creating a mountain big enough that the God could hardly even get his lips around it. “Thor, why are you even eating cereal at 4 in the afternoon?”
“No,” Tony said again, focusing as best he could on Steve, “I can’t… even if they do take H’ward ‘way from me, I’ll go t’Obie. Godfather.”
, guys?” He asked after a second, “you all know my rule about double digits before consciousness. Not cool.”
“No, seriously, what are you smiling at?”
“Okay, well let’s not start putting those sort of pressures on the kid
who had everything? Steve wasn’t gonna lie; he was shit at thinking of gifts to give people. He was also laughably broke, which didn’t help either. All in all, birthdays and Christmases were just big disasters that usually ended up with one bashful Steve, one bag of his friend’s favourite candies and the promise to act as their slave for one chosen day. Bucky and Peggy were used to that- Bucky and Peggy expected that at this point.
ready to deal with that level of emotion-fuelled dramatics at seven in the God Damn morning. He hadn’t even had breakfast yet, for goodness’ sake.
Thor didn’t say anything to that; just smiled and then looked out of the window again for a little while longer. Darkness had fallen fully by that point, and New York was lit up by the Christmas lights and buzzing shops that seemed to never shut. Steve watched them too, letting it all pass him by in a blur until Thor spoke again a few minutes later.
The sigh he’d been in the middle of drifted slowly into a sheepish smile when Natasha nudged the boy’s foot and then muttered something to him, nodding over at Steve. He watched Tony turn, spotting him through the crowds a second later. When his eyes softened and his mouth turned up, a really uncool part of Steve wanted to speed up his pace just so he could get there sooner.
“He… he gave me my birthday present,” Steve turned to look at Bucky then, hand curling subconsciously around his phone. Bucky began to frown at the serious face Steve was making, but Steve just shook his head, a silent gesture for him to wait a minute. “It was beautiful. Really, he… it was amazing.”
When Tony looked over to him, his face was pained, like the words hurt. “I’m out. But I’m not out in those circles. I’m bi. But I’m not bi in their eyes. Not in Howard’s eyes. Jheeze- in Howard’s eyes, his son would never do something as disgusting as that. He turns his head and looks the other way when he sees the blurry paparazzi shots. And I never,
“What else would I do?” Steve replied, kissing Tony’s temple softly, “I couldn’t just leave my best fella to struggle alone, could I?”
The teacher eyed him up; watching the hopping feet for a second before sighing. “If you’re quick. Pass is on the desk.”
He realised now that it probably had. It had been hurting Steve all that time, and Tony had just continued to be an asshole about it. Like he always was.
“I know,” Steve said, and he could feel the burn behind his eyes as he stood up jerkily, knew that if he stayed any longer Tony was going to see him fall apart, and he couldn’t put that on him, not now, “I know, it’s okay. I just need a moment. I’m sorry. I love you. This isn’t your fault. I’m sorry.”
“Oh, be quiet, you donut,” Rhodey chastised, smacking him delicately on the chest, “you don’t need to keep it together. Not for me, or anyone.”
He thought of Tony’s morning smile. His frustrated frowns. He thought of how Tony always greeted him with a kiss on the cheek when he slipped by him in the kitchens. The way his voice drawled in a New York accent, or how it went softer if he spoke French, Italian. He thought of their first anniversary when they’d been trapped in a cave and wondering if they’d ever get out, and Tony had drawn a love-heart in the dust and told him sadly about his plans for the night, now ruined by their impending doom. He thought about the way Tony could shout at him so hard it felt like glass might shatter, and how he touched Steve like he was the most reverent thing in the world, and, strangely, he thought about the weird mole on his shoulder that Steve always checked up on every few months to make sure nothing funny was going on with it, because you could never do any harm in monitoring those sorts of things.
“I’m sorry,” Tony had blurted out the apology almost immediately afterward, however, swallowing and shaking his head, “sorry, I didn’t… that was out of line. I need to cool down. We both do. I’m gonna…. Workshop.”
It happened in less than a second.
“Oh, shut up Tiberius,” Thor interrupted with a roll of his eyes, kicking up his legs and resting them on a spare seat as he folded his arms and glared up at the other boy, “just go watch the fight and leave Tony alone. You heard him the first eight million times, right? He isn’t interested.”
Tony paused, and then just shrugged, looking down at his screen. His shoulders were a little tense though. “That’s… just what everyone else says. Said. Whatever-“
He got started with the ring design that same morning, curled up in the wicker chair at the front of the porch and watching Steve chop wood a few yards away, those glorious abs sticking to his thin wifebeater as he sweated from the exertion.
“You won’t,” Steve promised, “I’ll come straight back. Tony, if we can get the stones… if we can grab that gauntlet, then there could be a chance that we can bring everyone back. There could be hope.”
The room erupted in yells and cheers, and Steve’s eyes widened in shock as Tony jumped off the table and slid down until he was able to throw himself at Steve, burying his face in the other mans shoulder and gripping the fabric of his shirt so tight his knuckles were white. “Yes, yes, yes, holy shit, I love you Steve, yes-”
He wasn’t sure how long it was going to take to weed them out of whatever little dungeon they were hiding in, and until then it was simply a waiting game. A question of who would move first- AIM trying to take Peter back, or The Avengers trying to take AIM out. One thing he knew for sure though, was that was that it wasn’t going to be the former. Not if Tony had anything to do with it.
“Yeah? Much as I hate to say it, you’re bruised pretty often, darling,” Tony responded, looking at the little spots of blue that littered his arm more closely. Then, of course, the penny dropped and his eyes widened. “Wait a second,” he looked back to Steve, “did Peter do this?”
Steve glanced up for a second, blushing just a little. Sam gave him one raised eyebrow before sighing in despair. “Man, I can’t even blame you. Math can suck my ass, none of it makes any sense to me.”
“There’s really not much else to say. What you’re looking at now is just three years of the same old shit. Think Howard just gave up on me after a while, which isn’t so bad. He doesn’t scream so much any more- just ignores me. I go to public school like everyone else and pretend I don’t see equations everywhere I look, and when the ideas get too loud, I go to the nearest party and get a hit in whatever form I can find it in. Usually a bit of Ket does the trick, but hey, I’m not really fussy as to what drug I use to get high. Sometimes sex does the same thing. When I’m feeling
“Steve,” someone—Bruce, Bruce, that was who—said calmly, firmly, “breathe. Take in your surroundings. Do you know where you are?”
All of them kept walking. They were going to go around the corner in a few seconds. They weren’t going to listen.
Steve yelped, cheeks flaming as he looked for something to throw. When he found nothing, he simply chose to give him the middle finger, which Sam returned fondly.
There was a long silence, only Steve’s breath filling the room that he had turned away from. He didn’t think he could bear to look at any of it.
It felt so wrong. Yesterday everything had been—well, not fine, but manageable—and now Tony had nothing. Not even Thor’s place was permanent, and Steve would offer, but there were no spare rooms in Sam’s place, and he wasn’t sure whether the Wilson’s would even be able to afford another mouth to feed. He knew things were already tight for them.
“Well I fucking want them back, I want to go to sleep.”
Steve huffed and jerked free of the obstruction, and then caught Tony just watching him, eyes soft. Aware Steve had spotted him, he quickly shook his head and turned back to Natasha and Clint’s continued argument, but whilst he watched them, his hand found Steve’s on the table and his fingers started tracing lines into the back of his palm absent-mindedly. Steve smiled again. He loved when Tony did that- the thoughtless contact, the easy touches- it was… it was nice.
And then, without warning, Tony shot an extra twenty feet into the air. He yelled in surprise, unaware that he’d even been commanding the suit to do such a thing- maybe it was about body posture, except he still couldn’t fucking remember, shit, he was forty feet up now and counting, how the goddamn hell did he pilot this thing-
Steve couldn’t let him go home. This was it now. He had to make a choice, and he couldn’t let his heart rule over his head. That would lead to disaster on a global scale.
He looked down at his chest, and made a choice.
“I don’t have anything on me,” Steve lied grimly, continuing to walk down the road, “I’m not worth that trouble you’re gonna get into.”
“Nope, you’re hearing it.”
He was correct.
And that was that. Argument over. A little uncharacteristic of Steve, admittedly- Tony loved him to death, but if the man got himself worked up over something, he tended to stew on it. However Tony wasn’t exactly complaining; as soon as they’d gotten into bed, Steve rolled closer to Tony and then licked the champagne out of his mouth, made love to him fast and rough, moaning Tony’s name as he came in the most beautiful way possible. The next morning, Tony woke up with Steve’s arms wrapped around his midsection and his nose buried into the back of Tony’s neck, and it was all perfect and fine. Steve didn’t bring the argument up again, although Tony quietly made sure to get JARVIS to inform Steve if ever he was going to be running late for things. If it’d make Steve happy, he didn’t mind.
before he caught on and nodded in understanding.
, it would be like… i don’t know, rolling a dice a trillion times, and having it land on the number two for each and every one of them. That’s how unlikely you are just to begin with.”
Steve laughed and then with a final kiss, he turned away and started walking up the sidewalk, hands in the pockets of Tony’s leather jacket. It was a little big on him, and hung loosely over his shoulders, but still… he looked good.
Tony just patted his shoulder gently from over the couch, wincing when he looked at the screen for too long. How Thor could deal with watching something so bright in a room so dark and not go immediately blind was beyond him.
“Well, we can’t have them feeling
And that was when the punching began.
They both laughed quietly, and Steve leaned back on the couch, looking sideways at Tony. For a fraction of a second, it almost felt normal. Any other night they’d spent together on the couch at Tony’s place, whiling away the hours in one another’s company and talking shit about their friends.
“Cigarette?” Tony asked suddenly, digging a hand into his pocket and pulling a pack from inside.
(In his sleep, Steve sighs and rolls on to his back, pulling Tony along with him so his head is resting against Steve’s chest like it’s a pillow.)
“Hey, Tony?” Steve said, turning to him. Tony already seemed a little further away once more; aware that Steve had to leave, and knowing that he’d probably end up wandering around on his own again. Jesus- the guy didn’t even
Then he heard Steve come in again.
Tony didn’t even bother looking at them- just grinned cheekily and then nodded. “It would be my pleasure,” he muttered, before lunging forward, grabbing the back of Steve’s legs and lifting smoothly. Steve went with a yelp, hooking his legs around Tony’s waist as the other boy leaned up and slotted their mouths together messily. There was a sharp thud as his back hit the door, and he tried to hold back a manic grin as he wound his hands around Tony’s neck and kissed back with enthusiasm.
“And considering the fact that you’re pretty difficult to bruise…”
-And then, without warning, he bent low and shot an uppercut to Tony’s stomach, hard and brutal and enough to knock the air right out of his fragile lungs.
Steve jerked, feeling his cheeks heat up again. “No I’m not- I- how do you even
“Son of a Goddamn bitch,” he breathed, leaning back on his desk chair heavily. It took about ten seconds for him to process the video, the words, the amassing trepidation and realisation of how fucked they all were, before he leaned forward again and quietly fired up his computer.
But maybe it was a good idea. Just to see threats coming through. Any threats, not… not just Steve.
In fact, he was only even aware he’d fallen asleep when he had to open his eyes again a few hours later, thanks to Steve shuffling around on his shoulder. The man was fast asleep, one hand thrown over Tony’s middle, legs curled in underneath himself. He looked peaceful, and his face wasn’t tight. It made a nice change.
He swallowed, blinking rapidly and checking the clock. He could just call it an end to the lesson, really, it was pretty much over. And that particular question was currently hitting a little too close to home for him to be comfortable with it.
Tony broke off, looking behind him at Bruce, Thor and Natasha, all of whom were now glaring daggers at the pair of them from the other side of the room. “I saw your heart-rate spiking on my tablet and thought you were in trouble. We all came running to your aid,” Bruce told him, unimpressed, “turns out you just can’t keep it in your pants for more than five consecutive minutes.”
Steve’s mouth opened in nervousness, but Tony’s response, surprisingly, was completely fluid, and his voice calm. He sounded unbothered and nonchalant; entirely different to the wild panic that Steve had glanced in his eyes before he’d been hauled out of sight. “Just jumped onto the bed and knocked the desk. Thought you were still with Obie?”
Bruce sighed and rubbed his forehead. “
Tony was busy braiding Maria’s hair gently, a skill he’d picked up as soon as they’d taken her home, and didn’t hear the words come out through Steve’s phone. He felt the way Steve tensed up underneath him though, and turned in confusion, immediately analysing Steve’s face and sitting up straighter. “Maria,” he said easily, “go get your jimmy-jams on. It’s getting late.”
His heart lurched. “I intend to,” he reached out and pulled his jacket off the hook, swinging it around his shoulder, “God help me- I’m on my way, don’t die until I get there.”
Tony blinked at the sudden change of pace, checking his hands. Steve always noticed when they were shaking. “Fine,” he said, shooting Steve a reassuring smile, “just… kinda stressed, you know? What with—” he waved an absent set of fingers through the air before running them through his hair, “everything.”
Too late. With a metallic groan, the robot snapped the wing clean off and then threw the rest of the jet sideways wildly, and Steve felt the nauseating lurch as he was tossed around like a leaf in the wind. He couldn’t see anything for a few moments, but then there was a tremendous crashing and his whole body snapped sideways, only kept from smashing against the walls by the safety belts he’d wrapped around himself beforehand. Steve cursed violently, pain erupting across his forehead as something sliced through it- rubble or debris from the ship, probably. He couldn’t see or hear a thing as the jet tumbled, dragged across the concrete of the street by the momentum, and just held on tight while everything fell apart around him. He thought he could hear Tony’s voice through the speakers, frantic, terrified, but he wasn’t sure whether that was just in his head or not. All of it was blurred into one.
Barnes, what did I tell you?”
” Steve pleaded with him, running his fingers across Tony’s collarbone and then pouting, “I wouldn’t ask you if I thought it was going to be detrimental to anything in the long run. I’m a strategist, remember?”
“You really do. I think it’s the height. And the hair.”
“Steve!” Tony called again, and there was someone else, someone else calling too- but his eyes were clenched shut against Tony’s neck, and he couldn’t see who they were. They were irrelevant.
He shut his eyes and then told himself to stop his current train of thought. They’d had discussions about this before. Tony knew that it was just… it was just in his head. Mostly.
, for that fact.
work this out, okay, and if we are going to do that, you need to tell me what helps. Anything at all, okay?”
Steve’s smile flickered and became a little strained, but his back straightened and he took Tony’s hand all the same, firm and unwavering. Steve was a supporting strut—without him, some days, Tony knew he’d just collapse.
Steve squinted at him. “Who’re you—”
“Steve… he did not,” Natasha commented, a little of her Russian lilt slipping into her voice as she spoke. Her eyes were glued with a wild intensity to the TV screen, where what looked to be a Spanish version of Peppa Pig was playing. “Kept asking for you. Mаленький ребенок.”
your fault. It's all your fault that boys are universally terrible, actually- I'm blaming
Next time Tony saw him, Steve was making himself breakfast.
“It wasn’t… amicable, exactly,” Steve gritted out, and God, he’d compartmentalised all this shit for so long now, bringing it back up to the surface felt wrong, “we were both in bad places. I haven’t talked to him since.”
“I’d say we probably have more experience than most, anyway,” Natasha interjected with a small smile as she nudged Steve’s middle. “We’ve fought about ten times as many aliens as the rest of these guys. We’ve won this before. We’ll do it again.”
Simple.
“I’ve got a plan!” Steve declared, shifting Tony off his lap and then stumbling upright away from the couch. He turned back around to look at Tony, and then a second later Tony watched in amusement as Steve tentatively dropped lower, getting to one knee. It took a few attempts for him to find his balance, and Thor had to help him in the end, but after about thirty seconds he’d gotten it, and he looked up at Tony with a huge smile on his face.
, Steve,” he said in bewilderment, before taking Steve’s hand and then stepping back.
Tony shrugged, cocking his head again, like he was focusing in on Steve properly. He’d done that the first time they’d looked at one another, and Steve just sat there a little dumbly, trying not to blush under the stare. “You know- I genuinely can’t say. Innocent, maybe. You give off that vibe.”
“You either get in the trashcan or you spend the rest of your life in a cell,” Steve snapped, “and no, don’t say anything along the lines of ‘I chose the cell’, I don’t have time for that. Just get in the fucking trash, okay?”
“Nah,” Steve sighed happily, “ya don’t.”
Tony’s hand immediately switched course, instead tugging out the phone from where he’d hooked it up with a grin of satisfaction. “God, it’s like Christmas,” he muttered as he switched on the device and opened it up. “Let’s find out who you are, lady—or, uh, who you were, at least.”
There was an awkward pause. Peter guessed they must have got the days wrong for which one of them was going to go and talk to him about his school day.
“No it fucking doesn’t,” he snapped, and yeah, he really wished he didn’t have the fucking wheelchair right now because it was hard to look intimidating when you were half the other person’s height. “It doesn’t matter, because I’m fucking fine. Look, see?”
Nothing
“I… great!” Steve couldn’t help the tint of excitement that leaked out of his words, and he grinned, “my place, just turn up whenever. We’re not doing much- just movies and pizza and knowing Clint and Natasha, probably alcohol. There’ll be a few people there. It’ll be good. You’ll- I think you’ll like them all, they’re nice people, I swear! Bucky too, he’s sweet, I promise, you just have to warm up to him,” Steve slid off the bike, barely holding back an excited little bounce of his feet as he walked backward toward his house.
Once more, Steve smiled to himself softly and then let his eyes fall shut to the sound of-
that was far more adorable than it should have been-
Both of them looked at one another for a few seconds, disbelief in both of their eyes. Tony wondered whether he was still being affected by the concussion. Last time he’d been coherent, he was convinced Steve was going to kick him off the team for good, and now… now he was saying that he loved him? It hardly even computed properly in his brain.
go back. He kicked… changed security codes. Said if he saw me ‘gain he’d… Anyway. M’on my own now.”
Steve looked sheepish. “Hey, you’re one to talk,” he said weakly, “and I’m okay!”
He shook himself again. No, no, Tony would be fine. He was with the rest of the team, and Steve knew without a doubt that they would keep him safe. He just had to trust them until help arrived. They’d be okay. Tony would be okay.
me, and I
Sam? Staying out of anything? Don’t be ridiculous.
That sounded ominous. Steve had never given favours to computers before. “Go on,” he said slowly.
“Please,” Steve whispered sadly, “don’t make me do that again. I can’t bear hurting you.”
angry, but he couldn’t remember what the reason for it was. He had just been furious. Moreso than he’d ever been before, which was saying something. It hurt to think too hard, but he was sure it was-
“So I reapplied to MIT.”
Unfortunately, the combination of Steve’s confrontational personality and Zeke’s apparent tendency to make others feel like shit meant that Steve was calling out to him before he could even think about it, his face set in anger and his feet marching of their own accord.
“You keep saying he does it all for Thor’s benefit,” Steve told him somewhat coldly, “but then also seem adamant that Thor doesn’t care about you. So either Tony gives a shit or Thor does, yet you’re convinced it’s neither.”
Steve’s head was spinning. Tony was completely bamboozling him here. Why was he saying that he liked Steve? That was… that couldn’t be true, could it? Anyway. Steve didn’t even like him.
Steve turned his eyes back on Tony, and a second later his mouth ticked upward in fondness as the thought struck him.
“He’s fine,” Tony told him, “I know you don’t think it, but he can look after himself.”
Clint looked behind him at the rather innocuous-looking chamber. Then he turned back to Steve, concern in his eyes. “You okay?” He asked, his two fingers slipping over Steve’s neck and checking his pulse. His eyes widened a little. “Whoah, that doesn’t sound normal.”
hot. Oh my- God,” he choked hoarsely.
“Whassgonon?” His body shuddered and he jerked forward, expecting darkness and cold and an impending sense of dread. HYDRA were coming. That much, he knew. He had to prepare. He had to analyse the situation, take in what he…
“Should he stay for more monitoring?” Tony asked, shooting Steve a stony glare and pushing him back a little.
“You are kind and you care-“ Steve’s voice got louder, and he followed Tony relentlessly, standing on the bed and ducking under a low-hanging light to avoid a second concussion, “- and you look out for people even when you don’t need to-“
“Are those designs?” Steve asked, brows furrowing as he tried to focus in on one of the things pinned messily to the wall. Next to it, on the paintwork itself, it looked as if Tony had scribbled extra notes on in permanent marker.
Now, though, it was all up in the air as to whether he’d actually get it, or whether he’d die before he could utter a single word along the lines of ‘I’m crazily, stupidly in love with you’.
“Have you called your friends yet?” Tony asked suddenly.
The laws of their species’ had always been strict. The Demon’s magic had been put in place to make sure they never mixed themselves with angels. And no one had ever wanted to before, either, so no one had worked out how to fix it. Not even Tony- even after all those nights spent working until dawn to try and find a solution, especially in the last year, when the effects had finally begun showing.
Bucky grimaced, but nodded his head and gave Steve’s shoulder one last squeeze before standing and walking out of the room.
, Tony wanted to say. Not that that mattered now. Steve probably wouldn’t be visiting much, if at all, now. “No, uh—come through. I’m in the kitchen.”
Steve paused, considering it. Then he frowned. “Who’s been telling you you look good in rabbit ears?” He asked somewhat sulkily, dragging his eyes toward the space above Tony’s head, presumably to visualise the image. “Also, I sure as hell wouldn’t mind, but you might look a bit out of place with the rest of us in normal clothes.”
God, Tony wished he could. It wasn’t like he
Clint rolled his eyes and hopped on the table next to Tony, “that these are favours you can ask- no arguments allowed- of me, contractually signed and agreed upon. Only for the amount of times it says on the slip, though, I’m not that easy.”
Steve felt his dislike of Ty knock up a few levels higher as he turned, looking at Tony in concern. Tony himself was busy hitting Thor in exasperation and then turning back, staring firmly over Steve’s shoulder and avoiding his gaze.
“Can we see your badge, please?” He asked politely, putting on all his Captain America charm instead. “Or any other proof of identity will be fine, thank you.”
“yes, sir?”
Slowly, Steve curled his arms around Tony’s shoulders tighter, tucked him into the warmth of Steve’s embrace. Tony hated the cold. He’d hated the cold for years, ever since they’d first met, he wouldn’t step foot out of the house after November without gloves and scarf. Steve didn’t want him to be cold now. He didn’t want him to be uncomfortable.
His day at Stark Industries was, admittedly, not the most productive he'd ever been.
“Tough shit, buddy,” Steve shrugged, winding his foot around the back of Tony’s leg and then swiping, sending him tumbling onto his back with a yell, “’cause I’m here now, and you’re just gonna have to deal.”
Tony clenched his jaw, knocking a knuckle against each locker he passed absently. "Is any of this really any of your business, Steve? I thought I told you to stay away from me."
Steve rolled his eyes. What, were they going to start worshipping at his alter now?
Steve was so caught up in the fact that he’d just heard Tony speaking perfect Italian that he didn’t even notice Peter Parker staring at him. It was only when Peter cleared his throat and chucked a pen at Tony’s head that Steve jerked out of his brief stupor, watching Tony turn around and spot him on the other side of the room.
This was so mortifying. Steve- Steve was going to see him like this. Their relationship was still fairly new, still finding its feet, and now Steve was going to walk in and see Tony curled around the toilet like it was his fucking anchor to life, crying and snotty and shaking like a child because what, someone
“I promise that you can. Pepper and I were discussing it all night last night; she said your presence there isn’t going to make or break anything. They can get other people to step in for you, and you don’t
, his mind supplied vacantly, and with a small hum of acceptance, he promptly passed out again.
he sang, nodding his head back and forth as he looked at Peter intently,
He didn’t feel any sympathy. Didn’t think he could, after what he’d seen her do to Peter in the beginning. So fucking what, she’d come around to her human side in the end and done what any sane person would do—that didn’t make everything else go away.
He leaned back a little, noses brushing against one another as he looked down at Tony and giggled slightly deliriously. Tony didn’t open his eyes for another second, but then seemingly pulled them open with intense effort. “Hmm?” He asked- and he hadn’t been drinking, but he sounded drunk anyway.
Settling back down on the bed, he shuffled his head just a little bit closer down toward Tony and then took one long breath, filling up his lungs so he wouldn’t need to breathe for a minute or so. He stared up at the ceiling, letting his body go still and his ears focus on the expansive quiet of the room. For a few seconds, he couldn’t quite focus on it properly, but then-
"What?" Steve said from the bed, shuffling around to look over at them. Tony held up the sticky note and raised an eyebrow.
Clint snorted. “That’s God’s way of telling you off for not taking on any responsibility for him over the past two days,” he said with a cocked eyebrow, and Steve turned to him in irritation, mouth opening in a (pretty useless) attempt at defending himself, but Thor stepped in between them before anything could flare up and raised his hands.
“Lame. You totally took that off the internet,” Steve replied, hands rising to Tony’s waist as he let his head fall into Tony’s stomach, “how you feeling?”
Sam didn’t say anything- but his hand rose and squeezed against Steve’s shoulder. “Well, you’ve done fucking great so far, dude. Honestly- I’m kind of shocked. When dad said we were taking in a fifteen year old guy rather than the usual foster kids, I thought it was going to go… very differently.  You’ve been better than any of us could have imagined.”
Tony just pulled a face at him. “Because I don’t want them to kill any more innocent fucking people, Steve, why do you think?”
He decided on moving, instead of speaking- reaching out and prodding Bruce with a finger. He smiled weakly when the man jumped. “Jesus, Steve- you’re awake. Good. Hey. How you feeling, buddy?”
Tony shrugged underneath him. “They’re a good bunch. Some of the ones I can actually tolerate, you know. We used to have some fun, back when I usually hung out with them, But I missed you. I’d been expecting a date, and then it all kind of fell through.”
He turned his head, looking at Tony’s mop of loose curls. Tony felt the movement, and his hands squeezed just that little bit tighter around Steve’s stomach.
Tony smiled, turning back to face forward so his profile was pointed toward Steve. “I could be a scout.”
Of course, this case was a little different. The whole dead-mom thing was admittedly, quite a big thing to get upset over, and not even Steve could deny that much. Sometimes he wondered whether it was normal. To still feel it, just as viscerally, just as painfully as if it had been the very first day he’d found the news. Maybe he was weak. Pathetic.
“Peteroony,” Clint got down to eye level with the little boy, ignoring whatever it was that Bruce had been going to say, “can you say ‘Bruce’ for me? Come on—say ‘Bruce’.”
Bucky looked warily at Steve, who just sort of flailed his hands helplessly. “I was literally gone for a second,” he stuck up a finger, “
Tony looked up at him for a few more seconds, before turning back down to continue without speaking. But Steve could see him holding back a smile, and the back of his neck was turning pink again, holy
“Play me the recording,” he whispered to the AI, feeling the words catch in his dry throat, “the one of the night Howard and Tony had the fight.”
The man turned under his grip, eyes wide in surprise. Tony’s soul spilled out through them, the animation behind the irises fantastic and beautiful, the emotion dancing, fluid, in motion.
The room was quiet and dark when Tony walked in.
Steve, at that point, was already pretty much asleep once more, but he made sure to huff in affirmation and squeeze Tony’s waist softly. “Even,” he repeated gently.
Tony’s mouth opened and closed a few more times, before he too, slowly lifted his hands to cover his face. “Oh no,” he said quietly, “oh… no, that’s not good, that’s very very not g-“
Tony’s hand found Steve’s free one. Steve gripped it tight. He couldn’t decide which one of them was shaking- probably both.
And that was when the doors slid open, revealing two men in prim suits, one holding a clipboard under his arm. They both smiled around the room, seemingly unfazed by the standoff between them and a room full of superheroes. By all accounts, they seemed very plain and normal- just like any other government official one would see in day-to-day life. “Good morning,” the first one said warmly, stepping forward, “I’m Michael, and this is my partner John. We’re here in response to a call made saying you’ve got a child in the tower that doesn’t belong to any of you? Would you like to explain the events that led up to this, and then we can discuss how to move forward?”
Tony grunted discontentedly. “Sounds boring.”
In response, he got another small shrug. “Does it matter? No. It was years ago. And Zeke hates me. It’s just what we do, I guess. Everyone’ll be waitin’ to see how I retaliate.”
“took a bit of a while to track it down,” Tony said, voice going a little softer as he rolled the silver ring between his fingers and then looked back up to Steve. His eyes were gentle, and he even smiled slightly. “But I got it in the end.”
“Fine,” he snapped, curling in on himself and staring sulkily at the door, “but you better not piss me off anymore. I’m still mad.”
Tony looked up at Steve with a small note of apology on his face. “I left it somewhere in the Gala,” he admitted sheepishly, “sorry-”
Steve’s eyes widened. “They’re not going to relocate me,” he said vehemently, “that’s not happening.”
Steve took another moment to just stare at the mess of a scene in front of him- and then without another word, he turned and marched away.
When he looked up, he caught Tony staring at him. His eyes were a little bit larger than they had been a few seconds previously, and when Steve raised his eyebrows, Tony spun back around and cleared his throat. The collar was higher on the new jacket Tony had on, but Steve would have bet good money that the back of that boy’s neck was bright red.
“Yeah, Steve, I second Brucie, let’s go, let’s go- I’m sure your super stamina can let you hold out for a night. I promise you’ll enjoy yourself,” Tony assured him, grabbing his arm and pulling him up.
But that was probably the alcohol talking. That was a bad idea. He should… not do that.
But Tony seemed to be… well. He was doing
“Tony,” Steve said exasperatedly, beginning to move past him again, “we don’t have time to discuss this right now. You’re not going to be useful without the suit and I won’t let you go out and get beat up by Piledriver when you can’t defend yourself.” He paused, turning back to Tony with a slightly apologetic face. “We have to go. Just… just stay here, and we’ll discuss it later, okay?”
“You’ve already gotten yourself into enough trouble, Rogers,” a voice—sounded like the gym teacher—told him roughly as he hauled him off, “I suggest you keep your mouth shut from here on out.”
His hands ached. He was lying on something, but it sure as hell wasn’t a bed. Some sort of table, probably. When he pulled his eyes open, it hurt like a motherfucker. The light stung and his head throbbed. Felt like a concussion. Why would he have a concussion? He tried to sit up and move his hand to feel at his head, but he couldn’t. Something was pinning him down.
“You are a good person, Tony-“
“Yeah, I’m here,” Steve said quickly down the line, sparing one last glance over to the boy, who just so happened to be looking back over to him again. He cocked an eyebrow and did something with his mouth that could almost be construed as a smile, before pushing off his bike and heading in the opposite direction of school with his friends. “Just…”
before realizing that, being the insanely clever person he is, he just managed to expose himself and his clothe-stealing ways right in front of the man himself.
“Eyes on the road, bud.”
Natasha spotted Steve first, but aside from slightly elevating a perfect eyebrow and then nodding to Tony, she didn’t say anything. Steve wandered over slowly, watching Tony’s back intently because he was a sad, sad boy with far too large of a crush to be handling on a Friday morning.
“I wasn’t aware that Tony Stark
“—and I was hurting, but that wasn’t enough for me, and so in the process of grieving I put you through hell too and I didn’t even fucking
But then Tony had turned around, looking at Steve intently as his hands rose and gently framed the sides of the helmet. Softly, Steve watched him through the tinted visor as Tony lifted it off his head. He blinked from the sunlight that hit him, before focusing back in on Tony. Now holding the helmet in between two hands, he was looking a little spaced out- eyes focused somewhere near Steve’s mouth.
Brilliant.
“He threatened to turn into a version of Skynet if I wronged you,” Steve blurted just as Tony reached him, and then watched in part guilt, part amusement as Tony’s smile dropped and his eyebrows rocketed.
“—Be fine,” Bruce finished, giving him a small smile. His hand settled, firm and reassuring, against Tony’s shoulder. Tony tried to argue, but the words were too fuzzy to grasp and make real on his mouth. They hung instead in the air between them. Bruce, however, was not moved. “I’ll keep moving, stay warm that way.”
happened- dialled everything back up a notch or two, and it was only when Tony twisted around and then leaned into Steve’s front that he came back to reality once more. He looked down, his nose brushing Tony’s soft and freshly-washed curls as he did so. They smelled like apples from his shampoo. It was nice, and he took a long breath in.
, that was so hot. Tony gasped. “Fuck, you smell so good. So good.”
Tony wordlessly extended a hand, and Clint passed it over. He’d check it over later. A few more comments were made, but ultimately they’d done pretty good, and there wasn’t anything else that needed working on. Steve breathed out, running a hand through his hair as he glanced at Tony. “Anyone fancy working through the second rout—”
Bruce’s face went more serious and he gave Tony a sharp look. “He got hurt too, Tony,” he said bluntly. “in a different way. He’s not being stupid and that’s not fair.”
“Tony, maybe I should just stay, in case-”
“Ceaselessly loud?” Steve said with a sigh, swinging off the banister and then waiting for Sam, pushing him forward, “whatever, you go first though- she scares me.”
He got the feeling that probably wasn’t going to be the end of it.
She moved jerkily, cutting out the video, and he seethed in his chair, trying to remember how to breathe. A second later, the next clip popped up. Tony blinked, recognising the ensemble she was wearing. They were the same clothes she’d worn when the police had found her, shot in the room of a motel.
“Do I hear birthday kisses are being exchanged?” And then Natasha walked in, head cocked curiously in Steve’s direction as she shot off a smile, “don’t tell Tony- he might leap right out of the principal’s office to get in on that.”
“TELL ME I DIDN’T!”
Steve gasps, hands sinking lower and grabbing at the fabric of Tony’s shirt, pulling him in until he was pressed up against Steve’s chest- and Tony thinks for a moment that he might just be enough.
that was the only reason he said it, I
, even in her worst moments she’d been happy, and fuck, he just loved her so much.
aware)- but he still hated him saying it.
Steve comes back after a long mission
“Car’s outside,” Fury cut in, and wow, okay, not wasting any time then, “I’ll meet you in my office. Don’t dawdle.” With that, he cut the call, not so much as a goodbye, and Steve pulled the phone away from his ear, a frown starting to crease his face. He zipped his pants up hurriedly and glanced at himself in the mirror, making sure there was no drool on his face, then grabbed his black shirt and SHIELD jacket from the chair where it was all piled up. He wondered what the hell it was that was so important, and briefly checked his phone to see if there was any breaking news that had occurred over the last few hours he’d been asleep.
this whole thing was,” Tony snapped, throwing the screwdriver down with a frustrated clatter and spinning to pin a glare on Steve. “The fact you’re here, chewing me out for not wanting to deal with Peter, is proof of the problem in itself. I’m not his dad. You’re not his dad. I can say he’s a fucking nightmare if I want, because I’m not obligated in any way to be nice to him.”
It had been going good. Dates with Tony were always good, obviously.
Or not- based on the way both Tony and Thor were looking at him, he guessed there was some sort of tension there.
Tony just looked at him intently for a moment, before snapping out of whatever trance he was in and then blinking a few times. “I’m… oh, right, okay, yeah, shit-“ he shuffled hurriedly to the side, ignoring the protests from Clint and Sam in order to make room. His elbow caught on a drink as he moved clumsily and he swore, hands jerking out to pick it up. When Steve looked down at him curiously, the back of his neck had turned red again.
“TONY!” He called, searching through the smoke and rubble.
“We can make a new fort?” Steve said, looking around the room questioningly, but all his other friends just groaned and waved tired hands. They hadn’t moved from the areas in which they’d all been trapped by the cave-in, and so all around the room people were simply lounging around, half-buried and too tired to care. Steve glanced at his watch, and realized with surprise that it was 3am. They’d been messing around for hours, and he had barely even realized.
“That’s me,” Tony shrugged, and then pulled Steve forward.
Walking into school the next day wearing the marks of his earlier confrontation sure earned him a few concerned stares. He was pretty certain his face was a little more purple than what most considered normal, and although Nat had done her hardest to cover it with makeup, the discoloration still showed through obviously. He didn’t care much; he’d dealt with it enough before- but he ducked his head down and tried to avoid the curious eyes anyway. He didn’t exactly fancy trying to explain that he’d had his ass handed to him by a bunch of strangers wanting money.
Tony couldn’t- he didn’t know what was real any more, he was choking on bile and water and dirt and
“By all means, demonstrate,” he responded, ducking his head and then nudging Tony back until he was able to be kissed, slow and deep. Tony was smiling against his mouth as he pushed them backward until Steve hit the table behind them, and the grin was still on his face as he sank to his knees on the kitchen floor.
“Yeah, but then he started speaking.” Thor poked his head around the corner of the fridge he was rifling through, grinning from ear to ear as he jerked a thumb over to Peter. “I was disbelieving at first too, but then he pointed at Bruce while saying his name, so I had no choice but to reward him with a late bedtime.”
“I can’t decide whether this anger is you trying subtly to say you’re going to miss me or just genuinely focused on your hatred for Washington DC,” he informed Tony as the man pouted at his own reflection and combed his damp hair back off his face. He was wrapped in a towel around the waist, fresh out of the shower, and Steve appreciated the wonderful curves of his lover while the man continued to rant sulkily about Steve’s imminent departure.
Steve watched him go, following after his brother with a disorientated stumble. Then he turned back to Tony. “How are you feeling?” He asked, cocking his head to the side and trying to shove everything else aside in order to just focus on Tony. “Little better?”
He knows all of it, and he acts accordingly.
“Bucky’s alive,” he wheezed, and then for good measure, “and he killed Tony’s parents.”
Bucky pulled a face at that. “Really-“
-God, fuck, stop it, don’t, wake up wake up wake up-
It seemed in the night Steve had been away, Tony had disassembled…everything. Cupboards, bed, electricals- it was all lying in pieces on the floor around Tony. It looked like someone had taken a bat to the place and started swinging with abandon.
He left the room.
It was the same thing he felt whenever Tony looked at him and tried so very hard not to smile.
Not that any of that mattered. This wasn’t about Tony. This was about Steve, and the ugly truth behind the celebration Tony had adored so much. Now it just left a horrible taste in his mouth. He couldn’t get excited over something that Steve and every other Unhuman hated so much. It wasn’t right.
This little cabin on the side of the mountain felt like a whole planet away from the others.
Steve swallowed, nodding. Yeah- he’d sensed that the moment he saw the guy. There was a chaos about him that was noticeable from the first moment of contact. Steve wasn’t an idiot- he knew danger when he saw it.
Fury was stood waiting, his hands resting on the desk between them. He wasn’t moving, not one muscle, and Steve figured the Director was probably waiting for him to react first and then go from there. But Steve himself wasn’t quite sure what to say. In fact, a rather large portion of his cognizant brain-processes were choosing instead to focus on the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock that Fury kept in the corner of his room. It was a funny thing to have in a top-security office. A little out of place. Maybe it was an heirloom or something. Steve didn’t know. He really needed to stop thinking about the clock right about now.
There was silence and the room, and then a collective sigh seemed to ripple across the crowd. “Tony-” Clint began, pausing for a moment, and biting his lip.
Dad and pops were fighting again.
“At the very least, he can tell us what to do with the kid, even if he can’t take him in.”
needed to sharpen up the edges of his goatee.
kids- the one with the divorced parents and two of everything because his dads were both trying to one-up each other in the Who Loved Their Kid Most competition, which sounded great in theory but really just sucked.
Steve lifted his head and looked at both of them. “You haven’t got a fucking clue to how to make friends either, do you?” He asked, and immediately both Bucky and Peggy shook their heads and made noises of apology.
She didn’t even look up from her phone. “Steve, I watched you walk out of this same store with an entirely different outfit to the one you came in with, once.”
“If I asked you to do the same thing,” Tony spun on his heel and turned to him, and Steve stopped, nearly bumping right into him, “if I told you I’d been mugged and needed your help, would you come?”
“Tony?” Steve prompted, and Tony wasn’t even sure whether this was actually Steve or just some vision, a pain-induced hallucination to help calm him. He appreciated his brain for giving him that, at least. “Tony, what do you want to tell me, hey?”
Tony couldn’t lose him.
Tony woke up to updates from Pepper telling him that the launch had gone fantastically, and he spent most of the first morning on the porch writing out emails and finishing off design-work on his tablet, one eye watching Steve feed the chickens out in the front. The warm summer weather was pleasant enough that they spent most of their time outside, going out on walks and sitting in the fields to eat their lunch while Steve sketched and Tony read. He kept a close watch on his partner, making sure that he wasn’t getting worked up about anything and trying to keep it from Steve, but there was no need to worry. Tony settled into the routine quickly, and was more than happy to shirk all his responsibilities for a little while. The suits and business attire had been swapped out for soft pants and flannel, the delicately trimmed beard he’d been keeping meticulously on top of for the last few weeks was starting to grow out just a touch, and Tony had opted to take his glasses with him as opposed to wearing his contacts, so the frames were sitting cute and clunky on his nose.
“And why was he telling me that you’d been acting strangely as soon as the topic of Peter got brought up, even going so far as to say that he was a nightmare, and generally giving off the impression that you no longer wanted anything to do with him?” Steve’s face had hardened at that, which was great, because now the expression had turned into his ‘you’ve crossed the line Tony’ look, which was fucking stupid anyway, Tony hadn’t done anything wrong.
Now he was here, however, he was caught between climbing out of the window and jumping down onto Tony’s porch directly underneath him in order to sneak out, or just telling Bucky to go back home and then waiting around for Tony to see if he was okay. He’d been on edge when he’d left the room, and Steve knew that Tony was currently downstairs covering all that panic up completely as he talked to whatever clients that Howard had shoved onto him. When he got back and took off that nonchalant mask, however, Steve worried about all that fear crawling right back, even worse than before.
When Steve walked out of the door the next morning and began his journey to the bus station two minutes down the road, the last thing he expected to see was Bucky.
“I get it, I’m mad at me too,” Bucky said, “and for the record, I
Steve smiled, and it turned into a laugh, and then into something wetter, until suddenly he realised that there were tears falling down his face and his eyes were burning, chest heaving with each hitching breath. Natasha pulled him in easily, and Steve wondered whether she was crying too, or whether there just wasn’t enough left in her for it.
,” Bucky said to him, and he didn’t even sound confrontational. Steve’s brow creased as he watched him; actually looking remorseful and smiling nervously over at Tony. “Just a minute of your time, I swear.”
Steve sighed. Unfortunately, he did. Droplets of water glistened and trailed down perfect skin as he shifted, standing out of the tub and then looking down at Tony from his full height. Tony briefly reconsidered his previous statement about blowjobs when he got an eyeful of exactly what it was he was missing, but Steve moved and grabbed a towel before Tony could mention it, towelling himself off quickly and efficiently. Tony simply knelt by the bath and watched him shamelessly, chuckling when Steve pulled the towel through his hair and sent it flying out in all directions. He was the most adorable Supersoldier Tony had ever met, hands-down.
He could see why Tony was apprehensive. This… God, this was a life Steve couldn’t bear to lose.
“I like boring,” Steve said simply, “boring is simple. We don’t have enough boring.”
“Clint, what did we say about keeping our clothes on?” Someone groaned, and Tony could feel the vibrations of Steve laughing on top of him, his face crinkled and smiling from ear to ear.
, for all I know.”
. “I hate Christmas,” he hissed, feeling the back of his head hit the pillow, “I fucking hate Christmas, I hate—”
“Listen, I might not be in the army these days, but I used to be. I know how to do this.” Steve was quickly slipping back into soldier mode, and right now, he needed a way to get across the coastline. “Does Tony have any air transport?”
Steve had cut in with a brisk confirmation, and said that they’d make their own way there. Tony had watched his hands shake minutely before he’d pulled them behind his back, body taut as a bow.
He turned around and slammed his head as hard as he could against the wall, immediately feeling the pain and darkness intermingle as one and him forcefully back into the blank nothing of unconsciousness.
Without a word, Tony wound his fingers around Steve’s bony elbow and pulled it up gently. Steve, eyes wide, watched him in bewilderment and attempted not to shiver from the touch. Tony’s fingers were very warm.
“Don’t panic, it’s okay,” the warm baritone spoke closely to him again, and a hand fell over his shoulder once more, “I just got you some water. Would you like it?”
Tony turned slowly to him, watching Thor grab a loaf of bread and then pull out a handful of slices, starting to chew on them absently. Tony briefly took a moment to process the fact that he was watching a Norse God who was wearing nothing except his underwear as he ate plain slices of bread and held a small superhuman baby in one meaty arm. It was certainly not a statement he’d ever thought he’d be making. “Thor, are you trying to tell me that you speak Baby now?”
He started shuffling out from under the bed, but just as his head poked out, he heard Tony suddenly move up above him. His legs landed into Steve’s vision, and then his knees buckled and he crouched down, not so much looking at Steve as he was looking through him. His face was blank as he pushed Steve’s shoulder backward. “Stay there,” he whispered, “stay, he might come back. If he sees you he’ll try and- just stay there.”
There was a moment of silence. Then, “oh, no.”
Steve nodded and shut his eyes. Tony knew he must be in pain- electric shocks always seemed to be worse in the aftermath than they were at the present moment. But despite what he must have been feeling, he didn’t let it show. “I’m sorry I scared you,” he murmured, “but it had been heading straight for you. And you wouldn’t have been able to bounce back as quickly as I can.”
Tony stopped, letting his nose fall into Steve’s messed-up hair. “Point is, you are not solely responsible for our wellbeing. You, at no point in history, have ever been to blame for either of us ‘dying’. Because I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that you would do everything and anything in your power to make sure that does not happen.”
Steve stopped, looking around in surprise at the thing he was sat in and remembering that this wasn’t actually what Tony drove. “This is your dad’s?” He asked quietly.
Tony didn’t respond, and Steve left the room with Rumlow’s smug stare pinned to his back, and Fury’s angry one waiting in front of him. His mind was racing, and more than ever, and those seeds of doubt Tony had sewn were rapidly growing in his mind. Tony had said it all with such
“I’m okay, buddy,” he looked up and grinned, rolling his eyes fondly, “seriously.”
On the night they’d first met, they’d both been pretty drunk, and although Steve had been feeling all the usual butterfly-feelings at the way Tony talked, the way he acted and spooked and just
New suit for Natasha. Fix Thor’s hammer strap, because the metal might be the strongest thing in the universe, but the leather was, unfortunately, just leather. Clint’s bow was getting worn too, so that’d need some work. And the whole team needed some sort of filtration system that they could carry around with them, because right now Tony was the only one protected from gas-attacks and that just wasn’t good enough.
So he did.
The communal floor was dark when he wandered in; bathed in the gloomy shadow of night that was slowly fading to morning. It was raining heavily outside, as shown from the heavy clouds that hung above and the incessant pitter-patter of drops against glass. Perfect weather, if you asked Tony. He found the noise soothing.
But the doctor shook his head. Hah. “There’s really not much point. Captain Rogers’ system wouldn’t accept any drugs we could offer, and his heart appears to be functioning normally. I suggest you just take it easy for a few days, keep watch and see if there are any changes.”
“Oh, believe me, if he’s got Tony Stark backing him, he doesn’t even need to be,” Natasha smiled sweetly, and Steve exhaled in despair, staring at the ceiling and wondering how the boy had managed to get himself involved in half the conversations Steve was having these days without even being personally present for them.
Okay. Okay, so it was time for the ground to swallow him up entirely and suffocate him, if only to stop him speaking.
But there was nothing. Steve was off the grid.
He came every week on a Friday evening after he got off work, and he’d bring his sketchbook each and every time. Rain, snow or shine- he’d be there. And so would the ballet dancer.
Tony simply sighed, and then let his own head flop down on the pillow. “Remind me never to let any of you drink again,” he muttered as he closed his own eyes, “you quite clearly cannot be trusted.”
“I don’t care,” Tony mumbled with a shake of his head, pulling away to look at him earnestly, “don’t give a damn, Steve, look at me- I’m the one who should be warning you, you don’t… you deserve someone with so much more than I could possibly give you, but I’m selfish and I want to try anyway.” His voice was nothing more than a scared whisper as he leaned in, forehead against Steve’s own, shutting his eyes and breathing in Steve’s air with shaky rasps. Steve felt Tony’s hands flex against his sides; wanting to clutch, but holding himself back.
There was another buzz from his phone, but when he looked down, it was from Bucky rather than Tony. He slid open the snapchat message, grinning at the picture of Bucky and Natasha staring back up at him as they curled around eachother on the couch. He was glad Bucky had found her- Steve got the feeling that Bucky had felt kind of out on a limb after Steve had left for Queens and subsequently removed the option of having a best friend less than a minute away. Natasha was good for him.
He shrugged, hitching his bag high again. “It was okay, I guess. You got some nice art facilities. The people are... people.”
There was a sudden tremor, and whilst all the assailants appeared to remain on their feet, all three Avengers went sprawling on the floor. Tony bit back a yell, feeling the shockwave reverberate through the corridor. It was lucky he’d had his jaw unclenched, or all his teeth would’ve been smashed in by the pressure wave.
“Didn’t what?” Tony asked.
Tony looked up, smiling again, if a little tighter. “Mm,” he nodded, and then got slowly to his feet, “but I just- I should probably go. It’s getting late. I’m supposed to be meeting people like-“ he glanced down at his watch and then raised his eyebrows, “-an hour ago.”
Kindred spirit, really.
Tony came up from the workshop and joined the rest of the team approximately one hour into the movie they were all watching.
“It was an asshole living up to his title as- well an asshole,” Thor responded. Steve, who had been watching Tony and Ty until the moment they turned the corner, finally turned back around fully, a deep frown on his face.
Hopefully.
for them all.
Steve blinked.
Tony let his eyes fall shut again, leaning his head against Steve’s as those seven simple words coated his restless mind like a blanket and offered him the sense of peace that he’d been longing for.
Tony, look. I understand your need for self preservation. I do. But that kid has literally spent his whole life being tortured. So yes- I’m going to hug him when he wants me to hug him, and I’m going to love him as much as I can. His past is his past, and his future will be his future, but right here right now, I am going to give him everything I can. And you’re right. It’s going to suck later. But at least Peter will have learned what it feels like to be cared for, and I won't have to live with the idea that I was just another of his handlers, rather than someone who actually gave a damn.”
Steve wanted to ask, but he knew that that would be pushing too fast too soon. He wasn’t an idiot. He needed to do this slowly. The important thing here was that Tony believed Steve was on his side—was morally aligned in the same way. And that Steve was still willing to trust him, too, was going to be important. So, defying all the voices of reason in his head that told him not to, he reached out and grabbed Tony’s hand, holding tight. “I need to stop them,” he breathed, looking up at Tony desperately. “I can’t let this happen. I have to… God, someone has to do
“It’s perfect,” Tony told him, “thank you.”
Steve smacked him lightly on the chest and sighed, sinking down into his shoulder and turning to face the TV. Tony continued to mutter for a few more seconds before he finally quietened as well, the only sounds coming from him being the sound of his heartbeat against Steve’s ear. His arm was a grounding weight around his back.
For the next month, both Steve and Tony made as much effort as they could to only use pet-names for one another. A ‘sweetheart’ here, a ‘my love’ there. There was even a memorable month or so where Steve called Tony
“Steve?” Tony asked, his voice gentle, but tinted with concern as he took in the tight lines of Steve’s face, “what are you thinking in that head of yours, huh?”
Another short pause. “No.”
anything, per se… Steve’s sweaters were just cozy, okay? And his sweatpants were soft and his tshirts were baggy and they all smelt like something undeniably
“Unfortunately, I find it difficult to imagine life without the idiot.”
Tony sat up gingerly, taking a piece of toast and tearing off a small corner before putting it in his mouth. He winced again. Steve figured anything that involved moving his face wasn’t going to feel too great just then.
“But you paused before you said that, Steve, so now I just don’t believe you.”
Steve, however, didn’t even seem to care about how tragic it sounded, because his whole face turned soft and he cocked his head at Tony before pulling him into an all-consuming embrace, mouth pressing into his temple. “There is no possible way you could be
Anyway. That was hardly Steve’s problem. Tony was going, so he was fine.
His eyes widened a fraction as the words returned to him, and he drew his gaze back to the man in front of him as he brought back the memory of how his voice had sounded, how his eyes had shone and he’d said
“I would give anything to hear my mom’s voice one more time,” Steve blurted, and Tony glanced up at him curiously as he slowly turned redder and redder. “She died after two weeks in a coma and she never got to- she didn’t even get to say goodbye properly. We hadn’t expected it. The last thing I said to her-“ he broke off, laughing a little wetly as he ran a suddenly shaking hand through his hair. “-I think I was asking her if she wanted some milk from the store? And then- God, she sent me a voicemail, you know? I deleted it- I wish I’d just kept it, just a little bit longer. That was the last time I heard her speak. I’d give anything for that stupid voicemail back.”
Steve looked down at him, and for a second it was like he knew exactly what Tony was thinking—but then he just wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist and pecked a kiss against his temple. “Let’s get to bed,” he said,” s’late.”
Someone was saying his name, blurred and distant through the fog in his head. There was a jerk against his shoulder and it hurt, then a second later a horrible bright light as the faceplate got ripped off. “-Tony, Tony, Jesus fucking Christ, can you hear me? Tony, oh God, what happened? What did you do?”
Steve’s hand. Focus on Steve’s hand. Steve, Steve, Steve.
Tony turned to him, eyebrows raised in question.
The fort withheld for another three minutes, until Bruce rugby-tackled Tony through the center and into the blanket-wall, bringing the whole contraption down on top of them all. There was a lot of screaming as they were all suddenly crushed by pillows and sheets, and Steve’s asthma meant he could hardly even breathe, but he was still laughing as he stuck his head up out of the mound and then untangled some sweet wrappers from his hair.
It was only then that he realised Dad and Pops had moved, resting a hand on each shoulder while he leaned forward on to the table and hid his crumpled face in the crook of his arms.
disastrous, if he was being honest.
Tony’s mouth dropped open. His face hurt like a motherfucker, and his eyes were watering from the impact. “Steve,” he began croakily, but the man just waved his hand sharply through the air again. Tony flinched back, just in case- but that one wasn’t meant for him.
“’m okay,” Tony mumbles, because it wouldn’t do for Steve to think he’d just blacked out or something.
“Shut up.” Steve kissed him hard enough he couldn’t speak any more, pushing them both down onto the couch so that he was leaning over Tony. He brushed his thumbs over Tony's chest, every inch of skin like a blessing. He never wanted to let go. “Let’s just… we both fucked up. We’re both sorry. Let’s just…please, just kiss me.” He pushed their mouths together again, fireworks dancing in his eyes, and once this mission was over Tony was going to go to jail for the rest of his life, and Steve was going to be the one who’d put him there and he would have to live with that—but for now, there was just this. Steve had missed it more than air. The feeling of Tony’s hands, his body, the way he made Steve feel like he was whole.
“You do that,” Steve stroked the hairs off Tony’s forehead, pressing a kiss there before hopping around to his side and getting comfy next to Tony. There was a rather ominous creaking noise, and Steve felt something snap underneath him, but he didn’t want to deal with that right now. Tony would fix it all in the morning. Hopefully.
He swished the water around absently, taking Peter’s arm and gently swiping across it, rubbing at it to remove any sticky substances he’d managed to get ahold of. Peter burbled away in his own language as he worked, and Tony found himself talking back easily, about random things he could think of off the top of his head. He’d heard somewhere that that was how babies learned to talk, and hey, it couldn’t hurt.
Steve stayed there for a second before pushing off. Everyone in the room was looking at him in surprise.
Dammit.
Steve said desperately, looking up into Tony’s soft brown eyes and hating himself so fucking much, “the point is that I could kill you, so easily! I could kill
knew that much. “Touché,” he muttered in the end, leaving it at that. He couldn’t see up above him, but he imagined that Steve was probably smiling triumphantly. He always did, when Tony accepted defeat. The asshole.
He stood there and watched them turn and walk away, a few of them looking to snigger at him as they did so. Tony didn’t turn around once. Just blanked him.
But Tony was Iron Man. Steve needed to do this, for the safety of—well, the
“Mom!” Sam groaned, “does Steve look like that type of guy who’s gonna start smoking in the bathrooms to you?”
Tony just stared at the slinky a little more, snorting. “God, I
particular conversation. My fault- should’ve remembered it doesn’t matter how far away you’re stood, it’s useless if he’s got something in his hand. Nice tumbler of whiskey thrown at the wall just here,” Tony circled the space an inch or two away from his head, and Steve just stared in horror. He realized his knuckles had turned white against Tony’s hand.
Tony sighed, shutting down the holoscreens and then rolling back out of the workshop. The doctors had ‘strongly recommended’ staying in the wheelchair for at least a few weeks, but honestly, Tony couldn’t stand the thing, and figured it would take about two more days for him to just give it up entirely and start using the crutches. Until then, though, he was resigned to wheeling his way around the tower. It took double the time for him to make his way up to his and Steve’s room than it would have done without the stupid wheelchair, but he supposed that would’ve been the same with a crutch as well. Either way, it sucked. He hated these sorts of injuries- the ones that stuck around the worst possible ways.
“I didn’t kill them, Steve,” he said softly, his voice wavering a little as he spoke, “I tried to
Someone poked him, and he blinked, quickly moving out of the way so more people could get in. At his side, Tony was chuckling. “Good, huh?”
But he couldn’t just do that for Tony. Because he knew the boy, dammit, and so Steve also knew that there was no way Tony wasn’t going to be splurging out on the best ever gift for Steve. It would be something amazing, like it had been for his birthday, and then Steve was going to feel like an absolute tool when he turned around and gave Tony something shitty in return. He couldn’t do that.
“Ah, super secret genius stuff,” Bucky said with a sage nod, “fair enough. Go change the world, Tony. We’ll see you when we get back.”
Tony paused, mouth opening and shutting a few times. He looked back up, over to Zeke who was still braced and ready- then over to the kid by the corner with his wide eyes and messy hair.
The man’s head turned stiffly to him; something strange in his gaze. There was an unnerving lack of emotion in his eyes, and Tony felt his hackles rise instinctively. At his side, he could sense Natasha doing the same. This just felt… wrong. But still, the man smiled again, the little twitch pulling his mouth up a fraction of an inch. “Seems an awful lot of equipment to buy for a baby you were only holding onto for 24 hours,” he said, waving a hand over to the high-chair in the kitchen and the now-empty boxes of toys and equipment stacked up in the corner of the room, ready to be taken out by the cleaners.
“It was really interesting, actually. The ideas presented were probably a little too abstract and futuristic to actually take on any scientific value, but the concept behind it was fascinating,” Tony breathed out excitedly, and Steve let the other boy gush for a few minutes, the words running over him soothingly. It didn’t make any sense to him at all, and that was absolutely fine, because Tony kept talking anyway, needing no input from Steve at all as his own enthusiasm and interest fuelled the conversation. Steve loved when Tony talked like that.
“Steve wait-“
Fucking Christ, there was probably an entire hospital tucked away in there anyway. Maybe that had been the plan all along.
Great. Now he was going to have to call Natasha and admit that yes, actually he had gotten lost, they were all right and he should never be let out without supervision ever again.
“Were the open wounds appropriately sterilized before being bandaged and covered?”
In answer, Steve lifted the lid again and then plucked the janitor’s cap off Tony’s head, before shutting it quickly once more. He checked his watch as he started to push the trolley back out of the door, biting his lip as he did so. A search would be going on right this minute, every holding cell being checked. Interrogation rooms might miss the first sweep, but once they established that Tony Stark was supposedly on that floor somewhere, they would check every inch of the place. And once they found the interrogation room empty…
Tony looked up, sighing deeply. “AIM,” he declared, sitting back once more and then palming a hand across his face. “God, what the hell are they doing here?”
He could admit, he may have been alone for a little too long. But it was fine. He was handling it.
“You probably have a concussion, Steve, and God only knows what else. I’m taking you to the fucking hospital.”
Tony snorted. “What did I tell you? I’m 23 forever and you’re a supersolider. We’ll be fine.”
“Guys,” Steve turned to them sharply, “Bye.”
Bucky gave him a look and cocked his head. “You really like that guy, don’t you?” He asked gruffly.
, you know, I’m not-“
Steve clamped a hand over his mouth before he could ramble further, smiling up at him. “Tony, I get it,” he said firmly, “it’s fine. Stop worrying."
"Baby's awake," Tony said wearily, shuffling sideways and then leaning down to pick the little guy up, "you don't think he's gonna puke on me, do you?"
“Well, kind’s good enough for me,” Peggy shrugged, leaning back on the couch and poking Steve with her foot, “just be careful, alright?”
He eventually located the bottle, half-empty and sort of gross, really, but he swallowed a large mouthful anyway and then opened up his screens, pointedly ignoring Steve as the other man stared at him. Eventually though, it got too much, and he turned enquiringly. “Are you going to do that for the rest of the night?”
“You are impossible, Steve. An impossible person. And the fact that I managed to meet you is
“I swear, Cap, if you make me run through this exercise again I’m gonna fucking lose it.” Natasha pointed a threatening finger toward Steve on the other side of the large room, red hair falling in damp strands as she caught her breath. Tony had to agree with her sentiment. People might have thought that the armour helped him conserve his own strength, but the metal got goddamn
He thought about the question for a moment. How
Tony’s eyes fell shut to the sensation of Steve’s fingers moving delicately across his skin, and he sighed contentedly. “Wanna know something?” He asked, lips curling as he smiled.
The next Tuesday, Tony found Steve waiting for him, as usual, by the front of the school. He was alone, his foot scuffing the ground and his hands stuffed into his pockets while he hung around and looked for Tony every few seconds. The other kids kept their distance, and Steve looked sullen enough that Tony almost didn’t blame them. When Tony had first met the guy, he’d been pretty terrified of him too. Although not for the same stupid reasons, mind you. Mostly because Steve was so startlingly attractive that Tony always wondered whether he’d been going into cardiac arrest whenever he’d been around.
He was
“Oh my god. Yes. Holy shit, yes, Steve.”
Tony slept.
Silence fell once more; Steve shuffling backward and forward on his feet and Thor just nodding absently, looking at something over Steve’s shoulder. Feeling like the conversation was drawing to a close, he opened his mouth to say a goodbye- but Thor beat him to it.
And it meant one of them would have to leave. Move out. Get a new life and a new partner and maybe even a new kid-
Their legs were touching as they both sat, and as Tony gradually became more comfortable and sunk lower into the cushions, more and more of him ended up pressed into Steve. By the end of the movie, their legs were tangled together, with Tony leaning almost subconsciously into Steve’s side; one arm propped on the back of the couch and the other twirling a breadstick between his fingers.
Pops managed to collect himself, though- walking forward and smiling as he reached out to squeeze Peter’s shoulder, before heading to the cupboards and grabbing a mug. “You had a good day today?”
The whole battle had been sort of a laugh, really.
Only Tony,
Steve could hear Natasha shouting for James in the background, and saw Clint try and take hold of Bucky’s arms- but Bucky was already marching forward, and Tony didn’t look ready to back down either- fuck, how had everything managed to spiral so fast in the space of a few seconds-
“Okay, fine, be happy if you really have to,” he surrendered in the end, rolling his eyes and then trying not to smile when he saw the grin Tony sent him in the reflection of the mirror, “just don’t expect me to come back after this, that’s all.”
It’s safe and warm and feels like home.
“Yeah, well, we don’t.” Steve’s jaw was tight and he glared at Tony for a second before blinking and then breaking his disdain with a sigh. He ran a hand over his face. “Look, Tony, I didn’t want to rain on your parade, but for Unhumans? Halloween sucks. Halloween is the day when everyone stops treating us like a disease and starts treating us like a joke instead, and I don’t know which one is worse. Those scary movies you love so much? It’s just… it’s just full of anti-Unhuman sentiment. Big bad vampire slash werewolf slash demon, poor innocent Baseliner? Yeah. Like we haven’t heard that before.”
Steve had made Tony smile. And, apparently, agree to go out for ice cream.
Tony wouldn’t want Steve to help him back to safety. Steve knew him well enough for that. So he steeled his face and he grabbed Bucky and sent a distress signal on Tony’s behalf, trying not to think about the fact he was leaving his lover and his whole life behind in the snow.
“Go to sleep, Tony. We’ll talk about everything in the morning,” Steve tells him, before getting up to leave.
buddy, stop!”
“Tony, yesterday you refused to get out of bed because I hadn’t given you a morning kiss. You had to call me and then demanded I come back upstairs.”
“S’okay,” he muttered, moving his hand to cradle the back of Peter’s head, run through the little boy’s downy curls, “I’ve got you. You’re okay now. You're okay, squirt, I swear, I... fuck.
Beside him, Tony’s eyes fixed on Steve’s face. He didn’t turn, but he still knew he was being watched. “View’s quite something.”
, fuck, okay—just sit back down, Steve—”
He looked down at Peter quietly, watching the boy tap against each little cartoon duck that he could see on his sleepsuit. It was an hour or so until their decided ‘bedtime’, but Peter already seemed kind of sleepy, his eyes drooping every now and then as he laid his head heavily into Tony’s shoulder. He was so… innocent. The world, with all its cruelty, hadn’t managed to touch him yet. Even though he’d undoubtedly had a loveless first six months of his life, he was still a happy little boy.
He’d been searching for hours, traipsing through the brutal cold and calling his friends’ names until his voice had gone hoarse as he’d waited for any sign of a rescue party arriving; whether that be in a helicopter or a quinjet. He didn’t care. He’d just wanted
Steve snorted and then picked up the ten dollars from the table. He glanced at it for all of a second before launching forward and shoving it down Tony’s collar, which earnt him a horrified yelp and a quite adorable spasm as his fingers tickled the back of his neck.
Steve’s eyes widened, and he felt Bucky tense in readiness beside him.
“What happened,” he said numbly, gripping the side of the door so tight he thought his fingers would snap, “oh God, what happened, is he- is he-“
Steve gave him a soft kick in the side, and then suddenly felt the air rushing over his face as Tony’s hand curled around his ankle and tugged him down too. He made an embarrassingly high squeaking noise, which quickly turned to a hiss of pain as his ribs flared up painfully-
Steve sighed. “It wasn’t all your fault,” he said softly, worrying at his lip with his bottom teeth. “I never mentioned it was an Unhuman thing. You didn’t know, and you seemed to really love Halloween, and I didn’t want to rain on your parade so I just let you get on with it without giving you a proper reason, just expecting… I dunno, expecting it to go away in the end, I guess.” Steve laughed self-deprecatingly. “And then, surprise surprise, it doesn’t, and I get overly upset by you continuing on with it, despite the fact that I never gave you any real incentive to stop.”
Jesus. He was an asshole.
Slowly, Steve sunk to his haunches next to Tony, glancing over to him and grinning. “And this is the one that may or may not blow up, yes?”
“Blind man’s bluff?”
“Yeah,” Tony said instead, settling in against Steve’s chest with a small smile, thinking of bubbles and giggles and a soft sense of longing at the sight of the man he loved holding a tiny little baby whilst they both slept peacefully on the couch of their home, “yeah, it was good.”
“They’re different countries, Buck, it doesn’t count.”
“What, does the sight of me in your shirt with your come all over me not do it for you?” Tony smiled at him politely, breaking down into chuckles when Steve just groaned despairingly and wound a hand around Tony’s waist, hoisting him over to the bed.
Steve just huffed and hid a smile behind his hand as he pulled Tony into the elevator with him, feeling the all-too-familiar sensation of butterflies in his stomach as Tony smiled up at him.
He landed smoothly right outside the door, slowing his descent to the point where he didn’t even make a noise as he touched down. The door was passcode encrypted, but Tony was Tony, and it didn’t stay that way for long. “Can we get a signal here, J?”
It was definitely disappointing, Tony wasn’t going to lie. He’d been preparing his Halloween costume since the back-end of September in order to look cool for whatever celebrations that would ensue. Now, it seemed that Steve and the rest of their friends weren’t intending on even doing anything.
“Not a captain anymore,” he responded on autopilot, not taking his eyes off the shattered remains of the window, “I’m a- uh- a PI.”
But Thor just smiled, like he understood. “You? Being organized? God, she must have been a scary woman.”
Nodding thankfully, Steve hurried forward and grabbed the pass before speeding out of the room and heading down the corridor. He reached the corner and turned, feet making an obnoxiously loud noise as they scraped against the dirty white tiles.
“He said Bruce’s name!” There was a short pause where someone else—possibly Thor—spoke, and then Clint huffed exasperatedly. “Okay, well, he missed out the ‘R’, so it’s not like, Shakespeare or something, but he was definitely pointing at Bruce when he said it! I’m telling you, the kid’s a genius. Fuck Xavier, we’re definitely gonna get him into MIT or Harvard or something—”
Steve huffed. “That’ll be ‘cause my nose is a little out of action right now. But I’m… I’m fine. Mostly.” When James said nothing, choosing instead to wait, Steve blinked and tried to find the words. “I just had an issue today. With Tony. He, uh, went a bit… weird on me.”
his mind supplied helpfully. He couldn’t see Rumlow.
but unfortunately, he never got around to it.
it was just who Tony was. Yeah, maybe sometimes it made him a little jealous and he’d pout and then kiss Tony a little bit harder, but it had never mattered. Or at least, Tony had never thought that it mattered.
mistake there Steve—oh, and then all the other stuff, about how you missed me, how you wanted to start over, staying the night and then helping me out when that big fuckoff robot tried to crush Santa Barbara. In fact, the only
Except it got worse.
He grinned to himself as he pulled out his phone, Tony’s contact already up on his phone.
“Steve…” Tony shut his eyes and put a hand up, resting his head on it. “You can’t just… it’s not your job to defend my honor-“
And, for whatever reason, it seemed to do the trick. His lopsided lips and wonky teeth gave Steve the opportunity to breathe in deep and and then exhale, once, twice, three times- until he seemed to relax more against the pillows he was resting on.
in there, felt like it was burned into the back of his retinas.
“Fuck,” he managed to say, which caught the attention of Bruce, who was sat on the floor next to Tony’s head. The man shifted and turned to him, a weary smile on his face.
“Of course I’m fucking serious.” Tony clicked his teeth and then looked sullen for a moment before he finally looked Steve in the eye. “The whole world’s fallen apart. We’ve lost everything. I don’t… God, I just want—just come in. I’m tired of being angry. That’s so pre-apocalypse.”
“Does… I mean, which one of them has a motorbike?” Steve couldn’t help himself- he was ridiculously curious, and he just wanted to know as much as he could about the boy with the blue eyes and dark hair as possible. “Pretty expensive looking- leather seats, and really blue eyes- the boy, not the bike, obviously.”
“I really would fucking hope so,” Sam jostled their shoulders together and then held on to his elbow as Steve’s 5-foot-nothing body almost lost footing, “I know this is probably scary as shit- but you’ll get used to it here. We don’t bite. Much.”
Steve grinned smugly, pulling his own one over his head. He noted that it wasn’t quite as big as the one he’d worn before. “The best fun is had whilst wearing the appropriate safety gear, Tony, come on.”
Of course, he got home and the migraines immediately started up again.
Steve shrugged. “like shit,” he said, voice croaky, “how long have I been out?”
have preferred to be chauffeured around in a nice Lamborghini, courtesy of your billionaire boyfriend. Why could he not just swing by? He lives nearer than Bucky anyway.”
“I- I don’t think that’s-“
However, it turned out he didn’t need to. Tony found him. “You know, Maria says she loves me three-thousand,” he started with as he came into the room, and Steve looked up enquiringly while Tony just pointed his finger at him. “Pretty sure that means she loves me most, seeing as you’re somewhere around the 1 to 2 thousand mark.”
Bucky was silent above him, but Steve didn’t look up. His thumb rubbed over the little indent from where ring had met skin, and he hated himself just that little bit more fiercely when he thought about how he could have still been wearing it if he’d have just acted differently. Not been quite such a confrontational idiot about it. Tony was right; if he’d have just given them the money then maybe they would have left. Steve would have been able to pay Natasha back for the money. There was no way to get that ring back.
Tony kissed him quiet again, shooting him a warm smile and unashamedly letting his eyes wander down Steve’s body in wonder. “I’m fine. I’m safe. And it looks like you had fun without me, anyway,” he raises his eyebrows and looks pointedly around the bombshell of a room.
Tony huffs, because really, he’s a grown man, he shouldn’t find being carried like this so comforting. But Steve’s got a nice chest, and it’s easy to just bury his head into the shirt he’s wearing and soak up the warmth and the beat of his heart.
Steve nodded, glancing over at Tony for a second before pulling his gaze back to her. “Yeah,” he agreed with a smile, “Yeah, I am.”
Tony was a good man. A kind man. And a devoted husband.
“What do you mean,
Steve laughed, nodding. “You can count on it, Mr Wilson.”
Ty had told him when he’d first smacked Tony, aged fifteen and in the back-room of some party Tony could hardly even remember
“You should,” Tony snapped, “you’re getting into trouble to try and fight my battles for me, and I don’t… God, I’ve already gotten you into enough shit as it is, you don’t need to do this for me.”
“I’m still mad at you, by the way,” Dad said, but there wasn’t any heat to it, and he smiled a little as Pops looked rather sheepish and nodded. “I do like the thought of us being gross old people who make out in front of everyone, though.”
“I never thought I’d be able to feel things again after my mom passed away,” he murmured, thumb brushing delicately across the back of Tony's ear, feeling the raised edges of the small scars there, “not properly, anyway. I felt like I was doing everything on autopilot. She’d gone, and I couldn’t find much in anything after that. Things just sort of existed around me.”
But he was chained, and he’d been brainwashed, and Tony wasn’t there in the room with him.
Steve swallowed through the dryness in his mouth. “Yes, please.”
. Go fight crime in DC for a few months until your contract is over. Make some friends. Don’t die. And I don’t care if you’re trying to save the world, alright, you call me every night or I’m gonna fly over there and kick your ass, capiche?”
the rational voice told him as he flexed his hands in front of him and willed himself not to shake,
“I can miss the summit.”
By the time that Peter was clean enough to be let out of the bath, both Steve and Tony were pretty much soaked from the waist up, either by soapy residue or splashback from Peter’s movement. Tony silently mourned the state of what had once been a beautiful silk shirt- but a second later when he watched Steve huff and just decide to pull his own T-shirt off entirely, revealing a perfect upper half that Tony had seen countless times but still never quite got used to, he decided that the sacrifice made had been worth it. “Take him out and dry him off, will you?” He nodded to Peter and then stood up, feeling his knees ache as they extended, “I’ll go get his sleepsuit.”
Tony bit his lip, hands rising until they were against Steve’s face. Gently, he pulled the hands that covered his eyes away, revealing Steve’s guilt-stricken expression underneath it.
Certainly a rather swift change in mood, Steve thought as he screamed. “Thor! Thor put me down right now!”
It’d be fun. And possibly sexy. The best combination, in Tony’s eyes.
“Steve, kid, please, next time you have any kind of emergency, let us know before hand,” Mr. Wilson told him toward the end of the call, “that’s non-negotiable. You cannot just leave the house at midnight without telling anyone, okay? That’s not how it works in this house.”
, as he realised that he wasn’t going to be coming home. None of them were. Thanos was going to destroy the entire universe, and take his little girl with it. There was nothing that Steve could do to stop it.
“See, the best thing is that I have no idea whether he’s joking or he really is just that whipped,” Clint perked up at Steve’s other side, looking between them both, “also, if I give you ten bucks would you beat up people for me too?”
“I don’t think any of that, don’t be stupid,” Steve rolled his eyes fondly and smoothed his hand over Tony’s collar, “I just want you to try and help yourself, that’s all. Maybe think about seeing a therapist again. They could help sort through everything. Help you.”
He was pretty sure the guy just hadn’t bothered turning up for school since the week had begun, because otherwise they would have inexplicably managed to run into each other as they always seemed to. But seeing as there had been no mysterious appearances or unfortunate collisions, Steve figured it was because Tony simply wasn’t there.
“I don’t- I do
“Probably, but if it was at any point before midday then you know for sure that I will absolutely not have stored it in my memory,” Clint said, and there was a huff down the line as he undoubtedly took out another guard, “tell him to come back immediately. I don’t like this guy. He’s too jumpy.”
He felt the sinking in his stomach. It was really that obvious, then- he didn’t fit in, didn’t fit in Goddamn anywhere anymore-
“Who are you talking to?” Tony turned, spotting Steve as he came through the doors. He was drenched in a sheen of sweat, bottle in one hand and towel in the other. Tony blushed, tipping out the coffee into their mugs separately.
Steve just frowned, opening his hand until his palm splayed out against the mark and his fingers curled around the top of his shoulder. “No thanks to me.”
Tony took another moment, before shaking his head fondly and then waving a hand. “After you, Rogers,” he responded lightly.
is to make sure no human comes to harm under my supervision.”
It took a moment for Steve to understand.
And he knew that it must have hurt Tony a lot, because he’d… he’d talked about Siberia. Thrown that at Steve like poison, knowing it was the one way to shut him up. Pretty effective, really. There was nothing Steve could respond to that with. Tony was right. No matter how Steve wanted to try and spin it, Tony was-
His cover story was fairly simple. SHIELD had worked out some sort of pattern to Tony’s behaviour, and knew that there was a military base down in Nevada that he was intending to hit next. This was what Steve was also going to use as their link. SHIELD had fabricated a new work profile for him, placing him as a Private Investigator currently under contract with an independent pacifist organisation that wanted him snooping around the facility in order to dig up dirty secrets they were convinced that the US were hiding.
Imagine Tony asking JARVIS where Steve is one afternoon, and he replies that he’s in the art studio Tony designed for him when they first moved in together. Tony’s just arrived back from a business meeting and hasn’t seen Steve in like, at least four days, which is pretty much illegal and just inherently wrong- so he makes his way up to the studio in order to fix that.
. Remember? The big ceremony in Monaco that got crashed by mutant frogs? Then we went on our honeymoon to London and you fell into the Thames trying to take a picture of me. Ring any bells?”
“You’re made of stardust, y’know. Before you became you, and before the world even existed- you were pure stardust. Everything we touch and breathe and exist from is just the remnant of stars, and the gases and elements they created,” Tony whispers into the silent room, watching Steve’s chest rise, in and out and in and out. “The chances of that stardust managing to create you- Steven Grant Rogers- are so
The other boy stopped, and then swallowed and looked down at his knees. The light-heartedness of his manner dropped away, revealing the true anxiety underneath, and suddenly Steve was looking at a boy much smaller than he seemed. “You were mad at me, because I’m an asshole and I told my friends that you were- I didn’t tell them what you really were to me. And it upset you. And I wanted to explain.”
to deal with,” Sam muttered from the corner of the room, but he looked fond as he cast a glance to Steve, “I’m begging you man, put a sign on the door when you start fucking, I don’t wanna be dealing with that-“
He just had to hope that all Steve was about to give Clint was a shove.
He grinned. “I did warn you not to let him stay up too late.”
“Does that come as a surprise?”
Steve pulled his head up and spat at her feet. It was red with his blood. “Go fuck yourself, Nazi scum.”
Steve, of course, said nothing. Tony straightened back up after another second, and then looked up at the ceiling. He didn’t really fancy going through that bloody stairwell again. If they were gonna get out of there, they might as well do it fast. “JARVIS, there are no Avengers that have arrived in the building yet, are there?”
be making all these connections.” Tony waved a hand jerkily, wondering why the hell he was getting so upset about this, but unwilling to stop himself either. He needed to get it out. It needed to be said.
Instead, he was here, and Tony was somewhere in space, and they were all about to die because of a maniacal Titan’s flawed grasp of basic economics.
“Listen to your friend, Steven,” Tony nodded over to him and then took a step backward- only to be tackled from behind by an enthusiastic Thor and hoisted into the air with ease. Steve jumped again, startled by the sudden presence, but Thor just gave him a grin and then twirled Tony around a few times, happily ignoring the boy’s annoyed cries.
The world seemed to slow for a moment or two as Tony’s mind sifted through the meaning of the words, found the overall conclusion in what all this was about. He landed on it slowly, steadily, in the way he always did. Logic first, reaction later.
“You’d have to marry me before we can get divorced,” he mumbled through a warm smile, “and I feel like that would be a bit of a waste of time.”
“You will not harm yourself?” JARVIS asked, and it was more of a plea than a question.
Steve just huffed, and then held out a hand as Tony threw a pair of sweats across the room. “They look like they should fit. I couldn’t find a shirt though- sorry.”
Bucky swallowed and nodded. His eyes went a little harder and he stuck his chin out determinedly. “I’ll make sure of it,” he said firmly.
But then he’d gotten a phone call from the PR team, and everything had gone to shit again.
With a sigh, he stroked his finger down Tony’s jaw, pressing lightly under his chin in order to tilt his head further. Soft lips rested on his forehead and he closed his own eyes, savoring everything that was so familiar, so much like home to him.
Steve
,” Tony hissed, “Rhodey, for God’s sake, all of you need to fucking run—”
It was stupid, really. He probably should have expected something like this to happen eventually, because he’d always sort of known it would. And it felt kind of stupid and overdramatic, saying it like that in his head- and maybe he was overreacting, maybe it had just been making a fuss over nothing- but Steve couldn't really think about it all that pragmatically in his head, not when he was like this. Not when he got upset.
“Don’t fucking touch me, Steve,” he warned, feeling his voice waver as he stumbled back hurriedly, “don’t you dare, Steve, I mean it,
“Oh ha ha,” Bucky said sarcastically, shoving him onto the couch and then jumping on next to him, “I opened up my emotionally stunted heart and you just throw it back in my face like that-“
Paul nodded understandingly. “School takes it outta you, buddy, don’t worry- I’ll keep it down for you. Got some nice lasagna cooking for tonight, though, so you’ll want to be awake for that.”
They stared at one another for a moment.
Thor took the hint, starting forward and then falling into line with Steve with a weary smile. “Well, shall we?” He said, gesturing forward, “I would certainly love to meet the maker of Steve Rogers.”
Steve felt himself being thrown back, landing a good few meters away and sensing the vibrations on the floor as everything was once more turned on it’s head. There were yells and cries of pain from all over the deck; agents forced to the floor, landing amongst the wreckage that was already littered there- but Steve didn’t care about that.
, or use it as material against the other. It’d been an unspoken rule ever since the beginning. Steve knew it was a little unrealistic, really, when in the heat of the moment, you said whatever you could to get your point across, but- well. That didn’t make it any less agonising to hear.
“I’m not—” Steve’s cheeks flushed, and he stroked his hand through Peter’s downy hair once more before stepping away and shrugging nonchalantly. Peter glanced up at him, hands going upward to try and get back the fingers that had previously been running through his hair. He was such an attention-seeker, honestly. “I’m not overreacting. I just know how difficult he can get if you don’t get him down properly.”
He stared in bafflement. “I- I guess we’d go fifty-fifty? Or I pay for it when I take him out, he pays when he takes m-“
Then, his mind apparently made up, he walked back over to Tony, crouching down to his level and getting close enough that their noses brushed. Tony remained still, watching on as Steve pressed their foreheads together and did what Tony could only describe as
Still. The words stung.
People didn’t expect Steve to be particularly smart. He’d noticed it a lot in his time, and in everyone’s defence, he hung around with some of the quickest minds on the planet and so it was easy to regard the simple soldier as nothing more than that. Capable of hitting things when they needed to be hit and making tactical decisions on the field, but nothing more. In reality, however, spending all that time with scientist had paid off. If it wasn’t Bruce talking about biochemistry as he made his morning cup of tea, or Jane describing how she’d set up her latest project, it was Tony talking to him about robotics, about physics, about engineering or whatever it was he’d been focusing on that day. Steve spent half his life in Tony’s workshop watching him work, helping him out when he needed it. He knew how things worked down in places like these.
With a sigh of happiness, he drifted back off again.
“Okay, touché,” Tony rolled his eyes and then kicked back further into the couch, taking Steve with him until he was lying on top of Tony’s chest, “I’ll admit defeat on that one. I think, though, that for now we should just watch the TV and try and recuperate from that intense emotional conversation we just had. I can only take so many feelings before I require 49 hours of isolation –“
-And then four hours later, he awoke again.
Steve realized he hadn’t breathed in a while, so he took in a sharp breath and used it as an excuse to look downward. “You- uh-“ he stumbled, “you… live? Where? Where do you live- that’s the one.”
The room had gone silent. Even Bruce, who was napping on the tabletop, had lifted his head a little in surprise.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded, holding Sam’s gaze firmly, “yeah, I do.”
Tony shook his head and gave him an unimpressed look, and Steve clamped up quickly. The embarrassment and shakes were mingling together, creating some sort of terrible mutant emotion that felt like it was clawing at him from the inside out. He just wanted to go home.
proud of, and something I know you’re proud of too. Just remember that, alright?” He kissed Tony’s hand lightly, waiting for Tony to nod in understanding before he settled back into the pillows once more. “You really should sleep. It’s been a long day.”
, supposedly. Your car’s parked out front, anyway.”
James voice got a few notes lower, more concerned. “Go on.”
Tony thought vaguely, his head foggy and pained. His leg was on fire underneath him, like an inferno running through his mangled bone. Steve bent down and grabbed Tony by the collar, fist raising and aiming for his face. The hit was brutal- right in his eye, sending white spikes of nothingness through his vision as he reeled back. He was going to black out in a second, and then Steve would beat him to death, and that would be that. No more romantic evenings in, no more wedding ring in the bottom-left drawer of his workshop desk, nothing, zilch, nada. Over. Steve was going to kill him in the communal room of their home instead.
In the distance, he saw Tony’s frame, stumbling forward, hand outstretched.
No particular reason. Sometimes sleep just wouldn’t come and didn’t stay. He’d long since grown used to that fact about himself. But it always got worse when he was under stress, and what with everything that had been going on lately, he really wasn’t surprised when he blinked his eyes open and saw 7am staring back at him. Against his spine, Steve was still pressed up and sleeping peacefully, giving off little snores now and then. Tony was still for a moment, letting the noise of the other man’s breaths wash over him. His own chest felt tight, muscles wound up with a latent energy that had him tensing without even realising it, but he tried to settle back down and at least get a few more minutes of rest before starting his day again. He’d only regret it later, when he was sat at that dumb meeting in Pennsylvania and doing everything in his power not to fall asleep.
Steve smiled with full cheeks and pressed another kiss to Tony’s face, even when the man yelled and smacked him away. “Ew,
She chastised, turning to him sharply. He shut his mouth immediately, shame burning in his gut. He was yelling at Mrs. Wilson- God, what was
Tony took in a large breath of air, shifting around on the couch. “Mm,” he said, “tired.”
Wherever he'd gone, Steve wanted him to come back home. To Steve. To his team. Where he belonged.
“And if you seriously think that, you don’t know yourself well enough either,” Steve told him, “Tony, Jesus, look-“
This was just a sham though. This was Steve offloading all the emotions he’d carried with him, using it as a way to bring Tony’s guard down. It wasn’t real, and it couldn’t ever be. Because in that year that Steve had imagined those scenarios, Tony had destroyed villages and stolen Weapons of Mass Destruction and got himself on SHIELD’s Most Wanted list. Steve didn’t know how, or why, but what he knew was that the man in front of him was a
“It’s beautiful.
, actually,” Steve told them haughtily, “the first time, anyway.”
into shit?” Steve blinked at him incredulously, “Tony, it’s
Tony went blank at that, and Steve hurried to justify himself. “I’m sorry, it’s pathetic, I know it is- that’s what I was saying last night, Tony, I wasn’t talking about you, I swear, I was talking to
This was everything Tony had always been terrified of.
Hang on a second.
Like he could sense it—which, thanks to Steve’s rather uncanny ability to smell emotions, was probably the case—Steve paused, pulling away and looking down at Tony. “You’re nervous,” he said with a small frown, brushing his thumb over Tony’s lip, “what’re you nervous about, huh?”
He needed to stop checking his watch every two minutes.
“The things I love don’t stay,” he murmured, voice becoming even more slurred, and Steve figured his energy must have been leaving him- spent from the emotional breakdown, “things I love jus’… get hurt. I hurt them without even… an’ mamma, an’ Jarvis an… it’ll happen, it’ll…” he stopped making sense after that- at least, to Steve he did; spiraling off into muttered Italian that Steve couldn’t understand, before groaning suddenly and pushing a hand through his hair. “God, I am way too drunk,” he said through a huff of air.
The universe stood still for a second as the memory in his head clicked back to place in startling,
Oh. Fuck, yeah, that was probably important. Steve shot off the first part of his old address in Brooklyn, before cutting off jerkily as he remembered that that wasn’t his home any more. That place was probably stripped bare and put up for sale for some random stranger to poke and prod and look in, now. Ha.
“Okay guys- looks like we’re having a surprise team training session today,” Steve finally said, in response to Tony’s look. “Hide and seek, in the tower. If you get caught, you gotta help the seeker to find the ones who are still in the game. Thor, buddy, do you know how to play, or do you want us to go through it with you too-”
“Steve,” Tony said with a shake of his head, “he won’t. It’s an empty threat. He’s full of shit and he cares about Howard’s opinion of him too much to risk ruining it. If he exposed me, he’d expose himself. He wouldn’t do that. I’m fine.”
He tried to focus on the details, but they were already too far away for him to reach, whatever temporary link or final waves of frequency having dissipated for good. Underneath him, Tony shifted a little, aware of Steve’s movements. He hummed, mostly asleep. “You okay?” He slurred.
annoying,” he declared, pointing to his shirt in evidence, “look, he ruined my clothes. Little gremlin,”
“That’s not what Ty was saying!” Steve threw his hand back in the direction of the corridor, “Tony, please- this is bigger than just us-“
“Nngh,” Steve murmured decidedly, rolling further into Tony’s side and nestling his head against the skin of Tony’s shoulder. A morning Supersolider was a clingy supersoldier, and Tony sighed at the challenge ahead of him. Disentangling himself was going to take skill and tactical ingenuity. Luckily, Tony was more than capable of both those things.
But it
Tony quickly pulled them out of the room, both of them smiling like idiots as they hopped over their friends’ bodies and made their way out the door. “Use a condom!” Steve heard Bruce call quietly after them, and he almost turned around to shoot the boy a scathing look, but ended up finding himself getting tugged out the door before that could happen.
The other boy swallowed a little nervously, but he smiled. “Yeah,” he said, “I just… you know, I fucked up on the first time ‘round, yeah, but- I’m older now, and I’m going to have to go to college somewhere after this shitshow we call highschool is over, so I figured I might as well, you know? I don’t… I probably won’t get in, not when they have my records, but I know some of the professors and they kind of understood, at the time, why I was pulling the shit I was and-“ he broke off, taking a quick breath and then shrugging. When he looked back to Steve, there was something unquestionably grateful in his bright blue eyes. “You made me think I wasn’t quite such a failure,” he murmured, fingers brushing back Steve’s hair again, “that maybe I could… be who I am. Do what I actually enjoy. Or something.”
He saw Tony tense up and stop moving, the smile dying on his face a little. “I…” he began, throat working nervously, “I mean- I’m not… it’s….”
Maybe he’d just loved his mom very, very much.
“Oh,” Sam poked him in the butt with his foot as they both made their way down the stairs, “Darce is downstairs, she’s having dinner with us until her parents can pick her up.”
, that had always been what they were. Tony was going to marry him and live out the rest of his life with Steve’s last name and a ring on his finger that bound him to the other man forever and he
The boy reached over the table and offered his hand. Slightly more wary now, Steve returned the motion- but nothing cracked or was otherwise maimed, and he sighed in relief.
Fuck, he was tired. For the sake of his own fragile sanity, he should probably stop thinking about this shit.
“We’ll find a vehicle.” That was Steve, always unwilling to give up, even when Thor and Hulk couldn’t make it over, even when they’d been stuck down in a fucking basement sitting on their useless asses for twenty minutes while someone or something had undoubtedly stormed their tower and taken their little boy from them. “Hawkeye, Nat, is there-- is there
The voice cut off, and left deafening silence in Steve’s ear. He kept the phone pressed to his face; frozen to the spot.
a genius-”
Steve realised they were slowing down, Loki pulling up the curb next to their apartment, and suddenly all that pent-up energy went into action. Opening the door while they were still slowing to a halt, Steve stumbled out of the moving car and then barely managed to keep on his feet, hearing Loki yell at him from the driver’s seat. He ignored the other boy, instead hurrying over to Thor’s door and pressing repeatedly on the intercom. “It’s Steve,” he breathed, “Thor, open up, it’s—”
Steve raised his eyebrows. Even he could tell Tony was lying, that time. His words hadn't just been confrontational. They'd been defensive. Defensive of someone else- probably the kid, if the last part of their conversation together had been anything to go by. "What's his name?" He asked in the end.
Tony… Tony wanted to. He was almost certain of it.
“Well I’m not staying there, let me fucking tell you that,” Steve snapped, and Tony turned to him briefly, eyes sharp.
“It’s Tony.”
Steve kept his eyes fixed on the shirt he was folding in front of him. “Birthday plans,” he lied, before spinning around to face Tony, preparing to usher him back out of the door.
“No.”
Bucky just shrugged, fiddling with his gun. “I dunno. I was thinking some calf stretches.”
He laughed to himself, and Tony smiled back, then turned his head away slightly. “Sounds… a tad unwise,” he said evenly.
“Oh, as if you haven’t seen Oceans 11 a hundred times,” Tony snapped back at her as she rolled her eyes, “I see the way you look at Clooney, don’t even deny it.”
Steve laughed. “I’ll text you later. Oh, and you should probably stay away from Brooklyn for a few weeks”
“…but if you don’t want… sorry, I shouldn’t have just—I jumped in with that,” Tony’s words stumbled over themselves in their haste, and Steve realised that his own gutted expression must have given Tony the wrong idea, “I know it’s… you don’t feel that way, which is fine, I can… I can pull some strings, get you a new passport. You don’t have to stay—”
Tony had always known this was coming.
“Nuh uh, don’t ‘Rhodeybear’ me and then say something self-sacrificial and dumb,” the man cut in, waving a hand, “we’re not leaving, Tony, because leaving would require abandoning you.”
“Stay away from Darcy Lewis. She’s unpredictable on a good day.”
He was cut off by the hard press of Tony’s hand against his mouth, and was pushed into an upright position when Tony tilted his head up and looked at him deeply, a horrified expression on his face. His brow was furrowed so deeply that Steve could’ve stuck a coin between the creases. “What?” He whispered, shaking his head wildly, “Steve,
“That why Tasha’s collecting every vaguely sharp item she can find in this place?” Tony nodded his head over to the steadily growing pile, where Natasha was now sat carving what had once been the arm of a rocking chair into a pointed spear.
It was wonderful. Steve was almost sorry when they finally arrived at their destination eight hours later.
"No, we just thought he could make himself a sandwich or something, you know?"
“Alright,” Thor conceded in the end, “if you think that’s what’s best. At the very least, we’ve got guns now.” He waved to the bodies around them and picked up a fallen weapon from the body of a dead HYDRA goon, and then tossed it over to Steve. “Be careful. Don’t take unnecessary risks.”
But there was nothing. All quiet on that front, which meant this was a SHIELD-operated mission, and not just general damage control. Alright then.
“Quit makin’ everything about yourself and go make out with your boyfriend somewhere else,” Bucky told him with a wave of his hand, before stopping and then actually turning around. “Wait- before you go, Tony, you wanna go pick some stuff outta my closet to wear tomorrow? You could probably get some from Sam, but his sizes might be a bit small for you.”
Steve paused at that, and Tony looked at him warily, wondering if that was too far. He and Steve had been officially dating for a month and four days now, which wasn’t a lot, in normal standards. But neither of them had ever actually been in a relationship before, and- well. Tony wasn’t lying. He
Ty grinned, bumping shoulders with him as he passed. It made Steve want to punch the asshole. “Good,” he said softly, “I’ll see you tonight then.”
It gave him Tony.
“Steve,” Reed said, and he blinked and realised that the man was waiting for Steve to step out of the elevator and follow him further into his laboratory. Steve told himself to move, staring vacantly at the place as he walked into it. He’d never been here before. He couldn’t say he knew Reed Richards or any of the Fantastic Four particularly well, to be honest— it had always been Tony who’d visited, so that he could hash out something or another with a fellow scientist or just go and harass Johnny for an hour or so.  He wondered, idly, how everyone else was dealing with this. Had Johnny Storm seen the news? Had he watched them cart Tony’s corpse away and sat, devastated, on his couch at home?
Tony waved a hand carelessly, not taking his eyes off Steve. "I'll fall magically ill, come on, this is more important."
Yanking off the bedsheets clumsily, he stumbled out of bed and then pushed his door open, padding down the stairs in complete darkness. He was still half-asleep, second-guessing whether or not the entire thing had just been a dream and he was going to open the door to the living room and find that no one was even there, and never had been.
Steve chuckled and got to his feet, hand locking with Tony’s as they both wandered to the entrance on the other side. Getting to his knees, Steve crawled into the entrance, framed by what appeared to be a stack of books, and then his mouth dropped open.
Steve walked in, and the sound hit him like a wall. Hundreds of kids were milling around, talking and laughing and moving through the crowds with ease, and for a moment he felt a little overwhelmed. That was… a lot of new faces. They all seemed to know exactly where to go and what to do, and then there was him- stuck out like a sore thumb, with his too-small frame and too-large backpack, he must look like a fucking idiot-
“And on a scale of one to ten, how successful do you think it was?” He wandered forward, eyes straight back to where they had been five minutes ago- on Steve.
“What did my poor cigarette ever do to you?” Tony asked him, pouting slightly as he dug his hand deeper into his pocket and then started pulling out another.
What was fucking wrong with him?
“Always an added bonus.”
His phone pinged, and he pulled it from his pocket without thinking, checking the number briefly. Then he stopped. Looked again. Looked some more.
, his mind informed him, as if he wasn’t already fucking aware. That had been the thing he’d kept falling back to, every single time he was left alone with his thoughts. This had happened because of him, whether it was intentional or not. He’d made Tony feel like he needed to prove that he wasn’t ashamed of Steve, made him feel guilty about not being as open as he could’ve been—like that even fucking
Clint pulled a face, but leaned back all the same. “I’ll show you all,” he muttered, “he’s a child prodigy, I’m calling it now.”
Tony blinked rapidly, hands flexing against his side as he shook his head. It was stupid. Steve was sleeping, because it was fuck’o’clock in the morning and he didn’t get up past 10 unless he had some pent-up energy he needed to run off. Steve was just sleeping. He swallowed down the urge to rush over to him, and instead walked stiffly over to his wardrobe, picking out the suit he was going to be wearing with shaking fingers. Behind him, Steve continued to sleep silently, face buried into the pillow so that his breaths were stifled. Not
Tony seemed to like it though, because when he glanced back at Steve, this time with a toothbrush in his mouth, he glanced upward at it and then laughed fondly, his eyes shining with affection. “Y’r ‘dorable,” he declared messily.
. “You… I made you feel like you had to choose me over Ty, and think you needed to prove you weren’t ashamed of me or whatever, and I don’t—I never… it was me. Your dad kicked you out because of me, and I’m sorry, Tony. I can’t tell you how much. I never wanted you to… not that this was your fault, at all, okay, it was me being stupid and shitty and—”
