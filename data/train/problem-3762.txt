‘’I’m going to try.’’ He grunted out trough clenched teeth.
‘’Grew up alongside 2 of them, kinda rubs off I guess, Sam wasn't around yet, but he's starting to get there. ''
‘’I remembered Castiel once using a tracking spell to find Balthazar, I just didn’t remember how he did it, so I searched for it on the internet and get this; we only need myrrh, human blood and holy water and do we have anything from Castiel?’’
''C'mon Cas.''
Cas eyed Chuck.
But something about Dean intrigued Cas, it pulled him in and made Cas look at the stranger like he was a puzzle waiting to be solved. It was new to Cas, because- it went deeper than some beautiful green eyes and a cute smile.
‘’Good to know that even after all these years, you still can’t face me alone.’’
Sam took both of Castiel’s legs into his hands and they lifted him.
‘’You couldn’t. I’m smarter than you think and you can’t write me in your dumb stories.’’
‘’Woah, Uriel, I’m sensing you’re holding a bit of a grudge against poor old Castiel?’’
‘’When everything is nothing.. I, I need to live without you?’’
This was brand new information to Dean.
Castiel cringed at the nickname. He always hated it when somebody else besides Sam and Dean used it.
‘’I wish I knew Cas, I wish I knew.’’
‘’When Jack was dying, I made a deal to save him.’’
Betrayal showed on Castiel’s face instantly and he pulled against the restrains weakly.
Castiel was smiling at the conversation, he was happy it was not problem to Sam, he always known Sam suspected something.. maybe Sam knew before Castiel himself knew. But still, he and Dean we're Sam's brothers.
‘’Don’t know- they, they’re all, talking-‘’
‘’You woke me up at 3AM to go.. smoke? Couldn't that wait?’’
But now that he was, along with his family, it was scary as hell.
He stopped by an abbandoned warehouse.
Dean closed the laptop after their third movie in a row and asked Cas something.
‘’Right, English.. Cas?’’
Castiel felt something warm flow through his stomach, the same feeling he got when Dean was the one smiling at them.
He wasn’t sure who he was talking to.
left the bunker.
‘’If I say I did, will you go away?’’
‘’Sure, show me that clean shirt.’’
Dean went to sit in the chair placed next to the bed, while Gabriel sat in the one before it.
‘’Come in!’’ Dean shouted, instantly recognising the pattern. And absolutely not wanting to get up yet.
‘’Nah, I’m good Sammy. And I won’t be able to sleep until we find the idiot and I whooped his ass for ditching us like that.’’
''I'm sorry Cas, but this is going to hurt like a bitch.'' Sam muttered.
‘’He isn’t at peace, he told me he hated that place, it’s worse than hell because at least hell is something.’’
He seemed to take ages.
Tw// Child abuse/neglect, homophobia, homophobic slurs, recreational drug use (weed) and mentions of alcoholism
Empty deals quickly forgotten as Dean let himself drown in the feelings of kissing Cas.
''No offense, I'm glad you're here. But how?''
He was worried that Cas had enough of Dean’s bullshit and would turn his back on him forever.
‘’Why are you telling me this?’’
(I may even make another fic about the recovery part)
‘’…So that’s why I’m slowly draining his grace to become human.’’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘’Yeah?’’
Castiel felt eyes in the back of his head again, he turned around and was met with the same green eyes from before, but this time he also got a better look of the guy’s face, accompanied with the brightest eyes Castiel had ever seen were a refined jawline, pink plump lips, and a button nose that was slightly crooked near the end, freckles were scattered all over the strangers face and his hair was somewhere between blonde and brown, a buzzcut in the late stages of growing out, with messy strands of hair sticking out.
Dean didn’t agree, he could think about a lot that he could say and give to Cas.
‘’Great. Get on with it.’’
Castiel was still out of it but at least he wasn’t glowing anymore.
_______
‘’Everything dies eventually.’’
He soon found what he was looking for. Luke, his best friend which he shared a room with, was currently talking to a girl, because- of course he was, he was showing her something on his phone and smiled a big toothy grin at her as soon as she looked up, making her burst out in laughter and elbow him in his side, he pretended to be hurt and put an arm around her shoulder when she rolled her eyes at him, eventually he noticed Castiel, excused himself to the girl and made his way over to him, Castiel felt slightly more relaxed knowing Luke wanted his company.
He knew where her collection was, he just hoped that she hadn’t left and headed for the bunker already.
Meaning Cas and Dean had the bunker all to themselves, naturally that meant they were now laying in bed, worn out and sweaty.
‘’A magician doesn’t tell his secret Cassie.’’
‘’Hey Sam, we’re grabbing pancakes, you okay with not counting calories for a second?’’
‘’I’m Castiel, but friends call me Cas.’’
Normally Castiel wouldn’t care much about the family of one of his random hook ups.
‘’We’re in.’’ Dean said eventually, after looking at Sam who had nodded.
‘’I love you too.’’
Sam didn't waste more time they didn't have and pulled the hook going through Castiel's right wing out as fast as he could.
Don't hesitate to comment or leave some kudos, I really appreciate it :)

‘’Please. Just say it Dean.’’
on campus!’’ Castiel whispered angrily.
Cas smiled back.
‘’Hey Cassie, had a nice ride?’’
''Looks like I'm not the only role model.
''I hope we blew him right back to his own world.''
‘’That’s right.’’
But at this very moment, he was having difficulties with not screaming.
Castiel didn’t listen to the voice in his head telling him this was going to be a disaster and said;
‘’I don’t deserve this! Cas- Castiel is your enemy.. He killed you dammit!’’
''Gabe told me he’s been having a hard time at home, and school,  I think he might not be talking about anything anymore to anyone in that house, we were close as well.’’
‘’Yeah, me too.’’
The blue flash bounced up and down and circled around Castiel’s vessel before going in.
Chapter 4
Show him what he showed you.’’
‘’You know ever since we met, ever since, I pulled you out of hell. Knowing you has changed me.
‘’Except what?’’
Sam and Dean were holding Cas between them when Michael appeared out of nowhere.
Dean slowly dragged ruby’s knife over his hand and after muttering a few words in Latin he put it down in the middle of the trap, he then touched the cross with his still bleeding hand and said the Enochian part of the spell, lastly he pulled out the pedals of the flower from purgatory and said a line in leviathan ( yeah, those motherfuckers had their own language, and it sucked ).
Gabriel. No- It couldn’t be?
‘’Yeah.’’
somewhere close to him.
It took all three of them to carry Dean inside, Castiel was glad he was still unconscious.
''I don't think that's a good plan. It's a recipe for for disaster, and Michael will know.''
Castiel pulled his right wing (which had escaped more damage than his left) close to his body, so Dean could lay down next to him.
Because what came next was thousand of screams, flashes of light, thunder, high pitched cries, and Gabriel glowing furiously bright in the middle of it.
‘’Cas, you really do know how to make a man blush.’’
He wanted to say something witty and smart but his tongue wouldn’t move.
Then he looked away from Dean and whispered.
‘’The empty. It will take you.’’
She dumped him in the back of a white van, before closing the doors she took a set off Enochian cuffs out of her pocket.
Gabriel turned around and when he was almost out of sighed he yelled.
Gabriel stared at Dean, then back to his brother.
Castiel jumped at Meg yelling right next to his ear and accidentally spilled some of his beer on his shirt, he tried to rub some of it off with his hands, but when it stained he sighed and doomed it a lost cause.
He just wanted to give up.
''They aren't just normal
He’d looked Dean straight in the eye. And said that.
The room was full of screens with Castiels face on it.
‘’Sammy!’’
Michael waved his hand and Castiel was send flying across the room. He landed with his back against the wall, being pinned against it by an invisible force.
The room seemed to be completely empty, no sign of Cas in sight.
The sound of a gunshot pierced through the air.
Thanks for reading and enjoy the chapter!
‘’Just go faster, I think this Louise woman is actually able to hurt Cas bad.’’
blindly with Sam’s life.’’
Gabriel sighed.
‘’You good?’’
‘’Bitch.’’
''Go to...hell.'' Castiel rasped.
‘’I know Cas. It’s okay.’’
‘’Not.’’
The angel looked lost.
But he knew better now.
Yeah no, Castiel could see right through that act.
‘’Good.’’
It was tender, soft, slow, and everything a first kiss should be.
Dean didn’t listen as Chuck went on his little rant, because the motherfucker had turned his back to them and was now talking to thin air as he walked across the room doing his villain speech.
Because Dean couldn’t say it and Cas thought it meant he didn’t care.
This was going to be a long drive.
When Castiel asked a question Dean asked it back, and when Castiel told a story Dean would listen and ask questions. It seemed like Dean wanted to get to know Castiel just as much as Castiel wanted to get to know Dean.
He would never stop protecting Dean, Sam and Jack.
‘Yes I fucking love him! But he doesn’t deserve me…
‘’The most surprising thing about all this, might be your coming out scene Cas. Not a big fan of the ‘’gays have to die in a tragic way and never get what they want’’ trope but at least it was romantic and dramatic, I love me some sacrificing for the people you love. but I think Sam and Dean know all about that.’’
Castiel just looked at him with sadness in his eyes, with an apology that said ‘’sorry for dragging you into this’’ and with something else that Dean couldn’t but also could place.
''Cas? Hey, you with us?'' Dean asked wanting to turn around and look at the angel really bad, but keeping his eyes on the road instead.
''He will never say yes.''
‘’Yeah, they’re all big pains in my ass though.’’
_____________________________________
Chuck snapped his finger and the tv-screen was back.
Maybe heaven
’’ She said the word as if was something poisonous, something wrong.
‘’I hope you spill something on your shirt again soon Cas.’’
There was a voice he couldn’t
‘’Wich would be a shame because…?’’
Chuck let out a scream.
His headache had come back twice as strong, he felt uneasy, and his grace was shuffling weirdly- like it was trying to fight against something that wasn’t there.
‘’Why are you doing this?’’
‘’We can talk about it later Cas.. You already have way too much to deal with. This can wait. I can wait. You hear me?’’
''Did you know, that angel wings are the most sensitive part about an angel? They are attached directly to Castiel's grace. The agony he must have felt when his entire body was hanging on them.. it's a shame it had to go like that. But I must say-''
Dean knew that was an open wound that didn’t need any salt just yet.
‘’Right, time to get to work.’’ Dean said to no one.
‘’Yeah.’’ Dean scratched the back of his head. ‘’That’s one word for it I guess, the guy I shared the room with dropped out in the first week, administration
Chuck nodded and Dean’s face became angry instead of confused, and he was able to stand on his own feet again.
But you can't say yes. We will get Cas to safety, but not by saying yes.''
The waitress that took their orders was staring off into the distance in front of the checkout, the couple in front of her completely frozen too. And some people had food halfway on it’s way to their mouth.
‘’SAM!’’
''Cas, can I compare your wings to those of a bird? Or is there a really big difference I should know about before I do something?''
‘’What do you mean?’’
‘’Hey! It’s bigger than most clowns could say they’ve had here on campus.’’
‘’Yes, Chuck..’’ He closed his eyes and took a breath before talking again.
‘’Dean? What do you want? I told you I haven’t seen the damn thing!’’
‘’It hurts.. so much.. ‘’ Castiel could feel tears forming at the edges of his eyes.
It grew louder in mere seconds, Castiel dropped the coffee Dean had handed him and groaned at the piercing headache that usually came along with his siblings feeling stressed.
‘’Cas you want to do this now?’’
‘’Dean..? ‘’
Castiel had been trying to avoid this topic for a while now, he just wanted to bathe in the presence of Dean’s happiness, Dean’s contentedness, for a little while longer.
After that they drove silent for a few minutes. Until Dean broke it by cursing loudly.
In the end it didn't matter.
‘’I’m sorry
When Dean wasn't asleep or on a hunt with Sam they would sit in Castiel's room and watch movies, movies that had been brought out recently so Castiel wouldn't spoil the entire thing because of the knowing every book/movie thing Metatron had done to him.
‘’I’m sorry Cas.’’
‘’Shit, Cas I’m sorry.’’
‘’Chathour is over guys, time to get to the fun part!’’ Louise announced.
He screamed into an empty room where just a minute ago, h̶̶i̶̶s̶̶ ̶b̶̶e̶̶s̶̶t̶̶ ̶f̶̶r̶̶i̶̶e̶̶n̶̶d̶̶ Cas had been until his lungs burned.
But right now. The thing he wanted more than honour, was to get out of here and get back to Dean.
‘’What?’’ Chuck laughed. ‘’Do you really think that the Empty would just break
''We need to fix my wings first, I think they may be keeping the rest of my vessel from healing.''
Castiel woke up.
And Cas couldn’t- he didn’t want either of them to die. Or see the other die.
‘’You tell me I’m just like one of them.’’
‘’You looking for this?’’ A voice vaguely familiar said as an arm reached over next to Dean’s shoulder with the remote in hand.
''Damn Cas.'' Dean smiled. That one smile Castiel had grown to love, the one that was real, that existed of real hapiness.
‘’Why?’’
She took a blindfold and placed it before Castiel’s eyes, she then checked his cuffs (who were still very much closed even though Castiel had bleeding wrist because he tried to get out of him with all his strength) and forced him to his feet as she guided him into a building.
‘’if angels don’t need sleep… You think I do?’’ Gabriel said without looking up from watching Castiel.
But his state was much worse this time.
Neither Cas or Dean reacted so Sam rolled his eyes and went to the showers.
‘’Owh I just do my research, read the internet.. those great Winchester novels helped quit a bit. And now I get to add you to my collection! You will fit right in. And, I know for a fact, that if you touch the Winchester’s pet angel.. they will come running right into your arms! So don’t worry, you won’t be alone for too long Cas.’’
At least that wasn’t how Dean thought of it.
‘’I fell asleep working on it, and I woke up a second before you knocked on the door.’’
And they needed him right now.
‘’M’sorry, of course.’’
''Hello Dean.''
‘’What kind of deal?’’
‘’Go away and stop calling me that.’’
‘’It’s a nice change for once, my roommate never cleans his room in our dorm, and honestly I
There was too much trauma from where other angels had touched them while he was being ‘’re-educated’’ a long time ago.
Dean gathered that Cas’s extended gaze was an answer.
‘’It would just be putting yourself and Sam in danger, you needed to know where you were going into. Im fine now.’’
On the floor of the frozen room was his friend, Cas was wearing some hideous walmart version of an angel and were those? His wings.. No. They we’re probably also fake. Cas had told them he’d lost them in the fall. But they looked so real? And was that bone..? Yeah okay, maybe not-fake then. What the hell?
‘’It’s your funeral.’’
But he couldn't say yes, not again.
Sam closed his laptop and announced he was getting a shower for real.
‘’Good.’’
‘’So, you want me to wake Castiel up from
‘’Jerk.’’
"Good Evening Castiel." "It was a woman's voice, it sounds vaguely familiar. Than he was hit in the back with something and he fell into the darkness.
Castiel stood up slowly and chuck rushed in to help him.
‘’Any last words?’’ Dean said as they stood in front of the door.
*I'm not American. I am lesbian. No but for real, I'm dutch. So if I make any typo's uhhh.. yeh you can blame me. I re-read my fics myself but probably won't notice them until I've finished this fic and one day decide I want to laugh at myself. :)
‘’After that he wanted me to sleep because I wouldn’t be in any pain when I would loose my grace completely.
It didn’t take long before Sam and Dean reached a motel.
He wasn’t going to stop until he’d found a way to find Cas.
‘’No, what did he steal?’’
‘’Ha! I knew it!’’
He’d felt it coming for a long time.
Castiel woke with a gasp.
Cas looked down at his very obviously once white shirt that was now stained
Castiel was not going to admit that the pancakes didn’t taste like monocles, because they shouldn’t.
‘’Go stand guard. God is dramatic, he will come through the front door if he’s in a good mood. And he visited the Winchesters. So he will be.’’
Finally he fell to the ground, Castiel had to roll over so the now empty vessel didn't fall on him.
‘’Get you and your brother in that room or I will kill Castiel. And believe me I can, I’ve had enough time to train on other angels.’’
''Owh? So Sammy didn't know about your little deal? You didn't tell the Winchesters! Well, it's gonna be a pleasure seeing Dean's face after I break the news to him. He was so happy having a win with... not strings attached.''
I’m not another of your machine’s to control.’’ he said defiantly.
You just go and find Jack, he’s been gone for too long and I have a feeling you know better where the kid might be than me.’’
He needed to clear his head.
‘’What?’’
His feet were aching, and he was tired.
This one took longer for Dean to answer he looked out the window, lost in his thoughts, and after a long time sighed and looked at Sam.
‘’But you’re hurting, and you need to talk about it. If you’re not ready then it can wait. But sometimes it can feel really good to get something off of your chest.’’
‘’You’ve been staring at the guy for 2 minutes straight, If I didn’t interfere your eyes
‘’Fuck!” He slammed his hand down on the wheel in frustration.
''Dean, if you're in there. I'm sorry.'' He said when he plunched his Angel blade into Michaels leg.
or so to speak your only option besides Castiel suffering for eternity stuck between heaven and hell or resting in peace, is that when he comes back to your world, he can never come back to mine.’’
‘’Cas?’’
Still Castiel must face his greatest fears to find peace in his new human life.
‘’We.. ‘’ Dean looks away, focussing on something in the distance and probably asking himself if he should share whatever was going on in his mind with Cas.
Castiel punched Michael in the face and the archangel fell to the ground.
‘’They can be helpful… yes.’’ Castiel said with a smirk.
''No...'' Castiel whispered.
Family issues sucked ass.
Chuck lied.
Dean was having a meltdown, right in front of god. And he couldn’t give less of a shit.
‘’Fair enough. But I had some news on Cas. I mean, if you’re not interested- I can just be on my way… ‘’
Dean stared at the ground, then after a few more slow breaths he said; ’’It would only, it would only come, when- if, he found true happiness.’’
"What?" Cas asked dumbly.
"What's so wrong with that?"
"No..., they're on your couch. I'm sure Sam wouldn't mind joining them."
"Why do you think they're cute? They were whispering so much, trying to keep it a secret. Good try, though. They're just a bunch of faggots throwing themselves in front of everyone, showing things no one wants to see."
"And that image?"
"We just like raining on your parade," Dean started.
"No, more so vengeance."
As their boarding group number got closer to being called, Cas felt Dean begin to tense up, knowing that they would be trapped in a flying cylinder within the next half-hour. Cas tightened his grip, trying to give off some of his calm energy through touch.
He looked back upon the house with a deep sigh. Everything was dark except for a single lamplight peeping through the living room window. Dean got out of the impala, trying to get his emotions under control before going in, locking the door behind him. He still felt jumpy from the long day, as if anything was going to come out of the darkness. The feeling only let up with the front door securely locked behind him with the alarm set, letting the scent of home and his omega finally calm him down.
"Driving wouldn't be an option," Sam muttered.
Mary interrupted, pulling herself off the floor "This book was sent here, and we were just looking through it."
"Sam?"
They both paused. Dean was about to say something, backpedal somewhat, but Sam came rushing over with books toppling over in the stack. He went straight to his teacher, showing him each and every one of them. To his credit, he pulled all of his attention to the pup, not acting like something weird had happened.
"Come on, guys," Dean tried pleading. "You have to go to school."
"He might have. His older brother was around," Dean groaned. "I'm pretty sure he hates me, and nothing I ever do is going to be good enough for him."
"You know, I come to work so that I don't have to see you molesting my brother," Lucifer casually said, as if it wasn't a big deal, even though one could see annoyance simmering under the surface,
Cas could feel Dean look up at the other omega. Amara gave the two of them a wink. "Yeah, she's definitely up to something."
"I said to make nice."
"Are you sure? I mean, lots of people come in. Maybe you're just missing it," Dean hoped.
"Wait, wait. What happened before his heat?" Pam asked.
Some of the steam left Lucifer's sails as he turned back to his brother. "So, nothing happened."
Remembering what he was working on when he left, Dean lost the smile. "What did I miss?" he asked as the doors closed.
"And if I don't?" John asked.
"Just don't look it up anything else about it," Dean interrupted, head still against the table."
"Friday!" he exclaimed.
The cavern they were all now standing in was wide and spacious, leaving enough room that they didn't have to walk in a single file line. As the tunnel only went in two directions, the group went in the direction that led toward the center of the district.
"Terrible."
"Dean?" Sam asked. "Can you read us a story?"
"Should we be worried?"
"Oi," she yelled out, "Why don't we keep the smells down?"
Sam sighed in response. "One: they have names. Two: they've been helping us. Three: they're not evil in any way; Cas would have been able to tell. At this point, you just need to deal with it."
"Unfortunately, I live in the real world, which you all seem to not be able to do. How did you not see the utter train wreck that occurred in that court?"
"The one on the ceiling, John," Mary said, interrupting the conversation before turning to Bobby. "We were hoping that you would be able to help us. I've never heard of anything being able to resurrect the dead back into their original bodies."
He felt ahead fall against his leg as Dean situated himself in front of him, resting in front of his mate, with all of his family surrounding him. It was perfect, he thought to himself. The thing that he always wanted. The room was filled with laughter, mostly from the adults, while the children looked back at them, confused at what they could possibly find so funny.
"Don't mind if I do."
"What the hell?" Dean muttered at his back as he went downstairs.
"You won't touch either one," Emily spat through the haze of red as she wanted to strangle the thing in front of her, meat suit be damned.
Soon there was the sound of a printer running. Charlie got up to it and collected all of the pages she printed. Turning to the two men, she held the pages out. "Here's his last place of residency. It was the same place I found his last phone call took place. Here is his car and registration information. I already have an APB out on him and sent a message to his parole officer."
Cas turned his head to the right, noting Amara sitting off to the side instead of in front of him. She was leaning against the arm of the seat, staring directly into his face. He awkwardly shifted his eyes away from her, noticing that he had a direct line of sight to his parents, something he had not had since her testimony had finished. Turning back to Amara, he noted a smile appear on his face, seeming to realize what he had noticed. He gave her squinted look with his head tilted in confusion, which only resulted in her giving him an even wider grin.
Emma was seen looking between the two as their conversation progressed.
"Really?" Sam asked, looking at Amara for confirmation.
Dorothy sat down at one of the countertops and put her briefcase on the counter. "Right now, I have a bunch of paperwork to sign. In summary, they are an agreement that you are taking legal custody of the children and that you will take care of them by the law." Opening up the briefcase, she handed over a stack of papers for Amara to look over and sign.
Lucifer opened and closed his mouth, trying to figure out what was happening when the smoke disappeared.
"Detective Winchester," Captain Mills spoke up. "I'm Captain Jody Mills. I was hoping that we could talk."
He got up slowly, sore in all the right places. He grabbed his duffel, pulling out an old, faded rock tee and dark washed jeans and put them on. He then pulled a small, plain wooden box out of his duffel. Opening it, there were already several feathers in different shades of black and indigo. He added the completely black feather that he just found to his small collection. He packed it back into his duffel before leaving the room.
"And could you explain the real reason?"
"When they came to... talk with me."
"Scared of you?" Amara asked with concern.
Sam jumped out of his chair and ran over to Amara, hugging her legs tightly. "Thank you," he told her.
Soon all eyes moved toward Amara as she looked on with a confused face. Racking her brain for an answer, "When was this?"
As she started to pass out the food, she stated "You really shouldn't do drugs. You never know what could happen to you. At least that's what all of the videos say. I'll be right back with refills. Enjoy."
"Told you to be careful," Dean gently said, almost exhausted. "She's been trying to put everything she can in her mouth. Everything."
Maybe we should figure out all that we've missed."
"That was fast," Dean mentioned.
Looking at the tombstone, she saw bursts of fire behind her eyelids. There is suddenly the memory of walking into her youngest son's nursery and being met with startling yellow eyes that she would never forget.
"You mean you were trying to get Gabe to do something reasonable. You should have known that it was a pointless endeavor."
Lucifer looked back at the two. Bobby was giving Amara an unimpressed look while she was rubbing at the carpet with her shoe. Scratching at the unmistakable imprint of a wolf pawprint in the carpet.
"Everything's fine. I was just thinking about somethings."
Dean felt like he was being dismissed for the second time that morning. He didn't feel insulted, though. Through his strong senses, he sniffed a slight smell of fear. It was nothing blatant. The omega wasn't knowingly giving off the scent, but it was definitely there. Dean didn't like it, but he knew it was time to leave to keep the omega from getting more uncomfortable. Dean looked in Sam's direction with the pup's head still stuck in his book and left the classroom. As he walked down the hallway, Dean stuffed the guilt of leaving the omega in distress, and he needed to get to work. He doubted that the chief would be willing to overlook the new guy getting to work late even if he had to drop his kid off at school.
Cas backed out of his seat and stood to leave the room. Dean reached to grab his arm, but Cas flinched against the movement. Realizing what he had done, he utterly broke and ran upstairs. They heard a door upstairs slam close. Dean stood up to go after his mate when he had was felt on his shoulder. He looked down and saw Amara's hand moving off his shoulder as she stood up as well.
"Sure," Pam said, grabbing one of the pills. A suspicious look filled her face before pressing a fingernail in the middle, where a blue liquid filled her hand.
"I'll keep this one quiet, I promise," Kali agreed.
"Why did you send her away?" John practically yelled at Sam.
He picked his burger again and saw the thing looking at him. He looked away as if he could feel his thoughts being sucked out his head. As if they took his lead, everyone at the table went back to eating. The two of them continued to pick food off of each other's plates. Emily would return every so often to refill drinks, but almost as if she could feel the tension, she didn't stay long.
"I would assume four months."
"Say they stopped wearing whatever blockers they're wearing. They're not going to smell like either of you. If they're around, I'm not going to know."
Dean went silent for a minute, thinking it over. He knew Sam was right, unfortunately. "Fine. Doesn't mean I have to like it."
The smirk instantly fell off of his face, and Benny was able to maneuver him faster into an empty interrogation room. Just as the door closed, the one to the break room opened. Dean hopped off of his desk, grabbing a voice recorder that he kept on his desk.
Sam gave a massive smile before squirming to be set down. "I have to get my books."
"What was that?" he heard Sam ask.
Emily kept on walking. The pace that she continued had not changed. As she now passed, Cas had sat up. The cloud seemed to try to get as far away from her as possible. Then, instead of the shapeless cloud, it turned into the silhouette of a person. You couldn't see any features, but it was clearly a person. Emily, standing right in front of the cloud, raised her arm and stabbed directly where the heart should have been. Flashing encompassed the entire thing and looked as it slowly disappeared into what seemed to be dust.
John went into the bathroom, slowly, giving the illusion that he was tired. His mind started racing once again. He had a plan that he was ready to put into action.
Dean gave her a huff and an unimpressed look.
Benny then moved to holster his weapon. "Are the kids okay?"
"I was wondering when you would wake up," Amara said with a slight smirk. As she said this, she flicked the light switch beside her, filling the entire room with light.
"When we went to visit our son, Castiel. I'm sure you noticed him in the courtroom. We went to talk to him and his mate and found someone watching us from the outside. Had no clue who it was at the time, but it was most definitely her."
"What unit?"
The two continued their conversation, only pausing to move up in the line and taking their orders. It honestly took a while before Sam caught wind of their conversation.
"Wait!" he yelled. "I need to wash my hands," he said before scurrying out of the room.
"Yes, she will."
"There's no evidence of that."
Morris stood up, not waiting for everyone else to stand as well before he went back through the door he came in from. As soon as the door shut, the court was filled with muttering from the jury as they were lead out, questioning each other as to what had just happened. Bailiffs escorted the two Novaks out of the courtroom while Amara stood up and made her way to talk with Harvelle.
You hurt him, and I kill you.
"You should leave," Dean demanded.
She ran down to the third floor. She opened the door wide before making her way down the next steps in hopes that she couldn't be heard. At the next landing, she bent over to put Riley down for a bit. She slowly opened the door and motioned for Riley to move through. Once the other side of the door, Emily waited for the door upstairs to slam close before closing that one as well.
‘’I cared about you, I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack. But I cared about the whole world, Because of you.’'
He found himself tied up against a pole, there were ropes against his stomach, and his hands were cuffed with enochian cuffs, hands tied above his head. The cuffs were making his grace unusable, he could feel it stored away deep inside him, fighting to get free. His feet we're also tied to the pole, he couldn't move. Escaping was going to be really hard, especially if his captor was planning on hurting him.
He would try his best to protect them.
‘’What have you done?’’ the angel said, voice low and almost growling as he pushed Dean off of him.
‘’Of course they do. Wait- is that why you like being called Cas so much? Because your parents hate it?’’
‘’Wait- I don’t understand. If you didn’t want me to be in the Winchesters story.. then why did you keep resurrecting me?’’
Sam looked up from his laptop, he was sitting at the kitchentable and his eyebrow shot up as he seemed to connect the dots.
‘’No. But she thought all hunters are the same, I tried to talk with her and explain that wasn’t the truth, but she was not to be bargained with.’’
Castiel woke up he was staring directly in the faces of the Winchester hovering over him.
Castiel gasped and fell to the ground as Chuck pulled the blade out, muffled protest were heard of Jack and Sam. Dean rushed over and tried to stop the bleeding with his hands, panic and shock clear in his eyes.
It started out as whispers amongst the angels, Castiel was surprised to hear them.
‘’Why is it so important to you anyway-‘’
Chuck arrived in style, thunder was heard as he walked down the stairs of the bunker and lightbulb were flashing.
‘’Shit. That would make sense, she would know enough tricks’n shit to be able to get to Cas because she was prepared.’’
Not only psychically, but also mentally.
‘’He will not save you.’’
the empty?’’
And he didn't have to wait long, because they were already there.
''I guess this is my cue to leave.'' Sam stood up from his stool.
‘’We’re gonna have to clean up after ourself. What if we just burn the entire building after we’ve freed every monster?’’
He could feel his grace searching for a save space in his body. His celestial form was trashing,
Dean and Sam rushed over to Jack and Cas.
‘’He’ll get out of jail in a few months. Everyone knows and loves the story, and he’s way too much of a public figure to be in there for a long time, they’ll go easy on him.’’
And never allow himself to be fully happy, that couldn't be that hard? Right?
But the Winchesters are taking more time to choose than expected.
He blinked several times, he was disoriented, he had a slight headache and still wasn’t able to reach his grace because of the cuffs.
‘’You know how he felt about Jack. Imagine how hard it must’ve been to kill Belphegor.’’
I could chose to get you out of the Empty, but- you could never go back to the Empty.’’
Dean has said the same thing about Sam.
‘’Go get us some shots Luke.’’
Castiel knew what Dean meant, he wanted to talk in private. Not within the presence of the younger Winchester.
Cas’s face sunk at the name, and he became pale rather fast.
‘’Cas? What did she do?’’
‘’Is he-..?’’ Dean asked carefully.
Don't start feeling bad for her just yet...
The angel was still in chains, and seemed to just have regained consciousness.
Castiel wanted to shout, wanted to scream at Dean that he wasn't broken, and even if he was Dean didn't break him. He wanted to tell Dean none of it was true, but that would be a lie. Because Castiel knows, he had known for a long time know, that he indeed fell for Dean Winchester.
Like the empty had said.
‘’That- …all you got?’’ Castiel grunted.
‘’Dean, I want to tell you something but you have to promise you won’t get mad.’’
‘’Was about time both of you figure that out.’’ Sam sighed, he joined the rest of them who were now all sitting on Cas’s bed, it was a bit cramped with 3 of them being grown, and higher than your average guy, but they made it work by giving each other no personal space whatsoever.
‘’What? ...Leaving?’’
____________________
‘’There’s a good 24/7 diner just out of campus.’’
Dean had secretly always wondered what it would be like to be the last person on earth, he thought it would be easier not having to put up with everyone’s bullshit.
They had no Cas, no Charlie, no Bobby…
The tiny smile slowly faded from Cas’s face, and now it showed no emotion.
‘’Yeah, I’m fine.’’ Dean knew that was a lie, but they had managed to remove the bullet that had been stuck in Sam’s leg and the bleeding also stopped, Cas was in a way worse state right now and his brother would just have to wait, until the angel was stable. Well.. more stable than now.
But let’s just say they hadn’t made any progress on breaking into heaven and they were running out of time so he needed the distraction.
He showed Cas screens that were happy memories,
‘’You don’t have to describe anything, Gabriel told me about it.’’
‘’Because I’m dumb. But you’re smarter than me.’’
He was doing this.
He didn’t see Dean as his brother, he would die for him. (he already had several times) He would give Dean everything he had to give and more. He became dangerously drunk on his feelings sometimes, he loved the human. In his long live Castiel had never thought he would be able to really love someone… but here he was pulling his heart out for a men.
‘’I could eat.’’ Sam answered.
He brought it down on Castiel's stomach and Castiel's entire world changed.
He smiled as the black goo swallowed him up slowly.
Cas looked at the spot on the wall again and got lost in memories for a quick second.
‘’Nice to see you again too.’’ Dean muttered while walking past the now frozen in place, and open mouthed Cas.
He doubted he was going to find answers here.
Did Castiel really want to go back? No, he hated that building, and he didn’t wanna see Louise (even in her Dead form) ever again, he wasn’t afraid of her… He just didn’t like the memories that would come up with seeing her body again.
‘’It’s fine. I’ve learned how to find my own way, I just wish I didn’t have to do it alone.
Well, like all things do- this story had come to an end.
He’d heard about her through angel radio.
Sam handed Dean the blade and Dean sliced through the cuffs off in one swift motion.
''It's fine Dean.. It's just a kind off an intimate gesture... it's a bit overwhelming to say the least.''
''Look I'm happy you guys finally stopped being blind idiots in denial, but you're going to have to clean those sheets yourself.''
‘’I don’t know man… I think we should get a room here and just continue this as a normal hunt. Ask the locals if there are more disappearances around here.’’
‘’Castiel. Good to hear you’re alive.’’
Chuck turned his back to Castiel. His shoulders grew tense and Castiel could see he needed a moment to calm down before he continued.
‘’Not important for now. What is important for now…’’
Chuck snapped his fingers and Castiel was restrained on it.
Because all this time.. Dean never thought.. That Cas wanted him that way.
Jack slapped the hand Sam was trying to put on his shoulder away.
‘’That angel will see you die, watch your brother die, and watch his
The first thing Castiel noticed was how extremely cold it was, normally his vessel would be the same temperature in any weather, he was never too cold or too hot.
It was really getting cold now, he sighed and a little cloud formed from his lips.
I know I made the right choice but my parents won’t allow any contact at all with my younger siblings.’’
A long(er) chapter!
If Dean was also frozen, he would be death within an hour
‘’You wanna do family talk…? Already? I think we might need more alcohol for that first.’’ Dean laughed.
''You want coffee?''
‘’Fine, yes, we listened to it together, and I enjoy it more now. Now please leave.’’
After that he took the purgatory flower, ( that had been a bitch to get without his guardian angel, and also didn’t help that the place brought back
Cas flipped him off while Luke dance triumphantly and closed the door behind him.
‘’What did Sam want?’’
‘’Well that would be a shame, because that way you won’t get to hear the rest of my best lines.’’
‘’See you soon Dean.’’
''Fine, but I'm not done with you yet, young man.'' Dean pointed his finger at Jack.
‘’Okay.’’
‘’I guess so.’’ Dean said at the same time Cas said: ‘’yes.’’
''Okay, well.. Let's try it. What could go wrong?''
‘’Sorry, those are necessary, can’t have you waking up and trying to escape.’’
The angel couldn’t keep fighting him for no reason forever.
Uriel punched Castiel in the face again.
The pain didn’t lessen over time, it actually got a lot worse.
Or the scourging.
Dean gave a sad smile, a wave of nostalgic about the good days with Cas hitting him.
Dean had to do his best to act like it didn’t bother him.
‘’Nope, but I don’t blame her,
Dean really hated thinking about that entire experience, he remembered thinking he had lost Cas for good.
‘’I mean it too. Thank you for listening. And I forgive you for being angry.’’
It wasn’t actually as bad as Cas thought it was, he had just found the song a bit too corny, a bit too slow for something like a party.
‘’And you still thought it was a good idea to
Dean looked at Cas again, and Cas saw something shift in his face.
‘’You seem tired, why don’t you try and get some sleep while we sew you up huh? Might make it easier for us. And what do we do about your uhm…’’ Dean glazed over at the giant black wings, they were damaged and causing Cas a lot of pain. And Dean couldn’t stand to see Cas in pain. Hell, he’d seen more than enough of that for a lifetime. Especially after today.
''Is this really okay Cas?''
‘’Thanks Cas, you don’t know how much that means to hear from you.’’
‘’Dean.. praying to him was smart. I’ll give you that.’’
‘’Cas! Are you okay?’’
The angel didn’t reply.
‘’The bunker is an old building Dean, sometimes doors just open because they weren’t locked properly.’’
It was a nice sight to see and he just stood there and stared at the angel for a while before walking over to him.
‘’But I decline.’’
‘’You sure you don’t want anything else?’’
Maybe he should just close his eyes again, and let Meg notify his teacher that he was sick tomorrow,
I posted 8 after 6 and totally forgot 7, I figured it out (a little late) and posted 7 anyways, sorry if I confused anyone!
He took a gulp from his coffee and said;
He needed to focus on his family.
The rest of his body wasn't much better, there were burnmarks all over his stomach allong with a sea of cuts and bruises.
When the empty had swallowed both Cas and Billie fully it disappeared just as quickly as it had come.
‘’I need to tell you something.’’
That made Cas started to laugh louder.
''Please.. just, do it fast.'' Cas almost pleaded.
Castiel was actually quit surprised about how well his wings look, sure there were some scars and bare skin was showing on the places we’re there were no feathers. But after the fall he thought his wings would never heal, he thought he would never be able to fly again, but if he got out of here and his wings continued to heal, he may feel the wind gliding through them once again.
''I'm gonna go out for some dinner, Sam and Jack will clean you up. You're gonna be okay?''
Seems like Dean still has it.. This was going to be interesting to say the least.
‘’We’ll figure out the wings later, we’re gonna stitch the wound now if that’s okay?’’
After a long cuddle session, Dean and Cas got dressed and ready to leave the room.
Of course.
Until they were interrupted by the sound off an alarm, and not many seconds later Sam who was running out off the building to the impala.
‘’And… after that?’’ Dean tried.
‘’Don’t try anything.’’ She slipped a pair of Enochian handcuffs on him again and the few seconds Castiel could feel his grace flow freely in his body were over.
He didn’t know if he could stomach them now though.
‘’Are you sure you’re okay?’’
‘’Yes, get Cas the hell out of here.’’ He said, Dean pushed the door open and the both of them gasped.
‘’Still a crappy gesture, she now doesn’t have the jewels or him.’’
‘’Hey Sam.’’
‘’What?’’ Cas asked, confused and concerned as he turned towards Dean.
once while showering.’’
Castiel slowly opened his eyes, there were other people in the room, staring right at him.
Dean went to lean back against the bedpost and took Castiel’s hand again.
‘’You know what god is doing to you at this very moment?’’
‘’Hey, hey it’s okay. It’s okay Dean, We’ll get him back.’’
''We'll find him. He can't hide forever, but let's work on an more waterproof plan in the meantime.''
He kept zoning in and out on the letters, his eyes not deciding if they wanted to read the next line or simply stop working.
‘’You’re as red as a tomato! You so danced to this together!’’
‘’I’m going to get some toys, but Cas you stay silent as a mouse okay? Wouldn’t want you spending too much time with your toxic boyfriend!’’ She muttered an Enochian spell and Castiel gasped, he suddenly was unable to talk, he could still move. He should be thankful for that at least.
‘’Mhppff..’’
They had fought heavy, seemingly unwin-able battles. But this one.. it couldn’t be won.
‘’Nice try Cassie, but I finally have you exactly where I want you. So you’re not going to slip through my fingers that easily.’'
He could make out 3 blurred faces, but had to squint really hard to do so.
Chuck snapped his finger and with a last shout Zachariah’s soul was doomed.
‘’They.. really do look terrible.’’
Gathered himself and closed his eyes.
‘’Hey Sam?’’
‘’I know it hurts. But he’s gone, he doesn’t hold power over you anymore. Then again.. I guess he never really did huh..?’’
‘’What?’’
All in all, Castiel would give a lot to fly again.
‘’You couldn’t possibly know she knew so much about Angels, don’t blame this on yourself.’’
Like.. Something save from his past.
''Cas!'' Dean screamed running over to the figure hanging from the ceiling.
Maybe Castiel didn't want to die, but he still felt like he made the right choice. He doesn't regret it because Jack is here, with them. Alive.
Castiel felt alone again.
if Castiel could focus his grace on one angel he could try and establish a connection.
______________________________
''We're not done yet, we still have to stitch them. But we can take a break, let's clean you up a bit before we move on. How's the pain?''
‘’…Where are you going with this?’’
Castiel send his brother a last wave of gratitude and then let the connection fade, luckily the other angels voices faded along with it, he had a feeling Joshua might’ve had something to do with that.
It was a statement, a fact.
Don't worry, I'll give you guys enough time to hate on her, but she needed a back story first ;)
''Yes. We don't know where he is though.''
‘’Must be nice to have someone like that in your life.’’
''Don't talk about my family like that. And if anybody is a machine here, it's you.''
‘’I’m a handsome guy Dean, even I can’t say no to these eyes.’’ Gabriel winked.
He had just seen it was so obviously not.
''I can't Sammy... We just got him back. And it- it's complicated between me and Cas right now, I don't think you'll understand.''
He needed it.
He felt his power being locked down once again as she took the blindfolds off.
The only time they came out of the bunker was to buy weapons and stuff to prepare for god, or groceries, and they didn’t do it often because being confronted with the fact that there’s no one else on the world is very confronting.
‘’I can’t believe I’m going to call in sick tomorrow for
''Yeah. I'm good... Dean isn't here let's just..''
___________
But he would at least like to know how it there.. right?
‘’Are you okay?’’
‘’I’m afraid I might kill myself.’’
_________________________
‘’Focus on your heartbeat.’’
then they opened again.
Both Jack and Sam fell to the ground as well, Chucks hold on them gone.
He waved his hand and Sam and Dean were send flying to the wall, once again held against it by an invisible force. Castiel fell to the ground.
‘’Not in this town. But we can move on to the next. His car has been through here for sure.’
Because let's be honest. This show means so much to me, and people will say ''You can rewatch it.. right?''
Dean couldn’t do it like this.
’’ Cas repeated in a voice meant to mock Dean’s.
She nodded quickly and walked away.
it was here and it was going to take Cas.
‘’Oh, brother. You have no idea.’’
(See the end of the chapter for
A tear streamed down Cas’s face.
‘’I hear you. And I accept all of you.’’
Now it was the bunker. And yes, the impala still held that feeling of home, of nostalgic, but is was different from the bunker in some ways. The bunker gave them savety, family and a roof. Were as the impala meant adventure, travelling and uncertainty.
‘’Not real.’’
‘’What can I get for you sweetie?’’
He himself was a bit suprised at how bad he looked, there was a big deep cut, still bleeding in his stomach, and some smaller cuts and bruises that shouldn't be there anymore.
''Of what?''
He'd waited so long for this, fantasized about this moment so many times, but nothing could actually compare to the feeling of Cas's extremely soft lips against his.
‘’What is wrong Castiel, don’t you like it?’’
someone like you in his life to look up too he migh'tve grown up to be very different.''
Time to bring in the heavy guns.
good, and Meg thinks so too, so you should go talk to him or she’ll probably make you anyways. ’’
But Cas shouldn’t have done that, and he should’ve told Dean.
‘’You didn’t want me to go back, and I wasn’t scared.. I just dislike the memories I made in that building.’’
‘’why would we do that?’’
Then he crouched down next to Cas.
Trying to focus on one angel when thousand of celestial beings were screaming in your head, it was like finding a needle in a haystack.
‘’Why is that good?’’
‘’Okay, but can’t we like.. wrap them up or something? They’re.. uhm..’’
Cas hadn’t even know Chuck was getting stronger because of him.
Thanks for reading and leaving kudos. And this won't be the last Destiel fic I'm going to write, so if you liked this one be sure to check every now and then for future works :)
Dean whistled. ‘’Damn that’s a pretty big family, I can see how that must get on your nerves.’’
He hugged his brother close to him and held him as he gasped.
''We'll see about that.'' Castiel growled back.
He nodded over to Dean, communicating he’d understand what he’d had to do.
‘’So.. what was your plan here Castiel?’’ Zachariah’s eyes glimmered full of incoming danger, how they managed to do that in a brightly lighted white room, Castiel could not answer.
He got
''I know Cas.''
(See the end of the chapter for
It didn't taste like anything, but if Castiel took apart the molucules it could be described as a salty taste, kind off bitter.
‘’So get this..’’ Sam began after they had finished eating and both Cas and Dean were cleaned up and wearing normal clothes.
''Morning.''
Michael turned towards Castiel.
‘’Yeah?’’
‘’What? You’re trying to make amends before faking your own death again?’’
When he slowly dared to open his eyes he realised the source of the warmth, he was laying in a ring of holy fire.
‘’You drink this straight?’’
Yeah, that would be one hell of an akward conversation which he was not looking forward to.
‘’Normally I don’t give spoilers, but you’re special Cassie.. I’ve been testing on other angels for a long time, all leading up to this moment. Leading up to owning you. And soon enough, owning Dean Winchester.’’
“Then I accept your apology.”
. He comes back to reality and realizes Cas is looking for an answer. Oh, he wants to know if Dean is out at work.
Cas covers Dean's hands with his own. He kisses Dean’s knuckles. "Just the pin is fine. Although," Cas says as he reaches into the bag, "I do think you would look ravishing in this." He snaps the headband onto Dean's forehead. Dean winces comically.
♫ ♫ ♫
“Charlie tells me you’re single.”
Satisfied, Cas turns back to the others and starts interrupting Gabe’s storytelling with everyone else for the rest of the dinner. Like he hadn’t almost caused Dean to die an undignified chocolate-related death.
Which is,
Dean realizes he’s been quiet, thinking things over once again. Cas -wonderful, wonderful Cas - lets him. Dean’s never been quite so good at expressing himself, and Castiel knows that. After Cas’ confession, Dean finally saw that the angel understands him (better than he understands himself, most likely). He feels a wave of affection flow through him at that. Dean lets the feeling push the words out of him.
“Cas helped.”
“I mean, I hope it will, I just...I meant - ” Dean sighs, pausing to reorganize his thoughts. “I never wanna miss an opportunity to kiss you, Cas.”
Then Dean is standing next to him. Castiel looks over to see Dean looking out over the horizon. He admires Dean’s profile, appreciates how the blue light of just-after-sunset softens his features, how it makes his eyes look bluer than usual. He’s back in his usual jeans, with a dark blue hoodie on top.
Dean finds he’s immensely enjoying hearing these noises. He thinks hearing Cas speak would be even better. So, he slows the roll of his hips and locks eyes with Cas to ask him again.
“…if I become human, you’re the first person I’d want to have massage my empty shoulders.”
“We’re going swimming,” Castiel says enthusiastically, letting go of one of Dean’s hands to sign as much to Eileen when he sees her look up at them.
The phone rings once, twice, three times before he hears a very groggy-sounding voice on the other end of the line say, “Why are you calling me at this ungodly hour?”
now.’’ Chuck chuckled
And Dean had done nothing.
Kissing Dean was overwhelming but in the best way possible, it felt like thousands sensations Castiel hadn’t felt before so severe but had somehow experienced before
‘’Yes and no, I wanted to see you now, not tomorrow.’’
‘’She deep froze herself some vampires? What the hell are they wearing?
‘’What?’’
He placed his hand on top of Dean’s and slowly moved it from his head to Dean's chest, keeping it in place with his own hand.
‘’Cas?’’
(See the end of the chapter for
_______________________
‘’What did he do?’’
‘’I do not like nightmares.’’
Dean brought his hand up to Castiel’s face and slightly brushed his chin with his fingertips. ‘’I like you Castiel.’’
Dean had been worried.
Gabriels eyes lit up blue for a second.
A hand shot out and god was pinned against the wall.
They walked straight to Dean's bedroom as Jack helped Sam get some stuff to clean Cas up a bit.
‘’Yes, of course. I promise.’’
''Okay, see ya later.'' Dean tussled Castiel's hair and planted a quick kiss on his cheek before leaving the room.
Jack came bursting into the door, Sam fresh on his tail.
I'm so thankful for the good memories it gave me.
''Heaven troubles? You don't think it's saver you to stay here? Cas you're hurting.''
I won’t hesitate to take every word I just said back.’’
Cas is everything good in this doomed world which you messed up. He tries so hard and never gives up. And the fact that you made him.. That is so fucking wrong! And it means the end for you.’’
‘’Can you even start a sentence without ‘’So get this?’’ We’re not listening any better if that’s what you think it does.’’
Gabriel smiled, and turned back around, to look at his patient.
‘’Hunters accidentally mistook Jim for a vampire when they were hunting a nest. He wasn’t actually her husband but I guess she loved him, she never got the change to admit her love and became obsessed with revenge.’’
''We all assume he's as old as he looks, but in reality. The boy is two damn years old.''
“I do. look at me.’’
‘’So a bullet to her brain is enough?’’
''Jack, help Sam with the electrics.''
And don't be afraid to ask questions! I will answer but won't spoil the plot because I too have no idea where this is going next.
this year to go smoke a joint with someone I’ve known for
‘’Yes.’’
‘’Yeah- Thanks… ‘’ Dean turned around and dammit. That’s where he knew that voice from.
''Your deal with the empty. You did me quiet a favor actually, he's even more silent now. He doesn't want to fight and come back, because when he does. He has the change of loosing his precious but pathetic excuse for an angel again.''
‘’That’s going to take us forever! What if he needs us now?!’’
How were they gonna find their friend? Maybe there was something in the lore.
''Yes, Jack is back. And I'm glad, really I am. But I haven't slept for at least 3 days, so I hope you guys won't mind if I-...''
‘’Always listen to your big brother, Sammy!’’ Dean shouted as he went to pack his bag.
but because he became close with Meg and Luke fast - he learned that he could decorate his part of the room with whatever he wanted, so he did.
''Nothing, he's lying.''
‘’So you guys…?’’ Sam began.
‘’Dean.. You don’t h-have to..’’
Dean frowned, ‘’I thought you said you already went to bed, and I woke you up?’’
‘’You’re lying.’’
‘’Alright then.’’ Dean threw the match inside and closed the door.
''Dean, before we go in. You know Michael will do everything in his power to get you to say yes.''
‘’Tell that to your red eyes and coughing fits three hours ago.’’
Sam nodded.
''I'm gonna take that as a yes.''
''I- I don't know if I-..'' Cas stuttered.
Sam had walked through the rest of the room.
He went to get some gas for the impala and had picked up burgers on his way back.
But Michael kicked his ass and than dragged the angel to his office, waiting for the rest to arrive.
Castiel shook that thought out of his head and focused on Dean again.
‘’Shut up, I’m a joy to be around.’’
Maybe he would make the choise to become human and live his life out with Dean so the Empty couldn't take him.
Again a piece of white light was ripped from Chuck’s chest.
‘’You really think that they won’t be ready? They will kill you. So if I were you, I’d make the smart choice. Let me go, find another path and don’t come near me and the Winchesters ever again.’’
The blue light danced around Gabriel, who smiled.
Castiel was out of breath and didn't want to fight it, he had to gain some energy again first.
‘’Good.’’
‘’Just a coffee please.’’
Castiel grunted.
And Dean was pretty sure this was what heaven felt like.. quite literally.
‘’And he.. ‘’
''Good.. So Dean and you, you're uhm.. official now?''
Now it was showtime.
‘’I- I…’’
His eyes became bigger and Dean could swear one corner of his mouth formed into the tiniest smile.
‘’I don’t know. I’ve only seen the hallway that I was in.’’
She began to speak Enochian, before the second word of the spell had been spoken Castiel could already feel them start to move.
And of course that was the moment Sam had chosen to enter the hotel room and prevent Dean from reacting to that sentence and helping his best friend(ish).
Cas was to stay in the car, Dean was scared he would give the old couple a heart attack with his wings out. It was late anyways and he wouldn’t be noticed in the dark and in the safety of the impala. The few teenagers stumbling around the streets were too drunk to give the car a second look anyways.
‘’You know I’m not afraid.’’
Thank you for leaving kudos and comments, I always appreciate them a lot :)
He sighed, he was not getting anywhere like this.
''Not now, we'll talk about this later. In real life.''
A few weeks past, life went on.
‘’Cas!’’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘’Honestly, I’m surprised he still has them. Thought he lost them after the fall. They had even looked pretty okay before Louise.. ‘’ Yeah, Dean wasn’t gonna finish that sentence, he didn’t like where it was going and he didn’t want to think about that image ever again.
‘’Let’s bring him up, I’m sure dad wants us to enjoy the show, seeming as we brought him his favourite renegade angel.’’
Short chapter, but I guess Benny didn't jinx them.
Kali and Gabe watched the easy comradery between the two as they got to work in the kitchen. As soon as the coffee was made, Dean made the twosome cups he and Amara continued cutting up fruit. When the kettle whistled, Amara grabbed a teabag from the box she handed to Dean earlier and poured the steaming water into the set-aside mug.
"Hey. This is Captain Mills; she would like to talk to you about yesterday."
Dean was quite beautiful when he was sleeping... not that he was not beautiful when he was no sleeping. It was just that the worries of the world seemed to slip away once Dean went into a sleep that was not filled with nightmares.
"Mr. Novak?" a child's voice spoke while Cas felt a tug on his shirt.
"Okay," the girls sniffled. "I would like to sleep again." She moved out of Dean's arms and settled herself back into the bed. She quickly closed her eyes. "You can turn the light of now," she demanded.
"I'm trying to convince Celine to read the books," Emily said. "Things would be easier if she got the references."
"Yes, we can go eat. Let's just check these books out."
"Yes, most of the time I wouldn't think anything of it, but with the other flowers... Violets represent faithfulness and watchfulness. In these contexts... I think this spell is more about separating the child from their lives and being to transition them into another. Since this seems to be more so about changing their mindset, there is also  failsafe it the summoning doesn't work: a tracking element."
"What do they look like?" Dean interrupted.
Mary considered things. Turning to Cas, she asked, "Can we see your actual wings?"
Castiel turned around, saw a very young man, a boy really, in a typical uniform. "I'm fine, thanks," he quickly sputtered out.
John made a face toward the two of them as Mary and Sam decided how they were going to split up.
"Yes, Cassie, I know he's a detective. Not much news there."
Mary took everyone's plates and utensils and dumped them. She quickly returned and sat in the seat. As soon as she did, a yawn left here. "Sorry," she told the group.
"Is everyone else awake?" he asked.
"Well, since we're at the end of the school year, you can stay in my class. It would be more trouble to move you, especially since you're going to have a new teacher next year anyway."
Castiel didn't answer her for a while, deep in thought considering what she said. "It's possible," he eventually said.
John turned around to give Sam a piece of his mind. Dean was quick to get in between the two of them.
Michael turned his head to look at his youngest brother and gave him a soft smile. "Hey, Cassie."
"That bad?"
Dean internally swore. They were supposed to stay out of sight until the signal was given. "You had hostages. It's normal procedure," he tried to reason. "As long as you do nothing, neither will they."
John tried to keep his eye on the two clowns well into the drive. Mary had already fallen asleep, satisfied with the conversation she had between the two men. Unfortunately, he as well couldn't keep his eyes open much longer.
"Right, coffee," Sam said, finally waking up. "Give me a second."
"Emma Grace," Cas replied just as softly.
"What do you have for us, boss?" Benny asked, getting there first.
"Oh, I understand," Zachariah said with a swarmy voice. "This really is a conversation that should be between alphas—no need to let the little omega get uppity. I'm sure you know how they are when they get like that.
"My bracelet," she said. "It's made out of silver."
Lucifer made his way upstairs and laid Steve down on Sam's bed, and nodded Christie good night. He looked into the master bedroom and noticed the huddle of three wolves. He made his way back downstairs, took off his jacket and shoes, and made himself comfortable on the couch.
"I don't want anyone you choose for me. I've decided that on my own."
"The only thing constant is change," she muttered.
"Yes, I'm not quite sure this is the only one. There's too much capable of change here."
"What was go good about it?"
"Thank you," the officer said. "I'll secure these two idiots for transport. Feel free to go back with your class. Once we have more information, we'll be sure to talk to everyone involved."
Not long after the two left the morgue, they went to the library. They were hoping that they could find some books on supernatural creatures other than witches. If they didn't have to deal with witches, the two would be happy. It ended up being a bust. The two were getting ready to give up when Dean's stomach growled. Sam give him a disgusted look.
"You know," Dean started, "I didn't tell you you could break into my house."
"Most people introduce themselves first before expecting an introduction in return."
John kept to the side of the door. No reason to be attacked on-site for supposedly being dead yet showing up at someone's door. The door quickly opened and a gruff yet familiar voice asked: "who are you?"
They had gotten to the front counter. Sam was there trying to scan all of his books at the self-checkout counter.
"I guess it could look like you if you looked about ten years older, had white in your beard, and a scar on your forehead, but you have none of those things. Good thing you have cash because there is no way someone would accept your ID, and your credit cards are probably expired, and I'm hungry. Let's go see if the diner is still here."
Dean walked closer to them as he got prepared to until them. Unfortunately, the bastard was decent at tieing knots. He would have to use a knife to get them separated. He got ready to take his switchblade out. "I'm going to have to cut you guys out, but I won't hurt you. I promise." He quickly sliced through the rope, and the two were soon separated. They turned around and started to hug each other.
"You don't have to accept," Dean muttered in Cas's ear.
The entire courtroom became silent again as Judge Morris once again walked into the courtroom. He looked weary as if the whole week had also gotten to him. As he got comfortable in his seat, he gave a deep sigh before continued.
"Just imagine when Sam's older?"
Dean grabbed Sam by the arm and dragged him into their room before changing into their monkey suits while John and Mary headed out to find a thrift store that was bound to be nearby.
"There should be, but we have to go to the front office for that."
The coffee maker dinged. "Do you want coffee?"
"It might be useful to keep it on hand," Sam informed her.
"Colorado," Dean answered.
"John said something about how he died for you, Dean. Later on, he said he learned something from that experience. What's your take on that?"
The man stopped slumping over and gave her a familiar smirk. An eerily similar chuckle broke through.
"Donald Dunham, you are under arrest for three counts of homicide and two counts of kidnapping. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and him them present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning if you wish. You can decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer or make any statement. Do you understand each of these rights as I have explained them to you?"
"Call me Dean, then. How did you explain it to the kids?"
"You look as beautiful as the day we met."
"I've done all the tests I could do, and all of them make no sense to me. I don't know how much more help I can be."
"What proof could you possibly have?"
"What's there?"
"She does not understand why she cannot touch my wings."
"I did."
"What was that?" John snapped.
"Couldn't sleep."
"Amara..." Cas started, kind of scared of the outburst the older omega had.
"Sam, I have to go," Dean explained to him. "Can you be good for Cas?"
"Not really," Sam replied. "Just empty building, but we don't have a good feeling about whatever this is."
Cas nodded at the older omega and took deep breaths, trying to calm down. It was a couple of minutes before the two medical professionals went back to the two omegas.
"You shouldn't be too confident," Bobby told her. "That will just get you into trouble."
"When we were younger, before you came around," Lucifer started to explain, "Naomi and Zachariah used to joke that Gabe would be the perfect omega. He was so quiet and seemed to listen to what everyone said. Now that I think about it, they thought about 'adopting' another child when Gabe's personality started coming in full force."
Lucifer turned to his brother now and faced him head-on. "I was expecting you back last night. I wasn't expecting to have to come and find you this morning."
A couple of months later, things around the salvage yard had come to a comforting routine. Cases can few and far between. Everything seemed to have calmed down in the world. Mary was going through the living room, cleaning up some of the books that ended up being thrown around the room. She was putting the last book on top of the stack when she noticed something in the corner of her eye.
"I had a nightmare," Cas answered honestly.
The two ignored her. "Nope, well, that wasn't what woke me up. Your brother decided to visit."
"Yes, I am. It's too late for me."
"If someone is using the paw print the exact same way as in the story, we have to assume that they also know the story," Lucifer stated.
Dean walked back into the bedroom to lead the kids out as they ran to attach themselves to his legs. It was slightly awkward the move, but he made it work, knowing he wouldn't get the kids to let go of him. They quickly left the room, slowly made their way down the stairs and out of the apartment complex.
"I can tell y'all about the new recipe I've been working on," Gabe started.
Dean was interrupted from his musings by a soft sound of someone clearing their throat. He turned to his right and saw a petite woman standing next to him with a smirk and her arms crossed at her chest.
"This would have been reported," Lucifer mentioned. "They would have already been in our database."
"Oh, don't mind me. I was just going to let you guys know that breakfast was ready, but if the two of you are too busy..."
"What's going on?"
"Then that's the one we'll watch. You have your snacks?"
"Where's Cassie?" Sam asked.
"Does he know you're here?"
Behind him, Dean could hear Cas scurry away and moved to push the two of them farther out of the door before walking through and closing the door behind him.
"Weird food choice," John stated toward Castiel.
"Right, sorry," Amara said, looking around and giving everyone a meek smile. "I'm just so excited. You and Dean are going to make such cute children. Your genetics working together..."
Dean had lovingly explained that "people were not meant to leave the ground. It's not natural."
Jody just nodded. "Yeah, weirder stuff's happened. Especially when those three are involved." The last part was said with a mock look of disappointment crossing her face.
"That whoever is the owner is a complete nerd," Dean commented. Castiel and Celine continued their progress. "It's just a bunch of information about herbs and whatnot. Many that don't exist anymore, so that's not any help."
"Oh no," Dean muttered.
"Unless word got out that something weird was going on around here."
Dean gave him another slow kiss in which Cas enthusiastically joined before they were cut off by a slight cough. The two men turned their heads and saw Amara standing in the entry.
"Mare...?" John asked.
"Never seen something like this before," Bobby continued. "A black-eyed demon that powerful at least."
"Yes, ma'am."
Naomi was quick to turn on her heel as she headed toward the elevator before calling for it. Once all three were inside, she selected the button for the basement before pressing numbers into a keypad. As she pressed enter, the elevator descended along with Castiel's stomach. Nothing good ever happened down here.
None of the men questioned her further. The Impala filled with a tense but comfortable silence as they continued along the darkened highway.
Sam quickly grabbed a jacket and left the motel room, leaving the partners alone for a while.
"Cassie was almost kidnapped, but Dean saved him," Lucifer told her. She had a glint in her eye that told him a lot more. "But you already knew that, didn't you."
"What? I didn't lie to you, I swear," Dean pleaded.
"I found a bee mobile for the crib," Michael said, pulling a box from behind where he was sitting on the floor.
"Oh, okay."
Instead of answering him, Dean once again dialed a number, but this time didn't put it on speaker. "Hey, Cas."
"No problem. Just happy I could help."
Sitting at the desk was a woman who seemed to be focused on something on the computer. Walking in, Lucifer cleared his throat to get her attention.
Bobby swung the door open more and gestured for the two to enter the house. Mary entered first, wiping her face of the salt before it started to stick, with John following behind her doing the same. The front hall leed to the library that looked exactly as it did years ago except for a few piles of books placed randomly around the room with varying degrees of topics.
"Well, I was wondering when you people would show up." The woman turned around as she said this. She was an average looking woman with a calculating look as she looked them over. "I wasn't expecting this many of you though."
"I can't just leave."
"Even with the baby feeding on your grace?" Dean then asked him. At that, Castiel looked perplexed, as if he hadn't considered it before.
"You know," Dean mentioned to Sam as he squatted next to his brother, "Eating slowly isn't going to prevent you from going to school."
"Could just be me, but they look like the stereotypical junkie. Really dirty hair, dirt under the fingernails, and their faces are completely cracked."
"How long were you in him?"
"Are you talking about that thing Celine gave you?" Dean asked. "The child protection thing?"
"It was for Dean, Mary... for Dean."
"Certainly looks like a he. When did you decide to become a fucking fag?"
"Cas," Dean called. "What's going on?"
"Anywho, we've taken time off of work until this case is over. Not like we'll be able to really think about anything else. Do you think this trial will really be as long as they've been speculating? There's so much evidence they've been saying. Have anyone said anything to you? Since you were on the case and everything. You must know something."
"You go on ahead too, Dean," Amara said. "Don't worry about breakfast. Lucifer is handling it."
"What are you doing here?" he asked.
Cas didn't have a moment to answer when Dean started stirring. He turned his head some before lowering it again and settling further into Castiel's lap, taking a deep breath as he sank further into sleep.
He finally reached his place of business, the Lawrence Police Department, and walked in. He was told by the chief the homicide detectives here didn't need to dress up, just be presentable when going into public. That, and no one should be wearing their best shoes if a suspect decided to run for it. That sounded like Dean's dress code already: boots, jeans, a T-shirt, and an overshirt. Didn't mean that he wasn't nervous wearing what he was on his first day on the job.
In fact, it will only get worse if you continue asking pointless questions.’’
First Zachariah and Uriel disobeyed his DIRECT order, and then he goes to check on the Winchesters.. and they still haven’t decided.
‘’I’m wondering Castiel. You seem to have an unlimited amount of faith in these brothers, but they are surely taking there time to show up huh? Do you think they are even looking for you at all? Or do you think they haven’t even noticed that you’re gone?’’
‘’You know. You’re not as bad as I thought you were Gabe.’’ Dean said with a smile.
‘’I- Forgot.. ‘’ A cracked laugh escaped his mouth.
Cas smiled, ‘’Yeah.’’
before deciding against it and instead asking Dean about the picture on his bedside table again.
''More... bearable.''
‘’Or you find another shitty joint again.’’
Dean carefully stroked his hand through a couple of feathers.
He had gotten Jack back home.
Castiel didn't reply.
Because this bond wasn’t broken in one night.
Castiel thought.
‘’Yes and no.’’
The angel was so freaking strong, even when he was getting more human with each minute passing, he was still so strong.
He turned left when the road ended at a bluff, but he kept looking at the water out the window, trying to spot paddleboarders around Sam in the passenger seat.
“Of course.”
“Will you kiss me?” Cas’ voice is barely above a whisper.
They sing together. Dean does some air guitar moves and lets Cas take some of the harder notes. Dean finds himself having more fun than he’s had in a while. It’s innocent fun, at least until Cas gets right up in his face, catching his eye in the same intense way he had on stage last night, to sing the next bit. He trails the knuckles of his free hand down the side of Dean’s face.
Cas comes out of the bedroom in a faded Styx t-shirt and jeans that are a size too big, his socks hanging loosely around his feet and dragging as he walks. He hears Dean turn on the kitchen faucet, so he heads in that direction across the motel room.
“…‘oh’?” Dean looks over at him. Cas looks anywhere but Dean, and when he does look back, it’s almost shy, and the beginnings of a blush have appeared on his cheeks.
“Well, it’s true, so get used to it.” Still a little rough around the edges. He hears Cas chuckle. That’s nice to hear, too.
“Hey.”
Cas pulls Dean even closer. “I’ve already got everything I want, what could I possibly wish for?”
intentional. He’ll have to ask about that. Good conversation starter.
too quiet, so Dean turns on the cassette player. He hesitates.
Dean sighs. He can’t deny it.
So, he asks him. “What else?”
You’re both still in your dress shirts, but your matching ties are undone and your suit jackets are discarded.
Dean stares up at the opening band, introduced to the crowd as “Castiel.” He’s impressed with how flushed out the instrumental section is. Along with the drummer, guitarist, and bassist, there’s also a trumpeter, cellist, keyboardist, and two violinists. They’re all similarly dressed in business casual wear, with button downs in varying colors. They’re standing still, looking down as a low reddish light fades in on them. The center of the stage is empty for a moment, then a man with no instruments walks into the space. Dean reasons he’s who Charlie mentioned, and boy was she right.
Dean takes it from his hands and wraps it around his neck, pulling Cas in to kiss him. "Thought you might," he says with a wink.
Dean sighs heavily. His hands flex once, then he moves closer to Castiel, settling his body more fully against the angel’s.
“Hell yeah, I am.”
Cas smiles thoughtfully, still looking at the road. “I have some ideas.” He looks to Dean and holds his hand out. “Shall I lead the way?”
“You trying to get into my pants, Dean?”
Cas moves closer to him on the blanket, wrapping his arms around Dean in a comforting embrace that neither will ever get sick of.
“Aw, shucks.”
Dean can hear the absolute terror in Cas’ voice, the unspoken
Dean shifts his hips so they align with Cas’, making them both gasp. Without breaking the kiss, Cas twists his head again and puts his hands on Dean’s hips. Cas’ hips jerk upward in time with his pulling down on Dean’s sweatpants, moaning every time Dean thrusts his hips down in response.
Dean dives under a wave while Castiel hops up to float over it. He tries to spot Dean under the foam, but isn’t able to. Then he feels hands on his hips, and Dean pops up right in front of his face.
“Also Cas is devastatingly handsome,” he says to lighten the mood.
“I could grab you some sunglasses?” Sam says, half joking. Cas just laughs.
“Best pick up line.”
☼ ☼ ☼
He doesn’t have to look for long. Dean hears the Impala’s door open and shut behind him, then Cas appears by his side. He waves at Sam. Sam waves back as he pulls away, smiling all too knowingly.
Now he stands with Cas at the water’s edge, their bare shoulders touching, shirts tucked into the back pockets of their swimsuits. Dean knows Cas could stand still for hours, days even, but he’s getting restless. He looks to the south and spots a small pier about a mile away.
Dean argues for poker but Eileen talks him out of it, citing that the hunters would probably have an unfair advantage against Cas and Jack. They settle on a few rounds of blackjack without betting, despite Dean trying to get some started using the various snacks they’d brought with them (if some snacks are handed over wordlessly between the brothers as they play, no one comments on it).
Cas stops walking, turning to fully face Dean with a serious look. “Don’t discredit yourself, Dean. You’re very smart. You didn’t have much of a formal education yet you still know so much. I would even rate the practical, useful knowledge you have over my list of factoids, because why would you ever need to know that scallops have up to 200 eyes unless you’re trying to impress someone with fun facts?”
Okay, NOW he’s utterly, utterly defeated.
“Yes, please.”
“Of course," Castiel says. He leans forward over the table and continues, lower and quieter this time, "And that’s not the only place you can come.”
“I will. I didn’t want him to follow me.” Cas’ grip on Dean’s arm tightens till Dean can feel his nails. “He’s got work to do.” Oh, the sadness in Cas’ voice almost makes Dean wish he hadn’t followed him. But no, he had no choice. He would follow Cas anywhere.
With nothing but the moonlight and the crash of the waves around them, Dean lets himself be loudly enthusiastic, moaning and making breathy noises into Cas’ mouth. His hands roam up and down Cas’ sides, his fingers rake down Cas’ back. He’s probably exaggerating with the noise a bit, but Cas doesn’t seem to mind.
Cas smiles at him, but Dean still hasn’t met the angel’s eyes. He reaches his arms out while Cas watches with curiosity. His fingers brush Cas’ shoulders before settling behind them on the wings. He tugs at them slightly. He finally looks up at Castiel.
Dean looks at his arm. “Only if I can get all the glitter off me by then.”
“I thought you were here to help me get dressed?”
“Ah, you’ll see.”
“It was, uh. Really awesome spending my first Pride with you.”
“So am I,” he says, the picture of composure.
Dean sits cross-legged on their blanket with Cas behind him, rubbing sunscreen into his back. Cas has beautiful, broad hands, and Dean appreciates whenever they’re on him. And when Cas starts digging his thumbs into the knots just under the back of Dean’s neck, Dean makes a noise that has Sam looking over in disgust.
“You got to confess once. Now it’s my turn.”
“Yeah, I did. I’ve gotten to know him really well while we’ve been performing together, and he’s really cool. AND I knew you’d think he’s dreamy. Was I right, or was I right?” She waggles her eyebrows at him.
“Next time you should keep your eyes open,” Cas cuts him off, deliberately.
Sam just rolls his eyes. “Sure, Dean.”
Finally, Cas says, “I want you to kiss me.”
“Goodnight,” he whispers sleepily.
“Dude! Dinner!”
“Of course.”
“Excuse me?” the person says.
He falls asleep on your shoulder.
“Hey,” Dean says, smirking. Castiel wraps his arms around Dean’s neck.
He springs to his feet, makeshift blade in hand, and runs.
“I had to rethink basically my whole life, but I’m comfortable with who I am now.”
“Well, you were pretty awkward back there.”
“I did say that,” Cas says, matter-of-factly. Some of the tension alleviates now that they’ve both spoken. Dean takes that as his cue to keep this conversation going.
“What?”
Dean jumps up with newfound purpose and grabs both Cas’ hands to haul him up, dragging him towards the surf. When they pass the others, Sam looks up with a smile.
“And Dean?” Cas says breathily directly into his ear, which makes Dean moan and grind down just a bit harder. Fuck, he hopes Cas keeps talking. Wait, right, Cas wants him to respond.
“Bring him back.”
“Really? I feel like they’re cutting off the blood flow to my legs.”
Dean shrugs, a blanket rolled up under his arm. “Probably not, but who cares? It’s a pretty small beach, dude, no one’s gonna come check.”
Cas wags a finger at him. “Talent isn’t the point of karaoke, Dean. The point is to have fun. Let loose. I’m sure you sorely need that.”
Dean kisses him again, open-mouthed and lazy. He can taste the coffee on Cas’ tongue. Cas hand goes up to the back of his neck, and he pulls on the hair there. Dean moans into the kiss, the thoughts he was having before Cas walked into the room reigniting.
“Psh, no, uh. Just wasn’t expecting it?”
After about forty minutes, they reach the pier. They walk down it, avoiding skateboarders and glancing into fishermen’s buckets. Castiel comments on the interesting pale turquoise color of the railing as they lean over it to watch the surfers below.
“Dude.”
The hotel room is small, but it has everything they need. Two queen beds take up most of the room, but there’s a coffee table with a small two-person sofa at the foot of one, as well as a small desk with one office chair. They had forgone fancier accommodations in order to be as close as possible to the beach. They were lucky they even found one room in this place, most hotels were already booked up. It was summer, after all.
“I must apologize for teasing you yesterday, Dean. Charlie told me you’d be easily flustered and I admit I wanted to see if it was true.”
Silence. Dean can practically feel the unspoken words. Seems like it’s Cas’ turn to be bad at expressing his feelings. He turns to face Cas, one hand slung over the steering wheel and the other in between them.
They walk around the small space, sidestepping kids and appreciating the variety of creatures on display.
“No worries, it’s a pretty weird name,” Castiel says. “It’s not a stage name, either. Quite interesting, no?” He looks directly at Dean, like he’s waiting for him to say something stupid again.
“I’ll be fine. They’ll be fine.”
“How?”
Jack smiles at him and Cas feels wonderful. Happy. So very happy. Eileen is smiling too, probably feeling something similar.
“Yes, my dear, dear best friend?”
“Thank you so much.”
“But if it so much as itches, you let me know.”
“That’s awesome, man,” Dean says sincerely.
He prepares to hear something like all angels love humanity, they’re supposed to, or even a throwaway “it’s beyond your comprehension.” But that’s not what Cas gives him.
“No, no. Well, yes,” Dean flicks his hands as he tries to think, “but they’re - it’s more than just that.” Dean stills and really looks at Cas. His eyes dart between Cas’ as he considers how to convey exactly what he’s thinking. It hits him suddenly. “It’s like…I know there’s a universe of stars behind them, even in the daytime.”
“Cas, what?”
“Can I ask you something?”
Cas laughs behind him, placing a kiss on the back of Dean’s head. He stops the massage but continues with the sunscreen. He takes extra care to add multiple layers to Dean’s left shoulder.
“Ah…”
Jack jumps up with Cas close behind, but Sam shakes his head.
“Oh I told him you’re bad at flirting with men.” Dean almost trips on nothing. “Women? You’re basically as good as I am, but men? My man, you fall apart and it’s hilarious. So when you proved me right, I’m sure he thought it was at least a
“It’s nice to hear it now, though,” Cas continues. “More than nice.”
“Nah, I think they fit you fine.”
. There’s a few larger, longer-beaked marbled godwits,
“Tell me what else you want.”
Cas arches an eyebrow. “Why? Where are we going?”
That stops Cas in his tracks, surprise totally taking over his face. Dean can see Cas hadn’t ever considered asking. For all the speeches, the subtle declarations, the
“Yes, great whites can get up to twenty feet long. Females, anyway.”
“That’s me. And?” Cas raises his eyebrows. “What do you think of her?”
Cas keeps his attention on Dean. "I've seen it before, but never reflected in your eyes."
“That would take the fun out of museum visits, wouldn’t it?” Cas says. “Me pointing out all the inaccuracies?”
But it was a word from Cas that finally stopped him from going through with it. He reminded Dean they were staying for the week, and convinced him to sign up for surf lessons the next day. Cas even signed up with him.
"Uh, rainbows? Y'know," Dean says as Cas holds up a rainbow tie. "Gay stuff."
His hand flexes in the empty space you leave on his bed.
Dean tries to change the subject, or at least slow Sam’s tirade down. “Where’s Eileen?”
“Fuck, that’s cold!”
Cas breathes out all at once. “And you called
angels have a feather frenzy when they—”
Dean is uncharacteristically quiet in response, so Cas turns to him. There’s so much unrepressed love on Dean’s face that Cas almost asks him if something is wrong. But then Dean’s smirking at him, trademark confidence on his features.
“I love you.”
Dean once told him in passing that people born near the ocean, in the fresh sea air, were healthier. He’d talked about the pull some experienced - people born near water often come back to it, almost always ended up living near it. Castiel could understand why.
“Well,” Dean starts, “you gotta think about the, um. Pop culture angels. Y’know, halos, fluffy wings, beings of goodness. Not the warriors of God types.”
"You could have made it with your funny magic."
"Why?" Sam asked her.
"Dear Emily, I must ask why you made us search for you. It would have been much easier had you just come to us like you're supposed to."
"Gabe..."
"Oh, right. I didn't introduce myself. Silly me. My name is Donna Hanscom. I'm usually up in Minnesota, but Amara told me I should come down here. It took me a while, but here I am, and ready to get to work."
He quickly unlocked the door before relocking it and resetting the alarm. Having a moment of silence, Dean tried to figure out what was going on. The only thing that he determined was that it was way too cold. He immediately made his way to the thermometer and noticed a note on it.
"Only reduced?" Naomi screeched. "We were told that the charges would get dropped completely."
"Lady, I have better things to do than talk to you. I'm sure you can talk about mythology to someone who gives a damn."
"Don't worry," Celine said with a softer tone. "I'm used to idiots like that. Now... what can I help you with?"
"Let me guess?" John said grimly from the corner of the room. "The two of us go back to the basement."
"Goodbye, Sam," the man told the boy. "I'll see you in class Monday."
Once on the outside, they started toward the main part of town. It looked so different than the last time he had been here in Lawrence. Last time, he was just following his sons around, making sure they were safe. The city was crowded, as any downtown area was in the summer. Coming across a newspaper stand, John decided to stop to check the date. Thursday, June 16, 2011, it read. Showing Mary the date, she became more worried about the time period she suddenly found herself in.
“You don’t have to apologize.”
“Cas! Castiel!” he shouts at the perfectly blue sky. He turns back to Bobby, gesturing wildly. “How does this work here, can I just shout and he’ll hear me, do I hafta pray-”
“Okay, now that I know what your voice sounds like, I’m going to choose one for you that’s in your range.” He takes a moment to consider a few songs before settling on one. “Ah. ‘Sister Christian’ by Night Ranger. Is that acceptable?”
Dean admires his reflection, standing with his hands on his hips as he poses in his yellow Star Fleet uniform. “Obviously, I’m Kirk.”
After a moment, Cas pulls back with a teasing smile. “And this won’t?”
Dean loves the beach.
“No, but - ”
When Cas is done he leans forward, putting his arms around Dean’s middle. He rests his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “Done.”
“God, I’m really a mess, huh?” he says, smiling at her.
“Yes, Dean. They’re sturdier than you seem to give them credit for.”
look into Dean’s soul with the way he can read him like that.
Dean was looking forward to seeing Cas wear something other than the business casual button down that he'd seen onstage. He himself was wearing the outfit Charlie helped pick out, along with his lucky underwear (not the pair he wore when he wanted to GET lucky, but the one he wore when he wanted to BE lucky, because he’d be damn lucky if Cas agreed to a second date after this unplanned mess).
They kiss like they’re trying to make up for lost time (and in a way, Dean realizes, they are). But knowing they have time means they aren’t rushing this. It’s slow, deliberate, and goes on for a long, long while. It fills Dean with warmth. He feels calm, serene.
“All right.” Dean shakes his shoulders, getting into character. He fixes a half-lidded look on Castiel, one eyebrow raised. “Well, I disagree. I think you
Nothing in the rest of the set is nearly as slow and hypnotizing as the first song, but Dean hardly ever looks away from the singer, hoping to catch his eye again.
10 points to whoever recognized the two Cockles references lol
I just love writing dialogue. So, so much dialogue.
The first thing he did when he got out of the car was change his shoes, throwing his boots into the trunk and grabbing some flip flops. He fed the meter an entire roll of quarters before helping everyone gather their things.
“Dean,” Sam said, “the road. We’re almost there.” He indicated the beach they’d chosen on the map of southern California spread out on his lap.
✧💫✧💫✧💫✧
Dean puts his cheek on Cas’. “You been makin’ wishes?” he asks.
“Dean -”
“Uh huh,” Castiel breathes into his neck. The feeling against his spit-slick skin makes Dean shiver.
“You know I can’t,” Dean replies, looking away from Castiel. His hands tighten around Cas’ hips protectively. Cas puts a finger under Dean’s chin and turns his head back to face his own. Cas looks straight into his eyes, serious.
“What’s up?” Dean asks, leaning into him.
“Sounds like a plan.” Dean starts the engine and pulls away from the apartment. Suddenly he’s worried it’s too quiet in the car so he moves to turn on the radio, but Cas starts talking.
Dean immediately responds by running his tongue over Cas’ bottom lip. Cas grabs his jacket collar and pulls him in closer, responding with his own tongue in Dean’s mouth. Cas tastes ethereal. He is an angel, after all.
“Indeed.”
“Foster home. So you’re adopted?”
Cas had gone into his drowsy morning-after mode, so the only reply is a rumbling, “Mhm” into Dean’s neck.
“Leave him alone,” Cas says protectively. He sounds incredibly fierce, righteously furious even in the face of this overwhelmingly powerful entity.
“Thank you.”
Dean sits up, puts his arms around Castiel, tucks his chin onto his shoulder, rubs his cheek against Castiel’s ear.
That weekend, they stand with hundreds of people, watching the drag performance on a makeshift concert stage in the middle of the road. Dean has the headband on, and he is covered in glitter. Shiny heart-shaped stickers dot his forearms and cheeks, and confetti is caught in his hair. He sings along as loud as he can to the Queen song blasting through the speakers, one arm around Cas’ shoulders, swaying and pulling Cas along with him. A bi flag that he bought from a vendor for $10 is tied around his shoulders like a cape. Cas, in his typical attire save for the rainbow tie, sings along as well. He rests one hand on the small of Dean’s back, while the other waves a small rainbow flag in time to the song.
Cas leans into Dean’s hand. “I love you, too.”
Cas looks at Dean with an easy smile on his face, and Dean could have sworn the guy was smug about something.
Castiel just shrugs. “You don’t have any food allergies, do you?”
“So, you wouldn’t be averse to a second date?”
“Charlie?” Cas says, putting his arm back around her and ruffling her hair. “Are the ladies coming as well?”
He opens it to Sam, who looks at him with equal parts worry and anger. Sam gives him a once-over and the worry fades. Now he’s just angry.
Dean thinks fondly on when he told Bobby he was bisexual. He took it better than Dean could have hoped for, and his coworkers had taken it in stride as well. Dean thought Bobby had gone a little big with the rainbow Pride flag hanging in the front office building of the shop, above the counter on a string with a few local sports teams’ flags. But if that made a customer feel more comfortable - or, alternatively, stopped someone from using their services - then Dean was all for it.
. Dean swallows hard.
“Yeah, I do.”
“I like it too,” Dean says.
What a month it’s been, huh? Anyway, I think it is the ultimate travesty that Netflix changed some of the music in Supernatural. Example: “Sugar, We’re Going Down” was in 1x05. I am also a huge FOB fan so it had to go in. And “Sister Christian” was what Jensen sang at VegasCon 2015, which was the first time I heard him sing live. It was magical. (What are the chances that a karaoke place has the song? Probably very low. But this is my universe!)
“Yeah! You’re welcome, Sam,” Charlie says triumphantly. “Maybe he’ll stop moping around now that he’ll be busy.”
You don’t think you’re worth the trouble, but you don’t want to cast doubt on his worthiness.
Cas squeezes him playfully. “You know I’m serious.” He moves his head back and reaches up to put a finger under Dean’s chin, turning his husband’s head so he can see the stars reflected in his eyes once more. “You’re the one thing that I want.”
They hold hands and start to walk back to the Impala, parked a few blocks down from the main parade route to keep her away from the crowd. They walk through a residential neighborhood in comfortable silence, listening to the fading noises of the parade. Before Cas rounds the hood to get into the driver's seat, Dean pulls his hand.
“Why is that obvious?” Cas asks.
Cas is about to ask if she thinks that was intentional on the author’s part when he hears Dean shout. He looks over just in time to see Sam catch up to his brother and tackle him into the water. Eileen giggles at the way Sam shakes his hair when they surface.
“Look at me.”
“Not exactly. Gabriel had been adopted, and moved out to rent his own place just as I aged out. He took me in. I consider him my older brother. In fact, I consider everyone from the home to be my siblings. It’s not by blood, but they are my family. Everyone in our band is from the same home. It was a very Christian place, which is why we’re all named after angels.”
He trusts you to follow him, and you do (there will come a time soon when you won’t).
“Do you like classic rock?” Now, this was an important question. It could make or break their relationship. Rock was almost as important to Dean as his car.
“Oh, no, he can just smell the desperation on you.”
The next text a few minutes later is Castiel’s address. After a quick
“She’s immaculate,” Cas says. “I have to ask, judging by your reverence, it seems you wouldn’t let just anyone work on her. Do you do maintenance yourself?”
“That would take far too long.”
Cas grins at him. “Hi. It looks like you
Dean just stares for a second longer. He rubs his cheek with his own hand, looking at the grime. “Uh. I guess I’ll go home first, yeah?”
“Because what if they aren’t there again one day? And you leave because you think I only love you because you’re an angel?”
He hears typing and his phone pings against his face with a text notification. It’s Castiel’s number, followed by a series of very angry emojis.
He puts his arm around Castiel and turns him towards the car. He leaves his arm there as they walk across the sand, still warm despite the lack of sunlight. Cas lifts his hand to hold Dean’s where it rests on his shoulder.
“You talk real poetically.”
“You said that the one thing you want, you know you can’t have.” Out of the corner of his eye he sees Cas tense up. There goes the comfortable atmosphere they’d achieved during the drive. But he needs answers, so he continues. “What did you mean?”
“Did you just Han Solo me?”
You intertwine your fingers with his.
“Is it ‘interesting’?” Dean does air quotes, mocking what Cas said about Baby. It earns him a chuckle as Cas opens the passenger door and gets out.
“You goddamn idiot, why would you say all that and then leave me? You didn’t give me a chance to say it back. You deserve to hear me say it, Cas, ‘cause I care about you, too. So much. And if you want me, you can have me. You can have me. I want you to have me, and I want you, too. Because I love you, Cas. I love you. Happiness
to any of it. It hardly seemed fair. To top it all off, Cas had also been avoiding Dean. Or, at least, it seemed that way.
And, maybe, nice things like getting to hang out on the beach with his family without having to stop the world from ending.
Cas scrunches his nose once. “It’s the Christian upbringing, no? My angel namesake? Well, I assure you, Dean, I’m not some repressed virginal blushing angel.”
“Whatcha watchin’?” Dean asks as he comes up behind the couch. He leans down to kiss Cas on the head. Cas makes a small pleased noise without taking his eyes off the screen.
“Who wants to play pickle?” he asks, rubbing his hands together excitedly.
“It wasn’t just me-“ Cas starts, but Dean cuts him off with a look, silently telling him to
Cas looks back at Dean, confused as to why this emotion would elicit this response. These weren’t happy tears. He tries again, cupping Dean’s cheek with his hand.
have sex on the beach.”
“Okay, maybe I’m feeling like a teenager on a first date. Nerves are going fuckin’ haywire and…ugh. I don’t know. It’s just…different, y’know? I have no idea what I’m doing. I just don’t have as much experience with men! I’m not as confident, and I am NOT used to that.”
“Thank you, Sam. And Dean?” Cas says, turning his piercing gaze to Dean. “What did you think?”
“Say the thing, Cas,” Dean says as he ties Cas’ cravat.
A screech in the distance startles you out of your respite.
“Yeah, ‘oh shit’! I texted you to see if you were ready, but when you didn’t respond we just drove to the restaurant. Figured you might already be driving there. We got there and waited for a goddamn hour. I called you multiple times. Both of you! When you didn’t answer, I started to think something was wrong, but
“Thank you! We’re Castiel, and that was ‘Hearts a Mess.’ Next up is ‘I Feel Better.’ I better see some feet moving!” he says energetically.
The light from the moon illuminates the beach so they have an easy time finding their way. It glints off the foam of the waves. The sand is cool under their feet.
The applause dies down as the intro to the first song builds and the singer steps up to the mic. Dean definitely doesn’t notice the way the guy slowly wraps his hand around it, long fingers caressing the metal. The singer closes his eyes as he begins singing, low and quiet. Dean is instantly transfixed by his voice: somehow eerie, yet overwhelmingly calming.
They forget the meteor shower a few minutes. Then, a light so bright that they can see it through their closed eyelids brings their attention back to the heavens. The last remnants of the comet debris seem to stain the inky darkness of the night.
“Guess so,” Dean says. “And I don’t hafta impress anyone anymore.” He grabs Castiel’s hand again. “You’re already impressed with me, right?”
“I know,” Cas says with a peculiar inflection.
“Well, obviously I gotta pick a Zepp song. You can handle that, right?”
“Oh my god.”
“Ah. Cool,” Dean says trying to save himself despite the blush he feels creeping up his face.
“And you.” Sam mimics the motion as he walks to his car. “Find your guy.”
Dean closes his eyes and turns his face to the sky, utterly defeated. Or so he thinks.
The building and its seating were directly on the sand. They sold food like hot dogs and smoothies, and rented various beach equipment. Dean immediately wanted to rent a surfboard. Sam told him it was a stupid idea, Dean didn’t even know how to surf, he was definitely going to hurt himself!
He closes the distance between them. It starts as the slightest brush of lips, Dean gently applying pressure and Cas pushing back. Then Cas tilts his head and parts his mouth.
