They seem unfocused and glazed over, tears threatening to spill over again.
“I won’t ever leave you Dean.” Cas whispers, his lips trailing over Dean’s. “I won’t let you go through this alone. I won’t force you, but always remember that I’m here for you no matter what.” Dean lets his forehead rest on Cas’ shoulder, his body filled with relief.
“Stop staring, man.” Dean chuckles and Cas shakes his head a little, smiling, relieved that Dean’s mood is nearly back to normal at the moment.
“Dean?” a whisper appears behind him and he flinches slightly before he turns around, fear in his eyes until he realizes who’s standing now in front of him. “C-Cas?” he asks, not sure if he’s dreaming. Cas smiles at him, his dark hair still looking like two years ago, short, but still long enough to be lightly pressed against his forehead. He’s wearing a hoodie under his parker but still looks like he’s freezing anyway.
“Dean you need to calm down, you’ll past out if you keep breathing that fast.”
The snowflakes are dancing around them and Dean realizes with every second that passes more and more that he isn’t dreaming.
Jess forces Cas to finally sit down next to Dean so the Winchester can let his head rest on Cas' lap.
Burying Dean.
Cas moves closer to the bed and his eyes get locked at the white bandages around Deans left wrist.
The Winchester got a little lighter over the past two years though he gained more muscles.
“Shhh.” Cas mumbles, his lips still trailing over Dean’s body.
How did they end up here? On a graveyard burying a twenty-six year old veteran.
“Dean?” he knows that voice, it’s Cas’. He can’t even think straight anymore his mind screaming at him and he can’t hold back the tears in his eyes. It seems to happen way too many times these days, not like he can control it. He can’t really control anything anymore since he came back.
The Winchester looks at the ceiling for a while before getting rid of his socks, jeans and flannel and actually lies down to at least get some sleep.
Dean lifts his head and moves onto the hood of the Impala, Cas sits down next to him. Their arms are wrapped around each other and Dean’s head is resting on Cas’ shoulder while they watch the rest of the New Year’s firework in a calming and comfortable silence.
"Dean, what happened?" Cas asks while Jess carefully cheks Deans swollen knuckles.
“You alright?” Cas asks with worry after they were silent for a few minutes and Dean just nods. Cas knows that the man next to him is far from okay but he also knows that he has to give him the time he needs.                                                                      They just keep sitting next to each other, backs against the wall behind them, staring at the wall in front of them.
Sam enters the room and Cas pushes slightly away from Jess to look at the younger Winchester. “He’s asleep but one of us should check on him every now and then.” Sam whispers, not trusting his voice, Cas and Jess just nod.
“Dean?” Cas starts softly but the man in front of him doesn’t react so Cas just sits down in front of the curled up Winchester. “You’re home Dean. None of us will get hurt. You made it. You are the strongest man I ever knew and-“ Cas stops but Dean doesn’t react. “Dean, I- I love you so much.” Cas’ voice gets thinner and he feels tears burning in his eyes but he refuses to let them fall. “I love you too.” comes a quiet whisper from the corner and it makes Cas smile from ear to ear.
He grunts again at the hands that land on his arm and shoulder, Dean gives him one more apologetic look, “Okay, 1… 2…”
He thinks he would remember stepping into the contraption of his own accord. It wasn’t ready yet, he wasn’t ready. He needs to calm down, needs to think, something is very very wrong and he can’t get a thought past the hurried panic running through his nerves. It would all be okay if he could Just. Fucking. Breathe.
“I really thought you and I could figure things out,” Dean continues after a few beats of silence, still pressing most of his body weight into the young hunters lower back, “I thought we’d talk, I’d show you I’m better this way, you'd learn your place, and then we’d both live happily ever after.”
Lucifer is smiling, Sam realizes after a moment. Outwardly it’s soft, a small quirk of his vessels lips that could almost be considered fond; something dark hides behind it and Sam feels his already breathless lungs constrict with a dark feeling of dread.
He opens his eyes at the sound of a scuffle, and he almost cries in relief at the sight of the Seraph. Dean screams wordlessly, fighting tooth and nail against the angel’s grip around him, it doesn’t budge. Castiel doesn’t so much as spare Sam a glance, glowing blue eyes focused on the demon with a mix of despair and rage.
He stands, harsh grip on his little brother’s hair not relenting. Sam grunts at the added pressure, struggling to get his good arm underneath him and follow the tug upward. His head throbs and he can feel a few hairs parting with his scalp. Dean doesn’t stop and eventually Sam manages to get his knees underneath him. He eases his grip minutely once Sam had stopped squirming, merely glaring at his older brother. Sam hates how pathetic it feels.
He jolts awake.
“Come out, come out, wherever you are…”
He shoves a hand through the sweat dampened hair that sticks to his forehead, forcing himself to lie back down. The clock on his bedside table reads 3:27, he’d only slept a couple hours. Dean nearly jumps as his door creaks open, casting a beam of light over the dark floor, it’s blocked a second later by a shadow.
Dean too had gone still, his eyes wide and brimming with tears. The room goes deathly quiet, even Lucifer doesn’t speak for those first few minutes, Sam almost wishes he would. He hates the quiet, it feels accusatory, feels like the calm before the storm, and Sam wants to shatter it.
Shit.
Lucifer discovered his need for physical intimacy pretty quickly, especially being in the cage where all he knew was pain that need had turned into a desperation. Sam knows the archangel is trying to exploit it, knows it’s just another manipulation tactic trying to really break Sam. However he’ll be damned if he can’t admit it’s a good one. Pain he can handle, can compartmentalize for the most part; but the devil’s soft words and light touches break down his defenses like nothing else, and god help him he doesn’t know how to fight it. Sam hates it, hates Lucifer, but in moments like this he just wants to relish in something other than mind-numbing pain.
When he wakes up again his body is screaming at him, and the memory hits him like a punch to the gut. He opens his eyes trying desperately not to move lest he hurt himself even more, the familiar motel is a comfort and he relaxes slightly. His shoulders still ache, but the pain had faded significantly since they had been put back in place. On the bright side when he tries to move his hands they cooperate without much additional pain, he thinks that must be a good sign.
Dean’s voice startles him, he turns his head to watch as his brother seats himself on the edge of the bed. His eyes are sunken, tired, Sam wonders when he’d last slept, “Sore, but i’ll be okay.” His voice is rough, how long had he been out.
“Ju-just get it over- over with.”
“You ran after you started the apocalypse, when you lost your soul, and now you’re trying to leave me again, it’s just not fair.” His hand tightens again, his other one soon joins the first, lifting his leg just slightly off of the ground.
“Sorry Sam, not how this game works," finally with a sigh he stands once again. Clicking his tongue as though scolding a disobedient puppy he paces towards the other two captives, “you’ve gotta choose, one life for another-- I’ll even sweeten the pot here, I’ll make their death painless as I can, deal?”
Gabriel huffs out a shaky breath, muttering something that sounds like an apology. He turns away and Sam feels defeat twist his gut painfully.
Even the vampires seem to have gone quiet, leaving a dead silence in their wake. He’s well and truly alone, and god if it doesn’t hurt. His tears had dried-- or perhaps they hadn’t ever really fallen-- and he stands. The darkness around him feels wrong, like a warning of something that he can’t quite place.
The grace finishes with his ankle Sam hadn’t noticed was broken, and just as quickly it retreats leaving a lazy chill behind. Sam trembles now that his body has the capability to, he doesn’t move beyond that, let’s calloused fingers continue to scratch against his scalp in some sick mockery of comfort. Sam's face is wet, tears trailing down over his cheekbones and into his hair. His newly healed body screams at him to flee, he doesn’t.
“Dean…?”
“Don’t.” Sam flinches at the icy tone, Dean doesn’t so much as turn to look at him, Sam’s almost glad he doesn’t, afraid to see the anger in his eyes, “Just don’t, Sam.”
“De please-” he’s sobbing now, and the tears feel cold against his already tepid skin, “please not like this-- It’s not fair! This isn’t fair!”
Sam hadn’t had time to think before his body is moving on auto-pilot and the knife lowers. The one thing keeping him safe from the demon falling limply to his side without so much as a second thought, it feels like giving up.
It was rare for Lucifer to leave him with Michael for as long as he did. The younger of the two archangels was nothing if not possessive, he was never one for sharing. The devil only seemed to allow Michael’s fits so he could play this ridiculous game of caregiver. Lucifer enjoyed slowly piecing his broken boy back together, mending every wound and filling every crack in his soul with his own grace. Sam isn’t quite sure what the point is, they both know exactly how much worse it will get once he’s finished; yet Lucifer continues with his little act.
Set in s13e21. What happened to Sam's soul after he died in that cave? What if he was still there all along?
He’s quiet. Dean’s breath halts at the realization, for a moment he feels as though his own heart had stopped. Michael hadn’t stopped banging against the prison in Dean’s mind, ever since he’d been trapped it’s been a constant pressure against his skull, a feeling Dean had become accustomed too, but now-- It’s quiet.
And then there’s Cas. He hadn’t spoken save for a few choice words towards the devil who he continues to scowl at. Every once in a while his eyes will alight that magnificent blue of his grace only to quickly fizzle out. Sam can’t see well in the darkened room, doesn’t even quite know where they are or how they got here if he’s honest with himself. However, he had gotten a glimpse of the markings on the seraph’s bindings, enochian sigils he doesn’t quite recognize though their intentions are clear. Castiel doesn’t let his gaze leave Lucifer long, when he does it’s only to shoot Sam a look that he has yet to be able to decipher.
The hand is gone, and the pulling sensation starts up just as quickly as it had stopped. Sam tries once again to wriggle out of the handcuffs but when pain shoots up his arm he’s forced to still. The rope pulls taut, his arms stretched out behind his back as far as they could possibly go, and the man doesn’t stop, his feet start to leave the ground and Sam struggles to stay on the balls of his feet, then on his toes, until finally the ground is gone beneath him.
“Yeah, yeah,” he breathes out hoping his voice sounds steadier than it feels, “just a dream.”
He looks right passed Sam, eyes glued to the steadily drying mess of blood that makes up the young Winchester’s throat. Sam can feel the same wound mimicked on his own disjointed self, it’s tacky against his skin and he doesn’t quite have the courage to examine it. Gabriel takes a few steps forward, passing entirely the ghost screaming pleas from beside him. He kneels, Sam feels the pull of something trying to drag him back, it falls short. The archangel doesn’t have enough grace left, and that fact makes him curl into himself even further. Sam desperately wants to comfort him, tell him it’s alright, it’s not his fault. His hand passes right through Gabe’s shoulder.
Their steps are deafening, and the light at the end of the tunnel looks terrifyingly like loss. He can’t lose them, can’t let Dean go, not like this. They were supposed to do this together, they were supposed to be okay.
“Please, I-I  can’t.”
‘You’ve got front row seats now, figure it out,’ his brain offers unhelpfully. Sam takes a deep breath and slowly opens his eyes.
Honestly inspiration for this one hit me like a truck and I couldn't get the idea out of my head! I wish they would have given us more from demon Dean and Sam! :(
Sam wheezes in a few breaths, wincing when he feels a bone prodding at his lung. He half-expects the organ to collapse, it doesn’t. It goes quiet, and Sam feels his heart race with the newfound silence. Silence was never a good thing. He dares look upward to find his older brother and a boot to the face is what he gets in return. This time he does shout as the bones in his nose shatter. He doesn’t look up again. The fresh blood running down his face makes him queasy, or is that the concussion? He doesn’t really know.
I swear I will finish this thing eventually.
“Do you wanna talk about it?”
A few minutes--hours?-- pass before the pain in his chest is beyond unbearable and the lack of oxygen really begins to take its toll. Sam shoves himself over and this time he’s sure a few muscles tear sending shockwaves of red-hot pain through his body. The cage spins in his vision and for a moment he has to focus on trying not to throw up. His ribs grind against one another as he finally manages to get on his back, for a good while it leaves him breathless.
The sharp edge tears through his flesh skillfully, pulling apart layers of skin and muscle and releasing fountains of deep red. The second one doesn’t come so easily, he’s captivated by the disgusting warmth flowing over his skin in rivulets of such a beautiful red. The second one is quicker, his mind had quieted after the first… He knows the feeling of shock, can feel the static numbness sitting just at the back of his skull, he welcomes it.
“Poor thing-- left all alone,” and with that same gentle touch Sam has grown to hate so very much he’s being moved. His body screams in admonition and Sam suddenly becomes very aware of a few broken bones he hadn’t noticed prior. His throat scrapes with an attempted cry. He doesn’t squirm much, can’t for that matter, as he’s maneuvered so his head lies in the archangel’s lap.
He’s alive.
Dean’s his brother for god’s sake, Cas is his best friend, they’re family. Lucifer can’t expect him to kill one of them.
He can hear muttered voices to his left, he doesn’t recognize any of them.
He doesn’t want to leave Dean and at the same time he feels like he can’t stay any longer. Can’t watch the Winchester fall apart any longer.
Cas gets pulled out of his thoughts when Dean’s head drops onto his shoulder, eyes closed, asleep. He smiles at the Winchester, a calm feeling creeping through his body. He carefully lifts Dean’s head, not wanting to wake him up now that he’s finally able to sleep. He slowly lays Dean’s head onto the pillow and pulls the blanket over his legs and chest, the he heads to the bathroom to take a quick shower before he goes to bed too.
Dean heaves himself back onto the drivers seat of the Impala and rests his forehead against the steering wheel. He doesn’t even know where to go now. Cas really doesn’t want him and he can’t just go back to Jess and Sam and annoy them.
Cas is getting more nervous with every second that passes in which is just staring at him, lips lightly parted, tears welling up in his eyes.
This story is more or less close to an end. Buuut like I mentioed in a chapter before I'm already starting to beta read and add some details.
Dean closes his eyes, moves back and leans even more into Cas’ touch which makes his breathing calm down even more. After a few minutes Dean falls asleep in Cas’ arms who can’t fight the urge to sleep any longer aswell.
Cas looks around the guest room. It was now Dean’s room. But it was too clean, too tidy and it look like Dean tried to clean it before ending it all. It looks like the Winchester didn’t want anyone to have to go through the chaos of a room someone lived in.
Castiel found a dark and mostly hidden spot, sat onto the paved ground of the parking lot, pulled a joint out of one of the pockets of his beloved Trenchcoat – Dean usually mocked him for wearing it literally all the time – he lit the joint and inhaled deeply.
They finish the bagels Cas bought for breakfast, pack up their few things and go to the Impala.                                        Dean immediately heads for the passenger side and curls himself up on the seat once he’s in the car.                                               Cas sits down onto the driver seat and looks at Dean, concern in his blue eyes. Dean was obviously feeling better the past days and Cas shakes his head. He should’ve insisted on changing the motel room after Dean told him about his memories.                          “Wanna start driving today?” Dean lightly chuckles and Cas grins shyly before he starts the motor and heads to Sam’s and Jess’ place.                                                                            “You alright?” Cas, internally slapping himself, of course he’s not. “Yeah, don’t worry.” The Winchester smiles and is back to being quiet like the day he came back in a second.                                                                 Cas knows that telling him what happened just threw Dean back right into it so Cas just lets the Winchester sleep well knowing that Dean is sleeping better when he’s in the Impala with Cas. Castiel wakes him up after he stopped in front of Sam’s and Jess’ apartment. “Dean we’re here.” “What?” Dean flinches a little before he completely wakes up.                                                    Cas leaves the car expecting Dean to follow him but the Winchester stays in the car just staring at the apartment with big eyes. “Dean, wanna come?” Cas opens the passenger door and looks at the Winchester with worry.                                                       “I- I don’t know.” The Winchester stutters and Cas shakes his head. “C’mon, I guess Sam can’t wait to finally see you again.” But Dean just shakes his head like Cas did before.                                 “I didn’t talk a word with him in like two years, Cas.” “And? C’mon he really wants to see you Dean and don’t say anything else. We’re going up there now.”                                                  Cas helps Dean out of the car and lightly pushes the Winchester to the doorbell of the apartment and rings it before Dean can protest against this decision a second time.                                        Dean realizes that he didn’t really think it over when he told Cas that he wants to see Sam.
I don't believe this is going to be the laat chapter anymore since I really want to continue because I got more ideas throughout those months
Cas has to tell him about Jeremy but he can’t. Not after what happened the day before. He can’t let Dean be sad again but he isn’t a good liar either and hiding it from Dean any longer won’t work out.
“Dean?” he gasps before he realizes that he shouldn’t mention this to Dean before the Winchester mentions it himself. “What is it?” Dean asks with fear in his voice and pulls the shirt over his head as fast as possible. “I just woke up and you weren’t there.” Cas says in a whisper not trusting his voice. Dean just nods and grabs a flannel. Cas gets up not knowing what to talk about so he just remains silent while he grabs some clothes to wear before he grabs their bags and checks out of the motel.
"They've told him before but he refused." Cas whispers and the nurse looks a little confused. "Who's they?" Sam sighs. "he just came back from  oversea." We don't really know what happened, he's not the talking type." Cas suddenly realizes that Jess and Sam know less than he does but he isn't about to change that right now. It's still Deans decision.
After some time Dean starts to shiver lightly and Cas rubs his hand over the Winchester’s trembling back. “I never thought I would ever be able to live with you. Not after what happened.” Dean whispers, holding back a sob. He got so emotional over the past years and he just can’t work out how to live with it. Cas feels tears burning in his eyes. He hates seeing Dean like this, so vulnerable, it’s so not the Dean he met years ago in a bar in Michigan.
When the Winchester wakes up he needs a moment to actually figure out where he is before he remembers what happened and sighs in relief when he realizes that the tightness in his chest is gone. The lump in his throat is still there but it’s bearable.
“How long haven’t you taken them?” Cas whispers after a while and hears the Winchester turn onto his side, his back to the Novak. “Dean, please. This only works when we’re honest with each other. “I haven’t taken them since I’m back from the hospital alright?”, “So a week?”, “Yes, Cas, that’s what I just said.” Dean hisses and the Novak rolls his eyes at that.
He has to talk to Cas about his memories some more. Cas deserves to know what’s going on inside of Dean’s mind, he promised to tell him so he wouldn’t need to see a professional.
“I’m sorry.” Dean whispers and finally looks at Cas. Really looks at him, not that look where he’s somewhere far away.
“Dean calm down, you have to breathe slower.” Cas softly strokes his thumb over Dean’s folded hands, trying to calm the Winchester.
They push the bed against the wall before Dean disappears into the bathroom to take a quick shower. Once the Winchester closed the bathroom door Cas sinks down onto the bed and cups his face in his palms. He misses Dean, his Dean. He didn’t come back to Cas and he doesn’t know what else to do. ‘Give him time’ he thinks to himself and sighs. That doesn’t really help. He misses everything of Dean. The way the Winchester always teased him until Cas agreed on something, usually another hour of horrible music, or the way Dean was singing along to all his records not just humming. He misses all the time they spent together before everything went to shit, all the vacations, the nights in Manhattan, all the kisses they exchanged and placed on each other bodies, the way Dean always used to touch him-
Sam hopes that at least Jess could find a way to really get through Dean’s armor he built over the past years.
“I guess you saw the scars on my back.” Dean pauses for a second and Cas is afraid of what is about to come next but he doesn’t want to interrupt the Winchester.                                             “They tried to get statements of us how good they treated us. They wanted us to criticize our conduct of war and I guess just break our will. They- they- just, waterboarding, beatings, all that kind of crap until we got put back into group cells or solitary confinement. Nearly all the Boys of my unit died over there. I heard their screams until they just got quiet someday.”                                                       Dean tries to regain his voice, tears now streaming down his face.                                                                      “I don’t know how often they just took two to ten of us and just killed them, right where they were, in front of us, because they apparently were no good use anymore. I lost count to all the days I woke up with the thought of being with you only to be pulled back into the like blood and sweat smelling reality, in that fucking shit hole.”                                            Dean hisses, tears still streaming down his face and Cas can’t do anything besides pulling the now shaking man close against his chest and buries his face in Dean’s hair like he did the past few days.                                                                                “I don’t know how I got out. The only thing I remember is waking up in this damn hospital and a big bandage covering my whole back. I was in there for some time before I insisted on going home.”                                                                             Dean whispers and buries his face into Cas shirt trying to regain control over his shaking body. Cas feels the urge to apologize to Dean but he knows how stupid it is. An apologize won’t help much anyway.
Since the joint is finished he gets up, throws the last part of it on the ground, waiting for it to completely turn into ash.
“Dean?” he asks hesitantly. Maybe the Winchester really just needed a little space, something he can’t deny him.
“I’m tired, lets get some sleep.” Dean finishes and Cas can’t do anything against it. He can’t pressure Dean more than he already did. And to be completely honest he is really tired himself.
“Don’t need a professional man. There are just too many people around here, don’t really like it. Just wanna go back to Sammy’s.” Dean whispers and Cas sighs.
He feels like a total asshole but he knows he can’t keep helping Dean if he ever even did.
He actually stays in the car for a while after pulling up in front of his home. He wouldn’t say he was scared but he definitely didn’t want to run into his father. But knowing his luck this will probably be what’s going to happen.
He takes them off and looks at them for a second before he walks over to the chair and hangs them over the backrest. They’re Deans. He can’t just keep them after failed him.
The room is on the first floor and both men are glad that they don’t have to get upstairs. Cas opens the door and they step into the room. Next to the door is a small window with curtains on each side. On the other side on the left is a door leading into the bathroom and in front of them is a bed standing in the middle of the room only the headboard is moved against the wall. Next to the bed are a small closet and a nightstand.
After helping Dean to bed he goes back to the bathroom to at least get rid of the biggest shards on the floor and then finally joins Dean in the bedroom.
[and thx for all the reads, it's really freaking awesome!]
The sun is already up and Cas blinks some times to to get his eyes used to the light and the shimmering snow.
He expected a hiss, a cry or even an angry shout but when Dean remains silent he opens his eyes.
If I just lay here
“I can go with you.”, “It’s just an appointment for getting the stitches out. I’ll manage that.” Dean seems angry and Cas shakes his head. Handling  the Winchester can be really difficult sometimes. “That’s, I know you can handle that. I just wanna be there for you. Dean, I’m your boyfriend and I love you.” “Love you too Cas, but some things I have to do on my own.”, “That’s the point, you don’t have to.”, “Well I want to.” And with that and a short kiss Dean is out the door.
Dean lets his head fall back against the sink and breathes out. “I’m sorry, Cas. For everything.”  he whispers but Cas just shakes his head and sits down in front of the Winchester.
“How are you feeling?” it takes Dean a moment to answer. “Hurt. It hurts so freakin’ much, Cas” he whispers and that is what makes Cas to just want to run, curl up somewhere and never come back. Dean Winchester never admitted that he is hurt. “Dean, don’t move your hand it’ll be better for your wrist.” Cas whispers in a calm voice but gets confused when Dean shakes his head. “My chest hurts, feels like I can’t breathe.” He whispers and Cas realizes in horror what Dean is trying to tell him. Dean still has all the pictures creeping through his mind not letting him any kind of peace, not even for a moment and he can’t get rid of them.
“You shouldn’t have left Dean alone. He shouldn’t be alone.” the Novak mumbled, not looking at the Winchester. He only spared him a glance when he saw movement out of the corner of his eyes and accepted back the joint.
“It- my Dad, right after I stayed at yours for a week the first time.” Dean whispers and Castiel nods lightly.
“Is Sam here?” Cas finally asks and Jess nods before she leads them inside.                                                                    Their apartment isn’t as small as it appeared from the outside. It has a big hallway leading into a comfortable looking living room with Sam standing in the doorframe looking at his girlfriend. “Who is it Jess?” he asks and Jess and Cas move aside and Sam finally sees Dean who starts talking after staring at each other for some time. “Hey man!”
There is heavy talk of suicide and more in it. Please consider to not read this chapter if this triggers you.
“Merry Christmas both of them say and Sam points at the breakfast and the golden glowing Christmas tree. “This is our present for Christmas. Sam says before his and Jess’ hands fold together and a new beautiful silver ring is on Jess’ ring finger.
His muscles are relaxed and he’s breathing deep and calm. Cas smiles and studies Dean’s facial expression. He looks so beautiful when he’s asleep, with his long eyelashes, the freckles standing out all over his face and his slightly parted lips.
“I made you some breakfast.” he mumbles before he gets up and leaves the room again. He just can’t stand to be around the Winchester longer than possible. He’s afraid he might break down and confess his still existing love for Dean over and over again but he can’t let that happen. It’s not gonna help either of them.
Cas hand start trailing up and down Dean’s back making the Winchester throw his head back. Cas lets his hands trail down to Dean’s hips and moves the Winchester up a little so he’ll be able to hold him up a little longer. Dean wraps his arms even stronger around Cas’ neck and latter presses his face against Dean’s neck hands trailing down to hold Dean up at his upper legs before Cas steps closer and kisses Dean with passion.
“It is about Jeremy. Misses Forester called to inform you that-“ Cas stops and Dean keeps staring at him. “Jeremy died yesterday.” Cas whispers and waits for a reaction of Dean.
Dean pulls himself closer against Cas’ chest and buries his face against Cas’ shoulder, lightly moaning before he kisses Cas’ neck. Cas moves his lips over Dean’s chest before the Winchester pulls himself closer against Cas and continues kissing Cas’ neck. The Novak moans and Dean smiles into the kiss.
“Good morning, slept well?” both men nod and the doctor sits down in the plastic chair Castiel opted to sleep in a few hours earlier.
“I’m sorry Dean. It’s over. I can’t do this.” “Cas-” Dean’s voice breaks and tears start rolling down his cheeks, his shoulders are trembling and the Novak fears that the Winchester might break down and just crumble to the ground.
The first day of college after a week of living on Cas’ couch was more difficult than he thought. Getting back into the whole having to study process wasn’t easy, especially without any kind of motivation.
“Was nice talking to you Garth. I’ll see you tomorrow.”, “Dean-”, “I’m good man. Still here right?” he smiles even more and Garth nods before Dean turns around to get back into college and to trying to forget that stupid encounter with Garth. It just made him self-conscious of his arms and scared that the arms of his flannel might not play in his favor again.
Jess puts her elbows onto the table to steady her head with her hands. “Sorry.” Cas manages a whisper and Jess shakes her head frantically. “No, no, don’t apologize Cas, just don’t.”
Cas gets into the driver seat again and they head to the main road. “You excited?” Dean starts and Cas nods with a big smile. “Why Manhattan?” “If you wanna go somewhere else we can do that but I really enjoyed our last vacation to Manhattan so I thought it would be a good idea.” Cas says, glad that Dean is talking a little. “It’s awesome Cas and I don’t wanna go anywhere else. Manhattan was awesome and I’ve never been there for Christmas.” Dean says with excitement in his voice before he turns the music up and starts humming again.
Cas gives the present to Dean with a smile who takes it shyly but with happiness in his eyes and opens it slowly.
He writes down the number and the bartender makes the call, actually reaches someone, talks for a minute before hanging up again.
The shower is still running and the water is already getting cold when Sam knocks at the door, he’s been waiting for Dean and Cas for an hour.
“Cas, I’m trying alright. What I said earlier, about me wanting to die. I don’t. Really, I mean it, I don’t want to die. And at the same time I want to because I don’t wanna live anymore, at least now like this. Not with all that shit up here,” he points at his head and closes his eyes for a second, taking a deep breath before he continues.
Cas looks through Dean’s room. The room he’s still staying in. He hasn’t moved a thing besides the sheets on the bed since he arrived and he swore himself he’d keep it that way.
But enjoy this chapter!
Castiel nearly sprints to the phone as soon as it starts ringing worried something could’ve happened to Dean. He already feels guilty and regrets ending his relationship with Dean but he knows, no he hopes, that this is the right way. “Hello?” “Cas? Hey, it’s Sam.” “Is Dean with you?” “No he took off. A few days ago actually. I thought he was with you.” “He was here Sam. A few days ago, long enough to be back with you and Jess by now.” “Castiel, listen to me. I know you needed some time on your own and that’s perfectly fine. But ou have to find Dean! I mean it. You know how his brain is wired, even before the war.” “Sam, I can’t do it. I really can’t.” Castiel whispers and he can hear the younger Winchester sigh on the other end? “At least try to get him back here with Jess and me. He must be in your area as far as I know him.” “I’ll try Sam. But I’m no magician and he can’t stay here with me. I don’t want it get even worse.” “Trust me Castiel it cannot get worse.” Sam spits out before he just hangs up the phone.
“Cas! I asked you if I could get a pull.” “Sure.” he just hands Sam the joint, not really thinking about it.
“Gotta breathe here Sammy.”, “It’s Sam.”, “Bitch.”, “Jerk.” Dean smiles and sits down on his bed, Sam right next to him. “Are you feeling better?”, “Yeah. Stop worrying.”, Dean-”, “Sam. I mean it.” the younger Winchester just nods and looks at the ground before looking at Dean again.
“Wanna get up?” Cas wants to get Dean out of bed so he can give him the present he bought two years ago after Dean wrote him that they were about to get home which eventually never happened. It was the last letter he got from Dean who was supposed to arrive at home some days later but his unit disappeared in a sudden. “No, let’s stay in bed.” Dean whispers but gets up eventually. Cas stays in bed for another minute before he follows Dean into the bathroom.
“I think you should call that Chuck guy in the morning. He can help?” “Yeah? With what exactly Cas?” Dean pulls away and the warmth disappears from Cas’ side.
Over the past days Dean nearly stopped showing his emotions in such a heavy way that they nearly weren’t even visible. But now they just come rushing back onto him, creeping through his mind, making it hard to think, hard to breathe, hard to do anything. He never wanted to end like this, an emotional wreck.
What didn’t fit his life where the sounds and smells of the emergency room of the hospital he was currently in. The smell of disinfectant heavy and making him nauseous. He was sitting on a cheap plastic chair in a small waiting area watching the stuff rush into one of the operation rooms to his right. It was quite late at night and there weren’t many people in the waiting area but the few who were looked nervous and beaten down. He probably looked the same.
Cas would be no exception, Dean was sure. But-
Dean pulled away with a rough gasp, and he was surprised to hear the depth of his need in the sound.
“We’ve been through this before. Actually, I think we’ve been through this twice in the last few months.”
The storm was more like a hurricane, and yet Dean wouldn’t budge. He ought to have been chilled to the bone, but all he felt was numb. There was no heat or cold, no sense of danger to move him to shelter. There was no voice reminding him that Castiel wouldn’t want this for him. There was just the pounding of his pulse and his own gasping breath and the tears that were coming in earnest; only the rushing of the wind and the howling thunder and the sting of rain on his scalp. Only Dean and the hellish storm both inside and out.
Looking back, Dean guessed he should have known what Cas had meant. But he had been so wrapped up in whiskey and misery, so ensconced in self-loathing, just waiting for the other shoe to drop. He couldn’t see the damned forest through the trees, so he had spent more than one restless night wondering what
“Excuse me?”
Castiel would never hurt him now, but he couldn’t help but remember the shadow of wings on a wall or a brick wall digging into his back.
Cas looked pained, “Believe me, Dean. I really, really, really want to kiss you. But-,”
Dean raised his head to meet Cas’ eyes once more.
Below the surface of guilt and shame was something else. This wasn’t familiar anger, cold and bone-deep. This wasn’t flickering happiness; in the warm pastry of an apple pie, the autumn sunshine on the shiny black exterior of his car. This wasn’t even the edge of desperate confusion within him: dizzying desire for something unnamed, or the years and miles pulling him back from that dive.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head fondly, “Castiel, it’s fine. Your reasons are yours, man. I’m not going to be upset with you for wanting to take things slow, alright? Trust me, I get it.”
Chuck’s downfall.
Dean groaned into his hands, feeling the tips of his ears flush red.
“Everything.” And then he was gone with a rustle of wings, only lingering tension left in his wake.
ed trees
Cas was gone.
“How I treated you, y’know, before? How I’ve treated you since the beginning? I need you to understand that
That’s not to say he didn’t get it, though. In fact, he would wager that him and Cas had never been in such a similar state of being than they were in that moment. The stars really had been beautiful, more so than usual. The moon was spectacular, and light permeated every foot of that clearing. Stalks of grass and the rims of the Impala and the line of treetops and Castiel’s dark hair were rendered silvery by it. A soft breeze washed the scent of night-blooming flowers and the sound of flowing water towards them from nearby. The night had been full of crickets and starlight and Sam’s muffled snores, and most importantly, Castiel’s undaunting presence as he and Dean watched the universe for the hell of it. Dean had never felt so content in his life.
It glared at him, “Oh I think you heard me, Dean Winchester. I’m trying to tell you that it’s me, but as usual, you aren’t getting it through your head that sometimes good things do happen.”
“Because,” he said, “I love you.”
“Thank you.”
Dean’s grassy eyes had darkened to jade. Cas could feel his uneven breath against his own cheek. Still, his words were soft as they left his lips.
“Well…” Sam scrubbed a hand through his hair, “I’m here for when...y’know, just when.”
If he had all the time in the world to tell Cas everything the angel deserved to hear, it still wouldn’t be enough. But he
Dean’s eyes narrowed at the smile on Cas’ face, although he was happy it had returned.
“Dean,” Cas stopped in front of him, placing a hand on his face. Suddenly they were back in the crypt, need laid bare in the presence of bloodied fists and black eyes. “Oh, Dean.”
“Would that have been such a bad thing?”
“Say Sam’s name again, and I’ll put a bullet in your head. You may look and sound like Castiel, but if you think I won’t make good on my promise, think again.” Dean’s voice was cold steel in his own ears.
Cas just stared back, his eyebrow raising in cool acknowledgement.
Dean couldn’t deny him a taste of normal, no matter how much they had grappled with the truth that ‘normal’ would never apply to them. They might never lose the scars inflicted upon them by blades or trauma, but they could appreciate the time they had now.
“Open your eyes.”
“Sammy,” Dean didn’t look up from his computer, “Yeah!”
Dean was about to vocalize as much when Cas read his furrowed brows and hunched shoulders exactly for what they represented.
“What is the purpose of that expression?”
Cas’ eyes were two stars in the sky as he stood up in front of Dean.
More than that, he could see that Cas was feeling exactly the same way. His eyes were dark, stormy blue. His cheeks were pink with an endearing blush and his lips were sweet red wine. His high, unsteady breathing in Dean’s ear as they separated for air turned the heat up to an inferno. Attraction wasn’t new to Dean, but he had never
Dean knew that he had a drinking problem. He knew that he didn’t want to have a drinking problem anymore. He also knew that he didn’t have many places or people to turn to instead, especially when one of the people he
“Cas,” his voice was rough to his own ears, “uh, you alright there?”
“Wait, what?”
“Dean, I don’t read minds. What is your confusion?”
“I’m sorry Dean. I didn’t mean to frighten you at all,” and that smile was back, full force, “I appreciate you carving my name into the table. You and Sam and Jack are my only family, so uh, it’s very fitting.”
Dean was pretty sure he’d never be able to speak again.
“I know.” Dean said in a resigned voice.
Suddenly, Cas was pulled into another hard kiss. Just for a moment, though. Dean pulled back again before Cas could think to reciprocate. They were only millimeters apart this time, and Cas’ fears were assuaged by Dean’s gaze wandering back to his mouth over and over again.
“Dean, are you good man?”
A comfortable silence descended over the pair. After a few minutes lost to his own elation, Dean pulled the whiskey bottle and his empty glass towards himself, but stopped mid-pour and caught Castiel’s eye.
Cas looked reluctant to respond.
“And Dean has died more times than I suspect either of you could count. I know that’s where you two are taking this conversation, right?”
Dean closed his eyes as the hand withdrew, and a part of him hadn’t minded the special cruelty of the touch so long as he had the contact.
understand? I want you to make the most of what this sad, doomed little world gives you, and I want you to fight for every year you’ve already earned tenfold. You may have saved the world for other people, Dean, but you deserve to find your place in it too.”
It, he- the thing who looked like Cas produced the angel blade from its place in Cas’ sleeve, slid it across the floor, and dutifully held its wrists out to Dean, who had crossed the room in a few brisk strides. He swallowed his hope like sacramental wine and pulled a flask of holy water out of his jacket, unceremoniously yanking one hand toward him with shaking fingers and upending the contents on the palm. Now that Dean was up close, he registered that it had also very obviously been crying. Dean barely restrained himself from flinching as the memories of their last goodbye came rushing back unbidden. When there came no steam or black demon smoke, Dean pulled out a silver knife and began to urgently carry on with the rest of the tests.
“No, I’d say there were pretty big differences there.”
“What do you need her for?” Dean knew that Sam was aware that he had won. But any older brother worth his salt wouldn’t give in without some nitpicking.
Despite his obvious chagrin, Cas responded, “Five.”
Until it wasn’t only him.
Cas’ face was wrought with emotion.
“Dean, can I please borrow Baby tonight? I promise I won’t let anything happen to it-,”
Dean shook his head.
And Dean opened his eyes. He couldn’t deny that voice a single thing, even if he would surely be made to see the glint of the angel blade as it struck him. It didn’t matter. He would just look at Cas and pretend the sorrow and love in his eyes was real.
“Dean-,” and that voice was almost too much for him. Castiel, no, whatever that thing was started to move towards him.
Cas’ irritation and confusion had transformed into pride. Dean loved that he could see it up close.
Castiel landed with his legs slung over Dean’s right knee and his back against the left armrest. His arm wrapped haphazardly around Dean’s neck, and his other hand found his bicep. Dean held Castiel as he bent down to resume their activities.
As it turned out, everything was just that. Everything was not Cas’ charred wings and fading grace, the physical manifestations of just how far he’d fallen, was falling, and would still fall for the Winchesters. For Dean.
Sam huffed and persisted, “Dean, I won’t let anything happen to your car.”
Valentine’s Day 2021
he had to try.
“But-,”
“She’s a good one.” Dean meant it. Something had always bothered him about settling down with someone who didn’t understand the life.
“Alright. Back to square one here, Cas,” Dean unburied his face from his hands, “No, we weren’t together before this-,”
“Still-,”
But then you rebelled for me, and you got angry when I pushed the right buttons, and you were so damn sad and lonely, and I couldn’t help but relate. And that’s what best friends are, Cas. But I never treated you like that, you know? I ribbed you for things you had no way of understanding at the time. I chose Sam over you. You
Cas’ hands gripped his shoulders, and Dean felt the spark of a memory at the touch. Their eyes met. Dean hadn’t registered that Cas had spun his chair around so that Dean no longer faced the table.

Cas huffed a laugh, “I do.”

“That convince you?”

Inexorable: ceaseless, inevitable, unable to be halted. Time, life, death.
Dean was unraveling in his chair. Every sense was narrowed in on the angel in his lap. He could smell the familiar fabric of the trench coat and the otherworldly scent of Cas, burlap and ozone and wildflowers. His blood buzzed where his body met Cas’, and Dean could feel fire in every one of his veins. He tasted cinnamon and honey and

to me, like it or not.”
He had loved Lisa and Ben Braeden, but there had always been a part of him that had never left the fight in that wonderful, terrible year. Little habits and idiosyncrasies left over from the hunting life he thought he could leave behind, locked windows and hand carved sigils, falling fast asleep in his clothes… all reminders of the life. Of Sam. So he was glad beyond belief that his brother had found Eileen. Glad that she could take care of herself. Glad that if the unthinkable happened, history would not repeat itself.
Edit: I apologize for any grammar mistakes. The only excuse my English nerd  ass has is that I did the majority of these chapters late at night and get far too excited to post.
Sam, bless him, simply nodded his acceptance without another word. Dean blew out a breath of air before turning back to his laptop. Sam meant well, but sometimes he could be a little overbearing on the emotional front. Dean wasn’t an idiot; Sam had been watching him like a hawk since they’d lost Cas, a needle in an arm and a breath away from oblivion probably at the forefront of his mind. It was clockwork; dependable, awful, predictable motion. Dean Winchester was on suicide watch.
Whatever it was didn’t take another step forward, which Dean thought was a smart decision on its part. It would be killed either way, but if it made for Dean one more time, he’d make sure the thing that looked like his best friend felt every ounce of bottled rage and pain from the past few months.
Dean ran a finger along the jagged edges and grainy curves of the scratches, his throat closed around the memory of his grief.
“Cas, you didn’t even-,”
“Dean, I don’t need to tell you how unhealthy it is to drink as much as you do when you’re hurting.”
“Cas, how many times have you died, man?” Sam squinted at the angel, who looked none too pleased to be a part of this morbid discussion. Dean guessed that for the angel who had given up everything to save him and Sam, hearing them discuss death so flippantly had to be irritating. But that was par for the course. People die, angels fall, life goes on.
Now every inch of Dean was soaked through with rain, but he wouldn’t leave the downpour if it threatened to wash him away like that little spider in the nursery rhyme. The stars were hardly visible now for the thick clouds gathering above Dean, except in a little cluster to the east. Lightning flashed around him, and wind whistled all violent through the trees. Still, Dean lifted his eyes through the blur of his own tears and tried to find Castiel in the raging storm around him.
The conversation turned reminiscent, as it usually did with the Winchesters. A few fingers of whiskey melted residual ice, and a flood of memories came pouring out before they knew it. This was as close to therapy as they could get.
“Dean,” the angel continued despite Dean having buried his face in his hands, “for all intents and purposes, we were basically together.”
Cas closed his mouth into a thin line, but nodded for Dean to continue.
“I didn’t realize. I thought sex was just sex to you.”
“Fuck, you drive me crazy.”
“It’s like that. I’m afraid that when we sleep together, I won’t be able to say what I need to say. I’m afraid of not being able to continue with...with everything we’ve talked about, because I’ll get distracted. It’ll be a new excuse for me. A new way to hide how I’m feeling.”
off. He hoped Cas knew it wasn’t personal. The angel had always believed in Dean, even when Dean didn’t believe in either of them. Dean had realized something alone in that dungeon, the hardest farewell still echoing silently off the walls of a bereft room, that Cas’ faith in him wasn’t forced. It wasn’t manufactured for his benefit. It wasn’t a delusional byproduct of love. It wasn’t Heaven’s highest order to love what should not be loved. Lucifer and Michael were proof enough of this. The glorious, hideous truth was that
“Dean, did I do something wrong?”
Castiel had been the definition of a trouble magnet. Dean remembered a night gone by long ago, one of the rare times he and Sam and Cas weren’t at odds or six feet under. They had been laughing all night, probably celebrating a successful hunt or one day without the world ending. Cas was his usual endearing self, all head-tilts and bemusement at Dean’s side. Because he had never wanted to be anywhere else, right?
I’m still so grateful for y’all who have left kudos and comments. Your appreciation makes me happy! This is my first ever finished fic on ao3, as Back to the Start is still in progress and I have about five other projects that are significantly bigger.
want to corrupt you, an actual fucking angel. At first it was revenge. I thought,
“Cas-,”
But a strange thing had happened at that table, back when he still had his best friend. Cas had looked
“Look, try to think of it this way: I’ve been alive for billions of years, Dean. I was witness to the dawn of humanity. I was witness to Original Sin. I watched your species learn and grow and stumble and stand up, because giving up wasn’t an option. I saw things you can’t even comprehend, but you know what?”
Dean wondered if Cas would expand on that, but instead he had knocked back his finger of whiskey and risen to his feet abruptly.
Dean didn’t know. He didn’t want to find out. All he wanted to do was curl up with a bottle of whiskey and watch some stupid baking show on Netflix until he passed out. Dean supposed Cas would have wanted him to live his life; put down the bottle and be himself again. Dean supposed Cas thought he had been worth less to Dean than he was; expendable, an obstacle, worth his powers and nothing more. Dean supposed, despite what Castiel had tried so hard to impress upon him for twelve years, that he had failed where it had truly counted. And now-
He laughed quietly, and the sound snapped Dean Winchester to attention. As a sob wrenched out of his throat, he was launching himself at Castiel. His arms wrapped tight around his best friend, and he buried his face into Cas’ shoulder. He wasn’t conscious of his hands where they were bunched in the fabric of that goddamned trench coat. This embrace wasn’t gentle; it was fierce, clinging, and desperate. It was as if Dean was trying to adhere them together. As if he was telling him to stay, stay with me and never fucking leave again.
“Yes.”
“Yeah?”
do this. He could pull Cas in and taste the honey on his lips and draw gasps from him like the echoes in an art museum. Dean couldn’t give Castiel the sunrise, but he could promise that he’d be wrapped around him every morning. Somehow he didn’t think Cas minded.
Dean could only nod at this, unable to process what Cas had just reiterated. He was feeling the hours ahead of the two of them like a bullet to the brain right about then.
Sam schooled his triumph long enough to answer, “I’d like to take Eileen on a date for Valentine’s Day.”
He licked his lips, and he hardly noticed how close their faces were because he was too busy wanting their faces to be
“But,” Cas continued, “I understand why you turn to alcohol. I’m not giving you a pass, Dean. I’m just acknowledging that your upbringing hasn’t left room for orthodox coping mechanisms.”
One fact remained, a lingering presence in the bunker halls, swirling like clouds above their heads. One fact remained, the objective truth of that day in February: Dean Winchester was alone on Valentine’s Day. Dean Winchester had no one to celebrate with. Dean Winchester had had plenty of lonely Valentine’s Days, but a warm body next to him ensured that, at the very least, he wasn’t truly alone. This year, the thought of a meaningless fling at a meaningless bar when he himself felt meaningless was enough to fill him with disgust. Dean knew the root of his problem, as it was planted deep in every cell of his being: grief, ugly and serrated like a particularly wicked knife.
Until lightning cast the clearing into sharp relief for a moment, and suddenly he was right there.
“Yes, I’d say.”
“But why?”
“Oh yeah? And what’s that?”
Dean hadn't expected that. Or maybe he had.
And really, how could he have tried? He could never forget his mom, how she had been both everything he loved and hated. How he had seen himself in Mary and had a chance to free the burden of resentment from his heart.
Suddenly, Dean was transported back to that fucking barn in Illinois. No sparks were flying now, but it sure as hell felt like it. In fact, it felt like the whole bunker was catching fire.
“None of it compares to you, Dean. The inevitability of a sunrise is trivial to me because I’ve seen you stand up on broken limbs and refuse to die even when you craved nothing more. Savannahs and oceans and jungles have been designed before my eyes, but I find the richest green color in yours. You can tell me to leave and push me away, break my nose with your fist, shelter your heart with barbed insults and stone walls, and act like you’re less than you are to everyone else. You can hate yourself for your mistakes, but if I have taught you one lesson in the twelve years I’ve known you, it’s that no one is incapable of redemption.”
anything when we sleep together. I’m going to make sure of it, Castiel.”
“Dean!”
“Why would you want to know that?”
Dean felt all his breath sinking like an anchor, pressure building until he thought to release it.
“Thank you, Dean. I want everything with you, but I think we need to talk first.”
The thing who looked like Castiel halted in its tracks and eyed the gun, and then its eyes moved to Dean’s right hip. Dean wondered if it somehow knew exactly which weapon he was carrying there. Interesting, Dean thought, it’s scared of angel blades.
Dean breathed in sharply, followed by a shake of his head. Ever since Cas’ sacrifice, Dean had been conscious of a rattling in his skull; trapped words in a socially-constructed bottleneck, their only exodus a whiskey-soaked prayer to an angel’s forever-deaf ears. This, Dean reminded himself, is a slippery damned slope. I’m on the ledge as is, and thinking about what could have been will drive me over. Despite Dean’s sorrow over Cas, and despite the perpetual tug of self-blame at his heart, he knew that he had to at least try. He had to go through the motions of happiness until he started to believe it, no matter the breadth of the void inside of him. He owed Cas that much.
“How many times do you think we’ve died?” Sam knocked back a shot, inhibitions long gone.
So it fucked Dean up every time he thought about it. He couldn’t fathom why Castiel loved him. He knew why Cas said he did, but it didn’t make him believe it any more. But the alternative was that there was something wrong with Cas, some sparking wire or loose bolt. And that was unacceptable, so Dean carried on and tried to be who Cas thought he was. He sipped his beer and tracked a shooting star as it fell.
He tasted sweet, and his lips were pleasantly warm. Somewhere along the line, their close-mouthed kisses had become more amorous.
A breath. Then another.
Castiel gasped a little. The angel seemed very much aware of Dean’s train of thought. Dean saw how his eyes darkened considerably, flicking up and down Dean’s face as the distance closed painfully slow. It was, Dean thought, pretty clear that Cas was on board. So he was a little confused when Castiel leaned out of the way minutely.
Dean learns how Cas came back. They make a promise. The author can’t stop making gratuitous space metaphors.
“What’s got you down, sunshine?”
And Dean forgot to remind Cas that he had been the one to pull away just fifteen minutes before, because all he could feel was Cas’ lips on his own now. Castiel moved his mouth against Dean’s softly, a contrast with his strong hands threading through Dean’s hair. Dean kissed him back, and though he had said what he needed to say before, he tried to communicate the words he had failed to bring to mind with his body. His fingers gripping Cas’ coat a steady “
Dean could admit that the night was perfect. The stars were sharp and the moon was bright, the light knifing through the sparse clouds. It was pleasantly cool outside for a change, bringing sweet relief from the blazing summer afternoon. In the West, a wall of gray clouds was mounting an offense miles above and away. Dean knew fall was approaching, and with it, more time spent in the bunker with all the ghosts he was currently escaping.
“Yeah, Cas. Lemme guess, three words? Took me the hell out until...well, to be honest, I still haven’t recovered.”
Castiel was silent where he sat. Dean expected to see a pensive or sad expression when he looked up, but he was not prepared for the
At this, Cas smiled inexplicably. “I will tell you until you get it into that stubborn Winchester head of yours that I know you and I love you with all your virtues and vices.”
“-to her.” Sam squinted at Dean, who lifted an eyebrow.
“What?”
They disentangled from each other after long minutes that could have been years for all they knew, but they did not dare move far. Dean felt the best kind of paralyzed at that moment, arrested in the focus of blue eyes. On their faces were twin smiles. Dean couldn’t remember a happier day in his life.
And. Nothing. Happened.
Dean couldn’t determine what emotion was taking shape on Cas’ face right then, but he thought it must be good.
They both knew there would be more. Dean had seen the dried tears on Castiel’s face, and he had a sneaking suspicion that his own thoughts had been a little too loud. Dean wanted to know why Cas was back. They needed to figure out where they stood. There were so many doors that needed to be closed, and years and miles between them to be examined before they took this where Dean knew he wanted it to go. But they had time now. They had time because Castiel came back.
“Can I borrow the car?”
“That being said,” Cas took a deep breath, attempting to tamper down the open affection in his eyes for one minute, “I’m upset because of how you behave whenever I’m gone.”
“It’s not that I don’t want to kiss you-,”
The thing smiled wryly, “I don’t doubt you. But forgive me if I’m breaking any rules here, seeing as you’re pointing a gun loaded with angel-killing bullets at my head.”
Perfect as the night was, it was missing something. Dean knew that this had always been a dangerous path to go down. He had once told Cas,- and god did
“I didn’t say that. You did.”
“Try again, Sam.”
“No.” Dean had hardly let Sam finish his request before answering.
“I’m not talking about sex, Dean.”
To Dean’s left, Cas’ head tilted in a gesture familiar as the legos in the Impala’s air con unit.
“I’ve never been the best to you, Cas. If I wanted to go down that rabbit hole, it would take all friggin day. I’m afraid, -really, truly afraid-, that I’ve ruined you. I know we’ve always had something different. We’ve always….we’ve always been something different. I never examined it under a microscope because I was afraid I’d find something I didn’t like. But my role in our bond is not a good one, I think. I’ve taught you more about self-loathing and unhealthy tendencies than I ever wanted to. But the worst part is that I actually
Sammy turned on his heel after another moment and retreated the way he had come in, seemingly assured of Dean’s emotional stability for the night. And then Dean was alone with his thoughts.
Castiel drew the blade across his skin.
“I love you, Castiel. I’m in love with you.”
“Dean.”
But, but, but, despite knowing that they both wanted it in the moment. Despite
“Better together, right?”
Sam strolled into the library with a purposeful gait, and Dean caught a flash of silver in his brother’s fist.
“Cas, I stopped because I love you, and I don’t want us to rush into this. I’ve had so many hookups, man. There are so many nights and faces I can’t remember, and only a handful of women that I can remember because I cared for them and they cared for me. Y’know, I almost didn’t stop a minute ago.”
The oak trees lent whistles and soft whispers to the otherwise still air around him. Dean leaned back on Baby, driven to his elbows by exhaustion of the highest caliber. Though he had tried to avoid looking up at the night sky for reasons all his own, his eyes found their way to the heavens anyways.
“I hope I’m making myself perfectly clear. If nothing else, know that I mean what I’m about to say.”
“Dean, no. Stop blaming yourself for that.”
let me say what I need to say because I can see you opening your goddamn mouth over there.”
Dean, too far down the rabbit hole, did not notice that Sam was still in the library.
“Castiel, please shut up for a minute.”
A pregnant silence fell between them.
bottles if I’m correct.” And boy was he right.
“Forgive me if I’m overstepping,” Cas persisted, seemingly unaware that he was taking scissors to the last strings of Dean’s sanity, “but I want that too. Sex, I mean. Everything, so long as you want it too.”
“I’d like that.”
Cas breathed a sigh of relief, but he still looked vaguely unconvinced. Dean couldn’t let
“Cas, c’mon. We have a lot to dish out before we get to the fun stuff here, so why not start with whatever it is you’re upset about? And don’t tell me you ain’t upset.” Dean pleaded with Cas.
Dean watched Sam gauge his face, his posture, and the empty glass in his hand. He was too good at reading Dean.
“Ca- please,” Dean clenched his fists where they rested in the upturned palms of an angel, “please. If this isn’t you, pick up that angel blade and kill me. I can’t go through this again.”
“I still don’t understand.”
“Believe me,” Dean lowered his voice and tilted his face towards Cas until their lips were barely an inch apart. He watched Cas’ smile slip and his eyes darken once more. “It won’t be
Chapter 1: The Act of Falling
“And how exactly do I behave, Castiel?”
“You’re too important to me, alright? I want you more than I’ve ever wanted anyone in the history of like, forever. But we need to get this all out, because I’m not losing you because of my stupidity ever again.”
break up with you.”
Sam chuckled, “believe me, I know. You’ll kill me.”
“First of all, yeah you fucking do. Second of all, you just said that you purposefully implied that we were a
for me, and I was never there when you needed me. And then I blamed you when you betrayed me and Sam, even though it was really on me for showing you the worst parts of humanity and failing to teach you the good.”
“No! No,” Dean’s hazy eyes widened, “trust me, Castiel, you did everything right. Maybe a little too good, actually.”
Fall: To fall, falling, the act of descending. Icarus, autumn leaves in dusky red, Lucifer, clumsy children at play, shooting stars, love, seasons, the Angel of Thursday
“No, please. Just, please.”
“I know.”
Finally, Dean huffed a long sigh.
. Problem was, he wasn’t sure what. He was certain it involved the angel, lost forever to the Void with a capital V. Nothingness. The Empty. Dean laughed, a small, bitter sound. He was feeling a lot of things right about now, but “empty” wasn’t it.
Castiel rarely resembled the warrior he once was anymore. Dean and Sam and all their enemies often forgot who the unassuming angel in the ragged Wall Street getup really was. He was easy to underestimate with his honest nature and awkward smile and stupid pop aliases and love of humanity.
“Cas, just-,” Dean yanked his hands through his short hair, “just wait a second, okay?”
Cas must have seen the realization all over Dean’s face, because he dropped from a crouch to his knees with a relieved smile.
“Dean,” Cas said.
There was a pause in which Dean had a decision to make. For twelve years, only two people had known the words Cas had said to Dean on the night they’d met. Whatever this was knew that those words would tear through Dean like the ringing of a bell. Suddenly, there was only one thing to do.
. Cas, I- I don’t know how to apologize. And I know you don’t always understand the nuances of stuff, but no decent person treats anyone like that. Much less their partner. I just- why are you laughing?” Dean stared in befuddlement at Cas, whose chuckle was a low rumble in his chest. If Dean wasn’t so damn lost he’d probably be melting a little.
Cas’ voice was rough and low.
Cas glared at Dean, and he wasn’t surprised to find that he’d missed that too.
“Jesus, Cas.”
“So,” Dean rose to his feet slowly, his joints reminding him of his age, “let’s talk about it.”
Dean swallowed down his thoughts with the last of his whiskey. “Yeah, just thinkin’”
“Cas?”
“What is it?” Dean tracked Cas’ line of sight to the library table, and he couldn’t fight a small, sad smile when he saw that Cas had been stopped in his tracks by the names carved in the wood.
How could Dean celebrate a holiday all about love? How could he watch the exchange of candy hearts and paper mache and round teddy bears, the tipsy rush of affection mistaken for true devotion among every fledgling couple at every restaurant in every town? How could he witness the cheap interpretation of love when love had killed his best friend?
Dean supposed he should be ashamed of the tears on his face. Surely his red eyes were a sign of weakness. But he didn’t give a damn. “Shut the hell up.”
Dean frowned in contemplation. “What, altogether? Or are you talking about deaths per person?”
“We’ll figure it out together, Cas. The important thing is that you’re really here. God, I just-, I can’t believe you’re back. Seems too good to be true, y’know?”
“Put,” Dean stammered, “put out your hands. If it’s you, if it’s Castiel, give me the angel blade first.”
“Excuse me?” Dean cocked the gun.
ever since he’d pulled him from his apartment in Palo Alto, a silhouette wreathed in flames reflected in his terrified eyes. Survival means nothing without something to live for, and Dean knew he wasn’t Sam’s answer. Hell had proved that. Purgatory had proved that. He didn’t blame him, but he sure as hell blamed himself.
“Why don’t we share the bed?” his voice seems deeper, but it could also just be tiredness. It always made Dean’s voice unbelievable deep, raspy and of course, sexy.
“Dean, it’s me.” Cas tries but Dean nearly punshes him which irritates Cas for a brief moment. “Stop it, Dean, please.” Cas tries to finally grab Dean’s wrists to stop him from punching him but he realizes too late that it’s his left one, where the wound is, which is not completely healed and it just seems to make Dean’s panic rise.
“I’m sorry about the mirror.”, “It’s alright, I’ve been thinking about getting a new one anyway.”, “Don’t just say this to make me feel better.” Dean mumbles but Cas shakes his head a little. “I’m not. C’mon Dean, that thing was ugly.” the Winchester actually laughs at that and the sound warms Cas’ heart. “Good. Wanna get back to bed?”, “Sure, but let me get that glass outta your hand first.” Dean nods and the Novak gets up to get the tweezers and a flashlight so he will actually be able to see what he’s doing.
He feels happy for his little brother and he always wished that he’d find someone he’s happy with. But after everything that happened the past years Dean never thought about experiencing this.
“Don’t” Sam pushes Cas back when he tries to go after Dean. “Give him some time.” Sam knows too well that Dean needs a few minutes on his own especially after spending days around many people.
He looks up and lets the few raindrops the clouds are still spilling drop onto his face, mixing with his tears and cooling his hot and reddened cheeks.
“He fell asleep. And the nurse told me to get some fresh air and look after you. She was right you’re really not looking good.” “I’m alright Sam, I’m not the one we should worry about at the moment.” “Cas. I know this shit affects you, like a lot. And I know you need someone to listen sometimes. And I know that it’s usually Dean who listens but since he can’t right now I’m here.” Cas nods a little and is about to say something when Sam interrupts. “Don’t treat me like a kid. I know I’m not an official grown up, but with that asshole of a dad I think I’m more grown up than some twenty year old.” Cas just nods again.
“Alright. We aren’t together anymore Dean, I can’t forbid you to meet other men.” he tries to let his voice stay calm and not break but it’s more difficult than he thought.
They then put the record back into the box with the others before getting into the Impala and Cas starts the motor. “Ready?” he asks with a smile on his lips and looks at the Winchester, who nods and squeezes Cas’ hand for a brief moment. They head off for the five hour drive Castiel planned to stay at a hotel for the first night. “I planned to drive five or six hours every day. We would arrive in Manhattan on Christmas Eve." Cas says after an hour of them listening to music and silently staring out the windshield. “Sounds like a plan.” Dean mumbles and Cas nods.
“Sammy please, they can’t catch you. Not you.” Dean whispers and is somewhere between clinging onto Sam and pushing his brother away.
But all this does not make him miss Cas less. It maybe makes him miss the Novak a little more since those could’ve been a ton of good memories for both of them.
“I’m good. Nothing to worry. Had some bad day but I feel fine, really. Can I go now?” “No, Dean. You’ll be here for another two nights. You are under seventy-two hour suicide watch.”
But he just wakes up to an empty bed in the morning.
“I think I have glass in my hands.” Dean chuckles a little and Cas smiles at that. “Let me get some tweezers and I’ll get it out. “No, just stay. It’s not that bad.”, “Dean-”, “Please.” Cas nods and sits back down.
“Chuck Shurley?” a man picks up and Dean forgets how to talk for a second. “Hello?” his voice breaks and he feels his cheeks heating up with embarrassment. “I’m Dean Winchester, my Doc gave me your number and I decided to call, obviously.”, “Hello, Dean. What can I do for you?” the question kind of throws him off. ‘Why is this so damn hard?’ “I wanted to make an appointment with you. Do you wanna know all that stuff over the phone?”, “No, of course not. Lets just make a first appointment and see where we’ll go from there. Does that sound good to you?” Dean stays silent, about to hang up, not sure if he really wants to take that step but he kinda owes it to Sam and Cas. “Dean?” Chuck asks and the Winchester snaps back to reality. “Yeah, sounds good.”, “Alright. I actually have a free appointment in two weeks. It’s on a Monday at three. Is that alright? The next one would be in two months.” Dean doesn’t have anything to do on Mondays at three but he still thinks about taking one in two months. He really doesn’t want to talk to some stranger about his life. “No, the Monday works just fine.” he rasps out and he can hear Chuck write down something. “Alright. I’ll text you my adress if that is alright with you.”, “Sure.”, “Good, see you in two weeks Dean.” “Bye.”
All of this was just tearing at his mental health. He never was the healthiest guy on the planet but he never really had problems with anything, not even his mental health. Which was something he learned to praise throughout the years. He watched a lot of his old classmates fall into the deep dark of depression, he watched Dean slip into major depression. He was and is still glad that he didn’t. Glad that he is somewhat able to help Dean. Until now.
“Hey Dean, please talk to me.” Sam slowly sits onto the bed not wanting to scare his older brother. Dean suddenly sits up and smiles a little but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
He isn’t sure if it actually was this thought making him drop to the floor or all the thoughts that came rushing in after, not that it matters.
“He’ll get better we just give him the time he needs.” Jess whispers and Cas sighs. He hears that all over again right now and still nothing seems to get better. It just got worse.
Dean buries his face in the crotch between Cas neck and shoulder and they keep their arms wrapped around each other not wanting to ever let the other go.
“The nice nurse told me that she knows someone who could help you to get rid of the pain.” Dean really needs someone who can actually help him and Cas is afraid that he can’t.
They wake up to the phone ringing on the nightstand next to the bed and Cas turns around to grab it. “Hello?” his voice is tired, it’s nine in the morning but they stayed up until three the last night. “I’m sorry for waking you up. It’ misses Forester again and I wanted to tell you that the funeral will be in Washington, DC.” “Yeah, thank you, I’ll ask Dean later. “How is he anyway?” Mrs. Forester asks with worry showing in her voice. “It was difficult, but it’s getting better.” he whispers before both of them hang up and Cas turns around only to green eyes staring at him. Dean moves closer and buries his head against Cas’ chest. “Cas, who was it?” he whispers, still tired and not planning to get out of bed any time soon. ”It was Mrs. Forester. She just told me the location of the funeral.” Cas whispers, praying that this won’t destroy the progress of Dean’s recovery.
I finally managed to write Chapter 2 after months. I had a lot to do so I didn't manage to just sit back and write until now.
Cas wakes up staring into green eyes and he starts smiling immediately. “Merry Christmas, Cas.” Dean says softly and leans forward to kiss Cas. “Merry Christmas, Dean.” Cas whispers into the kiss and they move closer together.
Cas chuckles and looks up at Dean’s headstone with a sad smile.
“There’s- there’s so much I wish I would’ve told you. There’s so much I wish I wouldn’t have done. I- I always loved you Dean. There was never a second that I didn’t. Never. And I’m sorry that I didn’t call in those months. I’m so sorry Dean. I love you and I hope that where ever you might be now, I hope that you know that. I really hope that you can somehow hear me right now.”
Cas sighs and looks at Dean’s peaceful looking face. “I love you.” He whispers before he slowly falls asleep too.
Cas steps out of the shower and puts on some clothes for the night before he looks at some pictures of Dean and him from their trip to Manhattan, a ritual he did the past years. He doesn’t know why he’s doing it right now so he just stares at them. Manhattan. That’s where they could go for Christmas. Cas starts to smile and puts the photos back onto the nightstand.
Cas gets up and Dean just pulls him against him and presses his lips onto Cas’ who fast regains himself and kisses the Winchester back.
“He can help you dealing with your problems-” “What fucking problems Cas?” Dean stands up and the Novak flinches at the sudden movement. “The problem that I wanna fucking kill myself or what? Or the problem that I’m worth shit? Or maybe the problem that my Dad turned into an abusive bastard? He can’t help me with that. He can’t! Why can’t you just fucking accept it?” Dean yells and just storms back into the bathroom shutting the door loudly and locking it right away, leaving Castiel seemingly frozen on the sofa.
He tried to not think too much about Sam and Jess during the war, he dared not to think about ever kissing Cas again, never thought he would be able to celebrate another Christmas, he never though he would survive any of it.
Even after the fireworks finished both stay silent, not wanting the peaceful moment to end so they just keep staring at the golden glowing city.
As soon as the Novak lets go Dean crawls backwards against the sink not caring about the shards of glass cutting into his bare hands.
"SAMMY, call the ambulance, now!" Jess yells in a high pitched voice and Sam doens't think twice to grab the phone.
“Dean, hey!” he looks up and sees Garth waving at him while sitting down next to Dean, a huge lunch box with some kind of pasta in one hand and a soda in the other.
“Dean, you telling me that you don’t think you deserve to live is definitely something to talk about.” Cas whispers after some time and looks up when Dean doesn’t answer. He just sits there, staring at Cas, no emotion in his eyes, just staring at Cas and still kind of through him.
“Perfect, gonna let you sleep then.” he moves over to a cheap plastic chair and is about to sit down when Dean speaks up again.
"Dean?" Cas asks again, fearing the worst but Dean smirks a little. "Man don't even think that I tried to off myself, can't let your cute little ass alone, huh?" Cas grins a little too but doesn't really believe the Winchester though he at least doesn't think it out loud and flinches a little when the doorbell rings and Sam jumps up. "I got it!" He opens the door and leads the ambulance inside.
“Cas, I- I’m sorry.” Dean suddenly whispers and Cas looks at him, confused. “For what?” he whispers back. “For not being able to actually work it through with you. You know how much I love you and you know that you and Sam are the only people I trust enough to talk with about what happened, but still I can’t do it in a way I’d like to.” Dean whispers, his forehead resting against Cas’.
