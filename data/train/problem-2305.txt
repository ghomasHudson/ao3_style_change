Holmes had been nodding diligently this whole time and Watson knew only he could see the thinly veiled disgust beneath his earnest expression. He supposed he appeared much the same. Nonetheless Watson knew the expectations, and he looked away from Holmes so that he might keep his head about him.
“So?” Watson said, gesturing. He gripped his cane and turned away from Holmes for something to do. “What conclusions have you drawn thus far?”
Watson sniffed, satisfied for now. The floorboards beneath his bed creaked, and he thought that his chastising had landed somewhere of importance by how Holmes had not immediately resumed his playing. Watson thought sleepily of the days when he was not awoken by a tortured violin, or the flames of an experiment gone awry, or smoky hazardous gas from an experiment gone to plan. The dark smudges beneath his eyes may be ingrained now, but he couldn’t even pretend to want those mundane times back.
Watson regarded his friend sceptically. “And you deduced all this from the scents in the air?”
It was ill-mannered and uncouth, he knew; a child’s life may be at stake, or a mother’s sanity, but suffering momentary lapse in all of his civil practices was a strange phenomenon that sometimes occurred around Holmes. These sorts of things, Watson had decided some period ago, were writ in blood, simply waiting for a catalyst to spur them to life; cats made the good doctor sneeze, and Sherlock Holmes, on occasion, disarmed his every instinct and struck him utterly dumb.
Watson steadied himself with weary resignation for Holmes’s rant about the surety of loss, about how the defining facet of all existence and the singular fact upon which one could always rely was that everything can, has, and indeed will, fall apart.
Watson had been sharing a look with Holmes, as he sometimes did during cases, the detective attempting to relinquish preternaturally divined information through the capturing obsidian of his eyes and Watson attempting to collate it, and suddenly he realised he was required to answer. He nodded immediately, said, “Absolutely, my Lord, displaying all of the symptoms. It’s perfectly normal, I assure you.”
There was a mother and a father and extras, and there was a missing child. Stolen, vanished, and Holmes’s skin was already humming with the chase.
infatuation with
“Holmes,” Watson spat, his eyes scrunching closed despite his best attempts to keep his gaze on the detective. The one thing in the world Watson wanted more than what was currently happening was to see Holmes’s smug composure fall apart. “If- if you begin listing synonyms I am a-afraid I might have to subdue and gag you, old boy.”
Holmes was not one prone to compliments. Watson felt heat on his cheeks and neck.
this far; now that it’s here, he has no clue what to do.

On went the night.
“Pray tell, Watson. Where lays motivation for such a humble man?”

saved a man’s life, nonetheless. Damn good work, I say.”
“We wish to help you, very much. Where does your husband work?”
The detective’s voice rapidly increased in pitch on Watson’s throat, until he shouted, just once, sharp line of his teeth on Watson’s shoulder as Holmes pushed upward and finised. Holmes held their bodies tightly together, rocking through the pleasure, through the electric aftershocks, moving gently until the men were near the end of their panting.
“Paganini,” he said conversationally, “is not infernal and incidentally, I play the piece precisely how it was written.”
Mrs Andrews was retrieving more ingredients when Holmes returned from reburying the girl’s bones in a scraped out grave near her original tomb, and his forearms were black with soot and dirt where he’d pushed his white sleeves into bunches at the elbow. Watson was having a disconcertingly difficult time paying attention to the sick man in front of him.
“Antiseptic,” Watson said before Holmes could complain, and then he produced a cloth from his medical kit and began wiping away the dirt from Holmes’s injuries. He held one of Holmes’s hands in both of his, the detective’s fingers warm and calloused harshly. Watson swallowed.
“We have a case.”
, Watson thought inanely,
Lady Luxemburg was beside herself not with grief, but rather with matters of status.
“John,” Sherlock says quietly, resting both hands on the bench in front of him. He’s taken his coat off at some point, left only in his dark suit pants and white shirt. John can only think about that for a moment before he steps abruptly into Sherlock’s space and looks up to meet his gaze.
“That, and the good heart of a man who wields it without incentive.” Holmes blinked at him, luminescent in the lamplight, a dull golden halo around his shadowy form.
?” she implored. “What will the other Lords say? Oh, dear, we must send word to our friends at once! Edmund, darling, we must prevent this occurrence from slandering our family name in the future, please do assist me!”
Things felt heavy – everything was heavy. There was too much in the air to deal with at times, the shocking weight of the insane nightmare they’d just gone through. The bruising chain-cuts around John’s ankle caused him to limp as though he actually needed his cane and Sherlock was incredibly watchful. Rosie kept crying because her mother was gone and her father kept leaving her, why did he keep doing that?
“Come now, old boy!” He waved his hand, flicked his wrist elegantly at Watson’s curtain and a shard of hazed light illuminated the room. It fell across Watson’s bed and the doctor turned his face away. “The morn is nearly upon us – the sun certainly is – and who are we to deny nature’s timely clock?”
John doesn’t actually know the state of Sherlock’s feelings for him, only his own, which in this case is actually an advantage. Whatever Sherlock is willing to give, John is willing to take.
“You, you,” Mrs Andrews breathed, “You ain’t going to tell me Lady and Lord? Sir, it’s a
Holmes strode toward Watson and took his friend’s coat into his hands, snapped it shortly into place. He smoothed down the doctor’s shirt, too. “It has been said, dear man, that what a spot of brandy cannot cure has already been cured. So, if all else fails-”
“We wouldn’t dare,” Holmes said. “And precisely how much money did you spend before resorting to grave robbing in the hopes of curing dear Colin?”
“Come on, then.” John glances up to see Sherlock smile softly. “I don’t think I’ve even seen dear Rosie’s room yet.”
She produced a handkerchief from her generous bosom and proceeded to dab her notably dry eyes before gesturing to her husband, who remained aloof. Her mystically-coloured skirts and gown-layers rippled, the visual effect vaguely nauseating.
The detective’s lips fell open hotly and Watson pushed a hand into his hair, feeling abruptly hit over the head, drugged, stupefied and like he needed an anchor. He found the base of Holmes’s skull and curled his fingers there tightly. Holmes instantly pressed forward, jealously incessant as always, his hands flat against Watson’s ribs like a brand.
Sherlock stares, blinking and processing this as he watches John’s face openly. John allows him the time he needs, not any longer than a minute, and then Sherlock nods once, dropping his hand but not moving back at all.
Sherlock breathed through his nose in an attempt to slow his breathing as John slipped his fingers in the waist of the trousers and pulled them down quickly, along with his shoes, leaving him bare and spread out on the sheets. Kneeling beside the bed John began to press soft kisses up the inside of the taller man’s thighs; making his way to where Sherlock’s cock was waiting for him. Sherlock shuddered as he felt John’s breath ghosting across his balls and making its way up his shaft. Closing his eyes, he dropped his head down on the pillow as John took the head of his cock between his lips and began to suck on it.
Greg felt his orgasm creeping closer as John gave his balls a light tug; the tension and heat coiling in his gut.
“Now listen here you freak!”
Sherlock’s attention was completely drawn away from where Patrick sat as he spotted the back of a golden haired man moving on the dance floor. Slowly he studied the man as he danced. His hair was golden blonde with a few flecks of grey here and there; late 30’s. Compactly muscled with back and arms toned and tanned. On the man’s left shoulder was an exceptionally beautiful tattoo of a clear midnight sky with stars littered all through it; an obvious depiction of a sky not in London. Sherlock continued to survey the man’s tattoos. On his right shoulder the letters “R.A.M.C” with a caduceus right below it. Military man then, the night sky undoubtedly a representation of the one where he served. The man was dressed in a tight white vest and even tighter black jeans that were tucked into his black combat boots. Sherlock felt his cock twitch in his own leather trouser constraints at the sight of the army doctor’s arse; and what a fine arse it was.
Sherlock threw his hands about his head and gripped the sheets tight as the pleasure coursed through his body as the velvety heat of John’s mouth slid up and down his erection; applying just the right amount of suction and pressure, making heavenly sensations shoot up the young man’s spine.
at that line John just grinned and shoved the consulting detective playfully.
“Since when do you help with anything? You waltz in and spout your ‘deductions’ and then you leave. Leaving the rest of us to do all the paperwork and clean up after you.” The sergeant glared at the younger man and put her hands on her hips. “ And you are telling me that you willingly came in at 10:30 at night to ‘help’ Greg with paperwork?”
The entire bar erupted into cheers and laughter at the duo’s amazing performance that could have filled Royal Albert Hall. There were big pats on the back from members of the drunk crowd as Sherlock and John made their way back to the table of their colleagues.
“Thanks for the offer ma’am, but I think I’d rather take this gorgeous arse home and suck his cock.”
Finally he settled between Sherlock’s thighs and began to nuzzle his nose into the tight leather where the younger man’s cock was desperate to get out. Smirking up at Sherlock he unbuttoned the trousers and took the zip in his teeth and drug it down slowly. His cock sprang free and stood out; ruddy and leaking.
Slowly he made his way to sit in the chair that was directly beside the hospital bed that held the frail frame of John H. Watson, lifting the ice filled rag that Molly had given him to his face to nurse the wound where Greg had struck him.
When John looked again it was with a watery smile, and Sherlock could not handle sitting any longer. In a heartbeat he was on his feet and carefully but firmly wrapped himself around the smaller man’s chest; his own heaving with emotion as tears of his own pooled in his eyes.
Sally turned to Greg at that moment with her eyebrows shooting up to her hairline. “Did you know about these two?” All the DI could do is grin from ear to ear and turn his attention back to the stage where the two of them were starting to do little movements and dances along with each other on the stage.
Greg took a long swig of his beer as he sat back in his chair in the crowded pub, glancing at his watch. He had invited Sherlock and John out to drinks with some of the yarders earlier that evening after they had wrapped up all the paperwork for the latest case they had worked. He knew John was good to show, but wasn’t holding out hope for their favorite consulting detective; seeing as he was in a stroppy mood over Greg and John agreeing to drinks instead of their usual “shag each other’s brains out” night in at 221B.
John sat with his fingers twitching on his knee as he sat beside Sherlock and stared at the younger man. “Just so you know, I don’t usually just go home with men, or women, that I just met at a club. But there is just something about you…”
“We picked this place because its happy hour and special night.”
He watched as the man swayed and shook his arse on the dance floor in time with the music with his arms in the air. The man made a turn and faced Sherlock now with his eyes closed as he moved with the music. Sherlock’s eyes continued surveying the army doctor as he danced still with his arms up, causing his vest to lift. It revealed the beginnings of what looked to two pistol tattoos on the dip of his hip bones, barrels pointing to his groin. Sherlock’s gaze followed the line of the guns to his groin; which was quite impression if his tight trousers gave any indication.
Greg shook his head and closed his eyes again as he enjoyed the soft brush of the smaller man's lips across his flesh, ignoring the way Sherlock had petulantly crossed his arms over his chest in protest of his punishment. If he had done anything to John's jumpers he is lucky the punishment was not worse.
“I want you on your hands and knees……NOW.” The command in John’s voice made Sherlock’s cock twitch and leak. He had never known he had a soldier kink until tonight, and he never planned on letting it go. Grabbing a bottle of lube and condoms from the nightstand he tossed them on the bed.
He thought to himself, having seen John get nervous a time or two when there wasn’t an easy way to get out when Sherlock wasn’t around with him.
Sherlock shook his head and waved the man off as he stood and approached the dance floor where army man was still enjoying himself as the song changed to Cryptex and the soldier changed the way he moved. Slyly, Sherlock slid himself up behind the man who was now bouncing slightly with the beat as he swayed back and forth, his head tilting forward and back as he danced. Unable to stop himself as his he came closer to the man, he crowded himself up close behind and placed his hands on the blonde man’s hips moving in sync with him.
John got up from his chair angrily, his pulse pounding in his temples as he paced around the chair he had just vacated. “I really am. I am perfectly fine. I just haven’t been able to sleep is all.”
“I want to suck your cock. I want to swallow you down. I want you to fuck my face!” Sherlock’s voice was rough with want as he spoke the words, and earned himself a rough kiss from the shorter man, John grasping his face and bringing them together in a clash of teeth and tongues; all want and hunger and absolutely perfection.  When John pulled away his face was flushed with arousal and his lips kiss swollen and red.
John laughed hard at that, “Nope. No punishment. He genuinely wanted to come out with you and I. He never does, and he wanted to have a sort of date without all the usual date business. Plus the few glasses of whiskey we had at home before we came helped to loosen him up to being pleasant with everyone else. Just relax and enjoy it love.” with that the doctor gave his thigh a little squeeze beneath the table before turning back to Sherlock who was attempting to have a conversation with Sally.
“Sherlock…” the words were thick and wanting to stick in his throat as they made their way from the aching hollow of his chest, “Oh Sherlock, I miss you….everyday. I miss your rudeness. I miss the severed body parts in the refrigerator. I miss having to make you eat. I miss making you tea. I miss everything about you…..my life is so empty without you in it…”
Then the pair put their shoulders together and shook them with the beat of the next line.
"Besides, no one is here anyways." The doctor continued his quest by mouthing at his clothed erection and nuzzling it with his nose gently before unzipping the dark gray trousers and urging the older men to lift his hips so John could slide them down fully to pool at his ankles.
“Well…if you can handle my playing the violin at all hours of the night and occasional outings to act as a consultant for the Scotland Yard….then I would like you to stay John Watson. You are the first person to find my deductions ‘amazing’. Stay with me?”
The raven haired man frowned and hummed his acknowledgment before turning his chair to face the door; shoulders slumped in a sulk.
“I have been trying…I really have Sherlock. But….it’s just too hard. I would much rather leave this world and be with you than try to continue on without. Your name is cleared now you know? Lestrade and I spent months and months going over your cases you worked and each and every one of them were proved legitimate. Anderson and Donovan were shocked, and they even apologized to me. I punched Anderson in the face.” John chuckled and sobbed at the memory. “Oh Sherlock….I would trade….everything….all of it….just to see your face and tell you all the things that I should have…”
“Tell me what you want.” John said in a hushed voice as his lips continued to lather attention to his neck
Sherlock pressed back onto John’s fingers seeking more sensation as the doctor pumped his fingers in and out of him while lapping around the digits as they worked. The young man’s head was swimming as his vision whited when John’s fingers crooked and the pads of his fingers began to gently stroke his prostate. Sherlock was lost now as he panted into the crook of his elbow, torn between begging him to stop and fuck him, or keep going.
Please John.” Pulling back she looked into his eyes sadly before running off towards the hospital in a hurry leaving John to just sigh and continue on his way to his appointment with Ella.
Greg’s heart was pounding in his chest as adrenaline coursed through his veins at almost being caught by his sergeant getting his knob polished by the very popular Doctor Watson. When John’s mouth began to continue his attention at Lestrade’s cock, the DI froze in his chair.
Without a word John sauntered away from him and up to the bar where he was placing an order. Sherlock couldn’t help but follow the glorious man to the bar where he observed a woman was watching John carefully as she adjusted her breasts in her dress. He watched as she checked them once more before plastering on a sickeningly sweet smile and tapped John on the shoulder. The blonde turned and smiled kindly at her and listened as she whispered in his ear; completely unaware of Sherlock’s approach.  He just stared at her as she continued her desperate advance on the man. John turned to her with two shots in his hand, causing the woman to smile and hold her hand out; only to be left staring as the man turned to Sherlock and handed him one of the glasses.
Taking the bottle of whiskey in his hands he unscrewed the cap and took a long drink from it. “It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have been such a coward. I should have told you how important you were to me while you were here.” Sniffing loudly he took another long swig. “I should have told you that I was there for you. That I would always be there. You, Sherlock, I cannot live without in my life…..It’s too quiet here now…..It’s too still….It’s too empty…this silence…..its deafening….” John pulled the small bottle he had just gotten from the druggist and added the pills to the bottle already in his lap. He had been saving the pills, not wanting to use them when he needed them. He felt he deserved the nightmares. He deserved the pain that they brought. It was his punishment for his cowardice.
John jolted awake panting, quickly running his hand over his face as he caught the hot tears streaming down his cheeks. It was always the same nightmare…always. Taking a glance at the clock he let out a soft groan of frustration. It was still early. Too early to go back to sleep; if he actually were able to fall back asleep. It’s always the same nightmare that plagues him, each night robbing him of rest and comfort. Not that he deserved a rest and reprieve from the throbbing ache that wouldn’t go away…no he deserved this pain.
“Oi! None of that in my cab! I’ll chuck you out right now!” The cabbie shot them a glare in the mirror, muttering under his breath “Fuckin’ poofs”.
“I find that you calm my mind in a way that no drug, drink, or other individual has in my entire existence. I feel connected in a way to you that I can’t explain and I feel extremely safe with you in my presence.”
A soft knock on his office door startled him out of his memories of the gruesome way the malnourished children had been beaten so severely. No one else from his department was in the office, or at least shouldn't be, not at this hour. When the door cracked open he was met with a familiar bright smile and blue eyes that were full of compassion and understanding. John always knew where his thoughts were at when they traveled to the dark part of his mind, the smaller man was a huge strength to the DI after a particularly brutal case. The stocky ex soldier waltzed in with a drink carrier filled with what was undoubtedly tea, John made the best tea, followed by the consulting detective ducking in right behind him.
“And on that note I have had too much whiskey and need to go home. John, care to join me at home?” Sherlock was slurring his words as he leaned heavily on John smiling from ear to ear.
John started to chuckle and it filled the room as he laughed.
“That….was….astounding….” Sherlock breathed out in awe as he stared at the disheveled man. “Thank you Doctor…..”
"Well then, we must find a way to relax you then won't we. Put your mind at ease. To make sure the paperwork is done properly." The shorter man made his way in front of Greg and captured his lips in a filthy kiss. "I have not had my hands on you in three days." The doctor's voice whispered across the older man's lips as he spoke. "And that my dear detective inspector is completely unacceptable." John dove back in, running his tongue along the seam of the DI's lips before thrusting his tongue past the barrier; burying and licking his way all around the man's mouth. The groan that erupted from the DI was positively obscene as the doctor ran his hand down his chest to lightly palm at the silver haired man's cock that had begun tenting his trousers.
“Why do ye-” she whispered, blinking. “I. He, he works as a ground’s keeper, Colin does, for the Luxemburg mausoleum. But he is quite sick at the moment, he ‘asn’t been able to tend to his duties for perhaps a week now.” She swallowed. “So, so you see, ‘e wasn’t able to commit this crime, please don’t think of blaming my ‘usband for this theft.”
Watson took a step and Holmes mirrored him, and their eyes met with a force like magnets.
Holmes grinned merrily, his knuckles like a brand on Watson’s ribs. “We shall pour the good lad a drink.”
Watson knew the detective like he knew nothing else, not even his medical profession, and that was a vaguely disconcerting train of thought so early in the day.
“The maid had been crying,” he said, flapping a hand toward the kitchen. “There was a spatter of the latest cure-all elixir on her apron, about six drops near the hem, so it is not she who is ill but whomever she has been feeding it to; they do not have the strength to even sit up. They are very near death, I feel, and so does she. She needs money for a cure.”
“Look, of course I’m not
Holmes pressed an urgent finger to his lips and the maid fell silent, her eyes huge and watery. “The good dying young from a simple lack of wealth is a crime, Mrs Andrews. Please take us to your husband.”
, Sherlock, because our flat is blown to hell and we’ve just gone through a
A composed maid entered the vast room and her footfalls echoed as she delivered a tray of triangular-cut sandwiches and biscuits. The Lady shooed her away without much thought.
Watson had and did spend many a moment trying to dislike Holmes for the changes he had wrangled in him, for the pure simple fact that Holmes had been remodelling the doctor with his bare hands since their first acquaintance. It never worked. He was not perturbed.
Sherlock is pouring the second tea. He looks over. John can feel his cataloguing gaze.
“John,” Sherlock says quietly, so quietly John feels the timbre of his voice more than he even hears it. “Just because she said in her video, just because Mary acknowledged– I don’t want you to feel-”
to scrounge a nightly companion from this oh so prestigious profession of yours. Therein lays much motivation, one could say, but apparently not enough for my good doctor.”
“We are deeply sorry for your many grievances, my Lady,” he said lowly, and she psh’ed him with a wave of her handkerchief.
Holmes cut his scarf through the air as he was prone to and wrapped it firmly around his neck. “The only respect due to the good Lady Luxemburg is for that of her monetary insight; indeed, her daughter’s remains were stolen for money, although I do feel that the circumstances of the theft rely heartily on convenience and not status.”
Holmes’s mouth flashed white at that, his grin sharp in the dark.
So it was.
This auditory nuisance was rather customary of the man, expected even, but nonetheless Watson found himself quite cross as he jolted awake. He needed
“That,” Holmes said in a remarkably steady voice, aside from the slight rasp, “could definitely suffice as motivation. I can personally attest to the fact that there isn’t much I
Holmes didn’t even object when, once safely in their apartment, Watson made him strip off his coat so the doctor could clean and possibly bandage his grazes. The detective perched on the edge of the settee and poured two small glasses of alcohol, grinning in a very small way to himself.
Holmes was there.
An immeasurable warmth swells in John’s chest watching Sherlock coo over his daughter, a feeling far too big and deep to name. His breath is beginning to shake again, and he’s thinking in a fractured repeat,
Holmes’s eyes abruptly struck Watson as the blackest kind of lightning, and he said compulsively, “I should check those too,” and then nodded to Holmes hands, where there were many superficial lacerations. “In case a similar infection to Colin’s takes particular fancy to your blood, Holmes,” and he would have testified to the fact that he was joking, except it was proving exceptionally difficult to jest when the night was pushing them close enough to feel the warmth of breath as they whispered. Watson thought he saw Holmes’s wide, rare smile.

John breathes a sigh of relief as he nestles Rosie into her blankets. Though her eyes are closed and her face is slack, a small hand comes up and curls weakly around John’s collar just as he attempts pulling away and he freezes, desperate not to wake her.
.” Holmes’s hand was tighter than seemed possible on Watson’s hip and that was fitting, the probable bruise-marks that would remain. Holmes had branded Watson in every other way and Watson really wouldn’t mind carrying the detective’s fingerprints on his hipbone.
, it always has been, so you don’t have to. Worry, or–”

Watson breathed out and shut his eyes, fighting off another indecent grin. “Well. Shall we go talk to her?”

show them the proper respect.”
Sherlock’s standing in the doorway of John’s kitchen, Rosie hitched on his right side with one hand supporting her. She has a fist curled happily in his hair. Her chubby face glows when she sees John and she releases Sherlock’s hair at once, pats his cheek a couple times as a fairly obvious indicator of what she wants before releasing a series of gurgles. Sherlock makes a fond expression not dissimilar to Rosie’s when he glances from her giggling face to where John stands at the bench.
“Of course I did, Watson.” Holmes held his hand to Watson’s cheek. “No other person on this
,” she whispered it like a dirty word, “stolen, how horrible. It’s for money, I am telling you Mister Holmes. My family is very
Holmes laughed, hands flexing on Watson’s hips for a moment before manhandling the doctor forward onto his lap without preamble. Watson gasped and grabbed at Holmes’s chin, locked their mouths together once again.
“My good man, I can give you twenty-seven reasons – possibly twenty-four if you argue with me on some points, which is unavoidable. However, I shall only voice one.”
She stood with many a metal jangle and reached a hand toward them both, which they kissed after a beat. She shook herself. “I hope I have been useful, gentlemen, and I thank you for embracing this case. Now, I must depart for I have many messages to send, but do feel free to inspect whatever necessary and interrogate whomever you deem fit.” Her expression was one of faint contempt, clearly convinced that she and her husband were the only ones worth speaking with in the entire mansion.
is mutual, Sherlock, okay? Everything.”
The flat was a mess but fortunately, John had a house.
Holmes chuckled shortly and Watson felt a hotness on the back of his neck, a certain prickling of his skull that came with the knowledge that he was still in his bed-shorts and Holmes was so tidy and clean and the world was fuzzy-edged around them.
“Black humour is nothing more than humour when the world itself is devoid of all light,” Holmes told his friend, and then added quite casually, “The missing child has been dead for two years. Her grave was robbed yesterday.”
Watson griped into his pillow, cotton against his teeth. He was uncomfortable with being lit up and so keenly observed while his companion was in the shadows, ever shrouded with darkness. “More pressingly, Holmes; who are
He rolled over to face the other side of his room.
, you see, and the ceremonies for my daughter were quite something, I doubt that anyone has yet forgotten them. Poor dear, she just developed a cough and never recovered…” She blinked and drew herself up importantly, an abundance of jewellery rattling. “So if we do not soon receive word of ransom then I have no doubt they are selling her to some ruffian or, or, occult or some such nonsense. Her bones will be worth a lot, see, as is anything with the surname Luxemburg.”
“I’m okay, Sherlock,” he says, before Sherlock can ask. He picks up Rosie’s pacifier from the dinner table and starts suggesting it to her, gentle nudges toward her happy face and slow-blinking eyes.
Holmes downed his share, and in the moment of distraction Watson tipped his glassful into Holmes’s wounds.
Watson shot Holmes a warning look; social niceties were an order put in place for a
John quietly asked himself if maybe this, what they were doing right now, crossed a line.
John was quite enjoying this. He found it wasn’t hard to ignore the fact that the one brushing his hair was his flatmate. His married-to-his-work, MALE flatmate. What other people would say to their unique situation seemed so inconsequential behind the closed doors of 221B. He let himself relax.
Sherlock better be in the bloody flat and let him in, John thought as he rang the doorbell for the first, then the second time. His current ability to endure Sherlock’s antics was already quite low, given the day he was having. Showing up to a lock of Sherlock’s doing denying John the peace and quiet of his home was really causing his tolerance meter to reach dangerously low levels.
“Stand up.”
This led to Sherlock brushing John’s hair like a proper child. He brushed and dried and put some sort of product in it and then brushed some more. He seemed to be fussing a fair bit over something that John spent no time at all doing.
Now that John thought about it, this probably didn’t have much to do with John not saying goodbye. Sherlock would not admit to such a thing bothering him, even if John’s pleasantries to Sherlock were held to different standards than Sherlock’s.
As the first droplets began to decorate John’s hair, John began expanding his generally mild lexicon pertaining to colorful language. ‘Sherlock the absolute shitting bastard’ was one of the tamer phrases passing his lips.
On top of not wanting to spend any more money on a cab, John was insanely tired. He was dreading the simple trip up the stairs to the flat; he couldn’t imagine walking multiple blocks to some establishment or another, just to have to trudge back sometime later, hoping Sherlock would be home by then.
John was almost asleep. He was halfway to REM and Sherlock decided to ask him some sort of encrypted message that he doubted he would understand if his brain was working at full capacity. That is the only excuse he has for his flippant answer.
Sherlock seemed to answer his own question with a glance, not waiting for John to reply before continuing, a little out of breath.  “I believe a bit of an explanation is in order. I changed the lock this morning shortly after you left due to an experiment related to the melting points of various rare substances given to me as a sort of payback for a solid favor given to one of my contacts. I may have melted through our previous security appliance when one of the substances refused to properly liquefy.”
Admitting defeat, John sat in front of the only thing preventing him from a warm fire and a relaxing book and drew his knees up to his chest. A little rain wouldn’t kill him, it wouldn’t even get him sick, despite popular opinion. All the same, he really hoped he wasn’t stuck out here for long. Being tired and emotionally strung out did not help much with immune system upkeep and rain didn’t exactly improve his state.
In all honesty, Sherlock’s absence probably had more to do with the work than John. John has fallen second place to the work on many occasions.
“Just because you just stick a comb in it and call it ready for the day doesn’t mean I have to, John,” Sherlock shouted over the drier.
After a half hour or so, Sherlock shut off the hair drier. After he got used to the buzzing of the hair drier, the flat was so silent.
Ah well. No time to get it new. If he didn’t dawdle now and he was able to successfully hail a cab soon, John could avoid being late for work. No reason losing that for a phone. Besides. There was a landline at the office.
He returned two minutes later with a pile of blankets, dry clothes, and various other helpful items such as cold medicine.
Having forgotten altogether the blissful feeling of a full night’s sleep, John trudged up to the road with his medical bag in tow, wondering if someone had snuck bricks in it when he wasn’t looking. Even his own hand felt like gravity was being stupidly strong as he raised it to catch another cab.
The cabbie this time around was a bit too eager to swerve around slower traffic and flirt with the speed limit, but John supposed beggars couldn’t be choosers. At least he made it home in record time.
John was under some sort of trance, he was sure of it. He stood up with no argument and continued to look at Sherlock. John Watson would claim until the day he died that he did not know what was coming next. He knew his racing heart beat gave him away, though.
So John decided to do what was easiest and lent back ever so slightly into Sherlock’s touch. They rarely held prolonged physical contact of any form and John can’t say he was opposed to a little extra affection now and then. He hadn't had a girlfriend in almost two months now—Sherlock’s doing, most definitely—and he was rather starved of affection on all fronts.
Sherlock huffed and dropped the brush to the ground with a clang. He then switched to using his dexterous fingers to card through John’s damp hair.
“Sherlock! It’s okay. I’m f-fine.” John let out a huff at how unconvincing he sounded. It was hard to act resolute when sporting chattering teeth.
John promptly told himself to shut up and deepened the kiss.
Silent and Pleasant John won against Imaginary Sherlock in the end and he rushed into the medical center a whopping thirty minutes late. Without his phone he was unable to warn the clinic of his late arrival and he was confronted with more than a few angry colleagues who had to pick up the slack while he was meandering through London in the slowest cab of the century. On top of that, he owes one doctor a favor, so says the gossip receptionist. Allegedly, John’s first patient of the day had the stomach bug and the doctor filling in for him was sprayed with sick.
Which leads John to his present situation, considering disowning his flatmate in order to avoid hypothermia. He was not dressed for the weather and his useless, thin jumper will be soaked through in a matter of minutes. If Sherlock was in the flat and deliberately ignoring John, he suspected he may just break into the flat, regardless of the fact that a very thick door and a Sherlock-approved deadbolt lie in his way. When John hit the thirtieth ring, he gave up with the doorbell. Either Sherlock was ignoring him or he was out.
As it turns out, Guilty Sherlock can be quite the caretaker. He made pulled John to the sofa and wrapped him in a towel he seemed to pull out of thin air before striding to the kitchen, presumably to make tea. John sat in stunned silence as Sherlock flitted around the kitchen gathering the necessary ingredients before putting the kettle on. His peculiar partner didn’t make tea unless he was feeling extremely bad about something.
For lack of anything interesting to do, he thought about Sherlock’s motive for shutting John out of their home. He didn’t think not saying goodbye in the morning would have any effect of Sherlock at all. It was like he said before John moved in— Sherlock didn’t speak for days on end. Was John’s lack of communication worse somehow?
“Hey, you alright?” John asked, unnerved by Sherlock’s lack of usual bluster.
“John, I would like—that is to say... May I?”
John wouldn’t care nearly as much had he been gifted with a key to said security measures. He probably would have even approved of Sherlock’s lock changing. The first time.
When John got back, dressed in a thick jumper and dry trousers, the sitting room was at least three degrees warmer than when he left. Sherlock had lit a fire and was now standing in the middle of the room looking a bit uncomfortable.
What a mess this was. John didn’t really want to waste another cab fare to get somewhere dryer. He would have taken the tube to work— god knows he can’t afford everyday London cab rides to work after spending most of his earnings on trips to obscure places for cases with Sherlock— but the closest tube had been down for a few days and London had been rather panicked about the whole ordeal. The news barely talked about anything else yesterday night.
He went to shove the new key into the lock when he was stopped by the size of the key hole. The key he had looked much too big to fit in such a tiny lock. Aside from the side, the lock looked exactly the same as the one that had been on the door yesterday.
John grinned and closed his eyes.
Sherlock, ignoring John’s obviously insincere platitudes, pulled out a plain black key from his trouser pocket.  “Come on, John. A fire will do you good.”
“Oh,” John mused, turning the blow dryer around in his hand scrutinizingly. “Wait, I’m not sick at all, Sherlock!” John protested after his thoughts were drawn away from the suspicious object in his hand.
John just went on grinning, ignoring Sherlock’s frankly weak protests about losing his temper over an inanimate object.
Looking up as the steadily darkening clouds closed in, John let out a loud huff of frustration. He was never going to forgive Sherlock if he got soaked.
John’s day had started out quite pleasant, all things considered. He had risen a few minutes before his alarm, having had a full night’s rest for once, and reveled in the morning sunlight for a full minute before he leisurely made his way to the shower. He then spent a glorious thirty minutes enjoying the warm spray, which seemed like a wonderful idea at the time. Unfortunately, his prolonged shower turned out to be his first mistake in a long list of infuriating events that accumulated throughout the day.
“Sherlock.”
The DI ran his hand roughly through his silver hair before rubbing his tired eyes and looking at the clock. It was nearly 10 and he still had a mountain of paperwork to finish. At this rate he wasn't going to make it home at all tonight and he was already feeling exhausted. This last case had run him ragged and taken a huge emotional toll on him. Anything that involved children being abused so horrifically left him with a bad case of insomnia and mountains of paperwork. Still after all his years experience with the yard, certain circumstances of cases made his skin crawl and him sick to his stomach. Closing his eyes he threw his pen on the desk and rubbed his temples gently to try and make the migraine that was beginning dissipate, he knew it was more than stress causing his head to ache; he had been unable to eat anything since they found the children earlier that morning.
Gently he pulled himself up to sit in the silence of the flat staring at the mostly empty room that he slept in. He still climbed each of the steps to the smaller room upstairs, he couldn’t bring himself to even touch the door to Sherlock’s room. No, that was a sacred place. No one was to enter that room. Mycroft had tried to come and box up Sherlock’s things and take them away but John had chased him out of the flat.  The doctor threw his legs out of the bed and stood on his feet with a grunt; the pain in his leg causing him limp along as he made his way to the bathroom. Shucking off his pajamas and pants he spared a glance at the shattered mirror on the wall before turning on the shower. The glass was cracked, each line spidering out from the initial point where John’s fist had made contact with it 5 months after the fall.
“Oi! Sherlock! Don’t you be chasing off my customers if you want any of this,” Patrick shouted over the thumping music of Celldweller as he shook a small baggie of white powder in front of himself. Sherlock’s fingers twitched as he stared at the bag. It had been a while since he had a fix, his brain had been going nonstop and he needed to calm it. He despised coming to the clubs, having to come into contact with such idiotic individuals. But unfortunately, Patrick could not be trusted anywhere else. Sherlock nodded at Patrick before rolling his eyes when the dealer glanced away and allowed his eyes to the dance floor. Watching the sweaty and vulgar dancers on the floor to kill some time ‘til he could get what he wanted.
“Ah!” Sherlock said suddenly turning and grinning at John and Greg in a truly manic way. “KARAOKE!”
“How did you….”
“Bottoms up!” Sherlock threw his drink back as John did and found himself being snogged by the army doctor as soon as the glass left his lips. Running his hands through Sherlock’s hair he gripped it tight and kissed him fiercely. His tongue sliding into Sherlock’s mouth as he deepened the kiss and drew a low groan from the younger man. Giving Sherlock’s hair a tug, he released his mouth but held tight to his hair as John turned back to the woman who was staring in shock.
Sherlock sighed with relief when finally the thick studded head of John’s cock began to push at his entrance. Eagerly he began to push his hips back to try and get as much of John’s thick cock into him. But John held tight to his hips not allowing him any control of the pace. John chuckled as he slowly pressed in ‘til he was seated fully in Sherlock’s arse and moaned himself as he stilled his hips, holding Sherlock’s tightly. Sherlock tried to wriggle his hips to get the man to move, and received another sharp smack to his arse.
Leaning low Sherlock brought his lips to the doctor’s ear as he spoke. “You caught my attention. It is hard for one to capture my attention, I find most people tedious, boring, and stupid. But you…..” he took a deep breath of the man’s throat; he smelled of tea, gun oil, and cinnamon. “You seem to have invaded my mind. You and your fantastic arse.” Grabbing John’s arse and pulled him close so their groins were grinding against each other as they danced. John let out a groan at the contact. “And after your display of disarming me I would love to see exactly how far that dominating stature extends.”
Greg glanced up to see Sherlock staring at him intensely; now turned his chair back to face the desk while licking his lips at the sight of Greg’s pleasure painted across his face. He could tell that John was hidden from sight from his place halfway under the desk because Sherlock was slowly palming himself through his expensive trousers, pupils blown wide in lust. The DI decided to not give the younger man away to their dear doctor, and instead threw his head back to let out a deep moan; intent on driving Sherlock mad with his pleasure in his punishment. Letting out a gasp as John decided at that moment to take the entirety of Greg’s cock into his mouth and down his throat.
“Oh my John…” Using his other free hand he brushed the too long fringe out of John’s face before tracing his fingers over and along the features of the man’s face; relearning each detail of the man now changed.
“You will not touch yourself until I say so!” The pain of the slap and the commanding tone sent electricity flying through every fiber of Sherlock’s being.
John swallowed all of Sherlock down contracting his throat a few times before pulling off entirely and pinning the younger man to the bed; hands held tight above his head as John straddled his chest.
as Sherlock sang in harmony with him.
“John…..I…..”
Sherlock felt the touch of John’s fingers in his hair again as he gripped the back of his head tightly, and the splash of tears in his hair.
“John!” his voice was broken and raspy as he spoke. “I’m so close!”
Sighing John ran his fingers through his now shaggy long blonde hair; streaks and hints of grey here and there. Now more prominent than ever after three years of grief and stress.
Grabbing their coats from the coat check, they ducked out of the club before Sherlock began pulling John into the dark alley beside the club and captured his mouth again and licked his way into the shorter man’s mouth. Their tongues slid across each other as John grasped his arse and pulled them together as they devoured each other. When they finally broke apart Sherlock was panting.
Sally nodded and turned to leave and scowled at Sherlock once more before closing the door behind her.
As he looked up from his phone he was met with the sight of John and Sherlock smiling from ear to ear walking towards their little group of yarders; both of them wearing their dressed down casual clothes that only Greg had seen them in in the comfort of their own home. Sherlock’s tattoos were showing as he took off his leather jacket revealing his tight black v-neck t-shirt and dark blue skinny jeans. While the doctor was dressed in the same sweater and jeans he had worn the night that he proposed their little threesome soiree.
“Sherlock, go make sure that no one is out in the bullpen before we leave the office.” John instructed as he urged Greg to his feet to zip and button the taller man’s trousers. “Don’t want Sally watching all three of us leaving the office when you told her that I was busy at home.” The doctor grinned at the Detective Inspector before claiming his mouth in a much softer kiss before deepening it as Sherlock slipped out of the room. Greg sighed into the kiss as he tasted himself on the doctor’s tongue.
This little ficlet was inspired by the combination of this art by my lover:
When he raked his eyes back up the blonde man he caught sight of a starburst shaped scar on the front of his left shoulder. The scar itself served as the center point of another beautiful piece of ink. All around the starburst scar orange and red shot outward from it curling out into colorful plumes of smoke, and there emerging from the colors was an anatomically correct heart with a clock or timer wired into the pulmonary arteries. Atop the heart/clock piece sat a golden crown. He couldn’t quite understand why, but this man’s presence sang in Sherlock’s mind and he had to meet him.
“Well, Hallo there love.” Sherlock resisted the urge to roll his eyes as a busty blonde slid in beside him; looking him over with hunger in her eyes. Her pupils were already blown wide; her intoxication obvious as she pressed herself into Sherlock’s personal space so her breasts were against his side just under where his arms were propped on the back of the booth. “Is a handsome bloke like you lookin’ fer a good time?” The smell of alcohol wafted from her breath as she brought her face close to speak. Sherlock turned his head and gave her a once over. “Tan line on her ring finger: married.” The dark haired man sniffed at her, really, who did this woman think she was fooling? He flitted his eyes to where Patrick sat amongst the group before turning back to the woman and staring her in the face.
Looking down at her pad of paper Ella jotted down some notes before taking out her prescription pad and writing out a prescription for him. “This is a prescription for 3 pills. They allow you to get some rest. I want you to come back in 3 days and we will have another appointment and discuss if your sleep has improved.
“Not a single person has been able to help me since my return….not even my own sister. So I highly doubt that you want me here with you.”
Sherlock brought himself closer to the doctor so their lips were just a hair away from each other and their noses bumped. “I know what you mean.”
"John and I will assist you with the rest of your paperwork tomorrow afternoon after you have had adequate rest, and a good shag." The younger man's deep voice rumbled as he plopped himself down in one of the office chairs before turning about in it.
"I have to at least get this stack finished before I go. Otherwise I'll be tearing my hair out tomorrow. I just want this case to be over with." Greg shut his eyes as he felt John rolling his chair out from the desk and running his hands up and down the detective's chest slowly in a calming manner.
my fault you weren't listening when I said I was going to test how fast wool disintegrates in different levels of acid!" The taller man snapped absurdly over his shoulder.
Sherlock lazily leaned back in the cushy black booth that sat conveniently in the dark corner of the night club, surrounded by the usual patrons and clients of Patrick. His liner traced eyes surveyed the room; a few individuals here and there causing him to quirk his pierced brow up. He was bare chested, as was usual, he hated wearing shirts even when at home; having only a burgundy blazer to cover portions of his flesh. Hints of his tattoos showed from under the expensive fabric: delicate measures of music that swirled from his neck down across his chest over to his left arm where it wrapped its way around the bicep. Hidden beneath the sleeves of his jacket were three Gallifreyan symbols representing the words “Dream”, “Escape”, and “Ascent” setting directly below the original composition of notes.  Hidden on his right shoulder was the exact image of the skull that sat on his mantel piece at home, only surrounded by dark red roses on his flesh. He was here for one reason and that was to score.
John let out a light hum, barely audible but enough vibration to send Greg over the edge, biting back a shout as his orgasm ripped through him. His entire body tensing as he slammed his fist down on the desk at the intensity of it, causing Sally to turn around quickly before turning back to Sherlock and scowling. Greg brought his hands to cover his face, his back curved and body covering the space where John was hidden under the desk in attempts to collect himself.
“You haven’t been taking care of yourself…”
He had quit eating regularly after Sherlock’s fall, seeing no point in it. Though those in his life had tried their best to get him to eat his meals: Harry, Mrs. Hudson, Molly, Lestrade. Harry was the first, she had come over jumpy and nervous trying to coax him to eat the curry she had picked up for him before finally relenting. Then Molly and Lestrade, coming over together with a meal for them all to share. The two of them eating and trying to make light conversation while John sat and picked silently at his food. Even Mycroft had made attempts to improve the doctor’s appetite, finally resorting to threats of shipping John to a rehab facility.
Sherlock’s ears began to ring as his orgasm slammed through him as John stroked him firmly while still pounding in him and nailing his prostate over and over again; a hoarse scream tearing itself from his throat as his head began to float with the overwhelming relief from his release. John only thrust twice more before groaning his own release and the two of them falling on their fronts onto the bed.
The sound of John’s voice had Sherlock shooting up in his chair wide eyed and staring at John who was sitting up and awake in the bed. He wore a small smile as he stared back at the younger man.
John sighed and smiled up at the dark haired man with the angel wings on his back. “If you’ll have me, I will stay....besides how am I to say no to that gorgeous arse?”
John withdrew his fingers and Sherlock felt empty, but was relieved when he heard the tearing of the foil of a condom and braced himself as he felt the cold slick of lube being pressed into and around his hole.
“Sherlock…”
He placed his shaking fingers on the knob gently, the feel of the metal cold on his already chilled skin. John took in a shuddering breath as he turned the knob and opened the door; the room dark save for the slight light that came through the window with the stormy weather. There he stood in the doorway taking in the room around him: the periodic table hanging on the wall to the right, the large bed perfectly made, the nightstand with books stacked on it, the ashtray from Buckingham Palace balanced atop the pile. The sight of the crystal ashtray caused the tears that were pooling in the doctor’s eyes to overflow and stream down his wet face.
Greg didn’t miss where Sherlock sang “My blogger and me” instead of “My Shadow and me.”
“Doctor John Watson, this may sound a bit mad, but I think you should stay here with me….indefinitely.” John’s head snapped to look back at him.
“I should have been here.”
Once he began to shiver he pulled himself out of the water to dry himself off and pad his way back to his room and staring into his closet. Gently he ran his fingers over the now too loose clothes that hung in the closet, over the jumpers that Sherlock would tease him for; before picking out the chunky oatmeal colored one. Pulling on his clothes he is grateful for the bulk the jumper provides, allowing him to hide the weight he has continued to lose over the last three years.
slipped past his sergeant's lips as it always had been a word that dug deep into Sherlock leaving relentless anxiety. But Sherlock just rolled his eyes at her and leaned against the pub table. “Of course I do Sally. I do not live under a rock. Besides when one is as accomplished at the violin as I am one enjoys taking modern songs and playing them with a classical style. Anyways, not everything is dreadful pop on that list.” He flashed a grin to John who smiled back at him.
“So, is karaoke something you and Phillip do regularly?” Sally was just staring at him like he was an insane person. It was obvious she had never seen the relaxed and kinder side of Sherlock that only John and Greg knew. Suddenly the music the One Direction’s “Story of My Life” started up along with Anderson’s slightly out of tune voice singing along. Greg braced himself for the scathing remarks to drip from Sherlock’s lips as Anderson tried to hit a high note. But no insults came. Only Sherlock leaning over and whispering in John’s ear before disappearing to the notebook of songs at the front of the stage and flipping through it quickly and writing down a selection on the list. She hurried back to the table and did another shot of whiskey and drumming his fingers on the table.
It only lasted a moment. In a flash the man had grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and yanked his arm behind him sharply causing pain to shoot through the taller man’s shoulder. It was exquisite and sent the younger man’s blood humming in his veins. The smaller man held him there for a moment before him quickly releasing Sherlock who turn himself around to regard the army man who had just pinned him. The blonde man looked horrified as he stared at Sherlock.
“No.” John breathed in through his nose harshly and swallowed, “I have something to say and I need to say it without any interuptions…..” When he opened his eyes he waited for Sherlock to nod in understanding before he continued with his eyes in his lap.
The doctor walked up to the desk, setting the drink carrier down before handing one to the detective inspector. "No more tonight love. We've come to bring you home. We haven't seen you in almost two days. The paperwork can wait til tomorrow. This case has been hard enough on you. Time to go." The doctor moved up behind Greg and wrapped his arms around the DI's chest and planted a soft kiss behind his ear. Greg let himself relax back into the embrace, the weight from the last few days finally hitting him hard; his entire body feeling heavy.
He didn’t bother taking off his jacket or wet shoes, the rubber squeaking as me made his way to the bathroom to collect the pill bottle along with the bottle of whiskey that was resting on the back of the toilet. Holding the plastic bottle in one hand and the whiskey in the other he walked towards the room that had stayed shut for the last three years.
Greg smiled tightly at his sergeant, “I appreciate that Donovan. I need to have a little chat with Sherlock. You are more than welcome to come back in 20 minutes to get the paperwork, but don’t feel obligated to finish it. I can finish it tomorrow.”
“Then I saw Mycroft sitting over there.” John nodded to the chair that sat opposite Sherlock’s and chuckled to himself. “Mycroft explained what happened. About Moriarty, Moran, and your mission the last three years.” John took a deep breath and let it out slowly with a pained look on his face.
“Better grab a cab then shouldn’t we?” John smiled at him mischievously before darting out of the alley and hailing a cab quickly. They both climbed into the cab as Sherlock gave his address to the cabbie.
John sat still with the two bottles in his hand, the whiskey and the pills before tipping the pills into his mouth emptying the bottle onto his tongue before gulping them down with the rest of the bottle of the whiskey. Once the last drop passed over his lips he let himself collapse back onto the bed and gathered the pillows and buried his face in them. They still smelled faintly of Sherlock. John closed his eyes tight and breathed deeply as he imagined Sherlock once again. His gorgeous curls that begged to have fingers run through them. His ivory flawless skin, and those eyes. Those beautiful mysterious eyes filled with all the answers and questions in the world. John’s body began to feel heavy as he felt the pills begin to take hold of him. He clutched the pillow all the tighter as he felt the darkness overtake him; the image of Sherlock filling his mind.
“John” the familiar voice of Molly caught John’s attention and he was met with the sight of her looking at him with worry in her eyes. He knew exactly why. He hadn’t seen or talked to the woman in the last 9 months. The last time being when she and Greg had to talk him down from the very same ledge he had just been staring at moments ago.
he would say.
Silently Sherlock made his way into room 109 of the Intensive Care Unit at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; the room dark, save for the soft glow of the lights in the hallway. Standing just barely in the room he absorbs all of his surroundings out of habit from the last three years taking down Moriarty’s web on his own; never being able to let his guard down. He listens to the soft pattering of the rain beating against the window to the right of the bed, it hadn’t stopped raining since the day he got the call from Mycroft of the dire need for him to return home.The beeping of the heart monitor mixed with the hiss of the ventilator breathing for John causes his heart to lurch in his chest.
The shorter man continued his inspection of Sherlock’s curly mop of hair over his own toned bared chest, down his tight leather trousers where his cock was half hard in his pants at the encounter with the army doctor; and back up to stare into his makeup clad eyes. “John.” The man finally said grinning widely at him.
John slapped Greg on the back before grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pushing their way through the crowd to bring themselves up on the little stage that had been set up on the end of the bar. Greg sat up a bit taller on his bar stool to see over the heads of the other patrons as a swinging jazz music started to fill the bar and his pair of lovers grinned at each other and started to sing.
Sherlock’s mouth began to water at the sight of the doctor’s cock; he was very well endowed and there was a studded bar running through the head. Moaning loudly he dove forward and took John into his mouth and began to suck him in earnest, enjoying the salty tang of precome that had begun to pool in the slit of John’s cock. The man was absolutely delicious and perfect, Sherlock cataloged the way how the warm metal felt against the roof of his mouth and his throat.
“We’ve missed see you about, Greg and I. We should get together sometime, or you can visit me anytime at work.” John tried to hide his wince as she suggested he visit the morgue to see her. The thought of walking into the morgue or even in through the doors of St. Barts made his stomach twist into knots. Molly must have seen his twitch, “Oh…I’m so sorry John…I really am. That was silly of me to suggest…I…I really am sorry…” She stood there and stared at him sadly with tears in her eyes before she grabbed him and pulled him into a tight hug. “You call me if you need
Mycroft…..John glared at his shoes as he laced them up quickly. That great pompous git. John still held the man greatly responsible for Sherlock’s fall. The man had given Moriarty everything he needed in order to destroy the consulting detective. Who the hell was Mycroft to tell him what Sherlock would or would not have wanted John to do? Besides, it no longer mattered. Sherlock was dead and had been for three years to the day.
“Also, why are there so many people here? I didn’t think there was a match tonight. Did I miss something?”
Pulling off with an obscene pop he glanced up to where John’s head was lolled back against the pillows with a blissed expression on his face. Sherlock grabbed the man’s hand and thrust it into his dark curls and positioned his mouth over the good doctor’s cock. “No gag reflex, now fuck my face.” Sherlock began sucking again in earnest as he felt John’s fingers tighten in his hair while groaning and rolling his hips forward.
Greg pulled out his phone but didn’t get as far as hitting the message icon on the home screen before Sally’s voice assaulted his ears.
The horror shifted out of the face of the man and morphed into curiously shocked.
“Boss!”
John then began to move tortuously slowly, his cock barely grazing his prostate with each stroke. He needed more. He had to have more. He needed John to pound into him and he needed it now! As if John had read his mind he changed his angle and began to pick up speed. Each thrust striking spot on Sherlock’s prostate. He snapped his hips viciously as he let himself go and enjoy the tight heat of Sherlock.
“What were you doing up there?” The silver haired DI was at such unease at the entire situation he was in he didn’t know what to do. Sherlock always kept his walls up around everyone except him and John. Greg felt like he had fallen into the Twilight Zone.
"Sherlock is going to keep watch, aren't you Sherlock?"
“Not a day passed by that I didn’t miss you. That I didn’t turn around to tell you something and realize you were gone. I did what I had to do to save you John. I have loved you with all my heart for quite some time. I
The smaller man looked up at the DI through his sandy lashes as he licked a stripe up Greg's cock, moaning obscenely against the flesh. The vibrations sent a shiver down the silver haired man's spine as the doctor pulled his foreskin back and twirled his tongue slowly around his glans, his eyes never leaving Greg's before sliding his mouth down until the DI’s cock was hitting the back of his throat. The doctor began working in earnest; bobbing up and down the DI’s length, humming rhythmically as he worked.
The good doctor had spent the first year after the fall mourning and making desperate attempts to convince the world that Sherlock had been real. That the man was not a fraud, and that he believed in Sherlock Holmes with all his might. Part of him desperate for something to cling to, because none of it felt real at first. But slowly as the first year and a half passed and Sherlock’s name was cleared; all his cases proved in their legitimacy and Lestrade no longer on probation, the gravity of it all began to settle on John.
Sherlock was shocked himself now. No one ever thought he was amazing, whenever he made his deductions he usually got a slap or punch to the face and or gut. “Really?”
Greg instantly pushed his office chair as far into his desk as he could manage with John underneath it as Sally walked into the room nonchalantly, looking at Sherlock puzzled at the consulting detective (who had just brought his belstaff over his lap to hide his own erection). “What’s the freak doing here?” Her voice was laced with the usual distain when she spoke to or about sherlock.
“Mycroft was here a little while ago. You know when you sleep you sleep like the dead. I woke up and thought this was just a dream, that I had accomplished what I had set out to do and was finally with you on the other side.”
Silently he stared at the distorted reflection of himself until steam began to fill the bathroom before stepping into the scalding hot stream of water. He made no attempt to cool the temperature, the pain of the heat didn’t matter. He just stood and let the liquid cascade over his hair and flesh to mingle with the tears that were steadily flowing from his eyes as he silently wept. He knew that today was going to be difficult. He knew that it was going to hurt. Firmly he pressed his hand to his chest over his heart; the muscle pumping the blood through his body as it always had. Who would have thought that he would come to despise that one muscle so much for all the pain it caused him to feel. He makes no attempt to clean himself or wash his body. Only standing there in the shower with his forehead pressed against the tile til the water had begun to run cold.
A lump filled John’s throat as he stood on the pavement where he stood exactly three years ago and stared up at the roof of St. Bart’s Hospital. The exact spot where his best friend had stood and said goodbye before leaping to his death. His best friend whom he had…still...loved with all his being, but was too frightened to say the words in fear of damaging what they already had in their friendship. Now that he thought back to it he should have just said those three words to that marvelously mad man. What if he had just said how he felt and it could have been the thing that changed his mind? What if all he needed was to know that he was loved? That he was wanted? That someone believed in him completely?
The blonde hopped off him and set about taking off his boots and tossing them before pulling off his jeans and vest to reveal a pair of tight red pants, and climbing up the bed to settle himself on the pillows. His arousal was apparent in his pants where a damp spot had begun to develop at the head of his cock where…..wait a minute… was that? Sherlock looked up at John’s face and was met with a smug grin as he realized the taller man was thinking. Immediately interested Sherlock scrambled between the doctor’s legs and pulled the pants down off his hips, and off his legs throwing them over his shoulder.
Sherlock refused to turn around to look at his brother; certain that he would be wearing a smug look.
The DI opened his eye and raised his brow in question. "Punished?"
Carefully John crossed the threshold into the room and sat himself on the edge of the bed and listened to the rain beat against the windows, the only sound in the flat.
“Oh don’t be a spoil sport Greg!” Sherlock shouted at him over the sound of the crowd as Anderson went over to the individuals setting up the equipment for the karaoke to begin. Greg looked at his tall lanky detective who was grinning from ear to ear at him. It was a little unsettling so he leaned into John. “Is he alright, I have never known Sherlock to want to come out to a pub with this lot, let alone stay to listen to them sing. What’s this all about. Is this some sort of punishment for him?”
“Really not too difficult to deduce. The blatant ‘R.A.M.C’ tattoo was a dead giveaway, along with the caduceus: an obvious symbol of your medical training and position in your service to the crown. As for the ‘ex’ military part…you have a large scar on your left shoulder. From the way that it is exploded outward and the way that it has healed I would say you were hit by a sniper in your service, which would most definitely have injured you to the point of honorable dismissal from her majesty’s army.”
“Trust me, I wouldn’t trade life with you for the world. You won’t be rid of me anytime soon.”
Goosebumps broke out all along the younger man’s flesh as John’s mouth moved across each of his arse cheeks and kissing an open mouth onto his entrance. Sherlock jumped at the sudden sensation. No one had ever done this to him, it was so filthy, and wrong, but for some reason with John it felt right.
Setting the ice rag on the rolling tray beside the bed he took hold of John’s frail hand and took in the changed man. This was not the same man he left behind three years ago. Where John used to be strong and covered with compact muscles he was now thin and emaciated; causing the hospital gown to hang loosely on his body.
Also, no beta. Just me typing it out. All spelling, grammatical and punctuational errors are my own. But I kind of dont care. XD
Both men gasped as they tried to catch their breath as they lay bonelessly on the bed; not caring that they were laying in a puddle of Sherlock’s cum. Both their bodies completely drained of their strength they could barely turn themselves on their back while their chests heaved. After a moment of silence Sherlock let his head flop to the left so he could stare at John who was watching him.
John’s mouth moved back and began to lick around the puckered entrance softly, teasing at the flesh and making Sherlock shiver and relax into the feelings. He focused on the hot breath on his flesh as John’s tongue began to stiffen and push through the tight ring of muscle and wriggling as he moaned. He continued to press his tongue in and out of Sherlock before pulling away and sliding a saliva slicked finger into him.
lose you. I can’t, If you were to pass from this world I would follow you soon after. I cannot survive another day without my doctor.”
Both men were moaning and panting as the sound of flesh slapping against flesh filled the hot and humid air of the bedroom. Sherlock clutched at the headboard with white knuckles when John’s hand found his way in a tight grip to his hair, he could feel his release on the edge again; but couldn’t quite tip over. He needed to stroke himself, but he was determined to obey John’s instructions of keeping his hands to himself. His heart beat pounded in his ears as John continued to fuck him, and tears began to leak from his eyes while his nerves hummed in desperate pleasure.
John sat in silence as he gazed out the window of the cab, not paying attention to the buildings or people that they passed by; completely oblivious to the cabbies attempt at small conversation until they pulled up to the curb. With his chest tight he carefully counted out the exact amount due and handed the cash to the driver before climbing out.
John chuckled “Watson. John Watson.” There was a hint of something sad in the doctor’s eyes as he spoke, turning his gaze to the ceiling. Everything in Sherlock was screaming at him to never let this man leave.
“Problem?” John asked with concern in his voice, and Sherlock just shook his head silently.
“Don’t ever leave me again and you won’t have to be without me.” John’s voice was a shaky whisper as he spoke, pulling Sherlock’s face from his chest and the younger man’s face in his hands; stroking his thumbs across the prominent cheekbones. Slowly he leaned forward and brought his lips to Sherlock’s and kissed him gently.
Every single one of Sherlock’s nerve endings were on fire. Every touch of John’s flesh across his own sent his head swimming. The shorter man was swirling his tongue around the head of his prick; flicking at the slit and dipping beneath foreskin. He let out an obscene moan as John took a breath and swallowed him all the way down so his nose was nestled in the dark curls at the base of him; swallowing around him so his throat muscles massaged the tip.
“Why is this place so crowded? There isn’t a match on!” the DI shouted over the noisy crowd at Donovan and Anderson who were smirking at each other.
Sherlock simply swiveled his chair to face the woman narrowing his eyes at her. “If you must know Donovan, I came to assist Lestrade with some of the paperwork regarding the case about the twins today.”
Everything he had done, he did to save John. To save the man he loved more than anything else in the world. But things had gone too far. Why couldn’t he have just allowed Mycroft to take out Moran for him? Why couldn’t he have put aside his need for up close and personal revenge on the sniper assigned to John?
Sherlock’s heart clenched as he listened to this man he hardly know speak. “What was it about this man that made them feel so connected?”
“Hello Molly.” John took a deep breath and smiled weakly at her with sad red eyes.
At John’s line he turned and winked at the silver haired DI who started to blush right away as the pair started singing in unison together.
John started up the second part of the duet.
“I’m fine.”
“Don’t worry about the paperwork boss. I can take care of it for you. I don’t need to be home tonight, and you clearly need some sleep.”
"You should get inked Greg." Johns fingers lightly traced the tips of the DI's thighs languidly." A nice big wolf that wraps around. That would be lovely. The symbol of the great protector you are." The doctor gently pulled at the waistband of Greg's pants until he could tuck it behind the older man's balls, leaving Greg thick and heavy erection bare to the personal office.
Said doctor shook Andersons’ hand before leaning in to Greg’s ear and whispering. “You didn’t think the two of us would let you go out without us. The yarders may not know about our little arrangement, but like hell I’m gonna let some drunk woman in this bar try to take our man home. Besides, Sherlock took great joy in picking out his tightest trousers to wear tonight to particularly torment you.” The shorter man patted him on the back before pulling away and placing an order with the waitress.
Gingerly Sherlock crawled up into the bed beside John and wrapped his body around the smaller man to lay his head on his chest and listen to the steady heartbeat that sounded within; softly drifting back to sleep with John in his arms…..
John pulled back slightly and grinned with a glint in his eyes. “Oh would you now?” The man was standing rod straight as both he and Sherlock stopped dancing and stared at each other; Sherlock’s chest was beginning to heave as he attempted to ease his breathing as arousal strummed through him. This muscled hunk of a man just smirked, running a hand down Sherlock’s bare front and over his trouser; dragging his thumb along the younger man’s hard cock’s outline.
“Up Next we have Sherrrr…..Sherlock and John.”
“So John…”
“Four shots of whiskey please?” the busty waitress flashed her best smile at the ex-soldier, no doubts in an attempt to flirt and hopefully to get a better tip.
Sally rounded on Sherlock, pointing her finger at him. John chose that moment to take all of Greg once more, but instead of drawing back up he kept his nose nestled in the silver hair at the base of the DI’s cock and began to swallow around the heavy length bringing Greg, teetering on the edge of release.
John reached his other hand hand around and took Sherlock’s leaking member in his hand and whispered in the younger man’s ear. “Come! Come for me Sherlock! Paint the sheets with your come!”
John huffed out a bitter laugh as he ran his hands up his lover's calves to his thighs. "He's not allowed any action," the doctor murmured against the soft flesh of the DI's inner thigh and placed a gentle kiss there. "He's being punished."
Greg carefully herded his lovers towards his car til they were well out of sight of the rest of the yarders and gave John and Sherlock a nice long snog before urging them into the car; holding onto Sherlock’s face a bit longer afterwards. “You two were bloody brilliant you were. I loved that so much.”
The mundane is used to give junior agents something to cut their teeth on, and the important is used to give their seniors something to subtly brag about. When the crown wishes a task to be carried out quietly, there are tried and true teams to call upon, and when the government wishes to keep certain actions from the crown, there is a little black book to consult. And sometimes, when there can be no ripples after a deed is done - no payments shuffled about, no records expunged - Mycroft visits his little brother.
This, right here, is an excellent example of the extraordinary kindness of John Watson. He likes to start his stories from the beginning, plod his way through the events in chronological order, and put the denoument at the end where it naturally belongs. But he spoils this tale by beginning at the end, to save his audience from any unnecessary anxiety.
“Not very long at all, I’m afraid.” Sherlock then dissolves into an extended giggle fit, then straightens up in surprise once he realizes what he’s doing. “Oh, mine just kicked in.”
But a drowning man would clutch at a straw, and  an overwhelmed John Watson would politely ask a dying man if he wanted a  seat, if he couldn’t think of anything else to say.
Sherlock eagerly dives in under John's fond gaze, unboxing his new phone and case. Both are a sleek, shiny black as suspected - John and his unconscious bias wouldn't have actually ordered Sherlock a hot pink phone - but the engraving on the case brings him to a halt.
Sometimes it's easier, but harder.

John got up on his knees and pressed an ear to the door, then with a sigh, his forehead.
were dating already!!”
John blinks.

"One twenty," he blurts. "Everything. I want everything with you."

"Think of it this way," Marcus says calmly, which just makes John all the more irritable. When you throw a stone into a pond, you want to at least see a splash and get some ripples. Marcus Hughes is just...oobleck.
...and what will happen to the haven, once he leaves it.
John does not return to Eleanor's office. He stops showing up at Marcus's, too, and refuses to return the receptionist's calls about his missed appointments.
Those piercing eyes cut back  to him, flitting over his face and form, probably gathering data in  order to fill out a checklist titled “25 Signs that Your Flatmate is  Sincere, Not Just Humoring You”. Results apparently to his liking,  Sherlock nodded and drew breath to speak.
. And he’s so piteously confused and tired and sad but also grateful and amazed and glad. He feels horrifically close to an unpardonable outburst of sentiment, except that he simply doesn’t have the energy to even get started.
He stops trying to think.
John, predictably, storms out.
"Just computer work," Sherlock scoffs, piqued at John's attention focused elsewhere. "Hates crowds and dirt and everything useful for data gathering."
John laughs and waves a bag of spinach at him.
He spends more days out of the office than in. He lingers, too, at his destinations, accepting dinner and drink invitations, spending nights at hotels instead of forcing every meeting into a single day so that he can get in and get out and get away. Sometimes he tells his current bodyguard to let a sultry, slinky stranger join him at a table, drape herself over him at a bar, even lure him into one of the private rooms of a club. Once in a while, he'll pick out and pick up a tall, slender man, and put up the privacy screen in the sedan after telling the driver to do a few rounds of the city.
He prides himself on his maturity and self-control for five days, and then realizes that this unusual patience was only a product of the fatigue he's experiencing after two years operating at critical threat level, and more damage to his transport - both chronic and acute - than any one person could reasonably expect to survive. Weeks of chemically enforced and emotionally manipulated bedrest and the near-constant attendance of a hypervigilant physician have done wonders for the outright damage and nerve pain, but the bulk of his energy is being spent on continuing to heal, and he simply hasn't had anything in reserve to spend on fidgeting.
"Eighty-seven," Sherlock says, glad of the dim lighting that helps hide his blush as he voices some rather intimate wishes. Though with John now pressed so close, it's probably no secret that he's gone all flushed and feverish. "I'd wanted to know if you'd be amenable to showing me how to pleasure you with my mouth, by demonstrating on me. And ninety-seven was 'press me up against one of the walls in our flat and snog me senseless'."
Sherlock tips his head up to the ceiling, needing a nice, plain, distraction-free drawing board on which to do some hasty calculations.
His appetite comes to life with a slavering roar, and during the first few bites he's actually plotting up ways to ransack the kitchen later for a tin of beans or a packet of crisps. He slows down after devouring the yolk, however, and the last two bites cost him some effort. Sherlock sets down his crumby plate with regretful relief, content for now and utterly disinterested in anything more to eat. Even his cup of tea looks too heavy and far away to bother with, and he lets it remain on the tray.
, exactly, he was right about.
. Not the blonde, not a woman at all, but the man who lied to him and left him and still needs cue cards for ordinary social interactions.)
"How do you feel?"
(That is singularly unhelpful, thank you John. How is he supposed to solve a case without any details?)
26.	Drag your fingertips across my shoulders as you walk past
“Feed me honey toast.” (Though that might have just been Sherlock being Sherlock, and not part of the experiment.)
The cost of such a two year mission as he's just completed and somehow managed to survive. It seems he's been set back to factory defaults, capable of only the minimum necessities of living.
“Is it because you love me?”
"Call 999!"
"And you are William..."
Making a mental list of all the things he could do with said phone distracted Sherlock enough that he stayed quietly downstairs instead of shouting snidely delivered portents through John's door of how the evening could and likely would go wrong, proving that once again Sherlock was right and John should just stay home.
"She wasn't you, but it was just so much worse this time; I knew I wasn't going to run into you in the morgue. I suddenly felt like if I didn't take this opportunity to move on, I never would. I'd just drown."
(...later.)
giving the oft-times self-destructive detective everything that he asked for. To shout and fight and storm because Sherlock was worth the effort and exertion and exhaustion.
And lying in John's bed.
He suffers through some exercises John has prescribed in order to keep his limbs and ligaments limber, has a catheter he hadn't even realized was there removed, and dutifully memorizes the Manoski and Bristol rating scales to assist in charting his recovery. The patient's good behavior is rewarded by the attending physician with a cup of tea (which Sherlock suspects is decaffeinated but thoroughly enjoys all the same), a perfunctory trim with an electric shaver, a sponge bath which he would have rather skipped, and a dry shampoo and thorough brushing-out that more than makes up for the cool and clinical bath.
