Had he heard him? "I didn't mean it like that", Castiel defended himself, talking both of them out of this idea. "I just meant, this moment is nice." It was easier to live without love, so he had done for the longest while. Being alone and free was an advantage whenever a hunter came to town, whenever Castiel needed to uproot his life again. But the past couldn't dull the person in front of him, not only a nice body for sex but Dean's childish humor was contagious, his bravery in a fight was inspiring and his caring nature couldn't be drowned in beer. This moment was nice indeed.
"Hey Castiel", he started his prayer, voice hoarse, "I, uhm … I don't want you to come to the workshop anymore. I don't want you to watch me anymore. I don't want you as my guardian angel. So, if I need to fill out a form or something, just mail it … Goodbye?"
Another pause, longer this time. Shallow breathing, sometimes interrupted by the wish to speak. What could they say? They were talking about betraying their family, their brother and lover. There were no words for that. Just shame and anger. Finally Sam said flatly: "He wouldn't get much help anyway. They wouldn't help him, they rather he rot in a cell ... or worse."
Another shove. No budge. "Go!" He threw his fist into his lover's face. This monster needed to die, no matter the cost.
"I'm in the middle of something here", Dean explained and gestured at his car. "If you wanna stare at my ass some more, be my guest." The jeans shorts were the perfect attire for that and admittedly a little wasted since he had no one to give them some attention.
There had to be a way to make this stop. It was already hard to leave someone you liked, didn't need to make it harder by showing him how sad Cas was. They could only share a moment, not a life. Besides, Dean hadn't much life to share. A safety measure so he couldn't lose much if a hunt went wrong, which it inevitably would. This was how every hunters life ended even if Cas rescued him, only difference then he had something to lose.
"No, you don't!" Castiel shoved him backwards. "You need to come to yourself, that's what you need to do."
Admittedly, it didn't stop being creepy even if Dean found the highly concentrative expression on Castiel's face cute. A combination no one else could pull off quite as well.
A shiver ran up Dean's spine. The same feeling when Cas had said those three words, too sincere and too comfortable. Would he block this bar's door as well? Would he come and rescue Dean again? Not that he needed it - absolutely didn't - but the thought of someone who cared was nice. Not something Dean could afford.
But the body next to him tensed again, more even and the breathing stopped for a second before it quickened. Dean reached out to the edge of the bed, wiggling his body out from Castiel's hug.
"How did you hide it all for so long?", Castiel asked in a hushed tone. Gently stroking Dean's cheek. "Don't hide yourself from me."
"Don't you know nothing?" Why was Cas so clueless about all the normal things? "You're supposed to come after me, but you didn't." The bond was here, right? They obviously liked each other too much.
Moreover, Castiel was glad to be here, to feel the other's presence, had been looking forward to this moment. And it stung that Dean didn't feel the same. Another discovery echoed in his chest: Love.
Dean scowled. "I don't need saving." He didn't deserve saving, especially not from Castiel. He could still feel the cold, tender lips on his own. Guilty conscience. "Where's my gun? And the torch?" Dean looked around feverishly. "I'ma kill this fucking monster!" He had to annihilate the sign of his own betrayal.
If only anyone could do that ... Her hand on his cheek was tender, soothing, blissful. Once he had felt this way with Castiel, that seemed a long time ago. Why was he fighting his family? Tired he closed his eyes. Just one moment ...
Now the figure moved, Castiel stepped closer. Brows furrowed serious as he peeked through the driver's side window.
Who was the creep now, eh? Dean was an easy lay, so easy in fact he'd go down on something that didn't exist. Desperate much? He huffed about himself, shaking his head. Sam told him to have some standards when it came to flings, more so telling him that Dean should try a serious relationship for a change. Nah.
The cold shiver that ran down his spine and the raised hair in Dean's neck became a welcome reminder, something to trust in. Castiel was with him. But not inside him, yet. So he put his want into the chorus of the song.
A little light emanated from the palm of Castiel's hand lying over the broken wood and little creaking noises were audible. The cue stick was whole again. Then he bent down to pick up the ball that was rolling away.
A deep sigh. "You know we can't." Sam's tone was weak but firm. A long gulp and the sound of fluid against glass.
Dean let out a frustrated puff of air. "You're becoming human because of me. Because we talk about movies and drink beer together and stuff like that. I make you human."
Hot, burning pain shot through his head and bit paralyzing into his limbs. Black light spread through his eyes. "Fuck ...", only a whisper of distress.
The door of his old Lincoln Continental creaked as it opened, masking Castiel's sigh. Of course he knew running away from the Bond was futile, yet he was about to try. Of course Dean wasn't the only one afraid to be truly known by another person, after all being alone was safe and spontaneous and simple. Being with another person was not.
The wall clock showed two in the afternoon, strangely Castiel hadn't visited Dean's workshop today. The angel had made a habit out of coming by in the early morning hours, maybe throwing out a comment about the news that clearly wasn't from a human, and he'd watch Dean work on a car for a while. Patiently, silently watching.
Suddenly, a cold shiver ran up Dean's spine. Something dark and ominous raised the hairs on his neck. "… Are you watching me?" He didn't dare to look over his shoulder.
His chest echoed with grief and pain that wasn't his, not helping matters. He could see blood on his hands that wasn't really there, knowing how Dean handled emotions: By bottling them up until they burst out violently and with too much cursing. Even this he was missing for some reason, Castiel sighed frustrated. Love sucked.
"Because", Dean answered, undecided if this handsome creep was funny or frightening, "Angels don't exist. Obviously. They're just a fairy tale." One his mom used to tell him back when he was little. If angels actually existed, she wouldn't be dead right now.
Dean shook his head. Ridiculous! A hunter died early and bloody, that came with the job. A home didn't. Besides, if Cas wanted a companion, romantic or magical, he probably already would have one. He had lived a century or two at least, Dean was sure from the way Cas spoke, so there been plenty of opportunity.
Dean scoffed. "Read a book." So he threw the one in his hands over to his lover. Castiel barely caught it.
"It's freaking not", Dean cursed and fell out of the bed, a low thump as he hit the floor. Rustling in the darkness. "Don't say that. Don't say any of that!", his voice grew loud and frantic. "This is just sex, understand? I gotta go."
As well as were them. His suspicion now on his family. Betrayal pierced through his flesh. They talked big about helping him, but them second guessing him did the opposite. How could he trust them in a fight, when they wanted him gone? Family wasn't what it used to be.
"Yes, for your protection", Castiel repeated. "We care about you. I care about you, a lot. I can see how this is tearing you apart."
A brief nod. "Then trust me. She's just a girl, a human, innocent girl. You won't save anyone, when you kill her. You'll only hurt people. I don't want anyone hurting anymore. And I know, neither do you." Castiel's voice was quiet but strong, a comfort in the damp basement.
Right, of course not. Dean stole a long, wishful gaze. It was still the safest bet, given the stupid shit Evangelists spouted. Who really knew if Heaven was like that or not? "You'll love Chastity."
He clenched his fist. Dean turned away from the kitchen door and left. Hearing Castiel like this was hard to swallow and no amount of beer would help with that. Beer only helped with sleep, sometimes.
Cas grew frustrated, his brow furrowed. "Would you listen for a second? We kissed once, ages ago. Her flirting is just teasing, it's a joke."
The soft rumble of the motor purred on the road, the rising sun shined on the black hood and Dean's eyes only saw vastness. For days barely a soul crossed his path, equal parts intentional and exhausting. He couldn't see another human, afraid that he couldn't keep the sadness bottled up but sure that isolating himself was healthy.
"I apologize for being late today", Castiel said as he stepped into the shop, a deep frown on his face.
Dean sipped his cold coffee. Exhausted he watched the door of the diner, waited for the waitress to leave. Maybe he found out more when he saw her lair. Often there were numerous clues on the who and what and how in the nest of a monster. The same way a human home told all kinds of secrets.
But they both had. A location spell later and they'd spent another night together. And another one. And another one. Then they started texting and calling each other almost everyday, mostly Dean telling him that he found the best cheeseburger in the state or what Led Zeppelin's best song was. They should've seen. Now they paid the painful price of a broken heart because they couldn't have more than a quick hook-up.
Dean bared his teeth like an animal. "Monsters need to die." His voice dark with killing intent. "And you have to stay out of my way."
A different town, a different motel room, a different night he couldn't sleep. Castiel stared into the TV but the colorful images didn't distract him, only reminded him that Dean liked this show. That's why it was on in the first place. The burger was growing stale next to him, his appetite gone. For the hundredth time he browsed through the pages of the Liber Confidebat, searching for a way to break this. There was always a counter to anything magic, nothing was absolute.
Not that he had thought Cas to be this much of a slimy prick. But Dean had seen stranger things happen.
“Dean, are you sure this is what you want? You can be sealed with Ash but you do not have to be sealed to me.” Cas breathed. Dean looked at him and frowned, a deep consternated look that made the lines between his eyes bunch up. “Yeah, Cas if I didn’t mean it I would have never asked. Why?  You don’t want to marry me, be with me forever?” Dean asked with an edge of panic in his voice. “Of course I do Dean, I just wanted to make sure, and yes Dean Winchester I too will marry you.” Cas replied. Then Cas grabbed dean by the collar of his shirt and pulled him down in a heated kiss and applied just a touch of his grace into it to really seal the deal.
Sam and Eileen saw his brother and his future sister in law signal for them to monitor the video surveillance, while they went to check the doors. When Eileen and Sam looked at the night vision camera that was located just outside the main entrance to the bunker, they saw a familiar figure wind whipping through his coat, wet and standing so still he very could have been a statue. Sam snapped his head to look at Eileen as she made a loud strangled noise, he looked to her and mouthed, “Cas?” She quickly signed “God, I hope it’s him.” Ash had stopped so quickly she looked like she had hit a wall. She looked at them and yelled the angel’s name, then she was in motion again. Dean paused for a second but was quickly running to catch up with her.
Sam saw Dean raise his hands in a peace offering and waited for Ash to move before he kneeled down to untie Cas, who had a busted lip and a black eye. Dean looked at Cas as he sat up and said “Cas, Angel, I’M sorry it was wrong for me to hit you, I am just so damn mad and hurt. Why did you leave us? It just about killed Ash, I was afraid I was going to lose her too.” Dean cried. “Dean, I know what I did was right but I went about it the wrong way. I will know I will have to spend a lot of time and effort to gain your trust.” Cas replied. Ash was right there beside Cas and once again wrapped her arms around him, crying happy tears. “Well, we can discuss this shortly but right now, let’s get you cleaned up and all of us changed out of these wet clothes, I am freezing!” “Of, Course My Angel.” Cas breathed, his nose buried deep into Ash’s wet hair, a look of hope bright on both their faces. Dean however was still scowling through his tears as they walked back to their room.
Dean opened the passenger’s side door of the Impala for Ash and promptly closed the door behind her as she put on her seatbelt. She knew Cas felt it ridiculous that Dean would not even consider starting the car without them buckling in. He was an angel after all and would not be seriously hurt, thus Ash would not be either but Dean INSISTED. As he climbed into the driver’s seat and put on his own belt she wondered if he was even too mad to tell Cas and her apart, but after about ten minutes  of traveling in silence  he cleared that up when Dean growled at her. “Let me speak with Castiel!” She looked at Dean and simply said, “No.” What do you mean no? I want to speak with the Angel, you know the one willing to sacrifice you and him both, to leave me alone, I can’t handle, Ashby, I can’t, Sam would have to burn my body right beside yours.”
Dean had almost caught up with Ash as she flung open the front door, the cold rain blowing in hard and then she stepped into the darkness, gun drawn. Dean was right behind her and nearly ran over her because she had stop dead in her tracks. Standing in front of her about 6 feet away was a man with his hands up, it was dark and Dean could not quite see his features but Dean could tell two things, he was wearing a khaki colored trench coat and had short, very dark hair. Lightning struck across the clouds and illuminated the man’s face. Full lips, square jaw and blue eyes, this man looked like Cas or rather Jimmy Novak. Dean thought he was going to throw up. Ash was standing squared off and aiming her gun at the man. “Keep your hands up move really slowly, Dean could you please help our guest here get inside, give me a minute I will be right in.” Ash instructed.  Dean gave her a look that told her that he was not going to let her stay out here by herself. “Bubbies here with me, I have to throw up.” Sure enough his mountain of a brother was right beside her, shot gun raised, so she felt safe lowering her own weapon. Once the safety was on her gun again, she put it in her waist band and bent over and vomited just as she said she would.
He and Sam had immediately started looking for this Ashby Mullins, it wasn’t hard to find her actually. Cas did not lay low, going to and from work daily Thursday through Monday by bus or by walking there. It was only about 3 miles and on the days that Cas walked they would just leave an hour earlier to get there on time.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, Ashby could be seen at the local market or taking walks in the local parks. Staring at insects, trees, and other people. Dean knew it was Cas but stayed back and kept his distance, and told Sam to do the same thing. They had been following this new Cas around for three weeks when Sammy finally convinced him that it was time to see this thing through and find out once and for all if this person who claimed to be Cas was in fact their friend.
Cas sat down on the edge of the bed that took up the middle of the bedroom that Cas had called his own for several years now. Dean grabbed the chair from the desk in the corner of the room, flipped it around and straddled the back of the chair between his knees and sat down directly in front of Cas. They sat there like that staring at each other for what could have been hours but in reality was about five minutes. Cas once again cleared, their throat and began” Dean, We have both died multiple times, we both have come back multiple times and every time we did we were there waiting for one another you and I. We have a profound bond, my mark on your soul, your mark on my grace.”
At first she had as hard time shutting down the ability, when walking in a crowded grocery store or bar, it was enough to almost floor her at first. Cas was there at first to help her cope in those times, shielding her mind with his presence and his grace. However, it had been months now since Cas had to intervene and even though she was proud of her ability to be more self-sufficient in the field, she missed that protective presence at times. Dean also was a lot more at ease having her on cases, knowing she knew how to fight and how to use her powers well. Physically, even though she was now 42 years old she had not been in this good of shape since high school and her days of softball and weight lifting. This being said she was still very curvy and had a lot of softness still over all that muscle. AS for her looks could still pass for a woman in her early 30’s and did on a lot of cases. She often wondered if her youthful appearance didn’t have to do with Cas’s angelic influence but she never thought to ask and Cas never mentioned anything about it.
Dean felt like a piece of him had been ripped away again, why had Cas left? Why would he, did someone snatch him away from Ash, from him? Did he not want them anymore, but what about last night, their time in the cabin between the worlds, did it cause Cas to bolt? These thoughts swirled through his head, Ash and him clinging to each other like a life line. Dean hears Ash, give a small, weary laugh, “Dean Sweetie, you still are about the loudest thinker I have ever met.” Dean looked at her, so she still had telepathy even with Cas gone. He felt this pit in his stomach, he was trying, seriously trying not to freak out, trying not to lash out, he wanted to but the person he wanted to lash out at wasn’t here.
With this they had arrived at the bunker and all piled out of the car, Sam ran around the car and grabbed Cas, to which Cas was bracing for a fight but to his surprise, the younger of the brothers wrapped Cas in the biggest bear hug imaginable. Sam was squeezing so hard that it took all the lung power that Ash’s lungs would muster to wheeze, “Can’t breathe, human still needs to breathe!” Sam relaxed the hug just a little bit, at that point Cas then threw their arms around the middle of Sam and gave him a long hug back.
She looked down at her long cream colored dress, and thought of how Cas had wanted the purest white dress they could find but he settled for this one after seeing it on Ash shortly after she gave birth to DJ. Oh DJ, her special little tyke! She wished her son James could meet him, he would have adored the green eyed, light brown haired baby. DJ was so much like James was when he was little, he never set still, not even when he was sleeping. Not even in the womb, every night from the time she felt that tiny body start moving within her she would feel him wiggling and rolling around. The stretch marks that had disappeared when Cas had taken her as a vessel, had been replaced with new ones but Ash didn’t mind. Dean and Cas didn’t either, they both swore it only made her sexier because she had carried and gave birth to their son.
Dean looked at Ash and said, “My Heart, if you don’t get out of those wet undies you are going to get sick. Here are some socks and sweats for you too, put them on, please.” “Thank you Daddy,” She said as she patted Dean’s hand, then she looked at Cas and said. “Papa you need to get dressed as well. I know if you do have any grace left it isn’t much and fading fast. You spent it all to rebuild your body didn’t you?” “Yes, Ashby, I used it all to get my body back and then to get back here to you and Dean. I am once again all but human right now. You called my Papa? Why?” Cas questioned cocking his head to side like a curious bird. “Well, Cas” Dean began, “You are going in this child’s life, right? Well, I guess the better question is do you still want to marry me and Ash?” Cas’s face lit up, “Oh, yes more than anything! That is why I did this, so you, Ash and I could be together, all three of us together on this plane, not relying on Ash and I being able to tether us to the cabin between the worlds. So that Ash could live and not just fade away because I want to exist. So that you and Ash could have chance to conceive a child.” “Well then,” Dean added, “the baby will call me Daddy and you Papa, if that is ok with you?” “That is wonderful Dean!” Cas shouted, standing up quickly and grabbing him in a huge hug.
It was a lone vampire that was wreaking havoc on local teenagers some 40 miles down the road from the bunker, he knew Ash could handle it. Sam was bringing them all back without any major injuries. Ash and Cas did get a black eye and a busted lip from getting popped too hard by a chair that the vamp had thrown at them but Ash assured Sam she was just fine. Sam and Ash were starved afterwards and so they stopped by a dinner on their way home. This is where Dean caught up with them. They were all in such a good mood that Ash had convinced Cas to wait to heal their body on the way home, so their round, smiling face was a mess when Dean walked into the diner.
Sam was the first to stir out of bed the next morning. He had not come home right away after the diner but had come home in time to hear the ruckus coming from Dean’s room, then Dean’s bathroom and finally Cas and Ash’s bedroom. Well, he figured that he might as well start making breakfast because the other human’s in the house were probably going to be ravenous after a night FULL on exertion.
After Dean got out of the shower and dressed for the day it was only 0630 so he thought he might as well get some coffee going and cruise the internet for a case. After all they were all hunter’s here and despite preparing for the wedding, they had nothing productive to do. Well, Dean thought to himself, making love to his fiancés all day long is highly productive but not in the traditional sense. They needed to work, so they needed a case, so research it was.
“The three of you, rely on each other, love each other, support each other and comfort each other, if you do that there is nothing you as an eternally bonded group cannot accomplish. Now comes the part where each of you proclaims your own vows, Ashby your grooms insisted that you go first.” Gideon finished.
At first Dean wasn’t sure how deep to take the kiss only placing his lips against the lips of the blue eyed, brown hair individual before him. Dean knew Cas had just told him how he felt but there was Ash to think of as well. This was still her body after all and he did not want force her into anything. It was with that thought on Dean’s mind, Dean heard Ash’s voice in his head, “Dean, Sweetie just show him how you feel, it is one of the reasons I am here. I want him to be happy.” Dean didn't even think to ask how Ash was able to speak to him this way, not until much later anyway. However, Dean took what she said and deepened the kiss, moving his lips with Cas’s in a slow soft motion. Cas let a small happy moan escape and parted their lips slightly. This was all it took to convince Dean to give Cas the deepest kiss he had ever given to anyone in his entire existence. Their tongues slowly but firmly sliding against one another, not waring for dominance but as equals who knew exactly how to share the same space at the same time.
Pastor Gideon gave Ashby a nod and looked at Cas and said “It’s your turn Castiel.” Castiel cleared his throat and began to speak. “Ashby I may have been created an Angel of the Lord, a holy Warrior but you are my Angel. You say I saved you but it is you who saved me. I knew love but never had the ability to fully express it until you came into my existence. I was searching for a way to get back to my family, back to Sam and Dean and you were there for me. Pastor Gideon is right, you are the spark that fused Dean and I together. So I promise you that I will always honor you, I will worship you for the amazing creature you are. I love you Ashby and no longer fear eternity because I know that my eternity is with you and our family. You are my angel, the Mother of my child and my forever.”
Sam extended his hand to shake the hand of this short, brown haired, curvy woman, he looked into her eyes and could literally feel the love and concern radiating from the cobalt eyes that matched the eyes of one of the Winchester brothers’ brother in arms. He looked down and said, “Nice to meet you Ash, I am Sam Winchester and this is my older brother Dean but, I guess you already know this.” Ash takes the offered hand and shakes Sam’s hand right back. “Her hand is so tiny, warm and smooth, like very soft leather.” Sam thinks to himself, “It must be all the handwashing she does as a nurse.” Ash replied back to Sam, “Of course Hun, Cas and I have been telling each other all about how are lives were before we met. You two are one of the big reasons when Cas asked me to “partner up” with him and not just rest peacefully insides Cas’s presence, that I said yes. You are his family, this is his home and I had to help that boy get back to his family.
As the music began to play Bobby turned to look down the two branching aisles to wait for the groom and bride to appear. Cas was the first to catch his eye, handsome and proud, with a smile of contentment on his face, walked toward him. Ash was next, she looked like a goddess her Brandy colored hair swept up in curls and her face covered by a lacy veil, the creamy colored dress making her skin glow. Bobby immediately started to choke up, tears threatening to spill over looking at his adopted daughter.
It went better than either of them imagined, he listened to Cas tell him about the place he had created for them. When Cas started talking about the time Ash and Cas had spent there alone, he got this look on his face. A look like he was not exactly happy about what he was hearing. Ash spoke to Cas through her mind, “Cas, I think he may be jealous, maybe you should try to take him there so you two can be there together. I think I can keep myself here and help you project him and you to the cabin.” “Ashby, are you sure? That would very taxing on you, so far it hasn’t weakened you much with just me and you but we don’t know what will happen if you add Dean to the mix.” Cas silently replied. “Angel, we have to try, for you and him both,” Ash insisted and Castiel relented.
After two week of calling Sam and Dean, leaving message after message, and slowly making progress crossing the country from Washington State to Kansas, Cas finally exhausted his vast knowledge of cell numbers that the boys have used in the last decade or so. All, he could do was wait and see if Sam or Dean will return a call. In the meantime, money was needed and Ash had an active compact (multi state) nursing license that was active for another few months before it would need to be renewed, so they found work at a local nursing home, because the local jail was not hiring nursing staff at the time, and Ash DID NOT DO Hospitals (“Too much ‘politicking’ and too little respect for nurses,” as she put it)!
The hunt with Eileen was taking longer than Dean had anticipated, he was getting antsy and grumpy. Three nights already away from home, away from his Heart and Soul, “Gah,” Dean thought, “I am turning into a chick.” But he could not stand being away from Ash and Cas for this long, even though he had talked to them on the phone several times a day since they had left the bunker. He had almost always, in the past, been more than fine with his nomadic life, he always wanted more but never thought it could last, not until now. He always felt at home were ever he, Sam and Cas had squatted, crashed or hide out but now he longed to be back at the bunker with his family. It was quite a realization for Dean, this hit him like a ton of bricks on the fourth morning of the hunt. Dean woke up early, he instinctively, as he had done the last few mornings, rolled over and stretched out his arm to wrap it around the soft warm figure that should be there. Of course, that body was 3 states over probably still sleeping in their own bed. So Dean got up showered and dressed for the day. He would give it a few more hours before trying to call Ash and Cas.
She looked back at Dean, his hopeful look was slowly becoming concerned, so Ash snapped her mouth shut for a second. Took a deep breath and before she could even think about it yelled, “Are you crazy, of course!” Dean put the ring on their left ring finger and jumped up to give them a fierce kiss.  He grabbed them around the waist, lifted them off of the ground and spun them around as if they weighed nothing at all. Ashby started giggling and telling Dean he needed to put them down or they were gong to hurt his back. When their feet hit the ground again Cas began talking to Ash in a rush, so fast and furious she hardly could keep up. She pulled away from Dean who had the biggest, goofiest grin she had ever seen stretched across his face and said “That’s my answer, Cas would like to speak with you now.” With that she let go of control and let Cas take over.
So with these thoughts running through my consciousness, I am listening, waiting for someone to call for help. I wait and listen and remember the days that have been, the fleeting moments with my Family and longing with every fiber of my being to return to them again. To be able to tell all of them things I never got to say, to say. Show them things I never got to show them. I want to be able to tell Dean that I love him, more than just a brother, that my whole being calls out for him. I know I may face rejection but is something I have to do. I need to do.
Sam missed the happy home that they had built here, their oasis from the rest of the world. It was a place of peace and family, away from the chaos and blood of their lives. They were hunter’s the lot of them so what they had was rare and beautiful. They fought together and for one another, for their family. “Castiel, if you are listening, get your shit together and get back here before you destroy us all!” Sam angrily prayed. Eileen and he had been out of several short hunts since Cas left but did not take cases that took them too far away from home, in case they were needed.
She reached down and palmed the front of his trousers, humming a pleasant needy sound in her throat when she realized he did want her. The Angel felt her moving them both toward the couch that sat in the cabin’s living area and gently pushed him down until he was setting down. She then gave him a hungry look and climbed up to set in his lap. The pressure and warmth of her body radiated through Castiel’s clothes and when she started moving her hips against him he nearly lost control of his senses. She broke the kiss and began nibbling Cas’s ear. He was so hard, he didn’t remember ever feeling like this before, especially not in a man’s body. Cas kissed his way down Ash’s chest, unbuttoning her blouse to expose her full, luscious breasts. She leaned him back so that she could have room to undo her bra and as she took it off she let it fall on the floor along with her top.
Just before the wedding march started Bobby was posted at the end of the main aisle waiting for both Cas and Ash, to walk them down the aisle and give them away. Bobby had never seen so many hunter’s in such a small space in his whole life but for the Winchester’s they came. Almost 100 guests of various walks of life (and species) were there for the nuptials. People that at one time or another the Winchester family had saved, fought beside or helped out in some way. It was a good day!
The exchanged their rings, very special rings each with three interlocking braided bands, rings that Bobby himself had made for his kids. Each of them had a band of silver forged from an angel blade, a band of brass formed from the casing of a bullet from The Colt and a band of iron the from the railroads surrounding the gate to Hell. All three protective metals represented the individuals wearing them, the Angel, the Hunter and the Telepath that can see spirits. When the rings were snuggly on all of their fingers. Pastor Gideon announced. I now pronounce you Man, Angel and Wife, for all time and all eternity. Get to smooching!” A shout rang up from the congregation and after along minute or two of all three of them kissing one another, Gideon last words were, “Dear friends and family I present to you Ashby Renee Winchester, Dean Winchester, and Castiel Winchester.”
They raised DJ all three of them, with the help of their extended family of course. It was not a perfect life, they were a family made up of Hunters after all. There were wins and there were loses, death and births, marriages and divorces. Don’t worry about the Winchester Thrupple though, they lived very long lives together, years happily filled with love and adventure. They even had another child that they named Maryellen Joanna Winchester, but that is a story for another time. When Ash passed way as the result of a gunshot wound at the age of 120, Dean and Castiel decided it was time for them to meet their end as well. Dean and Cas just went to bed one night, wrapped in each other’s arms and did not wake up the next morning. Their children had great grandchildren of their own by then so the funeral was a reunion of sorts, 4 generations of Winchesters were present for the pyre to be lit. Drinks and food was plentiful, sure there were some tears but mostly it was a celebration of the lives of three individuals: A rebel Angel, A Legendary Hunter and One of the Greatest Telepaths to ever walk the earth.
“Speaking of angels, there he is, Good morning Cas.” Sam said. Dean turned around and stood up so quickly that Sam was worried that he might lose his balance and land flat on his face. As soon he had his feet under him Dean was right beside the individual who was the center of his universe now. “Morning Gorgeous!” Dean greeted and them took this curvy being in his arms and kissed them for all it was worth, so much so it made Sam a little uneasy after a good minute. “My little brother here seems to think you’re Cas, take another look Sam, it’s Ash.” Dean was right of course, is was Ash but the stern look on Ash’s face had reminded him so much of Cas that he assumed that is who it was.
Ash spoke up to stop Dean from storming out the front door of the War Room. “Dean Wait, I am sorry I laughed. Please stop, don’t leave, we really need to talk about this.” Ash really did not want him running off, she felt for this beautiful, broken man. Cas had shown her all his memories of the man he loved. Because that was what was between them, a deep and profound love, that neither had ever really spoken about in those terms. She tried to put all that love, desperation and heartfelt concern into her voice as she called for Dean.
He moved kissing up her leg, over her middle and up to her breasts, his gaze never leaving hers, it was hot and pleasing at the same time. He needed her as much as she needed him right now, forever and always. He moved his body so that they were lined up, his arms braced beside her head, and then she felt him breach her warm, wet center. Another heavenly groan escaped his throat and he began to move in and out of her in a slow sweet rhythm. Kissing her all the while as she wrapped her arms under his arms and around his broad, muscular back. Oh how he filled her, oh how he moved, dipping his hips and rolling into her each time he made a stroke. She could feel another orgasm beginning to threaten to explode inside her as Dean spread her legs just a little further to increase the amount of skin on skin. The curly hairs of his pubis brushing against her sensitive pearl once again making her call his name and dig her fingers into his back. She looked into those stormy hazel green eyes and gave him a look of utter and complete possessiveness and heat. He lost control with that look, he shuddered as wave after wave of his own orgasm over took him. Calling her name as if it were a prayer.
Cas shook his head bewildered but Dean interrupted him with a kiss. A long, warm kiss. A kiss of belonging and coziness. They could be a home together.
Dean's head was buried in the engine bay of a 1967 Ford Mustang, complete with orange racing stripes. The owner was a douche insisting on picking her up this afternoon, only giving half a day to fix her. Luckily, Dean was freaking awesome at his job.
Dean then felt Ash step up next to the lady and swing their arm to hit the loud mouth. The hit lands and it lands hard, right on the red heads jaw. Dean then heard the whole bar make a collective, “ow that had to hurt”.  The red head staggered back, grabbed her jaw and then lunged for Ash. Dean was right there to stop her, giving her a look that made her stop dead in her tracks and back away with her hands up in surrender. Then the bartender yelled, “Take that out of here.” Dean saw Ash look at the man and said, “We were just leaving, come on babe.” She threw a 50 dollar bill on the bar and took Dean’s hand and started pulling him to the door.
“So what’s up?” Dean asked as he stood up, stepped over to Cas’s side and kissed the Angel full on their lips. “Well, let’s go get you a beer and we can set in our room and talk.” Cas replied. Dean swung his arms and said, “Lead the way Angelcakes, I’ll be behind you, admiring the view.” A rakish and naughty grin spreading across his handsome but grubby face. Once they were safely in their room, Cas sat on the edge of the bed and Dean plopped right down beside him. “Well Dean, Ash, I have been thinking about something for several months now. I have kept it secret from you both because I did not know if it was something either one of you wanted, but I decided after we agreed to marry you Dean that it is something I wanted very much. I am pretty sure what Ash will say but Dean what do you think about a threesome?”
Ash and Dean stayed there at the foot of the stairs for several minutes, not saying a word. It was Dean who finally broke the silence. “Ashby, um…ya know…I guess if Cas picked you to be his vessel, and..um…he obviously loves you, then I guess you must be good for him. That is all I really want for him, to be safe and home. I will um...try…not to be..um…such a douche, OK?” At that moment Cas spoke to Ash and told her that he was ready to talk to Dean again.
This from Dean's POV, he needs time to work this out, but in reality very little has changed at all.
This came in very handy in those times that one or more of them got separated from one another. Her range was getting better all the time. At first she could only hear thoughts a few rooms or maybe 6 feet over from where she was. But unfortunately she could not pick out individual background thoughts, they all had to think “really loudly” at her to get to her. Now she could hear the thoughts of everyone with in a quarter mile radius, she was able to selectively pick out different “voices” and tune into them.
Dean is the first one to move, opening the door and stepping out of the car with his hand in the right pocket of his jean jacket. He glances around, and then his face transforms, into the most brilliant smile. Green eyes surrounded by the laugh lines Cas knows so well and has adored for so long. Of course the smile does not shine in his eyes, it stops with the crinkles around them. He opens his mouth to speak, and once again Ash has to remind Cas to breathe. “Hello there Sweetheart, are you ready to take a ride? You know we have so much catching up to do.” Cas takes another step closer to the hunter and looks him dead in the eyes, squaring his posture and simply replying. “Hello Dean, yes I am.” Dean returns the look for a second and then there is a flash of confusion that comes across his face. It is a moment of almost recognition that Cas, knows to be a hopeful look, but the older hunter is a professional and quickly collects himself, opens the passenger’s side back door and holds the door while Cas climbs in.
Cas was the one who cut the umbilical cord as well, Dean was way too shaky and frankly Cas thought he might pass out at any second. Cas looked into the soul of the tiny child and saw the same supernova bright light just like his Mother and Father had but what was really surprising was that there was also a touch of angelic grace attached to the child’s soul. What was even more fascinating was it was Cas’s grace that was held in the soul of their child, so in a very real way the little boy was Cas’s child as much as Dean’s The child was not a Nephilim but something different all together. He was a human with some of the powers of an angel.  What those powers would look like when the manifested no one knew.  What Cas did know was that he had never felt as complete as when he was surrounded by Ash, Dean and holding Dean Jr. for the first time.
Ash yawned a big yawn and Dean smiling at her and did the same thing. Cas spoke to Ash, “My love you rest now, May I talk to Dean?” To which she answered him with her mind, “Of Course my Angel, I love you, thank you for giving me this.” Cas told her that she did not need to thank her, he quite enjoyed himself too and that he loved her very much. With that Ash slipped into the back ground of their combined consciousness and Cas could tell that she was content and peaceful and felt wanted, needed and loved. This made him overjoyed.
Sam had tried to get Dean to make a pie run with him, but no dice. “Sammy, no, I can’t just leave Ash, what if Cas comes back? What if something happens while I am gone and I lose her too? What if something happens to me, I can’t leave her alone? Sorry Sam?” Dean would reply. Ash had told him several times that she would be fine for a couple of hours, that she wasn’t going anywhere. Still he refused. Ash tried not to cry, she really did, she knew how hard all this was on Dean, his Angel, his love, his future husband was gone, all he was left with was this broken, fat, ugly thing that she was. He deserved so much better. God how she loved him! God how she loved Cas! How could she ever be enough for Dean without Cas? That train of thought brought her right back to sobbing uncontrollably into Dean’s arms. She could feel the silent tears dripping from his eyes as well. Running onto her back, her t-shirt was soaked to her skin with them.
Boddy looked from Cas to Dean when it was his turn to speak, Sam was standing right over his shoulder because the boy looked like he was about to drop. Dean looked at Ash and then Cas and began to stammer like the friggin’ lovable idjit Bobby knew he was. “Um, well, most of you, well, all of you know I’m not much for speeches but…I…UM,” he took a deep breath and looked once again at Ash and Cas, and continued more steadily than before. “Ash, my Heart, you have made the world a place of wonder and peace for us. I will never be alone again, I will never have to feel as if I am alone, because of you. You came into my life as a way that Cas could be with his family again but you quickly became a part of that family. Your brains, brass and beauty are amazing, and on top of that you’re sexy as HELL!” The crowd laughed heartily a moment before Dean continued, “I am the luckiest SOB ever to walk this earth because of who you are and how you love Cas and me. I promise to protect you and let you protect me, I promise to never shy away from letting you into my thoughts and feelings. I will, with every fiber of my being for all eternity show you that you are the sexiest, most beautiful, bravest, most loving woman I have ever met.”
There were times she had to literally tell him to keep his mind on track while they were on a case. She had to remind him almost daily at first not to think at her so loudly. He would huff, look sheepish or annoyed but Ash could tell he was really trying. Sam was different, having his own psychic abilities at different points in time he knew how to keep his thoughts quite. Eileen was a little louder but not overly so. She was only loud when she had to be and they all began to think shout at Ash if they needed to while on hunts. She also would talk to them with her mind when they needed her to, to keep constant contact and communication with the team. They began to affectionately call her the “Human Walkie Talkie.”
Cas set alone in his dressing tent, Gabriel had disappeared about 5 minutes ago, happily telling Castiel that his nephew was requesting an audience. Whenever Dean Jr. called Gabriel was there, he adored the little boy. So did Cas, he was his son too after all. He had been there when DJ was born. Ash had went into labor almost 3 weeks early and Dean was a mess, sweating and puffing as if he was the one birthing the child. Cas didn’t really have an grace to speak of but he did have a connection to Ash and Dean’s minds. He stood there beside the bed holding both of their hands and letting calming thoughts flow from him to his mates.
Back at the bunker, Jack reunites with his Dad Cas. Dean runs his mouth and Cas is pissed, the boys meet Ash for the first time.
Cas and Dean profess their love for one another and Cas helps Dean and Ashby get to know each other better.
The Winchester’s as a family have never had much luck in living a happy life or holding on to love for very long. Just a few years before Dean was born his Maternal Grandfather and Grandmother were killed by Azazael the yellow eyed demon. Sam and Dean’s Mom and Dad had both died, come back to life and then dies again, never really being able to lead the happy life they always wanted. The boys had both had girlfriends, lovers and friends but these individuals seemed to either die or become the Hunters’ enemies. It had been a long, hard road for them, Ash had seen it through Cas’s eyes and through her own in the one and a half year span she had been with them.
Dean ran to her, wrapping his strong arms around her and pressing her to his chest. She began to cry and shake uncontrollably. She was so scared that Dean would freak out but she had to tell him. If she could only get herself under control. She took a breath and focused on the little flitter of a heart beat she had saw on the screen earlier. She opened her eyes and stepped away from Dean and for the first time in several weeks she felt like she could breathe a little. She still felt somewhat empty inside, like her body and mind were just too big for just her to be in there but she was carrying inside her another life, another soul. She needed to pull up her big girl panties and cowgirl up.
“Ash My Heart, you never have to worry about me leaving you, even after death I will be with you, your eternal companion remember? I mean it, you are my Heart, I can’t live with a heart I can learn to live without my Soul but never my Heart.” He kissed her then, hard and needy, she poured ever feeling of need, ever feeling of wanted to be wanted, loved and cherished into her kiss. She wanted him to know how much she loved, needed, and wanted him. She moved to straddle him on the love seat, he grabbed her hips with his large, strong hands and pulled her closer to him bringing their torsos flush to one another. All she could do was hold onto him around the neck and if her life depended on it. His hands snaked under her t-shirt caressing her back and sides.
In the past he would have simply just materialized in the bunker. He knew his presence was granted, it was his home after all, but Ash insisted that he would probably scare the “bejebbus otta those boys” and she did not feel like getting the “crap beat outta her or worse.” Cas had to agree with her, she now knew as well as he did how Sam and Dean could “shoot first and ask questions later.” This is also why he didn’t just show up outside of the bunker unannounced, wearing a new face, voice and sized 9 women’s, nursing shoes.
Castiel could feel the strong arms around them, their arms wrapped around Dean’s trim waist. Cas released their arms from around Dean, and attempted to take a step back but, Dean still held on to them firmly for a second before letting them go. Cas looked up at Dean, which is something he was having to get used to, being so much shorter than him now. “If you are ready, we can talk about what our next steps will be. I am sorry Dean, I was being unreasonable as well. Sometimes Ash has to remind me of that fact,” Cas said. Dean took another step back and met Cas in the eyes, “You love her don’t you?” Dean asked. “Yes, I do Dean, she is just such a special soul, bright and warm, almost as bright as your soul was when I pulled you out of Perdition all those many years ago.”, Cas replied.
Remembering her own struggle with cancer and the memories of the life she lived in her 15 day medically induced coma. Her memories of nursing school, her first job as at Cline County Jail, working Juvie, moving to Garvin’s Harbor and starting to work at the prison. People getting sick, turning on each other. Her teenaged son dying in her arms, her husband kissing her goodbye for the last time, her little Moma shuffling towards her, she was the one who had to pull the trigger each time, she was the one who had to burn the bodies, so many bodies. Moving through life in a daze just going through the motions.
There was something kinda cute about him, like a teddybear. "I can keep you company for tonight." A deadly teddybear, though.
Dean threw his jacket on a chair. "She's a monster!" A snake monster. Gorgon? Apep? No, she lived at the water, maybe Jörmungandr? Koloowisi?
What was a little mindless fun? It didn't matter if angels didn't exist, as long as Castiel had strong hands and soulful eyes. Dean would like to explore them more and to be explored by them.
First a little rolling around the bed, then this vamp's head would roll - a two-in-one jackpot. But they never made it out the bar. Cas, of course, had to interrupt them, the little cockblock. Not that Dean recognized the habit at the time, only seeing a stranger ruining his night.
"You're all alone out here?" Most vampires lived in nests, but Dean hadn't stumbled upon one while in town. The strong smell of iron and damp earth that this man emanated told of his true being.
An echo resounding in every fiber of his body, instinctively he pulled Dean closer and kissed the back of his wonderful neck again. Castiel wasn't averse to love, he just didn't believe in it, better to enjoy the moment that was.
"The waitress needs to die." Dean looked to the counter again, the young Indian girl answered with a joyful smile and the wave of her hand. Clearly, she was a monster. Question now was, what kind of monster?
Dean sat back down at their table and took a big gulp from his beer. Nervousness fluttered around in his stomach.
He stood in the ruins of an old church, a small building of charred stone and without a roof, though its steeple still stood high. Shards of glass hung in the windows and threw colorful splodges onto the floor but the pews were all gone. Alone the stone altar filled the room. Not that he believed this was the mysterious way in which God worked. Mysterious it might be, but God's work most definitely not. A witch and a familiar were far removed from the divine. However, Castiel often found solace in places like this. Calm, focus.
"My cloaking magic failed because I lost some of my powers", Castiel explained and stepped closer. "Angels aren't supposed to enjoy watching their charges."
In a dark corner of the bar at a table sat Cas, but he wasn't alone. Him opposite sat a dark haired woman, more precisely a demon in a meat suit. Dean smelled the sulfur from here. Worse though, she was holding Cas's hand and if that jovial smile wasn't flirting, nothing was.
Now Dean veered away from himself and Castiel didn't know what to do. He could handle Dean getting lost under the hood of a car or in a bar playing pool or watching some cheap porn. He knew Dean, that was all build in. But now he buried himself in dusty, old books, searched for weird news stories and drove all across the country and for what? To kill some imaginary monsters or find stupid items to save the world from ... Castiel didn't even know from what.
Also something he could do with right now, a good fight always lifted Dean's spirits. Leaning on the bar he scanned the room, eyes roaming around the dark wood and twilight came through the windows. A handful of people here that were closing the bar with him. None were really his type, except for the drunken mood of anything goes. He could hear Cas's disapproving voice in his head and see his disapproving look, blue eyes always too intense.
A drip on his forehead. Another drip. He squinted. Dim light, damp air. He moved just barely, his body was tied to a wooden post. "Fuck", he cursed.
How did he end up in this mess?, Castiel asked himself. All he had wanted was to eradicate a vampire from this earth and now he was bonded to a familiar. In what world did this make sense?
Which made his resolve crumble a little more each day. Angels weren't supposed to enjoy earthly things, losing their magic because of it. Was Dean dooming Castiel to a worldly and mundane existence? Could he stand being responsible for that?
That night had grown promising, the someone else flirting back. A whistle as the stranger came over to him. "Your behind looks so tasty, I might bite it", the man's voice had a drawl to it.
Castiel rubbed his temple. This bond was exhausting, not only was it enough that he missed Dean but this compulsion to do things like him was irksome to say the least. They wouldn't be together even if he turned himself into the other man. This wasn't how things worked.
The muscles in the body next to him tensed and in the silence he heard intensely slowed breathing. Dean was still awake.
He only knew, he would stand with Dean. Always. He accompanied him on his self-imposed quests, supported him and tried to save him from harm. Harm he did to himself but also to others. Dean wasn't a bad person, but he needed help to find himself again.
"Made a meal outta me, and come back for more. Had to cool me down to take another round", Dean looked straight at Castiel as he sang. Please get the hint!
"That would probably be a good idea." Sam said. "I'm going to bed. Try not to be too loud tonight, okay?"
He gripped my ribs and flipped us so I once again was on bottom. He continued his thrust into my clothed ass and traced a finger down the obvious bulge in my pants. It twitched beneath his finger.
Slowly she calmed, still watching his chest for the movements afraid to look up and see judgement before she even told him what she had to.
Sam always came to his games and cheered him on even if his friends wanted to hang out. John always came to the games and cheered Dean on when he did well and yelled at him from the stands when he messed up.
Deanna led the way over to her blanket that had warmed under the sun to sit down, legs tucked under one side while she leaned on her uninjured hand. Castiel came over and took a seat right next to her, allowing her to lean against him with her pretty head on his shoulder.
Castiel stopped, not keep his hands close by her sides should she try to escape. He leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to her lips.
I woke up surrounded by a different smell. It was very pleasant and I wanted to bury myself into it, but I didn't quite know where I was, so instead I sat up and rubbed the crust from my eyes and looked around the room. I squinted my eyes, because it was familiar, but it still rang no bells.
"Hey, calm down. Don't freak out on me." Castiel said, uncertain of what to do. He just grabbed her hands and held on. "C'mon, baby girl. Take a deep breath. It's okay. Look at me." He tilted her chin up and her eyes locked on his. "Breathe with me, okay? Can you do that?"
"Didn't feel like going." He said as he shrugged and backed away from me. His eyes left mine as he went to slouch against the wall.
I snuck round the house, waiting for Dean to emerge from some dark corner. I heard little grunts coming from the back and eased that way. Dean was hopping from foot to foot as he pulled on my jeans. I leaned against the wall and smiled.
"Oh, leave her be, Angela." Mr. B said as he walked by with the next round of fireworks. "She's just threatening Deanna's boyfriend. Nothing to worry about."
"This one is pretty." Castiel commented as he held it up and examined it. He put it back and bent over to reach into my dirty clothes. His shirt rode up exposing to red strings going up over his hips.
"I don't know." She left her hand in his and looked up to face him. "Who's to say we won't break up in the next month? How can I be sure that you mean everything you say?"
I became frustrated when I couldn't get the fingers to look right on the drawing so I closed the book and pulled out my phone. I pulled up Ash's contact and texted him.
"I know. I'm a terrible klutz sometimes." She gave a small giggle. "We're going to go over there, okay? Don't give yourself a heart attack, alright, old man?"
"She's kind of interesting." Castiel said absently, eyes widening slightly when he saw her sink into the driver seat of an Impala; '67 Chevrolet Impala in black, for god's sake. "And she drives a beauty of a car."
"Stop putting yourself down, Dean. You are fucking fantastic. You are better than any other dumbass in this motherflucking school." Jo snapped.
She pulled her wrist away from his grasp and tucked it against her breast. Castiel frowned deeper and felt his eyes sting.
"Next time I am not telling you a thing. We're just gonna go and you won't know till we get there." Castiel threatened. "Humor me this once, Deanna, please?" He asked, voice turning sweet and innocent as his eyes fell open and the plush bottom lip protruded slightly.
"Quite aware, darling." He stopped and laid back with his head in her lap. "But serious talk, can I ask you a totally serious question? You can't get mad at me for asking it."
"True, because I am not related to you. Which would be really weird, I I was," she stated with a smile and a shudder.
"I am implying that you might need a new residence until you graduate and if I can file and win a court case to have you removed from their family and implemented into mine, I fully intend to."
"Come on, baby girl. You have to go to bed, okay?" Lucifer picked her up and rested her on his hip. "You'll make Uncle Lulu and Uncle Sam upset if you don't."
"Very." She smirked and sat up as well. He lunged at her just as she rolled to the side to avoid him. Grass stuck in her hair and in her back, but she was smiling jovially as though tempting him to launch again, already knowing she could beat him at this game.
"I know. I bring it on myself and I know it." I scratched the back of my head and fiddled with my tongue ring.
"Yes, dear." Castiel rolled his eyes and watched the streetlights as they passed beneath them, the steady pulse making his eyes droop until Charlie was unceremoniously shoved at his shoulder.
Sam's brother just got up and left without a believable explanation. And he didn't return after ten minutes. Ten minutes was lenient, but it would likely take him a while to find the bathroom and a little longer to find his way back. Still wouldn't be five minutes.
Dean stopped for a moment and probably would have blushed if he wasn't already so red from exertion.
Castiel, Lucifer, and Michael's mother had died giving birth to Castiel. Chuck had then gone into a depression where he went to bars and woke up in seedy motels; cliched, I know. He had impregnated a woman during this period of time and she gave birth to twins, Gabriel and Anna. She expressed her dislike of having children and signed over the two children to Chuck's custody.
"Anyway, I am going to over to the Winchester residence to hang out with Dean. He seems interesting." Castiel said as he looked for a shirt and a pair of presentable jeans instead of his grungy sweats.
Dean found it excessively humiliating whenever John did that to him. It sometimes made him play worse but most of the time made him faster and more competent. If he messed up, he shook it off and kept going, using John's negative words as a fuel to his anger.
Deanna didn't know what to say. He had known, but didn't tell her. He wasn't freaking out about her being anatomically incorrect. He was dealing with it like he didn't even care; like he dealt with finding out someone was a freak every day.
"Alright. I'll be there in a minute." Castiel started the Impala carefully, knowing Deanna would kick his ass if he fucked the beautiful car up. He drove as fast as he dared and carried everything up. He was told he could see her in twenty minutes and to just wait in the the seats until he could go in. He waited, vibrating in his seat so he could go see her.
"Well, they prevent body hair from growing in places like my torso to help maximize the femininity. They allow me to develop breasts and fuller hips like a woman would have, though I don't think mine have done so well for me." She patted her hips and rested her hands back on Castiel's chest.
"C'mon, baby girl." Cas grabbed her elbow and directed her to the bathroom just off the kitchen. He sat her down on the toilet lid and held her hand over the sink. "This is gonna sting something awful, okay?" He said as he held a bottle of rubbing alcohol over the laceration in the webbing between thumb and forefinger.
"I'm gonna go so I don't fall asleep and wake up cuddling with your dad again." Castiel said as he got out of the bed and stood to stretch. "That is not an experience I desire to replicate."
"You know, I was thinking." John started. "Since you're seventeen now and you have a license, maybe you would like to have this old girl."
Slowly, Castiel began to morph. He colored his hair outrageous colors and wore tight black clothing to display the steadily increasing muscle tone as well as combat boots on his feet. He finally felt
"No, buts." Castiel sat back again, refusing to release his soft grip on her wrist. "I admit, I initially fell in love with your pretty face. I won't deny that. But honestly, that day we went to the pool and Lilith confronted you, I knew you were a character of heart, so I fell a little further. I thought you to be perfect, but then I saw your scars. Old scars probably from years of playing outside and even some pale ones across your hips that indicated self-loathing of some form. I realized then, you're not perfect, making me fall just a bit further. You have a sweet laugh; you laugh at my crap jokes even when Charlie gives me a dirty look for it." Castiel smiled at her blushing face. "I am not looking for a girl with big breasts, small breasts, medium breasts, thin waist, thick waist, average waist, or anything else like that. I'm looking for a girl who is sweet and kind and won't take anyone's bullshit. Even if you don't fit the societal term for a female, you still are. I'm just fortunate enough that you took a liking to me."
Castiel went to sit in the seat one over from Deanna, but Charlie grumped and told him to scoot down one, so that he was right next to Deanna.
"I feel terrible telling anyone, even you, Dad. He told me this in confidence." Dad sighed and leaned back in his chair.
I sighed and relaxed back into my bed, pulling the panties back out to sniff. Ah, Dean. If only I had my phone with me. I would totally put these on and take a picture to send to him.
"Castiel, why the hell weren't you in school all day?" A voice screamed from inside the house. I rolled my eyes and pressed a hand to my forehead.
Deanna awoke feeling good about herself, but still grouchy as anything. 'Cause nobody sane is ever in a good mood when they woke up for the day. They didn't live in a NyQuil commercial.
"I know. I get it though. Job needs you to move, so you move. I'll be fine." Deanna said. She tossed her dad a tight smile. She really did understand. Didn't mean she had to like it.
"He knows you have the panties? Did he see the things I bought you?" Charlie asked, practically gnawing on her fingernails.
"I wanted you to tell me in your own time. I didn't want to scare you off with thinking I was a creep or something."
Dean has such amazing friends, a bad ass dad, an adorable little brother, and a comfortable little home. His life isn't too extravagant and all of it is comfortable.
"You've got some 'splainin' to do." Deanna pointed at Sam. "Now, who're you riding with to The Roadhouse?"
"Fine." Castiel stood up and walked to the door, only pausing to say one last thing. "Whenever you're ready to say something, I'm never far away."
She wasn't queasy from the cut. Wounds never bothered her like that really. However, it was the nerves of telling Charlie and eventually Castiel what she really needed to tell them that made her feel ill. Cas came back over and sat down cross-legged to put his plate in his lap. He took a big bite out of the burger in his hands and sagged in pleasure. He gave praise to Mr. Bradbury through a mouthful of burger, causing Mr. Bradbury to chuckle and shake his head. He just devoured his burger with gusto. Deanna noticed he didn't get any onion on the burger and was curious, asking him about it, only to receive a cheeky smile through food and a soft blush on his cheeks. Comprehension dawned. She too blushed and leaned her head against his shoulder lightly.
Once hot, she took the straightener to the lower half, only pleased when none of the extreme curls remained at the back. Removing the tie allowed the secured hair to fall around her shoulders once again. Looking it over, she decided to leave that wavy, after all it wouldn't cause any problems when she would inevitably run her fingers through it in nervousness. She always did when she was with Castiel, and it was never a conscious effort.
She wore tight clothes, a black leather jacket and wore combat boots on her feet. She had a few piercing  in her face and hinted at having them
"Thanks." I smiled a small smile at her and closed the stupid sketch book. I decided I would work on the drawing later.
"Only the one thing about Michael, but it was obvious on you. It was clear someone had beat you. I just told him who. I'm sorry." I quickly said. "Just hear him out, okay?"
"You will cave, old man," John said as he walked by on his way to the kitchen to drop off the to go boxes from the restaurant.
"I am not god. Nice compliment, though. My mom taught me before she was taken away. She was an excellent masseuse."
"So, Lucifer." I began, hearing Sam's exasperated groan. "I'm assuming you are to be more trusted than the stereotype of your namesake?"
She ran outside and slid behind the wheel, everyone else taking places in the car. She turned the key and sighed at the sound.
"Okay, please follow me." She smiled and walked off toward the dining area. She sat them down and handed them their menus before taking off again.
"He was concerned at first." She laughed remembering when they had gone shopping. "Dad took me and Sammy out to get some clothes, Sam being only maybe two at the time. He let me drag him around the store until I found the clothes I wanted to wear. He just packed Sam on his hip, not wanting to lose the energetic boy.
"I actually do whatever Charlie wants me to. She needs me to write a scene for one of her fanfictions, I usually do. She then goes in and changes everything." He laughed. "I don't have a life outside of Charlie."
She turned the phone toward me to show an image of him in the green panties, like before, but this time he's hard and the head of his (PIERCED) dick was extended past the waist.
"Yeah. With your long legs shaved so smoothly." Castiel stroked the thigh of one of the aforementioned legs. "You're kind of hard to resist and you know it."
Just to punish him, she pulled her favorite heels from the closet. He'd never seen them, much less seen them on her. It felt like she was aquiring power when she slipped the four inch heels onto her foot. Closed toe black heels with little studs all down the back if the heel itself. Her makeup was done with dark blues and blacks with a clear gloss on her lips. She felt absolutely dashing.
"C'mon, Luci, let's go outside." Sam tugged his boyfriend out the door, Castiel and Dean not far behind them.
"I'm gonna drop into the kitchen." Lucifer put back the chair and leaned over whispering. "They don't know I'm here. Meg's not told them"
"Not often. Just when I'm out late, miss school, get a tattoo, piercing, or he thinks I've eaten." He says it like it's nothing. Like being beaten for a small thing like
"Ah, yeah, the football team captain. Why aren't you with the rest of the team?" Castiel turned his head in confusion and he looked like a freaking puppy.
"Wow." He looked down at her feet and saw the heels. "Now you're a lot taller than me. Those are like five inches."
I brought up my fingers and gingerly felt at the tingly spot on my neck. It felt no different beneath my fingers, but I could feel the mark on my skin. I could feel his mark branding me his.
"Uncle Sam, Uncle Lulu!" She hollered as she ran at them. She grabbed Lucifer's leg and hugged him tightly.
Very Graphic Scene™️ ahead. If you are easily triggered by NonConsensual sex please skip past this chapter.
"C'mon, Lilith. We can worry about them later." Alistair grabbed her round the shoulder and walked her away.
"I am not going to call you a freak. I would never do that." Charlie reminded. "But this is a big deal you need to tell Castiel soon. I've never had a transgender friend before. Always wanted one though. That is what you are right?"
He pulled back and rested his forehead on hers, looking into her eyes. He never wanted to look away.
Deep and long scars spanned his back, some crisscrossing over others. How I hadn't noticed was beyond me.
"Shut up, Sam." Deanna threw a pillow and hit the door. Loud cackling followed until the front door shut. "That kid is annoying," Deanna said through a smile.
He grabbed some gauze and an ACE bandage to wrap up her hand and some triple antibiotic to coat it with. He held her hand tenderly and placed little kisses to her fingertips to distract her from the pain. He smiled gently as her when he had to smear the antibiotic into the wound and placed her fingertips against his lips when he had to press the gauze over the wound, then sliding her fingertip just a bit between his plush lips when he had to wrap it, never once allowing her eyes to stray from his. He noticed the way her breath hitched and her cheeks darkened when he did those small acts.
"Why don't you sit down?" He asked as he gestured toward my bed. I shook my head; I don't think I could move.
"And you want my help on telling him." Charlie stated. "Please?" Deanna looked up, eyes wide and vulnerable.
Charlie started laughing at his expense, quite loudly too. Castiel slapped a hand over her mouth, muffling her gails of joy so as to leave her parents sleeping.
"You aren't going to pay me back. I am doing it out of generosity. You need some friends and I am going to be your friend whether you like it or not. Okay?" Charlie grabbed Deanna's hand, making her flinch unnecessarily. Charlie instantly let go, not saying anything about it.
"Oh, yeah. I think we need a weekend to ourselves. It'll be the first in like four months." Castiel slumped at the table. "We need a break."
Dean had to get his head in the game. He needed to keep his mind together. Stay focused and warm up. It doesn't matter that the most handsome boy in all of the school had just shown up and was going to watch the game. He couldn't let the fact that The Castiel Novak was at the football game mess him up.
"Damn right. Wear those blue swim shorts. They match your eyes." Charlie said, driving carefully along.
Castiel smiled and scooted over to sit beside her. He grabbed her around the waist and hugged her tight.
"Clarence, c'mon." Meg called from Castiel's bedroom. She lounged back and threw her hands over her head.
Deanna took a deep breath, grabbed the little picnic blanket, and walked out to see her dad with an armful of different explosive fireworks.
I took a seat in the back, per usual, and pulled out my notebook to take notes in. I looked up, waiting for the bell to ring and the teacher to begin class. I watched as students sporadically filed into the classroom one by one.
"I don't know. He told me he was going to live there until he graduated. Said he was gonna move out then and never look back."
"Yeah, little bit." She lied with a smile. Castiel only nodded and walked away to get himself a plate.
"Dean! I'm home!" A voice boomed loudly. John. The bedroom door opened and John popped his head in. "Oh, hello. I'm John, Dean's father." John entered the room and walked over to Castiel to shake his hand.
"Yes, definitely." She looked around and saw the walls had small candles on little ledges. The candles were the only light and it was perfect.
"You gotta stop chasing her like that. She thinks it's a game." Castiel said from the doorway holding their youngest, Elisah. He rocked her back and forth as he bounced on his heels to lull her to sleep.
"You know you're pretty damned lucky Michael isn't here. He doesn't even know you left." Lucifer told me.
I brought my hand back to his back and rubbing softly, relishing in the soft feel of his skin. His nose was pressed beneath my jaw, each breath from his parted lips ghosting over my neck. His hands were pressed between our chests, the warmth comforting and soothing.
She took them further until they met a small clearing. She grabbed a trash bag from a log and pulled a blanket from inside to lay out. She sat down on it and Castiel followed suit.
Dean pulled out his phone and looked at it for a moment. He went outside and texted Sam, telling him that he was not feeling well and that he just wanted to get home and get some sleep.
"While I go to California for a few months, you and Sam can stay here. If that is what you want. You're almost eighteen, De. I think I can trust you to take care if Sammy and yourself."
"Hey, Dea--- Oh, my fucking god, Dean! Close your mothafuckin' door next time!" Sam yelled as he slammed the door shut. I closed my eyes and swayed on my feet.
The lines were light at first, but slowly darkened and formed a firm jaw, uniquely shaped lips, and bright wide eyes. Long curling hair fell around the drawing's shoulders and one little ear peaked from behind the hair.
Darting up down the hall to my bedroom had me there to find that Cas had yet to move, aside from the shaking.
She sat there for a few minutes just thinking and looking at his face. She still had a hard time processing that Castiel actually is okay with her being... whatever she is. It gave her a bit more confidence to be herself with him.
"Right." He gave a false laugh at the notion. "That won't go over well, especially considering the one who does it is a cop. All of the police are his buddies and they think he is a doll, the nicest boy ever."
Dean groaned and leaned over to Castiel who was leaning over to. They connected their lips and Dean drew away.
I took a seat and continued twitching. My leg bounced up and down and my fingers twitched. Bobby grabbed my hand and stilled my knee.
"Finally free!" Castiel exclaimed as he excitedly opened the doors and stepped out. Deanna chuckled behind him, Charlie and Gilda close behind her.
"I am part three of the Charlie and Castiel show. I ride with them, and they keep me out of trouble." Meg answered for herself.
I went back to the bathroom and Castiel hadn't moved from his position. He was awake, but completely relaxed.
She decided to slowly begin stretching her leg out along the bed, hands holding his cheeks to stabilize and minimize the movements, but her effort was wasted. He groaned and shifted, eyes cracking open to gaze up at her. He squinted his eyes in the light and looked at her confused.
"Coming!" I hollered back. I started walking - shooing Castiel to go do something to Dad's office and saw him viciously typing away at his computer. "What's up?"
"That's okay. You were persistent." Deanna patted the old man's hand. "I'm going to sleep in here tonight, so I don't have to wake up Cas."
I opened the car door and plopped down into the seat. Dean hustled around the car and hopped into his seat. He turned the engine over and pulled out into the street just in time to hear a loud screech and a jolting
Months have passed since Castiel just left my house. I don't know why he took it so hard, but he did. He hasn't spoken to me, hasn't even looked at me.
"Hello, I'm Charlie and this is Meg." The red head introduced, coming forward to shake hands with John.
John glanced out to Castiel. "Don't let that boy break your heart. You'll have to tell him some time and I would rather it not be too far in the future."
It wasn't his fault Azazel had a broken nose! It wasn't his fault at all. Azazel shouldn't have told Deanna she was a freak. He shouldn't have insulted Deanna.
"Bullshit, Novak. Sneaky bastard." He fastened his jeans and continued on out of the room. As he went, I snapped my rat tail against the back of his thigh. He turned slowly with his eyes widened comically.
Dad rubbed the frown lines in his forehead. "Always knew that kid was trouble." He grumbled. "What are we going to do about this, son?"
"I am simply asking if there are any other things he makes you do that you perhaps don't want to engage in."
"It is quite. No one bothers me here. I don't know how it stays so short though." She sat criss cross and placed the knife in front of her. They sat in comfortable silence for some time, just holding hands and listening to the trees rustle and the nature in general.
"I didn't almost out you to her. I simply told her you are insecure. Not a lie." Sam shrugged and flopped onto the couch. They'd have to get the TV hooked up to a satellite company, but as it was, they didn't have TV to watch.
He couldn't help but to watch as the heels made more sway in her hips and tightness in her legs. The skirt swished sexily around her thighs and the shirt molded to her body, tight enough he could see her bra straps around the back. Her hands swung by her sides and her hair was ruffled by the very slight breeze.
"Yes. I did. Besides, I didn't think I needed to tell you every time I get something new." He readjusted himself into a more comfortable position and stared her down.
"I just wanted to warn you, Dean is a total nube. He will probably blush a helluva lot and get really awkward. He is currently panicking in his room, which, by the way, is down the hall to the left." Sam grinned and went back to kicking his ball against the house.
"I don't want you to run away from me, Cas." She finally spoke. "I don't want you to hate me and call me a freak. From most other people, I can handle that. But not from you. Not from you, Cas."
Castiel Novak was raised as a rich bitch. Raised to love himself only and sneer at all else. He was sick of that and not to mention the clothes he wore! Dress slacks, dress shirt, and tie. Blech.
I rolled my eyes at my inner fag. Sure he was pretty with his heart shaped lips made for sucking dick and his freshly rained on grassy eyes with his thousands of freckles. Or his strong arms and bowed legs perfect for getting in between. Yes, and we can't forget the perfect curve to his ass or the depth of his voice. God, the gravelly sound of Dean's voice was nearly orgasmic.
Castiel leaned over on one elbow and ran his index finger over the soft exposed skin of her abdomen. She swatted his hand and smiled. He just did it again.
Once the water was filled sufficiently and was deliciously warm, I went and grabbed Castiel. I carried his reluctant body into the bathroom and stripped the sweats off him. I lowered him into the water and he instantly sighed and the tension left his body.
She did not want to tell Cas about it. He didn't need to know just how damaged she was yet. She'd have to tell him eventually, obviously, but she was going to prolong it as long as she could.
"Yes. Scariest moment of my entire life. Shouldn't've told you a damn thing, woman." He grouched. "I need something to drink. Try not to wake the neighborhood with your wild cackling, okay?"
Dean awkwardly sat down on the bed and looked down. He wouldn't look up at all. It was obvious by the blush on his cheeks that he was feeling very awkward being around his crush.
"You boys better start talking and getting along or we'll never let you out!" The ginger yelled through the door.
"Nope. Boy can sleep on the couch. He ain't gonna take my baby girl's bed." John progressed to her bedroom, thinking about how to wake Goldilocks up.
When he entered the house, he did so quietly only to be pounced and dragged forcefully to Charlie's bedroom.
"I've said it before, but you're a controlling little shit, aren't you?" Castiel asked rhetorically.
"Come on in." John called, settling into a recliner, offering Deanna the arm of the chair. She sat down and felt John's arm settle around her side in a comforting manner.
I smiled into the kiss and pulled away from his tempting mouth. His bottom lip stuck out in a pout, so I leaned forward and bit it. His eyes widened as he pulled the abused lip into his mouth to suck on.
But around fifteen, Castiel met Meg Masters. She had long brown hair tipped him blue and a sweet round face paired with a southern voice that held enough sugar to turn the healthiest person diabetic.
"Well, go on and tell Charlie. I know she's here somewhere. She always is." John laughed as he shooed he away.
I got home, knowing I was going to be in trouble. Again. I left the house when I wasn't supposed to.
I lifted his legs and put his ankles on my shoulders. Wide, apple green eyes stared up at me in wonder and lust. I ran my fingers over the underside of his thighs, goosebumps following in my wake. I rubbed my palm over the swell of his ass that the position created. His hips jerked.
"This is Castiel. I met a girl yesterday when she came to introduce herself. When I went to the movies, she was there with friends. She introduced me to him." Deanna quickly explained, smoothing her skirt in her nervous habit.
"Okay. See you later." She turned and walked nervously to where Castiel had the blanket folded and tucked under his arm. She laced her fingers with his and walked to the gate and away from the house.
"Not as happy as you would be getting married." He nodded toward Deanna not so subtley. "Having kids and raising kids."
"I'll help you get them." She offered as she stood up. Charlie nodded once and turned heel and marched into the house. In the kitchen, Deanna stopped Charlie from opening the fridge. "I have to tell you something." Deanna said nervously.
"We are expecting our father to be home soon, and I don't think he would be pleased to have a strange girl in our house." Sam said as he grabbed Lilith's arm and steered her towards the door.
"Amor, et demetam posteriora tua!", he spoke, ordering love to go away. The affection between a witch and a familiar created the bond, without it had to wither away. A small orange flame puffed up as the match hit the concoction. Then …
"The shop's closed", Dean said grumpily and stood up. He didn't appreciate being sneaked up on. "Come back tomorrow."
The man blinked taken aback, his trench coat rustled in the light breeze of this sunny Sunday afternoon. He looked left and right searching, then back at Dean.
"How about we take the day off?" Castiel's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Sam hasn't found anything yet, so ..."
"But I exist. And you can see me somehow." Again the man was looking around, presumably for clues to this mystery. "My cloaking magic must be faulty."
"Yeah, I did but you shouldn't!" Restless and confused Dean ran a hand through his hair. Could he manage enough strength to break it off again, to Castiel's face even? Doubtful.
"Late at night I can hear the crying." Barely more than a muffled groan. "I hear it all trying to fall asleep." Castiel was choking on his own words.
Hands pulled erratic at the fabric of their cloths. They needed to touch each other's skin. Liberated moans. Fingertips stroked hot skin, gripped strong muscles, needed to feel more. They held each other tight. Heart racing in their chests, sensible by their closeness. Each new kiss, each soft touch was love incarnate, their feelings coming to life with their flesh. Another deep kiss, lips moaning deeply.
"She was a fast machine", Dean sang into a wet sponge, foam dripping down his hand, "She kept her motor clean." Spinning around to the music his foot swiped at the bucket of soapy water, almost kicking it over and spilling it everywhere. The sloshy sounds drowned into the loud rock music. He leaned over the broad hood of the car, arm outstretched and muscles working as he drew big sudsy circles. White streaks of foam decorated the black metal. Soon she'd shine in the sunlight again. A little smile on Dean's lips while he sang along to the song and washed his car, the love of his life. His Baby was a real beauty and deserved his full attention. Not that he had anyone else to give full attention to.
The road was long. A lifeless stretch of asphalt. In the middle of the road stood a lone figure, a shadow unmoving. The trench coat lightly flapped around the figure's legs.
It was a dimly lit room, wooden panels covered the walls and the tables showed some nicks and scratches from a lifetime of use. Dean was trying to teach his guardian angel how to play pool. Emphasis on trying.
"I shouldn't", Castiel answered, "The more I enjoy human activities, the more my magic will wane." He had barely touched his beer.
"Why couldn't you fly here?", Dean asked, the words came only slowly out of his mouth. Foreboding butterflies ravaged his stomach.
Snakes slithered in the neatly cropped grass. Disgusting, if someone asked Dean. So he focused his eyes on the house. Where was the Indian girl? A naga as it turned out, mythical cobras that guarded vast treasures.
"Of course not!" He better don't. How lovely, his lover wanted him killed by the state. When all the love around you is dying ... Why didn't they understand? The end of the world was going on and nobody cared but him. That didn't deserve a death sentence, if anything he deserved a medal.
"Love you, too", he whispered. For a moment he closed his eyes and savored the feeling of Castiel's soft touch.
Dean spun around startled, feet slipping out from under him and his back pressed against the car. "What in hell! Who the fuck are you?", he yelled surprised and angry.
"Yeah, but", Dean objected, "Don't you wanna try it out? That's what we're here for." What was a boys night out without a nice beer and some karaoke?
A deep sigh escaped Dean's throat, longing and pleading. When was the last time they were so close? He couldn't remember. His hands grabbed the trench coat, pulled Castiel closer.
Why would Cas chose him? He wasn't smart or made a good trophy wife. He was good at hunting, repairing Baby and looking after Sam. Nothing about Dean was special.
The sincerity was painful. Another fault of Cas's that could be endearing if it wasn't annoying. "I take my chances."
He should've said no. But Castiel had said yes. A room in a rundown motel, a bed hardly serviceable and yet they had spent the rest of the night there. A sweaty, sticky night and Dean's moans had been stuck in his head for weeks after. Thought he could feel Dean's lips and hands on his body for weeks after. Longing in him even back then, a desire for more he should not have given in to.
Furrowing his brows Dean cocked his head and looked the man over: slightly shorter than him, shaven jaw and mussed brown hair, a black suit underneath the trench coat with a loose blue tie. Fetching. Was his behind also something to behold? "You're standing right there, man."
The cries at night kept him awake. So many nightmares harassed his lover's dreams, made sleeping unfeasible. Therefore life was impossible. He woke Dean up too often, but he had no way of sharing in the pain they caused.
With the same determined stare still in place the older Winchester began to speak, “So it is obvious that you know a lot about us and our lives but you could just get that from one of those Chuck Shurley novels. So start to convince us that you are who you say you are, that you are MY CAS and if you are screwing with us so help me, I will bash your fricking head in!” Sam took this opportunity to look back in the rearview mirror and give him his older brother a very curious look and began to talk to Cas as well. “What my Brother means we need to be sure that this new person is our friend, brother in arms and not just another supernatural force out to deceive us.”
Cas then looked at Dean “I’m going to make love to you now, Ash will you help me? I know you know what you’re doing.” “Of Course, if that is OK with you Dean, I know we have never done that, is it what you want?” Dean looked and said, “Yes, I want you inside me too Ash, I just never knew how to ask.” Ash then said, “Watch this.” And snapped her fingers, in her hand appeared a bottle of lube. “And feel, it’s already warm!” She touches it to Dean’s side.  Cas watches as the Hunters eyes fill with amazement and longing. She then covers her fingers with the warm gel and starts to reach between Dean’s legs. Gently rubbing against his opening at first and then he sees her press two of her delicate fingers into the tight opening. She is also using her powers because in here, their private oasis, her telepathy works as telekinesis as well.
Cas wearing nothing but white boxer shorts sat on the edge of the bed in their bedroom. Well, what had been their bedroom before he left. His face hurt, where Dean had punched him several times. Ash was cleaning the wounds while Dean rummaged through a box of Cas’s old clothes, that had been stored in the closet, looking for something dry for Castiel to wear. Cas could tell by the way Dean was throwing things around he was still upset but every time Dean looked at Ashby and then him he could see the lines of anger fade from his face. Now he only seemed mildly annoyed and quite hurt.
She was on the shorter side of average for a female, 5’5”, and very curvy. She had strong legs and arms, from years of physical labor, lifting, pulling and maneuvering her patients around. During high school she was a weight lifter, and of strong “German Mountain Climber stock” as her Great- Grandmother Schmitt would say. She did have a layer of softness over these strong muscles and some loose skin at the bottom of her abdomen, but that was mostly due to all the weight (almost 90 lbs.) she had lost a few years back and had she never had time to have elective surgery done before her world went to hell.
Well, the boys have Cas in the car and are heading for the bunker. Dean is his usual sensitive self and Cas bites back a little.
Cas dropped to his knees and undid Dean’s jeans and pushing them and his boxers to the floor. Dean gulped, “Um ,Cas , what you doing there Bud?” The only response was Cas reaching up to stroke Dean’s length before taking into his mouth and beginning to lick and such his way down the length. “Holy Crap, Cas, wher did you learn to do that?” Dean breathed. Cas pulled off of Dean for just a minute and simply said “Ash, taught me while doing this to you. “Well, Cas, Angel, we need to thank my Heart because she has taught you well.” Dean breathed out as Cas continued to suck and tease him, while caressing his testicles, rolling them gently through the Angel’s fingers.
The last few days had been especially rough on Sissy, Sam thought, she was sick most of time. Her cheeks that were usually round seemed sunk in a bit. It was worrying the hell out of Dean and Sam alike. So today Eileen and Ash went to town alone. Dean objected, no he down right told her no! When he said that she gave him a look that could make the bravest warrior to their knees. “Dean Winchester, you listen to me, I will not be told what to do, I want to go out with Eileen, Dean began to interrupt but Ash stopped him, “no, no, no you are going to stay here with Bubbie and search for leads to find Castiel!” He did as he was told but this had Dean even more on edge than he normally was lately. Pacing back and forth in the War room looking at his phone every few seconds. “Dammit Sammy, where could they be? It only takes 20 minutes to get to town and 20 minutes back, what could be taking them 2 freaking hours!?” Dean growled. “Look Dean, they probably just enjoying the weather, it’s nice out and Ash has been cooped up in here for over two months, set down and stop pacing, you’re working a groove in the marble, dude.” Sam growled back at his brother.
She was trying to tug his shirt above his head as well but having very little luck because Dean wouldn’t give her much room to move. She only managed to get his t-shirt and undershirt pulled up under his under arms. Dean didn’t want to brake contact with her, she felt like a dream, but he knew in order to feel as much of her as possible pressed up against him they both had to get their clothes off. He pulled out of the kiss once again to look into those amazing blue eyes and let her pull the shirts the rest of the way off.
Ash was a nurse who specialized in Correctional Medicine, she had worked in Prisons and county jails for all of her nursing career. Taking care of the ones who had lost hope, those who were forgotten and thrown away by today’s society. She felt it her mission to help heal their broken bodies and spirits. It was also her calling to uplift and support those valiant souls, the officers that took care of these individuals on a day to day basis. However, after her loses and the decline of funding to pay medical staff to treat their patients she was at the end of her rope. She knew no one was waiting for her, no one would look for her if she just disappeared. This was a fact that made Castiel very sad but grateful that he found her when he did.
It was a crisp autumn day in the Great Smoky Mountains, the leaves bright in their reds, yellows and oranges. The little cabin and surrounding area was a buzz of activity. There was a catering tent at the far side of the clearing, the smell of Big Bob Gipson’s BBQ thick in the air. One of the many things Ash had taught Dean about that he now loved. To be honest though, for once, Dean was not hungry he was way too nervous to eat. The ceremony was only about an hour away and Dean could not set still, he was pacing back and forth on the cabin’s front porch, trying to drink some coffee. Sam was walking up the path to the cabin from further into the woods were Ash and Cas’s dressing tents were located, the ceremony would be at a small pavilion by the deep creek that flowed through the woods.
“That’s it Sam, as soon as we get to the bunker, I am strapping this lying Bitch to a chair and torturing the truth outta her! There is no way that is Cas, Cas would never say that many words at once.” “To be fair,” Sam countered, “Cas had become more chatty there near the end and given the fact he is in a new vessel, with different experiences and a different background, it would only make sense that Cas would be somewhat different. I mean look at the vessel, WAY different.”
“Cas, my Soul, you have been my savior, my defender, my best friend, and all around pain in my ass for a long time now,” Another babbling of laughter, “ I mean that in the bast way, you have pulled me up by my bootstraps and carried me through some of the roughest times of my life. Buddy, I KNOW that without you I WOULDN”T be here today, marrying you and Ash. NO one here could have ever pegged me for falling in love with a dude, least of all me but you are more than that, you are my eternal companion, no matter what vessel you might have. I love you Cas, more than life itself. I promise you to never let you go, I will go to hell myself and pull you out if I have too. You and me and Ash we are it, we are the end all, be all for me. I promise to turn to you even when it is hard. I promise that I will try to live up to the righteous man you are, the righteous man you have made me to be.” Dean let out on big whoosh of an exhale at the end of his vows. He looked younger than his almost 45 years he had been on earth; that in and of itself was a miracle Bobby thought.
“Dean Sweetie, will you set down with me for a second there is something I need to tell you. Well, you and Sam it affects us all and Eileen already knows. I went to the Doctor today…” Before she could finish her sentence Dean started hyperventilating, “I knew it,” he wheezed, “you’re going to die, the cancer is back, I...I…nooo.” “DEAN, calm down, I don’t have cancer! I’m pregnant!” Dean looked up and his jaw fell open, his eyes rolled back in his head and he collapsed. Dean Winchester, fainted like a Southern bell at a BBQ who had her corset on too tight! If it wasn’t so serious it would be comical, Ash thought.
As Cas approached the Impala with hands out in front, level with his waist, palms up showing Sam and Dean that he held no weapons and meant no harm. As Cas came closer to the car he saw the faces of his family for the first time in months. They both looked the same really, Sam tall with dark hair that he kept longer, Dean with his shorter military style cut, both of them staring hard at the figure approaching there car. The one surprise is that Sam is in the driver’s seat, Dean riding “shotgun”, which almost never happens, at least not in a long time.
Ash stood before him, she was looking around the space that she had just found herself in, and to her it looked like a little cabin surrounded by woods in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains near where she grew up. Cas knew she loved this place, loved the cabin, the deep creek that ran beside it that she loved fishing out of. He knew also that Dean would love it here too, that is one reason Cas picked this particular spot. When Ash’s eyes landed on Castiel, her eyes grew wide with wonder and a smile spread across her lovely face that made Castiel feel like his metaphysical heart would burst out of his chest. “Cas, it’s you! How is this possible? I can see you as I see you in my head.” Cas stepped up to her and touched her cheek with his fingertips. It was like lightning moving through him, Ash’s hand sprang up to meet his on her face. “Cas, I can touch, you I can literally touch you!” she cried.
It was Ash who broke contact this time, She had stepped away from Dean’s embrace, just slightly, enough to look up into his eyes. “Sweetie, we need to get to a bed because if we stay here very much longer I’m going to have to throw you up on Baby’s hood and make love to right there.” She said with a wickedly sexy smile that made Dean’s groin throb even harder. Dean moaned, stepped back, grabbed Ash’s hand and practically began pulling her up the stairs, he had to slow himself down because Ash was trying to keep up but her shorter legs were having to do double time it to keep up with Dean’s long strides.
Eileen and Jody was helping Ash get ready, they stepped into the dressing tent to tell her it was time for the wedding to start. They made sure her veil was on straight and fanned out her train as she walked out of the small tent. Across the way Cas was stepping out of his tent, dressed on the charcoal gray suit that they had picked out for the grooms. His tan skin practically glowing, his normally crazy (sex hair as Dean always put it) was perfectly combed and he stood his posture straight and tall. Ashby almost lost her breathe with how beautiful he was. Cas must have heard her because his cobalt blue eyes stared at her for a second before he too was overcome with emotion, love, need and peace beaming from his face. The music started and they both marched toward the central aisle that led to Their Hunter, Their husband.
Ash breathed a sigh of relief, she could still be very over sensitive, especially when it came to the thought of Cas or Dean leaving her. She felt tired all of the sudden, the cabin around her began to fade out again, and she felt herself melting back into her body. For a second she did not feel Cas there with her but then he was there in the foreground of her consciousness telling her that he was there. She then let herself slip into unconsciousness and she slept a sleep full of peace.
When the alarms went off Sam was sleeping so deeply that he almost missed it. Eileen of course could not hear the alarms but the flickering red lights made her jump up out of bed. Sam woke up to her violently shaking him awake. They both were dressed weapons in hand in under 20 seconds. Sam saw Ash and Dean coming out of their bedroom as well. A look that meant that he was ready to fight, ready to kill, was frozen on Dean’s face. Sam knew that he had that same hard look on his face as well. Ash was wide eyed and on guard as well. He short legs somehow keeping up with Dean as if it wasn’t anything.
So when the symptoms started happening and the aversion to fried chicken started, she flipped out. She did the math and she should have had her period again by now. So she made an appointment with a local OBGYN while hiding from Dean in the bathroom. She asked Eileen to take her and swore her to secrecy, with all that was going on, with all that had happened she did not want to put any more stress on Dean.  Well today was the day and when she left the doctor’s office she was even more confused than she was when she had gotten there. They did a pregnancy test right away even though Ash said it would be impossible. It was positive! Ash almost fainted, if Eileen hadn’t been there to hold her up she would have hit the floor. They did an ultrasound and sure enough there was a little bun in her oven. A small little fluttery heart beat and small budding finger and toes. They estimated her being about 6 weeks along.
The fact of the matter was when Cas left he left a huge frickin’ hole in Ash and his lives. They still weren’t even close to good but it was better. The nightmares that came now were mostly about Cas. He was strung up on a cross being tortured by demons or having his grace sucked out of him by another angel or rotting away in some heavenly jail. They were bloody and in them Cas always died screaming his and Ash’s names with his last breath.  He missed his Soul but as the weeks dragged on he was more and more certain that something big had happened but he didn’t know what.
About one hour latter Dean was scrambling eggs, baking biscuits (Ash had taught him how) and cooking fresh country sausage that he made himself from fresh ground pork ( another thing ash had taught him). God, he loved that sweet, smart, sexy woman. In the middle of his musings, he heard Ash scream “Cas, Cas, OH MY GOD, Castiel, where are you?” Dean took off in a dead run down the hall and her start screaming his name, “Dean, he is gone, oh my GOD he’s gone, Dean, DEAN!!!!” Dean then hears Sam and Eileen come running out of their room and throwing Dean, Ash and Cas’s door open. He is there just a second behind.
The next few weeks flew by for all of the Winchester clan. Ash and Cas finished their last two weeks at the nursing home and moved out of the apartment, choosing to live full time at the bunker with Sam and Dean. Dean insisted that they just stay in his room with him and all three of them were happy with their arrangement. Cas and Ash continued to exercise their ability to exist within their directional pocket. Taking the opportunity to explore what Ash could do within its space. She was getting really good at changing her surroundings at will. They also worked on her abilities in the real world as well. They knew psychics have always made Dean nervous but they decided to tell Dean what they were doing while he slept at night.
She was getting pretty good at her telepathy and had to really work to keep from hearing Dean’s thoughts all the time. He knew she could hear him and he knew she tried to give him the privacy of his own thoughts but sometimes things bleed through. To be honest they erupted through at times, Dean was a loud thinker especially when it came to three things: food (especially pie), his car and sex. For example Ash would be making food in the kitchen and Dean would walk in the room, loudly thinking about how good whatever it was smelled and then if she bent over or leaned against the counter in a way Dean thought appealing she would know it right away usually hearing a thought of “daammnn”. He often thought about making love to her or Cas in the kitchen, something she nor Cas would let him do but it didn’t stop him from thinking about it.
Eventually the Novak in question entered the class and winked in my general direction. I looked behind myself to see if anyone happened to make it back there (though there really couldn't have been 'cause there are no chairs back there) and on each side of myself. When I looked back up, he was coming towards me, shaking his head a little bit. He plopped into the seat in front of me and turned to face me, smile on his lips.
She was just happy to see John in the audience of parents and siblings. He had managed to get off for the week and was going to be there for Deanna.
"Let's just put the dough in a bowl with some veggie oil and cover it so we can put it in the fridge. That'll slow the yeast." Deanna said. "I can make Sam finish them tomorrow."
"You need to sit, baby girl." John told her. She sat nervously and looked at him. "I need to go to California."
"But, he probably, more than likely, most certainly doesn't like me." Dean tried to reason. Sam just gave him a bitchface.
"We should," She said, voice slightly deeper and huskier before clearing it. "We should get back out there."
Castiel got on his knees behind Dean and began to massage Dean's tense shoulders. His hands were firm and insistent and downright heavenly. Dean almost moaned out loud. Instead he bit his lip and relaxed into it.
Sam nodded and closed the door back, leaving Deanna alone with the sleeping Castiel. She smiled down at him softly, so glad he had accepted her for all her flaws.
Maybe Ruby would get in with Sam and Castiel could use him to get closer to Dean, like ask questions and learn about him.
Deanna had relaxed a bit during the movie and was sitting on one hip sort of with her head tilted toward Castiel, cheek in palm. It was kind of endearing.
"I most certainly so not mind." Charlie happily said as she took Castiel's keys away from him. She grabbed Gilda's hand and pulled her along to Castiel's "pimp" car.
She pushed open a door and shoved me inside before closing and locking the door. No one was in the room and there were no windows. Great. Now I'll get murdered.
She saw the Impala untouched and undamaged. She walked closer to it and saw that her keys had managed to fall beneath the car.
I hopped off to the shower, where I stripped the panties off and turned on the shower. Once the water was warm, I hopped beneath the stream and palmed myself.
"Dude, it's okay. I can be a bit of a shock to some parents." Castiel laughed and patted Dean on the back. "Hon, ya gotta loosen up. You're gonna hurt yourself being so tense all the time."
"I'll see you guys later." Deanna said as she walked away, walk self-conscious like she knew she was being watched.
"What does my dick know?" I chuckled, then gasped for he had grabbed my hips and pushed me down as he pushed up into my still clothed ass.
Deanna rushed to the bathroom and looked at her reflection. She looked horrible! Her hair was up in a terribly messy bun on her head and her eyes were sleep encrusted and her face was shiny. Not to mention the ratty old t-shirt and baggy shorts settled on her hips. She groaned internally. At least she had gotten the hair removal therapy, or she'd have some unsightly stubble to remove.
"Yeah, they got with my dad before they realized he was an alcoholic writer." Castiel rubbed his neck. "He's not abusive or whatever. He just... I don't know. He left a long time ago. I live with Michael, Raphael, Uriel, and you get the picture. Gabriel left a long time ago too."
"I bet you do. I bet you look sexy as you push this right inside while you wear these panties. I'm sure you writhe and twist and pant as your muscles clench and tighten around this thing." Castiel's smirk deepened into a full on malicious grin.
It's a shame the Novak kids couldn't be kept all together. Their father, Chuck Shurley, had killed himself in his study many months ago, and no one had noticed. He never left the place, the kids said. They never got to see their father very often.
"I'm just going to leave now." Castiel got up and left. Crap. I am such a dumbass. I just pushed away my ultimate crush.
When the waitress returned, drinks on a tray, she asked if they were ready. They nodded and spit off their orders one by one. She wrote them down quickly and parted them.
Castiel received two days ISS, or in school suspension, for assaulting another student, not that he was complaining. He was only worried about Deanna being alone, even though Charlie and Meg would eat anyone alive who tried to mess with her.
John quietly opened her door and peered in where Castiel was out on the bed, arm thrown across the bed, like he was holding someone there. John turned to Deanna who had gotten up and winked at her, malicious smile curving his lips.
He pulled out this felt pouch and opened the draw string at the top. I stood frozen in place as he discovered my secret.
I rolled my eyes and continued on to the bathroom. I started up the bath with scented oils that relax the body. Don't knock it til you try it, I always say.
"Had to drag Clarence out to see this game. Poor boy will never get to meet the man of his dreams if he stays at home." Meg winked at Castiel who groaned and sat down. Why did she have to let everyone know he had a crush!? Even if she didn't tell them who, she still told everyone!
They looked over the menus in virtual silence until a waitress came over for their drink orders. She smiled and left to get their drinks and wait for them to decide.
I grabbed his dick in hand and gave it a couple of short strokes before wrapping my mouth around the sensitive head.
"Perhaps we shouldn't play this game." He said lowly. I crooked my eyebrow and tilted my head to the side, small smirk on my lips.
She eventually settled down enough for him to remove his hand, leaving her gasping for breath and wipe moisture from her eyes.
Deanna braided her hair to pig tails on either side. She appraised her look once again and sneered. This was the best she could do. She hoped they wouldn't hate her for being ugly.
"That's cool." Castiel nodded. He didn't like her feeling uncomfortable with the way she looked. She was beautiful. "So, what do you like to do in your free time?"
"Yes, thankfully. She questioned me relentlessly." Dean sat down cross legged on the bed and dropped his phone in the empty cavern between his legs.
"Let's go for a walk or something. Walk down to the park. That's what all the cliche couples do, isn't it?"
John stroked her fingers in silence, thinking to himself. What had he done wrong? It had to be his fault she was hurt like this, somehow.
Deanna acknowledged it with a small nod. She would wait until after the fireworks. She'd invite him in and lock them in the bedroom, so they wouldn't be interrupted. Deanna was going to tell John not to bother them because she was telling Castiel The Secret.
Deanna was excited for the party Charlie was throwing. She had a new purple dress that molded to her figure until it got to her hips where it fanned out and stopped above her knees. She was gonna wear simple black flats as well.
"Bye, baby girl." Dean said as he kissed her forehead. Cas kissed her little head and smiled at her.
"Good to finally meet ya, boy." Bobby shook his hand. "Deanna is just as much my little girl as she is John's. Be careful, son."
"Yeah, be back in a minute!" Deanna swept her hair back in a haphazard ponytail and walked over to Charlie's. She walked in and found Charlie's foster mom in the kitchen icing cupcakes.
I gave a small smile and walked back to my bedroom. I stripped back down and pulled my sweats on. I crawled in behind Castiel and pulled his body to my chest, relishing his warmth. He didn't wake, but made a soft sigh of perhaps contentment before burying himself into my hold and grasping the hand hanging over his stomach in a sleepy clutch.
"Yeah, you kind of are, Dean. You're cute, you blush easy, your dad doesn't hate me - that I know of - and you're pretty damn sweet. I mean, I called you in desperation at two thirty in the morning and you let me in and cleaned me up. You let me sleep in your bed and even wear your panties. You are a darlin'. I should be so lucky to be your boyfriend." I awkwardly scratched the back of my neck. "You are kind to everyone, as I hear it. I would be one proud son of a bitch to be able to hold your hand, kiss your plush lips, and call you
Castiel's parents flipped out the first time he dyed his hair and at the first piercing and at the first tattoo.
"We have to leave in ten minutes or we won't make it to Sammy's graduation!" She slung her bag onto her shoulder and tapped her foot.
Castiel almost winced visibly. Damn, he hadn't taken into account that Crowley might have a boyfriend.
"Maybe." I smiled a little. "But honestly, you being a fuck up is a matter of opinion in all reality. I might look like a fuck up to someone who had grown up in a fancy smancy lifestyle and had perfect everything, 'cause I do screw up. I don't look fantastic. My grades are average. I am average. But I'm not a fuck up to myself, my dad, or my brother. You just gotta pick the opinion you like best and that is closer to the reality."
"It's not them I worry about, Sam." Deanna stopped and looked at Sam. "Dad says it looks like he may be interested in me. What if he is and he thinks I'm physically a girl all the way? He would probably flip his shit if I told him."
"Okay, that may be the best idea." John pulled hands from the dough and looked at them. "At least I have short nails."
"Hello, Dean." Castiel said from in front of my open underwear drawer. "Do you wear silky panties often?"
"-slice your finger open." Mrs. B finished. "Oh, dear. Castiel, take her to the bathroom and clean that cut up."
"Come on, lets go strike fear into that boy's heart." John winked and smiled. He walked out into the living room once again. "So, what are you doing calling on my daughter?"
"Yeah. I hope he does. Sam's been with him since he was sixteen, for god's sake. He's gonna say yes." Dean smiled sadly. "Dad would be proud."
Deanna found the bathroom and turned on the water faucet. Water came out much to her joy. She went to her bedroom and grabbed a slim dress and clean undergarments. Maybe she'd go out to see a movie later after dinner.
"Hells yeah!" Sam smiled and laughed excitedly. He darted off to find John and ask him if it was true.
"Great!" Charlie clapped. "We'll be back over in half an hour to collect you. We will see you some other time, Mr. Winchester."
"I mean, I didn't know how he was going to react to you. Not that there is anything wrong with you! That's not what I'm implying! You're great! I just didn't know how Dad would feel about your looks, what with the piercings and tattoos. And I'm just gonna shut up." Dean sped through before he could dig himself deeper.
"Well, time to go home, right?" Castiel asked hopefully. He just wanted to go to bed and wake up at about three the next day.
"Anyway, I found my first dress and loved it. I begged him and begged him to let me get the pale blue dress. He didn't understand, but let me get it anyway as well as little girl tops and skirts. I despised wearing shorts or pants." She laughed. "Dad just went with it. After all how could his deny his son what he wanted? Since then he has bought me dresses and skirts and cute tops."
At eleven a.m. the doorbell rang, rousing Deanna from a pleasant sleep. She stumbled out of bed and walked toward the door, knowing Sam would be asleep and her dad would be at work.
Charlie saw Castiel and Meg at the bottom, searching for them. She lifted one arm in salute, gaining the attention of Castiel. He nudged Meg and pointed as best he could with two large drinks, one in each hand. Meg nodded and began the long trek up the steps. Charlie winked at Deanna and walked down to the end of the aisle. She ushered Castiel and Meg down the aisle, behind Meg.
"I'll see you later, okay?" He leaned over and brushed the hair from my forehead. He pressed his lips in a slow kiss to my forehead before he parted.
Castiel smiled at me and tugged me close to his body. We began swaying to the soft music as everyone stood around and awed.
"I think she is trying to set Deanna and myself up, to be honest, sir." Castiel responded. Deanna blushed.
Deanna packed everything Ellen would need plus some. She wanted the baby to have as much as possible so nothing would be amiss.
She went into the bathroom and stripped down. She looked shamefully down at her manhood. It was annoying having those pieces a part of her. She hated them. She was ready to get the procedure to complete the change. She already had breasts due to the hormones she had been taking for quite some time.
"C'mon!" Castiel grabbed Sam's arm too and began to speed away in search of Ruby. Sam gave Dean a questioning look to which Dean just shrugged. They darted all over the house until they found the one Ruby was in. She was playing Spin The Bottle with Meg, Charlie, Andy, Kevin, and Jo.
They drove quietly, the only light from streetlights until there were none. They drove down the old path to the cabin and got out. They carted their things for the stay inside and started a fire. Castiel sat down in a chair and pulled Dean down to face him in his lap.
"I'm glad." Castiel kissed her hand just as the door swung open with Sam carrying two wine glasses and a bottle of wine. He set them down and carefully poured the liquid into the glasses.
He reached over and carefully grasped her chin, looking into her impossibly green eyes. He leaned down and kissed her lips, completely G, considering her father was probably watching him.
"Mr. Collins, if you'd like you can go see Ms. Winchester now, if you'd like." The nurse told him. His heart skipped a beat and he thanked her as he gathered up everything and went to room 221 in Hall B. He cracked open the door and looked inside. She was laying down and looked kind of nervous. She saw Castiel and smiled at him happily, if not drowsily.
I roused him awake at half past three so he could be wakening properly when Sam gets home from school. He groused at me, but got up anyway. He mumbled something about needing a shower and headed off to the bathroom. I laughed to myself and rolled off the bed. I snatched a blanket and wrapped myself in it, should Sam be home, I need not scar him. I walked to where I assumed the utility room might be and lucked out when I saw the washer and dryer. I moved the sheets and things over to the dryer and tossed a dryer sheet in. I started it up and proceeded back to the bedroom.
Castiel leaned over and saw his eyes had closed and his lips were parted a small bit. He smiled a small bit and put his hands on Dean's shoulders. Massive knots were there. He gripped Dean's shoulders and began a hard massage. Dean hissed quietly.
"You know, all night you have been letting the dried blood flake off onto  my pillows." I prodded him.
Once her hand was sufficiently wrapped, she tugged it back and cradled it against her chest. Her eyes still wouldn't leave Cas's and he liked it that way. Slowly she stood and went to walk by Cas, but he gently grabbed her elbow and pulled her flush with his body. She looked into his eyes and her breath stopped as he leaned down and pressed his lips to hers in a simple brushing of the lips.
God, Meg had gotten drunk off her plump little ass, so Castiel had to drive her home. He lifted her up as she giggled and carried her out to his VW. She was giggling the entire way and poking at Castiel's chest like she was some damned baby entranced by him.
"This one is mine." Sam said jokingly as he wrapped an arm around Jess's shoulders an squeezed her to him.
Dusk fell, bringing excitement with it and further nerves with it. John and Mr. B hustled around happily finding all the fireworks they would set off and arranging them in chronological order.
Deanna lifted the top on her plate and laughed. Castiel grinned, already knowing what was under them.
"Shut up. Come on. Now. We have to see this movie. It's the last freakin' one of the installment." Charlie begged.
