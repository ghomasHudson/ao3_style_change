He felt a bit panicked, working in the kitchen that was not his own but felt comfortable, wondering if their date was just a simple distraction. He'd felt a pull towards John, wanting to touch him and be touched as much as possible, but he was unsure if John had the same feelings. Or maybe doctors, or John, were simply more tactile.
John placed Sherlock in his chair, arranging him so he was balanced over the back. His knees were on the seat cushion, legs spread wide. John moved the plaid out of the way so he could look at his pink, rubbed hole. He dribbled anal lubricant right down his crack, and Sherlock shivered from the cold sensation. John leaned on his knees on the floor, resting his cheek on one globe of Sherlock's beautiful arse, himself as lazily fingered in and out of Sherlock's puckered hole. He watched the younger man desperately rut against the dangling fabric of his outfit that hung between himself and the chair back.
"Sherlock," John tugs gently on Sherlock's curls, kissing the corner of his mouth, "I will do whatever it takes. Whatever I need," John rubs his thumb, his fingers against Sherlock's collarbone, "I have some ideas, but I will do what I need for you to be safe."
John's face was unreadable. His eyes were searching Sherlock's back and forth quickly, as his hand tightly grasped his waist, "Thank you."
Greg Lestrade, not above dramatics himself, pushed through the double doors, blowing them open with a crack.
John smiled at his love, running his fingers through his hair one last time before getting out of bed.
"How recently?" Sherlock bit his lip. It was really none of his business.
It took a while to believe the depth of Mary's deception and her motives; but rehearsing the plan with Mycroft soothed his nerves. It was as comfortable as marching orders in Afghanistan sand, as exhilarating as  running by Sherlock's side in the dead of night.
"Was I wrong?" Sherlock raised and eyebrow, adjusting his pillows so his ribs didn't ache so sharply as he inhaled.
Sherlock bit down on John's shoulder, his hips grinding down in a circular motion. John couldn't stand the teasing anymore. He flipped Sherlock so he was laying on the bed, grabbing the anal lubricant. Readjusting the long plaid so he didn't trip over it, he scooped Sherlock into his arms and carried him out into the living room.
John turned his head and looked up at Sherlock, "Just waiting. I was so sick with worry. I worked on our home. I needed something to preoccupy my mind, rather then watch you in unconscious and fitful sleep."
They pack silently, efficiently; they've kept clothes and items stowed and ready to take the moment Baker Street was available. Now, it's John that's going back to their flat and Sherlock back to his "hospitalization." Everyone is moving pieces against the most dangerous woman in the world: Mary Morstan. She has turned enemies into working partners. John is tired of the cat and mouse and feels heat of tears as he finishes zipping his duffle bag.
John nodded. Sherlock wouldn't hear anything else. He turned and left the flat, shutting the door gently. His chest ached. A door opened, and he'd gone for it, and Sherlock had rejected him. Been angry with him. Fumed at him. Dismissed him. John was shaking so much he put his hands in his pockets to try and stop it.
Sherlock's ribs felt better, just a little creaky, so he spread out on the couch and turned on the television. There was a special news story on how there had been another decomposing body found in the park, this time with substantial markings that the 'police weren't releasing at this time.'
Sherlock was crying now. Just a few tears, "You don't hate me? You don't think I'm a freak?" God, John loved him. This sweet brilliant man. He had never felt such an ache in his chest to be close to someone else. Constantly.
"It's a case. There was a double homicide with more notes placed near the bodies."
Mycroft had chastised him, "For God's sake, Sherlock, let go a bit. The poor man does need to breathe." Sherlock had relaxed his grip slightly. As John began to sleep, with the female nurse gone, Mycroft agreed to find a male nurse instead.
Mycroft laughed and Sherlock smiled, "My brother has always been good at defending himself. If someone starts a fight he'll finish it."
Regardless, Sherlock was determined to enjoy it.
"I understand, leannan. You may stay as home as long as you like. We can get married here. You're so young. I don't-"
to be walking near a crime scene that he's working, a crime spree that's delayed his honeymoon twice-"
"Yes, John, yes," Sherlock scrambled up to kiss him, running his nails up and down John's back. John moaned, grinding himself down on the couch on top of Sherlock. It felt heavenly. Sherlock had kissed before, but never been touched, had never been naked with someone else. For the next few moments, John kissed Sherlock with his tongue, nipping at his lips with his teeth. Sherlock stopped him, begging, "Please, I've never done this before, and I want to, but I'm afraid I will-"
"He's ruined careers and has the ear of most higher political figures in the world. He can do most anything to anyone he puts in his crosshairs."
Sherlock scrunches his eyebrows together and puts his face closer to John's, "Did you hit your head, John?"
"Did you wear it?" John's face looked so hopeful as he asked. He'd let go of the reins, and the horse had walked a few paces away. The sun was streaming, and the sky was bright blue. He knew the significance of the question. He didn't doubt his mother's true intention for a moment, honest mistake she claimed it was.
"No, I just… I just can't explain it right now."
He pulls at John, gesturing at him to lay down so they are facing one another. He hooks his legs around John's, pulling him close, tucking his chin over his shoulder. They sleep, wrapper around one another, John bestowing one last kiss to Sherlock's lips before closing his eyes.
John begins kissing Sherlock's neck, rubbing his shoulders, moving his hands down Sherlock's hips and thighs.
"We can't see each other again."
"You've got a bit of stubble there yourself, luaidh, from being asleep for 3 days," John whispered, kissing against Sherlock's jawline, "You look wild."
"John."
Mycroft sits in a smaller chair across from them; John has never seen him look more tired and annoyed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hamish's eyes widened, "You have a skull? And a violin?"
Tavis winked. Sherlock was completely dressed and properly oiled and perfumed. Tavis held out his arm.
Mrs. Hudson looked between her two boys, then burst into laughter. Some of the tension left her shoulders, "Perhaps I should invest in ear plugs, then, or a good noise machine."
As he begins a brisk walking pace, he bites into the apple and continues walking further away from London. He recalls the last letter he had tucked into Sherlock's bag. Just in case, he'd thought. He'd tucked it down deeper, so he'd hopefully find it last.
Robert walks away to the kitchen.
"John, take your clothes off, you're freezing," John raised his eyebrows. Sherlock ignored the look and kept talking, "You can wear my dry plaid while your clothes dry in the sun."
She has a blank look on her face, the she scrunches up her eyebrows.
John pulled Sherlock close, holding him around the shoulders, "Sherlock, that's laid out like a kitchen house but it's not. That is a separate place for all your experiments. A place to keep your ingredients and measuring tools so they don't get ruined by the rain. It's big enough for you and your brother to work side by side, if you like."
As John listens, he's tempted to ask why, but he knows better than to disturb him. His hips are swaying and his eyes are closed. There is a light floating of snow outside the windows.
"Sherlock, were they nice to you?" Sherlock looked up at John. His face was flushed from the heat of the grill, his muscles of his arms flexing as he balanced the tray and put the food down in front of Sherlock and his family. He couldn't get words to form.
John sat up quickly. He inadvertently ground his hips into Sherlock's, their erections touching, just the woolen fabric between them, "Did he kiss you? And you didn't want it?" The thought of that wicked man touching his Sherlock was giving him visions of burying
"Let's get you into the tub, dearest," John whispered into Sherlock's ear, guiding him into the tub. As John lowered him into the warm water he winced, realizing the bruises on his chest and back from his fall.
Mycroft. Path of least resistance. The brother out in the open.
"Mycroft," Robert hisses, "What are you doing?"
"I'm positive. I've told you before I was amicable to the match, but I'm even more sure now. I was frightened so much of who I'd be matched with. I'd been dreading it since I became of age last year," Sherlock rolled closer to John for warmth, "I don't know that I feel the way about you that my brother feels about his husband, as they couldn't keep their hands off each other from the start. If you are content knowing that I believe you're my equal, and I care for you and express that I find you beautiful in my own way, and we can be together in quiet, and loud, and work aside one another, then we shall have a successful partnership."
He quite enjoys fooling his boyfriend.
"Sherlock, stop,
John put his forehead on Sherlock's,"Are you saying you don't want us to live with you? Is this too much?"
"Oh, my sweet virgin. Sherlock, let me. I will teach you," John wrapped his hand around both their lengths. Sherlock moaned, crying, the slick, soft heat surrounding him. John pulled him tighter, their cocks trapped in between their hipbones and John's pumping fist, "I will put my mouth on you next time. I will draw your seed out of you and swallow it. I'll show you I love you by kissing and tasting every inch of you. I'll use that oil on you, open up your most intimate place, slowly, so gentle. When you're begging, only when you're ready, we will make love. I will be connected to you, inside of you, joined as husbands."
"No, why would I be mad? I'm crying because I'm happy," Sherlock smiled, "I've worked very hard at trying to be nice, and I'm happy you and your daddy think I'm nice."
John keeps his eyes on the town, and occasionally looks up at the stars. It's gorgeous. Without city lights, it's so much easier to see the complexity and layers of the stars.
"I clean when I'm nervous. I didn't have my violin."
Robert just shakes his head, "You're going to have to come down here and talk to me, but, before you come down those stairs, you need to be sure. About us. Not some file. Not something you read or can weasel out of someone. Us. Do you know me? Do you trust me? Don't come down here until you know."
"Oh for god's sake, are you still drunk?"
He calls Mycroft, calls Sherlock. They'll have to get a good disguise for Sherlock, but he has to come see what's going on. CCTV reveals no clues.
Sherlock. Soaking wet, hair and clothing sticking to him, dressed in layered jumpers and jeans so he would blend in with anyone.
"Yes. I am doing my best to reassure him...that I love him, and it's to protect him."
Sherlock felt a bit less shy in looking at him. John Watson was truly shorter, but compact with muscle. He was bronzed where Sherlock was pale. His hair was golden sunshine where Sherlock's was raven black. John's hair was a bit scraggly, but it was shorn close to the head. Sherlock had shoulder length ringlets. John wore a cropped, light ginger beard. Sherlock didn't have much facial hair, and what he did have he kept shaved. They were quite the opposite looking couple, but they wore matching dark tartans.
In his way, Mycroft also loves John Watson.
Sherlock lifted his chin, turning his head to allow John to kiss more of his skin. As he spoke, John continued to kiss along every bit of Sherlock he could reach.
John rocked up for a deeper angle, pushing into Sherlock. Sherlock rolled side to side, driving John to hit the spot that made him tingle across his belly. Sherlock met John by rolling up, catching his penis in between their bodies. They rocked together, Sherlock growing more and more heated with each push.
Everything is ready.
"But you solved that case, Mr. Detective," Hamish said, as he looked up to Sherlock with a furrowed brow.
The speech to Mary was complete. She heard what she needed to hear, and seemed to believe him. He was glad the vest had a back protectant so if she did decide to stab him in the back.
Mycroft moves closer to Robert and looks in his eyes. Mycroft has always paid proper respect to those in authority, those who can take information and modify it. He realizes,  deep down, he's worried for Robert. They've worked around each other, in the same office space, for years now, but he finds himself drawn to his insane optimism.
The battle between kindness and sharpness was never more difficult on this case. They had been running on little sleep and caffeine for three days trying to catch a kidnapper. Without question, the two men put their all into kidnapping  cases. When Anderson, a snarky crime investigator, thoroughly botched up crime scene photos Sherlock came unglued. The two men got into a shouting match that John and Greg had to get in between. As John put himself in front of Sherlock, he made an off-hand comment, "The photos won't help Sherlock. The kidnapper is too smart for that to make a difference."
Medical conferences were a mix of pure boredom and bottom shelf alcohol. It was a chance to meet colleagues and have mini reunions with old classmates while boosting the resume. It was also a way to become spectacularly hungover after shagging a knockout blond doctor from Wales who sucked you off until you screamed for mercy twice.
John stared, looking between the two of them. He realized his mouth was open and he was gaping again, so he shut his mouth, trying desperately for a proper response. Finally, he said, "He's a genius. I didn't know how he did it."
Sherlock looked at John with open, tender adoration. Step by agonizing step, the three slowly limped into the flat, then Sherlock's bedroom. Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson slowly lowered John onto Sherlock's bed. In a fit of triumph, Sherlock declared, "I know you're tired, John. I'll do everything. You don't have to leave my bed for weeks if you don't want to do so."
Even after his horse had healed, he'd found excuse after excuse to stay. The roof had to be re thatched. The fencing needed rocks replaced. Sheep had to change pasture. After three weeks, Greg asked the elder Holmes for Mycroft's hand in marriage. They'd all agreed, deciding to not deny themselves any longer, and thus forgoing the calling of the banns and a Church of Scotland wedding. Instead, they agreed to a handfasting and promises shared in front of their families.
"Yes, I figured that out," Sherlock smiled, taking a few moments to breathe in and out deeply. He closed his eyes, opening them when John touched his hand after returning from the kitchen.
Robert sits down with his diary one last time before he will turn it over to Mycroft. Years of his life, written down, documented. He's been circling around this outcome for years. An assassin partnered with a vicious business man who destroyed his life. Soon, this will be resolved.
Sherlock tried to nod, but he couldn't. He was terrified he would burst into tears. He dug his fingernails from his right hand into his left palm. He didn't raise his head, but lifted his eyes just enough to see Tavis looking back at him from across the table. Tavis' lips were pursed into a thin line.
Mycroft and John were heading to the Czech Republic to volley another letter back.
As Robert looks up, Mycroft comes around the desk, leaning down on one knee. He resists the urge to reach out and touch his cheek, "Tell me, what has he said?"
Hamish was quite put out when the grown ups were going to stay up past his bedtime, using the only child-like vernacular Sherlock had heard from Hamish thusfar. He was grumbling that "he couldn't wait until he was growed up so he could do what he wanted." When he was asleep, in the room just off the living room, and Sherlock was settled on the couch as comfortably as he could be, John brought him a small tumbler of scotch and some pain pills. Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock didn't answer, but unwrapped the gift for John. As the wrapping fell away, it revealed a kilt, in the same Watson tartan pattern as Sherlock's dress. Sherlock unwrapped the fabric, running his hands over John's shower-warm skin, placing the kilt on his body. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, leaning down to kiss his shoulder. John moaned, moving Sherlock's hands on his hips.
"Yes," John crawls over Sherlock, kissing up Sherlock's torso as he pulls up on the taller man's shirt. For a moment they both scramble with each other's clothes, finally dissolving into breathless giggles.
Sherlock looks up from kissing John's stomach. His eyes are wide, his face so innocent, sweet, "You mean it?"
John lays on the floor, wrapping himself around him, "Sshh. Why are we hurting each other? I'm sorry. I just. Jesus, Sherlock."
The doomsday clock counts down.
"Mycroft, tell him..."
"I'm going with you."
. Over the next two weeks, he learned that a helicopter had life flighted him to the nearest port in Norway, then back to London when he was more stable. Sherlock wasn't able to ride with him, and Mycroft had come to pick Sherlock up.
John's vision darkens, he has trouble breathing. He's been to war, he's been to crime scene after crime scene, but all he can see, looking at the bodies with chest gun shots, are 7 Sherlocks lined in a row. Laying down in order just as Sherlock had lain in Magnussen's office.
There will be room inside for five.
Sherlock rounds another corner to the right, and he skids to a halt. A woman, in all black, is surrounded by a small group of homeless men and women. She is talking animatedly, gesturing with her gun. A woman, Samantha (from a bolt hole near the Thames) says no and starts to back away.
Sherlock ignored his protests, taking John's wet plaid, his shirt and sporran, laying them out across bushes. Sherlock unwound his dry plaid, keeping his back to John, handing it  over his shoulder to him.
Sherlock waited until he was out of sight until he went inside his doorway. His legs were shaking and he was short of breath. He regretted not staying with John, but he couldn't move too quickly. He didn't do well sleeping in a bed with someone else, not without knowing them very well, and not without working out what to expect. Most partners were not that patient, that's why he hadn't bothered for years.
He'd only seen them once, and they didn't know they were betrothed. Everything was secret until Mary could be taken care of.
Sherlock looked over the house. It was taller than the houses on his farmstead, built with flatter, longer rocks in a staggered pattern. Surrounding the house were traditional highland purple thistle, white meadowsweets, all colors of crocuses and red wild basil. The flower gardens ran like a a river down and in between trees that flanked the sides of the home.
Mycroft gives John a thoughtful look before he gives Robert the command to hit send. John does not break eye contact, but gives a small, sharp nod of his head.
Mycroft holding hands with a man over lunch two days ago. A government official, in a relationship with a man? May not be enough for a pressure point. Yet.
When John heard banging and screaming, which was unmistakably the widow, he tapped on Sherlock's shoulder to turn him around. John pulled on his own ear and mouthed
Now, Tavis smiled and clapped his large hand over Sherlock's entire shoulder, "Mycroft getting married today, eh? Then little Sherlock will be next." Tavis winked. Sherlock felt his cheeks and chest flush. He knew that's what it meant, he was next in line, but he'd hoped to put it off for years. Mycroft was difficult to match, rejecting the first five suitors his mother brought forward. Gregory Lestrade was a rare love match. He came to their clan when his horse had lamed while traveling from his clan to trade wool.
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes were incredibly normal. They bickered, went shopping, read. No international intrigue like Mycroft. No dead body parts in the fridge like Sherlock.
He would fall down if the other operative weren't nearly carrying him.
John giggled. He recalled his discussion with Mycroft, years ago, in Speedy's. They'd been discussing Irene, the awful woman who'd ruined John's attempt to finally confess his love for Sherlock by showing up in Sherlock's bed.  Sherlock had asked John what he knew of Sherlock's heart, and shared that Sherlock always wanted to be a pirate. John felt dizzy with all the stories of their lives coming together. They'd finally confessed that they wanted one another. They were together. They were getting married.
Sherlock downed the rest of the scotch and tried to turn and put it on a coaster near his left side, but he winced and cried out with the turn. John grabbed the tumbler and felt his side, "Don't turn your side like that! That's right where the asshole kicked you."
Sherlock stopped near the intersection, pulling at his hair, "Every possible motive makes no sense. Why? Why this theatre? Why Anderson?"
"You ok there, Sherlock?"
(See the end of the chapter for
As they entered, a tall, overweight man stopped washing wine glasses at the bar and ran to Sherlock, shaking his hand warmly. They signed to one another very quickly, the tall, heavyset man easily keeping up with Sherlock. Sherlock moved to take his phone out of his pocket to interpret for John, but the man stopped him, offering to speak.
John knows by the looks Mycroft and Robert are giving each other that Sherlock is texting. They aren't sharing out loud, so John doesn't ask. Mycroft is his commander for this mission, so the information will be given if it is necessary.
Hamish grabbed Sherlock's hand, and tried to pull him down to sit on the floor by them. Sherlock shook his head, "Ribs are still sore," and he took a place on the couch, as near to them as he could get. John shifted around so he could lean his head against Sherlock's legs. Sherlock found he couldn't concentrate very well as John stroked circles into his calf muscle with lazy fingertips.
horse?" Sherlock asked, rubbing the stallion's neck. He looked up at John, who smiled down at him.
John wills himself to breathe, to stop the hiccuping sobs that broke through. He's never cried like that in front of anyone. He expects the entire cafe to be gawking at him, but he imagines a large display of emotion from him may seem quite normal to anyone else.
"Really, John. What can you provide that can preoccupy him, that can get him to assume your on edge behavior has nothing to do with Mary, or anything else we're doing? What could explain clandestine meetings just the two of us, if he deducts it? Something big, something that's been brewing for a long time. Something that is so close to the truth, that is the truth, and we will hide behind it."
He felt his breath catch as he heard bits of Sherlock's conversation.
To keep alive, they would need to marry, to align themselves with another clan.
"Yes," John responded, smiling.
Sherlock didn't board on their chinook.
John jolts awake with a stomach cramp. He grabs at the bowl that Sherlock has placed near him and wretches into it. Vile liquid comes up, and John feels cold.
"Yes."
Hamish pulled on her robe sleeve, "May I please have hot chocolate?"
The tartan pattern was dark and could have matched Sherlock's betrothed's, but in the dim light it was hard to be sure.
After John left, Sherlock was alone in his bed, rubbing his nose in the pillow that smelled like John. As he was drifting to sleep, Sherlock had a panicked thought that made his heart thunder in his neck.
Tonight is sweeter, even in the worry. There is no guilt in watching Sherlock's face, touching his hand, moving his curls from his forehead. He watches Sherlock toss and turn slightly, muttering in soft tones; nothing that's understood. John knows that if he would let himself sleep it would be the same sleep he had after he shot the Cabbie; remarkably calm and surprised at the absence of guilt. No matter the opinion of anyone else, the decision was the correct one.  He watches Sherlock sleep until sunlight slowly fills the room, until Sherlock wakes asking for John and a glass of water.
John cut him off with a kiss to the side of his mouth, as he couldn't turn to kiss him properly, "You were brilliant."
Sherlock lays down fully on John, resting on him, so he can unclench his fingers and take the letters out of his palm. They are destroyed, shredded in ribbons from moisture and tears.
John grinned, tucking his chin down, pulling Sherlock back against him. He whispered in his ear again, "I want you to know that we are pledging one to another. I am joining your family, and you are joining mine. I can't think of any better symbolism than me taking you home, and our tartans and plaids being mixed up on the floor of my bedroom."
Mycroft stands up and peers back through the hallway. Robert is standing in the hallway.
He bumps the table grabbing him and kissing him, "I love you, I love you.."
This portion of a building is meant to resemble an apartment entrance. Enough to block the assassin's view of the outside as she walks into what she believes is her and her husband's new apartment. Where there is room for three (mother, father, baby.)
He turns to the left as he's rounding a corner and recalls suddenly a day when he and John were running through the streets at breakneck speed. When they'd stopped, breathless, against a wall, Sherlock remembers having to dig his heels into the concrete to keep from pushing himself over to kiss John. God, he'd loved him. Even then, all this time. He aches with missing him, but it's a better ache than words unspoken.
John laughs. He watches Sherlock laugh, his eyes sparkling and face crinkling up.
John's parents were extremely proud. John's main job was construction, in addition to helping at the restaurant, so not everything rose and fell on being successful in the theatre.
The path swoops up and around to a beautiful, open space with rocks that reminds him a bit of Dartmoor. In the distance, he can see a cabin, in fairly good shape from what he can tell. Beyond that, he sees another small town in the distance. He estimates he can stop at the cabin for the evening, then continue on to the small town the next day. He may even be able to hitch a ride.
John sat up, pushing himself up to stand, making Sherlock whine from the lack of touch. He was mortified by the sound.
"Are we too much, do we need to give you some space?"
Sherlock was mapping the city's layout when at at 6:32  his landlady, Mrs. Hudson, rang the doorbell. She lived in south London, and would only call on Sherlock occasionally to check on the flat. Was everything satisfactory? We're the windows in good repair? Did the stove work?
John feels unsure, the question means so much more than what Sherlock is asking, "What do
This was a man who had seemed to hate him from the start.
"Well, this is an imitation or we got the wrong killer. I've got to go meet with Lestrade and see what is going on."
"You'll put him in the room with the experiments?"
"John Hamish Watson," He kisses his eyelids, his cheeks, his neck, his jawline. Sherlock draws John close to him so they are flush, chest to toes, Sherlock's lips pecking over John's neck. They've only made it as far as the doorway to the bedroom. "I love you, John, and I'm going to make love to you."
Mummy pats his cheek gently, "Yes, sweetheart, but never with the boys. He's tended to ignore his heart. Both boys do."
John saw the sunlight slowly fill the inside cabin, and he saw the tired and defeated look on Mycroft's face. His eyes were red, and he rubbed his jaw.
William smiled at him, leading him over to the chair to help him dress, "No, Lord Holmes. It is true. John Watson doesn't want to wait."
At Jim's intake of breath, the older Holmes brother asks, "Do I have your full trust and cooperation now?"
John stopped touching Sherlock, "Oh, my darling, why are you crying? My dear, are you alright?"
"That was almost like a scene from a romance novel, you having to catch me as the swooning heroine," Sherlock smiled, grabbing John's arm tightly as they shuffled to John's room.
"Nothing...I was..." John remembers his promise, their promise, of together, "Well. I was remembering when you did something like that to Janine, and it just made me feel..."
"John, my love," the violin is laid aside, and Sherlock pulls John's face up to his, running his thumbs over his cheeks. "My love, what's wrong?"
Hamish turned around, his smile bright as he saw Sherlock and John standing shoulder to shoulder in his doorway.
John wrapped his fingers around the back of Sherlock's neck, pulling him down for a sweet but quick kiss. Sherlock tasted of strawberries and champagne.
"Jesus, what a way to spend Christmas," Lieutenant Watson huffs as he surveys the five young Jordan civilians who were transferred in. They all have burns. One is less visible than the others; all on his legs.
and played it back. Sherlock kept smiling, and John was determined to continue learning as many signs as he could if Sherlock would keep smiling at him like that.
That love, to see his family from losing their home, was what kept him from running away from John Watson out of pure nervousness. That is what kept him standing, in their field, with his father, John and John's stallion.
"Oh, Sherlock, you lovely..." John pulled Sherlock's fabric, exposing Sherlock's expanse of skin. He ran his fingers from Sherlock's shins up his thighs, massaging, and kissing up and down his jaw and neck, "Why did you never tell me, why didn't you say, I tried everything..."
"You saved my life," Roderick says, in a deep voice like Sherlock's, which always startles John. He looks at him, to see the difference;  a nose and face more similar to Mycroft, "I was exiled for trying to execute Magnussen for blackmailing my family. I was in Jordan, two months in, I would have died," Roderick keeps his glass of champagne in the air, grinning now, "I followed military squadrons to Helmand as they were most heavily covered by the press. I met Captain Watson there again, helped cover the squadron when he took a bullet to the shoulder. Coincidence? The Universe is rarely so lazy. I followed you. Made sure you came back alive."
"Sherlock, I'm going out for a bit. Do you need anything?"
mean?" Sherlock pulls on top of him, they are laying chest to chest, their thighs and legs and erections rubbed against one another; John finds it difficult to breathe, focus.
Robert smiles. Brightly. He turns his fingers to lace them through Mycroft's, "No, not at all."
"The body in the street was stretched out like in mid run, reaching to the alley."
"I was adjusting his ribs!"
Sherlock smiled, running his hands through John's windblown hair, trying to straighten it, "Yes, let's call it a date, then," and he grabbed John's neck and his back, pulling him flush with his body. He moaned.
John laughed, "And you can't say you're
They kissed, languidly, slowly rocking into one another, Sherlock pulling himself as far on John's lap as he could. John looked up at his bridegroom, nipping at his lower lip.
Mycroft puts his fork down and rests his chin on his hands, "Why would I not like to spend time with you?" Mycroft couldn't recall ever sounding like this.
"Do not touch your hair until your groom can let it down for you. You look like a crowned prince, or a wood sprite from the forest. You are absolutely glowing and beautiful, and I would not let you go if you did not love him and he didn't love you," Tavis bestowed a kiss on the crown of Sherlock's head, "Where did your betrothed leave your first clue?"
"It's none of your concern."
Sherlock squeezes his fingers, then brings his hand to John's chin to bring it up to look him in the eyes, "I can't lose you, either. I'm not going anywhere. Together." Sherlock kisses him quickly on the mouth, then smooths his hair back. They share a small smile.
He looked up behind the shoulder of Mr. Hudson. Hamish stood there, holding up a broken chair. He had cracked the chair against the back of his head, giving Sherlock the seconds he needed to overpower the man, and for John to come running over holding his gun on Mr. Hudson.
"Whoa there, 'Lock. You took a jumping fall off a big horse. You need to lay down. You can't get up yet."
Sherlock is standing in front of the double large windows, composing a waltz.
Sherlock awoke, slightly disoriented. He could feel someone else in bed with him, and for a moment he panicked. Who was here? Why? He turned, and John was sitting up in Sherlock's bed, reading a novel. He was wearing a thin rimmed pair of reading glasses and his shoes were kicked off. John chewed thoughtfully on his thumb as he crinkled his eyebrows, concentrating on the novel. It was a bodice-ripper romance.
Everyone is angry with him.
"Do you..." Mary starts.
John didn't know why his heart was pounding, or why he was excited.
"Sshh… Sherlock, you'll have to be quiet," John pulled on Sherlock's belt loops, dragging him into the empty floor in front of the closet. Up against the walls were still piled a few boxes, "The floor will be quieter."
John raised his eyebrows, "Yes, I'm right here. I'd hope so."
"Sherlock, forgive me, you scared me," John kisses the tops of his thighs, near his knees, then picks his head up to look in Sherlock's eyes, "Do you understand? This was a full military operation. I didn't...couldn't watch you..." John puts his hand on Sherlock's left cheek. He tilts his head into the touch, rolling his jaw into John stroking his neck with his thumb.
John trailed off. Greg turned back to front, and without even looking at John, he raised his left hand and flicked John in the ear as hard as he could, snapping the cartilage. John winced, yelping, the pain exacerbated by the surprise and his pounding head. Two women in the row ahead of them turned around and looked, one shushed him. All John could do was mouth the word
Mycroft considers Robert's words carefully, "So, you were hoping, then?"
They sit, on Robert's couch, nearly in each other's laps.
Sherlock's phone buzzed again. He pulled it up so John could see the messages, "No hits on the fingerprint copies I emailed Molly. No data that matches the information in the threatening notes." He gave John one last squeeze, "Let's head to the dining room."
"Oh, not too much. It's just your son, at 8:15 this morning, not even out of his pajamas, just solved a case that had been previously unsolved for months. The NSY will no doubt credit an anonymous tip later on for helping them discover the killer was disguising the time of death by freezing the bodies before dumping them."
John is used to his lover moving quickly, but this time he cannot keep up; he is at his mercy. Sherlock lifts himself slightly on a knee, eyes open, grabbing for the lube on the bedside table. Breathless, aching, John watches his gorgeous detective slick his hole, moaning.
John sat up from the bench, putting him and Sherlock back together, running his hands over Sherlock's hair. Sherlock looked up at him from under his bangs and smiled, "I just, I feel so possessive of you. I want everyone to know you're mine."
"Sherlock,"
John put himself on his side, urging Sherlock to slide in behind him, "This will be good, even if you can't get in all the way, or we go too quickly, this will feel good," Just as he'd been patient with the scene shop, John was patient in walking Sherlock through each step, and what to do, "Now, pull yourself close to me, line yourself up, that's it. ohmygod, you beautiful boy. Push yourself into me, as gentle and as hard as you want, and fuck me, wrap your other hand around my cock-"
Sherlock held Tavis' arm as he walked into the dining room. Stuart and Victoria Holmes had opened up all the doors and windows to allow the midday breeze to come through the house. They had prepared a simple meal of potatoes and bread for the noon meal, but Sherlock caught the scent of lamb and a large smoking fire. His family was preparing something larger for a celebratory evening meal.
Sherlock was unsure how to answer the  question. He was perspiring from the hot sun and the nervousness from needing to be careful with what he said. He knew his face must be flushed.
"I hardly know you," Sherlock said quietly, rolling his palm over John's and tracing the veins in his hand and arms, "I feel comfortable with you, I'm not afraid of you, I enjoy your company thus far, but I don't know you."
Sherlock moved quietly and deliberately so as not to scare Mrs. Hudson. She was tougher than she initially appeared, but she was slight of frame and shorter. He stooped in front of her, his hands on either shoulder, gently, "Mrs. Hudson, as a conductor of light, you are unbeatable."
"I'm glad you were there," Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock considers how trusting John is, to just allow him, in this delirious state, to comfort him and hold him. He'd panicked when John had lashed out as he and Mycroft and the nurse tried to get the IV drip started. He'd been pushing them away, but then he'd heard John cry out for Mary, and Sherlock jumped away, ready to run from the room. When he'd realized John was scared that Mary was in the room, that she was coming for Sherlock, he'd plunged back on the bed and grabbed as tightly onto him as he could; held him so completely still that Mycroft and the nurse could quickly find a vein.
Everyone screams, jumps. The woman in black is gesturing, yelling at the rest of the group. They are panicking, crying.
"Oh, Myc, I knew that. I knew John and Sherlock loved one another. I hate myself, but I'd hoped Mary was just a phase. After John was attacked in that bonfire. Even in the midst of him getting married. Coming in his flat and he shoved us out so fast. He practically screamed 'Mummy, get out, I've got a boy over.' He thinks he's clever."
"Sherlock," John pulled Sherlock tightly to him. John still couldn't really use his left hand, it was no longer in a sling. He did the best he could to show his love for Sherlock with his one set of fingers and his mouth.
Sherlock blinked at Hamish. Neither of them spoke for a moment. Hamish continued.
The husbands gathered each other close, sleeping the day away in each other's arms. As Sherlock slept, he slept peacefully to the rhythm of John's heartbeat, the smell of lavender and the scent of rain falling on Scottish pasture.
John pauses. Jesus.
"Sherlock, I'm coming. Jesus, I'm coming, you didn't even touch me, or fuck me."
Jaime took a swig of mead and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, "I wish that fair maiden Molly were 'ere. She's a right beauty. I spent the last clan gathering kissing her fair face. She nearly swooned in my arms."
John pushed Sherlock's hair off of his forehead, keeping his eyes locked on his groom's, "I don't know, I want...more of you. Touch me. More."
"Your great uncle. He was at my brother's wedding. My brother's wedding was a love match."
"Why wouldn't the police take that seriously?" John sits down to eat, gesturing to Sherlock. Sherlock keeps standing, "I'm not talking about this unless you eat." John was tempted to add
puzzle, Sherlock couldn't solve.
Sherlock opened his thighs as John shuddered, the slickness of Sherlock's release allowing John to move even quicker against his husband. John raised up, bringing Sherlock with him, into a sitting position. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's shoulders and his legs around his waist. As he was lifted onto John's lap, face to face, John released over Sherlock's cock, bollocks, and thighs.
When Daemon and Sherlock were alone, Sherlock turned to the other man and said, "We are on the right track. Moriarty is getting desperate. I'm sure he called in a tip to put heat on John."
John pitches wildly, crying out again, "Oh God, not Mary, please, leave Sherlock be..." John begins crying again, rolling, and is moving so much his IV is threatening to pull out.
"What was that?" John asked, tenderly brushing Sherlock's curls out of his eyes.
"I deduce not," he said in his slow drawl, "His heartbeat and respiration indicate that he cares for, loves, this Seb very much. He will do what it takes to keep him safe from harm."
John grins and giggles, "You look like a prince to me. You're gorgeous." Sherlock raises an eyebrow, "You are. Quit being ridiculous."
John turned his phone over, fussing with the corner of the sheets, unsure if he should get up and get his clothes, if he was only here for a night of fun, and now the evening was over. If he should leave since the itch was scratched. Sherlock pulls John close, searching his face, John's eyes following his. Sherlock signs, hooking his pointer fingers down. John shakes his head, not sure what Sherlock is communicating. In his accented, beautiful, deep voice, Sherlock says
Their house was small, but with two rooms. The main common room, with an opening for a fire pit, and a large bedroom. The roof would be made of grass and thatch, covered with a netting that was tied down with rock anchors. The triangular roof undercarriage of was constructed while another group gathered the thatch and wound the netting.
John took a moment to review the room in the daylight. It was smaller than a hotel honeymoon suite, but it was lovely. A large tub, and shower, a small sitting room, and a king sized bed.
"John!" Sherlock huffed, standing to adjust his kilt-pin, "I have dressed myself for years. I assure you I am still able to do so."
John hears Mycroft slam his palm against the kitchen countertop, "For God's sake this isn't going to work if you two can't keep your hands off each other for two minutes. Sit down like adults and let's discuss our plans."
"Always you four," Sherlock growled, trying again to crawl up into John's lap. Sherlock felt John's legs move and his arms open.
Sherlock isn't answering. John wipes his tears with his Tshirt that's around his neck and pushes back his curls, "I love you. It terrified me. You. And Moriarty. It hurt. I wanted...wanted to save you for once."
"Is Seb?....was he one of the ones?" Moriarty's voice cracks, he runs his hands up and down his arms. (Are those honest to God tears? Jesus, he cared for someone?)
"Is Hamish ok?" Sherlock crawled up onto the bed, eyes shifting and looking over John's face, lit from the light pouring in from the hallway.
She looks up, rolling her eyes up, (God he hates that look), "Did you read it?"
"Amazing," Sherlock whispered.
John pulled his fingers through Sherlock's curls, looking into his eyes, "Will you be happy with me? Or at least content with me? I cannot bind you to me unless I feel I'd at least make you somewhat happy. You're so beautiful. And so very young. You could have anyone. Are you sure?"
"Tell me," he licked the shell of Sherlock's ear, "how you would touch yourself and think of me? What would you do?"
John had hardly any recollection of Mary, hardly any feeling but regret. John remembered Sherlock teaching him to waltz in the living room, and his inability to take his eyes off of Sherlock's face as they worked on the steps. He didn't take pledges lightly, so he would see the marriage proposal through to the end. He'd cried, countless nights, just wishing Sherlock could have come back
He allows John to guide him, quickly, into to the bathroom and helps him to strip naked in between running the taps as hot as they can stand.
"Yes. When you're better. Tomorrow?" He kisses John's ear, the nape of his neck.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow, sitting up a bit to see John properly, "There were experiments in the fridge."
John put his hands on Sherlock's, "Don't talk about leaving," John ran his hands up and down his ribs.
He begins yelling, loud. Crying. God, he doesn't understand why John is leaving him.
Hamish's eyes got wide and his jaw dropped. He nodded his head in agreement.
"Not tonight, sweetheart, I have a headache," John winked, helping Sherlock stop off at the bathroom, then helping him to bed. Sherlock knew he could've stubbornly cared for himself on his own, but this was infinitely better.
"Sherlock?" John questioned tenderly, "Are you alright? It's getting a bit scary now. Can you answer me?"
Mycroft meets with Moriarty outside London after he leaves Anthea to watch his jumper-cuddling brother. Moriarty's reception is civil, even grateful for the extra communication with Seb. Mycroft ticks a reminder in his mind to tell Sherlock what a good idea that was. The praise may keep him from a darker mood yet.
"John," Sherlock's voice was shaking. An acquaintance might not be able to tell he was nervous, but John knew, "Mycroft can really marry us, in case something does happen on the ship, and we can annul it when we return, if you'd like. It would prevent what happened when you had the concussion, and when I was almost arrested for breaking into your hospital room. At least if something happens on this ship."
"We've got to go to the theatre, mom and dad. Be back about 1am." John yelled. Sherlock felt incredibly young. He'd assumed that John was a loner, like him. Even though his apartment was sparsely decorated and he was independent didn't mean he lived life on his own. John's home, Sherlock felt, was in the wood of the restaurant and in his parents' loving, but overbearing, care.
John groaned and closed his eyes against the rattle in his skull. "No, it was at least six weeks. I saw a chance and I took it. You have opportunity, you can do the same."
"Yes, now. I have no ring. But we are going to be apart. I want you to know, without a doubt, that I am yours and you are mine. If you'll have me. I want to waltz with you, in front of everyone..."
John looked up from the phone, grinning, handing it back. Sherlock tucked it back into his pocket, then slapped his hands together, pushing the right one out faster than the left.
Sherlock turned his head to look at John. He was completely relaxed, "Do you know why I was especially intrigued to take a case on a ship?"
Used to texting his brother back and forth instantly, Sherlock grew nervous as the lack of a response stretched into minutes. Sherlock knew what his reservations were, they were the same as his own, but he couldn't help the risk.
"There will be no just in case," Roderick grins. He's got a slim nose like Mycroft, but with his dark coloring, he looks unlike Sherlock. He's his own creature.
As Hamish brought the tray to John, who had now scooted back to lean his back against the headboard, the melody switched.
John smiled, continuing with his inspection. When we was satisfied, he poured the two tumblers of Scotch, beckoning for Sherlock to climb onto his lap. John leaned his back against his chair for balance.
John sucked in a breath from his nose, "You took me to the stream. Your secret thinking place."
"Sssshhh," John pulled on his arm, "Don't say that too loudly, you make me sound like a psychopath."
"What are you two on about? Are you both ok?"
John delighted in Sherlock's wide eyed look, and then the bright smile that took over his face. John knew that this was the place
Sherlock felt dizzy from John's attention and praise. He kissed him, grabbing at his shirt, Sherlock laughed, "I just got dressed," and John nibbled on his neck, "I didn't realize you'd look so gorgeous in these clothes."
Sherlock laughed, "They will already think the worst. We look as if we've rolled around on the ground and you're half dressed."
. Sherlock is absolutely so different with you. I'm so happy to meet you. Sherlock had been alone for so long. This is wonderful-"
Sherlock smiled, coming alongside John and lacing their fingers together, "Well, you always look nice, John." A light tone, loving, teasing his name up with an inflection at the end. John responded by giving him a quick kiss on the mouth. After they were dressed, Sherlock took his hand again and led him to the hallway, moving to the end of the deck towards the elevator. The ship was three levels, but all the levels were beautifully decorated. Light blue paint, bronze accents, recessed lighting, ornate carpeting and chandeliers in every large dining room. On the top level was where most of the 900 passengers convened when they weren't in their rooms or on the deck. This floor held a large dining room, a performance stage, and a smaller dining room for the captain and special guests.
"You really don't know, husband dear?" Mycroft asked, wiping his hands on a dish towel.
"Yes, yes love. I'm worried. Are you alright?"
Jaime knelt on Sherlock's other side, pulling his plaid back so he could look into his tear filled
(See the end of the chapter for
They sit together, side by side, and John wonders how he kept himself from touching Sherlock all these years. Their hands wind around each other, their fingers touch one another's faces, they talk as they've always done but they touch as much as they can. John still feels a little dizzy but he's not sure if it's the illness or having Sherlock so close, his eyes completely focused on John.
Sherlock knew he didn't feel about John what Mycroft felt for Greg, but John didn't displease or repulse him. He appeared kind, had conveyed he wouldn't expect what Sherlock wasn't willing to give, and he thought Sherlock was beautiful. He was the match that would keep their family from losing everything. He would need to be perfect.
Sherlock Holmes hated clan weddings. They were full of everything he couldn't stand. Being around people he didn't know, entertaining and dancing. It was exhausting.
Mother, I won't help you unload the truck."
"No, everyone I know is out on a mission. I don't want to impose. If I could just get a bite to eat then I'll be on my way..."
John and Sherlock pitch into a fit of giggles. This is what John loves and adores; they can laugh about the most inappropriate things. Murders, running after cabbies, shooting at people, there is no subject off limits to them finding hilarious.
Sherlock breaks the silence, "What did you discuss with my brother today?"
John is still rubbing his fingers and thumb, trying to push away past nightmares. He cannot talk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock feels like it's been Christmas Day forever.
Technicians were up there, holding onto Anderson, trying to untangle him. To give him room from the scaffolding that pressed against his chest and his sternum.
"Did you call 911?" John barked at Harry. She replied by holding up her phone. John went to the scaffold, but he didn't dare climb it. Any movement, any jostle, would cause the tangle of limbs and wood to crash against Anderson's windpipe. He looked slightly blue as it was. Everything was so silent, the only sound was the wheeze of Anderson's breathing and the nervous pacing of Harry in the house.
John nodded, patting his arm, "Well, I'm all packed, so tell me when you're ready."
, and it's easier to just go along with what you say. It's usually the right way to do things," he grinned at her, patting her hand. Sherlock couldn't help smiling, looking from one to the other.
"Was that our second date, Sherlock?" John smiled, pressing himself up against the detective, "If so, that was the best date I've ever been on."
With more kisses down his chest, Sherlock moves to raise John's hips and put a leg up over his shoulder. John feels everything stretch as Sherlock pulls his leg up and as he enters him.
Tavis laughed, "You most certainly do sulk. You fret and strop and get ridiculous ideas in that very smart head of yours."
"Quit messing up my sock index and get back into bed. We'd both be warmer if you'd stay."
"It's lovely," John said, "Hamish would have fun in your office with your chemistry set."
John kept himself locked in his room. Daemon and Sherlock waited up all night playing cards and reading up about Moriarty on every trade website and chat group. A horrifying pattern emerged. The company would have a safety visit, they would pass the safety visit with flying colors and then a horrible accident would happen some time later.
"Who will marry us? We need to get it completed right away?"
"No," Sherlock's voice was somewhat sharp, but it caught John's attention, "But in knowing this information we can prevent it from happening to someone else."
Sherlock grabbed Daemon by both sides of his head, smacking a kiss on his forehead, "Not nearly as good as John," he murmured, "but you are a conductor of light. Of sorts."
Sherlock put his hand on John's cheek. Sherlock's fingers rubbed the red-tinted beard that covered his cheeks and jaw, "I remember you. You looked so skinny then, and sickly. You were clean-shaven then. You look so much better now."
After calling into the morgue, Mycroft texted one phrase to John and Sherlock: 'Levl 3 officer P.O.W.'
John sat down, purposely avoiding Sherlock's gaze. He hoped the man was embarrassed and furious. John knew that yesterday he'd spoken out of turn, but it had been an honest mistake from simple curiosity. After his presentation, he paid attention to the speakers, making notes and making a firm resolution to pay attention and do better.
He turns his cup of tea, holding it in both hands, warming them, thinking of how in he and Mary's apartment there were hardly any books, no wallpaper, no bullet holes, no spray painted smiles.
"You're a genius, Mr. Holmes?"
Sherlock pulled back and looked at John. Again, he wanted to be swallowed up and never seen again.
John answered.
"I didn't say you were
For now, he is content to kiss Sherlock gently, wiping him gently with the flannel. When they're clean, he moves his body close again so they are wrapped together; Sherlock's leg wrapped around John's calf, John's arm wrapped around Sherlock, fingers dipping to stroke the curve of his back and his buttocks.
When Sherlock was excited, happy, or wanted John's attention, he would say his name with a bright tone. Jumpy. Emphatically. John's heart would race and the adrenaline would begin flowing. He knew that tone, that inflection so well he would hear it even when Sherlock was out of the flat. At first, Sherlock would say "John, a case!" But now , with their years of living together, he would simply say his name.
They stood there for a few moments, just holding one another. John broke the silence, "This is going to hurt to matter how much I put this off. Goodnight!" He pecked Sherlock on the lips, then walked off quickly towards the tube station.
. It glinted in the sunlight, the evening rays making the windows appear on fire. They didn't fully unpack, but laid out some clothes so they didn't wrinkle.
Sherlock breathed, nodding, looking at John's face for a long while before answering, "John, I am quite out of my depth, as I said. It's difficult for me to verbalize."
He paces the flat, making notes in his notebook, rethinking and rewriting what he will need to say, or what he may need to say in response.
"Yes, but," He gets up and paces. Walking to the radio to turn it up a bit louder. He pulls out a notebook, grabs a pen. He gestures for Mycroft to come stand next to him by the radio, so they can stand up and lean on the bookshelf. He begins to write a note where Mycroft can read it.
John, looked quite different, and much younger, without the mustache. After they were alone, he crossed the room the stand in front of Sherlock. They'd been dancing around each other, unconsciously avoiding each other, as they'd separately gotten ready.
Until John Watson.
"I don't work for 3 days," John said, pulling the blankets up around Sherlock's shoulders, "So if you need anything, holler. Hamish is a deep sleeper and his tutor will let him nap if he needs it."
Even though he knows Mycroft and half the British government is listening, before he hangs up he says "Imagine I'm kissing you goodbye."
Robert piles his documents from the safe into two files. He's getting everything in order, in case it doesn't work. He doesn't want any of the Holmes brothers to be in danger from documents being left out.
"Myc," Daddy interjects, "You do understand. That's why you're so scared."
"We normally do that, John, when we aren't running through the wilderness or hopping planes to other countries."
"When you grabbed the headboard, must have been, there's a little blood on the wall. You didn't notice when it happened?"
"John," Sherlock whispered. His body was so scrawny and tall. He pulled way from John, covering himself up from his gaze.
"Young man," She clicked at him, sitting on the edge of the couch, "If an 80 year old woman was able to take you out with a pan, I don't know how much protection you really are. And I'm still not sure what I need protection from. It's best you get feeling better and get on your way."
He drifted to sleep imagining what it would be like to have John carry him over the threshold of his own house.
Sherlock made a very strong pressed pot of coffee and sat down on the couch to eat some dry toast. Daemon was at the computer at the desk, near the window. Their heads snapped up when the bedroom door opened. John stumbled out of the bedroom. His hair was pushed in every direction and yesterday's clothes were rumpled upon his frame. John came over to Sherlock and laid on the couch, placing his head on his lap. Sherlock stroked through John's blonde locks.
"What an idiot!" Sherlock yelled, gesturing at the entire building, "They're all idiots!"
After brunch, John and Sherlock went back to John's flat to discuss Hamish's proposal. John's father was on the couch, his mother in a chair. They both had their heads tilted backwards and were snoring.They were covered in cut out bits of paper, as if they were furniture. The living room was a disaster. There was a notebook spread out with more cut out photos, notes, and diagrams. John knew that if he hadn't forbade taping papers on the wall that's where all of this would be.
"Why?" Mycroft is confused; why so calmly angry?
Sherlock felt a pang of sadness again. This was new, and foreign. He was unsure what to say or how to behave.
His brain stopped at that thought. To the outside, it may have looked as if he were having a small stroke. It looked like an honest to goodness family here. John was ladling out  stew into bowls onto plates with bread. John turned around, realizing Sherlock was still stuck, in the entryway, just looking and blinking at them.
"Sherlock, come help me with these sandwiches," John called into the living room. Sherlock didn't move. Sherlock didn't move until Hamish nudged his shoulder, "Daddy is calling for you, Mr. Detective."
"I like that your name is Sherlock Holmes. It's weird, like mine. I get made fun of. Did you get made fun of for your name?" Hamish had sat back down, pulling his chair right up to Sherlock's nose again, "Should I call you Mr. Holmes, or Mr. Detective? I'm not sure what's proper-"
The door bursts open; Roderick (presumably) and the crew with stretchers. One for Mary, another for Mycroft. They are both loaded up. Mary, covered with a sheet.
Tears pricked at his eyes as he breathed normally, through his lungs. The nurse counted his breaths, took his O2 saturation. Normal.
"Your lips, John, I would add just a bit of color to petroleum jelly and put it on your lips," With this, Sherlock leaned in even closer, smoothing a bit of jelly on his fingertip, with a touch of the color he'd applied to his cheekbones. Before he reached his lips, John dove forward, crushing Sherlock's lips to his own. Sherlock moaned, pulling back, "Or, kissing works, kissing would cause blood flow to your cheeks and lips, which would look gorgeous-"
"Why couldn't you just die on schedule?" Mary rolls her eyes, lowering her gun.
"I don't....I don't know. I just...." John buries his face into the crook of Sherlock's arm, "I'm just sad for some reason. Sad for all the missed time...the way I've treated you...I don't know."
Mary didn't ask for an explanation.
The taxi dropped them off at a two story, brick building. It had been converted to a group of flats. Sherlock mapped the location out in his mind. There were lights on in every flat except one that was on the second floor. As Sherlock was staring, creating a mental map, a black car pulled up. Mycroft and Greg got out of the car. Greg hugged John, and Mycroft squeezed his shoulder.
Sherlock shook his head, "It's not," he stopped, pulling his hands back as John tried to take them, "It's not
Robert had given so much, and would have been sent away, but been safe. He would have returned.
John withdrew his fingers and laid himself on top of Sherlock. He rested himself in between his thighs, grabbing his cock, rubbing the tip of his engorged member on Sherlock's stretched hole.
Dimmock turned to John, "Wait, he's Deaf, too? How the fuck is he supposed to interpret while still being Deaf. This isn't going to-"
John keeps his head down, murmuring, whispering. He feels, knows, Sherlock's breath is speeding up, more ragged. There is guilt, but he pushes it down. He wants to ask Sherlock if he will act like he did with Janine, with Irene; love and forget. Use and move on.
After waiting for 45 minutes, John sees an old jeep start to pull up the road, crunching gravel underneath the tires. John slowly moves out into the middle of the road, holding up his hand. He approaches the driver cautiously after they stop.  It's a young couple, out on a casual date.
"You're ticklin'me," John mumbles into Sherlock's arm; it's still laid over John's arm to protect his IV.
He didn't have enough energy to ask Sherlock if he was taking photos of this murder. Would've been in poor taste, anyway.
Moriarty is in hand; Magnussen will be disposed of. Roderick is leading a small band in the Czech Republic to be sure all the factions have been wiped clean.
Please read updated tags
Sherlock was red faced as he shifted his hips, looking intently at John, "Is this your idea of talking, then?"
"I need Magnussen dead by the 1st of the year. I need John to be close by to prove that you won't just disappear with him before you fulfill our agreement. Magnussen dead, you are free, John is safe."
, or when he last told him he loved him.
John pulled Sherlock close, "You're not the only one. Hamish is thrilled, and he's more at ease around other kids. You've taught him a lot, Sherlock Holmes, about how to rein in his abilities and when to use them for good and not for evil," John laughed, working at a way to express to Sherlock how much everything means to him, to his son, "We both love you. I know I've been a sappy mess lately, but it's because you're amazing. You're perfect for us."
John didn't understand. Surely they could climb up, untie him, get him down. Everyone could hold him up.
"Why are you crying? What's wrong?" John snaps, the words familiar, but he can't remember where he's heard them before.
"A normal, mortal way, you mean?"
because I've made my decision. You don't get to come down here until you've made yours. And you can't go back. I can't go back on my decision. I've already told you more than enough to show you. Be brave. You've got a brave heart, Mycroft, I see that. Put it to good use."
Sherlock wanted to ask more about his relationship with Greg, but he decided to leave it. It was past midnight, and the drugs were suddenly taking effect.
-----
John leaned away from Sherlock, looking from one to the other, "You bought my son a pig's ear, and a blow torch?"
"John, I..."
John led Sherlock into his flat. He rubbed his shoulders, the middle of his back. He could tell he was upset, breathing rapidly, eyes shifting.
Sherlock watched as John put lube on his fingers, wrapping them around Sherlock as he placed the condom on. He nearly orgasmed from that touch alone. Then, John took his fingers, preparing himself for Sherlock's cock. He drove one finger in and out, moaning, twisting himself on the bed, "Watch me," John begged, taking Sherlock's hand and placing it on his inner thigh, "think about me, wet and hot, just for you- Sherl-" he moaned, pushing a second an a third finger inside himself, scissoring them, pulling his quivering ring of muscle more open in preparation for his lover. Sherlock felt dizzy, staring at his erection, wondering how it would dare fit in that small of a space.
"I need to wash you, love, make sure I haven't hurt you. It was your first time."
"Hamish!" A sharp voice shushed from the corner.
"Mr. Holmes," William began, "Today is about your brother and his betrothed. Do not worry yourself over it. Rest, and when the sun has fully cleared the pasture of dew, we will go outside and the Clan Chief will bless their marriage. That is all you must concern yourself with."
Sherlock smiled at the excited child, "Yes, he was a very good friend."
"Sorry I didn't warn you," John continued rubbing his back, adjusting the rib bracing, "Generally if I just sit the person up without warning they don't tense up," John adjusted the brace again, "I'll have to look at your chest and ribs after breakfast-"
"Yes, all of this is Seanmháthair's recipes for my wedding."
Sherlock turned, legs constricted. He was incredibly warm. He pushed his arms to lift himself, but he was trapped. Sherlock thrashed himself back and forth, opening his eyes.
"Sherlock," John pulled on Sherlock's hand. They were at least comfortable with this gesture, "You may look at me, or touch me, whenever you would like to. Wherever. I will not touch you, or make you touch me, unless you explicitly ask me to do so."
"Works for you and I," Sherlock laughs, stroking John's ribs, his cheeks, his thighs. John moans into Sherlock's mouth, "You have lost weight, John Watson. You need to eat more."
"He hurt me quite a bit, the last time. Holding me down over a garage work table. I tried to cover the bruises, I stayed away, scared. He told me if I told anyone he would poison my dog, Redbeard. Mycroft found me. In the garden. When he sent me inside to my Mum and Dad," Sherlock's voice was shaking, tears falling, but he kept going, "Mycroft went next door and…. "
They are going to the house, the façade. Operatives in place.
Sherlock didn't answer for a moment. John put his hand on Sherlock's back, rubbing small circles in between his shoulder blades, "That's more than ok. That would be wonderful."
Sherlock shuddered, releasing onto his stomach. As he orgasmed, John felt his body shudder around his cock. The squeeze drove John to completion, pulling John's release out of him and into Sherlock's body.
Sherlock just shrugs his shoulders.
John looked at Sherlock, then moved closer to him, linking their fingers together, "You okay if I go down and cook you all breakfast?"
"Any idea how? When?"
Robert rolls his eyes and continues, "Whatever his name. You're more shocked by me kissing you than you'd be by me up and leaving. You expect the worse of situations and people. I know you, Mycroft. I'm here. You won't find that out for sure in my file, or my transcripts, or kidnapping everyone I know and bribing them. You're going to have to be brave and do what the ordinary people do. Love me back if you can. And ask me yourself. You can tell if I'm lying."
The first hours aboard the ship were insane. Dusting fingerprints, interrogations, running from hull to stern and through the docks. Sherlock had theories only when they collapsed into bed at 3am. They were too exhausted to be nervous around each other this night. The only thing Sherlock did out of the ordinary was run his fingers through John's hair a few times before he fell asleep. Otherwise, they were bed mates only.
Sherlock hands him a wad of cash, nods, and walks back another way home. He has to stop himself several times from buying cigarettes. John will smell and taste them.
"Aye," Eric yelled across the room, " 'Lock can sit by me for once. Misters Holmes-Lestrade were still shaking their bed-posts so I threw them some bread and ran away. They won't be joining us for a long while yet."
John is nearly delirious; Sherlock has to guide him to the bed by his hips and under his arms. After he collapses on the bed, Sherlock removes his coat and his shoes; he's too heavy and uncooperative to move him any further.
Laoch, the stallion, quickly caught up to John's mare, Soilleir. Sherlock laughed as he pranced the stallion in circles around John. John hollered at him, "If you're going to be a show off, I may change my mind!"
"Stop that. You stop that, right now!" His Captain Watson voice. It made Sherlock stand up taller, and give John his full attention, "I love you. I love you more than anything or anyone in this world. If you'd been shot, I would've died. I took that bullet for you because I am selfish. I couldn't bear the thought of watching you bleed again, or thinking that I might lose you. I couldn’t do that. So I took the bullet instead. Keeping you alive, having you alive, was all I wanted. You're alive, and I'm alive, and we're married. So stop. There is nothing to be guilty about. As long as you're here, and you want me, and you love me, it will be ok."
Hamish hugged them both, his head coming up to their chests. He was only able to reach half way around their middles, but his grip was strong. He looked up at both of them, "I will help protect you. I have been studying poisons, well, not poisons, really, more of stunning agents. I can put them around our flat, and they won't
The flat, in reality, was townhouse. 221B, Baker Street was a four bedroom with a large bay window overlooking a pebble-stone street. A large bedroom with a king sized bed, a sitting room, large kitchen, office and research study, and two rooms that housed various materials for his experiments and costumes for his work. John tried not to show it but he was gasping as he went through each room. It was updated, modern, but sparsely furnished.
He knows Mycroft and Sherlock will end up smoking. While wearing some patches. Adds to the pallor.
"Yea, well, you're an idiot always getting yourself into trouble, so I guess we work well together." Giggling, Sherlock dialed Lestrade to deal with the paperwork and statements. John could hear Greg over Sherlock's phone, "How much trouble can you two get
Tavis manhandled them around the shoulders, pushed them into the doorway, whispering, "Nevermind. I'll explain everything inside."
His shoulders are burning, his fingers ache, his eyes are dry.
Sherlock blushed, allowing John to lead him away, their fingers interlaced. John walked him to the smallest stable, pointing out all the flowers he was anxious to bring back to their home.
Sherlock set his violin down, holding only the ring. John could see just a slight tremor in his fingers. The detective reached around the breakfast tray and took John's left hand in his. He kept his eyes down, rubbing his fingers across John's knuckles before positioning the ring on the end of his finger. But he didn't put it on. Sherlock lifted his eyes, looking into John's face.
"How will I hide this from Sherlock?" John turns up an eyebrow.
When John was stable again, after surgery, he had been flown to London to be brought out of his coma. It wasn't communicated, but Sherlock knew that it was in case John didn't come out of the coma. If John died, Sherlock would at least be closer to his friends and family. Luckily, as one of the nurses explained, John was an army doctor, strong and stubborn, and had exceeded everyone's expectations.
"Come in, Captain Watson. Joseph Green. I only reached the rank of Corporal, but I was an assistant at times to our division's army doctor. What brings you here?"
John turned the knob. It was unlocked. Sherlock was in his bed, still in his nightgown and dressing gown, typing furiously on his laptop. He glared at John, turning his back to him.
swore someone stole his grandmother's ring. It was actually buried in the backyard. John growled, moving his kisses down Sherlock's neck towards his exposed stomach. He pushed the plaid aside as he went, "What did Harold do? I didn't see."
"Yes. I was scared but I'm glad you and daddy saved me."
"Just a few days, ma'am," John answered.
Sherlock was not excited to be stuck in the middle of nowhere.
"Sherlock is..." Tavis began, pausing to cough, "He's always been alone. He never let himself get close to anyone because he knew someday he'd be given in marriage to someone of means so the family line would continue. The Holmes clan took in we cousins that would've starved otherwise, which left them nearly destitute themselves. Sherlock knew how much his brother loves Gregory Leatrade, so he agreed to let Mycroft have his love match and Sherlock would have the match for money, the match in name only."
"Oh, oh Sherlock," John whispered, "What do you want?"
After he pulls the blankets up over him, Mycroft sits on Sherlock's bed, unknowingly on John's side, and smooths his brothers hair until he feels his breathing and muscles relax.
The nurse smiled, "They pushed it through with witnesses and the vows you wrote. We couldn't bear," At this she teared up, "to keep him apart from you, and knowing what was going on. We did have to separate him when he became hysterical, but he had more rights as a spouse. So they pushed it through, in case," the nurse shook her head, "you're an army doctor, you're stubborn, you've exceeded all expectations."
Instead of saying anything else, or looking at Sherlock, John ate. His eyes were on his plate, the only sound his fork scraping the ceramic. He waited for a response from Sherlock. He could dismiss the idea as silly. He could scrap everything. But he would know, by the look on John's face, by the way he was willing to take this plan even further from what Sherlock was thinking, that he wanted, or that he was willing.
Every light in the theatre was up. At 100%. Harry was yelling. She was shaking his arm, he was unsure where she'd even come from.
Sherlock wouldn't sleep. He would rest, and maybe quietly pluck at his violin.
"Are we ok, Sherlock? I don't want to ruin us. That would kill me. Are we ok?" John moved forward, sitting at Sherlock's feet. He'd tucked his knees up and wrapped his arms around them.
John smiled, sitting close so their thighs touched and Sherlock put his arm around John. Sherlock closed his eyes, listening to John breathe. He'd missed him just being near.
Sherlock answered simply, "Yes," and drove his elbows into the bedding, breathing heavily, thrusting his pelvis into John's.
Sherlock turned to Hamish before he began, "Are you still ok with this, Hamish? Do I still have your permission?"
"That's what Hamish said you'd say. We got you a small fridge for your office and put them in there."
Sherlock had a hundred thousand ways to say the name
Towards the end of the noon meal, when it was time to be preparing for the celebration feast, Sherlock took some time to lay down and rest. Sherlock caught himself touching his lips, wondering what it would feel like to put his lips on John Watson's lips.
Sherlock grabbed the stuffed elephant and bopped him on the nose, "No deducing. If he wants to tell me something private he will tell me himself."
The horse seemed gentle, so Sherlock rubbed its back, clicked at it, and hopped on. It moved to the side, but kept eating. Sherlock grinned. He felt incredibly tall, with his curly hair blowing in the breeze and the horse just slowly walking. He tapped the horse's sides with his bare heels, and the horse started to slowly walk, nibbling as he went. Sherlock couldn't keep himself from giggling. It was mid morning, the sky was sunny and lovely and he was riding a beautiful horse near his home. He let the worries of his arranged marriage fade away with the cantering of the horse's gait, as he held onto the horse at the tuft of hair at the base of its neck.
Sherlock turned to John, lifting his arm up to touch his cheek, "You didn't hurt me. It was perfect."
Sherlock breaks the silence, "This,
Sherlock shook his head, "Nothing so nefarious, Dr. Watson. As much as my brother and I do not see eye to eye, he is my brother, and Greg Lestrade-Holmes is my family now. We will discuss this."
No answer from Sherlock. Just a reply of him kissing and sucking harder on John's mouth than ever before. He unzips John's fly, pulling out his swelling cock in one fluid motion. Those gorgeous fingers, fingers that played violin and examined bodies at crime scenes, strokes John desperately. John moans, grappling to free Sherlock from his clothing.
in an exaggerated way. John grinned, pulling his fingers out of himself, dipping down to lay his entire body over Sherlock's to kiss him deeply.
"I, um, need to go check on John," Sherlock said barely above a squeak.
"We are a mess," he huffed, covering John's erection in the lubricant. He moved his fingers and wrist in a circular motion, alternating with a light flutter against his balls. John grabbed Sherlock's arse, turning and rearranging one another so they each laid on their side.
(I've met someone, Mummy, but there's so much more to tell you. I love him and I'm terrified.)
Mycroft leaves, John works on keeping his face open with sadness as he turns to face Sherlock. They press each other with kisses, rubbing their hands all over each other. As Sherlock packs, John gathers items from other parts of the apartment. He tucks some letters into pockets of Sherlock's luggage when he asks Sherlock to leave him a moment so he can cry a bit alone. He hugs Sherlock's pillow, breathing in his scent, and that's how Sherlock finds him when he barges back into the room.
"John, are you listening?" Sherlock was now right behind John, arms crossed.
"Beg me, Sherlock," he growls, digging his fingers into his lover more deeply.
He couldn't believe all these people were in his house. And that he didn't
Sherlock moved away from the window and sat on the couch, but didn't sit right next to John, "I'd like to still go through with the case, with the ruse of being a married couple, as this is the best way to get the results we need, to investigate everyone we can on the ship. But the idea is more nerve wracking than I anticipated."
Sherlock shivered. The sun was beginning to set.
John has told him, again, that he loves him. He cannot think beyond trying to keep tears from rolling down his face.
Hamish's eyes were wide. John glared at Sherlock. This was normally about the time the parents removed children from the conversation as Sherlock tended to either give children nightmares or make them cry.
"Oh?" Mycroft questioned, giving John a stare.
"Where is John? Where is my betrothed?"
John knew that he loved Sherlock from the very first time he saw him. The very first time they'd met. The first exchange of words.
Sherlock left Lord John Watson to sleep, the time now nearing 4 am, the light pink beginning to streak across the sky.
, as that is how he'd taken to picture his name. Sarah had laughed so hard she had changed his name plate to read 'Jawn Watson.'
"Oh my sweetheart," John roams his hands all over his face, his neck, his chest as he kisses him, drawing his upper and lower lips into his mouth, "You aren't foolish, you are brilliant, my sweet prince."
"Hamish is the expert on Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock didn't respond, "and I know you're mad at me, and I understand you're upset with me regarding Greg, but we're not leaving. According to Greg, because he's my friend, you haven't slept or eaten since you were at my house-"
Sherlock swallowed. He was worried for his family's sake, that he had offended his match, but John didn't seem to be withdrawing his intent to marry. He seemed to be staking a claim.
"Sherlock, no. I love you. I can't believe we didn't meet sooner. We are around the same people and in the same circles. I was mad you left without telling me. That's all. You're not a freak. At all. You fit right in."
"Ok, so I
John sat beside him, calling to William for water and honeyed bread. John tried to stand to bring Sherlock a wet plaid, but Sherlock grasped at his tartan, pulling him back to sit beside him. John enveloped him as Sherlock shifted, fitting his ear to listen to John's heartbeat.
Sherlock blinks. He can't recall being alone with a child, even when
As they were walking down to the cab stop, John took his hand in his, "You are brilliant and amazing, you know. I'm not sure why you're dating me."
Hamish grinned and ran out of the kitchen. He turned back and ran back to Sherlock. "Mr. Detective, daddy wants to talk to
"Shower, shave, for god's sake, brush your teeth, then you're taking me out for brunch," Sherlock quirked an eyebrow up at her, "No arguments, go!"
Tenderness. Mycroft reaches up to touch his face, "Yes, I'm fine, you and Sherlock, fussing."
"We are like the sun," John points to himself, "And the moon," indicating Sherlock.
Hamish crossed his arms and puffed out his lower lip, "Enough of that, I won't have two scientists that pout around here. To your room."
Sherlock stopped him, putting up his hand. He began talking at a breakneck pace, hardly stopping to breathe.
"And that upset you," She squeezed his hands, "Maybe Greg, as your brother-in-law, cares about you? And he wants you to be cared for? And he knows that it might be….well, hurtful to see someone who has gone through what you have? You took me in, Sherlock. You are lovely. Do not be surprised when other people treat you as if you deserve every kindness."
"No, no." Sherlock grabs his face, the sheet slipping down to his waist, "Tell me you love me again," John is amazed at the open and wonderful look of joy on Sherlock's face.
John pulls his detective, his love, to him and wraps himself around him. Grabs the blankets to pull up over them. Sherlock's eyes are wide and his brow furrowed. John strokes his face a few minutes until he relaxes into his touch; smiling slightly when John begins to speak.
"Yes sir," he exhaled. John was still not the suspect.
John caught Greg's eye, who shrugged and smiled, gesturing him to come sit beside him.
John continued to keep eye contact with Sherlock, his hand barely rubbing circles across his shoulder blades.
Sherlock crinkles his brow, "I'll squash you."
John notices the strange scrap of fabric wrapped around Sherlock's neck, in place of a scarf. It's a Tshirt.
Sherlock felt John's lips as he kept talking, "Your son was brilliant."
"Magnussen wants to hurt John," Moriarty snaps in the middle of a dull hostage discussion (when can you let Seb go? Honestly.) "You're going to need to watch everything with that man. He will breathe fire and set all the plans a flame." He flutters his hand up in a flick of his wrist and undulating fingers, whistling a mimicry of a bomb careening to earth. He ruins his own dramatic gesture by popping his gum at the whistle's end.
Sherlock wiped tears away with the heels of his hands. He realized he was shaking, and couldn't remember the last time he ate.
John left the flat and kept walking. He thought he would just be gone for a half an hour or so, but every time he thought of returning, tears pricked at his eyes and his hands shook again. He'd been a fool. Again.
"I can't believe you shaved it," He whispered, moving closer.
His heart pounded as he rounded to corner to the wife's home. What was he going to do? What would he say? He realized he was an idiot. He could've spent some time learning some BSL, but he hadn't. He downloaded an app on his phone and practiced just a couple basics.

2. Reminder: ADR = additional dialogue recording, also known as “looping.” The process in post-production by which an actor re-records his dialogue to be overlaid when the original sound recording made during filming is unusable. Most actors hate doing this (it requires them to reproduce a vocal performance without actually acting in the scene) but it’s almost always necessary for at least some shots, especially those filmed outdoors.

By the way, if you are wondering why each chapter isn't announced with a chapter number, just with its title, it's because serpentynka has laid out her printed version of this fic in that way and she asked me to follow the format of the print rather than the version on AO3.

1. I’ve kept Sherlock’s address as 221B Baker Street, but obviously I have presented a very different flat than the one in canon. I thought given the AU nature of the fic that I could get away with it, and that Actor!Sherlock would have a different sort of flat than our consulting detective.

1. I am probably fudging reality by involving studio executives from Universal in this situation. It is true that Focus Features is a division of Universal Studios, but Focus is itself a studio. Unless Universal put up some money towards the filming of “To a Stranger” it isn’t too likely that they’d involve themselves in this situation. My narrative problem was that I did not want to make Jim Schamus the bad guy here (by all accounts he is not in reality) and there’s nobody higher than him at Focus, he’s the CEO. So if I wanted higher-ups I had to invent some who worked for the next level up. Forgive the fudging. If anybody cares at all or is confused about the difference between studios and production companies leave a comment and I’ll attempt an explanation.

2. ADR = Additional Dialogue Recording. Commonly known as “looping.” Almost all films contain some looping; it’s damn near universal for outdoor shoots where wind and traffic noise and leaves blowing and shit often make the audio track recorded during shooting unusable. The actors go into a studio and re-record their lines while watching themselves so they can match their lip movements. Most actors hate doing this and most directors try and minimize the amount that is required. Bad looping is a hallmark of low-budget, poorly-made films.

I hope that, one day (and if serpentynka says it's ok) I will get to do Sketchy 2 and even ABHIL. In the meantime, I need to finish Two Two One Bravo Baker, then on to the next challenge. I hope to be co-podficcing Lifetime Achievement with consulting_smartass very soon, and Saving Sherlock Holmes is scheduled for after that. Chryse has just given me the green light to do The Ground Beneath Your Feet, which I am really looking forward to. Come and see me over on

7. Things I never thought I’d be doing for a fic: researching the E! television network’s late-night schedule of programming.
Thank you so much for all the lovely comments and kudos. Stay tuned for the next CS/AP joint project, Chryse's wonderful fic 'A Waste of Breath', which will begin posting 1 December.

4. The “Terrence” referenced is meant to be Terrence Malick. Sherlock already referenced him in the last chapter. The sort of film that I’m describing in Kanisza would probably require a director with pretty rarefied auteur sensibilities but the ability to direct intense on-location shoots and handle big sweeping productions. Malick directed The Thin Red Line and has that reputation.
So, this marks the end of our journey in this particular AU - unless Mad_Lori decides to write any more, that is! Thank you so much to everyone who has come along for the ride, and particular thanks to anyone who has been so kind as to leave comments and/ or kudos, all of which are treasured and gratefully received.

1. Where John and Sherlock’s agents are concerned, I’ve done a bit of conflating of the roles of agent, manager and publicist. Actors of their stature would surely have one of each and the things that Mike and Greg each say to them would probably more likely be handled by either their manager or their publicist. I wanted to keep the number of characters manageable so I’ve done a bit of poetic-license amalgamation.

Sorry about the disruption to the posting schedule. CS's laptop died on her, which really held up the editing. Hopefully back to normal now.
I hope that, despite the tears and trauma of this podfic, you have found something within it that speaks to you, as it did for me.
And that is indeed the whole of it! Thank you so much to all of you who have stayed with me for this epic journey through Book 1 of Sketchy - I know I haven't always kept up with all the comments but, believe me, each comment has been treasured, each kudos appreciated, along the way.

8. Only one person commented on the character’s names in the script. I came very close to naming those characters Benedict and Martin, but that was a bit too meta even for me so I went with the soundalike names of Benjamin and Mark.

At four o clock Jim was sweating like an idiot , he turned around after hearing utter silence for  an hour and noticed Sherlock and John were asleep ; John was snoring slightly but amazingly Sherlock was dead Silent , not even slightly moving in his sleep . He must have been knackered Jim thought to himself . He smiled at the opportunity to cool down as he noticed an empty lay-by in a wooded area to the side of the road . He slowly pulled the car over , careful not to wake the sleeping men in the car .  And stepped out into the sunshine . He walked into the wood , stumbling over the tree trunks , hearing the birds chirp in the sun . His skin felt like it was on fire and his throat was dryer than the Sahara desert . After ten minutes he noticed a small lake hidden in the tree sea . Jim quickly glanced around making sure nobody followed him and nobody could see his gigantic slashed body . He pulled the hoodie off from over his head , revealing to the empty wilderness his cut up arms and rolled up his way too baggy jeans up to his ankles , taking off his converse shoes . He placed his feet into the cool water sighing with relief at the serenity of it all , and began to wade in deeper . He cupped the fresh water in his hand and started to wash the scabbed up cuts on his arms clearing the dry blood off , to avoid infection . He winced as his fingertips scraped over the gashes but he knew dying from an infection was not the way he wanted to go ; he wanted it to be instant . He bent down to poor the cooling water over his face and head , and felt his oil pool eyes cloud over with tiny diamonds , revealing to him how weak his body was getting . Jim slowly stood back up from the knee high water , he smiled knowing there was probably not much longer for him  . One last adventure he thought longingly . He wondered back to the river bank to sit down , feeling extremely light headed . When his non existent bum hit the muddy bank he felt something hard in his back pocket . He reached into it and grabbed an old Nokia brick his brother had given him in case of emergencies. When he switched it on he found there was twenty missed calls and five messages . Four of them was his brother asking if he was okay and that Dr Hudson has called him in a panic . He answered him with a single word "yes" that should put the worrier at peace . The last one was from Dr Hudson (Richard must have given her his number ) it read ' Jim i know you have my car , I'm not going to press charges , just make sure you eat and I want it back as soon as possible ' . Jim laughed wondering why Dr Hudson was so calm . Then he heard a gasp behind him followed by Sherlock Ticcing ;" DOCTORS EAT SHIT SAMWITCHES ON TUESDAY " . He whipped around , suddenly self conscious of his cut up arms , yet his face burst into a giggle from the profound weirdness of Sherlock's tic . "What Time is it ?" He asked quickly pulling back on the hoodie , not even wincing at the pain of wet cuts on cotton . "Six " Sherlock said his eyes transfixed on Jim's arms . " Stop staring" Jim whispered." Where's Mr clean freak ?". Sherlock pointed towards a rock which John was stood pissing on . Jim laughed at Johns gloved hands curled around his quite proud penis . " I think we should rest here for the night " He smiled , " also I have something that could help with your tics " he whispered so John couldn't hear them . He pulled out a small baggies of weed and a lighter , a smile on his face . Sherlock laughed yet agreed ; anything to stop the constant irratiability of his condition . " I also got sombreros in my bag because you never know when you'll need them " he laughed .
"DEAD BABIES ON THE ROAD !" Sherlock ticked as the car began moving ; John just glared out of the window .
Sherlock whipped behind him his head ticking to the side as he turned . His eyes landed on a grinning Jim who seemed quite happy with his little stunt . "JESUS!" Sherlock involuntarily shouted . Jim slipped a cigarette out of the back pocket of his trousers and lit it with an unusually pink lighter . "They give the depressed lighters isn't that dangerous ?" Sherlock laughed . Jim took another drag of his fag and shook his skeletal head . Sherlock waited for an answer but his ticks made me shout again , as a parade of swear words left his mouth as his left hand painfully hit his chest . Jim's face didn't show an ounce of sympathy and Sherlock's contoured face may have slightly amused his sadistic emotions yet again . Sherlock waited for the roll of empathy to escape Jim but nothing appeared . " Presumed Empathy disorder" Jim whispered , sounding slightly embarrassed by his lack of feelings . Sherlock smiled and gestured for Jim to give him a drag of the cigarette his hand ticking slightly as he did it . Jim lifted it to Sherlock's  mouth smiling as the taller man actually coughed from a single drag . Sherlock's arm shot out and hit Jim's recent cuts yet again but this Time his tic was much harder and the sheer amount of pressure made a trickle of blood run down from under the t shirt sleeve and down his arm . Jim didn't notice the blood pooling down his  arm until Sherlock jumped . "Jim you're bleeding like EMO FUCK sorry but look" he shouted inwardly cursing himself for the inappropriate tic. Jim's blank eyes glanced down towards the blood following his bone structure down his arm . He didn't register Sherlock's unintentional insult , he just didn't really care . He noticed a black hoodie wrapped around Sherlock's waist and he figured out how to get past the guards . "Since that technically was your fault I need that hoodie " he blurted out . Sherlock hesitated then gave the hoodie blindly to the little Irish man . Jim laughed as the six foot three londener's hoodie reached down to his knees and how the sleeves reached past his fingertips . "So twitchy boy, you wanna take me back to our room !"
Sherlock  consumed the cheesy chips placed in front of his slightly shaking hands and then followed his roommates actions . His stepped from the room , thankfully not ticking like a crazy person again (though he guessed that was what he was due to Mycroft's reactions to him ) .
John glanced down upon his hands and  jumped back in shock . He hadn't washed every single part of soap of his hands before he stormed in on his unneeded roommate . "You have to let me in there I still have soap on my hands !" He shouted pleadingly , His OCD getting progressively worse minute by minute . Managing to hold back his tics for a few seconds Sherlock screamed “Tough!” Back at the man who was probably the cause of his episode .
Suddenly he felt a presence behind him and a firm hand grabbed his shoulder ...
Sherlock began to tuck into his fries his oceans of eyes casting over to the small Irish boy that was stuck in his mind . He watched Jim's skeletal hands pick at the small portion of food in front of him , judging the meal as poison . Sherlock noticed Jim's bird like features turn in his direction and began to set his face into a smile . At that precise moment a tic seized ahold of him , slightly jolting his throat and throw his head to the side . A fountain of food splattered the table , in Johns direction .
So when Richard hugged Jim's Startlingly fragile frame and left him in the company with doctor Hudson Jim's facial features barely even moved out of the blank expression that had been frozen upon him after he realised his suicidal plan had failed .
Dr Hudson lead him into her office . Thankfully her items were arranged in straight lines and no dust clouded the room . She motioned for him to sit upon the black leather sofa in the room . John did so , with a quick inspection for dust , because that could cause illness . He knew that . He’d always known that . He sat upon the sofa near the edge , as Dr Hudson pulled up a black chair , around sixty inches from where he was . “ Hello can you please tell me why you think you are here John , I’ve spoken to Mary before you arrived but I’d like to hear your side of the story “ She spoke reassuringly.
..............................................................
When the two misfits eventually arrived at the door they saw a furious Dr Hudson glaring right at them . "There's also cameras in the lunch room Jim, we didn't miss your little stunt" . Jim's bird like hands slid even further into the villas jumper that was covering him like a blanket . "Is there no privacy here?" John whispered to himself three tones over in the background . Johns foot was rhythmically tapping the floors of the room in twelve quick beats as he said this . "There's no cameras in your bedrooms , apparently watching you sleeping is intruding on your privacy " Dr Hudson said curtly . Jim smirked knowing he'd get away with at least one little error . "Do you want to talk here , or my office Jim" She continued patiently . Jim shrugged ignoring the crackle of the now dried blood upon his cloth covered arm . "Fine we shall talk here " . She threw John and Sherlock out like animals and then perched down on the brilliant white sheets and began ." You are beyond underweight Jim , you weight under 8 stone and you are a 6 foot man , do you understand how unhealthy this this " Jim shrugged again standing against a wooden cupboard picking at the ends of the black hoodie ."If you do a stunt like you did today again ,I shall have to attach you on to a feeding tube whether you like it or not okay ?" Jim shrugged but a glimpse of anger jumped over his face . Dr Hudson  exited the room , knowing that her orders were understood , as she went to open the door , her Prius car keys soundlessly fell out of her pocket as she bumped against the cabinet, Jim quickly swiped them before she noticed , and watched her slip out of the room . Suddenly the whole room began to feel small around Jim , he whimpered as he felt more emotion than he'd felt in a long time . Overwhelmed. Jim ran into the bathroom searching for the small  razor he found earlier . He locked the door ignored his roommates shouts for where he went - obviously dr rose had let the two back in . He ripped the hoodie of gazing at his scared pale white arms . The razor was behind the sink and when he found it all the emotion began to drain again . That was how he liked it . One cut turned into two , two into three , three into four and before Jim realised his whole arms was scattered with new ugly lines , barely any space was white anymore . Non of them seemed to be bleeding profusely so he figured he wouldn't stain  Sherlock's hoodie , so he threw it back on , yet the poor boy had no idea how he was going to get away with that 'stunt' . He flushed the toilet and exited into the room , only to enter pure darkness nighttime had emerged . Out of nowhere an idea flew into his head . He tiptoed towards Sherlock's bed , the curly haired boy was twitching in his sleep his legs kicking around and arms flailing around . "Sherlock " Jim whispered . He tapped the boys leg as it torpedoed towards him . Sherlock jumped up . His eyes gazing towards a snoring John and then towards a red eyed slightly freaky looking Jim . Jim jangled Car keys  in Sherlock's scrunched up twitching face . " Let's get out of here" he smirked .
John panicked even more so , physically shaking and tears pricking his eyes . A tragic gasp flowed from his mouth as he sped from the room , desperately trying to get to the nearest bathroom as fast as he could .
..................................................,.........
Alone at last he thought , yet an Irish accent was ringing silently within his head .
“It’s ok , I just don’t feel in the mood for lunch anymore “ Jim murmured and walked away from the taller man clutching himself the voices within his head chanting Sherlock’s words around and around in a circle . Jim scurried off to the nearest bathroom leaving Sherlock alone and embarrassed .
Sherlock became lost within his own thoughts , thinking about what this place would do to him . He didn't want tests that would apparently cure him , like he wanted to be cured he just wasn't some fucking gerbil to be played around with .
Nodded understandably,opening the door to the fast food restaurant. When they entered John was already ordering his face red as he repeated that he wanted a foot long turkey sub for the 12th time . A young woman was behind the till , her name tag read Molly , her face looked confused but her face was pinned into a pleasant smile as she began making his samwitch. " What do you want " Jim asked Sherlock , "Chicken tikka with FUCK cheese " he answered his head buried into his pyjama top. Jim smiles and gestured for Sherlock to find a place to sip . He walked towards the till as Sherlock sat at the furthest table in the ghost town of a subway . " Hi " Jim began his stomach grumbled as he began ordering but he ignored it completely . " just one chicken tikka sub with cheese and umm a Diet Coke and a child's salad " , the salad was only 60 calories he should be fine , if he didn't eat it all . Milky smiled and began making the food , after giving John his samwitch . " Are you sure you don't want anything else you look hungry " Molly said concerned . Jim violently shook his head waiting for the food then paying the woman .
. A saddened look upon his face as his own brother winced as he ticked upon him whilst hugging him goodbye ( his leg jumping up and a whistling noise leaping from his mouth ) . “Christmas?” Mycroft announced . Sherlock repeated and walked back into the centre .
Around an hour after lunch at the centre was meant to begin , Sherlock entered the canteen . He stared around the happily painted yellow walls that mocked him as if they were showing him that he was meant to be as joyful as them . A combination of smells filled the rather large canteen - which held space for up to fifty patients - but the stench of French fries overpowered them all .
An eternal pit of sorrow and pain was how young Jim moriarty viewed the world . He just wasn't interested in being alive , never was . He was tainted good for nothing and his figure was atrocious : pounds  upon pounds of invisible fat covered him yet he could see them , unlike everyone else . They made him mad . They made him rage . They made him stop consuming the fuel he needed to survive .
"What is going on here ?!" The guard said angrily yet sympathetically at the two boys . Jim noticed the sudden  disappearance of  his watcher and shovelled his almost complete meal into the duffel that was ticket under his seat . Sherlock watched his little leprechaun do this action , judgement casting over his face . Meanwhile John screamed "He spat his food at me !" At the guard ; disgruntled and angry expressions upon his face . Sherlock stared  at the muscular guard's angled cheekbones , glaring down upon him . Ticks jumped out of nowhere , he slammed his fists into his chest like a gorilla , painfully leaving ravishing purple bruises . Swear words blasted out of him too , he felt like all eyes were on him . "Oh ok " the guard whispered noticing Sherlock's incapability , and walked away Angered flooded through Sherlock's core ; he felt like a child . He felt like Mycroft was beside him again .
John began walking towards the bright blue door , he counted the squares on the pavement, careful not to step on any cracks ; or else what happened in the past may reoccur . He physically shuddered , sweat began to glisten his milky white forehead as he thought of that memory . He gulped the thoughts back down or else a flashback may happen and he really didn’t need that .
Richard was bringing his little brother to doctor rose after he almost died , after he had found Jim's quivering skeletal body on his bathroom floor , wrists slashed like he was in some sort of horror flick . It pained him to see Jim's undernourished bleeding body but it pained Richard more as he saw the everlasting grin on his brothers face as unconsciousness took him prisoner and he thought he was dead . Although he didn't see Richard sobbing whilst ringing for help
Sherlock arrives and meets the boys
Jim cleared his throat , rubbing his bony hands together to try and warm their constant coldness .
“Get your shit together we are leaving, couldn’t even make it through your own mothers funeral pathetic!” he glowered. Sherlock wanted to protest, several Oscar worthy comebacks coming into his mind but his twitches were making it impossible to talk. Before he knew it, Sherlock was pulled into Mycroft’s absurdly expensive posh and being driven away …
Johns eyes gazed over the two laughing men by the riverside , and then he looked down at himself , he felt left out . Alone . He didn't want him and his condition to interrupt them so he slowly walked towards the car . After opening and closing the door twelve times - the perfect amount - he sat in the front seat and turned on classical Fm for him to fall back to sleep .
John whipped around looked at the intruder that stood in his finally clean room . The intruder was wearing a black t shirt and scars ran down his arms , ruining his milky white skin , he was obviously in no rush to hide his problems . Black skinny jeans hung loosely off his stick thin frame as his coal coloured eyes travelled over johns gloves fingers and entire body from .
His sister , Mary, pulled up in the cobbled drive her hazel eyes brimmed with worry . “ I’m sorry John but this is for the best ,I can’t deal with you repeating the same thing constantly , trapped within nightmares even when you’re awake , you need help !” She said , kindly enough but to John it just felt like poison in his ears .He Stepped out of the brown Volvo, and closed the door . Once . Twice . Three times . His mind still wasn’t satisfied . Animalistically he grunted , with frustrations , was it ever enough ! John repeated the action another nine times , eyes clouding with anger as Mary’s sympathetic features became etched within his brain .
Jim smiled time for a quick game his mind thought to itself . "Oh my god there it is" his bony finger pointed to an empty spot in the road . "WHERE" John screamed "where!" .Jim continued pointing looking at the confused curly haired boy and the screaming one who was shaking with fear . " WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE !" John yelled obviously getting more agitated by the minute . Sherlock's shoulder jumped " I can't see it " he said matter of factly. " Exactly because we hit a fucking pot hole !" Jim smirked . Dropping the end of his cigarette to the floor in a flourish .
It was around twelve am when Sherlock was unpacking his bag , whilst Jim  was in the rooms bathroom .
Jim and Sherlock were already in the car waiting for John , neither checking if he was okay . John thought better of Sherlock but decided not to mention it . His OCD flared up as he went to open the passenger seat door , opening and closing it a whole twenty four times before he finally entered and sat down in a huff . " I'm sorry I really thought We hit someone" he grumbled .
Moriarty arrives
Dr Hudson’s-behavioural facility ; John read the title with increasing disgust - 11 vowels,  one off the perfect amount , well nothing about where he was going was perfect  . He didn’t want to go here . Nobody did . But his demons plagued him , constantly he counted to figures of twelve until he felt good , at peace with the world . But it was fucking irritating , like can you imagine constantly doing rituals , following an endless loop ?
Jim put on a random station this time on the radio and Home sweet home by Motley  crue came on , Sherlock began singing along . Jim smiled and so did John ; he looked at peace when singing he didn't tic and he could actually sing really well . Jim joined in smiling lightly at how he sounded like a drowned cat . John didn't he just sat there watching the road making sure nothing was hit . It was around six am now and they felt far away from the centre . The boys all looked pretty tired as the first rays of sunlight hit their eyes . " Which beach did you want to go to " Jim asked Sherlock his eyes glistening from the light. Sherlock's mind ran back to the memories of his lovely mum skipping along the shore line shouting out to him . The one with the stripey lighthouse . John grunted and rolled his eyes . " How far away is that " he stopped " How far away , how far aw..." he stopped mid tangent and looked out the window , slightly embarrassed as he heard Jim bark a laugh . " Ages , about SHIT. two days more heading south " Sherlock answered his neck twitching . Jim smirked and continued driving .
They reached the cafeteria when Jim piped up “ And finally the sweet smell of gourmet shit “ he sang . Even the smell of food was making him nauseous he was looking fat apparently and he just couldn’t eat . He couldn’t . He wouldn’t !
Sherlock laughed , completely unaware of Jim’s subconscious thoughts . The small Irish man gazed into Sherlock’s ocean waves of eyes as a tic took ahold of his body out of nowhere and his arm flew out and grabbed the top of Jim’s arm . Jim yelped in pain Like a puppy that had just had its tail stood on , as Sherlock’s delicate fingers grasped upon his still bloody cuts . “ HAH FATTY” Sherlock ticked again , absolutely mortified that he was verbally and physically abusing the poor man . “ oh my god I’m so sorry !” He gushed as Jim stared down upon his non existent stomach .
(See the end of the chapter for
Three seconds (or eternities) later Sherlock was out of there. Away from the Judgement from his mother’s friends and acquaintances and not to mention his brother, he was free. Well from them anyway, twitches, tics and shouts were hijacking his body flying out of him like vomit. He was screaming now, all he wanted was one day of freedom, one day to mourn the only person that’d ever loved him. His size eleven boots kicked at random plants, like why did tulips have the right to be happy when his life had just been hit by a wrecking ball? . Sherlock flung his tall misbehaving body into a pair of fire engine red doors, to control his now shaking, grunting, body. HE slid to a seating position and hugged his knees, wallowing in his own self-hatred and pity.  Suddenly Mycroft emerged his face, one of nightmares.
Sherlock's mind clouded over , anger swarming his head like bees as his tics were taking control of the situation , instead of himself . The man in the long grey coat did the one and only thing he could do , so Sherlock does to the rooms ensuite and shoved his head under a tap streaming water to try and stop himself from ticking anymore obscenity's .
Three weeks later it was when Jim was declared healthy enough to exit the hospital but Richard had sent him here to doctor hudson which merely flew past him ruined skull .
Tics still exploding from him , Sherlock was getting mad .Why couldn’t John understand that he had to regain control of himself alone ? Suddenly a marvellous idea entered his head , he knew it was wrong to play on his roommates OCD but desperate times caused desperate measures . Sherlock began to blow raspberries upon his forearm so John would think he was contaminating the bathroom .
When Jim emerged , looking rough , from the toilet stall , the sympathetic look upon Sherlock's face was enoughI’m for his black eyes to brim with tears . "Hey it's ok , come here " Sherlock said feeling oddly comfortable with the Irish lad hugging him . Jim wrapped himself within the taller boys arms and sobbed into his grey coat , barely caring about his appearance. Sherlock held in a gasp , as he felt Jim's sharp ribs dig into his suntanned six pack , and Jim's skeletal hips jut into him .  Jim's tears began to stain upon the cloth after around three minutes . Jim began to move suddenly aware that he was crying into a complete stranger , but at that exact moment a tick seized Sherlock , making his body shudder , a vocal squeak jump out of him and his leg jolt backwards .
................................................................
Screaming and shouts could be heard from the end of the hall way as Sherlock made his way to the door of his room . "I saw you putting the bottle in John!" A female workers voice shouted as Sherlock entered the pristine room . The worker was black with a button nose and curls in her hair net . She was a nurse's uniform and smiled at Sherlock as he awkwardly stuck both his middle fingers up at her with a tic . Within one of her gloved hands she held a bottle of vodka , she touched the smaller boy as he went to grab the vodka from her hand .
