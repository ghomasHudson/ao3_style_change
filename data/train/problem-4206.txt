answer, given that he’s saved his life twice now. Surely, he must be misinterpreting somehow. These are angels. Servants of
“I’ll trust you when you start giving me answers. Until then, I don’t know where we stand, Dean. You were wrong to assume I’d do as I was told just because of my faith in God. And I...I’m not strong enough to be who you or heaven needs me to be. I’m tired. I can’t kill my brother even if I
He stands there, staring at it uselessly, watching its pages unfold in slow, empty listlessness, unfurling empty words as useless as the day Castiel first held the book in his hands.
Balthazar shakes his head. “You know how he gets. These past five months have been rough, Castiel. For both of us.”
“There’s a small cave just underneath there. You’ll have to squeeze through, but that should take you out and towards Dean.” A sudden urgency seems to grip Garth at once. “You have to go
Castiel drives in a separate car. He tells Balthazar to drive back to the house without him, telling him that he’d catch up. Hoping to clear his head, Castiel stops at a gas station on their way back, hurrying into the bathroom to splash cold water onto his face. His head is spinning with questions he does not have answers to, nor does he think he
Jodi raises an eyebrow in surprise as she glances at Castiel; Castiel, a small, quiet boy who wears a shining music pendant around his neck draped over a dirty, oversized trench coat.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Yes. I assumed as much.” The two dancers they’d seen by the door look over. The taller man with dark hair and freckles below his eyes winks at Castiel again. He shifts in his chair, catching sight of Dean’s wide grin.
“My dad chewed me out for that,” Dean admits. “And...for the first time in my life, I snapped right back at him. Felt pretty good, to be honest.”
Dean watches in disbelief as Castiel silently takes his brother’s hand and begins walking towards the door. Their father glares at them both, arms folded, leaving Dean in the middle of the yard.
Feeling frustrated and more confused than ever before, Castiel hesitantly slides out of bed and makes quick work of discharging himself from the hospital against the advice of the secretary and two nurses. Not like he could tell them an angel healed him - he’d be checked right into the mental wing. He hardly remembers physically climbing into the front of his old junker or driving to Balthazar’s empty house. He was there, and then he was standing in the living room, his Bible clutched tightly in his hands. Balthazar is nowhere to be found.
Benny nods quietly. Outside, the two can hear the buzz of the summer crickets in the grass. Dean swats away a few gnats, wiping a small bead of sweat from the side of his head as he folds his arms.
Castiel shakes his head slowly. Disbelief marring his features. “That was you...speaking? At the gas station?”
“You’ll play three nights a week for private performances; Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights. If people request a song, you are to play it back. You’ll be expected to know a wide variety of music and play for the older gentlemen who come into the club. And your shift will begin at 11:00 p.m. each night and go until 1:00 in the morning. Is that understood?”
“He will,” Dean says quietly. He shifts his weight between his feet on the grass, shoving his hands into his jean pockets as they watch Gabriel gather more flowers.
“Dean,” Castiel says slowly. “This isn’t you. You didn’t want this. On the beach, remember? We were going to run. We were going to figure this out
Dean blushes, but that seems to be exactly what Benny wants. He laughs wholeheartedly as Dean rolls his eyes, tempted to kick him in the knee. But he doesn’t. He settles for returning a punch to Benny’s shoulder, instead.
, no matter how much he was told otherwise. Sam had been silent on the matter. They had a roof over their heads; that’s all that mattered.
Castiel feels like he might pass out. He ignores it as they climb out of the car and hurry inside through the front doors.
“It’s -- it’s not just about that,” Dean sighs. “I just...I don’t know. Don’t you feel like you need a break? We could get the hell outta here for a little bit...maybe just a few weeks. A month over the summer before you go back to school.”
Castiel’s face pales at the mention of the apocalypse. His fist clenches at his side as he tries to fight off a wave of nausea curling up through his stomach. “What sorts of things would she say?” he asks slowly.
But Lucifer still wouldn’t answer his call. And anyway, Castiel doesn’t want to sleep again. He doubts that Dean would come into his head again to pull him away from another, horrifying nightmare like he had the night before. Cryptic and strange as Dean is, Castiel finds himself fascinated by him and what he’s able to do. An angel of the Lord. Meeting an angel seems like a fate reserved for those living in Biblical times. Then again, Castiel thinks, that might just be his reality now.
On the last day of school before Christmas break, Dean is finishing a shift at the garage when Castiel comes to visit him with his little brother bundled in a dark, green jacket and hat, trotting along loyally beside his older brother. He hasn’t seen Gabriel often; occasionally, he’d wave at the kid if he walked Castiel right home after school, his little face always pressed up against the window in wait for his older brother.
a bad idea, but Dean doesn’t care. He can take a beating. He can’t take letting these three boys win.
“Gonna brainwash himself. I know. Trust me. Come on - the exit to your heaven is here. We don’t have much time.”
Dean rubs his hands down his face. With a jolt, Castiel realizes that “every angel hating her guts” doesn’t extend to him.
Another early chapter! There's one more after this that I will post on Tuesday. I can't believe this is almost the end.
“I think so. Dammit. I wanted to, um, make you food. And for myself. Didn’t work, though. Uh, good morning, by the way. Did you sleep okay?”
Castiel feels tears burn in his eyes. He curses under his breath, kicking aside his bag in frustration as he tries to press the back of his hand against his mouth to ground himself.
Dean reluctantly agrees. Without another word, they turn, scurrying back the way they came without looking behind them. After five minutes of speed-walking, the boys slow their pace again.
Unable to believe what he’s hearing, Castiel shakes his head, bringing his hands up to grip his hair tightly in his fingers. He feels utterly and completely lost. Spinning along a tidal wave of pain and frustration with no end in sight. He looks at Dean miserably, fighting the urge not to cry.
. I won’t stop believing in that, now. You can kill me...you can...do whatever you want with me. But I won’t say yes. I won’t watch you burn the world. And I won’t let you turn into something that you aren’t.”
The word destiny sends an uneasy chill down Castiel’s spine. “Destiny?” he asks quietly. “Dean, perhaps if I were younger I would have accepted that more willingly. But I’ve come to...ask questions about the way I was raised. It was wrong. It’s not my destiny to do anything. I’m not some tool for angels to wave around.”
Castiel. He made a deal, a deal for power. Your brother will be able to wield the power of the Devil himself, be a proper, powerful vessel in life and death, all for the price of one soul:
A Bible verse. Could that be some kind of sign? A message indicating Lucifer is in danger? He climbs out of bed, grabbing his Bible and quickly flipping to the indicated passage and reading it silently to himself. A chill creeps into his spine as the words seem to blur together on the page.
“You punch like a freaking girl,” Dean laughs weakly. Stars dance at the edge of his vision. But the comment earns him another blow to the eye. His vision blurs, and he barely makes out Castiel stalking over to the group of them. A glint of silver catches his eye.
“You killed me,” Benny rasps. “You killed me. You killed me, you killed me, and maybe if you’d have kept it in your goddamn
He helps Castiel to bed, shedding his jeans and shirt until he’s comfortably curled into the mattress. Dean slides into bed with him - that had been something they’d been doing, too. Sleeping together, quite literally, if not in the colloquial sense of the term. Dean holds Castiel close to his chest as he weeps into his pillow, missing his brother, missing Balthazar, and wishing his mother was still here. Eventually, Castiel cries himself to sleep.
Pressing up into the kiss, Castiel sighs against his mouth, gripping the back of his neck tightly to draw him closer. His fingers of his free hand ghost across Dean’s ribs before settling on his hip, urging him closer. Castiel prods into Dean’s mouth with his tongue, tasting him with a soft moan before his fingers card through Dean’s hair.
Castiel breathes a sigh of relief, even if he isn’t going to pretend to understand what Dean means by a “pocket dimension.”
Castiel shakes his head, watching him fondly. “It’s okay. I think it’s about time I climb out of my shell now and again. I...I enjoyed watching you.” He’s definitely tipsy by now. His courage astounds him as Dean raises his eyebrows. Though it’s dark, the lights from the club illuminate their spot by the car as Dean leans back against the hood.
Dean glares at him. His accusation strikes a chord in Dean - Castiel can tell. “Yeah, I am. What about it?”
Sam looks up. The faded bruise across his jaw is answer enough. Dean’s eyebrows crumple with concern before he has to look away. Before, the sight of an injury like that would make him feel numb. Lost. Afraid. But now, it only makes him angry. Angry and willing to do whatever it takes to keep his little brother safe.
Dean flushes all over again. He blinks, trying to find the words. He always knew that...didn’t he? That he loved Castiel. He simply never strung those words together before. He’d do anything for Castiel. He’d looked and looked and looked...followed the stories. He’d stood up to his brother. He’d wanted to run away with him, to be by his side…
to risk it all to grab your ass outta that hole. Don’t take me for a blind soldier, Castiel. I know of heaven’s flaws. I didn’t want this town gone any more than you did.”
Castiel laughs breathlessly. With fondness in his eyes, he looks at Dean with a lazy smile, stroking the back of his head as Dean grins up at him sheepishly.
So he had been led along. Castiel’s fingers twitch by his sides. “I am going to kill you, Dean,” Castiel whispers. “Perhaps not today, but — “
day - only about a year before their father would pull them from public school and keep them on the property. A year before he would lock himself in his room and not come out for days at a time. A year before their mother would begin to retreat into her bedroom for long hours until she never came out at all. A year before everything became lonely and terrible and Lucifer would smile less and less until anger and resentment took the place of a once-happy child.
“I get it, man,” Dean says with a shaking voice. I can’t leave my brother, either. He needs me...even if he thinks he doesn’t. But that doesn’t mean you have to...do what you’re doing.”
“breach a den of iniquity” if it meant receiving the answers they were looking for. A part of Castiel wants to know how Dean is so familiar with the location and gender of clubs like this - another is too bewildered to even try to broach the subject.
“Place your fingers here,” Castiel says quietly. “Would you like to play that song you showed me? ‘Goodbye Stranger?”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel says quietly, rooted in place at the entrance to the barn doors. “I don’t understand what you are or what you want. What did you do to my brother?”
And here Castiel is, asking him to do the very thing Dean wants more than anything else. But Dean knows, better than anyone, that he can’t leave.
place any angel would look for me. They’re too uptight. I’m not even kidding - you know how many enemies of heaven have slipped under the angels’ radar because they decided to hide in a strip club?”
Castiel sighs. He takes the Bible into his lap, opening the cover and thumbing through the familiar pages with soft eyes.
But Castiel had received no answer. Pocketing his phone, Castiel lays back on the bed, giving himself a few moments to shut his eyes before he begins tracking down whatever had caused the gruesome death of Luke Wallace, a local man who’d been found with a throat full of razor blades.
All eyes are on her as her voice cuts off. She tilts her head, as though straining to listen. Castiel draws in a sharp breath. Dean. He had been expecting a far more...commanding name. A name fit for a demon or perhaps even a god - not a human. Pamela lets out a low laugh, speaking to this “Dean” that only she can see and hear.
“Yeah, yeah, sure...maybe tomorrow then?” he asks hopefully. “You can meet my brother, Sam. He’s a weirdo, but I promise he’s not a jerk like your brother is.”
“Jo!” he calls out. “Jo, I...I understand, okay? I understand.” He runs his fingers through his hair, grimacing as he calls out her name again and again. “I’m sorry. I was a coward. I want this - I want to do this. Please, Jo.”
Breaking into the old gas station across the field is easy. And much to his relief, the fridge is stocked with water. He drinks enough to satiate him without the threat of throwing it back up again and digs into the first granola bars he can find. When he’s fed and watered enough to think more clearly, Castiel touches his right shoulder. It tingles and, for a moment, it burns when his fingers brush against the skin. Raised skin, like an ugly scar. Castiel is sure to have many more of those.
Castiel raises a hand, shaking his head. “No. I have to go. He’ll...take it out on Gabriel if I don’t.” At his side, Gabriel tugs on his coat with a whimper. His wide eyes fill with fear as he looks up at his older brother. Softly, the boy’s lower lip begins to tremble. He looks more afraid of their father’s anger than he was being hit by the car.
“So what’s your plan, then?” Castiel asks quietly. “What is your end goal? Keep sleeping around, keep taking drugs? Keep up appearances until you eventually all just...die?”
“Dean. This isn’t you,” he whispers, his voice raspy and dry with the pain ringing through his head. “You...you know me. You
"Not likely," Naomi scoffs. "Give me the girl, first, and maybe we can work out a deal. You angels still honor the old practice of
Castiel follows Lucifer’s gaze towards their house upon the hill. In a long skirt and button-down shirt, their mother jogs down the hill, eyebrows raised in delight. Castiel’s heart swells, his eyes filling with tears at the sight of her - happy, not hunched in bed, out in the sunlight. Her long, black hair is tied neatly in a bun, concealed by the small, white hair covering she always wore whenever she left the house.
He’d recently shaved, and no scars mark his face from where they’d been etched into his skin for as long as he can remember. If this “Dean” had truly raised him from hell, he had put Castiel back together, molecule by molecule. He had made him
Dean shakes his head quickly. Castiel is amazed at how quickly Dean can regain his composure, as though he didn’t just come across Castiel’s hand for the first time in his existence less than a minute before.
He's greeted by a dark hallway with several doors on either side. The thud of music sounds from someplace upstairs, mixing with the loud, ceaseless chatter of voices. Down the hall, a cracked doorway reveals a beam of dim, purple light and quiet, older voices. Softly, Dean creeps closer to the door, straining his ears for any sign of Castiel on the other side.
“Jo!” he roars. “Tell me what’s going on!” He closes his eyes, his jaw clenched tightly as he stands in the middle of the quiet, empty street. He’s alone. Save for the wind chasing an empty can past his feet, nothing makes a sound. Not even the cry of a bird.
at working with his hands. In John’s rare moments of letting his gruff exterior come down a notch, Dean’s father even remarks that he might be better than his old man, someday. With the steady business of the garage providing a small but comfortable income for the family of three, John has no qualms talking to Dean like he would be taking over the garage when John is too old to work it himself anymore.
But he doesn’t. It won’t matter, now. Maybe his mother is here in heaven, somewhere, but this isn’t her - it’s only her memory. He forces himself to look away from the pond, away from them both, and away from the perfect memory with an ache in his chest that he can’t seem to shove down. He lets the tiny bit of Jo’s grace tug him towards the dirt path leading off the property, guiding him in the right direction as he trudges along the path with Lucifer’s laughter in the distance and his childhood home watching over him like an angel on his shoulder.
He hurries in the house, flying through the door with Dean following quickly from behind. The sight before him makes him jump into action; in the kitchen, Balthazar struggles with the raging figure of a woman pinning him against the kitchen counter.
And now, this strange string of killings that appear to be targeting hunters and nothing else. He can’t help but wonder if they’re connected somehow.
Climbing off the bed, Castiel shakes his head. “No, not yet...she seems to be conducting some sort of ritual, though. I wasn’t able to get all the details.” The two meet eyes, and Castiel has to surpass a shiver. Uneasy as he is in the presence of an angel - one who saved him from hell, no less - his fascination with Dean is apparent on his face. All at once, Castiel is reminded that Dean is entirely unlike the image of biblical angels he’d ever pictured in his own mind. Admittedly, he is just as beautiful. Though he takes on the physical appearance of a human, Castiel finds himself captivated by his bright, focused eyes and the easy, cocky stride he takes whenever he walks into a room. He looks and acts like any other man, with all the unearthly power of a being he never imagined could be any more than a biblical allegory, a story to inspire faith and wrack fear in the hearts of those who dare deny God’s presence. Perhaps that is still true. Castiel doesn’t know.
“You didn’t take your grace back,” Castiel notices. He assumes so, anyway - angels don’t need to eat, even though Dean has expressed an affinity for burgers in the past. But now, Dean is wolfing down his cereal, clearly
Castiel doesn’t look at her. He knows she’s right, but the feeling of deep-seated helplessness in his chest refuses to believe it.
“Cas, I was the one that put him in that cage,” Dean whispers. Tears well up in Dean’s eyes as his lower lip trembles. Castiel doesn’t think he’s ever seen him in so much pain. “I’ve done so much wrong. I can’t live with myself anymore - I have to just...I have to do what I’m supposed to do. What I was always meant to do. I’m not strong enough to do anything else.”
“You’re hiding her,” Castiel says slowly, realization dawning in his voice. “You’re...disobeying heaven to protect her.”
Patting his leg, Jodi gives him a small smile. “If you ever need anything else, my door is always open, kid,” she says. He nods, rubbing the back of his head. Dean thanks her again before she shoos him out, telling him to get home and do his homework that Dean already knows he isn’t going to do. He walks home alone, quickly, grateful that he’s beaten his dad back to the house when he finally pushes through the door. Dean would start heavily working in the shop next week, and he’s grateful he’d be able to hide his injury from his dad, at least for tonight. When Sam asks about it later, he says he got into a fight and doesn’t say anything more.
Castiel rubs his eyes with a yawn. “Fine,” he says simply. “I got the job. I was up late. It’s why I’m so tired.”
He shrugs, grabbing his baseball from the floor and tossing it up into the air. “It’s a job, at least.”
Dean climbs back into the car and drives with Sam beside him, a knowing smile stretched across the younger Winchester’s face. They drive and drive until the small, stuffy down trails behind them in the brilliant sun, a speck of dancing light. Just another forgotten sunbeam, a place they once called home...a place that never could have been home. Not really. Dean doesn’t know what he’s destined for, and neither does Sam. But what they both understand is that the small town with all its bells and whistles isn’t home. Home might be in the back of a car. It might be someplace on the other side of the world, waiting with outstretched arms and an offering of belonging neither brother could find in the place they’re leaving behind. But
way in which Castiel conveys that he nearly killed himself, Dean stalks forward and grabs Castiel by the shoulders, shaking him hard. “Tell me you didn’t gamble your life like that!” he roars. “What were you
Castiel nods. He gives Dean a miserable look as he climbs into the ambulance with the EMTs, leaving Dean alone outside. Finally, the EMTs slam the door and the ambulance screams down the street with Michael in close pursuit. Dean watches them go, feeling dizzy. He doesn’t understand what just happened, but something tells him that making the police call was the right move. He feels dizzy and disoriented. Everything had happened so fast, he didn’t get a look at Gabriel, and couldn’t tell what had happened to him as a result.
The other stands, approaching the bed with a slow shake of his head as he peers at him. It’s unnerving, seeing himself stare at him with such focus. Castiel forces a swallow.
“I know, Dean,” Castiel sighs. His head hurts, and his whole body feels weak and unsteady. “I know. But I don’t know where he is, where to find him, or how to stop him. If you expect me to be able to kill him...then you’ve got the wrong guy.”
“But you’re a good little soldier who does as he’s told,” Castiel whispers. His eyes are dark and full of grief as he looks miserably at Dean.
he said. Castiel feels a sinking sensation creep into his stomach as he tries to find his voice again.
echoes through the night. The barn roof splinters and caves in as one of the great meteors crash down through the ceiling, nearly causing Castiel to lose his footing.
Castiel looks up at Dean with a puzzled expression from across the kitchen table. They usually spend their time in Dean’s bedroom. But today, with Dean and Sam’s father taking an early shift at the garage and Sam at one of his afternoon clubs, Dean and Castiel have the house to themselves. Dean hates that it’s such a relief that he doesn’t have to worry about his father’s quiet glares or suspicious looks in Castiel’s direction - but it makes a world of difference. Still, Dean keeps glancing out the window, worried for the moment he would see his father pull into the driveway.
“So...yes. Guilt is what I feel towards Benny Lafitte.” He shakes his head again. He can’t believe he’s just
“Well, it’s nice to meet you too, Castiel. You know, I usually don’t do this but...I just wanted to say that it isn’t bad to have fun here. When I used to dance, a lot of clients felt guilty about what they saw and what they wanted. Mostly the men. You aren’t hurting anybody by letting yourself have fun. And the guys here are super nice...they like making people feel good. Just remember that, okay?” Castiel looks at him with a weak nod. His words seem to settle under Castiel’s skin, making him feel antsy and on-edge. Maybe he’s right. Maybe he isn’t. Castiel doesn’t know, but he does know that he’s sick of being afraid.
“...never evil,” Castiel finishes for him. “He was dark. He was...angry. Our father is to thank for that. He...he never...quite fit in with the rest of us; the women our father brought into the house, our mother who just...stayed in her room all the time. Lucifer never wanted to study his verses, never wanted to go to church. And none of that is all bad. But...I don't know. He was so angry all the time. Sometimes I don't think he knew what to do with himself." Castiel draws in a slow, shaky breath.
“Hi there. Are you the new family next door?” he asks. He leans against the door frame. His bright, blue eyes pierce right through Dean’s, making him wince uncomfortably.
he can’t help but see in the angel’s eyes. From the day they met, everything about Dean had shattered every expectation Castiel had about angels and faith.
Their movements are coordinated, quick, and learned. A job well-practiced. Castiel is transfixed as he watches them, a lonely, perverted onlooker in the night. He feels ashamed like he’s spying on something he has no right to be looking upon. Slowly, the man moves his hands to box Castiel’s ribs, his lips pressing firmly against the base of his throat, down his chest, down to his stomach, past his hip bones. With Castiel’s legs propped upright, his thigh conceals the man’s face as he dips his head between his legs, bobbing up and down as Castiel grabs the other’s hair, his free hand fisting through the sheets in the low lamplight. This man looks like Dean. Dean, the angel who isn’t
Castiel laughs, relief flooding through his body. His legs feel weak, but as Dean watches him, clearly surprised, he begins to laugh, too.
“Who is killing the angels? How are they doing it?” he asks her quietly. Her red, swollen eyes blink at him curiously. Studying him.
“I am no soldier,” Dean says quietly. “I am something you do not understand. Just because we — we were close does not mean you have the right to make assumptions about me.” His eyes glow - a warning. A warning that may have frightened Castiel once upon a time. It does nothing to him now - he’s seen Dean at his most vulnerable,
"Dean, we get our own bathroom. That's like, insane. And with dad’s friend selling him the new car garage, we’ll actually have money for once.”
“The existence of angels implies the existence of God and Heaven,” Castiel murmurs. “Implies that my...my father’s faith is, perhaps, not without the extremism I assumed he came to adopt later in life.”
“I-I’m sorry, Dean. I can’t. I just...I need to sleep. You should too. Balthazar’s bedroom — you can sleep there.”
On autopilot, Dean dives forward, grabbing Gabriel harshly by his waist and pulling him back against Dean’s body. Dean hits the pavement hard, just out of the way of the car that comes to a screeching halt. He barely feels the searing pain of the pavement digging into his arm or the bloody rivets scratching up his skin. Gabriel whimpers, but the boy doesn’t cry. Carefully, Dean lets him go just as Castiel reaches them. His face flushed, Castiel inspects his brother for any cuts or bruises as the car pulls up to the house. Dean stumbles to his feet, grateful when Gabriel seems to be fine - just shaken. Castiel tries to chastise him for playing in the road, but he’s too shaken to be angry - he pulls his brother into a weak hug instead as Dean tries to brush himself off.
Sometimes, Castiel will sit outside by the makeshift graves. Even in late February, Castiel can already see the effects of Dean’s grace buried in the soil. The grass is greener, thicker, and lusher. When Castiel pushes his hands through the soil, it’s rich and full of nutrients. Dean joins him outside as Castiel lets the dirt slide between his fingers, admiring the way the thick, brown color looks against his skin.
Dean nods carefully. But before he can press further, Castiel changes the subject. Like he always does just when Dean is beginning to
“Did you know your Daddy isn’t actually in hell?” she asks. “I don’t remember if I told you that or not.” He freezes in front of the table, wordless and stiff as he waits for her to continue. He isn’t looking at her, but he can
gave that poor Lucifer a whole lifetime of anger issues and trauma. But no, he’s in heaven. Or, at least, that’s what I’ve heard, anyway. Kind of...funny how all that turns out, isn’t it?”
“Go make yourself useful and get the hell outside. I can’t stand hearing that out-of-tune piece of crap anymore than dad can.”
Pulling into the parking lot of the hospital building, Castiel flashes his fake FBI badge at the desk assistants (if there’s one thing Balthazar has always been good at, it’s forging fake IDs and other forms of false government identification) and hurries down the blank, white halls. He stops a woman as she’s hurrying in the opposite direction.
here and let the world burn. It wouldn’t be his world anymore and it wouldn’t be his problem. But Lucifer would still be out there, down in the real world. He would be hurting, led down a path of destruction and world-ending anger. Dean would no longer be Dean. And Castiel would be living a lie.
Something about the surly way that Robert says Castiel’s nickname irritates him, but he tries not to let it show.
Then, he remembers jerking off a virgin angel in the backseat of his own car before he disappeared into the night. Castiel blinks at the far wall, feeling a strange combination of pride and existential dread. Pulling himself out of bed, he hurries out of his room and downstairs, relieved when he sees Balthazar sitting in his recliner, still in his robe from the night before, reading the newspaper.
“There’s more than one way to get inside someone’s body, you know,” Castiel says absently, stunned by his own bravery. He’s too dazed to say anything else.
But they don’t have sex. Castiel wants to but his mind often has different plans. Not long gone are the days where he hated himself for desiring the kind of body, touch, and voice another man could bring him. And with Lucifer and Balthazar’s deaths still so present in the forefront of his mind, all of that pain seems to mingle together in an uneasy tangle of rattled nerves. He pulls at Dean’s shirt, and all he can see is his childhood home. He latches his mouth over Dean’s pulse and he sees the fire. He sees his father hunched over a table, muttering about homosexuals and their sicknesses when he listens to Dean moan with quiet want.
Dean raises his hand and stills. He keeps his fingers threaded through Castiel’s hair, giving it another painful tug.
Groaning against Dean’s mouth, Castiel grabs the back of Dean’s head, tugging at his hair to encourage him. He slides his tongue past Dean’s lips and licks slow, lazy circles around his mouth until they’re both whimpering with a hungry, feverish need. It takes some adjustment — even with lubricant and adequate preparation, it still hurts, just a little bit. But Castiel doesn’t mind the pain. It feels good, like something warm buried deep beneath his skin finally pushing to the surface. Higher and higher Castiel climbs, clinging to Dean’s body. Fingers find his hair, nails rake down his back. The bed creaks and rocks against the wall, thumping loud enough to be heard throughout the rest of the house. And finally,
“There’s a spell to banish the Witnesses,” Dean says quickly as he lowers his hand. He looks at Castiel. “You need to conduct it quickly. Or they’ll kill you.”
Jo shrinks back, her gaze holding Naomi's with wide, frightened eyes. She looks between her and Castiel as he struggles uselessly on the floor.
Castiel reaches back and punches her in the face. Her head jerks back, but as a trickle of blood begins running down her nose, she only laughs and cups his face with her hand.
He decided to take up a local hunt, hoping that more answers could come after he clears his head. Castiel drops his bag onto the floor and sits quietly at the edge of the bed. Absently, he runs his fingers over the faded, white sheets, sighing quietly in the silence digging heavily at his ears. Under normal circumstances, he would be sitting here with Lucifer. Lucifer wouldn’t talk much - but Castiel would catch him absently humming one of their father’s old church hymns under his breath, filling the silence with a familiar, if not a harsh, reminder of home. They’d talk about the hunt. Lucifer would get to researching as Castiel would ready their weapons and begin conducting any solo interviews he felt were effective to do alone.
“Over the years, my father married multiple women and they would sometimes take care of Lucifer and me. Or, they would try to. As Lucifer got older, he quickly decided that he wasn’t having any of it. He didn’t like the way they spoke down to him or the way that they seemed to be a replacement for our real mother. He would hit them, fight back when they tried to hit him. He drew blood. Over time, they refused to touch him or feed him and that job fell onto me. We were close for a little while as my father grew more and more...insane. He would spend hours writing and writing these strange stories, convinced that demons were living inside his head, whispering to him. Knowing what I know now about actual demons...I don’t think what he was hearing was real. But I’m not sure. I tried to make sense of his writing, but most of it was entirely illegible. Much like our mother, he grew more and more closed off, and some days we would not see him at all. My father would lock himself away in his study...wouldn’t eat...wouldn’t answer the door for days on end.”
for another person like this before. He feels warmth spread up through his body, through his fingertips, even up into his throat. Under Dean’s gentle, eager attention, Castiel unravels, his body trembling as soft noises spill past his lips.
“Cas’...” Dean breathes, quiet enough that their father wouldn’t be able to hear everything. “Just come back to my place. He’s a jerk. You weren’t doing anything, he’s just — “
He pushes past her, chewing on his bottom lip hard enough to break the skin. He slips back inside the cabin he assumes the other Castiel owns and shakes his head, feeling dazed. Is this what Jo wanted him to see? A world where he’s just some drug addict, keeping a camp alive while the world comes to an end?
telling me you have angels chasing you down for crimes against heaven, and now you want me to be your human shield?”
Dean sighs. “Yeah. But it’s complicated,” he says quickly. “Look, long story short, the angels are hell-bent on questioning me about it and we should probably get the hell out of here before they figure out you and Balthazar live here. You’re heaven’s favorite weapon. They won’t hurt me if I’m with you.”
“Father, it-it was an accident. I was watching him the whole time and I looked away for not even a minute. I’m sorry.”
She sighs as her eyes briefly flash a bright white - at once, Castiel feels it. Her grace - a jarring sense of her being inside him, fluttering around in the back of his head. It’s small, not enough to overwhelm him, but enough to let him
“He doesn't hate you,” Dean sighs. “He can be...a little much. But, man, you can’t just fight with him all the time. You know that’s gonna make it worse.”
Lucifer turns over more stones as their mother turns to hurry back into the house, her skirts stirring through the grass. He watches her go, aching to reach out to her - to call out her name and tell her how much he misses her; to tell her how sorry he is that he couldn’t protect her and how much he still misses her. How much he knows that she was hurting in this house, too.
Baffled, he freezes when he and Castiel meet each other’s eyes. Castiel, with so much to worry about, with so much hurt and pain in his life...worries about Dean? Suddenly, Dean feels terribly small.
“Castiel,” Dean says firmly. “Hellhounds don’t come for people on a whim. If you didn't make a deal, then somebody sent them for you. For a reason.”
Castiel stands without further prompting. He puts one, numb foot in front of the other as they walk back towards the car. Castiel has to drive because Dean doesn’t know how, and so he does. He drives and he doesn't say a single word. Neither does Dean. Both of them know that there is nothing left to say now that everything has gone according to a plan neither one of them wanted to acknowledge until it stared them right in the face.
That strikes Dean. He’s silent for a moment, trying not to gag on his food. Dean knows that word; queer. It's a whispered, deadly word. One shouted across school playgrounds and with rolled eyes when regarding the two men living together in a flat downtown. It's a sneer and a label; a word to avoid. Dean has to swallow his food with a thick gulp before he finds the words to respond.
Castiel drives the blade into the man’s chest. The man looks down without flinching. He sighs. Bored. He pulls the blade out of his chest, and then and there, Castiel’s frantic, unpleasant life flashes before his eyes. But the man doesn’t attack. He drops the blade to the floor.
“You should have done this long ago. Kill me, if you must. But do not forget that you started this, brother. I only wanted to be left alone.”
When they aren’t hunting, they’re trying to learn to cook. Castiel teaches Dean how to use a coffee machine, and it quickly becomes an obsession of Dean’s. Dean likes old television shows, too. Balthazar's Scooby-Doo VHS tapes are a particular favorite of his, and Castiel is fond of the way they make Dean laugh.
The music falters for a moment, before continuing to waft softly through the house. Dean listens intently, shivering at the way the song seems to be played with such care on such an old, dingy instrument. He's never heard anything like it - the care, the delicate way the notes rise and fall, as though using the piano's old, broken sound to enhance, rather than hinder, the gentle melody. He barely hears when Michael groans again, the older brother's expression darkening in irritation.
“Your bed is quite comfortable,” he remarks. But he doesn’t lay down. He sits on the edge, his eyes watching Dean curiously. Dean looks away and shrugs. He’s suddenly worried Castiel could read his mind and figure out that Dean had followed him last night.
When Castiel wakes up again, he’s laying in the motel bed in a damp sweat. Pushing himself upright, he wipes his eyes and looks around the empty room. The last thing he remembers is Jo touching his face and then everything going black.
“- is merely the way of heaven,” Castiel finishes for him. He bares his teeth. “I know that. But it’s a way that you seem more than willing to uphold, regardless of how
“She gave us the location and was even kind enough to translate the instructions for us. But during the translation, one of my men had a little bit too much fun with the angel and killed her. And the last trial that we needed was extracting the grace of an angel. We couldn’t extract it in time, and now I’m left with nothing but tightened defenses on Michael’s front and no means of finding another one of his angels less we open ourselves up to a massive, insurmountable attack.”
Briefly, he wonders if he should contact Dean. But how would he? It isn’t like angels have cell phones. And this is a hunt, Castiel realizes, that he can’t do alone.
By night time, Dean, Sam, and John Winchester manage to get the last of the wet boxes safely inside their new home. They’d begin unpacking in the morning. The small, ranch-style home is the pinnacle of the American Dream; or, at least, that’s what their father had told them. Three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a small dining area made the house a quaint, small place to live amongst the rows of houses that echoed it’s bland, American charm. White picket fences. A quiet street. A safe town (just as long as you didn’t go too far down Elk Street, where the houses began to crumble and the bars attracted all the wrong attention.)
Castiel twists around and kisses Dean full on the mouth. It’s a hard kiss. A hurtful one. Castiel has to manually remind himself to reign in his teeth, to not bite Dean’s lower lip and tug it into his mouth when it’s likely Dean has never even been
. The words are unspoken and clear as the sunny, autumn day. Dean turns up the album, grateful for the distraction, and even more grateful that Castiel doesn't seem to mind.
“You just shot an innocent man,” he rasps. The older Castiel gives him a low, knowing glare before looking around at the rest of the camp.
“I will say,” Alastair sighs lazily, “I was getting sick of Michael’s little human charade, too. Nearly all of heaven was planning on overthrowing him before he decided to cut out the abomination growing in his brain. Exactly why I lobbied to keep angels from spending too much time on earth. Samuel...Joanne...and now Michael. You, humans, make angels
“Heaven is in chaos,” she gasps. “A whole battalion of angels is just...is gone. I was able to escape when the angels started going haywire upstairs. Did Samuel…?”
The empty warehouse is dark and eerily quiet, and only about a half-hour’s drive from the motel where Castiel had parked. Once inside, Dean and Castiel’s footsteps echo on the solid ground, the facility looming with eerie darkness that makes Castiel shiver, even clothed in his blue jacket. In an adjacent room, a storage unit with labeled boxes of tapestry shoved to the side reveals a white devil’s trap drawn across the floor. Contained within, bound like Christ to the cross, Naomi is in the same gray suit she’d been wearing at the church, her hair pulled from its bun to hang in loose strands around her face. She smiles when she sees Castiel, the bright seething grin revealing, white rows of her vessel’s teeth.
Dean shrugs as he quickly pulls on a pair of faded jeans and a black t-shirt. He nabs his jacket, pushing his fingers through his hair with a quick glance in the mirror."
Clearing his throat, Dean takes a step closer to the bed. “We’re here about the witch, actually,” Dean says shortly. “The one you’ve been tracking. You find anything on it yet?”
“It’s hard to hear,” Jack says, eyes shifting around the kitchen guiltily. “People are praying all the time.”
At the sensation of Cas’ fingers sliding over the skin behind his balls, Dean made a frantic sound he definitely wouldn’t have been proud of in any other situation. They were slick with something - spit, maybe soap; Dean honestly didn’t care. All he cared about was the way they didn’t tease, didn’t hesitate, just pushed inside him, almost like they could reach for that burning rock of need in his gut. They twisted inside him - not rough, but merciless; like Cas knew that Dean wouldn’t have the patience for anything else. When they pulled back, Dean groaned and pressed his forehead to the tile. Cas’ mouth pressed against the base of Dean’s neck, agonizingly soft, like an apology; and then the head of Cas’ cock pushed - blunt and hot - against him.
“I have yet to see any evidence of that. He glances down at Lilly, clutching his pant leg. “Whatddya say, squirt?”
Dean thinks of all the times they stood like this, face-to-face, breathing each other’s air, and never reached across the gap. “Go ahead,’ he says, and Cas slides the flannel off Dean’s shoulders. It doesn’t go easily, catching and dragging across Dean’s bare forearms and over the backs of his hands before tumbling to the dingy carpet with a soft
Dean shakes his head. “Nothing. Nothing, dude. Just - “ he makes half a motion to reach for Cas, but drops his arms before they get even halfway up, making it a shrug instead. “I thought you were gonna -”
“Cas.” It was definitely, embarrassingly, a sob, this time.  Dean reached back, touched what he was sure was Cas’ bare thigh, fumbled and found his wrist, pulling Cas’ hand towards his crotch.
Castiel rolls his eyes, a little charmed, despite himself - which, really, is how it has always felt to love Dean - despite everything, he will. He
At first, there’s only static. Sam and the others come piling back into the room. Immediately, Sam rushes to get his setup reassembled, Eileen passing him pieces that have shot away across the carpet. Jack dives in, so close to Dean that he bumps against him like an over-excited puppy. Finally a voice breaks through all the racket, and all at once it’s like there’s nobody else in the room.
A fat, dark drop of spatters the coffee table. Dean looks down at it, confused. “I - uh -” He reaches up to wipe his face, and his hand comes away bloody, the front of his shirt is soaked.
Cas hums, “I’ve recently discovered that subtlety is extremely unlikely to get me anywhere. It’s better to be…forthcoming about my desires.”
She glances between them, thoughtfully, then shrugs. “Good or bad, there’s only the one. The Sunset - just keep heading up the street from here. Can’t miss it.”
Dean continues, undaunted, “And the last time we tried to talk to Cas like that, one of us ended up without eyeballs.”
“I don’t know.” Though it certainly seems like it could at any moment. The clouds look heavy, darkening on the western horizon, and the air has a metallic sharpness that bites at exposed skin.
“Yes,” Cas rasps, and the gravel sound of his voice goes straight to the pit of Dean’s stomach. “Lie back.”
“It’s fine,” Dean says, a little breathless, feeling giddy as he watches Cas reach for his belt. Wet denim doesn’t like to go anywhere at the best of times. It drags and bunches, heavy and immobile, resisting every step of the way; but Cas works at it pathently, crouches down to get the jeans all the way off of Dean’s legs, and takes care of Dean’s socks while he’s down there. Dean stares at the back of Cas’ neck, hyper-aware of how obvious the bulge in the front of his own shorts is. It’s unmistakable what his body wants, even if his brain can’t quite articulate the thought yet.
Dean shrugs. What’s he supposed to say, that he misses the kid? Sam must know that he does. “I know he’s out there ‘finding himself’ and all - getting the hang of being G-O-D - but would it kill him to stop by for a Sunday dinner once and awhile?”
Dean exhales into their joined hands again. “Yeah, well I wasn’t planning to stand around outside this long either.” His thumb skates over the bandage, delicate. “How’s the hand?”
“Maybe it doesn’t.” Dean bites the inside of his cheek, drags the heel of his boot against the dry earth under the bench. “I mean - maybe Chuck destroyed it once he pulled Lucifer out. Just like he destroyed all those other worlds. That’s not your fault.”
“Right, so -” he gestures at the couch, and Dean sits. The spread before him looks like the world’s worst swap meet table. “You activate the spell by completing the sigil using the powder in the dish there. Basically, whoever completes the sigil becomes a medium for the duration of the spell.”
“Okay,” Sam says, finally, slowly, motioning Dean towards the couch. Dean looks over at it like it’s going to jump up and grab him. “Are you
“Come to bed, Dean.”  Cas takes his hand, though he doesn’t need to, helps boost him to his feet. Dean feels loose-limbed, warm, slides his arms around Cas, presses his nose not the soft part of Cas’ neck, where he smells sweet and familiar - a little bit of burnt ozone, something metallic, the sandalwood soap from the bathroom.
“S’alright,” Dean says. His throat feels raw, and he wonders how much noise they made, suddenly glad that Claire and Kaia are two doors down, instead of right on the other side of the wall. “I kinda figured it might turn out like that, once we got going.”
Cas’ teeth graze the tender spot where Dean’s neck meets his shoulder, and Dean’s body responds with a full, helpless shiver. “You did.”
Which is how Cas ends up in the guest bedroom, and Dean ends up on the sofa, and Jack goes - wherever Jack goes, because he doesn’t even pretend to sleep anymore. And Dean’s exhausted, but he can’t sleep. He lies awake, listening to the ticking of the kitchen clock and the settling of the house, until he can’t take it anymore and goes upstairs.
The punkish girl behind the gas station counter doesn’t seem to register the question at first, drowsily gazing out the window to where Cas has been left in charge of gassing up the car. She drags her attention to Dean, blinks twice, then laughs.
Cas without his clothes on is - well, he’s a lot. Hell, even with his clothes on, he’s at least two-thirds of all the guilty fantasies that Dean’s ever had in his life. Suddenly, it feels like the room doesn’t have nearly enough oxygen in it. Dean’s head spins. The backs of his knees hit the edge of the bed before he realises he’s stepped backwards, and he sits down so fast that a surprised bark of laughter escapes his throat. Cas hesitates for a second, then grins - huge and glorious - and bears down on Dean like a hurricane.
He can tell Cas is close to sleeping in just a couple of minutes by how slow and even his breathing is. Dean knows he should leave well enough alone, but he’s resolved to be smarter this time, to not let too many things go unsaid.
He scanned the clusters of guests, spotted Sam and Eileen at a table filled with hunters, both red-faced with laughter; Garth, stretched between two folding chairs, soundly asleep; Jack, with Jody’s girls, engaged in a very serious card game that also seemed to involve a large bottle of whiskey. Cas left the cover of the canopy, and began a slow descent of the hill in the blue-dark. The night was warm and the distant sound of music and laughter made everything dreamy and strange.
The first thing they do is buy Cas a full wardrobe. According to Jack, he burned out his grace just to reach their side of the veil. Whether or not it will eventually come back on its own is anyone’s guess, but in the meantime, Cas needs clean underwear and socks - pants that aren’t Dean’s.
“Come see my rock collection, okay?” It’s not really a question at all. She’s giving Dean the same, classic puppy eyes he used to get from Sam; but this time there’s that tiny, stubborn chin tilt she gets from her mom.
Lilly laughs, “No - not like that - bigger!” she insists, providing a second demonstration. Castiel takes a long breath - as much of the sharp, cold air as his lungs can hold - before exhaling in a great gust, with something more like an exaggerated sigh than an actual roar, creating a thick, bright cloud.
“Hey,” he says, and Cas smiles at him, huge and watery and uncertain. Dean wants to kiss him again, but he has to say it first. “I love you, you know.  You can have that. I want you to have it.”
After a while, he heard Dean approach behind him - familiar footsteps, a huff of breath. An arm slipped around Cas’ waist, and Dean leaned into his shoulder.
Though he’s used to Dean’s casual self-deprecation, it still manages to break his heart. “It’s not nearly as difficult as you seem to think. Or even as difficult as you want it to be.”
“Why? Did I forget to shave again?” He rubs his cheek against hers, and she squeals, helpless, squirming until he plants her on the floor again, and she immediately takes his hand, pulling him towards the living room before his boots are even off.
“Nah it’s fine - actually, I was feeling a little roasted after all that time on the beach yesterday.” He’s not used to so much sunlight, is the thing; and unlike Sam and Cas, he turns red, rather than pleasantly brown. It was sort of nice to go back to bed after lunch, sleep off the hottest part of the day.
“I didn’t mean to go quite that far all at once,” Cas says. He rolls away, slightly, and Dean puts a hand on his hip to stop him.
Dean pounded solidly on the closed door, shouting, “Sammy - you decent?” but stepping inside without actually waiting for an answer. Sam was mostly dressed; he and Eileen had opted for a basically casual dress code, playing to their audience, so Sam wore his nicest pair of jeans and polished his boots to go along with his dress shirt, his currently unknotted tie, and his unbuttoned vest.  He stood in front of the full-length mirror he’d pulled from one of the bunker’s supply rooms, rehearsing his wedding vows with shaky hands.
Dean glances at his phone, sitting out on the table. It still works, but now the screen is cracked. There’s a fifty-fifty shot, Dean figures, whether that was caused by the magic, or by his grip. No missed calls, so Cas hasn’t tried to get in touch with him again.
He could, but it wasn’t the easiest thing that Dean had ever done. It was pretty obvious that there was basically zero blood making its way to his brain, right at that moment. The room swayed, the walls seemed to throb. When he stumbled in the hallway, Cas reached out to steady him on instinct, and the brush of his fingertips against Dean’s arm was enough to make Dean’s breath catch.
Sam makes a constipated face somewhere between offended and openly horrified. “Maybe someone else should stay in the room with you.”
He hadn’t decided on anything - hadn’t even broached the subject with Cas yet - but he’d been browsing, casually, listings in Lebanon and the surrounding area, just getting a feel for what was out there. He was even starting to warm up to the idea; he just wasn’t sure quite how to tell Sam, yet.
in front of a child - then the back door creaks open, the sound louder than it should be against the immobile cold.
He had spent all night pouring over the lore books that Sam had lifted from the bunker and stored in his basement - just a few of The Men of Letters’ greatest hits - and wishing the phone would just ring, so he could prove to Sam he wasn’t going nuts. Now, the books are piled in the corner of the living room, and Dean’s phone is on the charger, but it hasn’t rung at all.
He hated it, the way something inside him still hesitated around Cas. It never happened when they were alone - though the first time he and Cas had tried to do anything under their clothes, Dean hadn’t been able to keep his head in the game and they’d had to hit the brakes - but out in the open, it was different; Dean couldn’t help but wait to see if the other shoe would drop, if someone would say
Deans gaze shifts away - ashamed? Anxious? - it seems to take him a very long time to uncurl his fingers from around Castiel’s hands. “I was a dick, alright? I know - I just…”
“That’s alright.” As he drew closer, Dean reached out and took him by the arm, reeled him in until they were face-to-face and knee-to-knee. Drowsy warmth radiated from him, and he smelled sweet and wild, like cut grass and beer and cake frosting. “It is - a lot, isn’t it?”
One of many framed photos on the wall behind the couch is the one taken years ago, back in the days when they thought they’d only face one apocalypse in their lifetime. He and Sam look ridiculously young. Everyone else in the photo is gone. Dean taps his finger on the glass. “He’s this guy. The one in the goofy trench coat.”
He slips a cold hand up the back of Dean’s shirt, elated by his quiet shiver and the way he presses deeper into Castiel’s mouth, as if that alone could chase away the cold - until Sam interrupts.
They get under the covers, first lying each on their own narrow strip of bed; then Cas turns towards him, hesitates, and Dean grabs his wrist, pulling Cas’ arm across his chest.
They’ve been stumbling their way towards this, Dean knows, since Cas came back; since Dean’s relief and joy, hurt and frustration had finally churned up the earth between them and he’d let himself speak:
“Uncle Dean!” Lilly slams into his legs like a bulldozer, almost knocking Dean on his ass. He drops his bag, gets his legs properly underneath him, and boosts her up into the sky, ignoring the twinge in his shoulder in favour of hearing her laugh before he pulls her in, and plants a smacking kiss on her rosy cheek.
Cas lays his book across his chest. “Of course.” He says it with such easy confidence that - if Dean wasn’t sitting down - he might have felt a little light-headed. “Where are we going?”
heard you. We’re gonna find you, wherever you are; you just gotta give us a sign. Anything at all, anything you can do so we know you’re there.”
The house is sun-brightened, clean, and right now it smells like the best home cooking Dean has ever eaten. There are pictures on the walls, soft, blue cushions on the couch, and Sam’s freaking clown shoes by the front door. It looks like any other house in the neighbourhood, where the most exciting thing that ever happens is a battle over lemon squares, post-PTA meeting. But Dean knows there are hex bags tucked above the door frames, and old Enocian protection sigils etched meticulously into the windowsills. It’s a hunter’s house, under the hazy illusion of suburban perfection.
“Yes,” Cas says, lips soft against the side of Dean’s neck, his fingers trailing farther and farther down Dean’s spine to the waistband of his shorts. “But we have time.”
“Hey - you feel like going on a trip with me for a couple days?” he asks, trying to pitch it casually, without looking away from the T.V.
“Any kind of ceremony or ritual we might perform would be purely symbolic,” Cas offered, tapping the pads of his fingers against the back of one of Dean’s hands, tracing the edges of his knuckles. “No human vow could match the act of lifting your soul from the blackest pits of hell. I knit your body together with tendrils of my own grace.”
“I’m also not the groom.” Sam paled, cheeks fading to the colour of a dirty dish rag.  Dean thumped him on the chest. “Hey - you got this man. You haven’t managed to scare her off yet, so you’re set.”
“Absolutely.” It’s practically as easy as breathing. Dean’s been doing it since he was at least six years old. “You have a kid.”
Cas’ fingers keep trailing, circling on Dean’s exposed skin. It’s nice, the way Cas touches him now, every time Dean is within arm’s reach.
“Don’t mess around with it, alright. What if he’s trying to call right now?” The phone stays silent. Dean picks up his cereal bowl and dumps it in the sink. “He’ll call again.”
“I’ll show you funny,” Dean counters, and digs his fingers into Cas’ ribs until he squirms and gasps with laughter.
“I know,” Cas answered, pulling Dean closer, canting his hips at an angle that made Dean whine breathlessly. “I know Dean, I’m here. I’m here.”
Dean spreads his whole hand, flat, against the small of Cas’ back, and Cas rocks forward; Dean can feel how excited he’s getting, with only thin cotton sweats between them. Then a floorboard creaks above their heads, and Dean flinches. Cas makes a  soft, frustrated noise and knocks his forehead against Dean’s collarbone, fingers tightening against Dean’s hips. Against his better judgement, Dean chuckles - his skin still tingling, his heart beating too fast.
“It makes sense,” Eileen nods, flipping through one of the massive books. Dean’s not even sure what language it’s written in.  Urdu? When did she learn to read Urdu? “Maybe that’s why Jack couldn’t find him. A place between two planes of existence might be out of God’s reach.”
Dean lets him have a minute, rubbing one hand soothingly up and down the length of Cas’ back; then he gets his other hand between them, around Cas’ own hand, and guides him back to full, solid strokes, helping him get the pressure just right, the little twist that Dean likes for himself. Cas gets back into the game quick enough, pushes himself up just enough that he can look down and watch their hands working together. Dean closes his eyes and lets the warm, almost-ache of it wash over him in waves, focusing on the way it feels to have Cas on top of him, heavy and warm, smelling of rain and a little bit of gunpowder, until Cas says his name, low and almost reverent.
Sam and Eileen exchange another look, a few signs. “I’ll get the books,” Eileen says at last. “You make some coffee.”
It’s so much bigger than that, but it’s also not something you explain to a kid. Dean didn’t even explain it to Sam until last year, here in this same living room. He’d kept the secret of what happened in the bunker for as long as he could, carrying it like a tumour in his chest, until he almost couldn’t breathe around it; finally let the whole story out on one particularly bad night, when he’d had just enough beer to loosen his tongue.
Dean grabbed the door, but the knob twisted uselessly in his hand. He pulled, but it wouldn’t give way. Sam had locked him in somehow.
Dean had already lost the thread of the conversation, if he was honest. He felt himself sliding his feet a little further apart on the tile, rocking minutely back against Cas. “I thought about it too. Fuck, Cas. I thought about it a lot.”
Dean surveyed the clearing once, a last look-over that betrayed his own nervousness. Cas knew that he hadn’t slept well at all the last few days, wrapped up in the idea that he had to make everything perfect. Finally, Dean leveled a warning finger at Jack. “No mojo, got it? Do it the old fashioned way.”
Then the housekeeping cart rattles by, and Dean figures it’s time to get up. He’s got a lot of miles to cover yet if he doesn’t want to be late.
Dean knows that he should pick it up,drape it over one of the small chairs in the kitchenette to dry, but he leaves it there, waiting.
He slides his hands down Cas’ arms, dragging his coat free, tosses it with his own over the nearest chair. Cas has taken a liking to long-sleeved tees, anything soft cotton, with long cuffs that almost manage to hide his hands. Dean pushes the cuff back on one side, strokes the soft skin inside his wrist.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Dean says, flatly.  As much as he wants to talk to Cas - he’d give a fucking arm for it, at this point - there’s a certain sticking point. “First of all, none of us is a medium - “
The rain got louder. A ripple of gentle laughter went up from the crowd in the chairs behind them. Suddenly, Dean’s eyes shone wetly too, and he rubbed his face quickly on his sleeve. Cas reached over and pressed his palm to the small of Dean’s back, which seemed to make the whole thing both better and worse. He could feel Dean trembling, faintly, beneath the pressure of his hand.
The TV is on - no volume, just subtitles, which means Eileen ws probably watching before she took Lilly upstairs to get ready for bed - and Dean watches the goofy sitcom that’s still playing with a half-hearted interest, slipping a hand just inside Cas’ pant leg to rub at his ankle.
Dean tried to argue, but the wind was knocked out of him. Instead, he propped himself roughly against the side of the bed with his eyes crushed shut, and tried to level out his breathing.
Dean realizes he’s been staring a little too long, and pries his sticky tongue off the roof of his mouth. “What’re you waiting for, Cas?”
There’s a bright, cheerful ding, and Anya grins at him. “I bet,” she says, passing him the card reader. While Dean’s typing in his pin, she says, “Ya know - you go about an hour north on the 44, there’s Whitby Pumpkin Farm. They’ve got this Haunted Halloween Maze thing - it’s kiddie crap, but I took my girlfriend there last weekend, and I definitely got laid after.” She winks.
Jack picks up the phone, turns it over in his hands. “I still can’t find him. I tried before I came here.” He swipes his finger across the screen, but Dean gets up and snatches it from his hand.
“Dean,” Cas’ fingertips tickled the back of his neck. Dean opened his eyes. Cas’ was watching him, carefully, his eyes startlingly blue, like that morning’s sky. Like grace. “Are you alright?”
“All that?” Cas interjects, his voice going sharp around the edges, and Dean feels a familiar cold bolt of dread. It’s always like this with them - with
The hunts help fill up the empty spaces, even if it isn’t what he wants. Any chance for something else...well, that wasn’t in the cards anymore.
It’s like any other motel room that Dean has stayed in hundreds of times, except for the bed, which seems massive. Cas sets his bag on the dinette table. Dean sets his by the door. He’s got lube in there, he thinks suddenly, condoms; things he bought specifically so he could have sex with Cas. Dean shivers, and leans down to fiddle with the heater by the window - trying to get the place a little warm, twisting the knobs until it blasts him in the face with stale air. He shrugs off his coat, turns around, and Cas is standing by the foot of the bed with his own coat hooked around his elbows, perfectly still, eyes wide, cheeks dark with colour.
touching. They’ve kissed before - that was one of Cas’ most recent requests, in the dark of the bunker kitchen, just before dawn.
“Dean.” He could feel the air shift; could tell just by the way the sound in the room changed how close Cas was to him. Fuck, he could even
Dean blushes deep red, shifting awkwardly on his feet and tugs his jacket up. “He done out there yet?”
, Dean. You’re both family, you can stay as long as you want.” he pauses, ominous, and then, because he’s completely an asshole and Dean obviously raised him wrong, he adds, “As long as you change the sheets.”
like that.” He pauses for a moment, looks away. “You know - Sam told me you were still hunting, before I came back. If you wanted to go back to that, I hope you don’t think I would stand in the way. And I may be without my powers for the foreseeable future, but I have significant combat experience - and anything I don’t know, I’m sure I could learn -”
“Been doing it for thirty-eight years!” Dean called over his shoulder, as he began his hike down the hillside.
“Seriously though, Dean - don’t feel like you guys have to go anywhere. If you need some time alone with Cas, you can ask.”
“Cas. You can.  It’s fine.” Dean pauses, licks his lips, and thinks to himself that this is their problem, after all - they can never say the right damned thing. “I want you to.”
Dean buried his face in the towel again. “Uh - okay. Yeah. Took the edge off.” Not all the way off, but he definitely felt better; back somewhere close to where he’d been five or six hours ago, when the curse first hit him and he thought he could handle it himself.
His heart is beating so hard it feels like his ribs are going to shatter, his skin buzzes from the adrenaline high. His hands slip against the phone casing, damp with panicked sweat as he pulls up his contacts list. It doesn’t ring, just goes straight to that familiar voice:
“I’m glad to have been wrong,” Cas offered, with half a smile. He tried not to well too much or too often on the actions of his past (it was a very, very long past, after all) but he sometimes wished he could offer that past version of himself, the one that had surrendered to a tiny fraction of what he thought happiness could be, some of what he felt now - quiet, warm, increasingly familiar and comfortable - which wasn’t like that old happiness at all.
. It has never been easy, but it has always been worth it.  “I know both of those things. And I forgive you. But don’t assume I’m incapable of something just because I have to learn.”
Dean buries his face in the pillow, and tries to sleep. The ambient noise of the house pushes through, every time he gets close to the edge of unconsciousness - pipes clicking, Sam snoring in the next room, the soft buzz of the alarm clock on the bedside table eating up electricity, the occasional creak of the house, settling on its foundations. Finally, he gives up, grabbing his phone of the charger, figuring he could scan through the news, or play a few rounds of Candy Crush to settle his brain; instead, he ends up with the phone in his hand, staring at the lit-up screen, thoughtlessly tapping through apps, knowing where he’s going to end up, but pretending it isn’t going to happen.
Cas stands, and just for a second Dean thinks he’s going to stop there, or maybe offer Dean an out; and he opens his mouth to say he doesn’t want one -
It’s not even really dirty talk - it’s a genuine question; but Cas’ voice sounds like he’s swallowed glass, and that alone is almost enough to make Dean come apart at seams.
“I missed you, Cas.” The other words he wants to say are right there, trapped somewhere under his tongue.
“Just the canopy,” Cas relented, returning the mallet to Dean’s discarded toolbox. It was difficult to resist Jack’s earnest smile - and anyway, the use of
Dean pulls back to say something and there are snowflakes - everywhere - the size of quarters, tumbling around them, their delicate lace patterns on full display against the grey-gold of Dean’s hair, caught on his shoulders, melting against the bare skin of his arms.
“I know a few spells,” Sam argues. “Stuff from Rowena’s books. We shouldn't need a medium. I’d just need some things from the bunker - and Jack can do that, right Jack?”
“I said I didn’t know -” Sam looks up and his mouth drops open, his eyes wide and horrified. “Oh my god, Dean.”
He and Dean have been back at the house for three days; no one has actually discussed what they might do next. Dean is typically prickly, when it comes to discussions of the future. “I don’t know,” Castiel says, finally. “Your parents might want their guest room back.”
“No,” she mumbles into his shirt, while Dean’s hand rubs little circles on her back. “Daddy said you didn’t feel good. And you were sad. Because you miss your friend.”
“Yes. Caring for the world is a difficult job.” Too difficult, Castiel often worries. So far, Jack seems to be coping well with the responsibilities of divinity; but he is so young (almost laughably so) and the work - as Castiel knows from experience - can be terribly lonely. They’ve discussed more than once whether there might be a way to set the universe on some kind of track, which would require very little intervention for decades or even centuries, and might allow Jack to return to Earth, at least temporarily. He doesn’t want Jack to forget what it means to live, or how to love the simpler aspects of humanity.
Dean winds his fingers into the overlong hair at the base of Cas’ neck, where it’s starting to get a little too long and slightly wavy because he’s as bad as Sam for letting Dean near him with a pair of clippers. “We got time, right?”
Cas is mostly under the blankets, his ridiculous bed head poking out like some kind of over-enthusiastic brush plant. “I do, a little,” he mumbles, his arm still tight across Dean’s chest, his breath warm against Dean’s shoulder.
“You know I didn’t mean it,” Dean prods, gently, emboldened now. “Or you know I shouldn’t have said it?”
“I heard your voice,” Cas says, quiet. Dean would be embarrassed about how it sounds, except he just wants to keep hearing Cas’ voice. He never wants to stop hearing it. He wishes his heart would stop pounding so damned hard so he could hear it better. “But I can’t see - I don’t know where I am.”
“Should make you buy me dinner first,” he says, going for the drawstring on Cas’ shorts. They’ve got ridiculous cartoon sharks all over them because Jack picked them out, and Dean shouldn’t be so charmed by them, but he is.
“Looks like you already did it,” she says, pointing to Dean’s neck, where his collar has slipped, exposing the truly massive hickey that Cas left behind last night, and refreshed in the morning while he had two fingers deep inside him.
Every night, they have dinner - six of them crowded around the table, elbows bumping, and go to bed hoarse with laughter.
Maybe it was. And he’d tried it, like he and Sam promised they would. They’d dialed back the hunts. Sam had started night school. It had been pretty good for a while, but Dean was never really cut out for any of it. “I’m good at this, Sam. I’ve always been good at this. At least this way I can do something.”
“They jumped off their world just as it was being destroyed, and they got stuck somewhere - They didn’t get erased.”
The touch was immediately almost blindingly good, even as it felt like being kicked in the solar plexus. Dean was coming before he was even sure
“Can I kiss you?” Dean asks, now - as if he and Cas have ever been some kind of Hallmark Channel bullshit; dizzy from the way his heart leaps when Cas says, “Yes.”
The chairs and tables were a much longer affair, though Claire and Kaia proved capable assistants, even when Jody appeared halfway through the effort and enlisted Kaia to help decorate the display behind the head table. When they had trouble getting the flowers to stay in the standing trellis, Jack was only too happy to provide his help as well - coaxing the flowers to sprout long spirals of vibrant green vines with a judicious application of grace.
“Like hell! You’re just jealous of my moves!” He gave Cas another spin, and laughed at the way Claire rolled her eyes, trying to hide her smile.
“Can I get you boys anything else?” The waitress asks, slipping past their table once last time with the coffee pot in her hand.
“Hey - c’mere a minute,” Dean murmured, voice low and gentle, guiding Cas in until he could bump his nose against Cas’s cheek, breath soft against his jaw. “You
He can feel Cas’ hard-on bump and slide along the crease between his hip and groin, and he arches up so that his own dick rubs against Cas’ belly. Cas muffles a gasp against Dean’s shoulder, so Dean does it again, until Cas is panting - short, desperate breaths. He drags his mouth along Dean’s jaw, sucks on Dean’s lower lip. His hands trace over Dean’s body like he’s learning braille, like he doesn’t already know Dean down to his atoms. He drags the flat of his palm along the length of Dean’s cock where it lies, heavy, against his belly, and Dean groans, helplessly.
If he still had his wings, Castiel thinks, he might have left last night, rather than fight with Dean. Rather than simply retreat to bed, to wake much later with Dean sleeping on the farthest edge of the bed beside him, as if he didn’t dare touch him, even passively.
“I - I don’t know. It’s dark.” There’s a low, persistent hiss on the line, and Cas’ voice rises, falls, with the half-broken connection. There’s a fierce, distinct bolt of pain behind Dean’s left eye that he ignores.
If it was a little darker, if the beach was a little more private, Dean might have been convinced to just lean into the rail a little bit, slide his feet a little farther apart and just let Cas have whatever he wants. He’s gotten good at that. But he’s a bit old to be getting a public lewdness citation, so he lets Cas steer him off the balcony and into the bedroom, getting handsier as they go. Cas gets his whole hand down the back of Dean’s shorts, giving a quick squeeze; and Dean laughs, stupidly delighted, feeling drunk on how much he likes Cas’ hands all over him.
Cas was crouched on the floor - close, but not too close. Not as close as it felt like he was. Not as close as Dean wanted him to be. He looked worried. Almost genuinely afraid.
“Neither do I,” Cas reminded him, gently slipping from his arms, taking a grip on his arm, pulling him towards the dance floor before Dean could think better of it. “I’m sure we can figure it out.”
But he couldn’t. Not until Cas’ palm settled heavily between his shoulder blades, pushed up to the back of his neck, then dragged back down, slowly, again and again. It felt painfully good; enough to make Dean shake like he was still freezing, even though the water  was starting to steam.
Water splashed Dean’s face, trickled into his open mouth, sluiced down his back. The world narrowed to sensations, without room for thought: water droplets striking his overheated skin, Cas’ fingers digging pin-point bruises into his hip, Cas’ lips on his shoulder, Cas moving inside him. Cas, Cas, Cas…
Dean’s heart skips two full beats. He has to stop and catch his breath, and Cas is left to finish undressing himself, but he doesn’t seem to mind.
He’s going to do more than fool around with Cas; he’s going into this with his whole heart, not just to scratch an itch (though - who’s he kidding - the itch is definitely there) and it kind of scares the shit out of him. Not that he’ll admit it out loud.
“Don’t do that,” Dean says, immediately, feeling his guts twist around his home-cooked meal, for real this time. “Don’t bring her into it like that.”
- the ones he’s started wearing since he decided he wanted to make a go of a real life on Earth, and Dean insisted he needed more than one pair of socks and underwear to go along with his new life. Without the trench coat constantly hanging off of him like a brown paper bag, it’s so much more obvious how broad his shoulders are compared to his waist, how much strength there is in his arms. Dean thinks about it a lot.
“Cas.” A massive smile had broken out on Dean’s face. “Don’t worry about it. I’ve got my dad’s car.”
“No, nothing, I was just, uh, wondering. About something. Don’t worry. It doesn’t matter,” Cas said hastily, cursing themself for almost asking yet another intrusive question. They shot a look back at Dean’s face. He just seemed amused.
Dean’s eyes widened. “Oh, wow. That’s awesome,” he said. “They were really good. Like, professional good.”
And Hester was already off with Amenadiel, of course, and third wheeling them might even be worse than going home, so that was out of the picture. So they stood at the bottom of the staircase, staring at the doors and wishing desperately they had an excuse to anywhere to go but home.
All other eyes were on the clock above the classroom door. For all his annoyance, Castiel could have sworn he’d seen their teacher flash surreptitious glances over at the clock as well. Understandable - it was one of the last warm days in fall and everyone was itching to make the most of it. Except Cas wasn’t. Cas would have preferred to sit in class for another hour and think about his essay on Rosalind. Or practice trigonometric properties. Or run three miles in gym. Anything to avoid going home early.
“Oh, no, Ms. Rosman, you’re doing me the favor. Really.” Dean smiled, and Ms. Rosman beamed back. Cas caught a breath. Dean’s eyes were brilliantly green, bright even under the harsh hallway lights. Cas realized they were staring and quickly averted their eyes.
Ms. Rosman’s expression fell. “Oh, Cas… I’m sorry, not today. Tobias hasn’t…” she paused, sighing. “Well, he hasn’t been doing his litter box duties recently, and so I finally decided I have to take him to the vet. And you know how he feels about the cat carrier, so. That’s going to be quite the process.”
“No, of course not, don’t apologize.” She pulled back and held his arms at the elbows, looking into his face. “Of course you show up now. I was just telling Dean all about how much you love Tobias…”
“Okay, we gotta go like, five minutes ago though,” Dean said, and grabbed Cas’s shoulder to tug them along. The swarm of butterflies in Cas’s stomach burst into flight again at his touch, but he managed to stay on his feet and run after Dean. Somehow.
“You okay, Castiel?” Mr. Hennessy asked, breaking their train of thought. He shut off the SmartBoard and turned to face Cas, who forced a smile onto their face.
She sighed. “I’m glad you like it,” she said. “But really, I don’t need to see you every other day.”
“Normally it would be. But I’m sorry to say I have an appointment I really can’t miss in an hour, so I’ll need you to just be careful not to get trampled,” he said with a dismissive wave. But he looked back, and he must have seen the sag in Cas’s shoulders because his eyes softened. “But plenty of teachers stay late at school every day. I’m sure you can find an open classroom.”
Cas beamed. “No, not at all, Dean. I think that’s the nicest thing anybody’s ever said about my writing. I’ll get you copies for sure if you want them!”
“You’d love her, she’s awesome. Huge nerd. Best friend I could ask for,” Dean said fondly. He paused, then turned to Cas suddenly, as though realizing something. “Hey, would you want to maybe come with? I don’t know if you’ve got anything going on later today, but what you said to Ms. Rosman… it sounded like you needed someplace to go, so I don’t know. You could hang out with us.”
Cas glanced uncomfortably over at the other boy – Dean -- who seemed to be struggling to hide a grin. He cleared his throat. “Yes, yes, Tobias, I was just going to ask about him actually,” he said.
“Yeah, alright,” Cas said, stifling a swell of disappointment. “I’ll look around.” He slung his backpack over his shoulder and slunk out of the classroom. “Thanks anyways.”
“Yeah!” Dean responded brightly. “Well. Sometimes. I’m not really a club person,” he laughed, kicking at the ground, “but I go when I remember.”
“Work? You have work right now?” Cas asked. “It isn’t even one, how would you have work at this time on a school day?”
“Yeah, of course,” he snapped his fingers, his face breaking into a wide smile, “I got it, I got it – you read a couple poems at that GSA meeting a few weeks back! Didn’t you write one of them or something?”
about it,” Mr. Hennessy said peevishly, turning from the SmartBoard to glare at his class. “I promise you won’t be well prepared for next week’s in-class essay if you don’t.”
Sam held his brother, feeling smaller than he ever knew possible. He wanted to find the words, but he knew they didn’t exist. He wanted a spell, a miracle, something to save both the brothers he was watching fade away, just like the setting sun beyond the window. Pulling himself just an inch away from where he had fallen to the ground with Dean, Sam focused on the work the staff around the room were setting out to accomplish. They were nearly done now, stepping quickly and efficiently, silent as they gave nature it’s chance. Their final act was to remove the breathing tube from Cas’s throat, letting him take in his last tastes of the air around them.
Cas ran his hands down Dean’s arms, gripping the muscles he felt there. He had always appreciated the beauty of Dean Winchester, but had never realized what he felt for the man. He felt as if he had found the missing piece and now he wanted nothing more than to never let go. But he knew this would end eventually, so he resolved the make the most of what time he had here in the rundown hotel they were in. When Dean flashed a questioning look into his eyes, Cas nodded desperately, whispering just the quietest whimper of “Please.”
“Really, Dean?” Sam couldn’t have put more sarcasm into those two words if he had tried. “Don’t act like you don’t know. It’s one thing when we’re on the road and you bring a waitress, bartender, or whatever back to the hotel; we share a room and all, so I deal with it. But come on!” Sam rolled his eyes so hard Dean seriously wondered if they would pop right out of his skull. “We don’t even share a wall and I was stuck up all night listening to you moan. Dude, it’s not right.” Sam glared before looking back down at his paper, luckily giving Dean time to try to come up with some way to hide the blush that had spread so quickly that Dean swore his ears were on fire.
Sam watched as Dean finally lost it altogether and laid his head against Cas’s chest. Sam watched as his brother’s shoulders shook, and he wanted nothing more than to find a way out of this. He wanted to save everyone from the inevitable. But he knew they were all lost, just waiting out the few minutes they had left.
“I love him.” It was simple and to the point, and yet Dean wondered if it was enough. He realized he hadn’t even said it to Cas yet, and here he was professing it to his brother. The smile that grew on Sam’s face told him that his brother was happy for him, which helped immensely.
Chuck’s attention shifted then to his soon-to-be husband, and Dean tried his hardest to pay attention. If only Cas didn’t look so damn sexy in that coat, and so cute at the same time, a look of serious concentration making its way across his features. “Castiel, even crazier than all that is the fact that Dean thinks your inability to remember simple idioms is adorable, and not the least bit annoying, so I’d say you’ve found a keeper.” Dean couldn’t contain the chuckle that rippled through his chest, gaining a smile from Cas in return. “He is the rock that keeps you from doubting whether you are strong enough to make it in this world without wings to power your flight.” Dean wanted to speak up, to tell Cas once again how strong he really was, but he knew Cas knew his thoughts on the subject. “He has taught you about everything that it means to be human, shown you what true passion and desire can feel like, even when the world has threatened to crumble around you both. And he has given you the peace you could never find among your brothers in heaven because he is the piece of the pie that was forever just out of your grasp.” Dean watched as Cas lost the battle and his tears dripped down his cheeks, his smile wide as he stared back at Dean.
“His grace.” Jack seemed to be lost as he stared at his adopted father’s motionless form. Dean tried to keep quiet, but he was itching to snap at the boy. “It’s like his grace is too much for his vessel.” Jack looked stuck by the thought, a sadness Dean felt himself deep in his chest. “I don’t understand.”
“Love can be the damnedest thing humanity has ever done.” Chuck’s voice carried across the silence of the clearing easily, the power and certainty in it helping to steady any of the last remnants of nervousness that Dean possessed. “It can make a man crazy with jealousy, bring him to his knees when it’s gone. Or in cases like the one in front of me, bring a man back from the brink of death, powered by his need to be with the one he was made to stand beside in a lifetime of trials and joy. Love is the most powerful gift I gave to you, and I am overjoyed when I see that you finally chose to see it in each other.” The smile in Chuck’s eyes verified the truth behind his words, and Dean felt his own heart swell.
Little blessings came in the form of a dark night and a lucky choice to park out back. Dean grabbed the front of Cas’s t-shirt, pulling him hard into a feverish kiss. The things Cas did to him, it was a high unlike any other. His hands found their way up to the nape of Cas’s neck, pulling him in even closer. Their tongues danced against one another, making Dean wonder if they would even make it as far as Baby. He pulled away, seeing the same heat in Cas’s eyes that he felt in his groin.
Doubt filled Sam’s mind when he wondered if Dean had ever even heard the song before now. His suspicions were confirmed when he glanced over to where his brother sat. Dean looked like he was stuck between awe and the urge to jump the stage and carry Cas away to do things that Sam would need brain bleach for. He looked like he was on the verge of bouncing in his seat, palm against his groin, which Sam definitely tried his best to ignore. He must have laughed, because Dean threw a “Shut it, Sammy” his way. Dean shot the words across the table without taking his eyes off the stage, but there was no threat there. Dean was too wrapped up in Cas.
Cas looked up, his eyes guarded. “Dean. I am glad we were able to solve your problem. It might be prudent of us to restrain ourselves next time so that you are able to learn proper grooming on your own.” Cas bent to reach for his belt, his zipper still undone and teasing Dean with the sight of Cas’s dark curls. Dean didn’t let on that Cas was forgetting his underwear, stupidly thinking it might be his only token to take from tonight.
Zephaniel was born on a boring Tuesday morning. Dean had been a complete wreck the entire time, which hadn’t surprised Sam in the slightest. Throughout the entire four-month ‘pregnancy’, Dean had waited on Cas hand and foot, constantly checking on him and demanding that he let Dean do everything to keep him comfortable. Sam had thought Dean was going overboard a bit, but then again, how many of them had experience with Angel pregnancy? They had all been flying by the seat of their pants.
“Not long after I raised you from the pit, I began to become connected to your prayers.” Dean nodded, already knowing this part of their story. “That included any prayers that were regarding you as well.” Confusion flashed across Dean’s features. “Souls in heaven are still able to pray, and I found that your mother and father did so frequently.” Understanding flashed through Dean’s eyes, which were quickly filled with tears.
“So, Cas.” He started, flicking his eyes off the road for a moment to take a look at Cas. The man looked better than the night before, but there was something off about his demeanor. Cas had never been the overly happy, peppy type, but now he seemed even more reserved than normal. Dean silently hated himself for giving in the night before, knowing that as much as it had rocked his world, Cas had been vulnerable. He had taken advantage of him. He felt like a sleazeball. “Anything new since you’ve become human?” Dean kicked himself at how stupid he sounded in that moment, but even if he had to go far down the chick flick rabbit hole, he would do it to make Cas feel better.
“Dean, we need to talk. Food first, or-” Sam sorta paused, giving Dean the option of choosing the prolonged suffering. But Dean answered quickly, surprising Sam by the regained clarity in his voice. Sam felt his chest tighten, wondering how much longer his brother could hold on.
Cas pulled away finally and smiled up into Dean’s green eyes. “Do you believe me now, Honeybee?” Dean always tried to pretend he hated the pet name, but Cas knew he secretly wouldn’t change it for the world. The light in Dean’s eyes was always a dead giveaway.
Whatever excuse was just beyond Dean’s lips, Cas couldn’t bear to listen to it. “No, Dean. Please,” he lowered the volume of his voice, shocked by the fact that he was nearly yelling. “Please, stay. I need you here.” Cas paused and rethought his approach. “We need you, Dean.”
indeed be painful, that is not what I meant, Dean. Our wings become highly sensitive, which some angels find erotic pleasure in.”
“Dean...” Cas tried to say more but the pain overtook him then, and he dropped the phone on the ground next to him as he lost consciousness.
Cas pressed into Dean, grinding his hips purposefully into Dean’s, their cocks rubbing delightfully into one another. Dean’s head flipped back with a moan, and Cas whispered into Dean’s ear, “Just because I have not performed the acts myself, does not mean I do not know how they are done, Dean.” Cas elicited a gasp from Dean’s lips as he licked the skin below Dean’s ear. “I have been around long enough, and have seen enough to know how to make your toes curl in pleasure.” Dean’s cock hardened at the words. He didn’t know where this version of Cas had come from, but he definitely wasn’t going to complain.
It's another Hurt/Comfort scene that I really didn't feel worked for what I wanted the original piece to be, but I always wanted to explore it. So thanks to captainhaterade's want list for Profound Bond's Quaratine & Chill Exchange, since that was what gave me the motivation to write it.
“After we started our relationship, Cas turned off Angel Radio.” Dean winced at the memory and stroked Cas’s hand. “Some of your brothers weren’t too happy with us.” That was the understatement of the century, but the details weren’t necessary.
Cas had grown in the time since he had become human in more than just body, Dean couldn’t deny that. But he almost didn’t recognize the man on stage when Cas walked up to the mic. His angel wasn’t a mousy man by any means, but there was a definite sex appeal that Cas was harnessing from somewhere. He almost seemed to move with more certainty than Dean had ever seen.
“Good noises, Cas. Please.” He was begging. For fuck’s sake, he was actually begging. “Keep going. Please.” He felt Cas shift his weight, and he was surprised to feel Cas harden against him. His own cock responded in turn, pressed into the sheets.
“Yes. When you became a demon, your soul transformed, gaining wings that, while generally noncorporeal in nature, do need to be groomed and tended at times.” Cas had the same spark in his eyes that Sam usually got when he found a particularly interesting case. Dean almost thought it was cute. Almost.
“Well, I texted Sammy, so he should be ready to help ya set up a room.” Dean’s light laughter was now gone from Cas’s ears, replaced by the awkwardness from earlier in the day. He fought against the urge to yell obscenities at Dean in that moment, wishing he could just take it back.
“We’re both idjits, you know that?” Cas cocked his head at the words. Dean leaned away back into his seat, but Cas felt him place his hand over his, light and warm. “I thought you regretted it, Cas. I thought I took advantage of you.”
Sam stood, making sure to be extra noisy for Dean’s benefit, who barely looked up with a questioning glance. “I need to stretch my legs. Maybe get us some coffee.” Sam explained, pulling the first excuse his brain had offered. Dean gave just the subtlest of grunts in response, which registered as a blessing in Sam’s book. He stepped out of the door without further hesitation, needing to put space between the steady beeping of the monitors and himself. He couldn’t bear sitting there in the room any longer, just waiting for a miracle. Or worse, the absence of one entirely.
The day had been a whirlwind, but in the end, they all wound up crowded into a small bedroom, smiling down at a tiny baby with beautiful little black wings, smiles on everyone’s lips. He was the most beautiful child Sam had ever seen, a perfect combination of both Dean and Cas’s features.
Dean tried to remember the words, one last shred of hope holding onto his heart. Maybe this was what he needed to do. Cas wasn’t dead. He could still fix this. But he could barely breathe. He couldn’t even think around the tears in his eyes. The words stopped coming and he knew then that Cas was.. Was...
Dean found his voice, Sam’s heart breaking at the sound of tears in his brother’s throat. “Can we see him?” Sam wanted to reach out, hug his brother then and there, but Dean honestly might punch him in this state of upheaval.
Sam sat in a hard plastic chair, feeling dizzy from watching his brother pace the floor of the waiting room. He wanted to help him, say anything that he could to calm Dean’s nerves, but his tongue seemed thick in his mouth, too dry and not quite the right size. Dean stopped, glancing back to the doors at the end of the hall, before returning to the dizzying pace.
Cas let out a small breath before continuing, a resoluteness in his eyes. “While if done roughly or incorrectly, grooming
Sam would sometimes give them privacy by sitting outside the room, knowing full well that he also needed the space. He was running low on hope and he just couldn’t keep living through Dean’s blind devotion. Sometimes he would read while he waited for the change that never came, sometimes he would video chat with Eileen. He wanted to keep her involved in the whole process, but it was hard enough not knowing where he fit into the puzzle.
Sam couldn’t help the smallest smile that formed across his face as he took in the sight of Jody, still in her uniform, arguing with the nurses at their station. Something about her mother-like anger warmed him for just the smallest second, even if he felt guilty at the expression as soon as it settled on his face.
Except for the large man who was headed straight toward them with a big grin on his lips. Nick was about the age their dad would have been if he were still alive, but he looked like the years hadn’t been too rough on him. He wore his hair longer than Dean remembered, and while it had greyed with the years, it looked like most of it had stayed around to see this decade. The man was the basic image of a rugged old biker type: too many tattoos and an overly hard exterior, but definitely a softy when given the chance, the exact picture of what you would expect when you asked for the owner of a bar.
“Well, it’s not like you’re exactly a rockstar, either, Cas.” Dean’s tone was biting, and Sam saw Cas flinch. The man stood and left the room without a word. He pushed past Sam, who still stood in the doorway, and was watching as Dean’s irritation instantly seemed to vanish.
“You mean, do we have sex or not?” Dean couldn’t wrap his head around it, not in the moment. He was completely thrown by what was happening to him. How could Cas be both so deliciously sexy and so clinical at the same time? It was infuriating, in just the right way Dean found.
“Well, I’ve found that I do not care for pain.” Dean flicked his eyes back over again, catching a bit of a snarky grin flashing across lips.
Cas looked up to see Chuck still standing before them, having been forgotten in their teasing. Sam had disappeared back into the group of their remaining family members, somewhere across the bunker. “Hope I’m not interrupting anything too critical.” Dean looked like he wanted to say he was, but thought better of it. “I would like to get going, got tons of God stuff to do,” Cas didn’t even try to make sense of what that could possibly mean, “but I have one last gift for you two.” He held out his hand, revealing what Cas saw to be a small vial.
The last three years hadn’t been easy, but they had all come through it basically unscathed. They had just a few weeks ago set the world back to order, helping Chuck and Amara rekindle their lost relationship. When the two had left them, their little world had grown relatively quiet. Sam had kept in touch with other hunters since, but they had all decided they needed a vacation for just a little while.
Charlie came next, no jokes in her normal way, rather she grabbed Dean without a word. Sam silently thanked her for pulling Dean into the tightest hug he had ever witnessed his brother receive, watching as the two both shook as they held each other. Charlie was another one who would hurt alongside them, having grown incredibly close to Cas over the last two years. It was a painful moment as Sam realized just how much Cas had become a part of everyone, and how much they would all lose in just a few hours time.
Cas pulled back again, eliciting a frustrated groan from Dean. The demon looked up to find heat in the angel’s eyes. “Dean, while we have established that we are both enjoying ourselves, we need to examine our intentions.” Dean wanted to punch something for all the frustration he felt. His brain was already moving as slow as molasses and Cas wanted to have a chat about
It took Dean over an hour before he looked over and said a single word to Sam, which crushed Sam’s heart all over again. “Tomorrow.”
“Come on, Sam. We should probably go check on them.” He heard the resignation in her voice, the sound of a woman who was ready to hold and comfort when nothing else could be done. He let her lead the way, not really ready himself to be back in the room again with no changes or answers there to help ease the situation.
He tucked his head down into the pillow, resting his forehead on his arm. He felt the mattress give as Cas climbed up with him, waiting a moment for Cas to move. When he didn’t, he managed to speak. “Might be easier for you to reach if you-” Nope, not going to use the word
Cas caught a flash of humor that lit Dean’s eyes. He was unsure why the hunter found him amusing at that moment, but he didn’t press him. “Come on, buddy. Let’s get you out of here before you go all pruny.” Dean offered both his hands, which Cas took greedily, blaming it on his unsteady legs and not on his need to touch Dean.
Cas withdrew his hands instantly, and Dean shook and gasped at the sudden loss of Cas’s fingers, but it was only for a breath or two. He swore Cas moved faster than humanly possible, lining up their bodies to take Dean’s ass. Cas paused, a moment so short that Dean would have thought he imagined it if not for his painful awareness of Cas’s every motion. A single second seemed to stretch on, and then Cas was pushing into him, his hard cock much wider than his fingers, but Dean didn’t gasp. He didn’t moan. His eyes shifted instantly to black as he felt the most primal side of himself react to a need he never knew he possessed. The sound that left his lips was completely and utterly inhuman.
Sam sat back and took in Cas on the stage, staying quiet by signing with Eileen. He couldn’t ruin this moment for Dean. Cas was literally letting his rock god out, swaying in time to the music, and Sam had to confirm with Eileen when she said, “He’s really good, isn’t he?” Sam had to admit, not only was Cas landing the notes, he was just letting it all go and singing his heart out. He was throwing saucy looks at Dean anytime the lyrics deemed it necessary.
Dean wasn’t fighting his tears anymore, his hands itching to either pull Cas into him or at least wipe at his damned cheeks. Chuck started back up again, though Dean barely heard what he said, losing himself again in the color of Cas’s eyes. Seeing all of their future laid out before him. “Your vows have been heard by everyone important to you two, and now I want to give both something to mark your words.” Dean looked to Chuck as he pulled two small silver bands out of his pocket, handing one to each of them.
Sammy was already at the table when Dean walked in, heading straight for the coffee maker. The younger Winchester looked up with annoyance before pointing his gaze back down at the paper in his hands. Dean thought they had gotten past the whole Gadreel thing, so he felt a bit thrown.
“Eileen and I are just debating how serious you are about that.” Dean didn’t even feel embarrassed by the fact that his admission had been said out loud. He couldn’t even try to force it. Everything he needed was in the man on the stage, and for the rest of his life, that would always be enough.
Dean focused just a tiny bit as Sam shook him harshly. He was standing in the doorway. Almost gone. Almost outside. Air. More outside. “Sammy, let go.” Dean was scared, he sounded so calm. How could he be calm? There was no air. Like underwater, only too bright. Too white. And soon no sunshine. His sunshine. His Cas.
But, even though he wasn’t going to admit it anytime soon, Dean was starting to get worried that this was just something human. None of their usual tests, at least the ones they could do with other bar-goers around, came up with any results. The bar itself seemed pretty normal too, the only real plus being that Nick ran a decent live band setup for his karaoke nights, rather than the crap machines most places used. The only thing that kept him from throwing in his chips completely was the stupid flower that he still couldn’t place.
As the music ended, Dean stood, getting ready to grab Cas the minute his feet hit the ground. But he paused as he saw Nick take the stage, slapping Cas on the shoulder before speaking into the microphone in an effort to silence the clapping bar rats. Dean settled back into the chair, trying to ignore the itch in his skin that demanded he have his hands all over Cas.
Cas couldn’t help teasing his husband. “Just good? I guess I’ll have to rethink this marriage if it was just
The hodgepodge group of hunters made their way through the door, and Dean found himself falling into his element. The bar was quite a bit nicer than the seedy dives they usually ended up in. Even so, it still had all the same elements, only without the unwanted side effect of leaving Dean desperate for a shower. A quick glance towards the bar assured Dean that the selection would be just a bit above average, which was never a bad thing. The decor was standard for a middle America bar, nothing really sticking out.
“I know.” Sam agreed, nodding as he took the phone back. “I can’t place it either, but I swear we’ve seen this before. Either way, I think he’s right and this is our kind of thing. So we need to saddle up and get out there before karaoke starts tonight.”
He knows that, of course. He’s not a child, or an idiot. But his body feels things differently now - heat, cold, pain, pleasure - he’d forgotten. He still forgets.
He makes it about two hours before the center line starts wavering like a mirage, and he’s forced to pull over and sleep.
“Look, Cas - I’m a dragon!” Lilly plants her feet in the dry, crackling grass, and throws her head back in an exaggerated roar, exhaling a great cloud of silver-spun breath into the grey winter sky. “Try it!”
Cas pushes both his hands into Dean’s hair, so that Dean has to tip his head back to look up at him. The angle - that long expanse of sun-darkened skin, and the bright blue of Cas’ eyes looking down at him, hungry, sends a pleasant chill down Dean’s spine.
“Hey, squirt - breakfast is ready,” Dean calls from the porch, and instantly Lilly is sprinting for the door. She stops only to crush herself against Dean’s side in a breathless hug. Castiel lingers on the lawn, feeling like his feet have sunk into the dying grass. Dean stands, not quite looking at him, one hand shoved into the pocket of his sweatpants, the other picking at some loose fragment of wood on the deck rail.
- cool and salt-tinged. There are just a few families on the beach - colourful shapes in the distance, their laughter sometimes only
Cas continued, “Those under the influence of the spell have been known to act impulsively. And not be particularly discerning about their partners. Or their willingness to participate. Sam called me in case he needed...backup.”
Sam ends up deciding that, not only do they need a spell to summon a specific spirit, but they need another to amplify the power of a summoning. Anything, he reasons, that will give them a better chance of actually making a strong connection, since Cas obviously hasn’t been able to manage it himself.
“And you’re sure no one’s going to end up - turned into a pillar of salt or something?” he presses, because as eager as he is, Sam has a family now - and he won’t risk that, even for Cas.
Another bubble of laughter rose up from the guests - warm, understanding, affectionate. Cas slid his arm around Dean’s shoulders, feeling him shaking beneath his stiff new shirt with barely-held emotion, pressed his face into Dean’s shoulder, and listened to the end of the vows, lifting his head as the officiant announced: “You may now kiss the bride,” just in time to see Eileen surge up on her toes to kiss Sam first. The assembled crowd burst into riotous applause and whistling. Dean made a sound that was half laughter and half joyous sob.
“H’lo?” There’s static on the line, cold and piercing. Dean presses a hand over his free ear as it hisses and clicks. “Hello?”
Cas tucks two fingers into the waistband of Dean’s trunks, right at the base of his spine, and grins into Dean’s neck.
“Hi Jack!” Lilly says, cheerfully unperturbed, her mouth stuffed full of Cheerios. By virtue of being the only person in the house who had a decent night’s sleep, she’s in a great mood.  Dean, on the other hand, feels like he has sand in his eyeballs and static electricity in his brain.
It had seemed like a no-brainer. If he was alone, if he just closed his door, turned off the lights, he’d be fine. Sam could work on a counter-curse; and if Dean got really desperate in the meantime, he could just rub one out.
“That I shouldn’t,” Cas pushed a hand, gently, through Dean’s hair, traces of hair gel making the strands prick against his palm. “Though it is the truth.”
Warm spring sunlight bathed the hills surrounding the bunker in a gradient of white and gold. towering trees, worn with time, tangled shrubs and wild grasses stretched themselves towards the light, spread their leaves, hummed in the faint, cool wind. The peak of the power plant’s roof, just visible over the rise, was dappled with green, gold, and grey, its worn tiles rippling like water.
Sometimes, he wishes Cas’d had other clothes, something in his closet at the bunker that Dean could have packed up and taken with him. As it is, Dean has saved his old jacket, the one with the handprint permanently stained into the shoulder; and there’s a fake ID for Agent Moscone tucked into the back of the glove box, but that’s it. Cas never quite got the hang of keeping things.  There was probably a good reason for that.
There’s a plate of leftovers under plastic wrap waiting for him on the kitchen counter, because Sam may risk blowing up his brother’s brain with sketchy magic, but he wouldn’t let him starve. Dean eats in the living room, in the dark, grimly admiring the sigil left scorched on the surface of the coffee table. He’ll have to re-finish that, he decides, just to make it up to them.
“Are you alright?” Cas’ voice sounded rougher than usual, jagged at the edges. Dean reached back, touching his bare thigh with cautious fingers.
Sam’s response is, “I mean - pretty sure. The spells are designed for spirits, not angels...and we’ll need one that can bring us a specific - uh - entity, instead of whatever’s just hanging around. But it’s worth a shot.”
Sam digs up a bigger, flashier spell, something that both he and Jack swear up and down will make Dean
The jeans go next. Cas doesn’t need any real direction on when to lift his hips, though he’s looking at Dean like maybe he’s seeing him for the first time, mouth slack and licked-wet lips parted, and when Dean leans in to kiss him again, he meets Dean half-way - no hesitation - a sweet slip of tongue before he sucks on Dean’s lower lip, cradling Dean’s face between his hands.
They drive through until late afternoon, taking the backroads that Dean always prefers when he’s got nowhere to be. They’re already starting to lose daylight when they drive past an old farmyard - tilting barn, big old house with the paint peeling off the outside, and a For Sale sign on a half-torn down fence - and a few minutes later they’re cruising down one of those picture-perfect little main streets, peppered with tidy storefronts like something out of a Rockwell painting.  Dean spots a diner, and pulls into the parking lot.
The way he says it, with just the tiniest unsteady edge - Dean would give Cas his whole heart if Cas asked. Hell, he already has.
Dean leaves early the next morning. He doesn’t have a case to work on exactly, but there’s a rash of missing person’s cases in Millersburg, Ohio that look like they might be something up his alley, and he wants to be able to stop for lunch on the way without losing too much time.
Dean slid off the table, forcing Cas to take a step back to make room for him - but not far. Dean’s hands remained securely at his waist, steering him carefully towards the hall as Dean leaned in for another kiss - equally tender to the last, but with an edge of excitement.
through the screen door. Lilly’s had him read it so many times that he must have it memorized by now.
He’s still got Cas’ number, saved in his phone. It’s been a while since he broke down and actually called it, listened to it go straight to voicemail, the low, confused rumble of Cas’ recorded voice:
“It’s...overwhelming,” Jack sighs. He stares at his burger like it holds the secrets of the universe. “There’s so much need. But too much intervention is…”
Dean snorts. “No it didn’t. It seemed like the only idea. And it probably was. But goddamn it, Cas...I was so pissed at you. For so long. You dumped all that on me and -”
“Dean?” Cas’ hand touches his back, and Dean jumps, yanked forcefully out of his own head. Cas eyes him, worriedly. “Is everything alright?”
“We use you,” Jack says. The room goes silent for a moment, then Jack blinks. “Well - Cas was already reaching out to him. That means Cas must be able to see him from wherever he is, at least sometimes. We just have to make him....brighter.”
Cas grumbles about it, but he forces himself to let Dean go.  Still, once they’re tucked in bed, he curls in as close to Dean as possible, presses himself against Dean’s back like he wants to crawl inside Dean’s skin; and yeah -
Sam clears his throat, rubs the heels of his sock feet against the rug. He never could sit still when he was anxious. “You don’t have to do this anymore - wasn’t that the whole point?”
“What the hell, Sam,” Dean chokes. If there was ever a time for the floor to open up underneath him, this would be it. Dean tries to stare his brother down, but he’s well aware that his entire head is glowing like some kind of massive emergency light.  Still, Sam breaks first, barking with laughter.
Cas spreads his palm, wide and warm, over Dean’s belly, kisses beneath his ear. “I promise, I don’t care about that. Please. Can I touch you?”
Wordlessly, with the towel draped mostly over his head, so that he wouldn’t be tempted to look up, Dean patted the tile next to him. When Cas sat, Dean stole a glance at him. He looked good, maybe a little stunned; his face flushed, dark hair plastered to his head.
“I think you’re doing just fine.” Cas bumps his forehead against Dean’s temple, his mouth against the line of Dean’s jaw. “We do always seem to figure things out. Eventually.”
“He called me,” Cas explained, speaking slowly, like he was trying to be sure that Dean understood every word. “Some of the things he was finding in his research are...concerning.”
“Yeah - you said all that stuff, and I didn’t know what to do with it, Cas. I wasn’t even sure what it meant, and you were just fucking
Dean rolls into Millersburg just a little too late to do anything constructive on his potential case; so instead of hitting up the police station like he planned, he gets a room at a dumpy little motel just off the highway, picks up something to eat from the diner next door (which he isn’t even really hungry for and ends up getting stuffed into the mini-fridge) and sacks out in front of the T.V.
Jack reaches out, and tears open the veil. There’s a bright flash of blue-white light, and Cas spills out onto the linoleum, almost landing right on top of Dean. The air smells like a lightning strike, and it’s cold enough that Dean’s breath fogs the air for a few seconds before the temperature equalizes.
Despite Jack’s best intervention, Dean is left with a splitting headache for the rest of the day. He takes more painkillers than is probably strictly advisable and crawls into bed, then wakes up sometime around midnight, starving, with the taste of blood in the back of his throat.
.” Sam huffs, folding his arms. “Actually - Eileen and I went on a quick salt-and-burn a couple of weeks ago…”
T-shirt - he, Jack and Sam all bought matching ones, on their last Saturday trip, while Eileen and Dean were back at the bunker watching cartoons and eating cereal - and it’s really not the least bit sexy, even soaked through and half-transparent; but it’s so intrinsically
“I can’t find him,” Jack says, hands curling and uncurling at his sides. All around them the street is filling up with people, people who don’t even know they lost whole days of their lives, who don’t know anything has changed.
“I like hearing you say that,” he murmurs. He slips his fingers under Cas’ shirt at the back, up the divot of his spine, and Cas shivers against him. “You wanna go to bed with me, Cas?”
; Dean gave it to her last Christmas, just to see the look on Sam’s face - until Cas starts to look hazy around the eyes, and Dean announces, “Okay squirt - time for Cas to hit the hay. He’s had a long day.”
“You ever think of doing something like that?” he asked, voice barely above a whisper. The strange acoustics of the bunker carried the words nevertheless.
“Unfair?” Dean suggests. He feels a little itchy, just at the thought. He likes to think that Jack wouldn’t do that to anybody - make them live a life on the end of a bunch of carefully-pulled strings; but there’s that old saying about absolute power that keeps coming to mind.
“It’s a minor wound, Dean.” Matter-of-fact against the staggered beating of his heart. Suddenly, he wants to ask:
Dean stumbled as they reached the near-center of the cleared space, hesitant, feeling exposed; but Cas looped his arms around Dean’s neck, and Dean’s hands found Cas’ hips by instinct, and that was basically it. He closed his eyes, shifted himself to the music, waited for the dizziness to subside.
“Of course.” He kisses her cheek, because he likes to think it keeps Sam humble. “Sorry I was held up last time.”
“I don’t understand,” Jack picks at the sesame seeds on the top of his bun, flicks them away into the dirt as his feet, even though Dean’s pretty sure he doesn’t have anything against them.. When Sam was a kid, he wouldn’t even touch a bun or a piece of bread that had seeds on it. “Chuck didn’t have any trouble bringing Lucifer out of the Empty; but now it’s like - it’s like the Empty isn’t even there. Like it doesn’t exist.”
He manages, by some miracle, to act almost entirely normal as he checks them in; the anxious, electric feeling doesn’t come back until he’s shouldering his bag from the trunk, following Cas inside.
It was getting bad, he realized. Worse than he thought it would be. It had all seemed like a joke at first - a lust spell? Big fucking deal.
Dean taps the ball of his foot against the floor, just to break the silence. “So much for an eternity in the Empty, huh?”
So Dean holds on to it, keeps what he knows like a secret, a  treasure he buries inside of himself, the same way he always has - until one afternoon Cas comes in from outside, where he’s been playing with Lilly, digging in the fresh-turned ground of Sam’s makeshift garden plot, stripped bare for the winter; and there’s dirt all over his hands, streaked on his smiling face - and suddenly it’s too much. It’s too heavy to carry anymore, too big to keep trapped behind his teeth. Dean loves him, god, loves him so much it stops his heart, and his breath, and leaves him gasping in the middle of the kitchen.
It’s a nice little place, as it turns out. A bit quiet, maybe - Dean’s surprised to see so few locals out for dinner - but the waitress is friendly and the food is good; Dean even finishes his veggies. (Despite himself, he’s started appreciating the odd bit of ruffage.) They linger a while when they’re done, watching the traffic outside thin out as it gets darker. Not much activity on the streets after dark in a town this small, especially as the weather gets colder; but it leaves Dean feeling weirdly exposed. It’s obvious they’re not local, when they don't immediately bundle up and head home as soon as the streetlights come on.
Dean herds Cas into the shower, after. The place has decent water pressure, surprisingly, and a good hot water tank - or maybe they’re just the only ones using it. They spend a long time under the spray, sharing slow, water-logged kisses. Dean soaps up Cas’ hair into wild spikes with his fingers and laughs into his mouth. When they get out and towel off, Cas kisses away the droplets that catch on Dean’s eyelashes.
He’s discovered that he likes being able to do this - to touch Cas, simply, thoughtlessly. He likes best when he forgets to hesitate before doing it.
Dean cuts him off, laughing. “Okay, no Corn Palace. But just you and me for a couple of days. Waddya say?”
They spend most of their time just relaxing, moving around each other like a complicated dance. They take Lilly to the park, run as many errands as Eileen and Sam will trust them with, go on long drives, and watch too much TV. Cas and Jack go on long walks, or spend hours sitting in the backyard, talking.
“Shh.” He’s close enough to bump against Castiel now, arm sneaking out to hold Castiel’s hip, bracing rather than restraining. “You know - right? You know I didn’t mean that shit. I shouldn’t have said any of it.”
“No,” Lilly sighs dramatically, as if Jack’s absence weighs on her. “But Daddy says he’s very, very busy.”
He opens his eyes, just in time to see the head of his cock - dark, wet - emerge from the joined tangle of their fingers, and that’s it, Dean’s gone. He might even black out for a second, that’s how fast and hard it hits him. Cas works him through the whole thing, gradually loosening his grip, but never really letting go until Dean squirms and half-heartedly shoves at him, biting back a whine.
“I’ve been working on creating things,” Jack says, suddenly. When Dean blinks at him, a little alarmed, he clarifies, “just plants for now. It’s easy to hide things in the rainforest - so I don’t think anyone will notice. Animals are a little more complicated, and I don’t want to get them wrong.”
The top cover on the bed is pretty messy, so Dean folds it back and resolves to leave a generous tip for housekeeping. The hot shower did more to improve the temperature in the room than the heater probably ever will; but Cas still runs hot anyway, as good as a hot water bottle once they’re under the covers in the dark.
.” His throat goes tight, suddenly, and Dean swallows hard, rubs fitfully at his eyes like an overtired toddler. “It was him, Sam. I know it was.”
“Cas - Cas - fuck!” The phone sits dead in his hand. He rolls back over his recent calls and sees it again:
“Dean, are you -” Cas starts, but doesn't get to finish. Dean pulls Cas in, wiping the dirt from his cheeks with both hands, and kisses his grinning mouth. Cas’ hands flutter to his belt, then dig in tight, like he’s afraid Dean will fly away the moment he lets go.
Dean rolls up to the house just after four-thirty, parks the Impala and just sits for a minute, watching a little boy walk a dog that must weigh twice as much as he does down the long ribbon of sidewalk. The dog is a mass of shaggy brown fur and a great lolling tongue, and it plods along with the heartbreaking patience of a truly loyal animal, not giving the leash the slightest resistance. It doesn’t even glance in Dean’s direction, when he gets out of the car, too set on the mission of getting around the block, or wherever they’re going. They’re around the corner and out of sight by the time Dean climbs up the porch to the front door, ringing the bell, even though he knows it’s unlocked, before letting himself in.
Sleep hits him like a ton of bricks, and Dean doesn’t wake up until the next morning, to the sound of Sam’s voice saying -
Jack chews thoughtfully, wipes his face on the back of his hand. Dean passes him a napkin, because he raised Sam with manners - even if he forgets his own - he’s gonna make sure Jack has them too.
That doesn’t mean it isn’t also hollow, sometimes; but taking the winter off isn’t going to solve that.
It’s not exactly like Dean thought. He’d pictured more palm trees and fewer boardwalks, but it’s pretty beautiful anyway, that vast stretch of water reflecting the late-afternoon sun; and the breeze coming in off the ocean feels
“Hey - do you wanna see what he looked like?” Dean stands, biting back a groan at the twin ache in his knees and back. Damn, he’s getting old. “Look here.”
Warm, damp air tickles across Dean’s thighs and ass. He knows Cas is looking at him - hands hovering between them like they don’t know where to land - but Dean can’t immediately process that. He’s beyond thought; for a moment, there is only his body: the burning warmth in his neck, cheeks and ears; the slight, embarrassing tremor in his knees; the prickling of excitement across his skin. He sways forward on instinct, and Cas’ palm presses into his ribs, like he’s worried Dean will fall. Instead, Dean bumps his forehead gently against Cas’, nudging nose against nose, but not quite mouth against mouth. Cas closes his eyes; Dean can feel his arm trembling.
“Cas…” Dean pats at him with trembling hands, gets two solid fistfuls of his coat. Cas looks around, eyes wide and lost, like he doesn’t believe what he’s seeing. “Cas. I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”
,” Sam said, fondly exasperated. Both he and Eileen were wearing almost identical gentle smiles. “C’mon.”
Dean’s phone rings in his pocket. He pulls it out, but the caller ID is blocked again, so he hits ignore, and goes back to his lunch.
Dean hummed, fingers drumming against Cas’ belt. “Maybe cuz half the ropes aren’t staked in, but the thing still hasn’t dropped on anyone’s head.”
“Yeah, I know what you mean. I wish I was better at this, Cas.” He doesn’t necessarily mean any part of this specifically - more all of it, generally. He doesn’t know how to make things work the way Sam and Eileen do. He doesn’t know where to begin..
“I just love hearing about Frankie and Tobias, Ms. Rosman,” he replied good-naturedly. “It’s study hall with entertainment, what’s not to love?”
“Dean really is just the most wonderful kid,” she said brightly. “I just don’t understand how you always manage to get yourself into detention!”
Cas smiled, patting her awkwardly on the back. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt your conversation.”
“Oh, okay,” Cas said, flustered. “I, uh. I’m sorry, I already asked one intrusive question and I didn’t want to ask another.”
“Oh, uh,” Cas stammered, the butterflies in his stomach multiplying. “That’s cool. That’s really cool. Do you go because you’re, uh…?” He swallowed, cutting himself off. His tongue was running away with him.
“…but I swear it’s that diet they recommended, since I’ve only ever noticed this since I switched him over.”
The doors slammed shut, and momentarily Cas realized neither he nor Dean had moved. He turned to look at the other boy and found him with his head cocked to the side, green eyes staring at him. Cas’s breath caught and he quickly averted his gaze. With a sharp nod, he started to move towards the doors as well.
She gave a crinkly-eyed smile to both boys and trotted out of the school doors, calling back, “I’ll tell Tobias both of you are thinking about him!”
Cas paused and turned to face him, his heart racing for a reason he wasn’t quite yet sure he wanted to quantify. “Uh, yeah. Most people just call me Cas, though.”
“Every other day?” Cas asked, and immediately cringed at his clear boundary overstep. But Dean just snorted.
“Uh, yeah. There’s just no point in leaving yet… the hallways are probably a mess right now, and I don’t really want to get trampled,” he responded with a nervous huff of laughter. “Is it okay if I, uh, stay for a bit and finish writing my journal entry for the day?”
“That’s not true, they just want you to do well,” said Ms. Rosman bracingly. She straightened. “I really do have to run, though. It was nice to see you, Castiel.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I really liked them, I kinda wanted to put them on my wall or something.” He scratched at his neck. “I hope that’s not too weird or anything.”
“But Dean here, wonderful Dean,” she said, patting his shoulder fondly, “is letting me escape detention duty a little early so I have a bit more wiggle room.”
It wasn’t that they didn’t like being home. They did. But Anna wouldn’t be home until 4 at the earliest, and his mother an hour after that, and they
didn’t want to spend three hours alone with Jimmy Novak, who even with company could barely restrain himself from shooting suspicious glances at his child, as though trying to piece together why their head wasn’t screwed on straight and right. No thanks.
