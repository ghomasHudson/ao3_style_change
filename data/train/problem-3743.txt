“Well, I had knocked on her door and had a bunch of catnip in my pockets,” Gabe explains as Sam hesitantly reaches for the cat in his shelf. Unlike the abomination that had jumped on his bed, this cat just rubs its head against his hand and starts to purr. “He came out and started running around in the hall. I picked your lock and got him in here.”
“Yo, Winchester!” Diego yells, waving as both Winchesters whip their heads around. “Target practice!”
Dean drifts away from the two moms, who don’t even seem to notice him leaving, and back to Cas, who takes his hand immediately.
He hopes Sam didn’t hear him calling Cas huggy bear—and what the fuck of a nickname is that, anyway?
, this is almost worse than being naked. What will John and Sam think when they see him wearing this on the television screen?
Dean can’t, for example, imagine Castiel’s body dyed green like the woman in front of him with a wig of neon blue corkscrew curls and lips a bright shade of orange. He can’t imagine any of the escorts like that; their outfits are all so similar they’re impossible to differentiate from. Either that or they’re the same outfits every day, which Dean thinks might be a little too crazy, even for the Capitol.
“I’m going to protect you,” Jo says fiercely. “I know you think you’re going to protect me. But I’m going to protect you too. You’re going to come back to Sam. I swear it.”
“Shut up,” Sam hisses, glancing around with paranoia as if people will be able to figure out what he’s talking about immediately. More importantly, he’s making sure you’re not around.
Charlie nods, smiling gently. “It’s my first year with the Games. I wanted to be a Gamekeeper, but they wanted me here.”
Hey guys! Happy early Christmas for those who celebrate. If you don't, happy holiday season! I would say I hope receiving this chapter cheers you up but I don't think it will :). Anyways, I am happy to report that I have been working on some of the later chapters for this story and am coming out of an awful writer's block, so that's fun! Also, my work is shutting down for two months for the season so I would have more free time except my swim and lacrosse seasons are starting up. So we'll see how much writing I actually get done. Anyways, hope you enjoy and comment! Tell me how you're (safely) celebrating the holidays or what you'd like to see for the ending/climax of the story. I just really want to hear from y'all.
In the opening ceremonies, tributes are supposed to wear outfits that represent their districts, ie agriculture for District 11 or fishing for District 4. District 5’s principal industry is power and electricity that mostly comes from a hydroelectric dam. More often than not District 5 tributes are dressed in a scanty little water-like outfit or a worker outfit. It’s practically sicking, and always predictable.
“—but I bet there will be at least a minor one today, considering all the bonfires and grilling,” Sam’s saying to Bobby, who’s nodding. Jo shakes her head and crosses her arms.
“How despicable we must seem to you,” Charlie says after a moment. She’d obviously been watching Dean’s face as it contorted, looking around at all the elegance people only get to experience for a few days a year.
It takes almost three hours until Dean’s prep team deems him suitable to be presented to his stylist. Those three hours were, to put it lightly, torture. They’d cut Dean’s hair, shaved his face roughly, and pulled hair out of places he hadn’t even known it was growing in (seriously, though, who cares if he’s got hair in his nose?). The one things they hadn’t touched were the bruises on his wrists and his amulet, but Dean’s face still gets hotter every time he feels someone’s eyes on the imprints. And he’d thrown a right bitch fit in order to keep that amulet on, but he’s
“You call me,” Dean says quickly. “You’ve probably got meetings and stuff. Important stuff that I shouldn’t interrupt.”
Dean nearly jumps out of his skin. The Peacekeeper in front of him still wears his mask, but Dean can recognize that voice easily.
Peacekeepers rotate out about every five hours. Whoever’s in charge stations the great majority of them in close proximity to the fence, and for a good reason too—in the past three years, eight people have tried to escape the district. The Peacekeepers whipped them for their temerariousness. Each Peacekeeper has a partner, and they stand about 500 feet away from the nearest Peacekeeper pair. Although a few patrol the streets for violence and crime, not many do. Dean’s sure that there are more Peacekeepers that do that in the poorer parts of District 5, which probably has a lot more crime because they’re not supplied enough food.
Dean doesn’t say anything. This isn’t exactly what he’d pictured. This person that he assumes to be ‘Charlie’ is, first of all, a girl. Second, her hair is obviously real and not style. Her face is makeup free and clothes not garish like the rest of the insect’s.
Hey everyone. We are getting closer and closer to the end of this story (only three chapters left after this!!!) I am really nervous and I really need to keep writing the sequel lol. Anyways, enjoy!
“You were… well, you screamed,” Sam says awkwardly. “Jo, and hellhounds…” He trails off. He’s not saying the whole truth. Dean’s stomach clenches at what else he might have said in his sleep. Nothing about Naomi, right? Did he call out for Mary? Or—God forbid—Cas? What will Sam think of Dean if— “I just… I know you miss her. I miss her, too.”
“Of course. Should I call you or…” Dammit, now Dean can picture him cocking his head as he asks the question.
“I’m fine,” Jack insists. “See?” Five pokes his skin with the tip of the knife, marveling when the skin opens but no blood runs out and it knits itself back together in mere seconds.
Hey guys! So this is the first chapter of the actual Games. Make sure to look at the tags for trigger warnings. Most of them are to be expected, but I just want to make sure everyone knows what they're getting into.
“Dean hasn’t spoken to me in three days,” Cas says in that deep, slow Cas way of his. “Do you know if he is mad at me?”
“I’m fine,” Cas groans, on the ground and not sounding very fine. “I suppose our questions were answered. I am still unable to be killed except by my—”
“I’m not…” Jo pushes up Dean’s left sleeve just enough to see the sausage-shaped bruises on his wrist. His hand twitches in hers but he doesn’t pull away, which is a big improvement since the first time Jo had found out about John’s training.
“When I have a fever, Mommy gives me Pee-dee-lite,” Claire said, continuing to observe him critically. “And she puts her hand on me like this.” Leaning forward, she placed one tiny palm on his forehead, and Dean gasped at the contrasting coolness of her skin. “I think you have a fever, Uncle Dean. Your head is very, very hot,” she said.
He couldn’t help chuckling a little. “You got me. Don’t think I can just let this die, not until I have some sort of answers. Shit’s too weird.”
Sam snorted a laugh, then reached into the trunk himself. “Yes, your Highness,” he said, dropping a tiara onto Dean’s brow. The tiara drooped to the side, earning another chuckle.
Being the object of such close scrutiny made Dean want to squirm, but it also caused him to grow even harder in his jeans. “Spent a lot of time working outside without a shirt when I was younger, and they never really go away,” he mumbled. “Dude, they’re not exactly sexy.”
“Your mother is fine,” Dad said briskly, not turning to check. Frowning, Castiel looked closer, seeing details he hadn’t noticed in his agitation: the way she was holding her arm awkwardly against her body, how she was holding a bit of gauze tightly against the skin bared by her rolled-up sleeve. A hypodermic needle, uncapped and empty, lay discarded on the surface of the desk, and next to that, as Castiel watched, Dad now placed the empty one he’d apparently just finished using. The sight elicited an sympathetic throb of pain in his own recently vaccinated arm.
“His receiver circuit is probably dead, if I had to guess. He’s probably not looking at it too closely, especially if he thinks there’s nobody living to talk back to him. So asking him directly whether he’s anywhere near New Lebanon is out of the question.” Dropping to the floor to sit cross-legged, Charlie propped her chin in her hands, elbows resting on her knees, and studied Dean’s face. “The signal is either coming straight from a radio or from a signal repeater we don’t know about. If it’s a repeater, of course, then you’d have to track down whether the signal is getting there only secondhand, or third, or fourth…”
A tiny yellow glow popped up from behind the toy kitchen, making a whirring noise that Castiel supposed was a laugh. There was a sudden flashing arc of pink, and then the siblings were zooming about the area, accompanied by a cacophony of angry-sounding buzzes, chirps, and chitters.
“Redundant phrase,” Dean answered. They were still close enough that their noses were brushing lightly, and swarms of butterflies were taking flight in Dean’s stomach. That was standard for anytime they shared small intimate moments like this one, but there was another reason for Dean’s skin to be popping up goosebumps just then. “One more box to open, and then you’ll see.”
Before the brothers end up wrestling on the floor (which happens more than Bobby, who claims responsibility for raising them, would like to admit) Bobby orders them to sit down.
You look over at the group. Jody and Ellen are talking normally, Sam and Bobby look to be discussing something serious, and Dean has hoisted Jo up and is carrying her like a sack of flour. It must be a normal occurrence if all the adults are ignoring the two.
Something cracks behind him and Dean whirls, heart racing, but it’s just Sam stepping on a stick. “You can go in front,” Dean invites. Sam nods and takes the lead.
“Public appearances?” Dean asks with a sigh, then he freezes. She might tolerate his unwillingness on good days, but today is not exactly a good day.
Hey so this chapter has a trigger warning so if you get upset by this stuff please do not read, I don't want to be responsible for someone getting hurt
“Hold on a sec,” Sam mutters. He fishes his phone out of his pocket. “Should probably give Jack a heads-up.” He scowls. “No service.”
Then armored trucks pull up to the Justice building and Peacekeepers pour out, brandishing guns and other projectile weapons.
After hearing that you’d already heard about him, Dean goes out of his way to talk to you so much that you feel comfortable enough to say hi to both brothers by the end of the week. Now Sam’s a bit jealous his brother got the graveyard shift, because he can say hi to Y/N whenever he’s going to work or coming home.
“Luci watches him since he’s still on house arrest,” Cas answers, looking through his pockets. “I’ll have to figure out if someone would like to babysit him when his sentence is lifted. Can I have the paper back?”
Dean’s more likely to punch someone, and Jo knows it, so she just sighs with resignation and turns away from the window. Her small hand lands on Dean’s bicep and he flinches.
“I still don’t know how Gabe persuaded him to do that,” Sam adds thoughtfully. He yelps when Dean smacks his shoulder.
“I…” Helplessly, Dean spreads his hands. He really doesn’t want to fight with Sam. The first two years after Dean won the Games was filled with fights because Sam didn’t understand why Dean couldn’t be around him as much anymore. He probably still doesn’t but is resigned to it.
“So you’re all the same age,” Sam says for the third time. “Except for the kid, who is not actually a kid.”
“Claire and Owen wanted to hang out with their Aunt Donna. God knows they’ll have at least fifteen more toys and clothes by the time I get home,” Jody replies. “Hey, did you know Sean and I are thinking of getting one more?”
Reviews are welcomed and appreciated always. I will try to respond to them. Tell me about your hopes, concerns, anything about this story, or simply tell me about your day. I'd love to hear it.
Dean groans with frustration at the sight of a red hem turning the corner of the labyrinth he’s currently trapped in with his brother and Cas, with no way to call their backup, Jack, for help, because there’s no service in this goddamn maze.
Rowena left the boys to deal with the five adults and one bloodthirsty preteen, citing the need to find whatever ingredient that exists in this universe and not in their own.
All too soon, the next three chariots roll out of the glorified stable. Exchanging glances filled with trepidation, Dean and Jo reach up simultaneously and flip the switch on their headpieces. Immediately the sound of crackling electricity fills Dean’s ears. He doesn’t know what he looks like, but he can see Jo, and the effect is stunning. The two-pronged headpiece spits sparks (Charlie had sworn they were synthetic and wouldn’t burn if they landed on Dean).
The glances Dean and Jo exchange are more panicked than excited, but either their prep teams don’t notice or they notice but don’t care.
You shrug. “In my space, it was all I could do. Besides, I’m so busy that a cat was the best option, but I’m hoping to get a puppy soon that can hang out at the training center while I’m working or maybe work as a volunteer at the hospital. I was talking to a woman named Hannah who works as a nurse about it a while ago.”
Sam turns to look at the deceptively cute-looking bunny Cas had left him with. Dean had gotten Cas Fluffy for, like, their third date or something and Cas had loved him ever since. He had brown eyes, grey fur, and one white ear.
There’s a monstrous man called Luther (who is very white), and the man dressed in black leather that had thrown a knife at Cas is called Diego (who is definitely not white, probably Mexican). He marvels at how Cas survived the knife to the chest as well as two bullet wounds, even going so far as insisting that he take off his shirt to prove he doesn’t have a bulletproof vest on.
Dean thought admiringly as he watched him go. The muscles of Castiel’s calves were built enough to be visible through the fabric of his track pants, and his ass…well. Dean had to force himself to stop staring at the hypnotic flexing of Castiel’s glutes when he tripped and almost fell over a mid-sized rock.
The sound of muffled conversation pulled his attention back. “Yeah, they’re right—” Bobby was saying, interrupted by someone in the background who sounded impatient and tense. A moment later, Bobby was saying, “Hang on,” and the comms switched hands.
Castiel huffed, rocking his head back against the wall dully. “No,” he said. “Actually, at this point, it’d be such a train wreck that even I don’t want to witness the fallout. And…honestly…” He bit back a dry laugh and put a palm over his face for a second. “I can’t say I’ve never been tempted to fake something like this to get Gabe off my back. I never actually
“Bobby, you watching old soap opera tapes again?” he asked, raising his voice to be heard over the song.  The collection of scavenged soaps and reality TV show recordings was a poorly kept secret among those who’d ever dropped in on the man unexpectedly.
“Do you think I don’t know about stretched resources?” Castiel interrupted, tired of being courteous. “I work in a public library. Our budget goes on the government chopping block so often that I’ve been on a first-name basis with every city administrator for the last twelve years. People I meet at parties begin conversations by asking me to defend the relevance of my vocation as a worthy use of their tax dollars. Don’t patronize me.”
“God, of course!” Sam said hastily. “We should talk about this face to face, anyway, not over the phone. Maybe we can get lunch tomorrow or the next day? My treat, anywhere you like.”
You really had to give the guy credit, Dean mused. If you hadn’t spent years with Castiel, observing the tiny tells he showed when he was hiding something, you would never have been able to tell just how terrified he was in that moment. Eyes just a hair too wide, shoulders held a touch too high, and hands twitching like they needed a weapon, Castiel sat up in the bed. He kept his eyes focused on the far wall, refusing stubbornly to meet Dean’s gaze. In his plain white hospital scrubs, no trench coat or jacket and tie to bolster him, he looked much smaller and more vulnerable.
They’d flushed his system so thoroughly that Dean suspected his kidneys were clean enough to sparkle, and they’d kept him happily topped up with pain medication to let him shift in his bed without wanting to scream. Days later, when his fever was finally under control and the doctors were confident that the bite was beginning to heal, they’d let him go home, sternly warned to continue daily wound care treatment if he didn’t want to wind up needing a skin graft.
“Holy fuck,” Dean swore, eyes glued to the yellowed paper being held in Castiel’s white-gloved hands, displayed in grainy resolution over the webcam. “Just…Jesus. Wow.”
Dean’s pencil ripped through the paper as he finished writing his last reason, and the point broke, leaving small graphite smears around the tear. All right, perhaps he was feeling a little dejected, but at least he was aware of it and trying to do something about it.
The man studied Dean’s face. “You want my van hidden, so nobody knows I’m here,” he said. “For an appointment in the middle of the night. And it’s a ‘serious matter.’” The actual air quotes the man placed around the phrase were unexpectedly awkward, and Dean might have snickered if the guy hadn’t looked so irritated about the situation.
As far as first kisses went, this one was definitely on the rougher end of the spectrum. Every bit of the frustration, confusion, aggravation, and impatience of the evening was poured into it, and as soon as Dean realized exactly what was happening, if not why, he did his best to give as good as he was getting. That was no easy feat, though, because Castiel was an all-consuming frenzy, dedicated to covering every inch of Dean’s skin he could reach with wet, trailing,
“A utility knife would be more efficient, and I have plenty of tools in the van,” Castiel said, the corners of his lips twitching, and Dean felt like slapping himself. This was the man’s
man was more than just a magically animated version of the person whose image he’d cultivated in his imagination. He was a living, breathing human, and it wouldn’t be right to entertain
“It’s not drugs,” Dean said, almost wishing it was. Pulling the cabinet open wide, he stared dumbfounded at the metal door hidden beneath. Castiel sucked in a sharp gasp. “It’s the fucking breaker box. I knew there was a second one, but…”
Dean, without the slightest trace of sympathy, burst into raucous laughter. “Hell, yeah, you did!” he crowed. Castiel buried his face in his hands, groaning. He actually wished he’d stumbled across something truly personal and mortifying in Dean’s journals, suddenly feeling far less guilt about having gone through them.
“I was fine! It was only a little twisted until you guys broke in, making a racket that sounded like an army of undead attacking. I fell on it trying to get away! And I’m not a kid,” Claire added, thumping Sam’s back with her fist.
Dean was all about that idea, and even more on board when he found himself kneeling nearly shoulder to shoulder with Castiel as they worked to tape the outline of the wood section to be removed. The heat from Castiel’s arm radiated outward against Dean’s, and he had to suppress the impulse to lean into the warmth. “Here, you work the saw,” Castiel said, offering the circular saw to him. When Dean hesitated, more because he’d been so distracted than out of any reluctance to take over, Castiel rolled his eyes and gently reached for Dean’s hand. “Here, just hold it like this. You won’t ruin anything, I promise.”
“Well, speaking of that,” Dean started, trying his best to sound less demanding, “I wanted to request permission and support in finding someone. Not someone missing from before,” he quickly added, seeing her immediate negative reaction. “This is somebody I
The Entity, unperturbed by the threat, began walking toward him, putting an unnecessary amount of sway in its hips. Dean rolled his eyes and pointedly refused to look. “Mmm, but you never were a ‘good morning kiss’ type of man, were you?” it purred. “At least, not for poor Castiel. Poor, loyal-to-the-end Castiel.”
“No,” Castiel said, because that wasn’t at all what he meant. He squinted, staring off toward where he could hear the fight coming to its conclusion. “I mean…you’re supposed to try to escape, to find the way out. I was the one trying to protect you by running. I’m supposed to run.”
“What I understand is that you guys have no idea what to do, and I don’t want anyone to start thinking that ‘new’ is the same thing as ‘dangerous,’ and using that to excuse doing something stupid.”
The fact of the matter was that John Winchester had been many things, but “paranoid sonovabitch” ranked pretty damn high on the list, especially in his later years. In retrospect, some of his crazier rantings about being prepared for “Shit Hits The Fan” scenarios hadn’t been quite so crazy. Dean was pretty sure that if he had lived to see the dead walking, Dad would have relished giving the biggest, most smug “I told you so” speech in history, right before he reached for one of the many weapons he’d stashed wherever he thought he might possibly need one and jumping right into the fray with a righteous shout.
gimmicky and obtuse! Personally, I think he just struggles to identify with anything not written in first-person perspective.”
“Sixteen more this time,” Castiel said as he came through the door. “At least they’re mostly graphic novels, and on the thinner side. I should be able to get through them pretty quickly.”
Dean gazed at him through narrowed eyes, then exhaled hard before rolling to the side and wrapping an arm around his waist. “Yeah, I know.”
Castiel lifted an eyebrow, apparently trying to gauge whether or not Dean was being serious. “I was only joking, Dean,” he said. “You’re not actually loud enough to warrant whole-house soundproofing. Well, at least not from sex that meets most societal norms. Should I be more concerned about your handcuffs comment? Did we enlarge your closet so you’d have room for a collection of whips and chains?”
The reason he was studying history in the first place was rooted in memories of how his grandparents and great-grandparents would tell all these crazy stories—their own stories, about their own lives, but they were wrapped up in the bigger picture of what was happening in the world, giving context and meaning to stuff he’d otherwise just read about in stale textbooks. History didn’t have to be viewed that way; it
“Guess again,” said Jimmy, who’d managed to convince Claire to let him feel around the toe of the sneaker. “Growth spurt?”
Castiel blinked, squinting. Though the damage was healing, he still seemed weakened and sluggish. “Dean?” he asked in a small voice, mistrust warring with confusion and the tiniest thread of hope. “You’re…in Heaven?”
“Yeah, well,” Dean said, deciding he could explore whatever that was about after more important things were handled. “This happens to be a serious matter. I told the guy on the phone that I needed this to be discreet. A giant white van with glowing wings is the opposite of discreet. That’s why I wanted you to pull around back.”
“I could be interested,” Castiel said, taking the book into his own lap. Someone snorted. Without looking up, Castiel flipped his middle finger in the general direction of the sound. “I meant in general, not just about Dean’s underwear.”
“That’s okay. The associate dean cheats, too, but she’s excellent at it. And the rest of the faculty knows it, too, but they’re all too afraid of her to say anything. Remember her, the dark-haired woman I introduced you to? Weird tribal tattoo on the side of her chest?”
“Everything we could grab that hadn’t been looted already,” Dean said, sighing. “Probably a few thousand feet of Romex wire, too. Charlie better be satisfied. Nothing says ‘thank you’ like a shoulder massage, I hear.”
“Here,” Castiel said, wiping his eyes and passing Dean a bottle. “Open another one. There, that one looks safe.” It was a book—a thick, heavy volume titled
“Nobody’s making you go anywhere,” Dean cut in. He was standing now, his whole posture just shy of aggressive as he stared down Tessa.
“Aren’t you supposed to, like, hang a newspaper on your wall, or somethin’? Give your eyes a rest by focusing on that every so often? I think I read that somewhere,” Benny said from the other side of the bar, where he was polishing mugs that didn’t need polishing. It was a slow night at The Roadhouse, so Benny had plenty of time to sit and listen to Dean whine. Not that he was whining, Dean justified to himself; he was merely
A bright smile on his face, Jack disappears before Five’s even left and appears on top of the boy, sending both ageless kids tumbling to the ground, giggling.
Thank you to everyone that commented—I had fun reading them all even if I didn't respond to them (though I did try to respond to them all). Anyways, hope you enjoy this chapter, as always, please leave a comment!
“What? Yeah, totally.” Dean sits up and untangles the blanket from his legs. “Just startled after falling, is all.”
“So what do you think?” Jo asks, leaning into Dean’s shoulder to mutter without being overhead. She keeps a fake smile on her face as people congratulate them.
But he can’t do that because Bobby stopped all his alcohol shipments. There’s nothing in John’s house because he’s literally never here anymore. Wherever he hangs out now is where he must stash his booze.
“Castiel,” Dad said, every bit as formal as ever, even as he raised his voice slightly to be heard over the rising clamor. He hadn’t paused in his whatever he was doing; he’d barely looked up at Castiel’s arrival, glancing toward the door just long enough to identify who had entered. “Good, you’re here.”
The reminder of Sam and the current situation with him washed over Dean like a bucket of ice water. “Yeah, we do,” he said shortly. “Hey, I’m gonna go check out the wiring progress in the attic. Don’t go trying to break any more toes while I’m gone.”
“This isn’t the way this is supposed to happen,” Castiel interrupted, cutting off whatever Dean was saying, with a sudden declaration of a thought that had struck him like a bolt from the heavens. He somehow knew in his gut that he was telling the truth, though he had no idea how. “I can’t remember much, but I’m sure of that. This isn’t right.”
“I’m not sure that’s in the cards at the moment,” Castiel interjected, giving Dean another apologetic look. “The electrical system in the house is rather old. Adding more circuits is a lower priority right now than bringing the existing ones up to code.”
People were milling in and out of the house, with music following on both indoor and outdoor speakers. The outdoor sound system was built into a pergola that formed the center of the large modified-wood deck wrapping around two sides of the house. Wide steps led downward from the deck onto a smaller patio, where Dean was currently manning the grill.
“Mmm, sounds great,” Dean said with unconvincing enthusiasm, torn between his solid respect for his sister-in-law and his urge to make one of his usual jabs about the disgusting amount of health food consumed at their home. “I already grabbed a quick dinner on campus, though.”
With Dean’s finger still pressed to his lips, Castiel smiled slowly, widening as his eyes started to glisten with emotion. He nodded, not dislodging Dean’s hand. Then he threw himself forward at Dean, flinging his arms around him tightly. The group close by to them made awww-ing sounds at the sight, while those in the rear who hadn’t been able to hear the murmured discussion clamored for explanations.
“I did try,” Castiel said sadly. “How could I not, when it was literally the last thing Dad asked me to do? But by the time I got myself pulled together and into the Jeep, feeling like maybe I wouldn’t immediately crash into a utility pole when I tried to drive, the main road was completely blocked. We lived about twenty miles away from the base, but I could barely make it past the outskirts of the town, between the car pileups and the riots and the roaming undead. Not to mention the Army, who gave up trying to arrest everybody when that plan turned out to be impossible, so they were just trying to set up roadblocks as though everybody would just turn around and go back home.”
“Cuevas and Walker, you go with Castiel,” she said, naming off two of the three remaining men in fatigues. Castiel stared at her, unimpressed at the blatant weighting of the teams, but she was unmoved. “Misters Winchester, you two go with him as well, and you, Miss Masters. The rest of you are with me.”
Dean had never really gotten the full picture of everything that had gone down, all those years ago, from the point when he and Sam had found Jimmy Novak reeling from Castiel’s abrupt departure up until that pivotal moment in the beautiful room in Van Nuys, when he’d stared into Castiel’s eyes and watched the angel’s world tilt on its axis as he’d finally chosen to break with Heaven.
” Without thought, Castiel threw out his hand and pushed at Dean, shoving him away in a panic. The muscles of Dean’s chest felt solid and heated under Castiel’s palm, and the coherent part of his brain was surprised to see the way Dean flinched sharply and grunted at the rough contact.
“Anything.” He sincerely doubted that whatever Dean was considering would rise to the level of any of his personal limits. “We will, naturally, have to make sure that when we are collecting Benton’s things, we also include as many of the lab’s packages of petroleum jelly as we can find.”
“I never talked to your brother about my ‘intentions,’” Castiel said, rolling his eyes. “We never had any combined gatherings, letting your family get to know mine ahead of our mating.”
Dean shrugged. “That, and…” He didn’t know how to say what he wanted. Not being face-to-face made it so much harder to read body language, to get an idea of how this would be received. “I just…”
Amelia was silent for long enough that Dean turned to look at her. She was studying him with a fond expression. “Doesn’t have to be much of a difference at all,” she said. “It’s kind of the whole point, more than just sparkly trinkets or expensive jewelry. They’re ways to show the other person that you’re thinking about them, and that you want to be the one to make them happy.”
“Dean! Shit, let me see.” Castiel was right beside him in a heartbeat, grabbing for Dean’s wrist and pulling it away from where he’d cradled it to his chest. He inhaled sharply through his nose when he saw the depth and size of the wound, and Dean wondered, distantly, if he should be panicking. The painful throbbing was doing a damned good job keeping him present in the moment, though. “I don’t think it’s as bad as it could have been, but we have to get you cleaned up so I can tell if we need to get you to the hospital for stitches.”
“I mean,” said Castiel impatiently, “that I am the one who sent them. I presume that you are the complete assbutt who’s been playing practical jokes on a complete stranger, then?”
For a moment, it looked as though Naomi was about to lash out in anger. Her eyes narrowed, and her nostrils flared. Then, after a deep breath, she lifted her chin and held it high. “If you’re not back in fifteen minutes…”
“So did he tell you to head in?” Castiel demanded. “Did he say what’s going on? Naomi’s CO already called her—I think she’s probably already throwing her bag together to head back to Riley, if she didn’t already leave. Dad, are we safe here? I mean, those shots earlier—that was close. What—”
“So that’s a no,” Dean said, rolling his eyes. “Okay, fine, but this thing literally popped up out of nowhere, and I’m pretty sure Purgatory didn’t institute a welcome basket policy. If you didn’t make it or summon it here, then…”
Balthazar clucked his tongue. “Please don’t do it on my bar stool. The insurance paperwork, you understand.”
Sam was striding toward a gap in the fence, heading for a couple of horses that stood apart from the others. “I think a couple of these guys are a little small for me,” he said over his shoulder. “Probably they’re still young. I’m thinking maybe one of the big brown ones would do, though.”
“It was more than the pictures, Dean,” Castiel confessed. He couldn’t maintain eye contact for this; dropping his gaze to his hands, which were twisted in the bed sheets, he went on. “I found some of the things you wrote, too. Old notebooks and such.”
Twenty minutes later, he passionately regretted his overconfidence. Spitting a mouthful of dirt onto the ground, Dean scowled venomously at his brother, who was almost rolling on the ground with his laughter.
The brothers were quiet as they walked back to the dorms, each caught in his own thoughts. When they reached the building, Dean headed for his room and Sam followed, closing the door behind him. Dean dropped onto his bed, sitting with his elbows braced against his knees as he stared at the floor.
Now that he had been given a bit more information about where this place was, along with the sorts of dangers he’d need to navigate, Dean moved more cautiously in his search for Castiel. He’d never needed to give much thought to the physical size of a dream before. Had the question been put to him, he would have hazarded a guess that the edges of a dream would probably only extend to the area within sight of the dreamer. If he was dreaming about lying in bed, after all, why would his brain cook up a basement? Seemed like that’d be a waste of brain space, Dean felt. He guessed now, as he crept along as quietly as he could manage, that he’d found yet another way in which angel dreams were different from human ones, because this place was
“I’m not an idiot,” Dean said. An aching twinge in the side of his jaw reminded him to stop clenching it, and he took a deep breath to clear his frustration.
“Gee, I wish I had a big brother like you.” Meg’s sarcastic remark sounded particularly derisive this time, but she grabbed her bag and sauntered out before he could reply.
Castiel’s knowing smirk had Dean momentarily forgetting the dull ache in his knees and palms. “If you’d like, since I have the saw out from dismantling the drywall, we can go ahead and cut out the damaged wood. That way, Benjamin can bring in the new wood tomorrow when he brings over the roof flashing, and we can get this out of the way quickly.”
Castiel kissed with the same passion that he made music, all-consuming and unafraid. The heat of his mouth, the intoxicating natural scent of the oils in his skin, and the relentless hold of those powerful hands in his hair and around the small of his back overwhelmed Dean, destroyed and rebuilt and then took him to pieces again. He never wanted to stop kissing Castiel. He parted his lips against Castiel’s, an unspoken invitation that was immediately accepted with a deep, vibrating groan and the slide of tongue against tongue.
But Dean also can't seem to look him in the eye and Cas really wants to know what is going through his head. He doesn't ask though.
“And you know Dean, he is like a mother duck with his baby ducklings. I think if Jo and me had't talked him out of it he would have slept in your room to keep an eye on you. He didn't even go to work on Saturday although there was an emergency in the workshop. He said to Bobby that he couldn't leave in case there was an emergency with you.“
So he had surpressed every inappropriate thought since then and apparently he did it so well that he hadn't even realized his crush had already developed into something more.
He doesn't know if he can survive like this. Living with Dean was nice until this point, but now he feels like he's touching live wire all the time and his sleep-deprived state doesn't help.
“Yeah, I have to finish this paper until next Friday and ... it's a lot. But I'll manage.“ Cas gives Dean a half smile but he doesn't seem convinced.
He startles when the door to Dean's room suddenly opens and his roommate walks out in pajamas, rubbing his eyes.
He proceeds to fill the table with food: toast, jam, honey, fresh fruit. Everything Cas loves to eat for breakfast. Cas realizes how hungry he is and he takes a slice of toast, his worry about his paper temporarily forgotten.
He waits for Dean to say something but he just stares at him. The tension between them fills the air and makes it hard for Castiel to think.
Dean hums a melody while he's putting the plates in the dishwasher and Cas tries to calm himself down. He gets up and his eyes fall on his laptop and notes on the table.
His phone buzzes but he ignores it. He pinches the bridge of his nose and tries to concentrate again. Breathe in, breathe out. And continue.
Cas was the one who was looking for a new roommate and Dean was by far the best choice. His brother Sam knew Cas from college and told Dean about the free room. Cas was happy to help because he liked Sam but he would have chosen Dean over everyone else anyway.
“I feel like that's my problem. I worry too much. About everything. And everyone. And I often wanna … save people, I guess. Or at least help them. But I realized that sometimes it's not my place to do something, you know? Sometimes people just have to make their own decisions.“
“I think I'm just gonna go to the library to return my books“, he says and gets up, when his world is suddenly shifted sideways.
He fully realizes that Dean stayed home and took care of him, that he brougt him soup and took his temperature and returned his books and was just there for him. He doesn't know what to do with that information because is that a thing that friends do for each other?
Cas is suddenly hit with a wave of affection that almost aches in his chest. He tries to keep his cool but it's suddenly all to much.
And he needs the space for his work – as an architecture major he needs to be able to draw on paper as well as working on his computer.
He takes a shower and feels miles better afterwards. His body is still weak though, and even drying his hair with a towel is an exhausting task.
Cas can't help but smile. He turns around to look at Dean who is standing next to the kitchen sink, his hands fiddling with the label of a beer bottle.
He gives him a quick wave and disappears into his bedroom. Cas watches the closed door for a moment, then sighs and goes back to work.
“Well done, buddy! Now what? Party?“, he asks with a grin, well aware that partying is the last thing Cas wants to do now.
He feels Dean's body tremble as he lets out a shaky laugh. “You're cute“, Dean mumbles and Cas blushes even harder.
He picks at his food again and rolls his eyes slightly when he notices that Cas is still looking at him.
Sure, he still doesn't know how to deal with the fact that he has a crush on his roommate. But he will deal with this later. After the deadline, when he's not a sleep-deprived zombie anymore.
Cas grabs his laptop and opens it. He logs in, checks his emails and his heart beats a bit faster when he there is already an email from his professor in his inbox.
“What would I do without you“, Cas says or thinks. He doesn't even know anymore. He finally falls asleep.
“Just glad you're here“, he says and smiles. He feels himself drifting into sleep and almost wants to cry because he is so relieved.
Cas reluctantly tears his eyes away from the stove and is greeted with Dean looking at him with raised eyebrows and a stunned expression.
Cas feels his skin practically vibrating and nothing matters expect Dean kissing him, Dean being so close, finally.
Thankfully, his phone rings in this exact moment. He picks it up and is greeted with Charlie's cheery voice.
He doesn't understand how it happened but he is suddenly in Dean's arms. Not in a romantic way, but clumsily holding on for dear life.
“Yeah, I don't know. When me and Sam were younger, I wanted him to have a great future. A good life. And I might have pushed him too hard, thinking I knew what was best for him. But I didn't even ask what he wanted. So he was kinda mad at me for a while.“
He has no idea what day it is and he looks around for his phone. When he sees it on his nightstand he unlocks his screen and his clock tells him it's 11am. On Monday.
Cas is stunned by this speech and something in his mind clicks into place. A puzzle piece that makes the image he has of Dean more complete.
“Of course, we met last year on Dean's birthday and I sometimes help her with the IT stuff for the Roadhouse. Anyway, we have a groupchat and I thought you were on the verge of death because Dean was texting, like, constantly. I even know what kind of soup he made you on Saturday.“
Dean smiles sadly. “Yeah. It is. But I was scared I ruined our relationship because I was so controlling.“
While Dean is at work, Cas tries to focus on his paper again and curses his brain for every unvoluntary thought about Dean that crosses his mind.
So his natural reaction is to flee. “Uhm, sure. You're right. I'll just … clean up my room“, he says, stands up and hastily walks to his room, leaving a confused Dean behind.
The first day they met, Cas knew it wouldn't be easy to live with Dean and not develop a crush. His eyes were so fucking green, his smile bright and charming, his handshake firm.
Dean reaches out to him and lays a hand on Cas' forehead. Then he suddenly looks like he got caught doing something forbidden and quickly pulls his hand back.
Cas is still confused but he doesn't say anything. He knows how much Dean loves his job and he would think that even if Bobby told Dean to stay at home he would still go to the workshop just to be there.
On Wednesday, he feels like he is losing his mind, but he's too tired to actually care. He is sitting at the dining table, the book he is reading blurring in front of his eyes.
The next morning is awkward. Cas makes coffee and offers Dean some. Dean accepts it and sits on the couch, sipping from his cup.
Dean sighs. “She is. But she's also ... I don't know, I've know her for so long, for me she's still just a kid. And … I know she's a grown up, but I worry about her.“
“It's my way of saying thank you. For being here while I was sick“, he says while watching the stove.
Dean's laughter fills the air and Cas can't help but smile too. He flips one pancake onto a plate and pours new batter into the pan.
Dean is holding his face, their chests are pressed together and Cas' mind is silent for the first time in a long time.
Dean turns on the TV and the next hour Cas is working while his background noise is people talking, fighting, music playing and occasionally Dean laughing.
“Well, goodnight then“, he says with one last look at Castiel before he closes his bedroom door behind him.
He understands why Dean is worried: Jo is still young and owning a business is nothing that comes easy or without putting a lot of work into it.
Dean peeks his head into his room and smiles at him. Castiel's stomach drops and he feels like he's on a rollercoaster.
Cas started working in the living room at the dining table a while ago because his room is as small as a shoebox and the light in it is terrible.
He gets up and puts on a new shirt and sweatpants. When he makes his way into the living room he sees Dean cleaning the kitchen.
They eat in silence for a moment before Dean says: “Maybe you should rest for at least one more day, you know, to fully recover.“
Cas nods. He knows Jo, Dean's childhood friend, a blonde and fierce woman who can even drink Cas under the table. Cas likes her.
He would forget to eat if Dean wouldn't bring him snacks and take out every day. He is grateful to have him and feels a bit guilty because Dean shouldn't be responsible for Cas' eating habits.
“Cas ... I don't want to meddle with Dean's love life or anything but I know how he can be. So I thought I'll try and give it a push in the right direction.“
Dean smiles at him and Cas' chest tightens. He blushes and leans forward to hide his face in the crook of Dean's neck.
His roommate Dean was okay with Cas using the living room as his work place. He prefers eating on the couch anyway and with his work as a mechanic he doesn't really need a work place at home.
His roommate is quitely singing “Fairies Wear Boots“ while he wipes down the counter. He flinches when he notices Cas standing there.
At one point his mind clears up a little bit and he recognizes his bed and his room. He's sweating and feels cold at the same time.
This realization makes his head spin and he fears he might say something impulsive, so he quickly stuffs his mouth with food again.
Cas resumes typing on his laptop, trying to bundle his last energy to wrap up this goddamn paper. The end is in sight and he feels like he is dragging himself to the finishline.
“Why are you telling me this?“, Cas asks quietly. His mind is racing and he feels their conversation steering onto something real and frightening.
Dean takes the thermometer from the nightstand and holds it in front of Castiel's face. Cas doesn't even think about it, he just opens his mouth and Dean gently puts the tip of the thermometer under his tongue.
The thermometer beeps and Dean takes it out of Cas' mouth. He looks at it and this time his smile is genuine.
Cas really wants to go back to work but his head is swimming and maybe, maybe he needs a little break. And doing something with Dean is always a very tempting alternative.
“Sorry, Cas. It's probably not funny, you were really sick. I just think...“ Her tone suddenly shifts and her next words are sincere and almost urging.
Castiel pulls back, already panicking. But Dean's face stops him in his tracks: He has his eyes closed and the look on him can only be described as heavenly bliss.
Things are happening, but they're stitched together like an old carpet. Cas doesn't have fever dreams anymore but sometimes he still can't grasp if he's awake or asleep.
“If you want to make sure that you're not crossing any lines, you can always ask, I think. Just offer your help and if Jo wants to take it, she can. If not, you should let her do her thing. You've known her for so long, I think you can trust each other on that.“
Cas wants to say more, wants to make sure that Dean knows that he's not controlling or pushy or too considerate but his voice is stuck in his throat.
Dean usually comes back in the late afternoon and they often watch a movie together or just talk about their day. It's nice and Castiel enjoys their shared life.
Then one moment he is suddenly awake and his head feels a bit clearer than before. He rolls around and blinks into the brightness of his room.
Dean takes a sip from his coffee. “I, uhm. I actually returned your books already. I didn't know when they were due, so I thought...“
He grabs some fries from the bag and shoves them into his mouth hungrily while he tries to focus again on the work in front of him.
Cas' eyes fall on his laptop, books and notes that are still on the dining table. They're in neat piles so apparently Dean had cleared them up while Cas was asleep.
Dean starts talking about his day, how he met Charlie after work and that she and Ash were planning to hack some top secret servers of some law firm. Cas finds himself relaxing and listening carefully.
Dean hums and stretches a bit. Cas forbids his eyes to wander where Dean's shirt is rising up and shows his soft belly.
Dean raises his eyebrows and looks at the dining table, where Cas' notes, books, pens and folders are scattered everywhere.
He opens his mouth and can taste Dean's tongue on his lips. A groan escapes him and he settles his hand on Dean's hips, trying to get him even closer.
“That's probably because I am tired.“ The senctence comes out more exasperated than he had intended.
They sit down on the sofa and Cas expects Dean to turn on the TV but instead they start eating in silence.
All his working at night paid off: He writes the last sentence of his conclusion and lets out a breath. Now he only has to read through it to correct the mistakes and then he can send it to his professor.
And then there's Dean, right next to his bed as if he just came down from heaven. Dean looks at him and Cas tries to smile and say hello but he can only get out a pathetic croak.
“I'm just saying, he told me that he saw you working so hard and he was worried but he didn't want to tell you anything because he was afraid to cross some lines. I think he's not sure if he's in a position to say something about it, you know?“
“I'm sorry, I think I already said enough. Just … talk to him, okay? Like, really talk to him.“ She sounds like she's smiling.
When he takes a break to make himself another pot of coffee, he suddenly feels dizzy and has to hold onto the kitchen counter to not fall over.
He can't see for a second, everything is black, he just feels that he is stumbling, falling, into nothingness -
So while he's carefully reading a recipe and weighing he exact amount of flour and sugar and milk he needs, he doesn't think about Dean maybe liking him. He also doesn't think about the possibility of him just being very friendly and caring and Charlie misunderstanding everything. And he definitely doesn't think about the fact that he should probably confront all of this to find out.
The exhaustion is still sitting in his bones, gnawing at his skin. His hair is sticky and gross and he just wants to take a shower. His back hurts. He's hungry and thirsty.
“Hey, no working during breakfast“, Dean says, comes up from behind him and shuts his laptop shut. Cas wants to protest but is quickly silenced when Dean puts down a cup of coffee right in front of him.
They've been living in this apartment for seven months now and settled into a comfortable routine with each other. Dean is out and about more than Castiel who prefers to work at home in silence when he doesn't have class.
A while later Dean announces that dinner is ready and Cas doesn't even try to argue his way into eating while working. He just saves his document, closes his laptop and joins Dean at the oven to put the casserole onto plates.
Dean's stories are always energetic, he gesticulates a lot and sometimes has to take a pause because he's so laughing so hard. Cas finds it utterly endearing.
His laugh, his hands, his giddy excitement about nerd stuff, the way he hums when he cooks, how he always asks Cas how his day was, his bowlegs, the way he licks his lips when he concentrates on something ...
First, Cas thinks it's just him, but he soon realizes that they're both dancing around each other. There's a nervous tension in the air and Cas is not sure why.
They make it to Cas' room and while Cas mumbles under his breath that he can walk alone and doesn't need help, Dean still doesn't leave his side.
Cas feels the air leaving his body like a deflating balloon. He goes to his room and flops down onto his mattress.
“Jo is smart. And stubborn. I think she will manage“, Cas says to reassure him. The last time he saw Jo, she beat Dean in an armwrestling match so it's hard to imagine her getting defeated by anything.
Cas has to pull himself together to not drop his plate. He gives Dean a quick smile and hopes his face isn't red.
Cas is busy with keeping his breath steady and not daydreaming about Dean while he's sitting right next to him.
Dean comes closer and helps him so Cas can sits up. He puts a glass of water and a pill in his hand and says “Take this.“
Cas also knows about the Roadhouse and how Jo took on the ownership of the bar after Ellen broke her hip and couldn't work anymore, at least not fulltime.
Cas needs a moment to take that in. Of course he knew Dean is a caring person. The way he talks about his friends, the fact that he's always happy to help other people when they need him. And also by living with Dean he sees all the little things that show his attentiveness: how he always makes sure that there is enough honey in the house because he knows Cas likes it. How he always asks Cas what movie he wants to watch although Cas knows how picky Dean can be when it comes to cinema. How he always cooks for Cas …
The last days were such a blur that he didn't have to think about it but now that he is fully awake again he can't deny the truth anymore: He is in love with Dean. Probably has been for a long time.
Cas is making pancakes. Again, it was something to do to keep himself busy because his thoughts threatened to drive him insane.
He tries to think about something else, but Dean is the one thing that comes back to his mind again and again.
They forget about the pancakes and about everything else. It's just the two of them, without a care in the world.
And yes, of course he thought Dean was hot. But he didn't want to be that asshole that ruined a perfectly fine, platonic roommate relationship just because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
Cas' mind doesn't stop and he falls into an uneasy sleep thinking about Dean's smell, so close to him.
Dean breaks the tension hanging in the air (and again: is this just coming from Castiel or from both of them? Is he imagining things?) by turning on the TV.
He's torn between two emotions: happiness because Dean was so kind to him, and agony because he doesn't know if his romantic feelings are reciprocated.
He slowly opens his eyes and Cas only manages to hoarsely say “Dean“ before he gets pulled back in. Dean is gripping the front of his shirt and is kissing him again and Cas is afraid his knees might give way.
The room is spinning, but this time in a good way. Dean's mouth is so soft and Cas never wants this moment to end.
Scenes blend into each other like he's rapidly changing TV channels: a bird brawling outside of his window and startling him; Cas going to the bathroom and taking a piss – he later doesn't remember how he got out of bed or back into his room; Dean sitting next to him and feeding him soup; Cas kicking his blanket off because it's too hot, too confining, too heavy; later feeling the blanket getting draped over him again; Dean talking to someone on the phone in the living room; Cas tossing and turning and falling asleep again.
He can't believe it. He is stressed enough already, he doesn't want to also have to deal with the fact that he's in lo-
He waves goodbye and closes the door behind him. Cas falls back onto his bed and stares at the ceiling.
Cas sits with his back to the kitchen counter and the soft noises behind him – the cutting of vegetables, the occasional rushing of the faucet, the clicking of the stove – calm him down.
Cas cocks his head to the side and wants to say something when Dean continues: “I talked to Jo today.“
His bed moves slightly as Dean gets up and Cas thinks he's leaving him to rest, but only a moment later he hears footsteps approaching again and a small noise when Dean sets down a glass of water on Cas' nightstand.
Dean's eyes are wide and he puts his hand on Cas' forehead. Cas closes his eyes, enjoying the gentle touch despite his current state.
Cas mind is racing now. Does Dean want him to follow him? When he said 'Let's go to bed', did he mean together? Did he notice how Cas reacted to him being so close? Does he think -
He doesn't even know what time it is. A quick look at the watch tells him it's almost 3 am. Cas gets up and makes himself another cup of coffee.
His tone is casual but they way he holds his head and the fact that he doesn't directly look at Dean indicates that he's carefully selecting his words.
Cas looks over his shoulder and sees Dean leaning at the dining table. He gives him a dirty look. “I'm just saying, you had every right to be worried. I'm not very good with selfcare.“
It's short and sweet and as wonderful as he has dreamed of but Dean isn't moving and suddenly Cas is afraid he got it all wrong.
He sees weird shapes and people he doesn't know in his room and then suddenly he's not even in his room anymore.
Cas feels like an idiot and tries to distract himself from his own thoughts by actually cleaning up his room.
And he knows that Dean likes him too, as a friend, as a rommate. He knows that Dean cares so much for the people that are important to him – and knowing he is one of them truly makes his heart flutter.
Dean is stirring in his sleep, his hand resting on his thigh clenching and unclenching. The urge to take his hand comes to suddenly and is so strong that Cas has to ball his own hands into fists.
He meets his eyes and yes, there it is: Dean gets even more flustered, looking from his eyes to his lips. Cas' heart begins to stutter and the feeling of hope he felt in his stomach since the phone call with Charlie grows.
“Dude, you're burning up“, Dean mumbles. He sounds so worried that Cas opens his eyes again. Dean's face is so close that he can count his freckles.
He clicks on it and deflates slightly when it's only a confirmation that his paper arrived and is being graded now. Cas hates the nervous waiting every time.
“I brought food“, Dean says, still smiling. Cas looks into the paper bags and his stomach reminds him how hungry he actually is when he sees burgers and fries in there, the wonderful smell of the fast food filling his nose.
Cas is looking at his screen, his eyes burning. He sees the words and numbers and shapes in front of him but his brain doesn't cooperate and he doesn't understand anything he is looking at.
With an enormous effort he finally – finally! - finishes his readthrough. He leans back and stares at his screen. He's done it. He is actually done.
It's Friday. Finally. Cas feels relieved and at the same time anxiety and stress is burning in his gut and his throat feels so tight that he think he might choke. He still feels dizzy.
Cas tries not to be startled by the way Dean looks at him. His eyes are so green and he always gives him his full attention which Castiel finds quite unnerving. He is still not used to be listened to with that kind of intensity.
Cas nods and checks one last time if his paper is ready to be sent off. While he types a short email for this professor and attaches his paper as a pdf, Dean gets up and joins him at the dinner table.
It wasn't his intention but by the end of the week it has become a habit that he works through the nights. Well, not entirely: He stays up until 5am until he's so tired he can't even keep his eyes open anymore. He then goes to bed, sleeps until 8am and gets up again.
“Hey Cas“, Dean says, putting the bags on the table and on top of Cas' paperwork, which he hurriedly shoves to the side.
There is something lurking in the back of his mind, waiting to jump out at him, but he is still so tired. So pushes everything back, just thinks about Dean's hand on his skin and closes his eyes.
He learns forward, he feels Dean's breath on his lips, he thinks for a second 'This is the last chance to stop. There is no coming back from this.'
Silence fills the air. Cas feels his heart beating in his chest. He's so nervous that his hands are trembling. He knows he needs to say something, but he doesn't even know where to start.
As he takes a moment to look up from his screen he notices Dean watching him. Dean quickly averts his eyes but Cas can't help but notice him blushing slightly.
He gets the strange feeling that Dean is keeping him company to keep an eye on him. After their talk yesterday he can't help but wonder if this is about Dean worrying about Cas.
There are a million thoughts in his head but one question is the loudest, the most important and the one Castiel is most afraid to know the answer to:
Cas is afraid to open his eyes, to shatter that fragile moment between them. He feels Dean gently stroking his cheek and after a second he meets his gaze.
Cas is surprised how well he can work during this. He always thought he needed absolute silence, but Dean's audible presence is calming him down and is making it easier to not overthink what he is working on.
He is almost done. He can feel the exhaustion in his bones, his eyes are hurting, his hands are trembling, but he is almost done.
He clears his throat and walks towards his room. Right in front of his door, he stops and looks at Castiel who is still rooted next to the sofa.
“You can tell when I’ve been working out?” he asked, thinking of all the evenings he’d trudged into the house on tired legs but feeling somehow rejuvenated in spite of the muscle soreness. Had Castiel really noticed a difference? Had he been watching Dean closely enough to note the connection? He felt himself blush at the idea, and he hoped the bar was dim enough that nobody could tell.
be viewed that way, he decided, and so here he was, chasing a dream in which he could capture other people’s crazy stories in history texts that might actually mean something to bored teenagers.
Dean peered into the deeper blackness as the named soldier pulled one of the unbarred doors outward, trying to force his eyes to adjust more quickly. The flashlights’ beams were feeble things that left a lot of dark places to be filled by morbid imagination, but there was no hint of movement, not a single bit of noise.
Sam was going to laugh his ass off at how badly Dean had screwed himself. No, he wouldn’t; he’d be all
“Major Novak said regroup in the basement,” the remaining soldier protested, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
Turning back toward the lake, Dean contemplated his mate; the water wars had reached some sort of truce, and now the twins were floating lazily as they chatted and caught their breath. “In that case, though, what’s the difference between all the formal courting bullshi--uh, nonsense, I mean, and just regular little things you give somebody because you want to make them happy and spend more time with them?”
Castiel, without thought, reached out a hand blindly, making contact in the direction from which the voice had come. Immediately, his hand was grasped and held tightly. “I tried to get to him, but I just—the horse was going
As they’d moved, the sound of improvised guitar strumming in the background had become harder to hear, fading in and out behind crackles and small bursts of static. With a stab of regret, Dean thumbed the dial on his transmitter, adjusting it minutely so that Naomi’s lecture became a touch more distinct. “—keeping in mind that precision in our time tables is crucial, so that we can ensure the safety of all residents of New Lebanon.”
“Burgers and fries,” Dean confirmed. “And Ellen threw in some pie, but she says it’s in exchange for a jar of the tomatoes you told her you canned from our plants this summer. Since when do the two of you chat about cooking, anyway?”
Caught off-guard as he had been, Dean nearly forgot to breathe. The shivery sensation of long fingers threading through his hair, taking hold there with a strong grip and using it to pull his head into a more comfortable angle of connection, had him drawing in a sharp gasp of air, which had the effect of making him even dizzier as he breathed in the scent of Castiel. This close, he could smell the sandalwood from the hair products Castiel used, along with the plaster and sawdust that never quite washed out of his work clothes. The hot breaths against Dean’s neck suggested peppermint candy, and beneath it all lay the warm, slightly spicy scent that Dean had never been able to identify but had come to associate with the man in his arms.
Flashes of memory flitted behind Dean’s eyes: getting up in Castiel’s face and shouting, crouching on his knees in front of Castiel and begging.
Three dozen trips later (somebody was evidently unaware that there was an upper limit on the number of circuits you could safely have on one panel), Dean still hadn’t found the right circuit. “The hell?” he said to himself, squinting at the light and scratching his head. The power had to be coming from somewhere. Another breaker box? But where? On the outside of the house? That was possible, but he could hear the sharp clattering of rain blowing hard against the windows, and he didn’t relish searching blindly in the dark
Years before, in a simpler time, a former friend of Dean’s had dragged him to a John Mayer concert, a fact that Dean would forever deny and was going to take with him to the goddamn grave. He’d only gone because the friend had been going through a bad breakup, and the tickets were supposed to have been for him and his girl, and, well, Dean wasn’t made of stone. But they’d stood there, surrounded by swaying sorority girls, listening to “Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,” and his friend had cried into Dean’s shoulder. “He gets me, he really
Castiel Novak had been a godsend. He was also a history buff, obviously, but he also was a freaking bulldog when it came to stubbornly refusing to give up on a good mystery. Dean’s research difficulties seemed to catch Castiel’s interest immediately, and he’d chased down clue after clue for Dean, making short work out of all the frustrating roadblocks and lost trails.
“Mmm-hmm,” Sam said, still grinning. After another moment of contemplation, he turned back around and heaved a deep breath, stretching his arms. “Okay, procrastinated enough, I guess.
“Nice choice on the light fixture. Very good lighting for food preparation. It will also show every single fingerprint on those stainless appliances, and you’ll never keep them clean enough. Just wait until you have children. Hoo, boy, then you’ll really see.” She looked up sharply when he didn’t quite suppress his choking sound. “Don’t bother acting so shocked, Dean. And don’t act like it’s not an option, either. Plenty of same-sex couples find ways to have children. Your mother would want grandchildren, rest her soul.”
“Most of them are pre-pubs,” Castiel sighed. “Advanced Reader Copies, which haven’t been fully edited yet. We’re not allowed to put them in our collection. Once the committee fully rules out a title, I’ll find somewhere to donate it, but until we make the decisions, I have to hold onto them. And we’re not all reading the same books in the same order.”
Snorting, she lifted her gaze and met his, but there was a sadness there. “Honestly? Maybe a little.”
As Dean packed up his things for the day, and for the entire drive home, he kept replaying Meg’s words in his head. Was it possible? Could he somehow have completely missed Castiel flirting with him in a way that went beyond his normal teasing or that was related to their whole fake relationship stratagem? Sure, some of their kidding around got fairly far into some pretty irreverent territory, but that was sort of who Castiel was; he’d been intentionally working to make Dean blush at every opportunity since their first conversation. How was Dean supposed to tell if that was still the case, or if, for example, the comments about Dean needing a spanking if he didn’t stop moving the nail gun were more than just playful scolding?
Castiel yawned, tipping his head back against the wood siding. He’d only been here about a week, but his body had obviously become accustomed to the more sedentary life he’d led in seclusion. Around New Lebanon, everybody worked, even the newest arrivals. He had no permanent role yet, since he was still technically recovering from his injuries and couldn’t do much heavy lifting, but that only meant he’d been relegated to busy-work like errand running and message delivering.
At the sound of her voice trembling, Dean pulled her in close for a hug (avoiding pressing her up against the apparently lethal antenna), patting her back gently. “You know I will,” he said.
The edge of the sickly purple carpet was completely visible now, so once he’d gotten rid of the rest of the wood from around the edges of the room, he scrabbled for the loosest bit he could find, getting as much of a grip as he could before pulling. The carpet, unlike the baseboards, stubbornly refused to move.
Castiel lifted his face from where it was buried in Dean’s chest and glared up at him. “He said he was going to make a phone call, and I caught him trying to put shrink wrap on your toilets.”
“I promised no freaky things!” Gabriel laughed. “And I guarantee you, there’s nothing in that basket that can’t be considered practical.”
“Fuck the baseboards,” Dean earnestly agreed, earning a wolfish grin in response. Castiel closed the final inches between them, pressing his lips firmly to Dean’s. Unable to resist, Dean lifted both hands to the back of Castiel’s head, relishing the soft texture of his hair as he held him there, drawing out the kiss as long as he could.
“This whole thing between us,” he said slowly. “Sort of amazing, isn’t it? You’d never buy this kind of thing if you saw it in a movie. It’d be too cheesy, too hard to swallow with all the random coincidences. Here’s me, trying to learn everything I could about you, up here working under the sister you thought you lost. And you, living in my old house and trying to figure me out from the things I left behind. We were both trying so damn hard to find each other, one way or another, and that was before we ever even met.”
Billie swirled the dark wine in her glass, watching it slosh against the sides. “I tried to warn Dean. You heard me. The Entity doesn’t easily give up possession of those who come into its domain. It can be possessive like that. Clingy, if you want my opinion.”
What better place to start than one of Great-Grandpa’s stories? Dean had been stunned when a little poking around had revealed that it hadn’t been a tall-tale at all: one of his not-too-distant cousins, centuries before, had been at the heart of a tragic story that had ended in a public execution for treason against the crown. The more Dean read up on the guy, James Ratcliffe, the more fascinated he’d grown, and when he’d read about the actual castle that Ratcliffe and his widow were supposedly still haunting, he’d known that there could be no other thesis topic for him.
Castiel stood quietly and allowed Dean to unzip the sodden jacket he’d been given at the church shelter; numbly shifting the box of food from one hand to the other, he made no protest nor attempt to assist when Dean pushed it off his shoulders so that he could replace it with his own warm flannel, which was only damp. The bleeding from Castiel’s shoulder wound had grown tacky where it had saturated the fabric of his t-shirt and stuck to his skin. Dean hesitated when he noticed it, and whatever peculiar emotion passed across his face had Castiel’s throat tightening in reaction. He swallowed thickly and looked away, unable to handle the strange tension between them.
Dean was awkwardly looking out into the hallway, wondering how he could subtly make his escape from the argument, but a loud crashing sound had him spinning in surprise. A stack of pipes that had been piled in the corner beside Castiel had suddenly come unbalanced and toppled heavily to the floor. “Shit, look out,” Dean said, grabbing Castiel’s arm to pull him out of the path of the rolling pipes. Thankfully, it looked like none had landed on his feet, even though the steel-toed boots would have protected them.
“You know that’s not what I’m talking about,” Dean growled as he marched up to the bar and braced his palms on the wood. “I mean your little ‘test the waters’ plan. I hired your ‘friend,’ who, by the way, took the fee and now refuses to answer any phone calls, so I can only assume she did the job.”
Another reason for letting Charlie in on the action was that it made leaving camp a much simpler proposition than it otherwise might have been. Tall fences topped with barbed wire and an electronic gate that loudly alerted everyone of potential risk whenever it opened were precautions that were necessary to protect the wellbeing of everyone in New Lebanon, as were the regular patrols of guards along the inside of the fence, but they definitely made leaving without being noticed a tricky proposition.
Castiel couldn’t resist. “Not Jesus. Castiel. Just an angel, not the Son of God.” His throat rasped when he spoke, and he coughed, which sent flames licking up his trachea.
he was hearing a recording, so that there would be a possibility that he could hear it again sometime.
At Dean’s seemingly random question, Castiel poked his head out of the bathroom door, wiping the sweat from his forehead. “Yes, I am a human being living on planet Earth,” he said. “Why, are you ordering some? I’ve already eaten dinner, but don’t feel awkward about ordering just for yourself. I’m here to work, not as a guest you have to host.”
Ah, shit. His collar hadn’t been quite high enough to cover it, after all. “I read someplace that you’re supposed to try hanging a piece of newsprint by your monitor. Take a moment to pull your eyes away from the screen and focus on that every once in a while. Gotta take care of your eyes now or you’ll wind up in bifocals before you’re forty.”
“He’s fine,” Gabriel told Dean. There was an odd note in his voice, and his grin had finally slipped. He was watching Dean now with an assessing look.
Dean’s hand hadn’t moved away from Castiel’s cheek, and now he paused in his ministrations, his thumb lingering on the sharp cheekbone. “Cas, you don’t have to,” he said softly. Thinking about Castiel like that, all alone in the bunker with only his darkest thoughts for company, made Dean’s throat tighten. He wanted to wrap Castiel up in a soft blanket, hold him tight, and do everything in his power to erase those memories for him.
“I guess, sure,” Dean concurred, a little more warily. “If we’re already doing the deck, we might as well, right?”
"Ah, come on," Dean said, pasting on a broad grin that he hoped didn't show any of the doubts he was feeling about the plan. "You and I managed to last on our own for a while back when the world went sideways. We didn't need any handlers or radios then. It'll be just like old times."
to take you shopping, by force if necessary, and get you into something other than that tired, sad trench. Anyway, what you lack in fashion, I’m sure you made up for in crates of musty old books.”
The men moved out of the doorway, wandering cautiously through the bunker, and the way they ignored the rest of the bunker provisions made it crystal clear that they were actively searching for him.
Looking back on the evening, now that he was no longer swimming in the heady tangle of it all, he realized that the only resolution he and Castiel had actually reached out loud was related to their physical attraction to each other. And while that was awesome and something he was completely on board with pursuing, it was miles away from the
And then they sat there, awkwardly staring at each other. Well, Castiel was staring at Naomi, anyway; her eyes were still determinedly downcast.
Sam aimed a shove at his shoulder. “You want excitement?” he said. “I hope it stays this boring the whole way there. Boring is safe, safe is good.”
Sure, Dean might have been laying it on a little thick there at the end, but part of him was feeling genuinely hurt and justified about feeling so. He idly picked at some loose and bubbling plaster in the corner while he talked, watching the tiny particles rain down on the toes of his boots.
Sam was always the one who liked tea; Dean called it leaf water, and he made fun of it, but now he realized he couldn’t even remember the taste.
“…like thirty humpless camels at the well!” The Cupid laughed raucously at what was apparently the punchline of another of those jokes that didn’t translate well into English. The other angel stared at him impassively until the gleeful snickering died away. Drooping sheepishly, then, the Cupid said, “Eh, Uriel told it better.”
On the other end of Dean’s phone call, Sam’s voice had gone quiet while Castiel had been speaking. In the pause that followed, Sam cleared his throat, and when he spoke again, his words were heavy with mischief. “Dean,” he practically purred. “Is there someone else in your house right now?”
Dean scowled, dropping down to sit on the bottom step (and ignoring the ominous creak that had Castiel slowly lifting his eyes toward the top of the wooden stairs). “Aren’t you supposed to be a service professional? Is this the way you talk to all your clients?” No matter how hot the guy might be, Dean was starting to be seriously put off by the feeling that he was being judged personally.
Castiel wasn’t coherent enough to understand him, anyway. “It’s not real,” he was mumbling now, shaking his head. “You’re not really him. The Michael Sword—Dean! Dean Winchester is not here. It’s all a lie, I know, I know…”
“Yeah, sure,” Dean said, stepping closer and pulling a rag from his pocket. He wiped the perspiration from Sam’s forehead and pushed the hair back, blinking away the flash of a sudden memory of tending to a shorter, gawkier, teenaged version of Sam. There was a smudge of dirt across Sam’s cheekbone now, and Dean had to force himself not to scrub at it as he adjusted his brother’s headset from where it had slipped.
Even Dean’s talent for denial was having trouble finding a way to turn this into something strictly platonic. His mouth felt unbearably dry, and he licked his lips nervously. Castiel’s eyes instantly zeroed in on his mouth, tracking the movement. Neither of them breathed for a moment that seemed to stretch interminably.
The click of the door made him jump, when he’d been leaning there long enough that his feet had started to cramp, but it was only the assistant leaving the office, his arms full of papers. Castiel grimaced, looking up at the sun’s position in the sky. Was he being an idiot? He might end up waiting here for hours, and he wasn’t even sure that the assistant had been truthful when he’d said Naomi was in camp. Maybe she was off somewhere working on a long-range project that would keep her away for days.
The thing was, he definitely had to tell Sam before he got caught and forced into honesty. That would be the worst outcome. And since Sam had expressed curiosity in their recent conversations about Dean’s progress on the repair work, it was certainly within the bounds of possibility that Sam would just pop by the new place, figuring that if he was already there, Dean wouldn’t be able to refuse. That would be…
“Uh, yeah, Dean,” Sam replied, narrowing his eyes. “I missed a whole summer of playing in the pool. Kind of hard to forget.”
“You could make me think I’m seeing it,” Castiel answered promptly, but he didn’t sound as certain as he had before. Now that he was looking at Dean, he couldn’t seem to stop searching his face. At one point in their history together, this level of scrutiny would have made Dean uncomfortable and irritable, but by now it was just an accepted part of the way he and Castiel communicated. “Personal space” wasn’t even on the radar, and, truthfully, Dean didn’t miss it a bit.
“And I’m sure she’s being totally up-front about it, too,” Sam sighed. “But setting that aside—which, by the way, Major Novak is
“I mean, I knew she’d lost everybody,” Charlie continued. “I looked into her whole backstory when I got here—yeah, I know, but it’s a compulsion. Of course, you can’t really vet a person these days like you could when the Internet was still a thing. Did you know the Darknet actually survived in places, though? Sort of scary. The one time I ventured into a Darknet market to see if anybody around could get me a battery-powered soldering iron, it was enough to make me swear I’d use hamster wheels for power before I went back. But you can also still send and receive data packets via radio, if you’re determined enough. Y’know?”
