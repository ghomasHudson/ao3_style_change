Pulling back, Steve handed him more than enough money to pay for the drink. “In case you guys go for a second round.” With that, he headed back to his table, but not before saying, “I’ll see you around, Tony.”
Face still red, Steve nodded. Smiling, Tony cupped the side of his face, running a thumb over his cheek. “Good. Now let’s get you down here.”
His orgasm triggered Steve's own, filling Tony up with both cum and his knot. Their pleasure mixed together, and Tony was gasping at not just how much he felt, but how much Steve felt for him, an intoxicating blend of possessiveness, lust, and adoration.
Steve lets out a shaky laugh, barely believing his own two eyes. Even as he sits down, he keeps staring, hoping that this isn’t a hallucination.
Steve leaned forward, breath tickling the hairs on Tony's neck. He ran his teeth lightly over the bond mark, and in a husky voice, said, "Then come for me."
. Steve almost forgot that in his original timeline, Peggy was a huge presence in Tony’s childhood. Still, he’s glad that they finally got to meet again. “Yeah, I did.”
He kisses Tony’s sternum, the scar where the arc reactor used to be. Steve recalls the first time they had sex after the surgery, Tony trying his best to hide the scar and make Steve ignore it. Tony had told him it’s a reminder of what had happened to him, of his terrible past. But Steve doesn’t see it as anything bad. He sees a miracle, because without the arc reactor, Tony would have died. Yes, it may have almost killed him, but it gave him life too. It’s because of the arc reactor that Tony has survived, and it is because of it that Steve could meet him. They may have gotten off on the wrong foot, but Steve can’t imagine what it would be like if Tony hadn’t entered his life.
Again, Peggy understands him much more than he does. “We’ll have plenty of time for dances, but for now, I think there’s someone else that you want to see, isn’t there?”
A few days later, as Tony and his team were walking back to the station after lunch, they noticed a huge crowd gathered outside the fire station. People had their phones out, trying to snap pictures or record videos.
For everyone who's commented, bookmarked or left kudos, you are just the best. Much love! Thank you for taking the time to read an obsessed fangirl's fic about how she wants these two idiots to reunite. Hope you enjoy! Again, all comments will be greatly appreciated!
“Because it’s the last thing I have from you.” That pained smile returns to his face. “And I was hoping that maybe one day, I could call. And you’d be there. When I needed you”
He wonders about who’s gone and who’s left. The only death he is certain of is Vision. That’s the only way Thanos could have gotten the mind stone. But Tony knows it wouldn’t have been without effort. Knowing Bruce, he would have contacted Steve. And knowing Steve, he would have done everything in his power to protect Vision.
Steve waits, giving Tony the time and space to find the words he needs. It’s been a long day for both of them, he doesn’t blame him for the inability to find the right things to say.
"I told you they weren’t enough!" Thinking back, Tony realised that they barely ate anything the past few days, using the breaks between rounds to catch up on sleep. Even towards the end, when Steve's rut was winding down, the werewolf would only grab a glass of water and make a quick PB&J sandwich before returning to the bed for more sleep. Although he did enjoy good food, as a vampire, Tony didn’t actually need any to survive, so he hadn’t noticed Steve’s lack of intake until now. “We should get some food. What do you want to eat?”
It’s an indescribable feeling. Tony never even thought he would get to see Steve again, not to mention watch a sunrise together. If someone told Tony that this is all a dream, he would almost believe it. But the ache of his back, the solid shoulder under his head, the warmth seeping into his palm, they let him know that this is reality. For that, he is grateful.
Pain. Blinding, searing pain. Pain that had Tony bite into the pillow to stop himself from screaming.
Tony speaks up just as Steve says something too. Both stop, and Tony hates how awkward things are between them now.
Steve is waiting for Tony’s response, but he can’t think of anything. He can’t find the right words to tell him how tired, how grateful, how scared he is. All he can focus on is Steve’s hand that is wrapped around his, how large and warm it is, how much rougher it’s become, how it touched him all over last night, how his fingers were inside of him, bent at just the right angle-
Tony wanted nothing more than to take everything back, but before he could, Steve just said, “I’m gonna go” and walked away.
Then there is Steve. If he’s honest, he only looked at the others to avoid staring at the man. Steve’s at the head of the table, completely exhausted but staying awake to see this through.
Tony didn’t have time to dwell on these feelings, because the next thing he knew, Steve flipped him onto his front, bracketing his hips with his legs.
“You better not.” Tony could only flush at how sincere Steve sounded, hiding his own smile behind his beer bottle, because he’d be damned if he let the werewolf know just how clingy he, a vampire, was.
In that moment, Tony felt warm all over. Fuck being self-conscious; Steve knew exactly what he was doing. The look in Steve’s eyes was one of the things that Tony vividly remembered from their one-night stand, and it was that look that Tony liked to recall when he touched himself, the one that would always get him hot and bothered. He could feel his blood slowly making its way down south, which would be the last thing he wanted to happen because a) he’s in public and b) he didn’t need Steve to see the effect he had on him.
While he mulled over this, swiping a finger through the condensation on his glass, Clint nudged him. “Hey, pretty boy’s staring at you.” Tony didn’t dare look back, another blush rising to his cheeks. “Please, he’s probably wondering why I’m being such a creep.”
Tony stared at him, trying to recall everything he had learnt about werewolves. Werewolf omegas had a bonding gland on the back of their necks, and the Alpha that made their mark on that gland would be their mate. Tony had always thought it would be more complicated than that, considering that mating was for life, but no, it really was that simple.
Over the centuries, demons had evolved to be more human-like, to make it easier upon themselves when it came to shape-shifting. The only ones who still looked like the classic stereotypes, coloured skin with blood red eyes and fanged teeth, were the older demons, the first generation, as well as the devil himself, Tony’s boss. But the usual traits were still there. Tony felt his horns grow, twisting their way out of his head. At the base of his spine, a forked tail sprouted out and swished about, as if stretching after having been kept in for so long. His ears became pointed, and his nails sharper, almost like claws. In the middle of his chest, a faint light glowed as runes etched into the skin, a circular pattern in the centre with jagged lines growing out of it. Last of all, a pair of jet black wings sprouted out of his back, falling back down against the mattress.
But what he said about his hook-ups… Tony was younger back then, naive and full of pent up energy. He slept with many of them just because he could, or because they were favours owed by people who sold their soul to the devil. It was fun, and Tony got the release he needed, but after all while, they were never satisfying. Some got really close, but they weren’t… enough. He couldn’t find what he was looking for, which was made all the worse when he didn’t know exactly
As Tony came back from his high, he could feel Steve slowly pulling out of him. He reached out to stop him, hand once again on his arm. “What are you doing? You haven’t finished yet.”
He doesn’t know where he wants to go, only that he needs to move. He doesn’t even know where anything is. He’s sure someone must have told him the layout and given him directions when they were bringing him to the meeting, but he heard none of it.
Smiling, Tony took that hand and moved it, placing it on the back of his head. He leaned forward, tongue darting out to lick the head of Steve’s cock, instantly feeling the hand on his head grip his hair. Taking that as encouragement, he licked all the way down, then back up, following along the vein underneath. With one final lick, he wrapped his lips around the head, slowly sucking his way down Steve’s entire length. Once it hit the back of his throat, Tony started swallowing around it, hand coming up to stroke the rest of what he couldn’t fit in.
He looks much younger when he’s asleep, Tony notices. More peaceful too. He wonders if he looks like that when he’s asleep too.
Clint clinked his glass against Tony’s. “Drink up then.”  Clint was a human. He was also Natasha’s boyfriend. Tony had watched the whole thing unfold. Clint was the first human who was brave enough to talk to her outside of ordering drinks. She was surprised that she couldn’t persuade him with her words. At first, they thought he was some sort of wizard who was powerful enough to defend himself against her persuasion. Turns out, he was deaf. He couldn’t hear her voice, but he could read lips. It took a while for Natasha to come to terms with this inability to use her powers, but maybe that’s why she liked him all that more. Clint wasn’t as creeped out by all the supernaturals as most humans were, and in fact, he asked questions, genuinely curious. Tony never liked humans, but he did like Clint.
Feeling too blissed out to move, Tony watched as Steve got off the bed and went to what he assumed to be the bathroom, coming back with a wet cloth. Tony let himself be cleaned up, watching as the blond’s eyebrows furrowed, making sure that every spot was cleaned up well. When he went back to wash up, Tony wondered if he should take the chance to leave, or if Steve would want him to go. Neither happened, and the angel returned to bed.
Steve notices the look on Tony’s face, and wants nothing more than to have the ability to send Tony back, to revive him just so that he can spend his life with his family, the one that he so completely deserved, one that he got after so long only for it to be snatched away.
As they weaved through traffic, Tony couldn’t help but lean forward, resting his cheek against Steve’s back, seeking out warmth as the cool autumn air rushed past them. He could feel surges of energy at the points of contact, now completely sure that Steve was a lot more powerful than he seemed.
Steve can’t help but smile a little at that. “It’s okay. I’m just glad you didn’t get rid of the phone.”
Tony opened his mouth to respond, but closed it, knowing full well that Natasha could find a crack in whatever excuse or explanation he came up with. Instead, he walked away. “I need another coffee.”
“It may be, but still, I am so proud of you,” Dr Erskine says, and Steve remembers what he had said to him that night before the experiment.
Letting go of his hand, Steve stood in the middle of the room, looking around. “Why did you bring me here?”
“I know. And I will always love you,” she replies, hand reaching up to cup the side of Steve’s face. “But you can love two people at the same time. The same goes for him too.”
Tony rolled his eyes, swinging his legs up onto Steve’s lap. The blond visibly stiffened at the sudden contact, but Tony thought nothing of it, assuming it to be just out of surprise.
He gasps out Tony’s name, but the other man doesn’t stop. Instead, Tony pulls Steve’s cock out of his pants and starts stroking. God, how Steve has missed this. And at least now, he knows how far Tony wants to take this.
Her eyes are watering, but Steve knows that she will not cry. He reaches up to hold her hand, knowing that she really is one of the strongest among them.
“Oh my God, are you blushing?” she smirked, so obviously entertained by what was going on her in front of her.
“Good. Great.” Steve’s mind can only churn out the most basic of vocabulary, mostly because he’s too focused on staring at Tony. “How about you? Are you… at peace?”
Steve shifted closer to him, and Tony watched as a spotless white wing came into contact with one of his own black ones. He noticed that besides the colour, the feathers were perfectly identical. Both of them were fundamentally the same.
Steve dashes over to her and pulls her into a hug, one that she instantly returns. He never thought he would see her again. He didn’t get to say goodbye, he didn’t even get to see her body, so to have her here, physically here and hugging him back, Steve can barely control his emotions.
Tony opened his eyes, fully expecting to see disgust and terror on Steve’s face. Instead, all he saw was a face full of wonder and amazement, eyes travelling over his body as he took in the new parts.
Just like that, Steve finds his words. Without stopping, he lets Tony know all the things that have happened in the years since he left. He tells him about the team, about the rebuilding of the headquarters, then moves on to the most important people in Tony’s life.
As the door closes behind them, Steve holds onto Tony’s waist, walking them backwards. Tony’s hands are at his head, running through the still damp hair. Tony rubs up against him, and Steve realizes that he’s hard. Unconsciously, Steve’s hands grip harder and he grinds their hips together.
It was Tony’s turn to treat the team, so after getting all their orders, he headed over to the bar. As he waited, he could feel someone walk up next to him and when he looked up, the blue eyes that were staring at him from across the room where now right in front of him.
“Are you kidding me?” Clint glanced at the man before turning back to Tony. “You show off your powers to hook up all the time.” He turned to Bruce and asked, “What’s up with him?” to which Bruce could only shrug.
Steve knows that he will never stop blaming himself, but he nods anyway. He takes a seat next to Natasha, and the two of them talk and catch up, just like old times.
“-room,” Tony breathes out, Steve so lost in the feeling that he only catches the end. “There’s lube in the bathroom.”
So, he keeps repeating it, punctuating every repetition with a hard thrust. Every time he repeats it, he too uses it to say something else.
Tony wasn’t blind. Thor was attractive as hell, the number of people screaming his name and taking his picture attesting to that. Tony just wished they could be a little quieter, because they did still need to do work next door, and there was legitimately one time the station almost went into a state of emergency because they heard hysterical screaming, only for it to be the fangirls reacting to Thor flexing.
Tony turned to see Steve sitting on a chair, with a long line of children in front of him, waiting to get their face painted by him. Seeing Steve with the paintbrush in his hand, it finally all made sense. How the secret admirer knew exactly what Tony liked, how Tony never saw any strangers hanging around the place, how they could so easily get the help of Tony’s teammates.
Minutes later, they stopped. Tony got off first, taking off his helmet to get a good look. In front of him was a tall, red brick apartment block, identifying the neighbourhood to be in Brooklyn immediately.
Another impatient whine escaped Tony. He wanted to get to the main event already, but he remembered Steve’s naked body. The werewolf’s cock, which was now brushing against Tony’s leg, was long and thick, and if that was anything to go by, his knot was going to be huge. So, Tony allowed the extra attention spent on him, gripping the sheets in anticipation, letting the wave of safety and warmth from Steve's words wash over him, secure in the feeling that he would be well taken care of.
Letting out a sigh, Steve turned to Tony. “I found the person I want as my mate, and I think this is the wolf’s way of getting me to do something about it.”
Nebula answers with silence, putting in the coordinates and piloting the ship. Tony’s grateful for it as he sits and closes his eyes, trying to hold back the inevitable panic attack. Besides the humming of the ship’s engine, the cabin is absolutely quiet, nothing but the weight of what just happened filling the air.
Standing back up with two packets in hand, Steve opened the lube packet, spreading a generous amount over his fingers. Slowly, with one finger, he pushed into Tony, moving the digit in and out to get him used to the feeling before adding a second, opening him up for what’s to come.
Tony tried the door, and when he found it locked, used the keys Steve had given him. Tony opened the door, only to find the apartment in a complete mess. Things were strewn all over the floor, and there were claw marks everywhere, especially the sofa, with the spot where Tony had sat five days ago totally destroyed.
It’s true. Tony had always been told that angels and demons were the first ever enemies on Earth. Wars broke out over it. Religions had been built around each side, sparking conflicts every now and then. The only reason Tony had never really seen, much less fought, any angels was because of a pact, drawn up and agreed upon by both sides to preserve their numbers and protect mankind, the life source for both. Knowing that an angel was not only watching over him, but that it was his own personal guardian angel, left Tony feeling completely overwhelmed.
Almost immediately, a glint of lust flashed over Steve’s blue eyes, and Tony could sense his reply before he said it, his mate’s hands lowering to squeeze his ass. “You.”
The moan that escapes Tony’s mouth travels straight from Steve’s ear to his dick, because it might have been years since he’s last heard it, but fuck if it isn’t the hottest thing. He’s so lost in the sound that he doesn’t even realize when Tony pushes a hand into his track pants until it wraps around his hardening cock.
As for Tony? Steve doesn’t feel right asking, but he’s sure that Peggy and Tony have talked about him, sure that Peggy more than understands Tony, sure that she wouldn’t tell him all those things knowing that he was bound to fail. Not only that, but during Tony’s funeral, Pepper had personally asked him to join her, to listen to Tony’s final recording. He declined at first, knowing that he would feel out of place, but Pepper insisted. When he asked her why, all she said was, “He would want you to be there.”
Immediately, Tony sat down and started searching. After a while, he found out that the white flowers were gardenias.
So for me, I always imagined that Pepper and Tony have always remained friends, and that Steve and Tony got together after the first Avengers movie but broke up after Civil War (obviously). That's all the backstory you need to know!
You would think that tormenting humans and persuading them to make bad decisions every day would be fun. Which it was, for the first couple of hundred years. Now, it was getting a little tiresome. Day in, day out, doing the same thing all day, every day.
He sits back upright, looks at Steve and says, “I just wanted to know if you could catch me up on what you guys talked about at the meeting.” Tony feels bad about having been so out of it yesterday. If he’s going to make things right, he's going to have to work harder.
“The two of us… we’re in dangerous lines of work, and I’m just afraid that… one day, something bad might happen to us,” Tony said, voice shaking. “Remember that big fire that sent all of you to the hospital after?”
“I’m serious,” he said. “You think in all the years we’ve known each other, I’ve never thought about this? About us?” Tony wasn’t going to lie to himself. Sure, he mostly thought about Steve as a friend, but come on. There was this perfect specimen of a man right in front of him. He had always been attracted to Steve.
Tony’s words are cut short, but only because Steve can’t control himself anymore. He pulls Tony into a hug, and nearly cries at how warm Tony is, solid and strong and
“You’ll see them soon. I’m only here because they thought I would be most suitable to welcome you.” The doctor then gestures around the barrack. “If you’re wondering, no, this isn’t what the afterlife looks like. This is just to reduce the shock and help you get acclimatised.”
“I love you too, you dumb dog.” Tony was almost embarrassed at the amount of affection Steve was sending him. “Now come here and kiss me.” And they did, Tony’s arms wrapping around Steve’s neck as their lips met.
Before long, Tony was on the edge, the coil in his stomach tightening every time Steve pushed into him. He was so close, his tail writhing below him in desperation and anticipation of release. Steve could sense it, and leaned back down, whispering low and rough into Tony’s ear. “Come for me.”
Steve smiled against Tony’s temple. “Just want to make sure you feel as good as possible, sweetheart.” Honestly, Tony would have hated that nickname if he wasn’t in the position he was currently in, but his body involuntarily shuddered, his cock beginning to leak pre-cum at the mere sound of Steve’s voice alone, rough and husky against his ear.
When Steve turned back around, the shock and confusion was clear on his face, but he still forced a smile. “I never thought of you as a person who liked face paint.”
As for the rest of his team, his family? It might be a while, but he knows he’ll see them again. He’ll just have to wait a while. Until then, he finally has a chance to make things right with Tony, a chance that he sure as hell isn’t going to ever let go.
“You would be so proud of her, Tony,” Steve says. “She’s smart, funny, kind. Just like you. She’s gonna do amazing things in the future.”
That caused Steve to pause, body still half off the bed. After a moment, he sighed, climbing fully onto the bed, resting on his side to look at the demon beside him. He frowned, his halo almost seeming to dim as he did so. “I don’t know.”
Tony can’t help but feel so small, so insignificant. Thousands of deaths just occurred in this country alone, but it seems like nothing has happened. Nature doesn’t mourn, it just carries on.
“And you still want to…” Tony knew he didn’t need to complete the sentence for Steve to get what he was implying.
He surges forward, capturing Tony’s lips in another searing kiss. This time, when he pulls away, the words come out before he can even process them.
It’s a beautiful feeling, and Tony wishes he could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in it forever.
He rubs his left arm, feels the numbness seeping back into his body, into his muscles, into his very bones.
He had no idea that things would turn out the way they did. He had expected a quick fuck, sex that would take his mind away from the pain. He just wanted to feel something, and Steve made him feel everything.
But something nags at the back of his head. Despite having most of his blood rushing south, a part of Steve knows something’s wrong, that Tony has something to say, but he can’t find the will to pull away and ask, his body is running on autopilot as Tony touches him.
The hand in Tony’s hair gripped even harder. For a short moment, he wanted to let Steve take over, to just let him fuck his mouth, forcing him to take all of him. That thought made Tony palm his own dick through his pants, needing some relief before he came too early.
But the smile he had on became a million times brighter when he spotted Bruce. Making his way over, he greeted everyone else before turning to Bruce. “Hi,” Thor said shyly, as if he wasn’t shirtless and didn’t look like an actual god.
They eat in silence as they watch the sunrise, the golden orb leaving the horizon. It’s a comfortable silence, a reminder of the better times. Tony recalls the moments they’ve spent like this, sitting together with no words exchanged, just enjoying each other’s presence.
She interrupts him. “You don’t have to explain yourself. I know that he means a lot to you.” She holds his hand in hers. “We had a great lifetime together, but every time you talked about him, I could see that you held so much regret. Now is the time to finally fix that.”
Next to Wilson was Thor Odinson, who the entire police department was sure was a real life Viking, if his blue eyes, blond hair, and great height were anything to go by. Despite being a giant of a man, he was a real softie at heart. Everyone had a crush on him, but none more so than Bruce, the police’s resident forensic scientist. (In fact, Thor was very obviously trying to pretend that he wasn’t staring at said scientist, who was taking his seat next to Tony.)
Two years, and Tony looks as if it were decades. White has now grown at the temples of his thick hair. New wrinkles have formed along his forehead and at the corner of his eyes. Steve notices that the armour is in pieces because it’s broken, and even the inner track suit is torn and tattered. Blood is everywhere, dried flecks in his hair, a stain where it had previously dribbled out his mouth.
All the while, Tony was just trying not to come right there and then. A hand in Steve’s hair, he pulled him forward for a kiss, trying to get as much of Steve as possible, as if to make up for all the lost time. By the time Steve added a third finger, Tony felt like a complete mess, his body flushed all over. He just wanted Steve to hurry up already, but he knew that Steve was going to make him wait, just like he made Steve wait for two years.
“Of course I’m sure,” Tony said, never feeling more genuine about anything else than he did in that instance, but there was a bit of self-consciousness tickling the back of his mind. “How about you? You sure you want a vampire as your mate? There are probably tons of werewolf omegas out there who would be better for you.”
Tony has his head thrown back the entire time, shaking as Steve enters him. Steve can barely hold himself either, Tony so unbelievably warm and tight. He gives Tony a moment to get used to the feeling, and when he looks back to nod, Steve starts moving.
He imagined what it would be like. He would have to tell the guys over at the bar. Natasha would probably gloat over the fact that she was right for pushing him to talk to Steve. Bruce would be grateful that someone else would be dealing with the trouble he caused. Clint would just laugh over the entire situation and how ironic it was for him to have a guardian angel. And Tony? It would greatly affect his work, considering how he could no longer use his body as temptation, but he was a natural born charmer. He could do just as well. The only real difference would be that he would have someone to spend his time with. Someone that would listen to him and be with him willingly. It seemed like such a foreign thought, but looking at Steve, he could actually imagine it happening.
With no prompting, Steve’s own hand moved to cover Tony’s over the curve, no doubt as a result of their bond. Steve pressed a soft kiss to the top of his head, sending a single thought back:
There’s something else there too. Something, a look, that Steve can’t place when he first notices it. It seems to stick out, but he finally understands what it is. It’s everything that Steve has been saying, something that Tony can’t express.
“Tony, stop.” Steve’s hands immediately go to hold Tony sides, to hold him still. He helps Tony off, pulling slowly to avoid causing any more pain.
Steve steps out the bathroom, grateful for the long shower after what can only be described as the worst day ever. The meeting went nowhere, with nobody having any clue where to even begin or if the others can even be brought back again. Before that, he fought hundreds of aliens and even Thanos himself. Right now, he just wants to sleep.
They entered the elevator, and when the doors closed, Tony wanted to ask a question, but it never left his lips as Steve pinned him against the wall, hands on his hips and lips on his neck. Tony’s breath hitched as Steve’s mouth traced his neck and jaw, kissing and nipping the sensitive skin. He pressed a knee between Tony’s legs, rubbing up against Tony’s growing erection.
A few weeks later, Tony was at work when he saw Steve step into the bullpen. After handing a few files to another officer, Steve walked over, a bright smile on his face. “Hi.”
Slowly, he shifts Steve’s arm away and crawls out of bed. He grabs his clothes and heads to the bathroom to wash up. His body aches, especially his back, and when he puts his clothes back on, he tries to ignore the itchiness from what he assumes to be beard burn along his thighs.
It took a moment, but Tony decided that yes, he was. He wasn’t going to let Steve go just like that, not after everything they’ve been through.
He talks about Peter, who has really matured a lot. He’s gotten into the university of his choice, and according to him, it was really because he wrote his application essay on his internship at Stark Industries, about how Tony was the best mentor he could have ever had. Even though he’s a lot busier, he still spends his free time with Morgan, who’s become a little sister to him.
He had never felt anything like it before. His lips were literally tingling, a sensation that travelled throughout his entire body. Steve’s mouth opened under his, hands moving back to grip Tony’s hips, pulling him impossibly closer. Tony could feel Steve’s growing interest, and if the bulge pressed against him was anything to go by, he was big. He couldn’t help but moan at that thought, only for it to be swallowed up by Steve.
And it didn’t just end there. As he waved, Steve had a slight flush to his face, clearly feeling awkward and self-conscious about having so many people look at him, which made him just as endearing as well. Not only that, but when he saw the golden retriever puppy that he was going to pose with, the smile that appeared on his face made him all the more adorable.
Tony hates how tense everything is becoming, so when they move apart, he says, “Would you shave the beard if I asked you to?” Because as good as Steve looks with a beard, Tony does miss his clean-shaven look.
Then again, because the next few gifts were all sketches, Tony knew there had to be a contact inside the station, telling the secret admirer that Tony finally liked something.
Once he was fully seated, Steve paused, letting Tony get used to the feeling. Tony was grateful, but all he wanted was for things to speed up. He wrapped his legs around the angel’s narrow waist, ankles locked against the small of his back. He gripped Steve’s biceps and said, “
“I know, but I didn’t need one. The old suit still works perfectly fine.” Steve’s smile softens as he says, “Besides, it’s the last thing I have from you.”
The grin that grew on Steve’s face was big and beautiful, full of relief but also pure joy, a smile that only reaffirmed Tony’s decision. Steve kissed him, and Tony would have been more than content to keep kissing him, but that joy must have translated into something else, because Steve came again, the sensation pushing a gasp out of Tony’s mouth, forcing him to break the kiss.
Using more lube, Steve slicked himself up, positioning himself at Tony’s hole. The demon couldn’t help but tense up at that feeling, but all his worries went away as Steve pushed into him, inch-by-inch. The heat and fullness left Tony breathless, the tingling sensation now travelling from inside out. (It was only after that he realised that this was his body trying to reject the contact of the angel, his demon instincts warning him of the danger, only for him to ignore all of it.)
Steve was quiet, however, and Tony felt guilt, fear, and sadness radiating off of him. Immediately, Tony turned around in his arms, coming face-to-face with the other man. “What’s wrong?”
Tony could only smile at how careful he was being. “We’ve known each other for centuries. We act like mates already. This would just make it official.”
The initial pain from the bite having deflated his knot, Steve pulled out with no warning, leaving Tony feeling empty at the sudden loss, but also deliciously filthy as some of Steve’s cum dripped out of his hole, staining the sheets below him.
“How could I not when you look so irresistible?” Steve asked, his free hand running along Tony’s thigh. “But this isn’t your true form, is it? Show me. I want to see the real you.”
“Then what the fuck are you doing with me?” A flash of fear ran through Tony. What if Steve was sent to kill him? Tony didn’t even put up any resistance. Hell, he was on his back with his legs wide open. He was asking to be killed.
“At least you admit to it.” Natasha glanced between the two. “Are you going to do something about it?”
. A sound so low and rough that Tony could feel the vibrations throughout his entire body. So he stopped trying to do anything, his legs falling to wrap loosely around Steve’s waist, letting the werewolf take him and use him and fuck him however he wanted.
It took almost a full minute, but when Tony finally realised what he was, a chill ran down his spine.
Demons weren’t supposed to reveal themselves, only in certain situations. And Tony was afraid that he would scare Steve away, but then he caught sight of those brilliant blue eyes trained on him, dark with so much desire and lust that Tony found himself unable to say no. So, he closed his eyes, focusing on his transformation.
, Tony thought as he leaned forward, meeting Steve in a kiss. His life was finally going to be a lot more interesting.
Tony heard the click of a bottle lid, and a few seconds later, felt two slick fingers pressed against his hole. As they pushed in, Tony couldn’t control himself any longer, breaking out of the kiss into a long moan. Steve took the chance to press kisses and bite bruises onto Tony’s skin, along the collarbone, down the sternum, marking any patch of skin that was available, all the while opening Tony up with his fingers.
Tony’s face got impossibly hotter. He was a male vampire; of course he couldn’t get pregnant. Using his elbow, he nudged Steve in the chest. “What are you talking about?”
With their emotions feeding off of each other, Tony felt like their high would never end, but eventually it did, Tony coming back to his senses to feel Steve's large body draped over him, warm and sticky with sweat. He was clearly exhausted, much like Tony was himself, but he was still holding himself up on his forearms so that he wasn’t crushing Tony below him.
In his post-orgasm state of mind, it took Tony a good three seconds to process that information. When he did, his eyes went wide open. It felt like his heart wanted to burst out of his chest. “Me?”
It’s not the first time Steve has said it, and Tony’s reaction, like now, has always been one of disbelief and uncertainty. Ever since the Accords, Steve’s greatest fear has been that Tony hates him. He told himself that he would be fine if they were never together again, but if Tony was so angry to the point where they couldn’t even be in the same room or hold a normal conversation without fighting, he would be devastated.
So yes, Tony realised that he should have insisted, but hey, he was a cop. If anything happened, he had a gun. Hell, the whole station was full of people with guns. He would be fine.
. This exposed Tony’s neck even more, and Steve pressed wet kisses and bit hickeys into the column of skin. Tony tried calling out to him again, but he shut right back up when Steve growled.
He talks about Rhodey, who has been a guardian for his family, protecting Morgan in anyway he can. He teaches her about the Iron Man armour, about War Machine, but mainly the different armours that her father had worn over the years.
“Yes. Now.” Tony walked away, towards the side of the fire station that was away from the fundraiser. A couple of minutes later, Steve appeared, but before he could say anything, Tony turned on him.
Tony involuntarily clenched at the thought, and with one final thrust, Steve slammed into Tony, his fully expanded knot firmly locking him in place. As Steve came, he bit down on Tony’s shoulder, hard enough to leave a mark but not enough to break the skin. The arousal from Steve’s cum spilling into him, along with the pain from the bite, finally pushed Tony over the edge, his own orgasm hitting him like a truck.
Cupping Steve’s face in his hands, Tony forced him to make eye contact. “There’s… something here, between us. It’s been there for a long time. I can’t put it into words, but it exists. And by denying it, you’re putting yourself in pain, and when you’re hurting, I’m hurting too.”
So, Steve hopes. He sees the look in Tony’s eyes, knows that he’s felt and thought about the same things, so he hopes.
But none of that has happened. No fighting, no arguments. They’re about to have sex, and while Steve knows that it’s probably not the right time for those three words, he can’t help it. It may have been two years since he’s said it, but Steve’s feelings for this man are just as strong as they were, maybe even stronger.
Confused, he pushes himself up, only to realise that his back no longer aches, the joints in his hands no longer sore. He looks down at them, only to see that they are free of wrinkles and blemishes, now looking like the hands of someone in their late twenties or early thirties.
“Stop frowning, darling. You look horrible when you do.” Peggy’s voice breaks him out of his thoughts. “You’re thinking so hard that I can hear your thoughts. And yes, I’m aware of everything that’s happened in both realities.”
Tony looked straight into them, trying to find the right words to express everything he wanted to say at that very moment. How scared he was, how unreal all of it felt, how the both of them were crazy for doing this. But all he said was, “Fuck me.”
“I watched Bucky die,” he decides to say. He knows it’s a risky move, talking about another death, especially with Tony’s strong resentment towards that man, but he goes with it anyway. “He was one of the first to go. He was scared too. He called out to me. I didn’t even know what was happening until he was just dust on the ground.”
Steve squeezed his hand. There was a second, then Steve finally bit down on the back of Tony’s neck.
Steve turns around to see Peggy, as young as beautiful as the day he first met her. She sits herself down next to him. “Thank you, Natasha.”
He glances up to Steve, who is sound asleep, snoring softly. He’s lying on Steve’s chest, with Steve’s arm wrapped around his waist.
Steve positioned himself, kneeling between Tony's legs, hands going to his hips to pull him closer. Holding himself in one hand, Steve slowly pushed into Tony's warm heat.
If this were any other scenario, Tony would have hated how Steve was treating him, acting as if he were weak and fragile. But right now, he was more than appreciative of Steve's concern. "I'm fine, just give me a second… God, you’re big."
Bringing the others back is not going to be an easy task and doing so will require a huge sacrifice. If he knows Fate, it will end up being either him or Steve making this sacrifice. If they’re both willing to do whatever it takes, which includes risking their lives, it is almost certain that one of them will die.
“It was a lot of nonsense that I made up to complete the application properly, but I basically told them that you needed me.” Steve must have noticed the look on Tony’s face because he went on. “You might not have known it, but you needed me. Or more like you needed someone to look after you. And not just from far away, but an actual, physical person to care for you.”
“Just looking at this.” Tony was amused at the physical intimacy. Steve really was like a giant puppy. “Surprised it hasn’t faded.”
He let go, licking his lips for the remainder of the blood. Pulling back, he saw Steve’s eyes go dark. Tony’s lips were swollen and stained red, irresistible to Steve’s growing hunger. With a growl that sent a shiver down Tony’s spine, Steve said, “My turn.”
“I don’t care.” Tony cut him off. “Take as much time as you need. I mean, you’ve already waited this long, right?”
“I was being stupid… I’m sorry,” Steve repeated before forcing a fake smile, one that only worked to highlight his pain. “Let’s just pretend this never happened, okay?”
Silence followed as Tony waited for a reply, taking the time to process his own emotions. He didn’t have to wait long though, because Steve soon said, “You were worried about me when I was in the hospital?”
If Tony is being honest, he doesn’t remember. Steve has this ability to make him lose his train of thought. But he’s always been able to think quickly.
Tony tries to stifle his laughter, and Steve has his moment of realisation. “Wait… did Peggy tell you about that?”
Paranoia starts tickling the back of his thoughts. What if this is all a dream? Or maybe it’s hallucinations, brought on by the trauma of the deaths?
As his knot grew bigger, Steve thrusts sped up, the bed creaking and threatening to break from the sharp movements. Tony, meanwhile, could only hold on for the ride, nails digging into Steve's back, realising that he was about to come untouched, something that rarely happened.
“I want this,” Tony reaffirmed, and while it was incredibly hot for Steve to ask for consent, Tony had reached a point where he just wanted Steve to touch him proper. He felt Steve’s cock rub against his thigh, and in that moment all vampire instincts just flew out the damn window. Leaning forward, he whispered into Steve ear, “I want
Wakanda is in chaos. The fields are littered with the dead and injured, covered with the fine dust of those that disappeared. Those that remained can only help, bringing the injured to whatever medical aid is left in the country.
Tony didn’t answer to that. It was true, but it was so incredibly discouraged that it might as well have been an official rule. He couldn’t even look Steve in the eye, mind running at a hundred miles an hour trying to process everything.
Steve and the others follows, no mood to even question who the hell this Quill is and why he has a spaceship. Steve walks to the airstrip, trying not to think about the dust that covers him, that covers everyone. Even Bruce, who had become uncharacteristically chatty after two years, is silent as they wait for the spaceship to land.
It was as if every single nerve in his body was alight, the beating of his heart and the rushing of his blood loud in his head, noise that drowned out all other senses. Staring up at the ceiling, Tony took deep breaths to calm himself down, his hand on Steve's an anchoring point.
It wasn’t long before Steve moved away, and from the corner of his eye, Tony saw him go to the bathroom. Tony took this opportunity to flip himself onto his back. This was going to be their first time; Tony didn’t want to miss the look on Steve’s face.
“I’ve watched you at that favourite bar of yours. Drinking your night away. Picking up whoever tickled your fancy. Taking them or letting them take you in the restroom, the back alley, or if they’re lucky enough, back in your apartment.” He reached a hand up to Tony’s face, running a knuckle over the apple of Tony’s cheek. “But then it started happening less and less. Then it stopped altogether. I thought you were sick, but your energy was still as strong as ever, so that couldn’t be it. Then it dawned on me. They weren’t enough. They were never enough. They only knew you for a few hours. I’ve known you for centuries. They couldn’t take care of you the way that I knew how.”
“You guys should just bone already,” Natasha said out of nowhere, completely breaking Tony’s concentration and startling him until he almost dropped his coffee.
Now left alone, Tony collapsed with his back against the wall, tilting his head back and staring up at the sky.
As they talked, he heard the door to the bar open, and almost immediately, a calming aura filled the entire space. Tony turned, and when he laid eyes on the new customer, he nearly dropped his drink.
Tony cupped the side of Steve’s face, to which the blond reached up to hold it in his own hand, turning to kiss Tony’s palm. Turning back, he smiled and said, “I’ve missed you.”
So there he was, in the Black Widow, a small bar tucked away in a small corner of New York. It was frequented by both human and supernatural alike, but the former had no clue about the latter, so a human appearance was needed to even enter. (Not that Tony minded. He never liked how his horns messed with his hair. Neither did he care much about his tail, which always got in the way of his shirts.)
“Is that why you’ve been coming out of your ruts looking so tired?” Tony asked, the truth dawning on him of just how much Steve had really been holding back for his sake. “Because of me?”
“Tony.” Steve said his name like he was testing it out, seeing how it sounded. The smile that he gave after made Tony sure that yes, he very much liked the way it sounded coming from Steve.
Tony could barely believe what he was hearing. Steve had been hiding his feelings for five hundred years? “All this time, this was happening and you didn’t tell me?”
, so he could barely control his voice, moaning into the pillow below him. What Steve was doing with his tongue set Tony’s blood on fire, warmer than he had ever been, even in hell itself. As if that wasn’t enough, Steve pushed his tongue past the ring of muscle, fucking him open slow and wet. Tony gasped at the intrusion, gripping hard onto the sheets, trying hard not to come from that sensation alone. He tried rutting backwards to get more friction, to get Steve to go deeper, but Tony was still pinned down by Steve’s large hands.
He feels Tony’s hand touch his, and he looks into those brilliant brown eyes as they call to him. It’s almost like he can sense what Tony’s asking for. He leans back down, forcing Tony’s body to bend with him. Just like his thrusts, he kisses Tony slow and deep.
Filling Tony's head was a visual of himself, head pressed against the pillow, hair matted with sweat, ass in the air, Steve's cock buried deep inside him, cum staining his thighs. To have this image of him projected by Steve through their bond, along with pure unfiltered possessiveness, Tony was overwhelmed by just how right it felt, to have his body at the complete mercy of Steve.
Steve chuckled, his warmth breath ghosting over the back of Tony’s neck. “You’re not prepared yet. I want to make sure you can take me.”
A wave of relief washes over Tony. FRIDAY. The only one that he was sure didn’t disappear. If anything, it’s a source of cold comfort. It takes everything in him to not cry.
Steve wants to say he’s sorry, but that’s the last thing either of them need. Instead, he lifts his hand to the side of Tony’s face and brings their lips together.
“You’ve been holding out on me, big guy,” Tony said, looking back up at Steve with a wink. “Don’t even know if this can fit.” Steve’s breath hitched at that line, a hand moving to touch Tony’s jaw.
“Why didn’t you get a new suit?” Tony brings up this question after Steve wonders about the new arc reactor. He gestures out to the city as he says, “It’s not like they couldn’t make you a new one. With their technology, it would have been amazing.”
Tony marched over to where Steve was. Noticing him, the blond looked up, and the sight of those blue eyes and warm smile almost broke Tony’s resolve. “We need to talk.”
Smiling, Steve walked over, standing in front of him. With both hands, Tony touched Steve’s face, his fingers slowly tracing the hard line of his jaw, the few wrinkles that had grown in the two years that he had last touched him like this. As he did this, Steve stared at him with such a tender look that he could barely breathe, hardly able to understand how he was lucky enough to have such a man.
“I’ve got you.” Steve said in a hushed tone, a sound that somehow relaxed Tony and made him worked up at the same time. He heard a bottle lid click open and a few seconds later, felt Steve’s finger back at his hole, now slick with lube that had Tony shivering. He could do nothing but let out a long moan as Steve pushed in one long finger, all the way up to the second knuckle. He moved his finger in and out slowly, letting Tony get used to the feeling.
“I made you bigger and stronger, sure. But the rest, that’s all you.” Dr Erskine points to him. “And if what the others told me is true, only someone like you would have done all those things.”
But when Tony looked up at Steve, a part of him knew that he wasn’t going to let go of him that easily, and neither would Steve. He wondered what it would be like if he actually married Steve.
“Oh really?” Natasha had her eyebrow raised, her voice in a tone that told Tony that she already knew everything. “About what?”
"Don't worry, sweetheart," Steve said, voice low and rough. Using his thumb, he swiped up some of the cum, pressing it back into Tony's hole. "I'm going to fill you up nice and good."
Steve can barely believe it, but after everything he’s seen and experienced in his life, nothing really seems impossible anymore.
Besides, it was only three days. It was just going to be like any other rut of Steve’s. He could wait three days.
Steve tosses the bottle of lube onto the bed. But he is in no rush. Tony is finally back after two years. He doesn’t know if what they’re about to do is going to be one-time thing or not. If it is, he has no intention of letting it end that quickly.
Once they reached the bedroom, Steve lowered Tony onto the bed, the latter watching as the former stood at the foot of the bed and slowly took off his leather jacket, revealing the t-shirt that barely contained his huge biceps and well-sculpted body. He grinned, knowing that Tony was enjoying the show, locking eyes with him as he crawled back up the bed, holding himself above Tony. He captured his lips in a slow, deep kiss, before kissing his way down Tony’s body, occasionally teasing the skin between his teeth hard enough to leave marks.
Tony couldn’t control the sounds that he made at this contact, trying his best to focus on kicking off his shoes and jeans without hitting Steve. Once that was done, he reached forward to pull on Steve’s shirt. Steve broke the kiss, tossing his shirt on the floor, followed by his own pants, briefs and shoes. Tony watched this little show, staring at the perfect body in front of him, getting impossibly more aroused when he saw Steve’s large cock, remembering how full he felt when it was inside him those two years ago.
Everything after that was a blur. Being welcomed back and hugged by everyone else. Carted off to the medical wing. He didn’t even have the energy to be amazed by Wakandan technology, how his wounds were seamlessly stitched up and made to look as good as new.
It starts off soft and simple, but then Tony crosses his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling him closer until he’s sitting in the blond’s lap. The kiss deepens, but now, neither of them are in a rush for this to go anywhere.
A pause, then, “Our kinds have existed for eons, Tony. I’m sure we’re not the first ones to have gotten together.”
The angel moved slightly away, and for a second, Tony caught a glimpse of those blue eyes going dark with pure hunger before Steve’s lips were on his, capturing him in a crushing and filthy kiss. Tony felt the raw energy behind it, and kissed back with just as much fervour, desire raging like a wildfire within him.
That was what things were like now between the two of them. The first couple of months after that night, things were extremely awkward, with neither of them even being able to say more than three words to each other. After that, with the help of the others, they eventually got over it, going back to being friends. But now, they’ve reached a point in their relationship where they do this playful flirting thing with each other, and as comfortable as Tony was with all of it, a small part of him couldn’t help but wish that the flirting would lead to something more.
For obvious reasons, Tony didn’t have said gland, but he knew that the alpha wolf in Steve wouldn’t be satisfied until it had made its mark. However, a werewolf bite was more than likely to be fatal to vampires, and that complicated things. There was only one real way to protect himself, and even then, Tony wasn't a hundred percent sure.
Beside him, he could hear the angel sigh, before saying, “One hundred and forty years.” Tony looked up at that, and Steve continued. “That’s how long I’ve waited to meet you. I know that’s nothing compared to our lives, or how long I’ve known you, but it’s long enough for me to know that what I feel is real. And now that you’re here, and you can finally see me after all this time, I know what it’s like being with you and... I don’t want to let this go.”
A second later, Tony realised how sappy he sounded. If anyone asked, he would have blamed it on the angel’s presence and his heavenly aura, but in reality, that was what he truly thought (although not in such a cheesy manner). And now that he had that thought in his head, it wouldn’t go away either. With that, his mind was made up.
Just as he was about to fall asleep, one last thought forced him back wide awake again. A vampire and a werewolf becoming mates should have been impossible, but they made it work, and by the looks of things, they share a very strong bond too. If that was possible, what if... “Wait. I can’t actually get pregnant right?”
Tony’s hands went up to grip Steve’s back, claws drawing blood as he was almost bent in half, Steve fucking him hard into the mattress. It was so different from earlier, but Tony loved it all the same, watching as the angel slowly lost his cool demeanour, the halo blurring as hair fell from its previous style, sticking to the sweat on his forehead.
Next was a box of donuts, attached with a card that said: ‘I donut know what I would do without you.’ “This is stereotyping,” Tony had said in response. “Yeah, but don’t you like donuts?” Rhodey asked. Tony kept quiet after that.
“Pick your jaw off the floor. I hate it when you drool all over the hardwood,” Natasha teased, to which Tony glared at her. She chuckled. “But seriously though, stop staring. You’re going to scare the customer away.”
Steve isn’t sure what to say next. “It’s okay” obviously won’t work. Hell, even he would punch himself for saying that. “We’ll get him back” just sounds like an empty promise.
“I love you,” Steve says it again, and watches as that expression takes over Tony’s face, as Tony clenches around him. Steve knows he’s right.
With no hesitation, Steve slowly pulled out before thrusting back in, the movement causing the bed to shift and creak below them. His speed picked up with every thrust, reaching a steady pace that left Tony flushed and panting. One particularly deep thrust had him gripping the sheets, moans escaping him as Steve shifted and hit right against his prostate.
There was no reply, and all Tony heard was Steve’s breathing. For a moment, Tony wondered if he had passed out. Then, the door swung open.
They went on to discuss Thor and Bruce’s relationship, and Tony was more than grateful that the attention was no longer on him. He sipped his drink and laughed with his friends, all the while feeling those blue eyes constantly on him.
Anything Tony wanted? All Tony wanted was for Steve to be his, and after decades, centuries even, of unknowingly repressing that want, he finally had him, and there was nothing more that Tony could ever want.
He looks at Steve. Hair, now longer than he remembers, in an absolute mess. A split lip, blood clotting into a single line. The Captain America suit, now dull and dirtied, torn in several places, sleeves rolled up to the forearms.
And so, Tony did what any self-respecting demon wouldn’t do: he grabbed the front of Steve’s leather jacket and pulled him forward until their lips crashed together.
