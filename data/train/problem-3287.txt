“Well…” Jack says. He rubs his palms over the knees of his jeans, gathering his thoughts. “It was… nothingness.” He shrugs, as if unsure how to explain it further. “Infinite nothingness.” Jack shakes his head, but he begins picking at his blanket, squinting thoughtfully, so Dean waits.
“What do you think about July 15?” Dean lists his reasons off on his fingers. “It’s two months from today, so if we let people know in the next week it should give ’em enough time to plan to get here. It’s a Thursday, so that gives people an excuse to take a few extra days off to relax, and they could stay through the weekend if they wanted. And it’s an easy date to remember.”
your memories?”
They lapse into silence, and Sam drifts to sleep listening to the chorus of insects outside the tent.
“Everyone was still pretty out of it when we were making a break for it, so I don’t think so,” Gabriel says, shaking his head.
Jack sits down at the table. “I’m fine,” he says, taking a bite of cereal. “I was very tired yesterday but I feel much better now.”
He gets up to wash the dishes, and Sam grabs a towel to dry things off. Given their situation, this chore is probably unnecessary, but the normality of it is soothing.
Sam smiles back, a little breathless. “Yeah.”
Embers flicker and catch.
Crowley’s eyebrows rise higher. “Oh, you think I’m that twitchy, shapeshifting little slime? If I were, I’d either kill you or throw you out of here.”
Limping, Dean finds his way off the beach.
. Some of the action sequences are a little ropy,” he admits, “but it’s a good one.”
Sam wraps her in an enormous hug, his eyes squeezed shut, and he holds her for a long moment.
The quiet of Death’s Library has nothing on the silence of the Empty.
“Today is a remarkable day,” Garth begins, speaking to their tiny assembly in his easy drawl, his eyes bright. “Today, we celebrate Dean and Castiel: two amazing individuals. We celebrate their profound love for one another. We celebrate them as they take this next step in their journey through life together.
“First of all,” Crowley says, grabbing Dean’s arm. Dean glares at his hand and Crowley drops it. “I don’t know what use Gabriel will be,
Her face is aggrieved in the light of a half-moon speeding across the sky. “When I was shut away, Lucifer took on the Mark. I pity him. He became evil, yes, but the first act of evil was Chuck’s.”
Castiel steps closer and his fingertips, featherlight, find the edge of the shallow slash on Dean’s throat. He pushes Dean’s collar aside, exposing the length of the ugly mark.
“You get back here,” he whispers.
Throughout the night, as Castiel chats with their guests, he catches glimpses of Dean, and their eyes often meet, as if Dean is constantly searching him out, too. It becomes a subtle, flirtatious game between them, one with an intense undercurrent. At some point Dean sheds his jacket and bow tie, and the sight of him in his vest, with the top two buttons of his dress shirt undone, is making it difficult for Castiel to focus on the conversations he’s a part of. Castiel suspects Dean is aware of this, and it’s confirmed when Dean gives him a knowing grin.
“I was—for quite some time,” Crowley says thoughtfully. He gives Dean a considering look and opens his mouth, but then shuts it again.
This door isn’t completely closed, and Castiel wonders if it’s an indication of anything. If it’s an invitation.
“Come in.”
He reaches the valley floor. Breathless, his heart racing, Dean draws his angel blade and starts running.
“Jack, wait!” Sam gets up and staggers for the front door, alarm flooding him.
Because it’s always been about fear. Fear of change, fear of losing the people he loves, fear of making himself vulnerable.
“No,” Mary says, shaking her head. “To be honest, I think they probably destroyed each other after that portal closed.”
Fury is an inferno inside of him, burning high and screaming hot until the heat pressing in on Dean from outside beats it back down into smoldering embers… And then the flames are reignited by a new memory—or one that he’s revisited a hundred times already.
Will anyone be waiting for him?
He pushes aside apprehension and redirects the boat, nudging it close enough for him to see that it’s some
In a minute.
Lucifer’s mask slips, his face twisting with rage, and then a loud, sharp
“Or all of the above,” Eileen finishes, smiling ruefully.
When he’s ready to go, Dean turns to Gabriel. “I’ll see you later,” he says, and Gabriel gives him a firm nod.
“Then why’d you show up?” Sam asks bitterly.
When he goes into the kitchen to greet the early riser, he finds it’s not an early riser at all.
He is pulled along by the invisible current… and pushed by rage.
So Dean tucks the pendant of Jack’s grace into his T-shirt and leaves his extra layers, belt, and angel blade on the sand.
“You really are nice and warm,” Dean says, pressing more tightly into Castiel’s side. He lifts a hand and strokes it lazily down the edge of Castiel’s wing. He freezes mid-movement, then looks at Castiel and says, “You gotta let me call you Hot Wings.”
Dean pulls a chair up to the bedside and sits down. “I know a little bit about the Empty, but you’ve been there twice, now,” Dean says. “Anything you could tell me would be real helpful.”
He doesn’t care.
They have basic gear like matches, sleeping bags, a tent, a first aid kit, some canned goods, metal water bottles, bowls, utensils, and a couple of multitools; clothing, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, a razor, and shaving cream; a notebook and pens, and—just in case—a laptop, cell phone, and the respective charging cables. Many of these items will be easy to replace or replenish if needed.
Standing across from him, Castiel tilts his head back. “The stars?” he asks, puzzled.
“Hey,” Jack says with a smile.
He puts his phone away, refocusing on his laptop, and it occurs to him that it’s a little sad that neither of them had been able to answer the question.
“I remember,” Sam says, and Dean is nodding.
“Did he say where he and Jack were going this time?”
He takes off his belt and returns the angel blade to its mount on the wall, then slowly shrugs out of his jacket. It needs to be washed—a few times, probably—but for now he hangs it up, running a hand gently over the sleeve. The handprint might come out if he soaks it in hydrogen peroxide, but even as the thought occurs to Dean, he knows he won’t do it.
Dean recalls the sight of Castiel in a lake, hands raised, and then his head sinking beneath the surface. Only it wasn’t Castiel, then; the Leviathans had already killed him. Dean turns away from the water, drawing a shaky breath.
Castiel sags with relief and collapses on the ground next to him, and they both lie there, breathing hard.
Dean’s fingers find Castiel’s dangling tie and he grips it, tugging slightly as he leans forward, closing the distance between them.
Their hands are ripped apart.
Castiel grins and pulls Jack into a hug.
His heart rate is climbing steadily and his breaths are coming short and shallow. Any thought of calling out into the darkness dies, crushed beneath the weight of this place, his voice stolen by the silence forcing its way down his throat.
“I mean, I know you wanna…
Dean closes his mouth, but he’s still frowning.
“Dean, what the hell?”
Even the worst decisions Cas has made—working with Crowley, agreeing to be Lucifer’s vessel, killing Billie—were all things he’d done in an effort to protect Dean, protect his family.
There is nothing in the forest that resembles a path, and he’s not moving in anything close to a straight line. The terrain is difficult and uneven, and he frequently has to pick his way around obstructions—impassable vegetation or clusters of boulders. Sometimes he has to backtrack when he finds himself at the edge of a deep ravine or a hill too steep to clamber up.
That night after Jack has gone upstairs to his room, Castiel and Dean work to create an updated to-do list. Dean is sprawled on the sofa with the old list, and Castiel sits in his armchair with a notepad.
sound. It’s years before he learns the correct pronunciation.
I think that it would be nice if you and Sam didn’t have to worry about saving the world so often.
“There’s… there’s something going on, here.” Dean is cradling the phone between his shoulder and ear now, digging through his duffel for his gun. “I lost some time. And the fire’s weird.”
There’s a woman on this one, cowering and weeping. Dean’s never seen her before, has no idea who she is.
Jack takes a step forward. “After we talked last night, I had an idea.” He pulls a long, sturdy necklace chain out of his pocket, and hanging from it is a small glass vial. A white-blue light swirls serenely within it.
puke.”
They part, just enough for Dean to press his palm to Castiel’s cheek, and Castiel places his hand over Dean’s heart. Their noses brush, and Castiel exhales against Dean’s lips, and their mouths find each other.
Dean glances at Jack. They still don’t know how he’d survived detonating in the Empty—or how his grace and soul had remained intact. He still has his wings, but they’d been damaged by the detonation, and his powers are gone. The kid looks like a kicked dog. He’s wearing the same frown as Sam, only sadder somehow, the corners of his mouth turned down.
“Listen,” he says, “you two got this. You’re gonna find Michael.” He looks both of them in the eye in turn. “Take care of each other.”
Even before the kiss, though, things had changed the moment Castiel had allowed—invited—Dean to touch his wings.
Dean climbs into the boat and collapses on the floorboards with a grunt, soaking wet and breathing hard as the fear coursing through him gradually dies down.
Jack looks at him for a long moment before he whispers, “What if you don’t come back?”
Dean pulls onto the access road and drives slowly through the woods, aware that his breaths are becoming shallower with every rotation of the tires.
Eventually he makes it to the outcropping he’d been aiming for the first time. He pulls himself up onto the rocks and sits as far back as he can. His hands tingle uncomfortably with the vague notion of how high up he is, but he keeps his eyes closed and takes deep breaths.
“Second of all,” Crowley says, “you need to be careful.” Crowley’s expression is grave, and there’s no trace of snark. “You have to realize you and Sam and Castiel are the reason a lot of people are in here. And I can’t be the only one who was woken up.”
Castiel looks up at him.
Eileen beams at him. “I love
Dean finishes off the water and scrubs a hand over his face. He’s fucking starving.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Yes, you are.
Sam goes to greet Castiel and Gabriel, and Dean finds Jack and pulls him into a tight hug.
Almost.
With the angel blade cleaned and stowed again in his belt, he follows the pull, moving along a sandy track of sorts that borders a dark, imposing cliff face. Although the mist obscures everything beyond a certain point, Dean senses there are mountains towering over him.
“Great,” Jack says, beaming.
“You fucking lied to me.” The words burst from Dean, startling him. He hasn’t said a word for days. Or maybe it’s been a week… or weeks? He really has no idea, and there’s no way to know for sure.
far away. We’d still be on rotation for hunts and everything, but… we could do other things, too.”
“I see,” Castiel says.
How long has his best friend been in love with him?
What does he want for himself? Dean’s smile fades as he thinks about the question.
“You think he’ll show?” Sam asks softly, breaking a silence that has lasted at least an hour.
But it hadn’t stopped Castiel from trying, over and over, for years. And his last words to Dean had been one final attempt.
And the small stack of photographs sitting next to Sam’s backpack.
“Sammy,” Dean murmurs.
Over his shoulder, Castiel hears a tiny sniffle from Mary. He notices Sam blinking hard, and Eileen swiping at her eyes.
And all the while, just as Gadreel said, rage simmers under his skin. It’s a pale imitation of what it felt like to bear the Mark, but it’s close enough—and constant enough—that Dean is unsettled.
“Alright, relax,” Dean says with a smile.
“I’m gonna teach you how to sail this thing, so you can get across that sea and look for Castiel on the other side. While you’re doing that, I’m gonna slip into the angry mob and see if I can’t find out what ol’ Luci’s up to. If you’re walking into a trap, I’ll be there to snatch you out of it. And if you’re not, great—we’ll meet up and make our escape.” He pauses, and his face becomes grave. “We can’t let Lucifer get out.”
Gadreel is the one to break it.
“You know,” Sam says, “Mom’s thinking of moving out of the bunker, too, getting her own place near us.”
“Make whatever preparations you need to,” Death says, “and return when you’re ready. In the meantime I have some reading to do.” Death pulls Chuck’s book toward him, and Dean, Sam, and Jack head for the exit. “Oh, and—do refrain from mentioning me outside of this room.” They all nod their understanding.
belong to
“Hi.”
Hand raised, Gabriel cuts him off. “I said I’m not going with you, not that I won’t help you.”
“They happily followed me here, but I can’t hold them back.” Lucifer shrugs, pretending to be regretful. “So you can either stay here and get torn to pieces, and maybe we all get out anyway… or you can accept my help, we make our getaway, and all it costs is letting me out.”
And then, of course, there’s the memory of pulling Castiel into his arms, and seeing his eyes open, and nothing could be more real than that.
On his way down into the ravine, Dean spies a route through the undergrowth that he hadn’t been able to see at ground level or during the precarious climb.
“Let’s get back to you two,” Chuck says, waving a hand. “You were clearly up to something. It’s the Winchester way: always a plan, always some way out. The whole ‘We’ll figure it out, you and me, just like we always do,’ thing. So, again: where’ve you been? Go ahead,” Chuck says with a smile, “tell me what you’ve got.”
Over the past three days, he and Jack have conducted a systematic and exhaustive search through every room, book, box, file, and piece of paper contained in the bunker. Hell, they’d even found a secret passageway, not shown on any of the blueprints.
What if this is the state Gabriel’s in? Or Cas?
Dean stands wearily, a small sigh escaping him, and he tosses a crumpled bill on the table next to the coffee, cold and untouched.
There’s also the fact that Dean has no clue how to sail.
“Got it,” Jack says, nodding.
The desert that Dean’s soul has created is a vast stretch of scrubland: flat, hard-packed earth studded with creosote bushes, yucca shrubs, cholla cactuses, and the odd scattering of boulders. Everything ripples, mirage-like, in the heat rising off the ground. As in the forest, there are no animals here—nothing living except for the plants, and Dean.
He decides it can wait until he’s caught his breath, so he closes his eyes and leans his head back.
Dean. There’s his own voice, too, reminding him that he’s responsible for the trap they fell into, in the first place.
So that’s that.
And Castiel responds that the blame for the Apocalypse doesn’t lie with him, but the fate of the world does—Dean might have started things, but he’s also the only one who can finish them.
“Are you feeling alright?”
He lets the truth in.
But the world can wait a few more seconds.
Dean shakes his head. “Nah, we’re not having any speeches.” Jack appears relieved. “No speeches, no color schemes, no… cutesy cake toppers. No burlap, no bunting, no—”
And no sign that Dean’s returned, either.
“We were very close,” Castiel tells them. “Amara and I traveled universes together. She told me about what came before me, taught me about life and death. She showed me everything she made.”
Neither of them say anything for a long time.
Yes. I’m watching a documentary about ancient burial customs.
“They won’t be here for a bit,” he says.
Alastair yanks his hand from Dean’s throat, hissing, and Dean takes a deep, ragged breath, his vision clearing at the same time he makes a sloppy fist and swings. He manages to hit Alastair in the jaw, hard enough to topple him.
Jack appears to think about this for a long time. Finally, he says quietly, “So maybe he’s just as lost as we are.”
But it’s the colors that shock him: azure sky and emerald grass and in between, a million wildflowers: golden yellow, pale purple, vivid red.
This isn’t what Castiel was expecting. He lowers his blade slightly and says, “We warded everything.”
Dean climbs up the other side of the gully with some difficulty, digging his hands into the dirt and trying not to imagine coming into contact with another buried sleeper.
They wait an interminable time, but it’s not as though they have anything else to do. Dean clasps his hands and rubs one thumb back and forth. Although he’s relieved there’s another heavy hitter in the game, Dean can’t let himself be hopeful. Even if the original Death was never anything like Billie, there’s no guarantee he’ll be on their side.
Sam’s heart leaps, and he grins at her. “I was going to tell you that you don’t have to say it back.”
So Dean finally exhumes it all, and the pain of the words replaying in his mind nearly stops him in his tracks. But he breathes and pushes through it and he keeps going.
But on the off-chance they’re able to keep him from knowing their plans, it’s worth doing whatever they can.
“It was a… close shave,” Dean says, swallowing and smiling weakly. He takes a step away from Castiel.
But of course he hasn’t.
Cas will be fine.
Amara adds, “After Chuck locked me away, he found and destroyed many of the worlds I’d first created, but I believe there may be some left. I’d like to visit them again.”
“Come on, what do you say?” Lucifer gestures between them. “I mean, this is what we do, right?”
Dean draws an unsteady breath, bracing himself, and then he takes another step.
The door opens; dimly Sam remembers the doorbell camera has motion detection.
The mainsheet.
“They saw their memories,” Castiel says. “I restored them.”
He scrubs a hand down his face, gives himself a minute, and then stands up. Time to go get some fresh air.
Dean bristles. “Now hang on a minute—”
Dean sees he’s veered too close to one of the crags that tower over the tundra, so he redirects himself toward the center of the plain. He takes a dozen steps before he realizes he’d been following the pull.
have any thoughts on whether it’s appropriate to walk into your own wedding reception with an erection?”
Dean looks over at Jack and feels a swell of affection at the awe on his face. He glances at Castiel, but his eyes are on the sky.
His knee buckles.
He finds a simple tutorial on how to make a sword frog, and as he cuts up one of his other belts, he murmurs to the woman on the screen, “When we bring you back, I’m gonna buy you a beer.”
“I’m guessing he hasn’t answered,” Jack says flatly.
Michael’s expression softens in astonishment, his mouth dropping open and his eyes becoming distant. He presses a hand to his chest, then murmurs breathlessly, “Please excuse me.” He gets to his feet and strides off toward the edge of the clearing.
Yeah everything’s fine. We’re pulled over
Sam makes a face. “Please tell me you’re not serious.”
“Jack,” Sam says, voice hushed with excitement. “This whole time… we’ve been keeping to the wilderness because that’s where we feel safest, right?” Jack is nodding—Sam can see he’s already there. “But if you were Michael… where would you go to feel safe? Where would you go if you felt lost, and needed direction?”
“Yes, we have quite the mess on our hands, haven’t we?” Death sits back in his chair. “Chuck has destroyed the other worlds, absorbed Amara and her power, and eliminated most of the earth’s living beings.” He looks at Sam and then Dean, unblinking. “I imagine it’s nice to have a day off from being the world’s primary source of chaos.”
“Don’t touch him,” he snaps.
While the sleepers seem to be completely unaffected by the harsh environment, Dean is struggling.
And that was exactly what had led them to the dungeon. If only he hadn’t gotten so angry about Chuck, been so bent on killing something.
“Semi-retirement? Where are you guys getting your info from? I’m not ‘semi-retired,’” Dean says indignantly.
“I was there,” Castiel says. “At the very beginning. I’m an archangel.”
Dean tells Castiel that he can’t do it. Tells him to find someone else. He turns his face away, tears slipping from his eyes.
When he gets to the top he dusts off his hands and observes that Crowley is still standing on the other bank, with apparently no interest in following him to the other side. “What’s next for you?” Dean asks.
“Hey, Jack, how you feeling, after yesterday?”
“Well, awesome,” Dean says.
something?
Dean lets him go and steps back, suddenly unable to speak. He’s still flooded with adrenaline, and a hundred emotions are crashing through him. There are so many things he needs to tell Castiel, but he doesn’t know where to begin.
“Books we can read. Jack, we gotta get back to the States.”
There is a rustling sound somewhere behind him; it’s a sound he knows well.
Afterward, it’s time for dessert. One of the buffet lines is laden with pies of every conceivable kind, and Dean has Steven take a picture of it.
He murmurs, “I don’t know if I’m the person you think I am… But I want to be. And I’m sure as hell gonna try.”
Outside, Dean touches Castiel’s arm, jogging him from his reverie. “Come on,” he says, grabbing the duffel and nodding toward the stairs.
Eventually, of course, he comes across a body.
“Right, yeah. ‘Emotional few days,’” Dean says.
“Castiel, do you take Dean to be your husband?”
Warm enough to say
They come to a sudden stop and Sam falls, landing on pavement. He opens his eyes on a brick church. It’s nighttime.
A man—
“I thought you were Gabriel,” Dean says, turning to walk back to Castiel, who hasn’t moved at all.
The DJ works on setting up her booth at the head of the room as the meal gets underway. Their guests are seated at twenty-five circular tables positioned around the tent. He recognizes people from all over: Jesse and Cesar Cuevas have come from New Mexico; Aaron Bass, not accompanied by the Golem, has flown in from Europe; a couple of hunters who work as Park Rangers in Denali are sharing a table with a rowdy group from Virginia.
He says this in a matter-of-fact way, but Dean still feels a stab of guilt. If he’d gotten there five minutes sooner this wouldn’t have happened. It also wouldn’t have happened if Dean hadn’t kicked him out of the bunker.
Gabriel inclines his head. “My pleasure, believe me.”
“What,” Sam says, “an empty planet isn’t
Castiel blinks. “‘Us’?”
“No!” Alex laughs softly and turns on the stove light so they’re not in the dark. “I’m gonna have a snack and go to bed. Just figured I’d make it for anyone who wanted it.”
Their footsteps echo loudly on the stairs, the bunker just as dead now as it had been when Sam and Dean had first found it, and they make their way out into the empty world.
Dean notices Castiel’s gaze, and says, “It’s almost time.”
Sam closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
Dean sits down on the edge of his bed and rubs his face with both hands. If this is his last chance for sleep, he’d better take it. He stretches out and moves to turn off his lamp, and his eyes fall on his jacket hanging by the door.
And Sam, his voice soft:
He turns back to his phone to find a new text from Castiel.
Amara rests a glittering hand on his arm. “I think you were susceptible to his influence because he helped create you. But it’s not your fault.” Michael clenches his jaw and shakes his head, and Amara says, “Please forgive yourselves.
The photo session ends up being surprisingly comfortable. Nikita and Steven give them gentle direction, but for the most part it feels to Castiel like he and Dean are simply spending time together while they happen to be having their picture taken. They talk, and laugh, and kiss, and the sun sinks toward the horizon.
“Fuck,” he says again. Dean turns back to the sailboat.
“Thank you,” Kaia tells Jack with a small smile, and she nods at Sam and Dean.
Dean says, “We got Jack back, you got a lead on Michael. We’re all here, we’re all safe.” He pauses. “I gotta say… it made me nervous—you going back upstairs, with that SOS broadcasting.”
“When I was a sentry… I was not allowed into the garden. I did not mind, because the sun shone over the walls, and I felt fortunate to be able to enjoy that much of it.” He opens his eyes again and looks at Dean. “I hope you are able to fix whatever it is that has been broken.”
Jack had turned to Sam. “How about… when he gets back, we give him a hint, and see if he finds it within a day.”
“‘Flashed’?” Dean raises his eyebrows. “You were gone for like, ten minutes.”
It’s the same smile that was on his face when he’d said,
“He’s gone now,” Sam says. “It’s okay. You’re safe—we’re safe.” He signs
“He’s a good kid,” Gabriel says.
With difficulty, Dean tears his gaze away to look at Castiel. Castiel reads the unspoken question in Dean’s eyes, and in a low voice that’s almost a growl, he says, “Yes.”
He isn’t worried about dehydration, sunburn, heat stroke, or damage to his eyes—he’s been walking for what feels like days, now, and none of those things have become an issue. But it’s
As Dean makes his way across the wasteland, the bitter wind exacerbates his every pain. Lurid bruises bloom on the back of his injured hand, and though the swelling has gone down, his fingers are stiff and clumsy. The air burns his face, his ears, his sore throat. His jaw aches from clamping his teeth together to stop them from chattering, but he shivers constantly. There’s an excruciating tension compressing his spine, everything inside of him contracted against the cold. His feet are so numb that walking is difficult, and his knee throbs, always feeling like it’s going to give out on him.
He just starts marching again.
Dean is shrugging on his coat, and he looks over at Castiel, who’s leaning against the kitchen counter watching Dean. Light is streaming in through the windows, the shadows of the leaves on the trees are dancing on the walls, and the blue of Castiel’s eyes burns into him. Something about this moment feels so delicate that Dean can’t bring himself to answer with his usual flippant bravado. “I will,” he says, holding Castiel’s eyes for a few long seconds.
As they’re wrapping up, Dean suddenly gets the idea to do a
“Yeah, you were. Admit it.”
Amara gestures at the hourglass; the upper bulb is almost empty. Smoke billows in the sky and shrinks away.
“Balance,” Dean says, voice flat. “Because the fact that you’re the one walking and talking, and not her—that’s
The fact is, their lives
, anymore. The question remains, but it’s become entirely unimportant. All he can think about is the deal, and he turns recent memories over and over in his mind, reexamining and reframing them.
from Chuck.
“No, you don’t need your gun.” Dean can hear the eye roll in Claire’s voice.
Dean swivels on the stool and his eyes land on the sink. He laughs softly. “Washin’ dishes at the end of the world. Had no idea how things were gonna go.” He looks over at Sam. “But we had each other.” He smiles and takes a drink of his beer. “Now here we are.”
Dean smiles and goes over to the cupboard. “Nah, it’s fine. You can hang out here or do whatever you want. I’ll let you know when it’s ready.”
messed up. It’s no use thinking about what he wants. He types out the only answer that feels true.
Panic sets in. Dean pries at Alastair’s fingers, kicking wildly, but Alastair is immovable and he squeezes even harder. Stars begin to cloud Dean’s vision, and his eyes widen in horror as Alastair’s face becomes a gaping, eyeless hole, an abyss of swarming, ash-black shadows and writhing fractals of bone.
“Hey,” Dean says firmly. “It’s okay. I get why you did it.” He pauses, then says, “I’m not gonna lie, it fucked me up for a while, once I remembered… what I’d done. And just remembering all over again what I caused.”
Dean glances behind him and finds a chair. They settle in, and Death begins skimming Chuck’s book. From where Dean’s sitting, the pages appear blank, but Death’s eyes are moving back and forth.
plans,” Charlie says with a smile. “Money is no longer an issue. For any of us.”
Finally, he says, “Jack… I can’t ever take back the things I’ve said to you, or how I treated you in the past.” Dean swallows hard and looks Jack in the eye. “But I want to tell you how sorry I am, for all of it.”
Sam brushes this off with a shake of his head. “I dunno about that.”
Dean’s mouth drops open in surprise, and he exchanges a glance with Sam and Jack.
Dean takes possibly the fastest shower of his life. Afterward, he fixes his hair carefully, and then messes it up a little so it doesn’t look like he spent as much time on it as he actually did. The cabin really is incredibly warm, so he pulls on jeans and a clean T-shirt and walks barefoot back to the living room, where it appears as though Castiel hasn’t moved a muscle since he left.
So Dean grips harder, feeling the firm tendon beneath the feathers, and smooths his hands over the insides of the wings. He runs his fingers through Cas’ feathers, revels in the way they feel against his palms.
He grabs his laptop and goes online. Much of the internet is still up, but segments of it have begun to go dark. Fortunately, probably thanks to Google’s massive servers, YouTube hasn’t been affected yet.
Castiel makes no reply, and Dean squeezes some antiseptic cream onto his palm. “Rub that in,” he says, gesturing, then turns to the first aid kit for a bandage. “You hurt anywhere else?” he asks, glancing at Castiel.
Dean, mired up to his waist, screams over his shoulder, “Crowley!” He turns back to Castiel, panicked. “He’s looking for Gabriel. We need him!”
“Then how come I was able to touch them earlier?” Dean asks.
Chuck.
And on and on.
And then Cas is there, trying to reach Dean, and that’s when cold fury takes over. Cas doesn’t understand that Dean can’t be saved, so Dean needs to
It looks like malachite.
Michael turns, then, glaring at Sam. “Adam is gone.” His eyes glitter with unshed tears, and Sam is startled to recognize the grief and sorrow there. He’s carried it in his chest since he found Eileen’s phone on the sidewalk. He’s seen it on Jack’s face when he watched the videos of his mother. It was in Dean’s voice when he’d said,
They lie down again, and Dean presses into Castiel’s side.
(it was one of the first words he’d asked Eileen to teach him), but because many of the ways to say it require two hands, and he’s holding his coffee. He sips it and then says with wounded dignity, “I’m getting married. A man can only deal with so much stress.”
“No,” Castiel says with a shake of his head. “He spent an hour showing me his rock collection yesterday. I think whatever he’s doing, he’s just… learning.”
Castiel brushes a hand over Dean’s hair. “Look,” he says softly.
. It’s not distinct words so much as concepts, infused with a combination of hope and want.
“That’s different,” Kaia says. “School is a thing you talk about with people. Dreamwalking is not.”
“Everyone dreams when they sleep, even if they don’t remember it,” Kaia says.
Dean shakes his head. “I didn’t go to South Carolina for a hunt. I went there to do a workshop.”
“Before we go in there,” Sam says, subdued, “we have some stuff we need to say. Jack?”
Still Cas. And god, he’s so beautiful.
“It was good!” Jack goes to the refrigerator and removes the pitcher of lemonade, then goes to the cupboard for a glass. “Did you two have a nice week?”
Overhead, feathery clouds swirl through a crimson sunset, and Castiel smiles sadly. “Then you know that I broke.”
that he’d found in a California desert town’s used bookstore. But after a while, he realizes he’s been reading the same page over and over again; his thoughts keep drifting.
Yesterday while walking the property, Dean had discovered the remnants of the private access road leading to the bunker’s garage.
Inside, the place is lit with a thousand candles. Michael is striding up the central aisle, and Jack is charging after him. Sam catches up to him and stops him with a hand on his shoulder.
“That’s why you can’t be killed,” Sam says suddenly. “And why Lucifer was able to bind you.”
“Well, damn.” Dean opens the book and flips through it. Every recipe has a picture, and some of them do look pretty tempting.
It’s real. The last thing he was expecting, but real.

could see that they’d go to the ends of the earth—and beyond—for each other, but for some reason, they couldn’t.” There is a ripple of soft laughter.
And quite suddenly, the path Dean has been following comes to an end, presenting him with an entirely different landscape, something it shouldn’t be possible for this lush forest to border so neatly. As he stands within the shade of the trees looking out onto the expanse before him, he feels something in him stirring, sharp and jagged and comforting in its familiarity.
“Well, this is just fantastic news. Congratulations, you two!” Beaming, he claps each of them on a shoulder, then shakes them vigorously, which elicits a

Castiel releases Crowley and steps back, but holds his blade between them. “What are you talking about?” he asks, eyes narrowed. He folds his wings and the hellhounds stop growling.
series if you’re in the US/using American or Imperial measurements,
“I don’t care.”
So they stick to convenience stores, with their small selections of long-life foods and general essentials. Sporting goods stores have helped fill the gaps in their inventory, and intact, accessible libraries and bookstores are exciting finds. (Somehow, out of everything they take for themselves, the books are what feel the most like theft.)
A breeze slips into the room and the candle’s flame shudders. The sound of the rain is steady.
coursing through his veins. He remembers clutching the blade in his blood-slick fist, striking her burned-out face again and again, until the bones caved in.
Gabriel shakes his head, and Castiel says, “Other than that, no.”
Crowley tilts his head in consideration, then gives an approving nod.
The water is surprisingly warm, but then most of the pool is bathed in the light of the unmoving sun. Dean submerges himself and comes up again, groaning with relief.
Her gaze settles on Chuck.
A woman’s screams fill Dean’s mind, and he’s back in that windowless room. Fire dances at the edge of his vision, shimmers in the blood pooled on the floor.
“I used to think maybe I wasn’t built for what we have together. But it turns out I am—you just have to find the right person. And I know the way we found each other wasn’t anything pretty, and the road to where we are now was rough, but I wouldn’t change a single thing about it, and if I had to, I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat. Because I can’t live without you.” Dean frowns down at the letter, at the idea he’s just brushed against. “I think you know that, but I’m telling you just in case you somehow didn’t know.”
He feels it again, stronger, and next to him the branches of a creosote bush bob gently.
Always, Gabriel makes Dean repeat things back to him, until they get to the point where Gabriel listens as Dean describes and demonstrates each concept himself.
Dean makes a non-committal sound.
“It’s been a privilege, over the years, to bear witness to the incredible connection between Dean and Cas.” Sam grins and tilts his head. “And a little aggravating, because there were times when
“Would you like that?” Castiel asks.
Dean inhales deeply and his eyes sting; he wants to blame it on the cold air, but he can’t. He tilts his head back, blinking until his eyes clear, and gazes up at the sky. There’s a sliver of moon rising opposite the red-streaked clouds that follow the sun as it sets.
“Let’s see,” Donna says, and she lists everyone off on her fingers. “I’ll bunk with Jody—if that’s okay with you, Jodes,” and Jody nods. “Patience is sharing Alex’s room while she’s home. Claire and Kaia share, and I think the girls were talking about Jack sleeping on the floor in there anyway. That leaves the pullout sofa. So, yep, we got the space!” She gives Dean a sunny smile, and he can’t help but smile back.
Everyone is gone.
On other days, Alastair reacquaints him with the rack, the whip, the knife. This often coincides with the times when Dean returns to himself, horrified by what he finds himself doing, by the shocking amount of blood, by how cold he feels. Despite the closed door, Alastair always knows when this happens. It doesn’t happen very often now, but they’ve never stopped locking the door.
“I was a little afraid,” Jack admits.
He recalls a museum gift shop, and a huge bin full of polished stones. Sam is pressed into his side as they dig through it, entertaining themselves while their dad talks to an employee.
“Yeah, Jack?” Sam’s voice is just as quiet, and it occurs to him that there’s no reason for it to be—they’re literally the only two people in the world. And yet the night seems to insist upon quietness. It’s comforting, in a way; Sam’s ancestors must have felt this way, too, going back millennia.
“At the time,” Death says, “I was unaware of what was happening, but he found me and manipulated my memories.”
For the most part, the master bedroom is Dean’s. Many of the things he kept in his room at the bunker have their own designated places around the house: his record collection is in the living room, and weapons and case-related materials are kept in the study downstairs. The bedroom is minimally furnished: there’s a dresser, an armchair next to the window draped with a blanket, and a bookshelf.
They lie together, and Castiel drapes his wing over Dean. Dean combs his fingers gently through Cas’ feathers, and he thinks about home. Their home. A little farmhouse in the country, no more than what they need, with the people they love most close by. A place where Jack can talk to the plants and keep his rock collection, where Castiel reads quietly, where they all eat dinner together. Where Dean can pull in the driveway, knowing they’ll be there.
Dimly, Dean hears the lock on the door sliding open, and then Alastair is standing over his shoulder.
“I saw your wings,” Dean says suddenly. “In the Empty—after you took your memories back. And during the fight with Chuck. I saw everyone’s wings.” He frowns and adds, “I don’t think Sam could, though.”
“Hey!” Dean barks, and signs it, too, drawing both of their attention. There’s as much irritation in the flapping motion of his hand as there is on his face. Castiel and Eileen trade a glance before refocusing on Dean.
“Please,” Dean says. The word tastes like sulphur and his voice is a crackling bonfire, but he’s so cold inside. The man drags his gaze back to Dean’s face, and Dean begins to weep, sinking to his knees.
When the song ends, she hugs him, then goes to find Jody and Donna. Castiel slips off the dance floor. Glancing behind him, he sees Claire dancing with Kaia now, but then he is immediately swept up by a group of people offering their congratulations.
“I warn you,” Death says, “I can only point you in a direction. If I were to leave this place, Chuck would become aware of my return, and I believe it’s in our best interests to keep that quiet for now.”
Sam turns to Jack, smiling. “You did great.”
“Yeah. If you’re okay with it,” Dean says. “I’d really like that.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. He clears his throat and adjusts his shirt, feeling in some way like they’ve just been caught. “Yeah, I’m alright,” he says.
“Thousands,” Gadreel says. Dean draws a slow breath, and then Gadreel adds, “They are following you.”
He doesn’t want to believe it, but he knows it would be stupid to dismiss the possibility completely.
He glances over at Castiel and finds that his eyes are closed, and for a second he appears to lean into Dean’s touch. But then his eyes fly open and he steps backward, pulling his wing away from Dean’s hand. “Yes,” he says, and there’s a momentary wildness in his eyes before he shutters his expression.
“We need to watch out for rift openings, too,” Gabriel says softly. “Can’t let those dickbags wreck our world.”
The world is broken because he’s broken.
“Be quiet,” Castiel says, leaning over Dean to tuck him in carefully.
This high up, he’s able to stow the blade and use the rocks as zigzagging steps up. They’re covered in snow and ice and he painstakingly evaluates each one, sometimes for minutes at a time. He’s wary of having to renegotiate his path, since it would require him to look back the way he came; he’s avoided looking down so far and the last thing he needs is to become paralyzed with fear at this height.
“I never…” Dean swallows and takes a deep breath. “I never thought of your wings as a part of you,” he says. “I know that sounds stupid, but you know—I’m not always the brightest guy—”
Sam turns to Amara. “If he was so concerned about his secret getting out, why didn’t he stop us from setting you free? You tried,” Sam says to Death.
“Yep,” Dean says, rinsing a whisk.
In the days that follow the capsize, Dean doesn’t risk a dead run again. His earlier panic has subsided into a gnawing anxiety, just one more thing to wear away at him. There’s a constant ache in his hands and arms, and in his clenched jaw. But he navigates carefully, because he can’t afford to be reckless anymore.
Unsettled, Dean says, “Cas… what’s going on?”
The portraits of the wedding party are taken—a dizzying number of group and pair configurations, with formal poses and relaxed ones—and then it’s time to go to the reception.
, along with the thumbs-up emoji. She sends the smiling horned emoji back.
Dean isn’t sure if what’s happening is an expression of angelic power, or Chuck’s, or both of them combined. He can’t tell which side is winning.
Castiel clenches his jaw and breathes out sharply, irritation written on his face. “What are you, a child? It’s freezing. How long have you been out here?”
He gives himself a minute, then lowers himself back into the water, takes a breath, and ducks under the water to come up again under the upturned hull. He feels around in the darkness for the centerboard and, with some difficulty, manages to push it back through the hull.
And Castiel is striding into a barn, sparks flying.
Dean frowns. “What?” But he’s remembering what Castiel said to the Entity:
“I…” Dean frowns, trying to think of where to start.
Alex raises her eyebrows, as if rising to a challenge. “Those brownies you had last night? Vegan.”
If you want to leave kudos or a comment, or
“Thank you for welcoming me into your family,” Castiel says. “Jack, too.” Mary follows his gaze to where Jack is keeping Gertie and the twins entertained with shadow puppets while chatting with Garth and Bess. She smiles.
“Yes, definitely,” Eileen says, her index finger emphatic.
“All the time, or just when you move it?”
Castiel tastes like how it feels to stand in a summer thunderstorm: wet and warm and bursting with the wild urge to laugh. He tastes like the second breath you take after coming back from the dead, the one where your brain has caught up to your body and it remembers:
Daylight dims as roiling black clouds gather overhead with impossible speed. A violent wind picks up, the trees tossing their branches as if in fear of the celestial showdown that’s begun.
They both know he’s not talking about Gabriel.
“Well… you might wanna get some fresh air, at least.”
“I never thought I’d be able to have a life like the one we have, and I also never thought I’d be so excited to settle down. I never thought I’d be the kinda guy who writes letters like this, but I love you so damn much, you make me wanna be that guy.” Dean smiles a little, his crow’s feet deepening, but he keeps his eyes on the page.
They dump him on the floor and Alastair crouches beside him. His eyes bore into Dean’s and he says, “Do a good job.” He presses a blade into Dean’s hand and leaves, the door slamming behind him. A lock slides into place.
And then Dean’s fingers curl around the back of Castiel’s neck, and he gently pulls him closer.
each other. And we always try to have each other’s backs—even if it means doing stupid, risky shit.” A breath of a laugh escapes him, and Dean’s encouraged to see a small smile lift the corner of Castiel’s mouth. “All the stuff we’ve done for each other,” Dean says, more seriously, “we
And there’s no land in sight.
He squeezes his eyes shut, and an animal sound claws its way out of him.
After some time, Dean glances up and sees something farther along the beach that stops him in his tracks.
How many times did Cas defy Heaven and the other angels for Dean? He gave up everything he knew to break ranks and help them stop the Apocalypse. He overcame Naomi’s mind control, and after the Fall he traded his army for Dean.
“It’s highly inappropriate,” Dean says, “so they recommend taking care of the erection right away, to avoid any embarrassment.”
, and pain explodes in his knee as he collapses in the surf with a grunt. Gasping, he scrabbles to get away, but Alastair kicks him in the stomach, driving the air from his lungs.
Jack nods, smiling. “Deal.” He opens the laptop but then says, “I do have a bet with Sam about how long it’ll take you to find the secret passageway that we found. But I don’t think that counts as a secret deal.”
Jack raises his eyebrows in surprise, and Sam waits while he gathers his thoughts.
Eventually, Castiel finds himself in a conversation with a few of the network’s operators. He listens as they compare notes on how they handle verification calls when law enforcement becomes suspicious of hunters working their cases; some of their methods are the same ones Bobby used to use, and he imagines Garth had passed the wisdom on. But as the others are talking, his attention is drawn to the DJ booth when he sees Claire, Kaia, Alex, and Patience clustered near it. They’re giggling and focused on some point across the room. Castiel excuses himself from the conversation and looks for the object of their attention.
“First off, you got a massive ego—”
Finally,
Dean blinks and shuts up.
“What? What is it?” Sam asks.
“There’s no privacy.” Dean leans in, his lips brushing Castiel’s neck. “Sometimes the couple spends practically the whole time apart,” he murmurs.
Dean’s hands are moving over Castiel’s body, grasping at him roughly, and when he reaches his shoulders, he tugs. “Please,” he says breathlessly.
Chuck raises his eyebrows expectantly, and Death appears behind him, his scythe arcing through the air.
“Dean, that’s not true,” Castiel says, his face softening.
Dean plants an elbow on the table and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Cas,” he says calmly, eyes closed. “Give me your angel blade.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Once he’s satisfied she’s securely grounded he straightens up, breathing hard, and looks around.
“Thanks,” Sam says, grinning slightly.
“I mean, you can’t,” Dean stammers. “You can’t say that to me.” He’s flailing, mentally. This is not how this was supposed to go. “Not right now. Not when we’re in the middle of all this and everything is hanging in the balance.” Dean sucks in a shaky breath and when he speaks again his voice is barely above a whisper. “You can't say that to me right now, like things aren’t gonna go our way. Like we won’t have a chance to say it later. Please.”
Dean realizes he’s facing directly into the sunset. “Oh, right.” He nods, then nudges Castiel. “Your eyes are really blue.”
His heart sinks, and doubt crowds in.
It’s not going to be easy. But the people he loves are waiting for him.
“Thanks,” Jack says warmly, and he ducks out of the room.
, Castiel had said to him,
Dean swears he can feel his soul shivering like a struck tuning fork, and it occurs to him that there can’t be a worse place for two humans than right here.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Dean says testily. He’s shivering but he takes a steadying breath and tries to suppress it.
After a couple of hours, Gabriel claps his hands and says, “Okay. Now we go from theory to practice. Lose your stuff, we’re probably gonna end up in the water.”
“You patched me up a couple times.” Gabriel shrugs a shoulder. “I’m just returning the favor.” He smacks Sam’s arm lightly. “Now go get your girl.” He winks, and with a rustle of wings he’s gone.
“When we returned, Chuck told me that he wanted to create, too, and I was so pleased. We collaborated to create the other archangels. Michael was first, and Gabriel last.” She smiles at them in turn.
“Damn,” Dean mutters. “That guy’s got some moves. Look at him go.” He nods his head toward the guy but Castiel doesn’t follow Dean’s gaze, watching him instead.
The next song is a slow one, something Castiel thinks might be by The Rolling Stones. He and Mary sway gently, and through the crowd he spots Dean and Claire slow-dancing, too. Dean catches his eye and winks at him.
Amara’s eyes fill with tears, bright from the lunar glow within. “You have to know I didn’t want to leave you.”
Castiel shakes his head. “It’s nothing to be concerned about.”
Castiel walks into the kitchen and Dean says, “Hey, what’s he up to out there?”
“Dean—”
Dean stares at the message, and a vague feeling of not being deserving creeps up on him. After a few moments, he realizes Castiel still hasn’t answered his question—not really.
“Sam—I dig the beard,” Chuck says, gesturing to his own face. “Dean, you’re looking a little feral. With the bloody handprint, and the angel blade. That’s cool.”
it every time,” Dean says. He steps forward and runs a hand along the edge of Castiel’s wing, and Castiel’s chin drops to his chest and he draws a shuddering breath, fist clenching down at his side.
Chuck ignores him and directs his attention to Dean.
Chuck opens his mouth but it snaps shut with a click of his teeth. He stiffens, eyes widening; Amara is using her powers to hold him in place. She walks over to Chuck, and the archangels draw closer.
Dean closes the distance between them and kisses Castiel like it’s the end all over again, and like it’s the beginning of everything.
The outcropping he’s been aiming for is a long way away, and the passage beyond might as well be on the moon—and his soul hadn’t bothered to put one of those in the sky.
“You think it’s permanent?”
“It couldn’t be more perfect,” Castiel says, gazing outside, and then a thought occurs to him. “Wait a minute…” He turns to Jack. “Is this your doing?”
“Now that you have spoken your marriage vows and exchanged wedding rings in the presence of your family, I am honored and delighted to declare the two of you husbands.” Garth beams at them and closes his booklet. “You may seal this declaration with a kiss.”
Death stands waiting for them, both hands resting atop his cane.
Their conversation strays into a lull, but then Castiel says, “It didn’t.”
When Dean opens his eyes, his gaze sweeps over Castiel’s wings, his face brightening with a look of pure awe mixed with deep adoration. It makes Castiel forget to breathe.
Please see the end notes for this chapter’s content warning.
“And when I first met Cas,” Sam says, “I was totally in awe of him, because of what he was.” Castiel and Sam smile at each other, and Castiel gets the sense that they’re both remembering that first meeting, their first handshake. They’ve come a long way since then. “Almost thirteen years later,” Sam says, “I’m still in awe of him—because of who he is.” Dean gives Castiel a proud smile.
Dean feels a flutter of fear, and he tucks the pendant away again. “We need to get to the bunker. Now.”
As he follows his old trail he keeps his eyes peeled, and finally he’s rewarded with a glint of silver.
“Oh, I was thinking about moving out, too. I just didn’t want to do it until I knew you boys were settled on whatever path you wanted to take. I’m happy for you, Sam. So long as this is what you want.”
“I don’t know,” Dean says, casting an anxious glance at the horde. A few of them are beginning to stir, although they don’t seem quite awake.
He continues, “That money that Charlie secured to help us all out—there’s some of that for us, too. Eileen and I have been talking about getting a place in town, or maybe further away—but not
Dean’s head whips around and he sees Death at Chuck’s back, both hands on the scythe.
Dean puts the keys and knife away, smiling, and then reaches into his breast pocket and tugs out a length of blue fabric that Castiel recognizes as his tie.
In addition to traveling, reading stolen books, and keeping themselves alive, they pray to Michael.
…” He pauses, smiling and frowning at the same time as a rush of emotion gets the better of him. “I’m so proud to be able to call you my brothers.” He places his hand over his heart. “Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, for us” —he nods at their guests— “and for everyone else who’ll never know about it. Don’t ever doubt that you deserve your happiness.”
Breathing hard, Castiel holds Dean in his gaze; there’s a beautiful wildness in his eyes. Castiel’s feathers twitch and quiver, smoothing into place, and then his wings fold and fade from sight.
Dean sucks in a hurt little breath, fighting the urge to sit down on the sand and put his head in his hands. He stares down the length of the hazy beach, swaying slightly in his weariness.
Dean exchanges a look with Sam, and they both nod.
Jack gets out of Mary’s car and hurries over. Mary, Garth, and the photographers aren’t far behind. Jack is practically vibrating with excitement. “Are you ready?”
“I’m listening!” Dean insists. “Amara. Balance. Really old star. Naked.” He grins.
“Dean.” Castiel shoots Dean a look, as if Dean is failing to understand something very simple.
Sam finishes his coffee cake and dusts off his hands. “Can I ask… what happened to Chuck?”
And he is careful, but what they’re hunting turns out to be a large pack of Nachzehrer. He hasn’t even changed out of his Fed threads when it goes sideways. Before they manage to kill the alpha and restore the pack’s humanity, there is a brutal melee, and Dean experiences a close call that leaves him hurt—not too badly—and shaken—badly.
Sam shines his flashlight slowly over the bookshelves in the bunker library, wanting to make sure he hasn’t overlooked anything.
Castiel unfurls his wings as Dean pulls the long chain over his head, eyes closed.
Hidden beneath a pile of papers, he finds the box that holds the key to Death’s Library. Dizzying relief washes over him.
One thing no one seems to be hunting much of is demons. Demonic activity and possessions have seen a steady, ongoing decline for more half a year now.
“Hm, cozy,” Dean says thoughtfully, still staring outside.
Castiel and Jack can keep the house, if they want it. Jack needs Cas more than he needs Dean, anyway, and it wouldn’t be fair to uproot the kid if they don’t have to.
His eyes find Dean across the room, and he is surprised to see that Dean is alone now, leaning against a bookshelf, staring at Castiel while sipping his whiskey.
“Yeah, I know exactly what you mean,” Dean murmurs, frowning as he remembers what he’d thought of Jack in the beginning—and how he’d treated him.
me?” Dean says, raising his gun and putting his back to Castiel’s. “Okay, now—look like a badass. Like, with your face.”
With one eye on the sail and the other on the water, searching for any hint of tan, Dean thinks,
This time, when the glow fades from Castiel’s eyes and he pulls his hands away from Michael and Gabriel, they both stand blankly for a few moments.
“Hey,” Dean says, slipping into the room.
News of their relationship had inevitably filtered out beyond their immediate circle, and Castiel suspects that Dean had braced for backlash from his fellow hunters. But as far as Castiel knows, no one has ever taken issue with the fact that Castiel’s vessel is male, or that he isn’t human, or both. Although the Winchesters have had a questionable reputation among hunters in the past, their efforts to build a national network have earned them wide respect.
“Here.” Dean takes Castiel by the shoulders and switches places with him, so the sun hits Castiel’s face.
Dean shoves the door open and flips on the light, then sets the duffel down and draws the blinds. The dark walls make the room feel small and dim, but at least the place smells like it was cleaned this morning.
Jack had smiled and offered Sam his hand, and they’d shaken on it. An exploration of the passage had revealed that it led to the garage—an escape route that would have been nice to know about when Ketch had trapped them in the bunker.
with me. I know you love me. But I wasn’t sure if…” Dean trails off, then shrugs. “I wasn’t sure if you’d want to do the whole marriage thing,” he says finally.
Garth’s tone sobers as he continues. “You’ve fought each other at times, striving to hold onto the person you knew and loved when they had strayed from their better nature.” Castiel isn’t sure who initiates it, but they squeeze each other’s hands.
Like room 206.
Dean finally looks at him and is startled by how tired he seems: his eyes are dull and there’s a slump to his shoulders that strikes Dean as
“Cas, are you listening to me? There’s an artistry to this whole thing. This is crucial stuff.”
When Dean opens his eyes and gazes out into the nothing that surrounds him, he’s calmly certain that he’s only been here for a few minutes. He hasn’t failed. His heartbeat is strong and steady, and everything that makes him Dean Winchester settles itself around the purpose that burns inside of him, the way the bloody handprint burns upon his arm. His voice is waiting in his throat, the words ready in his mouth.
Gabriel wiggles his eyebrows as he unwraps a package of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups.
“Do you think you’ll be gone long?” Dean asks quietly.
Gabriel, putting himself between the other Michael, and Dean and Sam. Saying,
As they lie together, Castiel with one arm around Dean, and Dean tracing the edge of a button on Castiel’s shirt, Castiel thinks back over the last week. He thinks of Dean’s reticence, the frequent far-off look in his eyes, the nervous smiles whenever Dean realized Castiel was looking at him.
Dean closes his eyes. “Fuck,” he breathes. He pulls himself to a sitting position. “Did they make it?”
“Seriously, Sam.” Dean waits until Sam meets his eyes, then says, “I believe in you.”
And then the Entity had shown up to drag Cas away, because he’d experienced true happiness.
Castiel returns his smile. “And look where that got us.”
“He just said, ‘Yeah, that sounds like us,’” Jack says with a shrug.
Well what do you want for you
“Hey,” Dean says, “you wanna watch a movie or something?” He grabs his laptop. “There’s a Western I haven’t seen in a while—
After a while he starts shivering, and then, stiff and aching, he hauls himself up.
Dean says, “It might take me a while before I’m ready to talk about all that, but I’ll tell you the whole story sometime. And I want to hear all about your and Sam’s end of things.” He gets up to leave. “But for now, you got some videos to watch, and I need a shower.”
How long has he been lying here? Experimentally, he moves his injured leg, testing his knee.
Gadreel says, “They believe they will find Castiel, and a way out of the Empty, through your efforts.”
Jack takes off his headphones and closes the laptop, so Sam puts the pictures away.
Every now and then he misses Sam, but Sam’s not far and he’s also happy, and that’s enough to help Dean get over the feeling when it surfaces. That, and the times when it’s just him and Cas.
“And you look very handsome,” she says, smiling, “but you’re missing something.” She sets a small box down on Castiel’s bed.
Dean stays busy with hunting and helping Sam manage operations at the bunker, and Castiel, back to wearing his usual trenchcoat, helps Jack understand and use his powers. Dean, Castiel, and Jack all come and go as they need to, but they make time to have dinner together and to watch TV as often as they can. They’ve decided to work their way through all the series of
“Okay, sounds good,” Dean mumbles, shifting to get more comfortable. Eyes half-closed, he watches them leave the room, listens to their low voices in the kitchen. Their kitchen.
Dean glances at Castiel, but he’s not looking at Dean.
Dean runs his hand lightly along the firm edge that reminds him of a bicep, and he feels Cas pressing his wing back into his touch.
“Well, I can’t argue with that,” he says.
“You’re part of our family—you’re a Winchester, as far as I’m concerned.” Dean pauses, fighting the habitual urge to avoid saying what he feels. “And I want you to know that when I say that,” Dean says slowly, “what I mean is… I see you as my son.”
“I feel totally fine.”
Dean knows Jack had said the Empty was “infinite nothingness,” but he’s starting to realize that he hadn’t actually believed that. After all, he’s been to Hell, Heaven, and Purgatory—all theoretically infinite places. But they were navigable, and he hadn’t had any trouble coming across other beings in any of them.
“Do you think we should be worried? About whatever Jack’s up to, with his spell?”
“They refused to give up,” Michael says.
Castiel looks at Dean and his posture goes rigid. He tucks his wings in still more tightly. “No.”
And he wakes up inside a pine box.
Dean doesn’t have an answer, because the only thing he can think about is how shitty he’s been to Cas over the years. So many angry words, and selfish demands. So many brush-offs—unfeeling at best and scornful at worst.
Dean frowns. “What do you mean?”
He puts himself between Sam and the fire, and with a hand fisted in Sam’s jacket, Dean guides his path so he doesn’t touch anyone’s wings. They lean into the wind, holding onto each other as they make their way to Castiel.
Castiel approaches the garage silently enough that when he steps into it, Dean doesn’t notice his presence. He’s perched on the barstool at his workbench, intently focused on the notebook he’s writing in. His T-shirt and jeans bear swipes of grease and motor oil. As Castiel watches, he appears to rethink what he’s just written, then crosses it out, his dissatisfaction audible in the scratches of the pen digging into the paper.
I made a short playlist for this fic! The direct Spotify link is
Staring down at his hands, Jack says slowly, “We’re not even halfway through the United States and… the world is a big place.” He looks up at Sam, wearing a frown. “It feels like it’s taking such a long time, and all we can do is move around, and pray, and hope that Michael will answer us—if he can even
and Dean hadn’t provided an answer beyond,
They’re safe.
Chuck’s mouth opens and closes, and his face slowly crumples with rage.
“Whenever you’re ready,” Death says.
How many other demons had learned from Dean?
Dean pulls Castiel into a kiss as their audience breaks into wild applause, and Dean says in Castiel’s ear, “You did great—thank you for humoring me.”
Sam starts murmuring something, and Dean watches him closely, but he doesn’t seem to be distressed. His voice rises and falls, and Dean smiles when he recognizes the lyrics to “Someday Soon.”
Castiel carefully removes the other ring from the box and places it on Dean’s finger, and they resume holding hands.
Jack clenches his fist. “No.”
But then he tenses when he remembers that the Entity can look like anyone.
They’re sitting on a big multicolored blanket in the center of the clearing, Sam on his left and Jack on his right. The three of them, along with Death and Gabriel, eat pastries and baked goods off a giant platter in the middle of the blanket.
Jack says, “What about Chuck?”
For all Cas’ leaving, he’s always shown up again. Of course, the first time they ran into Chuck, Cas had still been a soldier of Heaven, sent to protect the “prophet.” He’d still been coloring inside the lines of Chuck’s grand design.
Dean finishes a long and treacherous climb out of a ravine only to find a towering rock face hemming him in on all sides. He heaves a sigh, then rests his back against the wall and slides down it. He’s going to have to climb down again and find some other way.
Castiel makes his way slowly down the hall to Dean’s room.
Castiel returns his smile. “Let’s go home,” he agrees.

Thank you again for reading! 😊
Jack is sitting up on his bed. The laptop is plugged in beside him, closed and with the flash drive resting on top of it. Dean realizes he must be waiting to watch the videos Kelly left him.
Now that dinner has finished, some of the guests have found their way outside. Castiel recognizes a young blonde woman in a pink dress as one of the counselors who’s agreed to be in the network; she notices them and calls her congratulations, and others chime in. Castiel and Dean smile and wave.
They give each other a nod.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s no evidence at all of the battle that occurred here earlier; there’s only life, proceeding as normal. A great horned owl is calling somewhere in the woods, crickets are singing, and bats are swooping through the air.
Jack, behind Baby’s wheel on a long stretch of two-lane road, grinning, and dying, and shouting,
Something in Castiel’s eyes changes, and Dean charges on, his voice unsteady. “I know things are different now, because of… who you are, and I don’t know if you’re still— If you still feel—” Dean can’t bring himself to say it. “But if you do, then you were wrong. About what you think you can’t have.” Dean swallows hard.
They go under, and everything becomes muted, the sludge pressing in on Dean as they sink.
I dunno what I’d want life to be like but as long as I got you and my brother I’m good
“I wouldn’t, either,” Castiel says.
“No,” Dean says firmly, shaking his head. “None of it was okay. You deserved better from me, because you’re a good person, Jack, and you always have been.”
“He brainwashed us, and we forgot all about you both,” Gabriel says, looking between Amara and Castiel. “He told us he’d created Earth—and us, in order to watch over it, because a force called the Darkness was coming to destroy it.”
On the one hand, this is a relief, because it proves his theory right: he doesn’t need food, water, or sleep in here.
Dean sags against the hull. “Sorry, Kat, I’m sorry,” he pants.
Eileen says, “You could go for something more traditional, or write your own.”
His knee doesn’t get any better.
Dean is vaguely aware of the storm raging around them, but his eyes are squeezed shut, his jaw clenched. His arms are shaking with effort, his muscles screaming in protest, burning…
The corner of his mouth quirks, and then he gathers up his discarded clothes and heads for his room.
“Right, so. We gotta find a way to live with things.” He slips his hand into Castiel’s, lacing their fingers together, and it’s the smallest thing but it still gives Dean a rush.
Dean straightens up and grabs the phone again. “Yeah? So?”
He tries to take a step but he’s sinking, and he throws his arms out to keep his balance. “Cas!” The goo isn’t wet but it’s thick, already reaching his knees, and he’s stuck in place.
Jack hugs Dean, and for a moment Dean is too surprised to do anything, but then he recovers and returns the hug, just as tightly.
How different might things have turned out, if he’d just taken Cas home? If he hadn’t been so afraid?
“Please gimme a chance to make it right,” Dean whispers, his words lost beneath the sound of the water and wind. “Please be waiting for me. Please.”
Eileen says, “So have a private ceremony, with a big reception afterward.” She shrugs.
So Sam had gotten up and fumbled his way to a flashlight.
Castiel’s wings tense reflexively, as if wanting to pull him into flight, too. But despite the instinctive longing of his useless, broken wings, Castiel is exactly where he wants to be.
How many of them are there? He thinks it might be something like three thousand, but it could be as many as five thousand. It hardly matters—his only chance lies in being faster than them, and it looks like he’s going to hit the valley floor at the same time as they are.
There’s a weak sun above the sparse canopy of trees; since its gradual appearance it has never set, never moved at all. Its light grows steadily stronger, pushing the darkness of the Empty back and back. Now, Dean only occasionally glimpses the impenetrable gloom way out in between the trees, when in rare instances he reaches a relatively clear patch of forest.
Gabriel inclines his head. “Sure do.”
Dean’s head breaks the surface of the water and he sucks in a lungful of air, coughing and blinking furiously.
The inferno inside of him roars to life.
“Breakfast,” Dean says, going to the rickety table in the corner. He sits down and focuses on pulling stuff out of the bag until Castiel sits down across from him.
Sam is temporarily sharing with Dean because another family is borrowing his room, so Dean’s bed is shoved up against one wall and there’s a cot on the opposite wall. Weapons, toiletries, and paperwork are jammed onto every available surface. It’s clear that a quiet battle for space is being waged.
Alastair’s cold eyes pierce Dean through to his soul.
, Castiel grips his blade, lowers his chin, and narrows his eyes.
Then he spies the Valiant. It’s parked on the curb, right where it had been when they’d pulled up to the house, already too late, and—
“Alright. I’m just going up to my room for a second, and then I’ll be right back.”
“What?” Dean demands.
Dean and Castiel are leaning against the locked Impala waiting for Sam and Jack, who’ve gone to a nearby convenience store for snacks for the road. Sam had confiscated the keys from Dean after Dean had downed a couple of double whiskeys to celebrate wrapping up the hunt.
The room is mostly Dean’s.
after dinner?”
Sam grins at Dean’s flat, unamused glare. “Sorry, Dean.”
She says, “They’re here because of you.”
“Well,” Dean says conversationally, going back to stroking Castiel’s wings. “I met this guy once. And he was just about the weirdest thing I’d ever come across, and you know I’ve come across some weird things in my life. I haven’t known him for five minutes before he’s showing off his big huge wings,” Dean says with a grin. “I was curious and did a little research.” He shrugs.
He rubs it, and there’s no pain. A soft laugh escapes him, and he realizes: immobility and the cold and time were probably exactly what he needed. He pushes himself to his feet, only feeling a little wobbly, and regards the crag.
Sam feels a swell of pride. “I like the way you think.”
we can get an archangel out of the Empty, then we’ll have two of them.” There’s a long pause as Dean watches Sam evaluate this.
Startled, Dean says, “Some of your grace?” Dean shakes his head. “Jack, I can’t…”
“Hey, listen,” Dean says. “I know you’ve been having a tough time since you lost your powers, but you didn’t need ’em for that idea you had earlier, right?” Dean cranes his head a little so Jack will meet his eyes, and when he does, he says, “We need you, Jack—powers or no powers. Sam’s gonna need you. You two gotta watch out for each other.”
“When you’ve warmed up, I’d like you to explain what’s going on,” Castiel says. He goes to the kitchen and begins looking through the cupboards.
Once he’s sure he’s steady, he gets down from the rock, picks out his next waypoint, and keeps going.
He knows that Dean was hurt by the revelation that he’s an archangel.
Among the stories of Diwali celebrations in India and the wildlife in Loango National Park in Gabon, Jack tells them about the time he and Dean and Cas went fishing, and it takes Dean by surprise—so much so that when Jack smiles at him from the other end of the table, all Dean can do is smile back at him.
There is a brief silence as they consider the idea, and then Mary says, “Right before you were born, Jack… Crowley said that if we helped him cage Lucifer, he would close up Hell for good. Do you remember that?” Mary looks between Sam and Dean.
Dean is trying to make sense of this when Castiel, not bothering to look at Dean, says quietly, “Stop staring at me and eat your dinner.”
Dean sags and clenches his fist. “God damn it.” Breathing hard, he gives Castiel a hungry look, then scrubs a hand roughly over his face and hauls himself out of the car. Castiel follows, and watches as Dean walks it off, pacing back and forth with the car between them. Castiel subdues his desire with difficulty.
, Cas had said. Dean’s heart rate isn’t exactly normal right now, either.
, is what I’m asking,” Dean says, insistent. “This isn’t like the Leviathans, is it?”
He follows them until they disappear, and then he stands looking out over the dark water. A wave roars its way onto the beach, racing up the sand to touch his boots. When it slips away, it erases a little more of the last footprint.
“Yeah!” Sam says, grinning slightly, relieved to finally say it. Mary links her arm through Sam’s and they start walking again, and Sam slowly puts into words the thoughts that have been swirling in his mind for the last few months. “I don’t think I could ever quit hunting, and I know Dean couldn’t. But I like to think that maybe I’ve gotten to a place where I don’t have to do it full-time, you know?” He glances down at Mary and she nods.
“It’s alright,” Castiel murmurs. When they part, Castiel holds Jack at arm’s length, smiling. “I’m back.” Jack smiles at him and Castiel feels a swell of warmth.
Dean starts walking again, hurrying now, and he sees a small rise just ahead of him—a new feature in this endlessly flat place. Somewhere beyond it there is a sound, a roar that Dean recognizes. Heart in his throat, he crests the rise.
“I want to do all the stuff people do when they feel like this: I wanna bring you flowers, and leave you dumb little Post-Its with hearts on ’em. I wanna look up at the stars with you, and have you tell me about all the constellations, and about creation.” Here Dean swallows, and when he speaks again, his voice is soft. “I want to always come home to you. I want to make love with you. I want you to know, every day, for the rest of my life, how much I cherish you.”
So many regrets, over the years.
When he opens his eyes again he sees Rowena watching them, looking immensely pleased with herself. He steps away from Eileen so she can see their conversation, and he says, “You brought her back?”
Dean drags air into his lungs, and his voice is ragged when he finally says, “I fucking hate you.” Angry tears well in his eyes.
The encounter with Gadreel has brought up memories Dean’s spent a lot of time trying to forget: the days when he was burdened by the Mark of Cain.
They shrug out of their jackets and lay them over the armchair, and then fumble with each other’s clothes—it’s more buttons and layers than they’re used to. They laugh as they struggle to undress each other.
Everything is alive.
They keep to an orderly schedule, with six hours of every day dedicated to prayer: hour-long sessions four times a day, with four half-hour sessions interspersed between the longer ones. They alternate on an additional half-hour session in the middle of the night.
The door opens and Mary pokes her head inside. “I come bearing gifts,” she says, slipping into the room and closing the door behind her. She’s wearing a long, pale green dress and a pair of sandals.
Dean closes the distance between them and seizes the front of Lucifer’s jacket in his fist. Lucifer looks up at him, stunned.
Castiel’s expression softens. “What, pass through things?” He stretches them out slightly, making them do just that.
“We need to figure out the guest list ASAP and get the invites out. Then we gotta figure out what to wear, and come up with a menu. And I have to work on our music situation. This might be the most important thing I’ve ever done, Cas.”
And Dean’s saying,
Sam looks over at them and says, “I am

“Night, Cas,” Dean says quietly. He feels sad, all of a sudden, but it must be fatigue. The door closes, leaving nothing but the sound of air moving through the vents.
anymore.
Dean whirls around, finger raised. “I don’t need you to…” He freezes and slowly drops his hand, staring at Castiel, lips parted in stunned silence.
The air outside is cool; it’s close to one in the morning, and a waxing crescent moon hangs above. The party has thinned out by this point, and the photographers departed earlier, but small groups of people are gathered to converse and sip drinks under the string lights. A few people notice him and wave, but to his relief they don’t approach him. He takes a deep breath and is idly scanning the grounds when his eyes snag on a rippling patch of darkness sitting on the path leading into the forest.
“Okay,” Dean had said, refusing to look at Castiel, pretending to focus on an oil change he could do with his eyes closed.
“Crowley!” Castiel shouts. “Gabriel!”
“It wasn’t like floating in space—I was standing on… a floor, I guess. And it was all completely dark, but there was some kind of… dim source of light from somewhere. So I could see myself, and people around me—Billie, and the Entity.” Dean is nodding as he listens, trying to picture it but not sure he’s getting it right.
He turns back to the crag, startled, and cranes his head back to look up at it with new eyes.
Dean doesn’t want him to leave. Alastair might be dead, but right now Dean feels safer with Castiel around. Not that he’s going to admit that. Anyway, there’s no reason for Castiel to be here—not anymore. So what Dean says is, “I told you I’m not your guy, so I don’t care what you do.”
“Because this feels too good,” Castiel murmurs, kissing his neck, “and I think you know that.”
Castiel laughs, even as his heart beats hard. “Did
Here, though… maybe it’s more like outer space. A very troubling thought, given the scales and distances at play, there—stuff that always makes Dean’s head hurt.
Dean laughs, an incredulous little sound. “Yeah, I was nervous!”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Right, so—you two patched things up and left Earth. And then…” He trails off, thinking back as sunrise deepens to a rainy night.
the ‘something old,’” Castiel says, grinning a little, and Mary laughs. “I’m about as old as it gets,” he murmurs.
Why is he worried about Castiel, when Castiel clearly hadn’t worried about him? He hadn’t cared that his idiotic secret deal was going to come back to bite them. He hadn’t cared that his plan to summon the Entity was going to hurt Dean. He hadn’t cared that Dean was going to be left with the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Castiel likes it. “I made a pie, too,” Dean adds. “Apple.” He leans back so Castiel can see it sitting on the counter to his left.
“We’ll give him a call tomorrow,” Dean says, yawning. “Maybe we can do a video chat—I wanna see his face when we tell him.” He grins. “Everything’s starting to come together. Feels good.”
A single clap rings out, and then it swiftly becomes a round of thunderous applause, everyone getting to their feet, whoops and whistles rising from within the waterfall sound of their standing ovation.
Dean should be asleep, too, but he’s not tired. He’s staring at his laptop screen without really seeing it, thinking about what Sam had said earlier.
Castiel is frowning as he massages his palm. “My wrist hurts.”
Castiel had frowned over at him, waiting for Dean to elaborate.
Castiel lifts a hand. “May I?”
He remembers Jack’s worried frown.
Dean drags his eyes back to Castiel’s and smiles nervously. “Well, here we are. Home sweet home.”
? If Sam has any sense, he’s still with Eileen.
Dean tears the wrapping paper from the gift, revealing a book. He reads the title, eyebrows raised. “
Oh it’s like that huh
okay?”
“We’re a little past playing it safe, Sammy,” Dean says, not unkindly.
“Yes,” Castiel says again, smiling, his voice stronger this time. “Yes, I’ll marry you, Dean.”
The cell. Ferocity and radiance in the shape of a man, mercy in his touch and salvation in wingbeats. The grave. Blue eyes, and an act of love before love had been learned.
After a month, the activity is dying down and people are starting to talk about figuring out long-term plans. It’s around this time that Charlie quietly pulls Mary, Sam, and Dean into Dean’s room.
“Will putting the fire out stop the spell?”
But Dean doesn’t see what choice he has.
There’s a picture of Sam and Cas, Dean and Jack, taken by either Charlie or Stevie; they all look like they’ve just been laughing about something but Sam can’t remember what it was, now. Another of him and Dean, at Bobby’s having a couple of beers, Sam smiling and Dean grinning at someone outside the frame—Cas. There’s a photo booth strip of four pictures of him and Eileen; they’re crammed into the tiny space together, laughing, making goofy faces, smiling at each other, kissing.
Castiel blinks, then turns to go back to the tent. Through the trees he can see a lone guest making his way slowly across the lawn toward the path leading to the cabins. But then Castiel recognizes Dean’s silhouette.
“Yeah,” Sam says, “if not more so. He was so devout.”
Castiel turns to Dean, and smiling slightly, they clasp hands.
“Yup.” Jack nods and takes a bite of his pie.
“Well, now, isn’t this

Frowning, Dean says, “Aren’t you omniscient?”
“Thanks, Mom,” Sam says softly.
From there he describes starting, stopping, controlling the speed, and turning, which is apparently called both
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Thank you again for reading! 😊
He pushes off of the tree and gets moving, realigning himself once again with the pull he feels in his chest.
There’s a long pause before Jack speaks again. “Do you think he’s watching us?”
Crowley laughs. “Why would you want to?” He lets the fronds go and they sweep back into place, once again hiding the sleeping being from view. “I’m sure the ones who’ve woken up are going to cause you enough trouble.”
“Now what do we have here?” Alastair says in a ponderous voice. He swings the belt and the buckle connects with Dean’s spine. Dean’s body jerks and he cries out, and Alastair stoops and takes hold of the chain around Dean’s neck.
After several hours, Dean’s clothes are mostly dry, but the temperature has dropped. He’s tucked the pendant of Jack’s grace into his T-shirt again, turned up the collars on his shirt and jacket, and buttoned both to the throat. His ears ache from the wind and occasionally his teeth chatter; the cold air burns his raw throat so he tries to breathe through his nose. Every exhalation plumes in the air.
“Okay?” Sam chuckles, as if he doesn’t quite know what to do with Dean’s enthusiasm.
Frozen in place and shaking with fear and cold, he stares at the door. As he watches, a blazing blue-white light spills through the cracks.
Light pours into the gorge and a dusting of snow swirls in on a blast of wind. Dean hurries for the opening, moving as fast as he can with his injured knee.
“Is this okay?” Dean murmurs.
Dean’s not sure how to categorize the sleepers.
When they separate, the party breaks from its arrangement, and everyone exchanges hugs. There are happy tears, but mostly there is laughter.
He listens to the wind as he plummets to Earth.
The foliage at the edge of the clearing bursts into a wall of flames, throwing a hellish light over the terrible scene.
Castiel laughs softly. “Is this what it’s going to be like?”
“One thing I don’t get,” Dean says, looking at Castiel. “You were human then. Why didn’t he just leave it alone? Or take your grace before that? Once you die you get sent to Heaven and… problem solved, right?”
He wonders if Castiel is still here—whether he might run into him in the kitchen. If he does, well… Castiel is just going to have to hang out while Dean stuffs his face.
“Probably not,” Castiel agrees.
When he turns around, Sam and Jack are just entering the kitchen, but they stop short in the doorway when they see Dean. Jack has Chuck’s death book under one arm.
Dean rolls onto his back, lifts a numb hand, and fumbles in his jacket pocket.
“You could be anywhere in the universe right now,” Sam says, “but you’re here on Earth.”
Jack crosses the room to Gabriel, stooping to pick one off the floor. “Gabriel,” he says, “we could help with some of these things, couldn’t we?” He offers him the list.
Dean blinks, and now his heart is beating hard for an entirely different reason. He can feel his face slip from “stony” to “stricken.” Before he can think of what to say, a single word is passing his lips, a choked sound, so different to the way he spoke this same word just minutes ago: “Don’t.”
Hey you around
“Those are the scapular feathers,” Castiel says. He lifts his hand and gestures to the next segment. “Marginal coverts.”
Dean cuts in before Death can answer. “When we met in Chicago, you told me that one day you’d reap God. Well, I say: no time like the present.”
“Dean.”
They grin at each other, clink their bottles together, and take a long drink.
“We gotta save the world,” he says, tucking the vial of grace into his shirt, “and I’m not doing it without you. You’re not gonna make me live without you.” He secures the belt around his waist and stows the blade.
Jack had said.
you were a dick to me,” Castiel says gently, looking at Dean with his eyebrows raised. “I thought you didn’t want me around.”
“Been missin’ you all day,” Dean murmurs against Castiel’s lips.
Dean’s mind wanders to the clearing in the woods, where the others had stayed behind to discuss Amara’s plans and their next steps.
Death nods. “That’s correct.”
Dean gives Crowley a long look, then says, “You should watch your back. Lucifer’s in here somewhere.”
She smiles at him. “Now you’re ready to get married.”
Dean exists somewhere between sleep and consciousness.
“Yes,” Castiel says gravely. “I’m afraid this will be much worse.”
Dean tries to pull away, but he’s not fast enough—the thought gets its claws into him.
Someone shouts, “Dance with your husband!” and people laugh; as Castiel is still seated, the command could be directed at either one of them.
Days later, Kat is in the lying-to position: her bow is perpendicular to the wind and the mainsheet is loose so that her sail flaps freely, keeping her more or less stationary while Dean lies in the bottom of the boat. His arms are stretched out at his sides to rest them, the mainsheet clutched in one hand.
him understand. He smashes his fist into Castiel’s face, and proceeds to beat him senseless. Dean gets no enjoyment from this; he’s just doing what he has to, to get Cas to stop talking, stop trying, to get him to just
Sam grins and shakes his head, and then he’s overtaken by a huge yawn.
Dean nods. “Yeah, I think you’re right.” He watches Castiel, and wonders how true that might be for him.
She won’t stop screaming.
After dinner, Jack excuses himself to his room, and Dean and Sam stick around at the table.
Castiel is standing there, palms out, as if he’d been expecting to grapple with Dean.
Castiel takes a step toward Dean and Dean takes a step backward.
A few seconds after they arrive, Jack goes rigid.
A trickster in a ring of holy fire, but no—
Sam breathes out a small laugh and shakes his head. “No, that wasn’t our last hunt together, and no, I’m not retiring.”
Thank you again for reading
Michael takes a breath and then straightens his back. “Alright.” He walks down the steps to them. “Let’s fix this. What’s your plan?”
Dean swallows hard and climbs to his feet, suddenly filled with nervous energy. As he begins picking his way down the ravine, he wonders,
Castiel’s voice whispers across Dean’s memory:
, or something. I didn’t tell him I was proposing; I thought you could be the one to tell him, when he gets back.”
But Dean stubbornly hangs onto the image of Castiel on the shore. “If I can just find you,” Dean says, “we can fix it. And then…” He falters. Assuming they make it, what then? “We’ll… we’ll figure everything else out.”
He crosses the room and takes the angel blade from its mount, his fingers curling around the hilt. As far as weapons go, this is the only choice. The weight of it is comfortable, the balance familiar. He knows it like the back of his hand.
Dean lifts the foil: baked ziti. “Oh, hell yeah,” he murmurs. He serves himself a heaping plateful and takes his first bite before he’s made it over to the table.
Jack stares out across his room and shakes his head slightly. He looks so damn young, and so lost.
When it’s over, he gets in the car and starts driving, and he feels the tug of home for every mile of the journey—so much so that he doesn’t stop for the night. He pulls onto their road as the sun is coming up, and as he nears the house he’s hoping, with an intensity that shocks him, that he’ll see Castiel’s truck in the driveway.
When they’re parked, Dean takes off his sunglasses and sets them on the dashboard.
Castiel glances over at Dean. “I’d like to lend a hand, yes. There’s a lot we need to do, and countless souls and beings who need our help.”
Castiel takes charge of the search for vows, steering them through the internet while they sit side by side on the couch. They wade through many saccharine options, to which Dean makes gagging noises. They choose simple, secular vows that Garth will read out for them to respond to.
And just before Dean leaves, he looks at his little brother and sees someone he couldn’t be more proud of, no matter what happens to them—the strongest, brightest, best man he’s ever known.
“Oh, and they’re platinum,” Dean adds. “It’s really durable, and it was the strongest metal I was able to work with. My boyfriend’s a warrior, so…” Dean grins at Castiel and shrugs a shoulder. “It had to be something sturdy.”
“Oh, man,” Sam had murmured, poking his head into the dark hallway. Jack had found a flashlight and pointed it down the cobweb-choked passage. “Dean’s gonna be so pissed he didn’t find this himself,” Sam had said with a laugh, and then a second later his face had fallen.
Charlie and another hunter named Stevie decide to move to Seattle together, but they promise to keep in touch. Before they depart from the bunker, Charlie insists, multiple times, that if anyone ever needs anything they can call or text her any time, and finally Dean has to tell her to get in the car and go, or else.
“I sure hope so, ’cause I don’t think it’d be a good idea to have outsiders at a gathering of hunters,” Dean says.
Dean’s got a fluttery, nervous feeling in his stomach.
“You’re not gonna have to,” Dean says.
Dean looks to Castiel’s unmoving form. He’s far enough away that Dean can’t see his face, can’t actually tell from sight alone that it’s him. But there’s the horde, and the frantic tug in his chest, and above all, the unshakable certainty rooted in his soul.
“Your turn,” he whispers. There’s a bright, burning sensation in his chest.
When the stream of light fades, Amara lowers her hand and regards Chuck. His eyes are wide and pleading, and her face is full of grief. “Goodbye,” she murmurs, and then Chuck vanishes.
The hurt flares up sharply inside his chest as he remembers Castiel’s smile, as Castiel had told Dean about Jack healing his wings. He remembers Jack’s smile, too, and he remembers not being able to smile at all, not being able to breathe.
“No, he’s right,” Chuck says, nodding. “I do have a massive ego.”
, Cas.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. “You flirting with me?”
Dean nods.
He knows he shouldn’t, but Dean can’t help but think about his most recent ones.
Sam looks at Jack and says softly, “And then you woke him up.”
He glances over at Cas and Cas is looking at him, wearing a small smile.
“Is that so?”
“No, he’s not alone.” Castiel turns to Gabriel and says firmly, “But none of us are archangels.”
Castiel addresses Death. “You’ve got him?”
The crowd laughs and Dean shakes his head, smiling. “Don’t think I’m going to forget this betrayal!” he says to the room.
A small smile lifts the corner of Jack’s mouth. “I consider you and Sam and Cas my dads.”
Please see the end notes for this chapter’s content warning.
“I see you guys are a little cagey,” Chuck says. “I get it. That’s fair. Why don’t I tell you what I
Dean helps Castiel to his feet, snatching up his dropped blade. If they head into the woods they might—
“Oh, uh… yeah,” Dean says. “Thanks.”
He’s still a warrior, and he’d killed that Rit Zien dickhead, no problem.
They browse many pictures of possible wedding attire and create a shortlist, factoring in the season, time of day, and desire for comfort, and Jack helps judge. When they’ve selected the winners, Jack stands and holds up his hands. One moment they’re empty, and in the next, he’s holding two zippered garment bags, smiling proudly.
“More like, I came up with the thing you need to
“Because there are two different types of turns,” Gabriel says. “Tacking is when you move the bow across the wind. It’s nice and easy. Jibing is when you move the
One day, Jack requests that Castiel and Dean take him to the playground where Heaven’s gate is located. He sits in the middle of the back seat on the way there, with a long cloth-wrapped object laid across his lap; it nearly touches either door. When Dean asks what it is, all Jack says is, “You’ll see.” But he smiles and, with a hint of pride, adds, “I built it myself.”
The book that Alex gives Dean is real. I highly recommend Rukmini Iyer’s books:
“Alright, I will. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ll call if anything weird happens. But I don’t think it will.”
Castiel growls through bared teeth, “Help… him.”
They open the door to the library, and Dean follows Sam and Jack inside. Where yesterday they crept in, uncertain, today they stride with purpose.
When Dean is certain he’s dead, he pulls the blade out and hastily cleans it off on Lucifer’s clothes.
Dean has been lying in the bottom of the boat for a long time, listening to the slap of water against the hull.
Jack scans the building. “Safe,” he declares.
“Oh,” Castiel says. “Why don’t I come back later, after you’re done watching those?”
“Hold up,” Sam says, frowning as though Dean has lost his mind, and hell, maybe he has. “We don’t know ‘for sure’ there are three archangels in the Empty.” He stands as Dean continues pacing. “Jack detonated in there—it probably wiped everyone out.”
“What’d I tell you?” Crowley says, smirking. “You, me, eleventh hour.”
“It sounds perfect.” Castiel smiles.
After Dean had gone, they’d plugged in all of their electronics to charge up while they still had power, but yesterday they’d lost internet access.
“Seriously, Cas.” Dean cranes his head so Castiel will look at him. “I don’t want you going down that road.” Dean understands the compulsion, though, so he adds, “But if you gotta, then you’re not going by yourself, okay?”
Castiel opens it and Dean freezes and they stare at each other.
Cas is wearing a small smile, along with one of Dean’s old T-shirts and a rough pair of jeans; Dean had insisted he borrow them that morning.
Still. Dean grits his teeth. He’ll wander through this damn forest for as long as it takes him to find Cas and Gabriel.
Sam looks at her, his expression grim. “I hope you’re right.”
Jack pauses and turns on the stairs to look at Dean, eyebrows raised inquisitively.
“No injuries,” Castiel confirms. “Dean, say something.”
“I think that’s probably a good idea.” Castiel smiles. “You should rest. Today was a lot.”
“All of it,” Dean says simply.
Jack flies them back to the bunker, where Michael is waiting near the front entrance in a patch of moonlight, arms crossed.
Sam lets out a confused laugh but then he stops, a stricken expression on his face as he recalls what Amara had told them about Chuck. “Right,” he says gravely.
Dean swallows at this. He and Sam have racked up a hefty body count between them, but Cas… once upon a time, he’d told Dean,
Steven, also loaded down with cameras, leads them through the tent out onto what Castiel supposes are the grounds. A formerly unruly clearing, it’s now a huge, well-manicured lawn bordered by forest. String lights crisscross over the seating areas that are dotted around.
When Dean gets to his room he stands at the foot of his bed and surveys the weapons on the wall over the headboard: various rifles, his Purgatory blade, a Bowie knife, a couple of machetes.
So Dean sits down on the edge of the bed and takes a second to gather his thoughts.
Finally, he moves to a shallow part of the pool to rest, close to his things.
Dean smiles, and Sam smiles back at him.
A summer evening, orange sunlight slanting low across the parking lot of some forgettable chain restaurant where they’d grabbed dinner—him and Sam and Cas and Jack.
The list Sam had drawn up is lying on the table, and Dean raps it with one knuckle, then rubs his face with a groan. In a muffled voice, he says, “Tell him, Cas.”
Castiel pulls his lips from Dean’s to press them to his throat, and Dean gasps, tilting his head back. “You are the most beautiful soul I’ve ever met,” Castiel says raggedly, between kisses.
Instead, he makes the mistake of looking up.
Dean lets the mainsheet out so the sail flaps, slowing him down, then pulls up the centerboard and raises the rudder so they won’t be damaged when he lands.
Jack says, “Sam, could I use your laptop?” There’s a white flash drive clutched in his hand.
They fall silent for a moment and then Dean feels a sadness stir inside him.
The feeling lasts until Castiel and Jack get home.
“Sure, whatever you like.” Dean gets up. “I gotta go check the laundry.” He slips out of the room as Castiel is getting underneath the covers.
At first Dean thinks Castiel is so focused he doesn’t notice their presence, but then his lips move. Dean holds his breath against the boiling air and leans in as close as he can bear to get.
“Nice dinghy.”
He tucks himself into the rocks and rests.
“Thanks,” Dean says. He glances at Castiel, who’s waiting outside the lobby with Dean’s duffel at his feet. He’s staring vacantly out into the parking lot, his work vest clutched loosely in his uninjured hand. There are flecks of blood on the back of his shirt. It’s been a tough night.
The windows on the ground floor are beacons in the dusk, watery-edged squares of welcoming light.
“Dean asked Sam to be his best man,” Castiel says, “and I’d like you to be mine. You would be present when we exchange our vows, and you’d be responsible for keeping our wedding rings safe until the ceremony.”
, but it might have something to do with the fact that for the first time in days, the screaming vortex of nihilism inside of him is quiet.
“In here!” Dean shouts. He picks up the box, heart pounding, and begins reciting the Latin inscription on the lid. Castiel and Gabriel arrive as the outline of the door finishes burning itself into the wall.
When he eventually comes to realize that he’s begun thinking of the boat as
“Oh, yeah.” Gabriel nods. “Got pretty good at it, too. I’ll show you the ropes.”
Oh, god, oh god oh god—
, I would be delighted!
The sun blazes down on Dean, always in the same place, brighter and hotter than it had been over the forest canopy. The sky is cloudless, and so blue it hurts to look at it. The color deepens as it extends toward the horizon, gradually becoming an inky, impenetrable black: the Empty, hovering like the literal end of the world.
Sam grips the scythe’s handle above Death’s hands, and Dean gets hold of it below them, and they start pulling.
“Dean!”
“Yeah,” he says finally, his voice just as quiet. “He’ll show.”
Dean closes his eyes and breathes against the surge of hurt and anger. But despite everything, neither of those are a match for the desperate relief he feels at the sound of that voice.
“Dean and Castiel will now exchange rings,” Garth says, “which serve as symbols of their eternal, unbreakable bond, and the promises they’ve made to each other on this day.”
The faintest frown creases Castiel’s brow. “Dean…” he murmurs.
His eyes still on the ceiling, Michael says, “It seems that complicated father-son relationships are one of his favorite stories.”
In the midst of planning, life goes on. Dean and Eileen accompany a group of hunters to Montana to take care of a nest of vampires, and they successfully cure their two most recent victims. In Colorado, Mary and Jack are able to bring another new hunter into the network after assisting with sending a ghost to its final rest. When a trove of lore and artifacts is discovered in Texas, Castiel and Sam arrange its transportation to the bunker and as soon as it arrives they begin the task of cataloguing it.
Movement draws Dean’s eye, and he watches in astonishment as Michael and Gabriel’s wings fade into view, fully extended. Michael’s are a pure white, and Gabriel’s remind Dean of a red-tailed hawk. The wind buffets them but they remain unfurled, holding firm against the gale.
“They’re also both driven by a strong sense of duty. They’re self-sacrificing, and they’ve known suffering.” He pauses. “So nothing makes me happier than to see them right where they are today.” He looks over at them. “I can’t think of anyone more deserving of this” —he gestures at the room around them, at everyone who’s there for them— “more deserving of happiness… than them.” Dean looks down at the table and swallows hard, and Castiel squeezes his hand.
They’ve been on the road, as it were, for almost three months now; yesterday had been the first day of September.
Castiel places a warm hand on Dean’s cheek, and Dean reaches for Castiel’s shoulder and his hand grazes feathers. He opens his mouth to Castiel’s tongue, and grabs a fistful of his shirt and pulls him closer, as close as the chair between them will allow.
And praying to Cas.
The pace is steady, unhurried… with their numbers, there’s no need to rush.
Then comes the sound of a door being torn off its hinges and tossed aside, followed by an interminable pause… and a howl of agony that Dean associates with a particularly excruciating death. This sequence quickly repeats itself, and Dean realizes that whatever is out there, there’s more than one.
The pain won’t go away.
“God, you are… so beautiful,” Dean whispers.
“Nah, I got this. I know you’re itchin’ to dig into that library.” He starts to go, then turns back to Sam.
Castiel just nods.
Jack frowns. “What do you mean?”
“Considering everyone you know eventually winds up dead,” Crowley says, “it’s worth very little. Nevertheless, I admit I’m touched.” He smiles, and it’s only slightly mocking.
Across the lawn, Sam shouts, “Guys? Guys, you’re not supposed to do that yet!”
“Go to bed anyway.”
“They’re all connected. It’s called a mycorrhizal network.”
Eileen snorts. Castiel smiles at the pavement.
People are beginning to look around toward the DJ booth, wondering what’s going on. Dean finally tunes into the looping music, and Castiel enjoys the transition from ‘puzzled’ to ‘outraged.’
“What about Cas?” Claire asks.
An awful certainty floods Dean: this fight is taking everything the angels have. He has no idea what to do, but they have to do something. He tugs at Sam. “Come on!”
Dean brings two slices of blueberry to their table, and nods his approval after the first bite. “This is good pie,” he says, loading up another generous forkful.
Death seems to have realized this. His voice is calm as he speaks over the screaming wind. “I’m going to—” Thunder drowns out the rest of his words, but Dean catches the last one:
“I was thinkin’,” Dean says. He sets the chainsaw on the table, and Sam looks up from his staring contest with the coffeemaker. “We could build a fire pit in that clearing, huh?” Dean grins a little. “Once I get those downed trees cut up we can roll the pieces in there, set ’em up around the fire—free chairs!”
The original Death gazes at them impassively, eyes flicking between the three of them. His scythe—the one Dean had used to supposedly kill him—is propped against the wall behind him. Traditional and simplistic, it’s out of place in the sleek, ultra-modern library. He wonders now if the library has always been like this, or if Billie’s notions of grandeur had resulted in a remodel.
“And you could have outflown me,” Jack adds.
The branches of the trees sway, bright green leaves shimmering in the sunshine. From somewhere nearby comes the rattle call of a crow, and then with a clatter of wings the bird takes flight.
Dean says softly, “I remember you.”
Tears are streaming from her eyes. “Please…”
“Bazhong. Sichuan. China,” Castiel says. His chest is still heaving. “I was spit out… over the Atlantic.”
Dean startles, lifting his head and turning to find Gabriel smirking at him from the other side of the boat.
“In the meantime,” Dean says, rolling over to face Castiel, “we’re staying here until that fire burns out.” He kisses Castiel, long and slow. “And after that,” he murmurs, nuzzling Cas and kissing him again, “we’ll go home.”
“Oh, we didn’t actually bet anything.”
Castiel says, “I doubt he intended for me to become as involved in the story as I did, either.”
“The whole point of me coming up here was to be alone,” Dean says. “I’ll be fine.”
He pulls the centerboard almost all the way up, seizes the tiller, and points Kat so the wind is directly behind her; it fills the sail and the boat surges forward at a dead run.
Castiel nods. “Good.”
Sam frowns down at the floor for a moment before lifting his head. “Alright,” Sam says. Dean is gratified to see the acceptance in his eyes, even if it’s mingled with reserve.
Amara resumes the story. “When Chuck and I returned to Earth last year we went our separate ways, and he decided to try and exert his influence over you once again. But you wouldn’t kill Jack,” she says to Dean, and then she smiles at Sam. “And you shot him.
after dinner?” Dean asks.
Whatever is out there, it’s on the other side of the door.
“Dean,” Sam says patiently. “You finally have a life that you don’t have to document on the fly, with the crappy camera on one of your six burner phones.” He fixes Dean with a look that stills him. “You should have nice pictures,” he says. “So you can look back on them one day when you’re old. You should have them for Jack, and for Mom. And for our kids to see, one day.” Sam gestures between himself and Eileen, and Eileen is nodding.
And a blank frenzy in which he’d slaughtered five people—bad people, but
And he still hasn’t encountered anyone—or anything—else.
, he supposes he shouldn’t be surprised.
This had been their theory, though they’d never had it confirmed. Castiel regards Crowley. If he is honest with himself, Crowley’s demonic face is less prominent than he might have expected. “Would you like to come and have a drink?” he says finally, putting his blade away. “There are a lot of people here who’d be happy to toast you.”
But Dean reasons this is just another desert, and he survived the first one without getting cooked. So he’s pretty sure he’s not going to end up frostbitten, hypothermic, snow-blind, or sunburnt.
“You guys found a secret passageway?” Dean demands. “I missed a secret passageway?
Still, his heart wrenches to think about everything that comes next. Finding somewhere else, somewhere small that only needs to accommodate him. Packing his stuff up. Driving away for the last time. And having to explain to everyone else that it wasn’t right, wasn’t working.
, he’d have a chance to trick me into giving him my power, and then nothing would threaten him. And it worked. But of course he underestimated you.
Castiel walks into the library, holding a beer Bobby had handed him. He looks around the room, and through the sea of unfamiliar faces he picks out the ones he knows.
Here and there, they come up with a few small elements to add to the reception to personalize it, but they don’t go overboard. They also develop a security system: they’ll have plenty of warding, and upon arriving the guests will touch silver and iron. It’s not a perfect system, but they reason that any monster would have to be crazy to want to walk into a group like theirs. Demons are unlikely to show, since they haven’t been encountered in more than two years, but they still opt to include devil’s traps.
Dean glances at Sam and they slowly get to their feet.
He turns himself inside out trying to untangle what was Chuck’s control and what was his own free will, but whatever the truth is, it doesn’t matter.
Dean finds Jack in his room, lying on his bed with a contemplative expression on his face. There’s an empty cereal bowl on his nightstand, next to a white flash drive and a pair of headphones.
Something inside of Dean is slipping away. Memories. He doesn’t fight it; there are so many bad ones.
They spend hours on the water, until Dean is cruising around doing his own thing while Gabriel lounges with his eyes closed, seemingly asleep. By this point, Dean’s clothes, which got wet during their launch, are dry from the combined efforts of the sun and the wind. The perpetual day is, at least in this particular place, a beautiful one.
Death gives Dean an appraising look, then finally says, “Good luck to you, Dean Winchester.”
“Mom, too?” Dean’s expression is pained.
Jack looks over at him. “The Entity… it’s a very angry being. It hates noise, and being disturbed.”
“You’re in room 206,” the motel clerk says. “Up the stairs just out here” —he points— “and right around the corner.” He slides a keycard to Dean through the slot in the bulletproof glass. “Checkout’s at eleven.”
Sam grabs it and Jack pulls them back into the chase.
But it’s not enough; Dean’s leaning back with his full weight and it’s not enough.
One day, Rowena arrives at the bunker accompanied by a dark-haired woman with a slight but playful smile.
“What? Sammy, no—you know how this goes.”
“It’s probably for the best,” Jack says, stooping to pick up the rest of the packages of Reese’s from the floor. “Hey, can I see the rings? And can we watch
Castiel’s wings are unfurled behind him, and Dean stares; even in the moonlight he can see the rainbow sheen glinting off of every dark feather.
When Castiel slips his tongue into Dean’s mouth, Dean opens to him, hands tightening in his clothes. Castiel kisses him deeply before pushing the collar of his shirt aside to press a trail of kisses to his neck, tongue flicking over his skin, the way he’s wanted to all night.
“Yeah, and if you hadn’t, you woulda gotten killed.”
Jack nods, then says, “Let’s try talking to Michael for a while.”
Jack takes this in, then looks from Castiel to Dean, whose eyes are still closed, his hand covering half his face. “But…”
“You are no longer influenced by the Mark of Cain, yet you are consumed by rage.”
This is what Dean is thinking about, a couple of hours after leaving Death’s Library.
Afterward, Dean works with an icy, unhurried restraint—for how long, he can’t say. Long enough for her to die over and over again, each death further and further apart. Long enough for the screams to become the sweetest music he’s ever heard. Long enough for the cold that burns inside him to become a delicious pleasure.
A new memory, resurfacing from some dark place, the darkest place, from the beginning: a windowless room. Screaming and fire and blood and horror.
He turns and presses his back to the tree, his body sagging. Although he still feels that faint tugging through the pendant, the way forward is not as direct as it used to be.
There will be an epilogue and at least one bonus work, to be posted some time after this year’s DCBB wraps up in December, so I recommend subscribing. ✨
Dean’s breath hitches. “He’s in there because of me, Sam.” He grips the edge of the sink to ground himself. “So I’m not leaving without him. I can’t.”
“What? Oh, yeah.” Dean sits down at the table and rubs his forehead. “Yeah, no, that was good. What’d she say? Is everything alright?”
There is a stunned silence.
, Jack.
“The photographers, too,” Castiel adds. “And the ceremony will be at five.”
“Sam.” Dean is calm—serene, even. “I need you with me on this. If you don’t want to go, that’s fine—you and Jack can look for Michael. But you need to let me do this.”
“There was a larger force at work, as well,” she says. “Some effort on the part of creation itself to attempt to right the wrong that had been done so long ago. Which is, I think, how the Empty came to be the final resting place of angels. Why you,” she says to Death, “felt you ought to step aside and allow things to unfold the way that they did, which set me free.” She turns to Jack. “And how you survived your detonation in the Empty with both your grace and soul.”
Dean finally steps back, holding Sam at arm’s length, and he laughs. “Jesus, look at that beard!”
“Yeah,” Sam says patiently. “Eileen and I found a little house in Cawker City—”
He pulls out Baby’s keys.
The sound of dirt under his feet is another welcome distraction.
“Where’ve you guys been?” Chuck is smiling, but there’s an edge to his voice and a hard glint in his eyes.
“Dean—”
He’s sitting in a corner booth next to the window, leaning over a cup of coffee with both elbows resting on the table. Cars rush by on the nearby interstate as the snow swirls endlessly down and the light fades, but Dean isn’t aware of any of it. He stares into his coffee, hands curled loosely around the mug, and his mind is avoiding the reason he’s in a random diner over a hundred miles from home.
The house is on fire, and his father is placing six-month-old Sam in his arms and telling him to get his brother outside, and Dean holds him close and he runs, just runs…
Dean shakes his head. “Jack doesn’t want anything to do with Lucifer.”
“More because he feels useless without his powers.”
When Castiel first laid eyes upon him, he was a half-demon beast covered in someone else’s blood.
Dean hears the slightest rustle of leaves.
“It looks rustic. It’s nice.”
“I’m fairly certain she’s the most powerful witch in the world at this point,” Castiel says. He shrugs a shoulder and one of his wings flutters in a lazy mimicry of the movement.
Castiel takes a breath and says, “The history of creation as we knew it is a lie. Amara and Chuck aren’t the Darkness and God.” The same fury Dean had seen in Castiel’s eyes earlier sparks to life. “She is the creator. He is the destroyer.”
Crowley’s eyebrows lift and he makes a noncommittal sound, but his expression has softened in an indefinable way.
“You told me you love me,” she says, smiling.
Dean draws a breath, and he closes his eyes.
Castiel, smiling wistfully, saying,
Dean lies in his hospital bed, reeling. He grits out, “Why didn’t you just leave me there, then?”
He lies on his back in the sand with his eyes closed, pulling in deep, shuddering breaths. His injured hand rests on top of his chest, throbbing, and in his other hand he clutches the vial of Jack’s grace.
That night, there is a feast. With a snap of Gabriel’s fingers, food covers every available surface in the kitchen, and people pile their plates high. They grab beers and bottles of stronger stuff, and spill out into the war room and the library.
As Dean steps inside and closes the front door behind him, he lets out a long, slow breath, and when he looks up, there’s Cas in the living room doorframe, watching Dean, and Dean’s breath catches in his throat.
Castiel smiles at him, and he smiles back, but memories are flickering at the edge of his mind.
“Eventually, I created Castiel,” Amara says, her voice softening when she looks at him. A small smile lifts the corner of Castiel’s mouth, and Dean becomes aware of a dull ache in his chest.
“My entire life has been a bachelor party,” Dean says with a shake of his head. “I’m good.”
. The finality of it had shredded Dean. Guys like him and Cas? They don’t say stuff like that unless they’re never coming back. And most of the time, not even then; Dean thinks back on all the final goodbyes he’s had with Sam. No
Chuck folds his hands, appearing pleased that Dean has brought this up. “I am, yes.” He shrugs. “But knowing everything
Understanding passes over Castiel’s face. “That’s why you asked me to stay, earlier.”
The far-off train horn echoes mournfully, and Dean’s abruptly aware of how middle-of-the-night it feels. His phone screen says it’s 2:09.
As they’re lying on the floor of the library staring up at the ceiling, Sam realizes that for the first time since they set out, they’ve broken from their prayer schedule. He wonders whether Michael noticed the silence.
“Do you guys even have the space here?” Dean asks, frowning.
The feathers are a deep black, and as Dean stares he notices they have a subtle sheen to them, like an oil slick rainbow. Awestruck, Dean takes in Castiel’s wingspan; it’s at least a dozen feet, and some of the primary feathers at the tips of his wings are longer than Dean’s forearm.
Dean meets Sam and Jack in the archive room. He’s wearing his belt, equipped with the angel blade.
Dean crosses the threshold into the library, and he is seized in a giant hug.
“Beautiful,” he murmurs, and something inside of him is twisting, wrenching, and he understands, now, what people mean when they describe something as so beautiful that it hurts.
And things keep getting harder.
“Oh, of course,” Castiel says.
Reese’s.”
She smiles ruefully. “Yeah. Sorry if I woke you; I was trying to be quiet.”
“Cas,” he says, turning, “we gotta—” Dean stops short.
“What? It’s not even seven.”
Castiel makes a sound of protest. “Be careful—my boutonniere.”
Finally, he looks up at them. “I should be able to read every word in that book. The fact that I’m unable to is assuredly cause for concern. So I’ll help you.”
“Uh…” Dean pats his pockets, but there’s no jingle. “Yeah.” He trades a ten for a roll of quarters.
After Chuck had vanished, the damage caused by the storm and the fire had subtly reversed itself, and the picnic had appeared. Amara doesn’t seem to have the same flair for the dramatic as Chuck when it comes to using her powers; she doesn’t bother with snapping her fingers or making a show of things—she just gets stuff done.
Sam frowns. “Talk about a needle in a haystack, though.”
alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary comes over, holding up a boutonniere with white and blue flowers. “This can be your ‘something new,’” she says, smiling.
Seeing Billie again has brought those last moments with Castiel back to the forefront of his mind.
Castiel looks at Dean as he dries the whisk. Dean is frowning faintly as he washes a cutting board, seemingly just as quiet and preoccupied as he has been for the last week. But Castiel can’t find any reason not to believe him, so he says, “Well, thank you. I like this recipe.”
“After all,” Crowley adds, “look what you’ve done to this place.” He lifts a hand, indicating the forest. “All of this?” He seizes the branch of a sapling and gives it a good shake, rattling the leaves. “Very noisy.”
“And today, with this ceremony, we mark the moment your commitment takes on a deeper meaning.”
“Yeah, and we have to get out of here,” Dean says, trying to push past the strangeness that has settled over Castiel. “What did you do to the Entity? We were supposed to—” The ground shifts beneath Dean’s feet and he looks down to find himself ankle-deep in black goo. The grass is… melting.
“You left us. You left me. You’re always fucking
“You thought I might say no?”
A tremendous clap of thunder splits the sky. It sounds like the end of the world right inside Dean’s skull; it vibrates through his bones and leaves his knees unsteady.
“One thing—if you do capsize, make sure you grab onto the boat,” Gabriel says. “You could get swept away, and then that’s it for you.”
Jack doesn’t know it, but Dean tracks each gift and its place of origin in a small notebook. He keeps the notebook in a box on the shelf in his closet, along with one of Castiel’s primary feathers.
“What can you tell me about predicting the weather?” Dean asks, pulling in the mainsheet to reduce the flap of the sail.
“Oh, no?” Crowley lets out an amused chuckle. “I think you’re underestimating the strength of that shiny human soul of yours.”
“So what am I gonna call you?” he asks her. There had been no name on her hull.
“You bring goodness to this world just by being yourself. And we couldn’t have freed Amara without your help. I don’t just mean your power—if you and Sam hadn’t found Michael… Well, I’m pretty sure things wouldn’t have turned out the way they did today.”
Dean is kneeling in a sea of blood, head bowed.
“How’s semi-retirement?” Claire asks.
“Are they?”
you can find him—or any other archangel that might be lying around, for that matter. I haven’t got any of my usual tricks, see. This place is a no-fly zone, and who knows—could be permanent.”
“Dean!” Castiel says, exasperated. “It’s
Dean shakes his head. “Do not start with me.” He tugs Castiel closer by his lapels and straightens his bow tie. “What do your little blue ones mean?”
Wordlessly, they go down to the water, but Gabriel stands back as Dean wades into the water and prepares the boat to launch.
He dumps his clothes into his laundry basket and sits down on his bed, mindlessly running his hands over his thighs. He should probably eat something. He’s not all that hungry, but he could make BLTs—again—for him and Jack, and maybe Castiel will eat with them.
Dean rolls onto his side and his eyes land on the angel blade lying in the sand nearby. He scrambles for it, splashing on hands and knees through the surf.
“Maybe, yeah,” Dean says, sipping his coffee. “Throw it on the list, we’ll figure it out.”
“Dean Winchester,” Gadreel says.
“You know the first kind: it’s trying to pretend it’s not vegan. Hot wings made out of cauliflower and that kind of thing.” She takes a bite of her toast. “I’m not a huge fan of that.”
“We’re free,” Dean says, and at the same time the shackles fall away, and the weight is lifted… it’s as though he’s being handed something delicate and unspeakably precious.
There’s just one thing left to do now.
“Y’see,” Dean says, his tone philosophical, “it can’t just be your favorite music. It’s gotta be stuff people are gonna wanna dance to. And it’s gotta be
Something instrumental begins playing, and Castiel takes Dean’s hand in his right. He places his left hand on Dean’s shoulder as Dean’s hand settles on his lower back. They sway together, and Castiel focuses on Dean and does his best to ignore everyone surrounding them.
But Dean’s hand holding his keeps him from breaking apart, and he grasps it tightly. He whispers, “Yes.”
Jody waves a hand. “Of course Jack can stay with us. But it’s already after three and it’s a couple hours’ drive. Why don’t you stay the night? We’ll have dinner together and catch up and you can get up to the cabin tomorrow morning.”
He starts walking again, slowly, as if he can delay the inevitable, but the thing sits there waiting patiently for him. When he gets close he stops and regards it, hands on hips.
They lapse into silence again, and the sun continues its climb into the sky.
There isn’t much in the fridge. He should have eaten on the way home, but he just hadn’t had the appetite. Dean closes the fridge with a small frown.
Death nods, and Castiel places two fingers on his temple. Castiel’s eyes begin to glow, and Death’s face grows vacant.
He glances at his watch; it’s 11:55, and for a second he thinks it must be coming up to noon but he’s shocked to see that the date window still houses a seven—it’s not yet midnight. It feels like he’s slept for a year.
Jack and Mary are in the middle of an animated discussion about agriculture, while the two couples talk about a recent case in Massachusetts that some of their contacts had handled. When they hit a lull in the conversation, Sam finishes off his coffee and excuses himself to the restroom. Dean flags down a server for refills.
Dean nods; he hadn’t really expected anything different. “You wanna watch
“I’ll tell Jack to keep his senses alert,” Castiel says.
Claire’s voice is incredulous. “We’re fine! Are
Park benches bathed in sunshine.
“Yeah, I kinda figured. But Death didn’t say we needed Michael, specifically. He just said we needed ‘an archangel.’ Maybe you’ll get your powers back once we get out of here.”
“Yeah, I thought I better check her out and uh, take some notes on what I need to do to get her ready for the big day,” Dean says, gesturing at the notebook. “She’s got an important job to do.”
After a few hours, Dean spies something in the water that isn’t a wave.
“I couldn’t let anything happen to you,” Amara says softly.
Two: Exploded by Lucifer when they’d shown up at Stull, trying to stop the Apocalypse.
Dean blinks. “You’re still here?” he croaks.
“I know,” Sam says, laying a hand on Jack’s arm. He looks up at Michael. “We’ve been trying to reach you.”
To aid him in these tasks, he’s purchased a number of heavy-duty landscaping tools. He’s carrying the last one—his favorite—when he runs into Sam as he passes through the kitchen.
He looks up, and there’s a hand with polished fingernails sticking out of Chuck’s back, wrapped around the blade of the scythe like it’s a lifeline.
That is all, for a long time.
“I wasn’t!”
Castiel wipes his shoes and hangs his trenchcoat carefully so it drips onto the mat and not the floor. “What’re we having?” He spies a roasting pan cooling on top of the stove, and the cookbook from Alex rests on the stand nearby.
“Uh-huh.”
“Stop,” Dean says weakly, embarrassed.
He continues, “We can’t get married for real, because legally speaking, I’m dead and you don’t exist.” Dean rolls his eyes, but then his voice goes soft. “And you’re… y’know. Immortal.” He pauses. “I thought maybe you’d think it was pointless,” he admits.
Castiel tilts his head toward Baby. “You’re working on the car?”
,” and immediately takes another huge bite.
They move to the bed, laughing softly, grasping at each other’s naked skin as they kiss with growing need. Their laughter gives way to heavy breaths and broken sounds of desperate want. They burn off the day’s tension even as they build it anew, fingers raked through hair and hands clutching at straining limbs and lips pressed to bared throats.
Since Dean’s return from a hunt in South Carolina a week ago, he’s been uncharacteristically subdued. And Castiel’s concern has quietly grown, the longer it has lasted. But Dean’s prayer feels warm and good, and on the Celestial plane, Castiel’s wings unfurl as if reaching out to answer it. The corners of his mouth lift, almost as unconsciously as Dean’s prayer.
“Your ‘something borrowed,’” she says. She crosses the room to him, hand outstretched, her smile steady. “Cufflinks from Sam.”
Everyone including—
Their kiss becomes a hug, and Castiel whispers in Dean’s ear, “I love you.”
Dean opens his mouth to ask what is, in his opinion, the most important question, but Jack beats him to it.
Castiel takes a breath, clearly trying to be patient. “I don’t know what this spell has done to you, aside from granting you multidimensional vision, but we need to get you inside,” he says. He takes off his trenchcoat and Dean watches with fascination as he removes it. The coat goes through his wings without issue, although both remain solid in appearance.
Fumblingly, he finds the vial of Jack’s grace and then, with the last of his strength, he clamps his hand around Alastair’s, the pendant pressed between them.
Castiel raises an eyebrow and begins loosening his tie.
Michael’s face is impassive as he looks between them.
“Of course,” Michael says earnestly, and Gabriel is nodding. Castiel doesn’t say anything, but Dean isn’t feeling brave enough to glance at him; instead, he gazes up at rays of sunshine filtering down through huge, puffy clouds.
At one point Sam ushers him back onto the dance floor and pairs him up with Mary. They laugh and clasp hands as the current song ends, and Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” begins. As they dance, Dean notices them from across the room, so he hurries to Claire and drags her onto the floor, dancing with mock swagger. Claire laughs and loosens up, playing along.
As Dean makes his way along the passage he steps over the rocky ground carefully, favoring his knee. He keeps his eyes on the farthest point he can see ahead, and glances back over his shoulder often. He’s almost certain he’s alone, but he doesn’t loosen his grip on the blade.
Dean turns the TV on, muted, and flips channels.
“Vows,” Eileen says.
“He’s here,” Jack says. “He just got tired of us arguing with Michael about how long we should wait for you.”
Sam’s passed out in the back seat
Dean is too afraid to look, but he holds onto the image of that shining silver blade, and he reaches out a filthy, shaking hand.
But he can’t do it. He can’t.
“Oh, I’m sure that’s true—I know he’s a good kid—but it doesn’t matter. There’s still a connection for Lucifer to sense, to tug on. I think he’s got you on his line, and he’s just reeling you in.”
“Damn, I was gonna get some In-N-Out while I was there,” Dean says. “But no, that’s good. We’ll see you Sunday. And tell Eileen I like her better than you.” Dean smirks and hangs up before he can hear Sam’s reply, then goes to pour himself a cup of coffee.
home.
He thinks about the countless ways he’s let down the people he loves, with Sam and Cas and Jack at the forefront of his mind.
“How ’bout if we tell you what
“I do want it,” Dean says firmly. “I want it with you.”
Dean continues following the rock face and reaches a gully. From behind him, Crowley says, “How’d things go, anyway? After my heroic sacrifice.”
“Sam!” Dean yanks on Sam’s sleeve and they race into the fray. Into an epicenter rippling with power, where something baleful is seeping through the air, where the forces at play have some primal part of his brain screaming at him to flee.
“Speaking of,” Chuck says, “where is Jack, anyway?”
“Yeah.” Dean debates with himself for a second, but decides that since Gadreel gave up his life to help Cas, he can trust him. “I’m looking for Gabriel.” He pauses, then adds, “And Castiel.” There’s a brief, dull flare of anger in his chest.
Castiel thinks about this for a long moment.
Suddenly there are arms locked around him, and a sturdy presence at his back.
Dean relaxes a little, then, and Castiel reaches across the table and takes his hand.
Staring off into the distance, Gadreel says, “So are they.”

Castiel focuses on the sky once again. “Stare all you want,” he says with an amused smile.
Sam’s face twists in confusion. “How…”
“No, no, listen,” Dean says, holding up a hand, “words are really not my thing.” He shakes his head. “I knew if we had to write our own vows I’d screw it up. Plus… It’s not that I’m ashamed to say those kinds of things to you in front of other people, like stuff from the heart—
“I agree,” Eileen says as Sam returns. He sinks into his chair and Eileen says, “Now I am just pretending to talk to you.”
Castiel smiles at Dean. “I do.”
Dean looks at Castiel’s wings, at the way the firelight dances over the dark, shimmering feathers, and then he lifts a tentative hand to place it on Cas’ wing. He glances at Cas and his eyes are closed.
question surfaces and quickly grows white-hot, burning away every other thought.
“Libra contains one of the oldest stars in existence. In this universe, anyway,” Castiel says, gazing up at the sky. “Humans named it the Methuselah star.”
They both know that Dean can’t actually hold him… but they’ve found that, on occasion, they enjoy the pretense. At other times, Castiel puts his angelic strength to good use. Mostly, though, the only dynamic to their pleasure is the sense that they’re making up for lost time, so they each give and receive—sometimes with urgency, and sometimes leisurely.
So, as pages turn in the background, Dean focuses on his hands, and relaxes his jaw when he realizes he’s tensing up again, and doesn’t think about anything but the present. From time to time, Sam clears his throat, and Jack fidgets.
Dean kisses him, and it’s gentle and lingering. They part, and Dean strokes a hand over the edge of Castiel’s wing, a fond look on his face, before removing his pendant.
“Well, it’s not as if there are many of us left,” Castiel says.
Lucifer stops circling, with Dean at Castiel’s back and nothing standing between Castiel and the horde.
When everything has stopped spinning, he rolls onto his side and looks up at the slope. He can see where he’d climbed to, the snow disturbed by his fall.
,” Gabriel says, rolling his eyes as he rests his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath. He glances up at them. “Whatever door you opened wasn’t open for long.”
“No, no…” Dean whispers, shaking his head in dismay. He turns in a full circle. “No, you were supposed to be here.”
Later, Dean falls asleep on the couch in a patch of autumn sunshine. He wakes up briefly as Jack lays a blanket over him.
The only thing he can think about is the look on Castiel’s face when he’d found Dean in Hell and realized he was too late.
Castiel rolls his eyes.
“Would you like me to leave?”
He stares at the door, and briefly, he remembers another door. He remembers tearing it off its hinges.
“I took a five-hour nap earlier!” Dean pauses. “I do kinda wanna take a hot shower, though.”
I forgot to do something this week. Dude—” He swivels in his chair, finger pointed at Gabriel.
“It’s fine,” Castiel says tonelessly.
“Oh, yup.” Dean nods. “The scales.”
Gabriel joins the others and Dean’s eyes travel over the group. Every one of them has been changed by what they’ve been through.
The forest is more of a challenge, with rock outcroppings coming out of the mountainside and the occasional steep drop, but it’s still a far cry from the first forest he’d encountered. There is little undergrowth and the way is largely clear.
In high spirits, he sings “Immigrant Song” to her under his breath.
Castiel, sitting across from Eileen, signs, “I guess we should look like we’re busy talking.”
“Uh-huh?”
Dean makes a choked sound. He swallows his mouthful of food and then he’s laughing. “Sam didn’t mention that.”
Castiel shakes his head, but he wears a tiny smile. He sits up and takes Dean’s hand, bringing it to his lips to kiss the back of it, and Dean’s heartbeat stutters. “Thank you for saving me,” Castiel murmurs.
Castiel smiles. “You say that every time.”
“Cawker City’s right on a lake, and there’s a state park nearby,” Sam says. “It’s nice. And it’s like, a half-hour from the bunker.”
Jack’s frown softens as he admits, “Sometimes… praying doesn’t feel like enough. I wish I could do more. If I had my powers, this would be faster. Easier.”
“Oh, I don’t,” Chuck says easily. “I’m just wondering if he’s going to pop up here in a second as some kind of last-ditch effort to defeat me, or whatever. You get that Jack’s no match for me, right? Especially now that Amara and I have joined forces.”
?” Dean asks.
Through the trees is another clearing. It’s a beautiful, isolated spot where the light is perfect. Unprompted, Dean takes Castiel’s hand, pulls him to the center of the clearing, and plants a kiss on him.
Sam considers this, then he says, “They’re not the type to bide their time.”
Dean turns and Jack is frowning with concern.
Maybe he will go up to the cabin—it might be good to get away from the house and all its emptiness. He can take some time for himself and think about what he wants to do—because he isn’t sure he can do
Sam reaches for the same words he’s used many times a day now for weeks—no less heartfelt for how often they’ve been repeated:
Just past the threshold, Dean slows.
Gabriel takes a step closer to them. “Castiel… Did I see you
“You can’t expect it to be me—I’m only human.” Dean caresses Castiel’s wing and enjoys the sight of his eyes sliding closed, lips parting as a shudder passes through him.
“I’m gonna get cleaned up and get some rest,” Dean says.
Dean clenches his jaw, and Chuck eats some more popcorn, then says, “So listen, let’s just get this out of the way—I’m sure you’re going to ask me to bring everyone back but the answer on that is no.” He pops another few pieces of popcorn into his mouth, and as he’s swallowing he makes a circling motion with one finger. “This story’s wrapped up; we’re in the epilogue now.”
“I love you,” Dean breathes. “I’m in love with you.”
splits the air. Dean flinches and Lucifer crumples to the ground.
“Cas,” Dean gasps. “Hey, hey—Cas!” Castiel’s eyes are moving under his lids. “Wake up—I need you to wake up.”
They circle around Castiel’s wing to stand in front of him and Dean is dismayed to see that Castiel’s eyes are still glowing.
“Sam—I saw you and Jack out there in the big wide world a couple of times.” He grins slightly, like this is all in good fun. “I don’t really know what you were up to, but I also don’t really care. It seemed like you were doing some wholesome father-son bonding, and that stuff is way too boring for me. I like my stories…” He lifts a hand and clenches it thoughtfully. “Grittier.”
“Suddenly, he was losing control. You’d surprised him—both of you—and the injury seriously weakened him. He knew Castiel had been in the Empty and that the Entity was awake. I was also much less like the Darkness and more like my original self. He was terrified.
Finally, Sam says, “Rowena and I… We’ve bonded, I guess. Uh, shared trauma, you know. From Lucifer.”
A second hand emerges, and Dean lets go of the scythe to seize it in both of his. Amara’s grip on him is desperate and painful, but it doesn’t matter because saving her is the only thing that matters; he holds on just as desperately. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees that she’s let go of the scythe—still embedded in Chuck’s back—and Sam has her other hand.
are all gone. And once all the bread in the world goes bad, Dean’s not going to bother with baking his own. They won’t have electricity or running water for much longer, anyway.
Out on the road, Dean rolls his window down and the cool night air gusts through the cab. With the wheel in his hands and Baby’s engine purring, her headlights cutting through the dark, Dean’s mind is comfortably blank.
“Yes! Everything is fine. She was inviting us to come and see her and the girls,” Jack says with a small smile. “Donna spent Christmas with them and Patience is back for the holiday break, so everyone is there.”
They come up with a plan for finding each other once Dean returns—as if it’s any other case where they split up, with Dean going to the morgue and Sam talking to the locals.
He can see Dean in his mind’s eye, in that moment just before Death had sent him into the Empty: shoulders squared, weapon ready at his side, bravery and goodness personified. The hero Sam has admired his entire life. His older brother. Dean had looked over at him and Jack, and there had been the faintest reservation in his expression, but the corner of his mouth was lifted in a hint of a smile, just for them.
“Okay,” Dean says tightly, nodding.
“No, you didn’t wake me. The coffee did. Are you really about to chug some caffeine after a twelve-hour shift and overtime?” Dean asks, his eyebrows raised.
Before Dean can stop himself he thinks,
Amara sighs thoughtfully as night falls away, becoming a soft lilac twilight. “No. You have free will, as I intended. Chuck orchestrated certain events, and he wanted control over you, but he never truly had it. The choices you’ve made are your own.
Dean’s feet slide forward a few inches. “Hurry,” he grits out.
Alex sits down at the table across from Dean with her toast.
Dean settles himself back on the couch but Castiel doesn’t look over at him, just keeps staring into the fire. So Dean takes the opportunity to drink in the sight of his wings. Though they are tightly folded, the firelight illuminates a subtle shimmer; it reminds Dean of the fragile, opal sheen of a soap bubble. And although Castiel is sitting still as a statue, his wings move infinitesimally from time to time, in the same sort of way a person might make small involuntary movements, or shift to get more comfortable.
If Gadreel is right that he’s being followed by a small army bent on revenge—and Dean doesn’t have a reason to think he’s wrong—then Dean’s search for Cas is endangering him. And possibly the rest of the world, too, seeing as everyone’s looking to escape back into it.
Sam swallows. “Last night…” he says slowly, “was about three months ago for me.” Eileen’s eyes widen. “You disappeared, and then so did everyone else in the world, everyone except for me and Dean and Jack.”
“I actually kind of want to see how far they take it?” Eileen says, squinting and cautiously increasing the distance between her hands.
Gabriel stuffs a peanut butter cup into his mouth and takes the paper, sweeping his eyes over it.
Dean stares at them as they settle, and then looks into Castiel’s eyes. “No.” His teeth start chattering but he takes a step back, out of Castiel’s reach.
Dean continues, “The whole time I was in there, I kept remembering things—you and me. Over the years.” He smiles a little. “You’re the best friend I’ve ever had. And when I was trying to find you, I realized that we just… we
He uses the mainsheet to get back to Kat. She’s fully overturned, sail submerged. Dean pulls himself up onto the hull, then frantically checks to make sure he’s still wearing Jack’s grace and his angel blade.
“Your—” Dean breaks off and draws a breath, at a loss for words.
Jack’s set them down right outside the library, a freestanding building that hadn’t sustained any damage. It’s unchanged from the last time they’d seen it—even the few scattered backpacks on the walkway leading up to the doors are still lying where they’d fallen when their owners had disappeared.
“I’ve got you,” Castiel whispers, his arms tight around Dean. Dean sucks in a shaky lungful of air.
“Yeah,
Jack smiles. “My mom told me that. Well, kind of.” He shrugs, then says earnestly, “Thanks, Sam.”
So he’d sat in the darkness for a long moment, thinking about Genesis—
Alastair holds Dean’s face underwater and Dean flails, manages to gouge at Alastair’s eye. The pressure lets up and he explodes out of the water, going for the blade, but Alastair seizes the collar of his jacket and hauls him backward. Dean strikes out with an elbow, then whirls and plants his boot squarely in a kneecap, and as Alastair goes down he pulls Dean with him.
Dean goes cold. “You fucking bastard.”
Jack says, “So you were just ignoring us?”
Castiel schools his expression. “It’s true,” he says evenly. “I have dibs on Sam as best man.”
They’d found that while grocery stores were tempting for the variety they offered, they were horrific to set foot into. Sam still shudders at the memory of the first and only time they’d gone into a grocery store: floors awash with whatever had leaked from dozens of coolers and freezers, rotting meat and produce, rancid dairy… and the air was alive with the buzzing and movement of thousands upon thousands of flies.
Jack instructs them to stand back, and they watch as the glimmering vial of grace in his hand transforms into a silvery, burning arrow. He unwraps the object to reveal an impressive bow, and Dean looks on in fascination as Jack lifts the weapon with calm purpose, nocks the arrow, and draws the bowstring back.
“Alright, deal. But my suggestion is a superior way to start the day.”
“But… how is that possible?” Sam says, sounding baffled. “
Before he can launch into his rant, Castiel cuts in with a chilly, “Hello, Gabriel.” Dean huffs indignantly as Gabriel regards them with a smirk, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. Castiel rests his forearms on the table and raises an eyebrow. “You should know your theatrics have you on thin ice with my fiancé,” he says. Castiel glances at Dean and is pleased to see his expression smooth over, a tiny smile quirking the corner of his mouth.
Finally, he grabs his duffel from the car, locks her up, and hurries into the cabin. There’s no snow on the ground yet, but it’s close to freezing and he doesn’t have any interest in standing around in the cold for longer than he has to.
His eyes on Chuck, Dean says, “Where’ve we been, Sam?”
Sam inhales sharply through his nose, then takes her face in his hands. He presses his mouth more firmly to hers, parting her lips with his tongue and kissing her deeply.
On the hour, they pull on their backpacks and depart; Jack flies them to the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. They land in morning sunshine on the cobblestones, a short distance from the large wooden double doors. Remarkably, the place seems to be undamaged.
“You want to say all that stuff to me and tell me you love me, just so you can sacrifice yourself?” Certain vicious words are eager to spill from his lips, but he swallows them down and chooses different ones instead: “
They close their eyes and begin their silent prayers to Michael. Early on, they’d reckoned that the both of them praying simultaneously would be more effective than if they prayed aloud, taking it in turns.
Staring at Baby’s keys, his mind drifts back to a night in the Impala, like so many others. He’d been stretched out in the front seat, Sam asleep in the back seat.
Crowley shrugs affably. “Course it was.”
A great wave brings Kat far in on the beach—sandy, Dean is relieved to see—and he jumps out, an astonished laugh bursting from him as his feet hit solid ground. His knees buckle and he grabs Kat to hold himself up, then hauls her further up onto the sand. Another cold wave washes in, helping him in his efforts and soaking him in the process.
Jack. Dean nods and says, “Yeah, I might know something about that.” He stows his blade and walks past Crowley to push onward into the forest.
They collapse together and lie boneless for a while, their breathing slowly returning to normal.
And then Dean remembers, and his eyes fly open.
Sam says, “You’ll probably be busy helping Amara get stuff sorted out, but you’re welcome any time.”
A figure steps out from behind the rocks.
Terror shoots through him at the thought of falling on his blade.
Dean steps closer and lifts a hand to touch him, but then pulls it back, thinking that maybe he shouldn’t.
Over Castiel’s shoulder, Dean catches a flash of movement in the forest. Gabriel. He opens his mouth to call out to him when he hears a familiar voice behind him.
“What?” Dean blinks and refocuses on Castiel.
They get in the shower and soap each other up with gentle hands, pausing often to kiss, and when they turn the water off they can hear that it’s begun to rain.
“Yeah,” Dean says.
They arrive at the bunker ahead of the others. There’s no one around, but the road leading up to the bunker’s front entrance is lined on either side with cars, and eventually people had begun to park on the grass. Dean cruises to the spaces that have been reserved for the wedding party, and admires some of the classic cars he spots along the way. He reassures Baby that she’s still the best of them all.
Crowley joins him. “We ran into each other on the way here, but we split up when we reached the valley. He slipped into the crowd and I went into the woods.”
Crowley gazes out at the thousands of angels and demons who are sprawled on the valley floor, many of them piled atop each other. “You’re joking.”
An easy silence stretches between them as they nurse their beers, lost in their own thoughts. Air whooshes through the vents, and the general hum of appliance electricity is so normal as to feel odd.
Sam finishes in the library and goes to the map table. A lantern illuminates a sprawling pile of stuff that he and Jack have gathered from throughout the bunker to pack into two large hiking backpacks.
Day after day, he puts one foot in front of the other through the snow, dimly following the pull, sometimes wandering off course. The brutal cold has forced him to retreat inside himself, and it’s far from a refuge.
He thinks about how they were thrown together by fate, and about how they chose each other anyway. He thinks about how, despite Chuck’s fixation on him and Sam, Cas has always been there, always been instrumental in their fights to save the world. How many times have they all given Chuck’s story the middle finger? How many times have they tossed out the endings they were supposed to have?
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean grins and squeezes Castiel’s wrists—an instruction to stay put—before he pulls his hands away and begins unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt. “Hell yeah, I’ve got it all planned out.” Castiel’s heart is racing, and Dean’s fingers are slow.
“Yep,” Sam says, writing all of this down.
“What do you think of that, huh?” he says, grinning a little. “Not a perfect match, as far as lyrics go, but pretty damn good, I’d say.”
Sam’s face lights up. “Could you?”
“I dunno, you seem like you’re not gettin’ enough sleep.”
Dean can’t see anymore; everything is white fuzz shot through with sparks, and there’s a pleasant tingling throughout his body, like he’s carbonated.
He gets out of the pool and dresses with shaking hands.
Unable to look at the shining being before him, Dean reaches out a filthy, shaking hand.
Jack’s eyes are glowing golden now. He aims the arrow at the center of the sigil in the sandbox and chants something in Enochian. Castiel leans over and murmurs in Dean’s ear, “‘By my beating heart,’” and a shiver zips up Dean’s spine. He can’t tell if it’s the tickly warmth of Cas’ breath or the words themselves, but he doesn’t have time to think about it, because Jack releases the arrow and there’s a blinding flash of light.
The group of hunters Dean had been conversing with erupt into laughter and drag him onto the dance floor, and the girls spot Castiel and pull him into their circle. Nearly everyone surges onto the dance floor to “Shake it Off,” and there’s no denying it’s one of the night’s hits.
Dean steps out into the desert, and he doesn’t look back.
“Mom’s this time,” Sam says.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” Dean says. “You found out Cas’ ring size for me. I made our wedding rings when I went to South Carolina. They’re upstairs; I’ll show ’em to you later, if you want.”
Amara stares at the place he’d been standing for a long moment, then turns to everyone and says quietly, “I think I’d like a cup of tea.”
The tail of it disappears into his mouth, and Castiel’s eyes begin to glow. “Dean, get down!”
And then he remembers.
The sight pains him, so he refocuses on what’s ahead of him—and suddenly comes across a set of footprints in the wet sand.
Sam nods. “Alright. Let’s get this stuff packed up and we’ll get going.”
Sam digs out a flashlight while Jack scans the building, eyes glowing. “It’s safe,” he says. Sam clicks on the flashlight and they head inside.
Death doesn’t reply to either of them, just holds out a hand. “May I have that, please?” he says to Jack.
Content warning: post-apocalyptic destruction.
“And then there’s us. And what do we do with ourselves?” Now Alex smiles wryly. “Work.”
He thinks about celestial objects, and beings. Loneliness expands inside of him like celestial nothingness. He shivers and clenches his jaw to stop his teeth from chattering.
“I know, but it would make me feel better.”
Jack nods. “And that we should all promise not to make any more” —he yawns suddenly— “secret deals.”
Dean’s taken off his jacket and button-up; they’re tied around his waist in a way that covers the angel blade, which had become superheated after a few hours in the sun. Even his watch had become uncomfortable, and seeing as it was useless here anyway, he’d stuck it in one of his jacket pockets.
