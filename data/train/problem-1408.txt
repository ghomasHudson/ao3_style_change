He got an owl on the last day of his first year in Ilvermony from Hogwarts. John was excited to go back to the United Kingdom, it being three years since he left. He was also curious to what house he would be sorted in. He was a Pukwudgie in Ilvermony, and according to sources (yes, sources), the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff houses of Hogwarts had similar traits to Pukwudgie.
“Isn’t obvious Stamford? He has been in the States for the past three years, finishing his first year in Ilvermony as a Pukwudgie. Furthermore, he is a muggle-born, thus his parents not knowing your parents. My only question is, was it your left foot or arm that got shot during the incident that took your mother’s and brother’s life when you were four?” Sherlock asked, staring at John intensely.
Reaching home, he found everything to be packed and ready to be shipped. During the travel, John told his dad everything about the Wizarding World, and had to remind himself from not speaking loudly, as wizardry wasn’t known to all. He told him how he was saddened by the fact that there would be no Flying classes in second year, but if (no, when) he made it into the quidditch team, he would be able to practice his flying. He was thrilled, to say the least.
“Welcome to the Summer Quidditch Tournament. This end of year, a lot of persuasive students have made a dream come true. Yes, your muggle-born seniors have added a kiss cam to our Quidditch match today. Professor Flitwick will let you know more about the kiss cams.” The MC said, handing over the microphone to Flitwick. He told what a kiss cam was, as the teams came out.
“It is better than how it felt when I saw myself in the mirror.” John chuckled nervously, and that made Sherlock open his eyes.
Sherlock walked out of there as quickly as possible, only to get caught by a professor and earn himself a detention.
John found Sherlock later during dinner, near Mike and Molly, who were talking with one another. There was something odd with Sherlock. He was acting strange. John was now able to read the subtle changes that Sherlock used to express. Sherlock looked nervous, and kind of scared. John went to sit near him and get to the bottom of it. “Hey! How was everyone’s day?” Sherlock flinched, slightly, when John’s knees touched his.
It was the last month of second year when Sherlock and John found the Mirror of Erised. By that time both Sherlock and John’s friendship had developed so much. Meaning, both had developed feelings for the other, but due to fear of ruining their friendship, both hadn’t admitted to themselves yet. Mike, Molly, and Flitwick were annoyed to say the least. The two were walking on eggshells around each other, and no one was liking it.
Sherlock noted this information down in his mind, he didn’t know why. So, Stamford and Watson knew each other prior to this. He shall get to know more about Watson through Stamford then.
Professor Flitwick couldn’t help but notice how happy Sherlock was with John. He had never seen Sherlock smile before, but now, that was all Sherlock did. John thought that Sherlock hadn’t noticed his absence, but Sherlock subconsciously did. Flitwick noticed how Sherlock stopped smiling and had returned to being his old self for that time. He knew there was something brewing between the two. Or maybe it is brewed, yet to be acknowledged. The second year Charms class was shared between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, and the two always sat with each other, perfecting the charm in the first few minutes easily, and tended to Sherlock’s research. Flitwick found it cute how the two were inseparable since the day met. To say the least, they both were each other’s missing puzzle piece.
John excelled in all his subjects in Ilvermony during his first year. He was introduced to weird sweets and awe-inspiring sports by his mates. He was interested in History of Magic as this was all new to him, but he outclasses Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Flying. He was informed by his friends that one can join their school Quidditch team during their second year, and it was true everywhere. His friends knew that he would be leaving to Hogwarts after the first year, but they talked with him, including him in their group.
Sherlock was shocked. John was his match? How was he not able to see that coming?
“Is it magic?” John asked, curious to understand how Sherlock was able to do that.
After losing his mum and sister Harriot to a brutal shooting incident, Dad wanted to make sure that he was alright all the time. And John was grateful for it. Yes, he was sad that they had to move a lot, but he had Dad, and Dad had him.
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes.” He replied, taking the hand, and giving a firm shake. And that was the beginning to a new friendship between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, and an end to a high functioning sociopath, and a start to two high functioning boys.
Sherlock sat up straighter, staring him down. “I guess you don’t want to listen to it then?”
John laughed. “Not remotely.” He flexed his hand and rolled his neck. “Okay.”
John nodded. “What of them?”
I’ve learned about since meeting Sherlock has been connected in some way or another.”
“Oh. Yes. If you don’t mind.”
In that moment, John knew what he had to do, what he needed—wanted—to say. “This is it for me.
Sherlock worried his lip as he stared into his tea as if it could give him the answers. “That part is … troubling,” he finally said.
me to not be able to find him. I searched for
“Camera there,” he continued, pointing to the ceiling corner containing the security camera. “Simon’s stayed on the whole time? No interruptions in the feed, blips that could mean it was tampered with?”
John made his way haltingly through the park, trying to focus more on the beautiful winter day rather than the pain in his leg, the ache in his shoulder, or the tremor in his hand. It wasn’t working. He’d just decided to head back to his flat when he heard someone calling his name.
Then, Keith Dabic disappeared, two months after John had originally spoken with him. There was no reason to think he was dead, despite his insistence he only had a few months left to live after hearing the Unsound, but one day he just was … gone. John heard about it through an email a fan had sent. Sherlock, of course, thought nothing of it, saying it was just another mentally disturbed man who couldn’t take living in reality anymore and had just decided to leave it all behind.
The words startle John. “It’s funny…” he begins slowly, “how one event can be seen in different ways.”
. But she mentioned tea, it’s cold, and I want some. If she gets a cup out of it, well, that’s not the end of the world, I reckon.” He paused. “Literally, in this case.”
It turned out Eurus would be in London for a writing workshop a week after John emailed her, so they agreed to meet for lunch. John arrived first, having stormed out of the flat after one of the usual tiffs with Sherlock, who was still in a right state, their talk about Eurus having only been a reprieve. He’d worked out most of his frustration on the long walk to the restaurant and was now feeling anxious for Sherlock’s sister to arrive. He wondered if she had Sherlock and Mycroft’s gift for observation. Was she acerbic like Sherlock or shiftily diplomatic like Mycroft? Did she still believe in the paranormal?
“The same shadow.”
John realized then, why she’d come. She wanted to distract them. Not in an evil way, but in an

“The last thing I need is another sibling sticking their nose in my business. I’ve already got Mycroft taking you away on a regular basis.”
“I wasn’t pretending. I really did see them. Did until puberty. Same as Sherlock.”
“Then why is it upside down?”
Sherlock shook his head. “Something … something I thought was a fake at first—just someone trying to rile me up—but it contained things only Victor and I would understand. References to books and places we only talked about in private. What if … what if he’s still alive, John?” His voice was small, confused, worried.
“Seriously, Sherlock? This couldn’t wait until normal functioning hours?”
“Where are they?
“Sherlock?” he asked, setting the plate on the bedside table so he could examine the nearest covered wall.
Sherlock turns around to face John. “You don’t have a tea date with Mrs. Hudson.”
“Well, I’d offer you tea, but …” Simon gestured to the rundown space around them.
would kill him within a year? But still he hesitated. His love of horror stories and urban myths meant that just a tiny bit of him wanted to believe it was true. No, not
Two days after the call, they found themselves in Liverpool, where they stayed the night and waited for coordinates and a time from Simon. The next morning, after a text from Simon, they headed west into Wales. The sat-nav in their hired care pointed them near a town called St Asaph. They followed a small road out of town to an even smaller lane guarded by trees gilded with autumn colors. John wished they were there under better circumstances. The view was breathtaking. Granted, they would never come to such a spot simply for leaf peeping. That was far too prosaic for Sherlock. But it was nice to think about.
“Sort of. Just a few weeks ago, Simon seems to have attacked a fellow patient.”
“John, what are you doing in here?”
“Well, you may be in luck.” Mike beamed at him. “It’s not the front lines, but I might have a position for you. A new column I’m wanting to develop.” He looked at his watch, then reached for his wallet. “Look, I’ve got a meeting to get to, but if you’re interested in some work, give me a call. But don’t take too long, these positions go fast.”
“No. No,” John argued. “You don’t get to do this now. This is serious, Sherlock. You could be in real danger, from real people.”
“Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at uni together.”
“Because you’re Sherlock Holmes, of course,” John said with a grin and an elbow nudge. Sherlock frowned, so he continued. “Seriously though? If you don’t, you don’t. We go home, add it to the scarlet files, and life continues, with you running after theories and me trailing behind, trying to write it all down.”
Simon pull a USB drive out of his pocket and proffered it. When Sherlock refused to take it, John sighed and grabbed it himself. “This better not have a virus on it,” he muttered.
Eleven voicemails and a trip to his office (or was it his flat?)—where John had charmed Holmes’s assistant, a sweet woman called Mrs. Hudson—later, John checked his own voicemail to find a message from Holmes himself. The smooth baritone was unexpected but not unwelcome. He called the man back right away and set up a meeting. Twelve hours later, he was back at Holmes’s office/home.
“Okay. Good.”
There was movement across the field. People were bent over the ground, carefully sifting their own chalk/blood combo to create the necessary symbols. A group of children were huddled to one side, watched over by a man. John thought he recognized Sammy in the group, but it was hard to tell from the distance. Joining the four mini Stonehenge-like boulders, which John recognized from pictures, was a fifth boulder centered inside the others. The focal point. The linchpin. If it had been smaller, they might have been able to destroy it, but for a rock that size, they’d need explosives, which would put the children at risk.
An acolyte of Herman’s, Soběslav, created a new version of the codex while consumed with anger over Herman’s death and the selling of the bible. His new bible was different, however—evil, some said—and the Order was supposedly built on the foundations of that new codex, or
“Okay.” John wasn’t understanding the connection. Different locations, different types of events, different filming devices.
“Sherlock,” he said lowly, rolling to his side and putting his hand gently on his friend’s arm. Sherlock did not react. He tried again, a little more firmly. “Sherlock. It’s alright. You’re safe.” Sherlock’s hand came up to grip John tightly. His palm was sweaty. “Sherlock. It’s John. I’ve got you. You’re safe. It’s just a dream.” He kept murmuring until Sherlock let out a sigh, his grip loosened, and his body stilled.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth went up. “That you are. Well then. Shall we go?” He waved the server down for the bill, and then they headed out into the cold January night.
The change happened after Mary died, after the drugs had been flushed from his system. On that day—they day they had forgiven each other, the day they’d finally really seen each other, the day John finally got to touch Sherlock, to hold him close and breathe him in—Sherlock said he wanted to see Rosie, and John had believed him. A week later, John and Rosie had arrived at Baker Street to a tidied flat and a box of toys (educational aids, Sherlock had insisted). The nickname had appeared not long after, John’s only hint of why coming from a muttered “Your father gets seniority on the Watson moniker, so it’ll have to be something else for you” from Sherlock to Rosie.
Sherlock stayed silent, his face set in a scowl, his eyes looking away from John, which meant he didn’t have a good argument and hoped to just out-silence John.
“Those children aren’t willing.”
His and Sherlock’s continued sleeplessness didn’t help. They were both irritable and short tempered, and John was having trouble thinking clearly. Every time he closed his eyes, specters and eerie symbols chased after him, causing death and chaos. He wondered briefly what was keeping Sherlock awake, but was too tired to even ask.
John gave a low chuckle. “Works for me. But for now … I love you, and I’ll be with you until the end, alright? I’ll have your back, tomorrow and always.”
“Not that I’m aware of.”
A little spark of warmth always lit in John’s chest to hear the “we” Sherlock used when talking to someone during a case. John did very little on this end of things, but Sherlock always acted like it was a team effort.
Eurus laughed, her eyes crinkling endearingly. “You’ve got spunk. Definitely a good trait in anyone who wants to survive around Sherlock. I’ve been up late every night doing research. What’s your excuse?”
“And the Order gives this date great power.”
“Mmm. The same cannot be said about most journalists, you know.” John could feel Sherlock relaxing next to him.
without you.”
“Ugh. As terrible as that is, you won’t scare me away, Sher,” Eurus said, though she retreated from the chair to the kitchen. John joined her.
This time, John had proof—seen by Sherlock almost a year ago—that Wendy wasn’t making things up based on Sammy’s case. Via emails with Wendy, John learned that like both Sammy and Katie, shadows had been seen near Kurt almost since his birth. And the same double circle and pentagram symbol had been found carved under his cot.
“Um, no. I, uh, brought it up after someone gave me your name.”
It’s normal to learn about a friend’s history slowly over time. It’s not like we walk around with a file folder with our entire life stories that we give to new friends to read. And I’m fine with that. That’s one of the fun parts about a new friendship, learning what makes them tick. But with Sherlock, he knows all about you in thirty seconds. He can read your history in the set of your shoulders, the colour of your tie, the music you listen to when you’re stressed. And it’s amazing to see, no doubt, but it’s also frustrating and one sided. He knows so much about me, while I know so little about him. So, when I was tipped off about a person in Sherlock’s past, I just had to investigate.
“No, even when I believed, I was mostly frustrated that so much of the myth made no sense unless you believed in magic, which I’d seen no evidence of to that point. Even
“Oh,” Sherlock said softly.
“They're separated right now, aren't they?”
“Let me see.” The video showed a hand reach out and open the glass door. “There's nothing out there.”
“I’m your landlady, not your assistant, Sherlock!” called Mrs. Hudson from the foot of the stairs. “Get the file yourself.”
He worked on his post for a few more minutes before he was distracted by his phone trying to vibrate off the desk. He grabbed it and answered.
“Nothing we can do to stop them, huh?”
“Yeah.”
John perked up. “Oh? Like that monk at Glushka?”
Sherlock sighed and looked back at Simon. “So, it’s happening at Boulder Field on the first of November. What else do you know? Assuming we choose to believe you, that is. You mentioned the Unsound.”
“Ah yes, the second thing.” Sherlock steepled his hands in front of his lips in his usual thinking pose but kept his eyes on John while he continued.
John looked to Fred, who was wide-eyed. “I didn’t say who was coming to visit him.”
So I’ve become accustomed to the creepiness of some of Sherlock’s cases—both scarlet and otherwise—over the last few months, but for the most part, said creepiness happens before I’m on the scene. My time is usually spent just watching Sherlock cut everyone in the room down. But for once, I got to watch an event unfold before my eyes, or, well, adjacent to them. It was … an experience to the say the least. Maybe it’s just the spookiness invoked by the person we were interviewing, but it feels like it could be real. That maybe the paranormal isn’t as made up as Sherlock would like it to be. I’m man enough to admit that, at the very least, it’s given me a few unsettling dreams.
November. I’m writing this on Halloween night. Tomorrow we go into battle.
“No,” he finally admitted quietly.
“This one,” Sherlock pointed to what looked like a circle with numbers. “The numbers with the face inside? It’s demonic. An elemental, called Asog, Aka Manah, Grigori.”
Fred Barnes met them in the lobby and led them to the south wing, where Simon’s room sat. “He’s with his therapist now. I thought you might want to see his room before talking with him,” Barnes explained, pushing open the door.
Yup, you read that right. We. Along with moving into the upstairs room of Sherlock’s flat, I’ve also taken on the role of his old team in helping him investigate paranormal cases. So, this series of blog posts will no longer be me investigating Sherlock Holmes, but instead will be the two of us looking further into the scarlet file cases, along with anything new that comes our way. I don’t know how long this series will last, but I’m grateful that Mike was amenable to the switch in topic. For now, expect weekly updates for the foreseeable future.
She sipped her tea. “I was a light sleeper, and I’d hear him get up sometimes. One time, early on, I thought he was making hot cocoa, and I wanted some so I got up and followed him, but he didn’t go to the kitchen. He went to the porch and stared out through the doors to the back garden.” She frowned and rubbed an arm. “Just … stared. I tried talking to him, but he wouldn’t reply. I must’ve been four at the time, so you were five.” She swung her gaze to study her brother. “Were you looking at the tall men?”
“It was studied by the likes of Pythagoras and Kepler, yes, but it’s also thought to have occult properties. Satan wanting to usurp the perfect math that God created, bringing chaos to order, et cetera.” Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. “But these equations accompanying the Golden Ratio were used in medieval churches to create a devil’s door to allow evil spirits to escape during baptisms. But those were always on north walls,
“Coffee shop, really John? Little cliché, isn’t it? And why do you need to date anyway? It’s ridiculous.”
relationship, but then again, neither were they. It wasn’t a surprise, because it was Sherlock, who had never seemed particularly interested in gross matter, except when it was under a microscope or on a slab at the morgue. And John was a grown man who’d sowed his wild oats across three continents, who knew how to take things in hand, as it were (in the shower, where it was easy to clean up), when he felt the urge. What mattered was that they had each other, and they were happy and comfortable.
“Like the Salem Witch Trials?” guessed John. “One person being ‘infected’ and passing it on to the next?” That earned him a small smile of approval. John felt his stomach flip but ignored it.
John squinted. “A bit of damp?” he guessed, looking over at Sherlock. Sherlock rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the name. “Thirty-six.”
“I don’t require any answer. I just needed you to know.”
“I heard ya.” John turned a page of the newspaper and forced himself not to look up at Sherlock. He was already aware of the ways he tried to get attention and was determined not to give in to the man.
“You’re an interesting man, Mr. Holmes,” was out of his mouth before he had time to stop it. God. Now he’d look like a groupie.
writing an article on the man. The more exciting it was, the better for his image. Perhaps it would even mean an uptick in cases. But was it more than that? There was definitely something crackling between them. A good potential partnership at the least. Understanding. Chemistry. John wasn’t ready to figure out what that meant exactly.
“For at least a year.”
John stepped toward his partner, then realize he couldn’t. The last symbol needed to be finished—that was more important to their plan (thought not to John himself). He stumbled toward where Eurus had left the last symbol unfinished. Dare he even try? He’d only looked over the sheet vaguely, and if he got it wrong, it could make things worse. Something flashed, he looked up to see the center stone glowing.
“I’ve found him.”
Soon after the Torres’s wedding, strange things began happening to them. They consulted several experts, including Philip Anderson, with no success. That’s when they went to Sherlock. Appliances starting on their own, people asking about his tall friend when he’d clearly been somewhere alone, random noises in the home, feelings of being followed. Torres’s wife, Maria, started getting jumpy. She was the one who called in first priests, then investigators. Something happened when Sherlock was called in, because they stopped looking into it soon after. John was dying to know the details.
“Makes you think of horror films?”
“So?” Sherlock asked.
“John!” Sherlock looked betrayed.
“Anything I can do to help?”
Sherlock muttered, “so two weeks ago then.”
John is complaining about not having the correct color of thread when Sherlock slams his laptop shut. “Why don’t you just move in for real? Then you’d have whatever color of thread you’d need at your disposal!”
John groaned and rubbed a hand over his face. “What did I do to be saddled with
“Hmm.”
John dropped tea leaves in the pot while the kettle heated and chuckled. The man himself had looked drained and not up to any deep interrogation. He’d let them go an hour after picking them up from the train station, but had bundled Eurus up after hasty goodbyes at Whitehall.
Victor Trevor and Sherlock Holmes met around age 14. John couldn’t find much on their friendship, but there were pictures in a class paper, Sherlock looking even more baby-faced than he currently was, and more carefree too. They had stayed friends, both going to Oxford, though studying at different colleges. Though information on their friendship was sparse, he did find some academic awards and articles from their respective college newspapers, showing that Victor was almost as smart as Sherlock, but definitely more social. Victor had gone on to get his masters while Sherlock decided on a second degree in another field, and then a third. Through it all, they stayed friends.
Okay, I’ll admit it. I suffer from a major case of apophenia (dear God, how I hate that word). You try living with a man who investigates the paranormal for a living, and you’ll start seeing patterns in everything too. I don’t know how Sherlock has lasted this long without going completely mad, or at the very least, paranoid. Can it really be as simple as, if you buy a shirt/car/watch, all of a sudden you see it everywhere? Maybe.
“Oh, they each have their place. Plus, I’m past that now.”
Sherlock twisted his body so that he was partially sitting up. He looked like a dog who had just been shown a new chew toy. It was far more endearing than it should have been. “What did you have in mind?”
“Because the killer is smart. Or they
Which, how
“We’re not–”
“How?” John asked again.
“He kidnapped and grilled me.”
“So a few people listened to the songs on my blog,” John argued. “I don’t have
“I spoke with the night janitor on my way out. He'd already cleaned that wing of the building, there was nobody but me. And there was something else.” Robert hesitated before continuing. “As I was leaving, he asked me if my friend was gonna be staying, and if so, he would need to sign in.”
“I can’t believe Sherlock Holmes is asking me to be patient,” John teased.
portion of the magazine. Sure, John’d written up columns that had ended up on websites, but it was still serious writing, done by actual adults. In his new job, he’d be working with kids half his age, using a language that was beyond him, and talking about subjects far below his old pay grade.
“You used it to offer the reward,” John concluded, sipping his lapsang souchong, letting the smoky warmth curl up cozily in his belly. The room was far more comforting than his own cold, gray bedsit. He was glad he hadn’t decided to wait until later to do this. It was a perfect end to his unexpected, exciting day.
John deleted the last sentence and rewrote it. “You say that about all of them, love.”
“What’s that?”
“I fucking hate apophenia.” John rolled his neck. “Well, then I guess I believe Simon. If there’s even a chance that children will be harmed, I have to help.”
Sherlock cocked his head. “Text me the address. I’ll be right behind you.”
?” Sherlock called, rolling down the passenger window.
It was an interesting story, but the Cambridge professor refused to say what was fact and what was myth. No one knew what was true, and today’s version of the order wasn’t talking. They could be worshiping Satan or quietly living their lives and growing herb gardens.
Sherlock scoffed, then looked serious. “I don’t want her a part of this.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I know more about his music than his life. But ‘The Satanic Poem’ was about a Faustian bargain, not the occult.”
“Black’s compositions?” John thought back to what Simon had told them months before. About people listening to the songs John had posted on his blog, and that Dabic and Wendt had put out for downloading. That the songs wouldn’t need to be played specifically at the ceremony, because they were being played around the world by unsuspecting listeners. “Why am I only hearing about this now?”
“Have you ever heard the term
A woman slid into the chair across from him. She had chin-length dirty blond hair, a cute upturned nose, and a sardonic smile that reminded him of Sherlock. The only physical feature they shared, though, were light, color-changing eyes. “John Watson,” she said. “Eurus Holmes.” She stuck out a hand, which he shook.
“You want to know more about my job and how it differs from all those charlatans out there, right?”
“Games with my sister.”
Well, there wasn’t much he could do now. He needed to get ready. He’d worry about fixing things with Sherlock later.
and wanted to see you. She worries.”
Sorry, Mike, readers. Instead of weekly special interest stories, for the foreseeable future you’ll have to read about my deep dive into paranormal investigation and the enigmatic debunker leading the charge to solve them.
“What did you do while I was out?”
“Hmm.”
Sherlock muttered and darted around the cave, snapping pictures from different angles. Simon left him to his studies and joined John at the entrance to the cave.
Before the conversation could progress further, Eurus entered the sitting room carrying a sheaf of papers. “In what order do these need to be substituted, Sher?”
“That was one time.”
“Why?”
“Eurus. She said your mother was involved somehow in your and her ability to see the tall men.”
“What?” Sherlock’s eyes were wide with disbelief. “How is nattering on about my private life helpful?”
The pieces clicked in place. “He read maths. And used it to create the music?” John surmised. “But what is the doorway for?”
Still, when he’s at the end of his tether, he has no other thought than seeking out his best friend. He’s held off for far too long, not wanting to be weak, not wanting to burden Sherlock. Sherlock didn’t sign up to be a parent, John had. Well. Sort of.
John couldn’t see much beyond some smudges, mostly dark, but he remembered what the pictures of the caves at Bath looked like and could imagine. The same army worshipping or listening to a taller figure. The symbols that signified early writing.
“Lily!” She smiled and listened. “Yeah, in London for a bit, until Sher gets tired of me, at least.” She winked at her brother.
“My wedding?”
“And I’ll outwit them. Genius, remember? I think I can handle a few delusional conspiracy theorists.”
“So you’re one hundred percent certain Victor isn’t the beginning?”
was going to dig up your past. This way, I’ve got yours and Mycroft’s words telling the real story, rather than letting someone find it and make up their own account about it. I
There was a hint of challenge in the tilt of Sherlock’s jaw. “You’re a journalist. Aren’t you supposed to research everything you write about? Can you say you’ve fully investigated this case without listening to the Unsound?”
“Not now. I have more important things in my life to worry about. He texts and emails from time to time when he needs information I might know. I know he’s doing okay.” She looked sad but resigned, fine lines pulling at her forehead and mouth, but her eyes stayed soft. “I’ll happily welcome him with open arms if he ever wants that, but I won’t push.”
. Thankfully, Sherlock had brought a book with himself. He can drown himself in the wonders of fantasy while the others enjoyed the game.
Mike Stamford used to go to a muggle school, called Barts, before in Smithfield, London. He was a friendly kid. He was either someone’s friend or was in good terms with them. His smile made the room vibrant, and everyone liked his presence.
John was elated to be matched with Sherlock. He quickly searched and found where Sherlock was sitting. He flew to him, as fast as he could. Sherlock looked at him with fear in his eyes. John did what he wanted to do since he saw himself in the Mirror of Erised with Sherlock. He gently cupped Sherlock’s face and kissed him. He reveled in Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath, but then panicked. What if Sherlock didn’t want this? John pulled back to find Sherlock with his eyes closed.
“What is the usual then?”
Sherlock and John always sneaked out and had their after-curfew adventures. Most of the time Sherlock got detention, and John was let free. John hated it. He didn’t like how everyone talked about Sherlock like he was a freak, and the teachers always waited for an opportunity to give Sherlock detention. And John was always let free because he was a chaser for Gryffindor. He hated it. Sherlock did tell John that all his detentions were spent with Professor Flitwick, and that he used the time to develop his research and record in his journal Science of Deduction. So, whenever Sherlock had detention, John snuck out and joined him in Professor Flitwick’s classroom.
Mike was on good terms with John with the help of postal service. Sure, they could use the internet to chat, but there was a sense of closeness in writing a letter. So, Mike was confident that even if he had to keep the wizarding world under hushes, he would be able to sustain all his friendships. And a new world was waiting for him.
Then he saw the image in the mirror change and Sherlock walk from behind. “Sherlock! I think the mirror works only when you are alone. I won Quidditch and my mom, dad, and Harry are here. Isn’t that grea-” John talked as he turned to Sherlock, but only found him not to be there. John turned back to the mirror to find Sherlock and himself looking at each other, with fond smiles. John watched his mirror-self hold Sherlock’s face in his palms and lean into kiss Sherlock right on his lips, as Sherlock melted at the contact.
“I am sorry, but what is the Mirror of Erised?” John asked, looking into the mirror.
Sherlock’s first year went as he expected. He was sorted into Ravenclaw, everyone ignored him due to his tendency to deduct them easily. Well everyone except three people.
Mike turned at that, stopping his conversation with the new first year students, abruptly. He couldn’t believe it. It was John, from Barts. Before he could stop himself, he breathed out the words “Bloody Hell!”, but the silence of the Great Hall due to McGonagall’s introduction, amplified his voice.
“Thanks for backing me up.” Eurus smile at him.
Sherlock smiled back. “I reckon that’s allowed.”
They looked at each other for longer than necessary, and the tension between them changed. These little moments confused John. He was never sure if Sherlock was just trying to get a read on him as a human being, or if there was a deeper interest involved. It
“In my closet.”
“World-famous clairvoyant, known for dealing with demons. A charlatan.”
The flat was chilly—John had found Sherlock standing in front of an open window, staring blankly out, no memory of getting out of bed nor how long he’d been there—and so they were on the sofa huddled under a blanket for warmth. Before John could extricate himself from both Sherlock’s limbs and the quilt, the sitting room door opened, revealing Eurus, holding two bags.
With a head shake that almost seemed sad, Sherlock huffed. “If only. It’s more complicated than that, John.”
Not only was he behind in posts, but he needed to work on creating a backlog of them, just in case things got hectic, as he was assuming they would. The only word from Simon so far was “wait,” and Victor was MIA. Mycroft was working on something big elsewhere (John had needed to look up 'squamous' after Sherlock’s latest vague explanation; it didn’t help), and Eurus was in a flurry of short story writing, so it was just the two of them in the center of the storm. Sherlock had worked through his inbox in less than a week. He hadn’t stopped complaining about his boredom since. John was hoping he’d decide to blow up the kitchen, just to keep him distracted.
Just like the deductions made on John earlier, the speech pattern was quick and the guesses accurate. Sherlock Holmes may be the arsehole everyone said he was, but there was no denying his intelligence. John had never seen anyone pull disparate information together so quickly.
That brought a smile to his face, thinking again about a tiny Sherlock doing his pint-sized investigations on mysterious phenomena. “What else did you investigate when you were little?”
Sherlock scoffed and picked up a slice of sushi roll. “I wouldn't call any of that evidence.”
“Oh. You kept it separate because it was special? Like that first pound note every restaurant tacks to their wall by the till?”
“And, of course, there’s
John was surprised when Sherlock stopped a few inches behind him and said nothing. He was about to open his own mouth to query when Sherlock finally spoke.
“Is there a certain type of supernatural phenomenon that’s harder to disprove?”
He continued tidying for a while but came to sit in the same chair as he had last time when Mrs. Hudson brought in the tea. John took the chair opposite—it was a nice, comfortable chair that seemed to mold to his frame perfectly. The three chatted until the time for the interview approached, then Mrs. Hudson left, saying she’d “leave you boys to your work.”
“–too much time,” Sherlock finished for him with a tight smile. “Yes, of course.”
John’s gaze swung to Sherlock. “Violin? What?”
He chanced a glance at his friend, then did a double take. Sherlock was stock still, face frozen except for his blinking eyes. “Sherlock?” he asked tentatively. Sherlock didn’t move or speak. “Ummm, you okay in there?” Nothing. He waited a minute. “That’s getting a bit scary now.”
Holmes studied it closely, turning it over in his hands as he spoke. “An expensive mobile. Not yours, going by the engraving on the back, so given to you by someone. Harry
“Yeah, I think so.” The words are soft, but loud enough to be heard in their cocoon for two. His nose brushes warm skin.
“All of these years saying nothing, and now he randomly decides to confess and attack another person?”
? This is Glushka?”
Details of the case and a few bits of dialogue in this chapter come from episode
“Then why are you here?” John asked, annoyed.
When they reached his room, a placid young man was sitting quietly on the bed, like he was waiting for something. He looked normal enough—no frantically darting eyes or evil smile. Still, something about him made John feel on edge. He attributed it to the stories Trent had told.
“The writing is gone,” Sherlock pointed out. “Your doing?” He stared accusingly at Fred.
Thalassic – relating to the sea
Trent grimaced. “Will it make Simon stop?
“Did I say I didn’t want you here?”
They might need to talk about their relationship soon, but John was content to wait a while. He’d stated his own intentions, and Sherlock had shown he was at least amenable to some of John’s wishes. That was enough for the moment.
“Do you really think you used pure logic to debunk all of your cases? That you were never led to the right place, the right idea, because of a feeling? A random thought that just popped in your head? How about the way you read people like books?”
he be so calm? He was talking about the murder of innocent children. Before John could expand on that, Sherlock leaned toward Simon.
Sherlock’s brow furrows a moment, but slowly, John’s meaning dawns. Before he speaks, the frown returns to his face. He doesn’t just look frustrated, though, he looks vulnerable. “Then why won’t you stay for good?”
John continued to scan the email he’d received from the Cologne police. He wasn’t sure how Sherlock had managed to wheedle them into sharing their findings with him, but John wasn’t going to complain. “Yeah, it’s just initial testing, but it doesn’t seem to match the blood from her body. And– Oh.”
Apparently, a monk called Herman did something bad enough that the rest of the monks in his monastery wanted to wall him up alive. He, a talented artist, talked them into giving him a year to create the most beautiful bible ever. Because a normal bible took around twenty years to make at that time, he supposedly made a deal with the devil to help him create it in a year. It ended up not being the actual bible, but rather just several books from the Latin bible and some historical texts, and it was called the Codex Gigas. Because of its great beauty, he was allowed to live. When the order was in financial trouble a few years later, the bible was sold, and Herman fell ill and died soon after.
“Hey!”
“Mother’s funeral.” She rolled her eyes when John widened his in surprise. “Of course he didn’t tell you. Yes, both of our parents are dead. Dad a decade back, Mother three years ago. I reckon you didn’t know that Sherlock took after Mother then, either. She studied the occult, though she did it from a tenured archeology position at a university, rather than as an independent consultant. We didn’t see her much as children.”
Wolfgang turned his phone to face the door, which he pushed open. It was dark inside apart from what light came through a window. The place looked worse than their flat before John had moved in. Furniture was overturned, and paper littered the room.
“If you think it’s possible, Sherlock, you’ll do it,” he reassured him.
“Keith Dabic, he’s the guitarist for a metal band out of Glasgow called Hastur Rising. Heard of it?” John shook his head. “Not surprising. Their music is terrible. Anyway. Dabic contacted me after the band’s lead singer, Jeff Wendt, committed suicide by hammering a knife into his chest with a polo mallet.”
“His message, it boils down to ‘I’m alive, don’t look for me.’”
Should he mention in actual words that they’d slept in the same bed? Should he ask
That’s all for this week. I’ll be back soon with another tale. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
“Some days. Others it’s wading through old newspapers or talking to batshit conspiracy theorists or sneezing your way through fifteen boxes of useless tchotchkes from 1967.”
Sherlock frowned. “I stand by that. They’re all just shadows, tricks of the light.”
“God, that’s young. Didn’t you miss having that sense of magic?”
Iraq.’ Like he was guessing, based on something he’d observed rather than read about.
“I prefer to text,” was the laconic reply. He narrowed his eyes at the visitor. “Another death. Something’s different.”
“I don’t think I can ever leave you either,” said Sherlock, referencing John’s own words from a few nights before. “I think I’d die without you.”
John pulled his gaze from a human skull residing on the mantlepiece. “What?”
John snorted, but nixed the grin when Sherlock shot him a look simultaneously confused and quelling.
“It means nothing to me,” Sherlock said with a shrug after John had played it.
“What?” Holmes asked sharply.
The video ended.
“I didn’t want give you another thing to worry about. I wasn’t sure it would work. I’m still not quite done with it. It might not work.” Sherlock bit his lip and fidgeted with the sleeves of his dressing gown. John hadn’t seen him so insecure since … well, since they’d become a couple, or whatever it was they were.
Sherlock dismissed it after only a few minutes of explanation. He complained that his new popularity from John’s blog was causing people to make up circumstances that matched stories John had already told. It had caused a row that ended in a three-day silence between the two of them.
“Is there a commonality between them all?”
“Was she the reason you claimed to see the men?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Get on with the story. You said
“At least I
. It’s
“You still want to do this, yeah?” John stood and walked over to sit on the coffee table. He put a hand on Sherlock’s head. “Whatever you want to do, I’m with you.”
“Idiots,” Sherlock murmured.
John paused with his toast halfway to his mouth and wracked his brain. He didn’t remember any nightmares, though he could guess what dream it was based on Sherlock’s description. It was a frequent visitor. He’d awakened three times recently to find himself out of bed, so that part wasn’t a surprise either.
“I was there when it happened. That’s me behind the camera.” The words were stilted, like he was working against a great force just to get them out.
“Yeah. It didn't take him long to figure out that we were experiencing what he called um, what was that again?”
Chthonic – concerning, belonging to, or inhabiting the underworld (pronounced thohn-ick)
“And if it was the attack alone, I might agree with you.”
to see something, to make sense out of a few odd things, that’s more believable.
She gave him that same damned puppy dog look Sherlock gave when he wanted John to do something. He hated that expression.
Sherlock put their doorbell in the freezer on Halloween. The rising popularity of the holiday in the UK meant they actually got a few trick-or-treaters, and none of the inhabitants of flat 221B wanted to hear that racket the day before reckoning.
It’s Sherlock’s turn to nod.
His voice was small, his eyes red, his lips white. John’s heart broke.
“It’s bigger and probably has nicer sheets too. You seem like the type to have ridiculously posh sheets,” John teased, both letting Sherlock know he was okay with it and defusing the situation a little.
“But I’m definitely the prettier, more likeable one, right?”
Sherlock opened his mouth, then closed it again. Looked away, then back. He nodded. “And you’re not just saying this to get me to agree to work with Simon.”
She ignored them, except to eye their intertwined position. “The room upstairs is free now, right? I’ll go unpack. Some tea would be lovely.” She stood and headed for the stairs, grabbing her bags along the way. “Some sort of black tea with milk and sugar, if you please.”
John arrived at Baker Street half an hour before the meeting was scheduled to begin. Mrs. Hudson let him in, offering tea and biscuits as they made their way up the stairs.
Simon raised his eyebrows. “Aren’t you the least bit curious who is behind it all?”
Sherlock snorted.
“Fred Barnes just called. They couldn’t find Simon at curfew last night, and he hasn’t turned up yet.”
“Where are you going?” John called out, following behind. He saw Sherlock putting on his coat and gloves.
His flatmate sighed but came to stand behind John. He was silent for a while, then hummed. “I would say a ritual of some sort, but the rows of figures at this end are lined up in a militaristic manner, so perhaps a battle? Where are the pictures from?”
One spring day, John received a call from a psychiatric hospital in Sheffield. Calls and emails from fans or conspiracy theorists weren’t uncommon. People got excited reading his stories and wanted to have their fifteen minutes of fame. There were also the people who heard about Sherlock’s reward and wanted to have a go at stumping the arsehole genius. Seventy-five percent of the time, Sherlock scoffed, gave a twenty-word explanation to John, and refused to even talk with the person who had contacted them. But the other quarter (a seven or higher on the Sherlock Scale of Interesting Things) were worth leaving the flat for. That was the case with the latest voicemail.
“If you believe Simon.”
Sherlock turned his head quickly, as if surprised to find John still there. He tempered his grin. “Have you seen the news stories about the victims supposedly being frightened to death in haunted houses all across the city?”
famous.” He hit play again.
With a grin, he went back to preparing tea, then set everything down on the table.
Sherlock plays until long past when Rosie finally drifts off. John cooks supper to some classical piece he’s always loved but never asked the name of. They eat dinner, then settle in for a quiet evening. It’s very … domestic. It’s been so long since John has spent a relaxing evening with another adult that it almost feels wrong. If he does happen to be away from home of an evening, it’s usually mired in a case or running errands. But this is just a normal evening, the kind couples have. It’s too close to what John wants these days. He’d chafed at having this before, had been an utter prick by trying to run away from it by having the beginnings of an affair, so he’s not sure what to think. Does he want this just because it’s different from the draining pattern his life currently contains, or is it that it’s Sherlock? Did his being married to a secret assassin who almost killed the person he actually cares for most play a part?
Sherlock scowled. “Do you want me to tell you about this case or not?”
“Same reason you receive dozens of other videos. People want answers, or to win money or fame. Whatever it is, they want something.”
“Isn’t it the dead person who does the haunting?”
“Yes. Thank you.” John forwarded the email to Sherlock then stood to head up to his room.
“Hmm, then yes, I’d say a ritual. What’s this for?”
“Needlessly dramatic is what it is.” Sherlock said. He came to stand close to John. Their jackets brushed.
“Well …”
Knowing when to concede defeat—he’d had months of arguments with Sherlock for practice—John began to tell her the story, from the day he met Sherlock until the meeting with Victor earlier that day. Eurus stayed quiet for the most part, only asking a few questions for clarification. After he finished, she tilted her head contemplatively and stared off into space for a while. Recognizing it from Sherlock’s own stretches of silent thought, John let her be, taking the time to visit the gents’ and order more tea while he waited. When he returned to the table, she was typing furiously on an extra slim, streamlined laptop, frown of concentration firmly on her face.
“No sense of humor,” Simon tsked with a teasing smile. Then he sighed and shrugged. “Oh well. The Order of the Cenophus wants you, you want to know why. And you want to know the connections to the Unsound and the shadow men. I have the answers.”
“You’ve been having them too?” Simon asked, coming up behind them.
Sherlock did raise a good point. John had gone into active battle zones just to ensure his information was accurate, so why should he shy away from a sound that urban myth
“Don’t what?” What was Sherlock getting at?
“No wonder he’s in an insane asylum.”
It was late. Or early. After the first week of insomnia, John had stopped looking at the time when he woke up. Instead, for the past few nights, he’d get out of bed—no use staying, he never got back to sleep after a nightmare—head downstairs, make a pot of chamomile, and wait for Sherlock to join him. Sometimes Sherlock was already in the lounge, tea prepared and at a perfect temperature. Some nights they’d watch mindless telly, others—the ones where Sherlock’s dreams seemed to be the worst—his flatmate would play the violin; quiet, mournful, helpless songs that made John want to cry.
what we do. I love that I’m a part of it. The last eight months have been … the best I’ve experienced in a long time. And that’s down to you. I just meant …” He scrunched his face and tried to parse his words. “I think this whole thing—the Order, sacred geometry, the Unsound—are worth us looking into. If we—if
Even now, part of me hopes it’s all a grand hoax perpetrated to get back at the berk who goes around ruining everyone’s fun by disproving paranormal events. Because if it is a hoax, then I can be sure that not only will Sherlock live to see 8
Sherlock shuddered a breath out, long and deep. “I … went along with it. Said I’d film her. Make it an investigation. It was fun at the time.” His eyes went hazy and unfocused, as if whatever he was looking at wasn’t in the room. “It’s odd. I believed her. I’d already proven our parents did the Father Christmas thing, and I’d seen no other sign of the paranormal, but she was my sister, my best friend, and she really seemed to believe it herself, so I did too.”
“Hmmm.” Her face did the scrunchy thing Sherlock’s did when he wasn’t satisfied with an answer, but she didn’t push. She waited a moment, then continued when John was silent. “So. Update me.”
“You’re
Sherlock cracked a small smile. “Indeed.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but thankfully kept his thoughts (probably that
They were at some Chinese restaurant enjoying a post-case meal. It was the best food John had eaten since returning to London. He wasn’t sure if the food was that good—though according to Sherlock it was the best Chinese in Central London (according to the bottom third of the door handle)—or if it was the events leading up to it that made it taste so good. He hadn’t felt this alive since he’d been shot. And, if he was being honest, for several years before that. He’d grown jaded with his old work. It was important, and he’d been happy to do it because the truth needed to get to the public, but his heart hadn’t been in it for a while. But this was new. Different. Fun. Fascinating. Much like the man sitting across from him.
Sherlock let out a long breath and tightened his hand on John’s neck briefly. “I … me, the same.”
When life got too strange, too impossible, too frightening, there was always one last hope; The Baker Street Husbands.
Sherlock and John dated their whole life and graduated from Hogwarts as each other’s fiancés. John’s dad was happy that John had found love in a friend, like him and John’s mom. Sherlock’s parents were shocked, to say the least, as Sherlock had always been determined to not show feelings nor have friends. But not only did he find friends, he found love.
“And lastly, we have a new second year student, John Watson.”
“How are you mate? Where were for the past year? And how didn’t our dads know each other? Being a wizard and all.”
“Ah, good you are here! I am sorry Sherlock but this detention, you will be spending it watching the Summer Quidditch Tournament.” Flitwick went on, ignoring Sherlock’s incredulous ‘What’. “My presence is required for the match, and because detentions shouldn’t be led unsupervised, you will be going to the match. I will have Mike or Molly report to me if you came to the match or not, so don’t try to outsmart me by holing in your bed. For the first time Sherlock, you are going to have a real detention. One that you actually hate and punishes you. Now you are dismissed.” Flitwick said leaving the room, smiling devilishly, as he was thinking about his plans.
Overall, for Sherlock, first year was just a disappointment of easy and boring subjects. He didn’t understand why others were excited for second year, and especially Quidditch. All the teachers and students hated him for being a know-it-all and taunted him when they were bored. But Sherlock didn’t mind. He had gotten many detentions, and single-handedly helped in losing points for Ravenclaw, making his housemates despise him too, but Sherlock didn’t care. He was a high functioning sociopath, after all.
Sherlock knew all his life that he was going to Hogwarts and would be placed in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin. The Holmes’ bloodline was always sort into either Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Sherlock had a hard time making friends due to his ability to deduct everyone in one look, and also his lack of sense to not understand what could be said, and what shouldn’t be shared.
John knew Sherlock didn’t like Quidditch, but he wished Sherlock did. He wished there was someone out there on the bleachers who he could show off to. It was a recent thought, to be honest. His teammates were always looking at the girls and guys out there, and doing a flip or something, making the crowd go crazy. There are breaks during the practice, when they do tricks to flirt with the crowd, and every single time, the crowd turns to John with expectant eyes, hoping John does something and winks at one of them.
“Mike!” John exclaimed, enveloping Mike in a bear hug. The two patted each other’s back before pulling back.
John turned to the source of the sound, to find himself staring at Mike Stamford. Mike waved at him, excitement radiating from him, and John couldn’t help but smile widely at him. What were the odds that his former best friend was also a wizard!
John had heard about the kiss cam and thought it was nice the wizarding world was including some muggle traditions. He thought the kiss cam would not fall on him as he would be playing, but he was wrong. The game began and John now solely focused on the game, while Sherlock read his book.
Both Sherlock and John were surprised when Professor Flitwick let John into the classroom, telling him he didn’t have to sneak in anymore during Sherlock’s detention. They didn’t question the gift horse in the mouth and continued enjoying each other’s presence. Sherlock went on with his research, talking to John non-stop, while John admired whatever Sherlock did. After the first two times, John understood that Sherlock had a habit of talking while doing his research, not caring whether the other person responded. Once, John drew a face on a balloon and tied it to a chair when he had Quidditch practice. He came back to see Sherlock talking, not knowing that John had left the room. John found it endearing.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
The Sorting Hat talked to him, making John startle, telling him how he was fit for both Hufflepuff and Gryffindor, which John knew due to his sources (ok, it was the library books), but was ultimately sorted into Gryffindor. He went and sat with the table that was littered in red and had his dinner. He knew after dinner, he was going to go and talk with Mike, make up for all the lost time.
“The Mirror of Erised is a magical mirror, which is supposed to show the ‘deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.’ The name ‘Erised’ id ‘desire’ spelled backwards, as if it is being reflected in a mirror. The writing engraved on the frame of the mirror is supposedly in a foreign and probably dead language. ‘
First, he was oblivious to this matter, as Sherlock was the only on in his mind. But then his teammates told him about what a hot commodity he was in Hogwarts, and how many students wanted to be his centre of attention. It was then he felt like a dam opened. Once he was informed, he couldn’t stop but feel like everyone was staring at him, waiting for something. Waiting for him to do something. He wished Sherlock was here with him. With him nearby, John’s attention was always on him.
John wasn’t paying attention as he was playing. He did hear the crowd gasp first but the Quaffle was with him and he had to score. As he scored, the second gasp came, and John turned to go back to his position when he saw Sherlock’s face on the screen.
, Sherlock thought, shaking his head and focusing on his book. “Now let the game begin.”
John had gotten accepted to both Hogwarts and Ilvermony. He didn’t know that he was a wizard. A staff from each school had come to inform John and his Father what he was. After the initial shock, his Father talked with both the staffs stating that his job required him to shift around, and he wanted to be in the same area as John. John understood his father’s overprotectiveness.
Sherlock didn’t know what to do. He got up to leave the grounds but was suddenly assaulted by red and yellows.
His genius was both a gift and a curse. But Sherlock didn’t care. He didn’t need friends. He could go his whole life hearing people calling him freak, weird, and other similar terms, and he would not care. He programmed himself to not have feelings, thus enhancing his genius even more. He knew his parents worried for him, but Sherlock didn’t mind. He named himself as a high functioning sociopath.
to be kidding me.”
John shrugged. “I guess?”
She raised an eyebrow. “So, I was right then. You contacted me about that tape we made when we were kids?”
Trent frowned. “I hadn’t. Not before the attack. I’ve only been here a month, and we’re not in the same wing, so we don’t do any group activities together. I haven’t even seen him before. But …” He scrubbed his face. He looked troubled. “This girl came up to me one day and said, ‘Simon likes your drawings.’ But I
John put his hand on Sherlock’s arm to stop him. “God. No. Sherlock. Really. That came out all wrong. I
“He’s no use when he’s like this.”
Sherlock chuckled. “I won’t argue with you there.”
Sherlock Holmes is a striking man—tall with dark curly hair, pale skin and nice cheekbones—but it’s the way he holds himself that sets him apart. There’s a self-assuredness to his posture. I can see why people might call him arrogant, but I think they’re reading him wrong. His icy eyes can pin you in place with a glance, which he uses to deduce your whole history in seconds. It’s disarming, but extraordinary. However, he’s not arrogant. Or, well, he definitely is, but I think it’s deserved. The man knows what he’s doing. He’s highly intelligent, able to see patterns where we normal people see coincidence or nothing at all.
John steeled himself. “Actually no. Getting shot kind of puts you out of the game. At least when it leaves you with a limp and a hand tremor.” He gave a tight smile. “I’m back in London for good. Or, at least, until my finances dry up enough that I have to leave. London isn’t cheap.”
site, garnering the most comments and likes. He even started getting fan mail. Conspiracy theories abounded, and he tried to ignore them, fearing they’d influence how he saw the cases. He was already having trouble seeing things with as much skepticism as he had when he’d started. So many of the cases seemed to have no explanation, and given that they were the scarlet files, even Sherlock couldn’t disprove them.
John pinched the bridge of his nose. Was Sherlock being purposefully obtuse? “Look at the main figure, the taller one.”
In which John finds out what Sherlock has been doing in his room and about a third Holmes sibling.
He leaned back and let out a breath of relief. Crisis averted. He didn’t realize his hand was still resting on Sherlock’s forearm until he wiggled, trying to get comfortable in the terrible airline seat. John let go in surprise, his palm warm where it had lain against Sherlock’s arm.
“You–”
“Hmm.”
Holmes frowned. “It’s my job to question everything. If it weren’t for me, people would go on believing, for example, that the woods of Dartmoor are haunted by a large demonic hound, instead of just being the nearby inn owners trying to drum up more business.”
“Sherlock …” John paused, trying to organize his thoughts. He had a feeling that how he spoke now would decide their future. “If we do this, we can only do it together. If you really don’t want to do this, I’ll stay with you. I won’t work with Simon without you. I think we … we need each other, no matter what we choose to do.” It was always so easy to speak his feelings during these liminal moments, when lack of sleep left him powerless to keep up his walls and his face was half hidden by the dark. He just hoped the same could be said for Sherlock.
“Hmm?”
Robert paused. “You were supposed to help us.”
John slide his hands up to cup Sherlock’s face. “You are the best and wisest man I’ve ever known, and it’s been an honor being your friend and your …” He floundered. “In being with you. I’m glad we found each other.”
“It’s either that or James Bond.”
Sherlock was playing his violin when John opened the street door. Based on the musical choice, it sounded like the freak out had moved on to contemplation. That was good. They climbed the stairs and into 221B, Eurus hanging back by the door. John called to Sherlock as he walked up to him but got no reply, so he touched his shoulder.
“But if we don’t,” John continued, shooting Sherlock a stern look when he opened his mouth. “If something happens during the ceremony or, I dunno, the train malfunctions and we all die a fiery death before we even get to Bath, I just need you to know something.”
The silence of the cab ride home was finally broken by Sherlock’s intake of breath that always proceeded a lengthy explanation. “John, I … that is, I didn’t mean– I don’t take joy from other people’s pain and death. I just … I’m not … I’m. Sorry.” He finally moved his gaze from the window to John. “I’m glad I have you around. To remind me.”
Sherlock went on to explain many things that went over John’s very analog-trained brain, but he trusted that Sherlock knew what he was talking about. The most interesting facts were that humans shouldn’t be able to hear the sound but could anyway and that the patterns were regular enough to be mechanically produced, though Sherlock insisted it was organic in nature.
“Shared myths in different societies is not uncommon.”
“Maddie,” he breathed.
Sherlock rose and went to his violin, rosining the bow and laying out his sheet music. He began with the new section he was working on, one that was particularly unpleasant to hear.
For the past five years, Sherlock Holmes has offered a £1 million reward to anyone who can prove the existence of the supernatural. He’s been sent hundreds of cases over the years, and every time, he’s come back with proof of the mundane: greed, power, sometimes just a good old prank. But he’s debunked them all.
He took his leave soon after, citing fatigue, but when he returned to his flat, he didn’t go to bed. His mind raced, going over the events of the evening and the scarlet file case over and over. Unable to sleep, he ended up doing as much internet research as he could. He finally dropped off around dawn, after sending an email to Mike concerning the new angle the blog series was taking and asking for his advice on getting in touch with Torres.
“I wanted to show you some paintings, that’s all. And talk without CCTV nosing in.”
“There.” She paused and cocked her head, staring at one corner of the room. “Hello.”
John knew Sherlock wouldn’t be happy to discuss the sister he never mentioned, but his reaction seemed a little much, even for him. Eurus was right. He was insecure about her ability to make friends and not let her brain take over her every waking moment or something. John sympathized with his friend. He and Harry had a similar relationship.
Eurus raised an eyebrow. “Not shying away then? Good. Sherlock needs someone like that.”
“Are you confused or scared, John?” Sherlock teased with a small smile.
“Well,” Sherlock said, stopping his playing long enough to sip his tea and continue their conversation. “He was a little busy focusing on his own world-ending event.”

“That’s why you like me more than them,” he teased, trying to lighten the mood.
“You’re meddling in things you don’t understand.”
“No video evidence, I assume?” Sherlock asked, his face as blank as ever.
“And why us?” John asked, feeling a little left out.
The next few days proved uneventful, with no news on Maddie or the Hochmans, and no further emails or calls about freaky happenings around children. It gave John time to concentrate on the Unsound, which he was still researching while he waited for Keith Dabic to get in touch.
Professor Flitwick knew that there was some tension between his favorite two. John had Quidditch practice every day, and Sherlock was feeling lonely. John didn’t know, but the name calling that had stopped at surfaced again, and Sherlock was feeling down all the time. Flitwick also knew that Sherlock was trying to drown himself in research and not care about John. One thing that Flitwick knew was that this Summer Quidditch was a special one. And especially conducted by the muggle-borns of the senior year.
Mike Stamford, a Hufflepuff, talked with everyone. He was the happy-go-lucky kind of person, and Sherlock deduced he would end up as a Muggle Doctor, or a Magic Healer in the Wizarding World due to his caring nature. Sherlock didn’t want to have friends, but Mike was insistent to make Sherlock his friend, ultimately ending in good terms with Sherlock.
It was during half-time when Molly made Sherlock divert his attention from his book. “Sherlock it’s time for the kiss cam.”
Sherlock was stunned. He had to witness a stupid Quidditch match, a game he doesn’t like, nor does he keep up with, along with the whole school. It was the worse detention he ever had. He went back to check the Mirror of Erised again, alone.
John took the hand, without any thought, still shocked as to how the guy, Sherlock, knew all these things without even knowing him.
Following the first years, John was now standing in front a giant, who introduced himself to be Hagrid. They were then taken across a glassily still lake and through a curtain of ivy to a pebbly underground harbour. Then, above a mountain, was a castle, which was informed to be Hogwarts School of Witch and Wizardry. Walking to the Great Hall, John noticed the false ceiling above, displaying the night sky. He also saw a blue-scarfed boy (Ravenclaw, if he remembers) staring at him with a curious look but ignored it.
“A slap or water in the face, accompanied by the word ‘Freak’.”
“Is that why you were being a drama queen recently, idiot?” As Sherlock shrugged and nodded, John’s teammates were calling him back to play. “We are talking about this later.” John said and flew off, before Sherlock could reply, leaving him to be ambushed by questions from Mike and Molly.
“Now its time for the last pair.” The MC said, making the tension in stadium rise with anticipation. Everyone wanted to know which couple loved each other or had the strongest chemistry in the whole school. Sherlock didn’t care, he was going to go back to his book when he saw John’s face appear. Great, he had to witness John get matched to his love of the life. He tried to focus on something else, but Mike and Molly were making it hard to not.
In the midst of his own revelation, Sherlock missed to observe a crucial point. If the mirror didn’t have an effect on John, then was John’s deepest desire to be with Sherlock. If only he had the mental capacity to both freak out and deduce. Sherlock had later returned to his room, forgetting dinner, getting ready for the worst detention ever.
The tournament was the next day, the previous day was practice for John. He still couldn’t understand why Sherlock was being distant. He was distant with everyone but not John. How did Sherlock know the Mirror worked? Maybe the mirror worked only when there was one person. John wanted to know, so he made up his mind to go to mirror and find out.
John was selected to be Gryffindor Chaser for the Quidditch team, the second in most of his subjects (Sherlock being the first in everything), befriended by everyone, and friends with others, but those weren’t what John enjoyed about his second year. It was spending time with Sherlock. Sure, he spent time with Molly and Mike, but those two were in the same house, thus were closer with one another.
though he kept silent.
“Plus,” Sherlock rushed to continue, finally looking at John with big eyes, “I lost the rest of my team, they wouldn’t work with me. I need help with the Work. I can pay you. It should give you enough for your part of the rent plus expenses.”
big of a fan base.”
Sherlock ran his hands over his face and closed his eyes. “I don’t know. It doesn’t make sense. She was supposed to be a lone wolf, someone trying to spook a family for some strange reason, but one that was her own. But this? This proves she didn’t work alone. Which means something more sinister is going on. But
. I followed every lead, no matter how tenuous, but there was
“You’re my mate, my flatmate. You’re …” John looked away, not able to face Sherlock while he admitted some of his own feelings. His voice went quiet. “You’re my best friend. I like living and working with you. I mean, you have your problems, but so do I. This life we lead, as weird as it is, is worth it.
“Stuff and nonsense.”
shite place.” His brain started churning. Harry? No, not if he could avoid it. Mike? Maybe for a few days. Most of his work mates were covering wars around the globe, so they were out. He had some money saved, but it was already being used to cover his shit of a flat. Anything more would bleed him dry. He would get some insurance money, but it would mostly pay to replace his current possessions, few as they were.
He was out of his chair and following the paranormal investigator down the stairs before Sherlock had time to rescind the invitation.
For a moment, John’s spirits lifted, but then fell almost as quickly. “I can’t afford Central London.”
“Bonne chance, boys,” Eurus said, then started walking to their right.
There was a quiet sigh. “Look after him? Please?” This made John turn to face Sherlock’s older brother. He knew that look. That fierce protection, that worry. It was how he felt growing up with an out-of-control little sister, it was how he’d been feeling as he watched Sherlock spiral, as he watched conspiracy converge around his friend.
John ruminated on these things for a few days before deciding he should just ask his flatmate. He might not get the truth, but he wouldn’t know until he tried. He could always go to Mycroft if every other trail dead ended.
She rolled her eyes. “Mycroft.”
“Also, why’d you start off mentioning yesterday, and talking about watching me like a hawk for my Unsound death—which didn’t happen, you’ll note. You said the post was only going to be published if you died. You couldn’t watch me like a hawk if you were already dead.”
Sherlock leaned in until their foreheads touched and said, “against the rest of the world.”
Her face went serious. “How is he, really?”
John frowned. “What do you mean?”
“Same.”
Though a part of him wanted to believe something more sinister was going on, John’s practical side ceded to Sherlock’s argument. There would be more evidence in the world of ghosts or demons or whatever the tall man was if they existed. But as Sherlock said, because these were abnormal situations, the burden of proof was on the one stating it was real.
“A great many things, but as Hassocks has not come up in a case, I–”
“Believe me or not, but we can agree that some shadowy organization is after you for unsavory purposes. Wouldn’t it be better to try to stop them?”
The next morning over breakfast, John broke their tacit rule and mentioned their sleepless nights and nightmares. He wanted to tell Sherlock he’d had a nightmare, but didn’t want to put him on the spot, so he brought up his own.
“SHERLOCK!” John yelled. It gave Sherlock just enough time to tuck in to keep his violin from being broken or his breath knocked out of him, but he went down with his attacker.
“I got out of my workshop early today. How does a coffee sound?”
Or so he wants everyone to think.
“Your work?” Sherlock asked.
“Precisely,” Sherlock said with a nod.
“She constantly road her bike all over the city. The likelihood she would eventually have an accident was high. It had nothing to do with the Unsound.”
Sherlock’s face scrunched up. “A couple of people have said that they like your drawings, and you connected that to Simon being your attacker?”
John looked at his laptop screen, video frozen, once more before nodding. “Yeah, I could use a beer.”
“Any ideas what it means?”
“It would’ve been nice if we could’ve gone in, guns blazing with a whole army of secret service agents, though. Faster, at least. And I wouldn’t have broken my wrist.”
“Easier to show you, I think.” Sherlock twisted around to grab his laptop from the other side of the bed. Queuing up a video, he slid the computer onto John’s lap.
Usually Sherlock’s behavior would not be too abnormal, except for him hiding in his room. What was going on in there? Unable to figure it out, John concentrated on his current research. There was a connection between the paintings and the other cases they’d had recently. He just knew it. Now he had to prove it to Sherlock.
at him, John pivoted and quickly pulled his friend into a tight hug, tucking Sherlock’s head into his shoulder. Sherlock shuddered and put his arms around John’s waist.
Twenty minutes later found them back in Sherlock’s lounge, sitting with cups of tea and warming themselves by the fire. On Sherlock’s lap sat a single scarlet folder, looking less innocuous than a folder ought to. John started his recorder and nodded at the man sat across from him.
5 February 2010
Three weeks after John moved into Baker Street, he received a text from a private number:
It was quiet for about two minutes, both of them lying side by side. John didn’t even know if Sherlock knew he was awake. It wasn’t an awkward wait. In fact, John started drifting off while he waited for whatever else might happen. Then Sherlock slide closer until his forehead (maybe?) touched the side of John’s shoulder. He let out a sigh as his hands lightly clutched John’s arm.
“So, is this file and DVD a whole bunch of cases of shadowy figures on film?” John asked as the film went blank again.
“And are they still alive?”
“How many cases that you’ve investigated have come as a result of the challenge?”
“Did Sammy draw it?” asked Sherlock.
“Um. Yes. I mean, no.” Sherlock rubbed the back of his neck. “I didn’t need to. Others had already done so. There is plenty of time for people on the ground to remove the dummy before the camera zooms in. Obvious.”
John’s mate shrugged. “No answers to knocking, but the door is unlocked. I’m about to call the police, but figured I’d let you know before I got caught up in paperwork.”
? Really? Sherlock was not the nickname sort.
“Very good, John. Yes.” Sherlock started ticking things off with his fingers. “Simon is a very disturbed young man who basically grew up in this hospital and possibly killed his parents. Too much time on his hands, a need to bring order to his world, so he studies numerology and sacred geometry. He doesn’t like Trent, so he draws these symbols on the other boy’s wall. Trent becomes ‘infected’ and begins drawing the same things. The seizure is just a random happenstance, nothing to do with anything else.”
CW: mentions of patients at a psychiatric hospital, and Sherlock being a bit rude about said patients.
“We don’t know that for sure.”
was your brother doing this whole time?” John tried to pin Sherlock with a frown, but it slid off him.
“If this is a trap,” John said, once they’d settled into their seats, trying for the third time to convince Sherlock why this was a good idea, “isn’t it better for us to meet it head on? Better to know exactly who or what we’re up against, rather than letting them skulk the shadows, their motives unexplained?”
The second and third subjects proved to be equally ridiculous, but he was finally becoming intrigued. Not in the paranormal, but in a common subject among the three. All three investigators made offhand comments about one man: Sherlock Holmes.
When John finally fell back asleep, their hands were still stacked on top of Sherlock’s arm, and they were curled into each other, warm and safe.

“Do you have any ideas why Victor might have disappeared?”
“Can you show me?”
The message was from a healthcare manager who worked at Nether Edge Hospital who had seen something he thought would be right up Sherlock’s street. John called the man, a Fred Barnes, back, then took the details to Sherlock.
“The Chinese down the street.”
The room went still, but Sherlock didn’t say anything.
“It’s English. Just backwards in jumbled spaces. ‘I show not your face, but your heart’s desire’, like you said.” John observed, looking at the carving closely. Then he stepped back, looking at the mirror. “I don’t see anything different though.” He said, looking at him and Sherlock in the mirror.
Mike and Molly went on and on about their day, while Sherlock just sat there quiet. He would usually chip in some comments about their idiocy or something, but today he was out of it. He suddenly got up and walked out of the Great Hall. John got up too, running behind Sherlock to catch up to him.
John too was confused. But the Summer Quidditch Tournament was coming up and he was called for practice every evening. John enjoyed Quidditch, he really did. But it made him have less time to hangout with Sherlock. The only times he spent time with Sherlock were during recess and dinner.
Sherlock left his room to find both Mike and Molly waiting for him.
“I didn’t know, I saw.” Sherlock said, and before John could ask what he meant, Mike piped in.
Sherlock noticed one of the first years to not be… a first year. He also noticed that his skin pigmentation, which informed him that the boy was from the United States, but his facial features contradicted that, showing signs of European features, especially British features. Sherlock deduced that this boy had finished his first year in the United States, Ilvermony due to its fame, and had now transferred to Hogwarts for his second year. The manner in how he observed his surroundings were pointing out to Sherlock that he was not going to transfer again, rather stay here for the rest of his schooling year. And the way his eyes widened with surprise at the house ghosts made Sherlock believe that this boy was muggle-born. Before he could deduce more, Professor McGonagall’s voice boomed through the Great Hall.
John noticed how Sherlock wasn’t there for dinner, but he couldn’t go inside the Ravenclaw rooms. He went to the dungeons and found it empty. Well at least he can check whether the mirror worked or not. Walking towards the mirror, John found himself in the middle of the crowd. He was wearing his Quidditch outfit and holding the Quidditch cup. His mom, dad, and Harry were standing beside him, with proud smiles. He wished Sherlock was here, so he could tell him what he saw.
“Me too, I guess we can leave, before someone comes and puts me in detention again.” Sherlock said, getting John to chuckle, involuntarily he smiled fondly looking at John.
. As soon as John reached him, Sherlock started, answering unasked question, “It didn’t work when we both were together because we were each other’s desire. When I was alone, I saw you hug me from behind and kiss me on the neck, while you saw us kissing.”
But if you look closel-“
“Well are you ok with it? ‘Cause I am bloody damned elated mate.” John chuckled, his hands unconsciously wrapping around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock responded with a shy nod, which John accepted with a deep kiss to his lips.
And right next to Sherlock’s face was his.
“But there is a magical twist to it,” Flitwick said, getting everyone’s attention to him, “The people who come on the kiss cam are chosen to have the most chemistry or strongest love for each other. And the last pair on the kiss cam will be the one with the most love or chemistry. Your heart’s desire.” Flitwick ended. The crowd was oohing and aahing at what Professor Flitwick had just said.
“John! John Watson!” Mike yelled, moving through the crowd to get to John, dragging Sherlock and Molly with him.
“No, it’s not magic.” Sherlock scoffed, “It’s the Science of Deduction.”
Needless to say, John was excited.
Sherlock and John became the first ever consulting Auror in the wizarding world, and first ever consulting detective in the muggle world. They both helped in assisting the Aurors/detectives, finding culprits, and sending them to their respective jails. John took on to also become an author in both worlds, publishing their solved cases. Overall, life was great in 221B Baker Street.
“Right,” Fred nodded. “Only Trent’s went off, and it was only for about twenty seconds.”
Sherlock’s eyes darted around John’s face while his own stayed blank. “What do you mean?”
“What?”
“Don’t be boring, John.” Sherlock slid so he was slouched in his chair, head resting against the back, arms dangling off the sides. Definite signs he was about to throw a wobbly.
“I'm sorry.”
The only other interesting thing to come of the interviews was what he found in Wendt’s private recording studio in Glasgow. The audio file set up on his (oddly) still-running computer was a song he’d been working on, but the audio mixer showed that the same waves as the Unsound were buried under the music. Only recognizing the wave pattern because of Sherlock’s explanations, John copied it and took it back with him to Baker Street to have his genius flatmate analyze it. He found nothing more than the Unsound and the recorded music itself, but further research showed that Wendt had made the song available for downloading on torrent sites and millions of people had downloaded it.
