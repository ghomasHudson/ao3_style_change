So, the other, louder part of Cas said he needed to do the same. Asmodeus was a master of disguise so it was likely that Sam and Dean wouldn’t even notice he was missing. He wanted to believe that Dean could see through the façade, but he couldn’t bet on it. And if he was honest, he wasn’t sure if he wanted Dean’s help. It wasn’t Dean’s job to rescue everyone.
“Dean, I know you … don’t approve of the methods I used but –”
Cas looked at him through narrowed eyes, but when it became clear that Dean wasn’t going to pick a fight he relaxed. “We need to be prepared,” he said, echoing what he had said earlier.
As he stood and waited, looking up at the moon, another thing the Empty had said came echoing back through his memory:
The day after Sam and Dean got back from helping Donna, Sam didn’t feel like getting up. He’d spent the night staring at the ceiling, slipping in and out of restless dreams. Dreams of people they’d known. People they’d saved. People they hadn’t.
“Cas, you sure you’re ok?” Dean asked.
“Listen, Cas … I don’t know, Sam pointed out that I don’t always say what I mean to say with you. And for that I’m sorry,” Dean ran a hand over his close-cropped hair, “You know me … I’m not always good with this kind of thing, but I need to – you were gone,” he closed his eyes and sighed sharply, “And it was like … nothing mattered anymore. I couldn’t try to bring you back because I didn’t … believe in anything anymore. I couldn’t care, I couldn’t – do anything.” He clenched his jaw, the feelings of despair and loss seeping back in.
“I did mean
“And if you find her again?” Castiel asked, hoping that maybe, looking back on this conversation, Dean would understand why he’d done what he was about to do.
“It’s ok, Mom,” Sam said, almost instinctually, “we get it.” And he did. He had always been the one in the family to take the brunt of the emotional baggage. He hadn’t really expected that to change when Mary arrived.
Sam cleared his throat and sat up a bit taller, as if he were preparing himself for some kind of attack. “Ok, yeah. Actually we were … we were thinking of asking you about it, if Dean’s talked to you or if you’ve noticed –”
Castiel: Some people just can’t be saved.
“Dean, it’s fine.”
Cas looked at him curiously, then nodded, “Of course, Dean.”
“Sam, I really don’t know how to explain it in English,” Cas said, looking tired.
“Why do you ask?” Cas said, his eyes narrowing.
“Sam, you don’t know what you’re saying,” Dean said tiredly, “that’s –”
But Dean re-entered the room at that moment, balancing three large bowls of popcorn in his arms.
“What?!?!” Dean exclaimed, letting out a harsh laugh. “Cas? NO. Mom, what the hell? Why would you say that?” Mary shrugged her shoulders, ready to let the matter drop, but Dean pushed. “Why would you say that? What could possibly make you think that?” He was trying to laugh it away, but the extra wall of defenses was definitely there.
, but I’m pretty sure he’s bisexual.”
“That’s an understatement.” Castiel said gruffly, “the … cosmic entity I annoyed, he said nothing has ever woken him up before. If Jack can do that … We have no idea what his potential is.” He stood with his hands in his pockets, brow furrowed, and Dean couldn’t help but feel like he was concerned.
Cas: “thank you”
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean said, staring out at the road. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. “It’s just – I don’t know, it felt really vague. What exactly is he doing?”
“That’s another thing,” Sam interrupted. Some part of him knew that he shouldn’t have cut Dean off, that this was one time when Dean was choosing to be vulnerable, but he didn’t care.  He didn’t care what he’d said to Dean before, or what Dean had realized. He was tired. “You, me, Cas – we always seem to find a way back. Whether it’s demon deals, angel plans, God or just plain luck – we’re all still standing. But then we lose someone else and … nothing. Y’know, I guess we just don’t care enough, or don’t think they’re worth it.”
“Cas,” Dean said, and Castiel stopped “You can’t… With everything that’s going on, you can’t just go dark like that. We didn’t know what happened to you,” although Dean still refused to look at him, Castiel could tell that his tone was softer, more earnest than before. He was angry, but it was because he cared. He cared too much, sometimes. It would be so much easier to take care of him if he didn’t. “We were worried. That’s not okay.”
“Right, and if he doesn’t find something?” Castiel asked, and Dean didn’t like the turn the conversation was taking, “If you run out of time; could
Dean seemed taken aback, and he laughed awkwardly, then took a sip of his coffee, stalling. After a moment he nodded, “There was one,” he admitted, “I’ve gotta be honest mom, I’m not really a relationship person. I mean, you know the job, it doesn’t really allow for one. But there was this girl, Lisa.”
“No, I’m sorry,” Dean continued, “You should never have to look at that bitch again, let alone talk to her … try to work with her. After what she did to you –”
, he’d said, breaking eye contact. That wasn’t a phrase Dean had heard much in his life. He could count on one hand the times he remembered someone saying it to him. And although Cas had been speaking to all three of them – him, Sam, and their mom – Dean couldn’t shake the feeling that it had meant something … more.
“Dean,” Cas sighed, rolling his eyes, “I acted different because Jack gave me something I haven’t had in a long time. He gave me hope, something to believe in.”
But Castiel could tell from the way Dean’s jaw tightened that he didn’t accept that as an apology. “I…” he started, but what was he even going to say? “Dean, I just keep failing. Again, and again. When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn’t find you. And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn’t find her. And I just wanted –” No, wanted wasn’t the right word. The pain he’d felt, at having failed Sam and Dean over and over … he didn’t just
alright. Sometimes he was just as frustrating to talk to as Dean. “I know …” Sam started, coming further into the room, “I know this isn’t the first close call you’ve had,” they had all had way more than any one person should, “but I know that, even if you’ve been there before, its … never much fun.” Sam knew from experience that even when you’d literally faced down God’s sister, a gunshot to the wrong place could still be more terrifying. Death wasn’t picky and escaping it once didn’t mean you could escape it forever.
Sam looked at Mary, his eyebrow raised, “You asked him about Cas, didn’t you?”
There was a part of Cas that said, “Sam and Dean will come for you.” Like he’d come for them, searched for them endlessly, when they were taken prisoner the year before. But they hadn’t needed to be rescued. They hadn’t waited for anyone to come in and break them out, they had made their own plan and escaped, and Cas had ended up being little more than a ride home. Granted, he had saved them from the horrible consequences of the stupid deal they’d made to escape, but that was beside the point. Sam and Dean had found their own way out of prison.
“What?” Cas asked.
Dreaming … such an odd sensation. He remembered it from when he’d been human. However, he knew that what had happened to him was no dream. He had died, stabbed by Lucifer. That had really happened. But somehow, against all odds, he was back on earth.
Sam looked up as Dean came into the room, grabbing something from the fridge. When Dean turned around Castiel had entered the small kitchen, and he looked like he had something to say. Dean took one look at him, then pushed past him to the table without a word. Castiel kept staring at him but Dean refused to look back. Sam glanced between the two of them, preparing himself for an argument, but they didn’t break the tension. Instead, Cas set his jaw stubbornly and left without a word.
“Sam’s working on it,” Dean said, making eye contact with as much deliberation as he had used avoiding it this whole time, “Of course, he’s hellbent on finding something that doesn’t mean killing her or her kid.”
you ok?” he asked softly, a drastic change in tone from a moment earlier.
Dean: You were. Okay, Jack brought you back because we needed you back.
thing he could do right now, was use his connection to heaven to save the Winchesters from this mess they’d gotten into. But Dean didn’t see that. He always grew cold when Castiel disappointed him, but once Dean had moved on, he acted as though nothing had happened. As though his forgiveness should have been all Castiel needed to keep moving forward.
deep down.”
“Great,” Dean said, and he couldn’t help but feel …
SAM: Yeah.
ok?” unbelievable. This idiot had almost died today, and he asked if
Sam chuckled, “yeah, sure man. Don’t worry about it. I won’t tell my brother you have a crush on him.”
“Uh yeah, I guess,” Dean responded, gesturing for Cas to follow him into the room and taking a seat. He got the feeling Cas wanted to have some sort of … discussion, though he had no clue what it was about, “I wasn’t sure but, I’m starting to think Sam was right. Kid’s got potential.”

“You’ve been thinking about this for a long time, haven’t you?” Mary asked, a smile pulling at her lips. So far, her conversations with Sam had been stilted and short. They both had so much they wanted to ask each other but no idea how to start. But right now, Sam seemed comfortable, even eager, to talk. As if he’d been waiting for someone to share this with for a while.
he laughed derisively and shook his head. “If he wanted to help us maybe he could’ve, I don’t know,
Yeah.
Castiel: Right. And how have I repaid him? … maybe I was brought back to help prepare.
12x19 The Future
Mary smiled, “Lisa, huh? That’s a pretty name.”
“Great,” Dean said, and for a moment Cas almost wanted to stop him. To confess. But he didn’t. “I’d like a beer,” Dean said, hastily pushing past him and leaving Castiel alone in his room.
Dean glanced at the food suspiciously, but when he saw that it was just chicken and potatoes, not some experimental veggie dish, he grabbed a plate for himself and sat across from Sam.
Sam seemed to still have doubts. Dean admitted, only to himself, that there was a possibility that someone was tricking them, luring them into some kind of trap by pretending to be Castiel. It was too good to be true, and he knew better than to trust things like this. But he had to. Because without Cas … well …
“Sam.”
CASTIEL: No, Jack.
“Okay!” Mary conceded. After a moment she added, “but you know it would be ok if you were, right?” just in case.
He’d texted Eileen once he’d gotten his phone back. He hadn’t told her everything that had happened, not yet, but they’d been texting back and forth, about nothing, about everything. It was nice; talking to someone who understood the life, but without all the baggage he shared with Dean and Cas. Not that Eileen didn’t have her own baggage – you couldn’t be a hunter without it – but it was different. She didn’t see him as the boy with the demon blood, or the person who always needed saving from this year’s latest apocalypse. She didn’t know all his past traumas and mistakes. To her he was just … Sam.
Castiel’s eyes were narrowed, almost accusatory, “I guess I just expected … I mean, we fight for each other, right? You always …” he cut off, confusion flickering across his face, “but you burned my body? You … what, you didn’t want me to come back?”
Dean: Prepare for what?
“Have they …” Mary began hesitantly, “talked?”
“Besides,” Sam continued, “Cas loves it when you pick.”
“It sure has,” Castiel agreed, pulling up a chair at the table near Dean, “are you ok?”
Post 12x10 Lily Sunder has some regrets
Dean chuckled, looking confused but pleased, “Alright then, lets get it started,” he said, and pressed play. Sam fought to hide a grin as he noticed Dean stretch his arms, and slowly lower them so that one rested on the back of the couch, directly behind Cas’s shoulders.
“Yeah,” Dean said, noting a hint of … hurt in Castiel’s voice. He didn’t know what else to say.
Sam: “and that takes real strength”
“Cas,” Dean said, stopping him. He knew he wasn’t actually angry. It was like after Billie all over again. He was worried so he acted angry, he put Cas down and pushed him away.  “You can’t… With everything that’s going on, you can’t just go dark like that.” Hearing Cas say that he’d received Dean’s messages, that he knew Dean was calling him, that Dean needed him, and he hadn’t bothered to respond… it hurt more than Dean liked to admit. But all that time not hearing from Cas, not knowing what he had gotten himself into, or if he was even still alive? That hurt worse. “We didn’t know what happened to you. We were worried. That’s not okay.”
right, but I ignored it.”
“Well, I didn’t mean to add to your distress,” Castiel said, and he meant it. He knew if he had told Dean what he was doing; about working with the other angels and going after Dagon – Dean would be much more worried than he already was. He didn’t trust other angels, and he didn’t trust any plan that he hadn’t come up with on his own. He would have put all of his efforts into finding and stopping Castiel, and then Cas wouldn’t be able to save him.
“So… what about you?” Mary asked, looking at Sam, “are you L – G – B – T – Q?” she read the letters out carefully.
“What are you talking about Sammy? Two of these are for me,” Dean said with a laugh, handing one to Cas, who was even less likely to eat it than Sam was, and settling down on the couch next to him. “Now, you ready for this one?” he laughed, “ah, you’re gonna love it.” He reached for the remote, then paused, looking between Sam and Cas, “I miss something?” he asked.
Dean threw his hands up in exasperation, “Ok Sammy, what do you want me to say? ‘you were right?’ It wasn’t a witch; it wasn’t a ghost either but y’know, who cares? And hey, I decided to go along with this whole Men of Letters thing, didn’t I? I followed your lead on that one, and where did that get us? Oh, right, Mick murdered an innocent kid, and they still keep sending us on hunts like we’re their wolfhounds or something.”
Dean looked down at the mixtape he’d set on the table in front of him. It wasn’t much, just some of his favorite Zeppelin songs. The thought of Castiel listening to some of these songs made Dean want to chuckle. He wouldn’t understand a lot of them. He could just imagine the concentrated, confused look on his stupid face. But … Dean wanted to give it to him. He felt like Cas deserved something like this. His music was like a little piece of himself.
And the truth was, he had. He’d thought Asmodues’s calls had been too short, too methodical, too cold. But … he hadn’t wanted to push. His feelings about Cas were … getting complicated. Or maybe they always had been complicated and he’d just started to notice. Just started to admit it. And with Cas so recently back from death – he had been angry at Cas, stubbornly angry at him, right before he’d died. He was afraid that if he pried, if he accused Cas of anything, it would push them into an argument he didn’t want to have. Because what if he had been wrong, and nothing was off about the calls? What if he was just expecting Cas to care more than he actually did?
“You do!” Sam retorted, “He said he needed a win, right? That’s what he’s doing. You treat him like an idiot all the time, like he can’t do anything by himself. Maybe he just wants to show you, to show himself, that he can! He used to be one of heaven’s greatest warriors, but what has he been since he threw his lot in with us?”
“In my experience,” Sam said, “Dean has … his own way of saying it back.” Sam had learned long ago not to expect too many words of affection from his brother, but that didn’t mean that he didn’t show it in different ways.
Sam sighed, but he’d been listening to this for too long to keep his mouth shut any longer, “Listen Dean, I know you don’t want to hear this, but sometimes you need to consider that … maybe you’re not always right. Maybe we don’t understand why Cas is acting the way he is, but maybe he knows something we don’t. Maybe what he’s doing makes perfect sense. You don’t have to call all shots, Dean.”
“Dean,” Sam said, “I know. And believe me, I’m kicking myself over this too,” he paused, not sure how to say what came next. He couldn’t tell Dean not to feel guilty, not with all the guilt he’d been  holding himself with everything they went through. But Cas had made it out. Maybe he was a little worse for wear, but he’d made it home. That was more than they could say for a lot of people.
“No, seriously,” Dean said, “I want to know why you thought that. Give me some reasons.”
“Go,” Cas said, “I think I want to … talk to Dean.”
If they got out of there.
“Wait … what?” Dean said, a little taken aback, “What do you mean?”
was ok? “Yeah, I mean, we all made it home, right? That’s what matters.”
“Oh.” Castiel wasn’t sure if he should feel touched or guilty. He knew the tape wasn’t just a tape to Dean. He opened his mouth to speak, to apologize, to try and explain himself… but nothing came. He glanced toward Dean’s pillow, where he knew the colt was hidden, but pushed the thought away and turned to leave.
Somehow, through the years, Dean had forgotten that.
“it was a crush, Sammy,” Dean said roughly, “You had a crush.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean responded, “He says he’s fine.”
“So…” Sam said, “what’s on your mind?”
I feel, can really be compared to human emotion… but I know he means … everything … to me.” Sam only nodded silently, and Castiel felt like that silence was a sentencing of some sort.  “Promise me,” he said, “that you won’t ever tell Dean that I said that.”
“Maybe because you treat him like he is.”
“What?” Dean snapped.
“Oh,” Cas said, “well, that’s good.”
Dean stared at Cas, feeling like he didn’t recognize him. Dean wasn’t unfamiliar with making the hard calls, he knew morals had to bend sometimes, some people had to be used, but this … turning Donatello into a vegetable? Sometimes he forgot how inhuman Cas could be. Of course, he wasn’t human. He may have had a taste of humanity when he lost his grace, but he was an angel, a celestial being trapped in an earthly vessel, whose true form and voice would blind and deafen a human.
But the bunker still felt so … empty to her. So full of things she didn’t understand, things she didn’t fit with anymore. At the top of that list was her boys. How do you get to know a 33 year old man who is apparently your baby boy? She’d never even heard Sam speak, and now he towered over her and offered to
Dean sat on one end of the sofa; feet propped up on the coffee table in front of him, carefully not spilling the beer that was set there as well. Cas was sitting at the other end, eyes still glued to the screen. He was probably actually reading the credits, he did that sometimes. He said that so many humans had put time and effort into making these things, they deserved at least a few minutes to have their names read.
“We will be, Cas,” Dean assured him. “We will.”
to come back here with a win for you. For myself.”
The tears started to fall, and they were hot, angry tears. Angry at Cas, angry at himself, angry at Chuck for ever letting any of this happen. “Why did he do it?” he asked, unsure what exactly he was referring to. Not answering his phone? Lying to them? Running off with Kelly? Charging against Lucifer, knowing he would lose? “Why does he always have to be so goddamn stupid?” Dean asked, his voice small, “why couldn’t he – why didn’t we just –”
Sam tried to hide his laugh, “Oh yeah, I see it. I’ve
“You can say that again,” Dean agreed, sitting back, “but hey, we won.”
Mary took a moment to compose herself, and Sam tried to understand the twisted-up emotions he was feeling. He loved his mom. That was a decision. He had decided to love her, to trust her, when she’d picked the Men of Letters. Despite how badly that had gone, he wanted to keep choosing her. The way he’d chosen Dean over and over and over again. But building a relationship with a 33 year gap – that was going to take time.
Dean took that comment with a small nod of his head, “You’re right, yeah. Stupid question.”
Cas didn’t seem to be terribly phased that Dean had pulled away. “I’m still amazed that Jack even … remembered me at all,” he said.
Finally, the familiar black impala rolled into view, and after a small moment of disbelief, Dean pulled Castiel into a hug. “Welcome home, pal,” he said gruffly. And as Cas wrapped his own arms around Dean, he knew that he
There was more he wanted to say, but his steel walls of anger hadn’t completely fallen yet. He might understand Cas’s reasoning but that didn’t mean he could just forget it.  That didn’t mean he could just be okay with what had happened today. But still … he wanted to tell Cas that preparing for war couldn’t be the only reason he’d been brought back. If he wanted to believe in some destiny crap that was on him. But Dean didn’t need there to be a higher purpose for his return.  He didn’t need him to be a soldier.
Dean stood to leave, then paused, “What?” he asked, noticing a change in Castiel’s expression.
“Just hungry,” Dean grumbled.
“Ah – We don’t know that for sure,” Sam interjected before Dean could speak. “All we know is he say he has

kill an innocent?”
?” Castiel asked, gesturing between the two of them.
“You, ‘weren’t his biggest fan?’” Sam repeated incredulously, lowering his phone. “Dean, come on—"
“We will find a better way,” Dean answered evasively.
Sam chuckled, “Well, yeah, that’s one of the good things that has changed in the last 30 years. I mean, it’s nowhere near perfect. Charlie had a ton of stories about discrimination, microaggressions, crap she had to deal with on a daily basis. But they can legally get married now. There are anti-discriminations laws being passed and general awareness and normalization is spreading. It’s getting better.”
“With Lucifer’s baby momma,” Dean answered, “but we don’t know where cause he turned off his phone.”
After debating over possible plans, he and Mary had taken a little break from speculating about Dean and she’d asked him to tell her more about Charlie. So, he’d pulled out the box and told her some stories; he stuck to good memories, Mary had gotten a kick out of imagining him and Dean all decked out as LARPers. It was nice, to remember that not everything they had done had been a tragedy. Sometimes he felt that way, especially when it came to people he felt responsible for.
“It’s uh … something Cas said. God, years ago. But it stuck with me, I don’t know why,” he shook his head. “But the tricky thing is, I don’t think either of them are willing, or maybe even able, to admit it. See Cas is an angel, and as human as he acts sometimes, there’s a lot he still doesn’t understand about being human, about emotions and everything. And Dean … well he’s wrapped himself in so many protective layers of toxic masculinity that sometimes I’m not sure when it’s him talking and when it’s just a defense mechanism.”
Cas closed his eyes, this topic seemed to have suddenly exhausted him, “I don’t know Dean, like I said, you don’t really have the language to express it. Calling me a man might be a bit more accurate than calling me a woman, but I’ve had female vessels before.”
“Why, what did you do?”
Sam nodded, understanding, “So, you’re saying it’s better to continue as things are, rather than rock the boat?”
Eventually the song came to an end and Dean pulled the Impala over to the side of the road. Cas was looking at him expectantly, patiently, and it made Dean want to scream.
“Sam’s working on it.” Dean assured him, “Of course, he’s hellbent on finding something that doesn’t mean killing her or her kid.”
“I’m sorry Dean,” Mary said, “I didn’t mean to misunderstand.”
Dean was silent as they made their way through the forest, away from the den of vampires. Gabriel and the girl they had picked up along the way trailed behind him … the girl had seemed wary of Dean after she tried to apologize to him. She wouldn’t walk anywhere close.
,” he gestured to the desolate forest around them. Everything looked dead or dying. Not in the ordinary, changing-of-the-seasons way, but as if something had sucked the life out of the air around them. “Hope,” he shook his head, “he was so certain we would see Mom and Jack again and …” he trailed off, then shot a glance at Cas, “well, we saw how that turned out for him.”
. This was how he knew him. This
“No, they … they’ve forgotten about me,” Dean said, and from the way he said it Mary got the feeling that this was something official. Dean wasn’t just saying it had been a long time or pretending he hadn’t mattered to them. He was certain they had no memory of him. And with the company he kept, that wasn’t entirely impossible. “Besides, like I said. It’s not my scene. I can’t do the whole …. “ he trailed off, waving his hand away from himself, as if brushing away an irrelevant idea.
Dean, to his credit, didn’t try to fumble an escape for himself. He set his jaw, “yeah, I wasn’t the kid’s biggest fan when we first met,” he admitted, “he’s the son of Satan. I mean … this time last year we ALL thought he was going to bring about the next Apocalypse.”
Sam had to admit that Dean had a point. This was part of a toxic pattern, but he also couldn’t blame Castiel for what he’d done. Sam met his brother’s eyes and simply asked, “would you really rather have let mom die for us, after we just got her back?”
Sam sat in the kitchen, eating lunch and mindlessly scrolling through his phone. He couldn’t put into words how it felt to be back in the bunker. To be back home. Granted, being imprisoned by the secret service couldn’t really be compared to the time he’d spent trapped with Lucifer … it was just another trauma to add to his already extensive list. But it was behind him now. He was free.
sexuality. We don’t have the right to tell him how he feels. We just have to, I don’t know, ‘create an environment where he feels safe telling us,’” he said, quoting one of the articles he had read about it.
Sam sighed and shut his laptop, laying it aside, “the thing is Mom, it’s not really our place. Even though we’re his family and everything, it’s his life. It’s
Dean did a double take, “He does?”
Sam placed the photo of Charlie back into his box of memories, putting the brochure from the nursing home where he’d met Eileen on top, and smiling softly at that memory. He should text her.
“I KNOW!” Dean shouted, then he looked down and a heavy silence fell over them all, Dean struggling to control his breathing. “I know,” he repeated softly after a few moments, “Cas was gone and – I know now that wasn’t Jack’s fault, and I know it doesn’t excuse anything –” he took a long breath, then finally looked up and met Cas’s eyes. “I know that I was wrong. Jack’s not a monster, and … I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to make it right with him. But I’m sure as hell going to try.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “I don’t know Sam, I really don’t. I know he’s not stupid, so I can’t understand why he keeps acting like it.”
Mary raised her hands up, palms facing Dean in a sign of peace, “Whoa, I’m sorry. I don’t know about any Anna. I just meant …”  she waited a moment for Dean to meet her eyes, “you and Castiel seem kinda close, but if I’m –”
“Yeah, I’m … So, Jack’s doing well, huh?” Castiel said evasively.
Sam laughed, “What? No, I don’t hate them. They’re great,” but it was very unconvincing, not to mention that Dean had over 30 years of memories telling him otherwise.
Post 12x23 All Along the Watchtower
, he thought.
13x18
Dean had look away, but he turned his gaze back to Castiel. He looked determined, like an immovable stone, but Castiel held his gaze, looking past the defenses. He knew no matter how tough a face Dean Winchester put on; inside he was a good man. And a good man couldn’t kill an innocent woman and her child.
He stared up at the night sky. In some ways, it was like his time in The Empty had never happened. He had no idea how long he had been there, and it all felt like a strange dream … the kind that faded as the sun rose and you found yourself back in reality.
“You mean,
“Look Cas, I know I don’t always agree with you, I don’t always trust your gut but … it’s not because I think you’re stupid or because I don’t trust you.” He stood up, unable to sit still with his heart going the rate it was, “It’s because I can’t … I can’t live in a world without you. And it’s different than with Sam. When Sammy’s in trouble I will go to the ends of the earth to get him back, but with you gone ….” He swallowed, pausing in his pacing to look at Cas, who was watching him intently, “I saw you get killed by an angel blade, I saw your grace explode from your body, and it was like … the world stopped. Everything stopped. I didn’t know what to do …”
“That’s a fantastic idea,” Sam said, then he got up to head to his own room, typing:
He looked it over, not really reading it but … remembering. The way Eileen spoke more with her face than with her words. Her fearlessness. The way she made him laugh.
Dean turned around, but as he headed out of his room, he ran into Castiel. They stopped in the doorway, looking at each other, and Cas had a … troubled look on his face. “You ok, buddy?” Dean asked.
She wanted to know them though, her boys. And the only way that was going to happen was through talking.
Castiel: I have to believe that I was brought back for a reason.
After a moment Cas was back at his side, “Dean,” he said, “are you

“Hey, Cas,” Dean said, moving as if to touch Cas’s shoulder, then changing his mind, “you ok?”
“Yeah, we’ll find him,” Dean found himself saying, “we will.” He wanted to say more. He wanted to tell Cas that he would never let anyone hurt him again. A part of him said that that was ridiculous – Cas was an angel, even when he was weak, he was stronger and more powerful than Dean – but that didn’t seem to matter. Sure, he was an angel, but he was
He didn’t want to think about it. He couldn’t think about it. But he didn’t think he’d be able to get that image out of his head soon. Castiel crumpled on the ground, the life ebbing from him with every breath he took. Dean had seen horrible things but … it never really got easier. He couldn’t stand seeing his family in pain, especially when he couldn’t do anything to help. He’d just … stood there and watched as that blackness oozed out of Castiel. Paralyzed. Defeated.

“Then he’s fine,” Sam said evenly, “and this time we know for sure, because he’s here with us.” Dean still seemed dissatisfied, and Sam sighed, “listen, Dean, Cas took care of himself. He’s fine. You have to realize that it’s not your job to take care of all of us, all of the time. I know that you want to, but you can’t. You’re just one guy.”
“You gotta eat something,” Dean said tersely, then he noticed the box open on the bed, the letter in his hand. “What are you doing?” he asked, sitting opposite Sam on the bed and grabbing for the box. Sam moved to stop him, but without much effort. Dean looked at the contents – pictures of them, the prop they’d gotten at the high school theater production, other tid-bits and trinkets Sam had been collecting. Sam shifted uncomfortably; it wasn’t like Dean didn’t know about this box, just that he’d never let him pick through it before. He felt like a stupid teenage girl getting her diary read.
“The thing,” Dean repeated, standing up, “where you’re worried about me, so you try to be extra nice to me. Stop it, I hate it.”
Dean raised an eyebrow, then chuckled, “Sure mom, ask anything.”
“Hey,” Dean said, noticing Castiel’s despondency, “Ishim was a dick. A lying, murdering, dick. He deserved what he got.”
Sam didn’t respond as Dean slammed the door behind him. Conversations he’d had with Charlie, his mom, Cas … everything they’d said about letting Dean open up first, not pushing him to admit anything – he knew that he’d done the opposite. He shouldn’t have provoked Dean like that. It was stupid and immature, but he was just so … tired. Tired of loosing everyone. Tired of fighting. He knew he’d be ok in a few days, but …
Dean was sitting in Rowena’s hotel room, trying to not fall asleep while Sam and Rowena chatted about spells and herbs on the other side of the room, when his phone rang.
“Come on, Sam, you hate those,” Dean said, turning in his chair to face his brother.
Cas was smiling. It was a small smile, that tugged at his lips in this stupid cute way and Dean hated it. And he loved it.
“I loved him,” Dean heard himself saying, “I
He stared at him hard for a second before saying, “You’re doing the thing again.”
Sam sighed, “I don’t – I know we’ll get him back, we always do. But Dean – he worries. And when it comes to Cas, that worry …” he didn’t want to say it destroyed him, but it was always a struggle to get Dean to focus on anything other than Castiel when there was something wrong. And right now, something was very wrong.
"Knowing you, it... it's been the best part of my life. And the things that... the things we've shared together, they have changed me. You're my family. I love you. I love all of you."
Sam and Dean arrived at the bunker; beat up, sore and tired. Which wasn’t unusual. They were perpetually beat up, sore, and tired. But it wasn’t every day they watched their best friend dissolve a Prince of Hell and then take off with the mother of Lucifer’s child.
Dean groaned and leaned back in his chair. “I am not – I can’t deal with this right now,” he looked exhausted, and after everything that had happened the past few days – being trapped in the bunker with Lady Bevel, organizing the hunters, whatever he’d done to get mom back – Sam couldn’t blame him. “I need … a shower,” Dean said, standing up, “and like, at least 2 hours of sleep.”
Sam swallowed, “Gender has always been … weird for me,” he admitted, “I mean, I’m definitely not a woman, I know that,” he said with a breathy laugh, “but at the same time … I don’t know, I play the role of ‘man’ because its what people expect from me, but … I don’t know if it’s really
Cas: We don’t have time! We can’t save him.
It was brief, but Dean hesitated slightly before shaking his head, “No, not really.”
“Nothing, I’m just…” Castiel shrugged, “glad we’re talking again.”
Dean: “Well if Sam and I knew we would’ve – “
Dean: “Maybe”
“Right, ok,” Mary said, “all the more reason to, I don’t know, give him a push, right?”
. Maybe we could’ve knocked some common sense into him.”
Dean continued, comparing his small failures to Castiel’s, as though they even held a candle to his, “Me and Sam, we had her. We had Kelly and we lost her.”
“You ok?” Sam asked, sitting down at the table with a plate of food.
“Well, I didn’t mean to add to your distress,” Castiel responded, and Dean shook his head, still not looking at the angel. That’s not what he needed to hear.
“’Don’t approve?’” Dean retorted, “Cas, we’re supposed to be the good guys. We told Donatello he’d be ok, that he could go home after this!”
“You didn’t tell me you got out too,” Mary said, surprised. He’d mentioned that Sam had gone to college, but Dean made it sound like hunting was the only life he’d ever known.
Maybe that was something Sam could brush off – maybe it was something Sam needed to brush off – but Dean couldn’t.
Dean: “and you have been with us every step of this long crazy coat ride and no matter how crazy it got you never backed down”
Dean drove the Impala down an empty stretch of road for a few minutes, blasting a Zeppelin song as they went. He knew that Cas knew something was up, and he was beating himself up inside for feeling so … weird and stressed about it. It wasn’t like he’d never told someone he liked them. Why couldn’t he just – act? Like he normally did?
Castiel didn’t respond for a moment, while Dean struggled to find the right thing to say. He had just been so … lost. Then, to his surprise, Cas took his outstretched hand in both his own, and met his eyes with a slight smile. “Well, I guess I can’t exactly complain,” he said, “I’m back now, by … some miracle even I don’t understand.”
“Look, ok,” he said, taking a deep breath to calm himself, “this isn’t about me, this is about Cas.” Dean rolled his eyes, and Sam knew he thought Sam was surrendering. He was wrong, Sam just knew what his priorities were, and they didn’t include resurfacing old arguments that would never be solved. “Listen, I’m mad too, I wish he’d talked to us, I wish we could tackle these problems together, but have you ever stopped to wonder why he keeps doing this? This isn’t the first time he’s gone off and tried to fix something all by himself.”
“Yeah, actually,” Dean sad, “She uh … she’s about to do a tracking spell to help us find Gabriel, hopefully.”
Dean opened his mouth, but at that moment Castiel entered the kitchen. He stood stiffly in the doorway, eyeing the two Winchesters warily.
Sam smiled at him, a little bemused, “yeah, he does,” he said, like it should have been obvious.
“No, I mean …” Sam glanced around, making extra sure Dean was out of the room before moving quickly over to the couch to sit by Cas, “do you think, maybe, humans could be like that too? I mean … like, 8 different genders or something.”
Castiel waited by the telephone booth. Sam and Dean hadn’t been close when he called, so he knew he’d be standing there for a while. It didn’t bother him. It wouldn’t be the first time.
are for me.”
somehow.  Like he’d said too much, but somehow not enough. “I’d like a beer,” he said and pushed passed Castiel into the bunker hallway.
Castiel said nothing to that. Normally, the Winchesters view of good and evil were more nuanced than Cas had been accustomed to before. But in this case, hearing Ishim reduced to “the bad guy” didn’t sit well with Castiel.
Dean scoffed, “he didn’t save our lives, he just delayed our deaths.”
“I know!” Dean said, “I know, I was harsh and unfair—”
Sam: “Then – Then why didn't you call us? Cas, we could've helped you.”
“Right, yeah,” Sam said, still whispering.
“What did he say?” Sam asked.
, but then the moment ended. “Try not to worry me like that again, ok?” Dean said casually, turning the touch into a brotherly pat and heading off to bed.

He smiled, then looked up at Cas, “sorry, I’ve gotta …” he gestured with his phone.
“Dean,” Castiel was exasperated, “I wish …” he started, but seemed to think better of it. They trudged on for a few more moments, the crunch of dead leaves filling the air.
“I know,” Sam said again, and this time the hurried tone was gone.
“Right,” Sam said, reaching for his own phone, “I’ll call – I’ll call Jody and Donna and … everyone. Let them know to call us if they hear of anything.”
“Oh, Come on –”
Dean was quiet for a moment, thinking. “Sam, I’m sorry,” Dean began eventually, standing, “I really am. Eileen was – she was awesome. So was Charlie, so was Kevin, none of them deserved what they got … And I know, we’ve lost a lot of people but … we can’t stop fighting. I know, I was ready to stop not too long ago. I was … closer than you know,” he admitted shakily, “but then we got Cas back and I realized –”
DEAN: So, if it's gone, then that means that we can't open that door again. [yelling] If we can't open the door, then I should've never come back! [Dean throws his hand across the table, scattering things onto the floor.] Son of a bitch! Every time! [He puts his hands on his head and turns away from Sam and Castiel, who look on in shock.]
“I'm following a very interesting lead,” came the answer. “I'll fill you in when I know more. See you soon, Dean.”
Dean couldn’t believe it. They had done it. They had actually done it. They got mom back, they got Jack back, Lucifer was gone, they didn’t have to worry about evil alternate Michael anymore … it had been a long time since they’d won like this without causing their next big problem in the process.
Castiel stood outside Dean’s door, hesitant to enter, but knowing that he had to. He knocked, and when no answer came, he pushed the door open. Dean sat at the desk, staring at his computer as numbers flashes across the screen. Deliberately not looking up.
Castiel (to Donatello): I’m sorry, but I’m not going to let you, or anyone hurt the people I love. Not again.
seeing it for – what, going on 8 years now?”
Dean’s expression softened, and he lay a hand on Castiel’s shoulder, “Me too, man.” Their eyes met and for a moment Castiel thought that, maybe, Dean was about to say …
“Dean, Jack didn’t ‘get into my head’” Cas said evenly, “everything I did … that was my choice.”
The next thing he knew, Castiel had his arms around him. Dean clung back. He held him close and he knew it was true. He didn’t know how to say it or what to do about it, but … he loved this man. More deeply and more passionately than he had ever loved anyone before. He wouldn’t lose him again. He couldn’t.
deserves forgiveness,” he shook his head, “I know he’s hurt you Dean. But have you ever stopped to consider how much you hurt him?”
“What the HELL was he thinking?” Dean yelled for maybe the fortieth time, “I mean, as if lying to us and stealing from us wasn’t bad enough. ‘He did it for us,’” Dean repeated mockingly. “For
Castiel stared at empty space where Jack had been standing, refusing to believe what had just happened. How could Jack just be … gone?
” Dean met his gaze; sure, maybe he had been frustrated yesterday (with plenty of reason) but that didn’t mean Sam had to walk on eggshells around him and try to make him feel “better.” After a moment Sam sighed and shook his head, letting Dean win the staring contest. “It’s not just for you,” he said, “we’re
A knock came to his door but Dean pointedly ignored it. Castiel opened the door anyway, “Sorry, Dean,” he said, and Dean didn’t look at him.  “Um, I just wanted to return this,” he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out the tape Dean had given him, laying it on the desk.
Sam knew what she meant but he shook his head, “not that I know of. I mean … after what happened with Ramiel there was … something,” he said, “but with Cas going AWOL and then stealing the colt … they haven’t really had an opportunity.”
Sam huffed in frustration, “He saved our lives. He saved mom’s life. The least you could do is thank him.”
“No! God, no, Cas I –” Dean exclaimed, reaching forward as if to grab Cas’s hand, “of course I wanted you back!” He hated the pleading tone that crept into his voice, but he couldn’t do anything to stop it. “I didn’t know what to do. I knew – I knew that Chuck had brought you back before, so I prayed. I prayed for the first time in I don’t know how long but – he’s gone. And you were gone. And, I – I –” he swallowed hard, fighting the trembling in his voice.
“Dean, you said you’d kill him!” Sam yelled, “He was barely alive for
Sam looked at him levelly, “Yesterday, you basically flipped this table,” he said, “you weren’t exactly
“Oh,” Sam said, and he also glanced at Castiel, before returning his full attention to his cup of coffee. “Yeah, it can be hard for Dean to open up,” was all he said.
“He’d been possessed by Lucifer for months! I’m just … “
Post 12x12 Stuck in the middle (with you)
Mary sighed and rolled her eyes, and Sam understood the frustration. As much as he wanted to, this wasn’t something he could just kill. This was deeply complex emotional stuff that Dean was dealing with – and Dean never dealt with that kind of thing well. He repressed, and he drank, and he sublimated, and they were lucky when, or if, he actually opened up. He’d been getting better at communicating, as had Sam – the two of them hadn’t fought they way they used to in a long time – but he still just kept pushing forward, refusing to process everything they’d gone through. Everything they were still going through.
CASTIEL: Dean... we will find Gabriel. We will.
After a few moments, Mary spoke again, “How is Dean? I mean … I remember how angry he was that Castiel almost died –” guilt flickered across her eyes, “I can’t imagine he’s been dealing with this disappearance well.”
Dean sat up straighter, pulling his hand back, making an effort to be nonchalant. “Yeah, it’s – it’s crazy. We never get a win like this.”
“I’ve read a lot – personal blog posts, academic articles, social experiments, psychology books – you name it.” Sam said, sitting on his bed beside his mom, laptop in hand. “Our friend Charlie helped a lot – she was kinda like a sister to us,” he said, smiling softly at the memory. “Also a lesbian, so she kinda introduced me to the LGBTQ set of terms, and online communities and stuff.”
“No,” Dean responded, then hesitated as he processed her full question, “an angel? What? … I mean there was Anna but … how could you know about that? What? Why would you say that?” He was muttering almost to himself now, more than talking to her, and she thought she’d seen an extra wall of defenses suddenly appear around his already walled off emotions.
in this unborn Nephilim.”
Castiel began to walk in time with Dean, he opened his mouth to speak but Dean picked up his pace, shouldering past him. “Don’t talk to me,” he grunted. Not right now.
“Okay, well, what's going on?” Dean asked.
Cas took the tape, examining the title, and a soft smile came to his face, “Thank you,” he said, meeting Dean’s eyes.
Sam’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Castiel could tell that he’d made him uncomfortable, but he got the sense that no amount of small talk would have made the situation less awkward.
“Dean, come on,” Sam said tiredly, “Cas can handle himself. And … as long as he’s answering his phone we know he’s ok, right?”
Sam shook his head, turning away from his brother. He always did this. If Sam or Cas were in danger, Dean would rush in, making a rash decision to save them, regardless of the consequences. But the second one of them did the same for him, consequences were suddenly the only thing that mattered.
was going to die that day, but today … watching Castiel …
“Did we Dean?” Cas asked.
“Hello Dean,” Cas responded, “were you able to find Rowena?”
The credits rolled across the screen, unevenly illuminating the “Dean Cave” where they all sat. Dean had ended up buying a new, not-cursed, TV, which was much less exciting but also much less murder-y. Sam was sitting in the armchair, scribbling in a journal, which Dean had felt defeated the whole purpose of having a movie night, but Sam said that it counted that he was in the same room as them, and besides, he’d seen this movie a hundred times with Dean and he didn’t need to pay attention to know what was going on. It seemed he was done with his “overly nice” routine.
“He doesn’t have it on him,” Dean pointed out, gesturing to the table in the library, where Jack’s cellphone was, “but, I mean let’s face it, he’s no good at laying low. We’ll just have to keep an ear to the ground for any Nephilim-like phenomenon.”
And suddenly words failed him. His throat felt caught by something, and he fought back tears that he felt creeping into the corners of his eyes. He’d lost Cas before, and he felt like all the grief he’d been pushing down for years was beginning to bubble up. Even as he stood right in front of him, the feeling of helplessness, of failure, started to consume him.
“Oh yeah,” Sam said with a nod, then took a long drink of his coffee. “At first, I was a little jealous,” he admitted, “thought our new angel friend liked Dean better than me, trusted him more or whatever. But it’s not that.” He ran a hand through his hair, shaking out what remained of his bedhead, “Cas and I are friends. Good friends. But between him and Dean there’s…” he chuckled, “I hate to say it but ‘a more profound bond,’ is probably the best way to describe it.”
“Uh – I’m good Dean,” Sam called after him as he quickly left the room.
Sam had sat in silence most of the car ride home, silently processing everything that had happened that day, while Dean processed it loudly in the driver seat. He hadn’t shut up for more than a minute since they’d woken up in the park with Castiel and Kelly long gone.
“Not in the way you would conceptualize it, no,” Cas answered simply.
Sam: “You talk to Cas yet?”
with somebody.” He shook his head, exasperated, “do you know how infuriating it’s been, to watch you constantly push away and belittle the one person in the world who loves you above everything? When I am just
“But you see it too?” Mary asked, “I’m not crazy or making things up?”
He walked through the bunker. Sam was busy trying to catch all the new people up on how things worked in their world, and Jack was getting some much-needed sleep. Dean poked his head into a few rooms, looking for Cas. Now that the world wasn’t ending, for once, he … felt like there was something he needed to do. Something he needed to say.
“And we’re sure this is Cas?” Sam asked, worry creasing his brow. “I mean, I don’t even know how that’s possible –”
Dean scoffed, “Am
Dean scoffed, “That he’s ‘following an interesting lead’ and he’ll fill us in later.”
you boys been?”
Naomi: We never did see eye to eye.
Dean tapped the brochure Sam had taken from the Oak Park Retirement Home, “What’s this for?” he asked, “you looking for a place to settle down?” He chuckled weakly but Sam didn’t smile. He just packed up the box and set it back on his desk.
deserves a seat at the table,
“Dean,” Sam said, like he was worried he would offend Cas.
Dean breathed out. First step over. Time for the next one.
Dean: “No Cas, I’m pretty far from alright.”
her things. And Dean … the last she’d seen of him he’d been a four-year-old boy who loved nothing more than hanging off his father’s arm and talking, talking endlessly about nothing. Now he was stoic and scarred. She hadn’t missed the pained look on his face when she’d mentioned what a good father John was in her memory. What had happened to her beloved John? What had he become? She almost didn’t want to know, not if it was the source of the pain in her sons’ eyes.
But he remembered now. Ever since Cas had come back from death, he’d had a drive, a passion, that Dean hadn’t seen in him for a long time. He carried himself differently. He fought ferociously. And he wouldn’t let anyone get in his way … even Dean.
His phone vibrated and he paused to check it. A message from Eileen:
And he still had a job to do. He would save his mom and Jack from this Hell of a world, even if he had to do it without his brother.
“Huh, well,” memories of them – Jessica, Amelia, even Ruby – flashed through his mind, but he shook his head, “none of them have happy endings. Maybe … stories for another time.”  Another name passed through his mind, but he didn’t have a story to tell about her yet. He was just at the beginning of that story, but he hoped it would have a happier ending than the rest did.
“I’m tired,” Sam retorted, “can’t I just have like … a day?”
“What about –” Castiel shook his head in frustration, “You’re talking about me and Dean, being ….” He searched for a term, “romantically involved,” he settled on, looking at Sam intently.
Castiel heaved a sigh, “we just lost the most powerful being in all of existence,” he looked at Dean, “do you think I’m ok?”
Dean would be angry, when he noticed it was missing. But he would forgive him, once he understood. He had to.
Castiel looked pensive, “and if you find her again?”
“Alright,” he said begrudgingly after a moment, “fine. I won’t ask you to.”
Dean chuckled, “Yeah, she was pretty, alright. And smart and strong and … she had this kid named Ben. He was just … man, he was the best. Looked up to me, wanted to be like me,” there was emotion creeping into Dean’s voice and Mary could tell he wasn’t comfortable showing it to her, at least not yet. Maybe not ever.
Mary: “Since I’ve been back, I know I’ve been distant. Cold even. Leaving you, working with them…  I was trying to make things right. Just … from a distance. Because being here with you was too hard. … seeing what I’d done to you. To Sam. I …”
Sam, Dean, and Castiel sat around the table in the bunker, drinking and chatting. Castiel had an odd, twisted feeling, knowing that he was the only member of his old battalion still living. Even knowing that heaven had been corrupted, even with everything he had done, they were still his brothers. He still had fond memories of them and the years they’d spent together. And here he sat, with his … new battalion, his new family. He didn’t regret the choices he had made, but that didn’t erase the relationships he’d had before. Everything he had now destroyed.
“What? No, I mean like …” Dean didn’t understand Cas’s objection, and searched for another example of what he was trying to say, “Like, Crowley, he was … a guy. Sure, he could possess a woman if he wanted to, but that’s just kinda like … if he put on a dress or something. Like, Crowley’s still a man no matter what he’s wearing, right?”
Then, to his surprise, the call picked up. “Hello Dean,” Cas’s voice said from the other end.
So much for feeling good.
Pre13x23
deserves trust,
Dean was silent for a moment, replaying the day’s events in his mind. He thought of the concern he’d seen on Cas’s face after Donatello had tried to suffocate Dean. What would Dean have done, if the situation was reversed? If Donatello had put Cas’s life in danger …
"Well, I’ve been thinking,” Dean said, “Your buddy Benjamin, his vessel was a woman, but he was a guy, right? I mean,
Dean wished he could explain why it bothered him so much. Yes, he knew that Asmodeus was powerful, a master of trickery, that anyone could have been fooled. But still,
Dean grumbled, but didn’t respond, attacking his plate of food in silence.
“Oh, I was just, telling mom here some stories about our grand adventures,” Dean said smoothly. A moment past, then he stood abruptly, “anyway, I should go … shower.” And with that, he was gone.
He smiled to himself. He started to write a response, but he wasn’t sure what to say. It hadn’t exactly been the kind of day you could sum up in a text. He hesitated, then glanced up and saw the number 15 on the door in he’d paused by – Castiel’s room. Cas had gotten hit with the worst of it that day.
Mary raised an eyebrow at her 37-year-old son, who, by her approximations, was acting like someone who had been caught with his hand in a cookie jar and was desperately trying to prove his innocence. “You really wanna hear it?”
“I get that man, I really do,” Sam said, “and, I mean, it’s up to you. But I’ve learned that sometimes, if you don’t rock the boat, you could end up somewhere you never wanted to be.”
“You’re going to have to talk to him eventually,” Sam said, but Dean continued as if Sam hadn’t spoken.
… and share their stories like it’s no big deal?”
Sam turned, startled, “Hey, Cas, come on in,” he said, closing the box and turning to face his friend. “You … need something?”
“I’d like that,” Castiel said, not meeting Dean’s eyes. He really would. He wished that he could honestly accept Dean’s offer, and the three of them could rush in, guns blazing, and save the world.
“No,” he answered simply, “I don’t … eat. I was looking for clues to where Lucifer might be, but I thought I heard my name from in here.”
Cas looked at Dean and found himself with a question he was afraid to ask. On the one hand, Dean was the most important person in his life. He admired him, trusted him, loved him, even. Working the case together, spending time where they didn’t have to worry about the fate of world, even pretending to be cowboys, had stoked those feelings within him. Cas loved just existing beside this man, it made him feel … real. But on the other hand, he knew from personal experience that when Dean wanted to hurt someone – well, he didn’t pull his punches. Even sometimes when he
Dean looked at him levelly, then nodded, “Fine. A day. I’ll leave you alone. But you should get rid of some of that stuff. It’s not good for us to dwell on the past.”
It took Dean a moment, but realization lit up his eyes, “Oh, that’s where we met –”
“And there hasn’t been anyone else?” Mary asked.
“He’s—” he took a shaky breath, and, involuntarily, his eyes darted down to the body that lay in front of him. The empty shell that used to be Castiel.
Mary nodded in understanding, and turned back to the computer, obviously trying to hide how amazed and confused she was by the way technology had advanced since her death. “So,” she said, steering the conversation back on track, “what does all this tell us about Dean?”
Dean sat up at the sound of footsteps and saw Cas entering from the hallway. “Cas,” he greeted, “what are you doing up this late?”
Dean: “You're not our babysitter, Cass, okay? That is not your job.”
Sam opened his mouth, but he wasn’t sure he knew how to answer that. He hadn’t seen his mom since they’d killed the Alpha Vampire, and although they’d kept in touch with occasional texts and phone calls – most of those going through Dean – he still didn’t know how to talk to her. She was his mom, and he loved her, he knew that, but still …
“Not even someone who is already a part of this life? Another hunter, an angel … or, something?”
Sam was taken aback, “it’s all I’ve got to remember her,” he protested.
“I…” Castiel started, but then paused, searching for words, “Dean, I just keep failing. Again, and again. When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn’t find you. And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn’t find her. And I just wanted… I needed to come back here with a win for you. For myself.”
Castiel: War.
on us.”
He just needed him. He needed him safe. He needed him whole.
But he
Castiel sat on Sam’s desk chair, honestly more nervous than he should have been. Sam sat on the edge of his bed, with his hands clasped in front of him, waiting expectantly. Castiel had a feeling he should try to build up to the conversation topic, but he didn’t know where to start. After a couple moments, he decided to just jump right into it. “I know what you’ve been discussing with Mary,” he said, meeting Sam’s eyes.
Sam nodded, “Well … ok then. So, he’s ok?”
“So did I,” Cas said, sounding incredibly tired, “But I guess we were … misled. Anyway, it doesn’t matter, the angels can’t help us.”
“Hey, no,” Sam said, wrapping her in his arms. He didn’t like being reminded of that, his time without a soul. He didn’t like knowing that person was still in him, in some way. “No, Mom, if you’re going to blame anyone blame Lucifer. Blame Azazel. None of that was on you.”
Dean: No!
Dean looked at Sam, steel-eyed and silent. Then he shook his head in frustration, grabbed his sandwich, and walked away.
“Yes, Dean. I’ve existed since the dawn of time; I’ve had many vessels. Not all of them were men,” Cas said, like he was explaining to a child that 2+2=4. But the thought had legitimately never crossed Dean’s mind. He’d always seen Cas as … well, a man.
“Yeah,” Sam said, “I know, it’s stupid, but – it was something I wanted to remember.”
Cas smiled a little sheepishly, “a while,” he said evasively.
Dean called Cas for what felt like the hundredth time, he was having trouble staying focused on the road, trying to keep his mind from jumping to the worst conclusions. He knew he shouldn’t have let him go alone. The other angels hated Cas, what if they’d had some kind of trap waiting for him? And what was with the demon ambush at the bar?
“What? I’m just wondering,” Dean said, taking a sip of his beer. He was, just wondering. It wasn’t like it mattered. It wasn’t.
Dean: I mean, we save people, Sam.
Cas: He’s gone.
Sam chuckled, “Yeah, like David Bowie. But the thing is, Charlie and I were pretty sure that he’s struggling with a lot of internalized homophobia.” He pointed at the screen, which had the definition of that pulled up, as well as some advice about how to deal with it.
“I’m leaving tomorrow,” Castiel said, breaking into Dean’s train of thought, “I think I have on lead on Kelly.”
at him, the way he looks at you. It’s just obvious the two of you mean a lot to each other” Mary finished, “again, I didn’t mean to misinterpret.”
Castiel already wasn’t a good man. He had blood on his hands that went back eons. He wouldn’t let Dean or Sam add this crime to their conscious. He needed them to stay good men.
Dean was still angry. He was still hurting. He still didn’t want to even look at Castiel’s stupid face. But seeing the tape … he remembered why he’d given it to Cas. Remembered the day they’d all thought Cas was going to die. He might be furious at Castiel right now, but that didn’t mean he hadn’t meant it when he’d given it to him. “It's a gift,” he said, still not looking up, but holding the tape back out toward Castiel, “You keep those.”
“What the hell? I thought she was dead!”
So, Cas would rescue himself. Even if that meant trusting the devil.
Sam started at Dean, wide eyed. He’d spent so many years sighing and letting Dean take the wheel, following was easier than leading after all. He’d learned that fighting him hardly ever worked, but it astounded him that Dean seemed blinded to his own mistakes. Blinded to his own hypocrisy. As if Dean didn’t hold the blame for half the things they’d gone through.
Mary and Dean sat at the kitchen table, sipping coffee in silence. Mary smiled at Dean, “So,” she began, only a little awkward, “do you mind if I ask you some … getting to know you questions?”
“Right, and if he doesn’t find something?” Castiel asked, already knowing the answer, “If you run out of time; could
Dean rolled his eyes, “Well, I’m ready now,” he said, “and you, sir, have a lot of missed time to make up for.”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
As if they were on a hunt, and the internalized homophobia were the next monster they needed to take out. In a way, that was almost how Sam thought of it. Obviously, it wasn’t deadly or anything like the monsters they usually hunted, but it was something that was robbing his brother of happiness. Happiness that Dean desperately needed. They went through too much heart ache and suffering, at least one of them deserved to be happy.
“Dude, seriously?” Sam said after a moment, and Dean finally looked up from his sandwich.
Sam knocked lightly on the door, and opened it when Cas called for him to come in. He had a book open on his desk, but he didn’t seem to have been really reading it.
Eventually, he sat up and pulled his box out, setting it on his bed. Laying on top of his collection of memories was the letter Eileen had sent them, the one they had gotten too late. This box was supposed to hold happy memories. It was supposed to remind him of all the reasons staying alive was worth it; that his life had been worth it. But he hadn’t wanted to toss this letter, and it had seemed the most reasonable place to put it.
try to force them out of the closet. Most of the time it just shoves them farther in and does more damage than good.”
It was a good feeling.
Dean suddenly found it very hard to breathe. To think. To exist as anything other than this – a man kissing an angel – his angel.
Dreams where he was too late.
Cas pulled away and Dean blinked in surprise. “How – wha?”
“Exactly,” Castiel responded. He did …
. Cas and I, we’re like … we’re like brothers, ok?  We’re like …” he paused and looked away from her, seeming to search for a better descriptor, but not finding one, “But, God, Mom, I’m not … I’m not gay!”
“Yeah,” Dean said, smiling back briefly. That small moment, the touch of his hands, had pulled him back to the present, negative emotions about a past that didn’t matter anymore flew away. He was here, now, with Cas.
Sam chuckled, “because, you hate it when I pick, and we both know that if Cas picks, we’re gonna end up watching a three-hour Netflix documentary on bees.” Dean laughed; it was true, they’d learned their lesson after a couple of failed attempts.
Dean was wrong of course, Castiel hadn’t had any idea what being human would be like before he lost his grace, but he appreciated the sentiment. And, in a way, he understood what Dean meant. Meeting Sam and Dean – he hadn’t only opened his mind to new ideas, he’d opened his heart. And Dean Winchester had made his way inside before Castiel could do anything to stop him.
times Cas’s decisions – or yours – have led us into deeper trouble than we already were? Sorry, Sammy, but I call the shots cause I seem to be the only one capable of making them!”
“Cas? Hey.” Dean said, glancing at Sam in the passenger seat. “Are you okay? We– we tried to track you down, but you were gone.” He couldn’t keep the worry out of his voice. “We ran into a bunch of demons. What's happening?
“I’m furious at Ishim for what he made me do, for what I was complicit in, but I remember him being good, at least in some ways. And Benjamin and Maribel … they didn’t deserve this.” He paused, “but Lily didn’t deserve to lose her child …. and it makes me worry if there were more missions he led us on under false pretenses. I don’t even know the number of my crimes. I meant what I told Lily, if she needs to kill me to complete her revenge, she is welcome.” Castiel didn’t want to die, but he knew he had to answer for his sins at some point.
Sam had a feeling Dean wasn’t going to get much sleep tonight anyway.
Cas: No, no we didn’t, because you stole my memories, and you threatened to "tear me apart," and you made me repeatedly act out Dean Winchester’s murder, and you killed many, many people.
That was only one of the many questions she had but was too afraid to ask. She’d missed so many milestones, so many memories. What was Sam’s first word? When did he learn to walk? What was their favorite subject in school? She had wanted to help them with science projects and prom dates and sports games and getting their first jobs. But she supposed they hadn’t had any of those anyway, not with the way they grew up. On the road, always chasing the next job. Just like her childhood.
“Nah, come on,” Sam said, “We could … watch one of those old westerns or something.”
regularly?”
Mary looked down, “I know …” She said, then restarted, “I wanted to be a good mom,” she said, meeting Sam’s eyes. “When I woke up in the forest and Dean found me, I was so determined to be good to you, to make up for lost time. But … I guess I never got much practice at it,” she said with a wry chuckle, “I didn’t know how to … be there for you.”
Jessica. Jo and Ellen. Bobby. Kevin. Charlie. Eileen. Now Kaia. Along with faces he couldn’t fit to names, but that he remembered. Lying dead. Just because they’d known the Winchesters.
Castiel took his time answering the question. How did he feel about Dean Winchester? That was a complicated question. He knew what he wanted to say, and he knew what Dean thought he should say, but somewhere in the middle lay the truth. Dean would say they needed each other and leave it at that. But Castiel … he did need Dean. More than anyone he had ever known. Although Dean could be cruel when he felt betrayed, although they had both hurt each other countless times, Castiel couldn’t imagine his life without Dean Winchester. He’d had a long time to think while Lucifer was parading around in his vessel, and Dean had been at the forefront of his thoughts. Out of all the things he had missed while he was trapped in his own mind … When Dean had tried to free him from Lucifer, and he’d had that small moment of control – seeing the concern in Dean’s eyes, the desperation. That had snapped something in him, it had taken a moment to set in, but once Lucifer was gone, Castiel knew he never wanted to be parted from Dean like that ever again.
“Good morning Castiel,” Mary said eventually, “need some breakfast?”
“Sam –” Cas started to say.
“Hey, Dean, what do you want to watch tonight?” Sam asked, walking into the library where Dean sat at his computer.
“She wasn’t an American Hunter!” Sam interrupted, “She was Irish, and she was supposed to be in
Sam: Yeah, we also get people killed, Dean. Kaia, for instance. She helped us and she died for it.
did to Lily, was pretty damn jacked-up. But if she ever comes looking for you, you know I would be there to stop her.”
his face, his body. Whatever vessels Cas had had before, this was the one Dean knew, and it was this version of Cas that he –
Dean shook his head, mouth full, and Sam thought for a moment that was all he was gonna get, but eventually Dean spoke, “I just …” he swallowed, “I just can’t believe we didn’t know that Cas was – that it wasn’t Cas we were talking to. How did we not pick up on that?”
Dean didn’t know what he’d do. They’d just gotten him back. There hadn’t been time for … for anything.
Silence. And then, “I don’t know, Dean,” Cas said, “I’m … I’m trying to stay focused. We need to find Jack. That’s what matters. That’s all that matters.”
Sam left for his room, and Dean moved to collect the now empty bottles. He paused and looked at Cas, “Hey, you alright?”
“Oh,” Cas said, taking it back. He took a breath, and for a moment Dean thought he was going to say something. But then he turned to leave.
“Ok,” Sam said, after a moment, “ok, how do we find him? Maybe we can track his phone or …”
“Yeah?” Mary smiled back at him, and Sam was really grateful that somehow, this didn’t feel awkward. Despite the fact that he was talking to a woman he hadn’t even known until recently, about a topic that he usually never breached, he felt like … well, like he was just chatting with his mom. “You wanna tell me about some?”
So, he hadn’t said anything, and by trying to respect Cas boundaries, he’d ended up leaving him locked up by the new king of Hell for weeks.
Cas said, incredulous.
Dean met Castiel’s eyes, daring him to pretend that Dean hadn’t already done countless unspeakable things. But after a moment, Dean looked away. He knew Castiel was right. No matter how much they believed it to be necessary, he and Sam would not be able to kill Kelly. He didn’t want to be the kind of person who could. Never again. “We will find a better way,” he said in an almost resigned tone.
“I think I upset him,” she said with a sigh.
CASTIEL: Nothing. I took it. …  This is the only way we win, and this is the only way we survive. It’s like you said, Dean. Whatever it takes.
"Um,” Dean hadn’t thought about it. Normally he had a long list of movies he wanted to rewatch, movies he wanted to show Cas. But they had fallen out of the habit of movie nights recently, and he didn’t have any movies that came to mind, “I don’t know, you can pick tonight.”
Sam sighed, dropping his shoulders and his fake-happy attitude, “Dean, come on –”
“Well, yeah,” Dean responded, taken aback, “We got back safe, the bad guy’s dead … that’s a win in my book.”
“What?” Dean asked
The cold night air rushed across Dean’s face from the open window of the Impala.  Everything that had happened that day – even his encounter with Death – felt like it was being swept away by each gust of wind. The despair that had been weighing on him for weeks was gone, leaving him with one thing – hope.
Post 12x19 The Future
“Dean, there was nothing we could do,” Castiel said and Dean refused to look at him, “There were too many of them, and they’d already hurt him too badly. Maybe, if Gabriel was at full power but …” he stopped in his tracks, grabbing Dean’s arm and forcing him to face him. “I wasn’t going to let you die.”
Sam sighed, “I know, Asmodeus was … he checked in with us all the time, we never even suspected,” he laughed wryly, “maybe we should’ve. I mean, when’s the last time Cas kept us in the loop
CASTIEL: Jack!
DEAN: Yeah. Hell, yeah.
“Like David Bowie?” Mary asked
Cas turned to stare at the telescope again, and Dean struggled to find something to say. He glanced around them, at the various people perusing the library, then cleared his throat. “Hey, Cas, you – uh, you wanna go for a drive?”
” he admitted, “it felt like … everything was on fire. Like I could feel bits of myself disintegrating slowly. And I knew there was nothing I could to do stop it.
“So, run this by me again,” Mary said, “Castiel is … where?”
welcome into this world.
“I'm sorry. I'm fine.” Cas’s voice said.
“It’s him,” Dean assured him,
He felt … light. In a way he hadn’t in a long time. Like maybe he could actually be … happy.
“Well, good,” Dean said, feeling his anger start to rise, “Cause if Naomi is in heaven, I don’t think I want their help.”
to make it up to them, “I
“I don’t know I guess the kid must have gotten pretty attached to you when he … got into your head or whatever.” Dean said gruffly. He still hated thinking about that day, when Castiel’s eyes had glowed yellow and he’d left them unconscious in front of the gates of heaven.
Sam: “I mean obviously you’ve changed, but it’s all been for the better, man”
.” He paused for a moment, looking for Cas’s reaction but he didn’t really seem to have one, he was just looking at Sam pensively. Suddenly, Sam felt like he shouldn’t have said anything, “I’m not saying I wanna wear skirts and makeup like some of the – nonbinary people I see online but … I don’t know. Nevermind, it doesn’t matter,” he shook his head,  moving back to his armchair.
“Sam,” Cas said, “what are you trying to tell me?”
Dean met Cas’s eyes with a glare, refusing to be the first to look away. A part of him knew that Cas was right. It wouldn’t help anyone if they had all gotten slaughtered in that den of vampires. But it had felt like giving up. Like letting Sam die when there was still a chance to save him – no matter how small of a chance it had been. Cas had held him back and made him watch his little brother be dragged away by monsters.
and you say something like that to him? What did you think was gonna happen? Nothing I said – nothing Cas did – was gonna matter after that, because you already convinced him that he wasn’t worth saving!”
“Yes, dumbass. We.” Dean answered with no hesitation. How could Castiel doubt that? “You, me, and Sam, we’re just better together,” he said, standing. “So now that you’re back, let’s go, Team Free Will,” though they hadn’t used that name in years it was still who they were. Fighting against what the powers that be said was right and using their own agency and moral compasses to let everyone have a fair shot. They were going to save Kelly and this baby and help them live normal lives, away from the conniving plots of angels and demons. But Team Free Will wasn’t complete without Castiel.  “Let’s get it done.”
“Right, yeah, that’s the problem,” Sam said, scratching the back of his neck in frustration. “I mean, I guess I was just hoping that maybe he’d said something to you that he hadn’t said to me. But … I don’t know Cas. I mean, well, how do you even feel about all of this?”
Sam: “So, what you’re just gonna keep walking past each other in the kitchen, not saying a word?”
Dean yelled, slamming his hand on the table.
Sam nodded empathetically. Slow but inevitable was the worst kind of death in his opinion. But at least it had given Castiel the opportunity to say some last words, although thankfully they hadn’t ended up being his last. “Thanks, for what you said, by the way,” Sam said, “I know maybe I wasn’t the … main audience but – well it meant a lot.”
“Ok,” Mary said, sitting back after she had finished reading the page, “but you haven’t approached Dean about this? Ever?”
He hated that he had Crowley to thank. That Crowley had been the only one with the presence of mind to break the damn lance. Crowley could have just as easily taken off with the lance. What would Dean have done then? Why couldn’t he have thought of that? He’d been stupid and shocked and useless, and he hated it.
?” Dean snapped, “So… you’re just gonna sit in your room, look at old pictures and starve yourself? What’s your plan?”
DEAN: If we could...really change things? Well, maybe with Jack, we can.
“Yeah … What about you, any luck with the angels?”
glad to see you.”
Sam left Dean in the kitchen, staring at an empty plate. He was frustrated by how easily Sam was brushing this all aside. He got that they had bigger things to worry about, he really did, but even Cas was acting like it didn’t matter that they’d let him sit in a cell for weeks.
“So … what?”  Mary asked, frustration on her brow, “we just keep waiting? I mean you said this has been going on for 8 years – ”
DEAN: Every time we get close, it always falls apart. Every freakin' time.
“I’d like that” Castiel said softly, not meeting Dean’s eyes.
Cas was still just staring, feeling almost … empty. He’d lost Jack Kline. He’d promised Kelly … and he’d failed. He’d only just gotten back, and already he hadn’t been able to protect him.
Cas heaved a heavy sigh, “Well, I spoke with … Naomi.”
Dean: “What Ishim said … you’re not weak Cas, you know that, right?”
Castiel: “I know. I wanted to keep you out of this. I-I was trying to keep you safe.”
Sam did his best puppy-eyed innocent look, “What thing?”
tense. I think we could all use a little time to unwind, have fun. We haven’t had a movie night in a while.”
Sam glanced between Dean and Cas, clearly noticing the tension. “Ok,” he said, “So … we know what we really need for the spell now,” he hesitated, nodding a little at Cas, “thanks,” he said uncertainly, “Uh – I’ll start hitting the books, see what the lore can tell us about them.”
Cas: “Well he’s a shapeshifter, besides I was the one who got myself captured.”
Before he could yell something back to Dean, his brother pushed the door open and came in, a plate of pancakes in one hand.
to be able to express how he felt to Dean. He clung to every opportunity he had to hug Dean, hold him close. He wished for more. But Castiel had been around for a long time, he knew how to be patient.
“I heard your prayer,” Cas answered simply, and Dean remembered, years ago, when Cas had told him that a prayer didn’t have to be formally spoken; that angels could pick up on longing, even if the person wasn’t aware of it in themselves.
Sam shifted in the armchair, he had something on his mind that he had never been planning on voicing aloud, but after the conversation they’d just had … “Actually, Cas, can I talk to you about … all that?” he said, as soon as Dean was out of earshot.
“Well, that’s kind of a –”
“Sammy,” Dean said worriedly, and Sam was already shaking his head. He loved Dean but sometimes it was infuriating that he still treated him like his baby brother. “What happened to her, you know that wasn’t on us. The Men of Letters, they were going after every American hunter –”
He really did? Well, alright, then she was going to lay it out for him exactly as she had seen it. Maybe it was presumptuous of her to think she knew his emotions better than he did after only a few days of knowing him, but what was it they said about a mother’s intuition? “Well, alright. First, when I first met him. You guys hugged, he seemed
Sam, who was waiting for his call to pick up, gave Cas a warning glance, shaking his head almost imperceptibly. But then he shot a glare at Dean, which told Cas everything he needed to know. Jack had not received the …
“Have you ever thought of looking for them again?” she asked.
“There was so much I wasn’t there for,” Mary continued, looking at Sam with sympathy, “Dean told me – I mean I knew you’d both been through hell –” Sam wished she meant that metaphorically, “But Dean said you lost your soul. And that’s …” she bit her lip and Sam realized she was on the verge of tears, “that’s my fault, isn’t it?”
Castiel smiled wryly at Sam’s gross understatement, “No, it was not …
should have been able to tell, to feel that something was off.
The cosmic entity had tried to discourage him, had tried to remind him of his failures but … it hadn’t worked. Maybe it had to do with the hope the Nephilim had given him, or maybe dying had somehow cleared his head but, he didn’t feel as weighed down by his failures as he previously had. It was true, he had disappointed Dean – and Sam, and himself – many times. But he kept on living. He knew he couldn’t erase the bad things he’d done – where he had come from – but the future, where he was going … certainly that was more important than anything that lay behind him.
“I had
she got mixed up with us,” he was tired of always looking for the explanation, the things they told themselves to feel better, to move on, “and then she came to us for help, but we couldn’t do anything. So, y’know, I kinda feel like it was on us.”
The Winchesters finished cleaning up the bunker, although Sam thought it would still smell like blood for days. All three of them sat down, cracking open some well-earned beer.
“You said
him, Sammy. I don’t –” he took another shuttering breath, fighting the tears that came to his eyes.
“Dean,” Cas protested.
“I’m serious,” Castiel insisted, “Dean is … don’t get me wrong your brother is very brave, but he is also terrified. Why do you think I haven’t tried to approach him about this before?” Dean Winchester liked being in charge of any given situation. When that secure position got threatened, Dean threw walls up to protect himself and started shutting people out. “I don’t want him to shut me out. I won’t risk it.”
DEAN: Mm. Yeah. This.(Beer) A whole lot of this. But on a beach somewhere, you know? Can you imagine? You, me, Cass, toes in the sand, couple of them little umbrella drinks. Matching Hawaiian shirts, obviously. Some hula girls.
“Right, ok,” Dean said, walking off, “See you in the morning.”
“Yeah, I figured,” Dean said. At first it had bothered him that Cas didn’t want their help on this, but he knew Cas would call them if he found anything. He was smart enough to not take this on by himself. “Here,” he held the mixtape out, unceremoniously, “something for the road.”
He took a deep breath, “I think … I think I do love him,” he said carefully, “emotions are … complicated. I’m not sure if what I feel,
Cas: “are you alright?”
Castiel blinked and forced a smile, “Yes, I’m fine. It’s just … been a long day.”
He understood what it meant.
“Huh … interesting…” that gave Dean a lot to think about. Because … Anael was hot. Or, her vessel was hot. Not that he would ever do anything about that, he wasn’t crazy, but it was the truth.  But technically she wasn’t a woman … so was finding her attractive the same as being attracted to someone who was … not a woman? Because if Anael wasn’t really a woman, that meant Anna hadn’t been either. Although her vessel certainly had been. Did that even matter, separating the angel from the vessel? And if all angels were neither men nor women, what was the difference between him kissing one like Anna versus, for instance – “So,” he said, trying to keep a rein on his train of thought, "what about you? What … are you?”
