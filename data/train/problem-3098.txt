“Alright then, find us somewhere to stop,” Dean conceded, slapping his hand softly against the wheel, he flicked his eyes to the rearview and found Sam already scrolling through his phone. Dean would have rolled his eyes but the way Sam and Eileen were leaning into each other as they both stared at the phone screen sent warmth stretching out from his chest and even he wasn’t that cynical.
family Jack,” he stammered, eyes sliding over to Jack for just a second, “and it’s not because of all the things you’ve done for us, for everyone, it’s because we care about you,” his grip on the wheel tightened, he was suddenly reminded of a different but oddly similar declaration he’d made, he had to force the rest of the words out. “
“No, I’m not dying,” Jack shook his head and smiled softly, “I’m just mortal now, like you.”
’, though Dean didn’t know what he deserved to know whether he had it.
“Several times actually,” Dean said, trying to lighten the mood, so many things had tried to kill him and Billie hadn’t even tried particularly hard. But then again, he knew exactly what Cas was talking about and he could only imagine what feelings that memory had brought up. He wasn’t ready to talk about that now, but really, when would he ever be?
“To me, this,” Dean gestured to Cas, who was standing awkwardly by the open toolbox, “has always been you, but you used to have some form, you said that your true form was as tall as the Chrysler building, but most humans couldn’t see your true form or hear your true voice, me included,” he continued, leaving out the parts where he’d made Dean’s ears bleed and melted Pamela’s eyes right out of her face.
Castiel stumbled out of the diner, with Jack close by, hanging beside his left elbow in case something happened. The sun beat down against the dirt parking lot. A breeze whipped around them, pulled on his shirt, made his hoodie flap like a cape and twisted through his already messy hair. As soon as Jack unlocked the car, Castiel slipped into the front seat, sighing against the warm dark leather. He left the door open and the breeze slipped in, ghosting over his skin.
“Oh, okay, okay, I’ll, I – I’ll be there soon, Cas, okay?” Dean stammered, the scrape of wood on wood tore into Castiel’s ear through the phone.
“How does it make sense Sammy?”
“Cas, it’s dangerous,” Sam said, firm.
He flicked through the pages of the slim book, though he already knew it from cover to cover, thanks to the aforementioned pop culture knowledge. His eyes landed on a thick paragraph that stood out from the rest of the page. It mentioned something about being in a car, repressed feelings and a love that felt like a crime.
“And I’m telling you that, though I really appreciate it, I’m not worth it,” Dean said, and there was something about it that felt familiar, it felt like a conversation, more like argument, they’d had before.
In a matter of moments, two hands were fisted in the front of his trench coat, and Castiel was pulled into a crushing kiss. He supposed it might have hurt had he not been an angel. Dean was warm and alive against him, the animalistic smell of sweat, blood and something that Castiel could only describe as ‘
“Dude, when she died, Reagan was president,” Dean returned, voice flat and serious as he stared hard out the windshield. Castiel didn’t understand why it mattered who had been president when Mary had died.
“Yes,” the nurse murmured as she looked up from the chart and stared at him with what was obviously growing concern. “You’re name is James Novak, we found your identification in your wallet,” she went on, rounding the bed in a few short strides, and dug through the drawer beside the bed and pulled out a wallet. Carefully, she handed it to him.
“I don’t understand,” Cas replied eventually.
“I believe that it might have, several years ago, but now, it seems that the rules have been irrevocably broken,” Castiel said. When he had fallen it was because he was losing his faith in his father or at the very least questioning it. Given the circumstances, Castiel still felt that it was only natural to question his faith in that moment, but he still looked back in shame that he had wavered, even given what he knew now. There were other angels who had done far worse and had kept their grace and hadn’t fallen. Even when Castiel had turned his back on his friends and played at being God, a blasphemy that he still cringed at the thought of, an act he was still working to redeem himself from, he did not lose his grace or so much as stumble.
Dean had barely pulled up to the curb when Sam barrelled out of the car like an overexcited Saint Bernard and wrapped his arms around Eileen. He lifted her clean off the sidewalk. And by the time Dean and Jack made their way over to the bus stop, Sam had set her back down, and they were staring at each other like a couple of lovesick teenagers. The sight of it filled Dean with such warmth that he might never feel the cold again. Yeah, it was fucking fantastic to see his brother happy again.
Dampness clung to the tarmac and left the passing fields in a state of drab freshness. The rain had stopped, but Castiel could still taste it in the air that came in through the rolled down window. Familiar music blared from the car speakers, Sam and Dean were arguing about the appropriate level of volume, this was an argument that Castiel had witnessed many times before.
“Stay.” The word escaped his mouth, unbidden, like a runaway.
“Like when I killed the reaper?”
At least he could get one thing right, he thought to himself as he made his way back to the car. His phone began to vibrate in the pocket of his jeans and he stopped at Baby’s side to palm it free.
“No, I’m not am I?” Dean said with a sigh, but Castiel could see the corner of his mouth twitching upward.
“I can’t wait to get home and finally sleep on a decent mattress,” Sam said, stretching his long limbs, “feels like we’ve been on the road for a month instead of a week,” he added, and turned to sign for Eileen. She nodded, tried and failed to suppress a yawn, and Dean smiled as he watched an errant tear trail down her cheek.
Jimmy, which didn’t feel right either, wondered about this Dean. Taina, the nurse, had said that Dean was family but he hadn’t specified his specific relation to him. Was Dean a brother, a cousin, simply someone he knew well enough to be considered family? He felt like he was missing something. The more he thought about it, the more familiar Dean seemed, or at least the name did.
He silently murmured the name to himself,
It was dumb and irritating. And it was downright wrong. Dean did his best not to think about it and shoved it deep down inside himself, if he was good at one thing then that thing was repressing his feelings and not thinking about things. At least he should have been, since he’d been doing it all his life.
There was nothing more than another night and Nebraska between them and the bunker, between Dean and his memory foam. It had taken them the best part of a week to get to Cas and make their way back to Lebanon. Of course it wouldn’t have taken so long if they didn’t stop so much, but Cas needed the rest and really, so did Dean.
“Yeah, let me just pretend that I know what that reference is,” Claire replied with a roll of her eyes.
“They think of you as pets,” Cas said, sneering as he worked the words out of his mouth.
Castiel watched Jack as he left the room, smile spread wide across his face, eyes wet. And then it was just him and Dean. They looked at each other for a long moment, sky blue on marsh green, and Castiel got the feeling that this was more than an often occurrence.
Dean looked up and saw a swath of sandy hair splayed out against the dirt. That was all he needed to see before he was scrambling out of the car himself, almost eating dirt when he caught his foot between the seat and the floor, and all the while both he and Sam were calling for Jack. The boy groaned as he rose onto his hands and knees. That pristine white jacket was scuffed and smeared with dirt, his face was a little scratched up, and his hair was mussed and fell messily over his face.
“Hey sweetheart, it looks like you’re whole family’s come through,” she chimed, “you ready for some visitors?” And when he nodded she pushed the door open wide.
“You alright there bud?” Dean asked, thinly veiled concern undermined the bravado in his voice.
“I don’t really have one, it’s just something I noticed,” Sam said with a shrug, and took a sip of his water.
“Wanna help me do a once over on Baby?” Dean asked, voice catching awkwardly in his throat, he coughed into his fist to cover it.
“I said I would,” Cas returned mildly.
“You’re a lot more patient with him on that front than you are with anything,” Sam said, drumming his fingers against the tabletop, “you really have very little patience in general, but when it comes to Dean, well he’s kind of the exception to everything with you.”
“Thanks Cas,” he murmured, smiling up at the angel.
“I do not have favourites,” Castiel muttered, it was an obvious lie, but something about the conversation was beginning to make him uncomfortable.
“I’m very happy to have you back,” Jack murmured, “I missed you, very much,” the emotion in his voice was too much to handle, leaking over everything like an overfilled cup.
“We feel the same Jack,” Sam said, voice wavering as he held onto Jack’s shoulder.
Cas,” Sam said, smiling again. “And hey Cas, you’re already family, and you can heal me, which is a great plus,” he added, hand curled around Castiel’s shoulder, “but if you hurt my brother, you know I know how to kill an angel right?” Sam was still smiling, and Castiel was proud of himself for realising that Sam was joking.
“What exactly is our relation to each other?”
Castiel closed his eyes and tried to imagine the sensation of home.
When he caught up with himself, Dean was stood by Baby’s side with the streetlights bouncing off of her shiny finish. His breathing was shallow and loud as he stared across the parking lot. Cas didn’t remember him. Cas didn’t remember anything, he didn’t know anything about the things they’d been through, and Dean was beginning to wonder how a couple millennia of angelic memories were going to fit into a human mind.
The drive back to the bunker was hot and dry. Castiel liked the sound of the asphalt flying under the wheels of the Impala, and it was loud and wild, with a hint of danger. It reminded Castiel of Dean.
“Uh, Dean got a call, and Cas, he’s alive and he’s in a hospital in Washington, he was hit by a car,” Sam said, words stilted as he did his best to sign along.
“I must return to heaven,” he announced.
“Yeah, I wanna talk,” Dean returned, slowly making his way around the car’s sleek body.
Not a single person had so much as looked at them suspiciously and they made it out into the parking lot without incident. The sight of the car, it reminded him of a panther, sleek black and powerful, filled Cas with a sense of homecoming. Dean forced him into the passenger seat, saying that he would have more room in the front.
Thanks for reading <3
“Sam is right,” Cas said, the rough quality of his voice gave the statement unwarranted gravitas. Sam smirked at Dean. “These writings speak of the sanctity of the covenant. I believe they’re a protection spell.”
“So we’re looking for a needle in a haystack with Bette Midler hanging around waiting to Thackery Binx our asses?” Dean said, frustration rising as he stared back at Sam.
“It’s seems that she has tied her soul to this location,” Cas explained from across the room, eyes still on the text carved into the walls, “though I could attempt to smite her, she may still return.”
Though he wasn’t entirely sure why, Castiel felt singed by the book and dropped it back down onto the table, he supposed that the boy must have felt something similar. Almost everything Castiel had ever felt or done on his own felt like a crime.
“You and your brother owe me nothing, but your help is greatly appreciated,” Castiel said, returning Sam’s smile, and left.
“You’ve been a great help Sam,” Castiel replied. The earnest eagerness to help others and accommodate their needs was always a welcome sight, and somewhere along the way, Sam had learnt to be more wary of that behaviour but he’d still go out of his way for those he cared for. It was heartening to know that Castiel was counted among them. “Thank you.”
“I did most of it simultaneously, though I think I could have shaved several seconds off, but I’ve never done it before,” Jack said with a shrug, face slightly scrunched up, as though he were disappointed in himself.
“Wait?” Sam said, brows furrowed and the wrinkle in his forehead became quite pronounced. “Wouldn’t being in love cause you to fall?”
“Amnesia?” Jack asked, head tilted in that way that made Dean’s chest ache, like father like adopted son Dean supposed.
“He literally killed Death, the Death,” Dean shot back, weakly trying to defend himself.
“Sure, whatever, just get back here,” Sam said.
‘Cool Girl’ for me or whatever,” Dean rambled, completely losing Castiel and he was too tired to even try to thread it together, it was the first time in their conversation that Dean truly sounded drunk.
Previously, he never would have thought that thinking could be so tumultuous, and it was no wonder Dean had often looked pained by his thoughts. Castiel had learnt to deal with the frustration of looking inward to find not just unsatisfactory answers but no answers but it was still a difficult task.
“Are you referring to movies?” Castiel asked and furrowed his brow.
“No, it’s not the same,” Dean said, shaking his head, he set his elbows on the table. “Sammy’s misfortunes with love, besides that one demon, they’re mostly not his fault,” he went on, head tilted forward and his hands open slightly, as though it should be obvious.
“Hex-bag?” Sam suggested rubbing at his throat.
“So Claire lives with Jody,” Castiel said, trying to straighten out the facts from Dean’s jumbled statement.
Sam nodded and shifted slight, boots kicking up dirt as he did.
Maybe he’d get his Cas back, or maybe Cas would change his mind once he’d got all of his memories back, or maybe he would be different even with them. Dean would still try though. It just wasn’t in him to quit on Cas, he’d tried it once and it hadn’t taken, and with this possibly being their last chance there was no stopping him. With his teeth gritted and hands white knuckle tight around the steering wheel, he drove with apprehensive determination. He owed Cas so damn much, the least he could do was try.
That sounded ominous.
“Yeah,” Same said in that snippy way of his. Then his eyes fell on the angel sitting opposite Dean. “Oh, hey Cas,” he said, and dumped his messenger bag on the table.
You can catch me on tumblr @ theweakestthing and twitter @ th_weakestthing
The fluttery rustling of something that sounded both like feathers and clothes came while Dean chewed on his mouthful of double cheese burger. He barely startled when Cas sat across from him at the small table in their motel room.
With Cas sat in the backseat, they drove out to what was left of the Mary Clark’s home. Pulled up on the side of the road, Dean went straight for the trunk while Cas and Sam discussed the creepy writing, he was more preoccupied with not letting the damn ghost get the drop on him again than talking about crap he’d never understand anyway.
“She knows anyway, everyone knows, okay?” Sam said, finally, a little exasperated. He dropped his hands into his lap.
Before they could so much as step in the direction of an exist, Sam and Dean found themselves outside, stood beside the Impala watching the house burn for a second time.
“Alright buddy,” Dean said, smacked his hand down on the thick plastic railing, and left the room.
lore’.
“So was taking me from the hospital, but you did that didn’t you?” Castiel said, opening his eyes to glare across the table at Sam, jaw set.
In the grand scheme of things, Dean was nothing but a blip in the vast expanse of Cas’ life, the angel had been alive for nearly all of time. And despite how much Dean told everyone he was proud of it, he felt guilty about tempting an angel to fall from grace, and teaching him about free will. It would probably do Cas some good to forget about them.
He was sick of flicking through the channels of never ending reruns only to find that he recognised more than half the shows. And he even knew the jingles to an alarming quantity of the commercials too. Apparently, he spent an inordinate amount of time watching television and he was going to have a lot to say about that to Dean when he finally got there.
“I suppose there’s a reason behind the nickname,” Cas said, it didn’t seem to be the time to get into it, and besides he felt more connected to the name than he did
“Hey, you’re supposed to be on my side,” Dean said, eyeing Castiel again through the rear view mirror, those green eyes were playfully accusing.
“Would you mind taking Jack and grabbing a booth,” Sam signed as he spoke to Eileen, “I just wanna talk to Dean for a second.” It seemed kinda difficult to speak and sign at the same time, and though Dean had picked up some of the language, he knew he could do better to accommodate her. It was another thing else on his long list of self-improvements.
Maybe it should have concerned him more, but the doctors were confident that he would be able to make a full recovery, memories and all. They said it would take time, but still they seemed very optimistic. Though, he was yet to remember a single thing.
“That’s a frustratingly long time,” Castiel murmured, he had a long road ahead of him, both figuratively and literally. He tried not to groan at the thought.
Dean pushed him backward until he was crumpled against the window frame. Hand cupped around his neck, Dean loomed over Castiel, and pressed his palm against the angel’s stubble. Slowly, Castiel reached out for Dean. He had touched the man in so many ways in the years they’d known each other, but none of those times had ever felt like this, they had never meant this much. His fingers twitched as they gripped the collar of Dean’s flannel shirt.
“What the fuck?”
“I have other things I take responsibility for,” Cas said, voice like gravel under the tires of a car, eyes finally on Dean’s.
’. Though, it felt far more fitting than Jimmy if he was being honest. It was just another thing he would have to ask Dean about when the man arrived.
“He’s in a hospital,” Sam repeated, face scrunched in confusion, “how’s he in a hospital?”
With only a few hours to go, they had pulled up at a rest stop to stretch their legs, refuel themselves and Baby, grab something easy for dinner later, that and Eileen had been threatening to relieve herself all over the backseat if Dean didn’t stop within the next five miles. That woman was going give Sam hell, and Dean was looking forward to it, he smiled to himself.
Despite the easy familiarity, it didn’t quite feel like home.
They broke apart again. Dean flipped the couch and tore at what was left of it with his knife, tearing the stuffing out, it was quickly apparent that there was nothing out of the ordinary in the couch. The coffee table was clear, as was the side table with the rotary phone on it. The rotary phone was clear too.
Dean wanted to protest, he wanted to drive straight on through to Washington and to Cas, but he knew they couldn’t do that. His egg would be completely fried by the time they got there and he needed to be on his A game if he was going to be of any help to Cas. And it was getting harder to ignore the encroaching tiredness and the aching emptiness of his stomach, Sam was right and Dean needed to stop being such a stubborn idiot.
Hearing Cas try and fail to describe his dreams about heaven and everything he’d been through before they had met was like listening to poetry about a painting he’d never seen. It was beautiful, though he didn’t understand a damn word of it. Still, it was nice that Cas was remembering things, of course he’d have preferred it if he were remembering something more recent.
“Yeah, yeah I know Jimmy, he’s family. What’s happened to him?” Dean’s heart was beating like a jackhammer against the back of his sternum, trying for a jail break.
“There is nothing in the bathroom,” Cas said, appearing beside them.
“More like an angel needed the help of his friends,” Dean returned, he just wished that Cas had done it more often.
“You’re being serious?”
“Hello Dean,” Cas said, gruff tones and all, Dean hadn’t heard the telltale flutter over the hum of his various injuries.
“We’ve stopped twice.”
“Yeah, it is,” Dean agreed, scoffing as he took a swig of water from the bottle on the nightstand, but it did nothing to help the tightness in his throat.
“I don’t remember, but I hope it’s not true,” Cas muttered, and turned his hopeful eyes to Sam, knowing he was going to be proven wrong. Apparently he was somewhat prideful.
“I suppose how I became a father figure to Claire is too complicated to get into right now?” Castiel asked, tongue pressed against the back of his teeth as he watched Dean.
“Yes Dean, it’s a promise,” Cas assured, staring right back at him.
“It can seem that way, yeah,” Dean returned, speaking around the pie, voice on the cusp of laughing.
“Which is fine because like 99.9% of the population has gotten by without the help of angel powers,” Dean said, smoothing out the gauze with the heel of his palm, there was no way in hell that he was going to let Cas feel inadequate for not being able to heal his every boo-boo or something.
“Well, why don’t you tell us what you do remember and we’ll fill in the blanks,” Sam said, with an encouraging smile. And Jack quickly took up signing for Eileen, hands and lips moving silently to fill her in, as she stood at the foot of the bed.
“Figures of speech are quite difficult,” Cas said, reassuring Jack with his easy smile, and the way Jack looked back at him, as though he’d put the stars in the sky left Dean melting. For all Dean knew, Cas just might have, or a few of them at least.
She said she’d be coming down to stay over the next weekend. Dean was both looking forward to it and dreading it. For one he didn’t know how Cas would handle seeing here, they’d hadn’t had the talk about vessels and all that mess yet. Dean knew he’d have to get that out of the way before Claire got there. And then he was vaguely worried about how she was going to react to Jack. Jody had mentioned how close Claire and Kaia were, and Dean was so damn glad they’d been able to get Kaia back because those kids deserved that kind of win for everything life had thrown at them. He just hoped that she didn’t blame Jack, or at least didn’t carry the kind of grudge Dean had been doing his best to shake off.
“Alright sir, well he’s been in a car accident and he’s suffered a head trauma and has a concussion, and he has a broken collarbone, he also appears to have amnesia,” she explained, tone soft and clear.
Chuck was nothing more than a guy with a shitty beard and sub-par writing skills. The strings had been cut and they were free, they were finally free to do whatever they wanted and to be whoever they wanted to be. And what Dean wanted most was to let go of the rage that Chuck had pressed upon him and make up for all the damage he’d done with it.
“Actually, Cas, she kinda reminded me of you,” Sam said, smiling as he started signing for Eileen, catching her up in the conversation.
“I just want to, I just want us to be real friends, and Cas, I don’t know if you noticed but I don’t have any friends, they either leave or they die,” Dean said, jaw tightening, holding back the memories of all the people he’d lost. The average person his age had maybe only lost a grandparent or two and he tried not to be resentful of that.
“The paternity results are in Pamela, the twins have different fathers,” he spoke in tandem with the television, surprising himself. “I’ve seen this show before?” he muttered, “I’ve watched this show, voluntarily, on purpose?” his brow furrowed.
Dean was yanked from his rose-tinted thoughts by his phone vibrating against his thigh. He pulled it out of his pocket and checked the caller ID, he didn’t recognise the number but he answered anyway, you never knew who could be in trouble.
“Yeah, we all call you Cas,” the tall man said, smiling easily at him.
“That,” Jack said, voice thick with emotion and Dean didn’t dare look at him, “that must have been hard to say.” The wet sniffle that followed his words made Dean’s heart pang. “But I’ve caused so much harm.”
“You must have, I heard you,” Cas said, defiantly.
It had barely been six months since he’d gotten his brother back, whole and intact if incredibly traumatised, and it was a little hard to believe that Dean could ever be so lucky. Maybe it didn’t have anything to do with him though. Maybe his brother just deserved better and the universe had decided to give Sam a break for the first time in his life. Either way, Dean wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth, he was just happy to have his brother back. And hey, it wasn’t like Sam hadn’t been traumatised before the apocalypse. Sometimes it just took him off guard just how well things had turned out, considering the alternative.
“I’m not okay,” Dean admitted with a shrug of his shoulders, because really, when were either of them ever okay? “Cas is out there on his own with a busted skull and no memories and we’re having lunch, Sam, I’m not gonna be okay until we’ve got him, but I’m handling it,” he assured. “Let’s just get something to eat, alright?”
“Well you did,” Dean returned, he reached down and gripped his ankle, sighing at the small relief it provided.
“Don’t hang up,” Castiel begged, head in his hands, he knew he wouldn’t be able to just sit there in silence waiting however long it took Dean to get back.
“See Dean,” Sam returned derisively and turned the volume down, apparently having won the argument.
“I would like to leave as soon as possible,” Cas agreed, and stared down the length of himself, toes curled under the sheets.
“Well, I haven’t been human or on Earth for very long, I doubt I am used to colloquialisms,” Cas said, as though he had to explain himself, fingers toying with the near empty packet of jerky.
“I will make an effort to be around more often,” Cas said, sliding his fingers between Dean’s, “now that things are in something of an order, I will have more free time.”
The handprint, which had once been imprinted on his shoulder, had stood as a testament to the ‘profound bond’ they shared. Cas had touched his soul and as far as Dean knew you didn’t just walk away from that without there being
“Alright,” Dean said, he clapped his hands together as he turned away from the fridge, and checked his watch before he continued, “in five hours’ time, we’ll meet back here for dinner.”
“It’s been a long ass week, and I think we all need to get some sleep, and in our own beds or the next best thing, have a shower, and just generally settle back in, five hours is good enough,” Dean explained with a shrug as Sam continued to sign for Eileen.
It wouldn’t do to start feeling like home was on the flutter of wings, a trench coat and a gruff voice, and unending misunderstandings and confusion.
“So, I should just stop trying and let happenstance bring things back?” Castiel asked, tilting his head. Sometimes the way Sam explained things irritated Castiel, he always seemed to make his points in two parts or simply forgot that Castiel didn’t know everything and couldn’t read his mind.
“Well, I guess I’m lucky that I’ve got my own personal doctor angel to help patch me up,” Dean said, wincing as he smiled up at Castiel, white teeth shining beneath the blood and grime.
“I appreciate that Dean,” Cas said, voice seeped in gratitude, he leaned forward and closed his hand around Dean’s shoulder.
They settled into the booth with the others and ordered. Dean let the chatter wash over him as he sipped at his coffee. Sam and Jack were explaining everything that had happened between everyone being wiped from Earth and her resurrection to Eileen, alternating hands animated over the table as Jack and Sam translated for each other and Dean couldn’t help but smile at Eileen’s reaction to Lucifer calling Michael a cuck (Sam had to spell the word out and that had Dean wondering if there was a sign cuck).
“Why would we have to sneak out?” Cas asked, brow furrowed as he searched Dean’s face.
do. They probably didn’t have too long until the hospital realised the insurance was fake, so they had to get Cas out of there as soon as possible. Most stores would be closed by now, but it wouldn’t hurt to cruise around and see what was open, they couldn’t sneak Cas out of there in his hospital clothes.
“Yes,” Dean said.
“I don’t know, at this point you know me better than I do, do I usually drop things?” Cas asked, squinting at Dean as he set the bottles down on the nightstand, his hands were truly shaking at that point and he folded them in his lap.
“She’ll be happy for you,” Sam assured easily, chuckling at his brother.
“It’s what love does to some people,” Dean explained, shovelling more pie into his mouth.
“Okay, okay,” Dean muttered as he ran a hand through his hair, trying to think, “we’ll be there in a few days, we’re coming all the way from Arkansas ya see,” his vision was swimming, he sniffed and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand.
It was the first memory he’d reclaimed and it was frustrating that it was something so inane. There wasn’t anything about it that told him much of anything about himself. Though, he did wonder if the man that had been beside him was Dean, but he supposed he’d find that out soon enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve been dead three times,” Jack said and signed, like he was proud, and the sound of it twisted Dean’s gut into knots. Though, hopefully, he might have just been hungry. Eileen chuckled and hugged the kid.
“Sounds like you,” Dean said, scoffing as he smiled, it sounded exactly like Cas.
“Huh?” Dean muttered blearily, peering up at Castiel, who was still sat on the edge of his bed.
With Sam and Eileen out on a job or a date, Dean didn’t know which and figured that by now the lines were kinda blurred in that department, Jack was deeply engrossed in the Hunger Games books Sam had got him and Claire’s visit was two days away, Dean thought that it was about time that they got one of the bigger issues out of the way.
“I think he panicked?” Sam said, smiling as he squinted into his coffee.
Dean nodded and patted Castiel’s shoulder before moving forward, Castiel missed the contact instantly. He followed Dean back toward Sam.
“You’re welcome,” Sam said, smiling a little wider, “and you can talk to me anytime, you know that right? We still owe you for, well, everything,” he went on, fiddling with his fork as his eyes cut down toward the half eaten salad.
He addressed Clare gently. ‘I cannot give her more time. She will die at her appointed hour. But there will be no pain. No confusion.’
Castiel forced himself to abandon that train of thought and concentrate. He needed to find a way to exist on this mortal plane. He needed to arm himself. He could still fight for heaven, even without his angelic strength. An echoing rumble caught his attention and he leapt upright, bracing himself for any form of attack. A second rumble followed the first and he recognised the sound, and the sensation. Castiel slumped, feeling a little sheepish. He was hungry. The thought was actually cheering. This was a mortal weakness he could deal with. He had seen this done enough times. Food. That was all he needed.
‘Look, it’s fine. Don’t make a big issue.’ Dean couldn’t keep his voice entirely under control, and he mentally kicked himself. He waited for Castiel to change the subject, or disappear without warning. To do any of the things Dean was used to. But he didn’t. Even without lifting his eyes from the floor, Dean knew that Castiel was still watching him, could sense that his expression hadn’t changed.
, that’s right: you just freakin’ disappeared and left us to it.’
. ‘You couldn’t let me have one night, could you? Not one
‘Castiel, you have never been without your grace. You have ever known the presence of heaven.’ Anna weighted her words as much as she could. There must be no misunderstanding. ‘Can you imagine what it would be like without it?’
Dean believed in what you could touch, what you could see, and what you could kill. But that physical scar: the angel’s hand on his shoulder – the brand of the saved - was barely noticeable next to the sensation it had accompanied: the emotion that had seared into his imprisoned soul and liberated it from its self-imposed hell of guilt and terror. When he thought about it – which was as little as possible, yet somehow constantly – Dean suspected that the physical removal of his body from hell had been only part of his rescue by the presence that haunted his dreams. Somehow, that presence had managed in a matter of - what? minutes? hours? days?- to heal the effects of forty years of hell to the extent that Dean was able to once again function in the human world. Sometimes Dean thought perhaps he could ask about that. But he had no idea how to even start framing the question.
‘Dean.’
‘According to my sources, he’s not far. There’s a nest of demons two miles out of town. Rumour has it that a fetching accountant-type came afoul of some hunting demons last night and got taken. ’ Ruby looked at Dean’s suddenly ashen face, and continued with a little more sympathy in her voice. ‘It’s not as bad as it sounds.’
‘I’ve no doubt, but that isn’t what I meant.’
‘You’ll get no argument here.’
The sound of her own name, spoken aloud in her otherwise empty apartment in the middle of the night, should have filled her with panic. Instead she merely looked around, blinking, for the source of the sound. A man was standing at the foot of her mother’s bed. She squinted at him in confusion.
‘Okaaay. What gives? What’s going on? Has Lilleth found a mechanical seal?’
Tears were starting to form again at the corners of Clare’s eyes. She looked up at him in wonder.
Castiel’s focus had been beginning to drift, but this brought his gaze back to Dean’s. ‘I am sorry. It was never my intention to abandon you. I have been foolish.’
. Listen -
‘Aw, really? Only a little?’ Dean swung himself out of bed. ‘I’m clearly not trying hard enough.’
‘You prayed. For me.’ He looked up again, and the expression on his face was one Dean had never seen there before: gratitude, and a deep affection. Dean felt his breath catch, and found himself unable to speak.
‘Uh….hi, Cas.’
‘Hi Cas.’ Dean wiped his hands on a rag, and prepared to lower the hood of the Impala. ‘Okay. Where do you want us?’
‘Listen to me.’ Anna moved to stand directly before him, ensuring she had his entire focus. ‘What you are suggesting is dangerous, not to mention reckless. Without your grace, you would be as vulnerable as any mortal. We need you now. This is a risk we cannot afford to take.’
, a treacherous part of his mind replied.
‘You didn’t answer my question.’
Dean’s throat constricted, preventing him from replying. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he was aware that his cheeks were wet.
‘I’m afraid there’s been a change of plan.’ Uriel moved towards him and Castiel suddenly became aware of how they must feel to humans. They looked mortal, but the sense of contained power was palpable. That emotion he had been struggling to identify earlier came into sharp focus. Fear.
‘Dean.’
Perhaps he was simply spending too much time with the Winchesters. Not that he had a choice. This was his assignment and he would stick with it, come –literally- hell or high water. But he had not been prepared for what this proximity to these humans, or one particular human, would do to his unswerving sense of righteousness, of loyalty and of justice. Castiel, to his abiding discomfort, had started to doubt. He had begun to question whether, distant as they were from the day-to-day concerns of these humans, they could truly know what was best for them.
‘Just go,’ she said, quietly.
For a moment, Dean stared. The amused expression that Castiel was failing to hide took him by surprise. Then he started to laugh.
‘Dean.’ Sam threw him a genuinely irritated glare.
‘Jesus, Cas, you couldn’t knock? Wear a bell or something? Changing here.’ Dean did his best to conceal the surge of emotion that had greeted his sense of Castiel’s presence.
Castiel blinked. ‘I’m sorry?’
‘Hey, don’t worry about it. That was pretty lame, to be honest. You should see me and Sam go at it.’ Dean managed a halfhearted grin. ‘So. What’s the big demon beef this time?’
‘Did you really think I wouldn’t find out about this? That the others wouldn’t find out?’ Uriel was close now, and angry. ‘Do you have any idea how selfish this is? How reckless? You have endangered our entire effort, and for what? To play with the humans, the monkeys, at their level? Are you insane?’
‘Real enough for you?’ That smile was still playing around Castiel’s lips. ‘Perhaps you should break out the holy water. Just to be certain.’
It had been three months since he had last seen Castiel. Initially, Dean had been glad not to see him: after all, his visits hardly heralded puppies and ponies and trips to the ice cream shop. And a lack of angels made it easier to pretend that things were normal, that everything was back the way it had been two years earlier, before Sam’s death, before Dean’s deal. But now, as the weeks passed, Dean found himself looking out for that face, that dumb trench coat, the physical presence of Castiel’s vessel, and that shimmering, contained power, like the air before a storm, that heralded Castiel himself.
‘Uriel,’ Castiel started to speak. The air in the room started to shimmer. Uriel was leaving. Was abandoning him here. ‘No, w
Almost a month had passed since that day. They had moved on, buried the body. Sam and Ruby had scared up another demon hunt almost immediately. If Dean had been remotely interested in analysing their motivation, he would have thought they were trying to distract him from something. It wasn't working. Dean sat on the bed, staring at the muted television.
‘I am sorry; I…had forgotten that payment is required. I have no money.’
‘But I have no money,’ he repeated, with a frown of confusion that just made him look even more hopelessly lost.
‘Which angel? Do you mean Castiel?’ This from Sam.
Castiel met his gaze, and Dean saw fear there, a sight somehow worse than the wound itself.
Clare looked at him, her shoulders sagging. She really didn’t need this right now. The next few minutes played out in her mind. Joe’s aggression, his anger that would be taken out, first on this idiot, and then on her. Not that it was her problem. It was the end of her shift anyway, she could just tell Joe and leave. Leave this guy to bear the brunt of it. Who the hell forgets that meals need to be paid for, anyway? He was high on something, most likely.
The expression on Uriel’s face brought him up short. He was toweringly angry, yes, frustrated, impatient, and…something else. Something that had stopped him killing Dean on the spot. Confused? Wary? Surprised? Whatever it was, it had saved Dean’s life.
‘Trench coat. Suit. As if. I ask you. Is upstairs hiring plain clothes cops these days? Has Columbo joined the ranks of the seraphim? They must be desperate.’
Sam, who had been about to take his first bite of a sandwich when Castiel shimmered into being, stopped in mid gesture, hand frozen in the air, to stare in disbelief. Nevertheless, he was the first to break the silence.
‘You’re - passing the time.’ Dean repeated, dumbly.
‘Don’t you dare speak to me.’ This was spat at him. Uriel was angrier, more ferocious, than Castiel had ever seen him. ‘You betrayed us. I am here to see you get your just reward. You wanted to live with the humans? Well, you can. For the rest of your pathetically short human existence. Congratulations,
‘Just watch yourself, that’s all. Don’t let him be too influenced by them. You think demons are bad? At least you know where you are with them. At least they don’t pretend to be holier than thou and full of the love of God and shit.’ Catching Sam’s expression, she sighed. ‘Just keep an eye on him, okay? You think betrayal by a demon is bad? Imagine betrayal by an angel. Lucifer was one of them once.’
‘She is not coming.’
Dean glared as Ruby entered. ‘Oh hi, just in time to join the search, I see. Thanks for all your help today, by the way. Oh
‘Then, and I don’t mean to be rude or anything here, Cas,’ Dean rubbed a hand awkwardly through his hair, ‘but what are you doing here?’
‘Uriel.
Castiel looked at the rag, the engine, and back at Dean. ‘This is somewhat inefficient.’
It had not hurt. Not physically anyway. The emotional sensation, on the other hand, had been crippling. It was like someone had reached into his chest, and mind, and removed all sense of security and love. All sense of connection, and brotherhood.
Those incredible eyes met his for a final time, suddenly unafraid.
'Where is Castiel?'
‘We will continue this conversation at a later date.’ It was unmistakably a threat. ‘In the meantime, and for all the good it will do you,’ Uriel crossed to Sam, flicked through the town plan, and pointed to a page, ‘I left him here.’
At her gentle tone, he raised his head. Clear blue eyes met hers and her hard won cynicism took a beating. No junkie she’d ever seen had looked like that. She couldn’t sic Joe on this guy. It would be like kicking a puppy. She’d never seen anyone look so completely together, and yet so utterly lost. Dislocated, somehow, as if he’d wandered in from another life. A better life, where diner food was free, and people never got angry.
Dean opened his mouth. There was a joke here. Something about the competition not being steep, or - but he couldn't hear it over the beating of his heart. Couldn't force it past the sudden constriction in his throat. All that came was, 'I thought - you were dead.'
Sam felt as if he had crossed into some weird parallel universe. One in which Dean went around hugging people, and sharing his food.
Dean’s lack of reply seemed to satisfy her, and she continued. ‘But as it happens, and because I’m such a sucker for hard luck cases’ she threw them both a glance ‘I did manage to get a lead on your missing heaven-spawn.’
Dean felt his control start to slip, and he wanted to run. To shove Castiel away and sprint for the door. But he couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Anything now might break him.
Castiel watched as the Winchester brothers salted the grave of the demon sent by Lileth to retrieve this seal. The fight had been long, and hard, but they had been victorious. He had just spoken with them: to acknowledge their victory, and to inform them that they had been mistaken – that this fight had actually been a decoy, a way for Lileth to keep them at bay whilst she went after her real target. This had not gone down well. Castiel had listened to, and acknowledged their anger, then left to return to his brethren. At least, that had been the plan. Instead he was still here, some little distance away, unseen and unnoticed by either of the brothers.
Nearly a month later, the Winchesters were taking a well-earned lunch break in their usual travel choice of seedy motel, when the air began to shimmer. Dean felt a part of himself tense, and wait for the inevitable influx of shame or embarrassment. After all, the last time he had seen Castiel, he had cried on the angel’s shoulder like a child. But, to his surprise, there was nothing. No embarrassment, no shame; no compunction to greet Castiel’s arrival with anything other than genuine pleasure. Before his conscious mind was even aware he had moved, Dean walked over and embraced Castiel, holding the angel tight. Surprise and pleasure warred for dominance in Castiel’s expression, but his response – to raise his arms and hug back, just as tight, was immediate.
‘What is she doing here?’ Dean Winchester was not, in general, a morning person, and the likelihood of his happy-go-lucky, days-of -wine-and-roses cheery side being to the fore was diminished exponentially when his first sight upon waking was Ruby at the door of their motel room.
‘Clare Barran’
Uriel spat it like a curse, inches from Dean’s face once more. ‘
‘Leave me be.’ The demon had his hand around Castiel's neck, blade to his throat. He growled. ‘Leave me be or I will kill him.’
He knew it was pointless, but he called anyway. ‘Anna.’
. Mentally he willed Castiel to disappear. To bring up Lilleth. To declare the earth to be in immediate mortal peril. To do anything but continue to stand there, looking at him.
Which had led said Winchesters to their current situation. Attempting, once more, to summon an angel. Admittedly, Dean’s method this time was a little less sophisticated than Bobby’s original spectacular summoning symbols and traps which he had optimistically assumed would hold Castiel, before they had discovered his true nature.
He shot to his feet and stared around. The familiar sense of controlled power, of infinite grace, and that light, coalesced into the figure of a man. The air seemed to settle and the shadow of the wings folded to meet the seemingly normal shadow of the man.
And it wasn’t humiliating. Or weakness. It was simply what needed to be.
Sam stared at him. ‘Dean, she’s trying to help.’
'I was. Briefly. Then, heaven heard - you.’
Ruby had laughed along, and then as soon as possible, got out to find the Winchesters.
Dean took a shaky breath. ‘Look, I…’
Serious blue eyes met his. ‘I trust you, Dean.’ The intense expression softened with one of those rare half smiles. ‘I am sure this car maintenance experience will come in useful one day.’
‘You’re going to be fine.’ Dean gripped Castiel’s hand, holding on so tight he could feel the weakening pulse. Desperation and creeping despair fuelled his next words. ‘Just hang on Cas. Just hold on. Please. Look, I…I need you, okay?’
As he watched the brothers trudge, separate, unspeaking, back to the car, Castiel felt a long-absent certainty settle on him. He knew what he would do, and whom he would ask to help.
‘Look,’ she began.
‘Well it’s not like you just pop in to say hi, is it? Pass the time of day? Enquire after our health? Which is fine, by the way,’ Dean waved the demon covered shirt in front of Castiel before pitching it into the corner, ‘hard-ass homicidal demons notwithstanding.’
He had never understood the isolation. They were not connected. They felt apart, all the time. There was no sense of other in their minds. No expansion of self. And worst of all, no grace. No God. It was horrible. And yet, even in the shock of this separation, there was still an echo. Maybe, Castiel considered, it is because I know what it feels like. I know what I am looking for. It was faint now, a shimmering horizon, rather than a radiant dawn. But it was there, that connection, that sense of the divine. Castiel found he had to concentrate hard to feel it, but it was there. Although it was easier simply to see it, to feel it, in another.
He walked to her side. Gently he reached down and touched her mother’s forehead. Immediately her mother relaxed, her breathing becoming regular, her sleep deepening. The hollows in her cheeks seemed to fill out, and her pallor became more natural, closer to Clare’s own.
. She did start to cry then, tears running down her cheeks and pooling on the thin bedclothes.
‘Dean?’ Sam tried again. ‘We need to go.’
‘And I do not long for it now. Anael, I have no desire to be human.’ Castiel turned away, and watched for a moment as people walked by, busy with their lives: anxious, happy, fearful, laughing people. ‘And I will never want to be other than in the host of our Father. But I must do this. For my own peace of mind, I must do this. It need only be mere moments. But I must know.’
He had heard those words many times since, and felt that touch, in dream after dream. Those were the better dreams – the ones that ended in relief, in rescue, in the presence of an angel. He knew, in his heart, that he would never be free of the
‘Dean?’ Without looking Dean correctly guessed that the only change in Castiel’s posture had been a slight head tilt to one side. Irrationally, Dean felt a flare of anger.
Sam stared at his brother. The atmosphere in the room was so tightly balanced he could barely breathe.
Part of his mind was terrified of Castiel. Terrified of the threat he represented to Sam, to Dean himself, and to the world. Uriel, Dean was certain, was dangerous. And yet, however angry his words, however suspicious he was of the angel’s motives: it was always there, lurking disturbingly beneath his conscious awareness: that sense of connection. That link with Castiel. He wondered if Castiel felt anything similar, or if pulling mortals from hell was an everyday occurrence that didn’t even register. He wondered if the angels were even capable of feeling as mortals did.
‘Pass the time of day, as you put it. Understand: we are fighting a war for our very existence, and that of humanity. However, if you feel my time would be better spent here, then obviously I will leave the front lines to come and hold your hand.’
Dean frowned. ‘Question?’
‘You helped me when I was in need.’
Clare woke to the sound of moaning from the next room: a quiet, ineffably sad keening that rose and fell. She was up and moving towards the door before she was even fully conscious.
‘My apologies. I…we…the war does not go well. But that is not, as you rightly point out, a reason to be…pissy.’
That smile was back. ‘I do not require food.’
Before Sam could formulate a reply the sound of the Impala’s engine gunning to life sent them racing towards the car. Dean barely waited for them to slam the doors before flattening his foot to the floor. As they screeched out of the parking lot, he side-eyed his brother.
. Clare stood at the counter, indecisive for a moment, and then quickly followed him out of the door.
She hardened her stance, ready to announce that she would be informing her supervisor. He had lowered his gaze and was now looking at the table, but his attention was inward – he looked like he was berating himself for something. She knew that look. She saw it in the mirror every morning. She felt her resolve weaken.
He wondered what Sam saw in Castiel’s presence, what Sam felt. But that was another question that Dean could never bring himself to ask. It would lead Sam to ask too many questions, and it wasn’t a discussion he could handle right now. He had no idea where to begin to describe feelings that he wasn’t even comfortable acknowledging to himself: that sense of connection, of relief, of safety: of being home in the presence of another. There was nothing in Dean’s experience that even came close.
, she thought.
And then Castiel did move. He stepped in front of Dean and gripped him gently by the shoulders, his right hand covering its matching scar in a gesture so unexpectedly intimate and familiar that Dean felt his throat constrict.
Dean entered the motel room, slammed the door, and threw himself exhausted onto the nearest bed. Sammy had gone for supplies, although where he got the energy from Dean didn’t know. That demon had been a bastard to put down. It seemed to be getting harder. God, he hoped he wasn’t getting old. Belatedly, he remembered that he had managed to get, amongst other unsavoury items, some demon blood on his shirt. Wearily, he righted himself, and started to strip. Which was when the air began to shimmer.
Dean recovered fast. ‘And yet, here you are.’
‘I see.’ Castiel stared intently at the offending engine, and raised a hand. Dean felt the shimmer in the air intensify, a sensation that signalled a build up of angelic power.
‘You know I could kill you. You know I could send you back to hell.’
‘How do we know this isn’t a trap?’ Dean’s voice was tight, and cold.
‘You needn’t concern yourselves. I removed all information from his mind that might potentially threaten us or our victory.’
The familiar feeling of shimmering air surrounded the car. Dean, leaning over the engine, almost banged his head on the bonnet in an effort to be upright.
‘What?’
Anna thought bitterly.
‘I don’t know heaven, Cas. I don’t know God. But I know you. Any place, any Father, that sends you to this world would never leave you here. You belong there. I am certain of that.’
‘It’s just a rumour. I’m not sure of anything yet.’
Castiel spun around. His mortal senses had given him no clue that there was anyone behind him. Uriel was leaning against a concrete column, watching him with distaste.
Castiel dropped his gaze. The air in the room shimmered, and for a moment Dean wondered if, not for the first time, he had pushed his luck too far. Certainly that sentiment voiced to Uriel would have earned him a smiting. Then Castiel met Dean’s eyes and a rare, if small, smile broke across his face.
Ruby strode into the room, past a clearly anxious Sam. ‘Look, don’t start, okay, sport? I’m trying to be of assistance. Again. Some more. And frankly the attitude is starting to wear a little thin.’
‘Great.’ Sam sounded positively enthused. ‘Get in, take ‘em down, pull Cas out. Nothing we haven’t done before, right?’ This to Dean, who was staring at Ruby.
Sam looked from one to the other, thinking fast. How long Uriel would be checked without Castiel’s calming influence was anyone’s guess. Uriel moved around Dean, examining him like a laboratory specimen that had produced an unexpected result under duress.
‘Whoa.’ Dean, wide-awake now, vaulted the bed to put himself between Ruby and the door. ‘Back up a second.’
Clare bristled, suddenly feeling as if she should defend her quiet customer. It was on the tip of her tongue to point out that as the place was half empty, they didn’t, in fact, need the booth, and he was a paying customer, so he could sit as long as he liked. But she wasn’t stupid, or suicidal, and she badly needed the job. Instead she said ‘Sure. No problem, boss.’ And walked across to the booth.
‘Uriel…’ Castiel tried to break into the unwavering force of hostility from his former comrade.
Dean, aware of Castiel’s gaze, broke off the opposite end of his sandwich. ‘Want to share?’
‘That’s okay. It’s fine. Honestly. You can keep the money.’ She was finding it hard to take her eyes off him. There was just something about him – the way the air in the room seemed to grow stiller in his presence.
But something in his demeanour was just…wrong. He might look like a stockbroker, or an accountant, but only if that guy had just lost his job and had his wife walk out on him, all in the same day. He seemed to radiate loneliness, and a kind of profound despair that, in spite of her own problems, made her want to walk over and take his hand. Tell him that everything would be all right.  Something else was weird too: something wasn’t quite right about his age. He looked young, sure, but there had been a depth in the look that had met hers that belonged to a person much, much older. Almost a kind of agelessness, even.
‘Hey, I never claimed to be angel boy’s biggest fan. And in case you didn’t notice the antipathy is mutual. I can’t imagine him busting a gut to help me, can you?’
Dean stared ‘What?’
And his order. Who ordered pie, and then, twenty minutes later ‘More pie, please’? Especially when he’d devoured the first piece like a man who hadn’t eaten all day. He was, in his quiet way, one of the strangest customers she’d ever seen.
‘I would be careful.’
‘Yeah,’ Dean added, ‘And how come you didn’t share?’
Dean stared at the figure in front of him. ‘What the hell happened to you? They give you a sense of humour when you got your angelic mojo back?’
He looked down at Clare and said simply, ‘I am an angel of the Lord.’
‘I do not answer to any….mortal. And especially not to one such as you.’ The icy voice from behind them made both brothers start. They turned.
That was when he felt it. A beating of the air. The shadow of unseen wings that spanned the room. Dean remembered the first time he had seen Castiel. That unremarkable barn. That same shadow.
‘Me and Sam. You’d better tell me – Sam’s with Bobby, I’ll have to call him, get him over here, finish up with the car.’ Dean was talking quickly as he put the Impala’s engine back into working order. ‘Look, maybe it would be better if Sam met me there.’ Suddenly aware of Castiel’s unresponsiveness, Dean looked up, to see the angel regarding him with that rare almost-smile.
‘When did you eat pie?’ Sam stared, openly curious.
The Impala screeched to a halt outside one of the seedier looking shops in the immediate vicinity. Sam and Dean stared out of the windscreen at their less than salubrious surroundings.
?’ The spell of the moment was instantly broken. Dean instinctively reached up to restore some semblance of order. ‘Not the hair. Do you mind?’
Dean stared at the angel for a moment longer, a smile beginning to tug at the corners of his mouth. ‘You know, I think that can wait. For now there are more pressing matters at hand.’ He gestured grandly to the Impala. ‘Getting this baby back into tip top shape, for one.’
Castiel was unperturbed. ‘Time is of the essence. Lilleth is close to breaking the next seal. We require your assistance.’
‘What’s the point?’ Dean’s jaw was tight. ‘He’s probably already dead. If he’s lucky. If not demons, then just some punk looking to score.’
‘Your prayer.’
‘Yes. Would this be an appropriate juncture for me to also enquire after your health?’ Castiel’s expression didn’t change, but Dean was almost sure he saw a flicker of humour in those blue eyes.
He moved a little, into the light from the doorway, and she saw him clearly.
Castiel waited at the appointed time and place. She was late. That was unusual, to say the least. And Castiel was beginning to experience a number of unfamiliar sensations which he was amusing himself by naming, using his experience with the Winchesters. He was tired, he thought, and cold. He was also starting to feel distinctly irritated with waiting, and something else – what was that feeling?
'I will have you know, I am the wittiest of my brethren.' Castiel's face was almost teasing.
Castiel continued, seemingly unaware of the effect his words were having. ‘No-one has ever prayed for me before. People pray to me, not for me, if they think of me at all. They do not concern themselves with my well-being. Yet it was important to you. In defiance of heaven. At risk of hell. It was important - to you.’
So fierce in his loyalty, and righteousness, yet so vastly loving. So aware of his obedience to their beloved father, yet so constantly anxious about his role in the war. There were none of them, she thought, who felt this war as deeply as Castiel. None who concerned themselves so much with the human cost. None, save herself, who had spent so much time amongst the humans. And that was why, wasn’t it? His desire for certainty, to understand them in order to know, to be certain that his orders could be followed without the concerns which now weighed his conscience.
