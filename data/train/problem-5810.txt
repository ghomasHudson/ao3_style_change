Peter hung back, letting go of his father’s hand to grab onto Steve’s instead.
They made it through half the batch of cookies and almost two episodes of the show before Tony cleared his throat, signaling to his AI to turn the volume down. It was time, he had stalled long enough. The two of them had to talk about what was going on between the two of them.
Steve glanced over at the newest addition to their group, a tiny first grade boy who he had seen run off the bus into the gym a couple times before he had shown up to his art room a couple weeks ago.
Tony rolled his eyes and straightened back up. While he wasn’t going to back out of his ultimatum, he looked reluctant to upset his son even further.
“Do I look like a thirteen year old girl to you, punk?”
“I’m in aftercare right now. Go away,” Peter didn’t so much as look up at his father as he used the patterned scissors to cut the edges of his card into zig-zags.
The table he was standing closest to was full of mostly fourth and fifth grade girls who had been painting for years, and he watched as they immediately grabbed brushes and started wetting the paints. Steve figured they had it handled over here, and if they didn’t he’d always come over if one of them raised a hand.
While he may have nudged his resume into a more favorable light for the job, Steve really did enjoy every afternoon he spent working here and had done better than the previous art teacher had, according to the staff.
And wasn’t that an idea?
“Overjoyed,” the woman muttered with a smile, tapping at a few more things before shutting off her tablet and sending a smile Steve’s way. “You must be the new babysitter. I’m Pepper Potts, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Is there something wrong?”
She sent him an unamused look, the two of them starting a staring match of sorts before she rolled her eyes with a sigh and opened her arms as well.
Peter lit up instantly, one hand pointing to the paper and the other reaching out to grab Steve and tug him in closer like the kid didn’t already have his full attention. As the first grader began to dive into Spiderman’s backstory, Steve couldn’t help but listen intently to every word he said.
“Not tired,” Peter grumbled right away, rubbing at his eyes before making grabby hands up at Steve.
“Is that secret source 6’1, blonde, and apparently annoyingly open about his personal relationships when it comes to old war buddies who need a shower?” Tony groaned, halting his progress on the arm yet again.
Steve would have stayed there for longer if the cool, March chill hadn’t caused his fingers to go numb.
Peter was always the last one to leave, without fail. After-care at the Rec Center only went until six, but Steve’s waited nearly an hour past that waiting for someone to come pick the first grader up. He’s always half-tempted to give the kid’s parents a piece of his mind but he’s yet to even meet them. A man deemed ‘Uncle Happy’ coming in a rush to pick him up every day.
“Then why aren’t you comin’?” Peter’s uncertainty was starting to shift to upset.
Through the entirety of the car ride and the countless meetings that plagued his weekend, he managed to forget his worries about his son being upset. While the business being conducted was dull and menial, it was enough to keep the man distracted.
“Yeah, I really like cookies,” he hummed, eyes still glued to the TV as he fished a small hand around blindly for another one.
Tony sighed, slumping on the island. He took a minute to rest there and try to breathe through the stress headache and jet lag currently joining forces to wreak havoc inside of his skull. Like a switch had been flicked, suddenly the genius wasn’t hungry anymore and was feeling like he could sleep for days.
With that, a crowd of excited elementary schoolers kicked out of their seats and rushed towards the hoard of craft items. All the students except for one, that is.
Except maybe Thursday wasn’t a good time either.
(See the end of the chapter for
“An’ then Mr. Steve is Captain America. It’s ‘cause when I asked him why Jarvis called him Captain Rogers, he said that he used to fight for the american army,” Peter explained, pointing to the tall muscular hero standing behind the smaller Spiderman.
I'm so very sorry for any mistakes in this chapter! I didn't have time to edit this as thoroughly as I would have liked to
So, with an air of professionalism that Sam would pat him on the back for and Natasha would roll her eyes at, the teacher handed off the backpack to Peter and wished him a good evening.
Living in the spotlife his entire life, the genius knew what would happen after this article was published. There’d be even more of the press stalking the recreation center, and subsequently, Steve.
The other two men quieted down. It wasn’t often they got a genuine response about how Steve was feeling so they didn’t want to push him away.
“Aw, Buck - c’mon! That’s gross!” Despite his protests, Steve couldn’t stop himself from laughing. “Not at the table, and on a Sunday, no less. What would your mom say?”
“Goodness, me, Ms. Potts! Did you already forget about our meeting? That’s poor form, really. You should be ashamed of yourself,” Tony laid it on thick, sighing like it pained him to do so. “We’ll be docking your pay for this. I’m very disappointed.”
“Maybe, but all you’d have to do is flash those sad, blue eyes and flutter those pretty lashes and she’d let you go free.”
It would have been weird for the blonde to waltz up and interrupt their play-date planning and call Tony a hack parent and ruin maybe the one good thing he’s seen him do for Peter. He’d have that chat tomorrow.
“No, I think I’m ok. Thank you, though, Doctor Parker-Stark,” Tony wrapped his arms around his son and pulled him close. “You didn’t tell Mr. Rogers about daddy’s light, right?”
“But what about background checks and have you even met him really there’s a lot of real freaks out there and-”
It was all a part of an after school program that the Rec Center organized, almost like a daycare but with activities to do instead of just a room full of toys for the kids to go crazy with.
“Oh, woe is me,” Barnes sighed, stretching the aforementioned arm out when Tony reached for it.
Steve stood up, completely shocked at the normally well-behaved boy’s attitude.
The teacher opened his mouth to give a list of reasons, but looking into those wide brown eyes, he couldn’t bring a single one to mind.
“It was a three day conference in Las Vegas. I doubt it was as bad as you were letting on,” Pepper huffed as she took her former employer’s elbow and led him to the elevator.
“We try something new every time we come here,” Tony cut in, not unkindly, from where he sat staring at the menu. Peter nodded enthusiastically.
“It’s fine, Rogers. I might be old, but I can still manage to clean my own living room,” Tony huffed.
Steve continued to slowly wander the room, helping those who needed it and asking about their days and what they were going to be painting. Over the next couple of hours, as the kids were either picked up or finishing their paintings and going to the gym, the room slowly emptied out until there was just the teacher and two students. Peter and another first grade boy named Ned.
Of course they had fought before, they were both stubborn Stark men. They butted heads over small things all the time. That’s just it, though. SMALL things. Never full blown clawing and shrieking and cursing at him before.
“Yes, you are. That’s exactly what you’re supposed to do,” Natasha said crossly. “And you can’t have more than one best friend. That defeats the purpose of a best friend.”
“God, now you sound just like Natasha,” Steve groaned miserably, covering his face with his hands. “You know she attempts to set me up with a new blind date every week? I don’t even know where she finds all these people...”
As soon as his beloved son was laid to rest (After three chapters from one of his Magic Treehouse books, jesus kid.) he had found himself in front of the couch, and calling out for JARVIS to look into anybody by the name Steve Rogers currently living in New York.
Between waking up twenty minutes late and the lovely traffic in New York City at six in the evening, Tony was nearly forty minutes late picking up his son.
This is my third time trying to post this chapter, I'm sorry it's so late! At least it means less of a wait between this week's chapter and the next one.
Like right now how, as the blonde ordered his lunch, his childhood friend waggled his eyebrows at him from across the tiny two-person table.
The window pumped freezing, cold spring air in from the early morning sky. It cooled him off, making the sweaty shirt he was wearing stick to him uncomfortably, but all Steve could do was sit there and focus on breathing. He sat there, unmoving for anywhere from ten minutes to a full hour, it’s not like he could tell. By the time he straightened up, pulling his head from where he had buried it against his arms on the window sill, the alarm clock on the side of his bed read 8:16.
“Yesterday, in art class, Mr. Steve told us to draw somethin' we love for Valentines Day,” Peter explained. “So I wanted to draw you an’ me, but then I was like: I can’t just draw you an’ me without Unca Happy, Rhodey, and Mizz Potts!” The boy explained like it was the easiest thing in the world to understand.
“Sure, no nightmares,” She muttered, giving him a skeptical look before giving in and turning back to the pond. “What is there to talk about?”
“You’re not old, I didn’t mean-” Steve’s face went red. “I mean, only if you’re sure. Peter was great, I didn’t have any trouble. Except for when he tried to push for a later bedtime, but I had expected that.”
Tuesday just hadn’t been the right time to talk. Timing was important with these things if he actually wanted a chance to get through to Tony.
Ned gasped, Tony’s eyes widened, Steve’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline.
“Natalie Rushman, Mr. Stark’s assistant, it’s so nice to meet you,” Natasha interrupted Steve, sticking her hand out for him to shake. Her eyes bore into him, daring him to say a word. “So, you’re the person who took my babysitting gig.” she joked, all saccharine smiles framed with candy apple red lips, it was leaving the man with a toothache. This wasn’t Natasha, at least not the one that he knew.
“As nice as that would be,” She slapped Tony’s hands away from the elevator controls. “I can’t just go firing any slimey old man who calls me pretty in a condescending tone of voice.” Pepper gestured to the living area of the penthouse as the doors opened in front of them. “After you.”
“You’re not in trouble, Pete. I’m just curious,” Tony nodded, rubbing a hand up and down his back, trying not to betray how anxious the idea of Steve knowing made him.
Regardless of potential apartment complex meltdown situations, Sam and Bucky’s place became their official meeting hub for all things emergency. Steve had rushed over after work Monday afternoon and had spent the last five minutes wearing a hole into the carpet with his frantic pacing while his two friends watched in amusement, waiting for him to explain the situation.
“Daddy!!! You said anything!” Peter whined, puppy dog eyes in full force. “I’ll be so good, an’, an’ we can get those cheeseburgers you like an’ we do it right after art, pleeeease daddy!”
Bucky and Sam had met in a veteran's support group that Sam ran and had the hate equivalent of love at first sight. Enemies on sight.
“Funny, I didn’t take you for a gossip,” Tony squinted up at him before slowly going back to looking through the arm, shining a light down towards the wrist joint.
“That sounds like fun,” Steve couldn’t imagine what kind of man would take his six year old into work with him on the weekends and call him an intern, but Peter didn’t seem to mind so he held his tongue. “Is your dad coming to pick you up today?”
“Any particular reason you chose our place to wander aimlessly in, or did you just need an excuse to hang?” Sam drawled, leaning across the armrest of the couch.
“You better stop talking or I’m going to hurl all over you and this fancy, new-fangled arm,” Barnes growled. “And you can’t say shit, not when you’re mooning over Steve of all people.”
“She’d eat me alive an’ then Becca’d cheer me on from where ma can’t see,” Bucky rested his head onto his mechanical arm, tossing the menu to the blonde.
“I swear I get no respect around here!” Tony huffed, casually placing the drawing face down on the desk and pointedly ignoring the concerned look Steve cast in his direction. “Well, let’s try ‘em then. They better be damn near perfect or there’ll be hell to pay.”
“Fine,” she sighed, leaning back into the bench. “But only since this whole thing is just because of your huge crush on Stark.”
The friday afternoon after that monday evening, as Steve got on his motorcycle and prepared to follow Tony’s sports car to the tower, he received a text message from Bucky.
“Firstly, bold of you to assume I’m not already planning on how to defile a national treasure like that,” the genius hadn’t actually made any concrete plans to seduce Rogers, but the sputtering his best friend did over the phone after he had said that was worth the minor fib. “And, secondly, I’m not going to do that because he seems like just the type of boy-next-door to get awkward after sleeping together, and I’m not doing that to Peter.”
“Perfect timing,” she hummed, putting her cell away in satisfaction. “Something just popped up, I’ve got work to do. Have a good rest of your afternoon, and don’t think so hard. You’ll wrinkle your pretty little face.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not getting - no! Nat, no. That’s not what this is about at all,” Steve should have known Natasha would find a way to shake him. Deflecting was practically second nature to her, especially when it came to talking about things she didn’t want to.
“That was before I decided to take all of you in,” Tony said, throwing the damp towel at Steve’s head and scowling when Steve caught it easily. “Do you know how much property damage a team of superheroes can do?”
It wasn’t a repeat of the day prior by any means. Peter gave his dad a small smile when he came into the art room, and even answered when asked how his day had been. No, the first grader was just fine. It was looking at the business tycoon shaped elephant in the room eye-to-eye that was causing problems.
“Goodnight, Miss. Rushman, see you tomorrow,” Tony watched her slip into the elevator and out of sight. That was...interesting.
“Peter and I, yeah.” Tony was shifting around, from his arms hanging loosely to his sides to folded across his chest to shoved in his pockets. On anybody else it would have looked fidgety, but that was ridiculous. Tony Stark didn’t fidget. “It’s nothing serious. Don’t worry, Fortunato. I’m not bringing you home for a private wine-tasting in my basement anytime soon. I figured we’d just grab burgers at the joint down the road and then I’ll be out of your hair for a long time.”
The caption on the page read ‘New Addition to the Stark Family???’ and went into detail how this mysterious, unidentified, blonde hottie was one of Tony’s newest sweethearts. Things like ‘What does he think about the Stark heir??? Will Tony Stark’s son make or break this blossoming relationship?! Could this finally be the man to tie down and tame the unruly Stark namesake???’ The press were utter vultures.
“Now tell us what’s been bothering you, man,” Sam was using what everybody deemed as his therapy voice. It was a soft tone of voice that he used when he wanted somebody to open up to him, and as much as his friends teased him for it, the voice never failed to goad them into bearing their souls. Bucky despised it.
He only holds it because he's not dead, Eugene," Tony drawled, "But he's long retired from controlling the funding for this building from the Stark Foundation."
"Tony, can you answer the phone? I'm busy making Peter's lunch." Steve called from the kitchen.
you can open yours," Tony laughed, catching the boy's look, "Just a lil more patience, squeakers."
for a few minutes, let alone get it up."
"I know it stinks, but waiting a little longer is better than me just outright saying 'No', right?" He asked the boy softly. "Once Sammy can at least toddle, we'll look around for a pup, okay?"
"Mmm, you're all warm now-- It’s wonderful." He purred, resting hands on Tony's lower back.
"Surprise? Oh my god," Tony pushed his empty plate aside, grinning at Steve, "The suspense is gonna kill me. Oh, fuck, can I guess? Hmm--"
good. Sometimes it's my idea. Most times. The closet was his idea though."
"Yep. All ready to go." Steve replied with an unassuming smile, taking Tony's free hand in his as they headed back home. "Bread smells wonderful."
. Nice 'n slow, just so good--".
"Jus' a little nap. Then we can help move Peter in and talk," He murmured, almost instantly drifting off.
"Y'know, we should probably move to one of our bedrooms," He stated, "Unless you're comfortable lying on the wood floor. Couch would be okay too, if curling up on my quilt is too far."
"We'll find a balance, pip, I promise," Tony murmured, kissing the boy's cheek, "You're okay, no need to get upset. Tell you what. We'll move our schoolroom down to the lab, okay? That way we'll all be together and I can still get work done."
Steve's grip on the chair had finally loosened completely at the reassurance, tears building in his eyes as the form finally was close enough,
Steve chuckled softly, giving Tony a smooch back before getting up onto the bed.
of things lately, including finally introducing him to Bruce. Bruce, who, evidentially, owned the sex shop down on 31
"It's okay, bambi," Tony murmured, "Shhh."
He reached over beside him to give the groaning form a reassuring pet of his fur before he paused, hand instead making contact with skin void of fur. It must be morning and Steve changed back, Tony thought. He then thought that if Steve had changed back, then that also meant the man next to him was very much naked. The brunet dared to look beside him to check on his teammate, thankful that the other’s legs and backside were covered by a mound of blankets when he did. Steve’s skin must’ve gotten cold from the lack of fur once he changed back at sunrise.
"Right," Tony sighed sadly, "That's gonna suck. I'm gonna have to entertain myself all
“Geez, pushy." Steve smirked, raising his hips and helping shimmy out his sweats. "And what do you plan to do now, Tony?" He noised softly as Tony caught a nipple between his teeth.
"Better. Much better." Steve breathed, moving his jaw carefully before kissing Tony back deeply. "I like being able to kiss you back, love."
Tony purred happily, nuzzling up into the blond with a hum. He smooched Steve's neck, feeling his headache leave as the medicine kicked in.
Steve nodded softly, sitting down on the bed.
"Well, when you can't use the toilet yet, it’s what happens." Steve sighed, finishing up the change and spraying some light freshener in the room.
"Please Sir, please, need you in me," he whimpered.
"That's shyness, love, and I'm
Steve wrapped Tony into a hug, rubbing Tony's back softly. "You didn't have that good a situation as a kid, though..." He hummed sadly. "But we make up for it a little with our family Christmases."
"Anything else you want, sweets?" He hummed, "Or you ready to get home and try some stuff?"
"Of course, Love." Steve hummed, cleaning up before carefully scooping Tony up and heading upstairs to their room.
He nodded to the both of them before leaving the men to their spoils.
Peter nodded sadly and tucked his face into the crook of Tony's neck, whimpering pitifully.
"I don't want to hear about your sex with short stack," Bucky snorted, putting the first drawer in and starting on the second, "But while we're on the topic, Clint's home tonight, if you wanna try your 'escapades' again. Considering last time, Pete was throwing up everywhere."
“Pfft, please. You do not have a lot of belly fat at all." Steve scoffed. "And I was meaning you were comfy like home." He said softly. "It’s nice having someone to just hold close and cuddle."
"I'm probably just paranoid," he shook his head, "But I'm gonna go up the restrictions on his computer, okay? I'll come back once I'm done."
"Uh huh." Peter switched marker colors before fixing up the last of Steve's tattoo, crudely writing 'Daddy' across the middle of the heart.
"Absolutely. I love looking at the penguins, too." Steve chuckled, buckling in and starting the car. "On to the aquarium!" He proclaimed as they started to go.
Tony then caught whiff of something; like the smell of something getting a touch too crispy in the oven. That smell... What was that smell? Oh, it smelled like slightly singed...
Tony blinked, mouthing 'talk about that later' at Steve.
"If I had the Stark name on my back, I'd feel the same," Bucky sighed, helping Steve tidy the room, "I mean, all the scandals
"I didn't mean to bruise you." Steve said, truly apologetic, "I actually was trying to rub to make you feel better, not to bruise you."
"Hmm, well we can look into it or other things more sometime soon." Steve said, a smirk on his lips. "Maybe for your birthday since that'll be coming up soon, right? And you'll officially be a big boy." He teased playfully with a laugh.
,” Clint drawled. “Tell us something we
of you is pretty!” Pepper calls out just before the elevator doors close, and the noise Tony makes after is definitely not human.  Tony’s surprised that the skin hasn’t already melted off of his face.
?!” Tony sputtered.
.”  Steve groaned when Tony bit down on his collarbone.
“Sure,” Tony responded, looking back down at his tablet.  He was playing around with some plans for some sort of vehicle: it looked too large to be another suit.
” which means they’re playing video games again.
He froze when got to a photo about halfway into the book.
“If he’s half the man you say he is, then I suppose he’ll do,” Rhodey says reluctantly. “But I wanna meet him, and I’m sure Pepper will want to as well.  If this guy thinks he can date my best friend without even properly introducing himself to me, then he’s got another thing coming.”
The day Steve actually became legitimately concerned for the man’s health was after Dr. Doom had tried the whole world domination thing again. The army of Doombots was three times the size as usual, and even with the help of the Fantastic Four, it took a good seven hours to finally get rid of every single one of them.
“Jarvis, pull up the news. I wanna make sure it’s long enough since my last scandal to make a scene,” Tony muttered as he pulled out the schematics for a touch-screen computer he was considering releasing to the public, it was something new from Stark Industries anyways.
I'm not dead! I'm sorry this took so long, but I got caught up in school and all that jazz. Now that I've got my college application stuff rolling I'm less stressed and I've started writing again, yay! I'm not sure if I'll have a chapter out every week like I did during the summer, but I'll try and post to this story every other week. If you're just dying for something to read, though, I'm also writing a sequel to my spiderman spring break fic and will update that inbetween chapters of this fic. Maybe, depends on how much homework I have lmao.
Even as his eyes drifted over towards the young couple in the corner booth of the diner and how their young kid looked at them with stars in their eyes.
Yes, at a passing glance you could imagine the two were related. With similar messy brown hair and a slightly shorter than average stature, there were a couple of common traits. The eyes were what made them undeniably connected to one another. They both had wide, expressive, brown eyes that lit up like lights on a Christmas tree the moment they were in front of something that excites them.
It had been a business trip better than most, but Tony was exhausted. He couldn’t wait to settle down with his son on the couch and veg for the next two hours after dinner. At least that was the plan until he saw the mess strewn across his living room.
Peter sniffled and looked up at his father with big, round puppy dog eyes. “Anything?”
Not because of any of the students, no. His kids were amazing like always. Maybe a little more rambunctious as February was coming to an end and spring was quickly approaching, but otherwise they were fine.
Tony blearily blinked the sleep out of his eyes and sluggishly dragged himself out of the car. The tired businessman trudged his way towards the trunk of the vehicle where his trusted bodyguard and friend was pulling out his suitcase.
Both boys had finished their art projects for the day and were scribbling onto printer paper with crayons, babbling about what their costumes would look like if they were heroes. The veteran could hear the two of them discussing backstories from where he stood at the sink, rinsing out the watercolor cups and setting them aside to dry with the paint brushes.
“Hey, spidermonkey. How was your weekend?” Tony slowly made his way around the sulking six year old, trying to catch his eye.
“When you gonna let me check this thing out for myself?”
“I’ll say,” Steve huffed, shaking his head. He didn’t quite know what to do with this new knowledge.
“Google it,” Tony told him, grabbing Steve’s duffel bag from where it had been sitting beside the couch and turning to shove it into his arms. “Shoot me a message when you finish making your paypal and then we’re all set. Have a good rest of your weekend.” the brunette, turned with a half-hearted wave as he walked to the kitchen. He hoped to god it looked like he knew what he was doing.
Right away Steve was hit with a rush of noise that had his hand shooting up to adjust the volume on the hearing aid in his left ear, the combination of about forty different conversations taking place and music playing over the restaurant speakers overwhelming him instantly. The settings for a quiet classroom were too sensitive for a bustling diner like this.
“Jarvis is our butler and he lives in the ceiling. If you listen really closely, you can hear him scuttling around up there during the night,” Tony gestured above him as he bustled around the living area in the penthouse. Steve watched as the harried genius put his bags in a pile and tried to cram miscellaneous paperwork into a briefcase.
“I must’ve overestimated how hungry I was,” he sighed, leaning his head onto his hand with a forlorn look at his half-empty plate. “I’ll never be able to finish all these noodles on my own. If only there was a certain special spider monkey who could come help me out, then we could eat the cookies I made for dessert too. Oh, well.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Steve hummed. He’d been meaning to have a conversation with Natasha for a couple of weeks now, but she was definitely avoiding him as of late. Which normally wouldn’t be too hard to get around if she wasn’t an honest to god spy. Or, at least, he’s coming to believe she is. “Thanks, Sam. See you later.”
"Yes, he's mine. Now that we're all caught up, where is he???" Tony was impatiently bouncing his left leg, glancing around the lobby as if Peter would just magically be there.
It had been hard to get him back from Hydra, and it didn’t help that the brunette was fighting them on it every step of the way. Little did anyone know that getting him to the states would be the easiest part of the entire mess. When James Buchanan Barnes finally came home he was missing his arm and the majority of his memories beyond the time he spent as an assassin in Russia.
"Great, fantastic. Thank you, bye," and with that, Tony sped off down the hall.
“We’re going by plane,” Pepper huffed.
Peter all but crashed into his dad, gripping onto his suit jacket tightly.
Both the Starks turned to stare at Steve, waiting for his response. Tony tried to keep the exhaustion off of his face at the idea of having to play host for the art teacher tonight, but he still felt bad about leaving his son, so he’d ultimately do what Peter wanted.
Then they had to go and drag Steve into this as well, trying to connect dots in the worst way possible. The only way this could get worse was if the blonde found out about this and called him to tell Tony and his son to fuck off, and find a different aftercare program to enroll Peter in.
The two stayed in the art room the whole time they spent at the Rec Center, which was probably why they got along so well. That and the fact that the two of them were both obsessed with Star Wars, Legos, and superheroes.
The blonde knew that teachers weren’t supposed to have a favorite student, or at least they should never admit it out loud, but it was hard not to have a soft spot for the kid.
“Is it Nat? I can get you a new babysitter if you don’t like her,” Tony reached over to put an arm around his son’s shoulder but was surprised when he immediately shoved him away.
“Correction: nothing is more important than I am, darling. Don’t you forget it!”
“Hell yeah, you do. What’s the make, hot shot?” Tony had caught up to his kid and immediately started to circle around the blonde’s bike. “Nothing recent, I can tell you that just by looking at it. She’s in killer condition though, who’s your maintenance man? Beauty like this needs proper care.”
“Miss...Honey?”
There was a brief pause as Tony’s usual smirk morphed into something more thoughtful as he squinted up at Steve. It was as if he was trying to figure him out just by staring at him.
“A new sitter? And you trust this mystery man with the life of your son for three days?” she questioned incredulously. “Who are you and what have you done with Tony?”
“Mr. Steve! Did daddy tell you that you’re comin’ to dinner with us???” Peter had finished shoving the last of his projects into his bag and had skipped over, the human embodiment of honest to god sunshine.
Sorry, again, for the late chapter!
“I said no! Lemme go! You’re stupid an’ dumb!” Peter continued to hurl insults and tiny fists at his father, even as Tony glanced over at Steve, nodding to the door.
“Yayyy!” Peter cheered, standing up from his dad’s lap and bouncing across the couch cushions. “Jarvis can you turn the TV back up? I like this episode, in this episode Mikey hasta, um, he hasta help April when she accidentally sees one of the ninja dudes who is-”
“Maybe one for Ned,” Peter mumbled, sitting up from where he had been slouched over. “Maybe one for Unca Rhodey, too.”
Tony reluctantly took the paper from Steve, sending him a suspicious glare over the rim of his rose-tinted shades. Who gave him the right to be tall and handsome and ridiculously good at art and capable of reading Tony’s mind like nobody but his closest friends and family could? He had practically grew up in the spotlight and cultivated many a mask to disguise the things that wouldn’t blow over in public, things that were weaknesses.
“Hey, kiddo. How was your day at school?” Tony asked in a decidedly Not-Tony-Stark-From-TV tone of voice.
It wasn’t until Barnes was out of the examination room and JARVIS confirmed he was in the elevator down to the first floor lobby that Tony buried his face in his hands and groaned loudly.
“Secondly, I’ve never seen such low-level flirting get you so flustered. It’s actually kind of gross. Get a grip, man.”
There was a brief moment of quiet over the call as Rhodey hummed in thought.
It was quiet for a moment as father and son just stood, staring at each other.
“Thank god. I’m not sure I could tolerate you around here anymore before then,” Tony sighed, waving him out.
He came here to clear the air with Natasha.
“Woah, woah! Slow your roll, Turbo,” Tony whirled around, holding his arms out in the universal symbol of chill, a takeout box in one hand and a cold slice of pizza in the other. “I was planning on doing something with Peter this weekend to make up for the business trip.”
“Daddy!” Peter shouted out, making the teacher turn to where he could see the boy leap from his chair to give his dad a hug.
“Then what makes me any different? I shouldn’t ask him out if he won’t have any time for a relationship,” Steve doesn’t know when the conversation turned from him adamantly denying his crush on Tony to what it would be like if they were to start dating, but the blonde was too curious to question it.
“Later, sourpuss,” Tony grinned, simultaneously  hanging up the call and stepping out onto the common floor of the tower where he usually held social events for the company. He no longer had a fully stocked bar on the floor of the penthouse, not after he got Peter. It was as much of a babyproofing effort as it was a way to dissuade him from drinking excessively.
"Jarvis, snooze!" Tony yelled out, face half buried into one of the pillows that covered the top half of his bed.
“Hey, underoos. What do you want for dinner? I’ll take you out for whatever you want.”
His son scooped up Spider Monkey and bounced out of his chair and over to the living room. As he set the empty plates into the sink, he could hear Peter asking JARVIS to put on an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that he’s probably already watched a million times over. Tony grabbed the container holding the cookies and fell back onto the couch next to the boy, sending him up in the air a little bit.
“I built it, yes, but I’m not the one literally attached to it,” Tony muttered as he worked on gently moving wires aside and doing general maintenance to the guts of the machine. The main elbow joint was starting to look worn, he’d put some oil on it for now then bring up possibly replacing it next month. “As much as I enjoy watching you stalk around with that drowned alley cat look on your face, I do want you to be satisfied with what I’ve done here.”
“Oh, I see it now,” Tony managed to spit out after a moment’s hesitation. “Well, there we go. Aren’t we just a regular Brady Bunch?”
“Red’s my favorite color! Did you paint it or was it man-uh-fractured like that?” There were practically stars in Peter’s eyes and his father looked just about the same. For the first time since he had found out that he was Tony Stark’s son, he could see the resemblance between the two.
“You weren’t there! He was giving me these big sad eyes, and if I said no, I would have felt like a total monster-”
“You had Valentine’s Day dinner with Stark??”
“What, daddy???”
“Hey! I’m not THAT greasy,” Barnes huffed, shooting Tony a look that the genius dubbed his ‘murder stare’ before continuing. “And it’s not that he’s open about it, it’s just obvious that you two have a thing going on.”
“If you would go put the cookies away before they bring ants into your room,” Tony grinned, handing the plastic box back over to his son who shot a grumpy look back, but still went to do as he was told.
Steve raised his hands in surrender immediately. “Hey! Don’t drag me into this, I’m just the babysitter.”
“I’ll be at the meetings this weekend,” Tony sniffed, finally looking up to meet Pepper’s eyes. “Do me a favor and schedule the majority of my meetings on weekdays from this point on, if you so please, my dear Pepper?”
“Oh? Do you and Ned hang out a lot outside of class?” Steve asked, sitting down next to Peter and grabbing some paper and a pencil for himself.
Steve came to talk with Nat and hadn’t gotten a single clear answer out of her for why she was working as Stark’s secretary. She left him with even more questions, and she was probably already in her car and halfway to her apartment by now.
He sent her a location and a time to meet him at before tucking his phone away and hopping onto his motorcycle. While Natasha was doing a good job at avoiding him, he knew she wouldn’t just ignore him calling her out like that.
“Oof, geez, kiddo. You’re getting too heavy for me to carry you,” the man teased, poking at his son’s side to make him giggle.
“What? No! I mean…” Steve trailed off, imagining what the genius would be like on a date. He’d never been around Tony without Peter except for their brief conversation in the parking lot on Valentine’s Day, and they had gotten on like a house on fire. “I thought he was with someone already?”
Steve had found the job opening for an art instructor while searching through the paper one morning. They had a somewhat desperate help wanted advertisement shoved away in the corner. As quick as he could, the veteran sent in his outstanding resume that listed his many good attributes such as his education in the arts (The aforementioned half-finished graphic design degree.) and previous experience in childcare (Babysitting his best friend’s little sisters when he was thirteen.).
“I promise I’m not lying. Go ahead, try it,” Steve gestured to the paper in front of the little kid.
“You got a big ol’ motorcycle!”
Great. It’s just another lovely Friday morning for Steve Rogers.
Steve was perfectly content.
“Sounds fantastic, all the teachers are conspiring against me specifically by sugarloading my pride and joy then sending him straight home,” Tony hummed, the smile evident in his voice. “Speaking of our friendly neighborhood Mr. Rogers. Any idea where he is, Mr. McFeely?”
“Ok! Now that we’ve got that sorted out, I’m off to cheeseburger paradise. Have a good-”
“Oh, I don’t know, ‘Natalie.’ You tell me,” Steve huffed, tossing his hands up frustratedly. “What? Am I just supposed to pretend that I didn’t see one of my best friends playing secretary for Tony Stark himself?”
“Steve Rogers, and the pleasure’s all mine, ma’am,” Steve grinned, shaking her hand.
“What’s going on, Tony? Isn’t it like ten at night over there or-”
"Sir, it's time for you to get up. The time is exactly-"
“Woah, Peter! Look, it’s Tony Stark!!” Ned called out, the teacher could hear the legs of his chair scraping against the flooring as he stood up quickly.
“What’s up, Steve? Everything good?” Sam asked, the sounds of people fading away as he presumably walked to a different place.
“And Peter likes you,” Tony was being serious now, a tone of voice void of any sarcasm he might use with the press or playfulness he uses with his son. “He’s so comfortable around you and maybe that might make it easier for him when I’m out on business trips. I hate upsetting him like that, so maybe having someone he actually likes around while I’m away might help.”
“Would you bet money on it, Ms. Potts?” Tony raised his eyebrows, giving her a skeptical look from over top his glasses. “Did you know some of those old crones on the board are still trying to convince me to start up weapons manufacturing again? Even after that little stunt with Obie and the Ten Rings?”
"Woah, mom?" Bucky was suddenly interested in the conversation now. No matter what he said otherwise, he lived for digging into other people's business. It was a bad habit. He was working on it. "I figured his mom was just that CEO lady Stark's dating."
It was breaking his heart to see his son like this. Grabbing both of Peter’s wrists to stop him from hitting, he lowered his voice to something soft. “I’m sorry, Peter, I’m so sorry.” Tony pulled the boy in close, rocking him back and forth in an attempt to calm him down. “I’m not going anywhere this week, I promise you. I’m going to pick you up everyday like I said I would, and then on Friday we can go do something special for Valentine’s Day. Anything you want.”
“Daddy! Mr. Steve drew us as superheroes! He’s the best drawer ever, you’ve gotta come see,” Peter interrupted, tugging insistently on his father’s arm to try and drag him to his bedroom.
“You guys still get ants, even all the way up here?” Steve asked incredulously.
The boy was too interested in finding his way out of the maze on his paper to keep the conversation going any further. This was awkward. The silence was killing Steve. He had already picked what he was going to order two minutes ago and now he was just continuing to read the menu for lack of anything better to do.
“I don’t know about all that,” Steve’s laughed nervously, flushing as he shook his head. Since when did a little flirting make him such a wreck?
“I mean, like, seriously. You look like you eat nails for breakfast and lift trucks over your head, Macho Man, nowhere near wrangling first graders into finger painting,” Tony was off on a tangent now, Peter balanced on his hip while he used his free hand to sling his son’s bag over his shoulder and gesture along to his rant.
“That’s very nice of you. I’m sure both of them would be overjoyed to get a card from you,” Steve smiled, patting the boy’s back before standing up.
“Welcome back, sir. Would you like me to inform Captain Rogers of your arrival?” JARVIS greeted his creator as soon as he stepped into the elevator to Stark Tower.
“Betty, what do you think we’re doing today?” he asked, pointing to the blond third grader who had been raising her hand and sitting quietly for her chance.
also a quick apology for disappearing for two weeks, i was in a different state with no laptop one week and then after that I caught the plague, which i am still trying to get over! Thanks for sticking with me, though!
Majority of the class yelled back they had a good day in response, a few kids yelling out ‘awful’ to make their friends laugh.
“Right, right. Of course, I just-”
"This is the third time you've set me to snooze, sir. If you don't get up soon you might be late to-"
“I asked if you had any plans tonight, Johnny Bravo,” Tony sighed like he hadn’t just said something straight out of the teacher’s nightmares. “I get it if you’ve got some little girlfriend or whatever waiting for you at home since it’s good ol’ Saint Hearts day, but if you’re free I’d really appreciate you coming to dinner with us.”
“Trying to kick me out of my own place, I see. Jarvis? Fire up the lasers,” Tony grinned as he stepped through the elevator doors.
From outside his classroom window he could hear the school bus brake’s squealing in protest as they pulled up to the main entrance of the building.
It was another lovely Friday morning for Steve Rogers in his delightful, empty apartment. At least the light streaming in from outside meant that it was morning and he didn’t have to pace around the combined living room and kitchen until he was too exhausted to stay upright, just for a couple minutes of rest before the nightmares started up again.
“Shit, Tony...I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that, I was-”
“Whaszit??? Whus hap’nen?” He slurred, rubbing his eyes from beneath crooked shades.
Apparently the talk with Ned’s parents had gone better than expected, and Tony would be leaving with both Ned and Peter this afternoon. Ned had pulled a note from his parents to show Steve and everything. It would have been terribly inconsiderate to embarrass the genius in front of both of his students, so the art teacher gave the boys a big grin and made them promise that they wouldn’t get into too much trouble.
It just about wrenched Steve’s heart out to see how sad Peter looked clinging to his only remaining parent with all the strength his tiny body could manage. He could only imagine how Tony was feeling right now.
That seemed to take the teacher aback. "I...I don't-"
It wasn’t as if he minded in the slightest, it sounded like Peter needed someone to just listen to him and the teacher was happy to do that.
“Yes, you do. It’s the look you get on your face before you make a snide comment like the slimy bastard you are. It’s the slimy bastard look, and I want it off your face effective immediately.”
“I’ll have to make one for Liz, she’s a fourth grader and she has really pretty hair. If I make her one I should probably make some for her friend Betty too, though…” Peter continued to babble to himself about who he’s making gifts for as he wandered to the counter to grab construction paper and glitter glue.
“Oh, shit, Steve. He’s doing the sad eyes!” Sam gasped sarcastically. “Now you have to do what he says!”
“I wouldn’t say that,” Steve shrugged, giving the genius a knowing smile as he walked to Peter’s desk and gingerly removed a drawing tacked to the corkboard hanging above it. “Peter insisted I draw one of his other favorite heroes, too.”
“Go. Everything will be ok, and you’ll be the first to know if it isn’t,” Steve stood outside, making sure the other man didn’t try and make an escape.
“Are you always so weirdly invested in your friend’s romantic life?” Tony drawled as he worked on putting the open panel to the metal arm securely back in place. “‘Cause I gotta say, it’s kind of unsettling.”
"It is currently 5:52 in the evening and Peter's Aftercare ends at six," JARVIS informed the now scrambling billionaire.
“Mr. Steve drew us as superheroes!” Peter babbled excitedly. “I’m Spiderman because spiders are cool and I got my powers because of that radioactive spider that bit me when I was way littler.”
Steve laughed at his excitement and did his best to get him to calm down just enough so that they weren’t garnering the stares of other restaurant patrons any more. It really was sweet how excited Peter was to hang out with him.
It seemed the message had been received as the genius waved his hand flippantly. “Natalie’s my assistant. There’s plenty of things for her to do beyond watching my mini monster,” Tony hummed. “Honestly, I think she’d be relieved. She puts on a brave face but I don’t think she’s all that into childcare.”
If Tony had asked him to babysit he wouldn’t have hesitated. The blonde adored Peter, but dinner just seemed too weird after only knowing them for such a short amount of time.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve?” Tony called out, poking his head in the room.
There he is!"
Tony can still feel how intimately connected they are.  And while Steve is being careful not to move and cause him any discomfort, Tony can still feel the sheer intensity of
What he isn’t expecting is for Steve to gently cup his cheek before pressing their lips together in an achingly tender kiss.
you to take me,”
’?” Tony asks.
“I’m not saying that none of this wouldn’t have happened if you had talked to me, but things may have gone a little differently if I had given you more reason to trust me,” Steve explains. “I know I often jump to conclusions, but I’ve been trying to work on that.”
“Shh, Tony, it’s okay—”
“They kept talking about how cute you two are,” Pepper said.  Tony knew she meant it as some sort of compliment, but the entire dinner was just a rude reminder of the one thing that Tony wanted but

“I like having it within arm’s reach,” Steve says. “And it’s not a

the serum, big shot,” he said, clapping him on the back. “You’ve even got a winning personality to boot.  Anyone would’ve been lucky to have you then, and they’d be lucky to have you now.”
“As a matter of fact, I am.”  She didn’t have to know that Tony had only turned twenty-one a month prior. Besides, Tony’s pretty sure that the drinking age in Steve’s country is lower than that in the states.
“Are you okay, Tony?”
? I thought you were happy—”
,” Tony said, picking off a piece of pepperoni and popping it into his mouth. “Here, I’ll give you your first dating tip: pizzerias are not ideal first date locations.  Yes, pizza is wonderful and delicious and basically the food of the gods, but getting sauce and grease all over your face is not the best way to make a first impression.”
"When did you get back?" Tony asks, trying for small talk.
“I’m really that obvious, huh?”
“I won’t argue with that.”
Steve looks unimpressed. “You’re seriously telling me that you can’t choose between your loving, doting, supersoldier boyfriend, or a mound of baked flour and sugar?”
“Sure, Tony,” Clint says, feigning sympathy.  Tony resists the urge to throw something at his head.
Pepper chose that moment to bring up the elephant in the room—there was no way Tony could escape with everyone watching them.  He didn’t know whether to be annoyed or impressed by her little trap.
Clint whips around and exclaims, “Hey, you’re back to your regular complexion!”
Steve remembered how careful Tony had been in the beginning of their relationship: always second-guessing what he said, and never pushing Steve into doing… well, anything.  Steve supposed it made sense: neither of them had a particularly good track record with dating, and the last thing either of them wanted to do was ruin their friendship.
“Or if you’re too tired, we can stick to plain old vanilla sex in our bed like other boring old couples—”
Tony sighed. “Thor?”
“How do you feel about potatoes?”
“Tony, we’re dating,” Steve reminds him, encroaching on Tony’s space. “And we’ve been friends for
“You don’t even have to ask, Steve,” Tony replied. “Honestly, I’d be a little insulted if you don’t do so in the next thirty seconds.”
“Nice to see you too, Tony,” Steve drawled, not even wincing as the medic continues stitching up the gash on his forehead.  The medic seems to sense the tension between the two men because she works impossibly faster, finishing the last stitch and packing her supplies in the blink of an eye.
It’s soft and unhurried, and… well, not at all what others would expect from Tony Stark.
a good person, Tony.”
“Say, do you have any plans for today?” Bruce asked.
“Of course,” Steve assures. “But I’ll be back soon enough.”
Tony wracked his brain for possibilities, but could only reply with: “I have no clue.”
is the one that’s lucky enough to have you.”
Tony’s jaw dropped open. “What are you doing?”
He could hear his heart pounding in his ears as he shuddered through the aftershocks, full body tremors that were almost too much to bear, but he wanted to feel Tony.  He wanted to hear him, wanted to know that he had the same effect that Tony had on him, and so he clenched his muscles tight as Tony gave three more deep, hard strokes before coming with a grunt and spilling inside of him.
Steve shook his head, but his gaze didn’t drift from the dark robe that Tony was wearing.  “No, just… that robe looks awfully familiar,” he said, studying the intricate gold embroidery.
“How am I supposed to do that when I’m
“Wait, what?” Steve glanced between the man and their waitress before settling his confused gaze on Tony. “What just happened?”
“Cranky and
“Tony, you made me watch
“Steve, if this is you trying to break up with me, it isn’t going to work.  You’re gonna be stuck with me until you get sick of me, and when that happens, I’ll just make you fall in love with me all over again.”
Steve smiles then, and when he kisses Tony, the blush spreads to the very tips of his toes.
Considering the fact that Steve became a billionaire and the CEO of one of the fastest-growing tech companies at the age of 22, it was kind of hard not to hear about him on the news, see his name in the papers about some huge breakthrough in green technology, or see his face on the tabloids after being spotted with yet another new person on his arm.
Steve sighed and sat on the edge of the bed. “Look, Tony.  I know you’re not interested in anything more, believe me, I know.  I’ve been trying to give you some space, to not let my feelings get in the way, but—”
“Um… thanks.  Milk and—”
).  Tony talks about how much he looks forward to having Steve in his arms at the end of every day.
were ever the same.
"I live in Brooklyn, Tony.  Spending an hour on the subway to come here isn’t really my idea of fun.”
Tony’s flown headfirst into death more times than he can count, but it was never quite like this.
When Steve stops fixating on it, however, he notices another pattern at home.
The old man at the table next to them gave Steve a disapproving look. “Moron,” he muttered.
She tilts her head. “Fair enough.  How long has this been going on?”
Tony regards him carefully. “What are you saying?”
have done differently?” Tony demands, his tone bordering on hysterics. “Look, I know I messed up, okay?  But I saw a way to prevent what Wanda showed me, and I thought I’d… I…”
The couple broke apart at the bright camera flash, choosing to glare at their teammates instead.  However, given their disheveled appearance, it wasn’t very effective.
“We have?”
Tony kept his eyes on Steve’s face, anxiously watching each shift in expression and burning the images into his mind, as if he’d never get to see it again. Steve managed to haul a hand up to Tony’s shirt. He twisted his fingers in the fabric and pulled Tony back into something that wasn’t quite a kiss, but more a co-mingling of their breaths.
“Oh.”  Tony surveyed the mess around him. “JARVIS, how long have I been down here?”
“Hammer,” replied Maria.
Tony feels the touch like a brand on his face as lava burbles up under his skin, burning across the bridge of his nose.  The kitchen is absolutely silent.
“And Tony’s been busy—”
“No!” Tony backtracks. “Nothing like that!  He’d never hurt me—
“Of course, I didn’t know!  How the hell would I have known?”
“Yeah, you did!”
“I should’ve known better than to let you meet my parents,” Steve mutters under his breath as he toes off his shoes.
Steve was right: in their line of work, they never knew what could happen.  Either one of them could die
“Come on, you two,” Bucky says, exasperated.  “You’ve been in love with each other for over a year. Who knows when you two would’ve gotten together if this whole mess hadn’t happened?  Just kiss and make up already.”
Thor looked at him dubiously. “I fly.”
“You okay?” Steve asked.
Suddenly all eyes are on Steve, and the Avengers visible stiffen where they’re standing.  They’ve all obviously known that someone would eventually ask Steve for his personal opinion, but that doesn’t mean any of them are
“It would appear that we are lousy at hiding," Tony remarks.
“Do you regret your actions?”
“Tony,” Steve says tiredly.
“Yessir.  I’m j-just finishing, sir.  Captain, sir,” the agent stutters, before hastily placing a bandage on Tony’s wound and leaving.
"They’re
Tony lets out a bark of laughter. “What?
Tony doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve this compassionate and thoughtful man in his life; he isn’t even sure if he’s really is worthy of the his love.  What Tony does know is that he’s going to spend the rest of his days making Steve as happy as he’s made him.
They were three simple little words that Tony had heard others say millions of times before— rarely
Steve slid his hands into his pockets. “I’m glad you enjoyed it, then.”
“I was just out cold for twelve hours, and asleep for a good seventy years before that, I think I’ve had enough rest for a while,” Steve said lightly.
Steve managed to charm his way into an early check-out from the hospital.  He had expected Natasha or one of the SHIELD cars to pick him up, so he was shocked to find Tony waiting outside by his Rolls Royce.  Tony wordlessly opened the passenger door and ushered him inside before Steve could so much as utter a ‘hello.’
“My friend is the one getting married, but she couldn’t make it out here today,” Tony continued.
“Me, too,” Steve agreed.  Between Tony’s company, Steve’s missions with SHIELD, local supervillains, and bi-annual alien invasions, it was hard for him and Tony to find any time together.  It was even harder to do anything without telling everyone else about the nature of their relationship.

“I’m really beginning to regret giving you that Polaroid,” Tony muttered.
"I’m sorry.”
He was mildly disappointed when Tony made no move to continue his earlier ministrations.
, Tony.”
They fall onto Steve’s bed together and it feels like they spend hours—even days—mapping every inch of each other’s’ bodies before Steve finally presses inside him.
Tony scowled. “Low blow, Ms. Romanoff.  Why don’t—Hey, why are you up here so early anyway?” he questioned. “I thought for sure you’d still be downstairs ripping shots with Coulson an—Oh.” Tony raised an eyebrow when he caught sight of Clint and Sam, both of whom were passed out on the floor.  Well, that solved the mystery of his supposed roommate. “Any chance you need help babysitting the two drunk birds?”
That immediately got Tony’s attention. “Dating?!” he exclaimed. “Steve and I aren’t dating!”
This was supposed to be a
“Shut
“Yes, Steve?”
“I had fun,” Tony said sincerely. “I honestly can’t remember the last time I enjoyed myself that much.”
“Of course, it’s necessary,” Tony said. “What kind of team would we be without a commissioned portrait of ourselves?”  Hands on his hips, he looked up at the painting with a strangely proud smile.  “Besides, I look pretty damn good in it.”
“Nothing to my knowledge.  I mean, I just
Tony knew she was right.  He had to try to patch things up with Steve, and if he didn’t do it tonight, then he probably never would.  If things went south… At least it was only for one night.
Natasha notices Steve emerge from the balcony.  He walks with purpose, not like the wallflower he usually plays at these functions.  She fully expects him to seek her out like he usually does: they often kept each other company while the rest of the team (mainly Tony) makes nice with the rest of the guests.
later, Steve would ask how Sam knew about that, but instead he told him: “Tony and I had sex.”
He wanted to tell someone—
Everyone laughs and he sets aside the stein, chastising himself.   What was he thinking?  Even if he could, he shouldn’t be getting drunk.
“Yeah, it could be our first team bonding thing.”
“Which one, sweetheart?” Tony asked, kissing Steve on the cheek.
“I wanted to apologize.”
At the end of Steve’s parents’ visit—and their parents’ disastrous meeting—Joe and Sarah invite Tony to spend the holiday back in their country.
“Sure, Tony.”
“Why are you baking a cake?” asked Pepper.
“I slept with Steve.”  It felt wrong to sum it all up in just four words.
He remembers waking up in the early hours of the morning as the first rays of sunlight shone through the cracks in the shutters and illuminated Steve’s hair, framing Steve’s face like a halo.
“You’re welcome.”

Originally a response to
“Tony?”
Tony vividly remembers the phone call to the star registry a very long time ago; he remembers the skepticism in the operator’s voice when he had told them the name he wanted:
So four months into Tony and Steve’s relationship—two months after their public confirmation of their relationship, and a month after their first outing together—Peggy decides it would be good for Steve to do an interview so other people can get a small glimpse of this “softer” side of Steve Rogers.
“What are you doing?” Steve asked with a frown, and god, Tony hated knowing he was the cause
Pepper asked, genuinely confused.
“Richards says they’re stuck in another dimension,” Tony informed as he surveyed the scene below him. “Spider-Man just finished up with a bank robbery, but he’s coming from Brooklyn, so who knows how long it’ll take for him to get here.”
makes Tony’s heart do somersaults in his chest.
Tony splutters and ducks his head, hiding his face behind his forearms. “It’s not—that’s not what this is... I—”
Steve couldn’t help himself—he leaned in and kissed him square on the mouth, relishing in the blush that spread across Tony’s cheeks when he pulled away. “Not a dream.”
“You know you can tell me anything, Tony—”
Tony seated himself in the plastic chair next to the bed and chose to scowl at the IV connected to Steve’s arm instead. “You have four broken ribs and a concussion.”
“Yeah, well, what good is the news if they won’t tell us anything about the actual people who saved the planet?” Tony says, trying to sound flippant.  “Yeah, every single government secret has been released to the public.  Big whoop.  It was bound to happen eventually.”
“That could change,” Tony said quietly.
Vanessa’s cheeks colored. “I’m so sorry, I just assumed—”
,” Natasha said. “Anything we ask you, we ask because you’re our friend and we care about you.”
“And we’re important?” she asks, arching a brow.
“We don’t conspire against you,” Pepper says exasperatedly.
“Did you know about this?” Steve asks.
“Honestly, you two probably have a good chance of working, but if he can’t see that, then he’s an idiot for walking away. One day, you’ll find someone out there who willappreciate

of all things.
“He isn’t interested in me,” Steve said, absently picking at a loose thread on the hem of his shirt.
Tony waved it off. “It’s fine,” he said, even when it clearly wasn’t. “I still appreciate it.”
he felt the need to do what he did.
Tony closes the distance between them and pulls him into his arms, while still mindful of Steve’s injuries.  He thinks he makes a mistake when Steve’s entire body stiffens upon contact, but just as Tony starts to pull away, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s back.  The magnitude of his feelings for Steve are so overwhelming that it takes all of his effort not to start sobbing then and there.
Steve picked up the puppy again and held it out towards Tony’s face. “I dare you to say ‘no’ to this face, Tony.  Come on.
“A few weeks,” Tony sighs. “Thor brought back some magical mead from Asgard that only gets you as drunk as you
He can hear Bruce trying
“Why not?”
“We finished the financials earlier than expected, so I ducked out,” Bucky informs. “I thought this would be a good opportunity to talk.  To you,” he adds.
“At him?”
“Nothing,” Tony replied. “I just thought you were a morning person.”
Their movie date ended up being cut short because Doctor Doom decided it was a perfect night for sending out his army of Doombots to terrorize the citizens of New York.
“So you spent twelve hours diving in Potomac to pass the time?” Sam asks incredulously.
“I don’t trust Clint with technology.”
“You are.”
?” Tony asks incredulously. “You do understand how difficult that is in our line of work, don’t you?  For all of us.”
“Better than yesterday,” Natasha replied, her eyes much softer than before. “He’s in his lab, if you wanna see him.”
“They were pretty cool,” Clint added, “I read them as a kid.”
“Or maybe you’re totally gone for that brunet who works behind the counter,” Bucky says as he walks through the door with a stack of folders in hand and a cup of coffee in the other.
“What are you insinuating, Rogers?”
Tony ground their hips together, and Steve bit down on his lip to keep from crying out from the jolt of pleasure. “Tell me what you want,” Tony said, fingers working at the button of Steve’s jeans. “I wanna hear you.”
Steve smiled in response and chastely kissed him on the mouth before finishing up his task.  He discarded the towel on the floor before getting back in the bed and pulling the sheets over them.
Thor finds out when he goes to the gym for his weekly sparring session with Steve.  He sees Steve and Tony wrestling on the mat, but doesn’t realize anything is amiss until a few minutes later when they start shedding their clothing.

Steve gave him a pointed look. “Do you now?”
With a sigh, Steve gestured to the bartender for another ginger ale.

“Natasha’s been trying to set him up on dates,” Sam supplies.
—but Steve figured this would be a good place to start.
“There wasn’t any more room at their table,” Pepper explained coolly.
Tony nodded, glad for the diversion. “Yeah, it was pretty great, but the theatrics tonight were incredible.  Kelli O’Hara was fantastic.”
Steve crosses his arms. “You’re one to talk, Stark—”

“Morning, Cap,” Tony idly greeted as Steve shuffled into the kitchen.

“You aren’t much better,” Steve mumbled under his breath.
they didn’t know about it.  (Then again, he couldn’t really hope for much when he lived with two spies, especially with one who never knew when to shut his mouth, and another who was an incurable gossip.)
It didn’t take long for Steve to feel that familiar wave of pleasure curling in his gut, intensifying with every slide of Tony’s cock, every touch from his fingers, and every kiss from his lips.  It built slowly, steadily, until Tony leaned forward and whispered a litany of praises in his ear, and Steve came.
“But—”
“It’s only addressed to you,” Steve points out after reading the memo again.
Pepper rolled her eyes.
Tony chuckles. “Damn right, I wouldn’t.”
,” Steve countered. “We made it work—”
He makes a phone call, and has the certificate sent to Steve’s brownstone in Brooklyn:
…and Steve was kissing him
Tony was sitting on the couch lazily flipping through the channels. “Don’t worry, there’s one of you and the rest of the team too.”
…and a couple sketchbooks filled with pages upon pages of Tony, but no one else really had to know that.
"Can you go with me to the restaurant just in case?  I could give you a signal if things are going well, and we could come up with another signal if you need to call the police, or—"
“You are,” Tony gasps, still coming down from the high of his orgasm, “s—so good at that.”
Steve peered at him curiously. “What?”
“I guess that’s my queue.”
“Remember a few months ago when the serum suddenly stopped working and you aged seventy years ?” Tony said, keeping his tone light. “Well, now you’re fifty.  I mean, I know it’s not thirty, but it’s better than nothing, right?”
“There’s gotta be oil or something in this hotel room we can use…” Tony heard Steve say.  There was some shuffling and the opening and closing of drawers, and when Steve re-emerged from the bathroom with a bottle of lubricant and a pack of condoms in hand, Tony could only gape—it suddenly made a lot more sense why the two women from housekeeping that Tony had run into that morning were giggling so uncontrollably.
In the twenty-eight plus years that Tony has been living on Earth, he had had one serious relationship with a business associate shortly after taking over Stark Industries, but that had crashed and burned within six months.
.” Tony tensed when Steve’s hand enveloped his own, and he came with a shout.
“You thought what?” Tony asked quietly, heartbeat a hammering staccato. He searched Steve’s gaze and then smiled a bit sadly. “You thought I’d changed my mind,” he supplied.
Steve fell into an easy friendship with Tony, and falling into a relationship with him seemed like the most natural thing in the world.
In the workshop, Tony is always in his element.  It’s where Tony gets his best ideas, and where Tony creates his most brilliant inventions.
,” he says slowly. “How could you not be allowed to tell
Steve shrugged. “To be fair, most of the dates I’ve been on were set up by other people.”
“What makes you think anything happened?”
“It didn’t mean anything!” Steve said quickly. “It was one time in Paris and it didn’t mean anything.  It’s fine.  I’m over it and—”
him–made Tony’s blood boil. “You have to know by now that I would never do that.”
“Back with me, baby?” Steve asked quietly, a teasing tilt to his mouth.
“I’m having a good time just talking like this,” Tony says, “I don’t see why we have to—”
“JARVIS?” Tony said into his phone. “Find me a hotel room within a forty mile radius.”
“I don’t think you’ve learned the meaning of ‘persistence’ until your buddy calls you while flying in a weaponized suit of armor to tell you about someone he met at a
…or would he?
it does not go well.
Tony’s eyes flick from the note to Steve’s face, which has taken on a rosy hue as well, and back down to the little slip of paper again.  He’s extremely grateful that he no longer has a heart condition because he can feel his heart practically hammering out of his chest.
He actually finds it pretty hilarious, except on nights like tonight where he finds himself being kissed by yet another young model or singer or rising businessman. .
“Why would he sleep with you if he wasn’t interested in you?”
Tony fought a smile as he half-heartedly pushed him away, but not before Thor snapped another photo.
"I would also like to kiss you,” he tentatively adds. “I mean, if that’s okay…?"
“I’ve been trying to court you for
What good was he if Tony—who Steve had sworn to protect until the end of his days—ended up having to save
He spit into the sink and rinsed out of his mouth before stepping into the shower.  He washed himself quickly and efficiently, drying off with a towel before hastily wrapping it around his waist and leaving the en suite.
Tony clears throat, trying to sound as authoritative as possible. “You have got a lot of explaining to do, Rogers.”
They talk (which is something that the two of them seem to be really good at with each other), get drunk, dance, and eventually go back to Tony’s place and hook up.
Steve tilts his head back, staring at the ceiling of the quinjet. “No, I guess not.” He glances over at Tony, an apologetic look on his face. “I probably shouldn’t have asked.  I’m sure it isn’t something you can uh, easily talk about.”
Tony turns to Steve. “I think it's time we get the team back together, don’t you?”
“Really?”
“Why?" Tony whines. "It’s just
Today’s mission had been a relative success, but there were still some casualties—six, to be precise, and Steve thinks it’s six too many.  He takes the elevator down to Tony’s workshop, keys in his personal code, and trudges through the sliding glass door.
“You idiot,” Tony says when he pulls away. “Why didn’t you say anything before?”
Tony suddenly has a feeling he’s being watched, and momentarily looks over his shoulder to see all of their friends watching them from the sidelines.
Tony continued his ministrations, not easing up even as Steve’s body tensed upon orgasm.  Steve growled Tony’s name in the aftershocks, broken and needy.
It makes Steve fall in love with Tony just a little bit more, and he kisses the man in lieu of a response.

any of this happen.”
Tony looks up from the contract in his hands to see Steve sitting across from him at the table, tapping away at his phone.  There’s a nearly-empty coffee cup by his elbow, and a sketchbook opened to a half-finished drawing of Tony’s hands, and Tony realizes that Steve’s been sitting there for the better part of the hour.
“I don’t care if you were kidding or not because that was still pathetic,” he said, ignoring Steve’s sigh. “Just shut up and start over.”
“I’d die before I let that happen.”
“Maybe a bit of both?” Steve offers.
“What would you have done?  What would
It isn’t until after his kidnapping and subsequent return to the states that Tony actually believes it’s a lost cause.  If Tony couldn’t trust the man who was his father-figure for over half of his life, what was he supposed to make of anyone else that tried to get close to him?  Stane had tried to kill him.  His own parents never paid a speck of attention to him.  His exes only stayed with him long enough to get what they wanted out of him.
"Mommy!" Peter called out, his whining intensifying when by the second when it seemed that Bucky won't let go of him; which caused Steve's lips to twitch up and let go of Bucky, rushing toward his baby who seemed better than he was a few days ago.
"Who Tony?" Pepper said alarmed by Tony's action, the scent of raging Alpha was swirling around the room suffocating everyone in the room, it made Clint fidget and look around the place, considering that he was the only Omega on the team it was justified.
"I… o-o-of c-course Ma'am!" Tony squeaked, shivering at the stare that promised him death and pain if he denies the scary woman anything; to Tony's relief, the scary smile went away and in its place return the chirping smile the ghost has when she first come to scare the living daylight out of him. "D-do you n-need me to p-prepare a room for you?" Tony stuttered, trying to stop himself from running away and jumping from the window and end this torture for once and for all.
"Of course Peter knows about his father, Bucky! I am not that cruel to hide from him that information." Steve said with a huff, returning to drying the dishes with a sad look, yes, Steve had made sure to tell his son everything about his father, Anthony Carbonell that is, the dorky scientist who loved them so much… not the self-proclaimed superhero Tony Stark…
Starkad though was feeling guilty, for only now he noticed his son who was sitting a little farther away from them, gazing at the Omega with teary eyes; the tears refusing to slide down his face, but Starkad noticed how the boy was clenching his hands in anger uncaring of his injuries; as the Alpha stood up, his movement seemed to snap Petrus out of his frozen statue and he too scrambled to stand, ignoring Braes's concern as he followed Starkad who adjusted the Omega in his arms until he was holding him tightly, not fearing that he will fall.
Steve made sure to roll the bed toward Tony's and with Jarvis's help the merged Tony and the pup's beds together lowering the bars, last Tony wanted to hold his child comfortably. Steve smiled when he saw how Tony's body relaxes when he smelled his child nearby, he turned to see Peggy and Howard looking at the doctors with dark looks, Howard was taking their names while Peggy was on the phone with someone, ordering them to do a full background check on the names Howard was saying out loud…
"We will beat him, mother, I know we will; Asgard shall not fall." Thor promised, his words strong and true, for even if the God of thunder was the last one left standing, he will do whatever it takes to protect the Ancient One from Thanos' clutches, whatever it takes. After all the Ancient One (Call me Steve) was his friend.
So what do you think?
Bucky walked around Queens shaking all the while trying to look for the address the AI gave mind going into overloads, he couldn't believe what he was hearing, he didn't want to believe what he was hearing, for the longest time, Bucky always imagine his meeting with Anthony Carbonell being one full of screaming and fighting, but now, now after the truth was all out, now when he learned about what happened, he doesn't know what to think… for as long as he knew Stark, he thought of him as nothing but a spoilt brat, a brat that should be grateful to have a father like Howard to stop him from doing anything stupid, but now… now he discovered that Stark was nothing but a victim... a victim like Steve, and no matter how much he wanted to paint Stark as the bad man… he felt like shit for realizing that he was trying to blame a victim who lost his mate and child because of his father.
"Teach me how to fight." Tony demand which made Steve look at the Omega up and down like he was sizing him, a small smile appears on his face when Tony growled at the Alpha taking a fighting stance, or what the Omega thought of as a fighting stance.
And yes, Tony is tall in this one, he is 6'6 while Steve is 6'3...
Tony pout at her words, only to give a devilish smile later, causing Betty to narrow her eyes, and for Bruce to snort and turn his attention to Steve, telling him about baseball scores and all that jazz. "Fine then, if you won't tell me, I will have to hack the clinic security system, which won't be fun by the way; oh, and I won't go to the infants' room as I promised." Tony shrugged his shoulders; the bored expression on his face was hiding the giddiness he was feeling on the inside.
So what do you think?
An old voice said, making Steven turn to old Philips as the man leaned on the bars looking at him, his head bandaged informed Steven that the hit he gained from Johann was harder than it looked, the old man's question made Steven pause at those words... what is he to say?
"You have nothing to explain, Mr. Stark, you did enough of that." Steve then walked away ignoring the Alpha that snapped out of his shock, all the while shaking on the inside as he heard Tony calling him with such a broken voice, that tears start running faster…
"I never used the stones, Loki." Steven ended up saying a confused look taking over his face at the prince's words, he had never used the stones, the only time he came in touch with them was when he picked them up from their timeline and later returning them to the same timeline, the only one who used them was Bruce who use the stones to return half of the universe that Thanos snapped, and Carol who used them to get rid of Thanos and his army, and let's not forget the cause of their problem, Thanos.
The small boy Fury just saw the small boy was the Omega's babe; the Omega who attack Tyber with no care for his wellbeing, the Omega that was strong enough that it needed four grown Alphas to be able to hold him back from strangling Tyber to death. The Omega with blond hair and familiar build to a friend long since died; the Omega that caused Tyber to pale and shake in his place as if Queen Hela stood in front of him ready to take him to Hel and torture him for eternity.
After walking around the place, and taking the sights, Steve then steers them toward the children's zoo, which ended up with Peter trying to pet every animal he sees, squealing when Steve put the bunny in his hands. And God, did Tony want a camera to photo how happy his baby was? It was the first time he saw his baby this energetic and happy, which made him happy. When it was sunset, Steve then took them to a small cozy Italian restaurant, and Tony had to stop a loud moan from leaving him at how delicious the food was. All the while Steve and Tony exchange pleasant conversation, from talking about the changes Tony saw, to the kind of movies that Steve and Tony liked.
"He didn't take it, are you happy now?" Howard snapped as he straightened himself glaring at Tony who let out a roar and nearly attacked Howard again if it wasn't for Maria pleading with him.
It took Tony a few seconds (Minute? Hours?) Before Tony finally, regain control of himself and when he finally did, he couldn't help but let a loud shriek of '
Poor Steve! At least we got to know a little about his past!
Tony hummed as he walked toward his favorite bakery, planning on surprising both Steve and Peter with something sweet today. Tony knows he should be back working, but meh, it wasn't like Tony didn't own SI, and if Tony wanted he could just retire any time he wanted and be a house Omega if he liked. But Tony wasn't like that, he loves his job, and love terrorizing the people working under him, besides if his father heard about him retiring, the man will probably think Tony was expecting and will cry in joy… which was an idea that Tony couldn't keep his mind off.
"I'm so sorry Tony, I should have warned you about Ty." Angie said as she came to check him over which caused Tony to give a small smile trying to reassure her which caused her to sigh tiredly. "Don't worry, I will make sure that he won't bother you again, dammit that lad to hell and back, it wasn't enough we had to put up with him drinking and making passes on people, now he is bothering you." Angie growled as she said that, turning to glare at the bar Ty went to.
"Steve…" Tony tried to say in a warning tone when Steve sat in front of him, on the opposite side of the grave; Tony's hope of being able to dash out of here was ruined when Steve send him that dangerous grin promising something horrible was going to happen. "You don't have to do this, please!" Tony hates pleading for anything, but if it will get him out of the cemetery; Tony will marry Rogers, right here right now!
OK, so here was the thing, Tony may or may not have a small, so small; so tiny that it doesn't exist (Huge) respect that turns to a crush on Steve. After the events of Ty (Something that brought him great joy, and made him sigh like a school girl every time he remembered it) Tony starts seeing Steve in a different light. The crazy Addams was an OK person when you get to know him better and Tony can finally admit that he can see what Bucky saw. (Even if he refused to admit it) So Tony admit, that Rogers wasn't really a bad person when he abandons all the Addams craziness behind him for five seconds; hell, he was half a decent person even while being an Addams (If he wasn't trying to kill or torture you) so maybe Tony misjudge him a little bit (Not). Anyway, what Tony was trying to say is that he was becoming more and more acceptant of Steve's crazy life as an Addams, what he wasn't accepted of was his supposed 'Friends' trying to off him for 'Seducing' Steve (When the hell did Tony even manage to do that when he spent half of his time running away from Steve?)
"Please don't…" Tony cut in whatever Sam wanted to say, taking a deep breath trying to calm himself before saying something that he will regret. "I'm fine; I finally made peace with, it so please don't… I don't want you to apologize for something that's done and can't be fixed." Tony's lips trembled as he forced these words out hoping that he won't start sobbing here and now.
At hearing the word 'Tired' Peter seemed to get quiet and his eyes seemed to widen in shock like he couldn't believe what he was hearing; for Peter tired meant only one thing and that was 'Sick'. "Is it… is it the Chickenpox? Our teacher said that it's Chickenpox season, and two kids from the second grad were already sent home because they were sick." Peter's eyes were wide, they even filled with tears at the thought of Harley being sick with chickenpox; thinking about it now, maybe it wasn't one of Tony's brightest ideas, telling his son about Harley being 'Tired'.
"Shush, there, there." James said as he laid his small hand on Petrus' back, humming whatever kind of song that came to him, trying to calm his fellow child down. Steven couldn't help but smile at the scene in front of him, this was a first; his child never taken to anyone if it wasn't young Philips or Angela, preferring to not interact with the village's children for they were close-minded people. It was a surprise, a pleasant one though; seeing his child taken with another boy, and his age too.
... he didn't know for what, but he knew it was mainly death, he wanted to die, he wanted to get rid of this strange world with its strange rules, and strange people…
Steven can see the curiosity in Thor's eyes as the fell on him, as well as the other Avengers, which caused Steven to give a small smile and a shrug. "I was earth's ambassador to the new Asgard, of course, I was taught Asgardian." Steven's words got a pout from Tony, then the small man narrows his eyes at Steven, ignoring Thor's cheers about Shield brothers and all that jazz.

"That's not what happened Rhodey." Pepper said as she took a step forward toward the Beta wetting her lips. "Howard… Howard admits to knowing about Tony's plan… he did something to the Omega, and he disappeared, Mr. Barnes said his family searched for the Omega for ten years with nothing… and… and Tony implied that the Omega was pregnant." Pepper said looking at Rhodey, only to see the realization painting his eyes.
It was when the last guest left that Steve was able to breathe in relief, his son was helping him with the dishes by taking them to the kitchen, at such a young age, and his baby showed him that he was the man of the house, it made Steve smile sadly and start cleaning the house, thinking about a way that will help him answering his son's question.
"Oh, it's OK, look if Winnie asked just tell her I reject you, it will be easier than trying to avoid her which will cause chaos." Tony said noticing how Bucky wince at that and nod his head in thanks before running out of the room, and nearly run back inside the house when Winnie's screams of James's name reached them… Tony really pities that Alpha…
As a star, Steve's role was to write the history and shine, lightening the way for the people who cross the space; a star's rule was to never tangle themselves with the affairs of the mortals' realm, they are to see how everything will come to an end and never interfere. When it comes to Anton though, when it comes to the person Steven loved with all of his beaten and broken heart, Steven can't help himself from tangling himself farther in Anton's life, protecting him from his foolishness. "Then we will do this together." Steve finally turned to Tony smiling at the inventor gently. "We will win together and if we lost we will do it together too. You don't have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, Tony, not when you have a family that will always have your back." Steve's hand reached up and held Tony's hand giving the inventor a soft squeeze of assurance.
Tony wondered in the back of his mind if he was going to die, he wondered if everyone was going to forget about him just like how they forget about Ty. "M… my M-Morgan…" Tony's breath hitched, he couldn't hear anyone, no sound was heard after Stane's terrified scream of pain disappeared, and Tony wondered if he was left alone… he doesn't want to die alone. A cold hand touched his feverish cheek, and Tony couldn't help but shiver at the coldness as his head was turned to the side. Blue, so blue, it looked so blue, these eyes that were gazing at him… it was the only thing Tony could focus on when he gazed at the person in front of him. "S-save her… save… m-my M-Morgan." Tony plea, hoping that whoever was holding him in their cold embrace will listen and save his baby, even if it meant that he will die, he wants his baby to survive.
Tony." Steve whispered as he thrust himself in Tony's neck, causing Tony to shiver pleasantly.
By the time, Tony's knot had gone down; Steve had managed to doze off. Steve felt the draw of sleep pulling him further as he snuggled closer to the man beneath him. He knew that at some point they'd need to talk this all over, but Steve couldn't hold back a smile as he looked up at Tony.
. Thought Steve to himself with a small smile, everything changed in the past forty years or so since he woke up from the ice, lots of things changed, for the better or worse, but the world was spinning and that was the important thing.
"I did!" Steven immediately spoke, standing up as he did that which made the Alpha's gaze fall on him as they darken. "I did, and you know I am right… Most people in this room did not have a choice but to serve under him or their families will be killed." Steven tense as he saw the narrow eyes of the Iron King, but the spark of interest… Steven was going to take advantage of it.
"It was Johann's…" Steven finally admits which caused the Beta's eyes to widen all the strength seemed to leave her as she gazed at her hands helplessly. "That foolish king could not touch me even if he tried which he did not, though, from what I have heard around, The Iron King is the kind of person who will kill anyone who takes pleasure from another without consent, charming is it not?" Steven informed Margaret, he can see the tears sliding down Margaret's face, and he felt more helpless than he did before when they didn't stop.
"Of course, Mr. Stark." The doctor agreed with a gentle look on her face and she turned to the machine, a few seconds later Steve was holding six small picture of his baby, which caused Steve to give a wide smile, a happy laugh wanted to be known as he gazed at the shape of the small peanut in the picture…
"Do you need to go?" Tony whine, a pout on his face as he helped his husband fold a few comforting clothes to put in his travel bag, as much as Tony wanted his husband to stay, he knew that his husband needs to go to DC, something about a new superhero character he had been working on for months now and finally finishing the draft for the first comic issue; still, it didn't stop Tony from acting like a child, mainly because he doesn't know what he was going to do if Steve left, or how Harley was going to act like when seeing his safety blanket leave him.
“Iron Man, did you call them?” Steve asked.  He, Clint, and Natasha had to rely on hand-to-hand combat since they were caught without any weapons.  Fortunately, they still had two heavy hitters: Thor could summon Mjolnir from any location, and Tony had been wearing his bracelets for his latest armor.  Bruce was trying to herd civilians away from the scene, refusing to unleash the Hulk unless absolutely necessary.
“You always say that.”
Upon returning to the tower, Tony and Steve parted ways and went back to their respective suites.
"Disappointed?!" Tony exclaims, mildly offended. "How could
He learned about Clint‘s adamant refusal to eat soggy cereal, and his preference for 2% milk.  He learned that Natasha liked to cut her spaghetti because of the mess that sometimes resulted in twirling it.  He learned that Thor has had an obsession with Motown ever since Erik Selvig introduced him to it (he likes to sing to The Supremes in the shower).  He learned that Tony drank a double-shot of espresso in the morning, a cappuccino in the afternoon, and a cup of decaf with cream and one sugar before bed.
JARVIS responds.
“I just want you to know how I feel,” Steve says, “I didn’t think it was fair for me to lie to you—or myself, for that matter.  And I know the last place I should be saying this is in the middle of a demolished building with a bunch of SHIELD agents swarming us, but I saw you fall from the sky and I just… I needed to tell you while I still had the chance.”
“I can do that,” he replies, before capturing Tony’s lips in a kiss.
,” he stated. “You have the serum, and while we can’t
Tony continued to hold him, even when his tablet chimed to notify him of a new e-mail.  Steve hoped it wasn’t too important.  He tried to squash the surge of guilt that pushed its way to the forefront of his thoughts, but it didn’t matter because Tony’s tablet chimed again.  Twice.
He knew exactly what he was getting himself into.
Steve gradually sped up his thrusts until the room was filled with the sounds of their breathing and the skin-on-skin slap of sex.  All Tony could do was try his best to hold on as Steve continued to take him apart.  His hands roamed over Steve’s arms, his shoulders, sliding across Steve’s chest and down his backside urging his movements.
for it, let alone Steve himself.
“Steve, is there any particular reason you’ve been frequenting that quaint little café around the corner?”
Thor took out his flask and poured some of the contents into his glass. “Are you sure you do not want any, Steve?” Thor asked.
“What reason have I ever given you to be scared about one of my surprises?”
“Good?”
come undone.
“And you won’t be doing any of us any favors by overworking yourself,” Steve said. “C’mon, you look like you need the rest more than I do.”
“I know my reputation often precedes me—and why wouldn’t it?  I was a jerk for most of my adult life, but I’m not that kind of guy anymore, and I—” Tony paused. “This conversation should really be going the other way.”
—and I… I could never thank you enough for that.”
“Tony.”
On their fourth date, Tony made Steve ask
He’s barely able to let out a “what the fuck?” before he’s blinded by camera flashes.  Of course, he chose
“I’m no better than you,” Steve says. “That’s why I…”  He sighs. “You’re always saying that you’ll never be as good as I am, but that’s just… That’s not true.”
“I’m sure, Steve,” Tony replied, “but don’t do it just because I’m asking you to.”
“Fancy meeting you here.”
