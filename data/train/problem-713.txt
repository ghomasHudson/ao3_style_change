“For making me think that poor John had been assassinated by our darling Hugh, but no matter he doesn’t look well does he, Sherlock?” Laura spat the last words out like bullets.
Sherlock waved her off, not wanting to admit out loud that John’s diagnosis lay stabbed in a pile of unsolved cases and unanswered letters—dead letters. He then took a thumb drive out of his pocket, fingering it before he inserted in his laptop, but before the laptop powered up he had to put in a call to Mycroft.
John’s eyes closed as he dug his fingers into Sherlock’s curly hair. “Yes, Sherlock you know everything.”
As Sherlock waved good-by, it would be the last time he would see his grandma and as if she sensed it she blew Sherlock a kiss and shouted out as loud as she could muster, ”Sherlock, I love you.”
Though Sherlock worked to keep his voice strong and clear, John could hear a tremor in it as he spoke, it reminded John of that horrible day that Sherlock had jumped off the roof of St. Bart’s. Tears poured down John’s face for he knew if he didn’t get help soon he would die. For a few moments John gazed into Sherlock’s eyes as if seeing him for the first and last time. The curly brown soft hair, the pale white skin, the chiseled cheekbones, the shinning blue-green eyes, these were only the physical attributes that made Sherlock beautiful. John sighed peacefully as he thought how irritated Sherlock would be if he knew that his intellect was the last thing that John considered to be an attribute of Sherlock’s. “Sherlock, I’m not going to make it. Please promise me you will leave immediately after I have drawn my last breath. Promise me.” John insisted as tears poured down Sherlock’s face. John hoped that Sherlock would do as he promised for John didn’t want Sherlock to see his mortal body go through the death throes. As John reached up to touch Sherlock’s face, his body grew heavy and cold in Sherlock’s arms. He looked up once more at Sherlock and then John smiled. “Sherlock…” John whispered as he fell back into Sherlock’s arms.
You throw your hands up into the air. “Sherlock, we need to talk. I love you and I have no intention of leaving you. The room you decorated for Alice is beautiful.”
I clear my throat. “I need a quiet place to think and some tea.” Then I step down from the platform and make my way to Mycroft, where I whisper in his ear. “I need you to find out if John, Anderson and Alice are safe.”
Doctor Shaw looked from one to the other, then sighed. “Yes, I’ll attempt to treat him, but at the first sign this new drug of yours is going south, I will report you.”
Sherlock winked at John as he said, “Yes, I have proven on many occasions that what’s inside is of utmost importance.”
“It’s in here,” he whispered and pulled a flashlight from within the folds of his coat. Without a word John wheeled closer and laid a hand on his arm. Sherlock enjoyed the touch for a moment or two, then proceeded forward.
“John now is the time. Follow my lead.” I command. I then unbutton my shirt. The moonlight glints off of my nipple ring. I pull a crack pipe out of my pocket and light it up. It’s just tobacco. I take a long drag. Then I hand it to you. My eyes never leave your face as your lips enclose around the mouth piece. You cough and sputter, then hand the pipe back to me. I snatch it from you. I want to taste your saliva that lingers on the metal. I look at you again. The men are upon us. I put the pipe down. Then I take your face between my hands and kiss you. I only withdraw my lips long enough to whisper in your ear. “John, go with me on this.”
My hands are shaking so bad that it becomes apparent to both of us I need help. “Sherlock, I think I’m going to have to…”
I read the message again and again. John will be home in two weeks. I stand outside on the side walk and take a deep breath. The London air is crisper, the traffic less noisy, the world is right again. John. A cab whooshes by, making the tails of my coat flutter in its wake. Once again a heaviness settles over me.
The thought of you gasping in my arms is a thought I dare not linger on. I could make you fall in love with me dearest John. I really could if I tried. Then all my attention would be focused on you. If I could burn you to ashes and then raise you up like a Phoenix I would. The risk is too great. Like Icarus we would both plummet to our death-the sun too bright for us to handle. The pain of unrequited passion makes my stomach cramp up. I shake. I roll off the bed and onto the floor clutching my head in my hands. You are at my side.
“I want to lean into you, but I don’t. Instead I rattle my handcuff, making it slide back and forth with such force that you beg me to stop.”
Clare stood beside John. “John, do you remember the conversation we had in the cab?” John nodded, not making eye contact. Clare’s eyes mirrored grief.  “John, you need to decide who you are going to give your black card to.” Without hesitation John reached into the pocket of his robe and handed the black card to Sherlock. Sherlock took the card; it was still warm from the heat of John’s body.  His Doctor, friend, lover, his heart, had handed him a black card. If John realized his potential and awakened as a killer similar to a Yoma, Sherlock was obligated to kill him.
John laughed and said, “So you want to hear an old joke? If it’s so beautiful down there…” “What are you doing up here?” Sherlock and John said in unison as they both laughed together.
The gallery owner, who he had solved a fraud case for a few years earlier greeted Sherlock with open arms, “Sherlock, come in, come in, I just sold another one of your women.”
I flick some water at him, attempting to lighten the blow I have just given him. “Stop, you’re going to make me hard and they’re all dead anyway.”
John looked at the intricate details of the painting’s seaside town and felt as he could reach out and touch the water of the shoreline. Sherlock’s grandma watched John intently for a few moments and then said, “Sherlock, is an artist and a critic; therefore every time he creates, the critic in him tears his art down. He is always attracted to the case he hasn’t solved, the art he hasn’t tried, the person he hasn’t met. It makes me afraid for Sherlock, for everything comes so easy to him that I am afraid that one day he will be put to the test. Life will present him with a bill that will be a high price to pay.”
“I’ve got your number, you little shit,” John said as he held me tighter. “You wanted a reaction from me. So, fine I will surprise you. Just be careful what you ask for, Sherlock,” John hissed as he pulled on the back of my hair until I yelped.
I sigh. “Too bad, next time think it through. We could have had mind-blowing sex after getting high.”
I smile the day is looking up. When I get to the scene there are mobs of reporters, cops, and ghouls. I duck under the police tape and head towards Lestrade. Just before I make it to him a motorcycle skids to the side of me and rights itself. As the rider takes off his/her helmet I say, “Nice riding.”
He felt his heart begin to pound. “Just tell me.” He listened while she explained what the different colors meant on the scan.
“How can he switch gears so quickly?” John thought as Sherlock rambled on about his creative process of painting. “Doesn’t he care about my feelings at all? Do I not arouse him, please him, and titillate him? Oh, God worse yet, do I bore him?” John thought in despair.
John shook his head in frustration, at not being able to obtain the information Sherlock wanted as well as the closeness of his proximity for he could feel Sherlock’s body heat and John became so overwhelmed by the stimulus that the hair on the back of his neck stood on end, as he self-consciously rubbed the base of his skull.
The whole situation was surreal and Sherlock found himself wishing for a plain simple murder. “How are we supposed to help her?” Sherlock asked. For the first time he found himself way in over his head without a single idea.
John attempted to sit up, then lay back down. “Was that an actual bit of gross sentimentally Mr. Holmes?”
I expect your eyes to be full of hate and anger. They aren’t. “Sherlock, you just don’t get it do you?”
He looks at me says nothing, then leaves. A few moments later, he comes back with a rotary phone, a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He plugs the phone into an outlet along the wall, then steps back. “Now, get to work.”
Knowing that I have his full attention, I slowly take the cherry out of my mouth letting it drag along my lower lip. I smirk when Anderson jumps as it makes a plopping sound coming out. My lips curve up in a wicked smile as I take the straw from my drink and attach the cherry to the end. I scoot over to Anderson smile again, plunging the sex toy I have made down his back, pausing past the band of his pants. Anderson swallows, his breathing is coming out in short pants. Without mercy, I pulse the cherry between his cheeks.
“When the state turns her over to him, I suppose he’ll…leave…Baker Street.” He then pulled his coat around him as tight as it would go.
I stroke the side of his face. “One case that stands out in my mind is the case of the dismembered barrister.”
Sherlock ignored a shrieking female voice as he bent down and retrieved an object that lay just outside their front door. After he shut the door Sherlock looked over at John and said, “What was that John?”
Sherlock frowned. “John, I am beginning to think that perhaps that hit on the head did more damage than we initially thought.”
“Because, dearest John, music is the first outlet that I learned to express myself in. Every sweet note is my love song to you. You are the embodiment of this beautiful concerto,” he breathed, while he mouthed his way down John’s stomach, delighting, when the muscles twitched under his tongue. John pulled his hair, moving his head in time with the gentleness of the slow tempo, each movement timed to perfection, each lick a masterful technique that led to his Doctor’s climax, a salty liquid crescendo that he swallowed down with ease.
John smiled as he moved his hands a little lower, giving Sherlock some finger action. “I said whom does the house belong to? I mean you know so many people, it’s hard to keep up.”
We settle on a small place around the corner. The food choices are extensive and I watch you and Anderson over the top of my menu.
Sherlock continued to move his fingers, hiding the movement from Hugh as he spoke. “Don’t confess yet. Go along with Laura as if you are going to kill John. That will give us some time to figure out who is really behind all of this.”
By the time Sherlock, joined John in bed he was somewhat calm, only losing his composure when his cold hands touched the warm skin on John’s stomach. Once again Sherlock’s face turned red as his breathing became ragged and uneven.
Sherlock’s body was quivering all over by this time. Like taming a wild horse John spoke softly to Sherlock, “Sherlock, we better get back to the room.”
John laughed. “Sherlock, for someone who is so brilliant, you don’t hide your intentions very well.”
He looked exasperated. I stared into John’s blue eyes watching the pupils as they dilated in contrast to his changing physiology. He still had me pinned and I began to feel trapped. “Get off me,” I shouted in a panic.
I awake, feeling like Scarlett O’Hara after Rhett took her up the stairs. Anderson throws off the covers, smiling when he looks down and sees the morning wood I am sporting. “Nice,” he says, then begins to work at dispatching it.
“I’m not going to repeat it again. John is bringing a baby home. Now chop, chop help me clean this mess up.” I demand.
Sherlock picked his way through the debris that littered the hallway until they reached a dark room at the end of the corridor. He stopped and took a deep breath. Only the crunch of John’s wheels on the broken glass kept Sherlock from running.
The cab ride home was pretty quiet. Sherlock was lost in his own thoughts until he felt John shift closer to him. John slid his hand under Sherlock’s thigh and whispered in his ear, “A penny for your thoughts, Detective.”
Elsa ignored the tone of self-pity in John’s voice, “John, hurry I’m frightened.” She said and then the phone went dead.
“No,” Sherlock thought, “I can’t let him distract me." John, we need to talk about what happened tonight.”
Your face is white and for a moment I fear you have been shot too. Then you reach up to pull me down. Dearest John you are too late. A bullet nicks my collar bone, separating a section of my wool coat, flesh fills the once clothed area, blood sprays onto my neck as I sink to the ground. If an artery’s hit, I will be dead in seconds. You cover my wound with your surgeon’s hands. “Sherlock keep your eyes fixed on me, focus goddammit.” You say. I smile at the irony of your command. ‘Juxtaposition,’ is the last word that goes through my mind.
He stood before him, smiling when the sun glinted off his golden hair. “John, I’ve come to give you your medicine.”
John caught Sherlock’s hand in his own. “There is something else I am craving, even more than rest. In fact, I…”
I open my mouth to insult him and then clamp my lips shut. I’m lonely and cold. I don’t want to be alone. “Join me?” I say and then turn over.
I lick my lips. I can still taste Anderson on them. “I need to think and I need someone to take notes for me. Anderson are you coming?”
John let go of Sherlock’s wrist and turned away. He then turned around and took Sherlock’s pulse again. “You want to be screwed hard? You’ve been bad? Sherlock you have tested me for the last time,” John said as he ripped the rest of the covers off of Sherlock. He jerked Sherlock up to a sitting position and ripped off his robe. “You still want it hard?” John asked harshly.
When she stopped, Sherlock almost ran into her. “He’s in here, but you can only stay a few minutes.”
“Wait, put on some loud music,” I say just before you put on a rubber glove. “No, wait put on Sweet Dreams by the Eurythmics; it will help me distance myself.”
By the time they reached the flat, Sherlock was lucid and livid. “Mycroft, how could you have taken him there? I just needed a little boost to help clarify things in my mind and now you’ve put my husband at risk. Just look at his knee; its bleeding.”
Century. When the portal opened up between our worlds the Golem and Clare came into our world and Rathery’s mate when into theirs. Poor baby,” John crooned as he softly patted her side. She was a magnificent creature and even in the small pool of light from their flashlights her green iridescent scales glowed. Her large purple eyes regarded each of them in turn, until they finally rested once more on John. John’s eyes mirrored her sadness as he looked back at Sherlock and spoke softly. “We have to help her. She will die without her mate.”
The woman looked down at Sherlock, there was a slight sting and then the fluid poured through his veins. Sherlock waved the woman away as the room began to spin. He tied his belt around the head board and pulled at it, arching his body upward every time the drug forced its way through his system. “God, what a glorious buzz,” Sherlock thought as he sighed and arched his body again. It was at this time that John walked through the bedroom. “What are you doing?” John yelled, as he ran over to examine Sherlock. John looked into Sherlock’s eyes and asked,”Sherlock, are you high?”.
John did as Sherlock asked and then it was time to wait. “This was the worst and the best time,” Sherlock thought as he struggled to control his breathing. “I have no idea if John will be able to control himself or not.” Sherlock whispered to himself as he tested the strength of the hand cuffs by pulling up on them.  Then Sherlock waited and waited. Had John forgotten about him? For a moment Sherlock felt lost. What if John was gone? “John,” Sherlock called out in panic.
I look at you, dearest John, you are sitting on your haunches in front of me. One hand is placed on my knee, the other on my arm. I smile at you, then look down at the floor, losing myself in the debris on the linoleum, a crumb from a child’s biscuit, a strand of hair, a drop of coffee, lint, a facial tissue, small scraps of paper, mucus, a spot of blood. The spot of blood grows, threatening to swallow me in its gigantic sink hole. The smell of copper makes me gag.
“Hitchcock? You keep bring up Hitchcock. Could it be that you are thinking of something else?” Sherlock asked as he moved towards John.
Sherlock waved him off as if he were a bothersome insect. “Whatever, I’m not interested in your mundane little chores.”
John shook Sherlock roughly. “Come on Sherlock, wake up.” John shouted frantically to no avail for Sherlock had lost consciousness.
“John, how’s the research going?” Sherlock asked as he leaned over John’s shoulder to look at the computer screen.
“I want to say something. What…WHAT? Oh, John we are both blind. We see but we do not deduce. We dare not deduce. I then rest my head against your arm. As I fall asleep I hear you and Mycroft auguring about my treatment. I smile for you are with me-John.”
I look straight ahead; my eyes fixate on the drug addict next to us. Our eyes meet in understanding. I take a deep breath. “Come on John, back to Baker Street.”
Anderson kneels on the ground, heedless of the wet bath mat beneath. “Sherlock, I’m so sorry. Let’s make them pay. I will torture them one by one.”
I keep him on his side by holding his arms in a firm grasp. I don’t want him to further injure his back. “Fuck, Anderson this turns me on. Why did you do it, to impress me?”
“John, where is our next port of call?” Sherlock asked not breaking his gaze as it bored into John’s eyes.
Sherlock awoke with a sense of peace. He would be released from hospital today. He would play the game, the contrite brother for Mycroft, the loveable tenant for Mrs. Hudson, and the evasive friend to Molly, all so he could accomplish his real goal—the kidnapping of John. John and he would escape to a small country estate that had been deeded to him lieu of a fee and John would get better or they would both die. With the help of Wiggins, he procured a burner phone, a full chemistry set and the drugs he would need to tailor an anti-depressant, specifically to fit John’s needs. The only thing on his list that was missing was a therapist.
The nurse nodded sadly for they both knew he was lying, as John smiled in assurance at her the nurse wavered for a moment or two and then with a gentle nod from John she bolted away from him, lest she become too immersed in his world of sadness, for no one wants to be reminded that his or her life could become tragically altered in a second. John watched her scurry past the window, through the falling snow, her figure briefly illuminate by the red tail lights of the medical transport van. A young man bounded in through the front doors, looked around for a few moments and then as soon as he spotted John he came trotting over.
“Sherlock,” John gasped into between gulps, “Don’t do that, don’t restrain yourself. Here let me guide you,” John grunted as he moved his hands firmly to Sherlock’s lower back. Sherlock let out a yelp of pleasure when John pulled his lower back up so that he moved deeper into John’s mouth. Sherlock felt as if he were in a surreal dream world as his body began to tense followed by a type of lightness that he only experienced when John made love to him. After his release, Sherlock lie in John’s arms and let the feeling of sweet nothingness take him.
By the time Sherlock wheeled John up to the check in counter his hands were shaking with need. The clerk ambled on until Sherlock grabbed him by the shirt front and thrust a credit card at him as he snapped, “Room key, NOW.”
A few hours later John came instantly awake. “Someone else was near,” he thought as he reached for his sword.
Sherlock looked back at John again, his eyes pleading, his integrity shattered, “John, will you marry me?”
A few days later and Sherlock was pushing John up a wheelchair ramp to the ship, his eyes flashing angrily at anyone who attempted to ogle at them with pity or curiosity. Once they were in their state room Sherlock helped John into the double bed and then took him in his arms as they reviewed the facts of the case.
This time was different John didn’t check with Sherlock at all. Gasping with pain and pleasure Sherlock thought if he died tonight he wouldn’t care, after all he and John would be together in whatever after life there was, so what would it matter if his mortal body died. His heart was soul were tied to John forever.  New physical sensations threatened to overwhelm Sherlock’s ability to process each event, until finally Sherlock let himself be dominated by John. “How ever did John learn how to do all these wonderful things?” Sherlock thought just before he passed out.
Feeling embarrassed Anderson shuts his legs. I pry them open, none too gently. I sit up and smell my hand. “Anderson, your scent is delightful.”
Sherlock had eyes for no one else as he looked into the face of the marvelous human being which sat before him. “John, I love the taste of you. I am fraught with anticipation at the thought of having you to myself back at Baker Street.”
Sherlock walked over to where the Asian woman and Clare were. “What is your name?” Sherlock asked softly.
Doctor Dunkle stared into Sherlock’s eyes and when Sherlock didn’t look away he laughed. “Sherlock, you just don’t get it do you?”
Sherlock nodded and walked over to the crime scene and took some photos with his phone. “I will look further into this matter Lestrade, however I think we can chalk it up to an episode of gang violence.”
Sherlock and John rode in a horse drawn carriage through the little town on the French Riviera and as they reached the top of the hill, Sherlock had the carriage stop. “Look how beautiful it is down there,” Sherlock said as he smiled at John.
Mycroft smiled in a placating way. “Undocumented as it applies in this instance is when a work of antiquity has been taken from a tomb without proper records. For example, many tombs were plundered by treasure hunters heedless of where the items came from, they were ripped from their sepulchers only to reside in an English Manor House, undocumented.”
By this time tears were pouring down Sherlock’s cheeks. “John, it doesn’t matter now. What’s done is done.”
Sherlock ground his teeth. “Let me say this slowly so that even you can grasp it. I neeed to speeak to Angeeela now.”
John was about to reply and then frowned. “Clare, did you hear that?” John asked as Clare nodded in agreement.
John sat up like a small child that had taken a very long nap, rubbed his eyes, and then looked over at Sherlock and smiled, “Sherlock, what is it?”
Marco patted Sherlock on the shoulder, “Aw, my dear Sherlock, the art process is a painful one, is it not?”
John sighed and said gently, “The Doctor said I could resume my full routine of activities. So, what do you think that means?”
Sherlock’s expression grew serious as he ran his fingers across John’s forehead. “John, you are the most innocent person I know. You could never be guilty of anything.”
Sherlock was awakened by a shriek and the sound of shattering glass. John was already out of bed in his robe, with sword in hand.
John shrugged. “Who knows, I don’t feel any different, so what does it matter? Once we find the Golem, Clare can go back home and nothing will have changed. Sherlock, why all the questions? What’s bothering you?”
I awake to my phone ringing. I sigh, untangle the rubber tie around my arm and answer the phone. It’s Lestrade.
Sherlock could hear Mrs. Hudson clattering around in the kitchen. He followed her and put a gentle restraining hand on her arm. “No, tea, no biscuits,” Sherlock said as he took the empty tea kettle out of her hand.
“Sherlock, everything is going to be okay. I will be with you every step of the way,” John says as he fingers my boney wrist.
Sherlock chewed on the inside of his cheek. “We’ve got to find that witness.” Sherlock grabbed John’s arm. “Come on John; let’s get back to the flat. I have an idea.” Without another word Sherlock and John got into the next available cab and left.
His hand reached between my legs and that’s when he pulled away. “Nothing, you feel nothing do you? You’re just playing with me aren’t you?” John’s voice was harsh, his lips clamped shut in a tight grimace. “Well, you’re not out of the woods yet. See what you have done?” John shouted as he pushed his hardening groin to my side. Even through his jeans I could feel the heat, the moisture, the pulsating impaction of his lust. Then without another word, he began to thrust his pelvis against mine. I pushed out a puff of air every time he slammed into me. He worked the strictures in my libido until everything was free flowing.
John started to get angry and then joined Sherlock in laughter. “We are docking today. How would you like to go ashore and meet a lady?”
John looked down at Sherlock’s glazed expression and sighed. “Come on, Sherlock, we need to train. We’ve already missed breakfast. I know you don’t like to eat, but I do. We don’t have time to play,” John said sternly and then sighed when Sherlock continued to stare up at him. “Okay, fine but it’s got to be quick and no getting undressed.” John said as he kneeled next to Sherlock. “Let me show you one of the attributes of these wide legged pants,” John said as he rolled up the pant leg, so that he could easily get to Sherlock’s groin. Sherlock gasped for air as John stroked him gently at first and then firmer, and then, “Oh God, harder,” Sherlock begged as he thrust his pelvis into John’s hands. John tried to make things last longer for Sherlock but when John observed Sherlock’s intense facial expressions and quicker heart rate, he knew it was time to help Sherlock finish.
As if reading his mind John walked over and pulled Sherlock into his arms and kissed him deeply. Sherlock felt his knees go weak as John’s tongue explored the inside of his mouth. John put his arms around Sherlock’s waist to steady him and then John winked at Sherlock. “We’ll continue this mode of discussion later.” John whispered into Sherlock’s ear.
Mrs. Hudson came over and gently put her hand on Sherlock’s arm, “Sherlock, dear come, sit down and rest, you look terrible.”
We decide to stay on in Prague for the holidays and for the first time in my life I am happy. The love of you, dearest John and Mary keeps me safe, makes me whole. A fear, a premonition claws at my sub-conscious like an evil bird of prey. I ignore it. When I shiver you hold me tighter.
“Help, Help, I’m stuck,” the boy cried out as Sherlock and John approached him. Sherlock was the first to reach him, but had no luck disentangling him as he pulled on his legs.
Jake started to say something derogatory, but stopped short. “I need to save my breath,” Jake thought as he huffed and puffed after Clare and Rathery.
“He’s jealous,” John thought gleefully as he shamelessly began to flirt with the woman. She laughed at everything he said until John realized that it must be out of pity because of the chair. Instantly, John retreated back in his shell as he replied to an especially salacious remark. “That might be difficult seeming I’m in a wheel chair, it’s not very sexy the chair…I mean.”
Then we tussle a little. When your hand grazes my ring, I cry out and hit the floor. Your deft fingers soon have my shirt off. You stare at my white marred skin in horror. Your eyes fixate on the ring-the symbol of caduceus. “Sherlock, Sherlock,…” You whisper as your voice trails off.
Without a word Anderson walks over and sits on the bench. His eyes take on a faraway look. He then looks down and begins to play, the Adagio from Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto. Each note breaks through my emotional barriers. His playing is wondrous. My eyes fill with tears. I hear Beethoven, but I see John, I see Mary, I see Redbeard, I see the Woman, I see everything I have loved and or lost. I want to tell him to stop, but I am transfixed by the beauty and pain of the music. I am mute, rendered powerless, unable to disarm him with sarcasm or cruelty. I want to shout that he is the cruel one for making me feel, but I cannot. I have allowed him to get under my skin, the fly in the genius of my ointment.
Sherlock sighed. :”John, let’s not engage in idle speculation. We can all be ready in a few moments.” Sherlock said as he answered for all of them.
John made his way down the narrow hall to where Sherlock lay in a bed that looked like a giant round purple cushion. “How lovely he looks,” John thought as he watched Sherlock’s curled up form in fascination.
Once they got back to the cabin Sherlock wouldn’t meet John’s eyes as he paced back and forth. “There’s something about this case that’s bothering me John. Something to do with Elsa and Laura, it’s…”
John watched Sherlock’s lips as he talked and then placed his index finger on Sherlock’s lower lip. “Oh, I wouldn’t say that Mister Holmes.”
Their plan to take Laura down had failed. As if reading his mind Laura gestured to a group of Bedouins and barked orders to them in their native tongue. When one of them approached Sherlock and attempted to take John from him, Sherlock pulled out a gun. “Stop, Sherlock, let the Bedouin take him to a tent where he can be cared for properly.” Laura ordered.
She laughed and stuck her hand down Sherlock’s pants. “You are so white like ivory, except for one thing, you know?”
“Sherrinford,” Sherlock whispered, “that’s one of the things John keeps babbling on about. How does he know about my sister?”
Laura leaned forward and put her hand on John’s arm, letting it linger there for far too long, “John, you are going to love our little game. I’ll come by for you around midnight,” she said as she ran her index finger over John’s lower lip. “That husband of yours is a fool for leaving you unattended for if you were mine I wouldn’t let you up for air.” Satisfied with John’s shocked expression, she smirked, took Devin’s arm and then the two of them slinked out of the dining room like a couple of Siamese Cats.
“He’s changed since Mary’s death. He doesn’t want to come back to Baker Street. I turned my drug den into a bloody nursery for Christ’s sake. The blue lights to find my veins are gone. I painted the walls and bought a crib but the worst of it is that I can’t get Mary’s cold dead stare out of my mind. She’s dead and John left me alone to grieve.”  I am sobbing and shaking.
John looked up at Sherlock with sleepy bedroom eyes as he said, “Don’t worry Sherlock. Everything will be fine.”
He picked up the phone, smiling the condescending smile he always did when Sherlock called. “Yes, brother mine? What is it?”
John stood behind Sherlock as the cameras blinded them both, after a few shots, John excused himself on the pretense of a special engagement. As he moved past Sherlock, Sherlock lightly touched his arm and even though his touch was light, it felt as if John’s arm had caught fire, as he put his hand over the place in an attempt to memorize the feeling of Sherlock’s touch on his arm. John looked through the crowd and waved as he spotted Sharon. Before he made his way over to where Sharon waited for him, John spared one more backwards glance at Sherlock. Sherlock caught his eye and even though he was being swallowed up by the crowd, Sherlock maintained eye contact with John as long as he could.
“Sherlock, carry me up. Will you?” John’s voice made the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck stand on end. “That is if you’re not too tired.”
“John, what are you waiting for? I’m really starting to feel uncomfortable.” Sherlock gasped, as he forced himself up against the head board of the bed.
Mrs. Hudson watched Sherlock, while he rested his chin upon his slim prayer positioned fingers. “He’s up to something,” she whispered to Molly.
Sherlock heard him walk down the stairs, knowing each creak on each step, even before John’s foot touched it. Then bang the front door slammed. Sherlock moved in a 45 degree angle, so that he could watch John’s departure.  Just like clockwork John crossed the street at 45 degree opposite from Sherlock’s position at the window. “Two 45 degree angles= a 90 degree angle. The 10 percent must be the break-even point in the middle,” Sherlock thought as he watched John disappear from sight.
John laughed and then grunted when Sherlock’s tongue found a sensitive spot. “We’re both going to scream.”
The cab ride home is quiet and I don’t wait for it to come to a complete stop before I jump out and run up the stairs to the bathroom, where I slam the door shut and take a cold shower. The cool water invigorates my mind and squelches my libido to a point where I feel sane again.
Sherlock slipped off his shirt and stood before John. John didn’t back up as Sherlock stepped into his personal space.
I love Mary but I’m still not comfortable with showing her the depth of my desire for John. She rolls her eyes, kisses me and then John. “I’m going for a morning run. Then I’m going to get my hair done and buy an outrageously priced dress for the opera tonight. What color should it be?”
Lestrade cleared his throat, “Well, thanks for taking the case, Sherlock; it’s for a close friend he wanted it handled discretely so I wanted the best, the best detective. Well, I’ll e mail you the details…” Lestrade waited for an acknowledgement from Sherlock and after a few moments of silence he cleared his throat again as he said, “Right, then I’ll see you later.”
“Thought of what?” John asked. He was starting to get exhausted just watching Sherlock’s energetic moves.
John’s voice was childlike as he answered, “I had a dream that when you jumped from the roof of St. Bart’s you were really dead. You never came back and that even now you are just a ghost-a specter-a figure of my imagination.” John whispered.
“Umm, just as I said,” I state in a haughty tone as I walk down the hall to the bathroom. Anderson follows me and then runs into me when I stop abruptly. For some reason I want to rub my bum across his crotch until it hardens. I stop just short of this with my hand on the door knob. “Are you coming?” I ask in a teasing voice.
He looks away. He doesn’t answer me. I find his silence unnerving. Then he pulls the piano cover over the keys. Its clamping sound reminds me of a coffin lid closing. His head is still bowed. “Sherlock, why are you here?”
John answered this time. “I have no idea. After we surrendered our weapons the Golem knocked us out too.”
John looked into her dark green eyes and flushed under her scrutiny, “I was just thinking about a case I had in medical school.”
Sherlock sat up and began to rub his legs to get the feeling back in them; after the tingling pain subsided he crawled over to where John was sitting up watching his slow progress with a worried frown on his face. He then reached out and pulled Sherlock to his side. “Sherlock, you’ve been crying. What’s wrong?” John asked softly as he slowly ran the outside of his hand along Sherlock’s tear stained face.
John bit back his report as Mrs. Hudson ushered an Asian man into the kitchen. “He says he was expected. Next time you need to answer the door yourself. I’m not your housekeeper or your butler.” Mrs. Hudson chided cheerfully as he cleared away the small biscuit plates. She then turned toward their guest. “Would you like some tea and biscuits, dear?” She asked warmly.
I surprise myself when I speak first. “He sacrificed himself for me. Everyone does that at some point, don’t they? Be the hero. Save Sherlock. I abused him in every sense of the word and now he is going to die.”
John sat listening to “St. James Infirmary,” and as Hugh Laurie belted out the sad, seductive words, John couldn’t help thinking of a particular nasty autopsy he had performed while in medical school. It had been a supposedly accidental death, but John wasn’t convinced and so subsequently was haunted by the cold, white body of the woman that lay on the slab, for John’s findings were ignored due to the fact he was just a student. “Sherlock could have solved it,” John thought as he inwardly sighed.
John blushed looked away and then said, “Right, then, the fingers…Umm..the victims appear to be male and female, with no random pattern.”
Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson stood watching Sherlock and John through an observation window. “They look so happy,” Mrs. Hudson commented. “Where do you think, they are?”
“Save the sentimental clap trap, Doctor Watson.” Then he paused. “I love you too, John, more than life itself.”
When Sherlock regained consciousness, Clare had her claymore poised and ready to hack the demon’s head off, Jake stood on the other side with a crossbow pointed at the monster’s heart and Lestrade had picked up the harpoon and was making menacing gestures at the creature. Sherlock sat up and crawled over to the monster’s side, the sound of its piteous whining noises overcame Sherlock, and he didn’t bother to brush away the tears that flowed from his red-rimmed eyes.
And as the music began to crescendo to its apex, John saw a figure making its way through the shadows towards him. John had positioned his wheelchair firmly against the wall of the bar and as the shadowy figure came closer, John could tell it was not Sherlock, but neither was it Elsa. There was nowhere for John to wheel to, so he locked the brakes firmly and let his fingers trail over the place where Sherlock had pulled back so hard on the brakes of his chair that the rubber was sliced open. “What do you want?” John asked in a voice much stronger than he felt. Silence, there was nothing said by the figure and John had the surreal impression that he was in some sort of Mummy Grade B horror movie.
Reluctantly, Sherlock pulled himself away from John’s embrace, not minding when a long string of saliva that connected then lengthened and then snapped away leaving a bead of moisture on John’s lower lip.
“How cute he’s embarrassed,” John thought as he looked down at the ground. After a few moments of silence John decided to give Sherlock a break and he changed the subject as he held his hand up to inspect his ring. “This is really quite lovely, Sherlock, thank you.”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut in order to block out the emotions that threatened to overwhelm him. The Doctor approached Sherlock after he had filled a syringe. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open, dreading what was coming next. The Doctor’s cold hands upon his arm, the thump of a vein with his index finger, the smell of rubbing alcohol, the prick of the needle, then bliss followed by terrifying nightmares.
Sherlock looked at the woman and John in disgust as they howled and pulsed inside each other. “Fine,” Sherlock thought as he approached the side of the bed and announced. “John, ready or not here I come.” Sherlock said as he positioned himself behind John and got to work. Somehow Sherlock got through it but he hated the three way, it was so messy and noisy. Maybe it was because he wasn’t in the middle; because John seemed to be enjoying it for Sherlock recognized John’s moaning as he experienced orgasm. Sherlock had no such luck and just lay curled up afterwards on his side. He had almost forgotten the real purpose of this whole act and as John lay there pulsing and shuddering; Sherlock propped his head up on one elbow and ordered the woman to get her clothes on and get out. After the woman left, Sherlock straddled himself over John and actually felt a pang of jealously as he watched John grow soft again. There was something about John experiencing the process with another person that made Sherlock angry. “The least he could have done was to fake it,” Sherlock thought viciously as he jabbed the needle into John’s neck.
Clare disengaged herself from Sherlock’s grasp as she and the healer knelt beside John. Sherlock watched in horrified fascination as Clare took John’s shirt off; his skin was ripped open from his clavicle bone all the way to the top of his rib cage. The red muscle tissue was in stark contrast to the black blood that congealed around it.  Clare took out a knife and cut off a piece of flesh from her upper arm and handed it to the healer. The healer kneaded it for a moment or two, covered it with some purple goo, and shoved it as far as he could in John’s wound.
I go over the crime scene, with you trailing in my wake. Anderson, stays hunched over in the corner, picking at some organic material that is stuck to the wall. He doesn’t look up when I pass him. I ignore him and squat down to examine the machete.
John felt a lump rise in his throat at the Shaman’s words, “Powers of Observation”, for all they did was remind him of Sherlock; however he took a deep breath and looked at the three horsemen again and then he frowned, “What is that blurry section under each horseman? It looks like the shimmering pictures of mirages that people have been noted to see on a hot day in the desert.”
John shook his head, the tears openly spilling down his face by this time, “Please, let’s change the subject,” he begged. “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
“No, and that’s odd, don’t you think?” Mrs. Hudson asked while she searched the kitchen for errant tea cups.
“No, nothing, no pain, no indecision, no fragility, no fear, it’ll be just you and me against the world, just like always.”
John sighed and recounted the events of the last few days, conveniently leaving out Laura’s flirtation.
You sit down next to me on the bed. “Sherlock, let’s not talk about this now.” I shake my head, then take a bite of biscuit, letting the taste of it fill my mouth. “Jesus, you make tea and biscuits so sexy.”
You get up yawn, stretch and then you almost run from the box. You are like an errant puppy that has just escaped from its pen. I smile. You, John Watson are adorable. Mary watches your departure with fondness. A fondness that softens her features. In the semi-darkness of the house she looks like a girl. Once she is sure you are out of ear shot she turns to me.
Sherlock’s throat hurt so badly that all he could do was mutely nod. After a few moments Sherlock composed himself and cleared his throat. “It appears to be a rival gang assassination.”
Sherlock nodded shakily. “John I’m fine.” Sherlock barked in a tone a few decibels lower than his own. Clare was in the corner putting her cloak around the half-naked Asian woman. When John stood up the Asian woman began to whimper again.
Sherlock looked like a small child as he pouted and then hesitantly asked John, “Has it happened to you?”
Laura feigned surprise, “Why John you cut me to the quick. Do you honestly think I would physically hurt someone or kill them?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, composing himself. “Everything’s fine. We were just conducting an experiment.”
“What? Seriously, Anderson? He’s a dolt an idiot, not worthy of my attention. How can you say such things? I was just bored, that’s it, nothing more.”
Sherlock anxious to dispel the serious mood that had come upon them all, walked over to the piano. “Is my violin still under the here?” Sherlock said as he knelt down and pulled out a battered old case. He opened it up and exclaimed, “It’s still in tune.”
Sherlock propped his chin up on his hand, “John Watson, what might we deduce about your last sentence? Sleep in, hmmm, cover blown hmm…Ah, I have it you want me to blow you under the covers and then sleep in.”
You push your fists deeper into the mattress. “No, I don’t know. Now quit talking in riddles and tell me what’s wrong.”
I lay helpless under his sexual ministrations, gasping with pleasure. It has been so long since I have felt another’s touch. Too long. Tears run down my face as I gasp, releasing in my pants. I whimper in embarrassment and discomfort. Anderson shows no mercy as he finishes what he started. Transfixed I watch as he rubs the front of his own trousers. His eyes never lose contact with mine. I watch as his eyes widen and his head snaps back.
John frowned. “So, you won’t listen to me, but you will listen to a woman who claims she is gay, and then tries to seduce you? Did she succeed?”
I am losing the upper hand. “Stop, with all this emotional foreplay. I don’t need you to tell me these things. Oh, and I only bottom for John so prepare to be fucked hard and fast because that’s how he likes it.” My hands shake as I grab a condom and a packet of lube. Anderson lays quietly beneath me. Waiting. “You’re only getting enough prep so that you don’t scream loud enough to wake the whole neighborhood. Got it?”
He looked up at him, brushing away a stray tear. “It’s bloody cold out here. It’s making my eyes water.”
“Sherlock, where are you? I’ve got something for you.” John called out. “Sherlock?” The door opened while he arranged himself in a seductive position. His eyes widened when he noticed Mycroft standing in the doorway. “Jesus, don’t you ever knock?” he asked, while he covered his torso with a sheet.
John frowned as he thought of Sherlock, for he didn’t want Sherlock to be jealous of his new acquaintance. Elsa took John’s darkening countenance as a reflection of her own relationship with her husband and without knowing it John’s concern had formed a bond between the two of them.
Sherlock frowned. “For what?” He thought. Then the unthinkable happened and the shooter fired again. A small red hole appeared in the center of John’s forehead as he slumped forward and hit the table. Sherlock jumped up in disbelief. “No, no, no, John…,” he screamed ignoring the hands that attempted to pry John’s broken body out of his grasp. The rhythm of the room slowed down. Hands were grasping him. Medical personnel took one look at John and black tagged him. Sherlock screamed at them to try and revive his beloved John. Their sympathetic eyes stared back at him like a dead fish’s, unblinking, and devoid of emotion. John was just a body to them. How could they know what he meant to Sherlock? They would take his body to the morgue where a ghoulish Doctor would perform an autopsy. Their fingers would probe and weigh every part of John. Cold hands would weigh each organ on a scale. Cold hands would pierce his skin with a scalpel, revealing John’s anatomy. Their explorations would rip at the flesh of the man he loved. “No, I won’t let them touch him,” Sherlock thought. “I will kill them all if they dare. Yes, I will kill them all.” Sherlock bit his lower lip, not noticing when his teeth pierced the skin. A small trickle of blood ran down his chin, but Sherlock didn’t bother to wipe it away.
You and Anderson laugh together. I look from one of you to the other, not sure if I should join in or not. A gasp from the bed relieves me of a decision. “God, please don’t make me laugh any more. It hurts.”
Clare took a step closer to Sherlock. “The healer won’t complete the process with you standing there, you have to leave.” Clare said firmly.
I look at you, you look back. Mary smiles and takes both of our hands. I entwine my fingers through yours and then hers. For a moment I grasp them tightly, unwilling to leave the safety of the Opera House-our sanctuary.
“Get up,” you hiss. I do as you say. “Do you have anything on under that Robe?” I shake my head no. “Get it off and put on your long coat.” I stare at you transfixed as you relive yourself. “Don’t just stand there. Do it,” you shout.
Even though it was cold outside, Sherlock began to sweat profusely as he tried to keep from crying out. “Sherlock, it’s okay, you need to scream out, sometimes that helps with the pain,” John said as he prepared to do the procedure once more. Again John placed his fingertips at the top of Sherlock’s nose and pressed against his nose firmly. This time Sherlock cried out and became so pale that John thought that Sherlock was going to pass out. John was sweating just as much as Sherlock as he placed his palms down the side of Sherlock’s nose, adding firm pressure and moving in a straight line. John did this twice and then looked at Sherlock’s nose from several different angles.  He then placed a finger as far up as it would go into Sherlock’s nostril and aligned the nose from the inside. Once he was satisfied that the nose was straight John helped Sherlock to his feet, led him over to the seating area and instructed Sherlock to hold ice on the nose as John finished up and stuffed little wads of gauze up Sherlock’s nose to assist in the  setting process. John then walked over to where Sherlock’s opponent stood. “Is he going to be okay?” He asked.
After Lestrade left Mrs. Hudson puttered around the room endlessly chattering about how romantic cruise ships were until Sherlock couldn’t take any more, “Mrs. Hudson.”
John grimaced when he moved into another position. “Mycroft, stop being cryptic and tell me what’s going on.”
As they both handed their phones back to the original owner, Sherlock and John felt the enormity of their situation bearing down on them. John was the first to speak, “John, I’ve been thinking, in addition to my detective cases, I want to paint and compose again. I mean both of us are definitely going to have some lifestyle changes. No champagne etc.”
Hugh reached them first and helped Sherlock with John’s unconscious body. “Sherlock, he doesn’t look so good,” Hugh said as he handed John over to Sherlock.
I smile at you as I say, “Mycroft knows you are to be protected at all costs. I made him swear after he lost a game of Operation.”
Days pass, Mary’s urn comes home to rest and with each passing day I can feel you slipping away from me. I don’t know how to stop it. I don’t know how to keep you close. I don’t know how to comfort you for I am grieving myself. So, it is no surprise when one day you come to me and say, “Sherlock, if you don’t mind I’m going back to sleep in my own room. It’s just that I’m having trouble sleeping and I don’t want to disturb you.”
John grinned up at Sherlock as he took off the scarf from around his neck and began to wipe John clean, pausing at each place, and kissing John’s lips. Sherlock had just got them both dressed again when Mycroft’s party joined them. Making no explanation whatsoever Sherlock lifted John on to the back of the horse, tied the soiled scarf around his neck, as he smelled every inch of it. Then he winked up at John as he slipped up behind him on the horse.
“The key is to a Swiss bank account from a prominent Jewish family. There were no survivors in the immediate family. However, there was a distant one. A woman,” Mycroft said and then paused before he continued, “The Woman.”
Sherlock had just come down off a high and his skin was starting to itch. “God, this is maddening,” Sherlock thought as he scratched at his arms until they bled. When Sherlock heard the Shaman and John come through the front door, he quickly pulled down his sleeves and sat quietly in a meditative pose. “Sherlock?” John called as he softly entered the room. Sherlock ignored him and kept up the faux meditation, hoping John would go away. When Sherlock felt someone grab the back of his neck, he yelped in surprise.
John, Sherlock, Jake, Clare and Rathery glanced uneasily at the brick tunnel that stood before them. Each of them shifted nervously at the prospect of the unknown. The all stood looking on in silence, and then John was the first to step forward. “Well, no guts no glory,” he said as he ran into the dark passageway.
“Fine, off to Baker Street to get off, solve cases, just the two of us against the world, soon to be three. Come on, John, the game is on.”
Sherlock let his fingers dance lightly across John’s forehead. “Yes, John, I know,” he whispered as he kissed the top of John’s head. As Sherlock stroked John his thoughts became dark and fearful.  “John, I want you to know something. I want you to know that we will face the future together and that no matter what happens, I will stand with you and by you. John? John, did you hear me?” Sherlock asked lightly, his voice was still hoarse from screaming. John didn’t respond for he was fast asleep in Sherlock’s arms.
“Please Sherlock”, you say as you pull out our props from the nightstand beside the bed. I shudder with desire as I watch you prepare.
You sigh. “Sherlock, I don’t have time for this. I’m sorry I just don’t feel like it, but we should talk. I’m worried about you.”
Sherlock looked into the creature’s eyes and then faced Lestrade with such a look of devastation on his face that Lestrade stopped screaming. “Sherlock what is it?” He whispered.
John immediately responded. “Oh God, yes,” John groaned as he sucked hard and harder on Sherlock’s bloody fingers. When he had sucked them clean, John began to kiss Sherlock, biting his lip so that he could taste more of Sherlock’s blood.  The villagers stood by and watched in horrified fascination, for they knew better than to disturb a creature like John. John sucked on Sherlock’s lip a few more seconds and then stopped. His breathing was heavy and the corners of his mouth had blood caked in them. John’s eyes went from golden to blue as he stared at Sherlock, as if it were the first time he had seen him. “Sherlock, what have I done?” John whispered.
Sherlock was glad to back in London, far away from everything that reminded him of John for even though he and Sherlock were going to go back to London after Sherlock’s case was over, Sherlock didn’t know John’s London address and John didn’t know his, so it was as if the cruise had never taken place. Sherlock paused outside the gallery where his paintings were displayed and then sighed and went in.
When I speak my voice sounds like a child. “No, it’s just that I feel…tight…like I’m going to explode.”
My hands shake as I make my way back to the flat, maybe I can still catch you. I must beg you not to leave. When I get to the flat, I race up the stairs. Mycroft is there. A pile of things lays in a prominent place in the middle of the room. It is everything I had pawned; all the items are there except for my heart. For a moment I think I can see it alongside our pile of valuables, beating as I bleed out. The room swirls around me. I cannot face this. The reality of being a grieving adult is too much to bear. When my eyes next open, Mycroft is holding me in his arms. His eyes are full of pain, but he doesn’t say so. He just holds me tight. I don’t struggle, not even when I am buckled down to a gurney. The last thing I see as I am carried out of the flat, is your medals dearest John. The firelight reflects off of them, making them glow, consigning my soul to flames of woe.
Sherlock made a hissing noise as he inhaled a breath of air through his teeth. When he felt what John wanted him to do Sherlock made a noise in the back of his throat that sounded like a combination of a purr and a growl. “Good boy, you learn so fast,” John whispered in Sherlock’s ear. Then all verbal conversation stopped seguing into a bodily primal dance of give and take.
Once inside the place, Sherlock struggled to remain calm. Breathing exercises are fucking useless when all one can think of is pain and torture.
They walked for what seemed like hours and then Clare held up her hand, as she beckoned Jake and Rathery forward to a cave. Jake was hoping that the cave would be nice and cozy. He was disappointed for the inside of the cave was ice cold. Jake stamped his feet and rubbed his arms to get the circulation back into them, as Clare started a fire. Soon they were all warm and full from eating the food provisions they had brought.
Without another word Sherlock’s deft hands found their intended target in the folds of John’s robe. John’s body trembled as he looked up at the full moon and the stars above them.  “Well, if we’ve got to go, we’ve got to go,” John said as he leaned back against Sherlock.
Clare made a noise that was supposed to be laughter; however, John thought it sounded more like hissing. He hurried to his room got dressed, and pulled out a sword he had bought in China Town. John had the sword sharpened, so that it could cut silk. He slipped the sword back in its scarab, and then he adjusted it on his back so that the sword could quickly be drawn, if need be. He took a glance at himself in the mirror, there was an unmistakable glow to his cheeks from he and Sherlock’s love making, but there was something else too. Blood lust, the desire to slice the Golem’s head off, and feel the spray of blood on his face was a drive that was almost as powerful as the sex drive. Without another thought, John cleared his mind and met Clare in the hallway.
John wanted to say, “No, I was just about to go bungee jumping.” Instead all he said was, “Yes, thank you.” Then like a helpless infant John let himself be wheeled up the ramp and into the van. The ride home made John feel like he was in a snow globe looking out, his own world a transparent imitation of the world he observed through the fogged over windows of the van. Soon the van was pulling up to the curb in front of his flat, another ride down the van ramp and another ride up the ramp to his flat, then after a few moments of John fumbling for his flat keys, the young man wheeled him inside. The flat was cold and John shivered as he rolled over and turned on the lights, a small Christmas Tree that his neighbor had put in the corner of the room, winked pathetically at John as he rolled over and switched on the multi-colored lights. John then let the young man settle him on the couch, and then he wheeled the chair on the other side of the couch, so that John could easily reach it, but so that he wouldn’t have to look at it.
Why did you faint? If I knew the human heart as well as I know the human mind I would know. Not knowing is almost as hard as being bored. I’m tired. The mysteries of John Watson’s heart will have to be deduced at another time.”
You lead me to bed. I allow you to undress me. Your fingers undo each button on my shirt, then my trousers, then your hands linger at the waistband of my pants. I take a deep breath, but we both know you won’t go further. I lay in your arms, shivering until you pull the blankets over us. I am safe in my John cocoon. I smile when I feel your erection pushing against my thigh.
“My sister is the east wind, she is fire, Mycroft is ice and I am water. We play sort of a rock, paper, scissors game but with the elements. That day Mycroft didn’t want to play. Sherrin had me tie Victor up and then put him in my closet. She left clues as to why, but I don’t get them. I am too stupid.”
A slight whizzing sound to his left made Sherlock turn as he drew his knife and took a protective stance in front of John. A voice spoke out with chilling familiarity. “Put the knife down. Don’t you know a rescue when you see one, brother mine?”
A few moments later the woman came back with a green shinny leather looking pouch. She smiled at Sherlock slyly, as she pulled out a needle and syringe and as she pulled back the plunger, it filled with a green fluid. Sherlock’s hands shook as he rolled up his sleeve. “Hurry, do it. I want to feel the needle in my arm,” Sherlock hissed as he pulled the woman closer.
I turn to see you in the doorway, holding baby Alice. She looks adorable in a little white dress. It’s dotted with red hearts and I smile. You are dressed in black trousers and a red shirt. I frown, attempting to recall why you are both dressed up. You laugh. “It’s Valentine’s Day, Sherlock and we are all going out for a fine meal.”
Sherlock pushed them both towards the bedroom, “There’s nothing to discuss, you two either get busy or I’m going to leave and find someone that will.”
He took John deeper into the back of his throat. “Come on, John, come for me. I want to drink your JIZ.”
John released Hugh’s hand as he stifled a giggle. Hugh appeared not to notice the exchange as he said, “It’s always nice to meet a fan. I’ll autograph a copy of, “Let Them Talk”, and messenger it to your hotel.”
“No, don’t,” Sherlock said as he twisted away from John’s grasp. “Just let me go to the bathroom and…”
John decided to play up his cover a bit, “God, I could do with some cash, Sherlock is used to a certain lifestyle and I haven’t the heart to tell him that we are going to be broke soon.”
I look down and scuff the floor with the tip of my shoe. “Maybe, but it’s mainly in the interest of science.”
You place your forehead against mine. “Sherlock, Sherlock, yes I’m dehydrated. Now what’s this about Beethoven?”
“Come on, John let me buy you a drink,” Elsa said brightly in an attempt to banish the darkness that threatened to overwhelm them both. “Oh you do drink, don’t you?”
John looked around realizing that the room only had a few people in it and all were dressed like some character out of a Fitzgerald novel. “I don’t understand, is this a private concert?”
Laura rolled her eyes, “John, don’t worry it is just a formality there will be no bloodletting or sacrificing a goat.”
I pull my knees up to my chest. How can I shrink away when you won’t let me? “John, it’s good to see you, but things are different now. You have a baby and I no longer fit into your lifestyle. It’s too late for us. I’ll be okay, just leave.”
Clare’s silver eyes appeared to shine a little brighter. “John, what you smell is human blood. That is the scent of the Golem.”
Sherlock put his lips to John’s ear. “Always, John, I am with you always.” Then he propelled them both to where Wiggins sat waiting in a black Land Rover.
“Well, Sherlock are we going back to Baker Street or do you want time alone to go to your mind palace?”
Ignoring Sherlock’s sarcasm, the man pushed his way inside the cabin and towards the bed where he looked down at John. “Sir, are you John Watson-Holmes?”
John looked at Sherlock’s pale face, his swollen nose, the dried blood around his nostrils, and the dark circles under his shinning green eyes and gasped. “Sherlock, my God how you move me,” John whispered as he took Sherlock’s arms and stared deep into the depths of his beautiful sad eyes.  “Wait here while I tend to your sparring partner’s injuries,” John whispered as he reluctantly let go of Sherlock’s arms.
The quick motions I make with my hand do nothing to improve my mood. I am finishing up as you exit the shower. My body spasms a couple of times as you stare at me. “Sherlock, did you just jerk off while I was in the shower?”
John slipped the underwear off and replaced it with another garment. Sherlock took a deep breath as John’s hands slipped the new underwear on. John grinned as he slipped the pants on and showed Sherlock how to tie them, and then John slipped a sort of undershirt over Sherlock’s head, followed by the jacket which he showed Sherlock how to put on. “Make sure the right part is over the left, only dead people have the left part folded over first.” John said as he tied the top part of the clothing on Sherlock. Sherlock felt weak in the knees as John’s fingers grazed his nipples. John smiled when they immediately hardened. Sherlock took a deep breath and then knelt on the floor before he passed out.
I slip on my robe and walk into the main room. You have just thrown down the phone and have put your face in your hands. “Oh, John,” Mrs. Hudson says as she wraps her arms around you. I back away tears are not my territory.
You are looking at me now, staring. John your thoughts elude me. I run my tongue around the tip of your finger. Am I teasing you? If I were a man of passion, instead of a man of letters my stomach would churn as my useless appendage stood at attention. My heart drops like a stone in my chest. You think I’ve lost my senses. I run my tongue along your nail beds, treasuring each hang nail. If this is my last contact with you I must make it count. I must make it last. A tear runs down my face, willing you to go Doctor Kevorkian on my ass. The inside of your finger traces the ridges on the roof of my mouth. I watch your face. Your bottom lip trembles. Your eyes dilate, then flutter, then they roll back in your head as you faint. John? I hear you mumbling as a nurse helps you up.
“Excellent deduction, John.” Then he walked over and sat down on the step next to Molly. “He already adores her. I don’t understand.”
John made his way through the camp joking and encouraging the men in an effort to keep their moral up. After he had done this John thought of the first time he and Sherlock made love, hoping the memory would keep him warm, he allowed his mind to recall ever detail. God, the smell, the physical sensations, the beauty of that day all came back to John in a rush.
Clare nodded. “John and I had the situation under control, until one of them held a knife to your throat. Without hesitation John surrendered his sword.”
John’s face flushed slightly as he joined Sherlock in his booth.  Sherlock stared at John for so long that John felt as if he were going to faint. “Suddenly, I don’t feel hungry anymore, let’s go for a stroll.” John said as his fingers lightly touched Sherlock’s arm.  The heat from John’s touch penetrated through his suit and Sherlock shivered from the effect. Unsteadily, he got to his feet and offered John his arm and then John got up smiled and took Sherlock’s arm with pride. Once they were on the deck John felt jittery as the cold air hit his sweaty body. Sherlock reached out to pull John into his arm and then pulled back shyly. “John, you seem cold. I can hear the dance music starting. Would you…you dance with me?” Sherlock whispered, as he held out his arms.
Sherlock stiffened. “John, please promise you will never do something that foolish again. Clare, is not what she seems, however, I don’t think she means us any harm. Just the same John, please don’t follow her again.”
Gradually, Sherlock’s body retained some of John’s warmth and then like sleeping beauty Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open and he smiled. “John, you’ll do anything to get me naked, won’t you?” Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock’s eyes flew open and he gripped John’s forearms tighter when he felt a brush against his prostrate.
Mycroft sighed. “If he’s gone off grid, then it will be almost impossible. He has bolt holes all over the world.”
As the limo navigated its way through London traffic, they each made plans as to where they would stay.
A few hours later, Sherlock drowsily lay in John’s arms as John told Sherlock what had transpired the night before. After he was done with his story, Sherlock tried in vain to be just a scientific data receptacle, but the burn of John’s touch still had his senses tingling, so all he said was, “John, since my cover was blown anyway, I am not leaving your side for a second. I couldn’t bear it if something were to take you from me.”
She then jumps on the bed and begins to wrestle with me. “Oh yeah, then what’s this?” Mary asks as she playfully reaches her hand underneath the sheet.
Sherlock fought to acquiesce, but was prisoner to the voices that whispered inside his head. The voices that plagued him every day. He couldn’t remember a day without their relentless assault on his peace of mind.
Sherlock was openly weeping by now. John held him close and shed tears with him. “What did Mycroft say?”
Sherlock smiled, taking a syringe out of his pocket. He held it up to the light, entranced by its gold colored contents. “Trust me I made this myself. With your help and the help of my chemical concoction I will remember anything and everything you suggest.”
I must be sick for as much as if hurts I love the feel of you sticking a needle in me. Slow at first and then the sting as the needle penetrates my vein. I sigh in pain and pleasure.
I smile. “I’ll be there in a minute to help you muddle through. Oh, by the way, she’s also a vegetarian.”
The last chords of Hugh’s last song faded away. He stood up thanked the crowd and then disappeared off of the stage. A few moments later a figure in a black hoodie came up to Sherlock and John’s table. Without a word he pulled a gun out of his pocket, fired a couple shots into John’s chest. The plasma bag burst covering Sherlock and the shooter with red spray. The shooter then turned to Sherlock as he whispered, “I’m truly sorry, Sherlock.”
Sherlock stared at John and felt wobbly when John didn’t break eye contact. As a group of children rushed by Sherlock, he lost his balance and fell into John’s lap.
John’s mouth stood open as Sherlock breezed in through the open door, “God he’s magnificent, so full of life,” John thought as Sherlock nervously paced the perimeters of the room, his long, black coat trailing behind him.
Sherlock felt as if he were going to hyperventilate. “John, for God’s sake I’m begging. I’m going to explode.”
John turned around, his eyes glowing, in anger for his blood lust was aroused and he needed to taste it. He needed to feel its salty flavor running down his throat, “Get away from me,” he growled.
All heads turn as we exit the elevator and enter the hotel lobby. We are a striking trio. My heart feels light and I struggle to banish the thought that rolls around in my thoughts. “Nothing lasts forever, don’t get too comfortable. All hearts are broken. All lives end.”
Sherlock clapped his hands together, “Well, that settles it then. After the snow stops we will start home.”
You looked shocked. “Sherlock, the torment doesn’t stop with you does it? What do you want me to say?”
John’s heart was pounding so hard, he felt sure that every person aboard the ship could hear it. “You look marvelous as well,” John answered. “What do you recommend on the menu tonight?”
With reluctance Sherlock dragged his attention from John and focused on Laura and Mycroft. “Well, what is the exact nature of this case?”
“Well, you must be as tired as Sherlock. Clare and I will show you two around tomorrow,” Jake said as John tried to stifle a yawn.
You laugh, then your expression sobers. “I’m proud of you, Sherlock. You’ve shown a great deal of restraint through all this.” I nod, then move past you. “Sherlock, wait a minute.” I pause. “I think we should get Anderson out of the house. I know he’ll be back to work in a couple of weeks, but he seems depressed.”
Mary smiles. “Yes, Sherlock I believe you would. Now come on drama queen let’s join John and get something to drink.”
Sherlock’s mom hugged him. “Now, Sherlock you won’t be here forever. You need to get better. Mycroft saved you last time but he might not be there next time and your father and I couldn’t bear to lose you.”
Sherlock wanted to kill the insolent bitch before him. “Tell her it’s Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, she’ll see me.”
Sherlock wrapped a scarf around his neck as he ran on deck to meet John. John was standing on the deck looking out at the skyline of New York City and Sherlock noted with sorrow that his face looked troubled. “Well, I must put a stop to that immediately,” Sherlock thought as he wrapped his arms around John’s waist and kissed him on the neck.
Wiggins opened his mouth to say something, then snapped it shut, mumbling to himself while he walked down the gravel path to the front door. Once inside he whistled, then said, “Wow.”
Sherlock laughed openly and began to tickle John in effort to make the olives drop out, when John tightly screwed his eyes shut, Sherlock pinned him down gently and ate the olives one by one. Then Sherlock looked at John as he lay beneath him and Sherlock sighed as he began to kiss John.
Sherlock felt his whole body go limp. John was fine, everything was fine, after all the alley where he had seen John and Clare battling the gang, was dark. Sherlock lulled himself to sleep with the thought that he must have been mistaken about John. John was still his sweet loving Doctor, nothing was wrong with him.
You help me in the limo, wincing when you feel the bones under my shirt. I slide into the seat. I know better than to try and escape, Mycroft has activated the child locks on the doors. They slam down like a prison door, I am trapped. The drive is a short one. The limo stops in front of a modern looking building. They have tried to disguise its purpose with landscaping, but I know better. It is a rehab center. Though I try to remain calm you dear John can see the panic in my eyes. “John, help me.”
John looked off into the distance where Sherlock had been, a moist puddle of water from the shattered glasses still glittered as the lights from the stage caught it just right. “Fine, I’m in, but one thing you have to know, I won’t physically hurt anyone.”
“Sherlock, that is against my recommendations. I told you that he needs to remain isolated. He must come to grip with his feelings of loss before he can except that you are not a ghost.”
The girls looked at each other in surprise and for the first time they looked at what he was wearing, John noticed their expressions and laughed, “I know, I know I didn’t get it here.”
Nina chatted nonstop on the way back to their penthouse. “Now, Sherlock let me take a look at you. Hmm that purple shirt is a bit wrinkled, but it will have to do for the interview.”
She doesn’t miss a trick, the old dear. We both look to where you had been standing. “Sherlock, talk to John, tell him how you feel. I know he feels the same-he must.”
Sherlock locked his hands on the back of the woman’s neck and put his forehead on hers. “It’s none of your business and what is this about, calling me ivory man?”
Sherlock looked down at his hands. “I could have saved him by ignoring him. I could have saved him by terminating our friendship. I knew she hated Victor. I just didn’t know how much. In any case, I was the one who tied him up.”
My face flushes. “I bet you do.” I then leave the room to forage for something to eat. A few minutes later, Mrs. Hudson finds me looking in the kitchen cupboards.
You stumble back as I release you. After a moment or two you get your breathing under control. “Sherlock, this case is unsafe. You could get a disease. I want you to stop it now, or I’ll leave. I’ll leave Baker Street and never come back. I’m not bluffing. I mean it.” There is a silence between us, it makes my stomach queasy. “Sherlock, please quit the case,” you whisper.
Doctor Shaw, shook her head. “Sherlock, you’re not listening. This is as good as it’s going to get for him.”
John looked around his surroundings with wonder. “By God, this is a beautiful place.” John thought to himself. For the first time in years John felt young and free, he gave no thought to Afghanistan, no thought to unsolved murders, to failed relationships or loss of any kind. Under further introspection John wondered if he had died and gone to heaven. “This sense of freedom must be what heaven is like, “John mused.
John’s eyes filled with tears as he felt for the bottle of pain killers in his pocket. “Nothing, I’m fine.”
The man was horrified at the hornet’s nest he had unearthed as he desperately looked around him for an escape route.
Until now John had not noticed the Shaman’s arrival, “The horse of pestilence is in London.” The Shaman replied.
“Your kisses are worth waiting for, burrrh,” John sang and then began to play an imaginary set of drums.
John shook his head and then attempted to soothe Sherlock with his tone of voice, “Sherlock, I can’t run you know that. Come on help me get dressed. It’s alright I am sure this is just some sort of misunderstanding.”
John was too preoccupied by swallowing to answer. Sherlock pulsed in his mouth, until it was full, then lay back panting.
John looked at the white shirt that the sales girl held out to him and he said, “That’s fine, and I will pay cash.”
The next day Sherlock acted as if nothing had happened; however there was a wiry tension in his walk that John hadn’t noticed previously for his normally graceful movements were rigid with a spasmodic jerk in his limbs now and then. “He’s under great stress,” John thought and then swallowed as his mouth became dry. “Oh God, he wants to leave me,” John surmised in a panic. “Well, I won’t make it easy on him.” John thought angrily as he folded his arms across his chest.
Clare watched the exchange between John and Sherlock in silence. John still had his arm around Clare and started to come back with a pithy retort.
Sherlock crooked his finger beckoning John to his side, John smiled and wheeled over, causing a physical pain in Sherlock’s chest as he noticed the effort it took to line his chair up in front of his own. John frowned when he saw Sherlock’s laptop pressed firmly against his middle.
Elsa laughed again and then her expression darkened as she said, “My but you are so charming. My husband would never allow anyone to drop the Doctor in his title.”
“Why do you always do this to me, Sherlock?” You say as you bite on your lower lip. “What exactly do you want from me?”
Sherlock leaned back in the bed in excitement, “Something new, God this was going to be great,” Sherlock thought as he put on a robe.
Sherlock brushed away a tear, that slid down his cheek. “No, friends don’t do that to each other. Now come with me, John, please.”
After you are done seeing to Anderson, you turn to me. “Alright you, I’m going to check his sutures and bag. You can leave now and give us some privacy.”
John put his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “Sherlock, I will kill myself before I would ever hurt you. However, you must face the fact that well over the last few days, I have not been myself.”
Later that night as Sherlock and John slept soundly in each other’s arms, a woman in a dark cloak delivered a small black orchid in a plastic container. Kissing the top of the lid she read the card in satisfaction. It read:
Tears streamed down Sherlock’s cheeks. He didn’t bother to brush them away when he moved towards the surgeon, grasping her arm. “If anything happens to him. I will kill you and your entire family. Got it?”
Sherlock opened his eyes. The Doctor’s figure blurred in and out of focus. Then the sound of shouting voices reached them. It appeared as if the police were raiding this foul place. “Mycroft must have come through,” Sherlock thought. He looked over at the Doctor in satisfaction, reveling in his terrified expression. Just before he lost consciousness, Sherlock watched as the Doctor took a necklace off from around his neck. He looked both ways placing it in a secret panel inside the wall.
Sherlock felt as if he’d been slapped, as all the anger drained out of him and was replaced by hurt.
It is a challenge. He holds out the helmet and I take it. The ride through London is glorious. Anderson takes chances and I revel in the danger as we weave through traffic. By the time we reach Baker street I feel a bit nauseous.  I fall off the bike in a heap. Anderson helps me up. I scowl at him. “Come to gloat over my addictions?” I ask in a spiteful tone.
John lay in his bed tossing and turning, lonely for Sherlock. Then the shrill ringing of his bedside phone made John jump. He shivered as the night air hit his sweat soaked body and for a moment he was confused about where he was.  Then John stared at the phone again and picked up the receiver.
Lestrade walked over and stood in front of Sherlock. “Is that it? You mean no analyzing, telling us what they ate for breakfast, whether the victims were right or left handed, how the tread was worn on their shoes, etc.?”
“Casablanca, John, the game’s afoot. Now get ready for we are going to catch our quarry Come on let’s make haste,” Sherlock said as he bounded over to John.
Anderson chuckles. “Fine, Sherlock, now let’s work together, shall we?” He then steps back to let me examine the body. “The victim is male, around 50 years of age, the second toe of each foot has been removed and placed where?” I ask as I look around the room.
Mycroft snorted, “Really Sherlock, don’t be such a child. Use logic. Think it through. Laura knows about a lot of things before they happen. Like accidents, especially car accidents.”
John frowned as Sherlock trudged towards him; he looked so cold and exhausted. “We need to stop for a rest. I’m getting tired,” John lied. There was no cave and John had to dig out a shelter from the ice. Sherlock made a few attempts to assist but John waved him off. “Thank you, Sherlock, but I can work better alone,” John said as he stretched a tarp over the dugout he had carved out of the ice. John piled two blankets on top of each other for Sherlock and for himself John put down a thin sheet of canvas. John turned around to get Sherlock and swore when he saw Sherlock lying curled up in the snow. John rushed over to where Sherlock lay and softly patted him on the cheek with a gloved hand. “Sherlock, come on, wake up.” John said firmly.
Sherlock dropped his brother’s ice cold hand. “It’s okay, Mrs. Hudson, John is still with us, but I have puzzles to solve, and things to remember. Now both of you get out.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to berate her, telling her he would leave when he pleased, but then he stopped and much to his surprise said, “Thank you.”
“You don’t remember? John, you…you died in my arms.” Sherlock whispered as he looked up into John’s searching eyes.
By the time, we arrive at Baker Street, I am in a foul mood, knowing that a cloud of darkness is coming, I burst forth from the cab, rush past Mrs. Hudson and make my way towards my violin.
John chuckled and then began to gasp as Sherlock’s lips touched his. With one touch, John’s mirth segued into passion. “Sherlock, how do you always know what to do?”
Sherlock pushed him forward with a gentle motion. “Not yet, John.” John frowned but let Sherlock complete his motions. When they were both bare below the waist Sherlock pulled John back and then smiled as he guided John’s body into his lap.
“Don’t be. I knew what I was getting into when I allowed you to worm your way inside my soul. I miss you. I hated you for the longest time, but who am I to judge? How can I know the lifetime of stress and regret that you must have let overwhelm your fragility—the fragility of genius. I can’t imagine how you felt that day on the rooftop. I can only guess. But I’ll tell you one thing.”
Sherlock woke up to the smell of something cooking. Whatever it was it smelled delightful and Sherlock’s stomach growled in agreement with his olfactory senses. Sherlock made his way into the kitchen and stood in the doorway as John prepared some sort of soup. As John stirred something in a pot bubbling with some sort of nourishment, Sherlock’s chest actually hurt as he thought of how much he loved John.
The tallest of the six came over and grabbed me by the front of his shirt. “Well, there’s only way to find out.” They laughed as they held me down and ripped off my clothes, bent me naked over the kitchen table and each took a turn over and over again. They were like Sharks on a feeding frenzy, the more I begged for mercy, the more excited they became. When they were done with me they just left me there whimpering on the kitchen floor. I was in so much pain I could hardly move.”
“Sherlock, is that you?” John called out, as the music played on. There was no answer and then the violinist started playing, “Oh Mio Babbino Caro.”  “This must be some attempt at seduction by Sherlock. “John thought and then sighed, “Well, it’s working.” He thought in content as the notes washed over him. Then the violin music faded away. John had wheeled himself into a corner, thinking that perhaps the whole thing had been a ruse brought about by Sherlock and he smiled fondly, “Sherlock, what a nut.” He thought. Then another song played over the waves of the rising storm. “The House of the Rising Sun,” sung by the Animals.
You sigh and sit down beside me on the bed. Your gaze intensifies as you smooth a lock of damp hair from my forehead. “Sherlock, you know once an addict, always an addict.”
Laura leaned back in satisfaction and lit a cigarette, “You will have to get close to her and then once that is achieved you will need to drug her or something and then take the necklace.”
I appear to consider the proposition for a moment or two before I answer. “Nope, don’t like it. I’m calling you Anderson.”
Sherlock nodded silently for he knew John was lying. “Fine, sounds interesting,” Sherlock replied flatly.
Once back at Baker Street, Sherlock lit a fire in the fireplace and settled down in his favorite chair. He still hadn’t uttered a word other than the necessary instructions to the cabbie, letting the familiar dark mood take him in its undertow.
Clare clutched her arm, as she walked over and stood in front of Sherlock. “You have to leave now,” Clare said solemnly.
In a rare moment of tenderness my brother smooths a dirty lock of hair from my forehead. “Time to go to the clinic,” he whispers.
Sherlock sat hunched over his laptop, reading through county record after county record, muttering. Then he stopped, leaned forward and frowned.
John waved Sherlock away. “I’m fine. Clare and I ran into a little trouble with a Chinese gang. We didn’t even catch sight of the Golem.” John sighed. “Well, maybe next time. Clare go ahead and hit the shower first.”
Sherlock barely noticed when the cab screeched to a halt. “Hey you two, what’s going on back there?” The cabbie shouted.
I do as he says. Chill bumps cover my body as his hands work their way through my hair. Once I am clean he helps me out of the tub and hands me a towel. His eyes move to the marks on my neck. The marks are from his teeth scraping against my skin during his drug induced state from the previous evening. I wish that you had scarred me, John, that way the marks would be with me forever. Your eyes next travel to my right pectoral muscle where you bit into me. I long for you to touch the sensitive tips of my breasts. They begin to harden as the idea runs through my mind like an out of control forest fire. “Touch me, John, please,” I think.
Sharon came and sat down next to John as he watched the interview, “I bet she never gets him to the altar. Hey, John, isn’t that Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock looked over at Mycroft, finding amusement at the way his brother struggled between taking a muffin or a handful of fruit. When he saw Sherlock watching him Mycroft scowled and popped a few grapes in his mouth. Looking bored Sherlock stood up walked over to the food platter and moved it around until he spied the muffin that Mycroft had been eyeing. Then with a great amount of flourish he peeled the paper away while Mycroft salivated over the crumbs that fell from his brother’s lips.
Sherlock frowned; for this type of behavior wasn’t like John at all. “What are you up to, John?” Sherlock thought uneasily.
She purses her lips. “Fine, but Sherlock you’ve got to behave. John, has a lot riding on his shoulders without you acting up.”
John whirled around with dread for the last thing he wanted to do was to see someone from his past especially the snub nosed man that stood in from of him.
Sherlock glared down at her in annoyance and then glanced around the room at the pale tense faces that looked at him with a mixture of hope and pity. Sherlock knew what they wanted to ask but didn’t dare and Sherlock couldn’t bear to utter John’s name to explain. “I am a human calculator, an amalgamation of facts, figures, I deduce, detect, I don’t worry for I am a proper genius. A proper genius not a lover…” Sherlock thought as the old familiar burning churned in his stomach and as Sherlock glanced back at the three faces that observed him, he began to panic, for Sherlock knew they knew, they knew that he was in fact destructible-human, made weak by his love for John. “John, my kryptonite,” Sherlock thought as he struggled to maintain centered. He could feel the anger starting to rage deep within him as he observed the pity that was being directed at him, for it made Sherlock feel as if he were trying to run on ice, slipping and sliding as an unknown assailant pursued him.  “STOP IT, STOP LOOKING AT ME, RIGHT NOW,” Sherlock shouted at the top of his lungs as he picked up a glass beaker that sat on the kitchen counter and slammed it into the wall, one by one he broke them all, throwing them so hard that shards of glass sprayed up in the air like fireworks.
I smile and then look at Anderson. “Umm, I’m sure I’m not the only one whose gotten off in this flat today.”
She took the file, sat down and began to read. After a few moments, she looked up at him. “So, you jump off a roof, pretend to die, traumatizing the man you supposedly love, then expect him to bounce back? Has he tried to suicide?”
A drip from the faucet claims my attention. I listen to it obsessively for a few moments before I decide to go out. The noise of the city consumes me and I am happier for it. I make contact with an old acquaintance. Shadows grow into human form as I make my deal with the devil. I give money for a package. A package with a needle. A package that will take the pain away. “Hello darkness my old friend,” I whisper as I plunge the needle into my vein.
When John finally helped him release, Sherlock felt as if he was going to faint. John was barely out of breath as he straddled Sherlock’s sweat drenched body. “Sherlock, I love you. Does your Doctor know best?”
“Sherlock, if you look at me and pay attention I will play that little game you’ve been wanting to try.”
I can’t take the pressure, so I begin to pace. “The fly in the ointment, the fly in the ointment,” I say aloud several times. Then I begin to pound the sides of my temples. Anderson reaches out and stills my agitated hands. Soon the rest of the team will enter the room. I can hear their approach. Just before they enter the room Anderson whispers into my ear, “Sherlock, let me take you to a gay bar.”
John bit on his lower lip as he glanced over at Sherlock, as he tried to disguise the fact that he was cold.
As Sherlock Holmes, walked down the gangway, the area was full of photographers and news cameras waiting to catch every move he made as walked down the ramp over to where Nina stood waving frantically.
Then he put his lips on mine, not gentle like I always imagined, but rough and demanding. I turned my head away, acutely away of the smell of sweat and alcohol that exuded from his pores. John ignored me smashing his lips on mine, biting me until I opened for his entrance. His hard tongue rampaged through my mouth, licking swelling and entwining around mine until I felt faint.
Clare gently took Sherlock’s arm, “Are you sure? John, will be for all intents and purposes, a monster-a demon.”
John watched the creatures in horror for as they drew closer their grotesque features became clarified. Their skin was yellow in tone; their bones struck out at odd angles making them appear like evil spindly pincushions. John raised his hand to the sky and plunged down into the demonic fray of monsters, hacking anything his sword would take out. As members of his army fell beside him, John’s human half began to tire; so he summoned the beast within and submitted to the forces of darkness, allowing his demon half to kill the creatures as he made his way to where the two horsemen sat enclosed in their bubbles.
Laura looked at John slyly, “The Doctor has a wife that has expensive taste, much like your Sherlock, and she is on this very cruise. She always wears a jade necklace and it is quite valuable. The Doctor has told me that the insurance payout on the theft of the missing necklace would be enough to settle his debts and cover your surgery. So, how about it John Watson do you want to run to Sherlock or wheel to him? Do you want to dance with Sherlock or watch from the sidelines? And when Sherlock makes love to you do you want to carry him to bed like a man or do you want to be carried like a helpless child to bed?”
The man was clearly terrified as he stared into John angry face, his eye dark eyes, glittering with rage, “I…I…” The messenger stuttered.
Sherlock wasn’t self-conscious at the impression that the cabbie would arrive at; however, he didn’t like being part of a game where he didn’t know the rules. Sherlock slipped out from underneath John’s arm. “I’ve got to think, John and I can’t with your arm around me.”
John pretended to put out and said, “Alright, just this once.” The boy wrapped his arms around John’s neck and off they went. Sherlock lit a cigarette as he watched them leave, “God, I envy that child right now,” Sherlock thought as he inhaled deeply.
Sherlock sighed, then rolled his eyes. “Fine, the clear set is the anti-depressant I’m going to make for John and the black set is the one for the poison that I will make to kill us both if he doesn’t get better.”
Elsa looked into John’s blue eyes and smiled sadly, “Of course you are, but does your devotion keep the fear of his leaving you someday from ripping at your sanity? Does your devotion outweigh the fact that he will someday tire of you and become B O R E D? Because that’s what happened to me, John, one day my dear sweet husband looked at me and saw someone ordinary and just like that he was bored with me. No amount of devotion on my part could re-kindle his interest; for once a brilliant mind like that becomes bored it moves on and never looks back. No, conscience, just cold logic and deduction, for it’s the next puzzle they crave not lap dog devotion.”
Love comes in all different shapes and sizes and when I look at you, Anderson and Alice, I realize how fortunate I am to be the recipient of such devotion. A text pings on my phone. I should ignore it, but my obsessive nature doesn’t allow me to. I read the text, then re-read it again. “John, Anderson, we have to leave now.”
“You mean when I thought you were hard at work on your computer, you were actually watching porn?” John sounded outraged.
Annette walks over and opens a drawer. She takes out a watch and hands it to me. It’s a Rolex and it’s genuine. “There’s one just like it in the room of the other worker.” I pace looking, sniffing and then I see it. A tiny scuff mark against the wall and I smile. “I’ll take the case, under one condition. I will need to go undercover as one of your sex workers.”
I openly laughed by this time. “John, I’m sorry I was bored. I just slipped you a tranquilizer or two, you’ll be fine.”
He smiled. “Yes, well I am one of a kind. You understand that the nature of your work here would be somewhat well below the radar.”
John ran his fingers across Sherlock’s chest, noting with satisfaction how Sherlock’s skin flexed and hardened under his touch. The world’s greatest detective was a shivering mass of putty in his hands. “Let’s relax,” John whispered in between kisses.
Sherlock let his fingers dance lightly across John’s forehead. “Yes, John, I know,” he whispered as he kissed the top of John’s head. As Sherlock stroked John his thoughts became dark and fearful.  “John, I want you to know something. I want you to know that we will face the future together and that no matter what happens, I will stand with you and by you. John? John, did you hear me?” Sherlock asked lightly, his voice was still hoarse from screaming. John didn’t respond for he was fast asleep in Sherlock’s arms.
Sherlock’s shoulders slumped and he sat down next to Mycroft, putting his head in his hands. “Tell me about the day Sherrin died.”
Sherlock sighed as he went out to find a guide. If John wanted a moonlit ride to Petra, he was going to get it.
John shook Sherlock roughly. “Come on Sherlock, wake up.” John shouted frantically to no avail for Sherlock had lost consciousness.
“Prolonged good-byes will only jeopardize his treatment program,” she said clasping Sherlock’s arm. “You can see him in 30 days.”
John looked underneath Sherlock’s lowered face and said, “Sherlock, we’ve talked about his before. I want this as much as you, so you are not forcing yourself on me. So, let’s practice some of the exercises I taught you. Take your shirt off slowly, count to five in between each button you undo, now breath in and out slowly.” John’s soft voice coaxed.
After cogitating on these reminiscences, I feel restless bored. “I need a case, John,” I shout aloud. “John, JOHN?”
Sherlock’s beady eyes narrowed, but he decided to play the game as well, “My name is Fernando. I am from Spain.”
Sherlock glanced over at Clare. Even though Claymore’s had little need for food, Sherlock had no doubt that she would not hesitate to eat the flesh off of his dead body if she needed subsidence. For a moment no one said anything each lost in their own reflections of their current situation. Sherlock was about to ask another question, when they all three heard the door from the top of the stairs slowly creaking open.
Tears poured down John’s face for he knew if he didn’t get help soon he would die. For a few moments John gazed into Sherlock’s eyes as if seeing him for the first and last time. The curly brown soft hair, the pale white skin, the chiseled cheekbones, the shinning blue-green eyes, these were only the physical attributes that made Sherlock beautiful. John sighed peacefully as he thought how irritated Sherlock would be if he knew that his intellect was the last thing that John considered to be an attribute of Sherlock’s. “Sherlock, I’m not going to make it. Please promise me you will leave immediately after I have drawn my last breath. Promise me.” John insisted as tears poured down Sherlock’s face. John hoped that Sherlock would do as he promised for John didn’t want Sherlock to see his mortal body go through the death throes. As John reached up to touch Sherlock’s face, his body grew heavy and cold in Sherlock’s arms. He looked up once more at Sherlock and then John smiled. “Sherlock…” John whispered as he fell back into Sherlock’s arms.
I stop and stare at your lips, making sure you aren’t going to speak. Then I become engrossed by the hairs of your beard, the way they cling to your lips like twigs cling to a thatched roof. I wonder if they are soft. I decide then and there I prefer Anderson with a beard. I clear my throat in order to focus my thoughts. Then I sniff the corpse as I examine it more thoroughly. I frown as I stand up, wincing as I crash my bloodied knee against the table leg.
Sherlock knew from John’s tone of voice that he had gone too far and yet it didn’t stop him from putting in one last jab at John as he left the room, “Whatever you say, John, for you always know best.”
“Sherlock, please stop pacing and come here,” John said as he wheeled over to where Sherlock was standing. Without a word Sherlock helped John out of his chair and carried him to the bed. “Now what might I deduce from this?” John asked aloud in a perfect imitation of Sherlock.
John frowned as Sherlock trudged towards him; he looked so cold and exhausted. “We need to stop for a rest. I’m getting tired,” John lied. There was no cave and John had to dig out a shelter from the ice. Sherlock made a few attempts to assist but John waved him off. “Thank you, Sherlock, but I can work better alone,” John said as he stretched a tarp over the dugout he had carved out of the ice. John piled two blankets on top of each other for Sherlock and for himself John put down a thin sheet of canvas. John turned around to get Sherlock and swore when he saw Sherlock lying curled up in the snow. John rushed over to where Sherlock lay and softly patted him on the cheek with a gloved hand. “Sherlock, come on, wake up.” John said firmly.
Sherlock didn’t miss the underlying nuance of John’s tone so he leaned in closer, as his eyes bored into John’s. “John, if you think I don’t find you desirable, then you are sadly mistaken, for as we speak I find it difficult not to lose myself in…in…you. Well, I suppose it would be easier to show you, wouldn’t it?” Sherlock said as he gently tilted John’s face towards his letting his full lips linger on John’s cheek, then he inhaled  shakily, pressed his full lips against John’s, the kiss was gentle at first but increased in intensity when John’s mouth returned his passion. After a few moments Sherlock pulled away, wrestled out of his jacket, threw it to the ground and resumed his kiss with John. After a few moments of the most intense pleasure Sherlock had known he reluctantly pulled himself from John’s arms and stood up. “John,” he muttered hoarsely. “John, I’m in the middle of a case and I have an art show coming up, so I have to keep focused, but know this I want you to marry me and I want to spend the rest of our lives together. I’ve been waiting for you so long, so John marry me and come home to 221b Baker Street.”
Sherlock knew without searching the internet that she spoke the truth. “What do you want from me?” Sherlock asked in a weary tone.
John laughed. “Sherlock, for someone who can act like a stick in the mud you are most spontaneous about things like this. Get a grip.”
“I’m fine, John,” I lie as my fingers trace the scar. The round scar that almost took you from me before I laid eyes on you at St. Bart’s. “It is the gunshot wound from a war that will never be won.” I mutter to myself.
He ran across the room and grabbed Wiggins by the throat. “Shut up, just shut the fuck up before I squeeze the life out of you.” Then he began to hurl whatever he could grab against the wall. The deafening noise of shattering plates, silverware, utensils and books filled the room when each object smashed against the wall. Wiggins cowered on the floor, with his hands, covering his ears.
Clare lips curved up in a thin smile.  “I anticipated that would be your response.” She then stood up, turned around and headed for the door.
Mycroft sighed. “It’s much more than that and you know it. The British government is not interested in the money. The safe deposit box holds secrets.”
He repeated his favorite mantra, until the only thing he was aware of was Angela’s soft voice, floating through his consciousness.
“John, no,” Sherlock pleaded again. “Please stop.” Then Sherlock got an idea, as a trickle of blood ran from his nose. He soaked his fingers with as much of his blood as he could and jammed his blood soaked fingers into John’s mouth.
I look down, wondering if I can remain sick forever. You approach me, taking my chin between your fingers. “God, you look a mess but are still so beautiful.”
“Anderson, you look pale.” I state, taking pleasure in the way he gasps for air. Dearest John you are my top and I am your bottom, but the thought of screwing Anderson into the mattress until he begs for mercy appeals to me. I learned a great deal from Ms. Alder and I could have Anderson begging me to beat him to a jelly if I wished. I look into his face. His eyes are clouded with lust and something else. Hope. I don’t have to strip the layers of his soul. I know he is in love with me. Your residual of humanity makes me feel a twinge of guilt, John. I am frustrated for I had intended to torture Anderson like a prey animal. But his eyes are not to the side of his head. They are facing front like mine. I am confused. Who is the prey, myself or Anderson?
Sherlock flew over to the woman’s side, wondering where Laura was. He stood before the woman, then licked his lips. “I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
I feel cold all over. The only thing that keeps me from screaming is the sound of a text message. I read it and smile. “John’s coming home,” I say aloud. All else fades away, for you dearest John are coming home.
Sherlock watched in fascination as John sucked at the trickle of black blood that dripped down his thumb. “John, does your blood still taste the same?” Sherlock asked curiously.
“Who knows? After you supposed death, John was obsessed about digging into your past, anything that could help explain your actions that day. I gave him a crumb or two to keep him out of my hair, but I told him nothing about our sister. He must have found that out on his own. I suppose he can be quite clever when he chooses to.”
“Sherlock, I care for you more than you could ever know. But I don’t know how to…how to love you anymore than you do me. Let’s just leave it at that shall we?”
I start to refute her use of ‘friend’ then stop when I observe Anderson looking up at me. Mrs. Hudson puts a kettle on, speculatively watching us watch each other. She raises an eyebrow then leaves the room.
