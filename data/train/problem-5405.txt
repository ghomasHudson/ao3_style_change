The wrapping is a little lumpy and there’s a lot of tape on them but as Cas sets them in Dean’s lap, heat rises to Dean’s face and a weird wriggly feeling gets going somewhere behind his ribs. ‘Um…’
He can endure the awkwardness, he only hopes Dean can.
Cas narrows his eyes, but doesn’t question him, and lets Dean push him down into the mattress. He looks good like this, beneath Dean, the yellowed light from the lamp soft on his face. Dean runs the backs of his fingers down Cas’s cheek, follows the motion of his Adam’s apple as he swallows thickly.
Something flickers over Dean’s face—too quick for Castiel to read—but he nods and moves back up until he’s face to face with Castiel. ‘Got any ideas?’
‘You’re nervous.’
Castiel pauses. ‘What has?’
‘There is… I don’t want this to be over yet.’ Castiel sucks in a wet, shuddering breath. ‘And I want to touch you, too. I want to make you feel good.’
‘It was good to meet you, Jack,’ Sam says.
‘I’m… “cool” with it, too.’
Because they’ve got all night and even longer than that.
They finish their coffees in silence, until Cas says, ‘Well, I should shower.’ He waits a moment, then two. ‘Thank you for breakfast.’
‘Gee, thanks.’
all-too-knowing looks cast his way. A shudder runs through him at the thought, alone, and he looks out toward the ocean again.
‘Oh,’ he says, barely registering her words as the spike of adrenaline in his blood recedes, ‘thanks,’ and takes the wallet from her. He’s not sure if he should offer her a reward or something, but before he can, Cas, who had gone off to search for Sam’s muesli, reappears. (Empty-handed).
The shopping cart comes to an abrupt halt, and won’t budge, because Cas has stopped dead in front of it. He’s got his hands curled over the end of the cart, and he’s watching Dean carefully. ‘Do you want to be?’
Cas rolls his eyes and Jack seems blissfully unaware, or is doing a good job of pretending.
Shame pierces Castiel’s pride, but it withers at the look in Dean’s eyes and with the memory of all their sexual encounters the past week. ‘You like it,’ Castiel says.
Dean grits his teeth and holds out a hand to take the bucket from Jack, saying, ‘Consider me on decoration duty,’ whatever was holding him back earlier gone, now.
‘Yes,’ Castiel says, hoping his voice doesn’t betray him, ‘I like trees.’
‘Fine, I’ll help.’
Dean snorts. ‘You better.’ He toes the dirt, ducking his gaze. ‘But if you feel weird about any of the couple stuff… We can tone it down around Sam and Jack. Or cool it completely. Whatever you want. I ain’t really big on PDA, anyway, but…’
‘Hello, Dean.’ Cas’s eyes crinkle at the corners. He leans toward Dean and says, ‘Are you having a good time?’
Dean snorts and pulls his arm away. ‘Jeez, what’s with the sunscreen obsession all of a sudden?’
‘We do.’ Something flickers over the kid’s face, like something’s occurring to him. ‘Or we will…’ he mutters. ‘I went too far.’
Jack is looking between them with a frown, and then his eyes widen. ‘Oh. You mustn’t be together, yet.’
‘I have many hidden talents,’ Cas says, voice low in Dean’s ear as he leans over his shoulder.
good at this anymore?
Castiel nuzzles into Dean’s neck, breathing in the scent of him. ‘It’s OK, Dean. I feel fine.’ He looks up, into Dean’s dark, glittering eyes. ‘More than fine.’
Cas frowns at him again. ‘Sam said the hunt was routine. That’s why you finished so quickly.’
And then Cas does,
‘No.’
‘Was that OK?’ Cas asks.
‘Thanks for getting us lunch, Sam’—Sam pitches Dean’s sandwich at him—‘Oh, that’s fine, it wasn’t any trouble at all.’
He looks at Cas, who is kneeling and waiting, and says, ‘Fine, whatever, knock yourself out,’ and manages not to jump out of his skin when Cas touches him again.
and he’s barely glimpsed Cas.
Relief floods Castiel, and he says, ‘That’s good.’
Now this? This Dean can get on board with. He fits his hands to Cas’s waist, the warmth of his skin bleeding through the thin, soft cotton to Dean’s palms.
junkless.’
‘Dean.’
‘What?’
‘Then let’s find out.’ Before Cas can respond, Dean pushes at his shoulder until Cas is lying on his side. Dean settles behind him and throws an arm around his waist, pressing his face to the back of Cas’s neck. He’s warm and solid in Dean’s embrace and he smells good. It’s just the scent of skin and the faint hint of soap, but it’s comforting.
. Castiel swallows and reaches between Dean’s legs, circling gently, awed that Dean would let him touch him like this, that Dean
Castiel nods, smiling.
‘I didn’t want to leave,’ Cas says, voice barely above a whisper. ‘You have to know that.’
‘Yes,’ Cas says, unfazed.
There’s a song playing on an old radio Dean had dug up—it’s one that he’d put on the tape he made for Castiel and, usually, it would soothe Castiel, but tonight it only jangles against his nerves.
‘What?’
But, then, Cas pulls away, taking his empty mug and plate to the sink, and Dean is left with a shock of cold like he’s been doused in ice-water.
‘Uh…’ Dean pats Jack’s back. ‘Everything OK?’
Dean smiles, embers of arousal kindling low in his gut. ‘Yeah,’ he says, ‘we do,’ and lets Cas pull him onto the bed.
‘You sure? Because you just about bit my head off when I suggested turning out the lights.’
been planning something.
Castiel gives Dean a sad smile. He’d known, at the time, that losing him would be hard for Dean, but he had assumed Dean would move on, knowing it was for the greater good. It still shocks him, how much he’d underestimated Dean’s care—Dean’s love—for him. His need for him. ‘Has it really been six months?’
But Cas jerks away, standing with his back toward Dean. ‘Don’t.’
‘Because I said so.’ Dean plants his hands on Cas’s shoulders, crowding him back toward the bed, until Cas’s knees hit the mattress and he goes down with an indignant ‘oof’ and roll of his eyes.
Cas runs a hand over Dean’s face and they kiss.
‘Glad to hear it,’ Dean says, tearing open the waxed paper and biting into his sandwich.
Castiel grunts. His arm is slung over Dean’s waist, so he tightens his hold, pulling Dean closer. He lets his hand drift until it’s resting at the small of Dean’s back, fingers teasing the swell of his ass.
There’s no point. Lucifer is living it up in Cas’s head and, even if he wasn’t, Dean’s not sure Cas would want…
At the door, Dean pauses, then he turns to Castiel and holds out his hand. Castiel frowns at it a moment but when Dean waggles it, Castiel slips his hand into Dean’s hold. They walk out to the lake hand in hand and Castiel can’t remember the last time he felt such peace and joy.
Cas kicks Dean under the table. ‘
A shuttered look overtakes Dean’s face. ‘Like we’re soulmates?’
is met with an eye-roll from Sam, a blank look from Cas and Jack saying ‘I love that movie!’—on his own, or who knows where he’ll end up, or what else he might do?
‘Trying to lighten the mood. It work?’
‘Oh. Good.’ Dean huffs, eyes crinkling and the corners of his mouth ticking up. He looks at Castiel’s wings a moment longer, then back to Castiel’s face. There is a determined look in his eyes as he gets up on his knees, shuffling closer to Castiel. He takes Castiel’s face in his hands, thumbs stroking over his cheeks, and then he leans in and they’re kissing.
The downpour grows heavier, and the dead leaves and dirt beneath them become slippery. Castiel nearly slips on them once or twice, but it’s Dean who stumbles and falls as they make their way down a slight incline.
Dean’s stomach swoops, and heat simmers in his blood. But it’s a physical reaction. His body is saying he could get on board, but his brain is another thing entirely. ‘I’m sure it does,’ he says, ‘but I’m not in the mood, right now.’
‘We were both stubborn.’ Cas looks down at his lap. ‘I regret any time I hurt you—’
Dean hums.
‘This coming from the guy who forgets to go to the bathroom sometimes.’
The smile Dean gives him is worth biting his tongue. Dean huffs and says, ‘Nah, didn’t know that… Australia, huh?’
Cas lifts his shoulders.
Unless…
‘Yeah, I, uh, hit my foot.’ Dean clears his throat. ‘On the fireplace.’
‘What for?’
The next time Dean finds an issue with the decor—this time, the placement of a bookcase—Castiel stops him with a hand curled around his wrist. ‘It can wait until morning.’
‘Oh.’ Dean lets out a low, long breath. ‘That explains that, then.’ He looks at Cas, who looks…awed. And a little proud. Dean’s lips twitch.
‘Cool.’ Dean chews on his lip, doesn’t move. ‘Um…’
Dean tucks his arm under the pillow, the corner of his mouth ticking up. ‘Morning, sleepyhead.’
Cas blinks. ‘Yes.’
‘It’s Vulcan.’
‘…can’t breathe.’
‘I mean, I know you’re powered down these days, so if it’s gonna use up too much juice… It’s not important, or anything.’
‘All right.’
, I don’t understand why you would say everything you did before—’ Dean’s throat clicks. He sucks in a breath. Maybe he should stop, maybe he’s being unfair, but— ‘I thought they were true, those things you said. They made me feel like… Like I was a better person.’
He sits in the dark, Cas’s words ringing in his ears.
‘I did not.’
‘I’m Jack. Don’t…’ Jack’s eyes widen and he opens and closes his hands. ‘You don’t know me.’
‘Dean.’ Castiel fixes Dean with an incredulous look. How can he ask that? Can’t he see? ‘They’re a disgrace.’
‘Right.’ Dean rolls over, burying his face in the pillow. Moments later, Cas’s hands land on him, strong and warm, somehow seeking out every sore and tender spot with unerring accuracy. No one’s ever done this for Dean, either, not unless there was sex involved. And, sure, he wants that with Cas, wants everything, but there’s no expectation in Cas’s touch. Just the want to help, to repay Dean.
Cas nods.
‘And you’re definitely cool with not getting married?’ Maybe he’ll still buy Cas a ring, though. Maybe Cas will want to buy him one, too. That would be cool.
, but Dean has been strange since they left the bunker. Castiel had thought—hoped—it was the case. But maybe it’s just him.
,’ Jack says, ‘but—’
The beatific smile that had lit up Cas’s face as The Empty took him is burned into Dean’s memory. It’s the kind of smile that, any other time, would have made Dean’s heart soar and his stomach do that annoying twisting flip that only Cas can kindle. But watching Cas smile like that when… Well, it had only torn his guts out. Actually, having his guts torn out hurt less.
if you’re into reblogging those things (I've got a new one for this chapter) thanks in advance to anyone who checks it out :)
Inside, Castiel is a jumble of emotions—hope, anxiety, and a healthy dose of bewilderment—but outside he tries to remain calm for Dean’s sake. ‘Yes?’
‘Deal,’ Castiel says, then kisses Dean softly.
Dean’s brows raise. He pulls out the chair by Cas’s desk, drags it to the side of his bed. ‘Talk to me.’
‘Yeah, I, uh… I want to talk.’ Dean catches Castiel’s gaze, unwavering; he runs a hand over the back of his neck. ‘Heh. I guess now’s as good a time as any, and it’s real nice out here.’
‘You like it when I watch you sleep.’
Sam’s present is next: a pair of boxer briefs and some socks. It’s a joke, mostly, a nod to the dismal presents of their past. But when Dean looks up and catches Sam’s eye, he knows it’s sentimental, too. That Sam is saying things might have changed—for the better, so much for the better—but they’re still them in the ways that matter most.
Dean searches Cas’s gaze, trying to figure if he’s being sincere, or not. ‘Well, yeah. If you don’t wanna be alone you can… You can come to me, man.’ His face is hot and his hands might be trembling. He presses them flatter to the table and repeats, ‘You can come to me. Any time.’
‘What time is it?’ It must be later than Dean thought. He took his watch off when he was working on Baby, and can’t remember where he put it down.
He lets out a low, breathy moan when Dean sinks his fingers right in.
‘If you feel weird or worried about anything,’ Dean says, ‘you gotta tell me, okay?’
packages.
The lights buzz, electricity hums: the bunker singing its nocturne. Dean raises his hand and knocks.
‘Dean—’ Castiel sighs. He knows Dean isn’t going to back down and he rolls his eyes. ‘Well, the view by the lake was nice. I’d like to go back there.’
‘The Berlin one.’ Dean hums, smooth and low. ‘You know, from
‘Dean, let go of me,’ Cas says, as though he couldn’t shake Dean off. ‘You saw what he did.’
Dean presses a finger to Cas’s lips. ‘It’s awesome. OK?’
The emotion in Dean’s voice leaves Castiel winded and all he can say is, ‘Got it,’ voice barely above a whisper.
‘It’s your birthday,’ Cas says, as though that explains anything.
, feel the same.
‘I didn’t mean sex, Dean.’
‘Okay.’ Dean leans back; he’s jiggling his knee, and it brushes achingly against Castiel’s with every bounce.
that? Cut right through Dean’s bullshit and hear what he’s really saying.
Cas’s lips twitch. It looks like he might say something, but then there’s a knock at the door.
‘Hey, Cas,’ Dean says.
There’s a hand on Dean’s shoulder, a welcome familiar weight. He turns his head, lips brushing knuckles.
A wave of ecstasy rolls through Castiel. It’s not like when they make love, that sends him soaring, yes, but it’s earthy, too. Grounded. This is like nothing he’s ever felt. Not better. Just different.
‘Guess so,’ Dean says, voice hoarse. His hands twitch at his sides before he crosses his arms. ‘Can I help? Or is it, you know, private?’
‘You’re my dads,’ Jack says, simply. Like he hasn’t just dropped the biggest damn bombshell. Screw the apocalypse, this kid says he and Cas are
‘Am I being grounded?’
‘Awesome!’ Dean punches Castiel in the shoulder, then blushes. ‘Let’s go for a walk.’
At Dean’s slow nod, Cas pushes at his shoulders until Dean is lying down, Cas sitting by his hip. ‘Um.’
part of him that feels foolish at the thought of doing this at his age. So, he waves his hand and says, ‘Nah, you’ve got it covered,’ and retreats to the sanctuary of the garish beach umbrella.
‘You kept this.’
‘I meant that in a good way.’
‘Shit, sorry,’ Dean says. ‘Didn’t mean to hurt you,’ he adds and, for a moment, Castiel can almost believe he’s not talking about the feather.
Cas lays his hand on top of Dean’s, and it’s warm and grounding. He says, ‘Who?’ fingers curling over Dean’s.
Nice to get away… Castiel blinks. ‘Is this a vacation?’ He’s never been on vacation. He’s existed for eons
‘Tell me the truth.’ Dean’s voice is softer when he adds, ‘C’mon, man. Talk to me.’
The thought roils in Dean’s gut, and he’s hit all over again with how much Cas has given up for him over the years. ‘That…sucks.’ It’s a pathetic thing to say, but Dean doesn’t have words to express what he feels, right now. He moves his hands down, easing along Cas’s spine, ignoring the guilt still churning away.
‘I— Yes, maybe.’
‘Anyway,’ Dean says, cutting Cas off, the last of the nerve that’s filled him the past few days wavering, ‘if you change your mind about wanting company, you know where I am.’
‘Yes.’
For a moment, Castiel preens, then Dean’s words sink in. ‘
‘It’s nothing,’ Dean says, voice rasping, ‘go back to sleep.’
‘You two.’
Cas winces, but he meets Dean’s eyes when he says, ‘Yes.’
‘Are you OK?’
. And he looks like Cas. And something in Dean is screaming to help him, not hurt him. It’s confusing, and it makes no damn sense, but when Cas reaches out, Dean stops him.
Cas shakes his head. ‘No, they’re too bright, like you said.’
Dean starts to protest the reproach in Cas’s voice, is going to say it’s not a big deal, but the words die in his throat, and he ends up saying, ‘Sorry,’ surprising both himself and Cas if the raise of Cas’s brows is any indication.
Cas frowns. ‘I didn’t say anything.’
it, but if it’s what he thinks it is, he doesn’t want to know right now. So, he gives Dean a smile and says, ‘It’s good to be here with you,’ and finishes chopping, wondering if it’s the dread or the tiny spark of hope making his stomach churn.
‘Aw, gee, Cas. Not getting sappy on me, are you?’ Despite his words, Dean is smiling and there’s a pleased flush in his cheeks.
And it’s nice to hold Cas, but it’s not—
It’s going to be like that, then. Cas pulling away, and Dean not knowing why, and trying to make his stupid mouth cooperate. He sighs, poking sullenly at what’s left of his breakfast, but a shadow moves past him and Cas slides back into his seat at the table, mug refilled, and Dean’s heart leaps.
‘Oh… Okay.’
It makes Dean’s stomach twist in a different way and he’s stepping closer, saying, ‘Are you OK?’ because maybe Cas is sick. It would be like him, to avoid Dean if he’s sick, not wanting to be a burden, or something stupid like that.
It’s so different to hold Dean when neither of them are facing imminent death, or coming back from the brink of it. To just be allowed to hold him for no other reason than Castiel wants to. And Dean wants to, as well. It’s in the way his fingers dig into Castiel’s shoulders,
Dean needed a win, and Cas is home. He’s giddy, can’t remember the last time he felt this light.
It’s just the two of them tonight. Sam and Eileen are working a job in Wichita. Well, they’re tracking down some lore books that, somehow, the Men of Letters didn’t have, because that’s what they do now. Track down books and lore for other people’s hunts because they’ve turned the bunker into a hunter hub.
‘More intimate than—’
Dean’s lips are gently parted, eyes half-lidded. ‘Fuck.’
Castiel shifts his weight. ‘What do you mean?’
There are a few moments of confusing, terrifying silence, and then Cas is crossing the room and he’s standing in front of Dean. ‘You told Sam,’ he says.
the bad guys are defeated. It’s a…’ Jack trails off, then flashes a bright smile when he finally finds the words he’s after: ‘A happily ever after castle.’
One night, as they’re lying by the fire together, Dean says, ‘Man, this is awesome, don’t get me wrong, but it’ll be good to get home.’
:) (or just feel free to come say hi over there!)
Guilt swishes uneasily in Castiel’s gut, and his heart clenches. ‘You haven’t. I’m right here.’
Dean gulps some of his wine, glances at Castiel. ‘So, uh, how you feeling?’
‘Are you OK?’ Dean asks.
’I don’t want to forget it.’ Dean lifts his shoulders and meets Castiel’s gaze.
He’s so lost in it that, if he weren’t so tuned in to Cas, he might not have noticed Cas kneeling beside the tub, his eyes dark and focussed on Dean. He’s so close Dean imagines he can feel heat radiating off of him, but it’s probably just rising up from the water. But when Cas produces a washcloth from somewhere, dipping it in the water and running it down Dean’s arm, an inner heat overcomes Dean.
‘About what?’
Castiel turns and grabs Dean’s arm. ‘Do you really want it back?’
Dean lifts his hands to Cas’s face, cradling his jaw, and pulls Cas to him. Their mouths slot together, and it’s somehow new and familiar all at once. Dean never thought that old cliché about the rest of the world falling away when you kiss someone was true. But kissing Cas is
Cas nods.
‘I just want you to have a good day. You deserve it.’
‘I—’ And, yeah, Dean had kind of said that. But he didn’t think Cas would
Castiel fucks him through it, chasing his own orgasm, spilling inside Dean not long after. He pulls Dean close to his chest, taking Dean’s hand and twining their fingers together.
‘You were happy before,’ Cas says, ‘or I thought you were. What happened?’
Dean sputters, rolling onto his back and covering his eyes with his arm. It’s a little dramatic. ‘Out of everything,’ he says, ‘the volleyball is what you remember?’
‘Yes, Dean, you know how easily I tire of your company.’ Castiel rolls his eyes, and Dean huffs.
Castiel’s pulse flutters, but he lifts a brow as he peers down at Dean. ‘Is that so?’
‘Yeah, it’s awesome. Thanks.’ Dean loops it over his head, pulling the slide up, and winks at Jack, who beams at him.
‘Hey, before you scramble our noggins, I gotta know one thing,’ Dean says. When Jack nods, he adds, ‘If you’re Lucifer’s kid, how come you look so much like Cas?’
Dean shifts on the couch. ‘It’s kind of equivalent to friend but can also mean brother or…lover.’ He flushes. It’s dumb because they
‘Well, I’ve already had a good day. Anything else is a bonus.’
Cas frowns. ‘I don’t care if you’re bad at sex, Dean.’
Cas nods, eyes darting down, then away.
Sleep pulls Dean under, and he sleeps through the rest of the night, bad dreams dispelled by Cas’s hands and the steady beat of his heart.
Dean hesitates a moment—glancing at the chair by the desk—before he carefully settles behind Castiel. The mattress dips beneath his weight, and his knees touch Castiel’s hips. His fingers skim Castiel’s primaries, sending a shiver through him. ‘That hurt?’ Dean asks.
Cas rolls his eyes, but he slides his hand into Dean’s as he says, ‘Of course, Dean.’
This is too much. Too fucking weird, even for them. And he shouldn’t want this, shouldn’t want Cas to do this for him like he’s a kid and—
‘Nothing,’ Castiel says, then, ‘I love you.’
‘Dean? Are you OK?’
Dean shakes his head. ‘I can’t.’
Sam makes a noise that’s half disapproving, half resigned, which Dean ignores.
to tip Dean over the edge. But he’s been wound up for
‘Not— Not like this. I can’t.’ It is too much, Cas was right. He doesn’t know why he can’t, when it’s all he’s wanted to say for
‘Yes, I’m done.’
(Well, they had the arguments and movie nights, before, but still).
‘I’ll come with you.’ Cas tilts to his feet, dusting down his shorts, which are the same Hawaiian pineapple print as Dean’s, but with a sky blue background. ‘I’d like to stretch my legs.’ He looks down at Jack and says, ‘Are you coming?’
The hitch in Cas’s breath as Dean kisses his jaw, down to his neck, instils him with some of the confidence he’s lost over the past ten minutes. Maybe he’s going to be awkward and fumble a bit, but he can make Cas gasp by kissing him below his ear and that’s
‘I’m kinda getting that.’ Dean huffs. ‘But, hey, don’t beat yourself up too much. I didn’t know how you felt, either.’ He chews his lip. He still feels all churned up inside, not relieved like he’d thought he would. A beat of silence passes, and then another, before Dean says, ‘You know, I figured you’d be happier,’ not quite looking at Cas.
‘Did you forget to reapply the sunscreen?’
, and Castiel was too damn blinded by his certainty that Dean could never feel the same to see something so obvious.
Castiel tips his chin up with one finger. ‘Dean?’
The look Dean gives him is surprised, but pleased, even as he raises a brow and says, ‘Trying to tell me something?’
’That’s an understatement.’ Dean sighs. ‘It’s just, the movie didn’t make me think of all those other people, Cas. It made me think of…’
‘Maybe we should pick a different date to celebrate.’
Dean looks up, catching Castiel’s gaze and holding it. ‘I gotta tell you something.’
And now… Now, he
‘Yeah, looking forward to meeting you again,’ Dean says. ‘Or, uh, for the first time.’ He hates time travel.
‘OK. Well, if you want company…’
There are a few more moments of tense silence and then Dean says, ‘Could you put it back?’ His tone is offhand, like he’s merely asking if it’s something within the realm of possibilities, not a request. But Castiel knows Dean well enough to read beneath it.
Dean suppresses a snort. They
If Dean thought his face was on fire before, it’s nothing compared to now. ‘Pshh. I know how it works! I just…’ He looks at Sam, but he’s no help because he has that constipated look like he’s trying not to laugh, and Dean ends up saying, ‘Angels?’ with a shrug.
‘Uh, yeah, you did. The image is seared into my brain.’
, like when he keeps flinching, and Dean gets, it now. He knows that look. He saw it in the mirror often enough when his own old man—
Castiel rolls his eyes but, seeing how tired Dean looks, says, ‘I’ll do it, you sit down and rest,’ nodding to the leather armchair in the corner.
‘I liked making you the sandwich.’
‘No, we haven’t,’ Sam says, too quickly.
The cake Jack made and decorated with the help of Sam and Eileen—Cas was banned from the kitchen after what they’ve dubbed the nacho disaster—is wheeled out, blazing with candles, and an off-key rendition of ‘Happy birthday’ is sung.
Dean hums, shrugging a shoulder, but it’s clear that he does.
‘Lake it is.’ Dean stands and pushes his chair under the table.
‘What does it mean?’
Dean wriggles, pressing back against Cas’s erection, satisfied when Cas sucks in a sharp breath. ‘Need me to take care of that?’
‘What?’
Cas answers with a simple, gruff, ‘Yes.’
‘I think I’m clean enough.’
Damn, but he can be stubborn. ‘I don’t know, it’s not comfortable?’
Their hands brush as they walk down the hall, little sparks shooting up Dean’s arm with every movement. They stand close as they move around the kitchen, making spaghetti together. And when they sit, their feet tangle beneath the table.
‘No, no, I want.’ Dean swallows. ‘But how the hell am I meant to
Something of his frustration must show because Dean stills above him, running his hand over Castiel’s forehead, and saying, ‘You okay?’
Cas shifts closer, pressed into Dean’s side, the hand on his knee sliding north a little. ‘I’ve read that touch is comforting. It can boost serotonin and other hormones.’
And Castiel does want. From the very depths of him, with every atom in his being. He
Dean grunts, but there’s a faint hint of colour in his cheeks. He’s so unbearably beautiful, and Castiel has to look back to the lake to catch his breath.
‘Jesus Christ, Cas,’ Dean says, ‘are you ever going to stop doing that?’
, haunts Dean. The image of Cas leaving the bunker after Dean kicked him out haunts him more.
‘No!’ Dean jerks awake, the last vestiges of his nightmare fogging his brain and tightening his throat. He gulps air as he sits, leaning forward, elbows braced on his knees.
Sam is eating his salad, drinking his beer; Eileen and Jack are in the middle of an animated conversation Dean only partly understands, and then Eileen looks at him and says, ‘I was telling Jack I like the sandcastle. It was something I never got to do, growing up.’
his heart, it’s thunder. ‘What did you want to say?’
together, but something unfurls in Dean’s chest as he watches them. Something liquid warm and bright.
There’s a hint of haughtiness to Cas’s tone that unspools some of the tightness wound up in Dean’s chest. But it’s not enough to settle his unease entirely. ‘I’m just saying that I might be out of practice is all.’
‘That poster doesn’t look right there.’ Dean throws off the covers, crossing the room to fiddle with a framed poster for
Dean nods and grabs Castiel’s hand, pressing a kiss to his palm, before shuffling over to the bed. The mattress is still bare, and he drops his head back and groans. ‘Knew we shoulda made up the bed first.’
Cas dips the cloth in the water again, brushing Dean’s knee, then brings it back to his shoulder. Water slides down his bicep, gathering in the crease of his elbow; the cloth is rough, old and threadbare, but it’s Cas touching him with it, so Dean doesn’t mind.
Dean wakes slowly, pulling his blankets tighter around himself. He resists the urge to open his eyes, but he’s too well-rested and they open without his permission. The familiar lines of the room come into focus and he turns to see if Cas is awake, yet, but—
‘I don’t know that word.’
‘Let me see.’
‘You said I could borrow clothes.’ Cas’s gaze swings slowly to Dean. There’s a wrongness to his voice that sets Dean on alert.
‘And what’s this going to do?’
‘You should roll over.’
‘That doesn’t seem fair.’
‘Because you’re human, now, and humans stink if they wear the same clothes all the time.’
‘You do.’
Jack’s hands twitch at his sides and he steps forward, his hands raised.
‘Hello?’ Cas tilts his head, looking from the woman, to Dean, and back.
‘You said to pick anything I like.’ Cas crosses his arms. It pulls his shirt tight over his biceps, the v of the unbuttoned collar deepening, showing a long throat and the hint of a toned chest. ‘I like this shirt.’
‘Yes, and I love you, too.’
‘Right.’ It’s a flimsy excuse, a kiss-off, a kick in the guts, but Dean waits a beat, and then two, hopeful heart in his throat, before he adds, ‘I guess I’ll leave you to it.’
‘He’s scared.’ Dean adds, softer, ‘You’re— We’re his dads, or in the future we are, and he’s
is a truly great movie
But please feel free to come find me on Tumblr
‘You don’t need to
‘Yeah?’
Dean doesn’t answer, just runs his hands down the length of Cas’s back, digging his thumbs into the base of his spine. The soft, small sound Cas lets out is equal parts pleasure and surprise. It curls, warm and low, within Dean; it occurs to him that no one else has touched Cas like this. That it’s unlikely anyone has ever touched him with tenderness and care at all. A pang of guilt shoots through him, tangling with the honeyed warmth suffusing him.
Yeah. What
The words twist in Castiel’s chest, and his voice is small around it when he says, ‘Is that all it was? Repayment?’
The desire withers, though, when Cas freezes, shoulders hunching as he turns to Dean. The murky light casts a halo around his head; his brows are furrowed, eyes wide beneath them. ‘Dean.’ He swallows, hands opening and closing at his sides.
Aftershocks shudder through him, way too intense for a hand job, and Cas is kissing him and murmuring in his ear, and it’s another cliché, but it’s never been like this. When he comes back to himself, he realises Cas’s dick is still hard against his back; Dean may be many things, but he’s not a selfish lover, so he says, ‘What about you?’
Cas considers Dean a moment, then he disentangles himself and settles back on the opposite side of the tub. His lips are parted and shining, and there’s a red mark at the base of his neck, and his chest is glistening, and he’s right there and he wants Dean. He reaches out a hand, beckoning Dean to him.
Castiel frowns. ‘Yes, I’m an angel.’ He huffs and adds, ruefully, ‘Barely.’
The pipes throb and shudder in the walls, bringing Dean back to the present, and then there is the soft slap of footsteps down the hall. Dean darts to his door, blood tingling in his veins. He presses his forehead to cool wood, hand curled tight around the doorknob. He’s waiting for the right moment so it seems like he’s just casually opened the door and run into Cas, and not like it’s planned.
Dean licks his lips. ‘Whatever. Knock yourself out.’ But he is quick to shuck his overshirt and push his t-shirt up, revealing his shoulder. There’s a light in his eyes that wasn’t there when Castiel found him and his breathing is a little shallower.
They stare at each other a few moments, wrapped in coloured light, before Cas simply says, ‘Thank you.’
‘You can be honest, Dean, I won’t be offended.’
‘Really?’ Dean raises his brows, but there’s the hint of a smile playing at the corner of his lips, so Castiel considers it a win. There’s still a haunted look in his eyes, though, and Castiel would do anything to banish it.
‘What?’
‘I’m Jack.’ Jack has his hand raised in that little wave again. ‘I’m from the future.’
It’s both thrilling and terrifying how Cas knows how to touch him when they barely touch each other. When Dean only allows himself to touch Cas if it’s life-or-death or can be brushed off as friendly. When barely anyone touches him at all, these days, except for Cas or Sam. Unless you count the monsters they fight.
There’s a not-so-secret thrill that Cas lets him do it. Humours him. It’s not like Dean doesn’t know. Doesn’t delight in it.
Dean rolls onto his side, away from Castiel, reaches out to turn the bedside lamp off, but stops. He casts a look over his shoulder and says, ‘Cas?’
Despite his earlier protest, Cas does a damn good impression of Spock that leaves Dean squirming and wondering how he got so damn lucky with this awesome, amazing man.
‘Move it or lose it, Sammy, I’m making dinner.’
Dean smiles, and Castiel kisses him. The way he’s longed to for years. And then Dean tilts his head, hands coming up to Castiel’s waist, and they’re kissing each other.
‘Dean?’
Cas is frowning, gaze fixed somewhere past his shoulder. ‘Why are you taking the lights down?’
Mentions of Dean grieving (in the past) and there is also a brief beginning of a panic attack (but not full blown) in this chapter
‘No.’ Castiel huffs. ‘I mean, I don’t feel weird about that. I’d like it. A lot.’
Cas and Jack are sitting in the sand—Cas crouching, hands dangling between his knees, Jack cross-legged and back straight—either side of a rather forlorn-looking sandcastle. It should be amusing, a mostly former angel of the lord and a Nephilim building a damn
‘Anything important?’ Cas asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
A bruise blooms along Dean’s side, red and angry; Dean swallows thickly, a shiver running through him at Cas’s touch. ‘Uh, yeah, forgot about that.’
Dean’s pulse leaps. ‘Yes?’
‘Maybe.’
Candlelight flickers across the polished surface of the dark wood table; it softens everything in the room except the uneasiness etched in the lines of Dean’s face. He’s jittery, even more than he was earlier.
‘You know how earlier I said maybe there wasn’t a word for what you are to me?’
‘What does that even mean?’
That part of him, the part that never had this, the part that’s raw and aching, that part of him that just…wants. He lets it take over, for once, and tries not to think about what happens next, or that Sam is somewhere in the bunker maybe wondering where he and Cas are.
‘Like I said, nothing.’
The thing is, Dean really likes the kid. He’s goofy and awkward, and Dean’s gut tells him he’s a good kid. Even Cas seems to have softened toward him. And if Dean had a hand in raising Jack, then his future self must be all right. They clearly come out of this apocalypse mess on the other side, anyway.
‘Nope.’ Dean tugs Cas around until their positions are swapped.
‘Cas—’
‘The lights.’
‘For now.’
‘No.’
‘Is that… Is that good?’
And then he looks back to Cas, who is everything Dean never let himself wish for, and who is looking at Dean like he’s the fucking world. It’s almost too much, again, but this time Dean breathes through it and lets his head rest against Cas’s.
‘Making sure you’re not losing your touch.’ Dean grins and Sam rolls his eyes. Dean looks around Sam at the pan, eyes narrowing. ‘You better not be tainting my bacon with any of your rabbit food.’
. Or at least not this hard.’
Castiel’s instinct is to protest. They are his wings, so they’re his responsibility. But he can’t groom them properly with his grace so depleted. And there’s a selfish part of him that just wants Dean to touch him.
It’s simple enough, volleying questions back and forth—
Cas sighs. ‘Dean.’
Dean points his finger at Sam. ‘Shut your mouth.’
Dean makes a choked noise. Somehow, this is more embarrassing than Cas’s earnest questions and frank talk about sex. Often when they’re in the middle of it. But it’s Cas, so he says, ‘Well, I guess I do like sleeping more on my stomach.’
Castiel pauses, narrowing his eyes. ‘I do,’ he says, and then presses his finger in halfway.
Thanks so much for reading! And for the comments/kudos/etc along the way - really glad people have enjoyed this :)
‘Yeah, recliners will do that.’ Dean’s own back twinges in sympathy. He tries to concentrate on that, and not how Cas’s mysteriously acquired sweatshirt has ridden up, or, shit, the outline of his dick through the pants. Jesus. Is he even wearing underwear?
‘You’re one of the most important people in the world to me, Cas. You and Sam and Jack— We’re family, and I know I’ve told you that before, but it was never enough. I never—’ He turns his hand so that he can hold Cas’s properly. It steels him, the feeling of Cas’s hand in his and he takes in a deep, shuddering breath.
‘It’s not that…’ Dean sighs and disentangles himself, sitting again. He drags a hand down his face. ‘I don’t know what’s wrong.’
After the tense conversation sparked by the bloody handprint on Dean’s jacket, Cas had asked if Dean would take him to buy some new clothes. Even though it was Dean’s suggestion in the first place, part of him had been disappointed he wouldn’t get to see Cas wearing his clothes. But it was good to get out of the bunker, drive around, even if it was only into town.
Damn, where did Cas learn to kiss like this? On second thought, Dean doesn’t want to know. A few minutes ago, he’d been excited to share a bed with Cas at all, not sure if Cas would want to take things slow, or not. He’d only wanted Cas in his room with him.
Dean nods, even though he
‘Always?’ When Dean doesn’t answer, Castiel turns around again.
‘It’s fine. You should rest.’
‘Close your eyes.’
‘Hey,’ Dean says, breathless.
Cas hesitates, flicking a glance down the hall toward his room, before he finally crosses the threshold. He folds his arms over his chest, then lets them hang by his sides.
A tingling feeling grows in Castiel’s stomach as he watches Dean lift himself, guiding Castiel’s cock between his legs. Castiel steadies Dean with a hand to his hip, mouth dry as Dean sinks slowly down.
‘If that were true, you wouldn’t still be having nightmares.’
Dean sighs and says, ‘Yeah, come on,’ and leads the way back to his party, making a mental note to dig out his Douglas Adams omnibus later.
‘Did you just mojo the water clean?’
‘Just a little bit.’ Jack smiles. ‘And I’m back now. And I didn’t do anything bad.’
‘Dean, are you okay?’
changed much for me. I mean, it’s amazing, and it’s changed the whole celibate thing I had going on. But what we have…it was always more than friendship.’ He looks at Castiel. ‘Does it really feel that different for you between us?’
‘Yep.’ It’s a lie in one word, so Dean kisses Cas again before he can see through it.
‘I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking you.’
Dean rubs the back of his neck. ‘Just…’ He lifts his shoulders; he looks a little uncertain again. ‘Look, I’m usually all “no glove, no love”, but I’m clean, and I figure you being recently an angel, you’d be, too, so we don’t have to use one. Unless you wanna?’
‘I’m not usually chipper,’ Dean quips, then adds, ‘Anyway, I slept better than usual,’ grinning with his tongue between his teeth.
‘Yeah.’ Dean doesn’t have to ask if Cas is okay with that—it’s in his eyes and the awed tone of his voice. But then a thought occurs to Dean, that maybe Cas isn’t being self-sacrificing at all. ‘I mean, if
Dean doesn’t point out that Cas almost always did touch him, whether he needed to or not, and says, ‘That doesn’t matter.’
pissed. Not really. It’s an automatic reaction. He wanted Cas there, not because they needed his help, but because he always wants Cas there. Always wants Cas with him. And wants—needs—to know Cas wants to be where he is, too.
Dean lifts a shoulder. ‘I don’t know. The angel thing.’
‘I know that.’ Dean sounds annoyed, but beneath it, he’s breathless.
, maybe they’re cute or sweet to her. Or maybe she thinks they’re a bunch of nut-jobs. It doesn’t matter.
‘Comfortable for what?’
‘I thought this wasn’t a case.’
‘That’s not what I meant.’ At Dean’s frown, Cas adds, ‘I’m surprised you’d willingly take a break.’
Most of the floor space is taken up by a large claw-footed tub; Castiel finds Dean perched on the edge of it, peering down at his ankle, which he rolls one way, then the other. His face is pale and drawn, but Castiel has seen him looking worse.
‘Here,’ Dean says, already leaning up and over the table, ‘let me...’ He swipes the pad of his thumb over Cas’s chin, stubble prickling his skin. ‘Just some egg.’ He settles back and wipes his hand off on his pants.
‘Yeah yeah,’ Claire says, ‘I know it’s your birthday, but don’t get all sentimental on me.’ She pulls away, but her eyes are a little glassy, and she’s smiling up at Dean all fond. She clears her throat and thrusts the gift bag at him. ‘Happy birthday.’
Dean hesitates, the way he always does, but soon relents with a nod; Castiel knows it’s both from his own desire and his knowledge Castiel won’t back down.
ETA: I deleted part of my original note because I think I confused everyone by mentioning this started life as a one shot (but this chapter was not the one shot I was aiming to write, I just ended up expanding part of that and including some other ideas) but do not fear, this is definitely not a one shot! I’d feel too cruel leaving it here 😂 (plus I have some things I’m really looking forward to writing)
‘I understand the reference.’
Cas’s eyes narrow and Dean huffs, saying, ‘C’mere,’ reaching out to tug Cas until they’re sitting side by side.
‘Maybe.’
Dean downs the rest of his whisky, standing and turning away. His shoulders are a tense line, even as he looks back at Castiel and says, ‘You coming?’
‘I’m cool without it.’
‘Whatever, the important thing is, maybe you wanted to kiss Cas, and maybe you didn’t, but you should talk to him, either way.’
‘I kicked it!’ Dean looks off to the side. ‘I kicked the fireplace, okay?’
‘You know, life, the universe and everything.’
And hadn’t he basically just said it himself? ‘Shit. Maybe they were.’
‘No.’ Dean smirks. ‘But…it’s weird, it hasn’t
Warmth rushes Castiel from head to toe, and he’s suddenly too aware that he’s standing while Dean is still sitting and Dean’s face is right— He shifts his weight and says, ’Thank you?’
,’ eyes flaring gold and all the furniture in the room rattles and the walls shake.
Dean, and Dean feels warm.
‘Yeah, well,’ Dean says, a faint tinge of pink in his cheeks, ‘you’re not so bad looking yourself.’
‘No, why would I?’
But then Dean is out of bed again, fussing with the same posters from before.
, but he thought it might be awkward, though at the moment he has no idea why. ‘You know, I thought…’
‘I—’ Castiel’s heart beats hard, and he’s not quite sure why. ‘I didn’t think you’d want it.’
‘Just—’ One shuddering breath, then another, and Dean says, ‘
. It’s just us turned up to eleven.’
But he thinks about it—what it is, what it means. If it’s Castiel’s brand on his soul.
‘Giving you a back rub.’ It sounds like a bad line, like the beginning of some cheesy porno. Dean takes comfort in the fact that the suggestiveness will probably go over Cas’s head, even though this is still something they don’t do. His stomach does a somersault in slow-motion at the newness of touching Cas like this.
Cas rolls his eyes, but there’s a smile playing at the corner of his lips, and he crouches with Dean, picking up some shells, discarding others. As Dean reaches to put a particularly nice, big shell in the bucket, Cas grabs his wrist. He’s squinting at Dean’s forearm, then looks up to Dean.
‘I always thought Spock and Kirk were in love,’ Cas says.
Dean shifts and cuts his gaze away, and Castiel’s stomach drops. He doesn’t need his grace to sense that Dean is uncomfortable, but that’s all he’s getting. He doesn’t know
Sam turns, brows raised.
. ‘Fine,’ Castiel says, swallowing heavily. ‘The food is very good. Thank you.’
It’s not until later, when the groceries are put away, and they settle in to watch their nightly movie—tonight it’s
They don’t talk about what happens when they leave the cabin and go back to the bunker, the real world. Castiel isn’t sure if it’s because there’s nothing to talk about, or because there’s too much to say.
(which is my main and vaguely multi-fandom)
‘No, stop there.’ Dean holds up a hand. ‘You’re going to read some Douglas Adams, and then we’re having this conversation.’
The weight of Dean above him is strange, but it feels good to be this close—the press of their bodies, the slide of their tongues, the sounds Dean makes when Castiel sinks his hands into Dean’s hair, holding tight.
‘Shut up.’
Dean sucks in a breath, but he lowers his hands and lifts his head. He turns his face side to side, not meeting Cas’s eyes. ‘See. Fine.’
But it’s been
. Oh, he can guess, and mostly he lands on three words he said to Dean that saved him and changed things irrevocably between them. For good, or bad, remains to be seen.
‘What?’
‘You would have done it if I’d spilled the wine on myself,’ Castiel says.
‘For dinner, yesterday.’ From over Cas’s shoulder, Dean sees him raise his hands, palms turned toward him, like he’s studying them. ‘I used to be able to heal you. Help you in ways I can’t, now. But I can still make you a sandwich.’ He huffs, dropping his hands. ‘That sounds foolish, I know.’
Deans swallows thickly and looks away. His eyes feel hot and damp and his throat is tight and his chest feels full to bursting. He loops the bracelet around his wrist, the metal cool against his pulse, and does the clasp up. He likes the weight of it on his wrist and the thought of Cas’s words pressing against his skin.
He can perform ‘parlour tricks’, heal small nicks and cuts, hear prayers and sense emotions in their broadest sense. He is still stronger than a human, but he can no longer lay waste to their foes with the touch of his palm. He still has his wings, but they are as useless as they have been for years.
,’ Dean snaps. ‘Turn it off.’
‘Guess I wanted something permanent in case…’ Dean’s breath catches and he squares his jaw.
‘You’re welcome.’
‘I’m not.’ Sam shakes his head, then he smiles and says, ‘Happy birthday, man,’ wrapping Dean in a one-armed hug. He shoves Dean away, waving his spatula. ‘Now go sit down while we finish.’
Dean’s hands still. He tries to connect the dots from back rubs to sandwiches and comes up short. ‘Huh?’
(which is my main and vaguely multi-fandom)
. And then Cas rolls them over, pinning Dean’s hands either side of his head, and their laughs subside.
‘I kissed you because—’ Dean lets out a shaky breath. He can do this. He looks Cas in the eyes and finally says it: ‘Because I love you, too.’
‘Yes?’
‘Yes, Dean.’
Dean shifts, eyes darting around. This is
.’ Cas huffs. ‘That makes it sound like I’m incontinent, Dean. I just find it inconvenient and annoying—’
Dean finally drags his gaze away from Castiel’s bedraggled wings to his face. His brow furrows in concern. ‘Hey, you’re just recovering. You’ll get your mojo back.’
The hand on his shoulder squeezes. ‘Dean.’
‘What the fuck?’ Dean says.
It should be easy. This should be easy. Cas laid the groundwork and all it should have taken was for Dean to speak his piece, and they could— They could be together, right?
Dean pauses in the doorway, staring at Castiel with his mouth slack and an unfathomable look in his eyes. He blinks and says, ‘Wow, uh, sorry, I didn’t know…’ a strange tone to his voice.
‘Hey, he’s with Claire, he’ll be fine.’ After Jack had used his new God status to bring Cas back, he decided he didn’t want that kind of power. And, so, he’d split from Amara, who is now the new hands-off (pinkie-swear-Scouts’-honour) God. Dean is weirdly okay about it, all things considered. After that, Claire had swung by to make sure everyone was, you know, alive—apparently Dean’s quick call to say they made it out mostly unscathed didn’t cut it—and decided she and Jack needed some sibling bonding time.
Dean would have died for him.
‘But—’
‘All right,’ Cas says carefully. Neither of them moves, for a moment, until Cas adds, ‘Should I just…kiss you?’
‘Jesus Christ, Cas.’ Dean runs a hand over his face. ‘I held your hand!’
‘What?’
(which is my main and vaguely multi-fandom)
‘Hm?’
‘Hey,’ Dean says, ‘this isn’t
And Castiel can’t deny Dean anything, so he says, ‘Yes, I think so,’ stomach twisting at the shattered look in Dean’s eyes.
else—is in the room with him. And his gun is in pieces. Great.
In the privacy of his own mind, Dean can almost admit that he’s possibly, maybe, on occasion thought about kissing Cas. It’s not like Cas is unkissable. Dean’s got eyes. But Cas is his friend. His best friend. He doesn’t want to ruin that with kisses and feelings and—
The kid’s face falls a little and his hand drops to his side. ‘It’s me.’
‘OK.’ There’s a pause, and then Dean says, ‘But you know you can talk to me. About anything.’
‘Yeah, well,’ Dean says, heart thudding, ‘so are you,’ and he pulls Cas into another kiss. It’s easier, with the air cleared between them, to fall into this. To relish the weight of Cas above him, the strength of him. To ignore the doubt niggling away and let himself touch and feel. He still can’t believe that this is happening, that something he’s wanted so long could be his.
‘I’d like that, too.’
They stay as they are, caught in a stare, until Cas says, ‘I’ll go now,’ and then he’s gone.
‘Yes!’
‘Don’t tell me everyone we know is gonna jump out and yell at me, or something.’
Silence rises up, filling Dean’s lungs like the steam from the water. ‘Nothing’s wrong, I just…’ He sucks in a shuddering breath and finally looks up. The concern in Cas’s gaze hits him hard, and irritation flickers in his chest. If Cas is so damn worried, maybe he shouldn’t flit off all the time. ‘Nothing’s wrong,’ Dean says, squaring his jaw.
‘I’d like that.’
‘I only said that to get you away from the kitchen.’
So, now, Dean is sitting by his desk, staking out the stretch of hallway between the bathroom and Cas’s room. The door is only open a crack, so Cas doesn’t see the light spilling out and get spooked, which means Dean’s relying on the sounds in the bunker more than anything.
Castiel studies the shape of Dean’s back, the crest of his shoulder, the blanket pulled tight around it. His palms itch, so he balls his hands into fists until his nails dig into his palms. ‘Good night, Dean,’ he says, and rolls onto his side.
And as the movie goes on, he gets strangely into it. The tale of family and revenge draw him in and, heck, the music is kind of catchy, even if it is disco. When he actually lets out a cheer, at one point, he looks over to Cas, expecting at least an amused smile, if not a smug one.
‘Yeah, course.’ The words come out too light, too offhand. Dean swallows. He’s backed all the way against his desk and Cas still hasn’t moved from the pool of light in the hallway. ‘Just wanted to talk.’ He tries a smile. ‘It’s been a while.’
. Like…together? There’s
‘I might be having too good a time.’
Castiel stands at the open window, relishing the warm breeze on his face and breathing in deep the scent of jasmine and honeysuckle. He smiles. A bedroom with a window, in a house that’s above ground.
‘But what?’
The hope that had kindled in Castiel’s chest bursts into flames. It races through his body, filling him from head to toe and wing to wing. It’s incredible. His heart sings, and his wings flare out.
‘Yes, I’ve been eating.’
‘Were you?’ Cas levels him with this intense look that makes Dean have to fight the urge to squirm and leaves him breathless.
Dean’s jaw snaps shut. ‘Didn’t think you’d mind,’ he says, after a few moments.
‘Yeah,’ Dean says, ‘no curse, just nerves.’
‘Huh?’
‘You’re lit from within. Full of gold and warmth and
‘Shut up,’ Dean says and storms off.
There’s something like disappointment in Cas’s voice, but confusion too. Dean doesn’t blame him. He turns his face, cheek pressed to the warmth of Cas’s back. ‘I’m so tired, man.’
Light spills out from where his bedroom door is cracked open; he pushes it open fully and steps inside.
It takes a moment for Dean to react, but then he’s crossing the distance between them, wrapping her in a big hug. ‘Hey, kiddo,’ he says. ‘Good to see you.’
‘That makes no sense. If you’re tired, you should sleep.’
, and he’d wonder if Cas were using his mojo, but he knows it’s just Cas. He always has this effect on Dean. But, now, there is a promise in the touch, a mutual knowing amplifying the feelings a million times. Turning it way past eleven. All it’s going to take is for one of them to—
(Someone who could love him?)
Without looking up, Dean says, ‘Hey, move it, your Sasquatch shadow is blocking our light.’
Discomfort pulls at him as he stretches his wings, his room at the bunker barely wide enough for them to fit. He only manifests them in private, though it’s painful to put them away. He doesn’t want anyone else to see them, not like this. Though he would choose complete humanity if it meant the choice between being on earth with Dean, or not being with him, to see his wings so…tattered. It still shames him.
‘Private how?’
‘OK, cool. But, for the record, I don’t mind if people think we
‘Hm?’
‘No.’
‘Good.’
Cas rolls his eyes. ‘Then happy day after your birthday.’ He chews on his lip, head tilted. ‘Did you have a good day?’
Dean gropes for the lamp, blinking against the light as he pushes himself up. The bottle of whisky in the top drawer of the nightstand is empty. He groans.
That the way he feels about Cas isn’t really anything like he feels for Sam doesn’t register. Sam is the kid he raised, too, of course it doesn’t feel the same.
Dean sucks in a breath and lets everything out in a rush: ‘Sometimes I feel like there isn’t a word to describe what you are to me.’ He glances at Cas, who has his mouth hanging open.
When Dean feels his eyes prickle, he finally starts tearing into the wrapping. It takes a little force to get it open, but he manages it, the crinkled plaid paper making way to reveal a tooled leather wallet. Dean turns it over in his hands, running his fingers along the grooves and the raised lines that form a cowboy riding a bronco, arm raised, hat in hand.
of it.’
Cas has materialised, standing between Dean and the kid, angling himself like a shield. For a moment, Jack’s face lights up, but it soon falls again. Probably something to do with the murderous look Cas is fixing on him.
They come to a clearing, which opens onto an expansive lake. Despite the dark clouds above, the still surface of the water glitters. It’s beautiful.
enough—so Castiel grabs Dean’s ass again, pulling their hips flush together. A low moan escapes him, and he rolls his hips up as Dean rolls his down. All he can think is he wants to be close to Dean, closer and closer, but he doesn’t know how. Or, he does, but he doesn’t know if Dean would want…
, you’re the best person I know.’
‘You hit your foot on the fireplace?’
But honestly? It doesn’t matter.
‘Yeah’—Dean smiles and pulls Cas even closer—‘I did.’
‘I do.’ Dean sighs, rolling back onto his side to face Castiel but not quite looking at him. ‘I don’t have much experience with…this.’
‘OK.’ Cas’s hand drops to his shoulder, trails down his arm until his fingers brush the back of Dean’s hand. His index finger sweeps over Dean’s skin a few times, before hooking around Dean’s thumb.
‘Yeah,’ Dean says, breathless, ‘are you?’ Because Cas might be all confidence right now, but as far as Dean knows, he’s not that experienced. And there’s something in his voice—the catch of his breath, the softness of his tone—belying the assurance of his actions.
Dean grunts.
Dean they’re so much more intense. He narrows his eyes. ‘How long do we have the cabin for?’
‘OK.’
Dean is cleaning his gun, all the parts laid out on the desk of their latest fleabag motel, when there is a shift in the air. He knows without looking that someone else—
‘Thanks, Mr Spock,’ Dean says, lips quirking at the way Cas’s eyes narrow in his direction. He doesn’t say anything else, just watches Cas eat as Cas watches him, music softly crackling through the radio. When they’re done, Dean takes Cas’s plate and says, ‘I’ll put these in the kitchen and then get cleaned up.’
‘I meant it, though,’ Cas says.
‘We would what?’
Cas is sitting on his bed, arms folded over his stomach. He glances at Dean, then away. ‘Hello.’
. Even in his most secret fantasies—the weird, the wild, the embarrassingly tender—he never thought about Cas giving him a bath.
It’s not quite the way it’s always been—they’re still skirting something important, Castiel can feel it—but he lets himself believe it’s just like the old days. Two friends sharing a meal and conversation. Something Castiel has always cherished.
memory: Cas’s determined stare and how Dean could tell Cas knew he would give in. Then he remembers Cas’s hands on him, Cas’s long fingers and gentle palms rubbing the lotion into Dean’s arms, over his chest through the opening in his shirt. Cas kneeling as he worked it into Dean’s calves, the tips of Cas’s fingers dancing beneath the hems of Dean’s pineapple print shorts, teasing up his thighs.
When he can’t
Dean pulls back, something nervous but excited beneath his grin, and reaches over to the nightstand, fumbling until he retrieves a bottle.
‘And you’re beautiful.’
‘Yeah.’ Dean turns back and lifts his shoulders. ‘Figured you knew. Wasn’t trying to lure you out here under false pretences or anything.’
Dean blinks, lips parting before he catches himself. ‘Yeah, okay,’ he says, nodding once and turning to grab something. He shoves potatoes and a peeler at Castiel and says, ‘Get peeling, and when you’re done, chop ‘em,’ pushing him toward the cutting board set up on the kitchenette’s counter.
‘Do what?’
I probably didn’t need to split this up, but I’ve been feeling  super overwhelmed about everything lately and it was just easier for me to handle this way! (Plus, I’m impatient and wanted to start posting as I’ve been working on this for a few months, now)
Cas looks away. ‘It was wrong of me to avoid you. I just…couldn’t face you.’
‘Yes!’ Cas’s hands trail down Dean’s forearms, fingers encircling his wrists. He pulls Dean’s hands to his chest. ‘I’m happy to be with you in whatever way you want. If that doesn’t involve sex now, or ever, I’ll be content with that.’
‘Sure, why not? We can make up for lost time.’
.’ Castiel sighs and runs a hand over Dean’s face. ‘Or if it’s that important, I’ll do it. You know I don’t need to sleep.’ Sometimes he likes the ritual of resting with Dean and being close to him, but if it will keep Dean in bed where he can rest, Castiel will rearrange the whole room.
When they part, Dean says, ‘Cas, I… You know that no matter what I call you, that I…’ He sucks in a breath. ‘That I love you. Right?’
Castiel places his hand on Dean’s deltoid, uncertain he’ll be able to find the exact same spot, but it’s like a lock sliding into place. ‘Oh.’
‘Soaking it in cold water before the stain sets. Works on blood, figured it’ll work on wine?’
Their hands brush as Dean takes them and says, ‘Thanks,’ and then starts unbuttoning his shirt.
‘Not you.’ Dean waggles the phone, then turns away. He can still feel Cas’s gaze on him, tingling up his spine. ‘I’m busy, gotta go,’ he says, into the phone.
A beat and then, ‘Did something happen on the hunt?’
Caught between the urge to retreat and give Cas space, or step forward and touch him, Dean ends up shuffling back, awkwardly cocking a hip against his desk. ‘Hey, uh, come in for a minute.’
‘Hey, hey, I was kidding.’ Relief floods Dean. The thought of some huge surprise party was, honestly, something he wasn’t keen on. ‘You were right. Small is good. Whatever you guys have planned, it’s going to be awesome, OK?’
‘That’s not true.’
‘Kissing first, then present.’ Dean’s lips skate down Cas’s neck, earning him a hitched breath and a shiver. ‘Wait, no, coffee first, then kissing, then presents.’ He starts to push himself up, the need for caffeine
Castiel nods, words stuck in his throat.
‘It’s fine,’ Dean says, tightly. He drinks more wine and adds, softer this time, ‘You did a good job with the bandaging.’
‘Don’t blame her.’ Dean bites his lip, still feeling a little dazed. It clears, though, and Cas’s words sink in. ‘Wait, but I thought… You said you needed pointers?’
The roll of Dean’s hips falters, and he squirms under Castiel. ’Shut up.’
‘Yeah, exactly,
‘I haven’t been—’
‘I want…’
Castiel sighs. There are a lot of things he could talk about to Dean—anything and nothing—but Dean hasn’t brought up the one thing Castiel is desperate to talk about. And Castiel doesn’t think it would be fair to bring it up himself. He’s already put so much on Dean, so he only says, ‘I know.’
‘Good night, Dean.’
Dean cuts the engine, and Castiel gets out of the car, stretching his stiff limbs. He sucks in lungfuls of clean country air, crisp with the scent of foliage, and looks around. The trees surrounding the cabin are tall and beautiful and old, their age resonating in the air. It’s a faint hum at the back of Castiel’s mind, calling to him. He’s human, now, but there’s still a spark of something within him that lets him pick up on those things. He’s not sure if it makes the transition from divinity to humanity any easier.
Dean almost chokes. His brain hisses static. ‘What?’
Mercifully, Dean doesn’t ask how Castiel usually manages them because he doesn’t want to talk about how useless he is without his grace any further.
joking about the curse?’
Dean scratches his head. Heck, Cas could just be rearranging his furniture or something. Screw it. ‘Cas, you OK in there?’ Dean asks as he knocks.
‘Because I know you, Cas, and I know you’re bullshitting. But if you don’t want to to talk to me…’ An agonising silence stretches out, Cas not looking at Dean, until Dean says, ‘You know what, I’ll just let you
—‘why were you avoiding me when you got back?’ Dean squares his jaw. ‘I thought you would… We would…’
Dean nods and finally pulls out of the parking lot.
A few moments of silence pass; Dean considers getting up to get a drink after all, or maybe get some coffee or grab a book. Do
Cas turns to Dean, brows raised. They say something like
‘You can start with what’s wrong.’
Dean lets his head fall back to the pillow, letting out a put-upon sigh, and says, ‘You’re a stubborn bastard, you know that,’ even as he wraps his arms around Castiel’s waist.
There’s stunned silence for a moment before Cas says, ‘Now who knows how to “make a guy feel special”?’
‘And for now, we have the whole night alone.’
And, yeah, okay, that’s fair. Dean got to hear Cas pour his heart out, so now it’s his turn, right? Heck, he was
Dean looks at Cas and sees in him all those things he’s never done. Not like they would be with Cas.
Castiel wakes to a warm embrace and soft green eyes watching him across the divide of a shared pillow.
Dean tugs again, unclasping his hand from the jacket and sliding it around Cas’s waist. Pulling their bodies flush together, still only half an embrace because Dean’s other hand is twisted in Cas’s sweatshirt.
‘Go to sleep.’
The sheets are tangled around Dean’s legs, twisted and stifling; he rolls onto his back, kicking them away. Then he turns onto his side, punching his pillow, and pulling the covers back up to his hips. The clock reads 2 am. He hasn’t had a minute of shut-eye.
‘Yeah, I— I mean…I didn’t not…’ Dean clears his throat. He sits on the edge of the bed then tugs on Cas’s ankle, which earns him a glare. Dean rolls his eyes and pats the bed next to him; when Cas shuffles around so he’s sitting by Dean, Dean adds, ‘A guy might get the wrong idea is all.’
‘You know, an anniversary is technically a year, hence “anni-”. Maybe semi-versary…’
him. It still makes Dean squirm, but it’s not terrifying anymore.
Cas looks over at him, all insolence in those baby blues, and says, ‘I believe the appropriate expression here is “takes one to know one”,’ with a sardonic lift of one brow.
‘Am I OK?’ Dean resists the urge to lean into Cas’s touch and, instead, bats his hands away. ‘Are you kidding me?’
Cas turns away, rubbing his face, whether to chase away the ghost of Dean’s touch, or a futile attempt to erase the dark circle, Dean doesn’t know. ‘Thank you,’ Cas deadpans.
Hope always bites Dean in the ass, so he should’ve seen this coming when Cas comes back to them. (To him.)
‘But you were watching me sleep.’
Dean grabs his hand before Cas drops it, squeezing gently. He shakes his head and squeezes his eyes shut. Maybe if he’s not looking at Cas, he can explain. The moments pass and Cas waits for him, patient and kind, and Dean finally manages to say, ‘I didn’t think I’d have this.’
‘…drowning…’
. That’s what you do when you—’ Dean swallows, a muscle in his jaw ticking. ‘It’s what you do for family.’
But there is the Mark. And if there wasn’t, there’d be something. There’s always something.
to tell Cas the things he’s been holding back for so long. Dean had barely had time to breathe between defeating Chuck and feeling like he was drowning on dry land before Jack brought Cas back and then Dean was buoyed by a feeling he’s never felt before. The feeling that something he wants so much it hurts is within his grasp. Right there, waiting for him to reach out and take it.
‘It is, and so are you,’ Castiel says, then leans in to swallow the inevitable protest from Dean with a deep kiss.
want to do this?’
Dean gives a quick nod, chews his lip. He seems to steel himself, but then the distant rumble of thunder rises to a crescendo.
‘Well, I want to do what you want to do.’
‘Better, huh?’
‘Hey!’ Dean pokes his finger into Cas’s ribs and glances up at him. ‘You’re human now, too, you know.’ A moment later, he regrets his words, but if the reminder stings Cas, he doesn’t show it. And it was Cas’s choice, after all.
‘Turn the movie off.’
The bed is a double, large enough for the breadth and length of their bodies, small enough that Castiel can feel heat crawling through the crisp cotton sheets from Dean and into him. He sucks in a deep breath, tries to ignore it, and how he can feel every movement Dean makes, and pulls the scratchy plaid blanket up to his chest.
‘It’s OK,’ Cas says, and Dean wonders if he knows what Dean wants to say. Cas hesitates a moment, then takes a step back. But Dean stops him leaving again, tugging on his sweatshirt until they’re toe to toe. ‘Dean?’
‘Why?’
‘Yeah. He’s been bugging me for days to man up and tell you, figured I’d save myself another lecture, so I text him after…you know.’ Dean huffs. ‘Well, not right after. But, yeah, Sam knows.’
‘I know,’ Cas says, ‘and he’s been texting me every day. Many times.’ He looks lighter for a moment, as he shares a fond look with Dean.
like the glint in that waitress’s eye when she’d asked Cas out.
‘Seriously?’
Dean’s lips quirk, and he ducks his head. It’s more shy than coy, and it makes Castiel feel tender and warm. He holds out a hand, beckoning Dean, who gives him a sideways look but rests his own hand in Castiel’s, palm to palm. And, when Castiel pulls, Dean comes to him, melting into his embrace and wrapping his arms around him.
‘What? No!’ Dean’s hand moves back to the nape of Castiel’s neck, fingers curling, pulling until Castiel has no choice but to turn to face Dean. ‘Hey, look at me,’ Dean says, when Castiel can’t meet his gaze.
Cas is struggling with a crumbling wall and Dean says, ‘The defences could use some work,’ just to mess with him.
They move together, Dean rolling his hips up, matching each of Castiel’s thrusts; Dean’s head falls back against the pillow, exposing the long line of his neck.
But Cas jerks back, out of Dean’s grasp. ‘Why did you do that?’
; Cas kisses like a starving man, and Dean knows he wants this just as much as he does. Dean presses his lips to the hinge of Cas’s jaw, then trails his mouth down his gorgeous neck, stopping to suck a kiss to the hollow of his throat. It’s even better than he’d imagined it would be, and Cas makes these sexy little noises that shoot right through Dean.
‘You didn’t lose me, Dean. I’m right here.’
It’s been a long day, settling into the new house. It’s old, and it needs work, but it’s big. Big enough for the five of them—Sam, Eileen, Jack, Castiel and Dean—with room to spare for their friends (family) to come stay if they want. (Though not all at once.) And it’s close enough to the bunker that they can commute easily when they need to (Dean refuses to use the word ‘commute’).
‘Are— Are you okay?’
‘I think I’ve thought of one.’
Dean’s first instinct is to attack the thing that just created a mini-earthquake in their motel room. But the kid looks
It’s the perfect opportunity for Castiel to ask what will happen between them when they return, but he wants the spell of the cabin to last a little longer.
‘Right. Yeah.’ About a hundred different feelings crowd in Dean’s chest, almost all of them positive for a change, and he makes a decision. It’s stupid to pretend he doesn’t want this, especially knowing Cas wants it too. He pushes at Cas and sits up, bending to unlace his boots.
‘Better?’ Dean asks, voice coming out a little rough. He’s drifted closer to Cas without realising, but that’s nothing new. He clears his throat.
Castiel watches for a moment, then drags himself out of bed and dresses before following Dean downstairs.
‘I don’t…’ Castiel looks at Dean, and he sees the weight of words unspoken for too many years settling in again. Old wounds are slow to heal. He doesn’t want to be the one to open them again. So, he says, ‘What happens when we get back to the bunker?’
Great. Cas would choose now to be oblivious. ‘Since I’ve…had sex.’ Dean wriggles his fingers with a wink. ‘Unless you count my right hand.’
Dean swallows; he’s close enough that Castiel can hear it, can hear the click of his throat and the wet intake of his breath. ‘For a lot of things.’
‘I prefer your thing.’
‘What?’
‘I’m fine.’
The air feels charged, as it always does between them, but then Cas steps back and says, ‘I’ll check the temperature. Of the bath,’ and there might be a faint hint of a blush colouring his cheeks.
‘Who just… Who just kisses someone like that?’
Something’s wrong. Dean turns, whip-fast, pushing himself to his feet. He only gets a glimpse at Jack—all sad eyebrows and glassy eyes—before Jack flings himself at him. Arms so tight around Dean’s neck he can barely breathe.
A new flush comes into Dean’s cheeks, and it takes him a few moments to say, ‘Love you, too.’ He clears his throat, squirming a little, but he’s still smiling as he turns to Castiel and adds, ‘So, what do you want for breakfast?’
There’s a breeze blowing down the bay and the tang of salt in the air and it’s, well, peaceful. As peaceful as Dean has ever known. Dean waits for the restlessness to come, but there’s nothing there. Maybe the waves have washed it away. The heat of the sun is starting to turn from pleasant to biting, though, and Dean considers retreating to the giant beach umbrella they’d set up earlier.
‘Yeah,’ Dean says, and, ‘thanks.’ He looks at Castiel, gaze all soft, and shakes his head. ‘Shouldn’t waste your mojo on that, though.’ It’s an old argument, and any heat is gone from it, now, just part of their routine.
Cas frowns, wiping at his chin with the sleeve of his pyjamas, but missing.
Dean lets out a soft breath. ‘That should make this easier…’
every day.’
Everything. That’s all Dean can think. He looks like everything.
‘Yes, Dean, I’m sure.’ Cas squares his jaw. ‘Is this what you wanted to talk about?’
The room comes into sharp focus, Dean’s heart beating rabbit fast against his ribs. Remnants of sleep fall away. Because Cas is holding the jacket Dean was wearing when—
There’s something special in being seen by Cas. In being loved by him. Dean’s holding on tight to it, holding on tight to Cas.
Dean gives him a shrewd look. ‘You’ve been squirrelly since we got out of bed.’
‘Yeah, yeah, I know I ain’t the best at this,’ Dean says, answering Cas’s unasked question, ‘but if it’ll help. You know, ease your troubled mind, or something.’
‘This helps,’ Dean says, flushing at the slur to his voice. He sounds blissed out, just from Cas giving him a back rub. Over his shirt. He clears his throat and adds, ‘But you can still play my nurse if you want, next time I get banged up.’
‘Whatever you want.’ Dean settles into the other recliner and passes the remote over.
‘Yeah,’ Dean says, but he still doesn’t take the shirt. Instead, he curls his fingers around Cas’s wrist, swiping his thumb over Cas’s pulse. The quiet of the room is suffocating around them. Cas’s gaze is on him, heavy and questioning, but Dean doesn’t have an answer for it. Not with words. They’re tucked away too well, deep in his throat. Maybe he can just show Cas. He’s better at that.
‘I’m just…so fucking tired.’
to a few days ago, in a way he’s never ever wanted to before. But he thought it would be easier. Why does everything have to be so damn complicated with them? He scrubs a hand through his hair and looks at Cas, who is just standing there, waiting, like he always does.
‘I… Does the offer still stand?’
After talking to Cas, his mind has been racing with everything that might be wrong between them, now, all the what-ifs chasing each other. The worse is what if Cas regrets…
There’s a playful glint in Cas’s eyes now, as he says, ‘I don’t know how I couldn’t.’
‘Um—’ The woman Dean had given a look earlier is doing a poor job of pretending she’s not trying to listen in on them like they’re here for her entertainment. It pisses Dean off. Sure, maybe she’s not thinking anything
‘It does, but I don’t regret it.’ A beat and then: ‘
‘No,’ Cas says, ‘I’m not hungry, let’s go home,’ and then he gets in the car.
And if Sam had to convince Dean no less than four times not to go to the restaurant where Cas was having his date to check how it was going, well, again, he was concerned. In a friendly way. Purely platonic. What else would there be?
Dean snorts.
Dean frowns. ‘This is real funny, huh?’
‘OK.’ Dean tries to believe it, but he’s gone tense and Cas must feel it because his hands pause, uncertain, at the small of Dean’s back.
His feet sink into Cas’s mattress as he reaches up to untack the string of Christmas lights they’d put up the other night. He’s only halfway through when the door creaks open and Cas says, ‘What are you doing?’
‘You don’t need to be fixed, OK? There’s nothing broken about you.’
in Western movies ;D (and I know there are Bollywood movies without songs, too!) Secondly,
There’s a puff of air across the back of Dean’s neck as Cas lets out an indignant huff, but he slides an arm around Dean’s waist, pulling him flush to his chest.
‘Of course. That’s why you were sitting in the dark, covered in blood and viscera, instead of showering.’
‘Good timing,’ Dean says.
‘So, come on, spill the details’—Dean leans his elbows on the kitchen counter, pushing down the gnawing in his stomach—’then we can give you some pointers about where you went wrong.’
‘Cool.’
‘I—’ Dean throws his hands up. ‘Well, I don’t know!’
friends.
going there. And, yet, Dean still says, ‘If you want some.’ He coughs. ‘Tips that is.’
hurt.’ His fingers graze Dean’s ribs, so so gentle despite the accusing tone of his voice.
Cas huffs, leaning up and over Dean. ‘Show me what to do.’
There are streamers everywhere and a mix of themed decorations: cowboys and Scooby-Doo and, inexplicably, dinosaurs. A sheen of glitter coats everything, and Dean remembers a few nights ago when Cas came to bed covered in glitter. It looks, well, like a kid’s party.
There’s nothing to cloud his mind. No end of the world to worry about.
‘If he’s Lucifer’s son, he must be destroyed,’ Cas says. ‘A regular Nephilim would be powerful enough but Lucifer’s son would have powers untold.’
Cas pushes into Dean’s touch as his thumbs reach the small of his back. ‘Hm?’
normal.
‘I’m sorry,’ Dean says.
Sleep tugs at Dean, but he resists its pull. Wriggles around, digs his fingernails into his palm. He doesn’t want to miss any of this.
Cas, because it’s wrong. They’ll find a new normal, or make their way back to their old one.
‘Dean?’
‘Yes?’
‘No.’
Dean doesn’t pretend there isn’t a ‘but’. He lifts his shoulders and says, ‘I don’t know. Would’ve been nice to have some more time alone, too.’
‘You are,’ Cas says, ‘so very beautiful.’
Dean runs a hand over his face. ‘Yeah, see, this is the kind of thing you tell me about.’
‘Really?’
Pleasure bolts through him at the touch of Cas’s hand and the way their cocks slide together. He wraps his hand around Cas’s, showing Cas how he likes it. His other hand is fisted in Cas’s hair, tilting his head back so they can kiss as they rock against each other. It’s so fucking good.
I’m still finding my footing with writing this ship and I’m still only up to S9 on my re-watch so it’s messing with my head a little writing them at this point but, uh, yeah…IDK where I’m going with this XD
and almost trips down the stairs in his haste. He takes them three at a time, spilling into the main room of the cabin, all senses on high alert.
They pick up the last few things they need and head to the checkout. They’re in line, waiting behind a large family with an overflowing cart, and an old man with a jar of pickles and a bottle of tabasco sauce, when Cas says, ‘
‘Yes,’ Cas says, ‘I think so,’ but there’s still something guarded in his voice. Still something he’s holding back.
Cas’s eyes drift closed, and he tips his head back. It exposes the long line of his neck, and Dean aches with how much he wants to put his mouth there. Starting at the edge of his jaw and moving down to the hollow at the base of his throat, and not stopping.
Dean draws in a shuddering breath and says, ‘Yeah.’
Dean doesn’t answer right away. He can’t. The words cut deep, ricochet in his brain. Is it that easy, to stop carrying his regrets? Probably not, but he has to start somewhere, so he says, ‘Yeah, I guess I don’t, either,’ and even though he knows saying that won’t fix everything right away, he does feel lighter. He finds himself smiling and Cas smiles back.
But tonight he pretends he can have this, and he drives.
Castiel descends the stairs and moves over to Dean. There’s a strange feeling in the pit of his stomach that wants to climb up, up, up, and choke him. ‘Dean,’ he starts, at the same time Dean says, ‘Look, if there’s a problem, I can take the couch.’
‘I thought you’d be hungry,’ Cas says, taking a bite of his own sandwich, ‘it’s getting late.’
‘My date said that, too.’
Dean searches Castiel’s face, and he shakes his head. ‘I don’t think you do.’ He sits back, hand falling from Castiel, and runs a hand through his hair.
‘I—’ Cas frowns, but it soon gives way to a small, sheepish smile. ‘Sorry. I wanted to make sure I was awake before you. But you know how I am in the mornings, so I had…several cups of coffee.’
It’s fucking intoxicating, and Dean wants
The noise Sam makes, then—somewhere between a whimper and a choked cough—would, under other circumstances, either fill Dean with concern or glee. But, right now, he’s still stuck on his future self having a
Castiel knows it. But he gives Dean a questioning squint.
‘Yeah, looks like we’ll have a full house again, in the morning,’ Dean says. He thumbs quick responses back to Sam and Jack, then shows Cas the texts saying they’ll both be home in the morning and that Eileen and Claire are coming with them respectively.
They collect more shells and seaweed and then take them back to Jack to trim the castle. (Dean reapplies sunscreen under Cas’s watchful eye). Jack has just proudly stuck a twig with a piece of seaweed tied onto it in one of the turrets when a shadow falls over them.
‘Are you all right?’ Castiel strides forward, barely thinking to check for any danger lurking. Things have been quiet on the supernatural front since they defeated Chuck, but it’s likely still reckless not to check. He doesn’t care.
‘I’m glad.’
Dean’s brows raise and his eyes widen and his lips part. He looks truly awed. ‘Uh… Your wings—’
‘Your soul. Calling to me.’
Dean gulps down the last of his beer around a grin. He’s trying not to look
‘Let me,’ Castiel says, tugging Dean closer, ‘as an anniversary gift.’
‘Oh.’ Cas is standing there in a pair of black sweats and a worn-out faded t-shirt, hands hanging limply by his sides. A ripple of affection runs through Dean when he realises it’s one of his old t-shirts. ‘Do you need them?’ Cas asks.
‘Yes.’ Cas’s lips twitch. ‘But I like being your t’hy’la.’
Cas shifts. ‘I had a little trouble wrapping them.’
Jack smiles and goes over to the counter then comes back with a small present, wrapped about as well as the ones Cas gave Dean.
The sink is cool beneath his palms and he runs the water, splashing his face. When he straightens up, it’s to see Cas in the mirror behind him. ‘I know we’re sharing pretty much everything, these days, but bathroom time’s still sacred.’
The blue sheet billows up between them as they lift it and then settles on the bed. Castiel pulls it tight and tucks the corner in, but it still ends up lumpy. He can’t figure out how Dean does it so perfectly. Dean has even shown him, more than once, and he can’t get the knack of it. He files it away as one of life’s mysteries and stuffs a pillow into a plaid pillowcase, then fluffs it up and sets it on the bed.
‘Bricks are digging into my back,’ Dean says, pushing himself away from the fireplace, further into Castiel’s arms.
‘No problem.’
Dean smiles again, tongue between his teeth. All flirtation and barely concealed lust. ‘Fast mover, huh?’
Dean edges the door open, poking his head around. But Cas is only kneeling at the foot of his bed, wearing a tracksuit Dean is sure he hasn’t seen before. His face is flushed and his brows are furrowed, his mouth a thin line. He looks…disgruntled. Dean crosses his arms, propping his hip against the door frame. ‘You lose something down there?’
But Cas says, ‘I won’t,’ his hands fitted to Dean’s shoulder blades, ‘I won’t,’ and Dean believes him.
‘Yeah, but it’s more than that, right?’ Dean leans forward, arms braced on the table. His robe dips into what’s left of his eggs, so he shoves the plate aside.
Dean may as well be naked already for all that look burns through him. And, yeah, maybe he should have thought this through, should have quashed that small, childish part of him with its stupid
Neither of them moves toward the door, instead falling into each other again.

‘I know you don’t like cuddling but—’
. Castiel isn’t even sure which Dean is asking of him, but he doesn’t need to know. His answer is the same, regardless.
at him.
, an unhelpful voice supplies. Dean ignores it. This dweeby, totally sweet, normal-looking kid is a half-angel-half-human baby monster. ‘OK, kid,’ Dean says, ‘if you’re from the future, tell us something that hasn’t happened, yet.’
‘Yes,’ Jack says. ‘But, um…’
‘Cool.’
‘I would never think your pretences were false, Dean.’
‘Are you serious? I did this’—Dean waves his arm—‘because I love you too, dumbass!’
‘About what?’
‘I mean it.’
if you’re into reblogging those things :)  (this isn’t the same post from the first chapter, I made a new one for this chapter :))
‘I assumed we would have sex more than once, and figure things out as we go if it’s needed.’
‘Yeah, I’m good.’ Dean takes another swig of wine, swiping his tongue over his lips, then reaches out. His hand hovers awkwardly for a moment before it lands on Castiel’s. Hot and clammy and electric.
Dean huffs and shakes his head. ‘You sure know how to make a guy feel special,’ he says, but the tightness in his chest eases, and he manoeuvres the cart around Cas.
Castiel finds Dean about an hour after he went looking for him. He’d wanted to tell Dean about a plant sale nearby, looking for him first in their room, and then the garage and the kitchen. He started to grow concerned when he asked Sam, Eileen and Jack if they’d seen Dean at all, and none of them had. None of them noticed him leave, either.
Castiel sighs.
‘Hm?’
‘So, you’re sulking,’ Dean says.
‘Lucifer.’
‘Oh,’ Cas says, and
‘At all,’ Cas admits, ‘since I…’ He sighs, cheeks a little flushed, as though sleepless nights are anything to be embarrassed about.
‘Don’t… Don’t do your self-sacrificing thing—’
Dean’s phone buzzes. It startles them, breaking the moment. Dean curses and picks the phone up. It’s a text from Sam. Damn it, even when he’s not here, he’s interrupting them. Dean thumbs a quick reply and pockets the phone. ‘It was just Sam.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas rolls his eyes. ‘Dean, I meant—’
‘Which song?’
Dean runs a hand over his face. This is ridiculous. Cas is probably still off-kilter from being in The Empty and coming back human. It’s not about Dean. He moves over to Cas, mentally sorting through everything he wants to say, hoping he’ll figure out where to start in the next few steps. But he stops short when Cas turns his face toward the light. It’s the first proper look Dean’s had at him in days and Cas looks…rough. All wan complexion and dark circles and more stubble than usual.
‘Dean.’ Cas rests a hand on Dean’s knee, turning so he’s facing Dean. ‘I don’t feel like any time we’ve spent together has been wasted. Do you?’
—but he’s still shaking. A sour taste sits at the back of his throat and he struggles to swallow it down. It was only a dream. That’s all. He glances sidelong at Cas, who has pushed himself up on one elbow, and is squinting up at Dean, all sleep-rumpled and beautiful and
Cas huffs. ‘I don’t see why not.’
This time, Dean’s stomach is the one to rumble, the traitor, and he pulls away slowly. He lets himself relish the moment before he steps back and says, ‘OK, dinner time,’ and gestures for Cas to follow him.
‘Dean, what’s wrong?’
‘Here,’ he says, handing the clothes to Dean.
When he scrapes his teeth over Cas’s pulse, Cas says, ’Dean,’ completely wrecked. The hand he has fisted in Dean’s hair tightens, and he moves the other one from where it was curled over the rim of the tub to cup Dean’s jaw. He pulls Dean into another kiss, hands trailing down Dean’s neck, his chest, to curl possessively over his hips.
Cas hesitates a moment, then sits beside him, but Dean doesn’t miss the inches he leaves between them. Dean curses himself and shifts closer until their thighs are touching. Warmth bleeds through the thin cotton of his pyjama pants and he melts a little, leaning into Cas’s side.
And when Cas says, ‘Lean forward,’ quiet and commanding, Dean does it without protest.
‘What’s wrong?’ Castiel asks.
Sam’s eyes bug out of his head; Cas merely blinks. Dean counts that as a win and goes to the fridge to grab himself a victory beer, and when he turns around, Cas is
Dean’s barely glanced at the handprint on his shoulder since that first day. Gaze sliding over it when he undresses or showers.
Because Dean might be exhausted and wrung out, but he’s also more turned on than he has been in a long time. Every now and then the cloth slips, and Cas’s thumb or the tips of his fingers brush Dean’s bare skin, and Dean has to bite his lip against the pathetic little noises trying to escape him. He wonders if Cas knows what this is doing to him and how he’d feel about it if he did know.
‘The hell I don’t!’
There’s a ringing sound somewhere. At first, Dean thinks it’s a phone, then he realises it’s in his ears. He opens and closes his mouth. ‘What?’
Despite his mood and the tense atmosphere, Castiel can’t help but smile. ‘They’re wings, Dean. No more private than your arms or legs.’ He doesn’t point out that Dean has been an angel’s vessel and has technically had wings himself, but his smile falls thinking about that time all the same.
Brother has been the most important word in Dean’s vocabulary since he was four. There’s no one more important to Dean than Sam, but Cas comes a damn close second. It only makes sense to think of him as a brother.
‘Don’t be a baby.’ Dean snatches the pile of crumpled white cloth out of Cas’s arms. It’s one white dress shirt after another. He looks at them, back up at Cas. ‘These are just like the shirt you already have.’
And that was fine, because for once, Dean
They’re on the edge of something, Dean can feel it. Taste it at the back of his throat. It’s not the first time, not by a long shot, but each time it happens lately, Dean is closer and closer to jumping right off and diving headfirst into whatever comes next. He licks his lips and says, ‘Maybe not,’ and if Cas is surprised he doesn’t show it.
‘Good.’
for him, and Dean let him down.
‘Welcome to the family,’ Dean says. Jack beams. It does something funny to Dean’s chest, the same feeling he used to get when Sammy would look up at him like he was the best thing ever. Shit. This kid is his kid. ‘So, if we’re not your bio dads, we adopt you, or something?’ He doesn’t look at Cas, but he can feel his gaze on him. Because they may not have had a baby, but they’re apparently
‘Yes, very.’ Cas is running his hands up and down Dean’s back, the little sparks left in the wake of his touch almost enough to distract him from his uncertainty. But then Cas says, ‘Are you?’ and Dean’s stomach twists.
Dean blinks and then he laughs. And then he can’t stop. He laughs until his sides ache and Cas is giving him a long-suffering look—lips twitching beneath it—and Jack just looks anxious.
Cas looks down at the shirt he’s wearing and shrugs. ‘I like it fine. And I don’t question your addiction to plaid.’
‘Nothing,’ Cas says, but he looks caught out.
‘And your ankle?’
Dean squares his jaw, but he throws his hands up and says, ‘
‘Like this.’ And Cas leans in again, placing a soft, brief kiss on Dean’s lips.
‘Sure,’ Dean says, ‘unless you wanna watch
Dean snorts. ‘Yeah.’
.’ Dean sighs. ‘Your wings being like this… It just shows how brave you are, OK? How— How willing you are to sacrifice everything for the ones you love. That’s nothing to be ashamed of.’
‘What?’
‘You could’ve told me, you know.’
‘Yes?’
‘Mm?’
‘Just… You’re sure about this?’ Dean draws in a wet breath. ‘I mean, that you want to do this?’
have a crush on anyone, and certainly not on any angel in a rumpled trench coat.
Dean swallows and says, ‘What’s keeping you up?’
Cas blinks.
‘Sure,’ Dean says, ‘I can gank a demon without batting an eye. But I can’t…’
‘Dean.’ Jack’s voice cracks, sounds a little desperate.
‘A bit, yeah,’ Dean says, tension slowly draining from him. ‘But I’ve been a dumbass enough times over the years, so…’ He trails off with a shrug. ‘I mean, I probably should’ve just told you when I got you out, you know? But I wanted it to be perfect and—’
‘No’—Dean clears his throat—‘about what you’re gonna do to me after.’
It’s silly, but the word fits.
Dean pulls back, panting hard, and when Castiel gives him a questioning look, says, ‘Too many clothes,’ tugging at Castiel’s pants.
And, shit, Dean has no idea how he’s meant to resist that. So, he rests his hand in Cas’s and lets Cas draw him to the other side of the bath. Somehow, Cas manages to turn Dean around and settle him between his legs, so Dean’s back is pressed to Cas’s chest. His thick thighs bracket Dean’s, and his arms slip around Dean’s waist, and Dean is encircled by him completely.
They make love that way, face to face, their gazes never wavering. Not for the first time, Castiel loses himself in Dean’s eyes, but now he knows that when Dean looks back at him, it’s with love.
Castiel squints at him.
Cas is looking up at him, eyes glittering and dark. His hands are hot on Dean’s hips.
‘All right.’
‘Dean.’ Cas reaches up, cupping Dean’s face. ‘I want to have sex with you. But whenever you’re ready.’
‘Dean?’ Cas shakes the shirt. ‘Are you going to show me your superior folding skills, or not?’
‘Dean, I can’t fly or heal you if something serious happens and—’
‘No.’ Dean looks up. ‘Why?’
‘Wait here, I’ll be back.’ Dean ignores Cas’s confused squint and heads out the room and down the hall.
‘Oh. Yes.’
‘So, I’m ambitious,’ Dean says.
? Through the tightness in his chest, Dean manages to say, ‘No, it wasn’t Charlie. Just…’ He exhales, slow. ‘Movie hit a bit close to home, you know?’ He glances at Cas sidelong.
‘Haven’t even been awake for five minutes, and you’re already groping me.’ Dean tuts, but his eyes are lit with mirth.
To Dean’s irritation, Sam’s right. Still, he shrugs a shoulder and says, ‘Maybe you’re a bad kisser.’

human, now.
‘Knock yourself out.’ Dean doesn’t have to ask which Charlie Cas means. It’s in the way he says her name. And he doesn’t look at which movie Cas chose, until Cas glances over, catching him staring. Again.
‘I’m not. Being with you is all I want, I don’t care about anything else.’
And the thought of
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Yeah’—Dean smiles, looking at everyone again then back to Cas—‘I am.’
Dean swallows, lets his hands fall to his thighs. Everything drains from him, and he sits a moment before he rests his forehead between Cas’s shoulder blades. There are so many things he wants to say, needs to say, but the weight of them is crushing. He loves Cas so much and he doesn’t know how three, or four words, could show that. So, he says, ‘Yes,’ which isn’t enough either, but it’s all he has in this moment.
Cas lets out a soft grunt, hips rolling up, his free hand sliding to Dean’s backside.
It’s still warm beneath the umbrella’s shade, so Dean reaches into the cooler, fishing around the ice that’s mostly water, and grabbing the last beer. He pops the cap off and hopes Sam remembers to bring more. It goes down bitter and cold and bracing. Dean looks around the beach as he drinks, taking everything in.
‘I don’t know why I need so many clothes,’ Cas says, but lets Dean steer him toward the pants and shoes.
Castiel lets out a gusty sigh and reaches out, curling a hand over Dean’s knee. ‘Dean, I’m sorry. Please tell me what the word means.’
‘Which thing?’
Thanks for reading! :D
Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes and paws through the basket. There are a few t-shirts in the ugliest colours Dean has ever seen and a soft, oversized sweater the same colour as the flannel shirt that had caught Dean’s eye earlier. ‘Fine, whatever,’ he sighs, ‘but at least grab some jeans. And some decent shoes.’
‘Don’t ruin your surprise, Dean.’
‘I don’t— It’s not important.’ It
‘Yeah, I do.’ Dean closes his eyes and grabs Cas’s wrist, leaning into his palm. It’s warm and it grounds him. ‘Just let me say this.’
‘Hello, Dean.’
To his credit, Cas doesn’t ask ‘what’, only holds Dean’s hand tighter. ‘It must be…overwhelming,’ he says.
‘I won’t do it again,’ Jack says. ‘Unless…it’s OK? There are some historical events I wouldn’t mind seeing.’
The betrayal cuts deep. Maybe Dean should have seen it coming. But Cas is a friend. No, more than a friend. He’s

‘Is this okay?’
‘You rushed off so quickly,’ the woman says, ‘so I left it with your husband for safekeeping,’ and Cas nods, thanking her for her kindness and honesty, which she waves off with a pleased smile.
‘That’s real mature, Dean,’ Sam says, ‘why don’t you just pull his pigtails while you’re at it?’
, Cas staying away is for the best.
‘That’s a long time.’
‘Jack’s just glad to be here,’ Dean says, giving Cas a “no idea what’s going on” look.
So, he doesn’t have the picket fence, and he’s raising Lucifer’s kid with his brother and his best friend. And he’s in love with his best friend, and Cas doesn’t love him back.
The reminder, when it comes, is almost a relief. Fists and righteous fury because Dean let Cas down. Cas had faith in him. Cas fought for him, died for him, did it
The green of Dean’s eyes is dark in the low, warm light in the loft; he looks at Castiel for long moments before he sighs and says, ‘Good night, buddy,’ then settles down again.
Irritation flickers in Dean’s chest; he can’t tell if it’s at Cas for being so damn stubborn, or at himself for making Cas feel like he can’t ask for help, or accept it when it’s offered. ‘Yeah, well, you can use these
Dean doesn’t believe in a lot, but he believed in Cas. In his loyalty, his
‘I’m sure Sam and Jack would have liked it out here, too,’ he says. ‘And Eileen. Didn’t they want to come?’
‘Yeah, don’t want the popcorn to burn.’
If Cas notices Dean acting off, he doesn’t say anything, just holds the jeans up, deems them the right size despite Dean’s warnings that he should try them on, and then they head for the checkout.
The tightness in his lungs eases. Cas is with him. ‘I want, I need to tell you…’
‘It’s a Nephilim.’
‘Which one?’
‘I— You…’
And it’s ridiculous because Cas is touching
It should steel Dean, but he feels wrung out, and only says, ‘Doesn’t matter. We should…we should figure out the not sleeping thing.’
, or something less dramatic—but then he says, ‘There’s no point both of us being awake all night,’ and Dean still can’t figure what’s going wrong.
If Dean’s look is anything to go by, he knows Castiel isn’t either, but he doesn’t seem to mind. He grabs the lube, squirting some into his palm, and wraps his hand around Castiel’s cock, pumping it a few times. ‘You good to go?’ he asks.
‘Maverick? Iceman? C’mon!’ Dean groans. ‘Jesus Christ, Cas, do you pay attention to any of the movies I make you watch?’
They’d both know and— And that would be a
Cas curls his hand around Dean’s elbow. ‘If you come, now, I’ll perform any sexual favour you wish.’
Cas steps forward, raising a tentative hand to Dean’s face. He gently brushes his thumb over Dean’s cheek and says, ‘You don’t have to say anything else.’
‘Well, I’m the one who dumped a glass of wine in your lap. It’s the least I can do.’
‘Dean?’
‘Tell me.’ Cas curls his hand around Dean’s wrist. ‘Please.’
They’ve never hugged like this, where Dean has just let himself hold and be held, without pulling away before he wants to. He presses his face into the crook of Cas’s neck and says, ‘Just…don’t go.’ It’s a stupid thing to say, because Cas isn’t going anywhere, and he doesn’t know if he means now, or ever, but he means both anyway.
It’s been a long time coming, but Dean’s good with who he is. He feels settled. As settled as he’ll ever be.
not a mother hen.’
‘Pretty sure you already got an eyeful.’
He wants to tell Dean how much it meant to him, how beautiful it was, but all he can think to say is, ‘Was that…good?’
Fuck. What did he do to make Cas leave this time? He’s about to resign himself to finishing the bath alone, but as he’s looking around for the shampoo, Cas walks back through the door with a jug. He fills it at the sink and brings it over.
‘Dean?’
The fire, still crackling in the grate, is the only light in the room. It casts Dean’s figure in shadow where he’s standing by the fireplace, head bowed, hands clenched by his sides.
Cas is frowning, his palm pressed flat to the counter. His other hand rests against his thigh. He looks up at Dean and says, ‘I understand.’
‘Uh, a week. Why?’
Castiel closes the distance, taking Dean’s hand, and letting Dean draw him in.
It’s nothing like the first kiss, but it’s still soft and slow. It’s two people who know each other better than anyone else, learning something new. When they part, Dean is a little breathless. He cups Cas’s jaw in his hand and says, ‘I love you, Castiel.’
‘That feel good?’
Dean clears his throat, then scrubs his hand through Cas’s hair. ‘Just don’t go growing your hair out. One hippie in this place is enough.’
For a moment, Castiel feels sick, and says, ‘Did I hurt you?’
‘Yes. We chose each other.’ Castiel fits his hand to the handprint. ‘We
Castiel has touched himself before—out of curiosity, then necessity, then just because he wanted to—but this feels so much better. He reaches out, curling his hand around the back of Dean’s neck.
Dean can’t blame Cas for being confused. He’s not being clear. At all. But he’s feeling so raw and exposed after the whole love confession, and he was hoping he wouldn’t have to talk about his feelings for a good while, yet. Maybe that’s cowardly or childish, but it seems he’s out of luck, anyway. He sighs and says, ‘Well, I thought you might wanna…you know. Sleep in there. With me.’ He waves at the lights. ‘Wasn’t sure if you’d still need ‘em with company, but figured they wouldn’t hurt.’
with it. But, even so, he’s surprised at how vehement it comes out when he says, ‘
‘I have a present for you.’ Cas half-turns, then moves back, leaning in to press a quick kiss to Dean’s lips. ‘Happy birthday, Dean.’
It’s soft at first, not
Without thinking, Dean says, ‘He doesn’t, he has Cas’s—’ He clamps his jaw.
With those words, the spell of the cabin is broken, and Castiel realises he’s more nervous about going back than he’d thought. He opens his mouth to tell Dean, then shuts it again. It’s foolish to be nervous. Whatever happens, he’s going to be by Dean’s side in one way or another.
When they kiss again, their teeth clack and Dean’s hand is somehow caught in the pillowcase. He yanks his hand free, whacking Cas in the shoulder in the process.
Cas gives him a small, bemused smile. ‘Thank you.’
It doesn’t explain why Cas has been avoiding him, though. He ignores the pitching in his stomach and how his chest feels a little too tight, focussing instead on the problem at hand. ‘But you’re still not sleeping with them?’
‘So I can
It’s not what Dean was expecting. He was thinking something along the lines of a favourite movie, not this. He looks at Cas, and Cas looks like the world is collapsing around him.
‘Yes.’
, but gentle. But then Cas sucks Dean’s bottom lip between his and Dean’s lips part on a moan, and then their tongues are sliding together, and gentle isn’t exactly the word Dean would use anymore. Hot is probably closer. Cas does something with his tongue, and Dean thinks, wow, yeah, definitely hot.
‘Shouldn’t I be asking you that?’
It’s the first time Cas has initiated being in the same room as Dean since he got back, and a spark of hope kindles in Dean’s chest. Maybe all Cas needed was some sleep to get over whatever had him avoiding Dean these past few days. Maybe now Dean can finally
‘Ghouls can get messy,’ Dean says. His voice comes out rougher than he’d meant it to.
because now he has to be naked. In front of Cas. But he’s not going to chicken out, not when Cas’s look is part-hope all-challenge. So, he shrugs off his jacket and his shirt, letting them fall in a heap on the tiles.
‘Yes, I’m sure.’ But even as Cas says this, he pushes at Dean’s shoulders, sitting up, leaving Dean kneeling between his legs. ‘Do
They sit there a while longer, in the silence of Dean’s room, staring at each other like a couple of goofballs, until Dean’s phone buzzes from the nightstand. He moves away from Cas reluctantly and checks his phone. There’s a new text from Sam and one he missed earlier from Jack.
Cas grins. ‘They had a very deep bond.’
‘Cas,’ Dean murmurs against his mouth.
‘You’re folding it wrong,’ Dean says.
The little spark of hope bursts into flames, consuming him, razing the doubt to the ground. Another feeling replaces it, bubbling up from deep within Castiel, something old and new all at once. It comes bursting out of him in a peal of laughter.
‘Yeah?’ Dean glances down, but the bubbles obscure Cas below the waist. Dean is hard, though, not quite aching with it, but it’s been simmering since Cas said he’d help Dean with the bath and is now a pleasant burn engulfing him.
‘Right.’ Dean chews on his lip, brow furrowed. He shakes his head and says, ‘It can wait.’
All the pent up feelings—passion, love, hope, despair—explode out of Dean when he gets Cas back from the empty, determined to keep him this time. Cas, for his part, is surprised—of course he is, the stupid bastard, thinking he’s unlovable—but easily catches up. He has enough pent up feelings of his own, after all.
