“I don’t know,” Cas said skeptically. “Last time we had fun, I threw up like 3 times and woke up wearing one of Charlie’s bras.”
Cas looked up at her and shook his head. “No. I… that’s not a good idea.” After what had happened before… Well, Cas couldn’t let that happen again. His father would… Cas closed his eyes. No. His dad had disowned him. What he thought shouldn’t matter. Besides, Castiel didn’t want to hurt anyone. Not again. Not even Gordon.
“I just… he…” Balthazar couldn’t form the words. It wasn’t like he was jealous, he just saw through Dean’s act. He didn’t want his best friend to get hurt. That’s all. “I just don’t want you to get hurt,” he repeated in a whisper, looking down at the ground.
Dean sat alone at lunch. Robin was busy with Homecoming dance preparations and Dean just didn’t have the energy to joke around with the boys. He went from lost in thought to high alert, however, when he spotted Gordon leaving the cafeteria. He didn’t trust that dick to not blow this whole thing up in Dean’s face. He had to make sure he wasn’t going to tell anyone. Unfortunately, he knew the best way to do that.
“Looks like you might have some competition here, Cas,” said the coach as he approached them. “Winchester, right?”
Okay so maybe Cas was staring at Dean’s… Well, everything. But honestly, could anyone really blame him for that? Dean was unfairly handsome, and everything about him left Cas breathless. Maybe he wasn’t ready to admit that his feelings for Dean were something more than that, but he could only deny his attraction to Dean for so long. Whatever else he may or may not have felt for Dean, he knew one thing for sure.
“Just someplace I like to go to eat in peace,” Robin said, smiling tentatively. Dean could tell this wasn’t somewhere she took just anyone for lunch. “Dean, I… To tell you the truth, I do like you. I have since you first came to Sonny’s. And Cas… well, that’s never gonna happen. For a lot of reasons, but it’s complicated.”
Robin stood and cleared her throat. “Well, I hope you feel better, Cas. My dad will be waiting for me at the diner. I’ll tell Anna you said hi.”
“No, it’s alright,” Cas stopped him, offering a small smile. “It’s just… family isn’t easy for me to talk about. I’m surprised you don’t know already.”
Cas sang to Dean until his voice was barely even a whisper and Dean was asleep in his arms. He didn’t dare move and wake him. He was grateful that the other boys were sound sleepers.
Dean almost choked. He tried to keep it cool, cracking a joke. “Aren’t you gonna buy me dinner first?” he asked as he knelt down on the grass.
That felt like a punch in the gut to Balthazar. Of course he already knew it… He’d seen the way Cas looked at Dean from the beginning. It was plain as day. But that didn’t mean he liked it.
“Hey, bird boy,” called a voice from below, and Cas stiffened. He looked down with disgust when he saw Gordon standing at the base of the tree. The older boy smirked and taunted, “Got your wings yet?”
Dean’s heart was still pounding in his ears, and his skin was buzzing and warm all over. He never even knew kissing could feel that good. Sure, Dean had thought about kissing Cas, but he never thought he’d actually go through with it. He definitely never thought that Cas would kiss him. The whole thing made Dean’s head spin.
It all felt wrong. He hated that he felt like running away every time Robin touched him. He liked her, he did. She just wasn’t Cas. But Cas wasn’t here.
He couldn’t very well tell Dean that every time they spoke he wished Dean was closer, touching, more. Sure, Dean knew he was gay now and he hadn’t flipped out, but if he knew the extent of Cas’s feelings he might change his mind. Cas didn’t have a clue what he was doing. He was still trying to come to terms with the whole thing, and then Dean Winchester dropped into his life and it was all too much at once. It had taken him so long to accept that he was attracted to boys, but now he had feelings, deeper feelings, for a very specific boy and it was all new.
“Dammit,” he muttered, following Gordon and that thing into the school. Gordon may have been a dick, but Dean was a hunter. And saving people was his job. Even people like Gordon.
Dean jumped, turning around and relaxing when he saw Robin standing there, a couple of notebooks held to her chest.
Dean shrugged, wincing and holding his arm. He offered a hesitant smile. “I couldn’t let you get hurt.” As if it was as simple as that. Maybe it was, Cas thought. Maybe Dean really did care about him more than Cas had ever even imagined. “Alright, enough of that sappy bullshit,” he said with an awkward laugh. “I’m bleedin’ here.”
“Hey, Dean!” Dean startled at Cas’s voice as the boy caught up with him outside the gym. He smiled at the boy, cursing the heat rising on his cheeks. He couldn’t figure out this effect Cas seemed to have on him. “You heading back to Sonny’s?”
Personally, Cas thought it was more “Christian” to love someone for more than just sex, but that’s not what his father had taught him. Man and woman. Anything else was a sin.
“Because I’m asking you,” Dean stated with a shrug. Pausing, he added, “I wanna get your side of the story, not some bullshit rumors.”
He wondered if this was how normal teenagers felt. He didn’t think this was normal. Benny was always staring at cheerleaders, and Dean wondered if that’s what he was supposed to be doing too. He just wanted to be a normal teenage boy, dammit.
“Dinner’s on the table,” Sonny told Cas as he opened the door for him, gesturing inside with a smile. “How was school?”
Cas smiled at her. “It’s not a carnival without a fun house.” Then, turning to Dean, “Wanna take a look?”
“Check the bottom drawer by your bed,” Sonny told him, folding his arms over his chest and leaning against the doorframe. “Hope they’re a good fit for ya.”
“I’m going to study with Charlie and Balthazar,” Cas told him. Their shoulders brushed as they walked and Dean really hoped that Cas would blame his flushed cheeks on the wrestling drills. “I’ll be out until six or so. I was thinking… maybe we could play some more cards later? The other night kinda made me realize I don’t have a clue what I’m doing.” Cas laughed, embarrassed, and the only word Dean could think to describe it was adorable.
Cas blushed when Dean called him ‘dark and mysterious.’ Was that really what people thought of him? Was that really what Dean thought of him? He decided not to dwell on the thought.
His train of thought was utterly derailed when he saw Dean walking back into the gymnasium with Robin at his side. She was on student council so of course she would be here, but Cas still wasn’t prepared to watch her plant a chaste kiss on his cheek and squeeze his hand before nudging Dean to join the team.
Dean obliged, because Cas seemed to calm down as he focused his energy on taking care of Dean. Cas grabbed the first aid kit and grabbed what he needed. The cut wasn’t too deep, so he wouldn’t need stitches, but he did need to stop the bleeding.
Dean laughed and leaned forward, grabbing Cas’s shoulder. “And how exactly are we going to do that?”
Cas smiled at him, though he was both thrilled and panicked when he realized that Dean’s bed was right next to his. It was obvious he had formed some kind of attraction to Dean, and it needed to be quelled. But… Cas swallowed.
Cas went to school smiling the next day, something he didn’t usually do. He was talking to Dean and Dean was talking to him, and he couldn’t help but kick himself for wasting so much effort pushing Dean away. It was good, and Cas was happy.
“Are you… I mean, after you saw… Well, I thought…” Dean sighed, frustrated, and just spit it out. “Are you afraid of me?”
Dean and Cas lingered for just a moment, neither of them quite ready to separate. After a minute, Dean reluctantly sat up, smiling at Cas. “Shall we?” he offered weakly.
As practice was wrapping up, Dean’s focus was drawn to Cas. The boy was smiling and helping his opponent back to his feet. When coach called it a day, the boys flocked towards the locker rooms and Cas pulled his t-shirt off to wipe sweat from his face. Dean’s swallowed thickly, licking his dry lips and watching the boy’s fingers comb through his hair. Watching sweat drip down his chest, his stomach, and into the waistband of his shorts…
He didn’t think about it when he found an empty seat next to Dean in their first class of the day. He usually sat with Balthazar and Charlie but this thing with Dean was new and exciting and all he could think about was being close to him.
Robin smiled and tucked her hair behind her ear. Adorable. “You could say that,” she laughed. “You’re persistent, I’ll give you that.”
Dean didn’t even have a chance to speak before Chuck was dashing out of the room again. Strange kid, he thought.
Dean glanced at his hand and stopped, closing the knife and clutching it in his fist. He almost looked embarrassed, Cas thought, though he couldn’t imagine why. It was a neat trick.
“Hey, uh, Benny mentioned he had a few questions about an assignment,” Dean told Cas, smiling apologetically. “I forgot I told him I’d help him out at lunch.”
Ruth smiled and led the boys inside, showing them where the cleaning supplies were and then joining Sonny in the foyer. “What do you make of Dean?” she asked.
Balthazar fought against her hold for a few seconds more before groaning in frustration and giving in. “You’re right. I know you’re right. It’s just every time I see him…”
His disappointment was momentarily forgotten when he saw Robin walk in. He hoped she would sit close to him so he could focus on her instead of worrying so much about why Cas wasn’t talking to him.
Dean went out for shakes at Robin’s family’s diner with the rest of the team after the meet. He was disappointed that Cas wasn’t there, but he tried not to focus on that. It really wasn’t fair to Robin to be thinking about anything else but her smile and her hand on his knee.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded. “I get it.” And Dean thought that was that, but Robin continued, speaking carefully.
Robin rolled her eyes and gave him a knowing, affectionate smile. “Obviously. See ya, feel better.” Cas nodded and Robin left.
He looked down at the source of the voice. Robin. He was surprised but not unhappy to see her. He smiled.
Cas watched him go, sitting there in confusion. That was… weird. Dean hadn’t spoken to him all week, and now, he tried to make small talk only to disappear immediately after. Just when Cas thought he had figured out the mystery of Dean Winchester, the boy threw him another curve ball.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Well, first of all, it’s Robin and you know she still has a thing for you. And second of all, I didn’t see him flirting with anyone but you during class today.”
After class was over, Cas said goodbye to Dean and met up with Balthazar, who was being unusually quiet.
He made it about an hour before he’d had enough. He decided to head out to the football field and try and get a good seat. He didn’t know when Benny was planning on showing up but he didn’t really care much about that. He was mostly going because it was easier than going home and being ignored by Cas all night. He could only take so much of that.
They had also agreed that kissing was awkward and not really something they should do with each other anymore. Dean was relieved as soon as Robin admitted that it felt forced to her, too.
When they made their way to the ticket booth and Cas saw Dean standing there with that cocky grin of his, Cas couldn’t contain his excitement. He ran up and hugged the boy, grinning ear to ear when Dean hugged him back and laughed softly.
It was Friday and Cas couldn’t wait for class to get out. For the first time in almost a year, he was having a movie night with Balthazar and Charlie. Normally he would regret letting Charlie pick the movie because he never understood what was happening, but this time he really couldn’t care less what they watched. He just missed hanging out with his best friends.
“Why don’t you ask someone else? Everyone here knows the story,” he whispered, only a little bitter.
Dean grimaced. “Oh, it’s going just great,” he told them. “I love having the whole school stare at me everywhere I go. Like I’m some freak or something.”
“I didn’t see Cas tonight,” Sonny commented, and Dean could tell he was going somewhere with this. “Any idea why he didn’t show?”
Dean mumbled something about how he’d heard that one before but followed Cas anyway. He sat down awkwardly between Cas and Charlie, and Balthazar was on the other side of Cas.
“We have to go,” Cas said again, whispering it to himself a few times after that. Okay, so maybe Cas was freaking out, Dean realized.
What he missed when he looked away, though, was a look of utter confusion and disappointment and hurt on Dean’s face. Dean had thought that maybe… He flinched away from Cas like he’d been burned. No. It was stupid. Cas was… perfect. And smart, and funny, and beautiful inside and out. And Dean was just broken. It was stupid to think Cas would even consider someone like him. Just plain stupid.
“Oh, I’m pretty sure she’s interested,” Dean smirked. “I told her I was trying out for the wrestling team and she said she’d come watch.”
Balthazar made a face at him. “Hey, don’t be disrespecting my man Spock. How many times has he saved Kirk’s ass?”
He wanted to say something, but nothing seemed quite right. Not here, not now, not enough. He just wanted his friend back. And maybe, if he was lucky, he wouldn’t mind Cas kissing him again. He hadn’t had the presence of mind to appreciate it enough the first time and he missed the feeling. He wanted another go.
What he couldn’t admit was that his feelings for Dean were already out of his control. He was already terrified to lose him… so why did he keep pushing Dean away?
“‘Bout time you had lunch with me after all that flirting,” she teased, winking and nudging his shoulder with hers.
After the team dispersed, Cas took a deep breath and he was about to approach Dean when out of nowhere Robin ran up and hugged him.
“We didn’t--” Dean stopped short. There was no use lying, and he was tired of it anyways. He wasn’t going to admit it out loud, what Cas meant to him, whatever this thing was between them, but he couldn’t quite deny it either. “I fucked up,” he said finally, a resigned whisper.
Dean was tired. He had been trying so hard to deny his feelings for Cas, but something about the way Robin was looking at him, so understanding and kind… He just couldn’t do it anymore.
“Dude, what the hell?” Dean grunted. He was fighting every instinct he had not to go for his knife and have the taller boy on the ground in under two seconds. But that would definitely not go over well. “Get the hell off me,” he warned, staring Balthazar down. The blond didn’t back off, just shoved him harder against the wall.
Gordon grunted and tried to push Dean away but it became pretty clear that Dean was stronger than him. He’d been holding back before. “No, you crazy freak,” he snapped. “You think anyone would believe me?”
“Yeah, whatever,” Dean chuckled, shaking his head. Benny was already heading back to his table where Ash and Chuck were bickering about something or other. Dean turned back to Robin and smiled, a bit forced. “I don’t have to paint my face, do I?”
“No you’re not,” Dean said in a soft tone, and Cas’s heart ached. He watched as Dean stood up and crossed the distance between their beds. He took a seat on the edge of Cas’s mattress and Cas could just barely see his face with the moonlight shining in through the window. “C’mere,” Dean said, holding his hand out. Cas looked at it hesitantly. “My brother used to have nightmares. I held him until he could fall asleep again. Can I...?”
“Regretting your decision to let her pick?” Balthazar whispered to Cas as they followed Charlie inside.
Downstairs, Sonny had breakfast ready for the boys, eggs and bacon and toast with jam. It was like a dream. “So Dean, Cas,” Benny said, after Sonny walked out the front door and sat on the porch to eat his breakfast. “I heard you two up late last night. Something you wanna share with the class?” he asked, waggling his eyebrows at the two of them.
Cas stumbled back, instinct telling him to listen to Dean but he didn’t want to leave him alone. “Dean…”
“Oh, it’s nothing like that,” Ash told him, waving a hand. “Nah, they’re just not used to seeing new people. Small town and all that.”
It wasn’t entirely untruthful. It just wasn’t the full story. Cas wasn’t ready for Dean to know the full story. He didn’t know if he ever would be.
Still, she reminded herself, Dean was here, talking to her, flirting with her, smiling at her. And Cas was pushing him away, hell he was pushing her away too. Maybe they could find something in each other in all this mess.
A familiarly loud engine rumbled from about a block away, back at Sonny’s, and Dean’s heart sank as his words trailed off. All thoughts of telling Cas that he… well, telling him how he felt, flew out the window. His dad was back, and Sammy…
Nodding and turning to face her, Balthazar sighed. “Let’s go before I do something stupid like rip his fucking arms off.”
Dean shifted in his seat, pulling his jacket down and attempting to hide the evidence of his train of thought. He couldn’t help himself, though, he kept sneaking glances at Cas. Even when Cas wasn’t looking at him, he could see the slight drawing together of his eyebrows as he concentrated, and the tiny frown on his face as he subtly mouthed the words he was writing. He was wearing a dark blue shirt that brought out his eyes, topped with a black hoodie, and his hair was sticking out in every which way.
Gabriel pursed his lips. “She’s… doing better, I guess. She misses you. But all things considered I think she’s doing alright.”
“I might’ve heard that somewhere,” Dean nodded, looking away and huffing out half of a laugh. “So what made you change your mind about me?”
“I…” The word got caught in Cas’s throat. Of course he’d noticed. But Dean wouldn’t… well, Cas realized, he didn’t really know what Dean would or wouldn’t do. He didn’t actually know him. But the way he talked to Cas, it sure didn’t seem like he was playing him.
“But you’re so nice to me,” Cas argued, grabbing his arm, and Dean watched his hand as his mouth fell open just a bit. “You’re so nice and you helped me and I was a jerk.”
Dean stared at him tentatively, waiting for the other shoe to drop but it didn’t. He offered a half smile. “I don’t think Mr. Tightass would switch things up anyways,” he told Cas, laughing and trying to lighten the air a bit. He nodded subtly to the teacher and slid his finger across his throat, making a face, and Cas laughed.
Dean and Cas stood there in silence for a few moments. When Dean didn’t speak, Cas squinted at him. “Dean? Is everything alright?”
Dean finished his food before the other boys and headed upstairs. He didn’t want to push it, but he figured he’d give Cas the chance to say something. He knew it was kind of a long shot, though.
He tried not to get too distracted by Dean in his uniform. And he thought gym shorts were bad. That was nothing compared to how incredibly revealing those unitards were.
Cas didn’t understand Dean. Why was he still here? Why was he still trying to be close to Cas? Why did he care? After what he’d done, how could Dean even look at him?
“What?” Dean flinched away, startled, and Cas reached up to touch his face. His throat was ripped out, he should be dead, but he was talking to Dean.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Fine. But I have to do my chores first. Then the other boys are going to help out at the church so we can meet up.” Sonny never made Cas help them at the church, considering his… situation. It hadn’t ended well the first time, and Sonny never pushed it after that.
“So,” Balthazar said, slinging his arm over Cas’s shoulders and leading him off the porch. “I was thinking. Now that you’re here and good old dad isn’t around to get all high and mighty on me, I was thinking we should go out. Ya know, have some fun.”
Cas eyed him, trying to decide how he wanted to answer that. On the one hand, Dean’s agreement that they wouldn’t talk would sure make this a whole lot easier. On the other hand, though… The thought of Dean giving up and never talking to him again made Cas’s stomach twist painfully.
It took him a minute or two to find the will to get up. He climbed out of bed, rubbing his eyes and putting on his sweats and a t-shirt. He walked down the hall and frowned when he noticed Anna’s door was open. He peeked inside and felt his heart drop when her bed was empty. Shit.
Without a word, Dean led Cas out of the fun house. He silently noted that he was totally right and that fun houses are never a good idea, but it wasn’t the time.
The thought made Cas nauseous. If Dean was telling the truth, then he was risking his life every day to help people. It was admirable, sure, but Cas knew it also meant Dean wouldn’t always come out alive.
Balthazar’s head snapped up at Cas’s words, and his heart ached. Cas met Dean barey 3 weeks ago. Balthazar had known Cas since they were in preschool, and Dean got to waltz in acting like he knew everything? Bullshit. Balthazar knew Cas better than anyone else. No one could take that from them.
“I can take care of myself,” Cas said slowly. “What are you so worried about? Dean and I are just talking. We’re friends.”
Cas had to leave the house before Dean had the chance to get out of bed just to keep himself from giving in and talking to Dean. If he was being honest with himself, he knew it was only a matter of time before he couldn’t keep up the act anymore, and last night had only made him more certain of that. There was something about the way Dean held him and comforted him that made Cas want to stay in his embrace for the rest of eternity. And maybe Dean would agree to hold him again if only Cas could let himself accept it…
“We were just about to play some board games,” Cas told him. His smile hadn’t left his face. He hadn’t seen his brother in almost 6 months, and now he was here out of the blue and Cas couldn’t believe how much he’d missed him. “Wanna join us?”
Dean got back to Sonny’s and walked up the stairs without a word, tense and alert when he walked in the bedroom to find Cas sitting on his bed in the corner. Dean gulped and took a seat on his own bed, grabbing his knife from his pocket. He began twirling it around in his fingers, staring at it in somewhat of a daze.
Once all the boys had finished their chores, Sonny loaded them up into his truck. Dean noticed that Gordon and Cas weren’t with them. He couldn’t help but wonder why that was. Sonny drove them to the church and it all seemed pretty normal to Dean, so why wasn’t Cas there? Dean guessed he had some sort of thing against religion. He could understand that.
“And I don’t know,” Cas said, voice rising frantically. “One minute I was just showing him some wrestling moves for the meet tomorrow, and then…” Cas let out a frustrated sigh. “He was just so close. He was looking at me like he… I don’t know. I just… I kissed him. And he kissed me back, I think.”
Balthazar swung his fist, right into Gordon’s jaw. Gordon stumbled back a bit, then looked back at him, holding his hand up to his bleeding lip. And the son of a bitch had the nerve to laugh.
Dean was disappointed when Cas closed off in the presence of the other boys, but he understood. Even as he mourned Cas’s open expression, he felt himself rebuilding his own walls.
Cocky. That’ll get old really quickly, Castiel thought. He looked away from Dean without a word and crossed his arms, scolding himself for so blatantly staring at Dean.
Dean felt something dangerous tug at his heart: hope. He sighed and leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. Benny didn’t say anything else, but it was enough for Dean to feel like he was drowning.
They reached the lake in about 20 minutes, and the boys hopped out of the truck almost before Sonny even came to a full stop.
Dean lost his balance a bit, dropping the ravioli cans from his jacket, and the deputy shook his head. “Turn around, kid,” he said, pulling out a pair of handcuffs. Dean panicked. He couldn’t get caught. On instinct, he threw a punch at the deputy and tried to run again, but the other officer was there to catch him by the arm.
Well, he was having fun, until he glanced at the entrance and his eyes fell on Cas. He was wearing a suit that didn’t quite fit him and his hair was ruffled a little more purposefully than it usually was. His blue eyes shone like actual fucking stars under the dim lights and Dean couldn’t breathe for a moment.
“What do you mean by that?” Dean asked, leaning in close so he could see the wound better. Cas’s heart skipped a beat and he inched back just a bit.
Dean paused his ministrations and took a moment to study the inscription on the blade. “Yeah, pure silver.”
“I should’ve known,” Cas said and his breath hitched with a half sob. “You and Charlie… You’re the only ones I can count on.”
Charlie laughed and Balthazar forced a smile. “Your favorite,” Charlie said. “Have you guys done the fun house yet? It’s wacky.”
He glanced down when he heard a light clattering on the floor. He saw a pencil rolling towards him and he glanced back to see Robin smiling at him. He smiled too at the throwback to the first day of class, reaching down to pick up her pencil.
Cas was relieved to have made it to his last class mostly without incident. He hadn’t seen Dean since lunch which made ignoring him a little easier. And he had his last class with Balthazar so that was a plus. They didn’t get to sit next to each other thanks to the seating chart, but it was still comforting to have him close.
Dean followed Cas to the bedroom, his face heating up. He must have caught some sort of bug. That had to be it.
“Anytime,” she said softly. She turned back to the front as the teacher entered the room, but Dean counted that as a win.
Dean scoffed. “Whatever,” he mumbled. He shed his shirt so he was wearing just his sweatpants, feeling an unexpected sense of disappointment set in when Cas wordlessly returned to his own bed. He frowned slightly as he laid down and pulled the blankets up to his waist.
As the two of them fell quiet again, Dean couldn’t help but wonder about Cas’s past with Gordon. Was it really that bad? Maybe he would ask one of the other boys after all. For now, though, he decided to try for some sleep. But between Benny arguing with Chuck over his fantasy romance supernatural novel (“Why would vampires kill for sport? That’s a waste of perfectly good food!”), and Cas humming softly to himself, and thoughts of Sam…
Cas had one arm awkwardly draped over the back of the seat, very deliberately not around Dean’s shoulders even though that would probably be more comfortable. He felt warm and buzzing everywhere that he and Dean were touching. It was all Cas could do not to grab him by the waist and tug him fully onto his lap and--
It was crazy. Dean had never felt this way about a guy before. And he wasn’t gay. It was just… Cas. He didn’t know how else to describe it. He had never felt like this until he met Cas. Everything about the boy was perfect. He was the most incredible person Dean had ever met and he’d fucked it all up. Of course, he knew it was always just a matter of time before people saw the real Dean and ran scared. The life of a hunter.
The vampire let out a shriek and jumped at him, and Dean side-stepped. He used her momentum to shove her towards the stalls, opening the door and then slamming it shut with expert timing. The head rolled out from the stall and Dean made a face, breathing heavily. “Don’t lose your head or anything,” he muttered, smiling to himself.
Too soon, Dean was breaking away to breathe, though he didn’t go far. His forehead was still pressed against Cas’s and his hands roamed a bit, to his jaw, to the small of his back, gentle and unsure. When Cas opened his eyes, Dean was staring at him, doubt and insecurity written all over his face. Cas simply couldn’t have that. He tilted his chin up and kissed Dean lightly, more brief this time, but it was enough to smooth the hard lines of Dean’s features into a relieved smile.
Castiel tried to stand, looking at Dean with confusion. Why was he trying to protect him? He could take care of himself, anyways. But still, why would Dean even want to stick up for him?
So it didn’t matter that he wanted to be close to Dean, or that Dean was trying so hard to be his friend. It didn’t matter that Cas couldn’t help but smile every time Dean cracked a dumb joke or even spoke Cas’s name. And it most definitely didn’t matter that Cas’s heart leaped every time their hands brushed during a lab assignment. None of that could matter to Cas if he ever wanted to see his family again.
Still, Dean couldn’t get him out of his head. He couldn’t forget the way Cas’s hands had touched him oh, so gently as they kissed. He couldn’t forget the heated, dazed look in Cas’s eyes when he pulled away, or how it was almost instantly replaced with panic. And he most definitely couldn’t forget the Cas’s body had felt against his own…
Dean couldn’t figure out what Cas was doing. “Man, I don’t know what you want from me,” he said, shaking his head. “If you want me gone, say go.”
Grabbing the band-aids from the first aid kit, Dean finished patching Cas up, but he didn’t move away just yet.
“What do you guys think of that new history teacher?” Chuck asked the table. “He’s kinda scary if ya ask me.”
Cas’s eyes snapped open when he heard the door open, looking over just in time to watch Dean slip out. He wanted to stop him… but no. This was a good thing. Cas’s feelings for Dean would only lead to more problems, so Cas let him go, as much as it hurt.
A second before it could lay a claw on Cas, the werewolf jolted to a halt with an agonized whine, falling to the ground with Dean’s silver knife stuck through its heart.
Balthazar shrugged. “Just some sorry sap selling the ‘next big thing,’” he said, making air quotes. “Nothing to worry about.”
“Try not to think about it, okay? You’re safe, that’s all that matters,” he whispered, leading her to Charlie’s sister’s car.
Dean couldn’t figure it out. One minute Cas is talking to him and he’s kind and soft and you’d never imagine he even knew how to throw a punch. And the next, he’s scaring Gordon shitless with one good right hook. It didn’t make sense. One thing Dean knew for sure, though…
Cas was a terrible liar, he knew that. And he didn’t want to be the one to tell Dean that he had gotten drunk and done some stupid shit with Gordon, even if it wasn’t true. But that was the story everyone but a select few believed. It was better that way. If anyone found out what really happened… well, he didn’t know what would happen. But he had to keep Anna safe, even if that meant getting disowned by his family and being stuck in this place. As long as it wasn’t Anna going through it.
“But he’s been through a lot,” she told him. “Sometimes he forgets that not everyone sees the worst in him and he pushes people away. He forgets that we’re not all judgmental jerks.”
As soon as class was dismissed, Cas jumped out of his seat and practically skipped to meet Balthazar at the door. The taller boy laughed and slung an arm over Cas’s shoulder as they walked.
Cas huffed out an incredulous laugh, but he could tell Dean was telling the truth. As insane as it was. “So… the guy at the carnival, was he…?”
The bell rang and the three of them tossed their trays and headed to class. Cas was grateful that he shared his next class with Charlie so he didn’t have to walk alone, as Balthazar split off in the opposite direction.
“So you won the team the tournament last year,” Dean said with a laugh, nudging Cas teasingly. “That would’ve been nice to know before I made that little deal.”
“Newbie!” Benny grinned, clapping Dean on the shoulder. “Glad you decided to join us. Ash was just telling us about his process. Ya know, it’s a miracle he gets his hair to be so majestic every day. I’m jealous.”
“Have you never been kayaking before?” he asked Dean with an amused smile. His eyes widened a bit when Dean shook his head sheepishly. “Wait, really? I definitely would’ve thought of you as the outdoorsy type.”
Dean’s heart clenched. It was the first time he’d admitted it out loud. He honestly didn’t know if his dad was ever coming back for him, but he didn’t think he even wanted him to.
“That’s… Well, honestly I don’t really know. I mean I thought we were friends or something but he keeps getting all weird around me and now he’s not talking to me.” Dean looked at Robin and he felt guilt wash over him, though he wasn’t totally sure why. Her expression looked sad and understanding, though Dean didn’t really know what she was understanding.
Still, he couldn’t break Cas’s heart over a hunch. All he could do was be there for Cas and hope that he was wrong about Dean.
“Perfect!” Charlie said brightly, clapping her hands together and jumping a little as they walked. “So, there’s this new bowling alley. There’s a bar and they couldn’t spot a fake ID if it had their own name on it. Also, their mozzarella sticks are to die for.”
“I’ve never seen you so excited to be confused about Star Trek,” Balthazar teased, and Cas just grinned.
Dean walked with Cas all the way through the lunch line as they got their food. He didn’t totally believe Cas when he said he was fine, so he wanted to keep an eye on him just in case.
“I changed my mind,” Cas told him, smiling a bit and helping Dean to his feet. “If we’re going to be living in the same house, in the same room no less, I suppose there’s really no point trying so hard to avoid talking.”
Balthazar’s chest felt tight. That definitely wasn’t what he was expecting. “Okay…” he said slowly, trying to quell the jealousy that threatened to show its face. “And?”
He laid down on his back, crossing his arms behind his head despite the soreness in his muscles. He stared at the ceiling as he spoke. “So, what stupid thing really got you stuck in here, Dean Winchester? I get the feeling it was more than punching a cop.”
“He’s…” Balthazar trailed off. He was really trying to control the amount of jealousy in his tone. “Did you see him flirting with Robin earlier?”
“Bal, this is serious!” Cas whispered frantically. “If my dad finds out he’ll be so pissed. And I don’t even know where she’s going!”
“Mr. Winchester,” the teacher said, annoyed, pausing in his lecturing. “Please, stop daydreaming and start taking notes. This will be on the test.”
“Looks like I’m asking, then,” Dean said, slapping on a charming smile. Robin rolled her eyes and smiled at him.
The next thing on his list was figuring out what to do about the dance. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go with Robin, but he was afraid that he was giving her the wrong impression. Every chaste kiss was getting more and more forced and he felt like the worst person on the planet.
It was all Dean could do to resist grinning like a school boy. He’d never been to a carnival, one that wasn’t haunted at least. And he’d certainly never had friends to go with.
“Believe what you want, but I can see it,” Charlie cut him off. “He likes you. He probably doesn’t even realize it yet but he does. And you like him.”
At least Dean wasn’t completely alone, Cas reasoned. But he knew that didn’t change the way he felt every time Dean tried to talk to him at Sonny’s and Cas shot him down.
“I did until you picked it for ten movie nights in a row,” Charlie whined. “How many times are you going to watch it before you get bored?”
“I do,” Cas said softly, frowning at the sidewalk. “But what’s the harm in being his friend? We’re just… talking.”
“Ohhh,” Cas said in realization. “That makes sense. Well here, let me show you.” He situated his double-sided oar across himself and began paddling farther from shore. “You just alternate strokes like this to move in a straight line. And keep it to one side to turn.”
Robin giggled and Dean looked at her with a smile. He watched the way she tucked her hair behind her ears. It was kind of adorable.
Dean grinned, shrugging. “I was goin’ easy on ya. I didn’t know you were the freakin’ reigning champ. So not fair.”
“Not up for negotiation,” Robin said with finality, grinning at him. He couldn’t help but smile back. “I’ve gotta go help them finish up in there, but I’ll see you later, Dean.”
Dean froze for a moment. “Uh…” He shook his head and smiled at Cas. “I, uh… I told you about my brother. What about you? Got any siblings?”
“Should I give you guys a minute?” Cas teased, and his friends snorted out a laugh in unison as the three of them sat down in the living room.
“Dean, what the hell was that?” Cas demanded frantically, his hands and voice shaking violently. “You killed that guy, and… and he… he said… Dean, what the hell?”
“I’m, uh, gonna go find Balthazar,” Charlie said, giving Cas a knowing look. Cas went bright red but before he had time to protest Charlie was gone and he was alone with Dean. Well, alone in the middle of a busy school hallway, but still.
Dean and Cas maneuvered their kayak until it was nearly parallel to the other one, and Cas stood up and caught the boys’ ship with his oar. With just the right angle, he yanked the oar down and the kayak tipped upside down, along with its brave crew.
Benny shrugged. “If you say so. You’re both just so mopey. I almost liked it better when you guys made gross doe-eyes at each other all the time.”
“Hey, sorry,” Cas said, clearing his throat. “We were just… Um… Dean won me a bee!” he told them excitedly, holding up his prize so they could see.
Cas was kicking himself. He couldn’t make up his damn mind. He knew he needed to push Dean away, but every time Dean obliged and let him be, he couldn’t seem to let him go. What the hell was wrong with him?
“Pick a game and I’ll see who it is,” he said, heading back down the hall. When he opened the door his jaw dropped in shock. “I… You… Long time no see,” he finally said, stepping aside and welcoming the guest in.
He was still lost in thought by the time he got to his first class. The teacher was the only one in the room but she didn’t mind Cas taking his seat early. He used to do it all the time when he didn’t want to be at home. He’d known Miss Larsen since he had her for math in 8th grade, and she was one of the few people who knew about his situation at home.
Dean turned to see a man in a deputy’s uniform standing over him. He gulped nervously. “Uh, sorry sir. I was just, uh…” he trailed off, panic setting in, and turned and broke into a sprint out the door.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, common mistake. They don’t get all furry and wolf-out. But the name stuck because of the full moon thing I guess.”
“Not exactly,” Dean said. “Not because of my dad. It’s just… I was supposed to look after him. I was supposed to be there to protect him no matter what. And I failed. I couldn’t even get food for him. Dad was right to be disappointed, honestly.”
Cas nodded. He didn’t think he would get more of an answer on that. Yet another mystery from Dean’s past. “So, you were going to teach me to play cards,” he changed the subject with a grin.
It’s not a big deal, he told himself. They were friends, they wore about the same size of shorts, and Dean needed something to wear to the lake. It was innocent enough. Why wouldn’t it be?
“It’s hard to leave once you’ve got people who care about you,” Robin said with a meaningful look, and Dean’s throat felt thick as he looked up at her. He knew what she meant, but he was still thinking of Cas. He’d thought that Cas cared about him, but after what he’d seen maybe that was no longer true. Maybe the kiss had revealed just a little too much darkness. Maybe Dean was just too broken.
“The only reason I’m okay with staying at Sonny’s… the only reason I can handle seeing Gordon’s face every day… is because I know you guys are safe. You, Anna… you three are the only reason any of this is bearable. I can’t let any of you get in trouble for my mistakes.” He paused, looking at Balthazar. “What if Gordon went to the cops? The only reason he didn’t is because they’d figure out what he did, but he still could… You shouldn’t push him. It’s not worth the risk. It could all come back to you. And back to Anna.”
Balthazar inched closer until their knees touched. His heart was pounding in his chest. “Just, um… here, put your hand on my shoulder or something and, uh…” Balthazar trailed off, looking at Cas. His heart caught in his throat at the way Cas was staring at him with wide, innocent eyes. “Like this…” Balthazar closed his eyes and leaned in, touching his lips to Cas’s ever so lightly. He slotted his bottom lip between Castiel’s slightly parted lips and just… stayed there. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.
Dean was about to ask for more details when the bell rang. Dammit. Every new thing he learned about Cas just made him want to know more about the boy. Which would be a hell of a lot easier if Cas would actually talk to him about more than their lab assignment. He still didn’t understand why Cas acted completely normal in class and then totally ignored him when they were at home.
Cas could feel Balthazar watching them from across the room, suspicious and brooding. He looked up when the teacher started the lesson, keeping his focus lasered in on taking notes. He was glad that it was a textbook kind of day and not a lab partner kind of day. It made things a bit less awkward.
Robin thought she had to be the unluckiest girl on earth. The only two guys she had ever wanted to have some sort of romantic relationship with, and they had the hots for each other. She could see it in Dean’s eyes when he talked about Cas. He was heartbroken that Cas was shutting him out, and he clearly had some kind of feelings for him. And she knew Cas liked Dean too, even if he had his reasons for keeping his distance.
Dean was struggling to keep up with the note-taking, his attention drawn to Cas’s hands and his quick, elegant writing. He wondered why he’d never paid much attention to Cas’s hands before. His fingers were long and nimble and Dean couldn’t help but remember the way they felt against his skin, pushing his shirt up just so…
The words echoed through Dean’s mind as he walked through the little convenience store, taking long deep breaths and trying to act normal. He saw the shelf with cans of ravioli and smiled a little. Sammy loved the mini ravioli. Almost as much as he loved mac and cheese.
Dean nodded, swallowing thickly as he felt warmth spread from where Cas touched him. “Good to know.” They continued walking to their room, and Dean helped Cas to his bed before sitting down on his own. “Get some rest,” he told Cas. “You’ve earned it, hero.”
“Anna, get out of here,” he said, staring at his trembling hands. “Please, go home. I’ll take care of this.”
Cas sighed. “You’re supposed to be the one with all the answers,” he joked weakly. “You always know how to make me feel better.”
He moaned when Cas’s fingers dug into his hip, sliding up underneath his t-shirt. Searching for more, Dean brought his other hand up to cup Cas’s cheek and sucked his bottom lip into his mouth, nipping gently, hesitant.
They walked to the end of the block before Cas paused. “I’m heading this way,” he said, gesturing vaguely. “I’ll see you later, Dean.”
They reached their classroom and sat down in a corner all together. This teacher never made assigned seats. Cas noticed Dean walk in and head directly for the back corner. He felt kinda bad for ditching him but he reminded himself that distance was for the best. He couldn’t get attached. Even if Charlie was right about him being cute…
Cas finally looked at him, and his throat felt so thick he didn’t think he could speak. “I…” he cleared his throat and forced himself to make eye contact. “Dean, you don’t have to…”
Taking a deep breath, Cas nodded and followed Dean’s lead once again. This was definitely a bad idea, he thought. But the grin on Dean’s face when Cas joined him in the kayak made it really, really hard for him to care about anything else.
Cas made it back to Sonny’s and went straight upstairs to his bed. He’d eaten at Charlie’s and he wasn’t in the mood for social interaction.
Balthazar’s heart broke at that. He didn’t know what to say, so he just squeezed Cas gently and buried his face in dark hair. “It’s okay, Cassie,” he murmured. “It’s okay.”
As Dean got closer to the school, he caught a glimpse of Gordon running inside. Running from someone. No, something.
Dean had busied himself with his pocket knife and the wooden bed posts, carving protective symbols into each one. He startled when Cas spoke, trying to pretend he wasn’t just distracting himself from the very distracting image of Cas with no shirt.
Cas tensed and instinctively looked to where Charlie was nodding to. He accidentally met eyes with the one and only Meg Masters and his heart clenched painfully. Meg glared daggers at him and Cas looked away,
Dean had hoped that Cas would say something like the last time. In chemistry class, when Dean had pulled away, Cas had pulled him back in, made him feel like he wasn’t crazy for thinking they could be friends. But this time… he gave up. Didn’t say a word. Yeah, Dean could take a hint. But he would have to be a goddamn mind-reader to figure out what the hell Cas wanted from him.
“Cas, I get it,” he said, and shook his head. “I mean, I don’t get it, but I figure you had your reasons. Doesn’t make you a bad person or anything.”
Cas hugged his stuffed bee to his chest, which was honestly the only thing keeping them from standing only inches away from each other. Dean inched closer until his chest touched the bee, keeping them just under a foot apart. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Cas’s face. His wide blue eyes, the slight wrinkle between his eyebrows, the barely-there part of his pink lips, the subtle hint of stubble shading his jaw. Dean wanted to reach up and touch that perfect face--
Castiel gritted his teeth, trying to cool his temper. He wanted to hop down there and shove Gordon’s face into the tree. It wouldn’t be hard. He wasn’t big, but he was stronger than Gordon for sure. But after what happened last time… Well, the thought was enough to cool Cas down pretty quick. He would just ride it out and Gordon would get bored eventually.
The closer they got to the dance, the less sure Cas was that it was a good idea to go at all. He didn’t want to see Dean, dancing with Robin and flirting with Robin and touching Robin… Everything he wanted Dean to do with him.
“It’s complicated,” Robin finally said, reaching out to touch Dean’s hand and then pulling back. Dean glanced down at the movement and inched his hand closer to her where it sat between them on the bench. She bit her lip and placed her hand over Dean’s. “Cas, he… well it’s a mess. It’s not really my place to tell.”
“Hello? Earth to Dean?” Ash said, waving a hand in front of Dean’s face and grabbing a sandwich before Ruth could even set the tray on the table. “Trust me, he’s not that interesting,” he said, and Dean’s eyes snapped away from Cas quickly. “He seems all mysterious and deep but you get past that pretty quick.”
“Then he’s a damn moron,” Balthazar said confidently, squeezing Cas’s hand and mustering up a smile. “You’re…” Everything. “You’re a catch.” Then, with a smirk, “Hot as hell too, Cassie. Dean would have to be blind or stupid.”
Breaking Cas out of his thoughts, Sonny came to stand in the doorway, asking how he was feeling. Gordon slipped in beside him and sneered at Cas.
“It wasn’t pity,” Cas told Dean, holding open the door for him as they entered the diner. “I just got tired of lying to myself.”
“I would’ve asked sooner if I thought you’d say yes,” Dean said honestly as they grabbed their trays of food.
Forcing himself to get to his feet, Dean tried to focus. He still had a job to do. Saving people. That’s what he was good at.
A sickening thought occurred to him and he hoped he was wrong. He started checking all the bedrooms, and as he reached the end of the hall he heard it.
“Well, he’s not at Sonny’s for the same reasons we all ended up here,” Chuck told him. “Most of us, our parents are either dead or never in the picture in the first place. But Cas, he… he basically got disowned.”
Cas turned, startled, and Charlie and Balthazar looked at him with surprise and rage respectively. “Dean?”
“Not dancing my ass!” Balthazar shouted, outraged. There was a knock at the door and he frowned. “I’ll get it!” he called to Charlie and Cas, heading down the hall.
Cas shrugged. “Not exactly. That was a nail in the coffin but not really what sealed the deal. I told you that Gordon was part of the reason I ended up at Sonny’s.” He paused, studying Dean’s expression. It was a mix of outrage and intrigue, he thought. “There was a party, and Gordon was being his usual self, and I kinda lost it on him… and one of his friends.”
He grabbed two cans of mini ravioli and stuffed them into his jacket. After closing his eyes for a second to steel his nerves, he started walking as casually as he could towards the exit.
Balthazar pursed his lips. Honestly? “I guess… probably not since before his mom got sick.” It broke his heart to say it out loud.
Cas settled into Balthazar’s side and pulled a blanket over his legs, sighing softly. He didn’t know what he would do without his best friends around to remind him that he was loved exactly the way he was. That he wasn’t some sort of freak of nature or abomination. They were the only people in the world he could truly rely on and trust no matter what. And that had been enough until…
“That was pretty impressive,” Cas told Dean, watching him with intense curiosity as they walked through the carnival. How the hell did he do that? These games were all rigged, so either Dean was incredibly lucky or he was the most skilled darts player in the world.
When the team went out for burgers afterwards, Cas chose not to join them. Robin and Dean were still standing way too close and Cas could only take so much. So after the bus took the team back to the school, Cas walked back to Sonny’s by himself. Once again, he felt stupid for allowing himself even a moment to hope that Dean would choose him.
Balthazar nodded and sighed. “You’re right. It was my stupid idea to invite Dean anyhow. I’ve just gotta get over it.”
Dean’s eyes widened. He thought one brother was a lot to handle. “Damn. How was that growing up?” Suddenly, he noticed Cas seemed uncomfortable with this topic and he frowned. “What’s wrong? I’m sorry if that was too personal--”
“What?” Dean frowned. What had he done wrong this time? “I just figure if we’re gonna see each other at school… Well, it’s kinda hard to avoid me completely. We live in the same house for crying out loud.”
Balthazar rolled his eyes, but he was grateful to see Cas smile. “Fine,” he pouted. “If it’ll really make you happy, I’ll wear a damn tux.”
His father was a cruel man, and horribly old fashioned (i.e. homophobic). From his friendship with Balthazar, Cas had learned that being gay wasn’t really a bad thing. That it didn’t make someone wrong or unlovable like his father had always taught him. He knew that. He knew that the feelings he had were normal and that he wasn’t a bad person, but when you’re taught to believe a certain thing for your entire life, it’s almost impossible to ever abandon that idea completely.
Cas shook out of his daze and looked at Charlie like a deer in headlights. “Uh, nothing. Not looking at anything.”
“Double kinky,” Charlie coughed. She hit her fist against her chest and cleared her throat. “Agh, sorry. I’ve just got this nasty cough. I must be coming down with something.”
“That’s not my problem,” Dean said coolly. “I don’t really give a damn if you do or not. I only really care what Cas thinks, that’s it. Long as he’ll have me, I’m along for the ride.”
Cas shook his head again, baffled. He couldn’t believe this. “How… how do you know all of this? This-This is crazy!”
He plopped down on his bed and laid down on his back, staring up at the wooden ceiling. They were so quiet, he could hear Cas breathing from where he was lying on his own bed.
Gabriel rubbed his brother’s back and held him close. He didn’t know what to say. “It’s alright, Cassie… Don’t worry about that, it’s alright…”
“Oh my god, she only goes to those try-outs to see Cas!” Ash told him, patting him on the shoulder and giving him a sad look. “Sorry, man. She’s not interested.”
Cas smiled and took his hand, and they continued towards Sonny’s. As they walked, Cas couldn’t help himself. “Why tonight? I mean, why… I thought you were into Robin, not me. What made you stay away for so long?”
Balthazar held him close. He had always been protective of Cas, but he did not trust Dean, at all. He didn’t see this ending any other way except Cas hurting and heartbroken, and Dean gone without a thought.
Despite Balthazar’s assurances, Cas figured there would be alcohol at this party. Hannah was a nice girl, but a house party with no parents meant alcohol and alcohol plus minors meant illegal. Cas couldn’t imagine how his father would react if Anna got arrested. Not to mention that she was fourteen and high school boys were disgusting.
Dean made a face at him. “Maybe if I’d known I was up against the reigning champ,” he laughed. “I wasn’t ready.”
As they made themselves comfortable in their respective beds, Dean couldn’t help but think of when he held Cas after a nightmare. He didn’t think Cas had any idea what that had meant to him. Without Sam… he didn’t have anyone left to take care of. No one that needed him. Not that he thought Cas needed him or anything, but in that moment he needed someone and Dean was there. Dean found himself wishing he could always be there when Cas needed comforting.
He had thought their last class of every day was going to be their time together. Walk to class together, share inside jokes in knowing glances across the room, walk home together after the bell rang. But Dean had to barge in and ruin the whole deal.
“Disowned?” Dean repeated, shocked. He suddenly felt a rush of sympathy and comradery towards Castiel. He was abandoned just like me… “For… for what?”
“Yes, father?” he responded weakly, closing the door and standing anxiously at the edge of the tile entryway.
Cas grimaced and picked up a bottle, looking at it as if it had offended him in some way. “Alright, but just one.”
Dean headed straight for the bedroom. He hoped Cas would be there, and was both confused and disappointed when he didn’t see him. About five minutes later, after Chuck had joined him in the room, Dean heard a noise outside the window. “What the hell?” he muttered, standing up and going to check it out.
“It was nothing,” Dean said, snapping Cas out of his thoughts. Cas shook his head, kicking himself mentally. Stop staring. It isn’t right. “I just don’t like guys who pick on people just ‘cuz they can. I don’t care how much your life sucks, you can’t treat people like that.”
“Damn right I am,” Dean retorted with a smirk, throwing three darts in a row and popping a top row balloon with each one. He grabbed three more darts and popped three more balloons, and then another three after that.
Cas loved sleep, so he didn’t appreciate being woken up at almost midnight. He groaned into his pillow, faintly remembering the sound of a door closing and cursing his neighbors.
Cas felt his stomach flip and he grinned. “I’m going to go upstairs,” he said, pausing and tilting his head at Dean. “You’re welcome to join me,” he added, and he could’ve sworn Dean’s shoulders sank a little, relieved.
He had made his decision. He waited for the others to fall asleep and for the sun to set, then grabbed his jacket and started for the door.
He decided he would find her after school. They needed to talk, as much as he was dreading it. He didn’t even know what he was going to say.
Dean resisted the urge to laugh. “Since I was little,” he shrugged. “But it’s mostly my dad’s thing, to tell ya the truth.”
Dean refused to expose Cas to his life, to the darkness. No matter how badly he wished he could tell him everything and no matter how much he hoped Cas would pull him close and tell him he loved him anyway.
“Howdy, boys,” Dean said, sitting down with a chuckle. As odd of a group as they were, Dean liked them. They didn’t treat him like he had a third eye or anything.
Smiling, Dean made his way to the cafeteria and looked around. He saw Benny and the other boys from Sonny’s waving him over, and he crossed the room with an honest-to-god smile.
Dean turned back to look at him again remembered why he’d been refusing to look at Cas for the last minute or so. In spite of his efforts, his focus was drawn to Cas’s bare chest, spattered with shining water droplets that made trails from his shoulders to his abdomen. Even as he attempted to meet Cas’s gaze again, his attention fixed on Cas’s lips. They looked soft and warm and Dean thought that if the other boys assumed they were making out maybe he’d give the people what they wanted…
Cas wasn’t exactly avoiding Dean. He wanted to talk to him about the kiss. About everything. He wanted to tell him how he felt. He just wanted to wait until they could actually sit down and have a real, private conversation. During class and even at lunch just wouldn’t cut it. So he stayed away, waiting until the day was over and he could catch Dean alone. It felt like the longest day of his life.
“Oh,” he said after a moment. “You must be the new kid.” He went to his bed, on the right corner closest to the door, and grabbed an inhaler. “I’m Chuck,” the boy said after taking a deep draw of his inhaler. “We’re about to have lunch. Nice to meet you.”
“I’m sorry,” he eventually said, quiet. “I guess I was just afraid you’d think I was some sort of freak. Everyone else does.”
Dean couldn’t speak. He wasn’t used to being the speechless one in these scenarios, but the very fact that Cas wasn’t freaking out was really freaking Dean out. He did as Cas said, removing his flannel and his t-shirt and throwing them in the nearest trash bin. He took the shirt Cas offered him and slipped it over his head.
Balthazar nodded. After a moment he shook his head to clear his head and smiled at Cas. “So, movie night or board games?”
Dean was distracted, too. Several times he considered passing Cas a note, but he felt silly even thinking about it. Besides, he didn’t really want Cas’s friends to read what he had to say.
Cas shrugged again. Balthazar sighed and rubbed his back, leaning over and kissing the side of his head before pulling him into a hug. Cas relaxed slightly in his hold and leaned into his chest. “If he was disappointed in me before… I don’t even want to think about what he’d say now.”
Cas stepped forward and shoved his chest. “Don’t you speak of her!” he growled. “Don’t you ever say her name!”
He refused to acknowledge the nagging feeling that begged the question, why was he so interested? Why did he care so much if Cas liked him? These weren’t questions he knew how to answer. Not yet, at least. All he knew was that he wanted to get close to Cas. The rest he would figure out later.
“Because… you don’t know him, Cas,” he continued, trying to make Cas understand without having to say the words. “We don’t know anything about him.”
“No,” Robin said, almost too quickly, and Dean raised an eyebrow at her. She laughed sheepishly. “I mean… They’ve never dated. But there’s always been… Well, at least on Balthazar’s side.” She paused, biting her lip. “Cas never felt the same, though.”
Cas nodded, an almost imperceptible motion but it was enough, and then Dean’s lips were on his. Cas made a soft noise in the back of his throat and Dean put his free hand on his hip, pulling him closer. He couldn’t seem to remember how to move for a moment, then he had the sense to wrap his arms around Dean’s shoulders, leaning into the kiss. Soft, warm lips, peppermint and cologne, gentle fingers under Cas’s suit jacket and over his white cotton shirt.
