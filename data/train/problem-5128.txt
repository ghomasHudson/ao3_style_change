what happens when, Castiel does not know. what he remembers is the warm rush of his brother’s blood all over his hands, spilling over him, his crumpling figure, Dean’s big green eyes staring at him, wide and round, and the sudden, deafening roar of screams and yelling and Dean’s whispered little “Cas”
(though Dean claims, after they have given their report to the other people by the campsite, trusted soldiers of the Winchesters, their personal guards ever since Dean was still resting in his mther’s womb, and after they have retreated into the biggest tent of them all (it is still not as big as Castiel’s back then, yet still shamefully reminiscient enough of it), that he knew Castiel would help. Dean says that even though he didn’t expect Castiel to go quite as far as he did, he had faith that he would aid Dean in some way, maybe with his escape, maybe by ensuring him a quick, painless death, so that he won’t be torn apart by all those men and their weapons, but gently put down by the hands that--... he doesn’t continue, although the sentiment is clear: ‘the hands that used to wash him’)
The Alpha crouches down in front of him, and there is nothing but benevolence in his gaze. Dean quickly tries to lower his own, but before his eyes are fixed to the ground, a warm and gentle hand cups his chin and slowly tilts it up. With his eyes wide and surely speaking of his fear, he is forced to look the Alpha in the eye.
“Y-yeah, alright. That’s,
Novak smiles at him, fully this time, and in what could be interpreted as fondness. “I hope you don’t just say that because you feel pressured to. If you don’t want to accept it, for whatever reason, Dean,” his voice dips low there, almost falling into a whisper, into something private, “then you don’t have to. I won’t feel offended, or be angry or be,” he pauses for just a second, “disappointed.”
And Dean breathes out heavily. He can’t help but think how this is an
he undresses slowly, without haste, for there is no need for any. with intent eyes, not averted in shame and an offering of modesty as Castiel had done, Dean watches him, watches each piece of clothing leave his body, expose it to him as Dean has had to expose his own, back when they were still hostile companions, imprisoned in their tent and waiting for a war, the only soothing touches with wet hands
Because he’s sated enough already. Despite Castiel’s show and the potential of another round, there’s no need for either. Or anything else. Because in this moment, there is nothing Dean could want for.
the play;
“I won’t,” Castiel agrees, with a breathless quality to his voice, a note of amazement. It seems so easy to make him happy – it’s as if he barely needs anything than a little truth and trust from Dean for him to be downright floored and smiling. It makes Dean wonder if he gives off that same impression whenever Castiel easily gives him what he needs. Or if he just comes across as a little desperate and easy, in contrast to how endearing Castiel seems.
“Dean,” Castiel repeats, slow and serious, “I
“Would you want to include the food more in our play?” Castiel shifts a bit where he sits, hunched over the breakfast table with nothing but two mugs of tea and a few sheets of papers – the List with a capital L – in front of him. “I admit that I do enjoy cooking for you and that I would like to expand on this.”
“But it was already difficult to, ah,” Castiel actually pauses at that, blinking away from Dean for the duration of his little pause, and when he looks back at Dean, there’s a soft red hue to his cheeks, “to leave our embrace.” And Christ, Dean joins him in his blushing at that, mortified. He doesn’t even want to know what their
Castiel’s eyes only wander for a moment, and it almost feels like a caress when his gaze sweeps over the features of Dean’s face and his shoulders and his vestment-clad body. “I do.”
But it still does not mean that he has made peace with his fate when the ceremony of the last and first day arrives at last. He cannot deny that there is a tremble to his hands when he passes the silver bowl filled with a thick golden liquid to the priestess, or that he feels as cold and lost as if he were already wading down the snowy mountain.
But when Dean takes what he
Why exactly he is crying and shaking, he couldn’t say. All that he knows is that there’s the pain from his ass and the arousing reassurance from Castiel’s hand on his neck and the warmth at those words that mixes with the heat, melting whatever was leaving him old and aching inside and flowing away.
“And if I don’t?” Dean teases. “Are you gonna spank me for it?”
Enraged and ashamed, he wants to get up and go, cover the proof of his failing with his clothes, and pray for forgiveness. But all he does is keep his eyes shut and his body strung tight, hoping for the onslaught of abuse that he rightly deserves.
“Then why did you do?”
However, behind him, Castiel does not push in any further, but lets out a displeased sound, something incredibly familiar for Dean by now.
“That really got to you, didn’t it?” Dean asks, but not mockingly or in any way to sneer at the somber look in Castiel’s eyes – he asks softly, curiously. Because this is weird, is what it is. For Castiel to be hurting so much about Dean, hurting. For him to care so much.
“Maybe,” he simply replies, squirming uncomfortably. There have been enough people who must have thought him
“Who asked you to do what you do?” Officer Novak asks in return, voice so fucking soft and soothing, it make Dean even madder. He’s not some unreasonable, angry teenager, he’s the son of a hero and the brother to a child. Not some small-time whore who wants new shoes. “Who asked you to risk your body and life on the streets? I could have been a serial killer for all you know, I could have seriously hurt you, and you seem more upset by me being police than a potential murderer. I don’t know why you do this or for whom, but I can’t imagine that either you nor anyone who cares about you could ever want this for you.” He doesn’t sound soothing anymore; pissed, more like.
There was a sudden lump in Dean’s throat. “You didn’t lose me, though. And you did prevent it.”
“Are there any rituals that you like to perform before or after a scene? This includes Aftercare as well.”
Because robes like these, silk and expensive threads, were not made for the likes of him. They shouldn’t be bulging over bellies that sick out or a way too meaty butt or upper arms that they will strain around. They were made for people like Castiel, flawless in personality and looks and his every action. People like him who, in another time and at another place, would have worn nothing but robes that were long and flowing and precious, becoming of him and immediately distinguishing him as royalty maybe or some successful merchant.
The suddenness of it and the way it’s delivered with an open expression makes the blood shoot right into Dean’s head, tints his cheeks and the tips of his ears pink and warms his lips. “Uh, thank you,” Dean mutters. There’s a tingle inside his stomach and down his neck, but he’s not quite sure whether it’s because he’s flattered or embarrassed, because he knows that he looks far from lovely right now. He looks exhausted, yes, and way too excited, maybe even a bit needy, but
For close to an hour now, Cas and him have been talking through all kinds of kinds, explaining what they would entail and which of them they would like to do to the other or have been done to them. And it has been a bit of a turn-on, to say the least. Castiel talking in explicit detail about what felching is and about all the ways he could go about coaxing his own come out of Dean, with his fingers and his tongue and various toys, has been almost too much for Dean and his chubbed up dick. He’s stammered out a Maybe on it and Castiel has noted it down as such, but his secret little smirk as he did so made it seem like he was well-aware of there being no Maybe about this. That Dean felt a definite Yes about Castiel lapping his own come out of Dean’s hole.
Castiel makes a sound that is a bit more than a snort but not quite a laugh and presses a quick kiss to the curve Dean’s cheekbone. “Are you not as sad anymore?”
bear the consequences. You will clean every filthy drop out of me until your tongue and jaw hurt, and then I will ride you until you are hard and writhing again, only this time, you won’t get to come. Neither the time after. You will cry and you will beg, but you will also know that if all you receive is my cock in your mouth and yours in a lock, that is already more than what you deserve. And all you will receive until you have learned to behave yourself better. Until you have learned to obey me and fuck me and don’t come until I tell you to.” He clenches again, tightly and inexorably, and he can feel his muscles drag over Dean throbbing cock, feeling bigger and bigger with each helpless thrust and heavy intake of breath, and Dean has never even had a chance.
“That’s not why I–”
“Even these days, I can’t look at you, let lone work alongside you, without wanting to put my hands all over you.” Castiel growls out his confession right as Dean gasps, “Seventeen!”
Castiel, for his part, seems to pick up on it, too. Which is probably easier than it should be, what with the man he just spend the better part of the evening lavishing with attention still stands in front of him, naked and bearing his semen, clutching his clothing and taking a step back.
Dean clenches his eyes shut for a moment and feels like pinching his nose, although he prefers to keep his hands resting on Castiel’s softly raising and lowering chest instead. He sighs. For some reason, Castiel’s words make him feel distant. He likes what Castiel did, that he has started to hold him and taken care of him, and Dean wishes Castiel finally accepted that he trusts him. That he wouldn’t have allowed Castiel any of the things he has already done otherwise. That it’s a sign of faith. “The sheet is just fine. I can barely feel it on my ass. And I believe you. I know you wouldn’t do anything ‘inappropriate’ unless I told you to – even if I already told you to.”
Dean was proud of his little joke by the end there, but Castiel did not laugh. Did not even chuckle, that bastard. Instead, he made a contemplative noise as he listened and thought Dean’s words over again.
“Good evening, Mr. Novak,” Dean obediently croaks back, probably more than a beat too slow, and at his side, Jo giggles. Dean makes an attempt for glare at her for it, but she looks far from being cowed.
“Fifteen!”
Because the one he and his inner Alpha recognize as something more than an affair or a friend, the one he dares to cast into the light of a mate with tentative hope in his heart, is in distress. Despite Castiel’s attempts to comfort him. More specifically,
“I would usually clean myself up and get out of there. No reason to stay if the scene’s over and I wasn’t needed anymore, right?” He laughs, and he expects to sound bitter, but he just sounds broken. “Most of the Doms I picked up on the internet or some random clubs, so there was no obligation for them to go up and beyond and take care of me or whatever, so, yeah, I don’t know. I sincerely don’t know what I’d like to do for Aftercare.”
Dean has been single for so long that it’s completely unexpected when he actually manages to win the new guy from next door, Castiel, for himself. Honestly, Dean’s over the moon and grinning like a sap all day, because not only is Castiel beyond attractive, he’s also really funny and kind and always has something nice to say about Dean whenever they meet. And Dean can only stammer and blush and try not to look like a complete egghead whenever he compliments him again.
and this is how it evolves betwen them throughout it all; Dean is under Castiel’s personal protection, his charge as much as his victim, and they spend all that time of waiting with each other. Dean with his hands and feet bound, Cas with his tongue tied, and both of them looking forward to the end of this, however it may turn out. Dean often likens himself to a pet, forced to stay in Castiel’s tent and to entertain him, and Castiel supposed that assessment is not entirely inaccurate. after all, Dean does provide him with entertainment and some touches and the honesty of someone who has no choice but to be honest (from some point on). yet, he is also much more than that, more than an animal, because he is intelligent and insightful and proud and brash and vulnerable sometimes, and much more a companion, an equal, than a domesticated beast. (not least because Castiel is sure that Dean is the kind of beast that could never be domesticated.)
pure and smile. The basest of things, just the thought of, ‘Why do you have what I don’t?’, and as soon as Dean realizes what it is, it’s already gone again.
“Dean,” Castiel’s gentle voice lures him out of his thoughts, and without Dean really noticing, he’s squatted down in front of him, in his ridiculous blue polka dot pajamas, and looks up at him with big, blue, concerned eyes. “You understand that, right? That I only want to give you space and that I do not now nor ever will look down on you for what you did to keep yourself and your brother safe and fed?”
It hurts Cas. Because he wants to be there for Dean whenever he needs him to and he wishes Dean would know that, no matter his troubles, he will always have a friend and confidant in him.
“’re you preparing breakfast?” comes Castiel’s sleep-ridden voice from the kitchen door.
Castiel snort-laughs and presses one last kiss to Dean’s lips. “If that’s the case, then I will bring some paper towels for us to clean up and we will leave in an hour at the latest.”
“There is nothing for you to be sorry for.”
has treated him to, insisted on paying as a thanks for accepting his invitation, as a promise of more to come. More caring, more caretaking, more–
-on top of him, of course – he did not press his body up against his, like some sexual fiend. No, all he did was try to lie down next to Castiel, and lied down on his arm and part of his thigh instead, though he tried to minimize the contact. However, he was apparently the only one interested in doing so because, despite their awkward positioning, Castiel made no move to withdraw from him and instead stayed rooted where he was, all spread out.
Dean shifts, or he tries to, in the incessant hold of his Alpha. “What do you mean?” he asks, and is ashamed by how weak his voice sounds.
Dean makes a soft, needy sound and squirms on top of Castiel in a way that makes it difficult to pinpoint whether the haze in Castiel’s mind stems from the alcohol or the warm proxomity to Dean anymore. Whatever it may be, the confusion about it is not enough to have Castiel move his hands – they stay right where they are, cupping the slightly wiggling and opulent butt, keeping themselves still.
“That’s right, your reward. Because you wanted to show me how much you can take, and you did. Because you were honest with me about your desires when we talked about any of this, which is the only thing that allowed us to be where we are right now. Because you entrusted yourself into my hands and had me enjoy myself due to the pleasure of having such faith put in me and also due to the beautiful picture that you painted.” Dean can hear the wet sound of Castiel licking his lips. “I can assure you that the image of you on my lap, counting out the numbers and looking so gorgeous for me while I am allowed to spank your perfect behind is something I will forever cherish.”
“Six!” he yells, and without quite meaning to, he finds himself with his fingers grasping at one side of the sofa and at Castiel’s shirt, the cotton warm and yielding under his hand, and even more so when Dean scratches against the nipple hidden beneath it and pulls Castiel even closer.
“I’m fine with that,” Dean says and tries to put as much ‘I am more inclined to go with Yes’ encouragement into the nod that follows. “I’ll, uh, try to be as quick as I can.”
with him.
“You know that Sam is only concerned for you,” Castiel murmurs, hoping that it won’t re-ignite Dean’s anger but help him see. “He is the first to notice if anything is wrong with you, and when he sees how tense you have been the last few days, of course he would try to talk to you about it.”
And at first, Dean often enough rode a high during the scenes, enjoyed being dominated and being made to feel useful, that he didn't bother or dare question what happened to him. What were a few tears of untended to pain or a week of shame compared to the feeling of being strung up and worked over so well that whatever else might have come afterwards was just as forgotten as any other worry or pain within him? What use would it have been to struggle or squirm at those few things that he did not enjoy, that made him uncomfortable? He enjoyed it all the same; unless, sometimes, he didn't.
Castiel almost looks like a little boy at those words, at this little necessary interlude and confirmation. Then, he nods a few times, and with every nod, he loses a bit of his boyish charm and becomes more like before again, like a strict and fair Dom, someone who knows himself and how to take care of a willing submissive like Dean.
“Yes, it did. I mean it when I say that I want you to make you feel good. During or after a scene, it doesn’t matter. I cherish you as a person as much as–
Dean snorts, then looks down on the haphazardly shoved aside tablet and the still ruffled sheets. He already feels homely here, welcomed in a way that he hasn’t felt again since after he has moved out of his parents’ house. Maybe it’s because of the really soft sheets.
Only then does Dean notice that they must have moved during their kissing. So slowly, probably, that they weren’t even aware of it. But they must have, because Dean can’t remember them being in this position, with his body lying along the length of the sofa, legs stretched out so far that his shoes almost reach the edge of the seating surface. And with Castiel above him still, but his arms to either side of Dean’s face now, boxing him in, whereas their lower bodies are somewhere between connected and hovering, just close enough for both of them to be able to feel just how good what they are doing feels to the other. And just like this, all of this seems familiar already.
So, with the courage that comes with the alcohol and a lingering, if wearing off fear for Dean, Castiel decides to make use of his ‘knowledge’ once more.
“And as we have now settled this and are still on the topic of working together, I wonder if you were amenable to me helping you out with your outstanding work duties now? After all, not only did I indirectly negatively affect your working performance during the week, but also very much directly kept you from completing your tasks this evening.”
For a second there, Dean wonders if maybe Novak has truly seen through him and his bullshit and his lemon water and decided to send him home, after all. That maybe time spent alone with two burgers is still better spent than with some self-deprecating, chubby loser. But what actually comes out of Novak’s mouth once he opens it again is pretty much the opposite from what Dean expects
“I believe you,” Novak states, “and that’s what worries me. If you won’t speak, my colleagues will do everything they can do find out what you won’t tell them. Then, depending on your true age, you will either have to face high charges or jailtime, or, if you’re young enough, your legal guardian will be tracked down and sued for allowing a kid to prostitute himself. You will probably go into foster care and be separated from any possible remaining family.”
“You okay there, babe?” Dean murmurs so sweetly and sleepily that Castiel simply has to catch his lips in yet another short kiss. It is a peck more than anything else, for Castiel fears that he might not be able to hold himself back again if he received yet another proper taste.
Which seems to be in agreement so far, as there’s smiley faces in all of the boxes. There’s even a tiny heart drawn next to Spanking.
“Heh.” Dean leans into the hands that cup his face, allows Cas’ lips to wander from his nose to his mouth to his jaw and down below, where his skin is loose and pudgy, where his chin is soft and jiggly. “Show me, then.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean half-whines because he knows he should be embarrassed by how needy and easy he is.
The spike of arousal that follows is acute and overwhelming. Dean’s been asked to be a play partner many times before, but never for longer than a couple of times, never in this way. Castiel already has him; there’s no need for him to say all of these things retrospectively, to make Dean feel good and desirable about himself. Yet, he does. And that look on his face, like he wants to devour Dean right on the spot, makes Dean wonder if there’s any pretense to this at all, if Castiel’s isn’t actually unbridledly honest with him.
Just as inelegantly as he had climbed onto the bed, he attempted to roll off of it. But before he could quite get up and leave the moody angel behind, there were hands grappling at his shoulder and hips, pulling him right back.
Dean curls his fingers into the soft and probably impossibly expensive cloth around his shoulders, pulling it tighter around his still-sullied body. “I know,” in a voice that is neither sulking nor annoyed, just small.
“Oh, thank you, Dean. You are so good for me,” Castiel praises him breathlessly, making Dean reflexively tighten up for a moment, and then loosen up again, obviously even more so than before because Castiel slides even deeper into him, panting now. “Just like that, Dean.
“I wanted to see you,” Castiel breathes out honestly, and it takes all of him not to shudder on the exhale. The scent of Dean, his proximity, his fluttering pulse and deliciously warm skin under his fingers, all of it is already overwhelming him again, rendering him useless and
Which was an unexpected turn of events, if Dean had ever experienced one, and he had actually experienced many. But, true to his own words, he should focus on what was in front of him. What had, in fact, been in front of him for a whole damn while now, he had just been too chickenshit to reach out for it.
Castiel cards through Dean’s hair, once, twice, and it’s tender how he does it, but there’s a promise in there, in how he doesn’t catch every strand just softly, but sometimes lets them tug against Dean’s scalp, lets him know that the tides could turn if Castiel wanted to, that there is something beyond the gentleness waiting on Dean, should he not follow his commands.
The first time it happens, it is an accident.
as little as he understands when Dean shamelessly undresses in front of him -- as dim as the light in the tent may be --, just shucking off his clothes, baring himself completely where Castiel couldn’t help but see and then leisurely putting on his night clothes. Castiel stands frozen by the flap of the door, watching for unwelcome visitors who are not to see Dean like this -- a remaint of before, maybe -- and at the same time trying not to look himself, not to let his eyes roam over the becoming body that has lost so much of the softness since he has last seen it, has become harder and only more vulnerable with war and hunger
“I’m glad,” Novak says, and he doesn’t sound as dangerously low now anymore, but more like himself. Business-like, maybe, but still not as much as usually. He’s obviously not quite done yet, because he continues in that tone that’s seriousness clad in a fake casual tone. “Which reminds me. You probably know better than I do that I have no further responsibilities this evening, that I can leave early. Unless you are here to bear bad news, that is.” They exchange tired little smiles at his joke, and the humanity of it is grounding. “If you don’t mind me asking, I was wondering whether you will be free as well, and if so, whether you would like to accompany me for dinner tonight.”
everyone but Dean, Castiel thinks bitterly, but he doesn’t say so. not because of fear or because of the disappointment and feeling of disillusionment that has had more than enough time to settle in the many months of the war. it is because he already knows that this won’t what will happen; that he won’t let it happen. he has long given up on caring about the war or his country and especially about Michael, but he won’t fail the last thing he cares about. not if it costs his life, or that of anyone else. what worth is there to either him or Michael anyway? not one higher than Dean’s could ever be
Because regardless of what Dean’s mouth says, the tremors running through his body and the frenetic clenching of his hole say something else entirely. “Sorry, it’s just-- I’m-- I just needed a second.” They have waited long enough, after all, and he wants to make this good for Cas, no matter how much it hurts right now. It will feel better in a bit, he remembers as much, so he would rather just grin and bear it until it becomes pleasurable, instead of having Castiel pull away entirely. “It’s fine, now. I’m good. Just-- just keep going.”
“Hey, Jo,” he smiles despite his nerves. “Uhm, did–”
“Okay.”
It seems secure.
But beyond that, other things were waiting on him, too. Namely, the dinner they had arranged. After sending some messages back and forth, they had both decided to meet the next weekend for dinner again – but this time, not in a public place with nosy and bratty employees, but privately. And as the idea of letting Castiel into his apartment just yet didn’t sit entirely right with Dean for some reason, he was quick to accept Castiel’s cautious invitation to come over and meet at his place instead. Have Castiel cook for him.
his attempts to comfort him – among other things. Castiel is the source of Dean’s distress, adding to the already confusing situation with vague words and conflicting propositions, and he needs to do something about it. Come clear, as some would say. It is the least Dean deserves, and probably the thing that he needs most right now.
Knowing that nothing bad will happen, Dean smiles a little smile of his own, nuzzles his nose into Castiel’s neck and lets his sleepy eyes fall shut.
“Yes, sir.”
in wonder,” Castiel confirms, and Dean feels great shame and terror come over him when that hand strokes over his cheek with a reverence that should be reserved for a king.
they flee for however long it takes, until they reach a campsite that doesn’t look familiar, that is shrouded in colours and linen that are not of this kingdom, and Dean grins at him through the darkness, victorious and beautiful, and without hesitation, leads him right into it, to the fire
And Castiel just shushes him and presses his lips against Dean’s, stealing a few reassuring little kisses amidst the deeply intentional grinding their crotches are now doing against each other. There’s a goal there that is needs to be chased already, that they finally are chasing, after a week of needless distance and cool skin.
The tip of Castiel’s tongue darts out, but only so briefly that Dean has to wonder whether it was intentional or just a byproduct of Castiel wetting his lips. “And I will. I will take you home and tend to you and afterwards assure that you will get all of what you need. This time, at last. I have learnt from this and I will not let you down a second time. I promise you, Dean.”
for, and he yelps and yells and feels tears of joy welling up in his eyes as Castiel tongue returns back to where it belongs.
were not that important. That Dean himself wasn't that important, either.
Castiel sighs, but still keeps on petting him. “Then I would kindly ask you not to call me ‘dude’ while I am penetrating you, either.”
“Heh,” Dean begins, and it’s hard to keep a pokerface when Castiel is keeping a pokerface of his own at all times, no matter how innocently ridiculous it is what he says. In the morning after their first scene, Castiel set a big mug with a grumpy-looking cat – that beared an uncanny resemblance to Castiel – right in front of Dean, looked him straight in the eye and said, ‘This is my favourite,’ and proceeded making breakfast, leaving Dean to his offered mug.
The heat that blooms within Castiel’s chest upon this realization almost wants him to take Dean back to bed, just not for sleep, and to enjoy him in this utterly vulnerable and incredibly beautiful state, in which he is conscious enough to consent, but not enough to even attempt to put up a barrier. Not that he does so often with Castiel, not anymore. Still, for Castiel not even having to coax him into letting his guard down, to instead just receive Dean’s sweet sighs and open kisses like this, must be the greatest gift he has received tonight.
There’s silence. Inside Officer Novak’s office, and the voices and low-key mumbling outside have ceased as well.
“There’s nothing, really.”
And with those words being spoken low and intimate, their lips find each other again, warm and leisurely, more a slow re-exploration than anything else. Dean closes his eyes and just forgets about those doubts he voiced himself, thinks of nothing but the dry press of lips and the tease of a tongue that won’t follow through.
Castiel closes his eyes for a moment and presses his lips against each other, in what looks like a moment of grappling for calm, because this – this is just embarrassing, for both of them. Though whereas Castiel looks like he is trying to rein himself him in order not to overstep any unspoken boundaries and speak out of line, Dean stiffens his lips and posture to hold off the heat and delight and incredulity. Because Castiel sounds like he has actually thought about this, about
much could be said about the thousands of lives being taken, about the streets littered with bodies, about the loss of hope and faith and to an end to it all. because
“How are you feeling?” Castiel asks in a voice so low and quiet that Dean can only hear it because Castiel’s lips are brushing right up against the tip of his ear, speaking directly into it. The shiver that comes along with it settles deep in Dean’s bones, goes beyond the physical sensation of it.
doesn’t sound like a joke or an attempt to mock Dean at all; more like Castiel’s truth embedded in a command, like he told Dean to see it as.
The way Castiel’s face blossoms into the most beautiful of smiles, all proud and happy, curved up lips and crinkly eyes and scrunchy nose, makes Dean instantly forget about his worry and the anxiety from talking about the list, makes everything worth it.
“Understood,” Castiel says, and ticks off another box. But, from what Dean can see, there’s another indented line right beneath the roleplaying one, and it has Castiel’s face losing its humour and turning serious, almost stony.
It’s enough to make Dean’s mouth water, all of him still abuzz with his own relief and a growing anticipation, and he follows Castiel down, presses his chest against Castiel’s, their nipples rubbing up against each other, and whimpers out a soft, “Please, use me.”
“No, I’m–” Dean begins to protest, and he begins another attempt to wind his body away to flee not those kisses, but those words.
“No,” Castiel replies slowly and with his forehead and nose scrunched up. Loose little feathers whirl around him and get stuck in his hair. “The bedroom will belong to you and Sam for the time being, until we move into a bigger place. I didn’t think it appropriate for me to sleep in the same bed with you, nor did I assume that you could possibly want that.”
show you my adoration and everything you are deserving of.”
He doesn’t tell John. Not because his mom told him not to, but because he hadn’t intended to do so from the get-go. As an ex-marine and all around self-perceived men’s man, Dean has no doubt John would come all the way from Kansas to thrash him if he knew, or at least disown him. He’d certainly never talk to him again either way.
“Twenty,
And Dean might be shaking and shuddering and breaking apart of the seams, but that’s not all there is, not all he feels. There is still Castiel, swallowing his come and moaning around his cock as if doing so was a real treat, and it only keeps Dean going and reminds him of how there is more to this. Not just
It’s so easy, almost shockingly so.
“I have watched you, beloved, I have listened to you for years,” Castiel breathes warmly against the skin of Dean’s neck, and the Omega shudders. “All your prayers and pleas, your honest and hidden words, and your confessions. I have wanted to meet you, to embrace you in the way you are deserving of, chase away the darkness that my very own followers have brought upon you. But I trusted you to take care of yourself until I could. Until I could worship you.” Castiel’s hand clenches at Dean’s neck, in an imitation of a mating bite, and Dean feels his body respond with warmth and the need to submit and with a flood of feelings of safety and adoration. “I have waited, and at last,” Castiel mouths against Dean’s neck, and Dean is ashamed to admit that he grows aroused beneath his robes. And that is when Castiel presses even closer, cradles Dean’s body against his chest, as if he not only knew of Dean’s arousal, but also wanted it for himself. “You are finally of age, and it is time for me to claim you.”
so beautiful. Whatever noise you make and whatever you say,
This is not true for Dean, though; his whole family burnt alongside his home, and he only entered the temple because the priestess was kind enough to take in an Omega so young that he had just presented, instead of condemning him to serve the travelers and farmers in the Red House no one pretends to know of.
“No, I want– to touch your cock.” His embarrassment almost compels him to be silent again, to just take what Castiel gives him right now, what is good and nice, yet not enough. “I’ve never really seen it before and I wanna– I wanna touch it and maybe, ah, taste it. You know. I want to suck you off. Swallow you down and have you, uhm,” he licks his lips, unsure and strung tight with need, “come down my throat.”
Castiel gets the next thrust in, but Dean fucks up right after, the friction as ecstatic as the tightness, as the heat, as the way their eyes meet, wide and wild, open in wonder and lust, searching to share their every sensation.
“–kittens, yes, I know,” Dean hastily intervenes, fighting against that hot swell in his chest and what feels like panic but might also be something else that gets his pulse racing. “You, uh, you actually sent me a short video of the kittens. I think that was when you were on a business trip a few weeks ago, and you probably were drunk or anything, but, uhm. I got your video.”
Dean’s stomach drops.
"It pains me that you would consider this anything but the truth. That I could not show you how much I adore you before, that any tenderness was taken from you in those years when you needed it the most." There is an underlying growl in his voice, and Dean does not need to see to know from the gasps behind himself that Castiel must be glaring at his other followers.
Dean easily goes with the movement of Castiel’s lips, hands, and hips, just takes whatever Castiel gives him, what both of them have been craving for weeks now. Having Castiel’s cock inside him does not ache anymore by now, it just feels big and hard in that relentlessly owning way that Dean loves about being fucked by men, and especially by Cas. Because he knows that he really does belongs to Cas, in the same way that Cas belongs to him.That they have branded each other for their entire existence, given each other their all, their everything. So, to have Castiel fill such a vulnerable part of Dean with himself, to reach into him so deeply and make him feel
“That is possible. If I have never mentioned it before, it probably would have been because I didn’t wish to make you feel uncomfortable.” Castiel noses along the line of Dean’s jaw, but doesn’t do much more than that, and he makes sure to keep eye contact with Dean. “Because I do think about touching you at all times. Even the inappropriate times – no, especially the inappropriate times.” He presses a tiny kiss to the bolt of Dean’s jaw and sighs sweetly.
Castiel chuckles at that, puts a kiss to his forehead and asks, “Alright?”
“But that would presuppose that you accept me as your Dom, of course,” Castiel says with an air of non-chalance of which Dean doesn’t know whether it’s fake or not, but which doesn’t leave much pressure on Dean.
“Do I have to spell it out for you?” Dean grunts out, and his cheeks look more flaming, even richer in their colour. “Keep squeezing my ass.”
Staying as he is, the demon breathes in and out deeply, puffing against Castiel’s skin. Castiel stays tense for a few minutes, bracing himself for the sickening yet deeply-craved touches, the shift into more familiar terrain, of a differently dangerous kind. Something he could repel the demon for, or maybe accept.
Dean leans forward a bit, and he can see that the six boxes are in fact for only three of the rows and set in two different columns. On top of both columns is something written in red ink, and only now does Dean get what they are and what they are for: on top of the columns are their names, written in Castiel’s familiar scrawl, and the rows are kinks or whatever else there might be. Kissing, Spanking, Comeplay, all three of them ticked with small smiley faces in the boxes. Showing their preferences, their approval – of not just Castiel and what he wants, but also of Dean. Of what
, not as an angel. Without you, things might’ve gone downhill. Or they might’ve not. Who knows, maybe Sammy would’ve saved me.”
Which is why, without thinking and while still drawing big, warm circles on Dean’s back, Castiel’s hand slips a little lower, over the small of his back and then, unintentionally, over the beautiful curve of his behind.
Then again, with every piece of clothing that Dean is now starting to put off and carefully folding and setting down on the bed, he is thankful that he will be able -- or allowed -- to put on this robe, at least. No matter how much it will be bulging and displaying every dip and inch of his body in the least merciful ways. Because he can’t even imagine strutting out there, back into the living room, all bare and exposed, jiggly and vulnerable fr Castiel’s eye.
“Green,” he says, somewhere between a hush and a solid statement.
for me, my goddamn best friend, only you can have me, and--
Being scared with each other; being scared by themselves.
Dean considers him in a long silence and in nothing but the weak shine of the oil lamp, his eyes thoughtful, distraught, but not surprised. and how could he be, after he had opted to do the same, after all? their intentions were much the same -- Dean with too much to care for, so that he would give his own life; Castiel with too little to care for except one thing, so that he would give his own life -- and yet, neither had expected the other. couldn’t have. and still, Castiel is certain that, as much as he didn’t, Dean didn’t feel alone back there, in front of the priest, facing not just a clerk, but death. and not fearful. despite not knowing they did, they trusted each other, drew courage from it, and then acted
"Yeah?” Dean asks, unable to stop himself from grinning and his pulse from picking up a beat. He’s waited for this for far too long. “Are you finally gonna punish me for being a bad boy? Show me what’s in store for me if I’m not good?" Dean wiggles his butt a little where he’s sitting on his chair, probably looking like a kid that’s way too excited on Christmas morning.
He almost sends him his answer that very evening, while his skin is still thrumming with the soft caress goodbye that Castiel gave him, just an easy cupping of his cheek, accompanied by a low and pleasant, “Goodnight, Dean.”
“I don’t need to get an idea of what I would like to do with you, Dean Smith. I have more than enough of these already.”
. And stay there. For good.”
With his unoccupied hand, Castiel fumbles at first at Dean’s fly and then at his own, freeing their flushed and dripping erections from the confines of their pants, with little sighs ghosting over both their lips.
This is stupid, Dean thinks. Their scene wasn’t even a real scene, not like he’s been used to. There was barely any pain and all around just a lot of kisses and embraces and him getting rimmed. Of course, Castiel couldn’t have known that Dean would feel bad about himself after being goddamn showered with affection instead of being beaten or anything, like any normal person wouldn’t have to expect. Castiel at least kept in contact and tried to find some time for him, despite his busy schedule, and just somehow… somehow, it still wasn’t enough. Not enough attention and paperming, for some as
At that, Dean can’t help but to actually laugh a bit. “I would’ve thought you’d like making me laugh.”
exactly like that.”
– eat me out properly.”
and fucking
“Alright,” Dean reassures.
Whereas before, whenever he woke up during the night for a few moments, he easily fell asleep again thanks to the weight and warmth of Castiel around or even half-way on top of him, and then, over the course of the night, they found the comfiest position in Castiel pressed up against Dean’s back and with his arms around him, both of them on the side, Dean’s butt against the soft curve of Castiel’s crotch and belly, there’s a distinct lack of that now. There’s no arms around Dean and no thigh pressed between his, no hand cupping his tummy or resting on his heart. Just Dean and the sheets. Or so it seems.
“Yes. With me.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Castiel lies badly and with a flush of his own.
So, instead of lying and saying that he already does or instead of speaking the truth and risking to sadden his Dom, Dean just nods. “I keep my promises. Also, I told you not to worry and that it wasn’t even that bad. Sure, I didn’t feel too well, or maybe a bit worse than that, but it would have been bearable.”
Dean would like to say that he’s wiser than this, that if Castiel hadn’t come to take care of him in the end, he would have been dead to him. The truth is, Dean probably still would have given in to him again anyway, the next time Castiel would have come knocking. Even though Dean knows he might drop indeed – and only now is he able to see that yeah, Castiel has been right, he was with one foot in a sub-drop – and even though he has promised himself to never let himself be treated like this again, Dean isn’t sure he could be able to resist Castiel completely. Because it’s not just a leather belt and a hard hand that he is being offered by him, but hope and kind words to go along with it, to soothe him all the way through it, and always open arms.
But the first time he actually made his way to the precinct instead of the backseat of the car.
woo you.”
Because instead of maybe brushing Dean’s hands off of him, denying him the pleasure of physical contact that Castiel knows him to be so starving for, and instead of maybe saying words of an equally as unfair manner, Castiel reaches for him. He puts one of his hands on Dean’s shoulder, in a familiar and hopefully distracting way, and the other on one of Dean’s soft sides.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and fought against the urge to kiss that teasing finger. “Not exactly what I meant, but yeah.”
His breath hitches.
“Dean?” Jo implores, and she sounds a bit impatient already.
But Novak just looks at him, silently, in that way that makes Dean feel vulnerable and transparent – as if his biggest fear, his biggest shame, was laid open. As if he could see the actual truth, hidden behind excuses and hard work and many smiles. And yet, Dean feels, that if there is one person who he could probably trust with scratching him open and laying him bare, with looking behind all of Dean’s bullshit and actually dealing with it, it would probably be Novak.
“Thank you very much, Dean. I will work hard to give you reason to build on that trust and for me to remain ‘the best’.” Castiel sounds as lame as he does adorable. Possibly even a hint proud.
“Are you really?” Castiel probes, because honestly, Dean wouldn’t believe himself either. The way he’s averting his gaze and wringing his hands might be a bit of a give-away. But just a bit.
It is very endearing, particularly so because even though Dean may not be as terse and short-fused anymore, he still won’t meet Castiel’s eyes without his own flitting away and without all of him tensing and fidgeting. So, it’s a nice change of pace to see Dean so happy and relaxed again, and to see his belly swollen and full with all the delicious food he treated himself to.
It’s only after Castiel seems to have truly ridden out his orgasm that his hold on Dean eases, although he still keeps his hands where they are, letting them caress his hair and thigh softly, soothingly.
Dean moans, short and shy, but no less passionate for it, and Castiel laughs kindly.
“You say you are not interested in any other play partners at the moment – and so am I.” He takes a deep breath. “So, if both of us want to be exclusive, why don’t you prove it? That I am your–
right there, waiting on him. That the neat edges of the wrapping paper and whatever small thing inside are for him to unpack, reveal, and were probably waiting on him to do so.
It might be a bit strange, for them to still let their negotiation slash dirty talk seep into the play, instead of just letting go and going with the scene, but for some reason, it helps Dean, eases his mind. Sure, like this, grounded in reason, it’s rather difficult for him to float away like he wants to. But he’s not sure if he could even give into it like that if they weren’t walking that uncommon line. He trusts Castiel, he does, but as much as Dean wants to allow him to just let that good feeling wash over him until he’s all out in the open, away from that self-conscious shore, he would be afraid to. It’s good like this; with Castiel as his lifeline, letting him go with the flow for some time, enjoy himself, and then pulling him back in, into steady hands and rational words, into a reminder of that going further doesn’t mean going too far, doesn’t mean they can’t reach their destination a single step at a time.
It’s when Dean blinks up to see the priestess looking at him, in a calmness that rests in itself and with no guilt and no pleasure to speak of, and when she then sinks back down into her position of worship, not just before Castiel, but also before the Omega who is so intimately and possesively held, that the Alphas’s words sink in. That Castiel just declared Dean to be the one he desires to be mated to, that it is not a claim spoken lightly, but one he has been waiting to make for years. This powerful Alpha just condemned the action of his own people and stated that this shunned and humbled Omega was who he considered his own for so long now?
But not today and not right now. What he wants now is for Castiel to go on and relieve him from the sweet ache of arousal. After all, not being allowed to grind his cock against Castiel as he spanked him only made him harder and wetter. More
“Alright,” Dean play-sighs, in an attempt to cover up the little thrill that is running through him at the thought of tackling the same issue alongside Castiel. Shoulder to shoulder. “I guess if he keeps me from doing the work I am supposed to do for you, then he is a bother to both of us anyway.”
maybe, Dean would
feel vulnerable.
thanks to me, and how much pleasure you could still receive.”
And Dean, Dean dares to take the same comfort that his brother does – he presses a little kiss to Sam’s forehead, taking in his slow and quiet breathing, a sure sign of him being alive and safe, and then snuggles himself even deeper into the embrace of the man behind him.
And Cas swallows each of Dean’s little moans and pleas, kissing him in fast succession when he is the one who can’t but moan and call out for Dean.
And holy shit, Dean totally agrees there. So does his dick, if that little twitch in his pajama pants is anything to go by. “Yeah, I– I really liked it, too.” He takes a deep breath. No receiving without properly asking for it. “A lot, actually. I wouldn’t mind if we did that again. Maybe with me, uhm, over your desk or lap or something. Like, if you’re into that.”
“Green.”
It has him coming back for more.
me. Can you do that, Dean? Behave and be a good boy for me?”
Dean.
“Trusted me so well and let me do what he talked about and mm–” Castiel closes his eyes for a moment, a shiver wrecking his body, and when his gaze is open and focused on Dean’s face again, the hand on his cock moves even faster. His other hand fumbles for Dean’s green tie, but doesn’t tug on it, just touches it, strokes over it and Dean’s tight nipples next to it. “Did what I asked you to, while I got to taste you and –
He doesn’t even know what; just that little something. An indulgence to his newfound addiction; a little less loneliness.
They walk down the street, towards where it’s even darker and lonelier, and Dean knows he should turn around and
So he grumbles, “Shut up, Jo.”
“that, and I found myself thinking about how I
“Hello, Dean!” Jo greets him with a big grin while sauntering out from behind the counter. Dean feels himself lose a bit of the tension with which he knows he must have been carrying himself ever since he left the office – at least one friendly face.
about Dean when he isn’t by his side, and not only that, he also thinks his fantasies through enough for him to come to the conclusion that acting them out will come with consequences that he needs to prepare for, like an aching butt. It’s unexpectedly... sweet. That Castiel seems to jerk off to fantasies starring him and that even then, he doesn’t let go of his Dom persona -- or more like, Dom nature. He still cares.
“Then why the fuck did I get it in the first place? Why are you even here, then?“
“So much more, Dean,” Castiel whispers, sounding strangled, and then he cups Dean’s flaming butt cheeks with both his hands and presses a soft kiss to the back of Dean’s trembling neck.
And only sneaks his hand forward, somewhere between them.
“For my office?”
“You’re not gonna share with us?”
Dean feels sick to his stomach, but instead of protesting or telling the john to unlock the doors or maybe finally knocking him out and making a run for it, he asks in a voice that he wills to be not as small as he feels, “So, where exactly are we headed?”
Deciding to be honest, Dean drops his gaze towards the vicinity of Castiel’s jaw and proceeds, “I like that it’s only one. A special one. You know, just for me and by you and–” He knows his face must already be pink from just that little bit of talking, “and I’m sure you know what I mean.”
The fingers all over his cheeks and neck are immediate, as is the smile that lightens up all of Castiel’s face.
“You are always good, Dean,” Castiel whispers against his cheeks, returning with his lips and a trail of kisses, back to the warm and waiting center. “You’re simply not always a
Dean grins to himself, confidence bolstered by Castiel and his laughter and his everything, so he teases, “But only if you finally give me that aloe lotion you bought for me.”
“‘kay,” Dean accepts on the tail-end of a yawn.
Dean notices the patient gaze on him, one that must have been resting on him for however long his little inner monologue has lasted. But Novak doesn’t seem annoyed or anything, just as relaxed as before. Still, he gently leads Dean back towards what he originally came for when he asks, “So, what are my appointments for the day?”
Apparently, though, he is not alone in his longing.
“Yea-- yes, sir. Let me show you. Want to show. Want to see.”
…that is, in Dean's fantasies. In his dirty little daydreams about his boss. Because really, that Novak would be like that, an attentive, dominant lover, is not a thing he could know (except he thinks he does), but more than that, it’s not a thing he will ever get to experience. Because he left the Scene; because someone like Castiel Novak would have no business to be interested in the likes of him. He is nothing but his personal assistant now, a nobody. And even back then, he was nothing but a weak little sub that couldn’t truly like what was being done to him, and yet didn’t even speak up against it, only completely turned tail once it became too much, with trembling hands and a longing heart.
And Dean wouldn’t know which reasons Castiel would even have to lie about this to him, because hey, if Castiel did indeed feel neglected, he probably would come out and say it instead of taking things as they are and even soothing Dean’s doubts about it. There’s nothing in it for Castiel if he did lie – and it’s one of the reasons that convinces Dean to believe him. Not the only one, though; pretty much all of the other reasons are solely based on knowledge and experience about Castiel as a person. Of both of which he has gained his fair share of while being a personal assistant as well as a tentative friend for Castiel.
Somehow, they have managed to get their clothes off without looking at each other (or at least, Dean was pointedly not looking at Cas, he doesn’t know what Cas might have been doing) and gotten in the tub in much the same decent way. But despite the modesty up until then, it’s difficult to ignore another person if they are sitting right in front of you in a tiny and wet space, with them naked and glistening, their legs obscenely crossed whereas Dean has drawn his to his body, and their skin touching Dean’s irregularly. Dean shivers with any touch each time, hears his own breath catch and sees the goosebumps rising on his skin, and he’s afraid Cas must pick up on his reactions, must see them, too. If he does, he doesn’t comment on them. Instead, he lathers up his arms and chest, and just hums to himself, low and without any discernable rhythm. Dean knows that Cas loves taking baths, and it’s kind of—
huh?”
Dean allows him to fondle him freely, and he even gets used to it so much and so quickly that he misses Castiel’s touch when he lets go of him again and reaches even higher, to the knot of the bathrobe’s belt, the only thing helping Dean stay covered, the only barrier left between them.
It’s too addicting.
“Yes, sir.”
Castiel, graciously, doesn’t keep probing, but just remains still for a moment, and the way he must be shifting and turning the thoughts in his head is almost palpable, tense. Dean wonders if he will call him out on his shit again, tell him that he is not supposed to be lying about his well-being, just like he promised to.
, how absolutely, mindblowingly
close-mouthed and soft. With nothing but small presses of their lips and warm breath hitting the other’s cheek and closed lids, tiny movements of their mouths against one another.
“Yes, I do. I wanted and allowed myself not to work at my Dad’s garage, but to study management. I wanted and allowed myself to live in a big city instead of in Kansas, so I moved here. Just this morning, I wanted and allowed myself a chocolate bar with extra peanut butter in it.” He takes a deep breath. “I also wanted and allowed myself to be your sub. All of this is already more than enough. Some of it even more than that.”
Castiel is off to the side for most of their fight, as he has known not to involve himself too deeply in the brothers’ fights and whatever is putting a strain on their relationship at any given time. Yet, he too has been aware of Dean’s somewhat changed behaviour; how he has been brusque and short-tempered the last few days, how he has spent a considerable amount of time locked up in his room and how he could barely look at Sam, let alone Castiel.
As they break their kiss this time, Dean finally looks fully awake. There is still a shimmer to his eyes, but also something darker -- Dean’s desire swelling in kind --, the sight of which Castiel has grown familiar with over the years, longs for so often that is is pitiful at times.. For yet another time in his life, Castiel catches himself realizing how helplessly in love he is with Dean, that there is nothing he would not do for him.
is specifically the one to take care of both of them now, Dean’s at a bit of a loss. Because Castiel doesn’t want Dean as a lover, that much did he already made clear when he declined his propositions on their way to the precinct, but as what else does he want him? As a child? Why would he go so far for some damn kids he’s only known to exist for a few hours now, opening their home to them and speaking of moving away with them, only so they’re safe? And why, of why, beyond it all, does Dean trust him? Why does he
They don’t do so much as stir when Dean waddles off the bed, taking great care not to accidentally step or fall on them, and then he makes his hesitant way to where he knows – thanks to Castiel’s little tour the evening before – where the kitchen is.
is, but it does look an awful lot like pain. Weird.
In the quiet, Dean can hear Castiel’s breath hitch as much as he can feel Castiel’s cock stiffen up that tiny bit more. Yet, Dean doesn’t do anything more than nuzzle his face into Castiel’s hand and close his eyes for a moment.
Dean smiles sleepily and rubs his cheek into Castiel’s hand. “It was good.”
He tries not to think about it as he sheds the last of his clothing at last, the pants of his pajama and his briefs soon folded and set before him. Because he knows that what is happening right now isn’t about that, not about why he isn’t too keen on showing off all of his body by the light of day instead of the lazy and dark buzz of the night. No, this is about what Castiel commanded him to do, what Castiel wants to see. If he tells Dean to undress and put on a robe, Dean obeys. Should he tell Dean to put off the robe again and openly display his body to him, then that is something he will do, too. If Castiel tells him that he wants to see his body, then Dean has to believe that he does want to see it. There’s no room for anything else here, not for Dean’s doubts nor his resistance -- only for Castiel’s commands.
Instead, despite Castiel’s calm demeanour, Dean feels that there might be that same spark of overwhelming excitement in his eyes and that can be found in all of Dean’s body. The realization of which flatters Dean, has heat invade his senses and his dick, and makes it all the easier for him to remain standing up straight and obedient at the threshold of the living room, only a few steps inside, hands clasped behind his back and waiting for his Dom’s further command. His approval.
me? Really, Cas?”
“What I’m trying to say is: on a hunt, anything can happen. Might go good, and yeah, might go bad. It’s what we’re used to – known all our lives. All we can do is give our best and hope it all pans out. And work with what we got. Same as you. Yeah, you can’t magically mojo all my injuries away, but you can kill any bitch with a blade like it’s nobody’s business. You’re quick and precise, and a damn asset to our hunts, if you ask me. And that’s what you should be focusing on. Thinking about the shoulda woulda coulda doesn’t help in any way – think of what’s right in front of you, not what’s in the past or in the future. Ain’t nothing we can do anything about anyway. Well, not much, at least.”
“I, uh,” he stammers. Does he want the usual, too? Well, of course he does; his usual is a bacon cheese burger that is nothing short of divine, dripping in grease and being all the sweeter for it, but… he shouldn’t eat that kind of thing in the evening. He usually keeps a strict diet, only indulges himself whenever Novak and him go to the Roadhouse. Otherwise, he sticks to salad and, especially in the evening, to proteins. His tummy is already soft despite his regimen, his thighs and butt too meaty for someone who should always look and act his best on his job, and all in all, he should take even better care of himself. Also, should Novak really have wanted to meet him for–
“I won’t go up and get it, if that is what you are afraid of. But I will put down everything we discuss now afterwards, so that we won’t forget any of it.”
Dean, dumbly drunk as he was on Castiel, was far from understanding whatever Castiel was hinting at. “Wha–?”
It’s not quite a laugh what Castiel lets out, more of a chuckle. A dark and rich sound, promising only good things.
of all things now, but he can’t place Castiel and whatever he is to him yet, only knows that the only ways he’s learnt to impress adults were to either take care of Sammy or to get them off. And well, since the former is off the table about now because
“Dean, I want you to be–,” he pauses, remembering his previous choice of words, which has already proven to work excellently before, “Dean, I
“Dean,” Castiel warns between gritted teeth and with a swelling sense of danger, “if you disobey me and come now, you
“Yes,” Castiel says, with the tips of his fingers playing against every part of Dean they can reach; his dressed back, his combed and gelled hair, his naked neck. “It seems I was right to fear that I was the cause of your distress.”
And then, Castiel is pulling off Dean’s robe completely, lets it flutter to the ground with a soft swooshing sound, and Dean is completely naked before him, vulnerable in any which way, but he doesn’t feel like he is. The unashamed hunger in Castiel’s eyes makes him feel desirable, Castiel’s affectionate hands roaming his skin make him feel safe, Castiel’s unerring confidence and faith in him make him feel joyful and
now. So there is no chance of him being left alone once the rush of endorphines fully drops again and only leaves the pain of his ass behind. No, he is safe within Castiel’s space and will soon get more juice and a warm meal, and this just after Castiel has told him that he wants to stay by his side if trouble arises and reassured him of his support. ‘Perfect’ is just the right word for how he feels right now.
this time, fingers tightening around Dean’s racing pulse, a desired punishment in itself. “You are not allowed to move anything but your lips from now on, unless I explicitly tell you otherwise. And no back-talking. If I say compliment you and tell you that you are perfect, then you are not to contradict me, but accept my compliment for what it is.” His hands leave Dean’s wrists again, regrettably, but the same is not true for the heat in his eyes. “As the absolute truth.”
“Dean,” he says again, and Dean thinks he has never heard a voice as deep and as lovely before. And right as he finishes this thought, the Alpha smiles softly. “Thank you.” For what, Dean does not know. “Fear not. It is not my intention to harm you or to bring you pain in any way. I am here to do the opposite, to finally bring you the bliss you deserve, my beautiful Dean.” As he speaks, his hand slides from Dean’s chin over his cheek, and then he cups it, holds his head in the tender cradle of it. And then — greedy and hungry and foolish as he is — Dean leans into it with a small whimper. But instead of shoving him away and insulting Dean for how he dares such a thing, the Alpha’s smile grows even wider and he strokes over the freckled, ugly skin of Dean’s face with his thumb. For just a moment, Dean feels his eyes flutter.
must have been good.
“Very much so.”
again. Because for a moment, he forgets that he should hold back, that he should not give in to how he wants to sway even closer to Novak and just enjoy that the reward of a little something right now. Like the glimmer in Novak’s eyes and the gummy smile and especially not the hand that Novak lifts slowly between the two of them, with which he brushes over Dean’s cheek, in what is much too personal for a boss and an assistant and yet not personal enough for someone so devoid of and starving for touch and approval by this very man.
It is when Dean is drawing closer to him on the bed, laughing exaggeratedly about something Castiel has said, and then stumbles on the soft, yielding mattress, landing with half of his body on top of the former angel, that Castiel decides to act.
“Well then, my naughty little boy,” Castiel says mildly and loud enough for Dean to hear despite his sobbing and shuddering and his small-sounding apologies.
“Okay,” Castiel agrees with a soft smile and a benign kiss to Dean’s forehead. “I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. I am sorry for springing this on you. I am sure you must be very exhausted after you have been so wonderful for me, and you must still be hurting. We can talk about this sometime else – whenever you want to. Should you want to.”
Dean could not help but groan. “Yeah, thanks, man. That wasn’t my point, though.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, and despite his earlier confidence in how he is allowed to do whatever in this kitchen and this household, he feels a little less sure of himself now. “Unless you got a problem with that,” he says, intending to spit it out, challenging in the way he is used to around people like Castiel, cops and grown-ups alike, but it comes out a little small, as too much of a mirror of what he feels like. Not a challenge, but an inquiry.
At last, Castiel picks up some speed, if only to the extent that he can in their position. At the same time, Dean feels his orgasm beginning to build inside of him.
Dean can’t keep in his groan as he imagines those marks remaining on his skin until after the next Monday, when he will have to work again, and other people noticing them. Maybe some of them believing something extraordinarily bad must have happened to him; maybe some of them knowing something extraordinarily good must have happened to him. Either way, they might ask and point, make Dean blush even, which would be fine enough by him as long as they don’t touch them. Because they are his to keep and his to enjoy, just as he is for Castiel.
“As is making sure that not just your body, but also your mind comes out of your encounter unscathed. Which includes talking to you, praising you for how
but it doesn’t work out like that
Because then suddenly, Cas’ lips are back where they belong, pressing against Dean’s neck, ever-so-softly, and his whole body arches in to Dean, a dome of warmth and a buzz of clean electricity above him, lightening him up.
And that’s exactly what this is:
So Dean obeys, with a litany of harsh breaths and soft and hasty cries of “Oh”s, “Ah”s, “Sir”s and one unsolicited little
“I told you to stay still, Dean,” Castiel grumbles into Dean’s ass, “don’t make me stop to take care of your behind with an open palm instead of my tongue.”
“I promise,” Dean brings out around a moan bubbling up in his throat as Castiel lowers himself just enough for their crotches to finally properly meet each other, for them to rub together not just so, but enough to really feel it. To be once more aware of the effect he has on Castiel, and of what Castiel might be packing. Because that’s a nice bulge coming up to meet his own. One – as he at once acutely becomes aware of – he has yet to see. That is, not in post-scene haze and not when it’s already soft and just dangling in the thick bush that he, at the very least, knows Castiel to be sporting.
“No, no, please take your time. This is important.”
Castiel’s lips curve up into a dark, promising little smile, and Dean thinks maybe he should run, but every direction he can think of is right into Castiel’s arms. “In that case, I would like to continue kissing you, all over, until I reach your cock and your rim, where I would kiss you, too. I want to take you into my mouth and taste you, taste how hard you are for me, and then I want to lick you out, Dean. I want you to remain as still as I told you to be, want you to squirm and moan, and come on nothing but my tongue.”
In the morning, they still didn’t care about the bedspread, the pillows or the piles of discarded shoes and clothing. So, all they did was brush their teeth and wash their faces and then trot into the kitchen, where they ate some seriously buttered and honeyed toast, drank the richest-tasting coffee Dean has ever had in a private household and just lounged around and talked about their upcoming mayor elections and their favourite foods for a bit, until Castiel suggested for him to go and get the list.
Castiel grants him his silence for some time, for as long as it takes Dean to look back at him, or the general direction of him, and to school his face into something neutral, something only betrayed by the ruddy cheeks.
Dean swallows again, and he feels a tremble run through his body, making it move just so, not enough for Castiel to get angry over it or call him disobedient, yet still enough for Castiel to take in the soft shudder of his limbs, only keeping up for a few moments. Castiel then lets his hand slide up, cups Dean’s cheeks and looks him deep in the eyes.
Dean stands up that bit straighter and just barely fights against the urge to clasp his hands together on his back.
“I do,” Dean repeats, softer this time. Even then, he can’t help but wish for a day that they know where each other’s limits are – a day where their interactions are as natural as breathing that words might become obsolete.
Although Dean had been the one to suggest not using any condoms once they went steady and after some initial hesitation -- because although none of them could get sick or pregnant, it was still different to be inside of someone without any kind of protection, more intimate --, Castiel was the one who went absolutely wild once they did. The first time they did it bare, Castiel came after only a few thrusts, moaning and praising all throughout it, and coming so undone by the experience that they never went back to condoms again. Instead, they explored Castiel’s serious kink for coming inside of Dean, enjoying him without barriers and marking him in a deeply primal way, the only time that the animal part of his vessel truly takes over.
“Hold onto me as much as you can,” Castiel says and lets his hand wander lower, from Dean’s chest towards his waist, where he grabs him. “I have to turn you around in order to have us chest-to-chest, which will allow us to take on the position I just suggested.”
Dean shuffles a bit where he lies on him, bracing himself just enough on Castiel’s chest that he can easily hold his gaze. Impossibly, Dean can already feel his dick try to stiffen up again. Only sluggishly so and only enough to thicken it a bit and make it feel hotter; it will probably lead nowhere. Yet, the warm arousal is still nice, especially so when Dean finds an answering chubby from below him. Castiel seems undeterred but makes a pleased sound when their dicks lazily slot against each other.
Dean blows out a breath. “Look, I just... wanna be a bit fitter, alright? More muscle, less fit, run a bit faster. That kinda thing.“
“Is this alright, Dean?” Castiel asks, already smiling down at a probably pretty obviously pleased Dean.
“And?” Castiel coaxes gently, playfully.
Castiel, filling up his mouth and throat and whatever space in him he reserved for Dean, as if it were Dean’s space and his place, as if in reality, Dean wasn’t the one getting filled.
Yet, the loudest of sounds he is able to make -- apart from the loud, echoing smacks of skin on skin -- are the numbers, a Twelve and a Thirteen. He almost misses the Fourteen when Castiel strikes the hidden center of him again, this time actually gets half of a smack on Dean’s hole, which has him howl, which has him
And as he opens his mouth to say exactly that, to point out how meaty his thighs and how unseemly his belly is, he notices Castiel watching him, looking him in the eyes. Calm, cool, determined. Patient, and yet waiting -- for what Dean has yet to realize -- with one creased brow.
Who does this jerkwater town think he is, to try to meddle in this way? He knows nothing about Dean or Sam or John or the great sacrifices they have to make; knows nothing about what waits in the shadows to strike when you sleep, how any creature is so much worse than any human could be, or any man with rough hands and a desire to hurt. What’s a little pain when there’s ghosts and vampires and mothers burning on the ceiling? What’s a bit blood when Sammy’s stomach grumbles?
“I know.”
Castiel just makes a thoughtful sound at that and slowly, with apparently all the time in the world, raises himself from his seat. “Then I apologize for not laughing,” Castiel says, but not unkindly, and as if to offer Dean a consolation prize and a sign of good faith at the same time, he quirks a small smile at him.
So, in order to give him a bit of reassurance and support at least, Castiel decides to speak the same language that Dean does – that of actions.
That has him wrap his hand around his already aching cock as soon as he finally dashes in through his apartment door, making it no further than the entrance hall with his pants clumsily shoved down. While his other hand is stroking over his necktie and over his belly, cupping the swell of it just like Castiel has cupped his cheek, because whereas usually, he can’t stand his tummy’s natural bulge and especially not the way it sticks out after a heavy meal, it is now that much more prominent because of the food
“You’re not just
“I’m not Jesus,” Castiel replies, a small smile stealing onto his lips despite himself.
– of his fellow priests, he has defiled the site of his rites, does so over and over again.
“Gladly,” Castiel agrees in a rush of breath, arousal and anticipating making their way out in a swoop. Now that he knows that he is allowed to, there is no holding him back anymore. So, he turns his head to the side to catch Dean’s parted and waiting lips with his own, enjoys the wiggle of his hips and the smile around Dean’s lips, pulls him in closer to himself, as close a he could be, with both hands on his butt and growing heat in his heart.
And oh, Dean might have forgotten all about it in the haze of his spanking, filed it away as just another irrelevant thing in that moment, as much as any other part of the world was irrelevant, because they weren’t Castiel nor Castiel’s hand nor the harsh sting of blows on his ass. But now that Castiel reminds him, he does recall what is still in store for him -- what he was promised as a
Because instead of simply eating the cornflakes, there’s playful fighting over the spoon and soft presses against each other and feeding one another. And before Dean even realizes it, his lips are on Castiel’s and his arms are slung around him, the now also empty other bowl someplace Dean doesn’t care about, too taken in by the way Castiel grabs for him in return, pulls him into his body with a quiet moan and hands that cradle Dean’s head. They are just kissing there, tasting each other again after a whole night of not doing so, and it’s slow and unhurried, almost juvenile.
“Cas,” Dean whispers as one of his hands comes up to clutch at the arm that is lifted to reach his face, and as his fingers close around Castiel’s wrist, it’s not to push him away but to pull him further in with gentle tugging. “Please.”
“I’m sure you can. If we do this together, we can do anything.” With a feather-light touch, he rubs the swollen skin beneath Dean’s eye. “We will get you to see how truly beautiful you are. Not just hot or handsome, but perfect in every way.” His smile turns into a shy little grin. “A real catch.”
“I don’t expect you to give me an answer right away,” Castiel speaks into the slow tunes mellowing the room. “This is surely something that should be given time and thought to. And to meet you for dinner, come out and say something like this and expect you to either agree or disagree within half an hour of conversation would be foolish.”
And Dean is thankful for it.
“Are you ready to order now?” she asks instead.
“That’s, uhm,” Dean clenches his eyes shut for a moment, but it only amplifies the image burning behind his eyelids. Of those pink lips on his, of Castiel actively fantasizing about this as well, about teeths and tongues and the long-awaited satisfaction of a mutual craving. “Fine by me.”
Still, Dean can’t help but glance towards him, trying to chance a look all over Cas’ body and maybe even his delicate parts, because he has never quite seen him like this. Sure, there was that one incident with the bees, but the dude had lost his mind back then, so trying to get an eyeful of, uh, what’s between his legs was not really was Dean was going for. He was more focused on catching Cas, throwing a blanket over him, and getting the bees off his body.
“Then, that is what you’ll receive. You’re such a good boy for telling me this, Dean. I know it wasn’t easy for you, but you still did. So perfect, telling me about your needs, allowing me to take care of you in the way you want me to.”
gets to see Dean naked? Sure, Cas is way too nice a person to make Dean feel bad for his belly, but at the same time, Dean doesn’t want to risk it. He hasn’t known him long enough to know everything about him there is to know; maybe he’s a real snob when it comes to the physical appearance of the people he sleeps with, maybe he will silently draw back from Dean once he’s being confronted with the truth of his boyfriend’s body, maybe he will look like he’s about to laugh and then choke it down for Dean’s sake and find some excuse for them to stop.
afterwards, whenever he woke up naked and by himself come morning, but that isn’t the point. The point is that he doesn’t want to give Cas a reason to leave him, and any reason that’s not good enough to make him stay would be one to leave. Like being pudgy and soft all over. No one likes double chin.
“I will,” Cas promises in a hushed and reverent tone, looking at Dean in wonder and endless gratitude, leaning forward to press one more kiss to his forehead. “In the morning, I will
as well.
“Yeah,” Dean feels, and he feels like crying because he’s feeling so dejected by his own behaviour and for Castiel. He’s just been bad and rude and dismissive and he should be tossed aside or punished for that. Not have the man he just snubbed kiss his throat all gently, as if Dean was the one in need of comfort.
“If you think this absolutely necessary, then we will go into another city. There are other precincts around, all over the States, and there will always be work for someone from the force.”
“Yeah?”
to promise
As he does so, Dean clears his throat a couple of times, smiles, blushes, and relaxes into their fleeting contact.
Distantly, he feels Castiel fucking him through it, making some encouraging and excited sounds, because if there is one thing that Castiel loves as much or even more than coming inside of Dean, it is making
"…time," Cas completes for him.
And as he stumbles away from Castiel, he quickly grabs a random sack of potatoes, shoots off a brief, “You win, we take your potatoes,” and as good as throws them into their shopping cart.
The sight is almost too much. Dean is not the one in any position to put a claim on Castiel, and yet, he has done so. Yes, Castiel has already willingly given himself over to Dean -- has made sure both of them were on the same page when it came to being exclusive -- but there were no ties and no bruises, barely any naked skin to show for it. It has been merely more than a verbal assurance from Castiel. And now, there it is, the unmistakable sign of Castiel’s mouth covered in Dean’s come, and Dean’s skin littered with Castiel’s bruises in return.
Mention/Discussion of the following kinks: kneeling, bondage, rimming, felching, pain play, humiliation play, age play, partner sharing, mutual masturbation, other things I’m too lazy to tag
Castiel smiles at the sound and at Dean, almost lazily happy. This leisure carries over into the rest of his actions, because when he tightens his grip around Dean’s hips and when he presses a kiss to the center of Dean’s chest first, then to his right nipple and then the left, it’s with a lack of hurry, an absence of desperation. It’s a confidence from which tranquility stems, and this very tranquility transfers to Dean, a submissive trusting the sure hands and secure signs of his Dominant, and it has him immersing himself fearlessly into all of this, into this act of gratification and worship.
“Please,” Dean whispers against the soft cushion he is bedded on, all of his body in open display yet remaining in absolute comfort.
“Dean,” Cas sighs out, and he looks troubled. “I find it difficult to think that with you, there might actually be one person in the world who is not completely taken in by your beauty. Not just your looks, as perfect as they are, but also your kind heart and humour, the way you carry yourself, the--”
Dean looks down at his now empty plate.
Dean’s free hand returns to Castiel’s shoulder, digs into the flesh once more, and Castiel relishes his grasp with a groan and a pumping of his hand around them. Dean tugs and Castiel pushes, and then all of Castiel’s weight is on top of Dean, all of him covering him, their hands sandwiched in between their bellies, forbidding them from moving anything but their hips, to do anything but rut and pant in their chase for relief.
“Yeah,” Dean says, throat tight and insides churning, but his feet moving along nonetheless. “I gotcha.”
“And do you still want that?” Castiel checks once more.
Dean. It’s enough to make Dean’s dick twitch where it lies in its black curls and own mess, but nothing more.
He does nothing more than to sleepily murmur Dean’s name in confusion about his crowding in close and to wait and see what he does. By the time he’s got it, his big arm is lying protectively and tightly around Dean, right where the boy has placed it, and with other hand, he reaches over Dean’s head, brushing his hair with his skin, and lets his fingers skirt over Sam’s scalp, petting his head. Just clumsily and slowly, with obviously no petting experience to speak of, and yet it is enough. Enough to have Sam sigh out and murmur and snuggle even deeper into his brothers arms, already fast asleep and with his shivering gone.
And certainly not
“I will. It won’t happen again, sir,” Dean gasps, weak in the knees and in his voice by the way Castiel’s nose and lips carefully trace over his sensitive skin.
Maybe Castiel would do better to just kick out Dean and keep Sam, leaving that brat of an elder brother to his own devices.
Dean sighs out deeply and leans into the kisses wandering all over his cheek and jaw and every now and then to the sensitive tips of his ears, putting tiny kisses to them, just small pecks to where his ears are a bit pointed and still freckled.
In that moment, Dean knows – just like he knew about their house when it was in flames – that he won’t see the motel ever again. And neither what lies inside; maybe he won’t ever have to face again what came along with every motel room and every new city and every shadow. Loneliness, sometimes pain, always fear.
“Hm-you.”
“I think I knew enough that I should have gone out of my way to assure that you are absolutely fine.”
“Not because I wanted to. And not because I wanted to renounce you or anything. But I can’t wear it every day; you know how office politics are. How closely some people look at how you dress yourself and judge you and your skills by it.” It’s a truth he is not happy about, but it’s also not something he can deny. Especially because there’s more than his own reputation riding on how he looks and presents himself: as Castiel’s personal assistant, his reputation would also impact Castiel’s. He needs to look sharp and stay on top of his game, and must make people believe he is. Nobody who has some sloppy secretary will ever make it to CEO. “If it was up to me, I,” he huffs out a laugh at himself, “I would’ve worn it every day.”
He does neither.
idea, even though he doesn’t really understand where it’s coming from and how it would be in any way connected to what they have just discussed. Maybe Castiel has already moved on in his thoughts and is just acting on a whim. Either way, Dean is in no way opposed to it, actually in strong favour of a kiss. So, he nods and already leans forward for a bit, his eyes falling half-closed with the motion.
“Good,” Castiel breathes against his skin, and when he resumes his kissing, Dean can feel him smile despite it all. Can feel him nudge their completely flaccid dicks against each other.
Between his last blow and his quiet reassurance, barely any time passes before he is propped up over Dean, who is still lying on his stomach and can see little more of Castiel than his elbows and hands and his face whenever he leans forward to nudge Dean’s chin up to steal some kisses.
And this one is easy, because there’s a thing that Dean has longed for all week. Even more than to wear his necktie again or to receive another emoticon blowing him a kiss or to be allowed to go home and be by himself. None of these things have come close to his embarrassing daydreams about Castiel swooping in and swooping him up into his arms, just holding and soothing him for a while.
“I’m sure it does.” Going by his voice and by what Dean knows of him, he feels like Castiel might be smiling or wanting to, at least. He’s pleased, as much is obvious, though maybe not specifically with Dean. Because he doesn’t praise him or anything, just strokes the tender flesh he has just struck, where Dean is already sensitive and soft by nature, and now even more so. But instead of twitching away or pressing into Castiel’s hand like he wants to, all Dean does is take a deep breath. “That is why I want to do this for you, Dean. But I have told you to remain still and let me take care of you in the way we have already agreed upon beforehand. And if you won’t let me, I will have to punish you for it. And I know both of us are more than fine with spanking.”
Dean glances up upon hearing his name spoken in that low, lovely voice, sounding so worried and close. Castiel is standing in front of his desk, brows furrowed, his trenchcoat already on and his briefcase at the ready, held in one hand. Going by his get-up, it’s obvious that he must be done for the day. A quick look at the clock tells Dean that he should be long done, too.
This right there, this has been the only task Castiel has given Dean for tonight, and he already been halfway into slipping up. At the
issue now, then we should take care of him together.”
because you are two growing boys who had to make it through a lot of things and deserve some privacy and time for yourselves. The latter at the very least at your most vulnerable, during the night. It’s not inappropriate in a sexual sense and it’s also not an excuse for whatever you seem to believe I think about you; both you and Sam simply deserve a safe space in this home. One that doesn’t include strange men next to you or that is open to anyone who sets foot into this apartment.”
“Mmh, it seems you were not the only one,” Dean all but purrs as he enjoys the lazy kisses to his skin and the way Castiel caresses his thigh, right where he has kept him in place mere moments before.
“If you’re looking for Novak, he’s at your usual table.” She makes a small, unnecessary head movement towards where Dean knows their usual table to be. While she does, she lifts both her eyebrows and her grin takes on a cheekier, maybe more suggestive note. “He’s been sitting there for over two hours already, and whenever I asked him if he wants to pay, he orders something new to drink.”
So instead, Dean just silently watches as Castiel lets the honey drip from one coffee spoon into his own mug – one spoonful – and then into the sunny one – three spoonfuls –, then stirs the honey into the liquid.
“Apart from this, there is something else I wanted to talk about. To clarify. Because I want both of us to be on the same page right away, which is why I want to reaffirm that, to me, this is meant as a private meet-up, not a business meeting.”
“Good evening, Dean,” he greets, voice deep and warm. Without shame, his gaze sweeps over Dean’s face, taking it in almost uncomfortably, then down towards his neck, (suddenly, the necktie feels a bit too tight and like maybe it could stand to be even tighter, could be tied around Dean someplace else), and then Novak appraises the whole of Dean’s body, his rumpled figure and the hands around the handle of his messenger back and the dark slacks that Dean prays to hide how much he preens under the undivided attention and the warm rush that comes along with it. By the time Novak is done, Dean is flushed and feels warm, but strangely enough, not from embarrassment anymore.
“Ah,” Dean hiccups, and only then does he notice that there’s no lips on his neck anymore, just fingers tracing the skin, and that Castiel is looking down at him with a glint in his eyes. Somehow, Dean knows he must paint a pretty picture: flushed and aroused by his fantasies about the man above him, whose bulge is rubbing against his at a steady yet slow pace now, his eyes fixed attentively on his face.
"I— w—" Dean stutters, and understands, and then he wants to cry, because this simply cannot be — maybe he is such an insult to his god that his god himself decided to come down, to ridicule him for it. Because it is not possible for someone like Castiel to regard him with anything but disgust.
“Green,” Dean reassures him, and he means it.
Faintly, he hears a sound that might well be a laugh, and all that he receives in answer to his words is a tiny bite to his cheek, so close to his rim that it has a moan mixed with a yelp escape his mouth. Castiel just sounds even more amused as he deliberately puts a few kisses up and down Dean’s crack, skipping his entrance and even giving his balls a kiss. And
They are working together in the finally used garden all morning, and whenever Castiel passes Dean by, Dean sticks his butt out in his direction, flushes an exquisite shade of pink and talks in a loud and attention-seeking way and sometimes even wiggles his behind a little.
That tremble is back, making Dean feel small but not unprotected, just making him wish he was allowed to lift his hands and cradle Castiel’s face against his chest, pulling him close to where he is already planting kisses against, teasing Dean’s nipples with nothing but his lips and curious fingers, humming and soft.
The machine stirs and hums and sizzles, heating up the water.
gotten Cas half-hard from doing nothing but sitting here — no touching, not even looking before he was allowed to, just physical vincinity. It’s oddly satisfying. Strangely enough, it makes Dean
Her smirk is all smugness and self-confidence, and Dean can’t say she isn’t right, that she doesn’t have them by the balls with their burgers. Among other things. Because despite being a little brat sometimes, Jo has got a quick wit and a sharp tongue and Dean finds himself having fun arguing with her, and he genuinely likes spending time at the Roadhouse. Which also means that Dean has to defend both Castiel and his honour by sassing her in return. But right as he is about to try to come up with a comeback, Castiel cuts in.
and his begging to keep up the role he is supposed to play, lapses in reason and gives in to his need to just rut and moan.
Dean gulps. On the one hand, he wants nothing more than to get it on with Cas, to see him naked and to have his hands all over him (especially because there is no doubt in his mind that, with how attentive and kind Cas is, he will be an amazing lover), but on the other, what if Cas loses interest as soon as
Castiel huffs out a laugh. “I would say that that wasn’t roleplaying, exactly. Rather than reality.” Can’t argue with that. “But is that a Yes to roleplaying in general?”
And just like that, Castiel is kissing his butt cheeks, as tenderly as any other part, and – going by his pleased, low sounds – enjoying the soft give of them, how squishy they must be beneath his lips and his hands.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean pants, riled up just by the kisses and the promise of what is to come, “I’ll tell you, I swear.”
and now they are gaining their rewards for it: Dean offering the side of his mattress with an almost coy smile, Castiel hovering nearby, night clothes in his hands and warmth beneath his skin
Dean has the sudden urge to bite his lip and keep quiet. Because he’s already pretty sure that what he wants to ask about is nothing. That there are many reasons for things people do and that he shouldn’t be narcissistic enough to assume that all and any of them have to do with him, but he can’t help feeling this way nonetheless. So, he can’t help but ask, “What’s the… head in hands about?”
“Really?” Dean echoes. “Even though I, y’know, moved against your command? You had to punish me. More than once.” How many times exactly, Dean wouldn’t be able to say, though.
With a heaving chest, Dean lets go of his ears and his gaze sweeps over the sanctuary for a moment, where no one else but him and the priestess have been able to recover from the roaring and everyone else is still cowering and panting, and then he hesitatingly glances towards the stranger. Over his white vestments and the blue girdles and the golden ornaments adorning him, up his broad shoulders and a face so beautiful, it’s inhumane, to piercing blue eyes that are looking directly at — at
“Yeah, okay,” Dean breathes out, trying hard to keep his voice steady, not to shudder from the cold and his fear, “A hundred bucks for the night, then.”
So, Castiel leans forward, closer to Dean, who is standing with his back towards the potato display, and he intends to pick up a sack of regular potatoes, wordlessly give it to Dean, take a silent step back and just move on into the cornflakes aisle, in order to to give both of them the chance to pretend this disgraceful little fight has never happened.
Which, really, makes his praise only all the sweeter.
“Milk,” Dean says, in lieu of asking for some cocoa powder and warm milk, “and sugar.”
Any way that does not include the words ‘enjoy’, ‘invite’ or ‘lovely’, and especially nothing that implies that whatever they do is tender lovemaking and that Dean is some beautiful soul who is making Castiel the greatest gift on earth by allowing him to fuck him gently for hours. Although, truth be told, Dean does not necessarily
“Well then, enjoy your meal.” She shares one last look with Dean, and Dean is glad that she doesn’t have the chance to grab him, drag him into the backroom and ask him all of the questions that she obviously wants to ask. Because instead, all she can do is take her note pad and pen in hand and strut off.
“Can you let me up?” Dean wiggles a bit to further illustrate by how he’s completely covered by Castiel’s warm and heavy body and how he couldn’t just roll out from under him. All of which, Dean supposes, feels nice in its own way.
“I don’t know if I can,” Dean chokes out, and Christ, does he hate how his voice breaks around his words, how every tear is audible in it.
“Yes, that’s exactly what I mean.” One of his hands strays from where both were it was stroking Dean’s sides and his embarrassingly still swollen tummy, down to where Dean is about as equally swollen, yet still confined to the fabric of his dress pants, and waiting. Casually and almost experimentally, Castiel lays his hand on the bulge of it, and squeezes.
Because they can do
Castiel’s hands are working relentlessly on the buttons of Dean’s dress shirt and when they won’t succeed in undressing him properly, hindered by the green tie, Castiel huffs out some breath and looks like he’s one second away from growling. And god, does Dean want him to. To rip open his shirt and have his way with him, all while growling and whispering filth into Dean’s ear.
“I know you will.” There’s soft smacks now, sounding wetter with every torturing kiss that it takes for Castiel’s mouth once again find the endlessly tightening and relaxing hole that’s still coated from the few tongue strokes he got in just before, his spit making it slick and glisten and so easy to brush his lips over it. It’s a tease that has Dean sighing and wishing to crane his head to look to where Castiel is, which he doesn’t, but it’s also a tease that’s followed through. Because there’s not just brushes then, but also proper kisses, a tiny lick with the tip of Castiel’s tongue that leaves Dean on edge.
Castiel curls his brow in mild irritation, yet sits up a bit, slinging an arm around Dean’s back to draw Dean back up with him. “Should Adler think it necessary to search for and find any more ‘faults’ in your constantly impeccable work, then I won’t hesitate to point out the faults in his conduct to the Human Ressources Department.”
“What if–” Dean starts, but his voice breaks up. This is stupid. His hesitation and especially his question. Still. He begins once again. “What if we –
“It’s perfect,” Dean reassures warmly. While Castiel’s body is an amazing mixture of soft and firm, the cushion of the sofa is nothing but plush and welcoming, and it’s nice to just let himself sink into it. Especially because Dean knows that he can always call Castiel and his strong body back to him, that he is in Castiel’s apartment, his
Even though Dean might still not be looking at Castiel, he can feel Castiel looking at him. His warm breath hitting the side of Dean’s face, both hands still somewhere in contact with Dean’s body at all times.
And in the morning, Dean is the first one to wake. Carefully, he extracts himself from the cuddle pile on the bed, himself pressed in between the two others, Castiel’s hand still in the rough vicinity of Sam’s head, Sam’s tiny hand curled around one of Castiel’s big fingers, both still deep in sleep.
The loud puffing and rustling sounds immediately die down at that, bring with them a long, stretched-out silence.
Dean didn’t even remember calling out for Castiel specifically. He thought all he had done was scream and curse and hoping for either Cas or Sam to come and help him.
“I will tick it off with a clear No,” Castiel acquiesces, and immediately does as he says.
Dean is even more beautiful like this, drunk on the adrenaline of a successful hunt and the expensive beer he insisted they invest in, nothing but smiles and laughter that dissipates into quiet little giggles, all warm and flushed skin and, maybe most importantly of it all, no inhibition in his touches.
Dean tries not to mind as much. Sure, he does mind, on some level, but he knows there is no way in hell John would accept him as he is, just like this. Maybe someday, should Dean find a man instead of a woman to settle down with, to
“What’s more,” Castiel continues, “you managed to enter some sort of subspace, and that during our first scene. From what I could father, you often slipped in and out of it and most of it probably spilled into the Aftercare.” He sounds like he’s not sure if that’s a good of bad thing, considering. “But to make it even that far is impressive. That you could enter any subspace at all and enjoy what I did.” He nods as he looks Dean deep in the eye. “It says a lot about your ability to trust me and you as a submissive.”
“You did. See to me.”
Because focused, Castiel seems to be enough. There’s the play of his tongue around Dean’s rim, yet it seems not to be there to breach him and lick inside like Castiel promised to yet, but to wet his lips, get them even nicer and slicker as he keeps up his kisses.
So Dean does as he is told to and comes closer, is helplessly drawn to where Castiel is sitting on the sofa, off to the one side of it that is one of the few places he could have taken seat without having the couch table in front of it, where it could limit where Dean could stand. There’s free space in front of Castiel now, nothing but the plush carpet stretched out in front of him.
“I certainly want to believe it isn’t, not in the slightest,” Castiel says as he pulls himself closer towards Dean again, “because I like to see it as that as well. As much as as a sign of your diligence.”
“And give me a copy of it?”
Which never comes.
After all, he has already had his first brush with the Scene less than a decade ago. Had dived head-first into it all, into the harsh hands and even harsher words, not coming up for air for what felt like years, but couldn't have been more than a few intoxicated months.
“Won’t be like last time,” Dean says, maybe trying to sound teasing or defiant, but the choked-up little moan that spills out when Castiel finally slots their crotches together, length against length, knot against knot, has him sound nothing but needy.
“But I do.”
“Y-you’re drunk, man,” Dean counters, but he himself hears that his voice is a bit shaky, brought out of balance by the warm, strong body pressing up against him.
“Yes. But that’s part of the play, isn’t it?” Castiel‘s smile turns into that of a cheeky little boy. “What is more important is that we had already talked about the kind of punishment beforehand, and just like you told me, you enjoyed what I did and when I applied it. I feel like this is definitely something we should explore; it was very exciting for me to spank you and it would be an immense pleasure if I could do more of it.”
“I disagree. I am convinced that even Adler couldn’t help but enjoy the sight of your beautiful body. That he would want to touch and kiss you, too.” Castiel murmurs, dragging a line of sloppy kisses down Dean’s shoulder.
“I’m sure she is,” Castiel assures him and curls his long, elegant fingers around his burger and takes his first bite. He closes his eyes for one blissful moment, but has more manners than to moan around it, so all he does is chew it with the tiniest of smiles and his lashes fluttering.
Dean all but purrs at the tips of those fingers dancing all along his skin, at the pride that swells in his chest and at how close and happy Castiel is, all because of him.
And he knows that Castiel wants to protest his choice of words and utter his confusion, but he groans and understands as Dean presses one of his thighs between his legs, rubs it up against Castiel’s crotch and pleads once more,
“Yes to what?”
Castiel smiles at him, heatedly, as he catches Dean spying at him. He leans forward without hesitation and presses his lips sloppily against the side of Dean’s, trying to cover as much of them as he can reach. Dean hums at that, but he doesn’t think he could muster up the energy -- or the will to brace the pain -- in order to turn around on his back to get a better angle going and really get Castiel into kissing, to have him press Dean into the mattress and lick in deep and hot. As much as Dean would want him to.
When she finally breaks her silence, she asks a few questions about Cassie and Lisa and all his other ex-girlfriends. Asks whether his feelings for them were real and– and he has to explain to her again what bisexuality means, and that he loved all of them, still likes women as a whole, just like he likes men.
The case they have been working on and that, according to Sam’s research, was supposed to take no more than two or three days, stretched out into a whole week. The promised simple Salt and Burn of a ghost turned into hunting a low-class demon that somehow managed to possess half of the town. Whic is why,  as soon as they have properly exorcized and smote the demon, with Dean receiving an injury to his forehead that Castiel gratingly can do nothing about, they ‘skip town’. There are too many people there who wouldn’t take too kindly to an extended stay of theirs, so they decide not to take a risk and head for the bunker right away instead, with blood and grave mud still sticking to their hands.
“Dean?”
Their fist is wettened, the slide going easier in the pre-come dripping out and being caught by frantic fingers and cocks, always fucking back in, against one another. It’s so wet and tight that it has Dean imagining what he’s fucking into being not just a fist but a hole, and then it has him imagine what Castiel is fucking not being a fist but a hole,
For one moment, Dean forgets all about his doubts and hesitations and about how this couldn’t possibly be true, that there is no former celestial being pressing down on him, no Castiel The Terrible, only
Castiel furrows his brows and tilts his head as much as his position allows him to, as if to ask Dean in return ‘What are
The moan this pulls out of Castiel is all the sweeter for how Dean had to get up the nerves to speak like that, honest yet erotic. It seems a difficult art, no matter how easy Castiel makes every filthy little promise and idea sound.
He texts back, “& yet u didnt pick up on it. should i call stanford & tell them what kinda hacks they accept?” and laughs when Sam just replies with an emoji that is sticking out its tongue.
“Then how did you plan out your scenes before? How did your Doms knew what you liked and what not?”
“Yes.” Castiel squints at him, that assessing look returning to his eyes. It’s not unkind or anything, but it still makes Dean squirm uncomfortably where he stands. “You do know what that is, don’t you?”
to do this, hungry for Dean and his hole, as much is clear by the little moan Castiel lets out and by how his breath comes out just that bit heavier when Dean clenches again as Castiel rubs the sensitive inside of Dean’s butt cheeks with the tips of his thumbs, skirting his rim and sending a tingle throughout Dean’s body that him feel like clenching his toes.
“You’re so strong and gorgeous, Dean,” Castiel groans out, and strikes him again.
“Now stay like this and let me take care of you. Let me to kiss every part of your gorgeous body,“ Castiel says, and the use of that little word,
And for a moment there, Dean is inclined to believe him. Him, the bringer of pain and pleasure, the one whose final act of judgment is searing his skin, has him almost rut against him, has him almost break and spill.
And Dean swears there’s a smile playing around the stretched corners of Castiel’s mouth as he hums again, the sound vibrating around his cock manifold, making Dean gasp and whimper and drip into Castiel’s mouth, right down his throat. The
, about what it is they do. He is a true seducer like this, a demon through and through, not king of the crossroads for nothing.
Amazingly and just as hoped for, Castiel doesn’t react badly to his calling of Yellow. He immediately pulls away, or tries to at least, because Dean whines and feels his tremble revive when he does, and Castiel must pick up on it because he stays where he is, not pressed all up against Dean but also not out of reach, still in contact with him.
He can’t afford something like this right now – he’s worked too hard to get as far as he is. He can’t risk his job and all the he built up just because he’s into some weird stuff. But at the same time, he has learnt since back then. He knows now what it is that should be done in a BDSM arrangement, and what not. He’s grown as a person, as a man, and knows his own boundaries and how to demand them being respected. But the problem is, if he dives too deep again, into the Scene and the headspace, will he still be able to do so? To demand himself and his wishes to be respected and adhered to?
It seems to quite literally feed Castiel’s lust because the jerking of his hips becomes uncoordinated and sloppy, desperate with a vengeance, and his eyes flutter open and closed, slits of blue where Dean’s must be a heady, darkened green that seems unable to let go of the sight of Castiel above him.
that has him speak like this, that won’t accept Dean to regard himself as anything but perfect.
plead for more, because yeah, that’s what he wants, to accept that promise – for Castiel to take care of him, for him to give him food and touches and for him to take him home one day, where he will finally take Dean apart, into the smallest and most vulnerable pieces of himself, until there is nothing left of him but whimpers and moans and an endless, pleasant haze – just to put him back together again.
“why?” Castiel asks, as is expected of him, but also out of genuine curiousity. why now, why at all? why not when he was supposed to?
“Just stop bothering with it,” Dean says at last, so quietly Castiel couldn’t have possibly heard, were they not as close as they are.
“Castiel. Sir. I–” His panting is heavy and his voice is dipped low and he knows he must sound like a slut, and even though Castiel would reprimand him for his thought, Dean knows it’s true. His dripping cock would certainly agree, as would the ruined sofa cover. “I can’t. It’s too much. It’s–
the one who affects Cas in such a way.
And just as Cas has used it before,
“To– all three of them, okay?” He tries to sound defiant, not as embarrassed at he feels. Of course, he had an inkling – or maybe more than that, an idea and a feeling of hope – about Castiel, about his behaviour and about how perfectly it worked with Dean. It couldn’t possibly been all coincidence, but it’s still weird and a bit alarming how obvious Dean must be in his submissiveness for Castiel to sound so assured that his first question wasn’t even
Dean wonders if Castiel might be the one to be asexual, though his words didn’t make it sound like he is, and Dean hopes he’s right about that; because he wouldn’t mind having all those way too kind words whispered into his ear while he’s being fucked hard by him. Because not believing all that praise doesn’t mean he doesn’t enjoy hearing it.
He wanted to act like a brat, so he got treated like a brat. But instead of receiving the anger and screaming he was going for, all he got was some weary exasperation. It didn’t even take a full day for Castiel to tire of him, and ain’t that a record. John would have yelled and glared, maybe even slapped him had he let himself get engaged too far in Dean’s shit, but Castiel. Castiel is just weary and probably still half-asleep, somewhere between what Dean believes to be regret and a desire to return to bed. And yet he’s still patiently looking at Dean and waiting for his answer, instead of just deciding that in return for his sassiness, there would be no coffee and no breakfast for Dean now.
fine, too.”
“If you want anything, just holler. You know where to find me.”
Dean sighs.
Quite the opposite.”
good boy right now. If you want to make me
“Because you didn’t get enough to eat?” Officer Novak asks, all casually, no interruption in his tone of voice or in the conversation.
Cas makes a huffing sound as if laughing, but his expression is too dark with arousal for the amusement to show on his face. So, he presses his lips demanding against Dean’s, tightens his hold around their cocks and jerks his hand quickly up and down the lengths of them.
“Another rule,” Castiel murmurs against Dean’s forehead, and while he keeps speaking, his words are interspersed with little kisses that are just as tender, as caring. “You are not allowed to speak ill of yourself when we do this.” A soft kiss against Dean’s brow. “If you were easy or a ‘slut’, as you say.” A soft kiss against Dean’s freckled lids. “It surely wouldn’t have taken us months to get here, for us to build enough trust to even think of sharing something like this.” A soft kiss to his cheekbones. “And if you were, it would in no way dimish your worth and this would nonetheless still be the greatest honour.” He finally presses his lips back against Dean’s jaw. “To touch you like this.” And a soft kiss to the hollow of Dean’s throat, where necktie and skin are only loosely connected, the silk not protecting his throat from the insistent kisses its being peppered with. “To kiss you like this.”
It’s why Dean becomes reckless, why he reaches out with his hands and grabs Cas’ face with them, to force him away from Dean’s neck and to guide him up instead, up to where Dean’s lips are open and waiting and suddenly
Dean concentrates on nothing but the physical sensations. He tries to empty his mind of the anxiety and growing panic. Instead, he returns and listens to the kisses he receives, focuses on how nice Castiel’s fingers feel against his nipples, breathes in tandem with Castiel, deep and slow. It’s enough for his body and mind to relax in Castiel’s hold, for him to enjoy where he is and what he is doing again.
And right when Dean wants to protest, when he wants to apologize, that Cas rapidly moves his hand and fucks into his fist, almost painfully against Dean’s aching and throbbing cock, and he promises, in a whisper and in the filthiest voice possible,
Perfect, basically.
Dean feels like crying.
Castiel couldn’t even have anticipated just how much so. And neither could Dean, honestly. After all, this is the first time he’s in this type of situation at all – one in which he gets to express his needs and possibly even make any demands. Before, in any other arrangement of this kind, all he knew and all there was was the absence of care, a disregard of whatever Dean’s
Castiel’s lips brushing the corners of his mouth and the little wrinkles by his eyes makes Dean think of another word that he could use to describe how he feels in this moment, one that might be the most accurate of them all:
They don’t do much that evening, in terms of both sexual stuff and also in terms of any other things, really. Strung out from the week and the last vestiges of work, both of them choose to be okay with doing nothing more than ordering a pizza for Castiel and a salad for Dean and watching a cooking show to go along with it. Even though Castiel doesn’t know how to cook properly and Dean isn’t in the habit of eating any of the rich and delicious-looking meals presented on the screen or even those are so neatly printed in his cookbooks, they plenty enjoy watching the show. Maybe it’s because of the funny host, the hard-working candidates or because they are already so full from their take-out that they aren’t hungering for the food on screen, but for something else.
him, but for Dean to feel
The calling of his name seems to snap Dean back from wherever his mind has wandered off to. Which is good in principle, but it also means that he blinks and flounders and takes a hasty step back, eyes wide and framed by the pink.
Dean squirms, embarrassed despite the heat pooling deep in his guts. He wants that, yeah, oh does he ever. Wants Cas to hold him down and bite and suck his skin, so that he can press into the bruises whenever he feels lonely during the week, whenever he misses him. Which he does a lot. Too much, he often thinks.
And anyway, he
He’s looser already, he can feel it, his body used to Castiel’s attentions by now, and Dean’s sure that if he wanted to, Castiel could easily fit two fingers at once inside, just like that. Two of his long, thick fingers, all up in Dean. And Dean has no doubt that Castiel, as experienced as he seems, would be have no troubles finding his prostate with them, stroking it easily and tantalizingly, just how he handles all of Dean, and that he then would slowly lure him over the edge, milk him dry and render him useless, unwanting for anyone else. With just two of his thick fingers.
feels like. Because while seeing Charlie graduate and having his father Bobby tell him that he’s proud of Dean when he finally got accepted by Sandover were quite the events in themselves, Dean would be hard-pressed to recall them right now – or any other event in his life, for that matter. Because how could he? Like this, with warmth and comfort and firm limbs pressing in on him from all sides, with the mouth of Castiel finding his own again and again, presses and licks and bites, like he’s hungry for it,
Dean’s upper body rests, just as promised, still halfway on the sofa, with Dean holding on for dear life with one hand on the couch and the other on Castiel’s biceps, digging equally into both. Yet, he is not wavering in his position or feeling scared of dropping because Castiel is right there with him, his focus unbroken on holding Dean up and steady and keeping himself stretched above him at first, on not letting go until they can balance each other out first.
Dean snorts again and tries to make an amusend, arrogant little noise, but all it ends in is some choked-out sound. He’s scared now, really. For himself, but mostly for Sam. “You gotta be kidding me with all this shit.”
ecstasy, and the blackness that eventually overtakes him.
“Hum?” Dean asks dumbly, burrowing his nose at that warm and nice-smelling place where Castiel’s collar ends and his skin begins. He can barely even remember any
. I need to. It’s too good, I feel
“Let us leave already. It’s cold and,” the man interrupts him, expression hard and the gaze out of blue eyes sweeping all over Dean’s body, and Dean feels even colder, “I waited long enough.”
“but also before. But you won’t have to shoulder all that anymore, not alone. I mean it when I say that you deserve to feel safe and be protected, and giving you a living space for yourself is part of that.”
“And as you just confirmed that you are as knowledgeable about the scene as I thought you were and still chose to accept my gift.” The necktie sits snug and burning around Dean’s neck, and Dean catches Castiel glancing meaningfully at it, and he just hopes that Castiel isn’t looking there too intently, that he won’t see the heavy bob of his Adam’s apple. “I felt even more encouraged to ask. You surely know well enough that honesty and communication are the key to any relationship, but even more so when it comes to the BDSM community. That is why I wanted to be honest.”
“‘A few days ago’? For this?”
It’s a bit insulting, so Dean can’t help the beginnings of a pout both around his lips and in his voice. “No, I am more than aware that there can be a difference between sex and BDSM.”
“Please, fuck me on your tongue,” Dean begs much more frantically now, too incensed by his own fantasy to keep calm, “lick me out like you said you would. I wanna show you I’m a good boy, I’m
“If you prefer doing the clean-up yourself, then that’s fine, of course.” Castiel nods at himself. “I was simply wondering if maybe, you would be interested in taking a bath together, in allowing me to wash you and make sure that you are alright.” Castiel’s smile is barely more than a twitch of his lips, a small, shy thing. “If you think that too intimate, I would understand, of course. I have just grown just fond of bathing as a part of Aftercare, as it combines inspecting your body with non-sexual intimacy.”
“Yes, please,” Dean says in a voice as small as his attitude.
“Didn’t you say we are supposed to take care of each other? So shouldn’t your well-being be seen to as well?”
“You don’t need to. I took care of what Adler wanted me to take care of any everything is alright. He didn’t do anything that wouldn’t have been appropriate, so you don’t need to worry.”
Dean whimpers, feeling his stomach tighten and warmth rising up inside him. “Uh, Cas, I–” he tries to move away, his face burning, but Cas grasps his shoulder, stilling him with the simple touch alone, and kisses a tender line up his neck.
“Ah, yeah.” And Dean still doesn’t know whether he’d dare to tell him – just yet and even now. If Dean would trust to tell Castiel. “But you know that goes both ways, right? That if anything’s not right or you’re not, uhm, satisfied, you have to tell me.”
“You were excellent today, Dean. Incredible, as I said. You took my spanking so wonderfully that I couldn’t help but worship you with my mouth. I knew you would be beautiful when we did this, but I couldn’t have known just
“I feel bad about seeing you like that,” Castiel deflected. Then, “I was scared when seeing you like that. Scared of losing you. And of being helpless to prevent it.”
Where his new family will sit with him.
So, Castiel opens the knot with ease and practiced fingers and the soft, silken sound of the belt loosening, and as easy as anything, Dean’s robe falls open, the belt slipping down as well, only the latter dropping to the ground, partly exposing Dean.
And maybe once his phone alarm goes off early in the morning and brings him back to reality, he will regret staying with the man with whom he had sex and who’s also his boss, but right now, it seems like there’s nothing he would rather do.
Although the package is only small and not wrapped up in flashy paper, it’s anything but unassuming; its position right in the middle of the desk is clearly meant to draw Dean’s attention, no,
Castiel growls out, tightens his grip on Dean’s neck and, without further ado, harshly brings his hand down on the probably already cherry red skin again.
that is. He won’t ask.
Dean takes his robe from the hook, steps back out into the bedroom and, after making his way through the mess again, carefully lays it down on the ruffled blanket.
"Would you like to touch me, Dean?"
“No,” Dean hums, and for a moment there, Castiel feels his breath catch in his throat and his mouth go dry, seeing the end of his happiness already on the horizon. And then Dean continues with teasing and warm affection in his voice and a nuzzle to Castiel’s neck, “
The hard cock pressing against Dean’s shin comes as a surprise, as does the little rutting that follows, accompanied by a lack of kisses and an abundance of panting right against his now thoroughly wetted hole. Castiel only keeps grinding against Dean briefly, although he feels achingly hard and thick even through his dress pants. Castiel’s action seems less like an attempt to get off, more like a little break in reason, something to alleviate the pressure and need pumping through his veins.
But Castiel doesn’t allow him any reprieve or any time to get used to the feeling. He pushes his tongue in and pushes it out, fucks it in and fucks it out. His hands are in an iron-grip around Dean’s hips, holding him still as if he didn’t even have the patience to test out whether Dean would be true to his word and be a good boy, but that he unerringly needs to do this as much as Dean needs him to do this. Keep him suspended just like this, lips sucking on his entrance with a pressure that is beyond sweet, is
Dean digs his face into the cushion of the sofa, and if he could, he would do the same with his ears. He doesn’t want to hear this if he can’t object to it. Because it’s too much, he doesn’t know whether it’s true or not anymore, if it’s only Castiel being kind instead of honest. All of this is almost enough to break him out of the warm buzz tickling at his fingers and his mind and especially his erection, making him want to object and disobey. He doesn’t, though. The scene isn’t over yet, so he knows that he has to do what Castiel told him to; listen to whatever sweet things he whispers about Dean, and accept them. No talking back, no end unless he safewords out. It might be a harsher kind of torture than Castiel’s strikes were, and yet Dean still can’t help but crave it.
“Yeah, babe, fill me up,” Dean encourages him, savoring how much harder Castiel’s thrusts and his cock are getting, losing himself completely, along with any doubts and inhibitions, just allowing himself to be swept away by the crest of his pleasure, his words flowing freely. “Lemme feel it, make me yours. Show me that I belong to you, no one else, only
(Not abandoning him, not giving him up for anything or anyone better. But being there for Dean once more, just because he asked to, just because he wanted to.)
And Dean knows that if it were still last night, that very same gentle tone would have been followed by an abundance of praise and confident touches, by thanking Dean to have been honest about what he wanted. But sadly, there is none of that now. Well, ‘none of that’ might not be entirely correct either, because Castiel’s expression looks like all of those soft words sounded, pleased and proud, and even if he doesn’t, he looks like one second away from slipping into words of praise again. But he doesn’t, just keeps on smiling at Dean all affectionately, and it should probably be enough.
“I know it won’t. Because if it did, there would be no spanking for you. What I would have you do would involve no touching at all,” Castiel darkly promises. “For your punishment, I would make you sit at the other end of the couch, as far away from me as possible, and make you touch yourself. None of my fingers on you, only my gaze, as you would have to bring yourself off. And I would do the same, from my seat here, while I watch but never let you touch me. While I would never touch you.”
