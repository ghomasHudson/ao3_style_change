Adam patted his arm in sympathy but stayed silent, something that Dean was thankful for. They found their station easily and began to set up what they needed. Dean cut the apples while he had Adam start on the dough for the crust. They worked silently for a bit before Dean started to explain to Adam the importance of a flakey crust and how to make the perfect crust from scratch. As they worked others started to filter in and they had just set aside the dough for the crust when a sound caught their attention.
There was just the slightest waver in Dean's voice and Castiel could hear him swallow thickly. Taking advantage of Dean's distracted state Castiel twisted and grabbed Dean's wrist, swinging them around and pinning Dean back first up against the door. He slotted a knee between Dean's thighs, pressing up gently as he leaned in to whisper in the Omega's ear.
Heaven was much better than Dean remembered. He enjoyed the fact that all the walls were torn down and it wasn't just a repeat of the good times. He also enjoyed waking up each morning cocooned in Cas's wings while Emma and Jack slept soundly in their beds. The quiet moments before the two young beings filled the homey cottage with the sounds of life were some of Dean's favorites; filled with soft kisses and whispered adorations between he and Cas and leaving him feeling at peace with himself and those around him.
"It never came up."  He reached up and rubbed the back of his neck, sneaking a look at Jimmy from the corner of his eye.
"Instead of us going after him individually, we work together to seduce him. Why make him choose when we both want him and we can share."
Castiel's hand was a slow counterpoint to the images that his words conjured and Jimmy was so close to climx again that he was sure that if Castiel kept speaking he'd cum for a second time in less than an hour. However time or perhaps luck wasn't on his side and a knock rattled their trailer door.
"First things first. Do you know anything about BDSM?" He nodded as Dean shook his head. "What about Domination and Submission?" When Dean shook his head again, Chief made a surprised sort of sound. "Alright so the actual Websters Definition of BDSM is Sexual preferences and behaviors involving physical restraints, an unequal power relationship, or pain. Including but not limited to including the practice of bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadomasochism, etc.  It's basically an umbrella term for anything that falls outside of what people consider the normal scope of sexual activities. It also means because there are so many variables that anything between you and your partner needs to be negotiated. You need a list of what your hard limits; or absolute never going to happens; are as well as things you would like to explore and what you're totally on board with. You with me so far?"
"Well I thought so at first..but then I noticed something I had overlooked before. Dean's scent had changed, it was so light a shift that I double guessed myself at first. And then once I noticed it I realized that Dean was suffering from Forrest Sickness."
Rage curled in the pit of his stomach at Sam's words and he took a step closer before a cool hand on his shoulder caught his attention. Looking over with his teeth bared in an attempt to warn off whoever it was touching him, was Henry and the elder Omega shook his head.
"My apologies for the rude welcome. But we want to keep everyone safe here, we don't make it a habit to just let anyone into the mansion. My name is Gadreel. I am one of the security here as well as a Heat Companion."
"Castiel there's....there's just not a lot to go on. Dean was here yesterday and then gone today. And there's nothing here to suggest foul play." Charlie interjected softly.
Dean's voice was falsely polite, only his eyes showing any real inclination of how he felt. They stood there in awkward silence before it was broken by loud pitch wail. Startled by the sudden noise Castiel looked over to where a young boy was sprawled out on the ground holding his knee while Claire looked down at him. Concerned he started towards the two, not really noticing that Dean was instep with him until they reached the two children and Dean dropped down next to the boy.
"Sure was. At least now I know that your uncle was lying about it getting wrecked beyond repair. And even if it did, your Oma can fix anything." Castiel shot Dean a smile even as the Omega narrowed his eyes at him.
He grinned as his words sent a shiver through Dean; his eyes fluttering shut on a groan as his hips rolled out of reflex. It only took a few minutes before they found a fluid rhythm; Jimmy rocking with slow, precise thrusts that pushed Dean and himself together firmly. The air between them was simmering, punctuated by growled whimpers and panted expletives. Dean's head was tipped back against Jimmy's shoulder as he allowed them to use his body the way they wanted. Identical smug smirks graced their faces as they simultaneously sped up their movements both seeking the mountain top they'd been chasing while Dean worked to meet them. Dean's body was writhing and rocking with what seemed like no rhythm but provided perfect friction for both him and Jimmy.
"One of the worst in a long time. I had to give him a light sedative to even get him to calm enough to let the nest do it's work."
"Well first off, God is five so he has nothing to base anything on currently. But the old God..well he definitely didn't care. He liked both."
added tags, Angst, Misunderstandings, Castiel and Dean Winchester need to use their words, Michael is a little shit,
"We're not going to split up Alfie. Your Oma and I...we just had a disagreement in which I was in the wrong to begin with." He huffed out a sigh. "Your Oma was protecting his pups, you and Lucas, from me."
"Back up. You don't want to be too close for this." He murmured, his eyes transfixed on his grandsons.
A grin flashed over Gabriel's face as the warmth on Castiel's cheeks heated up once more. He was in for a long day, he could already tell and yet the mental image of Dean in his suit, eyes sparkling and lips stretched in a smile made it all worth it. Even if in the back of Castiel's mind another image started to take shape; Dean with his vest open, skin flushed and head tipped back with his eyes closed and looking completely debauched.
"Dean hates the term Pining Sickness, he feels it has negative connotation, as if the one suffering from the infliction can't do anything without this other person there for them, makes them seem weak. So at Moondoor we call it Forrest Sickness."
He gave an exaggerated wink before whispering back to her. "Don't worry, you have my word. I won't tell her, she still scares me." He laughed before blinking. "Benny works another job too? Does everyone at Moondoor have other jobs?"
"Dad..I died of old age because of Dean." Sam pointed out, his lips pressed thinly together as Cas did the same from his spot behind John.
All the doors were closed but the very last one showed just the slightest crack between the door and the jamb. With a growl he pushed it open, stopping in his tracks when his eyes landed on Dean. The Omega was nude and sprawled out on the bed, his eyes golden and hot where they touched on Castiel. In the back of his mind he remembered Benny and Gadreel saying that Dean didn't want sexual contact during his heats, that Dean tried to castrate Benny the one time he tried. Slowly he took steps towards the bed.
The scent trail ended at a nondescript door and without waiting he yanked the door open his eyes flashing red at the combined smell of Dean and Jimmy that coated the room. His anger was somewhat assuaged by the sight of his brother lying--fully clothed--on the bed. Even from the door he could see the swelling on Jimmy's jaw and he took twisted satisfaction at it. Stalking over he grabbed the front of his brother's shirt and yanked him up, shaking him as he growled.
"Emergency call at the station, Sam is coming to pick us up. He said to tell you that you really did look rather spiffy in your suit."
His words were cut off by Meg grabbing his face and turning his head so that he could see between the books she's moved out of the way. Words and breathing failed him as the spines of the books framed a broad shouldered back clothes in a charcoal grey sweater vest while dark green sleeves wrapped themselves around equally strong looking arms. Light brunette hair was combed over to one side before tapering down to close shaved sides and as he watched the man turned and his mouth went dry. The man had to be the most handsome person he'd ever seen; he had a square jaw with a sharp jaw line that was slightly stubbled and bright green eyes that were encircled with gold wire frame glasses.
Sam hummed sadly, both of them knowing deep down that they were grasping at straws. As the morning wore on the anger took a deeper root and Castiel was barely resisting the urge to snap and growl at everyone, Meg and Gabriel included.
"Gabriel I'm not judging you. You know that right? But you scent bonded quickly with an Omega you met in a bar. And that was a year and half ago. You know nothing about the Omega other than first name and that he had "eyes greener than emeralds left in the sun" which while is descriptive isn't anything to you can search for online."
He'd just made his fourth tour of house trying to find anything that would point him in the direction of his family when he heard the click of the lock on the front door. Rushing he skidded into the front hall as Samandriel and Lucas came through the door, Ben, Emma, and Jack juggled between them. Smiles wreathed their faces until the scent of distressed Alpha wafted to their nostrils.
"While you're not wrong, he's got all the paperwork on the Omega's line. This line is a warrior line, they were exiled from Ireland and made their home here in the States, stayed under the radar but kept to the old ways. The last two were strong enough to impregnate their Alpha female mates. This last Omega has not fathered or carried any pups to any knowledge so to the highest bidder goes the prestige of furthering this Omega line."
Standing in the dimly lit, graffitied walled outer room of what looked to be a warehouse Dean felt extremely out of his element. In the pit of his stomach he had the sudden unfurling dread that the two old men at the theater tricked him. That feeling only grew as a door off to the side opens and the shadow of a tall man falls over him. Blinking Dean doesn't know where to aim his gaze as he takes in the leather vest and pants that seemed to be more molded on than wore, to the dual chains around the man's throat and then finally it lands on the leather flogger that the man was swatting his hand with. Chief indeed.
Gabriel frowned as he watched the gears in Sam's mind turn in a bid to find a way to turn Gabriel's words back on him. When he couldn't he sat in fuming silence.
"G-O-N-E. Gone. Clarence and I showed up to his room and found Jimbo knocked out in your brother's bed."
"No need Tweetie Pie, he lasted longer than I thought. John was not the most level headed, it only makes sense that his son would be the same way. I remember when I came over to bless the wee lad, John tossed me out on my arse before I could even touch the wee one. He's got the angry warrior's soul and though he tries he can't stop how it manifests." She got up and patted his shoulder  a small smile on her lips. "Go to him my dear and fix this divide between you. You don't realize it but it's affecting your entire pack."
"A couple of the Omega's that you've helped have come through here. The tales they tell...damn. You've done so much good Cas."
Castiel nodded as he felt his cheeks flush again and idly wondered if he had blushed more today than he had before but he pushed away the thought as he kept his attention on the man next to him. It seemed as if even with the years apart Dean was still able to read him, something that Castiel wasn't sure he was as grateful for as he was for it when they were younger.
"To find the magic user of course." Rowena's tone was flippant as if she'd expected them to understand and when she looked over and seen their blank stares looking back at her she sighed. "Do you know nothing of your heritage?"
"Just wait until it's all healed and I can suck your cock. I'm going to edge you for hours just by playing with it before I fuck you into the mattress."
The moment was shattered by a loud knocking on the door, causing Dean and Castiel to move out of each other's personal space quickly with Jimmy catching the younger man discreetly adjusting himself in his jeans. Scowl in place Castiel pulled the door open, blinking silently down at one of the other P.A.'s that had been sent to grab both he and Jimmy and bring them back to set.  With a curt reply Castiel sent him on his way before shutting the door in the poor P.A.'s face.
"Gabriel I don't know what you mean. I can't tell you anything if I don't know what you're talking about."
"Well, well, well. A family reunion without little old me? I'm offended." She tsked before arching an elegant eyebrow at the large wings folded behind Dean serenely. "Seems as if I missed a lot."
"His scent would all over your clothes, but this..." he nosed the soft skin behind Dean's ear again. "This is scent marking."
Both he and Jimmy turned to her, growling low in their throats at her. He watched as she rolled her eyes at them again before planting her hands on her hips and giving them a flat stare.
Friday turned out to be a lazy sort of day for the most part for Castiel, he spent a majority of it exploring the town, revisiting some of his old haunts and catching up with any old friends he'd come across. He ended up spending the late afternoon and evening hours sipping coffee at Gabriel's shop and just watching as people came and went. Twice Dean had wandered into the shop, the first time ordering coffees to go and the second time for a piece of pie that he then sat down and enjoyed while talking to Castiel. The banter was easy flowing as if they hadn't spent the past nine years apart or that anything traumatic had ever happened, they were just two old friends shooting the breeze with one another.
As of on autopilot Dean moved over and took a seat, his hands resting on his thighs as he tried to even out his breathing.
They looked at one another, nothing and everything now changed between them. Silence settled over them but it wasn't uncomfortable and that was how Dean, Amelia, and the children found them when they returned. For the moment they decided not to say anything, they wanted to do more digging before bringing it their families; especially Gabriel.
It was an innocuous offer but Castiel was a professional at reading between the lines and he offered his brother a small smile in return. With a nod Gabriel returned to his place behind the counter leaving Castiel to his thoughts.
Dean hummed softly as he leaned into Castiel's feather light touch, the mood having palpably shifted from frantic and lustful to something else, something softer. Castiel risked a look down, certain that he'd find some uncomfortable expression washing over Dean's face but was instead surprised to find that Dean had his eyes closed in contentment like a spoiled cat; in fact he was positive that if Dean could purr the brunette would have been. Smiling softly Castiel let his head tip back against the couch as he carded his fingers through Jimmy's hair gently.  The moment stretched on to the point where Castiel was sure that the two men at his feet were asleep and as loathe as he was to move he knew he needed to get them into a more comfortable location. Gently he tugged on Jimmy's hair, watching as the kneeling man blinked up at him sleepily.
I'm not 100% happy with this chapter, but this is a needed chapter. And don't worry our favorite pita Michael will return shortly. Also for intents and purposes, this Michael is Matt Cohen's Michael, not Alt!world Michael.
Still grumbling he packed the pizza into one of the insulated bags before heading out to the delivery vehicle. It was an ugly old gold Lincoln, but his brother was adamant in using it said that it helped deter thieves. Gabriel wasn't sure that was true, he figured his brother was just sentimental and didn't want to let the car sit and rust away to nothing. He eased himself behind the wheel and took a moment to fix his hair before resettling the hat back on his head.
"Alright, inside so I can get a look at those wounds." Dean stated as the sound of the last exhaust died away.
He didn't remember much of Mary, she had fallen sick when Sam was young and never recovered. The only real shift was one day Dean was free most of the time to spend time with him but then the next he only seen Dean at school and when he'd pop over late at night to make sure Dean was ok. Castiel was shaken from his thoughts by the sound of Dean's voice and it was only then that he realized that had made their way to the old gazebo.
As soon as Arthur realized he could move he backed up and all but ran out of the shop; the door slamming closed behind him. Only when he was sure that Arthur was gone did he allow himself a laugh. Looking over he seen Gabriel staring at him with his mouth open and he could only laugh harder. Once he calmed down he leaned against the counter, one hand flat on the top and his other arm akimbo on his hip.
As they exited the vehicle their eyes caught over the roof and for a moment they just stared, nothing else in the universe existing besides themselves. The noise of a passing car broke the spell and with dual cleared throats and flushed faces they moved towards the house, Dean peering over his shoulder as he unlocked the door.
Sweaty and exhausted Castiel turned them on their sides, throwing one of Dean's legs over his hips and the other between his legs as he ran his hands up and down Dean's back and murmuring soothing nonsense in his ear. He felt Dean's breathing even out and he smiled to himself as he nuzzled the top of Dean's hair before he felt himself drift off.
"Cocks away and clothes on! Time to earn those ridiculously large paychecks." Gabriel called through the door. "And LaFitte is looking for Winchester. You could say he was LaFitte to be tied when he found out Dean wasn't where he was supposed to be."
"When Dean came home the first time, he didn't have a scent, we were worried that maybe they'd somehow removed the gland or impeded the scent making components of his gland. But it turns out that Dean can turn it off.  We don't know how and he's never told us how exactly he does it, but there are times where he just...shuts it down. But it hasn't happened in so long we thought it might have just been stress from the ordeal."
"We do. I am Samael, a lesser known Angel of Death and in charge of much more grim and destructive duties. Many equate me with Satan or Lucifer himself. Though I am not. I am Gabriel, Archangel and Messenger of God's mate."
"Today Balt, we have other things to discuss today." Gabriel cut in, well used to Balthazar's rambling ways.
“I have a lot of practice.”  Dean huffed before he took advantage of the distraction and plucked the paper from Castiel's grasp, tucking it away in his books and then gathering them up and shoving them into his bag.  “I..uh, I’ll go to the library for a bit. But you go enjoy that band, maybe find some company for the night.”
Rowena rolled her eyes and pulled out her own phone, typing out a quick message before turning her attention back to him. Castiel barely suppressed a shiver as he felt her eyes on him like a physical caress. A soft snort let him know he wasn't as successful as he'd hoped.
"Now looking at you, and please tell me Dean if I'm way off. You're not one for impact play; which means you don't like being hit or if you do not excessively. Am I close?"
"Because yo're patient, kind, and you just understand how he works. You always have, even back in the day you just seemed to get him."
"Do you want me Omega-mine?" He teased as he ground against Dean; his cock leaking in a near constant stream and adding to the mess coating Dean's thighs.
"How can people be so cruel? I don't..." he growled softly. "I don't get it. How can you just not care about your child's well being. Is he..did he manifest Omega?" The last sentence was said softly as if by whispering it it wouldn't make it true even though thoughts of Dean and others that had manifested Omega still circled in the back of his mind.
Once they were out of earshot Jack turned his attention to Castiel; his head tilted to the side in a perfect imitation of the older Angel's signature move.
"What the hell Cas?" Dean demanded, his eyes no longer the molten gold of arousal but the hard, sharp gold of Omega rage.
"Your brothers said you were looking for me. I figured it must be some sort of emergency if you were actively  seeking me out."
"You're a good Alpha Castiel Novak. However I don't share and it'd always be you. Jimmy is a nice guy, I'd like to get to know him but he's not you. He doesn't have that same wild streak you have." This time Dean's voice dropped to nearly a whisper. "He doesn't make my Omega sing."
"So I managed to get onto the ip address server for the local area and since it's not even been 24 hours all video's taken are still available. There aren't many cameras in the area. Seems like having the town Sheriff living on the same street makes them feel safer, but there were a few, and some that were locked down but even then it only took a few attempts before I could get in. People and their weak passwords, as if that will stop the Queen from getting the information she's seeking."
"A prism. It breaks up the invisible spectrum of light as it passes through it and makes certain colors visible. Though you being a half Angel you might be able to see more colors than we regular humans can."
"That's all I need, the two of you ganging up on me. It's bad enough when Sammy gets Gabe on his side." Dean scowled as he dropped down into Castiel's chair.
He and Benny traded cold smiles, their eyes speaking the volumes they wouldn’t give voice too; at least right then anyway, who was to say what would come to light if they found themselves alone at some point. The chilled atmosphere between them seemed to finally register with Dean, the blonde man arching his eyebrow at them before turning away to start back to set. Castiel let the two men get a few feet away before calling out; a half formed thought swirling in his mind.
"Alpha?"  A sleep drawled voice caught all their attentions and they turned as one to towards it. "Adam?"
"I shall only be a minute, please make yourself comfortable. I think I have just the thing, but your thighs my dear man..I might have to make a few alterations to accommodate them."
Castiel nodded as he leaned against the structure, looking up at Dean. He wanted to ask after Dean's plans, if he wanted to have pups in the future. His inner Alpha squirmed at the thought and he shifted at the image of what his and Dean's children would look like. A low growl built up in his throat and he fought to squash it before it could escape.
All eyes turned towards Henry and Castiel felt his stomach start to roil. Sam's brow furrowed harder as he stared at his grandfather and Castiel could practically taste the confusion rolling off the other man.
"Hmm? Yeah. Just been sitting here too long I think." He muttered, rubbing the back of his neck and keeping his gaze down on the table top.
As one they shook their heads, Dean moving back even more and taking a seat next to him, his hand coming to rest on his thigh as he stared at the redheaded Alpha.
He quirked his eyebrow at Dean, shaking his head at the unrepentant smirk on his mates lips. Like any time their gazes happened to cross it held and they were lost in the other's eyes, only breaking the gaze when Crowley cleared his throat.
"Don't hide from me please." He pressed a kiss to the juncture of Dean's throat and shoulder, nipping gently. "I can't help you if you don't let me."
Still they stayed hand in hand until they came to an abrupt stop, Samandriel stood stock still. It took them a moment to pick out what the young man was eyeballing but once they realized there was a mixture of reactions.
He sat his cup in the sink, leaning against the counter. "Well I wanted to check out Charlie's book and game store then look around the rest of the town. See what's new. Get myself a hotel room for the duration of my stay." He arched his eyebrow at Gabriel, a smirk playing on his lips, leaving the two men standing in the kitchen with red faces as he called over his shoulder. "You two are loud."
The paperwork that Crowley had given him nearly a year ago sat heavy in the breast pocket of his trenchcoat, a reminder that he wasn't going to be spending the day with his family at the zoo. Instead he was going to sit down with Jimmy and go over their twisted family tree. Beside him Samandriel sat quietly reading and on the young Alpha's other side Dean rested with eyes closed and listening to the soft classic rock drifting through the speakers. Castiel's eyes drifted to the rear view mirror and he gaze lingered on the twins strapped into their car-seats and Jack in his while Lucas played quietly with his little green army men. The impala smelled of content family, Alpha and Omega combined to create an entirely knew scent, a scent of home and happiness.
The scent of sun warmed peaches bloomed thick in the room suddenly and Castiel pulled Dean into his arms; tucking Dean's face into his throat and motioning for the others to leave. Quietly they filed out, Gabriel popping back in with a small plate of the after nap snack before ducking out again. Once the door was closed tightly Castiel pulled away slightly making soothing noises as Dean whine softly. Lacing their fingers together he lead Dean over to the leather couch that sat in the corner, pulling the hand made quilt off the back as he moved. He then settled down, pulling Dean into his lap and positioning them until they were comfortable then covering them with the quilt.
"He's not entirely wrong..after all Gabriel called you a big bag of dicks if I recall..." The voice was low and could be technically considered a growl but it bounced off the other man, the tossed out words not even enough to bring forth a tiny pinprick of annoyance.
Though his voice had been soft it seemed to be just enough to break whatever spell had descended over them and he watched a deep red flush crawl up Dean's throat.
He thought as he followed his brother out to Sam's waiting car; the image for now tucked away until he was alone later to enjoy it.
I realized that I never did specifically say if Jimmy was single or not, but he is. Sorry for any confusion. Also trust me when I say that my muses have taken this ran away with it. What I thought was going to happened turned on it's head. But I another fic already in the works that will work better. So stay tuned for that. And Enjoy!
"Garth just called, said no one seen any strange vehicles in the area lately but that doesn't always mean anything since no one really notices anything strange or out of the ordinary unless it's affecting them. And people have to sleep sometimes.."
"Yes and no. You can have depressive spirals, or any number of symptoms really. Chest pains, bursts of anger. After care helps negate that but that being said it still possible to suffer from a light bout of sub-drop so it is always important to reach out to your partner and let them know. In our case, I'm going to give you my phone number and if you starting feeling off, I want you call me. It doesn't matter the time. Understand."
He felt Dean shift slightly and he pulled back just enough to watch his facial expression as Dean turned his head towards him. Their gazes caught and held, words not needed in that moment. Slowly he leaned in to press his lips against Dean's, giving Dean time to move away if he wanted and sighing when they connected. Under his skin his Alpha yipped happily, driving him to wrap his arms around Dean and hold him close, rumbling softly in order to help soothe Dean's frazzled nerves. They definitely need more time to talk but at least right then they were on the same page.
"I will I promise, but we have to get going. The longer we stay here the more danger you're all in."
They both stood there and stared at one another, Dean's cheeks heating as the other man arched an eyebrow at him; and damn if that didn't make his stomach flip in all the best ways. After a few moments; or maybe hours who knew really it wasn't like Dean was checking his watch; Dean cleared his throat and down at the paper he'd forgotten he had in his hand.
The tips of his ears turned pink and he moved to the side with a mumbled apology. Rowena waved him off as she brushed past him on her way towards one of the over stuffed chairs in the living room.
"That's it boys, you've been so good for me this morning giving me a wonderful surprise to wake up to. Go ahead and cum for me.." He purred before he nipped the bolt of Dean's jaw then pressed a panted kiss to Jimmy's lips.
He'd just rounded a rusted out shell of a car when he caught the sound of Dean's voice, the tone light and teasing.
The choking scent of skepticism came rolling off of Adam and Castiel couldn't blame him. After all here came a group of people where two claimed to be family telling him things about his father he hadn't known and from Rowena's information Adam's life hadn't been the easiest. His mother was a nurse that worked long hours, leaving the young Omega on his own quite frequently growing up. Still there was a tentativeness on the blonde Omega's face that gave Castiel some hope that this might turn out for them.
Castiel huffed, looking over at Dean as he tried to wrap his head around what he was going to say. Seeing the way Dean arched his eyebrow had him taking a breath and he glanced over once more before starting to speak.
With his eyes still closed he only startled slightly when he felt Chief's fingers in his hair tracing out nonsensical patterns. The warmth that had taken back over his chest started to fan out and he tried to keep track of what Chief was doing.  Time seemed to slow to a crawl and the awareness of what was going on around Dean started to fade as he felt himself drift off, his body starting to feel as if it were floating. One by one the chains of Dean's every day existence started to break away until he felt as if he didn't have a care in the world. Right then his world existed of only the soft feeling of Chief's fingers in his hair and the warm fuzzy floating feeling in his chest.
He typed the address into GPS and pulled out of the parking lot. As he blindly followed the automated voice he let his mind wander just enough that he wasn't a danger on the streets. Green eyes, soft brunette hair, and soft warm breath panting against his throat floated past his minds eye and he shifted in the seat as he felt himself start to plump up in his jeans. A chance meeting in a bar lead to a whirlwind two months that left Gabriel a mess when he woke up one morning and his...no the Omega was gone, only a note hastily scribbled left behind and his lingering scent the only markers that he'd even been there.
Stumbling forward Castiel rolled his eyes and moved back down the hall, his steps slowly slightly the closer he got to the door. The little flame in his gut suddenly turned into butterflies and he swallowed out of reflex. He knew on a subconscious level that he was passably good looking. He'd had plenty of offers over the years and more then a few romantic partners. But the thought of Dean seeing him in the suit made his whole body tingle with nerves.
Anger and pain colored Dean's scent and Castiel felt anger start to burn in his own stomach and he smelt his own scent turn burnt and sour with it. He wanted to reach out and touch Dean, offer a reassuring hand to the mans shoulder but he wasn't sure how his offer would be received. In the end it didn't really matter, Dean kept talking, his voice low and his scent tinged with sadness and pain.
The sound of steps stopped and Castiel blinked before the sounds of a struggle started. He came out from his hiding place and moved around the side of the trailer this time just to see Dean shoving Gabriel up against the side of another trailer, his voice low as he snarled something at him. Castiel knew he should be stopping whatever was happening but watching Dean manhandle someone that had a few pounds on him made a small flame of arousal flicker to life in the pit of his stomach.
The room was filled again with the sounds of clanking bake wear and chatter and Dean and Adam fist bumped before turning to their station and got started. Adam was tasked with the gathering of the spices as Dean strained the apples from the sprite he'd set the cut pieces in to keep them from browning as they worked. With a grin Dean mixed the spices with a healthy amount of the honey and then dipped a piece of apple in and handed it to Adam to taste. The younger boy bit into the piece and nodded, his eyes wide as he finished off the slice eagerly.  Dean set a couple more pieces aside for Adam to snack on as they worked to assemble the pie
Dean laughed, the sound wrapping around and swallowing Castiel until he couldn't help but join in. Soon the car was filled with the sound of their combined laughter and it was like stepping back in time; as if they had just left school and were making their way home or off to the library to study. He settled back against the seat, arms crossed over his chest as he continued to try and figure out where Dean was taking him.
"I know it couldn't have been easy. I've seen Omegas come through the clinic like that. It's like they're just a shell, a vessel. No purpose other than what they're trained to think and do or what they've been told to think of themselves."
"Dean's right, they've already sent Gabe. They'll send Crowley next, I can feel it." Jimmy piped up even though his voice sounded just as strained and breathy as Deans.
"Alright Sam, what else is wrong. While your father escaping is indeed worrisome, you'd be more enraged than this...whatever emotion you're currently expressing.."
The tilt from excited greeting to nervous inquiry made his heart constrict and he hummed softly before speaking. As much as he wanted to torment his brother--brotherly payback for all the torment he'd been subjected to through the years--he couldn't bring himself to do it.
Castiel felt his blood freeze in his veins before it started to boil and rush through his body, flaming the suddenly flickering flame in the pit of his stomach.  While John escaping was cause for some concern it didn't account for the wild eyed look on Sam's face or the rapid breathing.
Charlie laughed, though the sound was hollow, as she jumped up on one of her counters, swinging her feet back and forth as she looked down at him. Though she had laughed he could see a sadness lurking behind her eyes and wondered if that really went away or if she just had varying degrees of sadness that shone through.
He held still as Sam started to check him over, the younger Angel tsking over some of the scarred over patches on his wings where no feathers would grow again due to injuries inflicted by demonic weapons. He dilligently flexed each wing when asked as he checked over the movement. It was only when he felt Sam's fingers stop and touch the dangling gold bauble at the upper arch of his wing that he knew the second half of his surprise was found out.
They were saved from any further conversation by Bobby showing up and saying that they were going to shoot Castiel's solo coverage since Jimmy was still away on his errands. With a nod the three men followed after the director, Dean grumbling under his breath while Gabriel shot the younger man dark looks of his own. The argument between the two was pushed out of Castiel's mind as they started filming and didn't make a reappearance until days later.
A smile spread over Dean's lips, his eyes lighting up from within. "Imagine that, Gabriel's hyperness mixed with Sam's nerdiness. They'd be like Charlie 2.0."
He stood on the back deck, his eyes taking in everything and everyone around him. At the grill Jimmy and Dean stood debating the best grilling techniques, in lawn chairs not far sat Gabriel and Amelia going over orders for the bakery, running around the lawn was Sam followed by a practical gaggle of pups. There were Sam's own pup Mary, followed by Jimmy and Amelia's pup Claire while his and Dean's twins Ben and Emma toddled along behind them. Not far  stood Samandriel, a young Alpha that he and Dean had adopted before they found out Dean was pregnant with the twins, his bright blue eyes sweeping around the yard for threats.
Despite his fear that Bobby was dead he couldn't take his eyes off of the thing in front of him, a flash of blues and black flashing behind his eyes.
Dean cast one more glance at the dance floor and Castiel felt his heart rate start to speed up and wondered if maybe he had misread the other man. After a few moments he had started to let his hand drop but Dean squared his shoulders and took Castiel's hand, standing up and leading them to the dance floor. They moved between the other couples on the floor, their bodies slotting together easily as they started to move gracefully through the moves.
Suddenly Adam looked years younger as he looked down at Dean and Castiel felt his heart constrict painfully. What would have this young man's life been like if Sam and Dean had known about him, if John had been more present in his life. Would he have been sold off too? Or would have Adam's mother taken both Sam and Dean under her wing as her own and fought John? He felt Dean gently tug himself free from his hold and watched as Adam and Dean exchanged numbers, he even gave Adam Sam's number in case he wanted to call him to talk.
Pride swelled in his chest radiating warmth through him. His inner Alpha, which had laid dormant for so long that he wasn't even sure it still existed, howled in joy as it was overcome with the elation of having pleased Dean even as his lips stretched wide in a smile.
"I haven't gone anywhere." The words were gruff and Castiel watched as Dean's shoulders tensed. "I've been right where you've left me...left us...your family."
"Yeah? You call leaving us with no Alpha role model taking care of us?" Castiel ground his teeth as he took a half step forward.
"You're not going to hurt me Cas." For as out of it as Dean looked, his voice exuded calm and Castiel whined as he pressed his cheek against the hand that had reached down to touch him.
"Clarence you have a visitor." Meg stood just inside the door, her lips set in a thin line. "A Sheriff's deputy is here to see you. Must be new because I've never seen him before."
"Emma...I'm not accepting the part in that new Vampire movie. In fact I don't even like the fact that you read the books it's based on."
Meg's words cut through the sleep logged part of his mind and though he was blinking awake slowly he growled, his lips twisted in a scowl. Yawning he stretched, his back cracking loudly. Letting out a please sigh he stood, grabbing his carry on from the overhead and following Meg off the plane. After gathering their suit cases from the baggage claim they stopped at the rental car kiosk, Castiel fidgeting as they waited, his annoyance growing the longer the attendant took with the paperwork.
Dean stopped pacing and Castiel watched as his shoulders dropped down from where they'd been pulled up towards his ears.
In what felt like a daze Castiel allowed himself to be lead back to the room where he quickly changed into his clothing, his hands absentmindedly patting all his pockets to make sure that he still had everything.  When he returned to the main sitting room however Dean was gone, Gabriel having taken up his spot, a sucker dangling from his lips as he played around on his phone.
They came to a stop as they rounded the side of their trailer, the sight of Dean sitting nonchalantly on the steps sending the excited energy into a near fever pitch. A glance was all that passed between them as they closed the distance between themselves and Dean while nearly identical smiles graced their faces.
As if on cue the radio on Dean’s shoulder crackled to life a string of unintelligible babble came pouring out. It must have made sense to Dean and Benny because they shared a look before offering quick goodbyes and started off the way the came. With a sigh he watched Dean go, his eyes glued to the way the man’s uniform pants fit. The gaze must have been felt because Dean turned around, winking at him before turning back and disappearing out of sight.
He felt Dean shift in his chair and he pulled away, one eyebrow cocked with a smirk now on his lips and once more holding out his hand to Dean.
Gadreel's words trailed off and Castiel shifted in his seat, leaning up further onto his desk as his hands clenched and unclenched unconsciously. There were so many questions whirling around his mind right then but he couldn't seem to give voice to any of them. Thankfully Meg didn't seem to have that problem.
"Doesn't matter. No one wants to see that Queer shit. Thought the Big Guy himself was against that shit anyway. It's not natural, men belong with women so they can make children."
He leaned over and placed a soft kiss against the base of Dean's neck once more before shuffling back and positioning himself in a way that gave his tongue easy access to Dean's dripping hole. With a hum he began to clean Dean's thighs with long broad strokes of his tongue, the taste of Dean's slick and his own precum coating his tongue and slipping down his throat and leaving him feeling dizzy and harder than he could ever remember being. The closer he came to the furled ring of muscle the sweeter he tasted and the louder Dean's soft noises became.
And then Chief was gone and Dean was left sitting in the room alone; his brain starting to unfuzz and his body slowly losing the warm fuzzy feeling. Right as he felt shame and panic set in Chief stepped back through the door, a juice box in one hand and what looked like a candy bar and some beef jerky in the other.  Instead of sitting back in the other chair Chief took a seat on the couch and motioned for Dean to join him, not saying anything when Dean practically rushed to do it.
Dean smirked before heading around to the passenger side of the car, winking at him before sliding into the vehicle. Stifling a happy growl Castiel followed, sneaking looks at Dean out of the corner of his eye as they drove.
"If you want to Adam, you and your mother are welcomed to join us. There's Henry," Dean pointed to the older Omega. "Our grandfather, he's Dad's dad. Then Cas," He offered Adam a soft smile as he nosed Dean's throat again. "He's my Mate and we have 5 soon to be 6 pups. Sammy is mated to Cas's brother Gabriel and they have a pup with one on the way. Then there's Jimmy, Cas's twin who is mated to Amelia and they also have a pup with one on the way. Rowena here," Dean nodded his head towards the redhaired Alpha. "is a records keeper for Pure Lines, and she's hanging around for a bit it seems, but she's good people. Her son Crowley...he's a bit of a dick, but he means well..I think. Rowena and Crowley aren't pack perse, but they're around a lot." Dean took a deep breath as he pressed back into Castiel's hold. "I'm not saying you have to make a decision right now, but if you want...you have a whole extended family, and even if you don't want to join the pack, we're still here for you. You can come and go anytime you want, I'm normally at the Sheriff's office, Cas is either in his clinic or up at Moondoor's clinic helping Charlie and Meg, and Sammy is always in his office, though you can find Gabriel in his bakery."
"Yeah? Then what's he doing with you?" A smirk played over Sam's face and he rolled his eyes before shoving him.
Dean made an affirming noise in the back of his throat. "Yeah, plus he'll be family soon. I'll have to get used to scent at some point." He wrinkled his nose. "He's too sugary smelling and that's not counting the smells he brings back from the bakery...I don't know how Sammy can stand it. But he makes Sammy happy and that's all I really care about." He watched as Dean's eyes flicked over to him before Dean spoke again. "You though..you don't smell too sweet. Though I should have figured Honey would be in there somewhere. You and your bees along with the perfect scent of summer." The last sentence seemed to slip out on it's own, the tone soft.
Castiel switched his camera from Jimmy's camera to Balthazar's and watched as a flush crawled over his brother's face as he rubbed the back of his neck.
The voices were growing closer, the rancid scent of Alpha filling his nostrils and making him gag. He clamped his lips shut as he closed his eyes tightly, his hands clenched at his sides.
They followed him to the abandoned gas station where high pitched screaming overwhelmed him until he couldn't take it any longer. Despite the screaming he swore he still heard words though he couldn't place the language.  Even as he worked to make Bobby and then Sam believe that he was really him and not a demon copy or some other monster copy his mind was snapped back  to the abandoned fill up station. As he thought of the screaming he couldn't help but realize that he felt full, felt whole for the first time in as long as he could remember.
"I knew I couldn't kill my brother if it came down to it." He finally admitted quietly. "Another reason I'm glad that that he found his True Mate was I figured if we both showed up it would either end in the two of us fighting over you to the death. Or you'd either pick one, both or neither of us. I couldn't take that chance."
"Yeah. She's got your hair color and once she loses the blue pup eye color I think she'll have your eyes. She's got my appetite though."
Dean tried to keep his tone even, the smile on his face now as forced as it would be during school picture day. The man looked him over, grinning as he took a card out of his suit pocket and placed it on the counter.
"Sam! a-and Gabriel...they're my brother and...brother-in-law." Dean cut in, his voice higher than Castiel had ever heard it before.
"We'll all given in life what we've earned for ourselves. We might not believe it, or think it's wrong. But the universe knows. And you've helped so many since you were freed.  You've earned this happiness Meg."
“Anyway this guy is bad news. I didn’t like the look of him from the git-go so I had Ash do some digging. And this guy has been black-balled from nearly every other production studio. He’s a bad man Cher and I…and Ash…want far away. We don’t want our names anywhere near this bastard.”
"Yeah, I could see that. I'm just surprised Dean didn't see the major heart eyes you were throwing his way." Gabriel smirked as he arched his eyebrow.
"I've had Benny and Ash out doing surveillance at the house, but so far they've seen no one come or going. They're going to wait a few more hours to see if that changes and then I'm going to have them tail the two vehicles."
Michael's words from the front yard confrontation ran in circles around Castiel's mind and he looked down at the counter top, his cheeks stained a light pink. He tried several times to find a way to defend his behavior but there was nothing that he could say that made what he'd done seem less incriminating.
"Dean, James was wrong, is wrong. And I'm going to try and undo everything that he's done so far to Claire." It was his turn to step forward, this time taking more space away from between them. Gently and slowly so that if Dean wanted to pull away he reached up and cupped the man's cheek. "You are a good man, everything you do, you do for love. You raised Sam for love and I know you're going to raise Adam for love. The world could learn a lot from you."
His eyes snapped back to the now open door and the tall man filling it. He had short cropped dark hair and eyes that he couldn't tell if they were blue or green with lips that were drawn into a scowl as his gaze fixated on Castiel's face.
"Wait. You had these that long and you're just now telling me this?" Jimmy demanded; his voice taking on a hurt lilt and hurt starting to color his scent.
He gave a short snort. "They'll have to get to whatever/whoever it is before me if they want a chance.  But you're right. I just wish this trip had turned out differently, I really wanted you to tour Moondoor and get a feel for what they do."
He knew that his scent had to be choking the others in the van but he couldn't help it, every word out of Alastair's mouth dug deeper and twisted something more feral inside. As if listening from underwater he could hear both Gabriel and Meg trying their best to calm him but right then nothing was working; Castiel's entire focus was on Alastair and the many painful ways he was going to rip the man apart. His eyes narrowed as he watched Alastair move across the stage and motion to the wings, an oily smile on his face.
The words were said so softly that for a moment Castiel thought he'd imagined them, but the look in Gadreel's eyes confirmed them and he felt as if the world stopped turning.
It was in September the first time they met. A gladiator and a poor peasant boy in the midst of battle each fighting for their own causes.  The second time was also in September, this time a King and a knight of opposing sides meeting under the cover of darkness and making promises for eternity. And those were only a few instances of their meetings over the millennia of their lives, always so close but eventually parting and never realizing why they kept coming together or why they felt as if they were torn in half until they reunited. Except one of them knew and was doing nothing about it.
For a moment it was as if time stood still both of them staring at one another silently. Then slowly Dean's eyes dragged from Castiel's face down the length of his body and then back up; the action almost as intimate feeling as a physical caress while what looked like a blush started crawling up the side of Dean's throat.
As he was helped up and he pulled the other Angel close, wrapping him up in his wings and just holding tightly. Their wings folded together, their feathers meshing and creating a colorful tapestry of greens, golds, bronzes, and rusts. After a moment he pulled away, smiling widely, taking in the other Angel's crisp suit and neatly slicked hair.
“You have to! We’re made to be part of a pair! That’s what Father intended when he created us. We’re not meant to be alone!”  Samael’s voice was awash in anguish and their eyes were soft with sympathy.
"Dean will be safe Sam. I won't let anything happen to him." He bit out, his scent starting to turn sharp and angry.
Much like he'd done back at the trailer, Jimmy's breath caught and Castiel was afraid that the man's eyes were going to pop out of his head if they widened any more. There on the front page of the website Dean knelt naked and eyes closed with streaks of opalesque cum on his face with a small pool of it on his tongue.
"Why don't you take the day off? You were out late night and it.." his brother cast a look back at him before speaking again, his voice hushed as if he didn't want Castiel to hear him. "It wasn't a good one...you barely slept...surely they can function one day without you."
Mostly both men were blocking the other's blows, their teeth bared as they growled back and forth at one another. For the most part Dean seemed to be playing with Sam, letting the Alpha tire himself out.
"No! Respect for the leader of the Winchester pack, Sheriff, and co-owner of Moondoor." It was Samandriel that spoke, his anger evident in the thick smoky scent that swept through the room.
A sense of peace settled around him and he took a deep breath, pulling in the concentrated scent of Dean even as his tongue flicked out to taste the heated flesh. Above him Dean moaned brokenly, a hand clenching in his hair as he left teasing licks to the straining erection and a gentle kiss to the leaking head before he cleaned away the opalescent drops of pre-cum gathering at the slit. He then worked his way down, paying gentle attention to the heavy sack that was drawing up closer to Dean's body, his lips mouthing around them before sucking them into his mouth gently and then letting them pop back out.
Castiel blinked as he tipped his head to the right wondering if he was imaging the way Dean's gaze flicked between his eyes and lips over and over again.
The words were said sarcastically and with an eye-roll. Huffing with an eye-roll of his own he started up the stairs, rifling through the medicine cabinet, under the sink and through the linen closet until he found what he was looking for--burn cream. With cream in hand he grabbed a gauze wrap as well and returned the kitchen, nodding to one of the chairs.
There was a flurry of movement as everyone that was leaving claimed their spots in the cars and after a couple last minute directions from Dean took off; Castiel still standing with his gaze on the ground.
"Alright up you, lets get you fit. Thankfully you're not as tall as Squirrel but you're a bit more built all around. Still shouldn't be too hard."
With all eyes turned to him, Gabriel fell silent and Castiel felt sorry for him, for all that Gabriel thrived on attention, the shorter Omega was shifting from foot to foot as his eyes flicked from person to person. After a few minutes of scrutiny Gabriel finally let out a sigh; running his hand through his hair before speaking.
"In the old days, Pure Line Omegas could turn off our scents to aid in hiding if we felt threatened, keep us off the radar if we needed to not be found. The book didn't say if the Alphas were able to do it, but it was a quickly tossed out Pure Line Omega fact with not much documentation on it. I read about it in one of Henry's books he lent me."
"You know I thought Dean was an Alpha that morning, I always thought he would be he just had all the makings of an Alpha. And then when the two of you were scenting each other my stomach wanted to crawl up and out of my throat so bad I nearly choked on the feeling. Then later when I seen Sam scent mark you at the shop I became so angry thinking that you were sneaking around him." The tips of Castiel's ears were a bright red and he kept  his eyes away from what was undoubtedly the curious gaze of his brother. "Just the thought of Benny and Gadreel spending Dean's heats with him..." his sentence trailed off into a low growl as his hands clenched in his lap. "And I know that I have no right to feel that way, it just...it makes me so angry and I have to work hard not to react to it or let it show." He sighed, raking his fingers through his hair as he scowled off into the distance.
"N-no." He looked away, suddenly feeling shy. Taking a breath he steeled himself and looked back up. "When did you find out Jimmy wasn't me?"
"I guess it'll do. You don't look like a completely stuffed sausage. I guess though maybe Squirrel might be a better judge."
"When you thought you were True Mates?" Dean grinned as he looked over at him and he felt his cheeks heat.
"Shut it you Hobbit. Anyway...just hanging out all day is going to call attention to myself and people are going to notice when I'm here every day all day. If you want to keep me an uncover guard, then maybe I should be..employee or something along those lines."
"You're partially correct in that regard, you've been removed from the lineage, wiped from the books." Rowena stated, her eyes cold. "What you've done to your own flesh and blood is beyond deplorable."
Understanding washed over Chief's face and he nodded to himself before sticking the flogger into his back pocket and walking down closer to Dean. With every step Chief took Dean felt his heart rate pick up and by the time the man was right in front of him he felt as if Chief could hear the racing of his pulse.
The blond snorted as he ran a hand over his hair, unaware of the effect that his words had on Castiel. His brother was going behind Dean's back with Sam and apparently neither one thought anything wrong about it, if they had then Ash wouldn't have been privy to the affectionate displays.
He was dressed in a pair of hotdog lounge pants with a faded band tee with a white apron tied around his waist. He smiled as he made his way over and held his arms out for a hug. She smiled as she hugged back, rubbing her cheek against him and leaving a slight scent mark on him before she could stop herself. He grinned and then found himself caught up in a from Garth, the lithe man picking Dean up from the floor with ease. She watched as Garth left his own small scent mark on Dean before he put Dean back down and then let him lead them into a room off of the war room.
Castiel stopped pacing, his face set in a determined expression as he looked between Charlie and Meg.
Mornings were never Castiel's thing and he groaned as he shifted around in the lumpy guest bedroom at his brother's house in a bid to find a comfortable spot. He had just managed to find the least uncomfortable spot on the mattress and closed his eyes when all the air was suddenly driven from his lungs. He flailed wildly for a moment, tangling himself further in his blanket and then somehow tipping himself out of bed. With a frown in place he looked up over the side of the bed at his niece; her face schooled in an innocent wide eyed expression.
Castiel snorted as he ran a hand through his hair then leaning in to growl quietly in Jimmy's ear. "Oh don't worry, I have a few things up my planned out. You're still the responsible one between us."
Sighing again he push his phone down and leaned back in his chair, his eyes slipping closed. Behind his eyelids a well worn scene played out, his breath eased out on a moan.
"One large meat lovers pizza and one large veggie delight for...Michael...." His words trailed off as he finally looked up and right into the greenest eyes he'd thought he'd never see again.
He watched as his father's turned cold, the blue now ice as they stared each other down. It was a stand off to see who stood down first and there was no way that Castiel was going to be the one to give in first. Silence reigned between them with only the trilling of some far off bird in the trees. A rueful smile stretched his father's lips as he finally broke eye contact.
"Sammy tried to find out more, looked up old police reports and the like but found nothing, it was like Henry just stopped existing. They put Grandma Millie on trial thinking that she killed Henry and dumped his body but there was no proof. After they acquitted her, she and Dad left the area." Dean signed and ran his hand through his hair, his eyes focused on something off in the distance. "Dad never said anything about Henry or Millie, Sam and I only found out because we found a box up in the attic when we cleaned out Dad's house. It was like they never existed in the first place."
Her words did little to soothe the wakening flame in his gut and Castiel got up and started to walk around the room, his eyes straying back towards the door the two men had gone through more often than not. About halfway through his third trip around the room the door swung open and Dean stepped out first, his arms held wide as he looked over at Castiel.
"What's wrong? Something wrong at Moondoor? Or the Sheriff's office?" A small shiver started to work it's way down his spine as Sam shook his head. "Sam, tell me. What's going on?"
The sudden urge to override Michael's scent raged through Castiel's veins and he huffed low in Dean's ear as he wrapped his arms around Dean's waist to pull him close.
"You say that now, and while I absolutely do enjoy seeing you on your knees for me, if I let you sleep this way your back and legs are going to kill you tomorrow."  Castiel pointed out firmly even as he was softly petting Dean's head.
"Oh my god? Does this guy have golden slick?" Meg cut in with an eye roll. "He's got both of you wrapped around his little finger." She smirked as she leaned against the desk in the room. "He's going to have to teach me this power."
"N-no. He's..he's in prison...Sammy put him there." Though the words were slightly stuttered, the underlying tone was strong and Castiel watched as Dean brought his eyes up to look at Adam fully. "He was put away for Omega trafficking and he'll be away for a very long time."
"This was dad's car?" The young man's eyes seemed to go impossibly wider as he looked at the vehicle again.
"No, you listen here you selfish, egotistical, obsessed bastard! I took care of my family. I made sure Sam had food through any means necessary, I patched your worthless ass up when you were too drunk to hunt properly. I made sure Sam made it to school, that he had money for field trips and that we had money to survive on when you left for weeks at a time!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa there boss. I get you're into Alpha's which Alpha/Alpha, rare pair there, but Omega/Omega? Your porn search bar must be insane!"
The young boy nodded before his face shifted into a more serious expression. The voice that came from him next seemed to be more mature and Dean was certain it was more Amara than Jack speaking.
The sounds of boot tread drew his eyes away from his brother and he blinked owlishly as Dean stood in the doorway dressed in a Sheriffs uniform, the hat held loosely in his hand as he fiddled with his belt for a moment. His brothers comment on the phone now made much more sense.
The longer he ruminated on those twisted feelings and reactions the more he wasn't liking the answer he coming up with. Dean was his friend, had been his friend for as long as he could remember and these sudden new feelings could jeopardize it all and that was something that he couldn't allow. Besides they were going to be family after Saturday and that just marked Dean as even more off the table.
"Uh, well thanks for the update." He shifted slightly with a grimace as he noticed the state of the jeans he was wearing. "Uh, do you have something else I could put on, these is rather...uh.."
For the first few weeks all was quiet, Dean never even seen the person that was supposedly stalking Castiel and in that time he'd grown quite fond of both the brothers, Gabriel had no problem playing pranks on anyone and very often gave back ten times as much as he received made him Dean's favorite target while Castiel offered Dean moments of quiet introspection and always took his suggestions seriously and didn't treat him as just hired help.
Just as Dean finished his sentence John lunged at him but with one quick side step the older man did nothing but rush past the brunette. There was a flurry of movement where everyone tried to reach for John at once but just as suddenly as the movement started it ended and all eyes widened as a rift opened behind John and Rowena stepped through, her lips tilted in a sardonic smile.
“I can’t.” Came the snarled response, that followed a pouted expression and arms crossed over a wide chest.
The old nickname was said unconsciously but warmth still spread in his chest at hearing it. He took a deep breath, wincing as his chest protested the movement.
"Alistair is gone too. Both he and Dad are gone without a trace. There's no video footage of any kind from either facility since lights out last night."
"Of course he did. But yeah, we thought that his sweeter smell was to play off mine and he'd be the...Omega partner..."
"Angel..."  Dean's voice wavered slightly, his hands digging into Cas' hips hard enough to leave bruises.
Gabriel's question broke the silence and he looked over to see his brother staring at a picture of the them; Dean's arm wrapped around Sam's shoulders and Gabriel pressed against Sam's other side, all three of them smiling.
It was Castiel's turn to snarl as he crowded into Dean's personal space; dropping down to his knees and gently cupping the blonde's face between his hands. He rubbed his thumbs over Dean's cheeks, tilting Dean's head up so that they were looking at one another.  Like always they were caught up in their gaze, their breathing syncing as their eyes spoke volumes of words that their tongues wouldn't. All it took was one slight movement and Castiel was brushing his lips over Dean's softly before he pulled back slightly.
"Not an excuse." Henry took a breath before speaking again. "We'll speak more later about that. What this is however is that Dean was the pack leader, then when..when Dean was returned the first time and signed over to Sam's care  Sam became the pack leader. Then he mated and he went from a pack of two to a pack of three and he had two Omega's dependent on him. Though Dean is still recovering from the lingering ghosts of his past he's trying to take back leadership because he challenged you and Dean won't let that happen, he can't let that happen."
The disbelief in Gabriel's tone made him chuckle and he took a long pull off of his beer as he waited for Gabriel to process what he was hearing.
The next three days passed by them in a haze of knotting, soft touches and serious conversations. They caught up on what the other had missed in the nine year gap, some good, a lot bad, but by the time Dean's heat was over a lot of ground had been covered. Including how Dean had caused a slight sexuality crisis when Castiel had thought he was an Alpha and the real reason  Dean tried to castrate Benny.
A smirk passed over Castiel's lips as he rolled a shoulder in a nonchalant shrug. "Well he did turn out to be the funniest of the P.A.'s."
Turning his head he seen both Dean and Sam sitting on chairs near where he was laid out. Frowning he brought a hand up to touch his chest, noticing for the first time that his shirt was gone and he was wrapped in ace bandages. He looked over at Sam, glaring slightly.
Castiel tilted his head slightly to the side before nodding. "I like to think so, yes. Even after all the years apart...We grew up together...mostly. Dean is two years younger than me. We practically lived in the meadow down the hill. We actually spent a lot of time staring up at this house."
"Yes. But to make sure I think we should check his usual hide outs anyway. Sam you go and check his house, Gabriel your nest. Just in case. I'll go check the vineyard."
"My place?" Dean asked, his voice cold and even. "No one put me in my place except myself. And my place is leader of my pack."
"Castiel we don't have time for this. You have to get everyone out and now." Michael's voice had a panicked edge that was starting to bleeding into his scent.
"Deano we ain't leaving." Gabriel cut in, his arms akimbo on his hips. "I know you feel you need to protect us all, comes with being the pack leader and all, but we're pack and that means we protect each other."
"Look, this is a bunch of bullshit." He rolled his eyes as Sam made some "language" comment. "No, no. If you want to stay and listen to this then go ahead, but this is just is a bunch of nothing. There's no such thing of magic, or magic users. I don't know what she's getting out of this, but I'm sure it's all one big joke." He stiffened his back and started out of the room. "I'm out."
With a wide grin the blonde stood and looked around the assembled group, finishing off his drink before he started to speak.
"So I've come up with plan, I've made a ...new...friend in town the past couple of days and he gave me some information about tonight's auction. Jimmy and I are going in as plus two's for my new friend, we're going to pose as an Alpha/Alpha couple looking for an Omega to carry our pup. While we're looking around the main area, Benny, Sam, and Ash are going to sneak in through the back. According to my friend this event is catered so I figure you three can..acquire your outfits any way you see fit.  And finally, Charlie and Cassie are going to be in the van keeping an eye on all our cameras."
"Of course. Samshine has to have at least two cups and when Dean stays he normally requires a half a pot before he's functional enough to get dressed on his own."
"You know, I had one of these at one time. Drove it all the way up until I left for college. I then left it for your uncle to drive if he needed it."
"I was walking through the library looking over a syllabus for one of my classes when I caught the faint smell of..."Jimmy faltered, his face beet red before he continued. "...of home. I followed it and found Castiel studying by himself at a table tucked back in the back of the room."
Castiel tilted his head to the side and narrowed his eyes at his boyfriend. He knew Dean better than that and he knew that Dean knew that he knew Dean better than that. With a soft growl he backed Dean up against the door, his hands bracketing the brunettes head as he gently eased his knee between Dean's thighs and pressed up. A wince caught his attention and he pulled away concerned as he looked at the other boy.
Alastair pressed his foot down just enough to restrict Dean's breathing, laughing as Dean weakly scrambled at his ankle. Just as the black around his vision was working it's way closer to the center the pressure on his throat disappeared and he lay gasping for breath. He was so focused on trying to steady his breathing that he didn't realize that Henry had been let back in to be with him until he was pulled into the older Omega's lap, his face pressed against Henry's scent gland. For a while neither one said anything, Dean pulling the calming scent of his grandfather into his body and Henry lightly rubbing his hand on Dean's back.
"What's this?" Castiel tilted his head, watching them as the two took turns running their hands over his thighs while slowly inching their way upwards. "Are my boys impatient?"
Meg stood in the window and he took the opportunity to step out into the hall. He pulled a deep breath and leaned against the glass to keep from giving in to glancing back at Dean every few moments.
He had just slipped his shirt on when there was another knock on his door. Without checking he moved over and pulled the door open, counting on it being Meg and then walking away to try and tame his hair the best he could.
"I know I'm four years too late...but there's this..Harvest dance tonight. We hold one every weekend from September up to the end of October or whenever it's took cold to dance outside in the old barn here....but would you...and you don't have to I get it...but would you..."
"Cassie..." Gabriel's voice grew serious and another whine clawed itself free from his throat. "Cas...what's the matter? Are you ok? Are you with Dean?" Can you put him on the phone?"
"We'd love that." Jimmy offered as he took the script from Castiel and handed it over to Dean. "Why don't you take a look over the lines and follow us."
"Plus Cas has this super human ability where if he waits he can go twice as long." Jimmy stage whispered with a grin. "It's the Russian discipline."
Sam's scent now matched the worry on his face and Castiel found himself at a loss for words. Or rather the right words that wouldn't exacerbate this new problem.
So when Sam disappeared later that night and screeching started again he talked Bobby into summoning whatever it was, he needed to know what it wanted. As they waited he felt his stomach tie up in knots, something big was coming he could feel it.  The wind kicked up and suddenly he felt too big for his body, he felt as if he were going to explode. It was when the doors blew open that everything exploded, lights, some of the rotten wooden walls and colors. His knees buckled as he watched the being in front of him walk closer, the gain both familiar and foreign at the same time.
Castiel whipped around with a snarl but the anger dissipated almost instantly at the sight of her arched eyebrow and knowing smirk. Of course she'd been baiting him and he'd walked right into it. With a sigh he pulled down an extra cup and started filling the tea strainers with the loose leaf chamomile.
"Of course! Emma? We had a little girl?" Gabriel tried to keep a lid on his enthusiasm but just thinking about a little pup, the perfect mixture of him and Dean just sent his excitement into orbit until he was practically bouncing.
A wadded up shirt came flying his way and smacked Jimmy in the face; making him break out in a laugh. He tossed the shirt back at Castiel, snorting as it hit the other man in the chest. The shirt made a few more tosses back and forth between the two before Singer called for lunch. They passed a look back and forth before picking up the script and heading in the opposite direction of the set. They hadn't made it more than a few feet before they heard their names being called in a familiar cadence.
Loud cheers rang out and Dean lifted his flute, toasting the new couple. Taking a drink Dean sat back down signalling that it was his turn. Grabbing his own champagne flute, Castiel stood facing the newly mated pair.
There was a brief hug between the two before Dean got back to his feet and held his hand out to help Castiel up, a smile splitting his face and making his eyes light up. Standing as close as they were he couldn't help but catch a slight whiff of Dean's scent. It was clear that his friend had presented Alpha, something that he had never even questioned though it did send a slight arrow of disappointment through him. The feeling and following thoughts caused him to startle and he pushed it all towards the back of his mind, deciding to think on it later when he had time to do so. Dean's scent however seemed off, fake in a way and he tilted his head as he surveyed the man in front of him. He looked healthy, there shouldn't be a reason for him to smell of artificial Alpha scent, unless he wasn't as healthy as he seemed.
"What about me? I'll keep on keeping on. I'll stay working at the Salvage yard and the garage in town. I won't let anyone stop me from providing for my family."
"Why'd he hit you? What did you do?" Castiel asked, his voice moving from growled to low and dangerous.
"I never pegged you as one to make these grandiose overtures of self sacrifice. Seems like something more in the Winchesters wheelhouse. But then again you've always had a rather inflated sense of importance haven't you Kestrel?"
His fake smelling scent from before seemed to disappear; in fact Castiel couldn't pick out any scent at all as Dean moved past him. He nodded as he watched Dean climb into the gleaming black muscle car that he dimly remembered as belonging to John back when they were younger, and pulled out of the driveway.
"What's wrong Dean?" He murmured as he continued to torment the skin, gently nibbling at that point.
Soon they were pulling up in front of the reception hall both of them huffing softly before getting out of the vehicle and straightening out their clothing. He was smoothing down a few errant wrinkles from his suit jacket when he felt eyes on him again. Looking over the roof of the car he caught Dean's gaze and he cocked his eyebrow in response.
"Si, Si compadre.  Give me a few minutes to scrounge what we have pre-made and then you'll be on your way."
"Not here as in in your house you lump. I'll be staying in town, most likely with Fergus. Once a week I'll be seeing the pups for lessons on their history and teaching them about their Pure Line heritage." She arched her eyebrow at the two of them. "It also wouldn't hurt the rest of the pack to sit in and do some learning either you know. It'll help you understand the pack dynamic you have and maybe yourselves a bit better."
"Missed you Alpha." Dean huffed softly as he rocked up into Castiel's thrusts, his nails digging into Castiel's back while his legs wrapped around Castiel's  waist.
Castiel looked away only to find that his brother and the blonde Omega had disappeared and he felt his inner Alpha give a happy yip. He honestly hadn't been looking forward to fighting his brother for Dean. The whole custom was barbaric and outdated but he knew it would come down to it between them, he couldn't see himself sharing with Jimmy as just thinking about it put his teeth on edge. Besides he didn't  want to hurt his brother and he knew without a doubt that he would. After all one perk of growing up with the Winchester boys was they taught him how to fight like a Winchester.
"Is this how you want to play it Cassandra? You think if you just ignore me I'll let you alone? News flash, it didn't work for Sammy Boy and it's not going to work for you. However I don't think you will be as susceptible to to the same tactics I used on Samantha..I'll have to get really..really creative."
Dean scrunched his nose and extended his wings, blinking when they brushed up against Cas's; the other Angel blushing slightly at the intimate contact.
Dean's hand rested over his and Castiel pressed a kiss to the slight slightly chilled skin. A frown twisted his lips, Dean must have been sitting that way for a while and he wondered idly how he didn't feel Dean move from the bed.
"Didn't stop you and Meg Masters from being the most talked about couple in school for the rest of the year." Dean grunted, his eyes still focused on anything else that wasn't him.
"I-I'll, sit next to you...I'm kinda heavy, don't want to break your knees." Dean joked even as his face heated.
After a week of the strange new normal Rowena and Henry came for a visit, both of them looking somber as they stood on the front porch while Castiel stared at them from the door. For a long minute he toyed with the idea of not letting them in but he couldn't come up with a plausible enough lie that would turn them away. Instead he made tea and waited in tense silence for Dean to come home. The Omega had taken to working half days and staying in the office if possible; something that Castiel's inner Alpha enjoyed to an extreme degree. Right at 12:30 he heard the Impala rumble up the drive and he stood, heading towards the door to greet Dean and try to give him some sort of warning.
With a light laugh he moved over towards the indicated cupboard, inhaling slowly as he drew close to Dean, his eyes drooping shut again as the myriad of the man's scent washed over him; blanketing him
"Down to your underthings please and then stand on the box, I'm going to take a few measurements and then see what I have ready made."
As he approached the archway every scent that had teased him since arriving wrapped around him and he closed his eyes as inhaled deeply again, letting out a small groan. Eyes fluttering open as he stepped into the large open kitchen his gaze landed on the only other occupant there; a sleepy, sweat pant and ratty t-shirt wearing Dean. For a moment Castiel just let himself take in the tableau before him, Dean leaning against the counter his hair tousled as if he had just rolled out of bed himself, his sweats riding so low on his hips Castiel was wondering how they were even still on and grumbling in sleep wrecked voice at the coffee machine to hurry up with the coffee.
"Nope, just been hiding here in this junk yard forever." Dean snarked before turning back to Samandriel. "Alright pup, if you're sure we'll get this hauled out and get started on the rebuild next weekend. Though your father took excellent care of this thing so it shouldn't really need much. Sound like a plan?"
He shook his head before waving her off. "Thanks Meg, I'll let the other Mr. Winchester know he can come up in a couple of minutes. We're just getting Dean into something other than his bloodied clothing."
Before Castiel could properly comprehend Balthazar's plan--which made a lot of sense--he surged to feet and snarled as he pushed into his friend's space.
To say that he was hiding behind Dean wasn't completely accurate; the Omega was taller than he was after all. But it wasn't until Sam disappeared into the house with a huff that he felt himself began to relax. He pulled in a shaky breath and swallowed as Dean turned around; his eyes darting over the Omega's face and his fingers itching to do the same.
"Yeah I do. I know I'm not easy to deal with on a good day but add in preggo hormones' and this bullshit with John and Alistair and I'm ten times worse. Any other Alpha would have walked away by now..or worse."
The downstairs was empty save for Dean's jacket laying over the arm of the couch. Trying not to worry Castiel moved his search to the upstairs. Nearly everything was undisturbed except for a busted window in a spare bedroom. The unease grew ten fold and his hands shook as he pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed Gabriel's number.
"He never left town Castiel. He's stayed here working those same two jobs. He's a loser and would have only drug you down with him."
"Of course. It doesn't matter if you can give me pups or not. We can always try but if we can't have our own we can always adopt." He nuzzled Dean's temple, his hand stroking gently up and down Dean's back.
Growling at himself he stepped under the warm water, rolling his shoulders and feeling some of his left over tension drain away. He gave himself a quick wash down, keeping his hands away from his rapidly rethickening shaft. After making sure he was completely rinsed off, he wrapped a towel around his waist, changing into his running clothes in the hope that he could run off the excess energy from his dream. Popping his headphones into his ears he set off, his mind focusing on the sound of his feet on the pavement.
The bell over the door chimed, grabbing everyone's attention to the new arrival. Standing just inside the door was the younger Winchester and Castiel's eyes widened as he took in just how large the other man had gotten. When he'd gone away to college the boy had barely been Dean's height, now he seemed to be at least 7 foot tall, if not taller. His hair was long, tucked behind his ears but his eyes were still the same soft hazel they'd always been. A quick, discreet scenting marked him as Alpha, though just looking at him would have told anyone that.
The words were soft and accompanied by a lift of his shoulder while he rolled his bottle between his palms. He wished he had a better answer but he didn't, he couldn't even pinpoint the moment when everything changed and he started seeing Dean in a romantic light. He drained his bottle, sighing softly before he speaking again.
They brushed lips again, parting as Dean pulled his phone from his back pocket and shooting off a text. They nuzzled each other once more and Castiel thought he could start to smell Dean's scent but it was gone just as quickly as the wind blew. He watched his mate walk away a small smile curving his lips before the turned back to his father.
When the lights flashed back on it was utter madness, Benny and Ash had Alastair pinned against the stage while Sam was trying to get Dean up out of his kneeling position while Henry knelt next to him, seemingly talking to him, his hands moving with his words. Then the view was temporarily blocked as Jimmy jumped onto the stage and Castiel hurried and switched his camera angle from Balthazar's body camera to Jimmy's just in time to pick up Dean's words as he stared up at Jimmy, his expression confused.
Castiel nodded, there was no other place he found he wanted to be that night and he promised himself that he'd examine those feelings later on in his own hotel room.
At one point the scene called for Castiel's character to get aggressive with Jimmy's and Castiel shoved at Jimmy's chest, sending him stumbling back a few steps. Dean jumped up and placed himself between the two men, looking between them before stumbling over the lines he had been reading. His words were an impassioned plea for them not to fight over him, that he wasn't worth ruining their brotherly relationship over and silencing any protest that either Jimmy or Castiel's characters tried to make. Jimmy watched as Castiel stepped up, one arm going around Dean's waist to tug Dean close and then lean in until their lips were almost touching, his words a low whispered plea for Dean to choose him over Jimmy.
"Dean you have to believe me that I had no idea. I just got back into town a few hours ago. I always knew that James could be an Assbutt, but I never thought he could be so cruel and cold hearted."
There were still no words uttered from the stoic man, his eyes expressionless and his lips pressed in a thin line. With a sigh Lucifer shook his head and seated himself in a chair off to the side, his feet propped up on the counter in front of them.
"Maybe but I will have the Winchesters keep tabs on them. They are the most capable humans I know when it comes to protecting the innocents."
“And what will you do if he remembers on his own during one of those times? How will you explain it to him that you let him languish there on earth without his other half?”
It was Dean’s turn to flush that time as he rubbed the back of his neck, his eyes dropping down towards the ground while behind him the other officer chuckled. Blinking he realized that he’d forgotten to ask the other officer’s name and he gave the man a small smile.
"At least he put out Alpha pups or one anyway. Not a complete failure." John sneered, though the ending was a bit choked as Sam adjusted his hold. "And then there's you." John spat, his eyes landing on Sam and narrowed dangerously. "What a pathetic Alpha you turned out to be, taking orders from your whore of a brother."
For a moment Dean could do nothing but stare and it wasn't until he felt a little dizzy that he realized that he'd forgotten to breathe. He pulled in a deep breath, his lips tilting down into a frown out of habit rather than actual annoyance. Before he could say anything Chief spoke again, his head tilted to the side slightly as he pointed at him.
"I guess that explains your current condition." Crowley commented with a smirk as his gaze flicked over the both of them.
Their gazes caught and held for a moment before they laughed, the sounds of their voices mingling pleasantly. A sudden flash caught their attention and both men turned at the same time to see Ash grinning at them, a camera held tightly in his hands.
"Ooh, I just figured this was a one time thing, y'know sleep with the porn star just to say you did it.." Dean murmured as he pulled away slightly, nipping the tip of Castiel's thumb lightly. "Not that I mind if that's what it was.."
She had slight knowledge of Rowena, she knew that in life Rowena was one of the most power witches and in death she'd become the Queen of Hell.  Just knowing that she wasn't the only supernatural entity there  helped ease even more of the nerves that were roiling in her stomach.
"I'm going to get you a juice and a little something to eat. Wait here for me ok?" When Dean nodded, Chief ran his fingers through Dean's hair again. "Good Boy, thank you."
Lower still he went until his tongue found Dean's slick soaked entrance. With a hungry growl he cleaned up the glistening trails from Dean's thighs, purring as the taste exploded across his tongue. Once he was certain he had gotten it all he drug his tongue over the furled ring of muscle, alternating between long broad strokes and soft kitten licks. The hand in his hair tightened, pulling him closer and he hummed as he teased the muscle gently, prodding just the tip of his tongue into the hole before drawing out and leaving a broad stripe over it.
He watched Dean back down slightly and he swallowed down the grin on his face, hiding his face against Jack when Dean turned to look at him over his shoulder. Their gazes caught and held for a few moments, Dean's eyes softening before he turned his attention back to Rowena.
"No, most of our Companions are there for hormone therapy only, we all take a special blend of herbs that helps control our natural responses to the Heat/Rut scents. We do however offer sexual services as well if the Omega or Alpha request it, but only then."
"Listen. Dean's right, he needs to stay. If what Michael says is true then that means Alistair probably has men watching the house and reporting back to him. If that's the case then if Dean leave and heads to Moondoor then Alistair is going to focus his attack on the facility and that puts everyone there at risk."
He was so engrossed with reveling in their scent that he wasn't actively paying attention to where they were going until Dean parked and killed the engine. Blinking he looked out the window and around the large area in front of them, his eyebrows drawn together before it dawned on him where they were and he laughed.
"Yeeaahh. Ash got on me about forgetting to call and let them know that you'd be coming with. Gads and Benny are rather fond of Dean, though I guess when you're a Heat Companion you don't really like others sniffing around too much. The fact they even tolerate each other is something rare. But I'm sure Dean has put them in their places more than once. I think they just try to out do each other at this point in the hopes that Dean will take a shine to one of them. Poor bastards."
"Calm down Meg." Charlie tossed out as she watched Jimmy and Gabriel stare at one another. "Why are you more concerned  with their...y'know...than you are about having more brothers?" She asked as she turned her sole focus on Gabriel.
Castiel watched as Gabriel frowned, his arms crossing over his chest as he followed Dean into the house.
"I was..you stayed with our..mother. I was farmed out to who I thought was my mother." Castiel's face twisted up in a scowl as he started to pace.
"You? Socialize? Who are you and what have you done with Castiel?" Jimmy teased; his words dying off into a groan as Castiel pinched one of his nipples.
"It's time for you to leave now." Jimmy bit out as he placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder. "Cas and I have things to discuss and you won't be here when our mates and pups get back."
"He's been hanging around Uncle Jimmy's and he tells us stories from when Uncle Jimmy was younger." Lucas supplied with a smile.
Both men's lips were pressed into thin lines as they spoke and once again he found himself wondering what had happened to cause the both of them to look that way.
As he planned out the twins' day he let his mind wander a bit; it was the first birthday that they were going to share as a thruple and the memory of how they came to be one snuck up on him.
Dean snorted and hip checked him, causing him to laugh. "Alright you big strong Alpha, you marked up the defenseless Omega."
Snorting softly Dean pushed away from the car, walking slowly with his hands stuffed into his jean pockets. Castiel followed at a distance, unsure of what to say, if there was even anything he could say. So instead he lent his presence, silently as he idly wondered if things might have had been different if Henry had not disappeared, if John had had both his parents instead of just his Alpha mother. He spared a thought or two on how Millie had actually raised John, what information she felt important to pass on. From what he remembered of the man, he was a Beta, nearly always drunk and leaving Sam and Dean home alone for long stretches of time. He remembered the moment he learned that Dean did all that he could to keep Sam fed and a roof over their heads and how dismayed he'd been knowing about it.
All eyes turned to the newest addition to the room, two pair silently judging, one pair roaming approvingly over his form and the rest watching curiously.
"I think I'm the man that's going to show you just how many times you can dislocate a finger before moving onto the next."
"You know, your safe word. You say the word and no matter what we stop. Or do you use the stop light method?"
"You're a good guy Cas. No matter what Gabriel says." She smiled as she reached out and patted his hand. Catching sight of her watch her eyes widened. "I didn't know it was that late. Want to join me for lunch at Benny's diner? He's got some of the best food in the whole area." She lowered her voice as her eyes flicked back and forth. "Don't tell Ellen that though. Her place is still the place to go for burgers and overall bar food."
He stood there staring at the piercing for a moment before he grasped Dean's wrist and pulled him close, kissing him hungrily. With a growl he nipped at Dean's ear, tugging lightly.
His nose scrunched up in annoyance but he had to admit that Meg had a point. Sighing he picked up the discarded coffee cup from the floor and tossed it into the trash before he ran his hands through his hair.
He cast a look at his brother before backing off and taking a few calming breaths. Running a hand through his hair Castiel started looking around the room, taking in the items it contained. It was then that he noticed the open drawers with clothing spilling out to the floor. There didn't seem to be too many missing though he couldn't be sure if anything had been taken or if Dean was just messy with his clothes.
“A few other videos showing off Colonel’s skills, his dancing, and just little silly things like this. Just trying to show the humanity behind the badge.”
"Quit harassing the help and get back to work. I know today is mainly cookie day and you've got most of them baking now but maybe some other baked goods today too."
There came a soft wafting scent of sadness through the room and before Castiel could place it's origins both Gadreel and Benny had moved over to Dean's sides and were gently rubbing his back, shoulders, and neck; each one marking him and pumping out soothing Alpha pheromones. After a moment or two Dean gently pushed them away, his face hardening slightly.
"Well..a Winchester by way of Milligan first." Dean cut in. "And like you have any room to talk about big families."
Dean tilted his head and tried to think of all his recent jobs but he couldn't place any of their faces.
"C'mon Cas, lets leave these two lovebirds alone. We can wait outside, it's early but it's warm." Dean called over his shoulder as he headed towards the front door.
“He’s been in a few movies with Dean. They have amazing chemistry together.” The sentence came growled from between clenched teeth.
"It's not a request Dean. Either I stay here or you go with us." Though his voice was firm it lacked the Alpha tone that he knew would make Dean agree and he bit back a smile as Dean glared at him.
"Dean?" He hurriedly searched the downstairs calling out Dean's name every so often, his voice growing more panicked each time. He rounded the corner, pulling open the basement door and shouting down into the darkness. "Dean?! Dean are you here? Can you hear me?"
"Such a pretty breeder, those Winchesters come from great stock. Even for an older Omega I wouldn't mind taking Henry for a spin."
"Under other circumstances yes. But I feel as if he's hiding something from me. I do however understand if you don't want to tell me since my brother is your employer."
The blonde was clad in a deep black suit; the lapels a shiny black that drew ones eyes towards the green vest that sat snugly against the man's frame and even going as far as accentuating the slight flare of Dean's hips. Tucked in behind the vest was a tie that was charcoal in color while a green pocket square peeked up out of the suits breast pocket. It was all Castiel could do to swallow, his tongue feeling ten sizes too big for his mouth at that moment.
Sam raised his hand, waiting for Castiel's approval before touching his forehead. A rush of feelings, anger, revenge, and mourning flowed through him, nearly bringing him to his knees. He could hear Dean's screams, his pleadings, he could feel the anger coloring his mates thoughts, the rage at their father and towards everyone around him. When Sam finally pulled his fingers away Castiel wasn't surprised to feel tears coursing down his face.
He snapped his fingers and the two of them were transported to a darkened kitchen where he and Dean stood toe to toe arguing about the coming war and the 66 seals. They watched as Castiel moved into Dean's space, leaning in and practically growling at the green eyed human.
It was a memory that was seared into his brain and always managed to bring a smile out of him. The sound of door creaking open caught his attention but he didn't turn around; hoping that whoever it was would let him alone with his thoughts. The sound of footsteps drew closer and he scowled as he turned around; his eyes widening and his breath catching painfully in his throat as Dean stood there smiling that mega-watt smile at him.
Alastair let out a sigh before he clicked his tongue at Dean. "What will I do with you? You were so well behaved before they removed you from Azazel. I worked so hard to make sure you were a properly obedient Omega and now...well now you're going to need to go through training all over again."
"Yes Cassie, mmhmm." Gabriel's eyes took on a playful gleam as he took a sip of his beer. "We all thought you two were banging it out back then. I mean you two were inseparable right up until you left for college."
There were pros and cons to dating twins and for the most part the pros out weighed the cons. Pro: Only one birthday to remember. Con: Figuring out how to spend an equal amount of time with them separately before spending joint time together. Pro: Double the manly holding (which is absolutely not cuddling, nope) at night. Con: One twin is a furnace and the other an iceberg. Still there was nothing in the world Dean would trade time with his boyfriends for; they filled a void in him that he never realized existed.
Dean fought the urge to reach up and loosen his tie a bit even though it suddenly felt constricting. The grin that quirked Chief's lips sent another zip of something down Dean's spine and he swallowed again as he tried to find a safe place to focus his gaze on.
“So how was your coverage?” He asked as he nosed the soft skin behind Jimmy’s ear and earning himself a soft shudder.
The pair jogged down the steps and over towards a newer looking Road Ranger that looked as if it would be more at home in the Sheriff's parking lot with the name of Gabriel’s Bakery painted on it.
He felt Jimmy’s jaw work but no words came out and Castiel didn’t have to look to know that that same dark red that stained Dean’s throat and cheeks earlier was present on Jimmy's face just then. With a satisfied grin he settled back, running his hands up and down Jimmy’s spine lightly. He hummed thoughtfully as  he worked his hand under Jimmy’s shirt and lightly thumbed the warmed skin there.
Bright red hair flounced into the room and even with his mouth glued together with peanut butter he couldn't help but smile. Charlie Bradbury was a force of nature and he sincerely doubted that anyone could withstand her infectious good moods even if they tried. His eyes slid past her when he realized that someone had followed her in and the peanut butter he'd been working to swallow suddenly got stuck in his throat as he tried breath and swallow at the same time. The end result was him choking and flailing around like chicken with no head.
"I'd seen him a couple times. Mom didn't know, she always tried to keep me away when he'd visit. The one time I remember the most was when their yelling match woke me in the middle of the night. I never let her know it happened, though I pretended that I only found his picture and wanted to know more." Adam was quiet for a moment as he packed what Castiel was handing him. "Do you think he would have sold me off too?"
A non to subtle throat clearing brought him out of his thoughts and he turned to find himself face to face with what could only be described as a walking wet dream.  Dark brown, nearly black unruly hair sat atop one of the most handsomely arranged faces--seriously did a god put this man together-- with the most striking blue eyes and plush looking lips he'd ever seen.
The being tilted his head, his eyes narrowed before they opened in shock. Slowly as if it were afraid of startling him, it reached forward with one dark iridescent wing. Without thinking, what Dean had thought was a blanket moved and he watched as another wing; his own wing; moved forward to mesh their feathers together.  A bolt of electricity jolted them both and they stared at one another. Colors sharpened as they moved as one and crashed their lips together, their wings folding around them to block them from the world.
"Soon soon. Like Friday soon. Apparently there's a high end Omega being offered for breeding. No purchase offers being accepted, but for the right price you can have the Omega's upcoming heat all to yourself." Her words were hissed lowly as her hands twisted in the material of her coat.
It was silent again and Castiel itched to do or say something to break it, even if it meant him getting up and just leaving. He was saved however from any sort of movement or speech by Dean speaking up even though the other man still wouldn't look at him.
The two fell silent as they realized that the war room wasn't as empty as they had thought; Charlie playfully ruffling Jack's hair as Dean patted the younger celestial's shoulder. Green met Blue and for a moment time seemed to stop; something that Castiel knew was not physically possible without outside interference and he currently didn't feel anything in the air other than a warmth from the way that he and Dean stared at one another. The sound of Charlie clearing her throat broke the gaze and Castiel could see the light flush of color over Dean's cheeks as he looked away; the red highlighting the dusting of freckles on his face.  After that Dean was hurried out of the room by Charlie, the red talking a mile a minute about getting Dean fitted for a new Hand Maiden outfit.
"Ah, well...you're really good. I probably would have been the next ghost if you hadn't been around." He reached into his coat and pulled out one of the cards he kept in the zippered inside pocket, holding it out to Benny. "We're always looking for good hunters for Hunter Corp."
"See, Heat induced slick, while designed to attract a mate isn't as sweet smelling as Arousal.." He traced the shell of Dean's ear with his tongue, growling lowly. "Nor does it taste as sweet."
Once again he pulled back; stilling himself and watching as Dean and Jimmy moved in tandem, their movements causing Dean's straining erection to brush against his own and pulling a deep groan him. Jimmy's movements became more erratic and Castiel knew it wouldn't be much longer before the other man lost complete control.
Dean finally looked up and Castiel was lost in the twin pool of green; the gold flecks seemingly making his eyes glow in the low light. His throat went dry and he remembered the first time he stared into them, how his mind shut down and he'd walked into an open door.
He wasn't sure how long they stood there wrapped in each other's arms, softly scenting one another. When he finally did pull away his eyes touched on every plane of Dean's face before their gazes caught and held. Slowly his hand rose and he cupped Dean's face, his thumb stroking over Dean's cheek before he leaned in, brushing his lips over Dean's lightly. At first Dean held himself completely still but when Castiel went to pull away Dean's hands fisted in Castiel's shirt and yanked him back, kissing him hard. Caught by surprise Castiel let out a small noise and Dean's tongue slipped inside, stroking against Castiel's teasingly as he pressed up against Castiel.
The air between them grew thick again and their gazes once more caught and held, their eyes searching each others for something that would clue them in on whatever it was between them.
He and Benny sized each other up, their hand shake more a scrabble for dominance with Benny being the larger man and just barely winning out in the show of strength. Dean seemed oblivious to the entire exchange, his brow furrowed as he listened to something on his head set. Rolling his eyes he finally turned his attention back to them.
Castiel felt his stomach flip as he watched Dean laugh, the way he tipped his head back and the way the laughter rolled through his body. Shifting slightly in his chair he picked up one of the tumblers and took a sip, savoring the smooth taste and even smoother warmth as it slid down his throat.
The two Omegas moved towards one another, Dean stopping to nuzzle both Samandriel and Castiel quickly before holding his hand out to Adam. The younger Omega took it, rubbing his wrist against Dean's in a subtle scent mark.
"I hate when you do that." Dean huffed. "But fine, just stay out of my way. I know you have Alpha muscles to match that big brain of yours but you don't know Alistair the way I do. If he attacks, you keep his goons away from me while I deal with him. Capiche?"
Castiel suppressed a grin as he watched them, their heads pressed together and whispers bouncing back and forth between them. He cleared his throat and arched his eyebrow as he looked between them.
He nodded and placed his hand over hers and gave it a small squeeze. "I know. I just wish we had something..anything about what happened, or his whereabouts. We don't even know who would be behind this, and as Sheriff I'm sure he's made plenty of enemies."
Dean was unaware of the wide eyes pointed at him from all sides; his vision was tunneled down the older man who sat indifferently in front of him. He let out a pained hiss as the sharp pain his back grew worse. The soft sounds of footfalls dimly registered with him signaling that both Jack and Emma had been awoken by the commotion in the kitchen.
and the way his whole demeanor changed was immediate, he even called me Sir. Complete with the same downward look you give me when I pull the
"Wild horses couldn't keep me away." Dean licked his lips before biting the lower one. "Besides you promised to either fuck me or eat me. And I want to see which you choose."
"No!" He growled and pulled Dean even closer still. "Michael can't use you as a Vessel if there's an angel already using it. So I ask you Dean, do you trust me Dean?"
Crowley waved his hand, cutting Castiel off before shoving him down the hallway. "Come off it, lets see what Squirrel thinks and then the two of you will be out of my hair."
Her voice caused him to jump and he huffed softly as he turned to face her, an eyebrow raised at the soft look on her face as she watched the three sleep.
Charlie's voice caused the Omega to jump and Castiel felt a bit bad for him, he seemed rather excitable and easily scared at the moment. Andy started to shift from foot to foot, his eyes darting from him to Charlie then back to him. He could practically the apprehension rolling off the Omega at that point.
"You're fine. I am protecting you from imploding. I wanted you to enjoy something that many of your kind get to see in their finite life times."
"We were the other family." Castiel stated, his eyes sliding back over to Jimmy. "Jimmy has two older brothers and they're at least a year older than Raphael."
The two boys looked between each other and Castiel found himself watching them hold an entire conversation without one word being uttered between them. That definitely had to have been picked up from Sam and Dean, those two were pros at that sort of communication and Castiel had to bite back the soft huffed laugh.  After a few moments of silent conversation Samandriel looked over at him.
Panting he felt his eyes slip close and he faintly heard Dean murmuring soft praise against the top of his head. With a soft sounding purr he slumped against his mate, lazily lapping at the open wound he'd made as the fire in his blood receded; leaving only a sated, content Omega behind.
With the class sufficiently distracted he allowed them free reign for the rest of the class and if he busied himself with down loading TikTok and watching every video on the Lawrence Police profile that had Dean in it, well that was no one else’s business but his own.
"No..well he probably is now, but he wasn't then. He's always been a bit sweeter smelling. We thought it was because.."
"Weren't you ever taught it's impolite to stare?" The inquired and Dean could feel his knees buckle at the throaty growl the man had.
"Oh, so you found a female me...great." Dean climbed out of bed, stalking over to the window and wrapping his arms around himself. "You should probably check in with her, wouldn't want her to worry."
The kiss was hard, messy and full of teeth and tongues as they fought for dominance with Castiel barely coming out the victor and even that with the dirty trick of ghosting his fingers over one of Dean's nipples. Panting harshly Castiel drew back and started leaving little kisses and gently there nips along Dean's jaw and down his throat, paying special attention to the scent gland before working his way lower. He kissed his way over Dean's chest, stopping to play with both nipples before he worked lower, following the the soft trail of hair down to Dean's navel.
"Maybe, or maybe he's on a run and the door wasn't all the way closed and the wind blew it open...or maybe he found some wayward orphan in need of help and took them up to Moondoor."
Castiel woke up sweaty and rutting against his bed, his skin feeling two sizes too small as he growled through his release; his teeth tearing into his pillow and sending feather flying everywhere. Panting he allowed himself only a few minutes to enjoy the afterglow before he pulled himself from his bed and padded into the bathroom. Wrinkling his nose at the thick scent of spent Alpha he turned the water on and waited for the temperature to adjust, his eyes straying to his reflection in the mirror. His skin was still flushed, his knot still thick at the base and as pleasurable as his morning release had been he could still feel arousal thrumming through his body.
"Don't worry Blue eyes, I'll get that leverage even if I have to bother your brother until he gives it to me."
Shifting around on his bed he grabbed one of his discarded sketch books and tried to focus on that for a bit, working on a fantasy drawing that he’d been sketching on and off on for a month or so. The base was the figure of a man, or a boy, but from their back sprouted large wings, 6 to be exact, and in varying shades of green and bronze. They were all on the darker side of the spectrum, some looking down right black in the shadows. The face and the overall body however were the problem. Or rather, would be a problem if anyone other than himself ever seen the picture.
"We should, this isn't one of those high school rom-coms the 90's liked and produced like mating bunnies. And this isn't a bet or anything, we're just seeing who he likes better."
Jimmy had seated himself on the sofa as he waited, his eyes roaming over both Castiel and Dean in turn as they situated themselves. They allowed themselves to read over the script for a few moments before Jimmy and Castiel moved themselves into position and started running through the lines. While they worked through them Jimmy would glance out of the corner of his eye at Dean, taking in the rapt way the younger man was watching them.
The older man looked around the room, his eyes narrowing at how close Dean and Cas were standing; their shoulders brushing together as they sipped their coffee.
"C'mon Kestrel, you think denying yourself is going to reverse your fall? That pretending to be virtuous again that you'll be regranted entrance and your wings will be restored?"
With a fond smile he locked the truck and watched as Claire practically skipped over to the gates, her blonde hair shining in the sun. He drew closer to the little booth at the front and stared at the listings, not paying attention to the person behind it until the sound of a clearing throat caught his attention. Looking up he couldn't help but squint as he started at the long haired young man behind the counter. He seemed familiar and it took him a moment to place the face.
The quiet, content atmosphere seemed to be short lived as a knock reverberated through the downstairs and Castiel glanced a look at the clock on the mantel, it wasn't overly late but still later than any of their pack visited, specially on an Omega nest night. A confused frown furrowed Castiel's brow and before he could get up to answer the door Samandriel beat him to it.  At first Castiel could only hear the soft drone of voices but that soon became loud growling and a mixture of protective Alpha and annoyed mixed with scared Omega. Jumping to his feet he hurried to the front door and stopped dead at the sight of Samandriel blocking the door and snarling at a wide eyed Adam.
Sam stayed quiet for a few long moments, his eyes darting around the room wildly; something that Castiel normally only seen in extreme trauma cases and was a sign of all consuming terror. Finally Sam seemed to break, his eyes coloring a deep crimson as he thread his fingers through his hair and pulled. Suddenly concerned for Sam's well-being Castiel began to rise, an offer of help dying on his tongue as Same finally spoke.
"Aye you did. But again I wouldn't expect you to understand since neither of you have any idea of your own heritage. Now since you decided to run away like an adolescent pup throwing a temperfit, you're stuck with me now and there's so much more I need to talk to you about." Rowena hummed softly, watching them for a moment before speaking again. "So I was correct when I said the new magic user would come from this  pack you've put together for yourselves. At first I thought it might be Mary. Your brother's strong studious nature and your lines natural affinity for magic, I thought she was it. Not to mention the wee lass is going to be a strong Alpha one day."
The moment the thought crossed his mind his body seemed to shut down, luckily his coffee cup was empty as it tumbled to the floor. Dean wasn't his Mate, they were friends, well they might have crossed that line the last time he was there, but they were still just friends, not mates. He grimaced again as he rubbed at his chest, a deep ache radiated through him at those words. A knock on his hotel door drew him from his thoughts and on a quiet feet he moved across the room and cracked his door open just a bit; Meg grinning at him from the small opening.
"Apparently my Alpha always wanted you. Didn't matter how or manifestation. It was always you. I wanted to be different, better than the Alpha's here. Gabriel..he would keep me updated on you, on how you took on more and more parental roles for Sam. He neglected to say however that you presented Omega or that...well...what you father did." A growl crept into his voice and forced himself to take a couple of breaths to calm himself. "When I came back for Gabriel and Sam's mating..seeing you standing on the porch scenting my brother so intimately I realized or rather I thought I realized why. And I was so angry, he knew how I felt and yet..." His voice slipped into another growl and his arms tightened around Dean, pulling him closer.
"Go on Clarence, I'm fine besides I have the feeling that things might be better off for me here." Her eyes jumped from his face to Ash's, a grin on her lips.
In fact every time they crossed paths Gabriel found a new facet of Dean's intelligence to be surprised by. Gabriel's favorite kernel of knowledge was that Dean's "GED" was really an honors Diploma that no one even knew he had. And how could they when they moved around so much and Dean never did his homework at home; preferring to do it in school and turn it in then.  So when Gabriel had taken it upon himself to help Sam 'acclimate to life without Dean' he put the older hunter into his own pocket dimension where Dean could indulge his intelligence without hiding it. Once in a while he would drop by and just watch as Dean navigated the dimension; living up to everything he was capable of and living the type of life he deserved. One of his favored memories from that false world was listening to Dean chatter away with friends during his electrical engineering class and about designing an optical implant that could restore lost sight.  It saddened him that he had to pull Dean away at Sam's insistence.
"He's telling the truth. Adam has a different Oma, your Oma just met him."  Castiel kept his scent neutral and his voice calm in order to keep the situation from escalating.
"Well then, since you two are obvious well pleased with the selections I'll finish up with dark and handsome here. He needs a few alternations in the thighs..must be a runner or cyclist with those things."
"But I wouldn't worry, he never touches them more than necessary. Bad for business you know if it got out that he was taking liberties with them. He just likes to ogle them."
Castiel frowned as he closed his book and got up to pace, his hands held behind his back at the wrists.
Words became an afterthought when Dean arched up and tightened around Castiel's shaft, a whine high and loud in his throat. Castiel's thrusts sped up, the force of them bringing Dean's back up from the mattress and punching whines and loud broken moans from him. Castiel drug his teeth over the bolt of Dean's jaw, shuddering as Dean nipped and suckled at his mating mark. He bared his throat to his mate, panting and growling as he gripped Dean's thighs tighter and pulled him back harsher into his thrusts, the sound of their skin slapping together loud in the room even over their own pleasured noises.
Adam cried harder and Castiel blinked before looking over at Clair again, a stern expression on his face.
The pace from there turned fast, Dean driving himself down harder and faster, his thighs gripping Castiel's hips as he rocked and ground down on him. Sweat crawled down Dean's throat and chest and when Castiel tried to lean up to lick it away Dean slammed him back against the bed, growling at him as he held him down. Panting along with Dean, Castiel dug his feet into the mattress, thrusting up into Dean's warmth as hard as he could. He felt Dean's rhythm falter and he grinned wolfishly as he continued to thrust harder upwards.
There was a grin playing on Dean's lips and Castiel felt his lips twitch in response their gazes locking for a few long moments. Clearing his throat he looked away, raking his hand through his hair.
"Who the hell are you?" Lucifer demanded as he stood, coming in a few inches taller than Dean and trying to use it to his advantage.
The entire day felt like it passed too quickly and before he knew it they were seated at a table in the back of the restaurant; the twins looking resplendent in their suits and Dean felt himself puff up in pride at landing two of the hottest men in the world. He watched them chatting back and forth, a smile on his lips as they teased one another playfully. As he looked on he realized that there was no other place he wanted to be for the rest of his life. When they drew him into the conversation he shelved the thought but he was already planning their next birthday and a smile played over his lips as he imagined their surprise.
With the light of a dying star the older Angel imploded; his wings charred into the floor where he fell. Later he'd pick apart how Dean had been able to watch him die without his eyes burning out like any other humans eyes would have. Groaning he gripped onto the large table next to him as he tried to find his voice.
Later that night when Castiel crawled into bed he grit his teeth to find that a rather large blanket had joined the barrier that kept his mates skin from his hands. Huffing he wrapped himself in his own blankets and turned his back to Dean, ignoring the plaintive keening of his Alpha for his mate. He never did find out what Dean and Michael had planned for the next weekend, but his mind was all too happy to supply him with images and suggestions.
"I guess some of them found each other, you know those DNA testing kits, they help tie up a lot of loose ends and what not."
The standoff continued and even though Castiel wanted to move he couldn't. All he could do was stand and watch as Dean, as his mate begged for death. His paralysis was shorted lived however as Sam shoved him forward and then he couldn't stop moving; his arms and wings wrapping around Dean and holding him tightly even as he sent a blast of grace at Gabriel to send the other Archangel backwards.
Dean snorted as he looked over at him. "Samuel was Mom's dad. Henry was Dad's. He was..he was Dad's Omega father. He and my Grandma Millie--who was an Alpha--owned all of this at one time. At least that's what his journal said. According to a couple entries they had a few problems with some of the locals, people against them because they felt that their roles were perverted since Henry was the Omega."  Dean's lips twisted into a snarl even as he continued. "Winchester's apparently had a long line of male Omega's going back as far as Henry could trace the lineage. Grandma Millie did all she could to protect Henry but things kept happening. and then Henry just disappeared. Well that's what the news clipping that was tucked inside Henry's journal said."
"Aww, Cassie has a crush. Is that why you've been wearing low grade blockers in order to keep the brunt of your scent under wraps so he doesn't figure you out?" As the flush deepened on Castiel's face Gabriel crowed triumphantly. "It is, isn't it?! Aww Cassie, that's so cute."
The words brought a scowled twist to Dean's lip and he turned away, leaving Castiel to frown at his back. He went to reach out but drew his hand back at the slowly rising scent of anger started to swell between them.
There was a flurry of movement and it was only by sheer luck that Castiel managed to get a good hold on Dean as he launched himself at the other Alpha.
"We could both go after him, let him decide who he likes better." Castiel offered with a shrug that he tried to make look careless as if he didn't care about the outcome.
"Jeeze Cassie, you have a type don't you? So how did my stick in the mud little brother manage to 10 like her."
"We're going to do this now huh?" He sounded resigned as he looked at him, his green eyes narrowed slightly.
"Yes it is. My Alpha and my Alpha cum." He snarled as he bit down on one of Dean's hips, making the Alpha jerk wildly underneath him.
"We ask him to run lines with us. The scene we're running after lunch calls for a third person in the shot. We can always say we need him to just stand in as the third person. You know he loves to help out, plus Benny will be busy serving the lunch rush so we'll be free of him for a bit."
Castiel felt his lips thin, he hated the fact that Dean always excluded himself when he talked about intelligence. He knew his mate was extremely intelligent but Dean always waved off any sort of compliment and would point out something that Sam had done or was currently doing.
Just like old times he leaned up against the wall and looked out over the landscape; though it was dark and he could just dimly hear the strains of music from the gym and the babble of voices. Humming to himself he let his mind wander, his eyes staring off into the darkness.
"And you're not taking Jack away? And he has the right to turn down the..position if he wants with no repercussions?"
The sound of a knock on his office door brought Castiel out of his thoughts and his face burned red as the scent of Alpha arousal burned through the air. Grabbing the aerosol can of neutralizer from his bottom desk drawer he gave a few sprays and cracked the window in his office before calling out.
Castiel's forehead furrowed as he listened to Ash talk. Dean was mated before? He didn't recall seeing a bite, though he supposed it could have been somewhere unconventional.  What Ash was talking about sounded an awful lot like the illegal trade of Omegas, and he had heard that there were some Alpha rings as well but they were very few and kept well hidden.
The sound of the young man's voice rasped over them and Jimmy and Castiel could only nod, their eyes now flicking between each other and the green eyed young man. Though they never spoke about it both of them enjoyed the young, firm form of a twinkish body and this new P.A. fit that bill. As if their gazes were a physical touch the young man looked up and their gazes locked. Time seemingly vanished as they stared, and there was no way to tell if it were only a few moments or maybe hours as they all stared at one another. It came to an end when Bobby dismissed them all sending everyone back to their tasks and leading the young man away.
He tilted his head as he watched Dean's shoulder's tighten up. He went to reach out a again, this time his fingers skimming over Dean's back. He let out a soft whine when Dean shifted away, his Alpha not knowing why his Omega was mad at him but wanting to make it right.
Meg turned on her heel and flounced out of the room, leaving Castiel staring around his room just sort of wondering what to do at that point. After a few moments he managed to pull an outfit out of his suitcase and get into the shower, his washing perfunctory and only moments later he was standing in his room allowing himself to drip dry as he made himself another cup of coffee.
Descriptions of child abuse. If that bothers you you can skip past the part. It' starts where Henry is talking to Cas while Sam and Dean fight.
Castiel's forehead furrowed as he tried to think of all the places he and Dean had visited when they were younger. There were so many places that he wasn't even sure where to begin. He frowned as he gently shoved Dean's shoulder.
“Ah, simpler times. Now it’s all done via computer and I don’t get to travel as much. Not that there are many Pure Lines to keep record of. This pack and one back in England are the only 'large' packs left. Sure there are some smaller factions here and there but they don't seem to be procreating as much as this pack is.”
"You've been pulling away! Spending all your time in your office." A wet sniffle turned into a snarl as Dean wiped harshly at his eyes. "And now I'm a whiny, pregnant Omega stereotype. No wonder you're spending all your time away from me."
Dean vacated Castiel's lap and started pacing, his worried pregnant scent starting to fill the air around them.
They nodded and placed a marker on their counter before moving on to the next. Dean looked at Adam and high-fived the younger boy after they looked around and seen only one other marker put down.
"Good. Part of the negotiation is a safe word, and that's a word or movement if you're not able to speak that means everything stops. That word is to be obeyed at all times and that is something that not to be taken advantage of. Both you and your partner should have one and it needs to be something that one wouldn't normally call out in the throes of passion."
"Maybe not, but sitting here stinking up the entire floor with your worried Alpha scent isn't helping anything either. Plus doesn't Charlie work there? Maybe she'll have some new information."
"We'll see, although if your brother gets them first we're doomed. He'll use it forever against us." Dean lamented with a faux frown.
The sound of the gun going off startled him, but not as much as the pain that ripped through his chest as he was blown backwards. His head struck the ground and his vision swam before he blacked out, only vaguely aware of an argument going on around him.
Around him conversations flowed and he shook his head to try and clear it all. It was all too much like high school itself and he excused himself, heading down the familiar faded tiled halls with no real destination in mind. He was honestly surprised at how much was exactly the same; the halls smelling of the thick wax used to shine them, the underlying smell of the metal lockers and the lingering scent of whatever had been served that day at lunch.
"Henry..." The name tickled a memory in the back of his mind and he scowled as he tried to recall what it was.
"C'mon now Dean, you know he's better off without you...just like your Daddy was. I mean it took him two years the first time to find you, and even then it wasn't him that found you, one of my guys just happened to be lax and that redheaded Alpha bitch seen you. Speaking of her, I'm sure she's glad to be rid of you too. I mean you only took up her time and the resources of the clinic. Now she's free to look after much more worthy clients."
He let go of his brothers shirt and stumbled backwards, his eyes wide. He always knew that his father didn't approve of the "alternative lifestyle". Especially after Gabriel had brought home not only a young man but young woman as well and introduced them respectfully as his boyfriend and girlfriend. The argument that Christmas had been legendary and Castiel was surprised the fallout hadn't made it's way into the gossip column of the local paper. All the pain, all the anger, and all the depression he'd gone through when Dean just stopped talking to him and seemed to disappear rose up and threatened to choke him.
"Well it wasn't me." Michael stated with a huff, his eyes awash in undisguised desire. "My tastes in Omega's run much more..masculine."
A hand reached from the light and gripped his shoulder, a sudden flash of pain ripping through him as a scream was torn from his abused throat. As suddenly as it happened the light faded and when he blinked he found himself in a wood box. Panic clawed at his and without a second thought he became to dig his way through the loosely packed earth.  The first caress of fresh air on his face left him with his eyes closed and his face tipped up towards the sun. Another breeze blew past and he swore he could hear whispers.
After that Castiel self appointed himself to the couch as penance, his Alpha’s tale tucked between his legs at hurting his mate and pups. In apology he took Samandriel and Lucas out separately for some one on one time. Samandriel, after some Alpha posturing forgave him as they went to go pull some new parts from the salvage yard for the old junker that Dean was helping the boy rebuild. Lucas on the other hand was still reserved around him, his head bowed and his voice quiet.  Castiel knew it would take time for the young boy to trust him again and it made his heart constrict knowing he’d made his pup afraid of him.
The man speaking was short in stature with brown hair and eyes to match and an amused expression on his face. Despite his size Dean could tell that the man could do serious damage if he wanted. He was dressed in Bakers Whites from head to toe which calmed Dean's nerves somewhat.
Taking a deep breath he nodded and headed back out to the rental, slipping behind the wheel and practically speeding away from his brother's shop. Though he didn't really need the directions, he had the maps app on his phone giving him the play by play, the directions as background noise to take his mind off of the dark thoughts swirling in his mind.
"Go ahead and try." Dean replied with a snort before he leaned over to growl into Lucifer's ear. "I'm the Sheriff here."
With a snort he slipped his shirt off, ignoring Gabriel's wolf-whistles and slipped into the bakery shirt, smoothing it down and then turning to face Gabriel again. The shorter man gave him a critical once over before nodding and motioning for Dean to follow him and as they made their way to front of the shop Dean wondered if maybe he could suggest other things to help the shop; like maybe an open mic night for local bands and artists. Anything but beat poetry.
"No, this isn't because of that..not completely anyway I don't think. My father showed up yesterday and I sent Dean home. I didn't want him to have to deal with my father and his ideals for longer than necessary."
"Guess we can rule him out of our possible loose lips." Charlie muttered as she typed out something on her computer.
"Of course puppy. After all, I haven't held this position for so long for no reason." Silence hung in the air for a moment before she clapped her hands together. "Now that that's out of the way. Has anyone talked to Adam?"
"As you can see even in his advanced age he's in good condition, strong, still a warrior. Their line has been traced as far back as the Revolution, holding high ranking spots and undercover positions. This line is also known for their brains, they can puzzle through anything, find any pattern and figure out the best way to go about things in a matter of minutes." Alastair reached over and tipped the man's head up but his chin, the smile on his face turning into a smirk as he motioned to the audience. "I'd like you all to take a good look at Henry Winchester. One of the two last remaining Winchester Omegas."
The smile that Chief aimed at him made a warmth bloom in Dean's chest and he felt his face heat more.
"Both of those sound like good ideas, so why don't we go inside and make them a reality?" Castiel purred, his slight accent thickening. "Unless this isn't what you had in mind Dean."
“Never could get anything by you Cher.” Benny’s words were chuckled, the sound low and dark. “Things are going bad at Lee’s. I’m looking for a way out, hell Ash is looking too.”
Hey hey Readers, we're almost to the end. I'm happy you're all enjoying this. One of you asked about a story explaining the last chapter and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to tell that story. So perhaps once this is over and my other two WIPs are done I might delve into that story, and the story with Benny and Hunter Corp Dean. That one has been picking at my brain too. Anyway, just wanted to drop in and say I appreciate you all <3
Benny for all intents and purposes was the poster boy for what an Alpha should be. Strong and wide of chest, a warm, full scent with an underlying thread of steel. He should have been a cover model for those romance novels Castiel seen dotting stores. The mans warm brown hair held hints of grey in it and his eyes were a clear pale blue. Any one would be lucky to count him among their suitors.
The sound of the door opening shook him out of his thoughts and he smiled as Castiel walked through the door; his trenchcoat billowing out behind him as he moved. After a quick kiss they were out; he had booked them a tour of a local Apiary and watching Castiel take in all the information with eager eyes and asking all sorts of questions made Dean's chest glow happily. They ate a light lunch at the little cafe on the property, tasting the local honeys and buying a few to take home. They spend another hour at the Apiary before returning home where Jimmy met them at the door.
A hush went out over the assembled crowd and Castiel felt his heart stop in his chest before it started racing, his muscles coiling tightly beneath his skin. He started to stand but a strong hand on his shoulder shoved him back down and he looked up to see Charlie shaking her head at him.
Castiel looked over then when Sam remained quiet. The taller man looked to be weighing his words carefully before speaking. Though honestly whatever the other man had to say couldn't be as shocking as what Castiel had heard so far. Both their eyes were drawn back to the battle as another cry rang out, this time from Gabriel as Dean managed to open his own wound on the other Angel.
"I said now Sam." Dean's voice was firm and in any other setting it would have sent a pleasant shiver down Gabriel's spine, but right then he was more focused on keeping his throat intact.
"Listen Garth I don't care...you get that paperwork on my desk...yes the desk in the office...my office Garth..no..Garth..." With an annoyed huff Dean snapped his phone shut and slipped into his pocket, turning when Crowley cleared his throat.
Gabriel shook his head before sighing again. "I didn't say anything because I never figured that any of us would ever meet." Gabriel cast a sardonic grin Jimmy's way. "Guess I was wrong." He frowned; crossing his arms again. "For the record I still don't like this plan."
The sentence was supposed to have come out even and teasing, but the little hitches in between words turned Castiel's expression into one of pure hunger. He leaned in and nipped at Dean's throat, teasing the racing pulse there before purring darkly.
Lucifer's words barely left his lips before Dean had the larger man pinned to the floor. Having seen his mate take larger Alpha's down before, Castiel stood aside and watched in amusement as his brother trashed and cursed underneath Dean's weight.
He waved his hand at Dean. “Go on Dean, don’t let me keep you.” He cut his eyes to Benny, his voice cool. “Pleasure to meet you.”
His life changed that day for the better, no more late night parties, no one night stands, and no heinous travel schedule for filming. Everything from that day was about giving Emma the best life he could. Part of that however did not include taking up roles in campy Vampire movies that she could gloat about her Dad being in while at school. All in all he couldn't picture his life with out her.
"Well I supposed he wouldn't since he didn't know I was coming." There was a playful quirk to her lips but it looked like it would have been more at home on a shark or some other predator than on the small woman before him.
Gabriel snarled but sat down, eyes burning as he stared at the man on his right. Taking a breath Castiel patted the man's leg.
Castiel pulled in a long slow breath, his eyes closing as he fought down the flare of anger that suddenly burst low in his stomach.
The file had said that only tomb in the mausoleum had been tampered with, the lid pried off and the contents disturbed. The report stated that nothing had been removed that they could see but Dean had the feeling that it might have been something small and now suddenly the milk run looked it might be something more involved. Huffing a sigh he stepped towards the vandalized tomb only to be thrown back against the cold stone wall. Groaning he arched up only to begin to flail as something closed around his throat. Sputtering he began to flail even more wildly in a bid to get free even though he knew that it was futile.
"Rejection Sickness. Though by all accounts he should be much worst off since Rejection Sickness is more serious than Forrest Sickness. But since this is Dean we're talking about and he's..."
He didn't trust the man as far as he could throw him but the man had somehow proven his loyalty, such  as it was, to Dean. Neither Dean or Crowley ever went into detail about what happened, but Dean vouched for the British man so in support he promised not to maim the other man on sight unless provoked.
"Not in public." Jimmy asked as he glared at the door. "But we'll hide the body if you let us break Benny's kneecaps first."
"Meg..." Charlie started, a soft warning in her tone that any other time Castiel would have paid more attention to.
He nodded, conceding the point that his face was probably already plastered up on the wall along side  Charlie, Benny, Gadreel, and anyone else that worked at Moondoor. Still they needed a way in, and a way to see and hear what was being said and if they couldn't do it themselves then they needed someone they could trust. As he started pacing again he cycled through all his contacts; weighing the pro's and con's of them both before an idea struck. A smile eased over his face as he bounced lightly on the balls of his feet.
Dean snorted and finished off his coffee. "So why the reason for security? Other than the 'medicinal' goods y'all have?"
"Listen here Douchebag, you're not welcome here. You've been told before and this is the only warning I'm going to give you. Now you can walk out of here on your own and never come back. Or I can escort you out and leave you in the back alley to fend for yourself." He smirked as he twisted his hands, tightening the fabric against the man's throat. "So Arthur old bean, what'll be?"
Dean's lower lip was caught between his teeth tightly as he looked down, his hands nervously playing with the hem of his shirt.
Samandriel's scent mellowed slightly and Castiel snuck a glance over at the young man, watching as his fingers twisted in the hem of his shirt.
"Simmer down. I won't harm my grandchildren. I do want to meet them at some point however. You owe me that much."
A few more minutes that felt like hours passed and Dean felt as if he was at his wits end; he was close to ripping his own hair out just for something to do. A quick glance over at Jack showed that the young boy was watching some show about dragon flies and whenever they would show the prismatic colors of the insects wings a small smile would quirk his lips. A thought tugged at Dean's subconscious and he frowned as he tried to pin it down, his eyes narrowed as he stared off into space.
Castiel felt rather than heard Jimmy join him and was in the process of turning to face him when he heard an indrawn breath. The transfixed, glazed look on his brother's face sent a bolt of alarm through Castiel until he noticed the identical look on the face of the blonde Omega.  He arched his eyebrow at Ash before shaking his head slowly and turning away from Jimmy.
