Castiel was spared the pleasure of replying when he found himself coughing again, the burn in his throat impossible to ignore once more.
my sister and her boyfriend came over for dinner tonight, it was nice + i got my first batch of easter chocolate which is always good d,xjfgm
Dean determinedly took another bite of his fried rice, chewing slowly. By the time he swallowed, Charlie looked as though she was seriously considering homicide.
It had been Dean’s idea, of course, that they should watch the sunrise while sitting on the beach at least
. (Her follow up move of reassuring him that surely it would happen soon enough had just led to him rubbing his temples as he explained that they were coming up on a
danger, Dean didn’t have high hopes for getting out of his restraints. He’d been fiddling with the knots while still feigning sleep, and they hadn’t budged an inch. As a last-ditch effort, he funnelled what little magic he had into loosening them, and tried not to visibly relax when they moved with the extra coercion.
So rather than grabbing a drink before heading to join Cas, as he’d initially been planning, he found himself heading straight towards them.
god ive been thinking abt marvel so much these past couple of days bc of people talking abt the loki show (still not watching it any time soon unless actual genderfluid rep happens in which case I will ignore my responsibilities in order to watch it while sobbing bc genderfluid rep!!! but I haven't avoided people talking abt it and I compulsively unspoiler things in discord and seeing people talk abt it with 0 context is funny) bUT the funniest thing is my love of loki got me back into marvel vibes again then I've spent the past 2-3 days reading clint/coulson fics from like, 2011-2012 when everyone thought loki was bad still bc my mum started rewatching agents of shield and I re-remembered my love of phil coulson so that's an interesting vibe. i kinda wanna look properly for like, endgame era fics centred on them bc I think that would be interesting given a lot of clint's storyline in those movies centred around his shoehorned in family (like no shade to laura barton but all the shade to the writers/directors for being like 'ah what to do we haven't really utilised this char in a good way outside of the thing abt being controlled by loki,,,,,, lets give him a family that's literally never been alluded to before that works!!') hOWEVER I'm also very attached to the 2012 era 'everyone lives in the tower together and is happy <3' vibes and those don't tend to exist as much in endgame era fics since obvs we know that's not what happens in canon. except for in field trip fics because tropes galore in those.
So I’m writing and posting this from my phone and I’m tired from socialising and travel,,,,, sorry for the terrible writing/formatting that has probably resulted from that
wasn’t helping Dean’s blushing situation, and he seemed to be debating something internally for a moment.
also i only vaguely have a handle on how to write sam which is why this is only the third drabble outta 43 that he's been in (and that's if u include the one where most of his lines were pilfered from canon)
Way back in jan when I wrote deans bday drabble I was like ‘oh if I’m still into spn enough come September I’ll just give cas My birthday for a bday drabble’ and we’ll we all know how that’s gone FJSJSKKSSL
so some dramas been going down in my extended friend group— we were in the midst of trying to organise another trip for next year, like the one that happened this year that I talked abt in my ans when i was on it, with it being organised so early bc this time there was potentially gonna be 15 of us
my muse has been more focused on bnha as of late (rip) which is good for the bnha fics I wanna write but Not so good for this fic xldjfzsd
I accidentally burnt my hand but it doesn't hurt and I got apple sauce out of it soooo my misadventures in cooking will live to see another day
“We didn’t have to go out for food, angel! You should’ve told me you weren’t feeling up to it, I would’ve cooked or ordered something in instead.”
It was way more confusing than it really should be, in all honesty. But hopefully he’d have many more years down on earth trying to puzzle it all out.
this is. uh. the closest i've gotten to forgetting to write lmao. i almost had a heart attack when i realised lol, my brains been all over the place today (it's just past 10pm rn, and all i wanna do rn is sleep. but can't fuck up when I've done so well for the past 74 days)
Cas cringed, looking down at the arm in question. He was fairly sure the cut had missed his soulmark, the familiarity he had with its positioning acting as a reassurance rather than a reminder of what he couldn’t have for once, but he knew that it was close enough that there was no way to treat the wound without the mark being visible.
in good vibes I got my suit for my hs valedictory ceremony today! which is extra good because the ceremony is tomorrow lol
. But Cas wants him to do this, and he doesn’t want to be faced with Cas’ disappointed and pleading stare any more than he has been already. So after one last, lingering kiss for luck, he allows Cas to step back and turn around to call his broom to his side before swinging a leg over the handle and mounting it.
me and a few friends are going away for five days (i live in aus so covid's not an issue here rn (in my state at least) dw) and although I'm planning on keeping up with writing each day, I'm not sure if I'll have the time to update this each day (although I will try)
the chance for anything more than the friendship that would form through the necessity that being bound for life would create, but something within him held hope that their future together was bright.
A few noises came from the baby monitor he and Cas kept near their bed, and he suppressed a grin when Cas almost immediately stirred.
but no seriously how is it 200 days into this goddamn year already and also how have i managed to keep this up so long. holy shit.
“Let’s just say I have inexplicable reasons for a lot of what I do. Do you need a hand grabbing his body out?”
“Well, even if it was, it shows that the coffee machine is liable to randomly deciding to work again, and waiting has a non-zero chance of effectively getting me caffeinated.”
they must’ve shaken hands at some point when they first met, but Dean is fairly certain this is the first physical contact he’s ever had with the other prince.
“It just... feels like a disservice to Jess, in some ways. I know I’ve had relationships since her death, but none of them were ever going to be ‘the one’, as
this was just going to be me projecting the fact that despite me having like 0 cooking practice, my mum getting a job at a grocery store has thrown me in the deep end on prepping dinners for myself, and this week especially I've been cooking Actual Things. And it takes so fucking long bc I'm so not practiced but i have 0 time management skills (aka I've been having Late Dinners). however i did not get that far as cas and dean got distracted.
“I’m sure,” Cas said, smiling at him indulgently, and Dean was knocked breathless for a second as a wave of affection flooded him.
any physical changes, not like he would expect in the wake of a spell landing, but with the adrenaline from the fight he hadn’t really thought of it beyond an instant ‘Oh cool, I’m not dead, now let's gank this bitch.’.
For all he’d tried to deny it to Sam, Dean knew exactly how he felt for Cas. He had liked the guy as more than a friend for
“It’s been a little odd at times,” he admitted. “But not in a bad way. Just… seeing how much more casual everyone is when it’s not a formal event. Things aren’t all formal back home, of course, but outside of talking to my siblings it’s expected I’ll conduct myself like the prince I am.”
“No, no, it’s fine, I just— thought I left my recipe book on the counter earlier, but I can’t see it anymore. I’m sure it’ll turn up, but I was planning on baking this afternoon.”
“I don’t feel like I’m giving you a great example of being ‘good with words’, here, but I’ll thank you for your glowing review.”
Because he is damn lucky. He’s fucked up so many times since Cas first pulled him out of Hell, and he knows he’ll fuck up again. Overcoming the kind of things he was taught growing up isn’t something that happens overnight.
chaps 110, 115, 116, 135, 147, 148, 158, 180— some practicalities bc things still aint gonna be simple even with the beginnings of a plan
Because friggin’ hell, he’d worked way too damn hard to get where he is right now to throw it away by cheating to pass a douchebag professors class, and the idea of an inquiry finding him guilty of the act is terrifying.
I'm not like, perfectly happy with this, especially since its so short? but I'm also not having the greatest evening, so it can be hard for me to judge my writing objectively.
in case it wasn't clear by the concept being a recurring theme across these drabbles, even if just by mention, i fuck with the idea of soft mornings spent w a loved one so hard.
(It was only Dean’s self-preservation instinct that stopped him from leaning in and stealing a kiss right at that moment. If he stole a kiss now, they wouldn’t stop until they were both breathless and the sun was risen, and Dean
This shouldn’t be a surprise, given his Words, but it kind of is. His time in the Pit was still fresh in his mind, after all, and while he knew that prior to landing down there he’d felt very confident that he’d be rescued, that kind of hope was hard to hold onto in Hell.
Dean grinned as Cas very obviously took part in suggested activity number one before returning his attention to watching the water.
anyway this is the start of a hanahaki disease au. i don't read these that often as angst without a happy ending is both very common in the trope and not a genre of fic i gravitate towards generally. as for in this au,,,,, i guess we shall see 👀👀
It starts like this: one day, an individual will start dreaming of someone they’ve never met as they drift off to sleep. The visions start off simple— an aspect of their soulmates physical appearance that is distinct, defining, instantly recognisable. Their nose. Their smile. Their (stunning and oh-so-blue) eyes.
time to prepare themselves— even without the time spent on various waitlists within the adoption process, they’d spent the months since the confirmation call frantically reading as many parenting books and attending as many parenting classes as they could.
Dean sighed before sitting up slowly, giving Cas plenty of time to shift out of the way so they wouldn’t knock heads (which he did, but only
he had no reason to be feeling this way, but he entered his morning routine with a dark cloud hanging over him that he couldn’t seem to shake. He couldn’t even sit out in the garden with his bees for half an hour like he usually did when he felt this way, as it was pouring outside and they’d all be safely away in their nests for the day.
this idea came to my brain today and seemed amusing in that slightly-crackish fluff way so I decided to start it. i may at some point go back and like, fix the start of this so the dialogue starts off more canon-ey but I couldn't be fucked today lol. this isn't the section I really wanted to write but setups important or some shit idk
Some part of Dean felt like he should probably drop Cas’ hand so that they could make very obvious gestures of surrender, hopefully calming down the scary strangers threatening them both.
He’d seen what losing Mary had done to John, watched as half of the pen markings that had been adorning his skin faded with her death. He knew soulmates were usually seen as a positive, happy thing, a connection to be celebrated, but the idea that that connection could be severed in an instant was enough to turn him off the idea.
“I’ll have you know that despite how it might appear, my phone is set to ‘do not disturb’ whenever I’m teaching a class.”
Cas was still mostly confused by it all, not really understanding how other people could miss what was so plainly obvious to him, and although he wasn’t annoyed at Dean over any of it, Dean couldn’t help but feel guilty anyway.
“Oh, just general information about your universe. Major events, a general idea of how the power and magic structure’s function, that sort of thing. Things that I can try to pick up on when I’m feeling out potential universes.”
to know. He trusted Sam knew what he was doing, could feel his growing confidence every time their eyes met, and it wasn’t like Dean would be performing the spell anyway. That was Sam’ job.
“Good. Castiel is a perfectly fine name, don’t get me wrong, but it’s a little long and…” Here Dean trailed off, not wanting to offend Cas this early into their acquaintanceship, but Cas just huffed out a quiet laugh.
“That smells good,” Cas said sleepily, shuffling into the kitchen and beelining for the coffee machine.
the vibes were already weird in some ways (certain qs were being asked in forms that seemed a lil private/not things we'd wanna tell all the organisers, they were being rly closed off abt letting anyone else be an organiser) and unbeknownst to me apparently that portion of the group have barely been around the group discord server. I've also been barely around it because the group involves my ex best friend and i didn't know how to handle stuff.
all I know is wake up, eat hot cross bun, write another hundred words of soulmate au, and sleep (Chaps 20, 62, 64, 67, 72, 79, 102, 118, 136, 159)— some expository dialogue
At Sam’s question, Castiel recalled Dean asking the exact same thing, back when they had only met a handful of times. Funny how the brothers could mirror each other so well even unintentionally, although Sam’s question seemed less out of the blue than Dean’s had been.
He didn’t have to glance at Cas to know he was probably cocking his head at the reference, but he did so anyway.
deprived you Shadowhunters are. Although Izzy and Jace never seem to have as many issues on that front as you do.”
Cas nodded, sitting up slightly and holding his hands out eagerly for the mug of tea, and Dean raised an eyebrow while handing it across.
not me writing this early in order to get it out while it’s still sky’s bday in his timezone even if idk when he reads these. full work linked as usual.
He directed the question to the blonde, who had seemingly staved off any disappointment she felt at Dean
After about two weeks of searching, in which they’d seemingly made as little progress as people who’d spent two weeks straight looking through books for a ritual that quite possibly didn’t exist could, Sam sat across from Dean and asked if he’d maybe consider taking a break.
There was nothing particularly significant to it, but that was part of what made it so wonderous. He was in the kitchen with Cas, both of them working simultaneously to keep each other on track while also getting distracted by the simple joy that uninterrupted time together always brought. It was Cas’ turn to be focused, with him concentrating fiercely on the vegetables he was chopping, and Dean was staring contentedly at the angel’s profile when he was hit with a sudden wave of emotion.
you might come to that conclusion, I think you are severely underestimating the hatred I felt for my father prior to his death.”
romantic, to be fair, but they’re also not being overly platonic. Their hands aren’t linked on the table, but their feet are knocking underneath it, and they’re holding some serious eye contact as they talk. As she brings them their dessert, she makes another comment (‘I hope my son is as openly affectionate as you guys are when he gets older’), and it throws Cas as much as it throws him, but they shrug it off.
the weirdest thing abt falling back into yuri on ice is that it simultaneously feels like forever ago and just a year or so ago since I first got into it. like, it came out in 2016. i was 14. now I'm less than a month off being 19. time is illegal now it passes too quickly and it's weird as fuck
His brother had been determined to pull him and Cas apart for ‘one last hurrah’ when they organised these, spewing off some bullshit about tradition and superstition and other general nonsense which Dean was still pretty sure had been code for ‘I just don’t wanna have to watch you two eye-fucking for
The first thing Dean does, when he and Sammy finally get back to the bunker after assuring themselves that Jack had successfully restored everyone that Chuck had vanished, is get blindingly drunk.
Dean tensed slightly as he felt arms wrap around his waist, before relaxing back into the familiar embrace. He’d snuck out of the bar for this, somewhat shocked that their friends had even run the
I added this warning to the summary of the last chap, but not until after I'd already posted it, so some of y'all might've missed it: this au contains themes of a person in a position of power attempting to use that power to coerce sexual favours from uninterested parties. this is not an overly angsty au, the chars don’t give in to said coercion at any point (although they may consider it at times), but if you have issues around that sort of thing then I’d rec sitting this 'verse out 💜
EDIT: realised I should add a general cw/tw for this au— contains themes of a person in a position of power attempting to use that power to coerce sex. this is
“The theory and groundwork for it is all relatively simple for me,” Magnus explained. “Or as simple as dimensional magic
this comes like, right at the end of the story it's a part of, after a bunch of other shenanigans, so don't be confused lmaooo it's not a direct continuation. i reread through the messages from when i first came up with this idea and this part stuck out the most in my brain. once again this is not based on any actual spn lore abt angelic possession and the like. this comes from my brain and is based on random ideas i had abt how i personally would've handled everything if i had control over the spn lore, purely because i think it could b funny.
Dean froze for a moment, a wave of repulsion washing through him as he fully considered the implications of both his and Cas’ words, before making a conscious effort to shake it off as he reached to take the pan off the heat.
i went to another melbourne aces meetup today!!! it was pog and cool and we played boardgames which is always iconic. i also bought myself some pronoun badges, but they were $$$ bc they were good quality enamel ones, so I didn't get he/him ones as I use them the least lol. I'm excited to use them at uni 😄
“Right,” Magnus interrupted with a clap of his hands. “How are we going to get you two back where you belong?”
form of showdown with him, but I figured that once we got back home we’d still have some battles to fight. Are you saying…”
“Well, I had an enjoyable time reading my book. I don’t see why we should have to swim for it to qualify.”
even if Dean didn’t really know what to do (so he was used to bro hugs that lasted long enough for a few quick slaps on the back or impulsive ‘thank god you’re not dead’ embraces, sue him), but he didn’t really see how this would help him break down his internal boundaries.
havent dug into this au in a while lol but something a friend said reminded me of it and i had such a big plan for where it was gonna go!!!
watched some of the olympics today, australia did pretty well in the swimming (and of course there was the relay womens team that fucking thrashed everyone else and beat the world record that I think aus/they'd (its hard to know if it was Them or just the previous aussie womens team of which one member was also a part of) set in the past skhfd)
Sam sighed, shutting the book he’d been looking through. Dean felt slightly guilty, as he hadn’t been much good for research today, but the hyperfocused determination he’d been living with for weeks had given way to a sort of anxious tension ever since Sam had mentioned the portal.
also i talked to the girl i made friends w at that uni meet up I've talked abt a few times!! i was too nervous to reach out to her because i know i can be a bit overwhelming when i talk abt fandoms I'm in etc and in that state I'm not always the best at reading social cues so i was afraid she wasn't actually vibing w the convo and i'd just missed that fact, but apparently she didn't mind me rambling about supernatural for like 2 hours so that's good :)
This first one is likely a fuckin m e s s as I'm. v tired right now. I was in a voice call with international friends for a While and although I love them it was fairly draining, so I wrote this with brain fog well and truly settling over my mind dslfkjscead
true love’s kiss looked like had served as an effective way to both get Sam to shut up and spend an enjoyable and uninterrupted few minutes with his favourite angel.
look are we shocked that wedding shenanigans are starting to happen. i may not use twitter that much but i sure as fuck have fandom friends that do.
He received a classroom full of affirmative motions and noises, only a quatre of which he actually believed, before slipping out into the hallway and pulling his phone to his ear. It took only a couple of rings for Cas to pick up, and Dean didn’t even wait for Cas’ customary greeting before speaking.
on top of my headache I kept reading sick fics today and melbournes given up the ghost of (our basically non-existant) summer in favour of coldness™ again. so its no wonder that this is what I wrote lmaoo
Cas shook his head, even as his arms instinctively tightened to pull Dean closer once more, and he stopped just shy of their lips brushing.
, given 90% of the kisses he experienced came from random hookups who didn’t give a shit (and the occasional demon they were making stupid deals within the course of averting the apocalypse for the 400
A part of Dean wonders how their parents decided on this part of things. They’re both males, after all, and their respective kingdoms are similarly sized. Perhaps it was due to their respective places within their families?
When Dean looked like he was going to continue arguing the point about football, Cas sighed again before playing dirty and pulling the other boy in for a thorough kiss. When he eventually pulled away, Dean looked sufficiently dazed, so Cas straightened out the front of his robe while continuing to talk.
about him that was impossible to ignore, even if the glitter probably helped — but he didn’t have to. The look in Alec’s eyes was familiar enough to him for the man to be instantly recognisable as Alec’s husband.
I don't think I've explicitly mentioned b4, but feel free to comment with like. Ideas or suggestions or w/e, whether its 'u haven't written for this au in a while and i wanna see more' or 'i think u should write a drabble around this trope' etc. i can't guarantee I'll do it, as i gotta have Some idea of what to i want to do beyond the prompt, but it'd be good to have something to fall back on in the evenings where I'm brain fogged lol
with Cas. So about a month and a half into Them, he found himself sitting across from the angel for a talk.
It’s no coincidence that his Words were one of the first things they stripped from him down there, the first tether to his humanity that they’d severed. Connections like that didn’t exist down there. Especially not for souls that were
other than just staying in bed, or he would end up staying awake the entire night. Of course, Dean’s hopes that he’d be able to leave without disturbing Cas proved to be utterly futile, the arms around him tightening as he was met with a sleepy noise in protest.
Chaps 167, 168, 169, 178, 192, 198, 205, 215, 221, 237, 253, 265— but willfully ignorant people will remain willfully ignorant
get here fast enough to sit vigil at your bedside with barely a moment’s notice, only to flutter away when the possibility of actual communication between the two of you would occur?”
I might have a parent who was proud of me, who accepted me for who I am. And then every time I tried to leave again after that, he managed to pull me back in with his bullshit about family and trust and obedience because despite everything I’ve done, everything I’ve worked to change in my life, some part of me is
Chap 156— dean would try to work out where they are but he's distracted by cas' general existence <3
The day Cas had eventually decided on was the day he’d been pulled out of the Empty by Dean, which happened to be in early spring. They’d considered a few other options, including the day Jimmy had been born and the day Cas had first pulled Dean out of Hell, but none of them felt as right as the day he’d officially entered into this new life with Dean. It’d been a rebirth of sorts, after all, especially considering that it had been the day he officially lost his grace once and for all.
I'll just have to aim to finish the whole thing off at a similarly nice number when it comes to it :)
Sometimes, though, it’s clear what has happened almost immediately. Usually, those situations are cleared up almost instantly, either by Dean and Cas displaying some form of slightly-too-romantic-to-be-brushed-away-but-not-romantic-enough-to-make-Dean-panic act of PDA, or by them outright correcting whoever it was that had made a comment about what a good ‘friendship’ they had.
Cas would’ve liked watching the storm, probably, in that same way he found most things about earth beautiful. He would’ve sat uncomfortably on the ground next to them, looking almost adorably out of place in his own body, and Dean would’ve found himself watching Cas just as much as the rain outside. He’d probably have shared a fact about what bees did when it rained, as earnest as he always was about his favourite insect, and maybe their hands would’ve linked across Miracle’s back, a solid weight reminding each other that they weren’t alone.
as always im bullshitting all of this ignore if its explicitly against canon lore please and thank <3
this one was again hard to write, because I've been distracted by reading, packing, and enrolling in uni(!!) today lol
Eventually, something had to give. Cas knew that, had known it since he first acknowledged who Dean was to him, and every day more he spent avoiding the inevitable conversation made it more and more difficult to broach. But he’d have to, and soon— Sam had been sending him worried looks recently, as if he was gearing himself up to ask Cas what was wrong, and he’d found himself avoiding Dean, which was neither sustainable nor something he was enjoying.
hey y'all, its ur friendly neighbourhood destiel drabble writer back at it again with another fucking au
“Good,” he said, and before Dean could ask him to clarify further, a frantic Cas appeared in a flutter of wings.
Dean sighed, putting his rice back down on the table, and very determinedly did not look in her direction.
, but I’m sure some people do. And anyway, what if I’d been watching it without acknowledging why? Finding one dude hot doesn’t necessarily scream ‘bi’, you know.”
vced with my best friend today and it was a good vibe. i hope we can see each other in person again soon :(
“Oh, because you’re the foremost expert on all things Cas now?” She asked, before softening a little when his cheeks flushed darker and he stammered out an awkward response. “He’s okay, he just picked up a bug from a co-worker. He should be back in class next week.”
enemies to lovers cont (chaps 30, 60)— more pettiness, but some truths are being unintentionally signalled to each other
obvious, people just. Assume everyone is straight. And I had my own stuff to work through before acknowledging your feelings, because acknowledging
“No, I did talk to him. I asked him for help on the upcoming assignment for Professor Crowley’s class.”
as he did it, he deftly swapped what pen he was using without Cas noticing and handed another empty one across.
and that Cas had died in front of him, for possibly the last time, had felt so much joy from the simple act of loving Dean— well, he hadn’t had time to stop and think about the future. All he cared about was rescuing Cas, no matter what it took, because a world without him in it wasn’t one worth existing in.
Dean didn’t reply immediately, instead looking away awkwardly and rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, but he relaxed when he realised Cas was sincere rather than teasing.
ok idr if i noted this when i published the first lil bit, but this is a historical au in the sense that I'm taking random historical vibes and setting it in a world without modern technology, but I'm not overly sticking to like. language use at the time or period-typical homophobia, because its a very self-indulgent au. i hope yall don't mind dszfjkncgvdbzl,bvj
“Look, I’d just show you, but it’s too fucking cold for me to be pulling my shirt off right now. They say ‘I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.’”
“Ah, and you decided you needed a bit of a pick-me-up before spending a few hours in his company? I can relate. I love my younger brother — Sammy — but he’s got a boundless amount of enthusiasm about him, and it can be a bit much to deal with sometimes.”
Sam sighed, the noise crackling through the line and doing nothing to soothe Dean’s fractured nerves.
Dean, of course, notices something’s up. How could he not? They’ve been best friends for years now, since before they were old enough to worry about cooties or any of the other arbitrary excuses children are conditioned into giving to stick with same-gendered friends, and the slight distance her and Dean had still been holding even in the wake of his break up with Lisa didn’t change that.
Shouldn’t have been so harsh on Dean every time he messed up as a child, to the point where even now, the thought of Sam getting so much as a papercut due to Dean’s mistakes seemed unforgivable.
the time to be wondering if his marriage would ever become anything more, he was worried enough about remembering everything involved in the ceremony.
“I don’t really know what you want me to say, Dean. I thought— Well— It seemed fairly self-explanatory to me.”
this isn't a continuation of a previously posted drabble but is also not a new idea, aka I'm still in evil clown movie hell not super mega gay hell 😔😔
times and am in a committed relationship with a dude-shaped being that loves me. That should be enough.”
Dean stared at him silently for another moment, and Castiel fought the urge to squirm under his scrutiny. Is this how Dean usually felt, when he gave in to his urge to watch the other man? If so, Cas could understand his protests more.
Cas could tell, Dean knew, and he didn’t know if he should feel guilty about that or not. He never wanted Cas to think he was ashamed of him, because he
what spn really needed was a moment where sam and dean were checking into a motel or smthing with Cas not having entered reception yet and the usual obligatory w*ncest joke of the season happens so dean and sam do the ew no he's my brother thing then cas walks in and the receptionist sees dean and cas interacting and is like oh
If Cas had been expecting commiseration from Meg, he’d be sorely disappointed. Because his traitor of a best friend just threw her head back and cackled.
not me setting this up and still having like, no concrete plan of how I'm pulling cas out lmaoooooooooooooooooooo
he saw the glint of a metal handled shovel in the low grass, right behind where the other man had just been. He pulled his eye-line away finally to instead smirk at the blue-eyed man in front of him. He felt like him and Castiel would get along
them as a manipulation tactic. Everything he’d said had been couched in layers of protection, innuendo surrounding vague implications that relied on the knowledge on the previous hints he’d made at Dean (and, presumably, Castiel) as well as the fact that neither of them had cheated on their assignment. He hadn’t gotten any clearer than his request for them to complete ‘extra-credit’ assignments for him, with the rest of the meeting consisting of him encouraging them both to ‘consider their options carefully’ and reminders that he was tenured and thus could ‘clear things up easily if they cooperated’.
“Jimmy stated that he feels slightly uncomfortable with the idea of us indulging in intimacy while he is conscious, because of the ‘whole wife-and-kids deal’, as you put it, but that he is
But Gabriel had no qualms about tactically manoeuvring Dean around the ballroom as they talked, going from conversation to conversation in such a way that before long, they were not only on the same side of the ballroom as Castiel, but genuinely engaged in a conversation with him and a few other nobles.
And shouldn’t have made Dean feel like the only way to survive was to shove an entire half of his sexuality away from any potentially prying eyes, as if the worst crime he could possibly commit was falling in love with a guy.
Cas huffed out a laugh at that, but speed up obligingly, and Dean managed to avoid tensing even more than he already had. They still weren’t moving anywhere near ‘quickly’, closer to a brisk walking pace than a sprint, but it was enough to make his heart rate raise briefly. He didn’t know
“Comes with the territory of a newish relationship, unfortunately. Just remember to bring things up to me if you’re worried about them, okay babe? If you
The receptionist at the hotel they were checking into seemed new to her job, but not so much so that it was a real annoyance. She was just slower than Dean had expected from the efficiency he’d been met with when he’d initially called in to book a week or so ago, and got slightly flustered when something in the system tripped her up.
Chaps 121, 124, 132, 149, 154, 171, 183— dean manages to finish the conversation without dropping anything. score!
Of course, ultimately, Sam’s protests meant nothing. Dean had made a choice he couldn’t back out of, and no amount of research was going to get him to
Dean, who had stopped kneading as Cas explained, found himself leaning over the bench to cup Cas’ face with a floury hand and pull him in for a soft kiss. It had taken them far longer than most would have to reach this place of soft comforts and slow, meandering days, and sometimes Dean liked the reminded that this was what his future would be, as long as he wished it to be so. There was another moment of quiet, and Cas pulled back to continue applying the polish.

“Aw yeah, Cas, I figured you’d get there eventually! I know you enjoy the stuff we’ve been showing you, but everyone has slightly different tastes in media. So what is it? A new tv show? A book series?”

damage to the Winchesters. Even if you ignored the individual losses it had brought them, it was a fire that had forced them into this life in the first place, and a fire that pulled Sam back in.
With these words, Dean gestured vaguely behind him before turning and leaving, feeling slightly guilty for leaving Cas alone when he was so obviously vulnerable. But Cas didn’t want to talk about it, and they were just friends, no matter what the clenching in his gut that he felt whenever Cas so much as
Because of course, things changed— Sam sent them much more overt eyebrow wiggles when they went off to spend time alone with each other, Cas fell asleep in Dean’s bed just as often as his own now, and kissing regularly was a
Unwittingly, Cas found his mind flitting back to the image of green eyes that had burned through his mind so strongly, and his instinctive feel that they were Deans, although he shook the thought off immediately.
This particular habit of his was never more evident than on the days that Castiel came into the coffee shop him and Benny worked at.
Was gonna respond to comments but have a massive headache, sorry guys! I do read them as they come in but like my usual habit of responding just before/after posting as it makes it easier to tell if I’ve missed one

“That would— That would friggin’ suck, Sammy, I’m not denying that. But even without my Words, even in a world where I thought I was signing my legitimate death warrant by making that deal, I would’ve done it. I
Cas shook his head, tugging on Dean’s hand lightly as he moved forwards at the same meandering pace they’d held since they first entered the gardens.
“How would your Words reassure me? Because I gotta tell you, Dean, if they aren’t ‘I can get you out of your demon deal immediately,’ I don’t think I’m gonna stop being pissed.”
“I just— I keep trying to think of ways to get around this that don’t involve giving in to what he wants, but I can’t think of any. If it was only me, I’d be fine, my dad never believed I’d get this far anyway. I’d just be living up to expectations. But you— You’re smart and have a future and all that shit. I don’t want one dickhead of a professor to take that away from you, especially as I’m sure he’s gonna find a way to implicate the previous work we’ve done in his units as well.”
“Did you maybe think about the fact that when you guys meet up to work on it, it will be incredibly obvious that you don’t
Honestly, given the ridiculous amount of stammering he’d done when faced with Cas’ bright blue stare, it was a miracle Cas had decided to give the coffee shop another go.

, I trust him more than anyone else, and if I’m in a relationship with someone I want to know they’ll get along well with him as early as possible. Also, it makes for an easy escape if they end up being a creep.”
They hadn’t always, but Cas had recently begun selling the honey he’d been harvesting at a nearby farmers market, alongside cutesy bee themed crafts he’d been making, and although he’d decided to donate most of his proceeds (it’s not like they’d ever really needed a traditional source of income), he had been saving money to spend on Dean (and the rest of their family and friends) as well.
As Castiel finally reached him and their hands linked in front of them, his thoughts turned back to that idea anyway. He’d just have to wait and see.
Chaps 39, 40, 66, 84, 142, 150, 196, 207, 230, 234— 😳 wh— what— 😳😳 what if they held hands while talking about their lives 😳😳😳
why Ellen trusted him so much. Hell, outside of the fact that he’d literally given her specific instructions on how to summon him and only him in future situations where she needed emergency magical assistance, there were points where Cas seemed… genuinely
Well, that and the group of tattooed strangers who were all currently pointing weapons at the both of them.
Back at the bunker, Sam found himself staring worriedly at the space that Dean had disappeared from over an hour before. He’d known they had no real sense of how long it would take to rescue Cas, knew they weren’t even sure it was
Then, he gets pulled back out of Hell by unknown forces, and every single thing he’d been worrying about on the way down was thrown into disarray.

“Look, Dean, I don’t wanna make assumptions here, but… Have you considered it’s because of where you’ve been taking your dates?”
This was usually a signal that they were slated to meet their soulmate soon. Not immediately, not even necessarily in the next year, but soon enough that fate kicked into high gear to say ‘Hey. Remember this person. Reach out to them when you meet in person.’
It isn’t until he coughs up a flower petal one afternoon that he realises this is something serious.
Dean conceded the point, and ten minutes later found himself sitting on the floor of his living room (he didn’t eat on the couch when Charlie was over anymore, they’d had too many spills that way for him to risk having his carton of food anywhere that wasn’t a flat, stable, and unmovable surface) with Charli staring at him expectantly. When he just calmly kept eating his food, attention focused on the Star Trek rerun they’d put on in the background, Charlie huffed and reached for the remote.
i really default to morning vibes when I'm tired from having a good day where i saw frens etc lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooo

From there, more traits would be revealed. Their laugh. A silhouette of them ducking their head shyly. Or, in Dean’s case, the flutter of massive, jet black
He could try to leave now, of course, slipping out of his bonds and hoping he’d make it out of the camp without being noticed, but that seemed risky. While staying in place fighting the goblins head-on was no safer, at least he’d have the element of surprise on his side.

“As he is my vessel, I would like to keep things as comfortable as possible until we find some other solution for how I could obtain a vessel that is wholly my own.”
“Stick it in the ‘seemingly completely normal and mundane shit’ pile,” he said. “We can check it over again later.”

He noted down the order she gave, focused enough to at least act semi-competent at his job, but his eyes kept drifting to stare at Cas through the next couple of orders. Most of his customers seemed too caffeine-deprived to notice, but to his misfortune, Charlie had
logically, Cas is doing it. He’s trying to give Dean his space, trying to work out how to navigate their new dynamic now that his feelings are out in the open— trying to avoid pressuring Dean into responding in any way he didn’t want to or was not ready to.
how Cas would react, for the most part— Cas had done the harder part. All Dean needed to do was man up and go ‘Hey, you know all that shit you said just before you died? Yeah, me too, actually,’ and he and Cas could go riding off into the sunset together.
this is the start of a five + 1 fic theoretically however I don't have all of the five planned out yet so we shall see. if I can't think of more scenarios I might cheat and make it a 3 + 1 fic but that's less fun
Dean had a soulmate somewhere, and she was waiting for him to crash into her life and uproot it in all the best ways, just as he had Castiel’s. It didn’t matter that he was becoming more and more sure that the individual he was dreaming of each night was Dean— he was an angel, after all.
Dean continued to feel faintly amused by it all, but that feeling was quickly overtaken with determination.
“The way you’ve phrased that implies that this isn’t the only flying lesson you’re planning on giving me, and I would like to point out that I barely agreed to

“Well, I suggested swapping numbers so we could meet up to work on the assignment together, but he said he ended up getting it done after all.”
On the surface, Dean’s idea seemed perfect. The solution was so blindingly simple in some ways that it was a miracle they hadn’t thought of it before.
so todays been. all over the place mentally. i woke up in a better headspace than yesterday which was good but obvs was fairly tired + had to speed do the jobs i didn't get done yesterday in the hour and a half i had after waking till an agent came in and evaluated the house, so that was draining. then i was kinda just tryna keep my mental health up but i had a uni class in which i proceeded to comprehend 0 of the content so imma have to rewatch the recording later. then the high point came— i was talking to one of my best friends abt gender and she asked if i'd ordered a binder yet and then when she found out i hadn't yet bc the governments bein a bitch abt my id so my welfare payment hasn't gone through yet she immediately was like 'well my payment
Dean, sensing that Cas wasn’t about to take up the implicit offer his hand had symbolised, shoved it back into his jacket pocket.
At that, Magnus’ eyes dropped briefly, and an overwhelming sense of loss seemed to wash over him. Alec grasped his hand gently, care in his every movement, but Magnus was already wearing his bright grin again as he looked between Dean and Cas.
“Yeah, Cas, but you’re annoying as shit. That’s not gonna change if we’re stuck in close proximity to each other for long periods at a time. If anything, we’ll be
as a gift from God, but it wasn’t like the dude was hanging around these days. Making the pairings was almost certainly the job of some random angel these days, and messing with fate so that the Michael sword didn’t have a completed bond? That seemed exactly like something those dickbags would do. And having said incomplete bond be to an angel, one that they thought they had under their control, one that Dean would do almost
be after a meeting like that, but he knew he’d have to work out some plan of how to handle everything with Cas. It wasn’t just him that Azazel was fucking over with this, after all.
exciting anyway as i wasn't feeling body dysphoria (which like, i may also not b feeling body dysphoria tomorrow as genderfluidity can be a stab in the dark as to what the vibe is and even if I'm not dysphoric imma cry when i put it on for my future self but something abt the idea of me wearing it for the first time on a day where i wanna cut my boobs off appeals to me.
He isn’t quite sure what he was expecting, honestly. A part of him was worried that it would feel strange, that he wouldn’t enjoy it— that it would somehow make all these feelings inside of him go away, as though the years of devotion and love they’d built between them could be destroyed so easily. Another part of him thought it would be the most amazing first kiss he’d ever had, because how couldn’t it be? It was

it, as much trouble as it had and would cause him. He just wasn’t willing to leave Sammy at the hands of the fae without at least attempting to rescue him, and that meant travelling into the forest.
would u believe this wasn't even rly the scene i had in my mind today lol. i was more thinking abt cas' perspective slfgvzjn. this au as a whole is less angsty than the dreams one, despite what this scene depicts lol
adding in the weird mix of intentions people could have, especially considering he was apparently fairly conventionally attractive. Romantic and sexual interest seemed too easy to mix up with platonic intentions, even more so in the early stages, and Cas was tired of missing the signs. How did you work out someone was showing
wew typed a thing and reloaded the page accidentally anyway things have Not been resolved with friend yet I can't be fucked retyping everything I had written in this a/n prior to reloading but basically she responded in a way that was both positive and negative I initially was like 'ok ill work at that!' and left it bc I do wanna maintain this friendship then realised maintaining it only that way would still not be healthy for me when I talked it through with other people again. sent another much more strongly worded message and had not received a response when I checked a few hours ago (like the first message was more 'uwu we've drifted a lot this year and I miss you :(' vibes and the second was 'actually fuck this I'm setting down what my personal emotional needs are and seeing if you're going to meet me halfway or not') and I'm terrified it'll be the or not option bc like. this is the girl I considered my closest friend prior to this. she's the person I always imagined being by my side through major life events, esp since we didn't go to the same high school so I 'knew' we were sustainable even during busy periods as we'd never seen each other every day or anything like that except for when we first became friends. i really don't wanna lose the friendship(/only maintain it in the sense that we see each other at group events) but I just. can't go on like this.
unusual was the fact that Dean wasn’t entirely sure why he’d woken up in the first place. He was in the bunker, not a motel, so the likelihood of an unexpected attack was as low as it really could be, considering everything. He hadn’t had a nightmare, hadn’t dreamt at all as far as he could remember, and there wasn’t the now-familiar wail of an awake and upset baby echoing through the bunker. Cas’s side of the bed was empty, but the angel kept odd enough hours that Dean doubted that that alone had been enough to rouse him, especially as it felt cold enough to signify that it had been a while since he’d gotten up.
prefer to read, that’s fine too. I’m sure I can get someone else to help me out with my sunscreen, at least.”
how low they were, his brain automatically started telling him they were higher than they were. Cas left him in silence for a few moments, staying hovering in the same position mid-air, but he eventually spoke up.
“Well, angel, that’s what credit-card frauds for,” Dean winked, and Cas smiled even as he rolled his eyes.
a home now. Having a guaranteed place to rest his head every night. Knowing that no matter what else happened, he could always find comfort and safety in the bunker. Would always have that stability that he had so often dreamt of growing up, even if not in the exact way he expected.
did I write this purely because I realised I’ve never had Cas say assbutt in one of these? maybe. and like. looking at the fandom page for it (which i was both delighted and not surprised to find), he says it like 3 times in canon. I still love it though.
successfully had caffeine today without fucking myself over!! it often makes me hella anxious but i judged myself and decided it was worse the risk, and it gave me the right amount of energy and focus to chat on my friends stream and i didn't have a panic attack. progress!!!
Obviously, everyone had different connections to their deadnames. There was often a reason that parents chose the names they did, and having that connection could be, well. Nice. Especially in his case, where he didn’t have any other real connection to his mother or her side of the family. He’d never met the original Deanna, she’d died before he was born apparently, but he liked to imagine she’d been nice.
Although Alec’s face stayed about the same as it had through the rest of their conversation, Dean could recognise the glimmer of interest that entered his eyes at that little titbit. It was one he’d seen on Sammy on many,
love him was laughable at best. Bobby might be an exception, but Bobby had practically raised him and Sammy, so that changed things. It was hard to hate someone when you’d seen them before they were tall enough to reach the kitchen counter.
There was a beat of silence, and he wondered why no one had spoken yet before he noticed Charlie staring at him pointedly. He shook his head at her, not wanting to deal with
Thing is, Dean knew it was sometimes ridiculous. He was willing to do almost anything to get a smile out of his partner, too in love with the soft looks he was rewarded with to care about the personal effort or loss that was involved in that quest.
Cas visibly tensed at his words, and Sam paused for a second before he fully registered what that meant
see the girl Cas usually sat next to in class — Meg, if he was remembering correctly — and battled with himself for a moment before going over to speak with her.
“I’ve found your reservation, but I think it was booked wrong,” she explained. “I just need to work out how to change… Got it! Ok, I’ll just grab your room key.”
“You as well!” Cas said, turning and Dean smiled after him before shaking his head and returning his focus back to his work.
“Dean,” Cas said, poking his head out of the hotel bathroom. “Why is there a box labelled ‘bath bombs’ sitting on the counter?”
worry that this isn’t exciting enough for him (especially since Cas played a sport that involved tossing around a ball that was literally designed to explode at any moment), but he knew his boyfriend well enough to know that Cas was revelling in their closeness and his own relaxed state just as much as he did the fancy manoeuvres involved in Quodpot.
Castiel frowned down at his page as his pen apparently decided to stop working. After a quick glance across at the page Dean had been doodling idly on, he held his hand out for Dean’s instead. Ignoring the voice in the back of his head that was whispering ‘
the writing braincell has truly abandoned me once more,,,, i had it for a week and now it's lost to the void forever
“Are you saying she flirted with you so you bought stuff from her stall?” He asked, not actually concerned even if that
“Oh shit, sorry Dean, I would’ve waited thirty minutes if I’d realised you had your class with him today. This isn’t
sort of bedside vigil. Sitting in silence for hours, yeah, but not the physical affection. That was more a spouse or girlfriend's domain, and he wasn’t exactly in fast supply of either of those. But still, it had to be Sam.
“We’ll be with you in a second,” he said, receiving a patient nod, and he turned back to take the pan off of Dean.
sorry if there are tense issues lol i can't be bothered checking this that closely yet but i know i tend to mess up when i get into like, imagining vibes
Dean grinned, almost involuntarily, and he swung their clasped hands lightly as they continued walking.
So, i was weirdly productive with writing today, and a) got the drabble for today written early as fuck in the day and b) actually finished the soulmate dreams au after that! I've posted the chapter from deans pov
“Benny was the son of one of the previous royal guards,” Dean explained, “So he’s been training at the castle for most of his life. We actually trained together when I went through combat classes, and we’ve been friends ever since.”
writing crack is good for the soul tbh, high key recommend it based on the two experiences I've had lately (my ever given fic and yesterdays drabble). we had a bunch of people over to help prep the outside of the house for selling, it was kinda whack. i also had an interesting convo abt attraction and the ways we personally experience it w one of my two best friends today, so that was cool
the writing braincell did not bless me w its presence today soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sorry that this is. questionable. and not a full scene. i wasn't in the right vibe for most of the aus i have going (for writing in general tbh) (including this one tbh) bUT when I came up with this idea i did some brainstorming of ideas for scenes and shit so i figured that chipping away at this is better than nothing
It’s all small, easily explainable things— pen lines on his fingers in colours he can’t remember using that day, faint splotches on his skin that aren’t washing off in the shower as easily as he’d expect. Things that could’ve happened in the past without him raising an eyebrow.
chaps 7, 101, 109— if ur thinking that it seems like im avoiding the actually grooming part by having them continually talk, u might be right. not intentionally, I just dk how to describe it. but you know what I
“Thank you, Dean. You look good as well. Though I must ask, is there any reason in particular you’re so nervous?”
for some reason my vibes this week have truly just been disaster gays. hence these drabbles all centring around them. its a mood for sure.
The grin that split Sam’s face was positively huge, and a second later Dean found himself wrapped up in a tight embrace that screamed ‘proud younger brother.’ Sam pulled away a moment later, mindful of the boundaries Dean had set up around ‘chick flick moments’, but the smile stayed firmly on his face.
assignments to prove that you have the knowledge required for your assignments, I’m willing to inform the board that some unfortunate accident occurred with our software and that it was a false alarm.”
At least this way, he’d find some peace in his sleep. He wasn’t going to talk to Dean about it, however, even
I. Uh. Got very distracted by reddie today. genuinely if I end up writing a non spn drabble any time soon, it’s probably gonna be about them, because genuinely they’re probably my favourite pairing even when I’m hyperfixated on other fandoms, and it takes almost nothing to pull me back into it. Like at one point I fell back in by reading my own goddamn writing after sending a fic I wrote to a new friend.
It all came to a head about a month later, when Dean walked into Cas' room once again only to find him sobbing his eyes out on the bed, crying harder than Dean had seen him do so even considering recent events. Dean hurried forwards towards Cas, breaking every self-imposed boundary he had placed since the first time he’d caught Cas like this, dropping to his knees to look the angel in the eye.
Obviously, the easiest way for Dean to figure this all out would be to write something to his soulmate. He didn’t know anything right now— didn’t know if he’d had a blocked connection somehow, or if this had only just developed; didn’t know how things had seemed from his soulmate’s perspective.
“But what if the family that ends up adopting one of them would’ve otherwise gotten an older cat, one that’s lived at the shelter far longer?”
Sam stopped, somehow caught more off-guard by the prospect of Dean sharing his Words than he had been at his casual nonchalance around going to Hell.
Dean tried to not look pleased at the revelation, but he wasn’t sure he succeeded. He couldn’t help it, knowing that the guy he was crushing on definitely batted for his team was a relief, as well as adding more weight to Sam’s insistence that Cas had been flirting with him.
s o i didnt end up reading the memoir today because last night my brain was like "sleep? no thank u <3" then I had to do shit for our open inspection and I spent most of the day completely fucking exhausted. hopefully I'll get a good nights rest tonight and have the energy for like. life in general tomorrow even outside of school commitments
Dean wasn’t quite sure what he expected to find in Cas’ room after the angel asked him to swing by, but it certainly wasn’t this.
“Damn, Cas, who knew that a cute face would be all it took to convince you to buy something? Would you buy strawberries from
Castiel looked up from where he was sitting on the couch and nodded. Dean grinned and walked forward to close the couple of metres space between them before offering his hand to Cas.
of activities available to us,” Dean said, hooking an arm around Cas’ waist as they stood in front of the corkboard.
“Cas, you remember how allergies work, right? Like, the thing where cat fur makes me sneezy and miserable to be around?”
he’d try to pull you back in I never would’ve left without warning you. Even if only by telling you to change your number. I just thought after the way things went down when you ended up leaving—”
Sammy sighed and sent a tight smile in Cas’ direction, trying to convey that his frustration wasn’t with the other man.
I'm not 100% happy with this— was tryna decide if i should bring in dialogue yet or not and decided to but I'm not sure if it flows how i want. i may end up rewriting part of it at some stage, possibly when it theoretically hits the 'publish on it's own' stage of being a story lol
are two very different things, and something about waking up next to the very obvious evidence that Cas was now a ‘full eight hours’ kinda guy made Dean feel. Odd. He just… couldn’t quite wrap his head around everything Cas was giving up, and the sudden reminder that Cas was slowly and surely becoming fully human was somewhat jarring.
“Guess we should get you into some first aid classes, huh? For now, though, I trust that you know how to slap a band-aid on it for me.”
“So you know the guard… well, then?” Cas asked, shifting his hand to interlock their fingers after a moment, and Dean flushed lightly as he looked down at where their hands were joined.
The next time it happens, it’s also not immediately obvious. Cas hadn’t quite managed to wrap his head around the fact that their waitress had been completely oblivious to their relationship, and Dean — who had spent literal
That was between him and God, and Dean had some fairly major doubts that the dude existed in the first place.
The decision, however, was taken (quite literally) out of his hands a moment later, when he finished coughing only for Sam to spy the latest blood-soaked petal and snatch it out of his hands before he could hide it from view.
Sure, right now it was still fresh and new, and that fact was probably contributing to his newfound habit of obnoxiously referring to Cas as his husband at literally every available opportunity, but it wasn’t like Dean could
“Yeah, Sammy’s a good kid,” he agreed. “But what kinda older brother would I be if I missed the chance to rag on him?”
I've left this vague in terms of auness on purpose, I figure it works better that way. you can choose to interpret it however u want
“I’m glad you’re getting into the spirit of it all,” Cas replied. “I’m looking forward to decorating with you.”
i named the lady susan bc it felt weird not having a name for her, and edited the first chap covering this encounter to reflect that fact fkzghdfk
Dean had noticed, of course. Dean always noticed. But rather than bothering with ultimately meaningless platitudes in an attempt to reassure Cas, he just shrugged with a wry grin.
idea. I begrudgingly agreed, and we’ve thus far completed two of your suggested activities. That counts as a success, surely.”
“Yep! It’s scientifically proven to promote healing. It’s less powerful than a kiss from a current angel, of course, but that just means you require more doses.”
“I’m going to bed early even if you’re not, Cas, but I always sleep better when you’re there. So will you come with me, at least? You can even perve at me for old-times-sake!”
Azazel gestured in a way that seemed to convey disbelief at the claim, but his eyes sharpened, and a sinking feeling abruptly hit Dean’s stomach.
To start with, he was a light sleeper, and for all the faults his father had had in raising Dean, a lack of survival skills was
The two of them were together in their current hotel room, getting ready for a morning intel meeting with Sam. The latest case wasn’t as catastrophic as some were, but they were looking to bust the spirit sooner rather than later.
So when Sam stalked out of Dean’s room, furiously praying to the wayward angel in the irreverent way that Dean always favoured, only to run smack-bang into him in the middle of the waiting room, he could be forgiven for his shock. And when he glared at Cas and declared that Dean now knew
continued the trend of not being overly bad but also not being like, properly good today which! considering a friends bday party was today but i couldn't go bc of not having transport options to get home safely (also the fact that i probably still wouldn't be up to something w that much social interaction) and was obviously kinda sad abt missing out, that's an achievement!
“He’d implied certain things to me in the past, but I always assumed I was misreading the situation. I’m… often not good at understanding social cues.”
today's drabble is a continuation from yesterdays but not a direct continuation bc i actually wrote slightly more yesterday than what i posted but posting something i hadn't written today felt illegal. this is also not all of what I wrote today because genuinely I think i might end up posting this as a oneshot/twoshot eventually it just vibes in my brain
If he couldn’t figure out how to get out of ropes binding his arms soon, he figured he could consider his luck well and truly run out. And he likely wouldn’t be afforded the privilege of a quick and painless death before being tossed on the fire tonight.
“Dean, I know how it feels to know that the are issues in the world that you can’t fix. I myself have struggled with this since coming down to earth, especially in the wake of losing my grace. But it’s important to try and remember that you are just one man. One man that’s had far too much responsibility placed upon his shoulders. You have done far more for humanity than anyone will ever know. It is not your responsibility to fix everything wrong in the world, even if some part of you feels like you should try.”
come back, just because he was in the hospital, to sit at his bedside, he wouldn’t be clasping Dean’s hand like this. That stepped across the invisible barrier they’d set up for themselves, the line they’d drawn in the sand years ago now. It was just Sammy being overly dramatic over him being unconscious for whatever reason.
“Aw, come on Cas, surely you know everything takes ten times longer in the kitchen than you think it will when you’re first starting out? Because you’re less practised at chopping and all that sorta shit. It’s better to start early than end up having dinner an hour later than you planned.”
“Uh, bath bombs are these fizzy coloured and scented things some people put in their baths,” he explained, and Cas nodded.
“Ooh, and just before midterms as well. That’s extra shitty. I hope things look up from here at least?”
happy mothers day to all the good mothers in the world! y'all are icons even though a part of me feels y'all arent the demographic I'm reaching with this fic. this message is more for the void.
“It’s not your responsibility to look after me like this all the time! You need to live for yourself too!”
mental health check! today was a bit whack as i like. was in a better vibe emotionally but was also all over the place in other ways. by which i mean i was hyper as fuck for no apparent reason from 10am, making focusing on work rly hard, then i crashed just before 3 and was brain fogged as fuck. but hey i was properly experiencing emotions and i got work done (even if less than planned) so that's not so bad!
Sure enough, his best friend was standing on the other side of the counter, a cocky grin plastered across his freckled face.
The ugly stepsisters cut off their toes to try and fit the glass slippers. The little mermaid never got her Prince Charming. And Dean is haunted by everything he’d been through and everything he’d had to do in order to survive as long as he had.
i'm in a weird vibe today, so have a very very self-indulgent au. a lot of what Cas will go through in this mimics what I personally went through when working out my gender shit, although he will end up at a slightly different place than I did — I stick around the 'female' side of things more closely than the male side, but that doesn't fit Cas in my mind as well (like i have demi-boy days occasionally but don't seem to ever be fully male, and tend to swing between being agender, demi-girl, gendered non-binary, and fully female, while I see him hanging around the masc side of things more but having fully female days still) — , which is why I made him AFAB and referred to him with she/her pronouns in this. that will change as things get worked out in his mind, but I'm using the pronouns he personally thinks of himself with at any given moment. this is not meant to be a prescriptive depiction of genderfluidity, as we all have v varying experiences and deal with things in varying ways, and is just me projecting helplessly onto characters as a coping mechanism. at least it's not another college au (yet sdkfxj they in hs rn,,,,)!!
“Ah, yes,” Alec said, turning his attention back to them as well. “Dean, Cas, meet Magnus Lightwood-Bane, High Warlock of Brooklyn. Magnus, meet Dean and Castiel Winchester.”
happy pride y'all!!!!! i forgot to say it yesterday as it's celebrated a lil earlier in melb but the internet/world rly do be americentric at times dfjkszsd
This time he let his lips linger, a hand coming up to cradle the back of Cas’ head, and Castiel brought his arms up to wrap around Dean’s body in return. He softened with the kiss, loosening as Dean’s other hand rubbed his back gently, and his mouth parted with a gasp when Dean tugged at his hair.
was gonna have this slightly longer but its exactly 100 words which gives me good vibes and im tired. had a friend over today which was a good mental health vibe esp since theres still no progression on the situation with my other friend
, but you’ll go through them at half the speed you used to. And anyway,” With his next words, Dean leaned in to peck Cas again, not pulling away after. “I know
But other times, when he felt himself slipping into the now-familiar darkness brought on by sleep, surrounded by the warmth of the duvet and Dean’s embrace, he knew that he’d traded the sleepless nights for something much,
to be. This wasn’t his body anymore, hadn’t been for years now. But when he blinked, nothing changed.
the warm comfort of Cas’ arms around him, the sweet smell of honey that seemed to follow his angel wherever he went, the slight scratch of stubble where Cas was nosing the side of his neck. He moved his head to capture Cas’ lips in a gentle kiss before turning in Cas’ hold to return the loving embrace. Cas’ blue eyes blinked at him seriously, and Dean couldn’t help but tug him into a firmer kiss, hand threading up into his hair as Cas’ hand slipped up under the back of his shirt. They probably had five more minutes before their friends realised they’d both snuck off, and he was gonna make them count.
Like, he knew it was a part of parenthood— the tiny baby he’d held in his arms when they first brought Jack home had to turn into one of the snarky teenagers he taught every day
“I— you know she’d want you to be happy, right? She wouldn’t want you to live your entire life without finding that sorta connection again. Also, it doesn’t
It was only a chaste thing, as tender and sweet as every first kiss with your soulmate ought to be, but both Cas and Dean were left grinning stupidly at each other at the end of it.
Cas looked at him, concerned, and Dean pulled his arm back to scratch the back of his neck awkwardly.
my sister continues to be The Best™, a guy friend of hers is going through his wardrobe and she's getting me hand-me-downs from him as well <3
A relationship was supposed to be built on communication, however, and even if it was something he usually found himself avoiding at all costs, Dean was trying to do things
“Yeah, woulda been nice to know that you’ve been walking around with my matching mark for the last couple of months!”
want coffee, but he wasn’t sure he trusted Cas with the task. It was, after all, the perfect opportunity for them to fuck with each other.
also been having weird name vibes today bc I go by Em, which is a short form of my birth/deadname, and it feels more right than said deadname but it doesn't feel fully right(/doesn't 100% of the time) but idk what i'd change it to? like, i'd want it to be an 'Em' name (or something that's Pronounced with that sound even if its spelt different) bc i like that connection to my deadname but none of the Em names I've seen feel like me,,,,
closets they could’ve put their clothes into, but Dean had declared it ‘too much effort’ on the first day they had arrived and Cas hadn’t felt inclined to disagree. Some habits broke hard, and Dean somewhat doubted he’d
So even though it’d been months now since Cas had fully given up his grace, Dean felt a rush of amused affection pass through him when he looked up in the evenings to see him pouting petulantly at nothing, as though he could will the tiredness from his body.
accidentally wrote a hannibal drabble today that I'm probably never gonna post anywhere as I don't expect to put it in a full story but that's how life be sometimes. its kinda a vibe it could either work as the epilogue to an au story centred around hannibal & will OR as the intro to a story more focused on abigail. alternatively, it could be the bridge between said two stories. maybe i will take it somewhere further eventually. when i started the drabble i didn't even fully realise it was for Hannibal zsdkjvhzk.
imagined trusting a decade ago, back when he and Cas first met. Sam was a familiar presence behind him, and he smiled at Charlie in her position behind Cas. He met Cas’ eyes again, then grinned when he saw the look of slight concern on his angel’s face. Cas could always read him so well.
happened to write for fbawtft, which is one of the fandoms i curiously check to see what ships/fic tropes the author has written for in order to get a judge of them (supernatural is another for Obvious Reasons, but i often check marvel and BNHA as well) and then found out they wrote one of my favourite fb fics and reread it before rereading all my bookmarked ones lol. i have. problems.
this is shorter than i meant it to be lol but my brain bluescreened halfway thru so i did not get through everything i meant to
of bringing the two bachelor parties so close to each other, less than a street apart. He was almost 100% sure it had been a complete accident on Sammy’s side.
They’d both spent so much time denying themselves the things they both obviously wanted that being freely allowed to indulge in their mutual affection for each other was taking some getting used to, and he wasn’t sure how best to remedy that fact.
He could understand why so many people had made those assumptions, for all that the idea made him want to vomit— they were two obviously close guys travelling together who didn’t necessarily look like siblings at first glance. It was an easy leap to make.
Chaps 140, 151, 164, 209, 247— Sam, perhaps surprisingly if you are Dean, has no fuckin clue whats happening rip <3
idk if I’ve mentioned this before but everytime I write on of these I have to think abt how tf u spell marriage as I always fuck up and write marraige instead and I hate it fjsjsksksk
explain why you taste so sweet when we kiss in the mornings. I always wondered where the flavour came from.”
He didn’t know what it was about the rhythmic movements that soothed him. The gentle strokes he had to apply, the tremble in his hands minimised as much as possible, and the shimmer of colour that followed in the brushes wake played a part, but some of it was also just the idea of being with Cas. Doing something for him. Taking the time to show his care through a quiet moment, free of any outside expectations.
I wouldn’t. I’ve already looked at a couple of ways that I think I can adjust it, and I’ve asked around for some advice as well. It’s just… Not something many people have ever tried before, if anyone has.”
I think i mentioned in one of my June updates to this that there was one element I've wanted to incorporate from the start, but i wasn't sure how. That finally has a functional idea behind it (although that's less new as i kinda thought it would end up as part of the thing it's ending up as, but now I know for sure!!). I know how they're making Cas human. I know how the portal spell to the empty works. I know how Dean's gonna survive the empty. and most importantly, i know how to incorporate an element that i decided i desperately wanted to include literally two days ago AND I'm going to do it in the most traumatising way possible just because i can <3
And goddamn, Dean didn’t know it was possible for Cas to look so contrite and resigned simultaneously.
Chap 175— worldbuilding vibes through introspection ig? idk I just like thinking through how people would cheat soulmate systems lol
“Nothing bad, I promise, I just… Feel like shit about the fact that I’ve been struggling with certain aspects of— well. Physical intimacy, I guess.”
i've been meaning to add to this one for a while but I couldn't get the vibes right. the vibes still weren't perfect today but I managed to add to it anyway!
dean is trans but the 90s (esp in the type of environment he grew up in) aren't great for that. cw for homophobia & transphobia including slight slur usage ('dyke' is used in a derogatory way by john)
In reality, the only thing it had done was open up a slightly more viable solution to the two of them.
“I may be reckless, but even I know that giving your real name to a member of the fae is not a course of action to be taken lightly, if ever.”
“Yeah, but some of this shit’s actually helpful, and it’s probably good to have on hand. And it’s not like it’s
to move on, of course. Five years was a long time to stay hung up on someone you barely could manage to admit you loved in the first place. But even if Sam and he had realised fairly early on there was probably no way they could rescue Cas themselves, there was always this overhanging ‘what if’ that came with the knowledge that Jack was working diligently on the issue while managing things in Heaven.
She looked to be about their age, and she kept looking at Cas as though she couldn’t quite believe what she was seeing. Dean waved at her somewhat awkwardly the next time she glanced over, and she flushed before obviously making up her mind about something and walking closer to them.
this isn't based on spn lore so like, ignore it if there's been stuff that empirically goes against it in the show lol
“Cas, are you okay? You’ve been coughing a lot recently, me and Dean have been getting concerned. Do we need to take you to see a doctor?”
“You’re not wrong, it’s a sweet shirt— I’ll make a classic rock fan outta you yet. Does our new friend have a name?”
melb lockdown should end purely bc i wanna get a side shave, who cares abt the case numbers/vaccination rate 😌 /j
She’d seemed pleasantly surprised to run into them in a diner one morning, and Dean himself was glad she was doing well. She’d asked after Sam, obviously slightly worried by his absence, but that worry abated when they said they were travelling on their own for a while. Then the conversation turned to their travels and, well, she
“Race you to the gardens?” He suggested, curious to see if Cas would go for it, and he grinned when the other Prince glanced tentatively around the empty hallway before looking back at him and nodding.
its a struggle bc like, i feel like i should b leaning back on my established aus when i don't have writing braincells but at the same time i don't wanna give bad quality updates to any of them so i am reluctant to do so at the same time. its hm.
“No, that’s what this is about, isn’t it? The fact that I’ve been more concerned with saving Cas than going out and getting wasted or whatever the fuck else I usually spend my free time doing?”
. Cas was off doing god-knows-what (possibly quite literally) halfway across the country. And even if he
Cas sighed and let himself be tugged across to where their ransacked suitcases lay on the floor. (There
Unfortunately for Dean, that hard-won courage had vanished into thin air by the time the next class happened.
Fuck, he’d had the perfect opportunity to, when he and Cas were first reunited. Sam would’ve given him the space he needed if he’d asked beforehand.
Chaps 156, 157, 162, 174, 190, 191, 204, 231, 254, 255— magnus and alec get the full spn plot rundown
A few minutes later, Gabriel flashed him a grin and a wink, pulling the other group members away from him and Castiel as effortlessly as he’d brought Dean over here in the first place. Another moment passed in silence as Dean and Castiel then stared at each other, both trying to process the fact that they now had their second chance to speak in a way that was close to frank with each other, no family members acting as chaperones.
“Honestly, I figured you’d use me being gone as an excuse to make yourself into a blanket burrito,” Dean replied, picking up the thread of conversation that he’d dropped in favour of indulging in the rush of feelings that had washed over him. “God knows you steal the blankets enough most nights that you’d manage it if you weren’t clinging to me as much as possible as well, and I’m sure he’s just as offended by it as I am.”
it is also me channeling some of my anger at things i found out (and promptly ignored) while researching random shit for the fix it, like the fact that jarpad said the finale was set 5 years later??????? i read the transcript for this but didn't wanna have to watch the actual ep lol so ignore any inaccuracies (some of them are obvs on purpose lol don't ignore those)
stopped to take that time while Cas was still stuck there. Because stopping would’ve meant considering the possibility that they wouldn’t find a way to get Cas out, that his deathbed confession was
one of my good online friends is at a (covid safe! they're masked and + everyone at the con is fully vaxxed and shit lol) con this weekend that Misha's at and GOD I'm living vicariously through them (esp since with the way things are going, I wouldn't b shocked if melb comic con Yet Again gets cancelled dfhskxjkhfm I'm possibly gonna have to come up with a whole new cos given I'm significantly less excited about the one that I planned for last year than I was originally bc I'm not as invested in the fandom anymore lol)
He felt at peace, out on the road. For the hour or so he was out there, no worries would bother him. It didn’t matter what else was happening in the world, where the latest apocalypse was at in its progression, how fucked up their latest hunt had gotten them. All that mattered was the thrum of Baby’s engine and the glide of her wheels on the open road.
It wasn’t until they were well out of hearing from Azazel’s office that Dean found himself turning to Castiel.
“Also, just before I left them outside the shelter door, one of them looked up at me and meowed. It was… disarmingly adorable.”
The thing is, it kept happening. Dean would run into Cas in seemingly innocuous places around the bunker, and the angel would have tears streaming down his face.
to be inconvenienced by you sometimes, Cas! I wanna be able to do as much shit for you as you’ve done for me over the years. All the shit I wanted to be doing for you pretty much the entire time. And we have to pick a consistent age and birthday for you anyway, so we might as well celebrate it.”
something happening in his life that had kickstarted their connection, Dean had a suspicion he knew what it was, even if it didn’t signal good things about his soulmate. No one came back from Hell completely unchanged.)
It made sense, given the impermanence of their lives growing up. Motel rooms rarely had a proper cooking space, and heading to local diners was easier than anything else. But cooking felt so natural, now, that he felt like he’d been doing it his entire life.
“No, Sam’s still out in Cali. He’s considering following me here in a couple of years, but apparently we’re at an age where we should be able to live on opposite coasts if needed.”
i tried to write more than this for today's but couldn't get the waitresses dialogue to flow right, rip
i think its because uni stress partially? but who knows, sometimes the writing braincell goes on random jaunts for no reason lol. yes this one is kinda incomplete, today was a 'just hit the wordcount;' kinda day lol
this is slightly different than my usual a/ns lol, but my best friend is trying to get started up on twitch and i'd appreciate any support yall can give her!!! she's going to do her first stream tomorrow at 3pm AEST
it's probably gonna become obvious fairly quickly, so I'll mention it now— over the next week or so I'm planning on going back through and adding to some of the aus i haven't touched in a lil while, given this month has been fairly centred on only 2 or 3 'verses. if there are any aus that u Particularly have been missing, lmk! i can't guarantee I'll get to them faster BUT I'll try 💜
“You didn’t seem like the type to settle down, but I thought that might’ve changed over the past couple of years.”
He starts coughing up blood, small amounts that should probably worry him more than they do, but he can’t bring himself to share the development. It would just bring everyone undue stress on top of the current hunt, and was just a result of the strain the coughing had had on his throat over the past month.
my brain is. very fried today. i spent a significant portion of the day doing/troubleshooting an entire assignment that was like. definitely designed to be done step by step as we learnt the relative skills lol. having chronic fatigue and being a chronic procrastinator really do not mesh well as even tho i cut shortcuts and shit and work fairly quickly i literally wanna collapse into bed now (I'm writing this a/n at 7:30 pm while i wait for my dinner to be finished in the oven, this probs wont get written and posted for another 2 hours due to my nighttime routine atm)
“Dean, I do not wish to make you feel uncomfortable. If you aren’t yet at a stage where you feel you can indulge in public displays of affection with me, that’s perfectly fine. Although I enjoy being physically close to you, I wish for this relationship to move at whatever speed you need it to.”
After a few minutes of this, he finds that he’s completely relaxed, the peaceful atmosphere surrounding them working to release the final knots of tension in his gut. Cas seemed relaxed as well, and Dean
“I knew it! The guy at the shop this morning, right? You both could barely look away from each other.”
I luckily don't get migraines, but I seem to get sinus and tension headaches fairly regularly. idk if it's connected to my cfs or my status of being regularly dehydrated or something else, but it's Not Fun and I try to avoid taking pain meds too often (we don't really have them in the house much anyway) so I kinda just live with it
an ember???? idk but they feel more like an ember than current me. so im thinking abt going by it for a lil while and seeing how it fits???????
“I have a friend with me that I can introduce him to if you really want, she’s much more into all this history stuff than I am. She’s moved on to the next room already. I’m Katie, by the way.”
Dean knew that Sam thought it was adorable, how much he indulged Castiel. He could see it in the soft smiles his brother sent at the two of them. The amused look in his eyes when Dean used to protest that people were reading into things too much. The eyebrow he raised when Dean did things like giving Cas the last of his pie before the angel had even asked for it.
I'm. Hm. I have to read a memoir for my gender and sexuality studies class before Monday as we looking at it and I
This one feels a little unfinished, sorry!! Writing from my phone again as although I’ve found my laptop now, idk where my charger is fjfjdjdk
Dean and Cas, who had both been following the back and forth with varying levels of confusion, took this moment to glance at each once more. They held each other’s gaze for a moment, then Dean found himself looking back at the couple in front of him and raising a tentative hand in the air.
“And risk damaging either of our stunning looks as a result? Nope, not worth it, guess we’ll have to go back to school now.”
Have an Actual drabble today (albeit a questionable quality one), I couldn’t get the dialogue flowing right bUT a story mum told me abt a family friend who moved cross country then ran into a close friend she’d lost touch with wouldn’t leave my brain so I tried to write it. I may come back to this/rework it at some point in he future or I may not, depends on if the idea bug for it lasts
im very seriously considering attempting to watch the gay cannibal show and idk what it says abt me that out of all the fandoms I've happily been in without ever interacting w the source material, fuckin hannibal is the one where I'm like no i do wanna watch it actually fjzddsac
to be okay with PDA! I wanna be able to do shit like holding your hand in public without feeling like I’m gonna have a friggin’ heart attack as a result. But I don’t know how to get my dumbass brain to accept that fact.”
See, there was a whole group of people who would look at two attractive men out and about in the world, mentally decide ‘Yeah, I’d tap that,’ then decide to ignore any signs that they might not, in fact, be able to tap that. Some of the people Dean had noticed looking at him or Cas with intent would back off after seeing them interact, recognising the lingering touches and fond eye-contact for what it very clearly was. But that wasn’t
made on his deathbed, and that wasn’t something Dean could do. So he’d kept going, researching desperately with Sam for
Cas looked like he was going to protest again, so Dean took a step away without letting go of his partner’s hand.
Slightly different vibes on this one, I wanted to set up a lil more world building for how soulmates work in this au (even if this doesn’t go into
“You sure about that? As much as I love your gravelly voice, it seems to have gone a bit past that sweet spot.”

Benny glanced back out into the storefront, this time getting a good look at their newest customer, who was looking mildly concerned about the mug.
“Did you expect anything less? If I’m out here calling upon fae, you better believe I’m gonna know my mythology. Even if it’s always been my brother’s strong point more than my own.”
“Well, I started it the night before last night, and the podcast player I was using allowed you to listen at 2 times speed.”
i feel kinda bad that i've just been alternating between these sorta verses for the past week or so but I just go with my muse and this is whats been speaking to me
He smiled at her in thanks, and she nodded once more at him before dismissing him with a flick of her fingers and walking away.
I really should write more for my soulmate dreams au, but the next scene I want to write is Dramatic and Angsty and I haven't been in the right vibe for that as of late. so continuing this one scene from the marks au it is xf,djz.afZk
Little does Dean know that just across campus, Castiel Novak is frowning worriedly at his computer, head cocked to one side in his confusion, staring at the nearly identical email he had just received.
anyone, though. Not yet. It’s too early, things are too unclear— relating to a few trans YouTubers does not a trans person make.
the case, whether it was because they didn’t ‘look gay enough’ or because some determined woman was sure they could be ‘turned straight’ if she just flirted enough (which honestly, Dean found offensive on two counts— both at the idea that bisexuality didn’t exist and the idea that he would
“I did tell you to keep your distance from me. You’re the one who insisted I shouldn’t be left to ride out my first significant illness alone.”
Cas was sat awkwardly on the bed, his normally hidden wings splayed out behind him, with a pile of dark feathers scattered across the ground. He had his back to the door, and despite being contorted in such a way that the top half of his body was almost facing Dean, it was clear that he had no idea that the hunter had arrived. Instead, all his attention was focused very intently on his wings.
“Dean, I love you. Deeply and eternally. I betrayed Heaven’s mission for you, gave up and regained my grace because of you, then learned the wonders of humanity beyond the little I had already been afforded by watching from Heaven through our interactions. You taught me what it
idk if they ever addressed it in canon outside of lazarus rising but it makes me so mad that Dean can’t see Cas’ true form
“Yeah, you’ve never been good at hiding when you’re attracted to someone. Not that I’m complaining, it’s easy ammunition for me!”
i finished and submitted the first of the assignments that i have due over the next lil while after a two hour seminar today which was good but also left me with remarkably few braincells for writing. so this is probably bad.
The idea of Cas looking any different to how he did when they met cut Dean to his core, but he nodded anyway. Cas wasn’t wrong for desiring a body of his own, and Jimmy had a family he needed to get back to.
“I’m really feelin’ the love here, Cas,” he said, and he snorted again when Cas’ only response was a wry shrug. “Anyway, you still haven’t told me
look sometimes i want to write abt how much these two idiots love each other with no plot getting in the way
Sure enough, Dean had put the knife he was holding down when he felt Cas tugging away, and had instinctively turned to try and coax the ex-angel back into his arms.
the writing braincell's taken a steep dive off a cliff lol so y'all get this. genuinely did not know if I was gonna come back to this au or not but all my other aus weren't vibing for whatever reason soooo
I recognised Baby in the parking bay yesterday, but I assumed it was just a coincidence. I figured you’d still be living out in California near Sam. Or has he moved out this way as well? I… lost touch with him after high school, but you probably already knew that.”
It took Dean a second to respond, as he was too busy peering up curiously at the space where Cas had been standing. It wasn’t certain, especially in the darkness that surrounded them, but Dean could
’ on the off chance he was right). He got why Dean wanted to rescue him, of course, but this single-minded determination was more intense than it had been in the past.
I got a steam burn today and it hurts like a bitch can u tell. this isn’t my best work I write it on my phone while desperately ignoring the pain in my left hand lol
got my second last assignment for gss submitted today, now I just need to focus on my essay— honestly, I feel like the struggles I had with writing this portfolio probably say more than anything else abt the state of my mental health rn, esp given this one was focused on the queer studies side of things (whereas the first one was focused on feminism which while i obvs believe is equally as important, is less my area of interest in terms of studying).
I’ve decided to try to stick w Destiel for these for at least while I’m in reddie hell for a couple of reasons- one I think it’ll be an interesting way to challenge myself (both in the ‘writing for a fandom that’s not consuming my life’ way and the ‘how long can I keep it up’ way), two I think it’ll be a good way to encourage me to work on my wips for these boys as it’ll be harder for me to come up w random scenarios for them, and three I’m much better at writing longer form reddie content and have less random soft moments in my mind for them (that aren’t connected specifically to a fic at least)
“Can I sleep out here while you continue to research?” He asked, avoiding the question, and Dean dropped a kiss on the top of his head in silent acknowledgement of what he wasn’t saying.
“I’m Katheryn,” she replied, her smile growing as she saw both of them somewhat struggle to look away from each other as she talked. “You guys are really cute together, you know that?”
He didn’t want to return to hunting, no matter what that voice in the back of his head said about it being his only worthwhile skill. He’d just gotten Cas back, and he wasn’t about to risk getting offed by some rando vampires in the middle of nowhere now that Cas was human again. There were younger, fitter hunters that could take the helm now.
reminder that the full version of yesterdays 'drabble' is officially posted! check the end notes of the chap or the fourth fic in this series to find it :)
Dean hadn’t dared ask for a moment alone with Castiel. They had the rest of their lives to get to know each other, after all. The wedding and reception were for their kingdoms, for their families, and the honeymoon was for getting to know each other well enough to work out if they would genuinely get along.
“Gabriel would argue that it’s his job as my older sibling, so maybe there’s some merit to that fact,” Cas said, smiling back, and Dean managed to slip a lid on his drink without dropping it, which was honestly a rousing success on his end.
anyway the fact that it seems like literally everyone but jarpad knew is fucking hysterical it made my day to see him have his mini hissy fit on twitter lmaooooooooo (like i feel slightly mean but also. its jared so i don't really.)
i was gonna wait till i'd seen more to write this idea as it involves jimmy and i wanted to see if he got like. an actual personality. but idk when that's gonna happen + it's not like I write from cas' perspective 90% of the time anyway even if the fic idea would suit it better in some ways.
“Well, if we don’t have any evidence of what he’s doing so far, we’ll just have to go get some, won’t we?”
But still, a part of him was terrified that Cas would shut the conversation down, say that he didn’t want kids after all, and that part of him kept putting the conversation off for another week.
The last night they spend on the beach is… peaceful, in a melancholy way. Without really planning it, they end up sitting on the sand together, legs tangled in a mimicry of the first ‘proper’ day of their honeymoon.
Miracle, predictably, bounded down the hallway to greet him excitedly, but there was no response from Cas. Which wasn’t
At least this way, he’d find some peace at night. He still wasn’t going to talk to Dean about his feelings, however, even if Dean was the person he loved more than anyone (and any
Dean froze, arm half outstretched in preparation to sling around Cas’ shoulders, and blinked at Cas for a second.
“You know, I did this with Claire once,” Dean said as they walked down the street in the direction of the mini-golf place. “Back when we were dealing with the Mark of Cain still.”
“Yeah, but all the ways that we could prove we haven’t interacted are easily faked. Emails can be deleted, as well as texts and phone calls, we might’ve never met on campus so that professors weren’t aware we knew each other, our friends could be lying to cover for us. And that’s not even accounting for burner phones and emails. It seems ridiculous, but some people go… very overboard to get out of doing set work.”
The roughness in Cas’ voice didn’t seem to reassure Sam, and he studied the ex-angel seriously for a moment before sighing.
eye-line for another moment, matching smiles spread across their faces, before leaning in to seal his future with a kiss.
Castiel met his eyes when he stopped walking, and cocked his head curiously before holding out a hand.
get fully used to the concept, not even decades from now, when they’ll have been together for even longer than they weren’t. He can’t imagine a world in which he’s not acutely aware of how damn lucky he is to hold the key to Castiel’s heart, a world in which he doesn’t treasure every smile Cas bestows on him.
Dean froze, completely startled by the low, gravelly voice. He’d known when he became a resurrectionist that a situation such as this one was probably inevitable, but he hadn’t expected it to happen
“You looking for your usual?” He asked, already scribbling on a cup, and Cas nodded with a tight smile.
“It’s okay if you are struggling to reconcile what you feel about your father now that you are more confident within yourself with the years you spent looking up to him and modelling your behaviour into someone you thought he could be proud of.”
“I— uh— dinner. We still need to— dinner,” he managed to get out, voice slightly strangled, and Cas smirked in a way that made Dean regret ever accidentally teaching him the tricks to seduction (because seriously, how was he supposed to think when Cas was sitting there looking like
“Oh, did I forget to mention I obscured where your soul was in Heaven so Cas wouldn’t catch on?” Jack asked, but before anyone else could make a move to talk, Cas was gone.
had to get a new phone number today bc my old service were being dicks abt porting my number across and we gave up on it, which is very annoying bc a) I've had my old number for almost 7 years now and b) my old number was stoopid easy to memorise (had a fucktonne of doubles in it, like the pattern was 1233 211 443 but with different numbers lol) and my new one Is Not
wow i'm finally working on my wing grooming fic again. chap 7 + the connected fic, for those who need to reread he for reference which i assume is All Of U
todays exciting task was consolidating all my tabs down on my computer because I just had. way too many. i went from 276 to 54, which is less tabs than the biggest window I had previously (which had abt 68 tabs in it). it feels kinda weird tbh but I know I'll have even less soon as I've put all the youtube vids in my 'main' window of the three I have so that I'll actually watch them. i'd say i'd tackles my 500 tabs on my phone next but that ain't happening any time soon.
of a soulmate, was he? He’d made so many mistakes throughout the years — put so many people in danger, gotten so many innocents killed — and the idea that anyone outside of his blood family could
Sometimes, he spies Cas looking at him with an unreadable look in his eyes and wonders if he feels the same, imagines what it would be like to make some sort of grand confession and have his feelings returned.
And it was momentous, of course, there was no denying that fact, but it was also just. A kiss. A little dry, Cas’ chapped and bitten lips signalling to Dean that he should add that beeswax chapstick to the grocery list again, and nervous in a way that he hadn’t experienced in
They’d sit on a couch together, coffee table pulled near enough to be useful without trapping them in place, and Dean would paint Cas’ nails.
The shop wasn’t busy, with only one customer ahead of Cas in line, and Dean flashed a grin his way as he stepped up to the counter.
Chaps 20, 62, 64, 67, 72, 79, 102, 118, 136, 159— Cas acknowledges the other elephant but also is an angsty bitch about it and chooses to not communicate with dean
could be expected to parent effectively after a demon pinned their wife on a ceiling to murder her in a fiery blaze.
what his specific elephant looked like. He’d known long before he had thrown his sheet over, had even been
He was still for another couple of moments, before gently trying to extract himself from Cas’ arms. He needed to try
Sam doubted Dean was trying to deny Cas’ feelings, but didn’t really know what else Dean could be objecting to.
I was reading through early chaps of this fic including the ans (which i often skim past lol) and I’m laughing bc in one of them I mention panicking as it hit 8:30 and I hadn’t written yet and I just— GHJAKSKSKJFKSSL
think of one of us using it to get Cas out before I suggested removing his grace to get him out of the deal’, but he figured he’d leave it be. They were one step closer to rescuing Cas, now, and that was all that really mattered.
Usually I write these on the spot pretty much/maybe plan to do something for a certain day just a few days before but I’ve known I was gonna stick to this idea from the beginning pretty much. Idk if there’s a general fandom accepted bday date for Cas but if there is I don’t know it soooo 🤷🤷🤷 he doesn’t get one in canon so I’m allowed to give him mine 😄. link to full version at the bottom and in the series will come when it's fully finished and posted as always!!! it hopefully will be done tonight but its uh. v late lol
Sam exhaled slowly, and Cas found himself shrinking in place. He knew he should probably be more aware of this stuff, given the lives that they led, but he hadn’t thought anything sinister was going on until a flower petal had forced itself out of his throat. Maybe if he’d had more experience as a human, he would’ve realised something was amiss earlier, but he doubted it. Curses like this, they were designed to be non-obvious until it was too late. What would be the point if it could be fixed immediately?
“I guess it just… makes me happy, in some ways. Having my nails painted serves as an indulgence, a reminded that I am allowed to express myself now, in ways I couldn’t before— both during my time as a loyal angel and during the time we spent hunting. They remind me that I am allowed to just
Dean froze, staring at Azazel in shock. At his side, Cas seemed similarly surprised, and Azazel’s smug look intensified.
“I’d say we can leave it here, given we’ve made it clear we have a… mutual understanding, but I fear for my life if I leave this room without us coming to some sort of proper resolution. Sam seemed very determined.”
We dk how convenient that time is for y'all non-australians (timezones are so annoying lol) but if any of you are awake/around we both appreciate you stopping by!!!!! I'll be hanging in chat as a mod etc and I'm very pumped for her bc she's wanted to stream for a while,
It wasn’t fair to his dates to be stringing them along the way he had been, not when it was apparently blindingly obvious that he was in love with his best friend. He figured he should just… take some time to himself, maybe see if some distance from romance as a whole was what he needed to get over Cas. They still hung out pretty regularly, of course, but the weekly first dates at Angel Radio were gone, and he’d spent several evenings at Benny’s when Cas wasn’t around.
