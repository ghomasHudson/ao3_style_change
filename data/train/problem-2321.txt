. George and Basil were playing cards in the common room, in the company of Miss Jessop. This is a big house. She could have come back at any time. And nobody saw her. It never occurred to anyone to check whether she’d come home at all.”
“Qui diable êtes-vous?!” his opponent hissed, advancing with his pistol pointed directly at Sherlock’s head.
John, who had just taken another mouthful of coffee, choked slightly. He grinned and flicked some water at Sherlock, who looked most put out.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.” He heard the grim smile in Sherlock’s voice. “I’ll save it all up for tomorrow.”
Sherlock’s odd manner when John had talked to Murdy and the Antonelli girls. When he’d been concerned for them. Even for Patrick. Had Sherlock been looking for clues, all this time? Evidence to prove his theory? Had he honestly been believing that what he and John had wasn’t going to last?
“Well you know the answer to that problem, don’t you?” John asked, feeling his heart-rate pick up ridiculously. “You could always try fetching your own bloody coffee once in a while, hm?”
“I can tell that you’re not a native of Hilderbogie, certainly.” Sherlock conceded. “Although you have been here long enough for your accent to be almost indistinguishable from the locals. Your broad vowels, though… they tend to indicate that your origins are rather further away. Canada. Newfoundland, to be precise. You left there many years ago for a life at sea. Admittedly, I was told about your history in the merchant navy by a member of the Antonelli family. However, the unmistakable scars on your hands indicate an initial foray into trawler and line fishery before that.”
John! And then you just open your mouth and you say those things and it’s honest and true and it’s beautiful and I hate that I can’t tell you what I need you to know!”
.” Miss Argyle said coldly, glancing at the nearby clock on the wall. “I should have been given those five minutes ago.”
[Been through worse. Unlikely to break. Severe sprain at worst. Better than alternative. Bugger fuck damn damn DAMN that hurts!]
Sherlock raised a shoulder in a petulant shrug, and glared into the depths of the pond. “I think that we can be reasonably confident. It would be the easiest place for him to arrange surveillance-“
“It was my grandmother’s house. When she came into the room, she seemed none too pleased to see Philip; she barely acknowledged his existence. She was a hard looking woman, very tall with masses of grey hair in a bun. She was dressed all in black, very elegant. She couldn’t stop staring at me, and when she first spoke to me it was in Norwegian. I hadn’t a clue what she was saying, and I suppose it was obvious. She switched to English, then. A beautiful accent, just perfect. She didn’t bother saying hello, or welcoming me. She simply said that I would be living there for the time being, and that my room was on the second floor. And then she walked out of the room, like she was in some kind of hurry. I hadn’t said a word to her; I just stood there gaping. She scared me almost as much as Philip; with her black clothes and air of authority she reminded me of the nuns. That was the first time I met a member of my extended family. I learnt later that her name was Hedda.
John nodded, wrapping his arms tightly around himself. He couldn’t deny the truth of Sherlock’s words, despite the pain they caused him. The memories they stirred up. “I did. I wanted her, when I believed she was real. When I believed she was mine. And Christ, I worry about her; wherever she is. Sherlock, I worry about her so much. I don’t know where she is now, who she’s with… nobody deserves to start their life like that.”
“Aye!” roared the crowd, some of them waving what looked like long knives and bats in the air. They seemed intoxicated by the woman’s stirring words and she looked around at them approvingly, her hands on her hips.
He opened his mouth to exclaim at the vista, the harsh unexpected beauty of the landscape and the mellow grandeur of the house (manor? castle? Is it a castle if it’s got turrets? If it is, I’m going to tease Sherlock for
She stood huddled on the doorstep, uncertainty radiating from her posture. Mary was wrapped in a thick grey wool coat, an old blue hat pulled down over her short blonde hair.
Kneeling up, he cautiously shuffled closer to Sherlock. Very, very slowly (Jesus, he’s not a boa constrictor. The worst he can do is shout at you or push you away.) John moved forwards between Sherlock’s knees and reached up, placed both hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and squeezed them gently. Sherlock didn’t move or respond; but at least he didn’t shy away or shake John off. Emboldened by this, John awkwardly slipped his arms further around Sherlock’s shoulders and stroked the back of his neck gently. It was a bit uncomfortable, as Sherlock’s clasped hands were trapped between their stomachs and the man was as stiff as a board. But after a moment or so, Sherlock dropped his face to rest on John’s shoulder and inhaled deeply.
“Details about what?” John asked curiously, trailing after them towards the open door of the library. It, too, was flooded with sunlight now that Margaret seemed to have decided the mourning blackout had ended. “And incidentally, Sherlock, you do
Sherlock heard a minute squeal of metal against metal that indicated that one of the support poles was beginning to shift under the force of his attack.
The last stretch of snow seemed endless, and John realised with a creeping sense of unease that he might not have the energy to make it back to the rendezvous point. It seemed incredible that this whole serious of ghastly events had only begun early the previous morning; that he had woken up in a warm bed with Sherlock sleeping unconcernedly at his side. Before Mary had appeared out of nowhere, shattering everything around them. The harsh words they’d exchanged. Patrick bleeding under his hands, gasping for breath. The sheer, wrenching panic when he’d realised that Sherlock had been taken. The knife in his hands, pressed to Mary’s throat. Charred bodies in the snow. This endless, freezing, exhausting march through the wilderness.
“You’re not having one, Sherlock. You’ve been off them for ages and you’ll just be cross if you start again.” he said firmly.
A couple of cups lay on the table, one of them toppled over in its saucer. A pair of oven gloves lay on the floor, knocked from where they had hung on their usual peg. He stooped and picked them up, draping them over the back of one of the chairs. He reached out and righted the cup.
“Don’t worry, I asked Ms. Gothford to stay out of our room for the rest of our stay,” came Sherlock’s voice, accompanied by the slam of the heavy carved bedroom door.
Sherlock continued to stare at the painting, mesmerised by the broad streaks of red paint. John wandered around the room, and then knelt and idly flicked through the pile of shoddy canvases against the wall. Certainly Marmaduke’s lurid still life was dire, as were some of Basil’s wobbly looking sketches of Sandra sitting on a wooden box. As he turned away from the stack of canvases, something long and white caught his eye under the bed where Violet still sat, smoking furiously.
The house itself had a faintly chilly, dour air. The corridors were sparsely decorated, with bare stone floors and high vaulted ceilings. Violet’s heels clicked loudly as she made her way to a room at the end of the second floor hallway, and she tucked the bottle of tonic water under her arm before opening a set of heavily carved dark wooden doors. She flashed a smile at Sherlock.
“Mere fuel.” he declared haughtily, but a brief scuffle ensued between he and Violet when she attempted to withhold his plate.
“What?” John asked curiously. “It’s a lovely jumper, Violet; but you don’t have to make me another-“
Violet shook her head and shrugged. “Well, I barely know the woman. The last time I was in a church was when I married Sherry, and it’s not as if I’m welcome at the infernal parish committee meetings after the
, you. I couldn’t see your face, but it was-“ John broke off, and glared at the ceiling. (Oh, clever. Well done, Watson. Just because all the blood has left your brain, it does not excuse that kind of slip up!)
The soft crump of the snow hitting the frozen ground seemed to jolt Sherlock out of whatever meditative trance he was in, and he met John’s gaze evenly. “You’re freezing. Come on, let’s go in.”
But the thing was, it was still a first time. He had expected it to be like the way that he imagined it; that it would be tender and slow and sensual and really fucking arousing. And it was. But it also hurt, which he wasn’t quite as prepared for as he had thought.
“Basil, as far as we are aware, Hilary doesn’t know about this. We’re not planning on telling her. Just take a few deeps breaths. Get yourself together, and continue.” John said kindly. Basil looked almost comically grateful at this; his eyes swam briefly with unshed tears.
Violet glanced at her watch, which lay discarded on the dressing table amidst a profusion of scent bottles and drifts of spilt powder. John suddenly realised that while she had taken the time to apply a variety of cosmetics, Violet had very carefully powdered
Miss Argyle.” Rab said, a little defensively. She drummed the heel of her boot into the leg of her chair crossly.
“Yes. Violet is not in fact a Holmes. She was briefly married to my uncle Sherrinford a long time ago, but he drank himself to death shortly after. Not her doing, incidentally.”
Sherlock sat up sharply, and promptly hit his head on the luggage rack overhead. He stared at it in outrage, his gaze swiftly moving to John who was giggling sleepily at him.
John suddenly became aware of the cold sweat pouring down his back, and the restraining hand that Sherlock placed on his wrist. A few feet away, the minister was standing motionlessly in the centre of the room. His face wasn’t visible, but the line of his shoulders looked tense.
Violet began to laugh in earnest too, and after a second or two Sherlock joined in. “What about your flower arranging then, John? You’ve certainly been keeping
As so often happened, the next morning John woke alone. It really didn’t bother him, or at least it didn’t bother him very much anymore. At first, some small part of him had vainly hoped that Sherlock would come around to long lie-ins, the slow intimacy of drifting in and out of sleep together, of shared warmth. But more often than not, if Sherlock was still in bed when John awoke, the detective was usually at least partially dressed and working busily on his laptop or phone. It was much more usual for John to wake alone, in cool sheets that bore little evidence of Sherlock’s presence during the night at all.
Since it was a truth universally acknowledged that Sherlock on aeroplanes was A Very Bad Thing, he and John found themselves on the 7am train from Kings Cross to Edinburgh the next morning.
The rasp-click of a cigarette lighter, followed by a deep inhalation of breath. Beautiful waft of smoke, billowing through the confined space. An ostentatious cough, from Bruno.
(This regrettable arrangement had begun when Mrs. Hudson had mistakenly opened a box intended for him that had held a large bottle of lubricant, some orange and bergamot scented massage oil and a few other little novelties that had piqued his interest during a slightly inebriated online shopping incident. The wink she had given him when apologising profusely and handing over the open parcel still curdled his blood when he recalled it.)
“Patrick, you need to focus. I know it hurts like hell but you’ve got to stay awake as long as you can. Don’t give in to it, understand?” he ordered him firmly, pressing on the wound a little harder with one hand as he delved in his back pocket for his phone.
“That’s not the pressing question.” Sherlock said firmly. “Come along, Miss Antonelli. We need to find some evidence.”
The crowd at her feet nodded a little more strenuously. One large woman standing on the outskirts shouted “Aye!” rather aggressively and threw her fist into the air.
“Doesn’t count. It’s an amalgam of different compounds.” Sherlock informed him loftily, after a moment.
John brushed off the snow on the doorstep to the bowling club hall and took a seat, content to watch Sherlock and Murdy. He chafed his gloved hands and repressed a smile as Sherlock leant over the patch of snow in question, studying it intently. Murdy stood back a little to allow him access, attempting nonchalance but clearly aching to impress. As John watched, her thin hands moved and she clasped them behind her back. He doubted she even noticed the way she was mirroring Sherlock’s posture.
Violet, overhearing this as she turned back to John and Sherlock, half-laughed and took a swig from her own glass. She cast a stormy look at Mycroft. “You never said a truer word. Fucking Mycroft Holmes: Half Iago; half Fu Manchu. All
“Or British personnel who were stationed at camps alongside American or other troops.” Sherlock countered. “As I said, it’s a minor possibility. It’s wise to cover all the bases,” he added a little defensively.
Mycroft sighed heavily, extinguishing his cigarette delicately in a nearby silver tray. “You do know that this puts a slightly different complexion on matters, don’t you?”
“Mmph! Oh, alright then.” Sherlock said, managing to sound both pleased and put-upon at once. He grabbed the envelope and ripped it open carelessly. He cleared his throat and began to read the densely covered sheet of paper aloud in a startling approximation of Violet’s wry lilt.
Murdy. She wore a knee-length coffee coloured lace dress that couldn’t possibly have belonged to Violet, but the biggest difference by far was her shaggy dark hair, most of which had vanished. He frowned as she made her way across the hall towards the fire, shrugging on her old green coat. The long dark locks had been shorn, and now lay in shining, elegantly arranged flicks that barely reached her ears. Her eyes suddenly seemed huge, no longer hidden by a heavy fringe. Murdy was blushing furiously as she buttoned up her coat.
“That dress is very obviously expensive, and made by a famous designer; you made the dress and coat you wore earlier yourself. Both of which suit you much better, incidentally; but that’s beside the point. The earrings again are ostentatious and are obviously uncomfortable but you’re prepared to put up with them for this evening. You’re aiming to impress, but not us. You’re not aiming to seduce anyone, as you forgot to put on more perfume when you dressed earlier; a classic sign. Similarly, you haven’t put on any more make-up, you just powdered your nose.”
“Sherlock, you’ve got to let me know if you’re ok.” John murmured, taking a break to relax his jaw. Sherlock seemed incapable of speech, and he fixed John with a glassy pale stare from over his shoulder. His face was flushed and drenched with sweat. “Squeeze my hand if you’re ok. If it’s too much I’ll take a break or stop-“
And he was still so quick to believe that it wasn’t true, or that I didn’t love him enough. That I would just up and leave him like that. When they took him, he believed that he couldn’t give me enough; that I would let him go so easily. What is he thinking right now? He’ll know it was a stupid ruse, Mary showing up like that. Oh god, this is all my fault! Why the fuck did I agree to give her those few minutes? I knew he was upset and scared and I still chose to walk away from him. I left him on his own when he was hurting and now he’s gone and-)
Sherlock sniffed, and dropped a clean plate onto the pile next to him with a loud clatter. “Back in Edinburgh. She said that you were
Sherlock looked steadily at him, taking a sip from the steaming mug that Murdy pushed wordlessly towards him. She was curled up on her own hard-backed chair and was watching the minister with great interest. He looked deeply uncomfortable, a couple of beads of sweat dotting his gleaming grey hairline. He looked around the three of them, his eyes coming to rest finally on Murdy, who stared back at him curiously.
on me-“ Violet’s voice was high and broke slightly, with either fury or fear John couldn’t tell. He began hammering at the door along with Sherlock, who was silent and white faced, his shoulders rigid. The ancient wood was heavy and thick, and barely budged under the onslaught.
John forced himself to keep his eyes trained on her, watching her every move. Her false, flirtatious expression had dropped instantly at Violet’s harsh words and with a poor grace she shrugged off her coat; letting it collapse in a heap on the stone floor. She toed off her winter boots, and straightened up to face them once more. She turned in an exaggeratedly slow circle, her hands on either side of her head. John could see more blood now, soaked into the shoulder of her wool sweater.
Upon their return, Sherlock took Violet into the kitchen to tell her the news about Garcia, closing the door firmly behind them. John thought briefly about going to find a cup of tea elsewhere, before abandoning the plan and heading upstairs. He could hear George Marmaduke laughing along with Basil Montague further along the corridor, and picked up his pace. He didn’t think that he could face talking with any of the students just yet. He felt tired, filthy and sick at heart. The smell of the caravan seemed to linger in his nostrils, and he couldn’t quite escape the image of Freddie Garcia’s ruined face.
“Charming fellow, your brother. I keep meaning to invite him round for beer and the footy at ours some Sunday.” he said mildly. Sherlock snorted and hunched over his knees, eyes shut and his fingers tightly knotted together. His knuckles were white.
The reel finished with a dizzy flourish. Patrick began to move towards the bar; his eyes seeking out first John and then Sherlock with a smile. He caught sight of Violet too, and frowned a little at her wide-eyed expression. She winced slightly, then jerked her head minutely towards the tall man on the edge of the dancefloor.
. It would give you nightmares. You wouldn’t be able to rid yourself of the mental images for years. I would have deleted it long ago except I know it will come in useful one of these days. I’m… saving it up.”
“Mmm, might catch up with you later. Patrick said he wanted to get back to his painting; and I’ve been painting him while he’s been working on his landscape. I do need one or two things from the village shop, and I wouldn’t mind saying hello to Hector.”
“Oh my god! I know what it is!” John breathed. “You couldn’t be the best so you decided that you’d never do it again!”
John chuckled at the look on Sherlock’s face, and reached out for the cup of tea Lestrade was offering him. “I hope you realise what you’ve got yourself into, Greg.” he murmured quietly.
He glanced at the map again, taking in the shape of the twisting river and calculating how far he had come. The outline of the highest mountains towered over him now as he had gotten closer, and he read their names with no interest on the paper. The outline of the river curved and weaved towards a high crag, a point in the rings of contour lines marked with a small W. A waterfall no doubt, although probably just as frozen as the river beside him in the sub zero temperatures. He stared at the map a moment longer, debating whether it was worth continuing so far. Surely Sherlock couldn’t possibly have made it that far.
“Came on a bit strong, did you?” she asked gently. He didn’t answer, and she sighed. She obviously found her confirmation in his face. “Look. As you know, it’s been a bloody long time since I have had any particular insight into the workings of his mind. In a way, I really only know him as a gangly mad-haired nineteen year old eejit, running about in a scruffy jumper and raving about Stravinsky. The muppet.” she smiled fondly at some distant memory. “But. Be that as it may, he told me some things back then. But I really don’t know if they’re relevant now...”
Sherlock sat up a little straighter, and took a quick sip of his coffee. “So. I think it’s safe to conclude that Freddie Garcia did not have anything to do with the knife being driven through the bench. Given that the class were working from still life in the studio on Thursday afternoon, he would have been dead by the time the knife was rigged.”
John’s eyes came to rest on Mycroft in the rear view mirror. His face was stony, but he inhaled deeply at Patrick’s name.
didn’t call her that!” she added sternly, turning to John and Sherlock as if she wanted to make this point very clear.
“Well yes, that is true.” John decided just to go with it. It was nice that somebody was keen on having him around, at least. Sherlock continued to regard him in a satisfied fashion. It seemed unlikely that John was going to argue with his unassailable logic. John stared back at him, taking in Sherlock’s expression and suddenly felt suspicious.
Sherlock shook his head, pressing her hand tightly between both of his. “It’s my fault. I should have realised.”
There was a brief shower of snow from one of the larger oaks, followed by a lanky figure dropping from a wide branch overhead and landing catlike below. Murdy Antonelli grinned at her younger sisters, tucking her ungloved hands deep into the pockets of her slightly shabby long green coat.
“Moooorning!” she murmured, and absently kissed his shoulder as she passed him on her way to fill the kettle. “Think we all had a bit of a lie-in today, eh?”
Sherlock glowered at the wreckage and forced himself to scout the ground again, clumsily picking up a cracked and blackened wing mirror before tucking it into the pocket of his jacket. Further investigation revealed a partially melted scrap of plastic that had warped into a shallow bowl shape, which he also pocketed. Little else among the burnt wreckage presented itself as a possibility for salvage.
, idiot.” Sherlock said, with a trace of a smile. “I am thankfully not as transparent as you, and there are several people in the house whom you could have been with. For god’s sake, John. Pull yourself together! What ludicrous pretext did the gluttonous arse give for his presence?”
John met Violet’s eyes again, and shrugged. Whatever was going on in there, whoever is was… he couldn’t imagine it was Mary. Not making those loud, appreciative chewing noises anyway.
Sherlock sat down at the table and was promptly ordered to start chopping some tomatoes and garlic, which he did with remarkable skill and only a minimum amount of complaint. John watched him curiously as the knife blurred on the chopping board, pulling up a chair and taking a sip of the heady wine. Sherlock’s face was furrowed in concentration; it seemed as if each piece was so meticulously sliced that one would need callipers to spot any variation in size. Similarly the garlic was finely and swiftly chopped that it soon resembled a paste on one corner of the scarred wooden board.
“Oh, please. The naked hurt in her eyes when she described the encounter in the garden. Her utterly transparent pleasure at the fact that she got to go to the cinema with Sandra, just the two of them. Also, the way she unconsciously rubbed her thumb and forefinger together when she spoke of her. Classic tell. Speaks of unfulfilled sexual desire.”
“What are we, now?” John mused aloud, once they were in a cab heading back to Baker street. It was a cool, damp afternoon and Sherlock was studying the passers-by with detached interest. He glanced over at John with a raised eyebrow, his fingers idly worrying at one of the buttons on his coat.
In his mind, John’s eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched ominously. [You’d know. You would. So shut it. I’m coming for you.]
To his great relief, John noticed that George was still breathing. Violet had struck him squarely on the crown of his head and while John was sure (and very pleased) that the blow must have hurt like hell he doubted that George would be seriously affected by it. He lay propped against the doors of the Aga, dribbling gently down his front. He looked awful, with the combination of the residual bruising across his nose and eye, and the split skin on his cheek where John had punched him. Within minutes he would start developing an impressive swelling on the top of his head.
Violet’s room was rather disconcerting; stepping into it made John feel as though he had somehow wandered inside a fabergé egg or an overfilled jewellery box. The walls were painted a deep cerulean blue, but were almost obscured by a vast number of paintings, shelves containing huge quantities of books, brightly coloured gilded icons, and any number of odd and beautiful glittering things. A large glass bell-jar was filled with several tiny stuffed hummingbirds perched on the branches of a jewelled golden tree. The bed was ancient carved wood, hung with heavily embroidered and mirrored Indian silk. It was a large, long room with several tall windows that overlooked the topiary in the front garden, and Violet was curled up on one of the window seats. She was still wearing her messy painting clothes and a large panel of needlework was lying discarded in her lap.
Patrick Singh was sitting opposite Sherlock, and was looking at him warily. Singh was a striking man, with light golden brown skin and blue eyes so dark they appeared almost black. His hair was long and dark, spilling over his powerfully built shoulders in thick waves. He wore a crumpled white linen shirt with an air of careless elegance, several buttons undone and the sleeves rolled up to below his elbows.
“No, stop it. I need to know. Are you alright?” John asked insistently. He could hear a sharp, rhythmic tapping noise coming from the distance and he lowered his voice. “I know this place will probably bring back some bad memories. We don’t have to stay-“
“You see? You still want her.” Sherlock said flatly. “And I’ve known that all along. It doesn’t matter that she’s not your biological child. You prepared a space for her in your life, John. She never arrived and you’re still mourning her. And I know that one day you’re going to try and fill that gap again. And then… that’s when you’ll leave me.” Sherlock’s eyes were calm, and full of a kind of quiet desperation. John was shaking his head already, ready to argue. But Sherlock held up his hand; willing him to listen. “It’s all right, John. I realised this a long time ago. It’s never changed how I feel about you.”
“Not necessarily suspicious, though, is it? He might be gambling, or visiting dodgy saunas or have a married lover or something potentially embarrassing like that.”
“We sat there in the dark for a few minutes. He lit a cigarette. My hands were sweating so much I had soaked handprints into the pillowcase I was still holding on my knees.
(Oh, god. What if it was my cock? What would that be like, this tight wet heat around my cock? Or him feeling this, pushing inside me?)
John wasn’t entirely sure what he was staring at, standing stock-still at the edge of the frozen river. The wind was picking up and plucked at the snow-laden pines, making them dance and dislodge showers of ice. At first he thought that the strange glimmer was the murky glow of the moon on the branches, or intermittent starlight. But while the snow reflected shadowy grey, this light was a feeble green. It flickered and disappeared as the pines swayed, seeming to wink in and out of existence. If it were summer he could have believed it was a firefly in the distance.
“Why not? I was bored.” Sherlock shrugged, as if such a question was utterly incomprehensible.  “Violet found me some alchemical texts shortly afterwards, and I began to replicate some of the experiments.”
They were on a narrow gravel path leading up to the front of a large, sprawling Georgian house. On either side, however they were surrounded by an enormous, towering collection of dark shapes. After a second glance, John realised that they were not sculptures, but topiary. Some of the shapes were over twenty feet tall; huge looming obelisks and improbable geometric shapes. The smaller figures were more varied: running figures, gigantic outstretched hands, strange twisted beasts.
There seemed little to say in response to this, and John carefully avoided Patrick’s gaze. George allowed himself to be half-pushed and half-carried into his bedroom.
“She- I learnt things while I was here. They were important. Things about-“ he swallowed hard. “Christ, John. I wish you were with me.”
, one might say. Cunning. Sadly let down by her temper, but then nobody is perfect. The way she killed Freddie Garcia-“
Sherlock half-sobbed with relief and arousal, his hips trembling at the combined pressure of John’s deeply buried fingers and his hot, wet mouth. John could feel the climax approaching swiftly from the way Sherlock could no longer control the wild trembling of his body and the strong clenches of his arse around his fingers.
The room was dark and full of secret shadows, lit only by flickering flames and the last gasp of dusk through the open curtains. Sherlock was stretched out beneath him, his chest gently heaving and splashed with the flush of exertion and arousal. John couldn’t help staring at him, the beautiful lines of him and the gorgeous strain in his angular face. Sherlock’s hair was splayed every which way over the white linen, sticking to the glaze of fresh sweat on his temple. He had let John take over stroking them, and now his hands had come to rest on John’s wide-spread thighs, running their length and smoothing over his hips. Each time he dragged his short fingernails over John's skin, he left faint burning trails in their wake.
“See you, Jimmy! Masel’ and ma pals just want a wee chat!” one of the men shouted as he ran. They were getting closer. The blood was pounding in John’s veins as he skidded across the bonnet of an ancient ford fiesta and ducked around a reeking skip. Sherlock pounded through a stinking puddle of oily water, grabbing John’s elbow tightly as they hurtled round a corner. This brought them to the rear of the caravan dealership, which faced a lower brick wall punctuated regularly with shabby wooden doors and overflowing dustbins.
Sherlock didn’t seem to have noticed any of this, or perhaps he merely chose to ignore it. He glanced between Violet and Mycroft, looking surly and more than a little anxious.
Violet had grown used to having the library to herself over the months she had spent living in Aberdeenshire. Poor Mr Holmes was now unable to make it up the few stone steps into the room, and Mrs Holmes didn’t seem all that enthusiastic about using it when Violet was working in there. Sherrinford ambled in now and again to say hello and to choose a book before heading to bed; but by and large it was her space. And now, on the evening of her wedding day, Violet walked in with a new sense of possession. It was hers; really hers now.
After another fifteen minutes of huddling behind the shed, it seemed safe enough to unbolt the garden door and sneak out into the alley again. The argument between the irate greenhouse owner and the men who had been following them eventually died down, with mutual threats and dire imprecations. If the police had been called, they didn’t seem to be in a hurry to get there. (And if this was the case, John didn’t blame them.)
John opened and closed his mouth a few times, not quite knowing what to say at this point. He turned to Sherlock and shrugged apologetically.  “Um. Well. So you see how it might have looked a bit. Um.”
“Come in and have some tea then,” Violet said wearily. “Come on, you lot. You too, Murdy and Griz. We'll get Mr. Brodie to give you a lift home. And while you’re waiting for the telling-off of a lifetime, you can come and warm up by the fire.”
Violet shrugged. “Not particularly. Never wanted to be one of those ‘famous artist’ wankers who go on telly. I mean, I like it when people admire my work for what it is; not because of who I am. The last exhibition got pretty good reviews, too. It was at that Hickman place; you two had a run-in with them, didn’t you?”
“Oh, you’ll get the hang of it easily enough. You just have to watch the kick back.” Katy said confidently. “Be a dear and sort out the next couple of targets, would you?”
John knew that he wasn’t going to get anywhere talking to Sherlock when he was like this, and leant back against one of the bedposts. He sighed. “Alright. When will we start interviewing the students then?”
Christ, how it rankled, the idea of simply giving in. Of quietly packing their bags and leaving by nightfall, even if it was to remove the imminent threat over her head. If it came to it, John would do it. Sherlock would leave too, although he would probably suffer fits and have a week-long migraine from the sheer frustration of complying with the ultimatum.
“Have you told Mycroft any of this?” John asked, after a long uncomfortable moment. “I mean, maybe he doesn’t understand how frustrating it is. I mean, Sherlock used to think nothing of disappearing for days at a time, without a word of explanation…”
“Tried. Can’t.” Sherlock said tersely, and sighed in irritation. “It’s not a perfect system. Useless everyday things are easy. Some things… some things seem to leave a deeper imprint in my memory. I… I still dream about it sometimes.”
“Don’t call the gentlemen ‘laddies!’” Petty glared at her sisters. “They’re grown-ups and it’s not polite!”
They pushed and kicked him off, landing blows and yelling furiously. The girl sprang to her feet, seeming unharmed although rather dishevelled, the sleeve of her red jacket was torn. She leapt over to the man who was now pinned under three people and kicked him furiously in the ribs, screaming abuse and threats. She looked feral in the lamplight, her teeth bared and face twisted in anger.
The silence hung there, thick and heavy. They sat unmoving, Sherlock staring down at the crumpled blue sheets and John trailing soothing circles on Sherlock’s palms with his thumbs.
“No. Nor did he have his meals sent up from London. Shut up. So, one evening I decided to get to the bottom of it, and I climbed out of my bedroom window and along the gutter to look into Victor’s room. As it turned out, he had been keeping a small dog in his room.”
“Yes, never mind that now!” Duncan snapped. Mackie stared at him, evidently a little shocked at this lapse in manners. The minister shook his head fitfully and grimaced. “Sorry, Larry. I’m in a bit of a state. Have you seen Alice? I can’t find her anywhere!”
“I mean it, Sherlock.” John said, insistent. He could feel a tightness in this throat. “We really, really need to get this clear between us. I would never leave you like that.”
Violet didn’t look up for several seconds. Her hand felt chilled, despite the warmth streaming from the elaborate Victorian cast iron heater beneath the window. She eventually sighed and rubbed her left eye petulantly.
Mycroft sighed heavily, but did not look remotely perturbed. John studied him intently as he quietly took a seat on the nearby chaise longue. Part of him thought that he should leave them to it; but he was far too curious about hearing more about Sherlock and Violet’s past relationship to pay much heed to this notion.
“I always thought that he was rather homophobic, if anything.” John said awkwardly, after a moment. He remembered how George had looked when Sherlock had casually lifted his arm to check his watch while they were interviewing him. And it wasn’t as if there had been anything going on between him and Sherlock at the time. He flushed slightly.
Sherlock tensed. “I wouldn’t say that. I’ve been in sexual situations before, but I’ve never particularly wanted to instigate them.”
“Yes, John?” That was it. Probably nobody else would pick up on it, but John knew that face. That face was
“You can’t really think that he poisoned the tonic water, just to get the monopoly on alcohol sales in the village?” John asked, once they were several yards across the village square. It was nearly lunchtime, and several people were making their way along the slushy pavements. More than one local gave the pair of strangers a curious glance as they came to a halt at the icicle-laden water pump next to the central war memorial.
Something in Mycroft’s tone seemed slightly off to John, and he stared at him thoughtfully. Sherlock and Violet, laughing together. Sharing secrets. Dancing the tango. Drinking absinthe on the lawn, half naked and comfortable with each other.
Murdy turned slightly at this, tucking a heavy hank of hair behind one of her small pale ears. She stared at him blankly, but said nothing. Sherlock remained impassive, and took a small step closer before stooping to peer at the collar. “Not the original. Your mother added the black rabbit fur collar two… no, three years later. She didn’t like wearing scarves; probably because they catch the wind too much.”
John could feel the thick panic ebbing away slowly but surely. He did feel a bit silly sitting on the floor with Sherlock, focussing on his flatmates face and grasping his forearms; but it certainly seemed to work. After another few minutes Sherlock cautiously levered him to his feet and sat him down on the edge of the bed. They sat silently together for a long time, before Sherlock pushed him in the direction of the bathroom with instructions to leave the door ajar, just in case. When he came out after a long tepid shower, there was enough food to feed an army on the kitchen table and Sherlock was using a scalpel to dissect a spring roll.
Basil winced and jumped as the heavy door to the dining room slammed shut behind her. He looked thoroughly miserable, and after a minute or two got to his feet wearily; evidently having decided he had left enough time to avoid meeting Hilary again in the hall.
“This was meant for Mrs Duncan to find, wasn’t it?” Murdy said, leaning in as well. “Or at least for her to see. In the late afternoon, it’d be dark enough for her to think it was a real baby.”
He had managed to get home without breaking down. He had refused Sherlock’s offer of the traditional post-case Chinese food binge, saying that he needed to go back to Baker Street and sleep. He knew that Sherlock wasn’t remotely fooled, but couldn’t bring himself to look into the detectives eyes. John couldn’t face answering questions at the moment, and luckily Sherlock didn’t attempt to ask any. Sherlock had wandered off to take a shower while John stumbled up the stairs to his room.
John closed his mouth quickly. He was in fact remembering a line from a book he had read years before:
It was nearly impossible to make out more than the vague outlines of the monuments and high walls. John stood stock still in order to listen hard. He didn’t dare use his phone as a torch; in the near pitch-darkness it would have been an instant giveaway of his whereabouts. The only illumination came from faraway streetlights, high on the facing hill. He heard very distant traffic noise, and the breeze stirring the branches of overgrown trees. The graveyard however seemed persistently silent.
John watched Sherlock make a valiant attempt not to be impatient. “I asked you how close you and Miss Garner were, Phyllis. Were you particular friends?”
Mycroft watched this display of hysteria with no small amount of horror. He clearly wasn’t used to women having fits of mirth in his presence. “I should make it clear that if I decide that my brother does not maintain his current level of... hmm…
“Ok, I think. He’s always been nice to her in front of me. Patronises her a bit. Finds her a bit embarrassing at times, I reckon… because she does bang on a bit about God. But nobody minds round here – she actually
“Once we’re back at the house I suppose I could make a gingersnap or two,” Violet said grudgingly. “Anthea, come and get some tea while it’s still hot!”
As the jeep picked up speed on the road leading north from Hilderbogie, John stared ahead blankly. Through the hastily defrosted windscreen the straight white road stretched ahead, banked on either side by ice-laden fences and stunted pines. Anthea was in the drivers seat to his right, her gloved hands gripping the wheel firmly. She was silent as she drove, her gaze intent. She was wearing an oversized waxed coat and heavy scarf that Violet had dug out for her, her elegant hands swamped by a pair of moth-eaten woollen gloves. He could see Griz in the rear view mirror, slumped in the back seat. She too was silent, pensively chewing on a fingertip as she stared out the window. Occasionally she directed Anthea to take a particular turning when the road branched, but she seemed lost in her own thoughts.
“It doesn’t sound like anything was taken, they just made a bit of a mess.” John glared down at his phone. “I suppose it could have just been opportunistic. Loads of people go away over the holidays and leave empty flats. Might have just been some bored kids.”
“I’m sure there isn’t!” John interjected hastily, in an attempt to placate her. The young woman looked like she’d quite like to throw her ledger at Sherlock’s head and he didn’t want to have to bandage him up just yet.
He stopped abruptly on the first step when he heard the bell of the front door chime. He dithered slightly, tempted to sneak away and let somebody else come and answer it; but there was no sound coming from either of the long corridors that led from the great hall. Sighing, he dropped Sherlock’s coat in a bundle on the central table and made for the grand panelled double doors. He swung one of them open and froze.
“Oh really. You just assaulted a woman by accident, then?” John asked quietly, bending over George and staring into his wide eyes.
John thought he saw Violet hitting her head slowly and repeatedly against the edge of her easel as they left. He took a quick glance at Hilary as she followed them down the corridor; her beautiful face was carefully blank.
Still, though – he thought that he might be able to identify a woman who would be willing to marry into the Holmes family.
“I saw her heading upstairs not five minutes ago.” Margaret said darkly, returning to her sweeping. John stared at the floor, momentarily distracted from his laundry anxiety.
He took a breath and seemed to be on the verge of saying something else, but evidently decided against it. He smiled back at her, that same bright flicker across his odd (but now, suddenly, quite beautiful) face.
John panted, leaning back against Sherlock’s chest and letting the back of his head rest on Sherlock’s shoulder. His chest heaved convulsively as he attempted to get his breathing back under control. “You...
“All this-“ John gestured towards the boxes and bags, which Sherlock appeared to be determinedly ignoring. “It’s my stuff, isn’t it?”
“Why would he do that, though? It sounded like he wanted to get clear of her. It doesn’t make sense that he’d give her his address.”
“How should I know?” Sherlock muttered back. “I will freely admit my ignorance of this sort of thing, John. I can only imagine that the cloaks would be a bit impractical for fighting and climbing up hillsides. I suspect that most of them have a few theatre blood pellets around their persons, for appearances sake. There is no way that man over there would have that much blood on his face and chest without there being a fatality involved.”
, his face creased and his body contorted with the effort of not making noise. He caught John’s gaze and laughed even harder at John’s confusion.
Just as they were rounding a corner onto a weedy tennis court, John was awakened from his dreamy musings by the sharp crack of gunfire. Sherlock’s arm flew out instantly, blocking John’s path onto the court. He peered interestedly around the hedge and called “Miss Boorman! May we approach?”
“I ‘spose it was the residual heat in the depths of the engine that registered on the camera?” Violet asked, staring at the outline of the wreckage.
“I know, John.” A pause. “And you should know... that this is always going to be your room. No matter how long you’ve been away.” Sherlock’s tone was measured, even if the words were coming out a little slower than usual. He cleared his throat noisily. “Goodnight, John.”
?!” Violet hooted, evidently reading his thoughts. “The twins are a public menace. Clever as anything too, although they’ve evidently decided to use their powers for evil for the time being.”
On principle, Sherlock opened his mouth to argue but then stopped. This was the kind of moment where John would be stepping on his foot or not-so-subtly elbowing him in the side. Patrick was smiling at him, polite and charming. He was resolutely not looking at Mycroft, who had his back turned and was fussily placing the plates in the dishwasher. The atmosphere had shifted infinitesimally; the faint creases in Patrick’s forehead just a little more pronounced.
It seemed that he and Mrs. Hudson were the only exceptions to the rule. He had gotten used to Sherlock’s proximity surprisingly quickly; and Mrs. Hudson seemed to be utterly unaware of the effect Sherlock had on some people. He had even seen her pat down Sherlock’s hair once or twice as she walked past his chair.
Sherlock laughed shakily, curling a little more tightly around John and bringing their foreheads together. He seemed unable to respond, even in a characteristically acerbic manner.
“Looks like she’s about to have a serious chat with her dad…” John added, watching Murdy and Mr. Antonelli heading towards a table in the corner. “He doesn’t look too appalled, though.”
Sherlock was fairly sure that Bruno Trenet had not been in Montpellier at the time. He could find no trace of the man among his memories; his previous conclusions about the man led him to believe that he must have been incarcerated for other reasons when his brother was arrested. It was more than likely Jacob Trenet had delegated the chore of tracking down Sherlock to Bruno once he was released.
“Doesn’t matter.” she snapped impatiently, roughly grabbing it out of his pocket before beginning to scroll through the numbers. A second later she seized hold of the discarded Bakelite telephone that lay on the carpet and began dialling feverishly, her gaze intent and her fingers absolutely steady. When her call was connected Violet spoke over the person who answered at once, her tone forceful and full of steel.
. I really only spent considerable amounts of time here after Violet arrived; I suppose that was the only time I really enjoyed the place.”
After a second he felt Sherlock’s hands prising his fingers away from his face. For a sudden mad moment, he was tempted to resist or to made a bid for freedom down the corridor. Sighing, he dropped his hands, and looked up at Sherlock who was regarding him with a mixture of fondness and incredulity.
Sherrinford spoke to the young lady on the phone a few days later. She told him, in a rather peculiar lilting accent, that she would be utterly charmed to come and visit him at Hilderbogie the following week. She could inspect the Holmes family collections and they could discuss terms of employment.
Before John could open his mouth to retort, Sherlock lurched suddenly and staggered; gasping. He grasped the windowsill of the cottage they were passing, large dollops of melting snow slipping down his back. A large and well-aimed snowball had struck him squarely in the back of the head.
“Gladly.” Sherlock retorted, and swept out the door with John trailing behind him in embarrassment. The pub door slammed shut behind them, swiftly followed by the sound of bolts sliding home violently.
Petty shrugged slightly. “It’s not so bad. I have a feeling that the Reverend might have something to do with that, actually – he’s been awful nice about it, considering what poor Mrs Duncan’s been though. He won’t hear a word against Dad. Says that we’re to let the police sort it out and leave judgement up to the Almighty. A couple of lads shouted at the twins yesterday; but they can dish out far worse than they get. Poor Pheemy is in bits, though – she can’t get over the fact that everyone is ready to believe the worst of us. She tried going to visit Miss Argyle in the hospital, to see how she’s doing; but the old hag shouted horrible names at her before she could say a word.”
“Text message?” John asked tentatively, although he had definite doubts himself about the existence of the message. The way Mrs. Duncan had described it, it had sounded almost mystical. (
Darkness seemed to be falling more and more swiftly, and already a thin crescent moon had edged above the distant hills. Crows were settling in flurries in the higher branches of the skeletal trees in the woods. More than once, John slipped on the uneven icy path and had to grab for Sherlock’s arm before he ended up on the ground. Eventually, Sherlock sighed and kept hold of John’s gloved hand and tucked it into the crook of his elbow. Annoyingly, even though Sherlock was wearing his usual leather shoes he was managing to maintain his balance with what looked like perfect ease.
on your blog for a long time, Doctor Watson. You and dear Mr. Holmes are sharing a bedroom here, aren’t you?”
“That’s what it’s called, isn’t it? Petrichor. Smell of rain on dry earth. I love it. The word, too. Definitely in my top five smells.”
MacFadden nodded again, and bent to examine her vitals. Patrick moved out of his way, and attempted to get the Reverend to take a seat nearby but the man just clutched the back of the sofa wordlessly, looking utterly shocked.
“Given?” Menzies frowned, obviously surprised by this statement. “The man clearly committed suicide, Mr. Holmes.”
much, Violet.” Sherlock muttered bitterly, slouching down in his seat and taking a mouthful of wine.
“I’m just trying to make it clear that my previous sexual experiences have not been particularly... rewarding.” Sherlock said evenly.
“Oh for christ’s sake!” Sherlock shouted incredulously, emerging from the pantry with two dusty bottles of Amarone and staring at them in despair. “I thought I made it very clear that you two are not allowed to get involved!”
It certainly wasn’t a hideous or ugly face but it was disconcerting. It brought you up short. Broad scars stretched from Violet’s right temple and down across her cheekbone. There was another, smaller scar to the left of her pointed chin, almost like an afterthought. John suspected that there had also been trauma to her right eye although it appeared unscathed – her left eye was bright blue, but the right was a sleepy brown.
He resumed his gentle stroking, squeezing Sherlock’s thigh apologetically. The man was trembling and glazed with sweat, and the incoherent sounds of desire he was making seemed almost pained.
“SHAN'T! WON'T!” Violet’s voice rang out, but she thankfully chose not to come in. “Look, I’m quite sure that John is a complete champion at oral sex; he’s got that look about him. But you’ll want to see this, I promise! You can resume the rumpy-pumpy later. Get your arses down to the kitchen, we’ve got something to show you!”
Sherlock shut his eyes and sighed, John dissolving away as he took a closer look at his surroundings as the firelight filled it. A lopsided table stood propped against one wall, next to a couple of rickety stools. A food safe hung on the wall, the metal door hanging open to reveal it’s total lack of contents. A shelf with a couple of rusting saucepans; a chipped enamel mug. An out of date Lonely Planet guide to Scotland. A low wooden sleeping platform in the corner to the left of the fireplace, two mouldering sacks of straw piled at one end. No running water or sink. A spade stood propped against the wall next to the door, giving Sherlock a clear indication of plumbing arrangements.
“Oh, I’m sure we can do better than cheese and stale biscuits. You will be staying for dinner, won’t you?”
Sherlock obligingly turned to the well-stocked mahogany cabinet and reached for the gin. John did his best to quell the blush from his face as he sank into one of the wing-backed armchairs next to the fireplace. Violet grinned up at him cheekily, hugging her knees.
The man with the case nodded briskly, dropping his coat on the floor and bending over Mrs. Duncan. He was a slight man, with a kind and rather prematurely lined face. “Indeed. How long was she in the water?”
“We die in the snow or we die in the fire. No real difference. Tell me, Mister Holmes. You ever taste your own blood?”
“But Mrs. Duncan said that they were friends!” John exclaimed. “Would Miss Argyle be willing to endanger her friend’s life like that?”
“Let’s leave them to it.” John murmured, pulling the door closed. “Come on, Murdy. Almost getting stabbed always leaves me pretty peckish, how about you?”
“Whose drinking?” Murdy asked curiously, resuming her seat at the table. John swallowed hard and blinked. He hadn’t noticed her hanging up the phone or coming back to the table.
John shrugged in a non-committal sort of way, and pocketed the box without opening it. Looking down, he was rather dismayed to see that he was coated in a thick layer of grey dust, and a swipe of his hand confirmed that his face and hair were similarly covered. It seemed rather unfair that it was his lot in life to appear as sloppy and uncouth as possible in front of Patrick.
“Archivist.” Violet said quietly. John had had his back to her and Sherlock where they sat on the tiles, and he had been trying to block the line of sight between them. He hadn’t heard her getting to her feet or approaching the twitching Marmaduke.
“And the murder investigation?” John reminded him, trying not to stare at the way Sherlock was licking blackberry jam from his fingers. Sherlock caught his gaze and smiled slowly at him, with intent but also a little shyly. John flushed and looked away.
“Shut up!” John laughed, and reached for Sherlock’s hand. “Anyway. It appears that Patrick thinks I’m
John studied Basils sweaty, good natured and not terribly bright face and felt rather sorry for the young man. He was obviously terrified at the idea of losing Hilary; to the point he seemed at danger of having an anxiety attack.
“Mmm.” John said vaguely, his eyes wandering back to the detective. He grinned as Sherlock seized an elderly lady by the hand and briskly waltzed her up and down a short avenue of dancers. “He taught me to waltz once, a long time ago.” he said without thinking, and winced.
John squinted through the chain link, and looked more closely at the caravans. They certainly did look a little neglected, with weeds and litter clustered in the corners of the yard and under the wheels of the trailers. A sudden sound from the direction they had come from made him jump slightly, and his heart sank.
“Your uncle and I had an arrangement, Mycroft. Before we got married, we made things very clear. I’ve got a bloody bit of paper with the details on it; we damn well
“Well, you weren’t the only one who’d started saying that when they saw him.” Violet commented. “Look at poor Maggie Horsburgh there, she’s practically drooling. I don’t think he ever noticed she was alive.”
John nodded in what he hoped was a sympathetic way. He didn’t know if she saw, though, as she seemed unable to look up at him just yet.
John slipped a little lower, and pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s neglected cock which was twitching and flushed. The sheet beneath was spotted with dewy moisture. When his lips reached the glans, Sherlock gave a hoarse shout and his body bowed; hot wetness spurting across John’s face as he came. John slipped the tip of his finger across Sherlock’s prostate gently until the trembling man made a slight noise of protest, his breath hissing softly between his teeth.
John risked a quick glance around Sherlock’s shoulder. Patrick had his back to them, and was talking to an older red-haired man with a florid face. He was probably in his sixties, and wore a heavy looking green waxed jacket. The man did indeed look suspicious; although he seemed to relax slightly when Patrick leaned a little closer to whisper something to him.
“Christ. I’ll try and get him up to his room. He might see sense and stay in one place until it wears off.” John said, without much hope. “Go and see if Hilary is alright. She didn’t come upstairs, so she probably headed for the garden or conservatory.”
“Oh, come on. Look at the bloke!” John snorted. “He must have people coming on to him all the time.”
Sherlock looked up sharply at this, and John couldn’t do anything but let him read whatever was in his exhausted face. “Where was he wounded?”
“I felt the need to confiscate his supplies.” John said, not bothering to inquire exactly how Sherlock knew exactly where the dust had come from. “He’s high as a kite and he’s been making a nuisance of himself. I thought it wisest.”
Sherlock made to sweep into the room without addressing any of them, but the girl sitting nearest the door swiftly shot out a leg to block his way.
It suddenly struck John that Patrick, despite his usual handsome and polished demeanour, looked a little tense around the eyes and perhaps a little thinner than he had been a few months ago.
John nodded uneasily, fighting the impulse to argue. Mycroft didn’t say anything further, gazing sharp-eyed out the window as the shadows closed in around them. Night was approaching swiftly.
“No, not Uncle Sherry. The sherry that the Reverend Duncan bought,” he said impatiently. “If Mrs. Duncan is secretly an alcoholic, why is he buying sherry?”
He became aware of Sherlock’s shoulder shaking against his, and turned to look at the detective. Sherlock was laughing, no,
Thankfully, it was a quieter affair than the night before. Violet only provided dinner for the students three nights a week and the rest of the time they were left to their own devices. Sherlock and John found her in the kitchen, wearing a flowered apron over a trailing scarlet evening dress and swearing quietly into a pot of pasta. She directed a distracted smile in their direction as they entered the room, not quite meeting their eyes.
Violet took her time answering him, slouching further down into her nest of ancient mildewed cushions. “Not the way you mean it, I don’t think. You’re wondering if I’d like a husband and kids, or even a significant other. And the answer to that is unreservedly
“A spot of Dutch courage, beasties?” Violet asked, breaking into his thoughts. He turned with a smile, accepting one of the small tumblers of whisky she and Patrick had carried from the makeshift bar in the corner. Sherlock accepted his own glass with a nod and took a small sip, scanning the crowd with interest.
“No. I went and got it for you. I thought that you perhaps wouldn’t want to go back there just yet. I had a look in the bag you brought with you, and frankly that maroon jumper is offensive and you only brought two pairs of pants, one sock and no books at all. I decided that I simply couldn’t look at you for any length of time if you were planning on wearing that jumper. It makes my eyeballs itch, John. It contains
Abandoning his efforts to pull the seat towards him, he braced his left foot against it and began to kick. The impact of each blow resulted in a sharp, brutal sting against his ankle as the metal bars abraded his skin; digging viciously into the muscle.
It was horribly sweet tea, too strong and without enough milk. John took a sip, and it burned his frozen lips. But the faint pain of it grounded him. He still felt chilled and hollow, but his thoughts were clearing rapidly. Violet sat down close to him and leant into his side.
He eventually managed to crack one eye open briefly. Sherlock was kneeling in front of him, looking into his face intently. Slowly, Sherlock reached out and put his hand on John’s wrist. John’s arms had been wrapped tightly around his torso; it seemed wise at the time as he felt that it was likely that he would physically disintegrate. He let Sherlock pull his arms away from his chest, and breathing did become a little easier (
The reasoning behind this became clear when Sherlock dropped heavily into the fireside armchair in the drawing room and leaned towards Murdy, who was curled up on the hearthrug warming her hands around a steaming mug of tea. “Mrs. Duncan. Not an alcoholic, correct?”
“Miss Argyle thought that the Antonellis must be behind the poisonings, because they’re Italian.” John interjected.
Sherlock held his gaze for a few moments longer, before deliberately stepping into his space. He loomed over John, who inhaled deeply and fought the urge to bury his face in Sherlock’s chest. The man smelt heady, his own scent and strong coffee. His eyes were wide, shining grey-green as he leant closer to John.
He ignored the faint lurch in his gut [mere aftereffect of the drug, without question] and thought hard. Narek had been sent. He almost seemed to be trying to prove himself in some way, showing off and breaking rank. Itching to use his knife. He was no criminal mastermind; he and Schneider had been sent by a third party.
“But seeing as how you’ve already smashed a couple of those bloody gnomes….” Violet mused thoughtfully, taking a quick look up and down the quiet street. “Come on… let’s have a go at these rotten little squirrel ornaments too.”
“Infused with elderflower and traces of rhubarb, oddly enough.” He remarked. “There’s the bitterness of the quinine, of course; but there’s something else there too.”
Violet stopped dead on the threshold of the kitchen, her hand clutching at the doorframe. John frowned, speeding up so that he could come and peer over her shoulder.
“It was Reverend Duncan!” Murdy informed her, seeming unable to hold the information in any longer. She was curled up on one of the kitchen chairs, cradling a large mug of tea in her hands. “PC Dalziell took him off to the police station an hour ago, and he as good as confessed to us after we got him on the ground!”
that she didn’t; but I don’t think that she wanted to take the time to find another box.” Mr. Mackie grimaced. “She also told me off for tracking the tiniest wee bit of mud into the bowling club hall. Glared at me and told me that cleanliness was next to Godliness, the old besom.”
His gaze at the wreckage around them, the snow falling and beginning to melt in the growing heat from the vehicle. The crows cawed sharply behind him, causing Sherlock to stir slightly. One of them was pecking at a dark green bundle in the snow nearby, something caught on the stunted branch of a pine. Sherlock glared at it and began to heave himself over the edge of the doorframe; forcing his shaking legs to propel him into the deep snow beyond.
The orgasm took John by surprise, sharp tingles rushing to the base of his spine. The sudden tightness of his balls made him bite down savagely on his lower lip. The come flowed messily over his knuckles and he sighed deeply, sliding his sticky hand into Sherlock’s outstretched fingers. His chest heaved and he closed his eyes, flopping back onto the crumpled sheets.
“Will you eat dinner tonight?” John grinned, trailing his finger in languid torturous circles around Sherlock’s rim. The dark curly head nodded frantically into the sheets. “Will you take out the bins?”
Sherlock was still frankly rubbish at talking about things. Following that afternoon on the Millennium bridge, John had suggested that he write down what he wanted to say. That it might be easier, that Sherlock could reorder his thoughts on paper and then just give them to John to read.
He stared up at the ceiling, frowning slightly at the many faint blotches on the paint. Most of them were around and above the desk, but some had spread and splattered almost to the far side of the room.
“I know for a fact that Sandra wanted him to marry her, but he wouldn't hear of it. She was chasing him around for weeks, but he wouldn’t do it. He told me that he didn’t want to be tied down, not to a girl like her.” His voice was a kind of high pitched drawl and he seemed to have the habit of licking his thin red lips rather too often.
“Although…” Violet brightened up a little, and leant closer to John. She spoke in a stage whisper as Sherlock took a seat opposite him. “-did he ever tell you about the time he tried to create a Philosopher’s-“
“Then give it over and lets go and get warmed up. No, shut up, I know your ribs hurt. You shouldn’t be carrying anything.” He tugged the box from Sherlock’s reluctant fingers and led the way upstairs.
John smiled a little, desperately wishing that she would come back to herself a little. She seemed smaller somehow, listless and a little cold. And anger was there too, chills and hurt.
“I want these inside me.” Sherlock explained, his mouth flushed and slick. “I want… I want you to show me how you’d get me ready for you, John.”
“Oh.” Sherlock looked down at his fingers, which were worrying the red gingham tablecloth restlessly. “I… I play the violin. Quite loudly, sometimes.”
“By this time, Philip had come to realise that I wasn’t stupid. I still clammed up whenever he was around; he scared me still. And he disappeared frequently for several days or weeks at a time. But eventually, he took over where Hedda left off. He started taking me to galleries, to auctions. He showed me the art collections owned by the family, a lot of which was kept in a special climate controlled room in the cellars of the house. Other items were kept in a storage facility in Bergen. He taught me about pigments, about technique, about canvases and style. I didn’t really understand at first why he put so much emphasis on the physical nature of the paintings; he didn’t seem to care very much about what the artist was trying to say. He didn’t seem to have any kind of sense of beauty; he didn’t seem to feel much about the paintings. He simply didn’t understand when I would linger for as long as possible in front of one work and not another, particularly if it was deemed to be less valuable. He was impatient and scathing if I forgot something he taught me, so I had to be quick. When I proved myself capable of absorbing everything he told me, he set about teaching me to draw. No, not draw per se… to copy. He would make me sketch a painting ten times in a day, over and over again. I hadn’t known that I could draw before, because I’d never had the chance. But I was good at it, even he could see that. But he didn’t care about the things I drew for myself. It made him angry, even. He didn’t want me to develop a style, because of course he was only interested in the styles of others.
Violet made an unconvinced sort of noise. “He’s not what you’d call the most approachable of souls though, is he? I mean, when you look like that, it takes someone with a certain level of confidence to try it on.”
And it wasn’t just that it had been a terribly long time since John had shared a bed with anyone. It would be all too easy to say that that was the reason he was luxuriating in this warm intimacy, that he would welcome almost anyone into his arms. It was Sherlock; it was this one person he wanted next to him.
Violet shook her head. “No. Someplace down in England. The accent suggests Lancashire with a spell in London at some point, but he’s pretty cagey about where he’s from. I’ve always been of the opinion that he came here to get away from something.”
He grinned around at the crowd, clearly revelling in the attention of at least a hundred pairs of eyes. “I’ll spare you the details, but your neighbourhood schoolteacher tricked the unfortunate Mrs. Duncan into endangering her own life as a means to incriminate the Antonelli family. Alice Duncan was already in a weakened state, and she almost died as a result. She probably would have, too, if it wasn’t for Murdina here. She leapt into the water straight away, without thought of the danger to her own person. Hardly the act of someone hell-bent on homicide.”
are the individual who came closest to killing Alice Duncan, Miss Argyle!” Sherlock said cheerily. He sidled through the crowd that now seemed to be leaning away slightly from the woman, swiftly followed by an intrigued looking Violet. “No doubt you will have heard that she is back in hospital, following a fall into the river last night. Would you like to tell everyone here how you are responsible for that?”
“I know what being shot looks like.” Sherlock says dismissively. “I’m not interested in the mechanics.”
But while Trenet was alive and well in maximum security, Harman was extremely dead. When Sherlock had learnt the details of the arms dealer’s demise, he was almost persuaded of the idea that Mycroft was
Violet grinned at him devilishly, raising one of her own delicate eyebrows in response. “I’m not surprised. At least he doesn’t seem to think that I’m having it off with Sherlock anymore.”
There was so much they hadn’t talked about. He’d been so sure that the two of them would be together forever. No questions asked. They’d stay in Baker Street, they’d continue having ludicrous adventures indefinitely. Maybe, many years into the future, they’d think about getting some help with the legwork. Sherlock might move into research more. John could finally get around to writing a book. It didn’t matter what they did, just so long as they were together. The thought of them having a family had never occurred to him. It wasn’t something he’d ever been conscious of wanting. It was ridiculous; how on earth would children fit into their life? They were in serious danger at least once a week. You couldn’t bring kids into a situation like that. They’d end up being targets themselves. There was an extremely high chance that they could end up being orphans.
Patrick clapped the red haired man on the shoulder, tossed back his own whiskey and headed for the door without a backwards glance. He was tucking an envelope into his pocket as he went. As John peered cautiously around Sherlock’s shoulder again he noticed the man at the bar tucking something into the back pocket of his trousers.
John stared at the spot on the map, heart pounding, undecided. Mycroft would already be on his way back to their rendezvous point. But surely it would be worth just a few more minutes search, just to be sure. It couldn’t be more than another mile at the most. He couldn’t leave any stone unturned, not now that he’d come this far.
He gritted his teeth and dragged the match along the rough strip on the matchbook, steadying his hand by grasping his wrist firmly. He slowly touched the match to the nearest twist of paper, then gently to another, and another. He held his breath as he watched it flicker and catch, smoke beginning to swirl and stream up the draughty stone chimney. He blew on the flames after a long moment, encouraging them to catch and leap beneath the logs. Sherlock didn’t dare look away until he was quite sure the wood was properly beginning to catch fire, and the bright flames continued to dance in his vision as he looked around the newly illuminated bothy.
“Mm. Evidently not gay on a full-time basis. But I’m going to find out what it is he’s so keen on hiding. We’ll follow him tonight if he goes out.”
“Then if it doesn’t work; we’ll stop.” Sherlock said, simply. “Besides, I don’t have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, don’t be absurd.”
He poured some of the dark, slightly medicinal smelling shampoo out of the bottle and into his palm, carelessly dropping the heavy bottle over the side one more. When he began to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, he was careful not to let his hands tangle in the curls. He instinctively knew that this was another small act of trust, Sherlock asking him to do this.
“Don’t be silly, Vi. It’s no trouble at all.” Katy said in a cool businesslike tone that belied the kind expression in her eyes. “This is much less fuss than bringing in a gaggle of strangers who would only put your things back in entirely the wrong places.”
Sherlock helped him up the stairs and made sure he didn’t topple over until he reached the bed. The room was indeed as he left it; slightly dusty but fairly neat. The mess from downstairs hadn’t managed to make its way up here. There were sheets on the bed, and when John lay back he could vaguely make out the smell of lavender scented starch. He shut his eyes and thought a bit about getting undressed and under the covers but it all seemed like a tremendous amount of effort.
“Mm. Maybe I’ll just take a bit of a rest here, shall I? it’s still early. I could do with a bit more of a snooze before breakfast, frankly.”
“Yes, for a while. Probably best not to wait up for me.” Sherlock said, without looking at John. He slowly stripped off his gloves and dropped them on the inlaid mahogany hall table, turning away.
“Mmm… I had to cut his hair for him before we went out. He was beginning to look a bit like some kind of collie dog by then,” Violet commented, and turned the page. In the next photo Sherlock was dancing himself, grasping the hand of a pink-cheeked girl as they spun between a long line of guests. The dark, almost indigo blue tartan was swirling as he moved and his dark hair was sticking slightly to his forehead with sweat. He was grinning; not at his partner but at Violet who was dancing with Sherry a little further down the row of people. She was laughing hard, her hair falling down messily over her shoulders as she turned. John caught sight of Felicia nearby, her face unsmiling as she stared at Violet. In fact, several people were staring at Violet in the photo and John could hardly blame them. She was unarguably beautiful, but what captured his attention was the sheer glee in her face; the vitality in the way she was throwing herself into the dance. She looked as if she hadn’t a care in the world.
Sherlock suddenly felt crushingly, horribly tired. His head wheeled and ached, his stomach seething with nausea. For a moment he was almost tempted just to sink where he was, to await his fate with Narek.
Four figures had split off from the main group, and had stationed themselves by the crumbling walls of the ruined church. An eerie, wailing noise cut through the silence and it took John a moment to realise that a young woman in a red sweater was playing a musical saw. To her right, a younger man was playing a violin, and to her left an older man was gently hitting a small round drum. A teenage girl sat nearby on a wooden box, playing a cello. The music was deeply strange, and rather mournful. It took him more than a few seconds to recognise the piece they were playing, although he had heard Sherlock perform it more than once. The Danse Macabre.
“Not just for that.” Sherlock informed him grimly. “Where do you think my captors stayed beforehand? It’s the only place in the village they could have been.”
[Why didn’t you want Mummy and Father to meet him? I mean, besides the obvious reasons of their being embarrassing and boring. But he wanted to.]
Violet lit a cigarette and shook her head after a moment or two. She exhaled a lungful of pungent smoke and sighed. “Not this time. He’s got enough to worry about at the moment. We’d better get your clothes dried quickly, though – it’d be a bit obvious if you went home in anything of mine. Any of my clothes would drown you. Pun unintended.”
“It was in Armenia that it happened. I had been there for nearly six weeks, trying to track down a man called Harman whom I knew had supplied Moriarty with arms several times. I thought initially that he would be able to lead me to the Turkish branch of Moriarty’s empire, but after trailing him for some time and talking to his acquaintances, I realised he also had dealings with even bigger fish. He was supplying explosives and guns to terrorist groups in Belfast and also in Munich. It became clear that he was involved with a plot with the ‘real’ IRA to completely derail the current political status quo in Northern Ireland. A bombing was planned that was going to create absolute chaos, and it was going to leave both Belfast and Londonderry in ruins. He wasn’t just a supplier; he was a smaller-scale Moriarty in his own right. He helped organise carnage, not because of any political or personal agenda; he was just good at it. He enjoyed it. Sometimes he charged for his expertise, and sometimes he did it as a favour.
[It’s possible that I am slightly… preoccupied at the moment.] Mycroft’s tone was flat. Carefully calm.
Patrick was making his way through a pedestrian laneway that snaked past an ugly modern glass building and he paused at a junction to let several cyclists go past. John realised too late that he was standing in a cycle lane, and was hissed at loudly by a couple of students.
“Well, I believe that one does put it in mince pies,” Patrick offered, polishing his glasses thoughtfully and looking to Violet for confirmation.
As she turned, he caught sight of something that was making the pocket of her smart draped cardigan bulge oddly. It seemed unlike her to neglect a detail of her appearance like that, and he craned his neck to take a look as she paused to peruse the newly arrived post on the hall table.
“Oh, it’s Lestrade. Case, maybe?” he muttered, opening the first of five or six unopened messages. “Blimey, I’m popular today.”
“I’ve sent Violet up to her room. I’m not an idiot; I know what that filthy swine Marmaduke is capable of and I saw her wrists. Is he out of harm’s way?”
He stopped dead as he passed Patrick’s room, which he had distractedly glanced into as he passed. It was a large, sparsely furnished room with dark red hangings and ill-lit by the tall narrow windows. John almost didn’t notice the dark tangle of Patrick’s hair or his outstretched hand. He almost didn’t hear the awful, soft wet noises he was making, audible only because of the utter silence of the house.
“Look,” Sherlock said with what he considered to be an admirable attempt at patience. “I don’t expect you to understand this. You can’t. Your mind doesn’t-“
“Oh, the little sweetie is doing a school project using some of the books in the library.” Violet said smoothly, completely failing to identify Murdy by name. “In fact, shouldn’t you be off home dear?” she added, flicking a meaningful gaze at Murdy. The latter bristled somewhat, although John suspected it was mainly due to Violet’s sickly epithet. The girl seemed inclined to protest, but eventually nodded jerkily before turning and clumping off across the snow-covered gravel.
“Mr. Antonelli.” Sherlock paused, and John was surprised by the gentleness of his tone. “You have a family full of intelligent women, and they all deserve any opportunities that come their way. Murdy deserves to be rewarded for her assistance. She would have the opportunity to be educated and the chance to meet others on her intellectual level. Violet can arrange extra courses for Murdy at the University and access to any library in the city.”
“Twenty-three. Poor wee thing.” she said darkly. “She had no parents, nobody to warn her about falling in with that lot. I tried, the Lord knows, but she wouldn’t listen to me.”
Caroline. She could have used anything else to draw him away, to distract him. But Mary chose to use that, the thing that she must have known wounded him; the injury that had flayed him raw. It was that fact that left him clenching his jaw, hesitating on the threshold of the kitchen. Only the idea of Sherlock, being carried further and further away every second propelled him into the kitchen.
Sherlock knew he’d had a reason for being there, and he recalled it after an embarrassingly sluggish 0.4 seconds mental struggle. “Mycroft. Take Mummy and Father to
Sherlock looked mutinous, wrapping his wool dressing gown more tightly around his frame. It had only been with extreme reluctance and after he had extracted several frankly obscene promises from John that he had agreed to get out of bed, no matter what Violet had said. “It had better be worth it. I cannot believe she interrupted-“
He supposed he should feel fortunate that Sherlock was responding to these inane comments at all, but John was beginning to feel more and more uneasy. He would have welcomed a scathing remark about John’s feeble grasp of winter daylight hours, or the dreadful tedium of rural scenery. But Sherlock merely stared ahead, obviously miles away.
, John would have been itching to fight; to defend; to throw himself into a melee with never a thought for his own personal safety. And Sherlock would be shoulder to shoulder with him as he advanced, straight-backed and sure; his face not betraying the [not good] bone-deep rightness and glee that came from the two of them, fighting together.
at it than me!” He practically spat the last statement, and John avoided Patrick’s eyes in an attempt not to giggle.
The panic had barely enough time to register before she said, in an almost perfectly calm voice: “Patrick is going to be alright. Mr Holmes says he’s still in intensive care, but that he should recover with minimal effects.”
“It feels like a lifetime ago, now.” Violet said thoughtfully. “I mean, Christ- the things we do when we’re twenty, eh? Ever feel like you want to take your younger self aside and just give them a damn good talking to?”
Sherlock had only managed to manoeuvre himself a few degrees onto his back, before coming to an abrupt halt; his torso twisted in a way that caused a sudden spasm of pain in his lower back. His head ached damnably. Trenet’s corpse was curled on top of his legs, his horribly lolling head pressed against the side of Sherlock’s right thigh. The blood was still dripping and oozing from what had once been his throat; it was rapidly soaking through the grey fabric of Sherlock’s pajama bottoms. The gory stain spread and cooled in the icy air.
of us. I think we were both kind of....er....over-eager. And I told you to get a move on. Because I wanted it so badly.” He felt his face flush in the cold air, and stared into the water below. He lowered his voice, leaning in a little closer. “Wanted you. It’s really bloody exciting, Sherlock – you have no idea. This is all so new to me and it’s sort of like discovering sex all over again… well. And the fact that it’s with
He stepped closer, the handle of the knife clenched in his fist. Mary’s eyes were calculating as he moved towards her, giving way to real alarm as Mycroft made no attempt to stop him. The elder Holmes merely folded his arms, watching John advance with a faintly curious expression. John couldn’t bear it, couldn’t stand seeing her sitting there and calmly admitting to
Dinner that evening was an informal, slightly haphazard affair of what Violet termed ‘leftover tapas’ around the kitchen table. Sherlock sat at John’s left, hair damp from the bath and wrapped in his dressing gown. He was largely silent, although his narrowed eyes followed Lestrade suspiciously as he bustled around the kitchen, following Violet’s instructions and fetching silverware.
John stared at Sherlock, utterly bewildered. What on earth was this all about? Sherlock had buried his face in his hands, and looked as if he had retreated utterly from the conversation. His shoulders were rigid and his posture indicated complete and total frustration. Could this possibly be the truth?
She broke off, and glared at the nurse nervously holding a tray at the end of her bed. The woman swallowed hard and made a brave attempt at a cheerful smile. “Excuse me, Miss Argyle? I’ve got some more tablets for you to take now.”
“Oh, um.” John frowned slightly, recalling the events of the day before. “It wasn’t what you might call a traditional sort of Christmas, but we liked it.” He remembered how Sherlock had looked falling asleep the night before, and felt his mouth suddenly curve into a much more natural smile. Patrick raised an eyebrow, but evidently chose not to pursue that particular line of enquiry.
“It’s rather charming, really.” Patrick said, after a moment. He stared into the depths of his glass.
Patrick took a seat next to John, again watching with an oddly fascinated expression as Sherlock began to shovel linguine into his mouth with ill-concealed relish.
But the fact that Sherlock felt the need to apologise for this? There were many, many things that the detective could apologise to John for; big and small. The continuing presence of the human femurs in the cutlery drawer at 221B for a start. His complete disregard for anyone’s privacy but his own. The way he saw no problem in waking John up at 4am to tell him about a particularly fascinating thought he’d had about blood coagulation. Why suddenly decide to start now?
Obligingly, John lowered his head and ran his tongue slowly across the soft damp skin again, tasting the salt and musk, exploring the texture of the fine coarse hair. With each pass of his tongue the skin tightened more, Sherlock’s balls nestling closer to the base of his cock. His thighs were trembling, and Sherlock seemed to be having a hard time keeping still, his back arching helplessly and his long legs falling wide open. Surprising even himself, John slipped a little lower on the bed and let his tongue slip down behind Sherlock’s sac, pausing to lap messily at his perineum.
Sherlock obviously deduced that John was on the verge of collapse, and insinuated his very sharp elbow subtly into his side. John coughed loudly and managed to keep his face straight.
“He’s that famous detective laddie from London!” Rab explained loudly to the crowd. “An’ he’s one of the Holmeses, right?”
He turned his coat collar up, and waited while John looped the scarf around his own neck. They began to make their way back to the gap in the fence.
“I sometimes wonder that too.” John murmured, gazing thoughtfully into the depths of the plants and shrubs below. “Meeting Sherlock – it was such a fluke. I could have chosen to walk down a different path in the park that day. I only took that particular path because I wanted to avoid a crowd of tourists on the other one. And I met Mike, whom I hadn’t seen in years. I didn’t want to talk to him. I could have made an excuse; I could have gone away without stopping for coffee with him. And he told me about somebody else he knew who needed a flatmate.”
“It was fun, in a way. I felt challenged for the first time. I didn’t get much in the way of praise, but at least I knew I was doing well enough to fool people with my works, experts even. Of course, I was never involved with the business side of things. I hadn’t a clue how he went about selling the paintings. I knew his younger brother Karl was involved, but I’d only met him once or twice during my first couple of years in Norway. He passed through now and again, picking up the paintings. He usually came at odd hours, very late or very early.
There was a long, uncomfortable silence. Murdy glared at the ground, before abruptly kicking the upturned wheelbarrow. It clanged loudly, making John jump. He glanced nervously at the dimly lit house for signs of life, but there were none.
“Undoubtedly. He’s eating much this ghastly swill much faster than everyone else, probably hopes they will do the same. He’s wearing outdoor shoes.”
“Take these off.” Sherlock ordered impatiently, tugging on the hip of John’s pajama bottoms. John lifted his hips off the bunk and let Sherlock slip the cotton down his thighs. The waistband caught on his persistent erection and he huffed a laugh, turning so that he lay with his back pressed against Sherlock’s chest.
“Come along, Miss Antonelli.” Sherlock sighed. “It’s right in front of you. Never mind the motive, it will doubtlessly come down to either sex or money. It almost always does. Mrs. Duncan, though – why did she suffer the most, out of all the victims?”
The car came to a leisurely halt on the gravel drive of Hilderbogie house, and Mr. Brodie sat back in the drivers seat after turning off the engine. He looked in the rear view mirror with an inquiring expression, and cleared his throat meaningfully.
Mycroft strode in, a flurry of snowflakes sweeping into the hall over his shoulders. His face was blank, his eyes wide. He wore no coat over his usual three piece suit and his hands were bare, clenched and stiff at his sides. He glanced around the room fitfully, and once he spotted John and Violet standing on the landing above Mycroft immediately made for the wide stone stairs.
“Afternoon, all.” His heavily lined forehead creased even more impressively as he grinned around the kitchen; seeming a little puzzled at the sight of the uniformed officers at Violet’s table. “Just came to drop off your tickets for the ceilidh tonight. I’ve been clearing out the hall all morning, it’s shined up a treat and the musicians are already setting up...” he trailed off, catching sight of the wooden box and doll. “Hang on. What in the wide world is that doing here?”
He stared at her, a sick rolling sensation in his stomach. He knew what she was about to say, and couldn’t even begin to start processing it. Mary squared her shoulders, steeling herself to face his reaction.
He half expected that Sherlock would insist on bathing before getting into bed, given the grime and sweat that coated his skin. It was proof of his exhaustion that Sherlock merely nodded and let John help him out of the filthy remains of his clothes and into some soft, clean pajamas. John winced at the mottled bruising on Sherlock’s body, the cuts on his leg and behind his ear. He was no longer bleeding though, and John decided that proper first aid could probably wait for a while. He was probably in no fit state to provide Sherlock with medical care, either. He discarded his own clothes on the floor and climbed into bed after locking the Walther into the bedside drawer. He was relieved when Sherlock reached out for him immediately, pulling him close until they shared a pillow and they were pressed together from shoulder to hip. He was on the verge of a heavy sleep when he heard Sherlock swallow hard and whisper to him.
“Oh my god. You’ve just been waiting, all this time…” John said numbly. He abruptly felt sick, sick and angry at the realisation. “How can you be so fucking calm about this, Sherlock?! How can you tell me, calm as anything, that you’ve been expecting me to leave you to have a family with someone else?”
John had watched, unable to tear his eyes away. Sherlock was elsewhere, having fun berating the teenage kidnappers for their lack of finesse. Mr. Travers was surrounded by medics and several police officers; Lestrade was obviously hoping to get another statement from him before too long. But all Mr. Travers could see was his family. John could almost feel the relief and love radiating from that small group. Mrs. Travers was very obviously doing her best not to cry, but Mr. Travers had tears running freely down his face. It was apparent that he had thought he would never see his wife or sons again.
Without warning, Patrick seemed to vanish. John cursed quietly, speeding up and trying to figure out where he had last seen Patrick. He froze when he saw a figure outside an unlit Georgian church, but this turned out to be an odd bronze statue of a gentleman in eighteenth century dress. The statue seemed to have paused while walking downhill; John had mistaken the flare of the figures’ frock-coat for Patrick’s own sweeping overcoat.  The church looked firmly locked, but a graveyard opened out on either side; stretching behind until the many lopsided monuments vanished in the foggy murk. John sighed silently, wondering whether to continue downhill or to try his luck in the graveyard. Peering down the street he could make out no sign of movement whatsoever; the silence was deadly.
“Is it him?! Have you found him?” he yelled, flinging himself down to the rough pile of boulders where Mycroft stood. “Sherlock!”
“Tell your dad we’ll come and explain everything tomorrow. I’m sorry if you’re in a heap of trouble,” said Violet. “You’ve been beyond brilliant, the pair of you.”
His tone was as light and charming as ever; but as he met John’s eyes there was the faintest hint of a plea in their depths.
“Good morning, gentlemen.” he smiled, straightening up. “Whatever do you think Violet has found? She just knocked on my door and asked me to make my way downstairs as quick as I could, which is why I’m so untidy.”
“Eighteen customers were in the shop on the twenty second.” Sherlock said, after scanning the relevant page for less than a second. “Ogilvie; Swires; McIndoe; Brodie; Murchan; Mackie; Smith; Angus; Duncan; Jameson…”
Sherlock gave it a derisive look. “That’s it? It’s not exactly secure. I can think of at least five ways to get into this establishment without touching that paltry thing.”
He became aware of Sherlock, who had turned to look at him intently. Violet was fiddling with a heavy gold lighter, and John realised that he had been staring at her without taking in much of what she had been saying. “...a bit of a git towards Mr. McCreedy, I suspect. They would have run in to each other in the garden quite a lot, what with Garcia sleeping in the annexe. As for Margaret, I don’t really know why she would have a particular reason to suggest him. He really did seem to leave long before the trap was set, and nothing to suggest that he returned. The police are no doubt tracking him down if they haven’t done so already.”
“Oh, for fucks sake!” Violet snapped. “You’re a miserable excuse for an assassin if you have to stoop to this level of repartee. Get your bloody coat off. Your boots too, while you’re at it. Then you’re going to turn around with your hands up and come out here
“Not quite, you’re forgetting how early the sun goes down when you’re this far north. It’s only half four. I thought you’d want to see these, though.” he gestured at a large envelope on the table to his left.
“Now, the level of residual moisture is key,” she explained. “Too much and it’s pointless; anything you add to it will be hopelessly diluted. Too little and it’ll get hopelessly weighed down.”
her came into it.” Sherlock’s tone was approving. “She’s a very good photographer, so hopefully the pictures and the scene should suffice. She will insist on using film however, so she couldn’t email the photos to me immediately.”
Sherlock shrugged under the weight of her head on his shoulder. “No, not really. I mean, if I absolutely had to, I would do it with you. But I can’t imagine it. I’ve never really understood why people want to do it. I mean, I can tell that you’re very attractive.” he added, slightly apologetically.
He shoved the heavy woollen socks in the pocket of his purloined jacket, and shoved his pallid stiff feet into the boots; yanking the laces tight before pulling the knife from the unresisting fingers. He dropped that in the opposite pocket and stared around himself; taking in the greying skies and growing shadows. The glints of light reflecting against the granite boulders had ebbed away almost entirely, leaving a drab monochrome landscape. The temperature was dropping even more swiftly, and he swallowed hard as he took in the distance back up the slope; comparing it with the next high pass in the mountains. Stars appeared intermittently amidst the heavy clouds.
“Far too much dust resting in the fabric creases. Furthermore, the rip was clearly made with a sharp blade; not some careless accident. So: large pair of binoculars alongside deliberate hole in the window blinds. What do you conclude?”
He heard the sound of slamming doors and the crunch of Violet and Mycroft’s feet coming through the snow behind. Violet was pulling a thick fur hat over her ears as she made her way too them, taking in the situation at a glance. “Bugger.”
John looked down at the top of Sherlock’s head, which was a riot of soggy, messy curls. He kissed it after a moment, unable to find anything like the right words to say.
Mycroft’s shrewd eyes were a little wider than usual, his eyebrows raised slightly. His thin mouth was relaxed; not pursed fussily or smirking as it so often did. His attention was solely on Patrick, who was as sphinx-like as ever. They shared a long glance that seemed heavy with some hidden meaning. Weirdly, time almost seemed to have slowed as John watched the exchange of murmured greetings and shaking of hands. Could he be imagining this? Nobody else around them seemed to have noticed anything out of the ordinary.
“You’ll be Doctor Watson, I take it? Violet said that you and the detective were arriving today.” she had a broad Scots accent, but she was clearly not from Edinburgh.
And yet… Sherlock remembered how they had fallen asleep the night before. The solid, reassuring pressure of John leaning against his shoulder, meeting his eye in the age-spotted bathroom mirror as they brushed their teeth. His own tiredness, feeling raw, bruised, embarrassed [god so
-” he said the word with deepest disdain “-because my brother left London for Geneva this morning. One can only conclude that Patrick had been hoping to spend a cosy New Years Eve with Mycroft and has been left rather disappointed.”
“Well, I think it’s safe to say that Mycroft has changed his mind about escorting you off the premises tonight.”
Violet rubbed her ear in a faintly agitated manner. “You’re both utter darlings. You didn’t need to do this, I was going to call some people in. I just wanted to show these blots one of the paintings in the annexe.” she seemed a little lost for words.
“Gosh. Well, um. That’s good to know. We’ll make sure to turn down any cases that involve submarine travel.” John said, unsuccessfully trying to keep the grin from his face. “Or aquariums, obviously.”
“Too bloody right. Poor Mrs. Antonelli, she was pregnant for a good chunk of her adult life before she kicked the bucket.” Violet grimaced, and placed a stack of scones on Sherlocks’ plate. He cleared this throat and glared at her meaningfully until she sighed and added another two to the pile. “John, hurry up and get some of these before this greedy swine eats them all.”
At this point, Sherlock had stopped walking. They were around half way across the Millennium bridge, heading towards the market. It was a chilly, damp afternoon and the light was already fading from the sky. London seemed noisy, jarringly modern and a little frenetic compared to the refined outskirts of Edinburgh. They had been walking for twenty minutes, close but silent, both lost in their own thoughts.
Biceps stopped suddenly, turning his head at the noise of Patrick’s footsteps. In a split second, he had dropped Sherlock to the floor and had reached for his own weapon; concealed in a holster under his left arm. He advanced into the room without a word, leaving Sherlock gasping on the stone floor in pain and horror. He only dimly heard the gunshot, but the noise seemed to echo around his head endlessly, rolling and reverberating like a dropped coin. [No. No. NO.]
John cleared his throat meaningfully and gave Sherlock a hard stare. “You’re cooking me dinner, you berk. Even if it’s only just the once.”
Pale broad beams of light were edging their way through the narrow windows of the stone staircase as Violet led John towards the library. It was on on the top floor of Hilderbogie and he hadn’t visited this level of the building before. He looked around with interest – somehow the top floor seemed to speak strongly of Violet’s character. Unlike the stern portraits that lined the walls downstairs, there were several large modern paintings hanging in the corridor, their blurred shapes and hard lines catching his eye irresistibly. He paused at one that hung over a low gilt and marble table and frowned at the canvas; a rocky seascape, overhung with stormy skies. There were indistinct figures in the foreground, almost lost among the long tangled grass of a cliff. There was something unmistakeably dark about the mood, in the way that the teal waves seethed and the light filtered through low hanging clouds.
John nods and straightens up. He clears his throat and his voice is fairly measured when he starts talking. He has to close his eyes after a moment though, it’s not possible to go through this with Sherlock’s eyes boring into him from a couple of feet away. And yet when he does close his eyes he’s immediately transported back to the chalky dry earth and shards of hot metal on the ground beneath his back. The hard enamel blue of the sky pressing down on him. The sheer, exhilarating shock and terror of it; the pain still distant, behind the overwhelming sense of bodily intrusion. The rapid creeping flow of blood, sticky and slick as it soaked into his fatigues. In between the hammer of gunfire he could hear the screaming of birds, his clouding eyes tracing jet trails in the sky. His absolute fury when he felt hands dragging him away, making the pain explode and taking away his chance of death under the clean sun.
“You can’t let him be the most important thing in your life, Sherlock.” John said quietly, leaning back against the tree and wrapping his hands more securely round his cup. He seemed unwilling to look up into Sherlock’s impatient, expectant face. “Just… please. Don’t.”
Or at least he did when he left. He wasn’t sure if he’d paid the rent this month, and he made a point of not opening official looking envelopes with little windows in them. Even the ones with large red letters stamped across them. They were so terribly boring.
Anthea slipped into the seat at the end of the table, helping herself to large helpings from several of the steaming bowls and Tupperware containers that Violet had produced from the depths of the huge ancient fridge.
“Hetty Ogilvie is six.” Murdy pointed out. “And Olive Murchan only has one arm; I reckon it’d be difficult for her to poison the bottles in a hurry.”
Mycroft said nothing, merely looked at Sherlock with a careworn and slightly disappointed expression. John cleared his throat and edged forward.
“Violet Vernet.” she murmured, absently running a hand through her dishevelled hair. Lestrade followed the movement with a kind of fascinated interest as her heavy red curls escaped the last couple of pins. “
“Now, George. Might I suggest that we take a stroll upstairs?” John said with a half-hearted attempt at affability. It didn’t seem to ring true with either of them, and George looked at him appraisingly.
“Yes, well done. That is because it is my coffee and I do not take sugar.” John managed to signal to a bemused looking carriage attendant to bring more coffee, before taking his cup back from Sherlock. Travelling first class on trains had its advantages; John didn’t even tell Sherlock off for using Mycroft’s civil service pass to get them an upgrade. “So are you going to tell me anything about the case?”
Mycroft turned and glanced up at him coolly, then swivelled in his seat to catch sight of Violet and Sherlock who were waiting impatiently for him at the door. His brow furrowed a little when he saw that they were still carelessly hand-in-hand.
Violet’s hand twitched, as though she wanted to reach out to Sherlock despite the fact that he was well out of reach where he sat. Her watched as her lower lip trembled minutely, and she bit down on it savagely. He knew she’d never forgive herself for crying in front of Mycroft.
“What do you think he’s really up to?” John asked, as they hesitated behind a tall privet hedge to allow Patrick to cross the street a little way ahead.
And as the music started, John suddenly thought of that awkward afternoon behind closed curtains, years before. Sherlock leading him through the steps of the waltz in a distant, nonchalant fashion. Pretending that it was just another task he had taken on for planning the wedding. John had been grumpy and embarrassed about the whole thing, and had even snapped at Sherlock once or twice when he repeatedly got the steps wrong. He suddenly wondered what had really been going through the mans mind at the time. They were still aching a little from Sherlock’s sudden return; even before John had consciously started
Mycroft. It was your grandfather’s idea. We planned it out, together. He… he felt bad about the collections, in his later years. He told me that he’d always meant to try and return at least some of them but he hadn’t known where to start. The estate had taken up so much of his time, and his health had been failing for so long. He had put it off, year after year. The task had just gotten more impossible, the longer he left it. And he knew that I didn’t have a plan, not really. He didn’t want me to end up spending my life in the wilds of Aberdeenshire, running the estate. Because at that time, it was tempting to stay. To hide.” She dragged her fingers through her hair distractedly, looking a little ashamed. “I had been a beautiful girl, and I knew it. I used it. It was hard- I mean, it took me a while to get used to how different I looked. And James knew it, too. I think it was one of the reasons he suggested it, really. Returning the collections would force me to go back out into the world. To travel, to face strangers and crowds, to prove myself without the advantage of my looks.
What he felt for Sherlock – well, no matter the parameters of it, on some level he’d known he was loved by the man. It had been frequently infuriating, stressful, and occasionally hurtful. But even during the worst of times, he’d always felt needed.
“No idea. But we’re going to follow him the next time, and find out.” Sherlock said gleefully. There was a brief knock on the door.
Murdy sidled up to her father, who performed a double take at her short hair and elegant dress. What they said to each other was inaudible, but Murdy slipped her thin hand into the one her father offered, and leant briefly against his shoulder as they watched their family dance.
“Not right now you don’t. Believe me though, you will thank me for this someday. Also, you really do need to take atmospheric conditions into account. A day like today requires extra time and preparation due to humidity levels. Right, give me an estimate. How much time has passed since total saturation?”
He jumped violently when a hesitant hand touched his shoulder, startled out of the vicious spiral of his thoughts. The flimsy scrap of paper fluttered to the stone floor, and came to rest between his feet.
She looked at him shrewdly, and he was quite sure that she was reading every thought that was going through his mind. She was still smiling however, and John suspected that this was something she must go through every time she met someone new.
Violet frowned, seeming slightly surprised at John not knowing this. “Well yes, certainly. Almost right after Sherry and I were married, when he was eighteen. He came up and stayed with us most of the holidays, and turned up the odd time when he was probably meant to be studying. I was always glad to have him, though – it’s a very quiet place up there. I was surprised at first that he was happy to be way out in the country with us, but he liked it. The library had really quite a good collection of metallurgical works, and we had a great time going through some sixteenth century alchemical treatises.”
Sherlock was pressed up against John at the extreme end of the gap between the shed and the wall. He sighed gently, his breath ruffling John’s hair. “For pity’s sake, who are these idiots? They couldn’t organise a decent beating if they had a full committee and a month to plan it in.” he breathed into John’s ear. He looked down at John, his face nothing but angles and shadows and a pair of eyes gleaming with excitement.
John didn’t bother asking how he knew; he wasn’t in the mood for startling deductions just yet. “And the whole, you know, killer for hire thing,” he added with what he hoped was a spot of bravado. It failed miserably, and Sherlock’s eyes remained on his.
“I am indeed a busy man!” Mr. Brodie replied, getting to his feet with a sigh. “I’d better be off. Do let me know if you need anything from town, Violet – it’s no trouble.”
He forced himself to stop momentarily, to drink some water and to take several measured breaths; trying to ignore his hammering heart. He was nearly at the end of the allotted twenty minutes and it would soon be time to turn back again, to find Mycroft once more. Perhaps Mycroft was even now sitting at Sherlock’s side, chafing his hands and berating him for his foolishness in wandering into the wilderness alone.

That night they had gone to bed in Sherlock’s room, as they had done the night before following their return from Edinburgh. The deep blue sheets were still disordered and John retrieved one of the pillows that had been carelessly kicked onto the dark wooden floor. He watched out of the corner of his eye as Sherlock changed into a loose pair of grey pajama bottoms, dropping his clothes carelessly onto the floor.
Margaret appeared from the cloakroom, and stood in the narrow doorway. She folded her arms and watched Hilary impassively, with the air of a bouncer making sure that a troublemaker was vacating the premises. John felt rather awkward. Some small part of him still pitied her in a way, and something in the way she held herself made him wonder if she was on the verge of crying or shouting. He was on the verge of saying something, although he wasn’t quite sure what, when he heard another set of footsteps coming down the stairs.
He had slipped his own fingers deep inside Sherlock several times as he sucked his cock, grazing the swollen nub of his prostate until the detective thrashed and cried out, pulsing hot and wet into his throat.
“Why can’t you be here?” Sherlock murmured quietly, the room darkening and blurring until all he could feel was the pressure of John’s arms around him.
A definite pattern. Another returning brother, taking over operations. Seeking vengeance for Sherlock’s interference. Sending his son on a mission, instructing him to bring Sherlock back.
He felt Sherlock’s prominent knuckles kneading gently at the skin there, and he felt almost panicked by the increased rush of arousal it brought on.
