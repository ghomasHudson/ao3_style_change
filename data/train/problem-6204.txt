Taking the steps at a near run, Steve was so focused on just getting out of this place and getting to Tony and somehow figuring out what to say to him, that when he hit the first flight of stairs above the building’s doors, he almost knocked into a man who was coming up the stairs.
--by his pseudo-Uncle to steal the piece of tech embedded in his chest that keeps him alive, then saved by his stripper husband, his best friend and a one-armed man, I have to say, this,” Tony said, pointing at Fury and the two other interlopers, “is really weirding me out. Spill, One-Eyed Willie. What’s up with you and the Spy Kids there?”
!  The head of Tony’s cock hit something deep inside him and Steve flew apart. That was the only way he could think of it.  Pleasure sizzled from the inside out, burning through his skin until his whole body was thrumming with it.
“Whoa, ah.  Wow, okay, well,” the voice chuckled, low and warm, and surprisingly clear, though he couldn’t think of any of their neighbors who sounded remotely like that.  Young, he thought.  Not a kid like him though, but not old like his dad kind of old.  “I’m currently in…let’s say a barn.  I’m using a Gatlin handie-talkie.  Neat thing the boys back home thought up.  Can’t believe they got a wireless I can carry around.   My buddy says I’m probably going to poke someone’s eye out with the antenna, but even he has to admit it’s pretty swell.  Don’t know about a…what did you call it? Amplifier?  The range is pretty limited, depending on the terrain we’re in, but it’s mostly, ah…fields out here.  Oh, and I’m Steve, by the way.  Nice to hear a friendly voice, Tony.”
taking it slow.  You don’t want to go be a part of his world, and I get why, I do, Stevie, I do.  I’m not saying something like that’s easy.  Not for guys like you an’ me.   Hell, look at me and Nat.  You think that was fun, meeting her folks?  Me, with my one good arm, extremely-useful-in-the-real-world gunner skills and a disability pension that won’t pay half a month’s rent in this city?” Barnes demanded.
“So,” Tony began, bracing his hands on the desk and slowing pushing himself up as he leaned over the desk for balance, and okay, well, that position wasn’t even
Steve’s eyes flashed down to Tony’s hole, then back up at him, gaze going hard, jaw tightening, and there was a sense of something building there, maybe a change in the air or his scent, Tony didn’t know. Some primal part of his brain knew, though. Recognized it, wanted it, craved it.  Tony swallowed past the sudden lump in the back of his throat and reached out, taking the hard length in his hand.
It was taking a long time, actually.  Tony shifted his knees a bit on the flat cushion.  Maybe they should’ve tried for the bed after all.
“You’re prettier when you’re quiet,” the King remarked, almost idly, then leaned back over the table and picked up the quill.  “The arch is too low for the crossbowman.  Need to keep the weight down so the damn thing rolls,
“Well, you’re going to love what they’ve done with the place,” Tony assured him as they walked up the steps to the front doors.  A small, wiry man in a tweed suit waited for them, a wide grin splitting his face as he greeted them, shaking both their hands with profuse enthusiasm.  They followed the man inside, the door echoing through the large, empty entrance hall as it closed.
“You didn’t know.  This isn’t on you, Tony,” Steve argued.
Steve looked at the boy’s eager, hopeful face, flattened his mouth and gave a small nod before looking away.  The day was going to be difficult enough on the boy without adding to it.
“You will be in a moment,” Tony laughed, grinning fondly down at him. Steve shook his head, though Tony only sighed and eyed him dubiously.  He finally disentangled himself long enough to get up and return with a cloth to wipe Steve and the bed as best he could, and a soft, silken nightrobe that he helped Steve struggle to get into. It was harder than it should have been, Steve thought, as if his limbs had yet to remember how to work properly.   Tony snuffed the torches, and took off the rest of his clothes, climbing into bed next to Steve.  He wrapped an arm around Steve’s stomach and kissed the top of Steve’s shoulder.  “Sleep now, my treasure.”
“Steve,” Tony husked out, sounding like he was the one in pain.
He had a chance. A slim one, but a chance.
“This is where you thank me, tell me how incredibly generous I am, and then try to subtly wheedle something more from me,” the King added after a long beat of silence, an air of exasperation in his voice.
“What nonsense is this? Beautiful abstractions.  I love them all, and I am surely the best judge of these things. Ask anyone, and they shall tell you this is true,” Tony said with an exaggeratedly confused frown and a twinkle in his eye.  “Besides, I’ve heard not a single word of criticism of them. Only that I have discovered who will surely become the finest sculptor in the land if only I continue to employ Master Len indefinitely so as to groom such talent,” Tony added, mouth lifting into a wickedly pleased grin that he tossed Steve’s way. His gaze softened then and his smile went loose, eyes crinkling at their corners.  He stopped and took Steve’s hand, bringing it up to brush his lips across the backs of Steve’s knuckles, his warm breath prickling the skin up and down Steve’s arm. “You really are talented, my treasure.  I would love anything made from your hands and mind, that is true, but my newly installed Lady Chamberlain insists I play patron for enough artists and Enclaves that I can’t help but know a little of it.  You are learning, yes, but there is talent there.  I can see it as plainly as Master Len can.  His enthusiasm is not entirely self-serving, you know.”
Tony huffed and nodded jerkily.  “Well, I guess I’m calling it a night.  You should sleep.  You look….exhausted.”
“Did you ask Zola—“ Steve started.
Tony tossed the collar aside to one of the chairs, his eyes never leaving Steve.  They made it to the bed in a tangle of limbs and mouths. It was like they couldn’t get enough of each other.  Tony’s hands seemed to be everywhere at once, lighting a fire under Steve’s skin, and yet, Tony’s touch was almost reverent.  Worshipful. Steve felt adored, and reveled in it, trying to return the feeling, the awe he always felt that someone like Tony would feel this way about someone like him.
“Race cars are serious.  Steve likes my ties. Tell her, Steve,” Tony urged.
It was hard to remember why he wanted that, but, he thought, glancing over his shoulder at the tiny island, this was no place to spend the rest of his days, however many those may be, and he thought Shellhead knew that.  At times, it felt like Shellhead understood that even more than Steve did.
Steve stared at the dark shape, then looked away, towards the windows, where the circle of silver moon filled the glass.
“Eh, no, none of that. Come on now, up with you,” the King said quickly.  “Well, not up.  More like, down, but over here.  I need you to reach—yes, there, can you feel in the gear?  There should be a small, interlocking cross-piece that is, rather determinedly, not interlocking.  I need you to push it through this opening here, see?  And then we’re going to add a bolt and mortis it into the side piece, like…this.  Good,” the King said.  “Excellent.  Hold it there.  Now…don’t move it,” the King said. He got down on his hands and knees next to Cam, and a moment later sprung up with a grin.  “Outstanding.  Good lad.  You did very well,” he said, patting Cam lightly on the back as he pushed himself up and walked back over to sit down at his work table.  “Eh, don’t go anywhere just yet, Small Hands.  Come over here.”
“That I was played the fool and wiser and far more careful for it,” Tony replied.  “That I was young and infatuated with someone who acted a certain part, and that I did not…” he paused, stilling his hand for a moment on Steve’s back before going back to his ministrations.  “That I did not know what it would feel like to actually love someone who was worthy of it.  My parents were certainly no fine example of it.  A political marriage.  Unhappy for both of them, it turned out, though they got along well enough towards the end and spent a good decade ignoring the worst of each other.  The harem is full of sharp tongues who will gladly bend your ear for hours over all the details, I am sure, but suffice to say, what I thought I wanted and what it turns out that I want are more different than I could have imagined.”
“Bullshit,” Rhodes said.  “I know that, because they didn’t.  How many people had to know, or at least have some inkling?  No one talked.  Fear, reward, whatever their reason, they held their tongues, but
“About what?  About how much of an idiot I am for getting played like this?  You could’ve said something, you know.  You could’ve cut the whole thing off.  Made up some excuse.  Sick grandma, whatever, you could’ve stopped this.  Instead, you—you pretended to—” Tony broke off, glancing away as a lance of cold hurt twisted his stomach.
good, all in all. He’d been happy, the team was working like a finely-oiled machine—even growing here and there—and he had a home here. A place. A family, of sorts, as strange as they were.
the political capital to spare, particularly after all this is over, so why not?” Tony finished.
“Hmmm,” Fury shook his head and glanced away.  “I hear you’re headed off to MIT. Some special Omega thing,” Fury said.  “My techs upstairs won’t shut up about you.  Army.  LIGO.”
“Oh, God,” Tony half laughed, half groaned, though his smile was clearly amused.  “I should not love your innocence as much as I do,” he said, reaching out his hand to stroke the side of Steve’s cheek, quick and light, though just that one touch was enough to send a flood of calming warmth down Steve’s spine to pool in his stomach. Tony’s hand settled on Steve’s chest again, making slow swirls in the line from the hollow of Steve’s throat down his breastbone. “Would you like that?” Tony asked, seeming to pause to consider the idea.  “Sparring, I mean?  I usually practice with Rhodey, but there is no reason you and I could not spend a few mornings in the gymnasium, if you wished it.  Though, fair warning, I have practiced with the finest knights since I was a boy.  Father’s insistence.  Not that I would hurt you, of course.  You have my word.”
“Twenty-seven,” Steve mumbled into the bed.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. “The stars are nice tonight.”
“I know none of this with me was exactly part of your plan,” Steve said.
“I know,” Tony said.
Tony shook his head and walked closer to the circle.  He lay a hand on one of the rocks, pulling a leaf off a vine that had snaked into one of the crevices.  “Exaggerated, I’m sure,” he said, glancing back at Steve.
“Only because they’re scared of you,” Tony argued weakly.  He looked out the window towards the physics building.  A tall, thin man with wispy, graying hair and glasses was coming down the steps, tugging a blue blazer on over a tan polo shirt as he went.
“You really have changed, haven’t you?” Obie said.
The meeting went well, or he assumed it did.  He didn’t pay an iota of attention to what was happening.  He signed stuff Pepper put in front of him without looking at it, to her ever increasing exasperation.  “Oh, just go,” she finally implored him.  He didn’t need to be told twice.
“I do like the car.  I do.  Really,” Tony responded dully.
He didn’t want to come to the store with Steve, that was for sure, not that Steve had really expected him to jump at the offer. Maybe Tony wanted to go shopping alone.  Most of the Bonded Omegas in the store were by themselves, not that he had looked at them, of course, that would be rude, but he knew.   This was all so new for Tony, though, he might not be comfortable out on his own, or at least Steve had thought that sounded like a reasonable reason to accompany Tony.  Or have Tony accompany him.  Except, Tony hadn’t wanted to go with him. Tony wanted to stay in his garage with his robots.
He sucked in a breath of cool night air and let it out again in a long, low hiss.  Maybe they could try Ghostbusters next.  Thanks to Steve’s Paul Bunyan impersonation, they had enough firewood to actually roast Mr. Stay Puft himself, but Tony would settle for s’mores.  Steve would like that one.  It would make him laugh, really laugh, that deep, full-throated laugh where he tossed his head back and threw a hand over his heart like he was intending to say the Pledge, but got overcome by hysteria instead.  Tony loved it, probably because on the rare occasions he got to hear it, it was always followed by a sense of accomplishment, like he’d cracked some kind of enigma code.  Stupid brain chemistry getting fucked up over his Alpha laughing, that’s what it was.  That was all it was.
But...it was something. Something real. To help.  Steve did a lot of things that were supposed to help these days, but helping the way SHIELD did it seemed like some kind of vague, nebulous concept that might come to fruition at some distant point in the future.  This was, at least, something real.
“You’re the only hostage to ever walk away from the Ten Rings, Mr. Stark.  It would be a hell of a cover story, and certainly would throw suspicion off of you, maybe point it in some other direction, especially when your boyfriend walks up to a checkpoint with nearly your exact coordinates just in the nick of time,” a reporter with an MSNBC lanyard pointed out from the front row.
“I—it’s…” Jarvis started, then stopped and cleared his throat, lifting his chin to look directly at Peggy.  “He promised.  He promised it wouldn’t happen again.  Tony said it was just the one time.  Just the one. And I believed him.  I
They got the boat into the water with no small amount of effort, loaded down as it was with supplies.  Steve pushed and Shellhead pulled, using those powerful tentacles of his to latch on and tug it through the sand.  Steve hopped in as soon as the water hit his thighs and started to row with the mismatched oars while Shellhead pushed the boat through the waves.
“What?” Steve burst out.  “Is that a…real thing?”
“That’s it!  Right, right, with the whole adventurer on a quest to find the long-lost hero thing. Bet that would’ve been a real seat-filler,” Stane said, as if just remembering, though it was far too calculated for that, and Howard, Howard with his drinking and his detachment, couldn’t see it, but this was it.  This was when Stane decided it was Tony he would hitch his wagon to.  Tony, who would supplant Howard, and far sooner than any of them, except maybe Stane—and, well, maybe Howard, too, maybe that was some of it—could see. Tony, who did something extraordinary, something terrifyingly extraordinary, at ten, and only barely knew that his whole life had shifted and turned, because this man had found his new golden goose.
“I don’t want to lose him,” Steve replied quietly.
Goddamned clusterfuck of a roadmap to happiness, is what that was.
of it. Dude, really, not everything has to be verbalized—and go talk to your maybe-husband,” Rhodey said, punctuating his words with a sharp nod.
“My speed, as you put it, is your speed, in case you hadn’t noticed,” Tony replied, edging closer to Steve.  “I had fun, too, you know.  Always did.  You and me and whatever…stragglers you’d bring home.  It was always, I don’t know…just always felt like I couldn’t wait to see what would happen next, you know?”
“That’s…Little Caesar’s,” Steve huffed out.  “And you know that.”
I'm so sorry for the long delay between chapters!  Vacation and real life this summer has been kicking my ass, but I will finish this, I promise!  This chapter was a lot of fun to write.  I love their banter.  It is almost entirely talking, which is actually really tough to write that much dialogue.  Hope you enjoy, and get a better idea where they are coming from.
“Excuse me, Sirs,” JARVIS intoned as evenly as he could probably be managed under the circumstances.  “Director Fury has arrived for the debriefing.  The team is gathering in the conference room.  Your presence is requested.  I am to tell you that you can be assured that the bubble will be respected and it shall not be necessary invoke Rule Number Four, which, despite this representation from Mister Barton, I feel compelled to inform you, would violate the Geneva Convention if ever utilized.”
“That is…entirely a complete coincidence and has nothing whatsoever to do with my name,” Kirk said in a careful, clipped tone that held an undercurrent of abashed amusement.  He’d probably been teased about that his whole life, Steve figured.
“Are you done?” Coulson asked from his place next to Tony’s right shoulder.
That’s why
“Well, it is rather late, and any mother would be worried about her only son.  Besides, it’s too dangerous at night for even you to be running around the rocks slaying dragons, don’t you think?” the man pointed out.
“You could be I Swear I’ll Never Even Think It,” Jim said smoothly.  “He rolled his eyes.  Is that okay?”
“That we’re so glad to have you home,” Ana finished for him.  “Was it still snowing at your school?  Your letter said you got snow.  I do miss snow in winter.  The most we get here is that stuff they spray on the shop windows,” she said with a note of despair.
“I don’t even know what I was thinking.  I never should have involved you in any of this.  Pepper will get you a check and—“ Tony started.
“Natasha?” Barnes said in surprise.
Tony almost dropped his phone when it buzzed.  The red message bubble appeared in the corner of the app.  He stared down at it for a moment, then grinned and let out a whoop and pumped his fist in the air.  “It worked!”
Two bus changes later, he hopped off a couple of blocks from the apartment building and walked the rest of the way home.  He wasn’t quite ready to go inside and deal with stacks of clothes just yet, so he took the steps to the top floor, then out the heavy door that led to the roof.  He carefully propped it open with the cinderblock they used for that purpose after Clint had locked himself on the roof one night and had to climb down the fire escape and knock on Bucky’s window to be let in.  Which had not gone especially well, seeing as how Bucky had not been alone that particular evening.
No matter how many things he built from his father’s cast-offs or how many online courses he took, ultimately, he was going to service an Alpha his father chose for him and--hey, look at the happy Omega on the pamphlet—absolutely love existing to be a vessel to take an Alpha’s knot.  Sure, that sounds concerning, right?  Oh, no worries though.  Apparently, his body would cheerfully help him not give a fuck about anything else and dulling his mind until he didn’t care about anything but rutting with some big Alpha cock.
“Look,” Steve said, lifting his eyes long enough to catch Tony’s confused gaze in the mirror.  “Look at yourself.  Look at how beautiful you are.  You’re amazing, Tony,” Steve continued, flattening his chest to Tony’s back.  “Do you feel how much I want you?  You haven’t even touched me yet.”
“I—they don’t—I mean, I can’t—no Omegas, and all that—“ Tony stammered, trying to catch his breath.  “I can’t actually
problem.  The shimmy had been a symptom, most likely, though the good news was that Tony didn’t think he was going to survive long enough to get to engage in his usual round of self-recrimination for failing to take that as the warning it apparently had been.
It wasn’t that the memories were all bad.  Gabe, Falsworth, Jim, Dernier and Timothy, or DumDum, as everyone called him, sitting around a mud-soaked tent, singing, laughing, or hurling insults at each other, and being the most efficient team of soldiers in battle that Steve could have imagined--that was a good memory.   Even Bucky, even with how much losing him still ate away at Steve sometimes at night when he couldn’t sleep, it was good to hear her talk about him, so present and real, like it was happening.  Like he might just walk in at any moment.
Steve hated himself sometimes.
“Oh,” Tony said numbly.  His mind flashed to the robin’s egg blue boxes that arrived on each of his mother’s birthdays, with their brightly-colored little escape hatches nestled inside.  A part of him didn’t want this piece of understanding to slot itself into a place in his mind.  It was easier to simply lump her in with Howard, call it the past and leave it there, as if she was something he could slough off if he kept on walking far enough away not to hear her anymore.  There were too many nights of piano music ringing in his ears underneath the whoosh of air and slap of leather on skin.  He wasn’t ready to stop walking, not yet, but he could look back.  For Jarvis, if for no other reason.
Really, that should’ve been Tony’s first clue.  Steve moved fast and suddenly that the only warning was the bunching of muscles against Tony’s calves just beforehand.  It should have been awkward and jarring.  Painful, even, maybe.  But, Steve was Steve, so when he grabbed Tony by the waist and flipped him over onto the bed underneath him in one swift motion, Tony only managed an undignified yelp before his face was pressed into the cool sheet, Steve driving into him from behind with one hand on Tony’s left hip and the other cupping the back of his neck.
“I know, I’m going to change my mind.   We’re different people.  I’ll thank you for being a giant, stubborn ass later. Other things I’m ignoring.  Blah, blah, blah.  Run along, now, dear, you have work tomorrow,” Tony tutted.
“You—I didn’t, ah.  I didn’t realize you were so involved,” Steve said carefully, because, of course, Stark
“Then, what…” Steve began, voice trailing off as he frowned, still trying to shake the image of Tony spread eagled on the bed loose from his mind.  “But you enjoyed it. What she did to you? At least in the beginning. You—you liked that?” Steve asked, his mind a swirl of curiosity, repulsion and arousal.  He wasn’t sure what to think. Tony had said things, sure, but Steve hadn’t really put much stock into any of it, other than that Tony enjoyed a breadth of experience that was somewhat daunting.
“I don’t want this to be his life, either,” Tony began.  “You have no idea.  Or, well.  Maybe you do, I don’t know.  I’m saying…maybe this whole pretending thing he and I are doing…maybe it isn’t so much of a stretch for me, either,” Tony offered quietly.
“No fucking kidding,” Barnes shot back. “He makes lists.  Helps him keep his thoughts organized, so they don’t get away from him, turn into something else or whatever.  Sam—he works down at the VA on weekends—he got him doing it.  Always with the lists, you know?  Used to drive me crazy.  Lists, fucking everywhere.  Now…now, I just let him.  Whatever, right?  We’ve got hundreds of them, all over the place.  Boxes under his bed, in the silverware drawer, in the freezer.  We don’t get rid of the lists.  God, no.  We gotta keep the lists.  He doesn’t sleep right.  Nightmares.  Shit, I don’t know anymore.  He won’t talk about it,” Barnes said with a frustrated sigh, waving his hand in the air towards the bedroom door. “Not with me.  He needs someone who—who can fucking do
“Yeah, that was…what?  Late 1800’s, or so…right on up until the middle of World War II,” Tony recalled.  “Last lab was down in Long Island, by the shore. Kept trying to get his wireless energy thing going on a large enough scale to be useful.  Speaking of, ah, labs,” Tony said, because he could meet Steve halfway, at the very least.  “If you wanted to come meet the ‘bots, I was going to work on them some later.  They’re not really—I’m still tweaking, you know, so.  Don’t expect much.  DUM-E is still useless, and U wants to be a water bender or some shit, but.  If you wanted, I’m just saying.”
Tony spared a glance for Steve and Bucky, then turned to Rhodes. “Let it be done,” he ordered, and Rhodes nodded, then gave a sharp whistle that cut through the air like a blade and waved his hand in the air in what was apparently a signal.  The battalion of soldiers who had trailed behind him began making their way down through the town to the beach, where they began gathering the large rocks and stones that littered the sand.  They carried them up the small hill and began the arduous task of stacking them over the grave, one by one.
“Of course, I meant it, Tony,” Steve told him.  “Maybe you found a purpose or learned something about yourself, I don’t know, but the man who went into that cave is the same one who came out.  This is who you are. This is who you’ve always been. And I’d have figured it out back then if I could’ve gotten my head out of my ass long enough to give you a chance.”
“You better fucking hear me!” Brock roared, his face shoved up to Steve’s, breath hot on Steve’s cheek.  “I am not going to be played for a fool here, Steve.  That is not going to happen.  Do you get that?  That is not how this is going to go.
It had been too fast, that first time, over far too quickly, though he had come, bent over the workstation, staring at the specs for the new Quinjet and one of those ball bearing desk toys rattling back and forth with each of Steve's thrusts.  Steve had apologized, managing to look both horrified and like the world’s most attractive kicked puppy at the same time.  Tony had just patted him on the shoulder and told him it was probably bound to happen, lots of pent up energy, not to worry about it.  He honestly had not planned on it ever becoming habit after that, but somehow, it did.
He could pretend no time had passed. Nothing had happened. Except this stranger must have liked what went on in here last time, enough to come back and enough to–to do
?   Uh...you, take me,” Tony pointed at himself, “back to Earth, yeah?” he asked, gesturing towards the wide window of stars and making a sort of semi-triangular shape with his hand that he used to cut through the air in front of him with a zooming sound that the alien’s eyes tracked.  “Home. I go home. Deal?”
“That’s not…Mr. Stark, that’s not what we were—the rollout has to go slowly, you have to understand,” Estes balked.  “These things take time.  Negotiations are complicated, you know that.”
“If you fucking apologize for that again, I really will scream,” Tony said.  “Holy shit,” he said again, then beamed at Steve, touching two of his fingers lightly to his mouth.  Steve didn’t think he even realized he was doing it. “Okay, so, you definitely kept your side of the bargain. Definitely.  Ah. So. Yeah. The plans,” he said, clearing his throat and looking over at the window for a moment. Steve watched his throat work, saw his shoulders straighten as he sucked in a bracing breath.
“Goodnight, Tony,” Steve replied.
And a coffee maker.
When the class finally ended, Steve carefully shut the laptop and handed it to Tony.
Cam tossed his hands up at Steve’s silence and sank back against the carriage’s plush seat with a disgruntled sigh, then leaned forward and pushed the curtain aside, peering out again.  Steve watched him wave out the window with a sort of dim enthusiasm, then reach into the small bag that sat in his lap and come out with a handful of coins. He tossed the few remaining coins out the window as the carriage trundled past a line of peasant children with their hands outstretched, laughing and screaming in delight as they chased the royal procession down the road.
to know.
Maybe his sudden awareness was because Steve had clearly gone to some trouble.  He was wearing slate gray slacks that fit him like he’d made a deal with the Devil, and a dark indigo shirt and matching tie that made his eyes seem an impossible shade of blue.
He hadn’t realized how much he wanted something with Steve until it was gone.  Just like that. Snapped up by some past mistake he was still paying the price for.  This time, that price was Steve, apparently.  Steve’s blue-tinged grin and earnest insistence that what happened wasn’t Tony’s fault flickered across his mind, like images on an old film, flat and broken.
Tony started to step away, then stopped and stood back, leaning over and placing a hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “If it is too much…if you need me to stop, you will tell me,” Tony said.  “That night with the chains, I worried I pushed you too far and you weren’t ready, but you did so well. But this—you must promise to tell me if it is too much.”
“I’ll…put lightbulbs on the list,” Steve said, though Barnes just closed his eyes for a moment and shook his head before sinking down into a threadbare brown tweed chair in front of an old box television that was perched somewhat precariously on top of a fold-out TV tray.  “Here,” Steve said, sweeping a hand over the room’s other chair and dumping the bags and dirty clothes that had occupied it onto the floor.  It was that or a sofa that looked like one of the cushions had been partially eaten, though it appeared someone had been using it for a bed, which probably shouldn’t have buoyed Tony’s spirits as much as it did. Tony had the words ‘I’ll stand,’ on his lips when he happened to glance over at Barnes and noted the wry, challenging expression on the man’s face.  He sat.
“There’s really no reason for us to do this. We could just stay here at the Tower, anyway,” Steve said with a sigh.
Brock launched into a description of plans that Steve didn’t pay enough attention to in order to really be able to follow it.  Brock always had plans.  Big plans, which often seemed to Steve to hinge on him not having to do a whole lot to earn the money he seemed to think was out there, though, if Brock really could make that kind of money without working all that hard for it, more power to him.
“Oh, good Lord,” Jarvis huffed under his breath, rolling his eyes.   “Captain—Steve—may I be of assistance with lunch preparations while Tony obtains his mug?”
“I—yes. Yes,” Steve replied with more certainty.  He could feel his face heating on the admission.
“Speaking as someone who knows a bit about locked workshops and things we don’t talk about with others,” Tony began, clearing his throat and glancing down at the parking lot where the car stood out like a blinking, neon Steal Me Please sign.  “Help isn’t judgment, Steve.  I’m not offering because you’re doing a terrible job here or something.  I’m offering because I can.  Because I want to.  Because I like doing something that means something.  Maybe you know a little about that?  Maybe that kind of resonates, just, I don’t know, a tad?  See, the guy who listened to my crazy spiel in the back of a limo after we busted out of a police station, and said, ‘Sure, I’m in’?  That guy could’ve told me it was my problem, get stuffed, you know? But, you didn’t.  You didn’t, and by all rights, you should have, because God knows---God knows, I did more to get myself into this mess than you did to get into yours, so—so I’m saying, I’m not judging, okay? Judgment-free zone.  Got it?”
Tony was mid-motion to trying to quiet his steps and make it back inside before Steve noticed (caught) him when he heard Steve's voice.
Tony twisted his head away to look out the window again, wincing at the movement.  Damn. Everything was sore once he stopped walking.  He reached up and wrapped his hand around the dog tags, rubbing the pad of one finger over the raised letters and numbers that spelled out Steve’s name.  “Well.  They shouldn’t have touched me.”
Bucky Barnes leaning against the front of a tank with a sniper rifle resting in his lap like a cat and a cigarette in one hand, mouth slightly parted like he was caught in the middle of saying something. Steve said it was probably something directed at whatever stupid thing he was getting them into, but he never went further than that, as if he didn’t remember, though Tony knew he remembered that moment perfectly and knew exactly what Barnes had been saying.  The war, Barnes, Peggy, the Commandos, they belonged to Steve, though, and Tony let him have those things, until Steve was ready to part with them, in bits and pieces over the years.
“I’m fine,” Steve assured him when Tony didn’t look quite convinced.  “Really. A little sore, I guess, but…” Steve trailed off with a small frown.
The armor didn’t allow just the groin piece to come off.  In retrospect, a glaring design flaw that he should really remedy as soon as possible.  Which meant they needed to get back to the Tower.  The team could handle the rest of the mop-up.  Or not.  Really, midtown could use some renovation.
“Oh, for God’s sake, would you eat?  If you looked at me the way you eyed that mutton, I’d give you half the kingdom.  Eat!” the King ordered and promptly speared a potato with his fork.  “Eat, and then we can spend the rest of the afternoon attacking my kingdom,” the King said, mouth quirking up a bit.
“You are hungry?” Cam asked.
“Out here?” Tony asked.
Tony sucked in a sharp breath, then raked a hand over his face.  “Is it because of what happened on the platform, do you think?”
“I think it’s starting to work,” Tony said, squishing his face together in a deep wince.  He reached up and pinched the bridge of his nose, releasing a long breath.  “Anyway, point being, this guy Steve, he’s actually pretty nice, and I kind of asked him out again, and he said yes.  And then said some other nice things.  We actually have a weird amount in common.  Basic stuff, you know, likes, dislikes, perception of our place in the world, that kind of thing.”
“Um...sorry, ah...where are we?” Steve asked, making Stark turn back towards him.
Steve was blushing furiously, shoulders hunched and elbows on the table holding his cards up in his hand like a fan, as if he could fold himself in behind them if he just scrunched up enough.  “I know things have changed, Sam.  A lot for the better, which is great.  But, I don’t know…I don’t see myself really changing all that much on something like that,” Steve asserted evenly, clearly forcing himself to look around the table, though there wasn’t any real embarrassment exactly, just a tinge of discomfort, as if he was unsure if this was a topic he would normally discuss with them, despite Wilson and Natasha’s casualness.  “I’ve waited this long.  I don’t mind waiting for someone special.  It’ll be worth it, when is with the right person.”
“Romotive Group.  I, uh,” Tony stammered, curling his mouth into a thin line and scratching at his beard.  “I kind of bought it.   I mean, it’s a good investment.  Maybe.  Honestly, I don’t know or care.  But, that Estes guy?  He was mean to you, and I didn’t like it, and sometimes I can kind of be a petty jerk, but since I’m rich, we call that eccentric, okay?”
“I know you can take care of yourself,” Steve finally responded.  “But, you don’t have to.”
He looked down at the parchment in his lap and brushed the charcoal dust off the drawing.  The images of a figure bending low, hand extended as crumbs fell and a small, black bird peering up with keen interest were little more than outlines in the midst of broad strokes and the suggestion of movement, but it was a start.
“No, but see…” Tony started, then shoved his hands in his pockets and trailed off, looking off down the Strip where the sun was glinting off the mirrored glass. “It’s terrible timing.  It is,” Tony said, giving Steve a quick look as he walked over to the railing and wrapped his hands around it.  “Not sorry about it, though.  I should be.  Bringing you into all this…this craziness.  It’s dangerous.  More dangerous than you probably realize, not that I think for a minute that would actually put you off the idea,” Tony scoffed, shooting Steve a flat smile before going back to looking at the whirl of signs and billboards that beckoned people to come lose their money.  “I can’t seem to…to
“That’s Mr. Interloper,” Sam called out from the hallway, where he was leaning against the stair railing, holding a beer and what Tony liked to think of as the sad remnants of his completely unrequited crush.  “And I brought Funyuns, which everyone knows are Bro Code for Sorry For Trying to Mack On Your Guy Who Has Been Single For Ten Years, and a twelve pack of Dew, so don’t even start.”
It wasn’t as if someone like Tony Stark would understand anything about him or his relationship.  The man was a billionaire hundreds of times over.  One of the most famous people in the world.  He had a different supermodel on his arm--and other places, if the pictures that circulated were any indication--nearly every night.  He had houses, cars, planes, that big, ugly tower in downtown Manhattan--heck, the man had his own island.  He had everything he could possibly want.  Sure, there was that whole kidnapping plot in Afghanistan, but Stark had been found and come out of it hailed a hero, with his face plastered all over every news report around the globe.
Steve leaned back in his seat, reaching around to try to work out a crick in his neck.  It
“Yeah.  Yeah, I did,” Tony replied quietly, coming to a halt beside where Steve stood rigid.  “Sat in a car in the hospital parking lot, getting updates from some General who likes to take the yacht out when he’s stateside.  I—I should’ve come inside.  It was a chicken-shit thing to do, sitting out there like that,” Tony rushed out, watching Steve’s face for any guidepost of where he should take this conversation.  Off-ramp, please, Tony thought to himself.  “I don’t know—I heard about your—the accident, and I just got on the plane.  I don’t know what I was thinking.  I just…I had to be there.”
“We should probably head back,” Tony said when Steve finally caught his breath, though there was no real urgency in his voice.  Honestly, he didn’t really want this to end, not just yet.  He should be exhausted and have already felt the need to find his own space, and realized with surprise that the usual skittering sensation under his skin when was around someone else for too long hadn’t made an appearance.
“I’ll kill them,” Steve said with a firm nod, brow drawing together before it slipped into a familiar smile.  “No?  Toss them off something?  Would you really miss that shelving unit you insisted we get that came in five hundred pieces? Come on,” he urged, nudging a shoulder gently into Tony, making him rock back on his heels.  “Good talking to?  Stern look? Strongly worded letter?”
“Do you like macramé?” Tony asked.
To his surprise, he felt a warm hand cover his own, and he looked up to find Shellhead’s hand covering his. The creature looked at him, its eyes pulled into crescent moons, and slowly shook its head. Just for a moment, it gave Steve’s hand a squeeze, and he felt something heavy and solid stroke down his back, and then it was gone, skittering back across the sand and shallows as fast and silently as it had come.
“How did it go?” Pepper asked without preamble.
Just knowing it was happening sent searing, phantom pain through his veins. The iron bands that seemed to be wrapped around his chest tightened.  He tried to breathe again. It felt like there was no air in the room. No air in him. His head throbbed. A warm, wet rivulet of blood trickled down his neck from his ear. His dry eyes stung.   All he could do was stare at Obie as the man he had considered family tore his heart from his chest. Too late, Tony thought dazedly. Too late, I already gave it to someone else, he thought with a hysterical sort of numb horror blinkering his thoughts.
“What, Tony? You’re at SHIELD, right?  One of the most secure places on Earth?  What could possibly happen?”  Pepper questioned.
“Maybe you should get one of your robots to do that for you, seeing as how you find that sort of thing so—“ Steve stopped, looked down at Tony, eyes narrowing. “The ceiling fan. That’s it, isn’t it?  That’s your robotics project.  You built a waffle-tossing robot.”
“The hooker’s smart. I know.  Shocking,” Kirk replied flatly.
From outside, he heard the rolling clank of the garage door opening as Steve unloaded Tony’s gear from the trunk.  The armor had been a last-minute addition to their trip.  Leaving it behind…had just turned out to be something he couldn’t do.  Thankfully, Steve hadn’t questioned it, just dutifully put it in the back of the SUV next to Tony’s Hermes suitcase and a big bag of mixed nuts, still in their shells.
Steve pulled almost all the way out, until the just the head of his cock sat sheathed just inside the reddened rim of Tony’s hole, then pushed back in, rocking Tony’s body with the force of his thrust.  Tony gasped and choked out a harsh cry, gripping Steve’s hand and pushing it into his chest.
“I’d love to,” Steve said.
“So, speaking of names, you all have like a cool gang name or something?  Sharks, Jets, Bloods, Crips, what do people call terrifying gangs out for vigilante justice these days? Fangirls?” Tony asked, squinting up at the dangling light as Steve angled them out the office door.
“Okay.  If you want,” Steve said after a beat.  Steve gave him a lingering look, then pulled out his chair and sat back down, though he didn’t go back to eating, just let his gaze dart to Tony, then to anything else in the room that wasn’t Tony.   He’s nervous, Tony thought with a pang.  Minus the threat of bodily injury, he might be just as nervous as I am, though, come to think, it had been at least a couple of weeks since he’d genuinely given any thought to that possibility.  The idea had seemed to narrow, more and more, in his mind until there was just a splinter of it left, still there, still something he could worry at when he thought on it, but most of the time, it wasn’t something he was consciously aware of anymore.
“Okay, in what world is ‘He bounced’ a legitimate defense to anything?” Clint argued.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.  “But, there was this one passage.  You were—you were talking about being at MIT and your parents and all that,” Steve said, eyes going soft and far away for a moment. “That you worked with the car companies to improve safety features after that. Then taking over the company, and how you felt this obligation to the troops to make sure they had the best gear.  How that was what kept you up at night, wondering if you’d done enough, or if some spouse or parent or child was going to get a call like you got.  I was in the middle of trying to decide whether to re-up, and I guess that resonated a little more than I wanted to admit.  Worrying that you’re not doing enough, and someone else is going to get hurt because of it,” Steve finished, looking down at his lap before turning his head towards Tony.
“Tonnnnnnnyyyy,” Steve ground out.
of crickets.  I had Coulson cancel it.”
Tony started walking forward, quick, determined steps that left Steve little choice but to follow. The land sloped downward just enough that he could feel the pull of it.  The crumbled remains of the village began to rise up in front of them, like they grew from the land itself.  Mounds of charred dirt, bits of wood and the stones that some had used around doorways and windows left in hulking piles, blown dry by the salty sea air.
“Always,” Steve whispered, leaning his forehead down to touch Tony’s, then catching himself and remembering the bump on Tony’s head.  “Sorry,” he winced, gingerly brushing the hair back from Tony’s head to place a kiss just to the right of the bump.  “Doctor,” Steve said sternly.
“Barely.  And just waiting for coffee, like every poor soul up at this hour,” Tony replied.
“Guess I don’t have to ask if the rest of your night went well,” Tony bit out, looking him up and down with such derision that Steve almost took a step back. It took a moment for his brain to catch up to the implication, but when it did, he felt a hot spike of anger shoot down his spine and settle in his stomach.  He couldn’t stop the flush creeping up his cheeks, though he wasn’t sure if it was anger or embarrassment at the team thinking that Tony was right or a combination of the two.  Where did Tony get off judging him, even if that had been what he’d been doing last night?  He’d tried to never judge Tony for his lifestyle.  It wasn’t his business, after all.  Or at least, he’d told himself that while he stewed and burned “Eric’s” bacon the next morning.
“I mean, that’s…” Brock began, looking over to Steve with wide, shocked eyes.
“I have to go,” Steve said, trying to keep the regret out of his voice.  “Work. You know?  That thing people do.  I have to go, Tony,” he said, as Tony’s grip tightened.
“I—like—you—too—Your—Highness,” Steve panted in halting gulps of mingled air and words.
“I see that we do have an understanding, then.  Until next time,” Zola replied, dipped his head in mock deference and swept out of the room with his guards on his heels.  Steve waited until the lock clicked into place before turning to catch Cam’s wide-eyed stare.
It wasn’t a request, of course, so Steve just nodded, while Cam grinned widely.
“So, what’s the issue?” Steve asked.
“I don’t,” Tony said quickly.  Damn. Too quickly.  “I mean.  It would be weird, right?  Us just Bonded and all.  They don’t—I don’t think they expect to see me. They’d just think that I had….I mean, you know, probably not, like, this soon or anything, right?”
“I am well occupied, Tony,” Steve replied.  That much was true.  Between lessons with Master Len and Master Doran, his painting tutor, sparring with Tony and General Rhodes, the massive library at his disposal and the myriad kinds of amusements that Tony arranged for them—dancing troupes, acrobats, jugglers, even a joust and pitted matches that ended with hours-long discussions of where the losing side made their misstep--his days were often so busy, he had little time to think.  He was fairly sure that was deliberate.
it.   Not even because it hurt.  That was the most painful thing of all.  The realization that he had moved past whatever could have been without even realizing it.  He wanted to look away. Keep telling himself that he’d missed his chance, that he’d made a sacrifice, a choice, and given up on his shot at all of that.
“Whoa, whoa, Ca—Steve, that’s not at all--I mean, maybe at first, but only because I was an idiot, and didn’t think,” Tony sputtered, hearing the panic in his own voice.
The incredible Rosblues drew this scene from the art gallery where Steve is completely trolling Tony over modern art.  Check her tumblr, rosblues.tumblr.com,  for more great works and commission info!
everything, huh?” Steve teased, moving his hands down to Tony’s neck and digging his fingers in until the other man groaned in pleasure.
“Oh.  It pleases me,” Tony said harshly, then flattened his mouth and seemed to force it into a half-smile.  He shed his clothes with efficiency.  Boots first.  Shiny, soft leather ones that came up to his knees.  Then the wide leather belt and tight fitting breeches he wore.  Steve caught site of the dark swirl of hair there, cradling Tony’s stiff cock where it jutted out.  Finally, he pulled his tunic off and dropped it to the floor without a care.  He sat still for a moment, then looked down at Steve.
Allen made a small, surprised harrumphing sound, then put his hands in his pockets and rocked back a bit on his heels.  “Well…no Omega to please, that certainly makes it easy,” Allen said brightly, raising his eyebrows.  “Though, I’m sure when you do Bond, your Omega will have a great time brightening up this place.  New paint, some updated furniture, re-do the kitchen and bath, that kind of thing.  Be kind of fun for them, having a little project, you know?  They have a real knack for this kind of thing, anyway—you should see what my best friend’s cousin’s Omega did with their place.  Looks
“Wasn’t going to.  I had this Tamagotchi--”
“No. No, I got this,” Tony replied with a firmness that was probably belied by how much his hands were shaking. He kept having to ball them into fists or rub them up and down over his thighs to cover the movement and the admission that Rhodey would see in it. He didn't think Rhodey missed it, though. Really should've picked a best friend who lacked observational skills. Would've solved so much, he thought with a grim sigh.
“Huh?  Oh.  Yeah. Sure, that--that’d be great,” Steve told him, smiling flatly.   A wave of something Steve told himself was hunger passed through him.  That was what he wanted, right?  That was what he had asked for last night.  If he was getting what he wanted, why did it feel so… disappointing?  His mind flashed to the snarl on Brock’s face last night when Steve suggested it, and he thought of Tony, making sure it was good for Steve, taking his time,
“So.  That one over there tells me you share a room with him back at Zola’s,” the King said.  He picked up his quill and sorted through the stack of papers on his table until he found a small ream of parchment and put the quill to it.  “That true?”
“Steve likes his burnt,” Tony said with a grimace, taking the patties from the center of the grill off and slid them onto the waiting platter that Rhodey held out where they landed with a dubious-sounding thunk.
“If I want to, he says,” Tony mumbled from underneath his arm.  Tony tossed his arm to the side and rolled over onto his elbows to glare up at Steve.  “Steve.  Are you sure this is about what you want?  Really want, not just want to want because you think it’s something I want?”
“I know,” Tony said.  Steve was fidgeting next to him.  Tony reached out and covered Steve’s hand with his own where Steve had been tapping out a nervous rhythm against his thigh.  Steve’s motions slowed, then stopped, and he glanced over at Tony with a grateful look.  Tony gave his hand a light squeeze, and to his surprise, felt Steve’s fingers interlace with his own.
“Pepper’s waiting in the car,” Tony added, waving to a few tourists that milled around the hotel lobby as they passed through.  “There’s Happy,” he nodded at the limo by the valet stand where Happy hurriedly opened the door for them with a quick salute aimed at Rhodey.
“That’s…ah…Dubhe.  Part of the Big Dipper,” Tony added, looking askance at where Stone’s sleeve brushed the top of his shoulder.  It was fine.  He was just showing Tony what he was trying to ask about.  It was
“I was the one who made your guy fall,” Malcolm cut in. “I didn’t mean to, but it was me he tripped over. Well, kinda, because I was going for that thing he dropped ‘cause I thought maybe it was a bomb or something after he electrocuted Dom with—with whatever that was.”
Tony’s hand worked him through the last of it, until Steve had stopped shaking and gone dry, then he let go and rinsed off in the shower, while Steve watched.  He wanted to tell Tony to stop, to stay like that, to keep it on him, wanted to see Tony covered like that.  Shame at the thought burned through him, but it didn’t push the thought away, if anything, made it somehow brighter, clearer, more true.  He didn’t say anything, of course, but Tony always knew, anyway.  Tony was grinning again, clearly pleased, almost surprised.
“Remember I told you about Peter?” Steve asked.  Shellhead nodded. “After Peter’s parents died, there was just his aunt, and she was elderly at that.  Didn’t really have much for him, but she put him in one of the orphanages so he could get at least a daily meal and paid his allotment for as long as she could, I guess.  But, if you stop paying, then the state makes them a ward. Lots of people, they couldn’t pay, you know? Ma said people were always leaving the little babies outside the rich folks’ houses up on Fifth Avenue.  One time, Bucky’s Ma heard him say he was going to go up there and see if he could get adopted, and she boxed his ears real good,” Steve said with a slight smile.
“I’ll eat pretty much anything if it involves bread and cheese,” Tony told him, turning away from the view and walking over to where Steve was standing, balancing the large, white boxes on one hand.
“So, I can’t really let you just meet him, you understand. We already had an…incident…with some Alpha military observer that was part of the recovery team, which I would not like to see repeated.  He’ll be okay, mind you.  Eventually,” Fury said, shrugging as if totally unconcerned.   “We’ve kept him isolated through the worst of it, but I’ve got a stack of increasingly belligerent messages from everyone from Ross on down demanding to meet him.  Somehow, I don’t think they are concerned about his health and well-being, if you catch my drift.”
And Calhoun really, really needed to understand that.
, but, I take your point.  Okay.  Well.  We’ve established that you’re incredibly self-sacrificing and have little to know sense of self-preservation, which, admittedly, are currently traits that work in my favor,” Tony said, splaying his hands wide while he dangled the fork over his plate. “So, this whole Tony-whisperer thing you have going with me…” Tony began, lips quirking up a bit at the corners.  “The counting and the breathing, all that…you seem to have some firsthand experience.  Are you seeing someone?  Not like—I don’t mean like seeing someone, like that.  Like, a professional someone.  Not a
“Probably not, but I suspect that bit of information is probably going to be shared faster than a Bieber selfie,” Tony replied, tipping his head side to side in a tsking motion.
“No.  No, it’s not…it’s not that, Steve,” Tony replied with a heavy sigh.
it, so badly, but Tony’s touch was like a balm over a wound that Steve hadn’t realized he carried.  He couldn’t help but want more.
“Guess they backed each other up, huh?” Tony asked, though Steve knew perfectly well that Tony already knew the answer to that question. Steve’s absence the past ten days was all the response that was needed.  “Look, I’ll talk to the warden.  Doyle’s an idiot and an utter asshole, but he’ll have to at least listen to—“
“Can’t say that I can,” Stane agreed. That was when Steve knew that Stane did, in fact, recognize him, and he hated the man a little more for that, even if it wasn’t entirely fair.  “You did always have a weakness for the uniform, if I recall.”
“I don’t want you to
“Oh.  Okay,” Tony responded dully.  What could he say?  “No problem.  Good to know. Won’t happen again.”  He turned towards the cabin and started forward on feet that seemed to drag through the gravel.  Nothing was working right.  He wasn’t working right.  He wasn’t right.  Something like that.
Yeah. Worth a million bucks, he thought with a grimace.  Let’s not forget what you were here for, Rogers.  For a long time, Steve just stared up at the ceiling where shadows moved with the city lights.  A million dollars, he thought.  He felt Tony shift a little in his arms.  A million dollars.  I can do anything I want now.  He waited for the surge of happiness.  Or relief.  Something.
Art.  They were talking about art.  Abstract expressionism, his mind supplied.  Million dollar paintings that Tony bought because his assistant liked them, when he wanted to wear a tie with racecars on it.  A man who wanted to expose a terrorist network apparently within their own government if he was to be believed, all tied to whatever it was that happened to him in Afghanistan that he could barely talk about without resorting to fight or flight.  Stark was a maddening contradiction of impulses, if nothing else.
Steve rolled his eyes, but ducked his head against the wind and followed along next to Tony as they walked across the rather euphemistically named green towards the car.  Rhodey pushed open the back door as they approached and leaned out with a grin that quickly faded as Tony shook his head fervently to the side and make a slashing motion with one hand.
“Of course, of course, I understand,” Maria said, glancing quickly at Tony.  “Your job must be very important, I’m sure.”
Btw, if you think that Tony's reaction to Steve in the garage was unrealistic, I direct you to the time a guy I liked tried the yawn and stretch move on me and I panicked, ran to the bathroom and hid for 45 minutes, because the horror that he might know I liked him outweighed any desire I had to find out if he liked me.  Ah, dear, young sabrecmc...
“Ah,” Tony said, cutting Steve off with a raised hand.  “I see.  Come here,” Tony said, voice gentle as he motioned Steve forward to the place in front of his chair.   “You will not listen to me from over there.  Your head is too full, my dear one, and no wonder.  Please,” Tony urged again when Steve didn’t move.    Finally, Steve walked over and stood in front of Tony’s bent knees, then knelt down and looked up, as much out of a shocked curiosity than anything else.  “Do you truly think that I would ever hurt you?  Really hurt you?”
more.  Turns out, my CFO was selling weapons under the table, black market kind of deals.  I found out.
“Rogers,” Steve said by way of answer as he clicked the button on the phone.  “Now isn’t really…Uh-huh.”  Pause.  “I see.”  Hand on his hip.  Toe of his shoe scuffing against the driveway.  Someone wasn’t happy about things, Tony thought with no small amount of glee. “Fine,” Steve snapped, clicking the phone off and dropping it back into his pocket.  “I have to go.”
It took some time before Cam returned to the tent, but finally, the boy came back and announced that it was time to join the King and his guests for dinner. As they ducked under the flap of the King’s tent, Steve saw that it was nearly dark. The temperature was actually rather pleasant, he realized, as a low breeze ruffled the hem of his robes and made the beads and metal discs that adorned his outfit click softly as he walked.
“Buck, you should really get some rest, too.  We’ve got the VA thing in the morning,” Steve reminded him.
Tony’s hands skated up Steve’s arms and over his shoulders, then he stopped, hesitated, his eyes boring into Steve’s.  “For tonight. Just for tonight,” Tony rasped out, and Steve nodded jerkily. He felt Tony’s fingers under his collar, and then the weight was gone from his neck.  Steve breathed in. The weight was gone, but it was like he could still feel it, the absence of it nearly choking him.
“Ah.  Well.  About that,” Steve began.  “See, the thing is—I know in the emails, we said--“
“You have given me so much,” Steve replied, then more carefully, “Surely…surely a fortune already.  More than I am worth, I would think.”
It looked great, actually, and his stomach rumbled in agreement.  Eggs, over easy, just like he preferred.  Crispy strips of bacon.  Those flaky, layered, artificially butter-flavored biscuits.  They came out of a can, but he still liked them better than the doughy, floury things that Jarvis used to make.
Cam pursed his mouth and tilted his head to the side, his hands going to his hips in a gesture that was fairly familiar to Steve.  “There is a man juggling four balls at once, a minstrel, and an acrobat who can twist herself into a tiny shape no bigger than your trunk there.”
“Right.  Right, well, as I was saying,” the professor continued, giving Tony another long look before launching into some spiel about isolationism.
“Yeah, because Tony’s going to handle those kinds of questions about Steve so well,” Rhodes said, staring into the fluorescent light of the open refrigerator.
“I’m fine,” Steve ground out.
“Well, I’m a married man, you see,” Tony said, leaning in so that his mouth grazed across Steve’s.  “And my husband’s the jealous type.”
Tony felt he honestly tried to get his legs to work properly, but they were currently being absorbed by the sand and heat or something, because they definitely weren’t listening to him.  It didn’t matter, of course, because Steve lifted him into his arms and stood up in one, fluid motion, hugging Tony to his chest as he walked to the waiting helicopter.
“That is…one thing that I am,” Tony remarked flatly, swallowing thickly. He drew his hands back and shifted his hips towards the table, trying to breathe deeply and think of Mr. Stout, his paunchy, balding eighth grade Latin teacher who favored comb-overs and smelled of Pine-Sol for God only knew what reason. It was that or hump Steve’s leg, so better part of valor and all.  “Color me up, William,” Tony told the stickman.
“I try, Your Majesty,” the younger Lord Rand said.  “I don’t think I’ll have much of a chance against Lord Stone, but I shall endeavor to do the Ridge proud.”  Possibly only Steve noticed the way Tony stiffened at the mention of Lord Stone.
, you’re perfect--,” Tony bit off a curse as he rammed his cock deep, hitting that spot deep inside Steve again, and came with a warm, wet spurt that filled Steve with a bone-deep satisfaction.  A few more thrusts as he chased the feeling, and Tony collapsed on top of Steve’s chest, panting heavily.
“I wasn’t…” Steve began, then dropped his gaze down to his plate.  “I got in a fight one time.  Alley, behind this movie theater.  Big lug of a guy. Way bigger than I probably shoulda messed with, but that wasn’t anything new.  Remember how I told you I was sick as a kid?  Well, scrawny, too.  Ninety pounds soaking wet.  I was pretty well getting clobbered, but I grabbed this garbage can lid, held it up like a shield.  Thought the guy was going to laugh himself into a stupor.”
“Please, please, please, Steve, you have to believe me. I would never—this wasn't me, I swear, I swear it, Steve, please,” Tony begged, the words spilling out in great, wet heaves. He was grasping and tugging at Steve's shirt, like if he could just get closer, maybe Steve would believe him, which he knew didn't make any sense, but he couldn't seem to stop the impulse. “Whatever I said that night, I didn't mean it. I was drunk and hurt, and I wanted to hurt you. You were everything to me, and I thought you only cared about the money, and it hurt so fucking much. I didn't know about that—that thing,” Tony babbled on, still unable to say the words that would give that piece of paper any kind of spark of life between them now. “I would never, ever say those things about you. I wasn't scared! God, not of you. Never. Never, Steve. I was pissed. Pissed and hurt, and dammit, fuck! I'm sorry, Steve. I'm so damn sorry. Please. Please, believe me.”
He could feel the alien’s thrusts speeding up, losing some of their rhythm as they did, going a bit sloppy.  He wasn’t sweating, Tony noticed, but the alien looked like he
The man’s voice was nice, Steve decided.  It was oddly soothing, like when Steve’s mother tucked a blanket warmed by the fire over him when he was having one of his spells.  That didn’t make the man nice.  Steve wasn’t stupid, and he knew better than most how quickly a nice voice could turn cruel, but he liked the man’s way of talking, anyway, if only because it was so different, and not much different ever happened to him, even when he so desperately wanted it to.
No one was waiting for him.
The car stopped in front of the cabin, and they thanked Happy and climbed out.  Seemingly by silent agreement, they watched until the car’s tail lights disappeared around the curve.
“Less annoyed and more caffeinated, apparently,” Clint snarked.  Steve ignored him, picking up the New York Times and reviewing the headlines about yesterday’s battle.  Always good to stay on top of your press.
He still didn’t know why he got fired from the jobs Sam found for him when he’d thought he was doing pretty good, but apparently not good enough.  Frankly, he thought the thing with Mr. Nguyen was all some misunderstanding since he never got any messages about coming in early or taking the weekend shift. Sure, some days were still harder than others, and he still had the occasional nightmare or moment when something would set him off, but it was better. He was better.
Steve rubbed at his forehead, squeezing the sides together with his fingers.  This was going even worse than he’d thought, and somehow, it was him back on his heels again, though he didn’t know quite how.  He felt all twisted around on himself, like one of those snakes eating its own tail.
Steve nodded, and the boy added the oil to the bath.  Steve took the sponge that Cam offered and cleaned himself off.  Quickly.  His skin was already prickling with the cold, but it was doing its job.  By the time he rinsed off and got out, his cock was hanging blessedly limp between his legs.  Cam handed him a towel, and he wrapped it around his hips, then sat down on the pallet and leaned back against the wall.
“I’m just saying, you made a lot of people happy, didn’t hurt anyone, and got paid for it, so why’s everyone so God-damned up in arms about it?  How much hardware do we have between us for what we did over there, huh? They were handing them out like candy from a white van for a while. I’m not saying what we did was wrong. I get that it’s fucking complicated, but I’m saying no one so much as bats an eye because we were in uniform, and you know—
He sat back and reached up to rub at his medallion.  The creature mimicked the motion, touching the blue stone necklace it wore, then pointed at Steve with a chuttering, insistent noise that Steve had come to associate with avid curiosity.
It was the elevator announcing its arrival, he realized, and immediately headed back inside the suite, heart thudding in his chest.  His heart leapt into his throat.  His stomach swooped.  Tony was back.  Steve sucked in a sharp breath.
“I’ll put the two of you down for a maybe for the dinner. It’s at the Bellagio. They offered to comp you the Presidential suite for the night if you showed.   You remember that one?” Pepper asked, without waiting for a reply. “Please don’t make them have to empty the fountain this time,” Pepper said, tapping something into her phone.  “Well, I should go work on the press conference.  Talk to Steve.  Seriously, Tony, talk to him.  Don’t get on a bus.”
“Just saying…” Tony shrugged.
“You mean the billion-dollar elephant in the room?” Rhodey asked.
laugh… so, yeah.  He’d wanted to see Tony again.  No harm in admitting it.  He’d wanted to see Tony, but Tony hadn’t wanted to see him, and that was
.  You know, this is not so far off from reality, come to think,” Tony grumbled under his breath.  “I’d have said yes just to shut them up.  Probably would’ve figured I could talk you into running for the hills in under three minutes.  My record was forty-two seconds.  Some guy who was ‘in stocks,’ but his true passion was writing the great American novel about, not making this up, an Alpha who is ‘in stocks,’ but fights crime at night and is incredibly deep and misunderstood, which you know because he---wait for it—likes to write.  Did not see that coming, right?  I may have rather descriptively suggested what he could do with his little self-insert project.”
“Technically, the wall hit him,” Steve said, with a rueful twist to his mouth.
“Or, he’s a nice guy who is good at pretending he likes me, just like we all—all of us,” Tony reminded them, making a small circle in the air with his finger, “asked him to.  So that we could, you know, save the world, and all that heroic stuff he kind of desperately wants to be a part of.  And I’m emotionally stunted and needy and reading too much into a public display of affection that I technically paid for,” Tony retorted, then dropped his head into his hands and tugged on his hair with a nervous, tittering laugh that devolved into a frustrated groan.  “I mean, door number two is looking a lot more likely, you’ve got to admit.”
“Ngh,” Tony choked out.  The alien circled the rim of Tony’s hole with his finger again, then slipped the long, smooth digit inside where the not-gel coated it with a warm slickness.  Pleasure zinged through Tony’s body like electricity, lighting up his nerves and making black spots dance in front of his vision. The alien started to work his finger in and out of Tony’s body in a slow, unhurried rhythm, sometimes twisting it, sometimes holding it deep inside Tony while Tony writhed ineffectually against the soft confines of the not-gel.
“It’s not fucking nothing, Steve.  God,” Barnes muttered, running his hand through his hair, jaw going tight. “Look, Steve…everything you’ve done, it’s…I can’t ever repay you for that, okay?  And yeah, sure, situation gets reversed, and you know I’d do the same.  Whatever it takes, right?  That doesn’t mean that it always has to be so damn hard, Steve.  Tony can help.  He wants to help.  Probably half because he’s a good guy or some shit, and probably half because he wants to get in your pants.”
“Okay, you cannot just call the chimney,” Rhodey objected.  “We’re not five.  We’ll divvy up the available structural cover options when we get up there like the grown men we are.”
“Tele--Empty garage?” Tony piped up.
and I don’t—I don’t want to know, okay?  I get it.  It’s fine.  It’s—its fine.  I told you, it’s fine for you to…do what you need to do.  Just.  I don’t need to know, okay?” Tony said, the last of it coming out like a plea, the anger leaving him so fast he half expected to simply crumple to the ground, like it had been the only thing animating him.
“Stone was the only one he ever seemed to spend any time on, though we all know how that ended.  This one has something of the look, true, though…softer, I think. More elegant, somehow.  Oh, not now, don’t look at me like I’ve lost my mind!” Zola laughed, waving a hand at Sitwell.  “Give me time.  Though, God only knows whether it will even matter.  Lord Stane commands me to keep him happy and pleasantly occupied, as if doing such a thing is a simple task.  I send him the finest I have, but I think one must be a trebuchet or some such to hold his interest for very long,” Zola said with a frustrated grimace.
“Is this a cover-up? Was the military involved?” a woman in the front row asked.
Steve twisted around and slammed his elbow into Tyber’s mouth, then grabbed the spear and shoved it backwards into the stomach of one of the other men.  Everything seemed to happen at once, at least to Anto’s eyes. Tyber grabbed at his mouth, where blood gushed like a stream and stumbled backwards in shock.  Steve punched him in the nose. There was a sickening cracking sound, then he followed it up with a kick to Tyber’s gut, sending him into the dirt, where he groaned once, then seemed to crumble and sag, going still.
.  Knowing what all of this was doing to him. The thought sent a rush of hot shame through his gut that made Steve want to squirm. It mixed with a deeper heat of arousal that pooled low behind Steve’s cock, which throbbed insistently against the confines of the cage around it.   The combination was almost too much.
Steve wiped himself down afterwards, then studied his wardrobe choices with a slight frown.  He finally settled on a length of dual circular chains with a cascade of golden strands dripping from the front and back that wrapped across one shoulder and under his arm.  Around his waist, he tied a simple golden sash, then looked appraisingly over his reflection in the tall looking glass that leaned against the wall next to the bed.
He swiped the heel of his hand across his eyes and sat back in the chair.  Fine.  Fine, so Steve wanted him to go to MIT.  Learn how to do this stuff for real.  No more playing around in his garage.  He could do that.   If that was what Steve wanted, he could give that to Steve.  He wanted it, too.  Didn’t he?  He thought he did.  Had.  Had he wanted this?  It was a bit like wanting to fly and then finding out that you could, you could fly, but you could only fly and keep flying and never, ever stop.  God, it was all so messed up in his head.
“No, I’m not going to just let them finish. This is insane!  You’re all—what is wrong with you?  All of you?” Tony heard himself shouting.  “This is cra—this is crazy,” he stammered, looking at all the faces watching him, waiting for someone to agree with the obvious.  Except they weren’t.  They were looking at him with something like embarrassed sympathy.  Pity, maybe.  Tinged with expectation.  Because he was missing something, and they were waiting for him to catch up, he realized.  God, he hated that feeling, to be the idiot who didn’t
He had the sense of being down.  His back and legs were flat against something hard.  Carefully, Steve opened his eyes. It was dark. Not pitch black, but dark.  He was laying on something hard and cold, but smooth, like metal or tile. He couldn’t see much, though a few lights of different colors glowed on a panel on what Steve assumed was the wall. It felt…different.  Unfamiliar. It definitely wasn’t Shuri’s lab in Wakanda, that was for sure.
“Together,” Tony said.
“Yes,” Steve acknowledged.
“Moved the hat guy again!” Cam answered back.
“No.  No, not anymore,” Steve said, trying to keep the disappointment out of his voice.
Tony’s letters had certainly grown far more succinct over the past few months, Steve thought with a wry grimace as his fingers grasped the curling edge of the parchment too tightly, like they wanted to pull something more from the paper. He looked up from the parchment and stared out the open tent flap at the distant, purpling mountains, hazy in the setting sun. It would be full dark soon, the swath of stars just waiting for the sun to disappear before making their appearance, so low in the sky you felt you could almost touch them out here. He looked down at the paper again, running the ball of his thumb over the swirls of the words, not sure if he wanted to feel them or wipe them away. For a bleak moment, he wanted to crush the missive to his chest, hold onto something that wasn’t here for him to feel.
Probably sending him off for reinforcements in case things went south, Steve figured.  There were other people at the fringes of his sightline now, drawn by the commotion.  People who had been in the showers or just coming in to change. They weren’t intervening, not yet.  This was Strike Team business, or so they probably assumed.  They weren’t going to get in the middle of it, anyway.
“A house by the sea,” Tony reminded him again, voice ringing with a plea as his fingers lightly stroked up and down the sides of Steve’s face. “What do you take that for, but a hope, a dream, the future we can build together? That is
“You sure you still want to do the thing?  I can tell Pepper you’re out. No problem. Honestly, Steve, it isn’t that big a deal,” Tony offered with a shrug of his shoulders.
“Tell me about the stars,” Steve said, sitting up and placing a hand on the side of the telescope tube.
“Ah, I think it will just open now,” Steve suggested. “You…um…you want to try it with the, uh, the glove…thing…off?”  As it turned out, Tony did, very much, thank you.  Steve had the best suggestions, really.  The gauntlet retracted, peeling the layers of metal away so his hand was free.  He pulled down the small door in the wall, and peered inside for a moment before reaching his hand through, grasping, searching, and then finally closing around warm, solid skin.  He felt his hand clench tightly around Steve’s, nails digging in for a moment, before he was able to release enough to thread his fingers through Steve’s, wrapping their hands together in an overlay of skin on skin, and that…that…that was everything perfect in the world, written in skin and bone and blood and nicks and cuts and marks etched into their palms, and the itchy, dizzy, nausea thing died down to something else, something that thrummed inside him,  sending stars dancing behind his eyes.  He blinked and placed his other hand braced on the wall for support.
“I’ve never found cleaning up more satisfying in my life,” Jarvis added through flattened lips.  “And how did…the, ah, socket experiment go, if I may ask?”
“I hope—“ Tony started, then broke off, gaze flicking down the beach before he drew it back to Steve. “I hope this is all that you wanted.  Know that…know that you are all I want.  However that may be.”  It struck Steve as an odd thing to say, but the moment had a strange fragility to it, like they were both aware of some spell neither wanted to be the one to break.  A door through worlds, Steve thought.  And neither of us wants to turn back, but each would follow the other, and we are not so far away from it that we have the trust of distance yet.
I am here, Steve thought.
Steve’s hands went to his collar next, and this time, he stepped closer to Tony, undoing a button on each step.  Tony sat up, all attention now. Steve saw him wet his lips with his tongue and momentarily lost his pace. He finally tugged his shirt out of his waistband and made short work of the last button.  Pulling the shirt open, he peeled it slowly off, one shoulder at a time, then let it fall to the floor. Tony groaned and made a sort of whimpering sound as Steve splayed his hands wide and ran them down his chest, biting his bottom lip as he did.
“Starving,” Tony replied.  Steve winced a bit and grimaced.  He didn’t think it was meant as a rebuke, but, well.  He was supposed to be paying attention to these things, taking care of Tony, and all he had been doing with his time was thinking about himself.  He should have ordered food earlier.  Or brought Tony something else to snack on after lunch instead of moping around the cabin doing no one any good.
“Enough.  That you’ve successfully completed a highly-classified experimental program. Thus, the high-level interest.  That you’re well-connected. Going places. All that. Like I said, it will be fairly obvious when you have me and a few of the Pentagon’s finest showing up to discuss the matter of your Bonding,” Fury pointed out with a slight grimace of distaste. “Howard’s a lot of things, but he isn’t stupid. He’ll put a lot of pieces together.”
You chose the one they burned, Tony thought again, though with far less virulence behind the words.
“Not—not really.  It was a dud, though, I didn’t know it at the time,” Steve explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time he navigated New York City traffic back to the Tower from Brooklyn, the skyline was lit up like Christmas, his name clearly visible in the middle of it all. He thought again of Steve's comments about the Tower, and couldn't help trying to look at his bouncing bundle of capitalistic excess through that filter. It was on the ostentatious side of gaudy, sure, but there was beauty there, too, at least to him. And to Steve, apparently. He decided to just ignore the too-obvious parallels in that particular sentiment.
“Right,” she agreed, taking the cup back from Steve and setting it aside.  “It worked.  To tell you the truth, we thought we’d lost both of you.”
“The story practically tells itself.  He uses you to get the technology. I know, I know, pinning it all on the greedy spouse is a bit cliché,” Obie said, tapping at the case in his hand that held the reactor. “But, it’s a classic, can’t argue with that,” Obie said, smiling slightly as he studied Tony. “He double crosses Batroc with the phony specs—oh, yes, I know about Batroc and your little plan.  Deal goes south, as those things do. Hey, it’s a tough world, these black market arms deals. Dangerous. Deadly,” Obie smiled down at him, all teeth. “Granted, I would have preferred he live, but…can’t really risk a trial, can I?”
“Anthony,” Steve shot back.
Still nothing. Steve’s certainty that he wasn’t just shouting at a few silverfish wavered a bit, but then his eye caught on something, just a shadow.  Could be a cloud overhead, sure. But, it wasn’t. He knew it wasn’t. Relief rushed through him. Relief and no small amount of excitement, he could admit, as he felt his heart skip a beat and his breath catch in his throat.  Ah, Shellhead, he thought with a warm fondness, I knew you couldn’t stay away. He rolled his lips together to keep from grinning.
Tony hummed.  He loosened his grip on Steve’s cock and ran his fingers up and down the length instead, along the underside, over the head, tracing the slit, but barely touching him.  It was driving Steve crazy. He needed more. He didn’t want it to stop. He didn’t know. He just wanted Tony.
“Ready?” Tony called out, glancing over his shoulder at Steve.
He swallowed and chanced a glance up at the dais where the man sat.  A thin, balding man leaned over and spoke a steady stream of words Tony didn’t understand into the man’s ear as Obie made his offer.  Tony shifted on his feet, hands fisting into the insides of the cloak where it stuck to his thighs, and winced as he drew in a long breath that burned through his chest. The burning sensation settled just behind the spot where Rumlow’s fist had landed sometime after Obie had spoken of a trade and ordered him stripped. Sometime after Tony had realized what he meant.
“Time helps us be better at dealing with loss.  It doesn’t make the pain go away,” Steve said.
“Okay, okay, fine.  You wanna talk it out, let’s talk,” Brock agreed.  He brushed past Steve, toward the small living room, and sprawled out on the futon, patting the spot next to him for Steve.  “Well?  This gonna start with why you didn’t answer any of my texts this morning?” Brock asked after Steve sat down.  He looped his arms around Steve’s shoulders and gave him a small shake.  “I was worried about you.  Thought maybe you’d, I don’t know, gotten yourself in trouble or some shit.  I was thinking about calling hospitals for crying out loud!”
“I do not like him,” Cam huffed after a moment’s pause where he seemed to discard five different things he wanted to say.
“His nurse is getting him a plate of food.  She should be back any minute. Don’t let him start in on Italy,” Charles warned.
What if, indeed.   Life wasn’t meant to be lived as a question, shrouded in uncertainty and the unknowable.   We are meant to know we are capable of being loved. That is the gift the universe gives us, and he had known that his whole life, only doubting it when it was actually presented to him.
“You think you have a running commentary of thoughts about me?” Steve asked. “I guarantee you it is nothing on how often I find myself in awe over brilliant, how amazing, how incredibly brave you are to do what you do, with no serum, no powers, just you.  And you…that you would…you would want me, even like this?  That you would not only understand what I have to do, but would be there beside me?” Steve said, and Tony could hear the genuine amazement in his voice.  “You think you have nothing to give?  How can you...you have no idea.  You...I can hardly breathe when I look at you, I’m so afraid you’re going to wake up from the hormones and realize you don’t want this.  I still think you might, no matter what you say,” Steve admitted, looking down at the floor.  “Maybe I’m just selfish enough to let myself believe you though.”
“I’m pissed,” Steve continued.  He shrugged Brock off, ignoring the surprised look on his boyfriend’s face, and stalked over to grab his phone and jacket.  “I’m going out.”
“Tony,” Steve said again, though it didn’t sound right, it sounded distant, like he was at the bottom of a tunnel and there was a pounding in his ears that he realized was his heart.  He felt the featherlight touch of Tony’s lips, warm and wet, against his. He should stop this. He needed to stop this. It had gone too far. He wasn’t supposed to talk to anyone. To interact.  Ripple effects, Steve thought, felt Tony’s tongue swipe across his bottom lip, and was gone. He groaned and dipped his head, capturing Tony’s mouth in a bruising kiss.
We stay together, he told them, sounding sure of himself.  We’ll figure it. He could taste the lie on his tongue as he said it, but what else could he possibly say?  They had been hopelessly outmatched, and whatever they might possibly accomplish, Thanos, presumably, still had the power to undo, even if he needed some mechanism other than the gauntlet to channel the stones’ power.
“Has he sent for another?” Steve asked, not for the first time, though it stung anew on each asking, sending a sharp, cold stab of pain twist through his gut.
“What is luck, except good planning meeting good timing?  There is a dinner tonight to honor the King for his generosity to the scholars at the university.  I’m told His Highness may actually attend, though I find that highly unlikely myself.  More likely, he will be occupied at the gaming tables Lord Stern runs,” Zola added with a slight smirk directed at Sitwell. “No matter, though.  An evening for the King means a busy evening for me and mine, and you…well, either you’ll prove useful or I’ll find some other way to get my money’s worth,” Zola finished with a shrug.
He dragged his gaze to the mirrored wall above the bar, lifted the glass in salute at the sad, little man staring back at him and took a long swallow. It should burn as it went down. Burn and purge, numb and destroy. That would be better. No.
“None of that,” Tony said as Steve grunted and shot Tony a frustrated look from under his lashes.  Tony grinned.
“Everyone in the city will be so excited to see you and think you so beautiful.  They will write poems and songs of you, you will see,” Cam twittered merrily as he laid a pair of shoes on the rug by the bed.
“See,” Fury started, glancing over his shoulder at Steve, “the thing is, the longer these rumors are out there, the harder it is to find him a mate, and Howard, he’s got a pretty solid idea of what he wants out of this whole Bonding thing.”
Steve woke slowly, one arm tossed over his face, his hand laying in the crook of his neck.  He yawned, stretched experimentally, and rubbed at the curve of his neck where he must have slept on it wrong.
Tony nuzzled at Steve’s cock, breathing deep, his nose brushing the coarse hairs in the vee of Steve’s legs. He pushed Steve’s thighs up, spreading him wide, then bent again between Steve’s legs, kissing a long trail from Steve’s knee down to the meaty flesh of his inner thigh where Steve’s cock strained for attention once again.  Tony peered up at him from under his brow, growled low--a rumbly sound that reverberated behind Steve’s ribs--licked over a spot, and then ducked his head until all Steve could see were dark curls where his cock rested, leaking fluid in a thin line.
“It isn’t, it’s…” Steve began, trailing off helplessly because he didn’t know
He was playing it off as nothing, which was what Steve tended to do, Tony knew, but Tony had the odd suspicion that Steve had given up on the whole bus stalemate because Tony had gotten cold, and that was…well, he didn’t know what that was.  Just like old times, a voice in his head supplied.  Steve always put Tony first.  Even now, that’s what Steve thought he was doing.  Putting Tony first.  Sacrificing his own happiness, because he thought it was best for Tony.  The dumbass.
“I’ll never get him out of that uniform, I swear,” Sugar replied.  “He keeps putting it off, one crisis and then another that, oh, just can’t be solved without him, you know.  Not that I want him poking around the house all day.”
“So,” Steve began, then immediately faltered when Stark’s attention settled on him.  His throat clicked as he swallowed, and he breathed out, looking away and finding only stares in return.
“I thought you’d like the view up here,” Steve said, lifting his gaze back to the sky.  “I thought you’d like the car, too.”
“Post-Prison Break Pizza Party.  It’s a thing,” Rhodey said.
“Jesus, fuck, yeah,” Tony groaned, tossing his head to the side as pleasure thrummed through him.  Not just what his body felt, but more, like he could feel the alien’s pleasure, too, and when he managed to look back down at the alien, his strange, blue eyes were wide and the pupils a dark, deep blue-black like a raven’s wing that took up nearly the entirety of his eye. The effect was stunning and foreign and deeply, profoundly
“Exactly,” Tony agreed, taking another drink. “Pepper's running interference for me—which, thanks for getting the mea culpas, by the way. Though, fair warning, Pepper and Nat hit it off, so you might want to, I don't know, change your name, buy supplies, move to Montana. Just a suggestion.”
There are a number of comic references here, particularly with the Rings and Luke Cage.  I think the story draws a bit on what I've read of Marvel Noir fic.  Steve guarding a naked Tony from a group of aggressors is an ode to that particular comic book panel that we all probably remember seeing.
“What’s she doing here? Get her out! Is this freaking visitor hour or something?” someone was shouting.
“You were, what?  Seven, I think it was,” Jarvis reminisced, leaning back in his seat as he dabbed at the corners of his mouth with his napkin.  “Yes, about that.  Tiny thing.  All eyes and hair, if you can imagine it.  Let’s see…my digital clock, the automatic coffee maker, that talking teddy bear, which was absolutely gutted, poor thing.  His mother’s CD player, the computer…”
It was quiet now.  Of course it was.  Everything was quiet here.  All the better to hear the machines.  Wouldn’t want to miss any of that completely useless information they were providing.  Tony was the only one who raised his voice in here.  Hell, maybe the only one talking above a whisper in the whole damn city for all he knew.  They all just stared at him when he did.  God help him, if someone patted him on the back and told him to hang in there again, Tony thought he might give Skynet a go just for shits and grins.
“You don’t want me to send you away,” the King said, repeating Steve’s words back to him.
Whoever lived here, however strange such a person may be and whatever their intent towards him, Steve couldn’t avoid the wave of pity that washed over him as he watched the little owl in its golden cage. How sad must it be to have your only friend be one you created? Would they be so driven to reach out that he resorted to something nefarious?  Would they refuse to help Steve? Steve hoped that wasn’t the case, but solitude created its own monsters.  There was no need for fairy tales.  Of course, none of that mattered if he couldn’t find whoever it was who lived in this strange place. The owl hooted again and clicked its wings once more, as Steve dropped his hand from the cage with a defeated sigh.
Not that he cared.
Steve turned and shook his head as much at the flow of information as Cam’s questions.
“Great. Thanks.  Good to know,” Tony said flatly.
He braced his hands against the bar, ordering a Vodka tonic for his client, “Stoli” on the tip of his tongue before just shrugging at the bartender and taking whatever he was handed.  He figured the guy wouldn’t actually be able to tell any difference.  He ordered an ice water for himself.  The woman at the agency had been very clear. Don’t drink alcohol while on a job.  And always make sure you got your own drinks or watched them be mixed.  It was rather scary that these were the protocols, as Steve could well imagine the reasons why.
‘It takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep.’—Clive Barker.
Tony leaned out of the bus shelter and glanced down the street for the familiar, brightly-lit shape, then checked his watch, quickly pushing his sleeve over the Hublot Big Bang. If the bus was on time, admittedly an unlikely scenario, he only had a few more minutes with Steve before this all came crashing down, because he would do a lot of things for love, but the New York City bus system…okay, so, yeah, he was going to get on a fucking bus.
“All to create this amazing little creature that walked around and would stop and turn on command,” Jarvis finished.
“He is gone. What does it matter the how of it?” Cam asked with a shrug. “I liked her. Ms. Potts.  She was nice. She gave me a jar of honeyed figs and said I could get more from the kitchens anytime I liked,” Cam added.
“Shhh,” Tony said, voice low.  He was suddenly there, right in front of Steve, hands rubbing at Steve’s arms.  That was good, Steve thought.  He stopped shaking. He hadn’t realized he had been.  “You’ve been so good all day for me. Can you be good a little longer?” Pleasure wound through him at Tony’s words.  Steve nodded.  He could do that. He wanted to do that for Tony. “Good. Take off your clothes. Then kneel there on the rug by the table.  Can you do that for me?”
“I should be getting back to SHIELD and leave you to it.  There’s a link in the letter to an Admissions packet with all kinds of information.  Some of it won’t apply to you, of course, and there will be some…adjustments, I guess you’d call it. Chaperones, when you’re attending class.  And you’ll have to live off-campus. No Alpha lab partners.  They’ll give you some flexibility on, ah, working around your—your cycle.  That kind of thing.  I’m sure Captain Rogers will talk you through the specific arrangements when he gets back,” Coulson said quickly, shifting a bit in his seat with obvious discomfort.  “Tony…are you sure you’re okay?” Coulson pressed with a frown after Tony didn’t respond.
“Thanks,” Steve said, taken aback not just by Stark’s offer, but the whole idea that the persona Stark presented was not, apparently, how he saw himself at all. And definitely not how he wanted Steve to see him. “Actually, I understand the whole playing a role and having it end up defining you thing pretty well,” Steve admitted. “I’m sorry.  I—I shouldn’t have judged you.”
“God, Steve…” Tony began, then just buried his head against Steve’s shoulder again, shaking it back and forth.  He didn’t pull out right away, just lay there for a moment, hands running up and down Steve’s body.  Finally, with a grimace, he withdrew, leaving Steve feeling limp and heavy and sore in that odd way that felt satisfying.  Steve waited for his breathing to return to normal and some semblance of feeling to come back to his body, before forcing himself to roll over.  Tony ran a hand over his chest, bringing it up to cup his jaw and turn his head to face him so that they were only inches apart.  There was something in Tony’s eyes that Steve couldn’t identify, but then Tony was kissing him, deep and long, and Steve stopped wondering about it, letting Tony’s tongue and mouth move over his with wild abandon.  He didn’t move as Tony’s hand snaked down to wrap around his cock, just turned off his mind long enough to let his body have this, as Tony worked his cock to hardness and then through the tremors as he came.  Steve let the sensations roll off him, just feeling the pleasure of Tony’s hand and Tony’s mouth.  He couldn’t focus on anything beyond that, reducing the world to this bed for the moment and his body liked that just fine.  He didn’t have to think about cold showers or scraping tar in hundred degree heat or whether his mom would ever be able to say his name again, could just let Tony take care of him and it felt so good, so very good, to just let it all go for a moment.
