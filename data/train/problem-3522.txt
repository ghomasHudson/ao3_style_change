He lies without thinking twice, he needed to keep his distance from her whenever possible. It wasn’t fair she caught him at a time in his life when he was lonelier than he had ever been. It had been over a year since he’d been with anyone. That had to be the reason why his body gave in so easily.
Dean’s cock strains against his jeans, God he might come from that voice alone. Cas had to know what he was doing to him.
What could Dean have possibly wanted to say? He abandoned him; he shoved him down. He possibly infected him with an incurable disease that wipes out thousands of gay men every year! Dean wouldn’t want anything to do with him at this point. He needed to let Dean alone for a while.
Dr. Carter waits a beat before speaking, “We’re going to run some more tests and monitor that as well.”
He signs off; Sam’s advanced to third and they scored another run. But the count is 3-2 and it's not looking good for Martinez. Big swing and a miss, strike three, the inning is over. Sam heads back to the dugout clapping a hand on a teammates’ shoulder.
Eileen leans in, “Yes! Anna told me they were both shouting at each other in Italian so fast she can only catch every third word. But apparently Francisco has a wife and four kids back home in Naples!”
“I’m done here.” Castiel turns to walk away but his newly acquired mascot feet get tangled up in Buddy’s and they both fall the ground. Buddy, half on top of him, struggles to push off anything attempting to stand back up. Which presently is Castiel’s diaphragm. Pushing out any remaining air from his lungs, Castiel shoves Buddy off him and rolls to his knees. Gasping for air inside his costume.
Now this was easier; with his mouth hot on her skin, giving in to the pleasure, forgetting just who it was he was with. He moves to the other side and sucks a red mark into her delicate skin; she moans, whether in pain or pleasure Dean doesn’t really care. His hips are grinding up to meet hers and the denim brushes between her legs, he can feel the heat of her bearing down on him.
Shit! He could have potentially invited a serial killer to his home. He could have ended up being on one of those true crime podcasts, where two women comb through the details of his grisly murder while they drink Pino!
She frowns and pulls the chart up on her iPad. “He’s stable but his liver and kidneys have extensive damage, common with long term narcotics abuse. He is on a ventilator because he lost consciousness in the ambulance twice and were still unclear about which drugs he was on. But it was most likely Percocet, it’s a common party drug.
Stuffing the fake head back on his own, he jogs up and out of the bullpen. Avoiding getting in anyone's way, a security guard lets him past a small gate, and he hikes up a short set of steps to the bleachers. Eyes scanning the crowd through his mask. He wished desperately he could stow it in a locker, but it would take too long.
Castiel pulls his jacket tighter around him and rests a head on the cool glass of the window, the vibrations make it impossible to fully fall asleep, but he rests his eyes for a while, replaying the events of the night before over and over again. He couldn’t think of a better way to pass the time.
Yeah he’s partied before; but it’s been mostly just edibles at Mike’s house. Lou got them like a gram of coke one time but that was a whole lot different than pills. He didn’t even know what they were!
“Castiel, that’s what you want to hear. What’s really going on?” Ketch leans over and puts a hand on the young man’s shoulder. Not so fun now that their nephew is visibly upset.
He needs an excuse to see him, to get him alone so they could talk. He has no reason to go by the apartment without an invitation though.
Smiling wickedly Castiel props up on an elbow, he doesn’t remove the finger but holds off on adding a second like he had been about to. Dean wasn’t calling for his safe word, but he was trembling with aftershocks, “I seem to remember telling you our night wasn’t finished just because you were.”
How was he supposed to know Dean would overhear his conversation with Eileen? If anything he should be mad. Dean had been eavesdropping after all!
“Hey! What about you huh? How hard have you worked? You didn’t grow up as some trust fund brat! You busted your ass to get scholarships. And you beat out all those other people for the internship at Netherfield. You deserve this Sam, you earned it. It wasn’t handed to you.”
They head up the stairs to the VIP area, her hand resting comfortably on his arm for support. Dean decides right then and there it’s time to meet this mystery woman. Fear of heights be damned.
His attitude in that regard probably jeopardized more relationships than he cared to admit. But luckily for him, and Claire, his initial reservations did not ruin the friendship she had made.
Dean is just closing up for the night when his phone blares out 'LYDIA’ into the quiet of the coffee shop. Frowning, he dries his hands and digs the phone out of his pocket, swiping the screen to answer just before it goes to voicemail.
Russian, okay Dean kind of assumed that too. That word he called him at the party, Moy...mal...chick. Whatever the hell that meant, he’d have to remember to ask Cas later.
Dean nods firmly, taking his own rather large bite, “Damn right. When they spring you, we’ll have to hit up Benny’s. Now that’s some damn good food, but it doesn’t exactly travel well.”
The waves of annoyance and disappointment are palpable in the tiny loft’s kitchen. He thought by now he’d have a better handle on this whole situation, but here they were eighteen months in, and he was still failing.
“Yeah well, it just hadn’t occurred to me.” Dean looks down and Cas can tell he’s not saying something.
He takes his hand again and draws it to his lips. Nibbling softly on Cas’s knuckles. “And besides, if you wanted me to bite you Cas, all you had to do was ask.”
“Yeah I wanna take you to bed alright.” He hiccups. “I want you so bad Cas.” He tries to brush up against Castiel’s crotch but misses.
His hand tightens on the glass, “I was asked to provide evidence that the claims were false or leave the firm. Since it was all hearsay and speculation I had nothing to back up my own credibility. Castiel however had his father’s reputation to stand behind.”
Dean has been shaking Castiel’s hand for a full 30 seconds. Just pumping up and down like an idiot. He pulls his hand out of that firm grasp and tries to remember how humans work.
“The owners of the team, did I tell you about them before? Ms. Bradbury, Mr. Lafitte, and Mr. Winches....”
They pass the kitchen and dining area; it looks as if Cas may use his table as a desk because there’s paper and binders all over it. A half empty cup of coffee sits next to a plate with a crumpled-up napkin and fork. Cas must have come must have come home last night after Dean left Pemberley.
Straightening up, he nods over to the reverend signaling he’s finished. Cain lays a hand on either of their shoulders, but Cas is so focused on Dean’s smiling face he can't be bothered to look over.
He brushes another kiss to Cas’s hairline, his hands running down the back of his jacket. Castiel hums into his chest, the sound vibrates in the space just above Dean’s heart, filling him with another generous helping of desire. He wanted to stick to his convictions, but maybe they could push the boundaries just a little bit more.
He hangs up the phone and slumps into the chair. Was he really going to do this? Would it even work? What if Dean didn’t come? What he was attempting was risky but if it worked... It was going to have to work, it was his last chance.
How did he let things get so out of hand? How could all his choices in the last year been wrong? He takes his phone out, forgetting that it's still dead and he curses. He needed to get back to the hospital, it’s been hours since he left Sam there.
“Castiel, we had no idea you still felt this way. We don’t think you truly meant to hurt Dean. And we don’t think you’re to blame for your brother’s choices. His choices Castiel, not yours.” Mick lays a hand on his shoulder.
“No,” he quickly turns to grab the bagels from the toaster, avoiding her already curious gaze, “that wasn’t business related.”
With a towel slung low around his narrow hips he makes his way to the bedroom. Sam literally pulled every dress shirt Dean owns out on the bed. He can’t even see his comforter and pillows.
He turns on his back and breaks into a private smile. He just couldn’t help himself! Cas was handsome as sin, all that dark hair and sex god voice just drove Dean crazy. And if he may have caught a glimpse (or 20) of Cas’s firm, naked chest walking to and from the shower, well that was nobody’s business but his.
A minute goes by and they don’t atttempt to move. Instead Dean looks down at Cas’s mouth and back up to his eyes. Cas can see the muscles in his jaw tighten. He runs his hands over Dean’s shoulders and down his bare arms.
“So, she bails on me, right? Takes off to Europe right after Christmas. There she met an heir to a very profitable winery in Italy.”
“You aren’t either of those things. So I’m wondering why your choosing them as your armor in this conversation?”
The front door opens, “Hi, oh hello. I um, didn’t know you were bringing... someone.” Sam sounds confused, Dean sets his cup on the counter and starts toward the hall.
For half a second he thinks it’ll be a security guard; here to escort him, and the giggling mess that Adam currently inhabits, off the premises. He quickly stands, not wanting to be thrown out from his knees.
“No, I have to go meet with my boss for just a minute. And after we’ll go watch the game. You’re big enough to stay here on your own right?” Jack’s eyes widen at the request, he has been on a Big Boy kick lately. Probably because his best friend Claire declared she was bigger than him because she was a BIG sister. That brought on a series of conversation of why Jack couldn’t be a big brother and how it was very unfair of Castiel to not give him a sibling of his own. Not caring that Castiel couldn’t magically produce a child or even had a partner to have one with. It was times like that he desperately missed Kelly. She would have known just how to answer the thousands of questions their sweet little boy had.
Castiel turns to walk away and luckily, he’s far enough to where he can only feel the brush of Buddy’s gloved hand on his arm. Unfortunately, when he turns, his brother is standing right behind him.
Dean briefly scoffs at the implication, but his face falls at the realization Emma might have had something to do with the fight. All eyes in the room fall to Emma. The young girl busies herself wiping her face, continuing to avoid their gaze.
There’s a collective sigh from the crowd at this statement, He take a minute to get his breath back and slides the ring all the way onto Dean’s finger.
Okay, he had a point there. Most mornings he grabbed a Poptart and to-go cup of coffee as he and Cas were headed out the door. On rare weekends he sometimes made them eggs, but Cas wasn’t much of a morning person, so he didn’t have the opportunity for something this decadent.
Dean knew Cas wouldn’t do that, but what he didn’t know was why Bobby hadn't told Dean either. And he was going to find out in a hurry.
Claire, who hasn’t said a word this entire exchange sets her cup down and rises, “You won’t be able to catch him. Not now that he’s beat you.” She turns to leave, and Agent Henriksen lays a hand on hers. His eyes are fierce with regret.
Popping into his office, he pulls out his cell and taps icon for Charlie. It takes about three rings before his best friend picks up.
“So um, you may or may not have kissed Castiel.” She says it all in a rush. Like ripping off a bandage.
He plants another kiss on Castiel’s lips, nowhere near as soft as the one he just received. He nibbles at Castiel’s bottom lip drawing a much more breathless sigh from him in the process.
“How considerate. Well Alastair’s just umm, I mean Mr. Wickham’s just freshening up. He should be out in a moment.”
Tonight was the night, he was going to ask Eileen how she felt. They’d been dancing around each other for months now.
“Dean,” Missouri interrupts, standing up from her chair and pointing casually towards the door, “Would you mind?” I need to ask Castiel a few personal questions.”
Another level of security, it kept the penthouse off limits to anyone curious enough to try and venture to the top floor.
Eileen shakes her head, “Sam’s not like that, he has the most affable disposition of anyone I've ever met. Castiel, you called him golden retriever remember?”
Dean’s leg is shaking so hard it jostles the car as they come to a stop light. Sam reaches out a hand to his brother’s knee. Stilling him momentarily.
Cas’s eyes widen again, but this time in recognition. Good, Dean thinks, now we’re all on the same page.
Castiel curses softly, he was almost on her side. She just needed one more push. She glances around the room and spies the remaining two Bennet siblings.
“Thank you.” Cas sighs, he knows he made the right choice coming here. But the enormity of the situation has him still uneasy.
His stomach churns, this is the most he’s said to Cas in one go since he woke up. And it was probably the closest to his true feelings as he was willing to say out loud. He swallows down the bile that’s been slowly rising as he was talking. Cas hasn’t said a word, hasn’t so much as nodded along like he got where Dean was coming from.
And it did, as much as he knew there was a mountain of briefs and depositions to go through. The time spent with Claire would diminish when she went to college in the fall.
Pamela stands up, “Okay, were going to end the session now. Adam you and Dean stay right there. We’re going to talk about this immediately, and do you know why that is?”
He looks up into those absurdly blue eyes, dreading his question might shatter the fragility of what had only just begun to form between them.
“Yeah, I gathered as much. Sammy, just because you’re working together again doesn’t mean she won’t be professional.”
“So, are you, um... in the locker room? I can hear an echo.” the pitch of Dean’s voice drops with the question.
“Sam, maybe it just wasn’t meant to be. Their world is so different from ours. You’d be fighting to fit in there, every day.”
Dean feels a grin tug at his lips, Sam was coming home. Today; Dean looks at the time, like right now! He scrambles up to get showered and dressed.
“Yes, and it’s been at least a dozen times. I just didn’t always specify it was the same person. It’s not just with me, she starts a lot of arguments among the students and teachers, I think it’s mostly to cause chaos but sometimes the things she says are kind of hurtful. I just didn’t want you to think I had a problem and try to solve it for me.”
“Dean!” Castiel shouts to be heard over the rain. Dean spins around, fists already tight at his sides. “I heard you came by the office.” Cas is standing under a black umbrella. He has that trench coat on again, but his suit looks warm and dry.
Joanna stands and fumbles the receiver in her hand. “Yes sir Mr. Darcy, my apologies Mr. Bennet.” She kind of curtsies and Dean struggles with whether to laugh in her face or storm off in anger.
Dean’s anger takes a sharp right turn into confusion as he processes Castiel’s words. His future? Could Castiel do that? And what’s more did he really want to know? Giving him no time to argue, Castiel continues.
Cas tilts his head back; he’s smiling but its less of the sex god smile from a minute ago and more the nervous single dad one that walked into the restaurant four hours before.
Dean cuts off the tirade with a shout, “Sammy! I already had Charlie look into it. We're all good. Now you’ve done your brotherly duty, I'll check in again in later, okay?” He hangs up without another word and stuff the phone in his pocket.
Calling all clowns!! Are you looking for a new gig? Do you own a red nose and big pair of shoes? Bring your act and as many friends as you can fit in your tiny car down to Hunting Grounds. Open auditions start Tuesday at 7:30 AM and go all day long! 401 Kansas Street – Be sure to ask for Sam!
“Yup, I already talked to your mom yesterday. I am officially on the list.” She grins and they all traipse down the stairs.
“I must have been on the way down, she called so long ago I thought maybe you changed your mind and went home. I was on my way to your house just now.”
He grabs Dean again by the elbows and helps him stand, crushing his mouth with a kiss, tasting himself on Dean’s tongue. Reaching his hands down between their bodies, eager to continue stroking Dean to his own orgasm, maybe he’ll get his own turn at sucking cock tonight, he finds Dean’s no longer straining against his jeans. Breaking their kiss, he looks at Dean in confusion.
He had felt righteous, defending their newfound friend. And if Castiel would have denied him that apology he most definitely would have threatened to kick his snooty ass.
He leaves Cas standing in his wake, with blood in his eyes and an ache in his heart he races out the door to the street. It’s a perfect spring day and Dean wants to jump off the nearest building.
A ride? Well, she was right, they hadn’t been riding since the fall. It was something their whole family had enjoyed; they had a few horses boarded at a ranch not too far from Pemberley. He had entertained a few clients that needed wooing, and Claire had even brought friends from school there to ride from time to time.
The entrance leads to a living room with chocolate brown leather furniture, there’s a fireplace along the far wall sandwiched between the largest built-in shelves Dean has ever seen outside a library. They must go up 9ft, there’s even have a ladder on casters off to one side! Each shelf is filled with books; some look to be a hundred years old, others are shiny new hardcovers. Dean itches to go over and pull volume after volume off the shelves but Cas’s walking away again.
Sam pulls out Bitch Face #6, “You know this is my normal time,” he says, tucking the newspaper under his arm he looks up and down the store front admiring Dean’s work, “Looks good man, what time is Cas coming over?”
“Charlie’s hiding something.” Dean tattles like a 7 year old. He doesn’t care how it sounds, she is hiding something from him. He can feel it.
Quickly he rushes back to a stall and hides while the door opens. Once he hears another stall shut he bolts out of the bathroom.
They pull up to an old brick house and step out at the curb. Dean opens the heavy iron gate and allows Cas to walk ahead of him. In the mid-August heat the grass is a lush green and the flowers are in bloom. There’s a courtyard with benches and a pond, and a willow tree shading the far side.
All eyes swoop over to Dean who has just shoveled in a whole mouthful of greens. He muscles them down and takes a sip of water to wash out any spinach in that may be stuck his teeth.
Eileen’s eyes twinkle behind her dark glasses, “No, Anna was completely bored with California after like a month, which is typical.”
Eileen begged him to go to that ridiculous after party, which consisted of the three of them and a few other couples from their respective offices. Then she pouted the entire time because that giant boy toy she latched herself to decided not to come.
” He cries out as he slips deeper into that tight, wet, heat. His eyes roll back far enough where he’s almost sure he sees the ugly comforter beneath them.
Adam’s heart is pounding like a drum; he’s sure the other man could hear it echoing off the black and white tiles.
“The property you’re trying to acquire, the last derelict house on Winchester street, is owned by Dean Bennet.”
The fragrant night air wafts in as they step out on to the front porch. In a flash Dean presses Castiel’s body against the doorframe, their mouths meet, their hands roam; and they don’t say good night for quite a long time.
The accusation clearly stings her as her smirking lips falter. He feels a small swell of vindication; at least he made one chink in her armor.
There’s about three dozen people spread out over the space. A fair mix of men and women, mostly his age or older. Sam looks to be about the youngest person in the room.
“Becky, I’m with you almost four nights a week. I don’t know how much more time I can give.” That was the truth, he’d been neglecting all his responsibilities for her. He had to drop everything anytime she called for fear she’d renege on their deal.
Adam jumps up from his chair, “You can't talk to Mr. Darcy, he made me promise! What if he takes back the money?”
“Castiel, just the person I was looking for!” As if he hadn't texting him to come up here? “I assume you know Mr. Uriel and Mr. Morningstar. He gestures to the team’s two owners who were sitting in a pair of low leather chairs, eyes not on the game whatsoever.
She knows how good she looks, she spent years cultivating the proper wardrobe for her coloring and body type. If it wasn’t so mechanical now it would have almost been fun to get dressed up for the party.
“I’m familiar with the product,” he grumbles, Jack was a fiend for grape juice. Something Castiel couldn’t stand, “what does that have to do with anything?”
It was 11:00pm on a Tuesday and Sam is still not home. For weeks now he’s been working around the clock. Dean can count on one hand the number of times he seen his brother home and awake since the promotion.
Beyond saving... what the hell is that supposed to mean? Yeah, sure they were probably filthy, but Dean could have had them dry cleaned if the washer didn’t get the dirt and blood stains out.
“Don’t ask again... please don’t make me do that again.” He whispers aloud to the phone in his hand. Willing her to leave him alone, just a little longer.
Cas lets out a loud moan and his head falls back against the pillow. Further and further Dean pushes till he can feel himself bottom out inside of Castiel.
Would he have made the same call when confronting Alastair? Probably, Dean was no coward but when facing a friend, even a former one, he couldn’t begin to imagine how hard that could have been.
Dean shakes his hand, his palm is cool and it envelopes Dean almost to his forearm. He feels a ghost of a touch run along the underside of his wrist and if a shiver runs down his spine well it was probably just because of nerves.
His knees bump the mattress and Castiel moves his body up on top of the comforter. Dean knee walks forward a little, his bed might be a king, but he didn’t want to take a header off the other side and cut their evening short.
Dean frowns. “Is that what we are Cas? Friends?” The hurt in his voice is enough to make Cas want to run the rest of the way to him. But he has to get this out.
And it may not fully encapsulate the entirety of his feelings but, with a brush of noses and intertwined fingers, Castiel sighs happily into his hunter’s mouth, “I love you too Dean.”
His insides clench at the look Dean’s giving him now, the humor transforming into lust before his eyes.
They both stand in the doorway for a few minutes, neither one speaking. Castiel waits, waits for the anger to take over. For Dean to snap under whatever pressure is building in the alcove of the doorway. For the punch to be thrown, for the door to be ripped from its hinges, for the bat against the wall to smash every window.
Quaking with exertion, Dean strains against the cuffs as he tries to seat himself more fully on the vibrator. It's only on the lowest setting, but Castiel had been massaging it against his hole for several minutes now and hadn’t yet pushed it inside. Already hard again, Castiel ignores his own erection, content with drawing more gasps and whimpers out of his good boy. He might even come just from the sight of his sub’s hole fluttering around the pulsating silicone head of the toy.
Lisa Braden... shit now he knew this wasn’t a prank. No way Charlie would tell a stranger about his awful breakup. They dated for over a year, come to find out Lisa reconnected with her college boyfriend, cheated on Dean, and wound up pregnant. His free hand clenches at his sides, it wasn’t that he was still in love with her, but it was pretty damn embarrassing to dwell on it almost six months later.
Castiel helps him change into pajamas and walks him to the bathroom to pee before bed. Once back in the bedroom Jack snuggles down under his blankets and clings to a stuffed dog that had belonged to Kelly.
Ellen runs the show. The kids, and her husband all fall in line. It seems like she remembers a hundred things at once. Moving from chore to conversation to scolding without breaking stride. She reminds Cas of a very loving steamroller.
Dean looks up, eyes shining, “You heard me, I said I miss my ring. The one you gave me... in here.” And he taps the side of his head lightly.
Okay so maybe the suit wasn’t that bad. Dean liked the way he looked when he got the jacket on and posed a little in front of the mirror. The shirt was cut a little tighter than he was used to but if he didn’t have to wear a tie he was happy.
Castiel blows out the breath he’d been holding, gently he uncouples their bodies and levies himself up. He buttons up enough to cover the good bits and smiles down at Dean spread out on the couch.
“Say what you need to say Cas,” Dean whispers, aching to reach out and take his hand. Knowing if he touched Cas he might never stop. He never wanted anything more in his life.
She glares at him; “You don’t scare me. And your lawyer boyfriend can't protect you. This house is getting sold.”
It had been like this for weeks; he would be fine and then a vision of Dean would overtake him, and he’d crumble again.
Dean can see from here that Sam was frustrated; he chokes up on the bat and digs a heel in the dirt.
Dean smiles wide as Castiel starts to sing. Almost like he’s won something. When the chorus starts Dean sings along with him.
“I don’t know Dean. This news from James has devastated him, he worried for himself, and even for the person James used to be to him. Even though that arsehole doesn’t deserve any pity.” Ketch spit out the last part.
With an echoing thump, Castiel’s book falls off the library table and startles him out of the dream. If he still had the power to smite, the offending tome would most certainly be a pile of ash on the floor. It's not the first evening he’s dreamt of their time in the Djinn world since returning home, but the false memory of their wedding night had never come up before.
Glancing back over his shoulder to make sure his daughter didn’t follow him to snoop he curls around the phone and whispers, “Hey Charlie, are you busy? I need a favor.”
“Sure, you were,” she scowls but there’s humor dancing in her eyes, “you’ve got five minutes to wrap it up or I'm calling your mother.”
“People would call him that, but most of the time they go along with whatever he says. His intuition is unparalleled and he’s usually correct in most situations.” Gabe leans in a little closer now, lowering his voice so only Dean can hear. “Recently he even helped save a close friend from a seemly bad relationship.”
She starts to walk away, but lays a hand on Dean’s arm, leaning down she whispers in his ear, “Dean if you don’t take that man home, I am calling dibs.”
A black Jetta pulls up with a little LED logo on the windshield. Dean shakes his head, how are three full grown men going to fit in that?
He frowns at this; they had been at the hospital over 24 hours, but it was still early enough where he knew visiting hours weren’t over. Plus, it wasn’t like he was just going to leave Cas alone. He'd have done the same thing if the situation was reversed. A thought, so absurd it just had to be asked, flits through his brain.
“Well, I'm a friendly guy Becky.” He counters. He needed to nip this jealous attitude in the bud right now. He did not need any Fatal Attraction moments in his future. Unfortunately, there was only one way he knew how to do that. Becky needed to be reassured of his “affections” for her.
“Seriously, you wanna share? There’s a whole empty bed right there.” But Dean’s already scooting and grinning from ear to ear.
It wouldn’t last forever, and he was still a little worried about the bank despite how close he was to catching up. But he’d dealt with her craziness all year, if she showed up again, he’d deal with that too.
He wakes with a start. The afternoon sun pierces his eyelids. Cas abruptly sits up and his body fights the sharp movement. His stomach recoils and his head pounds.
He can see Dean visibly relax as soon as they cross the threshold. His shoulders had been a tight bundle since coming to in that abandon factory. His mouth a jagged line of tension, a steel blade across his face. Dean clomps down the metal staircase; Castiel expects (braces for) a debrief of epic proportions. Sam certainly looks like he wants to know what the hell happened after their near silent car ride home. But Dean keeps walking, past the war room table and down the hall. It's only when he hears the slamming of a door that Castiel realizes he’s walked all the way to his bedroom.
Something flutters in his chest, at least his wasn’t alone. It felt like they’d been in sync on so many things, he didn’t know why it would have been any different with today.
There had been rumors of champagne and several players were going to hit up a new bar downtown. While he didn’t think Sam would partake in the latter, Dean might be inclined to drop by. He was full of energy from the win.
“I, uh haven’t got much feedback from them.” Sam suddenly gets busy straightening the salt and pepper shakers. Dean’s not buying it.
“Sam’s the man! That’s what’s going on.” Adam pats his brother on the back and sits back down to his video game.
A quick glance up at the windows confirms her statement, dusk has settled outside, and the streetlights have flickered on in the parking lot. With as much humility as they can muster, Dean and Castiel gather up their notes and stack the various books they’d been using.
If Dean had leaned in, just a bit further, while they were shouting at each other, he could have pulled Castiel right on top of him.
“Oh, you know how lawyers are, they can’t charge their brother billable hours, can they?” Dean laughs and the two of them laugh back.
He had truly done her a disservice by being so damn afraid. How many people would he hurt by letting that fear of falling keep him on the ground? He needed to set the record straight.
“That was my first time, but it’s a great place to meet new people. We just made a mutual friend in fact.”
He sets the beer on the table and grabs the box carefully with his hands, its warm enough that he yelps a little and tosses it on the table. Jostling Sam’s beer in the process.
The silky blindfold flies off and gets tossed somewhere off the side of the bed. Blinking into the dim light of the bedroom, Dean’s joyful smile widens like he might be about to speak, but Castiel has other plans. Taking the bottle of lube he had the forethought to grab while undressing in his free hand, he swirls his tongue from the base and up around to the swollen head of Dean’s cock and takes as much as he can in one gulp.
It seems like the entire population of Manhattan is passing them on the street. People running, walking, and driving by; all 1.6 million of them.
They had a bit of early summer this first week of May, the clear skies and fair temperatures were supposed to stick around the whole week. Dean and Ellen were thrilled, they dragged Bobby to the boardwalk every day. Not even to swim, just to stroll with their toes in the cold water, pants rolled up to their knees. But mostly just to enjoy the weather, check out all the little shops, or just people watch. It was so... relaxing. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he felt so carefree.
“And what are you supposed to be young man?” Meg sauntered up, her costume fit her like a glove, her witch’s hat cocked cheekily to one side. “A tax accountant?”
Claire butts into their argument, “Oh like you did at the movies? Do you even remember the plot of Spiderman, Castiel?”
He closes his eyes tightly and springs them open. He’s still there, in his underwear, laying on the most comfortable mattress he’s ever slept on. He pinches his arm hard enough to sting; it's all real. He really slept here with Cas, wait, where is Cas?
It does look like sleep, Cas isn’t on a ventilator, chest rising and falling slowly on its own. If Dean focused on the stripe of his bluish grey hospital gown, he could pretend his best friend was taking a nap, like he did sometimes on the couch of their apartment. If he didn’t look at Cas’s face, he could pretend a little longer. So naturally his eyes wander up to the bruises and bandages. The laundry list of injuries playing like a broken record in his ears.
“No, it can't be like that...” He whispers. He should have warned them all about Alastair’s past; if he had it may have saved his brother from...
Dean breaks the kiss first and he is still smiling, his eyes are shining with tears. His voice is hoarse. “Now that, was a hell of an apology Cas.”
His boyfriend’s face looks so open and vulnerable, as Castiel had only ever seen when he’d given himself over to submission. Silently pleading with Castiel to do something in this situation, but really what more can he do? He had no idea why Claire and Emma fought, whatever the reasons neither girl was willing to divulge the information. Even though something about the whole situation seemed off, he hated to admit it, the likelihood Claire started the fight was high. She'd been picking fights and causing trouble ever since coming to Lawrence. He knew she was still hurting, over the loss of her mother, the abandonment of her father; but he had no idea how to help her heal.
But tonight felt one hundred percent different from the last time he went out. He was unsettled; but he wasn’t sure why, and that pissed him off.
Plus he had just worked 10 hours yesterday, including helping rebuild a carburetor for a customer on the side. So ha! He did have an excuse for a day off.
“I know who he is Daddy, Sam Winchester already has a record 200 home runs for his career. He’s awesome!”
The door is wide open, and he can hear his mother’s laugh from the hall. There are a handful of people milling about. Jess, Joanna, Bobby, Ellen, Charlie’s girlfriend Stevie, and a young man with dark blonde hair. Probably Jo’s new boyfriend.
“It's a personal matter.” He says, desperately hoping that her manners will outweigh her curiosity and she’ll go get Cas.
He didn’t know it was possible to move the foam head that way, but Buddy cocks his head to the side in confusion. “I’m just trying to apologize!”
The raw innocence of that comment steals Castiel’s breath, was there so little joy in his life that one man made all the difference? Had he been so unhappy that even his son could see it?
They both bust out laughing at the same time, fully belly laughs with Cas holding his sore ribs and Dean slumping over on the bed. They're still laughing when the discharge nurse shows up ten minutes later with a wheelchair.
And for the first time since waking up here, he locks the door and the deadbolt with an echoing snick.
He stretches his bow legs out of the vehicle and whistles ‘Enter Sandman’ as he walks up the garden path. It’s Friday afternoon and Dean has the next two days off. It was a rare thing to have a whole weekend off from the garage where he works, but he was not about to question the sexy, steely eyed, redhead who made schedule. Mrs. MacLeod and her son ran a clean operation and he liked his work. No reasons to complain.
“You look so good like this,” Castiel pants heavily in Dean’s ear, slowing his own thrusts to watch Dean grind down on his dick, “I thought watching you fuck yourself on that toy was hot... but this; Dean I wish you could see what this looks like.”
Dean lets out a quiet laugh, “So it’s a contest now? Well, if my calculations are right it's been about 18 months. Can you beat that?”
“Yes, but you’re not going to want any of that, your stomach must be pretty raw kid.” Dean frowns, Adam's eyes are clear, he looks freshly showered, and he’s standing fully upright.
“Please,” He runs a finger from Dean’s clavicle down the center of his chest, sending a shiver through Dean, “please let me see you. Let me...”
Egging him on Dean snaps his hips down, grinding helplessly against Castiel, “That’s it Cas, come on sweetheart.”
Castiel desperately wished for a few more moments to compose himself after Dean’s emotional vows. Early in their relationship he knew Dean had been hesitant to share his feelings verbally. But after much reassurance on his part, it was like a spout had been turned on. Both prose and praise fell from Dean’s lips daily. Even after a thousand declarations of love, it never failed to humble him how deeply Dean felt things. Maybe it's what made him such a good writer. It was certainly why Castiel felt his own vows might be lacking in comparison.
“Yeah, we’re taking an Uber home. I’m too tired to deal with the subway.” Dean stifles a yawn; now that he’s coming down from the adrenaline rush he’s becoming more aware of his fatigue.
“Not in the time I’ve known you; your um... your brother found you on Facebook a couple years ago. But that was only to tell you...” he trails off. This wasn’t fair, Cas had put all this shit behind him a long time ago and now Dean was dragging all back in his face.
Just below the warmth of that kiss Dean feels the drag of bare skin on his back and the thought of Cas’s naked chest is enough to have him squirming deeper into the mattress. Cas’s fingers need into the meat of his calves and he’s unable to hold back a groan. Cas was clearly in the wrong career, and once he convinced him of that, Dean was going to be first in line for weekly massages.
“Now that’s a done deal...” Dean frowns. “But I think I’m going to have to look for a new place too.”
Dean scoffs, for one he was being super dramatic. And regardless, there was absolutely no rich boyfriend in his life. Dean had not heard from Darcy at all in the last month. Well, if you didn’t count the note that was attached to the suit from his stay at Cas’s apartment. It showed up two days after he stormed out of the police station. Hung on the front door in a white dry-cleaning bag. When Dean put the suit in his closet the note fell out the bag. He ripped it to shreds and flushed it down the toilet without reading it. There was nothing he possibly could say that would make Dean forgive him.
“I liked it fine enough, it was just too heavy to cart back and forth to school.” She holds the same serious expression as her old brother for about thirty seconds before bursting into a giggle. The image of this tiny girl dragging a harp around was enough to get the whole table laughing.
“You sort of just did,” Dean grins quickly, trying to lighten the mood but Cas’s frown only deepens, tugging at the corners of his mouth, “Cas you can ask me anything.”
Dean sighs at his brother’s puppy dog eyes. He was ready to call it a night but Sam, he looked so damn happy with Eileen Dean just couldn’t say no.
Yeah, he probably would, once Sam sunk his teeth into an idea it would be difficult to get him to forget about it. Maybe he’d be distracted enough with Eileen and their rekindled romance to leave Dean alone for a little while.
They eat in silence for a bit, Dean’s noticed Sam has talked about a lot of coworkers. But he’s left out one in particular. With what he knows of Cas’s influence on Eileen, Sam may not know he’s been fighting a losing battle.
wasn’t knocking on my door. And secondly, I knew it was you.” She points a finger up at the glass globe of a security camera and Dean’s anger dissolves into embarrassment in an instant.
Dean stares unblinking at him, Cas tries to hold his gaze but he’s losing his resolve the longer Dean looks at him. Maybe it was too late, he damaged his relationship with Dean beyond what a few kind words and an apology could fix. Misery threatens to consume his entire being and he needs to get away from here. He can’t bear for Dean to see how much he’s hurting.
Dean must have noticed at the same time because he curses and breaks into a run. Cas tries to catch up but once the other man’s face comes into view he stops dead in his tracks.
Castiel rubs his hands over his face in self loathing. The voice was right... But there was nothing more he could do about it now. He had already said yes and, thankfully, convinced Dean and Charlie to let him pick out his own costume.
Ten minutes later their ride shows up and silently they climb in the back seat. The city lights fade to black as Dean’s eyes slip close. Hopefully their driver is trustworthy, cause Dean’s ready to check out at any moment.
Castiel feels his heartbeat in his ears as he tries to look away. But Charlie spots him and drags Dean over.
The food looks like it came right off a Pinterest page, its beautifully plated and it smells amazing. Cas hopes his stomach doesn’t growl too loud. He was used to eating dinner on a six-year old’s palate and schedule. Which would have been mac and cheese, about two hours ago.
Dean’s mouth is as dry as a desert, his tongue heavy behind his teeth. Cas just told him to get naked, something he’s been wanting to do with him since about the time he heard his gravely hello in the parking lot of the ballpark. But now that the moment is here, Dean has no idea what to do. He’s trapped inside his body, screaming with joy but also nerved out of his mind. Weeks of phone sex, racy texts, and two (very brief) make out sessions had literally done nothing to prepare him for the look on Castiel’s gorgeous face when he said to lie down on the bed, on his bed!
Castiel’s heart does a slow flip in his chest and he sighs. This is going to be a lot harder than he thought.
With the last inning of the game upon them Castiel was counting the minutes (and strikeouts) till it would be over. The Angels were down by 4 runs and everyone in the dugout looked like they wanted to punch something. He just hoped he didn’t have a target on his back.
“Yes, but as time went on it became clear you were fighting the effects of the spell as much as I was.”
Even with the help of the toy, Dean is still unbelievably tight. He pauses inside him, cock head just past the rim. Holding back the urge to bury himself to the hilt; to just take, and take, and take till this want coursing through him is sated.
Cas pulls him forward abruptly and plants a rough kiss on his lips, Dean’s eyes slip close, tears running freely down his face. The salt of them mixes with the sweetness of Cas’s lips. There’s a loud clearing of a throat to his right and his eyes flutter open to the grimace on Cain’s face.
“No, he won’t, in fact were going to have a long talk at home about running away.” Jack shrinks down as his dad’s voice changes to stern.
A bitter laugh rattles against the window over the sink, “Yup, I knew you’d be bailing on me sooner or later. Everybody does, right? Why would you be any different?”
Okay that was true, Cas was a real bastard sometimes. And it was rare for him to do something he absolutely didn’t want to do, but this was his health! Surely, he would listen to reason. He had to listen, if he didn’t and something happened...
She whirls around, her eyes are filled with tears. “Because, I’m sick of seeing you wallow in despair! God Dean it’s been weeks. I’ve never seen you this depressed over anyone, ever. It’s starting to scare me.”
“What did you have in mind?” Cas exhales, picking up the phone and bringing the speaker to his lips.
Dean slots his chin over Castiel’s shoulder, his hands come up to brush along his back. They stand there in the twilight that has slowly surrounded the porch, neither one speaking for quite some time. Eventually Dean sighs and relaxes in their embrace.
He points behind him to where the man at the desk yelps, tosses down his paper, and busies himself with something at his computer. Cas laughs a little louder now; the rumble in his chest radiates out warming Dean down to his toes.
He plants a kiss, warm and inviting on Cas’s neck and the other man sighs, leaning back in to Dean’s body with his own. All of Dean’s glands sit up and take notice.
“I know the furniture is a little fancy, but Mr. Balthazar’s rentals all come furnished. Or so he says. Anyway, he also said anything you don’t want he can have some guy name Uriel come pick up for storage. Guy was a total prick when I called about a weird angel statue so think real hard if you don’t want something.” Dean’s rambling again but Castiel grateful for more time to calm down.
“What is the difference, between two dicks and a joke?” Dean asks the question in a much more seductive voice than he had before, his eyes land on Castiel, holding him to the spot. He's burning up, the heat he felt just watching Dean, laughing at his ridiculous jokes is too much. Dean licks his lips and Castiel bites down on his tongue to keep from moaning.
Now, lying in his bed with the early rays of sun peeking through his blinds, he can privately grin to himself about how well Dean took to his commands and the growing attraction between them. He had never met a sub quite like him; brash, funny, warm, sexy. Dean’s personality was so unlike the partners he’d had before, it was too early to feel this way but in the quiet corner of his heart he knew it would be so easy to fall for a man like Dean.
If he was being honest, Castiel was right. He wasn’t that upset, yes at the time it had been a fucking travesty; but after the fight when he finally got on his own, he realized he was never really in love with her. He was in love with the idea of her and while he did care for her, it always felt like he was settling. That there had been something more out there for him, just out of reach.
“Speaking of the ladies, I was just back in the dressing room and you would not believe some of the filthy jokes I just heard!” Dean comically whispers behind his hand, shielding the noise from whoever may be backstage. The crowd cheers again and Castiel can feel a smile tugging at his lips. Dean’s energy is magnetic, his voice pulling Castiel in deeper into the act.
Heat rushes up the back of his neck, “Oh I wasn’t going to hit on him. I was supposed to meet someone, and I thought it was him.”
“I didn’t miss that tone one bit Castiel.” And he turns to go. “Oh if you’re after a shower I suppose you’ll need this.” He tosses Cas’s travel kit at him.
Benny chuckles at his friend and downs his beer. “Here’s an idea... lower your standards. Next round’s on you mon cher.”
Cas’s eyes pop open and shift over to where Dean leans on the door jamb. He sits up a little straighter in his bed and adjusts the blankets.
Dean frowns at the man behind the desk over to Castiel, really looking at him for the first time since their bump in the hall, “Cas, you're not just gonna let him get away with this are you?”
“Thats great, I miss you.” He really did; it was kind of lonely sleeping in Gabe’s guest bedroom. He missed Jack crawling into bed with him in the early hours of the morning before work. Jack telling him about all his dreams from the night prior.
Dean scoops his daughter up out of the chair by the elbows and starts leading her to the door, “Come on Emma, let's go.”
“No jacket! Get out of my closet, I’m a grown ass man!” This was getting ridiculous. “I can dress myself...” he mumbles. Dean frowns at his reflection in the steamy bathroom mirror.
And that’s probably close to 40% true; he was going to tell Cas about the help Dr. Carter had offered for home care. But truth be told he was never going to really phrase it as an option. It wasn’t one, Cas needed somebody there. And because Dean couldn’t be there himself, a nurse was the next best thing.
But he was getting spending money somehow. Certainly not from Dean, but every now and then he let it slip he had bought a new video game (the Xbox since released from jail in the Impala’s trunk), or he grabbed food on the way home from school. Maybe he found another sucker to mooch off.
“I am, but I really like her Dean. I just thought, maybe, we’d have a chance together.” He frowns again and trudges off to his room.
He sits in silence for what seems like hours, never stirring as to keep his sibling resting. A light knock on the door rouses him, and a doctor peaks her head in. Dean puts a finger to his lips and motions her back out the door. Once outside with the doors closed softly behind them, he wipes the tears and fatigue from his face. She smiles gently at him; she looks tired too. Her chop of grey hair looks like she may have been leaning on it and she has a sleep crease down her cheek.
He sniffs as another tear leaks out, “Sorry, I know that’s not fair. But I just... I don’t know what to do. And if you don’t...”
It’s the most honest she’s ever been with him, and he knows she’s right. He’s building this up in his head to be the worst thing ever. But when he thought about it, he’s had sex with strangers, was this really so different than that?
“Look, it’s just a meeting. Ms. Collins said she had new information about the land development and wanted to meet in person.” Sam’s voice is calm which only makes Dean more anxious.
He and Adam have a shouting match so bad one night the kid leaves and doesn’t come back for two days. He called Mike, Lou, anyone he could think of in a panic till Adam came strolling in the door. He looked defiantly at Dean, daring him to ask where’d he’d been. Dean doesn’t give him the satisfaction. He unplugs the Xbox and locks it in the trunk of his car instead. Maybe that will teach the brat a little respect.
He walks to Cas’s bedroom and looks out the front window. Snow was falling softly and the moonlight made it sparkle around the courtyard. People are already starting to head in for the party and he can feel the thump of music though the floor.
“Nothing important,” Dean quickly pulls his hands out of his pockets, willing the flush to keep from giving himself away in front of Emma. “You cutting class already? Its barely the start of the semester.”
Humming non-committedly he spreads an inhuman amount of cheese on her bagel (just the way she likes it) and a much lesser amount on his own. He will not blush talking about Dean, he’s a grown man. Not a schoolboy with a crush for Christ’s sake.
He shoves his hands in his pockets and closes his fingers around the phone. Dean was being a real prick about that too. It was just a phone, no need to get all self righteous about it. Dean was on his phone plenty! It was just when Adam used it he had a problem.
The muscles of his lower back and lats received the same treatment as his shoulders; the oil smells like vanilla and chamomile, the warmth from Castiel’s expert hands drawing more of the scent over his body. Fingertips brush the waistband of his underwear and despite being stupid relaxed, Dean’s dick twitches against the sheets he’s pressed into. But the hands quickly recede and land on his calves, a whine catches in the back of his throat.
Cas never smiles like that at home. Yes he smiles; he even chuckles when Dean makes a joke or forces him to watch Caddyshack for a third time (Dean I just don’t see what so funny about the groundskeeper?).
Castiel hums in agreement, his body already succumbing to sleep again. He plants a kiss in Dean’s hair as his eyes slip closed. Their breathing slows to a gentle rhythm, hearts keeping time as the exhaustion takes over. The last thought Castiel has before falling off the cliff; isn’t how did he get here, but where was he going?
“Go ahead, Henriksen.” He nods to the other man. Castiel takes a deep breath, bracing himself for the news.
Just a reminder this chapter is NSFW - there are no plot points here so if its not your thing that is okay. Stick around for the next chapter coming up later this week!
Thank you all so much for reading, and your lovely comments. It's inspired me to expand this story far more than I had initially plotted.
Bolted? Hell no, why would he do that? Just because Cas was maybe a little rusty when it comes to first dates? That was no reason to leave... unless his excuse was something like he’d been living in the desert and just escaped from a cult. But it probably wasn’t that.
The familiar southern drawl picks up on the second ring, “Hey brother. What can I do for you on this bitching cold Saturday?”
“Hmm,” Castiel hums and breaks off a piece of chocolate, “I would have thought you’d learned your lesson about being a brat tonight. Seems I was a little too quick to let you off the hook.”
A flicker of movement catches his eye and he sees their mascot flailing around on top of the dugout. Clarence the Angel, as he was called, waved his blue arms wildly at the crowd. It was the most ridiculous mascot Dean had ever seen.
“Relax honey, I’m not going to give you the third degree about your intentions with my son.” She smirks.
If it had been anyone else he would have pressed a kiss to those spots. Lingering over each till the other was breathless. Hot little whispers of what he like to do when they could be finally be alone. Teasing his partner right there on the dance floor.
Castiel feels Dean snake an arm around his shoulder and he tries very hard not to lean into the touch.
“No, we were very much in love.” He smiles sadly, “I dated a few men and women before meeting her. But I always felt like I was drawn more to people’s energy than their gender. It’s hard to explain.”
He glares at her. 4th place behind a retired doctor and a 17 year old girl? He’s irked at himself for being offended.
Nodding Castiel picks up the cock ring, watching Dean’s eyes track the motion like a hungry animal. But his lustful expression falters when Castiel takes the ring and stretches it around his own already half hard erection. Tucking the second ring under his balls, he silently welcomes the constriction it brings. Normally he was very vocal about the things he was going to do during a scene, he loved the way his sub would writhe over every filthy suggestion, but that reward was for good boys, and tonight Dean was going to be kept in the dark a little longer. It was clear from his face, Dean had no idea what he had planned, all he could glean from this was that Castiel wasn’t planning on coming any time soon. Little did Dean know, neither was he.
He flops back down on the mattress, he doesn’t want to get out of bed. He doesn’t want to do anything. If he does stuff he starts thinking, if he starts thinking then he’s thinking about the world as he knows it collapsing around him.
Dean scoots his own chair back and moves closer to his side of the table, “Well for one thing, it’s a freaking hotbox in here. Lose the jacket Columbo.”
What if his next roommate was a slob? Or a neo-nazi? Or slept walked, naked?! He was just so screwed...
Now, back in the yard, he can do nothing. He can only sit and cry, like the babe his father said he was, and wait for the midwife to come out and tell him he was too late. That they were both gone. Tears drip hotly from his cheeks onto the dirt at his feet, as he swallows back a sob. He needed to be brave now, for his mother. He needed to be strong now, for his father. He needed, he needed...
The movie’s over, the popcorn and champagne has been put away. Cas is handed a fresh glass of wine and told to sit back in the family room. Dean heads out to the garage with his Dad to check on a problem with a carburetor or something.
“Oh very,” He smiles politely at both of them. Dean tries to shift out from under the bulk of his not so little brother. But Jo plops down on his left and they are all smushed into one half of the couch.
“I don’t want to be alone right now...” he lets the implication hang there between them. Castiel pulls back a little and his eyes widen at realization. Dean’s cheeks burn, he made a mistake, it was too late. He lowers his head again willing his tears to stop. He screwed everything up, yet again.
Cas takes a few steps forward. “DEAN! Put him down!” This time his voice does rise over the sound of Jo screaming, Crowley laughing, and Dean cursing a blue streak at “this asshole who thinks he can just park his ass on someone else’s
“I still can't believe they want that trash.” She snorts and heads over to the coffee maker to get it brewing,
“Right, Well after I apologized and explained why I was still staying with my uncles something happened.” Cas is unsure how to proceed. He knows why he lied to Dean. But he felt truly guilty about it. And maybe needed another perspective.
“Eileen huh? Didn’t know you two were on a first name basis. You looking for a little extra credit Sammy?” Dean sticks his tongue in his cheek rather crudely and barley has time to dodge the swipe from Sam. The younger man’s reach a little longer than Dean anticipated. He jumps back from the table, as Sam’s chair squeals on the scarred linoleum floor.
Dean shouts as the new angle nails his prostate, his head thrown back and his throat bared wide for Castiel to lean down and take his fill. Licking and sucking along the hollow of his collarbones, Castiel adds his teeth to the equation and draws another chorus of delicious whimpers from his lover.
He stops to tamp down the emotions swirling inside him, Cas didn’t need to know just how much that intervention had meant to him. How, without it he’d probably be dead. How the thought of not being there for Cas had crippled him, dried up every ounce of alcohol in his blood. The fear in those sad blue eyes staring down at Dean where he lay broken and bloody on the concrete after another bar fight gone wrong. It had been enough to pull Dean out, to grip him tightly and raise him from the pit of his own self-loathing.
“I’m fine. Just waiting for my brother to finish up.” He waves a hand behind him and his voice, concrete wrapped in velvet, sucker punches Dean right in the gut.
“Fine, you know what? I need some air anyway.” He pushes off the bed and wrenches the door open. Stopping in the doorway he turns back but Cas is still facing the window, refusing to even look over at him.
“That makes sense; no rushing. We take our time.” And as much as Cas want to crawl right into Dean’s lap he knows it’s better this way.
Dean is crying openly now and Cas can feel his own tears spill over. That brave little boy, Cas can’t imagine what it must have been like. How scared he must have been. Dean’s breath hitches in his chest and Cas can’t take it anymore.
“Anna, I assume you only have two motives for whatever it is you’re up to. Either way, I would only interfere.” Castiel’s deep voice echoes through the room.
“Can you pretend to be an adult, for five minutes?” Dean yanks his arm down before he can get a selfie in.
Castiel quiets his apology with a soft kiss, his lips are warm and inviting. And they taste like his toothpaste. Something about Dean taking the time to at least rinse the dregs of sleep from his mouth before coming in the kitchen thrills him. He was so far gone over this man; it was a little pathetic.
Cas steps forward again, struggling to speak, “Dean I... I have... I have feelings for you, strong feelings.”
The audience roars as Rowena smiles knowingly at them, Castiel can't help but sneak another look at Dean and to his surprise he sees him covering his face. He looks mortified and Castiel can practically see the blush on his cheeks from here. His cock twitches appreciatively in his pants, the thought of Dean blushing from head to toe while Castiel worships his naked body is enough to have him adjusting himself under the cover of the tabletop.
“I said I’d be up, plus you know you’re not allowed to touch the pies. You’ve been banned remember?” He points at her sternly but chuckles thinking about the first thanksgiving they had together. She forgot to peel the sweet potatoes before hand. They all choked it down but the following year had store bought. At least till Dean was old enough to use the stove.
“Dean, you don’t understand. I am centuries old. I may be a man in flesh and blood, but I'm still not entirely human. I’m not -”
There’s a moment before he answers that Dean knows Castiel is weighing his options. Whether or not he trusts Dean enough yet, in the early days of their relationship, to tell him the problem. To let Dean in... he holds his breath, anticipating the lie. There was no way Cas was going to come clean.
Dean scoots up all the way on the big bed now, the blankets are soft and an inviting. He tucks his legs under the sheets and pats the bed next to him. Another eye roll and Castiel walks around to the opposite side. He climbs in and sits next to Dean. They stare at each other, something needs to happen, or Dean is going to jump Cas, deals be damned.
“We’ll be lowering his pain medication later today, he needs to start waking up or he may not be able to.”
Taking the concrete steps two at a time he spies a dark-haired man sitting on the ledge below him. He’s kind of slumped over, which is concerning. Dean moves to the far end of the stairs, and sort of peers around him to catch a glimpse at his face. He looked sober, probably just waiting for a ride. But Dean needed to do his due diligence. The guy could be a creep waiting for some young woman to come out alone. If the guy bolted, Dean would know he was up to no good.
“We’re not exotic dancers,” the man adds with a hint of an accent and his deep baritone goes right to Dean’s cock. The rumble of an engine sounded like a kitten compared to Castiel’s voice. Dean feels himself go a little weak in the knees thinking about that voice, and all the things it could say to him in the dark.
His paralegal passed him some intel and he had a suspicion she bribed one of sellers. He just didn’t know if he could prove it.
Wiggling around to face him, Dean grins widely at the Dom, “Hell yeah I did! What, couldn’t you tell from the three orgasms you gave me?”
“Alright, I'll catch you tomorrow. I still need to swing by with Baby for some parts.” Dean tucks the phone under his chin as he steps into a pair of navy boxers briefs.
“Cas...” he starts, but nothing feels good enough. He spent his life crafting words and they all fall flat on his tongue.
Coffee forgotten, Dean leads them over to the couch and wraps a throw around her trembling shoulders, “Is this about the fight yesterday?”
“I’m offering you time. Time to get your finances in order, to get out of debt with the bank. I can give you at least 8 months, maybe even a year.”
“I don’t care,” Dean cuts him off, sitting up further in bed, “You could be smoke, or stardust, or celestial light and I still wouldn’t care. You are the only thing – the only person – in my life who’s made me feel like this. I don’t want to spend another night without you.”
Dean doesn’t know what to believe anymore but he knows he was wrong, his pride had been hurt. And it caused him to say things he may not ever be able to take back. He’s on his third pass through the letter, fingers absently tracing the heavy script, when the front door opens quietly.
He’s about to object to a less silly word when the doorbell rings; it looks like nougat will have to do.
Letting Cas look him over, he makes himself as open and vulnerable as he can be. God this is going to hurt so much later. Dean knows what he looks like but can't help but wonder what Castiel sees, as he’s presumably looking at Dean for only the second time in his very short memory.
Sam blushes and turns to go. Dean sees Castiel come up beside Anna and she whispers something to him while looking straight at Dean.
Castiel places a hand on his shoulder, palm flush with the meat of it, “Do not fear. It will be minimal and not likely your own.”
“Oh please,” Claire snorts, “like I could keep these two apart even if I wanted to. You’ve seen them together, right?”
This time Cas does have to look down. He knows what he needs to do, what he needs to say so Dean can start to forgive him. He takes another step till they are arms distance apart. Somewhere a clock is chiming. And he hears the crowd inside start to countdown.
“She just left to go get your food, but you can go wait in the cafeteria for her. It's up on the sixth floor. Have a nice lunch!” She calls as he backs away slowly to the elevator. Maybe Becky had another guy on the line for something and double booked? Hey if he could get out this, all the better right?
She turns around and without another word leaves the office, pulling her coat on as she steps out on the sidewalk.
If you’re reading this you know what happened or you skipped ahead. Do I think Dean was forced? Not in the sense that would warrant a rape tag. It’s my opinion that while he didn’t want to have sex he still did, and he’s still accountable for his actions. The next chapter makes more mention of their sexual exploits but not in as much detail as this one. And I double pinky promise we’re going back to more of the P&P plot lines. This was a detour, not a change in destination.
He pauses to take a drink, but Dean can see he’s struggling for composer. There’s more to this story than a failed marriage. Something much more.
Anna had done that very thing, but still it should count that he danced with someone other than Dean.
Fortunately, Adam’s turn was about to start, and it was the last one of the night. He still looked too thin; in the time that had passed since his hospital stay Adam had to have lost over ten pounds. Whether that was from the withdrawals or the crappy hospital food Dean wasn’t sure. But regardless even if he had managed to put back on half the weight, Dean remembers how unnerving it had been to see his brother’s gaunt cheeks and hollow eyes when he was first discharged.
“Well it’s great to see you, right Dean?” She elbows him in the ribs hard enough for Cas to feel it himself.
“CASTIEL!” She springs up, no doubt to strangle him by his tie. He holds up his hands for peace and she slumps back into her chair.
“Fuck Cas,” Dean bites back another moan, “I’ve been waiting all night for you to get your hands on me.”
Lips ghost along his jaw line, while that thumb continues to just press at his rim, “Do you want to come now?”
Chain mail heavy across his chest, twisted around the arrow that shot him through below the left collarbone. Dean lies in the dirt, struggling to take a breath deep enough to stop the gasping wet sounds coming out of his wound. Men are screaming all around him; frightful, bellowing sounds over the clash of steel. A noise he now heard in his sleep in the seasons since he left home.
She claps a hand over her mouth to hide her smile, but she can't hide her shaking. He glares daggers at his sister as her shakes turn to laughter and before he can strangle her, she’s cackling like a mad woman.
“I should probably say hello to the other department leads. Just to get some credit for coming ya know?” Sam’s already inching away and Dean suspects he may have spotted the object of his affections somewhere in the bar.
In this small of a space it does feel like they’re intruding. Their chairs bump as they all try to quietly cram into the seats.
Dean moans around the head of his cock and takes Castiel deeper into his mouth. His tongue is hot and wet, Castiel takes his other hand and traces the faint outline of his cock through Dean’s cheek. Eliciting another hum of arousal from Dean, Castiel’s hips lurch forward of their own volition. Fucking deeper into Dean’s mouth.
“Oh, Castiel I finished that book you let me borrow, will you remind me to return it before you go?” Claire turns to her brother.
“So why is he calling now? How did he even know where you lived?” Dean tries to cull the fear from his voice, but Cas looks so upset he’s having a hard time.
What he meant to say was do you mind if I step out for a moment? But before he could finish, Dean pulls his chair incredibly close. Knees slotted in between his thighs, Castiel can only stare as the other man boldly starts tugging at the knot on his collar. Their faces mere inches from each other, Castiel feels the warm brush of fingers under his chin as Dean works. But while Dean watches his hands and the ever-loosening tie, Castiel watches Dean.
Jerking awake, Dean stifles the scream that tried to follow him out of his nightmare. His chest heaves, black spots forming before his eyes at the lack of oxygen.
“You have an IQ of 123; just pick something and go home.” He mumbles to himself. That was the problem though, his logical mind was preventing him from making a frivolous decision.
“Dean, I had a great time tonight.” He smiles genuinely now, there’s still a little fire in his eyes but it seems cooler now.
“I was going to stop in the other boxes first, say hello to some sponsors. The insurance guys are here tonight you know.” Charlie comments.
Either way, Castiel knew the moment has passed and whatever spell was between them is now broken. Presently Dean’s looking everywhere but Castiel’s direction, suspiciously enthralled with the late 80’s style grey/green carpet, so it seems likely he will be choosing the latter. Cursing the librarian and her ill begotten timing, Castiel shoves his loose tie in his pocket and silently flees towards the door, not waiting for Dean to follow.
Pulling on a light grey thermal and his leather jacket, he grabs his duffle bag and heads out. Waving to several people as he makes his way to the parking lot, he stops at the top of the steps and looks back over the field. The score still blazing up on the board across the park, flags flying in the cool April breeze. A perfect end to a near perfect day.
Dean perks up at this, it’s been a long time since he verbally sparred with Cas and enjoyed it, “Only half a dozen? I’ll have to make up for that tonight.”
“Can I come in? I was hoping we could talk before everyone gets here.” Cas can barely meet Dean’s eyes.
Of all the people he thought to protect from Alastair he never considered Dean and his brothers. How would he have known, they were total strangers.
Dean tiptoes down the stairs later in his stocking feet. Sam’s in the kitchen drinking a glass of water at the sink.
Jack gets up and Castiel follows him down the hall. Dean folds up the deck of cards, picking Jack’s up he spies two yellows, a red, and a blue. But no green, that was odd, maybe he just wasn’t paying attention. He packs up the game and sets it back in the drawer he saw Cas pull them out of before they got started. A few minutes later Cas returns to the living room, glancing backwards towards the bedroom.
With his left hand once again free, Castiel scoops up another fingerful of his seed and shoves it back in his mouth. Dean’s lips close around the fingers automatically and he sucks, all while his body clamps down around Castiel’s other hand, “Do you like being filled up like this Dean? Maybe next time you can fuck yourself on that toy while you suck me off, hmm?”
They sit in silence watching the History Channel for a few minutes, Ellen’s humming around the kitchen and the smells of ham waft into the living room. Dean settles deeper into the sofa; he could get very used to this. But something was missing, he looks around the living room.
“It can still be the same amount of time; I just meant see you differently.” She’s being uncharacteristically coy and while its might be the loss of blood to his brain, he cannot think for the life of him what she’s talking about.
Massaging the spot he slapped, Castiel lets up a little on the hold he has on Dean’s back, “That’s right. Now, may I continue?”
Dean lets go of Castiel’s hand, backing away from the garage like a skittish animal. Castiel watches him go; waiting at the door till he’s around the corner and till he hears his feet on the stairs. Only then does he shut the garage light off.
“I think your dear Joanna was calling for security when we arrived.” Anna laughs casually from her position on the floor where she’s turned Dean’s quick departure into some kind of yoga stretch.
He sticks his tongue out at her and turns back to restock bag of coffee beans. Their relationship was not a typical father/daughter dynamic. Dean felt that Emma thought of him more like a big brother or uncle than a dad. She rarely took any shit from him and sassed back at every opportunity. It was so far from how he grew up, parenting his brother when their dad couldn’t, he felt lucky to be a part of her life but not the primary parent for once.
The day after Halloween, the day you called him a drunk and told him you couldn’t forgive him. No, that’s over and done now. This is not the time for that.
That wasn’t entirely a false statement. Now that the moment had arrived, he was a little nervous. Dean was going to be in his house, seated at the dinner table in a matter of minutes. His pulse trips up under his skin at the thought.
The hand on Dean’s back pulls him a little closer. They’re practically nose to nose, did Cas always smell this good?
On the lobby’s faded green carpet rest four battered office chairs and a small receptionist desk. There’s no one sitting at it and the door behind the desk is closed.
“I don’t even know what time it is.” Dean confesses. He has been too wrapped up in the letter and the fight with Cas to even notice Adam wasn’t here.
Dean rounds to corner in time to see Eileen, in a pretty summer dress, stepping over the threshold with Castiel close on her heels.
Cas’s tongue is in his mouth; and it feels freaking awesome. It feels better than anything he imagined all those time he thought about kissing Cas.
Adding a hint of teeth to his ministrations, Castiel removes his free hand from Dean’s hips and slides up his chest. Still a little slick with lube, from when he used a finger to open Dean up during his first orgasm, he twirls the wet finger around a nipple, teasing it to a tight peak.
He pauses, and Dean can see her start to tremble, “What I mean is, I don’t want to just have dinner. I want to be with you, exclusively. And... damn the press, and the bad PR, and the headache it all brings. I think we’ve played it safe long enough don't you?”
He tosses his bag in the trunk and climbs in the driver seat. Reving the engine, inspiration strikes him, his earlier nerves vanish as he sends one last text to Cas.
“I won't keep you in suspense if that’s what you’re asking,” Carter smiles, it's an odd expression. Almost like he didn’t do it frequently and didn’t quite know how to use it, “the results are promising. Your swelling has gone down in almost all areas. And there’s been no other evidence of new bleeds. If it goes down further, we’ll be able to schedule your ankle surgery with Orthopedics very soon.”
Castiel mulls that over a moment, Dean had a point about all the random coincidences in their lives. It's true, they may have eventually met, but it was Sam’s actions that finally brought them together. But that did not mean he agreed with his methods in the slightest.
VIP, really?! Dean looks down at the black badge with the same red broken heart logo. Guess Sammy’s more important than he let on. But from the equally surprised look on his brother’s face it doesn’t look like he thought much of himself either.
“Well I still own it today, you need to get out of my house.” Deans voice doesn’t waiver but inside he’s shaking with fury.
With Castiel’s warm breath on his face, Dean rolls his eyes affectionately, “And what if I want all parts of you, hmm? How many of those beautiful feathers do I need to hold to have all of you?”
“Isn't that what you just told me? You said you were afraid, and this house, all your responsibilities were just an excuse.”
The crowd is still standing as a fiery redhead in a long sequin gown makes her way to center stage. She picks up the microphone Dean left behind and raises it to her lips.
“You weren’t supposed to hear that conversation.” And Dean swears he sees Castiel’s face fall a little.
“Only if you’ll be on my team sweetheart.” Dean smiles up from his now empty cup and leans over for a kiss which Castiel returns with pleasure. Never tiring of the way Dean’s mouth molded to his own like it was made for him.
“Yes, but she’s on the Amalfi Coast for at least another month. And if I’m going to book something it should be now.”
“Enough about me, you need to start talking. And eat one of these date things, I've had them before, they’re freaking amazing.” Picking one up he pops one in his mouth.
“Right, you know me... Is Becky here?” How did he walk into another nightmare with a receptionist? It was like a curse or something!
His tone is meant to be teasing, but Dean shakes his head in frustration, “I know, just need a second.”
Dean shakes his head and flips open the box, pepperoni, bacon, red onion, and green pepper. He takes a long sniff and sighs. “No worries Sammy, Dr. B wanted to have a little private convo with me after the group left.”
“Yes, Anna’s behavior today was... upsetting. She was most likely trying to get a rise out of me. She does that, often.”
“Now, I think we’ll be able to sort out what’s bothering you. But I am going to need 100% compliance from you with no arguments. Is that amenable to you? You can speak.”
His sub wails as he clenches down on the vibrator, Castiel just needs to give him one more push and Dean will be coming harder than he had before. He clicks the final switch on the toy that sends a pulsating burst up through his ass.
Anywho... next week we get to the bottom of the girls fight. There will be tears, there will be swearing, and there will be copious amounts of coffee.
A voice cries out in ecstasy through a crashing wave of pleasure, drowned out only by rushing beat of wings unfurling in the night.
“Secondly, I’m going to take summer classes to finish my GED. Which I didn’t complete because of the choices I made.”
But now that she put the doubt in his mind, how did he really know that was Castiel’s name and business? Anyone could get cards printed online with whatever they wanted. He had his own stack with Hunting Grounds logo on it for when Sam wrangled him to industry conventions.
“Well that’s bloody perfect after the way he’s treated you, bastard.” Ketch is up again and pacing. Predictable as a sunrise.
“Dean, I wouldn’t offer this if I couldn’t do it.” She sits up a little straighter and Dean knows right then she’s done this before. And she’s gotten away with it.
It tugs at Dean’s heart to think Adam could be up on that wall one day, he hopes it will be in a recovery photo. But dreads that it could be the latter. He buries those fears down deep, Adam was going to be fine. He had to be fine.
He could do whatever he wanted... But what did Sam want? Was he going to move out? Sam was only still living at home because he couldn’t afford to live on his own. But now, he would only get promoted again, make even more money.
“Uh, yeah, go for it,” Dean says, even though they should probably wait a bit longer. He can’t focus with Cas standing that close. He can see all the little lines around his eyes and the way his hair is curling softly around his ears. The slope of his neck is incredibly distracting. Dean wants to put his mouth there. Wants to scrape his teeth along the line of his jaw. Cas leans in to pour the eggs in the pan and Dean shivers.
“Yeah.” Dean gently shifts Miracle to the side so he can take the plate from Sam. Underneath the current of his nausea is a clawing hunger. He wonders how long he’s been out. “What happened?”
Cas rolls off of him and places a kiss on Dean’s shoulder before going to the bathroom. He comes back with a warm cloth so Dean can clean himself up and then they both crawl under the covers. They arrange themselves on their sides, face to face with their legs tangled together. Dean traces a finger over Cas’s eyebrow and cheekbone, then down his jaw, like he’s tracing a backwards ‘three’.
Sam looks visibly surprised, like he was expecting Dean to go off on him for making a decision based on information the rest of them didn't have. And that creates a churn of guilt in his gut that threatens to unseat the last mouthful of whiskey he swallowed. He never wanted Sam to be scared of him the way that Dean had been scared of John. He worked so hard to protect him from that and it was looking like he'd failed. Failed like he had at so many things.
Cas brings his eyes back to Dean’s face and leaves them there this time. Dean’s never seen him look so uncomfortable. Or terrified. He needs Cas to get down here, now, so he can talk to him properly. They’re due for a conversation that’s been over a decade in the making, but they can’t have it with Cas lingering uneasily at the top of the infirmary stairs. Sam, for once, reads the energy of the room and starts up the stairs.
Later—after a lazy day of cards and Christmas movies, after Eileen makes them model their new socks and ties, after turkey and potatoes and pie, after drinks that leave them pleasantly buzzed, after Dean has divested himself of the tie Cas insisted he wear so they could make use of both Christmas-themed sets—Dean and Cas have the kind of uninhibited, joyful sex that leaves them both laughing with elation.
“Sure you do,” Jody says. “The best thing you can do is just be there for him. And I already know you’re good at that.”
“Not to be a jerk, but I’m kinda glad to see you’re in as rough shape as I am,” Jody says. Her voice has more gravel than usual. They drank
They need to slow this down. Dean is about to go off like a rocket. This’ll be over before it’s even started and Dean will never get over the mortification. He gets his hands on Cas’s hips and stills them, pushes him back just enough that he can no longer feel Cas’s erection pressed against him, hot and distracting. Cas blinks at him slowly and lets himself be pushed. His eyebrows gather into a furrow as disappointment falls over his face. Dean kisses him to let him know they’re not done yet.
Cas smiles back, and it’s a little sad around the edges. Dean should ask him about that, but he’s too worried that he’s the cause of it.
Cas puts back all the ties except the one with the flamingos, then continues his browsing. He ends up settling on just one other tie, another navy blue one, but this one is printed with constellations.
Jody always feeds them extremely well whenever they find themselves in her neck of the woods, so Dean wants to pull out the big guns, and once he gets Beef Wellington into his head he can’t let it go. He finds a recipe that includes green peppercorn sauce and potatoes to go with it, and sets to work in the kitchen.
Dean and Cas and the weight of everything spoken and unspoken between them, because for everything Dean said in his prayer to Cas, there was even more that he didn't. There's a confession burning under his ribs that's been there for years but has been threatening to engulf him since he found Cas under that tree by the rift in Purgatory. Since he took a knee and prayed that Cas could hear him. He thinks he would have finally given voice to it, too, if Cas hadn't stopped him. If they hadn't been seconds away from being trapped in Purgatory, again. If he hadn't been worried about Sam.
“You mean burning some food?” Sam says, amusement playing across his face. He looks like he’s about to laugh.
He forces a smile and tries not to stare at the aforementioned bed. Calling it a double would be generous. It’s going to be more than crowded. Dean doesn’t know how they’ll fit without spooning.
Cas still has his hands on Dean's face and he tilts him closer so he can kiss him. They stay like that for a bit, just making out and hitching their hips together in a steady little rocking motion that causes the tension in Dean's pelvis to build slow and steady. He's so close. He's been close more or less since they started. He can tell by the way Cas is losing the rhythm that he's close too. He keeps breaking their kisses to gasp out these little bitten off groans that go straight to Dean's dick. Dean had had different plans for them. Plans that involved the lube in Cas's bedside drawer. But he knows he won't last that long now. And he wouldn't want to pull away from Cas long enough to grab it anyway.
Dean wants to kiss him again, but he doesn’t think he’s quite ready for that. This thing between feels too fragile and new to be putting it on display just yet. He squeezes Cas’s shoulder instead and Cas gives him a soft smile that’s just for him. Dean’s heart trips in his chest.
Of course, Cas notices. Dean is sitting stiff as a board with his arms crossed and a good two feet of space between them. He keeps glancing over at Dean, but makes no move to close the distance between them. He looks terribly unsure of himself. Dean
"Dean," Cas says, interrupting an impulse to touch that Dean was about to give into. "You've had an incredibly difficult life filled with traumas most people could never even begin to imagine. I would be surprised if you weren't angry."
"You seen Cas?" he asks once he has his esophagus back under control. He has to work hard to keep his voice even, to keep it casual. Not that Sam would notice one way or the other in his current state.
“I wanted to make you breakfast,” Cas says, sounding so thoroughly defeated that Dean wishes he could go back and ask the question a different way.
“It looks like you got this first part handled,” he says. “Get crackin’,” he can’t help adding, and slants Cas a goofy little smile that he has no control over.
All at once he remembers exactly why he loves Donna so much. Everything is easy with her. She takes people as they are. Takes Dean exactly how he is. Weird food habits and emotional baggage and all. No judgement. It’s more than Dean could ever think to ask for.
“He tried,” Cas says, then busies himself fussing with the bedsheets, tugging them back and then straightening them to ease out the creases, maneuvering around Dean like a trained nurse.
Cas collapses on top of him. They’re both breathing hard. They’re sweaty and sticky, but Dean finds that he likes the weight of Cas on top of him. He can feel Cas slipping out of him and Dean wraps his arms around Cas’s back, like that might counter the strange, unexpected sensation of loss. Dean kisses him on the temple, the shell of his ear, his shoulder. He tastes like sweat and skin. Like Cas.
Dean reaches for Cas’s hand and eases his fingers apart. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, just that Cas looks tense and Dean wishes he didn’t. He wants Cas to know that he’s in this. They both have to get better at talking to each other, but this is something Dean can do to show him. He can uncurl Cas’s fingers and bring his mouth to Cas’s palm. Cas looks like he might cry. It’s shockingly intimate. So much so that Dean nearly startles himself out of it, but then Cas is reaching his other hand to Dean’s face, cradling his jaw and sweeping his thumb over the skin beneath his eye. Dean has to squeeze his eyes shut and swallow.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean is breathless with anticipation. He gets his hands back under Cas’s shirt, but this time he lifts it up over his head and tosses it aside. Cas does the same to Dean, not as smoothly, a little more frantically, less practiced, and that reminds Dean that Cas has never really done this. Not with someone he cares about. Not with someone who would care enough to treat Cas properly.
After Jody leaves, the rest of the day passes quietly. Cas continues the cataloging project with Sam while Dean and Eileen team up to clean the kitchen. By the time Dean makes his way back to the library, Cas has retreated to his room. He thinks he should give him a bit of space, so Dean hops in the shower hoping the hot water will wash away some of his more virulent anxieties. It works better than he thought it would.
"We'll find another way," Dean says. It's a party line that's never really worked in their favour, but he figures the law of averages has to give them a win eventually. Why not now, at the end of the world, yet again?
Dean scoops up another forkful of eggs and holds it up for Cas. Cas eyes him warily and then leans forward. He chews thoughtfully as Dean tries to pull himself together, having nearly come apart watching Cas’s mouth. He swallows and meets Dean’s eyes.
. Sam is the first and most obvious choice, but he’s also not a choice at all because no way in hell is he talking to his little brother about his sex life (or lack thereof) with their angel best friend. It’s one thing to try to gross him out on purpose with his various sexcapades and another thing entirely to have a serious conversation that involves emotions he can barely say out loud to himself. Sam had already tried cornering him to tell him that he was happy for them. Which had been fine up until the point that Sam’s expression morphed into something altogether too serious and sincere, and he said, “You know you could’ve told me that you—” Dean cut him off before he could finish and took Miracle for a walk to escape the bunker. He can’t talk to Sam about this.
Dean swallows again, willing his voice to work. “Without Chuck,” he repeats. “Not without you.” He reaches for Cas again, twisting a hand in the lapel of his coat so he can drag him forward. “Not without you.”
He looks up when Cas doesn't say anything. He's frowning at Dean, surprised, like Sam, over Dean's lack of anger, but also genuinely confused.
“Want to grab more eggs from the fridge?” he asks, turning to Cas. “I’ll show you how to make perfect scrambled eggs.” There’s already a bowl with a fork sitting in it coated with an eggy film, so Cas at least got step one right. “And some milk,” Dean adds.
Eileen laughs at something Sam says, drawing their attention. She signs something that Dean doesn’t quite catch, but Sam says, “Eileen,” in a scandalized tone, so Dean knows it was something dirty.
That admission startles Dean's attention away from Cas' wrinkles. He huffs.  "You woulda done better than me, I'm sure."
“You’re stuck?” Sam demands, sounding personally offended by this development. He and Eileen had gone up to Jody’s ahead of them, along with Mom and Jack, while Dean and Cas wrapped up a routine salt and burn just outside of Lebanon.
It shouldn’t be a turn on. It is, though. It’s such a turn on that Dean considers smashing his elbow against the counter again to stop his dick from getting any ideas while his brother is standing right in front of him. Heat rushes to his face.
It’s ridiculous. Dean’s guilt had become a living thing for days after Cas was swallowed by the Empty, lodged up under his ribs getting at all the parts those bones were supposed to protect. And still he can feel the words catching in his throat, sticking there even when he doesn’t want them to. Years of repression don’t just go away overnight, he guesses. He never thought this was something he could have. He still isn’t sure that he can. He’s having a hard time ordering his thoughts into words and the effort of holding back tears is only making his headache dig in even harder. He’s going to have to sleep again soon, but he needs to say this first. Even if Cas hadn’t meant what Dean thought—hoped—he had. Even if Cas has changed his mind in the wake of a future neither of them ever thought they’d get. Dean clears his throat.
Not two minutes later Cas hisses and swears as he burns his mouth, causing him to jolt, drop his fork, and splash his hand with hot broth. Dean reaches for the cup and takes it from Cas so he can’t burn himself some more. Cas immediately sucks the burned finger into his mouth and Dean almost fumbles the noodles. He puts them on the bedside table before they can do anymore damage.
against the mattress. Dean wraps his arms around the dog’s warm, wriggling body and buries his face in the fur at his neck.
Despite all his weird and unexpected hang-ups about the sexual aspect of their relationship, this is easier than he ever could have imagined. Holding Cas’s hand feels natural. They fall into casual touches like it’s the most normal thing in the world when they’re kicking around the bunker. Dean finds he can’t stop touching him. A hand on the small of his back, his mouth pressed into Cas’s shoulder, fingers dancing up the back of his neck into his hair. He’d feel overly needy about the whole thing if Cas weren’t just as generous with his own touch. If they’re in the same room, it’s only a matter of time before one of them has a hand on the other. Every time it sends a thrill through Dean’s limbs. That this is his life now.
It must show on his face because Cas immediately adds, “And before you say anything, this is not your fault. My grace has been fading for a while now. With everything that’s happened, the number of times I’ve been essentially remade, it was really just a matter of time.” Cas pauses. “In any case, I wouldn’t change any of it.”
They stare at each other for a moment and Dean steels himself to ask the question that’s been nagging at him, the one he’s been terrified to ask, “Cas, what exactly
Dean works his way through a rapid series of emotions. His face flushes in a war between embarrassment and arousal at Cas saying the word ‘sex.’ This is followed by a swoop of relief that he immediately feels guilty for because the only reason they’re in this predicament is because he can’t bring himself to just use his fucking words. He doesn’t deserve Cas.
“Great,” Dean says. Which, okay, it’s a lie, but his headache is mostly gone and he managed to eat some of the leftover french toast and bacon while he and Jody played poker, so compared to an hour ago he does feel great. “Nothin’ a little coffee and aspirin couldn’t fix.”
Cas has been human for about a month now, as far as they can tell. His fading grace simply gave up the ghost one day and never returned. Dean still isn’t sure if that makes him human, exactly. Isn’t sure how much beyond hunger and exhaustion he has to contend with in the way of bodily needs and functions. Dean’s driving himself out his mind wondering.
Cas gets his hand under Dean’s shirt and digs his fingernails into his skin just enough that he can feel it. Dean rolls his hips. This is finally going to happen. Dean lets his other hand trail at the waist band of Cas’s jeans, fingers dipping under the band as he brings it around to press flat against Cas’s belly, teasing at the trail of hair that disappears into his boxers.
Dean doubles back, thinking better of grabbing a beer, and makes his way to Cas’s room. He knocks gently on the door.
Sam shakes his head in amusement. Cas doesn’t see this because he turned to look at Dean, as soon as Sam said his name. He looks at him so fondly, like he’s pleased just to be in the same room as him, that Dean suddenly doesn’t care at all if Sam finds them amusing. He doesn’t care at all if Sam sees him walk over to Cas, hook an arm around his waist, and plant a kiss on the corner of his mouth. He’s prevented from a full kiss by the stack of books Cas has tucked against his chest.
“Yeah,” Dean replies distractedly. His attention has wandered to Cas again, who’s now sitting on the edge of the bed staring at the motel phone with an uncomfortable hunch to his shoulders.
Dean rubs a hand over the back of his neck. He glances at her and that brief look is enough to tell him that she’s not letting him get out of this. He lets out a sigh.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean swears. He pulls his foot off the gas and grips the wheel as Baby skids over a patch of ice.
Dean busies his hands tracing over the cut glass patterns of his tumbler. “We, uh, we haven’t...you know. Yet.”
He leans over and puts a hand on the back of Cas’s neck, rubbing his thumb into the corner of his jaw. “You should go to bed.”
Dean lifts his head and glares at his brother. Jody at least looks a bit sorry to have interrupted them.
“It’s a pretty scary thing, getting everything you want.” Jody gives him a sharp look. She has a way of hitting on exactly how Dean’s feeling and putting into words in a way he can’t. It makes him feel slightly less embarrassed and inept about the whole thing.
Dean nods and Miracle lets out a low whine to make sure he didn’t forget about the walk that was promised.
Dean takes a bite of his sandwich, finally, to avoid the worried look on Sam’s face. As he’s eating, he’s hit with another piece of a dream or a memory. He really hates that he can’t tell the difference.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says, hand reaching for the back of his neck. “I died and I got to heaven and Bobby was there. He told me you and Jack rebuilt heaven. Harvelle’s Roadhouse was there, and Baby.”
When Dean wakes the next morning, Cas is no longer in his bed. This isn’t unusual, but as the events of the night before come back to Dean in a sick rush, he immediately wants to crawl back under his covers and not re-emerge for ten or twenty years or maybe ever. He keeps being clobbered by the irony of the fact that he’s going to mess this up precisely because he’s terrified of messing it up. It’s pathetic, is what it is, especially when he knows the solution is simply talking to Cas.
Dean steadies himself by pressing his palms flat to the table and taking measured breaths to quiet the blood surging in his ears. It does nothing to calm the jittery adrenaline spike caused by thinking Cas had left. Again. He feels the way he does when they pull all-nighters guzzling sludgy gas station coffee and energy drinks, jagged around the edges and a little bit sick.
They stop for breakfast at a diner a few miles up the road and still make it to Jody’s in just under three hours. Everyone’s there. Jody’s new house, it turns out, has more than enough room to sleep all of them.
“I’m so sorry, I was so concerned with healing your impalement wound that I didn’t think to check for head injuries,” he says.
“Yeah.” Dean shakes his head and downs the rest of his bourbon in one shot. It burns all the way down and he immediately pours himself more.
“C’mon, man, you’ve got the whole wide world of ties available to you in here!” he sweeps his hand in front of him as best he can while still holding a bag of clothes. “Have some fun.”
“Okay, bacon first because it’s going to take longer.” Dean rips into the package and starts laying strips across the pan. “Low and slow is the rule for bacon. You can lay the strips right next to each other because it’s going to shrink as it cooks.”
The whole venture takes long enough that when Dean gets back to the room Cas has showered and changed out of his fed suit. His hair is wet. He’s wearing a pair of sweats and an old t-shirt of Dean’s that he’d borrowed back before they got him his own wardrobe. Dean didn’t realize he still had it. Cas is sprawled on the bed flicking through the limited channels on the TV. He has one leg stretched long in front of him and the other bent out sideways, his knee taking up a good portion of what is to be Dean’s side of the mattress. Dean absolutely does not look at his crotch.
As they make their way inside, Dean finds a ‘Happy Birthday’ banner strung up in the living room, complete with streamers and balloons, and a pile of gifts on the coffee table. He’s overwhelmed. He seeks out Cas’s hand and doesn’t let go. This earns them a few knowing looks, but no one seems particularly surprised either.
He’s not in the library, where Dean expected him to be. He ends up finding him halfway up the stairs, dressed in a coat and hat, a scarf wound around his neck. He’s holding the leash and Miracle is already at the door.
anyone. The closest he ever came was with Lisa, but that had always felt like borrowed time. It had never truly felt like his. The threat of his old life always hung over them, ready to sink its teeth in. And it had. But now? Now he might actually get to have this. He wants it so badly that part of him wants to turn and run in the other direction. He’s never wanted anything this badly in his life. He’s never let himself. It’s terrifying. It’s exhilarating. It’s making him nauseous, a bit, with anxiety.
“Wait, hold on,” Sam says, turning back to the tree. “There’s another one under here for both of you. It’s from Claire.”
, and impossible to forget, because Dean’s constantly battling with his impulse to press Cas against the nearest flat surface and kiss him with everything he’s got.
Dean holds up his socks for Cas to see. Cas smiles wide enough that his eyes crinkle at the corners.
He hardly knows what to do with his hands. They’re shaking as he runs them down Cas’s chest, over the thin fabric of his borrowed t-shirt (Dean’s t-shirt), then back up the curve of his ribs, thumbs skating over his nipples making Cas release a sharp noise of pleasure. “Dean,” he breathes, and Dean kisses him. He brushes their lips together lightly and works his hands under Cas’s t-shirt so he can rub teasing circles around his nipples without any fabric in the way.
Cas dumps the entire pan of eggs onto one plate like he’s going to get away with not trying them. Dean lets him think that for a minute, shaking some salt and pepper over the eggs before digging his fork in and taking a mouthful.
Cas brings the requested ingredients to the counter. He also brings the rest of the bacon and Dean can’t help but smile at that. Cas sets them all down and looks at Dean, who pushes the bowl towards him.
“I wanted you to have a chance to live your life,” Cas says gently. “To figure out what you wanted without Chuck, or the affairs of Heaven and Hell coming down on your shoulders.” He stumbles over the word ‘heaven’ and Dean realizes he’s lumping himself into that category.
Beside Dean, Cas squirms, which somehow pushes him even more firmly against Dean’s side. Then their knuckles bump together and Dean startles so badly he almost jumps. His heart picks up to a frantic rhythm in his chest. He keeps his eye trained on the screen, where the male doctor has now surfaced from between his partner’s legs and is tugging her forward as he shoves his pants down. Dean tilts his hand, lets his fingers seek out Cas’s, and Cas takes the invitation. He laces his fingers through Dean’s and squeezes. Dean might have an actual goddamn heart attack. The couple on screen pant and moan until the fade out and Dean’s hand tightens convulsively around Cas’s.
Beside him, Cas braces his arms on the dashboard—a bad move if they actually crash, but Cas is only recently human again and probably hasn’t thought past not wanting to go through the windshield.
“What?” Dean repeats in disbelief. He crosses the room because he can’t continue this conversation with Cas out of his reach. Dean takes Cas’s face in his hands. “I don’t want that. Why would you think that?”
“That’s what you two get for drinking all the bourbon,” Sam says, with all the force of his overgrown lungs.
“Seriously, you guys, again?” Sam says, when he enters the kitchen and finds Dean tucked up against Cas.
Cas returns with a smile accompanied by a confused furrow, like he knows he’s missing out on a joke. It’s so familiar and so
Cas frowns down at his hands for a moment and then properly looks at Dean. “You know we don’t have to have sex tonight if you don’t want to.”
Arousal courses through Dean, swift and hot. He can’t help the way his hips twitch forward, pressing the hardening line of his dick against Cas’s hipbone. Cas gasps and tugs at Dean’s waist, hitching him closer. Their kisses grow sloppy and wet, desperate as they clutch at one another trying to get closer. And it still isn’t close enough. Cas’s hands slide over Dean’s ass and Dean groans, mouths across Cas’s jaw and down his neck until he can get his tongue in the hollow of Cas’s throat. Cas tilts his head back with a soft gasp of surprise and rocks his hips forward, guiding Dean into a grinding rhythm with their dicks riding together.
They both let the silence stretch. It could be seconds. It could be minutes. It could be an hour. Dean can't be sure because even with everything left unsaid, it's a comfortable kind of silence, so unlike the silence that's been hanging between them since Chuck. Since Jack. Since Mary. So Dean lets it stretch and lets the comfort of it settle him.
Cas looks away first, back down at his hands still clasped together. "I can't say I was particularly confident in my ability to bear it," he says.
Dean settles in more firmly against Cas, makes sure he can still see the laptop screen, and lets himself relax into it for maybe the first time ever. If this is freedom, Dean can't wait to do it for the rest of his life.
Cas mimics his movements, a bit clumsily, and then looks to Dean for approval. Dean doesn’t have to see his own face to know that the smile he’s wearing is impossibly fond. He tries to school it into something less embarrassing and is pretty sure he fails.
“I’m just gonna—” he says, pointing at nowhere in particular. Then he whistles at Miracle and says, “Let’s go, boy.” Miracle takes one last longing look at Dean’s sandwich and leaps from the bed.
“So let it cook a bit and then start pulling it away from the edges to let the uncooked part run over,” Dean says, determined to continue with this lesson.
