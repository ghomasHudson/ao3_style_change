The sight of the warm bread coming out of oven in that episode caused his stomach to rumble and his mouth to water. He paused the episode and quickly researched bread recipes he could try. After some speedy googling, John came across Paul Hollywood’s Cottage Loaf recipe. Skimming it, it seemed relatively simple. They had most of the ingredients – John googled if butter could be substituted for lard. It could. – and it didn’t require any fancy equipment. He could definitely do this. Which is how Sherlock discovered him in the kitchen, having sanitized the table within an inch of his life, half covered in flour.
“John, wait.” Sherlock reached out and grabbed his arm. “Why are we suddenly preparing for the apocalypse?”
Mycroft’s watchful eyes never left John’s face. “Brother mine, I do believe Cook has prepared your favourite biscuits today. If you would be so kind as to fetch a plate of them from the kitchen.”
“Daddy, I miss you!” Rosie hung on to the end of Sherlock’s arm, as close to John as he would allow her.
She turned back to him and nodded. “Okay.” She skipped back to his side and slipped her hand into his.
John nodded, looking at the pavement. He shuffled his feet a bit. “I know. And believe me when I say I hate it. I hate being away from you both like this. I’ll do my best, okay?”
Letting a smile back onto his face, John relaxed into Sherlock, head resting on his chest, just listening to his heartbeat. “That’s fine by me. I’m here and will be for quite a long while yet, my fiance.” A chuckle escaped him. “My fiance. God, that sounds good.” He rubbed a soothing hand up and down Sherlock’s spine. “Let me know when you’re done processing.”
“Good idea, genius.” John clapped him on the shoulder before walking with him to their front door to get his shoes and for Sherlock to get his pants.
Sherlock huffed and shot a glare in his direction. “Why are you like this today, John? Whatever it is on your mind, go take a walk and come back when you’re capable of existing quietly.”
Sherlock stood and clapped his hands. “Right. Watson, let’s go get you dressed. We’re going outside.”
John rolled onto his back and looked at the ceiling. “No. No, of course not. It’s just always easier to take care of it myself.”
“I merely wanted to offer my congratulations to yourself and my brother upon your partnership.” Mycroft held a cup in Sherlock’s general direction. Sherlock failed to look up from the book until John nudged him and he hummed and stretched out his hand, still not looking up. Mycroft sighed and placed the china cup into Sherlock’s fingers. “I do hope your both are adjusting well to your new life statuses?”
“And what do you know about how relationships work, Sherlock?” John snipped back at him. “You’ve never been in one before.”
“You have been ridiculed by nearly everyone you’ve ever met, you have lost your home and your reputation, you have been tortured and killed and tortured some more.”
Sherlock took him in a moment before sitting on the sofa next to him and settling close, opening the book on top of both of their legs, his excitement with the publication re-appearing. “This is the original Hungarian text in which he illustrates the importance of hand-washing. Have you heard of Semmelweis?”
John shoved at him with his shoulder again. “It’s just the truth. All the shit you’ve gone through in your life. And you still seem to bounce right back.”
John carefully placed a light amount of oil into another bowl and rubbed it in with a paper towel. He then gently plopped the dough into the bowl and covered it with a tea towel. Setting it on the table, he cleared and cleaned the table of the ingredients and the mess he had made while kneading the dough. Once that was clean, he set a timer for – checking the recipe again – three hours. He closed his laptop and rubbed his hands together. That was all he could do until the dough rose. He looked up to the doorway to the living room and saw Sherlock leaning against the doorframe, a smug smile on his face. John rolled his eyes and reached his hand out to him. “Come here, you.” Sherlock folded into his arms like he was created solely to be held by John. John smiled as he hugged him tightly. “Could eat you right up.”
John tensed. “Did they say something to you? Was it that new Lieutenant who’s been swapping off with Donovan? Sean… something?”
Sherlock nodded and settled further into his chair. “She painted today, which was such a nuisance. It took me an hour to get all of the paint out of her hair.”
Three hours later found both men lying in their bed, the sheet tugged loosely overtop as they slept. Hair awry and lips swollen, Sherlock’s head was tucked just beneath John’s chin, ear pressed to John’s chest, soothed by the audible heartbeat, calm and steady. John’s arm was flung around him, keeping him close. Suddenly, a loud beeping blared throughout the flat, emanating from the kitchen. John startled awake, jerking into a sitting position, tossing Sherlock off him and onto the bed. Sherlock woke with a pitiful whine. “John!”
“I’m sorry. I am truly sorry I haven’t been as communicative as I should be. I will do better, alright? I promise.”
Sherlock’s phone rang, making John freeze. After fumbling in his dressing gown pocket, Sherlock produced the device. “Speak quickly.” As he listened to Lestrade’s response, Sherlock squeezed John’s hand and gave him a small smile, his eyes sparkling. “We’ll be there in ten.” Sherlock hung up and leaned over to plant a kiss on John’s cheek. “A case, John! Get dressed!” He lept from his seat and ran into the bedroom to change.
“Don’t come in here.” John held a hand out to him and gingerly picked his way over to where Sherlock was standing at the edge of the kitchen.
Sherlock’s lips twitched, remembering the section she was referring to, when Alec chased the black horse across the beach in an attempt to ride him, only to eventually lose the horse, unable to catch up with him. An elaboration of tag. “Ah, of course. Very well.”
“I think we both do.” John stood and went into the kitchen. “If you’re still hungry, you can keep eating.”
Sherlock collapsed back onto the bed, gasping, his hands trembling slightly as he pulled the sheet back and John crawled up his body before falling onto the bed next to him, breathing heavily. A thin sheen shone on his lips and Sherlock leaned over and kissed it away, licking into his mouth before pressing kisses to his lips and down the side of his face along his cheekbone. His hand trailed over John’s chest. He murmured into John’s skin as his hand trailed lower. “Can I?”
Sherlock exhaled slowly before reaching down, grasping the door handle and swinging open the door. Sherlock’s eyes swung from the bags of groceries had been set on the doorstep neatly to his husband standing on the sidewalk near the curb, a grin blossoming on his face. Something welled up in his chest and he couldn’t help the massive smile taking over his face. He took a step forward before stopping himself. “John.”
A tightness formed in Sherlock’s throat. “Alright. Alright, do the shopping then come by. But only so Rosie and I can see you.”
, Lestrade. I meant, what’s interesting about it. I’m in bed with John and quite comfortable, thank you very much.”
A noise came from the background of John’s video and he looked up briefly before looking back at his phone. “I have to go. But I’ll text you tomorrow, yeah? And text me with yours and Mrs. H’s grocery lists.”
“Don’t call me that.” Sherlock stepped towards the body; head tilted as he examined the blue prone form.
Sherlock stiffened. He straightened and pulled away from John, putting space between their bodies. “Oh. I see.”
Sherlock sighed and walked into the living room. John could hear the slight click of the remote buttons as he turned on the Firestick. Sherlock had ordered it for them and second for Mrs. Hudson during quarantine. It had certainly made their lives of never really the house (aside from a once a day short walk as sanctioned by the government) a lot easier through having the different streaming services so easily accessible. It was week 15 and they had gone through phases of driving each other absolutely up the wall, crippling depression, anxiety, being so restless they both thought they were going to die, and long stretches of lazy days, both men not moving from the sofa any more than absolutely necessary. They had even become plant parents to a beautiful little basil plant named Chester that John kept on a small table near the window. John had taken the opportunity to watch his favourite shows with Sherlock, moving swiftly through the two latest seasons of
Sherlock straightened. “What are you saying? Do you think they’re going to catch it? 87 cases are not that many. There are nearly nine million people living in London, John.”
Rosie waved absently in the direction of the door, preoccupied with the horses on the floor in front of her. “Goodbye, Daddy.”
“You are. Everything you’ve done… you’ve been doing it for me. You’ve been putting yourself through hell for me. And I’ve treated you horribly because of it. I am sorry.” John closed his eyes, his chin falling.
John pressed his face against Sherlock’s shirt, feeling his tears dampen the material, his hand sliding down to clutch at the material covering Sherlock’s sides, slipping under his blue dressing gown and grabbing, trying to hold on to the solidity of the man, the rock he so desperately needed. He felt Sherlock’s arms tighten around him as he grabbed onto Sherlock’s body tightly and pressed close as if he were trying to burrow beneath the skin separating him from Sherlock’s heart beating solidly beneath his cheek. He felt Sherlock’s head brushing the top of his own as they each held on tighter. John closed his eyes and pressed his lips against Sherlock’s chest, inhaling the comforting blend of Sherlock’s spiced cologne and the smell of his body.
John decided to head to the vending machine to calm his nerves with some food, not having had enough this morning during the interrupted breakfast. It would give him a chance to rehearse his speech again, and perhaps add a phrase or two now that they were here instead.
“Must we fight over this, John? It’s been nine days since I’ve last seen you.” Sherlock’s voice quieted.
Sherlock ducked under the yellow tape, weaving away from the two officers. “ID badge under his shirt! Text me with any developments, but I’m not leaving my flat! Don’t come ‘round!” He hopped back in the cab and shut the door. “Baker Street.”
“Thank you, sweetheart.” John pulled him close for a kiss, their lips pressing gently against each other. “It means a lot to me.”
“It would defeat the entire purpose, Sherlock. I should get going.” John shuffled his feet on the sidewalk.
Having gotten rid of his distraction of a partner, John continued with mixing the ingredients together with his hand, grimacing slightly at how sticky the mixture was. It was clumping between his fingers and squishing as he continued mixing. He lifted his hand to try and remove the gooey dough from his fingers and it merely got attached to his other hand. With a brief eyeroll to the heavens, John plunged both hands into the bowl
“Why, John?” Sherlock’s voice softened. “If I’m bad at it, then let me practice. I promise I’ll get better.”
“Shut up.” John muttered gruffly and turned back to the recipe. He set aside the 1/3 section and moulded the dough as instructed, folding it and pressing it down and eventually rounding it out, spinning it in his hands along the floured area as he smoothed the top and tucked the dough under the bottom.
Sherlock felt a warm hand on his cheek and blinked rapidly, bringing into focus John’s face quite close to his. Sherlock could feel himself crumbling and John pulled Sherlock close to his chest, alarmed. “Oh, Sherlock…”
some real food, mind you. I’ve got something I want to talk to you about first at any rate.” John’s heart rate picked up at his own allusion to something that could, would, change their lives forever.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa now.” John bent his arm and pressed his elbow against Sherlock’s chest, blocking his predatory advance and protecting his flour-covered hands. “I have to set this aside to rise. So, go finish the show in there and give me five minutes.”
John swallowed, looking to the side. “Well. Yes. Of course, I did. I told her this morning. We had a good conversation about it while you were at the crime scene.”
John wrapped his arms tightly around Sherlock, holding tightly onto his shirt and pulling him close. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s chest and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s clavicle. “I love you. It’s my job to protect you.”
“Do you? You seem to fling dangerous chemicals and biohazards around the flat in such a way that I think you want us to catch a disease and die.”
Sherlock nodded, eyes still taking in all the little pieces of glass everywhere. He reached up and quietly patted John twice on the shoulder in comfort.
John closed his eyes tightly. How could he not have seen it? How could he not have known? It wasn’t as if Sherlock had ever been forthcoming with any indication that he had actual feelings of that sort. Hell, John himself was the one who initiated their entire current relationship. They wouldn’t even be here if it hadn’t been for that kiss. And then to find out Sherlock had been pining after him for years? And apparently everyone could see and knew but him. Had Mary known? Is that what she had been hinting at this entire time? Post-death trying to nudge him in Sherlock’s direction?
John huffed, hand on the kettle. “Sherlock, I can’t shower every day. At this rate, I’ll scrub all my skin off to please your nose.”
Sherlock paused, his jaw clenching. He turned to Rosie. “Do you need assistance opening the package, Watson?”
Sherlock smirked slightly at John’s lovestruck expression. He tilted his head and pressed a tender kiss to John’s cheek, lingering for a few seconds to whisper into his ear. “You light up my life, John Watson.”
Sherlock bent his head and brushed his lips against John’s cheek. “You are all of the good men, gods, streetwise Hercules, and white knights on fiery steeds rolled together. And I hold out for you, always.”
Sherlock was sitting in the living room, curled up in his chair. He was basking in the peace and quiet of the flat now that Rosie was asleep in bed and waiting for John to return from St. Bart’s Hospital where he now worked at as an attending. The career shift had been an adjustment for them both but had swiftly became a vital compromise in their new lives, allowing them each their own career. Sherlock glanced up at the picture centred on the mantle of John, Rosie, and himself.  It had been taken the day of their wedding, almost a year previously. Sherlock smiled at the memory. It had been one of the happiest moments of his life, gaining not only a husband, but a daughter. They had spent the last year finding their routine with John’s new job and despite their occasional squabble between them or a temper tantrum from Rosie, Sherlock knew that he loved both of them more every day.
John hesitated for a moment. “Ah, yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about that. But I stopped by the store first.”
Sherlock tried to reach out and grab him, but John shook him off. Sherlock followed him down the stairs. “John. John! John, please!”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Why are you behaving this way? Is this why none of your other partners wanted to stay with you? Your irritating self-absorbed perception of life?”
“Morning, love,” John said, sounding a bit strained from the nerves. He forced himself to act normal and turned his head to kiss Sherlock’s temple. Wet, dark curls tickled his nose. The smell of Sherlock calmed him more than anything else he had tried that morning. Relaxing into the body behind him, John rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and breathed in a clarifying breath, the food temporarily forgotten.
Sherlock knelt and wrapped his own hands around hers. “Not yet. It’s nearly eight. But we have a few more minutes. You know why we’re doing this, yes?”
John picked at his plate with his chopsticks. He shifted on the sofa where he and Sherlock were sitting cross-legged with take away covering the table in front of them. Telly was mindlessly playing, mere background noise to their ravenous shoving of food from their plates to their mouths. But John had suddenly remembered, after sifting through the evening and recalling the mad dash through alleys, breaking into the brother-in-law’s flat, cornering him and taking him in to be arrested, what Greg had said earlier. He put his plate down on the table, appetite dissipating. Sherlock glanced over at him, mouth full of lo mien and frowned. He swallowed. “What’s wrong?”
that could be considered a hazard ever since you and Rosie returned to the flat, John. You know that!” Sherlock hissed at him. “How
Sherlock twisted the antibacterial cloth in his hands. “If you can manage to call… even for a few moments. It would mean a lot to Watson. This has been difficult. Explaining to her why you’re not coming home. She just doesn’t understand.”
John kissed his forehead before fetching the first aid kit. “I know.” Once fetched, he quickly returned to kneeling in front of Sherlock. Obtaining the tweezers, it took only a matter of seconds to grasp the sliver of glass and slide it from Sherlock’s foot. Sherlock winced as it was removed. John tabbed a bit of antiseptic ointment on it and popped a small round plaster on it. “There we go. All better. I would kiss it, but… I’m not kissing the bottom of your foot.”
on Prime. Sherlock had scoffed at it for the entirety of the first season, much like he had done for every show they had watched so far, but, also like every show they had watched so far, he had swiftly become reluctantly engaged in the characters and so they were just finishing the 5
“You’re an idiot.” John ran his hand around to hold the back of Sherlock’s neck and brought their lips together.
John nodded and watched the tea seep. “I bought her this pair of socks today. I saw them in a shop window and they reminded me of you and I thought she would like them. They’re in my coat pocket.”
Rosie scrambled to her feet and stood next to Sherlock. He wrapped an arm around her waist as she handed Sherlock her half-eaten biscuit. “Hello, Daddy.”
“Surely not.” Sherlock came around the side and peered at the laptop screen. His eyes scanned the recipe, his lips muttering softly as he read. “Oh. So it is. How… strange.”
John’s lips twitched. “Bye bye, Rosie. Have a fun day with Papa.” He ran a hand through her hair and kissed her forehead before standing. He blew a kiss to Sherlock and left.
“Of course, I was annoyed. I spent an hour on my knees on the bathroom tile. But she’s three, John, I know she doesn’t know any better. It’s her teacher’s fault for letting her run her hands through her hair. Her painting is on the fridge.”
Sherlock pushed him away angrily before immediately reaching out, grabbing his shirt and pulling him back into an embrace, wrapping his arms around John’s waist.
John shook his head. “Not yet, and be quiet about it please.” After a moment, he looked at Greg. “Actually, you kind of fucked it up to be honest, mate. He got your call right as I was about to.”
You didn’t realise how much he cared about you? I find that difficult to believe. You are a slow man, Dr. Watson, but not a stupid one.”
It had only been 12 days, but already it had begun to feel like a lifetime. The drudgery of March was never-ending and while Sherlock adored spending time with Rosie, there was such a thing as too much of a good thing. And he was quickly approaching his limit of exactly how much more he could handle of being cooped up in Baker Street with a child who had a seemingly unending source of energy that rivaled his own. After grinding his fingernails into the flesh of his thigh through his pajamas trousers to prevent himself from snapping at Watson, for God’s sake please stop humming the plinky little theme song to
“Come into the kitchen. I wasn’t done with breakfast.” John took his hand and led him into the kitchen. “It has to do with the hospital.”
John nodded once before running a hand through his hair. He sighed softly before turning to pour the boiling water into the mugs over the tea bags. “I’m sorry for snapping at you.”
Her face scrunched up in the beginnings of a fuss. Sherlock held his breath and watched as she suddenly sighed, looking in the direction of the playground. “Will you play Black and Alec with me?”
Sherlock snuggled further against his side and nodded. “Mhm… night..” His breathing evened out again.
John blinked blearily. “Oh, shit, the bread.” He scrambled out of the bed and grabbed one of Sherlock’s dressing gown off the back of the door before stumbling towards the kitchen, his legs struggling to remember how to coordinate. He rolled up the sleeves and washed his hands at the sink before moving to the table and opening his laptop. He blinked at the screen before his brain finally caught up with his eyes and understood the instructions. He rubbed some flour onto the tabletop and plopped his risen dough onto the surface. John craned his neck over the table and muttered the directions to himself before glancing down at the dough.
John closed his eyes for a moment and rubbed at his forehead. “I know, I know. Jesus, I know. I’m sorry.” The camera wobbled as John adjusted his grip on his phone. “I know you wouldn’t, and it was wrong of me to say it. I just… I would feel better if you let me do it. I’m already out here during this. And the stores will likely be crowded. I can run by Friday morning before work. And... maybe say hi in person from the curb? Would that be okay?”
“Because, for some unconceivable reason, he fell in love with you. And now you have given him the idea, God above knows why, that you reciprocate his feelings.” Mycroft took a step closer.
John rushed to set the table and remind himself of the speech he wanted to give. Tapping his pyjama pocket to check for the ring, he did his best to remain calm.
John nodded. He scanned the smooth bottom of Sherlock’s foot before spotting the tiny shard, firmly embedded in the transversal arch. “Okay, hold on for a second, I’m going to go get some tweezers, alright?”
Rubbing a hand over his face, John shook his head again. “Didn’t get the chance, bloody Lestrade called right as I was about to ask,” he whispered.
“Bodies always make him chipper, Greg.” John turned his eyes back to watch his partner swish his coat backwards and kneel on the floor besides the corpse.
Sherlock chuckled. “One does not live through the eighties without having experienced it. I find your use for it in reference to, I’m assuming, me, incredibly amusing.”
John blinked. “… Thank you.” He grabbed the bottle of olive oil from the counter and looked back at Sherlock. “Are… are you turned on right now?”
Nearly an hour later, the bread dough, safely relocated to the table and ensured to be glass-free, was placed back into the now clean and glass-free oven – which had involved painstakingly picking out little shards of glass with chopsticks – along with a metal pan filled with steaming water. The kitchen was clean, and the glass was in a bin bag. John ran the bag down to Mrs. Hudson’s bins and had also emptied and tidied out her vacuum of glass shards before returning it to her with many thanks. He tread back upstairs, slightly exhausted from the entire ordeal. With a sigh, he collapsed onto the sofa next to Sherlock who had gone back to watching
Sherlock set Rosie down in the front hallway and knelt, straightening out the outfit she had picked out that morning. He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “Remember, you have to stay inside the house, alright? We can only talk to Daddy, we can’t go near him, alright?”
Sherlock sat for a few moments, before realizing he could hear John’s steady tread returning down the hall. His shoulders relaxed slightly in relief. He could use John’s phone. Not to mention he always felt better when John was near. Keeping his eye on the eyepiece of the microscope, Sherlock waited until he heard the door open to hold out his hand to the side. “Can I borrow your phone? Mine is…” He waved his wrist slightly.
Sherlock unlocked the cabinet and removed the items he needed. “No. Can’t. This is time-sensitive. Need to get results before those idiots at Scotland Yard do. Shouldn’t be hard, but no reason to give them an unnecessary head start.” Sherlock locked the cabinet back up and tossed the keys onto the tray beside Molly. “Upstairs, John, let’s go.” He swooped out of the room, letting the door swing closed behind him.
John shut his eyes again. The emptiness in his chest ached, an ache that spread throughout his body. It was time to stop toeing the line and take the step. Take the step and complete his story. To close the book on the life of a man who was never able to succeed in anything, who, in the end, always lost everyone he tried to love. It was safer for Sherlock this way. Better for everyone. As he opened his eyes again and looked down at the pavement far below him, the people walking in their lives without an idea that he even existed. He wondered if any of them could stop him. Would it even matter if they tried? Who would know.
“Self-absorbed?” John scoffed. “I just sucked you off not two minutes ago. How is that self-absorbed?”
Sherlock shut his mouth with a snap, moving towards the exit. He called over his shoulder. “I’m going home. Check his storage unit!”
Sherlock stood and made his way to where John had hung up his coat. After rustling about in the fabric, Sherlock pulled them out. The sight of the tiny socks in his large hands brought an involuntary smile to his face. “They’re pink.”
John set the bag on the table, grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders, about-faced him and shoved him towards the living room, giving him a parting smack on his buttocks. “Get
Sherlock looked down at him and blinked, his hand closing instinctively around the ring, but not looking at it. “What… What are you doing?”
Sherlock had given up on entertaining his rambunctious daughter and so both were collapsed onto the sofa watching telly. Sherlock’s eyes were shut, his arms wrapped tightly around his little girl who was sprawled out on his lap and talking at the television. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open, hearing a shuffling of plastic and footsteps up the stairs. He turned his head to look towards the door, a small crease in his forehead. “John?”
Hurrying after Sherlock, John shot a look over his shoulder in apology to Greg as he caught up. “Figured it out then?”
John turned back to him. “No, not never mind. What do you mean ‘if you were here’ I am here. I come home every night and I have the weekends off. I’m here. We’re not having this argument again. We both agreed that we could make this job work.”
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was soft as he took another step towards John. His hand brushed against John’s shoulder. “You don’t need to apologise. We’re friends. That’s what friends do.”
John faltered and Sherlock cut in, squeezing his arm around her waist. “We’ll have to see, Watson. Daddy might be busy saving lives tonight. But we’ll see if we can call him some other time, alright?”
Sherlock sulked, resting his forehead against John’s chest. “I’m not worried about that. You begged me to marry you; I have no reservations about your loyalty.”
John absently gave his other triangle of toast to Rosie who had been reaching her hand for it, before taking a deep breath. “I’m not, actually. I’m going to keep working. But I don’t think I should live here anymore. I don’t want to risk giving Mrs. H or Rosie or you the virus, so I’ve found a temporary flatshare near the hospital and I’m going to stay there until things get better. It should only be until the beginning of April, they’re saying.”
He realised he didn’t need to gather the strength to continue his own. For as horrific as his own life had been, Sherlock’s had been…. Inconceivably worse. The man had grown up prodded by psychologists and ridiculed by his peers and teachers. His childhood friend had been murdered by his psychopath of a sister who was so awful he literally erased her from his memories. His brother had sought to interfere with every aspect of his life. He had overdosed multiple times from his drug addiction. He was called a freak by his work associates. He was almost killed by a serial killer, strangled, shot at by circus assassins, strangled again, and nearly killed repeatedly in their fight with Moriarty as well as having his entire reputation torn to the ground. That fiasco resulted in him faking his own death and fleeing the country for
Mycroft stopped in front of him, looking down. “Is that really the best you can do? For the man who gave up everything in his life for you. You’re
John shifted his weight. “It’s... it’s that new virus, the coronavirus. Covid-19. That’s what they’re calling it.”
Story: Sherlock has a meltdown because John was only supposed to be gone for a month, then two months, now it’s predicted to be up to six months. John reassures him that it’s probably more like the beginning/mid May. Then he’ll be home.
Wrapping his hands around Sherlock’s fist, John rubbed his thumbs across the whitened knuckles. “Of course, Sherlock. Yes. I very much want you to marry me.” He smiled gently at his confused lover. “Please say yes,” he said in a low voice, still rubbing his thumbs over Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock hummed, went over to the drawer on the other side of the room, and rummaged in it for the key.
“Because it feels fucking amazing to get sucked off!” John slammed one of the mugs down onto the counter.
“Absurd. You bring the risk of bringing that virus back here. Why should I stay home if you’re going to continue working?” Sherlock sat back in his chair.
He handed a few bills to the cab driver and followed after the quickly disappearing coat. John had a hunch he was heading for Molly.
“I know.” John shook his head. “It’s just, this is turning into a bigger thing than I thought it was going to be. We’ll just need to watch it closely.”
The concept for this fic was to follow Sherlock, Rosie, and John's journey along the major events that occurred during the pandemic. Those events became far too frequent and too many for me to follow.
Sherlock waved a hand. “Once this is over, I should have no problem completing my analysis. It might prove useful in the future. How was your day?” He leaned back against the headboard, cradling the phone in his hands.
John nodded, keeping his gaze on Sherlock’s clavicle and avoiding his eyes. Their hands held on to each other tightly. “I didn’t think… you did this. That you liked people like that.”
“Hiya!” John called back as he reached the top of the stairs. He toed his shoes off and walked into the kitchen, heavily yoked with shopping bags.
“He shouldn’t have…” John’s voice was soft. He closed his eyes, a hand coming up to rub at his forehead. “He shouldn’t have done all that for me… I don’t understand why he would do that for me.”
Sherlock hesitated, glancing at John. “Fine. Thirty minutes.” He hung up the phone and pushed away the blankets.
“I’m particular about the men I love. Highly selective. There are certain qualifications, you see.” Sherlock bent his head down, so his mouth was right next to John’s ear. “He’s gotta be sure and it’s gotta be soon. And he’s gotta be larger than life.”
As he ran a hand through the golden curls of their daughter where she rested against him, Sherlock breathed deeply and closed his eyes, feeling the warm sunlight against his face. They would make it through. Somehow.
“John??” Sherlock’s voice boomed from the other room in panic. “What the hell was-” he came around the corner, “-that.”
Once at the crime scene, Sherlock whirled away with a whoosh of his coat, bending over the body prone in the dirty alleyway. Greg hadn’t even opened his mouth before Sherlock had shushed him, so Greg made his way over to where John was standing. “So... congratulations?”
“This virus is serious. It’s killing people. And we have Mrs. Hudson downstairs and Rosie is still little.” John took a step towards Sherlock.
Rosie nodded and repeated the words in time to her skipping. “Two fifteen. Two fifteen. Two fifteen.”
Sherlock ignored him and brought his fingertips up to his nose to smell before rubbing the small spot of paint into dryness on his gloves. “An hour and ten minutes out of the can, I would say. Industrial, not used for house painting.” He stood and almost pulled off the gloves before stopping himself. “I want to-” Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock noticed the officer out front coughing into his hand again. Anderson rubbed at his eyes before touching a piece of equipment. He turned slightly and noticed another officer sipping coffee and wiping his mouth with his hand before drying his hand on his trousers. Nine million people in London, but it could be spread through anyone…
Quickly, John shushed him, keeping an eye on Sherlock. “Not here, you bloody idiot. But it’s fine. I’ll just do it somewhere else before tonight.”
“I know, you’ve said that before. But I don’t see why we must lock ourselves in the flat. How long are you planning on keeping us here?”
He shuffled his feet towards the edge, toeing the line. All his life, he’d been toeing the line, almost being good enough, but never quite making it.
The phone went dark and Sherlock slumped against the headboard. It had only been a week, but already it felt like a lifetime.
“It sounds premeditated, but I really only made the arrangements yesterday. Michael lives alone but he has an extra bedroom and a pull-out sofa, so Patrick and I are going to be kipping at his. We’ll each have our own bed and our own space. We’d hardly be there at the same time anyways. You don’t have anything to worry about.” John ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair.
“We’re alright. Running low on milk, but everything else is fine. Mrs. Hudson’s running out of eggs. I was planning on going on a grocery run in a few days.”
Sherlock blinked several times before bending to pick her up and hold her, looking down at the groceries lying on the floor in plastic bags. Clorox wipes, latex gloves, dish soap, laundry soap, hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, Dettol spray, interspersed with plastic bags full of canned beans and fruits, Rosie’s favourite crisps, biscuits, and baby wipes. A tremor made its way down Sherlock’s spine. “John, what is all this?”
Sherlock stepped behind him and wrapped his arms around John’s waist, resting his chin against John’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. The news is just sensationalizing this. It’ll all blow over soon.” He pressed a kiss to John’s neck. “Come drink your tea and I’ll rub your feet if you want.”
Sherlock walked back across the room, giving both John and Molly looks. “You congratulated John. Why? John hasn’t done anything worth congratulating.” He gave John a scrutinizing look. “You haven’t. Have you? No. You haven’t. Why were you congratulating him?”
Sherlock huffed and opened his mouth to retort, but John cut him off. “Stop. We’re not talking about your coat right now. We’re having an adult conversation about the virus that’s out there.”
“And I can’t let you do that because it’s just not right. It’s not right for you to be doing any more for me. You’ve done so much for me and I just don’t deserve it.”
“You’re such a dick.” John shook his head fondly and filled the kettle up from the tap. “Did Rosie go to bed alright?”
Sherlock crouched next to the body and bellowed, “Evidence bag and glove!” He held out his hand. A nearby forensic officer hastily rushed forward and held out a bag and gloves. Sherlock snatched them from her and leaned forward, pulling the glove onto his left hand. He reached out and carefully picked stands from the body and placed them into the evidence bag. He stood and briskly walked back towards the main street. “John, come.”
Sherlock swatted at him with his towel. “Shut up. You say that every time. It’s not my fault my husband’s a brilliant physician. I do bend to your expertise in this area, John.”
Sherlock grumbled and left. John could hear him settling himself on the sofa and turning the television back on.
“Just a few more minutes. Rosie wanted to tell you about what we’ve been doing. You can spare a few minutes for your daughter.”
“Hey, darling. Hello, sweet girl!” John looked between both of them with a smile that mirrored his expression on their wedding day. “I hope I got everything alright. The shops were insane. The shelves were wiped out of a lot of things.”
John hopped up and held out a hand. “Fantastic. Come on, let’s finish this episode. By then, the bread should be done.”
John accepted a cup of tea from Mycroft’s reedy fingers and nodded his thanks. “All due respect, but why are we here?”
“No, don’t leave. Stay. Talk this through with me. We’ll fix this, I promise.” Sherlock followed him into the bedroom.
Sherlock hummed in agreement before shifting closer and deepening the kiss. John reciprocated for a moment before placing a hand on Sherlock’s chest and pushing him away gently. “There’s something I really do need to talk to you about.”
His lips twitched. “Mm, yes, precisely.” He set her down after kissing the top of her head. “Why don’t you go up to your room and play for a bit, hm? I’ll call you when dinner’s ready. Then you can show, Daddy your socks, alright? I don’t think he was paying attention just now.”
Forty more minutes later, John got his answer in the form of a half-eaten loaf of beautiful white bread. He and Sherlock had quickly devoured thick warm slices of the perfectly textured bread with a light crispy crust smothered in copious amounts of creamy rich butter. They even plucked a few leaves from Chester and laid them on top of the butter and created literal heaven. It had been the most Sherlock had eaten in several days and the most bread John had eaten in… most likely his entire life. But it was incredibly worth it. Definitely worth all the waiting and the kneading and the glass explosion and the shard in Sherlock’s foot (as stated by said man). John settled happily on the sofa with Sherlock after they had finished, full and content. “Tomorrow, I’m going to try to make a Victorian sponge cake.”
When the timer went off one hour later, John was ready, standing by. He had been very successful in cleaning the bedroom and was now dressed in pyjama pants and a soft t-shirt that was one of Sherlock’s favourites for him to wear because it “clings to all your muscles so beautifully, John”. He was pretty sure the pyjama pants were actually Sherlock’s because they felt just a little too large and he had had to roll up the legs into cuffs at the bottom. He needed to laundry soon. John filled a liquid measuring cup with 2 cups of cold water and opened the oven. He carefully slid the flour-dusted bread into the top rack, slipped on an oven mitt and slid the glass Pyrex and its rack out slightly to add the water. It was necessary to create the steam to… John wasn’t exactly sure why, but it was in the instructions. He tipped the measuring cup over and cold water poured out. As soon as it hit the hot glass of the Pyrex, it sizzled, startling John slightly. But it created steam, as intended, so he tipped the measuring cup further, pouring a thicker stream of water onto the glass. Suddenly, the glass cracked and shattered! Shards and cubes of glass exploded apart, crashing through the metal spokes of the rack and flinging pieces onto the tile floor with a thunderous crash.
. With a shake of his head, he stood up and started clearing their plates, shoveling food into his mouth as he went. After dealing with that, he headed to the bedroom, hoping to try again there. Instead, a pile of clothes hit John in the face, and he knew it wasn’t going to happen. They dressed quickly, Sherlock constantly nagging, and made their way into a cab.
“She hasn’t done that for nearly six months, John.” Sherlock’s voice was soft. “You would know that if you were here.”
The silence of the early morning was broken by the buzzing of Sherlock’s phone on his nightstand. The noise laboriously dragged him from sleep, his eyes slowly squinting open in the dimly lit bedroom. Next to him, John rolled over and swatted at him. “Sherlock. Phone.”
Sherlock leaned into the touch and closed his eyes. He felt able to breathe when John was touching him, grounding him. Sherlock ran his hands over John’s chest and closed his eyes. “You did nothing wrong at all. The…” He cleared his throat. “Intensity. Of the moment was momentarily overwhelming, and I would appreciate it for you to not move while I continue processing the absurdity of the fact that you wish to spend the rest of your life with me of all people.”
alive. I love you. And I don’t want to spend another day of my life without you by my side. I want you to know, I want the
Sherlock sat on the floor of the entryway, pulling the groceries into the house and wiping them down before setting them aside. “It has seemed like much longer. This is the longest we’ve been apart since-”
Sherlock grunted in response and reached his hand out, fumbling for the electronic. He pressed the device to his ear. “Mm…Sherlock Holmes.” His voice was rough from sleep.
The phone bleeped with the sound of an incoming Facetime call and Sherlock startled awake, sitting up abruptly from where he had accidentally fallen asleep, sprawled out on the bed. He fumbled for the phone within the sheets before finding it. He ran a hand through his hair before accepting the call. John’s face appeared on the screen and Sherlock felt the world light up around him. “John.” His voice warm and comfortable, like the caress of the sun against skin on a warm Spring day.
Sherlock set the socks on the armrest of his chair, stood, and stepped towards him. “You’re actually concerned about this.”
“I know,” Sherlock replied softly, feeling his chest and throat tighten as the tension returned. “However, if you clap extra loud, perhaps Daddy can hear you, alright?”
“Hey, you.” John smiled softly; his eyes weighted with exhaustion. White headphones were nestled into his ears and the cord ran down towards his chest. Deep red lines scored his cheeks, mirrored on each side as well as a red abrasion beginning to form on his nose. The lines were offset against his pale skin and ruffled blonde-grey hair.
After standing in the shower long enough to have used 85% of the hot water, Sherlock got out and returned to the bedroom to get dressed. The quiet buzz of boredom pressed against the base of his skull and his fingers tripped in agitation over the shoulders of his suits hanging in the closet. After eventually selecting one, Sherlock decided against dressing and walked out in a pair of low-slung pyjama trousers and a dressing gown. He walked out of the bedroom and into the kitchen where John seemed...busy. He nudged up behind John and nuzzled his neck, searching for a kiss. “Morning,” his voice gravelly from having woken up just a little while earlier.
“You don’t know that.” John clenched his jaw. “You don’t know that at all. It could be nothing or this could be big.”
With a smirk, John took the ring from Sherlock’s outstretched hand. “I do believe you are right.” He clasped Sherlock’s left hand in his and slipped the ring onto the fourth finger, twisting it a bit to move it past the knuckle. Once it was on, he stared at the new adornment, grinning stupidly. Looking at Sherlock and holding back tears, he says, “I love you, you stupid git. I love you so much. Ready to go home?”
Rosie turned back to the window and shouted, “St. Bart’s hospital! He’s the best doctor in the world!”
John shrugged and turned back to the large glass bowl in front of him, where he was mixing a sticky mixture of flour, yeast, chopped up butter, and salt with one hand and gradually pouring water into the bowl with the other. “It’s something new to do.”
John tried for a smile and one flickered across his face. He tried again, smiling up at Sherlock. “Nothing, my love. Come have a sit and let me see that book.”
John smiled and gently pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, his nose, his eyebrow, his other cheek, and finally his lips. “Mm. Indeed.”
I will not continue writing for this story, but I had concepts of what would happen. I think the pandemic became much larger than any of us really anticipated and so it is with great resolve that I conclude this story how I can and put it to rest.
Story: Day with Rosie. Sherlock takes her on an adventure around the flat and he ends the day filming her clapping for John out the window.
. He then underwent horrendous torture only to return and undergo physical and verbal abuse by the man who was supposed to be his best friend. He returned to drugs, got shot by his best friend’s wife, and his heart stopped multiple times. He was assaulted in a hospital bed, he shot someone, and then he overdosed
John dragged on pants, jeans, vest, and shirt. “I can’t stay.” He knelt and put on his socks and shoes.
PM Johnson, in his daily press briefing, urges the UK to take the quarantine seriously and work from home unless essential and to avoid pubs and restaurants. The death toll continues to rise.
“I don’t think you give yourself enough credit, John.” Sherlock shifted his hands to hold onto John’s shoulders.
“For God’s sake, you just got here.” Sherlock huffed. “I’m sorry. I won’t say another thing. I am content to simply have you in front of me.”
John woke up in the middle of the night, his eyes slowly fluttering open and the ceiling gently coming into focus. Small shafts of light spread across the plaster from the window. He shifted slightly and felt arms tighten around his chest and a warm weight move further against his left side. He tilted his head and saw a dim outline of Sherlock sleeping next to him, nuzzling closer. John let his head roll back to look at the ceiling and he sighed softly. Sherlock shifted next to him, making soft sleepy noises. “John?”
Sherlock grasped his hand and allowed himself to be pulled to the sofa and cuddled. The twenty minutes passed quickly. Once the timer went off, John reluctantly untangled himself and moved into the kitchen to silence its blaring and pull his bread out. He set it on the stovetop and gently pried the bread up off the stoneware. He tapped on the bottom. The instructions said to tap and if it sounded hollow, it was done.
“Morning!” Sherlock waved a hand in greeting as he disappeared into the bathroom. Once inside, he shucked the gloves into the bin, stripped his clothing, and started the shower. He placed all his clothes sans coat into the laundry bin and stepped into the shower. He winced at the lukewarm water but started scrubbing at his body anyways. Once his skin felt raw and shone a slight pink and his hair clean, Sherlock stepped out of the shower and dried off. He then wrapped the towel around his waist and went into the bedroom to change only to be startled to find John waiting for him there, arms crossed. “John. Good morning.” He took a few steps forwards and kissed him hello before moving to get dressed.
“That is exactly what you must not do, Watson. It’s to keep us from getting ill, alright? Pinky promise me you will stay right next to me. It will be very hard, I know, but you can hold my hand.” Sherlock held out his hand, pinky extended.
John’s eyes flashed open. “I can’t just do that, Sherlock. You have to stop asking. People need me here.”
“I don’t know, Sherlock.” John let his arms fall to his sides, his shoulders sagging as he sighed, disclosing his exhaustion.
Sherlock eyes flickered up to him. “John’s concerned about the new virus.” He knelt beside the corpse and reached out a hand to dab at the paint.
Sherlock takes Rosie on a walk in Regent’s park and it helps clear their heads. It’s predicted that John will be gone for another month. 12 days in quarantine.
Sherlock turned his head and pressed a quick kiss to John’s lips before standing. “Quite sure. Text me or talk to me before you leave for work. When is it, seven thirty today?”
Chuckling slightly, John shifted his weight forward to start cooking again. “Give it a mo, and I think that’ll change.” He flipped the bacon once more before moving it off the heat onto a plate. “I’ve made all your favorites.” After checking the eggs, he turned around in Sherlock’s grasp and placed his hands on Sherlock’s hips, rubbing circles over the sharp bones with his thumbs. “How’s that sound, hmm?”
“I meant in general, John.” Sherlock pulled her back slightly, kneeling next to her. “Watson, can you see if you can tell which bag has your biscuits?”
The air was crisp and cool with a smattering of grey clouds floating above them in the blue sky. After crossing the main road and navigating their way onto the grey paved paths of the park, Sherlock let Rosie slide down to walk herself, keeping a keen eye on their surroundings. There were quite a few people up and about and maintaining space from them would be paramount. He watched as Rosie crouched and walked slowly towards a gathering of pigeons close to the boating lake. His lips twitched in amusement as the pigeon she was attempting to get close to walked briskly away from the approaching child. “Watson, let’s walk a bit. I’m sure there will be more fowl to investigate further along the path.”
Story: John says there’s really noway to know that. And they’re getting more and more cases every day.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowing sleepily on his forehead and the corners of his mouth pulled downwards. “What’s wrong with it?”
to know you are the most important part of my life. So...William Sherlock Scott Holmes, will you do me the greatest honor of my life and marry me?”
and managed to wrangle the dough into submission. Only having to add a little bit more water, he formed it into a lumpy shape and removed his hands, heading to the sink to wash off the glumpy bits still clinging to him.
Suddenly, as if someone had flipped a switch, the patter of applause grew, and Sherlock could hear and see people coming to their doorways and windows and applauding. A dull rush of noise rose from around them, people applauding in the neighborhoods and streets surrounding theirs. Rosie leaned further out the window, calling out to the street, “We’re clapping for my Daddy!”
When the alarm went off early that morning, John jerked awake quickly to turn it off before Sherlock noticed.
John moved over to Sherlock’s side of the bed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “I need to talk to you about the hospital.” He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s neck. “You sure you can’t stay home?”
John straightened and picked up his cup before Sherlock re-entered the room, holding his book in one hand and a plate of biscuits in the other. “I do hope you are done terrorizing my partner, brother dear. You do tend to drone on.” Sherlock set the plate on the table and faltered slightly, seeing John’s face. He paused. “What’s wrong?”
Sherlock pulled back; his eyes wide. “You’ve already had this conversation with Watson? Without me?”
She sighed and put down her horses before getting up and running over to John. He knelt down and she hugged him tightly before planting a dainty kiss on his cheek. “Bye, Daddy. Have a good day.”
Sherlock and John sat on a Victorian settee; the upholstery elaborate but worn beneath them. The room around them was simple, but elegant with touches of modern technology that John wouldn’t be surprised to learn were not in public development yet. Mycroft sat opposite, pouring tea for the members of their small group. For once, Sherlock wasn’t scowling at his kin, but relaxed, distracted by an antique medical text Mycroft had just gifted him.
Story: Doctors are using bin bags as protective measures. Working 13 hours a day. John is constantly on call and working overtime. He facetimes with Sherlock at the end of a shift and says how utterly exhausted he is and how hard it is to say that they’re doing their best but are they? The equipment is not enough and old and it’s so hard to provide the protection they need to take care of these people. But it’s a great comfort that Sherlock, Rosie, and Mrs. H are safe during this time.
Sherlock reached out and grabbed his arm. “Yes, you can. Just stay and talk to me, please, John. Don’t leave, please.”
John stood in the middle of Baker Street, his bare feet resting against the worn carpet. His hand clenching and unclenching by his leg. Rosie was downstairs with Mrs. Hudson. His entire life had crumpled yet again. That’s what it had always done.
He could feel Lestrade roll his eyes over the phone. “We talked about sharing where you are, Sherlock. And he’s covered in wet blue paint.”
Rosie tilted her head to look up at him from where she was seated on the floor playing with her horses. “What time is it?”
Watson took her biscuit back and turned to John. “Bye, Daddy. Have a good day at work.” She smiled at him.
“It’s fine!” Sherlock called back to him, placing the leftovers in containers and placing them in the fridge. He walked back into the living room and picked up the take away boxes from the table, piling them into his arms and moving to put them away. “I’ll be done in a minute. Do you need to take a shower?”
Sherlock appeared in the doorway to the living room with a sheepish expression on his face. “I appear to have stepped on some glass.”
Sherlock winked and padded into the kitchen to adjust the temperature. John heard the beeping of the oven controls and then the beeping of the timer being reset and then a soft, “Ow.”
Sherlock gave her a look before moving towards the chemical solutions cabinet. “It was an easy case, no need for congratulations. Heart attack?”
“Well, it’s spreading quite a bit faster than they thought it would. The cases in the UK just doubled to 87.”
“No, I don’t think he noticed, honestly. This is the one thing he hasn’t been able to pick up on. It’s a bit strange actually.”
His body was tired, and his mind couldn’t comprehend thinking beyond the simplest tasks. The world was grey and hazy and there was a tightness in his chest he couldn’t unravel. He felt weak. Cripplingly weak. He was barely able to pull himself together to make a cup of tea, let alone take care of his daughter. He didn’t know how to gather the strength and continue for Rosie, let alone himself.
Placing the food in their respective spots, he sat next to Sherlock, reached into his pocket for the ring with one hand, and took Sherlock’s left hand with the other.
Rosie nodded, her wide, solemn eyes making her appear well beyond her young age. “I want Daddy to come home.”
Real life: Survey of 11,000 individuals states that potentially 1 in 400 people are infected with COVID.
The surprise engagement party hadn’t remained much of a surprise after the actual engagement, but it turned out to be a surprisingly warm event filled with the people they loved: Molly, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, and Mycroft—though the latter was still in debate. All of the guests took just enough time to wish the new couple congratulations before making a timely exit, each carrying a box of the large selection of baked goods Mrs. Hudson had gifted them. The last to leave, Mycroft hesitated by the door in order to deliver some partially sentimental partially scathing final remark but was foiled by Sherlock shoving a box of scones into his hands and shutting the door in his face. “So long, fatty.”
“No, you don’t.” Sherlock stopped next to the fridge and crossed his arms. “What the hell are you talking about, that is not how a relationship works and you know it. We’re equal partners in this. Having sex with you is not a
Sherlock glanced up at the Hanover Gate playground quickly approaching. “Not today, I’m afraid, Watson. Why don’t we go to the grass and play together today?”
Sherlock’s back straightened. “I was going to put her in her pack n play in the downstairs foyer. Mrs. H would leave her door open. I’m not stupid, John. I know that everything would need to be disinfected. But Rosie needs her milk and Mrs. Hudson needs groceries as well.”
Sherlock sighed softly, wrapping his arms around John’s waist. After just a moment, he nudged John’s cheek with his nose. “Bored.”
“Oi! That’s wet, don’t mess with it.” Anderson shouted at him from the corner where he was conferring with the forensics photographer.
“Do you? Because forgive me if I seem a little unsure of myself.” Sherlock looked up suddenly. “You have not been the most communitive.”
John walked over and knelt next to him, running his hands along Sherlock’s face to cup at his jawline before kissing him once, twice, three times. Their lips lingered on the last kiss, cherishing each other’s closeness. John pulled away before coming back to press two more quick kisses to Sherlock’s lips. “Have a good day. I’ll see you tonight. We’ll keep talking then, alright?”
John looked up from the kitchen table where he was covered up to his elbows in flour. “I’m making bread.”
After he left, Mycroft stood and closed the door firmly behind him before turning to face John. “What are you playing at, Doctor Watson?”
John did not, in fact have an affair, but came very close to having one. John doesn't end up seeing his family for five months as he works in the COVID unit.
At 8, Sherlock and Rosie stand near the open window and clap their hands for John. Rosie asks for Daddy at bedtime and cries.
John sighed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock, resting his chin against the top of Sherlock’s head. “It’s not that long.”
Sherlock flushed and pressed his face to John’s shoulder in embarrassment, mumbling his response. “It was an accident. Don’t be mad. I’ll find it.”
“Git,” John muttered fondly as he plated the bacon, eggs, and honeyed-toast. He took one last deep breath before turning back to the table to face the man he loved. The light shone across Sherlock’s face, making his pale eyes glitter and dark hair reflect back. The sight caught John, faltering his steps. A grin broke across his face, and he thought
“John, I don’t understand. How long have you felt like this?” Sherlock’s voice raised slightly in pitch.
Sherlock gave him a questioning look before folding the book and tucking it between his arm. “I’ll only be a minute. Yell if he bothers you.”
“Long. There are so many people coming in and they’re either sick or they think they’re sick.” John ran a hand over his face. “It’s hard to tell unless you test them. Yours?”
“Most of what Mycroft says would never come from your mouth, John.” Sherlock leaned over and kissed John’s cheek, his eyes still on the pages of his book.
Once they reached the wide expanse of green, Sherlock found a somewhat secluded spot and set down the stroller. He and Rosie spent the rest of the afternoon chasing after one another in the fresh air. Sherlock made sure to stay just out of her reach until the height of the chase, when he allowed himself to be caught and tumbled to the grass, Rosie flinging herself on top of him. Eventually, after a final capture, Rosie threw herself onto Sherlock’s chest and nuzzled against him, curling up in his arms. He lay back against the green and gazed up at the sky, catching his breath and holding Rosie close. Her mask had come off during the chase and he had tucked it away in his pocket. He wasn’t worried about exposure, since they had been playing so far from others. For a few hours, he had managed to forget about the predicament of the world. Looking at the bright blue sky helped ease the claustrophobic terror building in his chest, the fear of the unknown. Without John to ground him, the world seemed perilously abstract. That morning, John had called him at first light to inform him that the initial three-week estimate was a gross miscalculation. Instead of another week of separation, there would be at least another four weeks. The news had crushed Sherlock’s spirit and endurance, leading to a stressful morning where everything Watson did felt like an antagonistic reminder that there would be no reprieve anytime soon. No quick return from John to make the moments pass easier. It would continue to be him and Watson for another four weeks.
