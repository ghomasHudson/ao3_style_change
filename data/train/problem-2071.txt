“Oh, well that’s a relief. Not the human trafficking thing, but…” John paused, shaking his head. “So you helped bring them down?”
Maybe… maybe there was something he could do about that. “I don’t know if you’d be interested,” Sherlock said, “but maybe once Lestrade lets me back onto crime scenes again, you could come along on a case or two. It’s not war torn Afghanistan or anything, but I’ve always thought of London as a battlefield of sorts.”
“Alright, Sherlock, but what about day-to-day life?” Mycroft asked, arching a brow. “I can have an assistant on hand to offer aid should something go wrong, you fall, or you just need something. You live alone, and you can’t expect poor Mrs. Hudson to help. As much as I’m sure she’d love to help in any way she can, she’s not as young as she once was, and could hardly lift a grown man should the need arise.” He was already acting as if he’d won. He was wrong.
“Mmm, it’s like listening to one of Shakespeare’s sonnets.” Mike joked from over by the fireplace. “Nothing like sound, logical arguments to get the heart beating faster.”
“You should be.” Sherlock smirked, and at that they both dissolved into a fit of giggles brought on by excitement and the tiniest touch of nerves.
John waited a few moments until it looked like the man was done with whatever he was doing, before going over to take the seat opposite him. “Excuse me, are you a Mr. Lestrade?”
“Yes, absolutely. Just because John doesn’t carry the surname Holmes or Vernet, that does not mean he isn’t intelligent and capable… to a degree.”
“I want the school involved in some capacity. I’m not saying I’ll campaign to have them expelled,” though he would love nothing more, “I just want the school to know who they have on campus.”
With one last kiss, Sherlock gathers up his clothes and is gone, leaving John’s bed tragically empty, and John with a hollow feeling he really doesn't care to think about.
“No, Sherlock! Absolutely not!” John hissed, trying to keep his voice low so as not to be over heard. The guests were all dancing or talking, and Sherlock had tried dragging John into the temporarily empty house. “The first time I make love to my husband is
“Of course I’m here, it’s my office hours.” John said, looking up from his laptop to grin at Sherlock. “You’re out of breath, are you alright?”
“Sir, if you’ll remain calm and tell me who you are, I’m sure we can get you the information you need.”
“Well… He’s never said anything about it, but I think Sherlock knows about them.” How could he not, his bedroom is directly below John’s, surely he’d hear the tossing and turning, and more embarrassingly, the whimpering.
Like with the first lesson, Sherlock met John outside Carrows gym on Thursday at eight-thirty on the dot, though this time he wore his own workout clothes which fit him far better than those he borrowed from John. Not that he would ever admit it out loud, but John rather missed the sight of Sherlock wearing his old sweatshirt. Wrong size or not, it kind of suited him. And the shorts, well it was best he not to think about that.
“Interested in Sherlock? Why?” John asked, feeling stupidly brave and looking the man up and down. “You’re most definitely not friends.”
Once prepared, John’s mouth finds Whitney’s again, and slowly starts to push in. While he takes his time, her breathy gasps and against his lips, moaning as he moves deeper, cause John to fight to control the urge to thrust in all at once. Fully seated, John stills, allowing Whitney to accommodate to him. After a minute or so, Whitney starts to rock up against John’s pelvis, telling him he can move. John’s thrusts start off shallow, slowly working up to longer, and deeper movements. Hands roaming up and down his back, Whitney mouths along John’s neck and shoulders, rising up to meet and match John’s pace. After what feels like both an eternity, and a matter of seconds, Whitney is arching off the bed as her climax crashes over her with a broken cry, John following only moments later.
“Man you’re fussy when you’re bored.” John snickered. “I added extra hours because it’s almost Christmas, and revision week is next week, then it’s finals. People might show up and have questions.”
“Will do,” John nodded, not bothering to address what had been said before Sherlock’s interruption. “And thanks for the files and the…” he added waving towards the fridge, and the spleen it now contained.
“Everything! He’s my… he’s Sherlock. Jacket, I need my jacket.” John rushed around, throwing his jacket on and grabbing his wallet off the table. “I can’t find my phone. Where the fuck is my phone!?” He was panicked, Sherlock was probably dying, and John was just standing around Harry’s flat, looking for his god damn phone.
Truth time, I have no idea how medical school works in the UK but I know it's not like this, but let's all put on our pretending caps and say that it does.
, threads hanging around.  I think you and Sherlock need to be honest with each other, and decide what you both want. You can’t leave not knowing what you are to each other. There can’t be any questions or what if’s.”
“I’ve known him for five years now and no, I don’t.” Lestrade sighed. “Don’t get me wrong, I like Sherlock, I consider him a friend… It’s just… Well, I guess what I’m trying to say is, I’m glad Sherlock’s found a flatmate he’s comfortable with, someone who partially understands and isn’t turned off by who he is. It’s good for him, Sherlock Holmes is a great man, and now I think there’s a chance he’s on his way to being a good one as well.”
“Well you have one.” John’s voice was once again calm, but left no room for arguments. “Now I’m taking you to hospital, and you’re going to be checked out by a real doctor if I have to throw you over my shoulder and carry you there myself.”
It's almost 3 A.M. So I apologize  about any mistakes, hopefully I'll be happy about this in the morning..or later in the morning...
“I need to put the towel underneath you,” Sherlock said. John nodded, and then lowered his bed until it was about a one hundred and sixty degree angle. He tried to turn on his side, but then he paused. He looked at Sherlock, raising an eyebrow. Sherlock stared at him, and then said, “oh.”
Sherlock reached behind him, and then placed a plastic bowl on John’s lap just as he leaned forward and heaved. Sherlock rubbed his back awkwardly as John retched little into the bowl. He coughed and then leaned back heavily against the pillows. He closed his eyes and heard Sherlock remove the bowl, and then stand up. He could feel Sherlock leaning forward over his body. He felt his fingers trail across his forehead, but then he cringed when Sherlock’s fingers grazed his head wound. John took Sherlock’s wrist and gently removed it, wincing slightly.
“What evidence?” Sherlock breathed. “The emails are vague, and only discussing them meeting. John may know what’s going on. I need to find him.”
The man laughed again. Sherlock grinned slightly, feeling oddly intrigued by the invalid. Brushing it off, he looked away, still intent on ignoring the man.
“Victor,” Sherlock greeted. John couldn’t tell if the greeting was warm or not, but didn’t think it mattered; they were together apparently. John felt something odd flutter in his abdomen, but he quickly pushed it aside and looked at the flowers as the man—Victor—set them down on the bedside table.
“I am not leaving Sherlock.” John said, his voice suddenly firm. “We’re in this together.” Sherlock stared at him, and then glanced at the timer.
“Like I said, a friend,” John repeated, his tone turning to annoyance. This time Sherlock blushed; someone was standing up for him, and even though he could care less, something about John’s tone sent a shiver down his spine—or was it a flutter?
“Sherlock—wait, just wait—,” John took a step back and held up a hand, holding Sherlock back. Sherlock’s eyes flickered with worry, but then he relaxed his face and looked at John.
Sherlock took his chance and continued. “You haven’t been sleeping well, if at all. I hear you walking in the hallway in the middle of the night; you hands are both trembling, and you blink heavily whenever you sit down. I’m already useless as it is, the both of us can’t be.”
“John!” Sherlock bellowed again as he paced the room in his chair, going in odd circles at the foot of the stairs.
John figured. Sherlock could get so wrapped up in a case he’d neglect to answer his phone whenever it rang with a call. Hopefully he was getting somewhere with the case though.
“You’re looking for a man with a history of military service, strong moral principle, and nerves of steel…” His gaze caught John’s from behind the yellow tape.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond with a retort, but John pushed out of his arms and went into the car without question, sitting behind the driver; Sherlock followed suit, buckling in and reaching for the door. Before he could get the door closed, the car sped away.
John nodded, and reached forward and took Sherlock’s hand. He squeezed it briefly and softened his face. “It’ll be all right.”
Whenever John had eaten, it must have been before he fell asleep on the floor, which meant he had been up earlier than Sherlock originally thought—probably never even bothered to try to sleep, as he was still dressed in yesterday’s clothes.
John swirled his tongue against Sherlock’s, both of them moaning and fully awake. John reached for the hem of Sherlock’s nightshirt and pulled it over his head. Sherlock did the same to John, and then laid against him, their bare chests pressed against each other. Sherlock rested one of his hands over John’s hip, and John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and pulled one of his legs over Sherlock’s, tangling themselves up in warmth.
Sherlock fell silent, but his eyes were flickering as if he was thinking of what to say next. John closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. He held his breath for a moment, and then slowly let it out. His chest relaxed just slightly, so he repeated the process.
Sherlock sighed heavily and looked at John, his eyes flickering as he contemplated. John waited patiently, holding his breath.
A flash of disappointment occurred in John’s eyes, but Sherlock only barely caught a glimpse of it, not enough to further dwell on.
He really wanted to believe Sherlock—hell, he hoped he was an idiot in this case; it would be far better than the alternative. He just wanted to get this over with.
John’s voice trailed off. He stared up at Sherlock before blinking heavily. His eyes closed once then didn’t open.
“I know, but I’m sorry you had to go through all that. When we get home, you’re going to eat and then rest with me, no questions.”
John grinned weakly. He raised his hand and overlapped Sherlock’s that was cupping his own cheek. Sherlock leaned in and closed the small space between their lips with a shy kiss. John leaned into it, moving just a bit back and forth for a slight rhythm. The kiss turned passionate and the pair kissed each other for a few more seconds before John backed away slightly.
“John—,” Sherlock started, but John saw Victor press his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, and started to lead him out. Sherlock didn’t protest.
John sighed, too tired to look further into it. It probably was an interesting case, but why hide it? It didn’t seem like Sherlock was even hiding it, just that he wanted John out of the flat. Out of his way? John didn’t know. He wiped his face and inhaled deeply, urging the threatening tears to go the hell away, but it was no use, as usual nowadays. The salty tears dripped down his cheeks; John quickly wiped them away and bowed his head. He continued to wipe them away as his back shook with shudders as more tears came. It was quiet and partially due to the overwhelmingly anxious day he just had.
*            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *
“If by this,” Sherlock started, his voice above a whisper and borderline hoarse. “You’re referring to your idiotic stubbornness, your begging to me to keep your word, and watch you become sicker and sicker while I was conflicted on whether I should your word and keep you home, or do what I would have wanted to do sooner, and take you to the hospital. But this is just
Simultaneously, they both lunged for it. John managed to grasp it in his hand just as the man tackled him; John fell onto his back, back at the bottom of the stairs again. His gun was flung from his hand and away from his reach. He tried to stand up but the assailant wouldn’t back off and began to beat him, throwing punches to his head and kicks to his abdomen and side. He was stronger than the man who had attacked him earlier that day, so John didn’t think it was Moran.
Sherlock mumbled incoherently, and sluggishly raised his head and looked at John. He glanced over his body in a second, and then his eyes widened, narrowed, and then he sat up, keeping his gaze on John.
John inhaled sharply, and then gave a stiff nod to the door. “Right, of course. I’m sorry. But just…think it through. We spend time apart, and absence makes the heart grow fonder, right? Without intimacy, we’ll want it, and then we’ll forget about what’s keeping us apart now.”
Sherlock blushed with John’s choice of wording for this coitus act, but was glad John’s head was tucked in the crook of his neck, and couldn’t see his cheeks revealing his obvious sentiment even more.
John, startled, sat up and followed him. He grabbed him by the elbow and held him still. “Let’s stay inside—.”
“Don’t lecture me on sentiment again, Mycroft.” Sherlock spat, a cold hard stare gleaming in his eyes. “The game has changed. Sentiment is the only way to end it now. I’m not playing with anyone’s emotions; I’m just using them as an advantage. What I feel for John Watson is no concern to you!”
Sherlock spun around and stopped in his tracks. “It was—.” He gaped and stared at John, his eyes widening as they flickered down his body. John shifted on the crutches and bit his lip, trying to keep his relieved smile contained.
Harry let out a shaky breath and then spoke. “Please…” She hesitated, looking for the right words. “Promise me you’ll make sure he doesn’t get hurt.”
Sherlock rushed through the hospital doors of the surgical wing and bee-lined to the front desk. “I need to see Dr. John Watson, now.” He said, with a slight attempt to appear and sound calm.
John straightened up and slowly turned around. He kept his eyes to the ground, forcing himself to avoid Sherlock’s face. He took the jacket and murmured a ‘thanks’, but didn’t put it on.
Mycroft eyed him with pity. “So now what? Wait until you get back? Perhaps you should think that through—.”
John inhaled deeply. “All right, we’ll take the case. Text the address, I think Sherlock would want to look at the crime scene.”
John thought to himself as he ignored the solid hallucination and proceeded with his normal morning routine. (He had to be at the surgery in an hour). John’s hand shook slightly with the tremor, and he fumbled with the toothpaste cap and dropped it on the floor. He knelt down and picked it up, and then, straightening back up, he looked into the mirror only to have his breath taken away.
The nurse left, and then they were alone. John hovered by the bed, his eyes darting from the screen that showed Sherlock’s vitals, to Sherlock’s body, and observed his wounds without actually touching him.
“You’ll start physical therapy today. It’ll just be stretches though,” Sherlock informed him. John nodded absentmindedly, and tried to focus on that rather than the rising panic.
There was a shuffle of movement behind him and the light was flicked on. John inhaled deeply, sharp pain spreading in his wrist and in his abdomen. The crutch was poking him, and he shifted off of it, grimacing in pain.
“About the warrant, I haven’t been able to overrule it. It’s based off of special circumstances by the U.S. President. But they wouldn’t be able to torture any information from him here, that’s for certain. After all, he’s on British soil.”
And then suddenly he was awake. The memory dissipated before he could fully remember it, and he sat up gasping. John pulled the covers off his sweaty body and clutched his right knee. He fumbled forward, searching blindly in the dark, but realization hit him like a wave of ice-cold water—it hit him hard—and he inhaled sharply and held it in for several seconds.
“It won’t right away. But it’ll help; in some small way it will help. Besides,” John leaned back against the pillow, trailing his hand into Sherlock’s curls. “How can anyone resist my face, apart from my shaved head.” John said proudly, only finishing slightly ashamed for the latter.
The door opened, and Dr. Bailey walked in. He took a seat in Sherlock’s chair and took out his notepad.
atropine: keeps heart stable and lowers bodily fluids in mouth and throat to keep one from choking on saliva
John weakly laughed, although it was humorless. “We’re not even lovers.” He muttered without thinking.
“Yes,” John said confidently. “I’ll take a cab. It’ll only be a few hours, and then I’ll meet you back here, if you’re done by then.”
“I’ll get someone to record your statement,” Sherlock started to turn around, but John caught his arm and gently held him in place.
“John’s fever has increased, and his immune system is weakened. He’s showing signs of the flu, so we’ve given him some basic antibiotics but his body has yet to show a reaction. It could be the drug slowing down the process, or the drug itself is doing all this and making his recovery occur at a slower rate.”
Sherlock chuckled as he took a step forward. John followed him by walking backwards and, out of habit, started to look down at their feet.
“She lived with me after she came back,” Lucy said slowly. “You can look anytime, and for as long as you like.”
John sniggered abruptly, and then clamped his mouth shut, taken aback by the sound. The snigger had vibrated through his body. It was familiar and addictive, causing John to smile again, slower but growing.
Sherlock shrugged. “You know this day is only important to me because it is to you. You had to work, I didn’t mind.”
John took a step but stopped when a figure peered through the door. The man pushed it opened and walked in. John’s shoulders relaxed with defeat and huffed out in annoyance.
Sherlock looked at Regina, and noticed her whole manner had changed. Her eyes were fierce and her posture was confident, unlike how she was upstairs.
“Tell me,” John started roughly. He cleared is throat and looked into Sherlock’s eyes, as if searching for some kind of clarification.
The medical team calmly hurried back to their places and Grey pressed her stethoscope to John’s chest.
After the beginning introductions, John was first to read his vow. He looked into Sherlock’s eyes, and took his hand.
Sherlock’s hands gently rested against John’s waist, and he trailed his left hand down his hip and towards his thigh. His hand was hesitant, and as it merely grazed the start of John’s thigh, he flinched. John jerked suddenly, and pulled apart. Sherlock’s eyes flickered with hurt and guilt, and he increased the distance between them.
John’s eyes flickered with uncertainty, and Sherlock instantly realized he had said something wrong.
Sherlock peered out of the corner of his eyes towards John's direction; John looked away and focused back to the front of the elevator.
His kisses were closed and chaste—peck after peck on John’s lip, and slowly becoming less frequent after each one, the next one becoming more affectionate and lasting longer. He pressed once more against John’s mouth, and parted his mouth slightly with a silent invitation. John hesitantly deepened the kiss, but the feeling in his leg started to increase and distract him.
John stepped stiffly to the front door of 221B, and unlocked it. There was a wreath on the door, and bells jingled as he opened it. Someone had built a ramp to the entrance, so Sherlock had no difficulty in entering. John closed the door behind them, grimacing slightly from the movement.
“Moran is starting the interrogation with John. He’s already starting to use extreme measures,” Kim said clearly, not attempting to keep any information from him.
“I’m simply surrendering. I did what you asked, so let John escape without trouble, and you get me.”
Before she could answer, Sherlock walked in with a slight rush in his step. He looked over John’s body, as if checking on his wellbeing, and then relaxed in his chair. The nurse smiled sympathetically at John, and then left. John settled back against the pillow, and took a deep breath to try to calm himself down.
Back in the conference room, Sherlock took a step back from the bulletin board. They had so much to do, and it was nearly midnight.
“John?” Sherlock needed clarification that he was okay; or that he will be. The reluctance from John about his condition didn’t extinguish Sherlock’s worries.
mafm, alicia, harry, emily, Fandom_Fan, Lil, allthatulovewillbecarriedaway, Cherazz, Jem, Talia, FoolishAngel1987, Katilyn, and edil. Thank you all and everyone else whose been sticking with the story. A big thanks to greenjello94 who has been kind to edit each chapter and constantly dealt my endless ranting on writers block--thanks sis!
Sherlock looked put out for a split second, and then tossed the pillow and blanket onto the table and then sat down in his own sitting chair.
“No,” Sherlock said without flinching. “He’s not hiding anything. If anything, he’s going to look for answers himself.”
using it suggested he had been awake through the entire night. He wasn’t having trouble sleeping; Sherlock knew that since he had managed to sleep at the hospital. So the reason as to why John would purposely stay up and resist sleep was beyond him.
“You do. But it’s late now and I think we should…I think I’ll go upstairs. This room will be easier for you.”
John sat on the edge of the bed, sounding out words in his head before speaking as Sherlock placed the socks back on his feet.
John parted his mouth and formed a word, but couldn’t seem to voice it. Instead, he managed a raspy sigh. His cheeks burning, he shut his mouth closed and looked away.
“Of course, John,” Sherlock said even though he knew it wasn’t a question John was asking, but a reassured realization. “Let’s go home.”
John grinned back, the glisten in his eyes having faded away completely now, however his eyes were still pink around the edges.
John shook his head without opening his eyes. The pain was increasing, and he just wanted a distraction, but he had been sleeping far too often, it was becoming incredibly boring. He could hear Sherlock hover by the bed, slowly starting to pace.
“Sometimes he did. But usually it was because of budget cuts. Most were interns, some residents. A couple of times it was because of a malpractice suit, but he never hears from them again.”
Kingston flinched. Sherlock stared down at him, realizing the man had slouched into his chair. His phone pinged and he pulled it out, scanned the text, and then looked back at Kingston.
The door banged open before he even had time to process. Sherlock was by his side in seconds and his arms were trying to reach under John’s, attempting to pull him upright.
Sherlock looked at John, slowly dragging his eyes over his body and stance. John was still pale, but not sickly so. After having suffered from an infection and fever off and on for the few months, not to the mention the gunshot wound that started it all, he looked rather well for what he had been through.
John smirked as he leaned in and pressed his lips softly against Sherlock’s. Sherlock gasped against John’s lips. The kiss was gently and closed for a few moments, before John parted his lips slightly. Sherlock deepened the kiss and pressed forward; John let out a low moan, and quickly reciprocated, swirling his tongue against Sherlock’s and sucking lightly on his lower lip.
John grinned and nodded. “Friends.” His grin turned into a smile and then turned around and left the flat. Sherlock remained where he was, an odd fluttering arising in his chest, and his brows furrowing in confusion as he stared at the spot where the John had stood a moment ago.
“His lunch isn’t for another hour. He’s already had a long morning,” Mandy pointed out. Sherlock seemed to tense for a moment, and then he relaxed.
John lay back down onto his back and gazed up at Sherlock. Sherlock stared down at him with longing, and with a rising blush on his cheekbones.
“What do we do?” John asked. Their surroundings glowed against the setting sun, contrasting with the distant streetlamps and light from the rising moon. There weren’t any other boats around, except for a small wooden dinghy that was tied up to the side of the deck. As John saw it, he immediately hoped it would be dismissed as an option. He was ultimately kidding himself.
Fuming, Sherlock continued shouting John’s name for another ten minutes, his frustration and his resentment towards his injury rising.
Sherlock hurried onto the Intensive Care floor, and headed directly to John’s room. There were a couple of doctors—Robbins and the other Sherlock didn’t recognize, and Margaret, the nurse—standing outside of John’s door.
“You can go yourself, Sherlock. Besides, I’m about to fall asleep again, and you look like you need some fresh air.”
John sighed and looked out the window to the hall. There were only a few nurses walking by, otherwise, it was deserted. He looked out the other window on his left; it was gloomy outside.
John nodded, and watched her leave. She reappeared after a few minutes, and handed him what he needed.
She looked at him with firm politeness. “It’s most likely the aneurysm starting to bleed. We’ll clip it and then take the tumor out. First we need to get him to CT now. Did he manage to consent?
Sherlock snuggled closer to him, tightening the blanket around is chest and burrowing the side of his face against John’s chest. They were leaning against Sherlock’s chair, with their legs outstretched in front of them, closer to the fire.
The two sighed heavily and glared at each other. Victor was the first to soften his expression, and he slouched his shoulders slightly.
Sherlock had rounded to Silken, only to have him standing on the edge of the warehouse, a seven-foot jump below.
Sherlock seemed to be debating something in his head, for he remained still for a few moments longer. John opened him mouth to speak, when Sherlock finally did.
John huffed, but sat down anyway, clenching his jaw. He rotated his body until he was facing Sherlock. Sherlock reached forward and caressed his cheek with his thumb.
He reached for a pillow and placed it behind Sherlock, who leaned against it. John stretched out his legs and rested against his side, laying his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and wrapping his arm around his abdomen.
This time, Mycroft scoffed. “About him still being married yet having an affair with one of his interns.”
“Greg? Yeah, I was technically the burglar. I’m fine. We need an ambulance, and can you bring Dr. John Willoughby to the hospital? He’s Sherlock’s doctor.”
This intrigued Sherlock just slightly and he turned to the man, placing a challenging look on his porcelain face. He eyed the man swiftly in one look up and down, and then read off his deductions as they came to him.
He looked down and stared at the handcuffs, attaching him to the desk chair. His affection and arousal were drowned by sudden irritation and disbelief.
John settled into the bed after a couple hours of stretching. He had done quite a few, took a break and had lunch, and then insisted he do more. He felt more suited in his body now, but he was feeling an odd sensation in his right thigh, leading down to the wound. He tried to ignore it and focus on Sherlock instead, who was looking at him with something akin to fondness.
John walked away with hesitating, stiff movements. Sherlock almost called out to him to come back, but restrained himself. As the door slowly came to a close, Sherlock was alone. He remembered a little of what had led to the coma, but most of the memories were fragments of scenes and sounds, John’s voice in particular.
Sherlock hovered by the wall while another nurse began stripping the detective of his sodden jacket, speaking to him but not receiving a response.
John looked up and spotted the level that would unlock the window. He stood up shakily and reached for it. It clicked open easily, and then John slid the window open. He felt a rush of cold air against his face, sending shivers down his body. It was mesmerizing, but he still couldn’t find a breath.
Sherlock froze in shock, his eyes widening at his sudden outburst. John kept his face in place from the blow, and slowly after a few deep breathes, he turned to look at the detective. His eyes were fuming—roaring with an ocean of emotions—as he held a hard stare.
Sherlock stood in front of them and observed each one. The one of the far left was wearing a white tank, the second wearing the exact jumper John had been wearing, and the third was wearing an oatmeal jumper—the one John had been wearing when he escaped the warrant. It was the exact one; Sherlock would know it anywhere. The other two were wearing similar striped jumpers, but still different.
“Always something on your plate,” John scoffed. “You can’t even stay for five minutes. Your brother is in the hospital—!”
“John—!” Sherlock gasped and picked up his pace. He breathed in large gulps against John’s neck. “Come like this, okay? Is this okay?”
John flickered his eyes to the man before blinking and returning his gaze to the clock above him. He refused to respond. A minute later, the hour was up, and John quickly stood and left the room.
Lucy nodded and furrowed her brows. John recalled the first time they had met, back at Scotland Yard.
Canterbury narrowed his eyes. “Sure.” He turned around to the shelves, and John took the opportunity to lean in beside Sherlock, placing his hand on his lover’s lower back.
“Oh, just as predicted. Still looking for a flatmate though,” Sherlock reported as he recalled their last boring conversation. He wasn’t really looking for one, but one would be like Mike and Molly were to him. Convenient.
“So are you going to…” Sherlock trailed off this time, unsure how to phrase his question. When he couldn’t finish it, he reframed it. “What are you going to do?” he asked, hoping it was clear what he was asking about.
John wasn’t sure how much time passed; he jolted awake once again in pain. The room spun and he felt unease. His blurred vision worsened as he tried to focus. Sherlock moved closer to him, his brows furrowed with worry. Sherlock seemed to know what was going to happen before John did, and placed a small, empty bucket in John’s lap just as he arched forward and vomited. John cried out as the pain flared through his injured shoulder. He scrunched his eyes tightly closed as he leaned back against the pillow. Sherlock wiped his face with a cloth, and then not very subtly moved the morphine control out of John’s reach.
“I’m trying to help, John! But you don’t talk to me. You have nightmares nearly every night, and you won’t let me help.”
Sherlock sauntered out the front door with John right behind him. They walked to the main street and hailed a cab. Sherlock busied himself with his phone when John spoke up.
John pulled out his phone, texted the DI, and waited. Lestrade responded quickly with what he had written down, and what the actual facts were with Canterbury, but according to the text, he wasn’t sure what John was going with his question.
John slept well into the evening, and when he did wake up, he didn’t feel any better, and was in fact, alone. John felt worse—groggy, exhausted, and he wanted to go back to sleep. He briefly thought Sherlock would be home by the time his second nap was done. His first nap had been peaceful, so as he lay back down against the pillow, John hoped that maybe, with sleep, perchance he wouldn’t dream.
John breathed heavily against Sherlock’s back. Sherlock’s breath was hot against his skin, sending shivers down his flushed body. John sighed contently and parted his eyes. Sherlock was looking at him in a dazed, unfocused way, but his face was relaxed. John grinned at the sight and trailed his fingertips lightly against Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock shifted closer and grazed his nose against John’s cheek.
John pulled his wrists away and walked past Sherlock. “I’m fine, Sherlock. Really, I don’t know what’s been getting into me…”
He looked up Sherlock with a mixture of jealously, resentment, and frustration, but only saw amusement in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Your sister inherited it too, but had plastic surgery, though it’s still similar. But her eyes, oh they’re brown like yours with nearly identical flecks. Identical twins are rare, but one to go to so many lengths not to look like the other, nearly desperate for something to differentiate between the two. Associating with terrorism is one way of doing it.”
“I couldn’t do it.” He whispered to himself. “I couldn’t make you leave, y-you look just like him. It—.” John shut his eyes tight, clenching his fists. “It felt like
“Because you’ve been indoors for nearly three weeks. You need fresh air and sunlight. It’s a warm day out, so we’re going. I’ll find some kind of bottoms you could wear.” John headed upstairs, and came back quickly, already changed into a pair of old shorts, and holding another in his hand.
John nodded but didn’t move. He set aside the paper and appeared anxious, even distant, and wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eye. Sherlock was sure of the reason now.
“This is the post, dear. Some is from a few days ago, and something from the detective inspector. I’ll put it on the table for you.”
Halfway to the doctor’s office, Sherlock froze in his seat and turned to John. John waited and watched him carefully. Sherlock’s face slowly relaxed to a familiar expression, and then to confusion, then to realization.
“John,” Sherlock moaned impatiently. John grunted, and rolled his hips, hitting the right spot and knowingly sending shivers through Sherlock’s veins.

“Absolutely not,” she retorted, narrowing his eyes. She looked at Lestrade, and his sigh instantly told Sherlock it was out of the question.
The pair rushed upstairs, kicking off shoes and pulling off jackets as John walked backwards into the sitting room, kissing Sherlock deeply and holding him closely.
“I suppose you’ll be heading back now? Mary tends to get irritated whenever you stay here overnight.”
John swallowed tightly as he got used to the unknown feeling. “It pinches,” he murmured. He was starting to feel overwhelmed, and really wished Sherlock was here.
“Morning, Sherlock,” he said casually. “Rosie took her first steps last night. Wished I had filmed it for you, but I didn’t want my hands full in case she fell.”
Once at their flat, John managed to get Sherlock seated on the sofa while he hung up their coats. There was a knock on the door, voices murmuring, and then Lucy appeared with her mother beside her.
“The room looks nice. You did a good job,” John said. He smiled, and Sherlock smiled back, but it felt too strained and forced.
John sat down, resting his palms behind him and leaned against them. His oatmeal jumper nearly blended in with the yellow flowers surrounding him, and appeared more faded than it really was in the sunlight. His body glowed with a light shade of gold, and a faint rosy blush surfaced on his cheeks. He looked out to the ocean, as Sherlock watched him, waiting for an explanation he knew was soon coming.
“Were you ever going to tell me?” John asked, stroking Sherlock’s hair back and reapplying the damp cloth to his forehead.
Sherlock yelled at them as he ran towards them. The woman—Mary—picked up her pace and headed to a car. She started fumbling with the keys when she turned suddenly and faced Sherlock, pulling out a gun and aiming it at John’s head.
“Look, it’ll just be for a week or two. That might not be ideal, psychologically or scientifically or whatever, but think of it as an experiment—,”
Sherlock turned to her. “Interesting last name. Morstan. You wanted your father’s name rather than your mother’s, but then you got married. When Stan started getting involved in terrorists and oversees underground networks, you changed it before it was recorded. Morstan sure is an interesting combination.”
Sherlock observed the area. The air smelled musky, no doubt from the various businessmen and pollution but another scent was fresher. There was a mix with something familiar…
John nodded, and smiled with relief. He leaned forward and rested his head against Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock rested his check against John’s temple.
Mary turned to John, and pressed the recording to start again. Apparently she had stopped it; Sherlock hadn’t noticed until now.
Sherlock widened his eyes a bit, observing his profile. He was fairly young, early thirties, wearing a t-shirt and department store jeans. He hadn’t shaved in nearly two days, and didn’t have a proper one in weeks. His shoes had been expensive, but were worn carelessly and nearly everyday, so he doesn’t care for them…
Sherlock nodded and removed his coat and jacket, and then his shirt and trousers followed. He crawled onto the bed and over John, causing John to have to lie back down. Sherlock looked down at him, and grinned softly.
John’s head snapped up and he looked at Sherlock. Sherlock was looking at him, his eyes flickering with confusion and he brows knitted together. John held his tongue, and waited, keeping his eyes on Sherlock’s expression.
Hearing those words from John wrenched at Sherlock; he knew that John trusted him of course, but hearing him say it was rare. He looked around for anything he could use to free them, but breaking metal cuffs were nearly impossible.
Sherlock perked up. He pondered for a long moment, before standing up and gathering his coat. “Do you have privileges outside the building?”
John grinned. “I would have, yeah. Afterwards, they took me to a basement but I escaped. I’ll explain everything when we’re…”
“You won’t be going alone, then,” John said as he sat down. Sherlock blinked and slowly turned to face him.
Sherlock watched John as he went up the steps to their flat, waiting for any kind of pause or chance of stumbling. He didn’t say a word, and neither did John. Since his apology, John hadn’t said much, concerning Sherlock. He was still bothered by John’s stubbornness, but he didn’t think John would still be angry at him for going against his word.
John sighed, but allowed him to continue. Sherlock reopened his eyes and fixated them on his brother, and fortunately all he found was serious concern, nothing of brotherly compassion.
Once finished, John put the shaving supplies away into the kit and set it down on the bedside table. He didn’t want to move Rosie, who was still fascinated by the bee. John reclined in his chair, accustomed to not having much else to do. He didn’t always bring Rosie with him, but deep down he thought that maybe—just maybe—Sherlock would wake up for her. John knew Sherlock was fond of Rosie, as was Rosie of Sherlock. Maybe that would be a reason. John didn’t have much faith in himself as someone Sherlock would wake up for.
Sherlock didn’t respond, and kept his gaze on their interlocked hands. He tried to recall what had happened, but only remembered fragments. He had spoken to Moriarty, and stood on the edge, talking to John, and then... Flashes of light. Blood. Pain. John.
John trembled and shuffled closer to the wall. Something warm began to dampen his pajama bottoms, and he cowered further away from Sherlock, his cheeks burning red now.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. His eyes flickered over John’s face, as if he was looking for something.  “I made a mistake, John—.”
John had tried to escape the doctors as he continued hallucinating. But he couldn’t fight them off, let alone even shift his left arm. Sherlock cringed at the memory. At least then, he knew John was in pain, albeit he couldn’t do much. But now John was quiet, so Sherlock didn’t know exactly what was going on in his head. John was constantly tense—constantly under the appearance of being in pain; Sherlock didn’t know how much and what he could do to comfort him. John didn’t respond to his asks and even gave up trying to get the morphine control from Sherlock. It was only at night that he knew, but it was just as unbearable to hear John whimper and cry out in his sleep than to hear nothing at all.
Victor broke the silence. “Sherlock and I met in university,” he said. John looked up at him, his curiosity rising and his need for a distraction. Victor met his eyes and continued. “I was the one who got him into drugs.”
The door barged open, a whirl of a coatless detective came thundering in, desperation and determination piercing the serene veil of the room with his sharp turns and gazes.
John suddenly felt nervous, and inhaled as deep as he could (his lungs were still sore from surgery) and waited until Sherlock was in the room, on the other side of the plastic, alone as Margaret left them in private.
Sherlock blinked at the confession and stared up at John. He twisted away from John, whose hands went back to his wound, taking Sherlock’s scarf from his neck and pressing down. Sherlock grasped John’s wrist and pushed it off his wound. The minute John’s hands left his chest, he stilled, his eyes starring vacant on the wall. The red dot vanished and footsteps were heard going up the stairs then out of earshot.
“Mycroft, what happened?” Sherlock walked towards his brother, his voice firm and his posture tense with a hidden sense of worry.
This chapter was quite inspired by Grey's Anatomy episode "Some Kind of Miracle." but you don't have to watch the show to read this.
, 2014? He was with me, in London. You Americans may not know this, but I spent some time away, and came back in March. We spent nearly all of spring together, like a pre-honeymoon, without the sex. Until summer of course.”
“S-stupid…” John mumbled. He inhaled sharply, but winced. It was still hard to breath. Vanessa pressed against his abdomen, causing John to inhale sharply again, and groaned. It was tender—
Sherlock sat down, keeping his eyes on the man in the bed. He kept his hands by his side as he waited.
John nodded. “Yeah, Sherlock hit his head and, um,” John inhaled deeply. “Back in the spring, when we were solving your father’s murder, he showed suspicious symptoms, and I visited that doctor you recommended, but it turned out to be the same drugs your mother was exposed to. However, the symptoms did appear afterwards for a short while, but it wasn’t nearly as bad, and then he was back to normal. Dr. Willoughby said he as early onset…”
Sherlock let out a sigh of relief, John performed far better than expected, his camaraderie felt almost genuine. For some reason, Sherlock rather liked the feeling. “Excellent work, John. You were quite convincing.”
Being ignored would have been bad enough, but what made it all worse were the new injuries. Just when the initial bruises started to fade, others started to show up; a cut above Sherlock’s eyebrow, a nasty red mark along his jaw, Sherlock held himself awkwardly, his movements stiff.
John couldn’t believe what he was hearing; Sarah was his friend, she was meant to be on his side. She was supposed to be agreeing that Sherlock was out of line!
Forty-eight minutes and thirty-four seconds, to be exact, but Sherlock wasn’t going to give John the satisfaction of knowing he was counting.
“It’s just a formality, school policy.” John said, trying to keep his voice calm and reassuring, as he watched Sherlock walk back and forth. “The school won’t dole out punishment without a hearing. It’s going to be just fine.”
“You worrying that we’d never have met if we hadn’t been put in the same class. Of course we would have met. Of course we’d be right here,” murmured John, his hold on Sherlock’s waist momentarily tightening, “dancing to this song you wrote for us, that you wrote for our wedding.”
“My lips are sealed… Have you guys heard anything new about John? I’m assuming they’re bringing him back here.”
And so over the course of the next few weeks, every Tuesday and Thursday, John sat himself in the desk nearest to the door in an attempt to talk to Sherlock. Every Tuesday and Thursday Sherlock brushed him off.
“Yes, yes. Well, we had planned on coming to you in the morning, but since we’re here,” Mr. Holmes shot Sherlock another reassuring look, “would you be so kind as to let us have a look at it ourselves?”
“Yeah, but I've done something a bit similar.” John says, turning to lie on his side, admiring a thoroughly shagged Sherlock Holmes. “So why me? Clearly you’ve done other things with other people, so why this with me? Why now?”
For perhaps twenty seconds, John was rendered speechless, unable to do anything but stare at Sherlock, trying to process one of the most absurd things he’d ever heard.
“Oh, it was nothing really.” John shrugged, glancing down at the floor before looking back up at Sherlock. “She was just telling me that she’s never seen me look so happy, and she’s glad I finally realized that you were the one for me.”
“Yes, I want to hyphenate our names. When we go to the clerk’s office tomorrow to give our notice, I want – I want to pick up change of name forms.”
“Yes, alright, you have a deal.” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes with a sigh. However, there was still that brilliant smile and faint blush that told John that the idea of a proper date was not the least bit unwelcomed. “Now go get changed, and if you’re not back here in three minutes, I’m coming up there and dragging you back down myself, regardless of whether you’re ready or not.” He commanded, pushing John towards the stairs.
A long weekend away with Sherlock... at Sherlock’s house... with Sherlock’s parents. That could be… something.
He just had to survive until the formal dinner started, and everyone would be paying attention to the guest speakers. Snatching a flute of champagne from a passing tray, Sherlock scanned the room in hopes of finding a somewhere to hide and wait out the reception. Unfortunately, luck was not on Sherlock’s side, the room offered nothing. What formal ballroom worth anything didn’t have at least one secluded alcove? Weren’t there supposed to be places for clandestine meetings between secret lovers? Useless, the entire place was useless, Sherlock cursed. He would just have to constantly stay on the move, appear he had a destination in mind. Maybe that would keep all the
Sherlock gave himself a shake to clear his thoughts and get a handle on his nerves. It didn’t help. God, he hadn’t been this scattered in years. “Good.” He said clearing his throat for good measure. “So, you were trying to get my attention. What, um, what do you need?”
Partially taking Leah’s advise, John did run down to the café to buy himself a sandwich, but brought it back to Sherlock’s room to wait, and while he waited, he used the time to update everyone as much as he could. Running on over forty-eight hours of practically no sleep, he knew he really should have tried to get some rest, but every time John tried closing his eyes, he just saw Sherlock bleeding out, he imagined waking up to a world without Sherlock. No, he would rest when it was Sherlock telling him to go to sleep, and not a second sooner.
“Good. Then let’s go, and in about two and a half hours, this will all be over with.” John smiled, reaching up a hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek, his thumb sweeping across Sherlock’s cheekbone. It was a comfort, a reassurance, but Sherlock’s heart still skipped a beat or two.
Not knowing what else to do, Sherlock sighed. “Fine. Last Friday, after I wrapped up that nanny stalking case for you, I… ah… I met someone.”
“I figured out that much for myself, thanks. I mean what were you doing coming upstairs? And what was with the biscuits and beer?”
– inside me. I want you to open – open me up – I want to feel you move – I want to feel you move inside me – Oh god, John I want you.”
“Yeah, that’s probably the last thing I want to do. Believe me, no amount of help on casework is worth walking in on that,” said Lestrade with an overly dramatic shudder. “I’m sure we can manage the rest of the night without you two.”
“Seriously?” Becca laughed. “Why did you stop to talk to them? We should have grabbed your computer and gotten out of there!”
John was just getting up to leave, trying to salvage what little dignity he had left, when a young man approached him.
“If I’m being honest, with it all said and done, I’m relieved it ended. I think I only asked her to marry me because I thought it was what we were supposed to do. We’d been together for a few years, and that’s what was done. I cared about her, well what I thought I knew of her anyway, but there was never really that spark.” Certainly not the same kind of spark he’d felt with other people… felt with another person.
“There’s absolutely nothing to be worried about,” Dr Cook said, trying to reassure John, “Sherlock’s new room is only a few doors away, just up the hallway. I’m still his doctor, and he’ll be getting the same exact level of care and attention. His brother felt a less exposed room would be better. It’s larger too, has its own bathroom, so that should be more comfortable for you, since I’m assuming you’re going to be staying as well.”
name, John’s name. John had done this to him, it was a high he didn’t know he was worthy of, to be the one to drive Sherlock Holmes to the point of such disorder and delirium.
“Whatever. I overheard you chatting her up when you refilled your drink. But when you saw me, your eyes dilated and your breathing increased, both clear signs of attraction.” Sherlock finishes, sounding both proud and a bit hesitant.
“No, no. Ms. Yao and her staff were neither victims nor perpetrators,” Sherlock assured him. Honestly, he thought John was cleverer than to think Sherlock would allow such an operation to continue. “No, there was a sunbed place across the street. This restaurant just proved to be an excellent vantage point, and Ms. Yao was quite accommodating, allowing me to sit and observe the goings on across the street for hours.”
medical expertise. Maybe I’ll go to the crime scene and not say a word. I’ll just sit back and watch you work”
It was Mike. John had texted him earlier to tell him a little of what had happened, and check with him if it was alright Sherlock stay at theirs for the foreseeable future.
“No! Not like that!” Sherlock frowned. Honestly, did he seem high, did ye seem like he was coming down? “A regular person. I just… ended up spending more time with him than I originally planned. It left me a bit… confused.”
“Do you have any plans for tomorrow?” Sherlock asked when John got up to leave. Apparently he had plans for an early dinner with his sister – alcoholic, in the midst of a divorce, hoping to still have time to go barhopping and find a partner for the night after meeting with John – and he didn’t want to be late.
“Oh, but before you forget I exist, is there a chance you have a charger that fits my phone?” John asked.
See, it's going to be alright eventually. And I gave you some drugged up Sherlock san filter, does that make things even slightly better???? Plus there was some John 'Man on a Mission' Watson, that's always nice, right?
Now about this chapter, just as a heads-up, there are some derogatory/homophobic terms said. I hope no one is offended.
“I’m really sorry, but I don’t know what to tell you.” Imogen said as she sat across from Lestrade and Sherlock. She was calm, she was cooperative, but she gave them nothing. She was utterly useless. Apparently she was just cutting through the square on her way back from lunch, when she saw a small pile of trash on the ground.
“Deal” Sherlock smiled, taking John’s outstretched hand to seal their agreement. John’s hand was so warm, the calluses felt… nice against Sherlock’s palm, and if Sherlock let his grip linger for a few extra seconds, John didn’t seem to notice, or say anything.
“What? I’m not doing it because I have to, I’m doing it because I want to. Besides, I can play football with them again if I wanted to… Wait,” John paused, his brow furrowing, but the smile on his face remained in place. “How did you know about our pick-up football game?”
“I anticipated that problem and took care of it.” John beamed. “It’s not gourmet or anything, but I had a few choices of soups delivered. Chicken noodle – always a classic – a tomato soup, creamy potato, and broccoli cheddar. It’s your choice, but I’d suggest the potato, it’ll probably be easiest on your stomach, and more calorie rich.”
There before him stood Sherlock, a frown firmly set on his face, in a pair of pale blue swim trunks covered in orange birds. John failed to keep a snort of laughter from escaping his lips.
Interesting story. There's a hot pot restaurant where I live, right next to a suntanning place. There are some sketchy people who go in and out of the suntanning salon, and my friends and I have a running joke that it's a front for some illegal dealings. Now that I think about it, I really hope it's not human trafficking!
“Mmmmm, right… uuuhh… it’s right… aaaah… so right.” Sherlock breathed, giving up control to John, following his lead. It was intoxicating.
“No! I don’t need anyone fighting my battles for me” Who the hell did John think he was? Sherlock didn’t need a hero.
“Don’t be an idiot, John, there’s no way you’re going out now, even if the snow has stopped. And I have a second bedroom upstairs. I use it for storage, but there is a bed up there. It’s yours if you want it.”
Sherlock turned to the woman. “Sorry Mrs. Hudson.” A genuine smile on his face. “We were just discussing how the weather is preventing John from being on his way.”
to marry you.” Sherlock’s words were sounding slurred and his movement were growing more and more uncoordinated. He was getting close, John could tell.
“I said,” Sherlock huffed, “give me a minute to change my clothes, then I’ll give you back what you lent me… Thank you, by the way.” He added almost as an afterthought.
“But I still want to be with you tomorrow!” Sherlock blurted. “I mean, we’re still getting together tomorrow, aren’t we? I’ll understand if things are different now, but we… we usually do stuff on the weekends.” Christ, one minor misstep and all his confidence abandoned him; pathetic.
“Wow, down to the hundredth of a second, impressive. Well I’ve never argued with you when it comes to your mind before, so who am I to start now?”
John felt a chill run down his spine, this man had been watching them, watching his and Sherlock’s movements. “Alright, who the hell are you?”
“Just that,” John groaned. “You’re recovering from a pretty nasty beating. I mean look, you’re still limping!” He sighed, looking pointedly at Sherlock’s leg. “I know you, Sherlock, you can’t take things easy. A few more days of rest will give your healing a serious head start.”
It was light streaming in from an unfamiliar angle that woke John, blinding him even through his closed eyelids. As he buried his face in an unfamiliar pillow, John felt a weight shift behind him, and an arm drape itself across his bare waist, and the events of previous night came flooding back. He remembered Bill dragging him out to the club. He remembered Sherlock, flirting with Sherlock, dancing with Sherlock, kissing Sherlock, going home with Sherlock, holding and touching Sherlock. He remembered resting his eyes for a moment –
“Despite what you seem to think, I’m not stupid. You’ve never been this worked up over a lack of a case before. There’s clearly something else bothering you.”
“Hmm? Up where?” Sherlock asked, the words coming out more as a groggy groan than a coherent question.
“Bed? No, I’m… I’m f-f-f-fine.” Sherlock said through a yawn, whilst standing up and leaning heavily on John.
Sherlock, however, wasn’t listening and continued. “I never intended to make things awkward between us, nor do I want you to be uncomfortable.”
“No, why do you care?” Sherlock had been dealing with this type of thing all his life, the perils of being the only one with a functioning mind in a sea of idiots. Nobody cared before.
He carefully took hold of Sherlock’s hand, the one without any needles or tubes or monitors attached. His hand was warm, the skin on the back of it was soft and smooth – Sherlock had such surprisingly smooth skin – but it lay limp in John’s grasp.
Sherlock had to bite his cheek to keep from grinning. It’d be ‘a bit not good’ to smile at a time like this, but John said his name; John was thinking about him, wanted him. “But he’s going to be okay?” He said quietly.
“In the meantime,” John grinned and used his other arm to wrap around Sherlock’s waist, guiding Sherlock onto his back on the couch before settling on top of him, “we lay here together and you let me kiss you until you’re as simple and as mindless as the rest of us.”
“I’m not all that hungry either, so I was actually thinking,” John said, lifting his arm when they reached the curb in what turned out to be a fruitless attempt to hail a cab, “that we just head back to Baker Street now, and later we can go out somewhere for an early-ish dinner. You pick, it’ll be my treat to celebrate the end of therapy.”
“Would you be terribly displeased if I cut this evening’s lesson short?” Sherlock asked, already moving to pull a change of clothes out of his bag and heading for the bathroom.
“You don’t… you don’t have to take the second bedroom, you know.” He said, eyes forward, not looking at John.
Of course, even with Sherlock’s visible improvement, that didn’t stop John from making sure he was always on hand should Sherlock need help with anything, but Sherlock actually managed well enough on his own. He could stand unsupported for longer and longer periods of time, he could maneuver around the flat on his crutches with ease, and when they went to his doctor’s appointment, navigating up and down the stairs only took half as long as before. He still needed to hold on to something – usually John – if he wanted to actually walk, but if he held on to John, he could walk between the kitchen and sitting room with very little incident. Sherlock was terrible when it came to doing Heather’s “homework assignments”, so John found himself helping out with those too. In the evenings, before turning in for the night, he’d make Sherlock do the assigned exercises. Like with the eating, Sherlock would groan and grumble, but do them all the same. John actually suspected the petulance was all for show, because after Sherlock was done, he’d usually see a proud little smile flit across Sherlock face, followed quickly by an eyeroll and another complaint. Secretly, John found it just a bit charming, but only just. He didn’t to inflate Sherlock’s ego any more than it already was.
“Sherlock, it’s me,” came John’s voice from the other side of the door, “Malcolm gave me the spare key. I’m coming in.”
I just want to thank everyone who as read, kudo'd, and commented on this fic. I really enjoyed writing it, and I really hope you enjoyed reading it.
John was just helping Sherlock out of the car, when the front door of 221 Baker Street swung open, revealing an anxious but excited looking Mrs. Hudson.
Lestrade hesitated for a moment before relenting. “Fine, but just please be considerate of her state. She’s had quite a fright, and got a nasty bump on the head.”
Sherlock couldn’t believe how good it felt to tell John all of this, to talk about his past, to talk about rehab. He had never talked to his parents or Mrs. Hudson about his time there – not for lack of trying on their parts – but with John it all came rushing out, and Sherlock didn’t mind. He actually liked it, it was like a weight lifting off his shoulders. Once he started, he didn’t want to stop. John listened, he understood, he didn’t judge, and he forgave Sherlock his abominable behavior – along with the understanding that he not
my future mother-in-law? Not on your life,” John snorted, his head popping around the side of the door. “One used to run a cartel, and I’ve heard stories of what happens when the other ‘goes monstrous.’ I may love you more than anything in this world, but those two scare me.”
“No,” John said, shaking his head. “I just don’t spy on people for money, or for creepy men who kidnap me off the street.”
“Of course I do. I love you too, Sherlock, one hundred percent.” John breathed, kissing Sherlock deeply, slowly, so, very, very slowly.
“Sherlock,” he said quietly, turning around, “you’re my friend just as much as they are.” More so, but he couldn’t tell Sherlock that.
Less than twenty minutes after leaving Carrows, John was following Sherlock out of a cab, past the flashing blue lights of a police car, and into an honest to god crime scene. He couldn’t believe his luck, he absolutely loved hearing about Sherlock’s cases, picturing Sherlock dash about as he retold and relived his adventures, but now he was going to see Sherlock in action. It wasn’t just stories anymore; he was going to see it firsthand.  John couldn’t stop grinning, though perhaps that was a tad inappropriate, a woman had been attacked and her house burgled.
“You like me? Again, you don’t know me.” Sherlock was more confused than ever. This didn’t make any sense; why would John like him? Nobody liked him, especially not someone as personable as John.
“Good.” John beamed, glancing down at their hands. “I’m actually really glad we did this, got the rings here. It gives them even more meaning, they’re like a permanent tie to this place, a permanent reminder of this fantastic weekend.”
That got Sherlock’s attention. “Me and John?” he said and automatically glanced towards the door that led to the hallway that lead to the mortuary. “What are you talking about, Lestrade? What story?”
“Fuck the universe.” John breathed. “No, no you don’t.” And then John’s arms came up to wrap around Sherlock’s back and those last few millimeters were demolished.
“I know, I know. You and Sherlock ‘aren’t a couple.’ Hate to break it to you, mate, but you’ve been in a relationship for over a year now, and a pretty serious one at that. Just make it official.” Greg says, receiving only a glare from John. “Alright, fine, I’ll shut up. But seriously, what’s got you in such a good mood?”
“Don’t worry, Mrs. Hudson, we’d be happy to help.” John pipped up, flashing Mrs. Hudson a reassuring smile. “Come on, it’s the least you can do.” He said as he stood up, slapping Sherlock’s knee in the process. So clearly they were just going to ignore what almost happened between them.
Apparently Sherlock was thinking the same thing, because John could feel Sherlock’s smile against his lips. “Forever sounds perfect.”
“That’s me,” John chuckled, still feeling a bit of kilter. “So… poisoned bath soaps and a faked snake bite.” He said in an attempt to shift the topic. It worked, and soon all discussion of his ‘helping hands’ was forgotten as Sherlock went through the case, explaining to John every single thought and observation which lead to the next thought, and the next observation. He was… his thinking was fascinating.
Everything he did, everywhere he looked, John, John, John! Sherlock had to get to the bottom of this. He was going to figure out John Watson, if it was the last thing he did. Surely one football playing medical student couldn’t be too hard to crack.
“Oh hoho! So that’s the real reason you want me to come with you,” John laughed. “You’re just hoping I keep your brother away!”
“Alright,” Sherlock nodded. “Say Sebastian and the others don’t try to back out, but what if the committee doesn’t do anything? They could acknowledge the wrong doing, but still do nothing. It happens all the time!”
Almost half their year decided to see them, to tell them how worried they were, how relieved they were that John and Sherlock were safe. Well, that might have been a bit of an exaggeration, but it certainly felt like half the year paraded themselves through the Watson home. A few of John’s football mates wanted to know when John would be ready to join them on the field again. John must have read the look of horror on Sherlock’s face, and nipped that idea in the bud; ‘
“No, it’s perfect.” Whitney says, barely above a whisper. “It’s what brought you back.” At that, John surges forward, capturing Whitney’s mouth once more. Soon Whitney lifts her arms above her head as John pushes her shirt off her.
John frowned slightly. “Consulting detective.” He said slowly, as if testing the words, processing them. “What does that mean?”
“I think you might be right.” Sherlock yawned. Though he hated to admit it, with everything it had gone through in the past day, his transport demanded rest.
Minutes later, they had tracked the woman entering in Square empty handed, pass behind a kiosk, emerge moments later holding the carton, and move immediately to throw it away. They also had a name. Sherlock should have probably wondered how his mother knew how to access government facial recognition programs. Then again, she did write part of the algorithm the program used. But that didn’t matter at the moment, they had a name: Imogen Riley, 24, accounting intern at a firm not too far from the Square.
He could feel another part of him breaking. “Mummy… please.” Sherlock said, his voice almost inaudible. After finding John’s phone, for it only to give them nothing, Sherlock needed to stay moving, had to keep active.
Confused, John looked down at himself. He was wearing a pair of jeans and a jumper, no different than most days. Alright, so the jumper was new, and of slightly better quality than his usual everyday dress, but it wasn’t like he was in a tux or anything.
John dropped his bag in the entry by the door and carefully placed the box he’d been carrying on the side table. “That can’t be comfortable,” he mused, eyeing Sherlock’s precarious position.
“There’s… um… there’s something I want to talk to you about. You may not like, but I want you to try to listen.”
“It’s up on the second floor and at the end of the hall. Apparently, it’s very private,” he added, giving Sherlock a wink, and headed for the stairs.
“We have no doubt you could” his mummy said, rubbing soothing circles into his back. She was just trying to placate him. It wasn’t going to work, no matter how good it felt.
“As you can see, the note is highly suggestive that he left on his own. The handwriting matches John’s, does it not?” Butler said as he watched father and son. He wasn’t wrong, the handwriting did look very much like John’s, but it was still wrong.
Grinning, John slid the band onto Sherlock’s finger; the silver looking beautiful against Sherlock’s pale skin. Oh yes, now the picture was complete.
“Very true, very true.” John sighed. “But I can’t imagine I’m the only John Watson in all of London.”
“What?” John murmured, his voice coming out low and muffled as his lips slid along Sherlock’s jaw. “What do you need? Tell me Love… tell me what you need.”
“I’d – I’d like to see you try.” Sherlock stumbled trying to recapture some of his earlier teasing bravado.
“He is the teaching assistant in our class, Molly, a class that is held on Thursdays, so it would hold that the probability of seeing him on Thursday is very high.” Honestly, Molly was one of the few non-idiots at the school; Sherlock couldn’t have her go and start becoming one now.
“Sherlock? Sherlock, are you still in there?” Came John’s voice, breaking the flurry of thoughts whirling though Sherlock’s head.
“Springy. You’re ridiculous John. And you’ve got me off track,” Sherlock said with a sigh. “I came here to tell you that he tried to grab me again just now. Came up behind me and tried to wrench my arm behind my back –”
By the end of the night, when Sherlock had regaled John with stories of his various cases, and thoroughly pissed off everyone else at the party, both boys are pleasantly tipsy and it’s time to go. As fate, destiny, or sheer dumb luck would have it, Sherlock lives not too far from John, so they’re able to walk together and continue their conversation. Well, it is more of a slow stumble and ongoing babble interpreted with giggles.
At this Sherlock smiled again, and actually had the gall to chuckle. “Oh John, you have to know it’s going to take way more than any fall for you to get rid of me. You’re rather stuck with me I’m afraid. Besides it wasn’t even five feet. I’ve tripped and fallen further.”
” John had to bite his lip to keep from crying out as Sherlock finally – FINALLY! – took him into his mouth, swirling his tongue around John’s leaking head, sucking every so slightly.
Poorly stifling a laugh, John grins. “Alright, Marple, I’m going to temp my family’s fate with another drink. Then you are going to tell me about everyone else here.” Perhaps his drinks were already getting to him, while never shy, John had never been this bold with a new acquaintance before.
“I think the word you’re looking for is ‘relationship’, and of course I’m getting something out of it. I get to share my life with the most brilliant, most gorgeous, most wonderful, most amazing man I have ever met. I get to be with a man who fills my life with excitement and such unrivaled happiness. And well… let’s just say I have yet to be left unsatisfied in
“I don’t know if I could get used to all the nicknames.” He continued, attempting to shake off his doubts. “You’re ‘Three-C’, Paul is ‘Phantom’, Mike is ‘McCoy’, and apparently I’m ‘Thursday’ now. It’s all a bit much.”
“Thank God you said something,” John breathed, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s, his eyes still closed, “I was dreading having to go upstairs and leave you down here. I was hoping you’d suggest something.”
“I got full feeling and range of motion back, so I’d say so. I mean, it’s still aches at times, and I have that transient tremor, so like I said, being a surgeon again is out of the question.”
“But how can I be your best friend?” Sherlock frowned. “We haven’t even known each other six months.”
“That did it, maybe for good.” Sherlock shuddered. “Now I believe my husband wants to dance, after you, Dr. Holmes.”
Sherlock on bed rest was a nightmare, an absolute, living, breathing, whining nightmare. By early Monday evening, John was seriously considering calling up Dr. Drier and getting another dose of whatever they drugged Sherlock with at the hospital. At least that way he’d be a bit more relaxed, and less argumentative. At the rate things were going, John was going to be completely grey by twenty-five.
As their guests joined in Harry’s toast, John excused himself from Sherlock’s side, and made his way over to his sister.
“You know, I’m actually dreading having to put my clothes back on.” He laughed, stepping back into Sherlock’s room. “I’ve been wearing them since Friday, and now I’m all clean… What is it? What’s wrong?” He finally caught sight of Sherlock sitting on the bed, staring stony-eyed back at him.
“I – ah – I guess I’ll see you in lecture on Tuesday, then.” Sherlock said, finally, breaking the silence that had begun to drag.
John had arrived outside of Sherlock’s door just in time to catch the tail end of a conversation going on inside the room.
“No don’t –” Sherlock started to protest, John couldn’t see him like this. But it was too late, John had already opened the door and was kneeling by Sherlock’s bed.
“You’re a damn superhero, aren’t you? Solving crimes, fighting for truth and justice” John says, struggling to stand and execute is best power stance.
John carefully pushed the door open and found himself in a very posh looking office. Everything from the wood paneling on the walls, to the bookshelves, to the desk looked hand carved, and it all smelled of fine leather and even finer liquor. And there, stood right in the middle of it all was a man who looked even posher than the office. He was tall, wearing a pristine three-piece suit, and not a single dark auburn hair was out of place.
“I’m fine sir. Sherlock and I met at a party, he was telling me all about what he does, and offered to let me tag along. It’s nice to see you again, sir.” John, shaking the proffered hand, then turning to a confused Sherlock, “I play football with Greg, remember?”
“I think it’s safe to say that we’ve allowed enough time for our dinner to be sufficiently digested.” Sherlock said once the kiss broke several minutes later.
They ignored the glares of fellow students and library staff as they talked and laughed. They snacked on crisps and granola bars, and split a sandwich John pulled from his backpack – which weren’t exactly allowed in the library, but Sherlock certainly wasn’t going to rat him out. Sherlock couldn’t think of anything more perfect. This was perfect. John was…
Sherlock had decided he wanted to practice counterattacks and escapes again. Escapes tended to involve the most bodily contact – John wrapping his arms around Sherlock from behind, holding him tight to keep him from getting away – and well, John would have had to have been an actual idiot to say no. Maybe he should have said no. Sure he had been aching to be close to Sherlock, but they hadn’t been so close in months and it was far too similar to the imagined scenarios – fantasies – that played out in John’s head nearly every night. He could feel every inch of Sherlock’s lean, warm back pulled flush against his chest. His nose was all but buried against the side of Sherlock’s neck, and John could smell the heady mix of clean sweat and Sherlock’s ridiculously expensive honey scented body wash. Worst of all, Sherlock’s firm – perfect – arse rested just above his…
“Well I have to leave, but… well… you solve crimes for bloody Scotland Yard! I’ve got to know more about that, and Sunday’s my only free day.”
It was a gentle, warm pressure moving along his eyebrow and down to trace his cheekbone, that stirred Sherlock from the gossamer haze of sleep. Kisses, someone was kissing him awake; he was being kissed awake by…
It was bad enough he had to deal with getting every single injury documented – often from multiple angles – and explain their rudimentary plan multiple times to those involved, but the fact that they needed Mycroft to put it all together just made it worse. It was Sherlock’s own fault really, he had wanted to handle everything privately, and Mycroft had the resources necessary to facilitate it. Sherlock’s father had the resources as well, but given his position, he agreed to step in only if absolutely necessary. So Sherlock was stuck sitting across from Mycroft yet again.
“And I told you I’m not a dancer.” John’s words didn’t have quite the amount of bite he had hoped for.
Next up WE learn a bit more about John's captors (Sherlock doesn't, though), and Sherlock starts investigating on his own.
John remained silent, his heart pounding in his chest – because of anger or something else, he didn’t quite know.
“Wait!” Sherlock’s hand shot out; stopping John as he was about to head for the door. “There’s enough room for two, you can stay.”
With a sigh, Sherlock opened his eyes, staring straight at the ceiling, and not looking at his unexpected house guest.
“Well you can rest assured, because I am definitely attracted to and interested in men; one man in particular in fact.” John smirked, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulling him back into another slow, almost worshipful kiss.
“Before we go in, Dr. Watson,” Dr. Cook said, turning to address John, “you should know that Sherlock is still unconscious. He appeared to show some signs of awareness as he was coming out of surgery, but slipped back under shortly thereafter.”
“Good. And anyway if someone really needed help and had any brains, they’d have knocked or made their presence known. Someone else being in here shouldn’t be a deterrent. I come in all the time when there are other people in here.”
Sherlock, growling more so than speaking, surged up to close that last bit of distance. “Oh God, yes!”
He was stabbed, a knife pierced Sherlock’s body, and now he was in some operating theater fighting for his life. John should have been there, he should have protected him, he could have prevented this.
“On you moving in with my darling baby brother. It appears we got that happy announcement after all.”
“Mmmm,” John hummed, “if you can’t tell, then I’m obviously not doing it right.” He mumbled, continuing to pepper Sherlock’s face, neck, and mouth with kisses.
“You’re damn right!” Sherlock barked. “I’m never stepping foot in another rehabilitation center. Not as long as I have any say in the matter!”
I really tried to get this chapter out yesturday, but I got distracted by Doctor Who, and started outlining another fic. By the time I finished editing, it was really late.
“Alright then, I can’t help noticing you’re hurt…” And with that attitude, the injuries were starting to make a little sense.
For possibly the hundredth time since waking up, Sherlock felt like his heart was going to beat out of his chest when he opened the box. “This is…”
“I never said it had to be one time. I just don’t want a relationship.” Sherlock practically purrs, pressing his arousal against John’s.
Head still reeling from his aborted climax, it took Sherlock several seconds to register that Jack was speaking. “What?”
John wasn’t sure how long they stood there staring at each other; the only sound was that of their breathing. “John,” Sherlock said quietly, as if afraid to break the spell that had fallen over them, “is there any chance we can start over, delete this whole fiasco, because I…”
“Doctor Watson,” said a man’s voice, crisp and clear through the phone. “There are three security cameras pointed at your phone box. One on the building to your left, one on the building opposite you, and the last on the building to your right. Do you seem them?”
Suddenly Sherlock smiled like the cat that got the cream, as he he’d found his trump card. “But I have classes tomorrow. Surely you aren’t suggesting I skip classes, are you?”
“Well that got through to you, Love. I’ve been trying to get your attention for the last five minutes.” John laughed, shaking his head. “And I’d no sooner leave you than start drowning puppies.”
“So she seems to approve of me now.” Sherlock said, greeting John with a kiss. “Is that a good thing, or a bad thing?”
, Sherlock thought ruefully. But he felt he owed it to John, he felt John deserved to know. Why he felt that, Sherlock wasn’t sure, he just did.
Once his brain processes what his eyes are seeing, Sherlock Holmes wrapped around him, sound asleep, John immediately starts straggling to de-tangle himself, the movement waking the sleeping man.
“I know you won’t, but I’m right where I need to be. It’s my job, remember?” She said quietly, patting Sherlock’s head as she did when he was younger.
That was it, the school had been contacted, the Wilkes’s, Van Coons, and Lukis’s had been contacted. There was no going back; all that was left to do now was see this thing out to its conclusion. Sherlock knew the evidence was on their side, and – though he’d die before ever admitting it – Mycroft was an excellent negotiator. It should be cut and dry, it should be a straight forward win, Sherlock knew this, but that didn’t stop the wave of panic that washed over him and settle in his gut.
Though he went about his days as normally as he could, treating patients and exchanging pleasantries with co-workers, John was miserable. Try as he might, John could not stop thinking about Sherlock, about what he thought he wanted with him, about how things started to progress between them, only to came to a screeching halt. Sherlock was sure to have
Little warning, there is some brief gendered verbal assault and aborted physical assault in this chapter. It's really not bad and over in a blink of an eye, but I'd hate to catch anyone off guard who might be sensitive to such issues
What happens when everything you've ever wanted is within your reach? What happens when everything you've ever wanted wants you just as much?
John must have been waiting around for Heather to leave, because not ten minutes after she left, the front door opened, and John came back with a duffle bag, two cardboard boxes, and what looked like a metal under-bed locker. He didn’t ask how therapy went, and for that Sherlock was eternally grateful, he just when straight up to his room, dropped off his stuff, and came back down to the kitchen to put the kettle on.
“To my physical therapy. I find you… I find your presence there indispensable.” Sherlock’s eyes were wide, he looked worried, he thought of John, John’s presence, as indispensable. John felt his chest tighten a fraction. That was not helping matters.
“Oh dear God, another one!?” The checkered button down shirt, the chino trousers, it was like they all wore damn uniform. “How many of you people are they going to send to inspect me?”
Sherlock naturally never needed more than a couple hours of rest a night, but that night, sleep was particularly illusive. He laid in bed for hours – the white noise of his roommate’s snores on the other side of the room in the background – replaying every minute of the evening in perfect detail. Without really meaning to, he had stored everything in his growing mind palace. From walking up behind John all the way to John’s parting words, every word, touch, smell and sound; it was all there.
“Your friends who have been pining, head over heels for each other, are finally happy, isn’t that good enough for you?”
“Because you were all loopy when I brought you home, and didn’t trust you not to fall off the couch and make things worse. It’s ok, you can stay here. I’m fine with the couch.”
John buried his face in his hands. “I do not.” He groaned. Being covered in paper cuts and dipped in lemon juice would be better than this conversation.
“Not at the moment no, we had to treat him for some burns along his trunk, so we have him sedated and he’ll probably be out until tomorrow morning. Again, the burns are nothing to be too concerned about.” The doctor reassured Lestrade, and John would have been lying if he said he didn’t feel a spike of worry for the strange private detective. “They’re fairly mild, only just bordering on second degree. Most likely from the initial blast and heat exposure, rather than the actual flame. They could have been far worse had he remained in the building for much longer, but he’s going to be just fine.”
“I’m fine, really.” John said as he stared down at Sherlock, lightly brushing a few stray curls off his forehead. He could take care of himself later. Right now Sherlock needed him, and it would take more than one kindhearted nurse to tear him from Sherlock’s side.
Lunch goes surprisingly well. Mike tells him about teaching at Bart’s, and they joke how they were never as egotistical or as much of know-it-alls as the students these days are. He also tells John that he and his wife are expecting their first child in the spring. When asked if there is anyone special in his life, John just shrugs it off, saying that life in the army wasn't really conducive to maintaining a relationship. After that, they get down to business, Mike giving him the names of several places looking for doctors. John insists he’s not qualified for trauma medicine anymore, so they focus on clinics.
“Sherlock? Sherlock, Sweetie, open the door. Come on, let us in.” came his mummy’s voice, soft and soothing, as if she hadn’t just betrayed him.
“I didn’t want to get in your way, I didn’t want to impose.” He didn’t want John to see the effect his playing had on him.
Everyday Sherlock was in hospital, John came around to visit. Arriving late-morning, he usually stayed until visiting hours ended in the evening. When Sherlock’s physical therapist came, he would leave – he kept insisting Sherlock “needed privacy” – only to come back once the therapist left. Sherlock was usually a little warn out after the therapy sessions, so their afternoons were mostly spent eating the various foods John snuck in from the outside, while jumping from channel to channel, Sherlock nitpicking and pulling apart the shows, while John pretended to be annoyed by said nitpicking.
“Oh good, you’re awake!” said Nurse Leah, sounding far too chipper. “I was hoping you’d wake up before shift change.”
They lay together for a while, legs tangled together, hands running along backs and sides, fingers sliding across cheeks and into hair, trading the occasional word, but mostly enjoying slow, drawn out kisses. It was perfect, absolutely, utterly, unbelievably perfect. John was sure, this was what true happiness had to feel like.
Simply being attracted to Sherlock was one thing, he could easily deal with that, the world was full of attractive people, but to have genuine feelings for him… he was really fucked this time.
“Sure it does,” John smirked, and strode over to drop a kiss to Sherlock’s waiting lips before moving to the kitchen. He had discovered that if he didn’t kiss his mad boyfriend within the first two minutes of either of them entering the flat, Sherlock would get stroppy for a good hour or so. But of all of Sherlock’s little quirks, it was the one John had the least objections to. John never had any objections to kissing Sherlock actually.
John nodded and looked away. He wanted to ask, but his tongue felt thick in his mouth, keeping him from speaking. Sherlock noticed the uncertainty and answered for him.
“You’re getting slow then, too,” Mary shot back. “Watson wasn’t supposed to meet you at Sumatra Road, only you should have been there.”
Police lights flashed in the street, government officials swarming all around. John was placed in a stretcher and wheeled to an ambulance. Mary was alone as Sherlock walked up to her.
The pain only increased as a stretcher was rolled beside him, and then he felt hands on his throat, securing it with some kind of hard plastic. Sherlock tried to move away, he wanted to make sure John was all right. After all, the fall was for him.
“Mycroft informed me about your tumor and then a few weeks later, while I was…stuck,” Sherlock said the word like venom, obviously bothered that he, the great Sherlock Holmes, was baffled. “Mycroft told me about your surgery and the fact that you signed a DNR and I just couldn’t…” Sherlock’s face faltered a fraction and revealed something: he was ashamed of something John couldn’t quite comprehend.
The next thing he knew, Moran steadied his aim and fired. Sherlock fell forward on his front, and remained deathly still.
He lunged forward, grabbed the closest thing he could get his hands on—an abandoned tire iron—and swung. John ducked, but heard the iron hit a skull, and then a curse followed by a groan, then silence.
John, sitting upright, stared at the consulting detective seated on the edge of the hospital bed in front of him. Sherlock’s eyebrows were raised just slightly in questioning, after he had finished explaining every detail and answered every question John had asked about his fake death and in destroying the rest of Moriarty’s web.  John’s eyes were wide and unblinking as he processed what he had just heard. When he had asked a question, he would do so in an even—almost impassive— tone, quite unlike the John Watson Sherlock knew. More minutes passed before the older man finally broke the silence.
Sherlock turned around and stalked down the sidewalk, rummaging through his pocket for a cigarette. His hands came empty, so he crossed the street to a nearby shop, desperate for just one. He refused to think about talking to Victor later, and John too; he knew he would have to, but Sherlock decided to drag it out just a little bit, and get his thoughts in order. He’s waited this long, a little longer wouldn’t hurt.
The person fell quiet, and then squeezed his shoulder gently as she went around his bed and headed out the door. As the door closed, John’s vision slowly started to come into focus. He was lying nearly flat on his back in a bed, and he could see glimpses of wires, tubes, and metal railings around him.
“Say my name John. Yell it, and it’ll prove to you that it’s me, right here. I’m not in another room, I’m right here.”
“John…” Sherlock choked out as he tried to stumble forward, but a strong pair of hands held him back, tightening their grip.
“No, no I’m not doing this with you. You’ll just confuse me—manipulate me. It was just my imagination; I’ve kissed people before. I can kiss you now and it feels just like it does, warm and genuine, like it is with him. Before it was just cold and longing. Christ…” John inhaled sharply. “That’s all this is, just the tumor, bargaining with my sanity. So why don’t you just leave? I’m done with all of this, I am
Sherlock asked himself. Something in his chest tightened at the thought, and he suddenly felt queasy again. He started to open his eyes again, only to keep them closed when a rough hand took his and held it.
“He’s not part of this,” Sherlock claimed. “He was acting…odd. He kept looking around and was antsy. They must have been watching him, which meant he was forced to get rid of me.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I have to go.” He began to stalk off, only to be pulled at a stop, John’s hand gently around his.
Sherlock sighed and nodded. “I’ll come by tonight.” He leaned forward for a second, and then blinked and leaned away, slowly turning on his heel. John slowly caught his breath, and watched him go.
“John,” He whispered to his lover’s ear, who hadn’t acknowledged him yet. “It’s me. I’m here. Open your eyes.”
John’s eyes fluttered opened just as Sherlock walked in. Keeping his eyes as open as he could, he gave the detective a weak smile.
Sherlock pocketed the paper and nodded to John. John’s eyes welled up and blinked rapidly. They kept their eyes locked on to each other as Robbins and Margaret slowly brought the lid over John’s body and sealed it shut.
“They got the tumor out, John. They got the whole thing, the doctor, Dr. Grey, she made sure it was all out.”
He turned towards the door, and noticed a clear plastic curtain pulled all the way, serving as a border between him and the hallway.
“He did last night—. Wait, how did you know already? We haven’t seen you since before it was decided?”
“Don’t breath in too much,” Sherlock said. John sighed to himself and tried to ignore his tingling senses.
“Fine.” Sherlock hurried to their bedroom. He crawled past the window and grabbed the closest clothing items before going into the bedside table drawer on John’s side. He grabbed the gun and then hurried into the bathroom.
Here it is! Thank you all for your encouraging comments, I didn't respond because I've been busy editing it for you lovelies.
Sherlock flinched much to his dismay, and watched as the man who looked like his lover collapsed forward, dead. Moran knelt down and pulled his hair hard. The mask slipped off easily, revealing an unknown man.
“God yes,” John moaned, thrusting his hips into Sherlock. “Let me…” Remaining on top of Sherlock, John stretched over to the bedside table, fumbling for the bottle of lube. After placing it on the bed next to him, John re-straddled Sherlock’s lap, and began thrusting his hips again, feeling the warmth of Sherlock’s groin pressing into him.
Sherlock looked through the files laid out over the table. The computer system was still being rebooted, so he had to go through the hard copies, which was taking a hell of a lot longer. Mycroft had left ten minutes ago to deal with other business, but Anthea stayed behind and helped via her phone.
John stared at him, his face crumbling against the sudden mechanical tone Sherlock produced as he explained the purpose of their relationship. It was cruel but unbelievable.
“He needs to go to the hospital. His head—and he-he could still get hypothermia—.” Sherlock’s voice broke and he buried his face into John’s matted hair. He began to shudder, and wanted nothing more than to cry but his body wouldn’t let him; his chest ached with a longing release as he continued to shake.
Sherlock exited the elevator onto the third floor, and headed down the hall with hesitation in his stride. He only had one cigarette, and didn’t want another in case John would give him an earful. Not that he would have minded; John worrying about him was preferable than vice versa, especially about something as trivial as smoking.
John silently began to cry. He felt a wave of emotion crash into him, and the empty, silent room increased the loneliness. He eventually fell asleep. His dreams were tormented with pain. He saw Sherlock, but failed to reach him, and felt something pin his arms to his abdomen and chest. More arms grabbed at him until he opened his eyes and screamed.
Sherlock nodded solemnly. “I’m not even…completely sure, Victor. About how he feels. It’s just…he’s clearly bothered by this, and I want him to be happy.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw and brought his fist to his chin and lower lip as he looked out the window. “I don’t know.”
rest,” Sherlock decided out loud. Before John could protest, he left the room, and shortly returned with the medication and a glass of water.
John’s lip trembled, and the shaking in his hands worsened, traveling up to his shoulders and through the rest of his body. John shuddered and hunched forward, wanting to curl up on himself. He leaned forward, and Sherlock caught him. He wrapped his arms around John and held him tightly close. John’s breathing became heavy and ragged. He quickly began to sob against Sherlock’s collar; he clutched at Sherlock’s shirt, clenching his fists tightly in order to suppress the trembling. He muffled his cries into the fabric, but the sound only worsened. Sherlock swallowed tightly and blinked his own tears back; this wasn’t fair. None of this should have been happening, especially to John, this wonderful man he’s spending his life with.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock stepped closer until he reached the railing of John’s bed. Swiftly, he leaned down and pressed his forehead against John’s.
John sighed with relief and slightly whimpered. His head continued to ache, and he knew he was about to fall asleep again.
“Giving me a warning, how kind of you.” Sherlock looked over her shoulder for half a second before meeting her eye. “No, Mary, you won’t.”
John clenched his fists and squeezed his eyes shut, willing for the image to vanish from his sight. But all he saw was Sherlock’s broken body, his eyes unfocused and dull, not what his eyes are supposed to be—a tidal wave of emotion that takes a hard eye of the storm to mask over. John inhaled slowly, but his chest didn’t budge, and he swayed on his feet. Sherlock’s voice was a mere murmur, which slowly vanished all together.
John gently took Sherlock’s arm and pulled him to lead him out of the room. “You’re on a case. It’s waiting at the flat—.”
“Truck, cabin, spoon,” Sherlock replied smugly. Willoughby recorded it and then closed the computer and took the folder of answers with him.
In slow motion, Sherlock deduced her. Her stilettos harshly clicked on the floor; she was confident in them, had money from family. She hadn’t taken off her faux-fur coat, so she wasn’t planning on staying long. In fact, Sherlock couldn’t deduce why she was here in the first place, which irked him. A wedding ring glistened against the morning rays on her ring finger: married for three to five years, happily as it clearly has been cleaned on a regular bases so no (obvious) marriage problems. No money problems, no kids, a successful career as a nurse—no, doctor, in her residency at a close by hospital. Maybe John knows her.
“Just a moment after you left. The scans show it is very small, but it is Early on set. I am sorry…”
“Good,” John lied. “I want to leave.” He cleared his throat and caught her gaze. “Please. I’ll sign anything.”
Sherlock glared at Mary and stepped closer, his anger betraying him. “All the evidence points to you.”
John breathed heavily. “You machine! I honestly—I don’t know what I ever saw in you. Sod this. I’m going then. You stay here on your own if you want.”
John slowly slid off and reached the floor with his feet. He leaned heavily against the aids, and turned to the side, and then quickly took a step forward. He altered his body, and leaned forward as he took a dragging step, one after another. He managed five, and was passed the foot of his bed, when his arms began to shake.
John’s grim appearance lightened and he smiled. “Right…good. We can finally move on.” Sherlock hummed against his skin.
John furrowed his brows and altered his stance. “You…went up to the roof to talk to him,” he started slowly. “So…”
The life in Sherlock’s eyes was draining as he choked; tears were falling on his face, streaming from John’s eyes. The man’s eyes connected with Sherlock’s and abruptly his body froze, his grip loosening as he roughly shifted off the body. Sherlock coughed roughly and scooted away.
Willoughby took a step closer, but remained a relative distance from him. “He’ll likely come back in a few hours, maybe a few days, or…”
In silence, John bent forward and helped the detective to his feet. Sherlock stumbled and leaned on John for support, unaware—or at least John hoped he was unaware—of the pink blush deepening on John’s cheeks. They hobbled their way to the bathroom and once there, John set Sherlock down on the toilet lid before turning on the faucet.
Sherlock took the showerhead off the hook, and then turned it on. He held it with one hand and began lathering a washcloth with the hospital-issued soap, as he watered John’s body. He then began washing John’s body gently, and once he was done with his torso, he re-lathered the cloth and handed it to John.
John breathed heavily and looked at the person touching him. The nurse was talking and handed John a couple of pills.
He paused in front of the doors, and unlocked it. He wheeled Sherlock inside, and then began opening the curtains, which turned out to be in the kitchen, with a small dining table in the center.
“The drugs we found—there were bullets, some empty, some not. They must have filled them in with this drug.”
Sherlock stared at John, his eyes hard and his jaw clenched. John stared back at him, his face battling a series of emotions going from shock to affront to distasteful sympathy.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, John,” she said with an encouraging smile. She left, and then Sherlock stepped forward, grinning.
John took a step back, when the prosthetic pinched his skin just right, causing him to flinch and his balance to falter. Sherlock tightened his hold on John’s back and caught him before he fell, but John scoffed and unraveled himself from Sherlock’s embrace.
Sherlock sighed with defeat and raised his eyes up to lock his gaze with John’s. His eyes were glistening and before John fully realized what was going on, tears began leaking out, streaming down the detective’s cheeks and onto the floor.
Moran leaned to his side and whispered to Kim. Kim began typing on her laptop, and then whispered back.
“You should eat something. I’ll call the nurse.” Sherlock said, clearly trying to deviate John off track.
John looked back to the parcel and unwrapped the brown paper to reveal a rectangular scarlet box. He glanced up at Sherlock fondly before he looked back down and pulled the lid open.
“Lestrade? Someone just broke into my flat. No, I’m fine, but the burglar isn’t. He’s an idiot for breaking in here in broad daylight. What’s wrong with him? Oh, he fell down the stairs.”
Sherlock inhaled deeply, taking a quick count of the room. “Where was I? Ah yes, my point.” He smirked and looked at his audience. “I suggest Moran you file for a warrant for Mary’s arrest. She’s the mole—as been this entire time. Framed Anthea, and is involved in framing John.”
Later, John helped Sherlock stabilize his stance as he straightened his back. Sherlock shook against him and was close to losing his balance.
Sherlock groaned as his surroundings began coming back to him. He opened his eyes and blinked away the bleariness. He was in a square room that had been an office. There was a desk and a chair in the corner beside him, a filing cabinet on the other side of the wall, and a coat hanger by the door, which was in front of him. He shifted, only to find his hands were handcuffed behind his back. He looked around and spotted John by the cabinet, still unconscious but starting to fidget, and had his hands tied behind his back as well.
