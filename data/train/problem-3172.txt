I don’t know what expression is on Cas’s face or what his murmured response to Sam is, but the sasquatch’s face morphs into that of a freaking Disney princess faced with a forest full of animals. The saps, both of them.
Jimmy looks everywhere but at me, “Hey, everything ok” I ask as I go to put my hand on his shoulder. Jimmy flinches, and I pull my hand back.
“Dean, leave it with me. I’m going to try and get someone to call out to the house. I promise I will call the minute I know something.”
Somewhere in the back of my mind I realised Jack or Sam could wander in, but I didn’t care. Cas needed this. I needed this. And in the garage of the Men of Letters bunker Castiel, once a Warrior of God took me to heaven on the bonnet of a red shiny Porsche Coupe.
I was so nervous of seeing Sam again and Jack, my Jack. How he had wormed his way into my heart and only he knew the reason why.
I lay there thinking about what happened only a few hours ago. Kissing Cas, his mouth on my cock and I swear to god my cock just twitched thinking about it.
I huff out a breath, “Sorry, thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Adam said you might be able to help me help a friend of mine.”
Dean walks away, head bowed, before turning back, “Cas, you’ve read Michaels file. The mother home-schooled Michael. He was sheltered from birth. It’s only thanks to the mother’s staff that Social Services knew Michael was in danger from her.”
Dean looks down at his beer before raising it to take a swig, “Yeah, me too. But the dude’s probably busy. Bobby told me he was helping Jack out with Heaven. And Angels aren’t allowed to interact with the common people these days.”
He walked in, whiskey bottle in his hand and held it out to me. I reached for it and then moved up on the bed to let Dean sit down.
Jack reaches to squeeze Castiels shoulder, “Your place is right here. By Dean’s side. I will deal with Eve”, and with that, he vanishes.
I looked over to the bed and Siobhan lying on her side was smiling at me with sleepy eyes. “Only together one night and I have you both kicked out of the bed already.”
Sam arched his eyebrows at me, “Do you return his feelings Dean, you know it wouldn’t bother me if you did, as long as you were happy”.
Muttering apologises, Alt Sam follows them to the kitchen, followed by Eileen, who spins around and says, “They are so adorable together”
Tensing up, I am saved from a retort when the other officer speaks up. “That's quite alright Deputy”
Jimmy's pointing at this enormous yacht that has arrived a couple of miles out. Its looks like itss dropping anchor. The boys are fascinated by it and I wave to Jimmy to show I have seen it.
Eileen cups his face and thumbs away the tears flowing down his face, “I know you do, Sam. You show me every day. I love you too, so much. I hope you know that”
In the afternoon, relaxing on the porch swing, Cas’s head in my lap, I sit listening to the boys playing, the chickens clucking and the drone of insects, while carding my hand through Cas’s hair.
“Well, It’s like this. I need someone to run the farm for a while. Maybe for around six months. I don’t want to close it up as this place is a refuge for the kids and I know the State is looking for any reason to shut me down. Sure, why rehabilitate a kid when you can lock them up, right?” Sonny said sounding uncharacteristically bitter.
The three of them look relieved for having something to do, and at first, they work quietly beside me, but soon they start talking amongst themselves, and I’m happy to let their voices wash over me.
“I am Castiel. I’ve been looking for Dean. He jumped through time again, just as I arrived. I couldn’t stop it,” Castiel answers wearily.
Jody reaches for her and pulls her into her arms, “Shush honey, we got to see Dean again, and we know that Sam ends up with his brother. That’s more than we had a few hours ago. And we’ll see them again. We will”
Winking at me, Cas gives me a cheeky smile. Standing with his legs planted he raises his arms chest high and gives the universal signal with his hands to “Bring it on”.
One by one, Sam, Jack and Cas left go of the group hug. Siobhan was still wrapped around me. She had been quiet for a few minutes. Her eyes were still closed. I bent down and whispered that I was taking her to get some rest. She nodded back.
After dressing in boxers and t-shirts, Cas reaches for me first and pulls my head down onto his chest, carding his hand through my hair. I snuggle in, gripping him tight, letting my Angel look after me after our terrible week.
As I stand to face her, I realise that Rowena is not looking at me but Michael, and he’s returning the look.
Cas’s hands are still on my shoulders, “Jack told me about your prayers, he told me you wanted me to come home, but I didn’t hear your prayers Dean, I’m sorry”.
At that, Cas moves around the bed and bends to kiss Jimmy on the forehead, “I’ll see you tomorrow, ok”.
We made our way to the main room, just as Kaia, Claire, Alex, Donna and Jody came through the front door, laden down with pizza and beer.
Pointing up the stairs with the spatula, “Go and hurry. I can’t guarantee your breakfast with seven other boys in the house”
Running back down the hall to Sam’s panting, “Sorry Dean '' and Eileen’s giggles, I meet Cas halfway, coming towards me.
I walked back towards the bedrooms. As I turned onto the corridor, I nearly walked straight into Dean.
I hear voices on Sam’s side of the phone. “Dammit I’m sorry Dean, Cas, somethings come up. I have to go. We’ll talk more over the weekend ok?”
I squeezed Sonny’s hand, “I do Sonny, and I’m glad I can do this for you. Glad we can, Cas and I” I amended
It had been decided the previous week that Cas was going with Michael and I would stay here with the boys.
Sam and Dean gape at Jack in shock before Dean asks, “Jack, not that we don’t appreciate the vote of confidence, but what the hell good is Sam and me to you. What kind of plan do you have in mind?”
Cas replied, “No, I mean vegetables. Would you be interested in planting a vegetable garden, with your permission of course Sonny?”
I quickly gave my order “Two full breakfasts with everything” and then went over to stand by the window to wait.
“Guys” I said, “Look nothing happens that one person doesn’t want to happen ok. If one of us is not ready, then No means No and Stop mean Stop.”
Cas had moved away from me and was now behind Dean, kissing his neck. Dean then turned and took Cas lips with a passion that took my breath away. I really could watch them do that all day.
It wasn’t long after that the boys head to bed and after they are settled, Cas lingers on the stairs to whisper, “I think I’ll go to bed too, join me” and there’s no way I’m saying no to that.
Saying he’ll leave the kitchen to last; we head upstairs where Sonny shows us the boys’ rooms, three rooms with three beds in each. Jimmy the eldest boy had a room to himself while the three younger boys were bunking together. There was also one bathroom on the floor for the boys to use.
Jimmy peeks another look at me and says, “I know I made a stupid joke about it, and I’m really sorry and if you don’t want to tell me its fine, but you and Cas, are you married?”
At our blank looks, Rowena sighs, “Apparently, our rogue demon is a former rogue hunter that doesn’t like you Winchester boys too much.”
I nod and turn back to Cas. We join the other boys in the sitting room as they watch telly, relaxing after another day of activity.
Of all the scenarios I played out in my head, of how this would work out, this didn’t even enter my mind. They loved me, they both loved me and they both wanted to be with me.
“Really, but surely you knew once I figured it out, I would be coming to you and you knew I would figure it out didn’t you. That’s why you didn’t tell us much. You knew about the deal Cas made with the Empty; you knew with my abilities to see the past that I would see through Castiel. The only thing I can’t figure out is how I saw the future.
I call his name, but he doesn’t respond. Even when I’m standing right beside him, he still doesn’t acknowledge me. Kneeling beside him, I stare at his face as he stares out across the yard. I follow his gaze, but I can see nothing that would hold his, but that doesn’t stop the hairs on the back of my neck from prickling.
I was packing a bag for myself, Dean and Cas. Myself and Deans wardrobe were practically the same. Jean’s, t-shirts and boots. Cas’s wardrobe never changed but I had started to buy him some white shirts and underwear. Even angels’ clothes suffer from wear and tear.
The vision was running in his mind in a loop. In the vision he felt emotions, his feelings for Siobhan, so happy being together, their future bright and the years ahead filled with possibilities his happiness being with Sam, Dean and Jack, living in the bunker as a family, dangerous feelings to be having now.
I give the boy a sharp look. The boy’s name is Jimmy, and he's what Sonny called a frequent flyer, meaning this isn’t his first stay here.
“Jack, I think Archangel trumps a priest or a pastor any day” I said “We want the people closest to us to be involved in the ceremony. This is for us. This family. Standing in front of our friends showing them who we are and what we mean to each other and that includes you and Sam.
Sam brings Eileen up to date on what Jimmy told us and tells her he is on the way and not to leave the boys or Rose out of her sight until he gets there.
I reach across the seat for his hand, and he meets me halfway. Forcing a smile on my face, I said, “We’ll start after the boys are in bed. Right now, I just want to spend time with them and Sam and Eileen.”
Donna claps her hands together and says, “You’re the granddaughter”, and Donna launches herself at Arael and practically smothers her in a hug.
ust a quick note to say this is pretty much a smut and fluff chapter with a bit of angst thrown in. I had hoped to post this two weeks ago but it just wouldn’t cooperate with me. Again, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy it.
I turn to reach for him, to say something, anything, when Cas sits up, alert and eyes scanning before growling, “Dean, Sam, directly ahead of me.”
At the mention of Cas’s full name, Michael turns his face to look at him as he continues “You have a choice of rooms. You can have your own room, or you can share. What would you like?”
I turned around and there coming towards me was Roger who owned the auto shop. I bought supplies off him sometimes when my poor “Baby” got banged up.
I could hear running footsteps and then strong hands grasped me upwards and then I was clinging on for dear life to Cas, my God it was Cas, he was here, he was real, and I was crying big ugly snotty tears, but I didn’t care.
I walked over to him as he was finishing up a sigils on the wall above the fireplace. I placed a hand on his shoulder and said his name.
At the boys groan I said “Plenty still left to be done, but tomorrow, no coming out without sunscreen, and a hat wouldn’t go astray either. That goes for you too, Nicholas”
“I don’t mean it like that Cas, but Jack can get me out of there in the blink of an eye also if anything goes wrong.”
And right there in front of me Cas blushed, and it was the most amazing and endearing sight I had ever seen, Cas blushing, “Am I being presumptuous, unless my confession to you about my feelings has changed our friendship, but when Jack told me you……………”
After he moves the couch back to where it was initially, Michael smiles hesitantly at Cas and me, “You ok, Michael, you are doing great.”
And then I see the reason why this man is Sherriff. He turns steely eyes onto his son and tells him to go back to the office, saying he’ll speak to him later. The Deputy blanches at the look on his father’s face before throwing us a hateful stare. Turning on his heel he marches down the corridor before disappearing into the elevator.
Rolling my head back towards the ceiling my brain is beating a mantra, “Don’t ask, don’t ask, don’t ask”
Cas squinted at me, “Like what, sex? Because I think that's fairly obvious. Considering the size of Sam’s appendage when aroused ……………………….”
Jack looked up at us and said the words that froze my heart “It has come for her. The Entity has Siobhan”.
The ice cream treats go down, well, like a treat judging from the happy grins coming my way. Joseph has an impressive ice cream moustache which I rub off with a napkin all the while grinning goofily at me.
Rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands he slumped a bit before answering, “Yeah, that was the first symptom. I’d be tipping along nicely and all of sudden I’d feel like I needed a nap”.
“Jack was very upset by you leaving Siobhan” Cas said “But I noticed a change in him after he got your letter. Whatever you said, helped.”
Sam looks horrified. Holding his arms up he says, “Ok truce. If we keep it in the bedroom, you will too. Deal”
There’s only Michael left, and I feel Sam stiffen beside me. He’s been on the receiving end of enough calls from me regarding Michael to know to thread carefully.
Jimmy eyes the two of us, looking like he doesn’t know what to believe. I have seen that look on dozens of victims of the supernatural. I hated seeing it on Jimmy’s face.
Sonny blows out another breath, “Well on a scale of 1-10 it’s about a 6, which isn’t too bad, but the treatment they want me to try will floor me, so if I want to get better, I have to give it 110%. My sister lives in the city and she said I can stay with her while I’m going through it, but Dean I can’t give up on the kids, I can’t let them down. I was hoping you would know someone that would be able to help out, keep the doors open, just until I’m on my feet again”.
“Don’t forget Book Club in two weeks. We’ll have it on Thursday night again. If it doesn’t suit you, just let me know, ok.”
I take a seat on the opposite side of the bed. As we eat, I tell Dean about my conversation with Helen, Jackie, Sarah, and my telephone call with Sam.
Cas is already in his bed reading. He looks up at me as I come in and without preamble asks, “So what’s the surprise?”
She looks even more beautiful than he remembered, his memory not doing her an iota of justice. She’s smiling up into the face of a young man, eyes shining and her smile bright as the man bends down to kiss her. His heart constricts watching them.
Cas turned to me and said “I know this is a strange time but I’m so happy Dean, I can finally say it, I can finally allow myself to feel it. You telling me you were in love with me, was the best moment in my entire existence.”
Michael nods again, his big blue looking solemn and wise beyond his years. Thinking of what I had danced around not saying to Jimmy by talking about family, I swore I would do better. Holding his face, I tell him, “I love you, Michael. Cas and I love you very much. We want you to know that, ok.”
Nicholas’s mother takes my hand, and then Cas’s, “Please call me Amy. Helen has told me how well you have taken care of my Nicholas when I…..didn’t”, her voice breaking on the last word.
But my friend you have to start opening up a bit more, to leave some of the horror show out. Otherwise, you will always be battling that demon temper of yours.”
The have already dug out the bed for planting. Now they are tunnelling troughs parallel to each other and Jimmy seems to be taking his job of making sure they aren’t too close together very seriously.
Michael needs someplace calm and peaceful to heal himself, body, mind and spirit. Not a high-strung functioning alcoholic with a borderline personality and a bottomless pit of rage.
I understood where Siobhan was coming from. The texts in the books was very difficult to understand. Some of it was crystal clear but others weren’t. I realised that the text must have been translated into English from Enochian, and it was done badly.
Castiel reaches down and starts stroking Dean’s cock, soft languid movements that have Dean catching his breath as he leans his forehead against Castiel’s.
Cas knows, but the boys don't, that these days out are being supplemented by a credit card that Sam set up for us, when we left the bunker. The Department of Social Services can just about manage a small salary for us as well as keep the boys fed and housed but that was it. As Cas and I don’t need much, we’re happy to use the credit card on the boys.
Jack made his way back to his room clutching the letter. He knows what Dean and Cas had told him about why Siobhan had left but he still didn’t understand properly.
Turning to me she winked and said, “I thought I was going to have to pry Cas from her cold dead hands”.
Castiel stops him by placing his fingers on Dean’s lips, “Dean, I’m an Angel. I don’t need prep. You can’t hurt me.”
Cas gave me a look that was too innocent to be real, “I don’t think I should have to pay for snuggles”
Why did I always keep hurting him? After everything he has done for me and for Sam, I always kept on hurting him.
Cas answered smiling down at me saying “Siobhan except for a minor beard rash on your chin, there isn’t a mark on you”
Our silent conversation is interrupted by Keith, Nicholas and Joseph shuffling into the room. Joseph and Nicholas sit on either side of me on the ground while Keith climbs onto the bed and rubs Michaels back once before hovering nervously.
Jimmy’s eyes go wide before he moves towards the office, “Take your time”, I tell him before closing the door.
Turning back to the witch, he begs, “Please, is there anything I can do. I need to get back to where I belong. That’s all I want.”
“It’s ok, Jimmy. If you don’t want him to know, that’s fine, but just so you know, if anyone can understand what you went through, it’s Dean”.
I’m bothered by the fact that he would move on so quickly. Like how in love with me was he really. And he’s moving on with an exact replica of me. So, like any Dean will do. Yeah, that makes sense. That’s why it bothers me.
Sam has to agree. He takes in the landscaped garden, the hand paved driveway and the Victorian-style building as they approach the house. Knocking on the front door, they wait for over a minute before they hear the click-clack of high heels on marble.
“Michael”, Cas growls before he launches himself out of bed and out the door, me stumbling in his wake.
He knew that Dean had feelings for Siobhan even if he wouldn’t admit them but Castiel felt no anger or jealousy at the thought because when he helped Dean and held him while he got himself back together he saw something in Dean’s face that he thought was impossible, that he thought he was alone in.
Cas comes back with the washcloth and hands it to me. I hold my hand out with the cloth, “Shush Jimmy, it’s ok, let me clean you up.”
The silence after I finish talking has me scared to open my eyes, but I do. Cas is staring at me with tears running down his face, looking like he can’t believe what he heard.
Dean leans back to look at her, puzzled, “Jody and I visit Sam and Eileen a couple of times a year. Sometimes they send us some info on a monster. Sam always talks about you.”
Rose smiles at me, “Dean you’re doing great, both you and Cas. Relax. There will be enough times when this job will tie you up in knots. Don’t stress out the small stuff ok”.
Cas shrugged, “No, its fine, Dean, I’m sorry for my reaction. I just thought we would have more time together. But its ok. We still have a few weeks before you go, don’t we, and six months isn’t that long. I can help Sam and Eileen out here, and we’ll see each other when you get back”.
Filling up two bowls of popcorn (because Sam & Eileen would share one, the saps) I made my way out to the TV room.
He then looked over at me, with a grin. The last few hours had been amazing. Every time we were together it just got better and better.
“Mmm, so that’s your game”, Eileen laughs, and my heart lightens for a brief second on this horrible day.
“Yes, it is. For the battle, you will follow Naomi’s orders. After the battle you will follow Jack” Siobhan replied
“I know. My angel strength isn’t, but destroying the Empty changed me to allow myself to be a Conduit.
Cas made to move, and I reluctantly loosened my arms, but Cas turned to face me and buried his face in my chest instead.
I snorted thinking about that before sobering, “We had a rough couple of years with him when I wasn’t sure what way he would turn out, but Cas he never faltered, no matter how rough it got with Jack, Cas never stopped believing in him. And he was right in the end. Jack turned out amazing”
I'm underwater. The water is pressing me down, drowning me. I can see Sam way up above the water screaming for me. I have to get to him, I have to.
Everyone looked startled at that, including myself. I knew what I had to do; I just hadn’t thought much about what happened after.
The boys run ahead squealing and laughing when they see it. Pulling off boots, socks and t-shirts, leaving them where they fall, they continue their journey running full tilt into the lake splashing each other with abandon.
When I wake, the sun is on the other side of the house, and the room seems dimmer. I feel rested, but I know I didn’t wake naturally.
Halfway through dinner, Joseph pipes up with his mischievous grin and asks, “What are we doing tomorrow Dean?”
Dean laughs softly, “Yeah, go tell your wife what’s going on. If you survive that, I’ll meet you back here,”
A warmth covers the hand I was leaning on. I look down and see Cas’s hand covering mine. He squeezes lightly before moving his hand away, but yet our pinkie fingers stay entwined as we finish tidying the garden.
That turns out to be the right thing to say. The boys nod again but they look more relaxed and settle back into their beds.
I look down at the card. It says Sarah Summers RN with the name of the Hurleyville General Hospital she works at, and her phone number.
I hadn’t said anything, but I was so looking forward to seeing Claire. Even though I wasn’t her real father, I had felt a responsibility to her that had grown into real affection. I knew she just tolerated me but that was ok, just knowing she was alive and happy was enough for me.
There's a field behind the house that encroaches onto a wooded area.  I can see boys in the distance, hanging clothes on a clothesline, and another chopping wood. Cas comes to stand beside me and follows my gaze. He turns to me with a small smile on his face. His reaction takes a weight off my chest that I didn’t realise is weighing on me. This isn’t just a brand-new experience for me, it's brand new for Cas. And I'm so pleased to have him by my side.
Castiel looked at me but Jack said “Not that Siobhan, the answer to the last question you asked Naomi, they need to know.”
Cas looked beat. I wrapped my arm round his shoulder as I asked him, “Are you going back into Michael?”
I know why Dean is asking because I feel it too. His absence. It’s like a physical thing. Like a part of me is missing.
Cas and I look to Rose as Rose turns towards the door. Her face softens hearing that voice, and she quickly makes her way out the kitchen door. Cas and I follow her out but stay back as the wives greet each other.
“Hmmm, we could do that orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, we could go tomorrow and today we can go to the town fair, where there will be rides and games and ice cream and…………………………”
“So, let me get this straight” I said gasping for breath “Dean your what, 41? I’m 35 and Cas you’re a zillion or something and all three of us are freaking virgins.”
“I think we should sleep in my room. But we will need a new bed. I’ll buy one tomorrow. A king size bed. And you both keep your rooms for hanging out in. Cas doesn’t sleep and you can keep your bachelor pad for watching telly.”
I waited him out. When the car was pretty much mulch, he stopped. I knew he knew I was there, but I said nothing. Eventually he turned and looked at me. The despair on his face nearly killed me.
I growled into his shoulder, “You need anything, you pick up the phone you hear, other than that your only job is to get better, no worrying about this place, Cas and I, we’ve got this”.
“Siobhan, remember when I said I was literally fried but I still wanted you? he said with an arched eyebrow
“Sonny is there a gardening store in town where I can get seeds and utensils for our gardening project?”  Cas asked.
When I did take it out to examine it, it wasn’t just his declaration of love that astounded me, it was also everything else he said.
Cas looked so shy, but he looked me right in the eye and asked “Next time, I want you inside me, I would really like that”
Sonny raises his hands in front of him, “Absolutely D-Dawg. Whatever to keep you and the boys safe”.
There’s no need to have the big conversation when my feelings are so fricking new and unsure of. That decision seems to settle my nerves.
Once Helen leaves, I make the introductions between the Sheriff and Trace O’Brien.  Once the pleasantries are done, Trace says, “Shall we get down to it”
I can see Travis taking in the picture in front of him, Cas and I standing close together, his hand on my cheek and I’m glad when he seems to catch on.
Cas grimaces at the memory, “Yes, it was not pleasant, but in Jesse’s defence, I was trying to kill him. It says a lot about him that he didn’t kill me outright; he just incapacitated me. That shows me these children are not inherently evil.”
Walking with our arms still around each other, I know what he means. I have the same thoughts when I look at Cas, he looks like he's actually glowing.
Deciding to take a chance, he pushes off from the tree he’s leaning on and walks away from Jess and his younger self, fighting the urge to look at Jess one more time.
I bent my head to look at her, “What, it was more about the fact that he thought I was in a relationship with Cas”
Sam and Eileen have done such a good job with the boys that they are in good spirits when we re-join them again. We stop at a few stalls on the way back to our cars for the boys to play another few game and the whole way back Cas’s hand is tucked into mine. We break apart briefly when we get into the car but it’s in mine again once I have the car started.
“When I arrived at the school there was ambulances and police cars and flashing lights and I knew…….i just knew.
Eileen gasps and clasps her hands to her face, clearly delighted, while Sam laughs and claps his hands.
That wasn’t strictly true. We had asked Jack to look for any kinds of deception or duplicity. Our backs were against the wall. We couldn’t allow for mistakes.
After the boys are in bed, Cas and I move out onto the porch, beer in hand. Taking out my phone, I bring up Sam’s number.
“Figures” I said “Jack, I need you to go to Hell, find the boys and tell them they have to start the spell straight away”
I smile at that, “Thanks. And thank you for having Dean’s back. We appreciate it. Does the place you are staying at have a microwave”
Rowena started talking “Siobhan, whatever you say to me will be between us, I promise you. And nothing you can say will even come close to the loathsome things I have done in my time”
As we enter the restaurant, I spot Robin herself behind the counter. She smiles when she sees us and comes around to greet us.
I leaned in and kissed her, and the kiss caught fire and I was lowering her onto the bed when there was a banging at the door
Standing with my hands on my hips, I said, “What?? I have what one, two, three, FOUR nights tucking in to make for”, and the boys giggle at my antics.
I have barely seen Miracle in the last couple of days. Between the boys and the wide-open spaces to run around in, she only shows up when she's hungry and to sleep on my bed.  Not that I blame the dog, an underground bunker is no substitute for wide open fields where she can chase bees, birds and the occasional hare.
The Deputy’s face is now puce colour red. “That boy is a suspect in the murder of his father. I didn’t have to let them see him”.
We walk back chatting about Sonny and the vegetable garden. I hadn’t realised how far down the beach we had walked. I'm trying to spot where we had parked our stuff, when I hear Cas call, “Dean, Dean”
As I pass through the house, I wave to Robin, Jimmy and Joseph on my way to the kitchen. The kitchen is empty, but I can hear Rose’s laughter nearby. Looking out the window, I can see Cas is continuing the self-defence class with Keith and Nicholas.
I couldn’t say what I wanted to say. It wasn’t the time. But the urge to tell him that I hated not being with him, missed him sleeping in the next bed beside me, or us watching T.V together with the boys. Jeepers I had it bad. The avalanche of feelings I had for Cas left me breathless.
I smile behind my coffee mug as I realise Cas is getting me back for keeping my own surprise from him yesterday. Well two can play at that game.
Rose listens to me in silence. When I stop talking, she pins with a look, “But you’re sure, your 100% sure of Cas, because Dean if you’re not…………….”
“Burgers” Sam replies, “You’re getting burgers with chips and would it kill you to try the salad with it”.
He was standing there with tears running down his cheeks and instinctively, I knew what he had been thinking.
I huff out a laugh and Cas releases me, before grabbing my hand, saying, “C’mon before we lose the boys”.
Sam calls to all known hunters who worked in that area, but no one had come back, knowing anything about a demon presence in Youngsville.
Young Dean’s stance changed then, and he produced a weapon so quickly that Dean did a double-take, “Woah, I can explain, ok?”
Cas manages a smile, “Thanks, Shelley, that's nice to know, and I will soon. Please let me introduce you to my family,” and he proceeds to introduce each of the boys before turning to Sam and Eileen, who shake hands with her, “And this is my Dean” Cas said as he reaches for my hand.
Blushing, I beg them,  “Please don’t tell Cas I swore in front of you. He might smite me” and the boys giggle again and promise they won’t.
I wanted to help, but I was useless, I wanted to pray, but there was no one to pray to and the one person I wanted to talk to about all this was also going through his own hell.
Jackie’s eyes hold mine as she takes my hand, “He’s been beaten. His face is a mess. His left arm is fractured. He was stabbed in the abdomen” At my flinch, she squeezes my hand, “It’s deep but not life-threatening, but that’s probably where all the blood came from. He’s covered in bruises from head to toe”
Dean looks comically between the witch (because there is no doubt she’s something) and Sam as he asks, “You have this effect on all the women?”
I swear I nearly have a heart attack when Cas who’s lying on his back, completely debauched looking, spreads his legs wide.
When Jack rescued him from the Empty, he had given Cas permission to visit Sam and Dean. They were at a Pie Fair the day he arrived. The two of them looked happy, laughing and joking. They mentioned him in passing, but there was no talk about getting him from the Empty, not that he wanted them to risk that, but it still hurt. He found he didn’t want to disturb them. They had finally found peace.
And there they are. The words that Cas has said to me on more than one occasion including that last horrible day when we had left to challenge Death.
With a big smile on my face, I join the boys in cleaning the coop, asking them questions about what the chickens like, and I even got a few tentative smiles back from them, which I will take as a win.
She reaches out her hand to take Cas’s hand and there's no mistaking what the smile on her face means.
Barking a laugh, I say “Is that all. There’s nothing else I can tempt you with, “waggling my eyebrows at him.
Sam smiled at me “Ok that’s all I can do for the moment. Someone should be with her at all times. In case she wakes up or……..”
Sam, who had been watching my face the whole time I was talking, looks down at that last remark with a slight smile on my face.
He told her about his monumental mistakes like trying to become God, releasing the Leviathans, betraying Sam and Dean, and so much more so that she could learn from them. He told her about rescuing Dean from Hell. Their profound bond.
Jackie is smiling at Rose before turning that smile on us, her bright brown eyes shining, “Hello, Dean. It’s so nice to meet you, finally. I feel like I already know you. Hello Cas, it’s nice to see you again.”
I groan as our cocks rub up against each other, before sighing against his lips, “Cas, I didn’t mean to start anything. We have to get up in a minute”.
I continued on “The Entity said he wouldn’t take me straight away, that he would wait for me to be happy. I thought with everything that was on the horizon, I didn’t think that was something I would have to worry about for a while but then……..
Sounds and images flash behind his eyes, but it’s over in seconds. As he raises his head, he sees Sam in a similar position, holding his head in his hands.
It took some more time persuading the boys of my plan, but Jack had been on my side, was willing to go with me and seemed happy for the responsibility.
Tidying up after the game, I’m still feeling very vulnerable after our conversation this afternoon. Taking in a shaky breath, I feel Cas’s hand on my shoulder. Looking up at him, I see understanding in his face. “We’re ok Dean, we really are”.
Dean and Cas still leaning over me started kissing my face all over while I giggled. Then they sat on either side of me and pulled me upwards and hugged me senseless.
I tilt my head at him and give him the look, the don’t bullshit me look, “I said something upstairs to upset you, and that is the last thing I intended, so tell me, what did I say?”
But I still tease him mercifully about his growing fan club. When he complains, I pinch his cheek and tell him, “That is just one of the perks of a best friend”
Pulling his face towards me, I kiss him gently on the lips before whispering, “Oh, is that all?” I say before kissing him again.
Sucking the head into his mouth, he tastes Cas, and it is that same sweet taste he got from his skin. Holding the base, he takes as much of Cas’s cock into his mouth as he can before sucking back to the top and swirling his tongue around the ridge.
Cas is like a kid in a sweet shop. He has this big goofy smile on his face, and he peppers Sonny with questions about the different types of chickens, what they eat, how soon the eggs are laid. Sonny's in his element answering him. He's clearly delighted with Cas’s interest.
Sam finally loosens his hold and leans back so she can see his lips. He says, “I love you. I love you so much.”
I nod my head to acknowledge him, but it's taking all my concentration to breathe past the lump in my throat. Cas’s arm comes off the seat behind me, squeezing my shoulder. His touch as always centres and grounds me, and I drive on until we reach the beach and I park in the car park across the road.
For pity’s sake get a grip, he chided himself. He opened the text and all the message said was “Castiel we need to talk. I’m in my room”.
I hated the look on Cas’s face. He didn’t deserve it. Catching him by the shoulders, I said, “Cas, it’s ok. This is not on you. This is a stressful time for Jimmy. Let me catch up with him. Can you stay with the boys?”
I watched as Dean followed Cas carrying Siobhan down the corridor, then when they were gone from view, I found the nearest chair and sat heavily into it.
“Cas” Sam said “I think you need to talk to Jack. He’s really hurting over Siobhan leaving. He really loves her.”
At Castiel’s raised eyebrows, she continues, “It’s just so good to see you, especially after Dean told us you were in Heaven and you’re together. When he was alive, he tried to hide it, but he was hurting something fierce. when you were gone, but I told him, you are a fighter and if anyone could survive that…….well that place, it would be you, and now here you are”
“No” I protested “I want to do more of this” standing on my tippy toes (Man they were both so tall) and pressing my lips to Dean’s.
It takes everything in me not to jump into the Impala and catch up with Helen’s car and beg Jimmy not to go.
What greeted them was Siobhan ablaze in a lightning storm right there in her apartment. Her hands were stretched out wide and over her head and she was hovering slightly off the ground. Lights, and all electrical appliances were exploding all around them and the apartment itself was caught in a whirlwind. It was an assault on the senses that Dean and Sam had to shield their eyes. Only Castiel and Jack could watch on in disbelief.
Jimmy nods his head. He sways towards me before turning away again and some instinct I didn’t know I had, reaches for him and pulls him into a bear hug. Jimmy’s hands come up immediately around my waist, confirming I'd made the right call.
“He’ll probably go straight to his room, when he gets here so introductions might have to wait. I’m going to leave it up to him if he wants his own room, or to share. And, he probably won’t be running around and playing for a while, so maybe you guys might be patient with him ok?”
And before I can say a word, Cas climbs off the bed and walks into the bathroom. A beat later, I hear the shower, “Fuck”
Throwing his arm around Cas’s shoulder, he leans in to speak into his ear, “Finding out you are single”
“Yeah. But she only found out recently that he was killed deliberately so nothing would get in the way of her role in the end game. So please Jody give her the benefit of the doubt. She’s actually really looking forward to meeting you guys” I said
I swallowed hard. This was Chuck. This was……………God. The God. My vision started going dark around the edges. Stop. No fainting Siobhan. Absolutely no fainting.
Sam barks out a laugh and claps his hand on Cas’s shoulder, “Sorry Cas but you knew what you were getting yourself into with Dean. No backsies. You're stuck with him now.”
“You know you can’t stop me, right? You know this will end the way I want it to end” Chuck continued
I lean back to look at him and Cas has a look of such relief on his face, “I thought you might change your mind about us, that you would find this too hard to handle, you looked so shocked, Dean”
Cas joins by my side and slips his hand into mine. It feels like the most natural thing in the world and yet so new. Sam sees it and shakes his head before fixing us with a shrewd stare. “How long?”
Sam gave me a “of course” kind of look, but if finally getting together with Cas taught me anything it was, don’t take it for granted that people know how you feel, sometimes you have to say it, “Sam seriously, thank you. I really appreciate it” pulling in for a hug.
Cas barely acknowledges that as he barrels into Michael’s room. I stumble outside the other boy’s room before peeking in.
I bark a laugh and pull him into my arms, before hearing a tentative knock on the kitchen door. Sam opens the door and the five boys peer in curiously with Jimmy asking, “Everything ok?”
I smile at Cas’s expression, “Cas, you know something has occurred to me. You know the way Michael always pauses before he answers a question?” At Cas's wary nod, I continue, “I always thought that he was just rolling the question around in his head, making sure he understood it before answering, but what if he was considering all the possibilities of how to answer. I think Michael isn’t just powerful; he’s smart as well. Super bloody smart. Thank god he’s on our side.”
Cas laughs but manages to twist himself free and impressively pin me up against a tree, his hands on either side of my chest.
He places a hand on each of their shoulders but when he came to Jimmy, he pulls him in for a hug. He whispered into his ear “I can’t wait to see your garden. It should be in full bloom by the time I get back”.
I smiled to myself remembering that night at the bunker when Cas had come home, and the next morning when I told Cas I was leaving.
The next morning after a sleepless night, (and I would deny it if anyone asked, I got up several times just to make sure Cas was really here) I shuffle my way to the kitchen in search of coffee.
“Missed you too, Sam” Cas mumbles looking like he had taken up residence in my brothers’ arms and has no intention of leaving. Eileen has her two hands to her mouth smiling at the sight, which I have to admit is freaking adorable.
With effort he cleared his mind and turned to Sam, Dean and Jack who were discussing what to do next.
I put my hand on Jack and Dean’s shoulders and said to Jack “Dean will be with you the whole way. We will stay here and keep working”
And then Siobhan walked into that café and Cas was lost. He hadn’t understood why Cas wasn’t pursuing her until he heard of the deal with the Empty, then everything fell into place.
It was still dark in the room and only a sliver of moonlight was making its way through the curtains, when my eyes drifted open. I could feel Cas tucked into my back doing an absolute fabulous impression of the big spoon. Cas’s left arm was wrapped around my left shoulder and across my chest acting as a pillow under my head. His right arm was around my waist. His chest was warm on my back and he had was felt like a very impressive hard on right against my ass. He wasn’t the only one.
Sam was on his laptop looking into what could be a case. He was just waiting for Dean to come back to discuss it with him.
Sonny raised his hands in front of him, “Absolutely D-Dawg. Whatever to keep you and the boys safe”.
Our eyes locked as I watched as Cas’s tongue licked at the top of my cock, before enveloping the head completely. My head fell back as I groaned into the pillow.
We still wait in the kitchen in case of problems, but our talk is about Sam and Eileen. They had just texted that they were an hour away.
Rose smiles at that, “I’ll set it up. Dinner will be ready in an hour. Leave the monitor here with me and spend time with the boys. I’ll call you when dinners ready ok”.
So, it's with a big smile on my face that I head into the kitchen to put the ice cream into the fridge. Cas and Michael can have it after their dinner.
Looking up at me with spit slick lips, flushed cheeks, and blown pupils, he asks, “Do you want me to stop?”
“Well I got a car that was delivered here last Tuesday, and I was told to make sure you got it. Apparently, you loaned it to a friend” he said scratching his head
We're halfway there, the boys in the back talking quietly between themselves when Jimmy asks me “Dean you do realise what you did back there, don’t you?”
Suddenly the bunker door slammed open, I jumped up from my seat and saw Dean tearing down the stairs, two at a time.
When Siobhan stopped screaming, I thought for a split second that we had lost her, but her body and mind had mercifully shut down.
Dean leaned over to me and kissed me soundly “When we get through this, you, me and Siobhan are going somewhere private for a month, at least, where we won’t be disturbed and where clothing is optional. Agreed”
Before venturing even further, he leans back to look at Cas. He looks utterly debauched, pupils blown, slick pink lips, and ferocious bed head. Dean grazes his fingers beneath the waist of Cas’s white slacks, all the while keeping eye contact, silently asking permission.
Cas picked up his coat and smelled it. I looked at him puzzled and said to me “Its smells like you. I’m never washing it again” he grinned at me.
“Naomi, its coming close to the end. We do not want to find ourselves divided. So, we all stay, or we all go. What’s it going to be?” I said
He smiles a bit, meeting my gaze in the rear-view mirror, and I give him a nod that means, go ahead, ask me.
And last is Joseph, also 10 years old, blond, blue eyes, slightly chubby and a talker once he gets going but had the most mischievous smile, you can’t help grinning back at him.
“Thank God” I growled closing my laptop down, “I honestly thought you were going to get us to start painting every inch of the bunker next, cause like, it couldn’t be more ready”.
She reached over and squeezed my hand as the sounds of the boys getting up to start their day reached my ears.
Bellies full and slightly tipsy, the five of us move onto the porch; Sam insists Rose and Jackie take the porch swing, joking that if he and I didn’t do a good job putting it together, we would soon know. How Rose didn’t slay him with the look she gave him, I don’t know, but it bounced off Sam in his intoxicated state as he fell onto the cast iron bench laughing, and soon Rose joined him.
I sighed and said “Cas, we didn’t get a chance to tell you this but, well, I’m not staying here. I’m actually leaving in a few weeks”.
Cas and I sit facing each other in the office, knees touching, hands clasped, eyes on each other. The seconds pass like I’m back in Hell. The time dragging out like string cheese.
Crossing the room to them, I kneel beside them, “Nick I’m sorry. I know how much you want to go home. Your mother just needs to get better. Ms Mason told me she is working really hard now. Hopefully it won’t be for long more”.
She kisses me on the cheek, before whispering into my ear, “I knew it. No one could stand a chance against such pure love that Cas has for you”
“Dean, you can tell me anything. Unless you’re about to tell me you’re both eunuchs, then I’m going to have to kill you” I laughed.
Dean watches as Cas blushes at Jacks words. It’s absolutely adorable, and he can’t help grinning at him, despite Jack’s bombshell. But Castiel steps forward towards Jack, “I should go with you, Jack. My place is with you.”
Sam doesn’t know what to do. If he reveals himself to his younger self and Jess, he could derail his and Dean’s whole future. All the people they saved could be in jeopardy. But he needs help getting back. He needs a hunter.
Jack smiled at me and said “I feel everything. I feel every leaf, every blade of grass, every heart beat of every living thing in this world and beyond. There is much to be done”
And Siobhan, I’ll give you some free advice, I wouldn’t trust Naomi. You do know she tortured Castiel and made him kill Dean over and over again.”
Cas stands slightly unsteady on his feet. He turns to Sam and pulls him around the waist for a hug “Night Sam, I’m so glad I’m home”.
It might also have to do with the fact that a line of admirers both female and male were lining up after Cas.
I take a deep breath to try and steady the emotion rising in me. I give myself a pep talk telling myself to not screw this up. I needed to be very fucking clear, “I have grown to love you like family, Jimmy, Cas too. We don’t want you to leave, but we understand why you do. But you’re not losing us; your family is just growing. We’ll see each other again, I promise.”
I give him the look that’s faced down Demons, Angels and even Gods before asking, “Do you want to die, Jimmy?”
I turned to Naomi and asked her outright “Why didn’t you tell us about your plan to use me to kill the Entity. Was it because you knew the Angels would fall back to Heaven, all of them, demons too? Are you on our side Naomi?
Over the years I learned to live with it and Dean, and I remained best friends, having our ups and downs like any friendship until what happened with Mary and Jack nearly derailed us. But even that, we came through ……….
Closing the kitchen door, Cas walks up to me and places his hands on my face. Wearing my smile, he says, “Dean, I rescued you from Hell and I fell in love with your soul right there and then, I didn't recognize the emotion for what it was until later, I just knew I rejoiced in your presence. Since then it has not been smooth sailing for us but even when we were fighting, I still felt safe and content in your presence. The same is true for now. I will face every bigot on this planet happily as long as you are there beside me. Nothing will change my mind”
Michael seems to be thinking of something else, and Cas and I give him a moment. Finally, he asks, “Can I tell Jimmy?”
The showdown with Chuck, Jack taking his powers, Jack leaving us until five months later he brought Cas back to us as human, and we came to Sonny’s.
Sam gives him a double-take bitch face before addressing the witch, “You’re Anita Whittaker, right?  I’m Sam Winchester, and I need your help.”
The words burst forth from me in a rage, “I want to kick the shit out of someone Cas. I haven’t even met this kid yet and I want to find every one of those fuckers that hurt him and eviscerate them. I want to throw them into a nest of vampires and watch them tear those fuckers apart. I want…………gggrrrrrrrr. I want to hurt them so bad”.
I snort out a laugh, “Cas, you idjit, what are you sorry for? I’m just sorry I didn’t know that before I moved” and then I blush to the roots of my hair when I realise what I'd said.
The next couple of days I barely saw Cas, which in a way was a good thing, for me. My head was still reeling from my epiphany.
We stand up after a while and go back upstairs. Jimmy has said he wants to go back to his own room, instead of taking the spare room.
That did it. Dean grabs his hair and pulls at it, growling softly, but he keeps it down. I know how he feels, and right now, I feel fucking helpless.
The look on Cas’s face is pure hurt and I hate to see it. Helen sighs and answers him, “No Cas, he hasn’t made a complaint. He’s asked to be placed in a different home. I’m sorry”
“Let me think about it. The message isn’t just for Eileen, it’s for Sam too and I want to phrase it just right” I said grinning at him.
“Oh boy, c’mon” and with his arms still wrapped around me, I dragged Cas down to his bedroom with Sam and Eileen’s chuckles ringing in my ears which were now a rosy pink, I’m sure.
Cas and I sneaked along the corridor to the shower room. A shower was definitely in order before we went back into the others.
She stood up and said, “Ok I have to go. Call me if you need me” and she left with smiles and a wave.
I squeezed him tighter, while staring into his eyes, “Cas, you need to believe me when I say, that was one of the best sexual experiences of my life”
I cough a laugh at him, “Damn Cas, you know me well”. I wrap my arms around his shoulders, burying my face in the crook of his neck, “That’s my first instinct Cas, I just want to take him somewhere safe or keep him here. But he wants to go home. I have to keep remembering that”
Dean’s eyes bounce between Sam and the road, “Hey man, I get it. I’d do the same. I just hope it helps.”
Taking a deep breath,  I tell him about us having to share a room when we got here, Cas’s steady long line of admirers, us becoming freer with each other in terms of affection, the talk with Jimmy on the beach, but it wasn’t until Michael arrived on the scene that things changed for us.
I busy myself with setting the table when Rose runs into the kitchen, “Dean, Jackie’s on the phone. It’s about Jimmy”
I pulled back and Cas went straight for my neck, kissing wide open wet kisses up and down my neck. That and his hands on the bare skin on my back nearly had me coming in my pants.
“It’s like there is some barrier shielding her. She can’t be harmed but she also can’t be healed” Cas said
I watched in disbelief as I saw Siobhan falling to the ground in a dead heap. Chuck fell to his knees, as did Jack. The bombardment of angels and demons stopped as suddenly at it started. Rowena appeared beside Sam, just as Naomi stirred on the ground in front of us.
Sonny huffs a laugh, “Some days I feel like I’m winning, other days not so much. But you know me, I’ll keep swinging. Is everything ok?”
I reach for him then, needing his arms around me, needing to touch him, to drink him in. Cas allows me to pull him into the embrace, tightening his arms around my waist.
I let out my breath shakily “When Chuck told me about what Naomi had done, he also gave me a choice. He told me he could make it that Brodie never died, that I never came here, never met the boys. Jack saved me before I could answer him but, Oh Rowena, I couldn’t. I don’t want to. I don’t want to leave my family here. Not even for Brodie.”
I knew Cas was invested emotionally in Jack and that he was hurting bad. And now throw Siobhan into the mix.
Standing back up, I start to pace, “Cas, I’m going out of my freaking mind here. What if Jimmy is hurt? What if his Dad has lost it and is……………………..oh goddammit, what was I thinking Cas. I’m the fucking adult. I should have overridden Jimmy and told him to expect a visit from Helen. But I wanted to respect his decisions, fuck”
Leaning in, he kisses me senseless. His hands at my waist pull me towards him as he moves them under my towel making it fall to the ground. As we grind our hips, our cocks rub against each other, which has us moaning into each other mouths.
“So, my friend,” I said, “The question I wanted to ask you is, are you in love with Siobhan as well??”
I was still reeling from what Cas had said. Could Siobhan recover from the fact that her child died so she could fulfil some prophecy? I know how I felt knowing that Chuck has pulled our strings for years. All the good I was feeling was nearly being eroded away from the hits we were getting lately.
But Jimmy shakes his head, “No, if I can help at all, I want to. It’s important. I want to help Michael, but I want to help you and Cas too, if you’ll let me”.
Ticking my fingers off one by one I said, “I got swimming shorts and hats for everyone, Rose gave me your sizes.
Oh my God, Cas looks gorgeous. He’s wearing his dark straight leg jeans, white shirt, open at the collar, sleeves rolled up halfway, and his hair a soft, adorable mess. Giving him my best smile, I answered him, “I wouldn't dream of barging into my dates home without an invite."
Castiel and Dean grin dopily at each other for a few moments before Castiel groans, “Dean, for the love of everything, kiss me.”
Suddenly the pain is gone and so is the voice. The Entity is still there but its distracted, it senses something……………joy…………….happiness
Sam looks on in disbelief, “Your kidding, right. There is no way Cas doesn’t want to see Dean or me. Why wouldn’t he want to see us? There’s no way…………………………….”
Cas comes with a shout, jerking into my mouth so hard, it takes all I have to keep swallowing him down.
Keith and Nicholas climb into the middle bed, and Joseph takes Jimmy’s old bed. Michael watches the goings-on quietly, but he looks better.
Eve snorts, “And if I decide to step outside this realm again, you’re there to stop me. This way, I have no one watching over my shoulder. As long as the Entity gets my children when they die, it’s happy. No rules to play by but my own”
Rowena climbed into the car and sat quietly beside me. I initially was annoyed by the intrusion, but her silent presence beside me was comforting.
Dean told me about his trip with Sam to meet Amara, and Cas told me of his case with Jack. I felt like I was only getting the bare necessities from them, but I didn’t want to push too much yet.
Cas seems to absorb that information, staring down at his empty plate before he stands up murmuring “I see, right, ok, ah excuse me”.
“I know, I am as well. I’m sorry but she told me this was the time to fight the Entity and…..Jack paused fighting for breath
Dean and Sam exchange a look, and Sam indicates for Dean to speak, “Jody, Donna, I died over a hundred years ago, about half that for Sam. You get to keep Sam for another long while. We were brought back to 2025 by an Angel because the Entity from the Empty wants to reset time and the Universe. Somehow it’s thrown us out of time and brought us here. We don’t know why, but I suspect it’s to throw Jack off his game and maybe to torture Cas and me.”
“What, what, no Sammy no, we’re not together, but yes I know, he told me” I said trying to calm down 6 foot 4 inches of sasquatch.
Sam eyes widen as he watches me, “You know………. How…………..wait are ye already together. Your together and you didn’t tell me, dammit Dean”.
Standing in front of the four boys under Sonny’s charge, I tried to make myself as small as possible. Cas and I were tall men and these boys looked so small compared to us. By the looks on their faces, they felt it too.
Jackie goes in first. I hear her murmur to Jimmy that he has visitors. Taking a deep breath, I walk into the room.
Dean takes a deep breath, “Donna, we’d love to. It’s going to take Jack or Arael to get us back anyhow. Let’s just enjoy the time we have, yeah.”
Feeling a frustration, I don’t recognize rising up in me I said “Cas, I’m not interested ok. I just want to help the boys and spend time with you”
“Ah right, right. Look stand up, please stand up. You don’t have to kneel, not to me. If you could just tell Naomi we are here, I’d appreciate it” smiling at him
I have my best friend at my side ready to take on this new challenge together and if deep down I feel contentment and peace at that knowledge, well it isn’t hurting anyone, is it.
Cas wastes no time. He coats his fingers with lube and leaning over me, staring into my eyes he inserts one finger.
Michael stares at Cas for a moment and then he moves towards him and places his hand on his cheek. Cas stays perfectly still as Michael seems to study him.
“I’m not ready to speak about it yet. There is something else I wanted to talk to you about. There is a case I’ve been following. Two people are missing. I wasn’t sure if it was our kind of case, but I thought maybe you and I could check it out?”
“You first, Dean. I was alone with that thing that spoke to me with my father’s face for a long time. He told me a lot of things about you and Cas and Sam. So, you first, tell me everything.”
Because its Sunday, and I’m tired from not just the afternoon’s activities but last nights as well, I suggest ordering pizzas and there is “yay’s” all round. Sending them up for showers, I order the pizzas and go to clean myself up.
Robin’s car is parked out front when I arrive home for her usual Tuesday afternoon lesson. Through the open window I can hear the guitar strings twanging, but it sounds an improvement on last week, I think.
After that we take a turn on everything though I rain-checked on the Ferris Wheel to the delight of Sam who teases me mercilessly.
“Oh Dean I wish I could, but I have another couple of house calls to make” she replied “I’m just letting you know that the doctor on my recommendation, is taking out Michael’s stitches, and removing the bag on Monday. I informed Michael just now and Cas and I decided that I would collect them both and bring them to and from the hospital”
“Thank you, brothers and sisters. I know what we ask is no small thing, but it needs to be done if we are to survive” Siobhan told them.
Lying on a blanket, in the May sunshine listening to the sounds of the boys, fooling around in the lake, while the drone of insects lulled me into a light doze, my mind drifted to this morning in bed with Cas.
I looked at him puzzled and asked was that some kind of compliment. Castiel with a stunned look at my face said “You are part Angel; I can see it now. But how??
Cas’s whispered words break the impasse. Dean starts moving, small strokes building up to deep plunges into Cas’s tight heat. Cas groans, his hands gripping Dean's hips and ass cheeks as he guides Dean to rock harder and deeper into him. Leaning back to change the angle, Dean knows he has hit the jackpot when Cas keens loudly as he loses himself in everything Dean. No one else exists in the Universe at this moment. It is just them.
“You be good for Dean, Cas and Rose you hear, but more importantly, you be good to yourselves. Now I know this is a big change, especially for you Jimmy but I wouldn’t have Dean and Cas here if I didn’t trust them. But even so, I’ll be giving each of you my phone number so you can call any time ok. If I don’t answer, leave a message and I’ll call back”.
The campus is pretty empty, just a few stragglers running to and from classes. The breeze is cool, and there is a distinct smell of Fall in the air.
I haven’t had much time to talk to her today so as I sit at the table with her, I ask how her weekend went.
“I know Dean” Cas said “We’ll find her, and we will fix this. I believe that. I have to believe that”
Sunlight streaming through the curtains is telling me though, that my alarm will be going off any second, but I don’t want to leave this body I’m curled around.
With a last squeeze, we leave the room. Cas and I climb the stairs heavily before collapsing into the bed.
I glance at Cas who’s gazing at the boys with a smile on his face. When I turn to Michael, he also has a hopeful pining look on his face. It’s so like the look that Cas gave me the night before we went to the beach, that I do a double-take.
Cas and I are stretched out on the couch, Cas is fast asleep and I'm lying on top of him, head on his chest and Cas’s arm around my shoulder. That isn’t even the strangest part. The strangest part is, it doesn’t feel strange, in fact, I can’t remember the last time I felt so comfortable. I'm sorely tempted to lie back down, but I didn’t lock the house up properly, I'd no idea where Miracle is, and it wouldn’t do for the boys to find us like this in the morning.
Cas bends down to pick up the remote control and turns the movie off. As he goes to leave, he turns to me and said, “Are you coming?”
“Ok” said Rowena “Boys you will have to stand back. This will get a bit dicey and I don’t need you in my way. Naomi will help with the timing of the spell which has to be exact.”
Both of us had only ever been with women so this was as new for him as it was for me, so we were taking it slow, but even we had to admit something was missing.
Dean took Siobhan from my arms and embraced her repeating over and over, “Never do that to us again”
I catch the phone when it slips out of Dean’s hand. Dean’s face is slack-jawed, and he struggles to respond to Helen. I coax him over to sit on the swing, my mind racing trying to take in what Helen told us.
Cas breaks the kiss to whisper in my ear, “I’m going to move you now” and before the words are even fully said, he pulls me up on my hands and knees, still inside me.
Rowena snapped her fingers and the Book of the Damned appeared on the table beside her. She picked it up and flicked through the pages until she found what she was looking for’
Cas huffed out a laugh and reached for me at the same time. Holding him tight, I said to him, “Don’t hold back if this is what you need Cas, I told you, whatever you need, it’s yours”.
Shaking my head, I said, “Crap. I shouldn’t have even told you that much, but yeah you can see why I’m worried. But I’m going to keep in touch with him after he leaves. Maybe I might be able to help if he needs it”
“Because” I said “He can get me there in the blink of an eye. The sooner we know if she’s on the level the better and also Jack can protect me if anything goes wrong.”
Cas and Michael come home from visiting Jimmy in high spirits. Cas said the two boys never stopped talking while he was there, and he even left them alone for a while and checked in with Adam, who reported no problems.
Touching her arm, I said as gently as I could, “Amy, all Nicholas wants is you. Despite his friends here and the days out, it was you he missed. As you say, the rest will come in time. I have a favour to ask. It’s something we started doing for the boys, who leave here. If you are not comfortable with it, we don’t have to give it to Nicholas.”
Cas sat up, “She does use sign language Jimmy. I have an idea. Why don’t we learn a greeting for Eileen for when she arrives? She’ll be delighted with that and It will make her feel right at home”.
“Dean, Cas look” I hear Jimmy call out. I feel Cas’s hands still and I groan silently as they leave my back, but I look in Jimmy’s direction.
“Ok guys, it's like the day at the beach. There’s a lot of people here, lots going on, so I want you to stay close to me, Cas or Sam and Eileen. Deal?”
“I love you, Siobhan” I replied “So much it frightens me. My love for you and Dean, its overwhelming at times.” I bent to kiss her.
Rose had gone all out. The table is set for four, complete with tablecloth, shiny cutlery and wine glasses.
“Well no” he said “We don’t hop clouds. I am a warrior of God, or at least I used to be. Now I live here with Dean, Sam and Jack and we fight……. Monsters and other things.”
The boys were reluctant to go to bed even though they were exhausted because they knew Sam and Eileen were leaving tomorrow. The boys were crazy about them already, especially Joseph.
“Let me guess Sam, little house on the prairie, white picket fence, couple of rug rats and the two of you sickeningly happy. Am I close?” I ask as cheerfully as I can, wiggling my fingers at the two of them, though the feeling of loneliness hits me like a freight train.
Castiel’s face blanched but he said “Siobhan, that was a long time ago and she has helped us since then.”
Staring at him, I said, “I would be willing to listen to that argument, Sam, if not for the conversation with Jimmy saying his father hadn’t been himself the days before he died; he was colder, cruder in his speech. Look, I don’t want to alarm the boys, but I’d feel better if we were back at the house. We have it warded. There’re weapons in the duffel bag. We each take a boy and escort them back.”
Pushing the bottles off his lap, Cas kneels up on the bed revealing he’s completely naked. Reaching for me, he says, “I love a diligent man. Who’s the boy scout now?”
My heart was pounding in my chest. I couldn’t believe that a day would come when I would be asking this question to someone, never mind two someone’s.
Dean turns but still holds Jimmy in his arms. “Dean, we have to contact Rowena. Let her know she has a loose cannon if she doesn’t know already.”
Keith's eyes widen even further before I wink and grin at him and he smiles back. Leaning in, I said, “Believe me, when you're older, the girls will love them” and I laugh as Keith gave me a disgusted look.
“I loved my son Rowena, so much. He was the light of my day” I began. “There was nothing I wouldn’t do for him”
As Cas and I made our way to the shower room to clean up I was thinking that maybe we had a chance. If Plan B worked, there was no reason for Plan A anymore and Jack would be safe. I was filled with optimism. That should have been my first warning.
Cas pulls back and smiles at me, his blue eyes slightly watery. His hands reach up to cup my face and he pulls me down slightly and kisses me on the forehead, his lips lingering. The heat from his hands and the feel of his lips and the smell of earth and air, that's all Cas, surrounds me until my head is swimming.
Staring into the abyss that is the Empty, the visitor can feel the memories and regrets of the awakened ones, as their raised voices howl and pierce his senses, but he can’t help them.
I can barely fill my lungs my breathing's hitching so bad, but all the while Cas holds me tight murmuring “I got you Dean” over and over.
Rowena looked at me with one perfectly arched eyebrow and I thought, “Oh boy this is going to take a while.”
We untangle from each other as we hurry our way to Jimmy. All these interruptions are making me think the universe does not want Cas and I together. I'm getting a bloody complex.
The boys laugh at that, and the tension seems to flow away, “Alright, showers for everyone and who wants pizza.”
Cas turns to me, his face wet from tears and that puzzled look on his face, but I continue “Or if you want, you could come with me”.
She sat up and found herself staring into four pairs of eyes, men’s eyes including the man with the kind face and the bluest eyes “Oh crap” she thought, “he is a psycho. In her apartment.” The she realised someone was talking, saying something to her but the noise in her ears was blocking out what they were saying.
When she sees what I’m doing, Eileen smiles softly, and I roll my eyes at her. But it's all worth it when Cas comes around the corner and sees what I've done.
“With you both”, is as far as I'm concerned, a bare faced lie, her adoration for Cas all over her face, but I plaster on my best smile as I say, “Well that is so kind of you to say, Ms Mason”, jumping up and pushing Cas gently towards the door.
Blushing she says, “I don’t think i can recreate those days out you did for him, not straight away anyway”
Jack was instrumental in solving the case and I was so proud of him. But I also noticed that he had struggled. I tried now to broach the subject.
Standing in front of the four boys under Sonny’s charge, I try to make myself as small as possible. Cas and I are tall men and these boys look so small compared to us. By the looks on their faces, they feel it too.
Saying goodbye to Sam and Eileen this time is not any easier, but I’m grateful for the time we had. The weekend was a complete success, and even Rose hates to see them leave.
Cas moves up behind me and I feel his hand on my shoulder, I turn to look at him as he says, “I know, but like always, I’ll go with you Dean”.
Cas laughs, “I used to be, Michael, not anymore”, but Michael is shaking his head, “No, Cas, you are, you feel different than anyone else.”
Passing the foyer again, I find Eileen hovering halfway down the stairs. She signs when she sees me, “Dean, what is it?”
Well, that's good but also not so good, because if I ever do come clean with Cas, I will have to use actual words and not actions.
Cas’s face is a picture. All squinty eyes and the most adorable pout, “I did not think this through. I can live without the burgers” and goes to lie on my lap again.
Joseph won the contest of the film choice with Despicable Me. The movie had us all howling with laughter (and more than a few tears from Sam) and was just what we needed to end the day. After it was over, there was one more surprise and it was from Michael.
For the rest of the day, I can barely concentrate. My mind is on my brother who is at this very moment, battling a large nest of vampires. A very large nest. And I’m not there.
“That’s good, that gives us time to get some work done on the garden before she gets here” Cas announces “You ready Jimmy”
It’s been a month since everything changed and I’m still processing it. Lying on my bed in my room in the bunker, Miracle atop of my feet, I’m still cataloguing our losses.
Later that night in bed, with Cas wrapped in my arms, his head on my chest, he confides in me that he is so nervous for Michael,
I woke later to gentle knocking on my door. Muttering a “Come in” Rose peeked her around the door and the smell of coffee wafted in with her.
Catching Sam’s eye, I indicate to him where I’m going before picking him up, carrying him around the side of the house and into the barn. I sit down on a crate, settle him on my lap, rubbing his back.
“No, you don’t understand” Naomi said, “The prophecy had to be fulfilled. For us all to survive, the prophecy had to come to pass. It was one boy against our whole universe. But I didn’t know Siobhan then, like I know her now. And she has been nothing but kind to me. I wanted to tell her, I truly did, but I couldn’t find the words.
Cas and I didn’t wake this morning until the alarm went off, so we had only time for some really hot kisses before we pulled apart.
I'm so impressed by Cas and his ideas and Sam is as well “That all sounds great. You really have put a lot of thought into this Cas. If I come up with any ideas maybe I could pass them onto you”
Cas smiles at Sonny as he continues, “After dinner in the evenings, their time is their own until lights out at nine”.
Sam purses his lips while nodding his head, “Well, you have Heaven on your side, and you’ve got Earth too.”
Sitting up straighter, I tell him, “Nick if you think that’s cool, Sam and Eileen train soldiers in combat. In fact, they might show you a new move or two”.
“Dad, dad stop, stop” Young Dean pulls at his father’s arm and manages to get his father’s attention.
Grabbing onto my arms, Cas’s sobs broke my fucking heart. I didn’t shush him, or tell him it was ok, because it wasn’t ok, none of it was fucking ok, but I held him as tight as I could and let him cry it out.
The boys take to it like ducks to water, even Michael, who soaks it up like a sponge. After our lesson, I pull Jimmy aside and ask him to learn a special message I want him to do, by himself. Jimmy laughs when I tell him what the message is, but I can tell he’s chuffed I asked him to do it.
“Thank God” I growl closing my laptop down, “I honestly thought you were going to get us to start painting every inch of the bunker next, cause like, it couldn’t be more ready”.
The silence behind him has him looking over his shoulder to find Sam squinting at him behind his glasses, “How did you know I married Eileen? We didn’t get together again until a year after your death, Dean.”
I grin back at him, “I know. This is what it's about. Getting them home or, if that isn’t possible, getting into a good home. But Sam, Walker is still out there, and I don’t want a repeat of what happened to Jimmy and his Dad.”
As I watch Keith climb the stairs it comes to me that all the boy’s clothes have a bit more wear and tear than usual. They all could use some new clothes. And haircuts.
“But I thought you liked Siobhan, Cas?” Jack said “When we came back from seeing Naomi and you heard she might not survive the Entity, I saw your face Cas, you were upset, very upset…”
Her skin was being sliced open by razor sharp blades, and she could feel the blood running freely, her skin was bubbling off from being dipped in molten lava,
And even though Sam is gone, Cas and I are still kissing. In fact, it's gone very quiet, and the only noise is the little gasps coming from Cas’s mouth which are if I’m honest are turning me on. Which only further confuses me.
Finishing the kiss with a suck on his bottom lip, I start a trail of kisses down his neck, across his chest until I suck a nipple between my lips making Cas arch off the bed with a gasp, “oh Dean please, so good”.
“I know that Dean” Sonny said as he squeezed me tight before pulling away. He bent down to blow kisses at Miracle before climbing into his car. With a beep of the horn and a wave, Sonny was gone.
Naomi went to leave but Rowena made for the bedrooms. I saw Naomi watch her go. Naomi hesitated but then she climbed the stairs and went out the door.
Reaching for Cas, I pull him into a hug, “I love you Cas. I love you so fucking much” I whisper into his ear. “And I'm not ashamed of us ok, I’m not. But we are going to meet people like that everywhere we go, and I want to have your back, just like you had mine, right now”
Jack’s face turns pensive, “The spell itself is easy; the leaders of each realm are the ingredients. It’s getting them all to agree to this; to work together is going to be the hardest job.”
We seem to be getting to be known in the town as some of the townsfolk give us smiles and “Hellos” as we pass them. It’s nice for the boys to be welcomed as well—a harassed Robin waves to us as we pass her restaurant, every table full.
The relief in the room is palpable, and a few more tears escape Jimmy's eyes, but he holds it together. I’m so happy for him. One less battle for him to fight.
I whisper his name softly, “Cas” as I lean forward and kiss him gently. A sob breaks his lips against mine, so I wrap my arms around him and hold him tight as his face wets my t-shirt.
Cas’s eyes filled with tears as he pleaded with me, “Dean please don’t be angry, I promise, I’ll never…….”
After breakfast, while the boys attend to their chores and Cas checks on the vegetable garden, I pack up the cooler for our lunch with the sandwiches I had prepared the night before, as well as drinks and biscuits.
That does it. I pull the car over, and it skids to a stop. “Enough, Dean. You are going to be no good to Jimmy or anyone else like this”
He made his way over to where Cas and I were lounging on the couch. Eileen was on one of the armchairs, with Sam on the floor leaning back against her legs. The boys are thrown down on the floor and Jimmy was lounging in a beanbag. Thinking Michael was coming over to Cas, I had my eyes on Sam when I heard Michael,
I was still standing there like an idiot trying to figure out what the Hell had just happened when I heard someone say my name.
It’s like Sam can’t help the smirk crossing his face, “Well, right this minute, Eileen is probably asking Cas the same question, and you know he’s going to tell her, and then I’ll know.”
Catching her sending Cas a saucy wink, she turns back to Sam and said teasingly, “Another Sam, I can’t turn down the chance to meet him. You did the right thing Cas”
Pushing his hat back, he bites out through clenched teeth, “Well you might stop making a public spectacle of yourself for a start”
But also”, I turned to Jack “Once the spell is done, you and I will have be joined at the hip if we ever leave the bunker, because God is going to come to us and we will only get one chance at this.”
But there's still an empty space. A space I can’t fill. A space only a six-foot, messy-haired, blue-eyed, former Angel of the Lord, best friend could fill.
His body under my hands is hard and soft, all lean muscles and tanned skin. But it’s his hardening cock that has my attention. Breaking our kiss, I drop to my knees to do what I have never done before.
I walk him to the passenger seat with my arm around his shoulder, and he climbs in. Helen smiles sadly over the roof of the car at me before she climbs in as well.
“You’re welcome Dean” Jack replied, and I swear I could feel his smile from where his face was buried in my shoulder.
I'm making my way back down from upstairs when I hear a car pull up out front. Rose comes out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a towel.
“Lord above Dean, I can hear you coming” Sam laughed as I came into view. Eileen was sitting at the table laughing at what Sam had said, not having heard said stomach talking.
I took it that he was, so I waggled my eyebrows at him lavishly, “What, so you can brazenly use my body for snuggles, you have no shame”.
We all give a hand clearing up after breakfast and then we march over to the chicken coop to watch how the boys feed the chickens, clean the coop and collect the eggs.
When he finally let Eileen come up for air, he proudly introduced her to everyone. His smile couldn’t have been any bigger.
Just then I hear the front door open. Peeking out of the kitchen I see Sam walking through the foyer in his running gear, face red as a tomato and hair dripping with sweat.
Cas brings his fingers up to his temples and starts massaging them, but before he can answer, I stop him, “I’m sorry, Cas, about this morning. I’m so fucking sorry. It came out wrong. I didn’t want you to stop touching me; just I was too angry for that kind of touch. And yet the minute you stopped, I craved you again, I always want you, just this morning……..”
Glancing at Cas walking beside me with Michael in his arms and Jimmy in mine, I had a longing that I was afraid to identify, didn’t want to identify because it was impossible.
His name spoken with reverence has him abandoning his eavesdropping. Spinning around, the most beautiful sight greets him, “CAS.”
Sonny leaned back in his chair and looked at me not unlike the way he looked at the 15-year-old Dean (cocky as all hell) Winchester, “I have to say, I was surprised it was Cas you brought with you and not Sam. But I’m glad you did. He has a quiet way about him, but knows how to cut though all the bullshit, you know”.
Jackie, encouraged by my words, continues, “Well, your arrival caused a stir. First that two such handsome men were arriving”
I had no sooner said the words when I found myself in a playground standing in front of a sand pit. There was nobody around.
Sam sighs, so much for easy, “Dean, it’s really me, Sam or as you call me even though I hate it, Sammy.”
I helped Cas settle her in the bed. The sheets were still a tangle from our earlier exploits. Jesus, that seemed so long ago when in fact it had barely been an hour. And what an hour we lived through.
Sam finally releases me, “Dean, you should see the two of you together. I have watched the two of you for years and I was always of the mind of “Hmmm, what’s going on here. You know with the staring and the pining when he was gone, and Christ when Lucifer killed him, Dean I was really worried that I would lose you too, you were so devastated, like you lost more than your best friend, you had lost your chance with him, but yet when Cas came back, nothing happened and then after Mom, you fell out in a bad way, I thought well maybe I was just imagining things. But now, Dean watching you together. It's like watching perfection, I mean you fit together like no other two people do, it's surreal”
Sam kneels down to look Michael in the eye and tells him he was lovely to meet him. Michael takes in his face and asks if he will see him again, and Sam says yes. Soon.
We both know he’s remembering Deputy Douchebag and his behaviour yesterday, as well as his parting threat. But to hell with him. I’ll just sic Jack on him. No, not Jack, I’ll sic Rowena on him.
There was a place to the rear of the house that would make a perfect spot for Cas’s vegetable garden. Trust Cas to come up with the perfect idea to keep the boys engaged and watch them see something they planted with their own two hands, grow and flourish.
I can hear the boy’s gasps at the suddenness of the move. Breathing hard, I stare up at Cas in surprise. He stares down at me in amusement.
He turns to look out the window breathing hard. I never take my eyes off of him. I want to go to him. I want to wrap my arms around him from behind and bury my face between his shoulder blades, but Cas has asked for space, so I stay in the chair, waiting.
He eventually says “Yes, I understand. I found it hard to read the boys files as well. And to hear Nicholas’s story tonight. So much hurt and pain. But I try to just deal with the person in front of me and follow their lead. At least that’s what my research tells me”
Cas nods his head “Good, I’ll head into town tomorrow and get some seeds and utensils to get us started”.
He looks a bit nervous entering the office as Cas, and I are there, but Helen said we could stay. When she tells him, tears spring immediately to his eyes, streaming down his face as he asks over and over, “Really, I’m going home.”
Dean clapped his hands together and said “I’ll organise drinks. Its celebration time.” Dean then smiled at Cas who returned the smile.
The sound of a car pulling up halted Cas’s question and I saw the familiar blue car of Helen’s through the window.
Cas is shaking his head as I shout, “NO, there’s no way, Helen. I don’t care what that man was doing to Jimmy; Jimmy wouldn’t kill him. He doesn’t have it in him. He loved his father.”
The rest of the evening once the TV is de-wobbled, is spent watching old re-runs of Stargate SG1 and Star Trek The Next Generation. There's something to be said for having the basic cable channels. It weeds out all the crap and leaves you with quality television.
My hands roamed his chest and side looking for more ticklish spots, as Cas tried unsuccessfully to stop me, laughing loudly.
Walking into the house, I'm surprised to see Cas standing there, wiping his hands on a towel. He has a strange expression on his face when he looks at me, but he then turns to look at Robin and greets her with a smile.
Finally, I hear Nicholas say, “Cas, Dean this is my mother. Mama, this is Cas and Dean, they’re great”
That did it. My cock jerked in Cas’s hands and I came hot and hard, as it mixed with Cas’s on his belly. Not able to hold myself up any longer, I collapsed down beside Cas, my face on his chest.
Of course, it was my boys talking, but this time instead of me hearing them talk about each other, this time I could hear them talk about me and what I meant to them. God, I loved them. And they loved me.
I growl into his shoulder, “You need anything, you pick up the phone you hear, other than that your only job is to get better, no worrying about this place, Cas and I, we’ve got this”.
I had time to allow myself to be me. To relax. To enjoy being with my friend and it was now becoming apparent how much of myself I had been denying. How much of myself I had been holding back, because our lives had been so crazy, so hazardous, so unpredictable.
I fill him in on the conversation before I ask, “I don’t want to break his confidence, but do you think I should call Helen?”
Nodding my head, I said, “I understand. I’m not here to give out, ok. I’m here to give you your conditions of release from my custody.”
“Yeah, it is”, Dean replies. I hear a shift in his breath before he stutters out, “Ah Cas, are you coming back to the hospital tonight?”
Dean and I look at each other. For a minute I thought we had lost the connection, “Helen, are you still there?”
Helen looks shocked at the suggestion, and even Cas starts beside me, “Dean, no, the boys are crazy about you. They only sing you and Cas’s praises every time I meet with them. I just don’t understand what’s happened with Jimmy; you and he were joined at the hip; I just don’t……….”
Sam couldn’t be more transparent if he tried, “Sam, for the love of Jack, spit it out? What’s on your mind?” I asked him.
A movement behind him caught my attention. Jack stood with his back to us. As he turned towards us, a pair of wings that seemed to span the horizon unfolded behind him. They were the colour of the whitest snow with the tips of each feather dipped in gold. It was the most magnificent sight I ever saw.
Sam looked at me for another couple seconds and then he rushed towards me and pulled me into a bear hug.
Sammy continues “I also know the reason you left back then was because of me. And I want you to know I really appreciate that”.
Returning back to Jimmy, I ask, “Do you want something else, coffee, tea?” but he shakes his head and takes the glass.
I saw Sam glance at me, rub the back of his neck, blew out a breath, looked at me again and then decided to think better of it.
I felt a bit bad though that Sam’s happiness only highlighted what was missing in my life. I missed Jack and I missed Cas; I missed my best friend.
Feeling my face go warm, I feel my usual embarrassment and panic whenever feelings especially mine are discussed. But I remember how I felt when Sam was on the hunt and I was afraid he wouldn’t know how happy I was if something happened to him, so I push that fear down and look my brother in the face.
Holding his gaze, I said, “Cas, it’s the same for me. I mean, I need this too. It’s not just you. But yeah, I want to take care of you, you’re important and I’ve screwed up enough times in the past with us, that I’m determined it’s not going to happen again. So, no matter what, whatever you need, it’s yours Cas, ok, it’s yours”
We break apart, Cas staring at me with a soft look on his face, “Thank you, Dean, I love them. Let me put them in water.”
After we see Helen to her car, we walk into the kitchen to find Rose, Sam and Eileen looking out the window laughing. As we join them, we look over their shoulders to see what they are looking at.
I held Siobhan like I would never let her go. We both stared in awe at Castiel’s wings. He was an angel again. It was a glorious sight, to add to all the amazing, frightening and miraculous events that happened today. I was starting to feel completely wiped out.
I took a deep breath and replied “The only creature that can kill the Entity in the Empty is a Prophet of the Lord, ordained in Heavenly fire, meaning part Angel, meaning me. I am the only thing that can kill the Entity. And Naomi didn’t tell us.
I look in the back seat to the boys who look excited, but I tell them no, “Believe me guys, where we are going, it’s better”
“Siobhan, this spell is a wee bit complex. I’m going to need some time to go through it and make sure we have everything we need, in the quantities that we need.” Rowena answered.
Fighting a grimace, I look Cas in the eye, “I loved my father too. I loved him, and I hated him. And I see the same struggle in Jimmy. And it is a struggle, Cas. A hard one and I hate that I’ve made it harder.”
As we headed back to the room we arrived in, a thought came into my mind. I turned to the boys and said “You go ahead. I need to ask Naomi something”
But everyone else we lost when Chuck did his whammy are back including Eileen, who I can hear laughing down the hall, no doubt at something goofy that Sam had said. I was happy for Sam, for both of them, remembering when Eileen had knocked on the bunker door only a month ago, the look on my brother’s face was nearly worth all the crap we had gone through beforehand.
I opened my eyes and with tears flowing I told a stunned Castiel what I saw. “The boys don’t know, do they?” I asked him. He didn’t have to answer, I could tell by his face.
They obviously found nothing scary in my mock glare as they all dissolved into giggles, with Miracle barking in solidarity.
With my head buried in his shoulder again, I said, “Cas, I’m the one who should be asking you that, if you are ok to be here, with me, when I can’t return…………………”
“Dean” Cas said “Siobhan has seen your life. She has seen what you have been through, what you endured. She knows where the temper comes from.
“Dean, Sam when I rescued Jack from the Empty it was because I made a deal. A straight swap. Me for Jack.”
"Did you have a good day?" I ask him, throwing my arm around his shoulder. He grins up at me, saying "Yeah, I love the lake. It’s really cool there”
Cas’s cock was long and thick, nestled in dark hair. I wrapped my hand around and stroked it slowly, taking my time in this new sexual experience.
Giving her a tight smile, “Anything else I should know. Now that the stitches and bag are out, is he able to shower or………………”
“Sorry Rose,” I said grinning at her, “Meet my brother Sam and Eileen. Guys, this is Rose who looks after this madhouse”
Things are still a little awkward between Cas and me, and I hate myself for not clearing the air. But I hate it even worse that Cas thinks his touch isn’t welcome. Cas has been careful not to touch me, and it's breaking my heart that I made him feel this way.
“I didn’t come because I knew I could do nothing. It was up to the witch to reverse the spell. She did, didn’t she?” Naomi asked
The Deputy Sherriff is wearing a uniform consisting of green khaki shirt and pants, cream Stenson seated on his head and a gun belt around his waist, complete with gun. His face is red and sweaty as if he'd been running.
It's Sam who responds, "No Cas, everyone’s good. It was tough, not going to lie, but the training with this crew really paid off. It's something I'm going to keep concentrating on. But now, we are on a weeks’ vacation”
I shrug, scrubbing my hand across my forehead, “It’s a recurring nightmare from my childhood. I haven’t had in years. I was drowning, and I couldn’t reach Sam. No prizes as to why I had it tonight”
Michael did that thing where he takes in your whole face. Seeming to be satisfied with what he sees, he asks, “Are we still going to the lake tomorrow? You said next time I could go in the water”
Taking a deep breath, I walk over to the boys, “Hey guys, we’re going to have to cut our visit short. We just got a warning; there have been sightings of black bears around these parts, so we need to go.”
That evening and the next couple of days are some of the best and relaxed times I've spent with Sam and Eileen. I love watching their interactions with the kids, having the banter with Rose and even teasing Cas and me on how smitten we are with each other.
Cas looked at me seriously and said, “Siobhan, there’s something you need to know about Jack?” And then they told me about the end game with Jack.
“Cas I’m sorry, I’m sorry you thought that, never ok never. I couldn’t believe he said it, is all. I actually couldn’t believe I heard those words coming out his mouth. And in front of the kids” I shake my head still in disbelief.
Sonny opened the attic door and swung it wide open, “When I heard you were bringing Cas, I got two new beds for you, queen size but unfortunately I couldn’t spring for another room”.
Rose laughs “I think we’ll have to install a coffee machine in your room Dean so you can be caffeinated before you grace us with your presence”.
For the next few hours I kissed, stroked and touched this beautiful man, telling him over and over everything I loved about him and how I would never leave him. We climbed together on sensations so exquisite, so mind blowing that when we fell, we fell together.
Watching Keith stomp on Cas’s foot and slither from his grasp, I hunker down next to Rose and ask how many times Cas’s foot had been stomped on today.
I could feel the power radiating from my body through my hands and into the Entity. He fought and squirmed against me, but I was strong, and he couldn’t touch me. I could feel the bonds of this place coming apart and with a final grunt from the Entity, he was no more.
Helen sighs, “I’m afraid not, Dean. There’s no sign of Jimmy, and we are still waiting on the autopsy results. We have checked all the local hospitals.”
“Hell no, you will always be D-Dawg to me” Sonny said with an answering laugh and he embraced me tightly.
When Jack went to her and told her what I had found, the words Final Prophet, Aquaductus and Nephilim together she went back and searched for those three words. When she did, it unsealed new text and revealed the final prophecy.
Dean takes a deep breath, “No, I mean, there were moments when I would feel something between us but then…….”
“Good, listen when you’re finished eating can we do a few mental exercises, I really feel the information is coming so much easier now.” I asked
I shower first and make my way down to the kitchen where Sonny, Rose and the boys are just sitting down to breakfast.
Technically speaking, Cas wasn’t Jack’s father, but he found he did not want to correct her. She calls him Grandfather in private, but Castiel, when on a mission, like now.
Dean and Cas moved passed me from the map room into the research room and I heard Sam say “You’re back. Did you………….” stopping when he saw me behind them.
We should be compassionate but still keep our distance is what they taught us. Don’t get too attached; the Matron used to say to us. You nurse them, and you send them home.
Looking bold and flushed, she asked what had got me into such a good mood. My jitters yesterday had not gone unnoticed by Rose.
My heart sank as something occurred to me, “Cas, he can’t stay here; as his abilities grow, there will be incidents, things he will do that he doesn’t mean to. For example, Jesse made the tooth fairy manifest. Can you imagine what Michael could do in a houseful of boys who have nothing but their hopes and dreams? There would be chaos, and we might not be able to hide it.”
When they see the visitors, the look on the boy’s faces is priceless, especially Joseph, who launches himself at Eileen and then Sam without hesitation. When Joseph’s giggles have quietened down to reasonable decibels, Michael approaches Sam and says hello, signing as he does. Sam says hello and signs right back. Eileen crouches down to Michael’s height to say hello, and she is rewarded with his crooked smile.
Rose arrives at the back door, looking surprised to see Cas and I already in the kitchen looking worse for wear, but when she catches Sam and Eileen coming through the door, she whispers, “What happened?”
I peeked around the curtain on the window just as Naomi started calling “Siobhan, Jack are you there? It’s me, Naomi.”
“But Cas what, Dean. Dude is crazy about you. Have you not seen the way he looks at you? So, no matter what you’ve fought about, you know Cas will forgive you like he always has. Just like you always have where he’s concerned” Sam said, patting my hand.
Sometimes she felt like she was dreaming and some moments she felt she was with Dean and Cas. She could hear them near her, and she felt safe. She drifted some more.
We all ran for the stairs, Sam in the lead. He crashed through the door with the three of us on his heels. We then stood there looking up at the sky. The sky was lit with a white brilliance as if someone had turned on a light up there.
I smile then, “Of course it was a good idea. It was Helen’s idea after all” and I was glad to see her blush.
When we get to the treeline, I hold out a hand to stop Cas. Standing hidden among the trees, we take deep breaths to even out our breathing. The last thing we want is to frighten the boys. Surveying the surrounding landscape, all looks quiet, but there are too many places for anybody to hide.
Jackie waves him off, “I was there as well. I saw what happened and I’m so sorry. We have taken steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
Turning to look at the surrounding land that’s lush and wild with flowers, oak trees lining the perimeter of the property, I took a deep breath of late spring air, then turned to the man behind me.
We entered the bunker together and found Sam sitting at the map table with his laptop opened in front of him. Jack wandered in at that moment eating a sandwich (that kid was always eating) and we asked them both if they had seen Siobhan.
Cas and I are left standing in the foyer, “I could use a drink, but I suppose we had better settle for coffee”.
Then Sam seemed to pull himself together and said, pointing his finger at the three of us “Consenting adults, right? he asked but was looking at Siobhan
Alt Dean starts laughing and Cas and I are left staring at each other in confusion before I roll my eyes.
“Ok Dean. I’ll be good.” Jody replied “I’ll head up to the cabin, turn on heat and water. I’ll also get some supplies in”
We help the boys with their chores before we leave them to do their schoolwork, telling them if they have any problems, they can find us in the office.
I like the kitchen immediately. The walls and cabinets are cream with yellow accessories. The curtains, the handles on the kitchen cabinet doors, even the mugs on the table all yellow. It gives the impression of warmth, sunshine, but more importantly, it's welcoming.
Two hours later I arrive back to the house, with the trunk of the Impala full of my purchases for our day ahead.  It isn’t even 10am yet. The early May sun is shining and judging from the heat already, it's going to be a scorcher of a day. Perfect.
Twenty minutes later I arrive in the town of Fallsburg. Its slightly bigger than Hurleyville and nobody knows who I am here. There’s also a Walmart, where I can find everything I need.
Being with Siobhan was another amazing experience. He could honestly say that last night, this morning and a few minutes ago was the best sex he ever had in his life. And that was saying something.
Tilting my head, I said, “They seem to be, but I thought, Michael here could do with some fresh air. What do you think Michael, would you like the watch the boys, as we teach them?”
