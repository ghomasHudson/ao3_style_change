Eileen was genuinely happy for Dean. From her conversations with him and Castiel, it was obvious they were it for each other. Those two seemed to have been fighting it for years. She was glad they finally decided to put all that pining to good use.
The accommodations were great but the best part of the bunker was easily their family, more specifically, their son. Jack brightened every room he walked into and his wonder amazed Sam. He loved teaching Jack about the world around them and helping him learn how to do everything they could do.
“Dean I want you to know that I am here for you. I want to help you see yourself the way we all see you. I was happy to give my life for yours because you are a hero and deserve to be happy. If you would let me in, I want to help you. I know what I said and I still mean it. I am happy as I am and you don’t need to give me anything more than I already have”
Dean smirked and reeled in his line to recast. They stayed like that for the rest of the day: reeling, casting, catching, releasing, and simply enjoying their time together in easy silence. They joked here and there as well and talked about some of Dean’s older memories.
Just a little content warning for implied alcohol dependence and angst! Other than that, enjoy and let me know what you think!
The tension was only cut when Dean spoke as he threw the car in park, not caring that he was taking up two spots in the mostly barren motel lot. “I’m not spending the night in a sleazy motel. We’re going back home tonight. Pack your stuff. We leave in an hour.”
“Hold still!” Jody called down to Donna who was holding the ladder her friend was standing on. Donna chuckled as Jody reached up to hang streamers high on the walls of the war room. They had been decorating for a few hours since Sam convinced Dean to go on a pie run.
Eileen tapped her foot in annoyance as she waited for the large metal door to be opened. She had texted Sam a few minutes before notify him that she was back and her arms were getting sore from the bags she had.
I hope you all can see where my inspiration for this fic came from now. These lyrics spoke to me from the first moment I truly listened. No, this does not mean Unity was all a dream. It was real and as far as any of us believe, this was season 16 and this is where their stories truly ended: alive, healing, happy, and at peace together. I said what I said.
“Hey, Sam?” She turned to the man with a question biting at her tongue. It had been on her mind since she moved back into the bunker but had never seemed appropriate to ask until now.
Hello Lovelies! Shit's about to get ANGSTY!!!!!!!! That's all I really have to say about this one but....
“How is Dean? The last time I was home he seemed to be quite angry with you.” Jack’s voice was full of concern as he looked up at Castiel’s face.
The wall was scrubbed for nearly an hour until Sam was absolutely certain that not a single remnant of Dean’s grief was left to stain the brick. He dropped the rag in the bucket, its contents having turned a deep red during the cleaning process, and surveyed the room one final time before closing the bookcases and pulling the dungeon door shut behind him.
Castiel realized he must have been staring for a tad too long to follow human protocol because one moment the man’s profile was in his sights, the next his eyes were locked on daring jade greens staring at him inquisitively. The furrow returned but instead of stress or frustration, the angel saw curiosity splayed on the man’s features.
Miracle had come into the kitchen towards the end of their conversation and had stayed at Dean’s feet the whole time he ate. Sam had smiled when he noticed Dean’s fingers ghost over the dog's fur for comfort. He even pretended not to notice the crust that Dean snuck the dog, just happy that they were interacting again.
“Hi Sam” She spoke and signed to keep her hands from shaking. She knew this call was important, but Eileen could not resist the urge to melt into Sam’s eyes and simply stare.
He stared down the man’s frame as he positioned himself for the first strike. Castiel took inventory of every bend in his limbs as if studying his position. The way his elbows bent as he bowed over the table: The way his bright eyes stared down the table with intense concentration: The way his feet planted wide under his shoulders. It was all so complex yet seemed effortless.
“I’ve noticed that too. I thought maybe everything with Heaven was too much so I stopped summoning him as much. He still seems worn down. I’m worried, Sam. Is he going to be ok?”
Hey lovies! Back again with another chapter! Get ready for some mild angst. Let me know in the comments what you think and if you have any recommendations for future chapters!
When Tiffany returned to the table with Sam’s salad, Eileen’s chili, and Jack’s toasted sandwich, they all thanked her and dove into their food. Jack was more than pleased with Sam’s guidance when making his choice, commenting that it was almost as good as Dean’s cooking.
He tugged at the hand until the two were directly face to face. He could see the emotion and anxiety reflected on Castiel’s face that Dean felt to the depths of his soul. There was no other way to describe it. Perhaps the angel too was just as terrified of what they were attempting to share.
Castiel raised his hand and cut the man off “If I remember correctly, you and I got in a fight because you wanted to return it. I felt it only reasonable that you receive a gift for your birthday that you want to keep.”
Dean watched as Castiel played with his glass and stared intently at the table. It was obvious the angel was thinking deeply. His brow furrowed and a frown settled on his mouth. It concerned Dean to see just how shut in Castiel seemed to be.
“I’m fine Cas. Really. The adrenaline must have just worn off. That’s all.” Dean turned to walk away but hissed again as he felt the white-hot pain burn up his back from the wound he’d received earlier that day in the barn.
Sam grabbed one of the first aid kits and brought it to the map table, ready to start patching Eileen up, when a quiet zap came from the kitchen. The three immediately grabbed their favorite weapons and moved to the sound as a unit with Dean leading the charge.
“DEAN Calling” the screen read and Castiel’s heart sank. He hadn’t even thought about letting the man know that he was leaving or where he was going. He was sure he was about to receive quite an earful from the hunter.
“After Cas warded the door, her grasp on me was blocked. I was finally able to think straight and try to come up with a plan. Sammy, we tried but we just couldn’t think of anything. She was just so damn angry. I thought we might be able to wait her out because she was dying but I knew that wouldn’t work. I knew that she would get through and kill us both.
After years of fighting for their free will, Chuck was finally gone, Amara and Jack were ruling in harmony leaving Jack the opportunity to just be a kid, and Team Free Will finally had the chance to lay back and appreciate life as it came. So Dean chose just that: a day of laying low, drinking cool beer, listening to the roiling waves, and soaking in the rays of the afternoon sun.
It took a moment for him to realize what he was holding, but once his eyes skimmed over the clean edges and glass center, Dean recognized an empty photo frame. On the side was an engraving that tore at his heart in just the right way.
“Are you sure we should be leaving you alone?” Eileen noticed Sam say to Dean with a suggestive flick of his eyebrows.
The hunter watched as Sam nodded and carried the now wailing baby out of the house and into the cool night. Dean stood several feet away from his brother and the crying child as he willed himself to light the pyre. Suddenly it felt that lighting it would make the situation far too real and he couldn’t focus with the screaming next to him.
Dean felt fireworks explode behind his eyelids as he desperately tried to keep tears from spilling from them. This was just what he needed to hear. Still, could it even be possible Castiel loved him in that way? He was not created to feel. Could he even have the capacity to love as humans do?
Dean crouched to the ground, grabbing his machete. He sauntered back over to the hanging vampire with fire in his eyes. Dean grabbed the machete with one hand on each end and placed it against her neck, readying himself to slice her head clean off.
“Drink and eat. You need to. I can practically smell the alcohol coming off of you and I feel like I’m watching you waste away. You cannot convince me you don’t see it too. Basically, you are not leaving this table until that glass is empty and that plate is clean and I don’t mean against the wall or on the floor. You hear me?”
Dean milled about and graciously thanked guests over and over again. There were a lot whom he didn’t recognize but they all seemed to know who he was. He even found himself not caring about the number of monsters in attendance, even if he didn’t immediately recognize most of them.
“Sam! Long time no see!” Garth walked up to the hunter with baby Sam in his arms and his wife close behind with baby Castiel. “How the Hell are ya?”
Eileen whipped around in Sam’s arms upon feeling the shaking of the room. They both stared in horror at the writhing angel on the ground. His back arched sharply and his face turned toward the ceiling, the white light growing even more intense than before.
In addition, this chapter was meant to be the original ending of this work. After time, I found myself writing in a different direction and changed the story to be slightly longer. If you, however, are sick of my writing or are ready for a finale, this chapter would be an excellent place to stop.
“I can’t do this. Not right now. Please.” Dean’s plea came out in a whisper as he stared at Castiel, face contorted with his attempt to hold back the flood of emotions that were pent up inside.
Jack pushed two massive pearl doors open to reveal a large white balcony surrounded by a pearl gate of similar material to the doors. He walked to the gate and gestured widely for Castiel to look.
Hello Lovelies! Here is part two of the two chapter angst fest! WARNING: This chapter includes a lot of deep and dark shit. This chapter will include references to childhood neglect, domestic abuse, domestic violence, emotional abuse, homophobia, biphobia, underage prostitution, and hella angst. Please be cautious if any of those themes may be triggering for you.
Hello Lovelies!  No new warnings for this chapter, just a little angst and references to blood and violence.
“Please, Dean. It’s been a month of this. It’s exhausting for me and I bet it’s way worse for you. You don’t eat, you barely sleep, Miracle whines every time he passes your room, you’re falling apart and I am really worried ab….”
“Good job! See I told you that you were a natural. You’re getting better every time.” Sam said proudly over the loud echoing in the room.
With all that being said, be sure to let me know what you think in the comments. Also, be sure to leave requests for other work topics and ship dynamics here or on my tumblr, rowanspn...
“Alright, I’m going to leave you two crazy cats alone,” Dean said when Sam returned her to her feet.
Of course, when he reached the room where Kelly lay dead, Sam stood in the doorway blocking Dean’s view of Lucifer’s offspring inside.
The angel approached the gate apprehensively and gasped when he saw what Jack was signaling towards. Below them stood thousands of angels at attention all staring up at Jack as if awaiting orders.
All at once, Castiel understood exactly what worried him. Dean was concerned he would fall out of love with the man just because he would age, require sleep, fall ill, and eventually die, unlike Castiel who would likely do none of the above.
The employee laughed and folded up a shirt before handing it to the angel. “Don’t worry, that’s my job. This one should fit him. Anything else I can help you with?”
“I don’t know.” He looked into Castiel’s eyes but was surprised when the angel didn’t push further. He only stared back while waiting for Dean to continue.
Dean felt himself grip Castiel’s arm tighter at the thought. As they found a rhythm and began to turn to the beat of the song, Dean tilted his head to look Castiel in the eyes. When he tried to speak Castiel interrupted before anything could come out.
“What can I help you with?” The employee asked. Castiel looked at them and took in their spiked hair and kohl eyeliner. He grinned at how much they reminded him of Claire.
He was ready to back away but just as the fifth flash echoed against the backs of his eyelids, Dean felt a set of lips on his. It was much softer than he had imagined. Always had he thought they would meet with a sharp crashing or a heated fervor most likely induced by a hunt gone wrong or the end of times but it was nothing like that. There, in that booth, he was met with a touch so gentle he could hardly recognize it while his flaming cheeks were framed by a strong set of hands cradling him like he was something fragile and worthy of care.
Jack approached the pair and touched his two fingers to Castiel’s forehead. He grimaced in concentration as he healed Castiel’s numerous wounds. The plethora of gashes and broken bones took a little longer than usual to heal due to Jack’s exhaustion, but soon enough the angel was back in one piece.
“When I opened the rift to the Empty and attempted to bring you back, it was because I wanted you home. We all wanted you home and you didn’t deserve to be trapped there. The trouble is that I had ulterior motives as well. I need your help.” Jack finally raised his gaze to meet Castiel’s eyes.
“Our frame,” Dean corrected and started tugging Castiel back into the booth. “Besides, that frame has room for a couple more. Now get in there and get comfy.”
“Sorry. You’re too late for that.” Dean choked out around the steadfast grip digging into his trachea.
Dean knew the Empty was cold and dark and full of nightmares but he had never seen Castiel this terrified before. He was trembling all over and gasping with sobs and Dean rocked him slowly. The hunter did not need to know exactly what he saw to understand what happened. Dean remembered being that terrified before: he used to wake up like that after his mother died.
Dean took a final longing look into the hallway where Castiel was rocking the now sleeping baby and talking animatedly to Bess. It really was adorable how Castiel had managed to avoid the throngs of partygoers all to spend more time with the baby werewolf. He looked so happy to have the child in his arms and Dean wondered if he missed not being able to do that with Jack. He smirked lightly before stepping out of the kitchen and back into the library.
Castiel leaned forward in interest. He had a good idea of where Jack was going with this and he couldn’t help but feel himself beaming with pride. If he had been asked just a few years ago if he would ever be a parent, he would have responded with a definitive no. Despite this, here he was, listening to his son recount his plan for Heaven and his heart was swelling with joy.
He is going to spend the rest of eternity lost in that self-hating skull of his, dreaming about every loss, every kill, every disappointment, and he will never find peace. I assume that’s the answer you were looking for?” the Shadow had approached Jack and began whispering in his ear.
Castiel picked up the torn shirt and held it tightly in his hands. The memory of that time they shared was one of his favorites. He had been struggling with Claire at the time and somehow, Dean had managed to make him feel even a little bit better. Even then, Castiel had tried improving Dean’s self-image, but the man had not seemed to understand how deeply Castiel valued him.
“Not all of them. He was not drawn to a lot of it actually. If there weren’t sweets or large stuffed bears, he wasn’t all that interested.”
“No Cas, we’re just hanging out. You deserve a break buddy.” Dean locked eyes with the angel in the rearview mirror and smirked.
“I am currently having difficulty selecting a gift. What would you recommend for the birthday of a middle-aged man?” Castiel scanned the shirts again, overwhelmed by the many options.
Jack grimaced as Castiel blocked his line of three chips and looked for a new spot. “Well, it’s about having a monster inside you. I guess I used to be like that but you guys helped me.”
“I just want you to know who I am!” Sam watched as Dean grinned around the lyrics and dropped his right hand to the seat next to him. There was no doubt in his mind that he was reaching for Castiel’s hand.
“Who would ever follow a warrior of Heaven who bent at a human’s feet?” They would ask him, disgusted with his fall from grace. No warrior of Heaven would ever give their life to worship one simple human, yet here Castiel was, cleaning up Dean’s messes over and over again. The worst of it was that he enjoyed it.
As he beamed, Dean could not help the sharp pain of gratitude filling his chest. Birthday gifts were such uncommon occurrences for Winchesters let alone parties. Yet, here was his best friend, the warrior who saved him from the torments of Hell, the angel who had risked his life more than too many times for him, the being who made a losing deal to save their son and finally gave his life to save Dean once again by simply being his happiest in loving Dean. Here that angel sat giving him a novelty shirt and stuffed animal to celebrate the passing of time that was so precious to humans. Angels did not value time in the same way and despite this, here he sat giving Dean everything the man did not know he needed.
Castiel slowly nodded and his lips pursed into a thin line. He grasped Dean’s shoulder where he had left his handprint so many years ago. “This might hurt.” The angel hovered his palm over the wound and felt his grace surge through his fingertips as his hand began to glow a soft gold.
“Thank you,” Eileen said as she signed “I will remember that. I’ll call Sam and take this one from here. It was nice seeing you.” She smiled fondly. Jody had really begun to grow on her. She missed her mother and at night, Eileen liked to believe that her mother would have been like Jody. Kind, warm, and comforting but simultaneously the scariest person you had ever seen when she was angry.
The inside of the bar was plastered with cheap decorations fitting the cheap holiday. Pink, red, and white plastic spirals hung from the ceiling and roses adorned the tables around the room. Rumpled pink and white crepe paper draped the walls along with tacky hearts and angels.
At that moment, friendship, love, care, bliss, joy, hope, longing, desire, and passion were all ruined for the righteous man: there would never be another that could bring him such emotions in as great intensity as the angel in the dirty trench coat. He was sure of that.
Castiel reached towards Dean’s face to heal him, but Dean caught his wrist before he could. He gently lowered his friend’s arm and looked towards the floor.
“Some bitch vamp got the jump on me. She was about to kebob me but I got things turned around and skewered her instead.” Dean felt Castiel’s fingers stop cold and heard a gasp behind him. The hunter turned his head to look over his shoulder and saw a strained look on Castiel’s face.
61 down, 1 to go! The pressure is on but be warned, while this chapter is not nearly as dark as the others, it does have several references to themes regarding anger, depression, and substance abuse.
By the time the waitress had returned, Sam had coached Jack through the menu and helped him choose his lunch. They each ordered in turn and sipped at their drinks while they waited for the waitress to return.
Dean returned the gesture with a punch on Sam’s shoulder and a totally in-character “shut up” before turning and practically running out the door towards his room.
Dean watched as Castiel crowded into his space to stare at the small pictures. In the first, Dean sat, mouth open mid-laugh as Castiel stared at the camera in horror. In the second, Dean stared at himself grinning ear to ear. In the photo, Castiel’s head was tipped in that inquisitive way, his nose scrunched, his eyes squinted, and Dean’s profile stared him down with a look of wonder. Of course, Dean would never admit out loud that wonder was not the only emotion on his face, but adoration was evident as well.

“You give me domain here. I have domain in every other part of the universe. I do not run every territory, such as Hell or Purgatory, but I have domain there, meaning I can enter and exit freely, taking and giving as I please.
Dean squared himself at the table and easily sunk three shots in a row. On the fourth turn, the cue ball missed his target by a long shot but Castiel did not see any disappointment in the man’s face.
Sam thought about this for a moment and then reached out to ruffle his older brother’s hair. “You’re gonna need a shave”
Embarrassment burned Castiel’s cheeks as he realized he had been staring at the man far too long if he was being noticed. “No.”
“Dance with me.” Castiel reached his hand out for Dean to take and stared into the man’s shocked eyes.
You were once my charge, Dean. I became too close to you to the point Heaven intervened but even they could not stop me. You made me your friend, you made me your family, and you became the one thing I needed in this world. You taught me everything I really know and for that, I am grateful. You changed me, and because of that, you made me something no angel has ever been blessed to be before: happy.”
Castiel’s heart dropped in his chest and he nodded as Dean got up to leave. He didn’t move as Dean patted his shoulder three times before walking out of the room. Once he had left, Castiel looked over his shoulder and felt a single tear slip down his face.
Hello Lovelies! First and foremost, HAPPY PRIDE MONTH TO YOU ALL! Please be warned! As much as this month means to me, I understand the pressures around coming out of the closet this month. If you do not feel completely safe or comfortable in your home environment, please do not feel forced to come out until you are ready and safe!
So he leaned forward, finally letting himself begin to close the gap that had plagued their friendship for too damn long. To his surprise, it wasn’t like he anticipated. He expected awkwardness when their noses would inevitably collide and he expected warmth from shared breath.
“Of course I mean it,” Castiel whispered as he reached for the man’s shoulder. “There was nothing more important to me that year than your survival and your prayers were reassurance that you were safe.
Eileen pulled in alongside the Impala and the trio made their way into the war room. When they dropped their duffels onto the map table, Eileen noticed Dean’s solemn expression and she looked to Sam for an explanation. When he only lightly shook his head at her, Eileen decided to drop the subject
Castiel reached for the phone but a shiny black shoe landed on his wrist, effectively pinning him down. He looked up the suited frame that was awash in sunlight and tried to focus. Castiel did not recognize the man.
If you give me domain in your territory, I can keep the balance in the universe, all while never needing to wake you for your permission. I will only take what is necessary and give you those who require more permanent ends to their stories.”
As Sam packed a few sets of clothes along with his preferred weapons, he couldn’t help the smile that was creeping into the corners of his mouth. Dean was actually talking to him. He could hardly believe it. He had actually watched Dean eat in front of him for the first time in weeks and he even got to see Dean drink something other than booze. He could even hear a batting in the hallway and the scratching of claws on the floor as Dean threw a ball for Miracle to chase.
“Well, that is nice at least.” Eileen ruffled Sam’s hair before standing to follow Jack to the counter.
Disappointed and almost ready to give up, Castiel reached the back wall where at least 50 different types of t-shirts were displayed on racks. An employee noticed him staring intently at the display and approached him.
The sight was both hilarious and bliss as Dean approached their slice of paradise with his angel’s hand in his. As they neared, everyone looked up at them and a choir of satisfactory faces surrounded them with the warmth only family can produce.
Donna had called her and Jody that morning with what appeared to be their kind of case but the women had never seen anything like it before. A woman was found, the fifth one in ten days drained entirely of her blood with an odd black substance draining from her eyes, ears, and nose. When Eileen joined Jody for an inspection at the morgue, they were stumped. The substance appeared to be ectoplasm.
The salesperson laughed. “Yeah, we don’t have anything like that although we do have some band tees over there. Any of those appeal to you?”
By the time he finished the song, Castiel was sniffling but the sobbing had stopped. Dean looked down at the angel and could see stray tears slipping out of his eyes every few moments as he clung to Dean’s flannel.
Dean’s eyes had glassed over with fresh tears. Sam could tell it was hard for him to talk about it, so without a word, he simply rewound the tape and put it back in the deck, letting the first song start again for the fifth time.
She shuddered at the thought of how the boys might be doing. She hadn’t allowed herself to venture down that territory since she and Sam parted ways the week prior. Eileen knew that if she did, she would worry herself sick to the point of going over to check on them and she just couldn’t do that to Sam. She knew he needed the space, even if he hated every second of it.
The end is here. As much as it saddens me to let this go, the time has come. After all, what is a good story without a final chapter?
He grimaced at the thought and tried to urge it away, but the sensation of Castiel holding him overwhelmed him and Dean realized that swaying with the angel felt as easy as breathing.
“Since you became my nervous nellie dad stand-in.” She smirked around her beer as the usual sarcastic composure returned to her smile. “Now go get ‘em, tiger.”
Jack swallowed his last bite of sandwich before thinking carefully and asking his next question. “Is that why he always fights with you or Castiel?”
BEWARE! Major angst and some sketchier themes surrounding anger and violent outbursts. Mostly just pure raw angst that I absolutely adore!
I remember finding you by that river and feeling like the world had come off my shoulders. Then you stayed behind and I blamed myself until you found me again. I saw you everywhere. You were in reflections in windows, walking down lonely roads, a face in a crowded bar. I thought I was going crazy.”
“Of course.” Castiel began packing up the Connect Four game when Jack sat back down on the bed. They sat in silence as Castiel packed and Jack unpacked.
The smile on Dean’s face widened as the boy apologized to the fish, removed the hook, healed its mouth, and released it back into the water. All the while he was busy with his fish, Dean took pictures of Jack beaming and addressing the fish with overwhelming kindness to show Sam and Cas once they got home.
Eileen tugged her top on and tuned to find Sam doing the same. As he redressed, she meticulously unpacked her bags and returned her belongings to the dressers and closet they belonged in.
Dean approached the crib slowly and raised his gun while turning the safety off. He was prepared to do whatever it took to keep that monster from killing anyone else he cared about. The angels and demons had made it clear that this Nephilim could rip the world apart with its bare hands and he intended to prevent any such actions.
The hunter gasped as he swatted weakly against the vampire’s grip on his throat and hissed as his jacket caught on the rebar. As his grip weakened from the lack of oxygen and being easily overtaken by the vampire’s brute strength, Dean felt what could only be explained as one’s life flashing before their eyes.
But had he really liked men? Dean of course had but admitting it to himself was practically a sport. With Lee, John’s conditioning had convinced him it was a drunken mistake and nothing more. Then there were the countless men he had caught eyes with before. There was Nick, his siren which had made him feel all sorts of happy. He had always chalked it up to the siren’s call and needing a brother when Sam had disappointed him, but deep down Dean knew it was more than that. He had liked Nick, possibly more than a friend, after all, how many men had he ever shared a flask with?
Sam didn’t speak again until there was nothing left on the plate but a few crumbs and nothing left in the glass but a few drops. “Do you?”
On this day, however, Castiel wondered where Dean would be without him. Had he simply gone back to Heaven and not become too close to his charges, there was a chance that Dean would have been happy now. Castiel thought about Dean’s time with Lisa and wondered if he would have been happily married now if Castiel had just left when he was supposed to.
Castiel often wondered what would have happened had he done as he was told and returned to Heaven instead of helping avert the apocalypse and just faced the consequence of his disobedience. He often reasoned that had he done that, Jimmy would still be united with his wife, Claire would have been at peace and wouldn’t have been so lost in life, and there would have been thousands of angels still alive that had died at his hands.
“Never!” Sam squirmed as another round of laughter hit him when she found a particularly ticklish spot on his side.
The three chatted about nothing in particular as they waited for their lunches. They discussed Jack’s new duties in Heaven, his new favorite books, the games he wanted to play later when they got home, and the movie they might choose that night.
“For the last time, I’m comin'!” a grin played at his lips as he took a seat on top of the cooler on a rock next to Jack’s. “You think you can handle the bait yourself this time?”
Dean’s ears were ringing with the angel’s words and his heart was hammering in his chest. He didn’t think he would be able to handle one more emotional trainwreck that day, especially anything regarding his and Castiel’s relationship. He had not been able to get those three words to stop ringing in his ears for 36 days and he couldn’t handle addressing them at that moment. Not yet anyway.
The hunter stood nearly flush against his back and held each of Castiel’s forearms in an attempt to readjust them. Castiel tried desperately to focus on what Dean was saying, but the delicate touch and warmth coming off of him were intoxicating. It breached through Castiel’s coat and spread through his chest up to his cheeks, tinting them a faint pink.
Dean laughed at this point although there was no humor in his voice. Sam felt a shudder travel up his spine at the dark sound. Dean’s eyes had darkened too and Sam wasn’t exactly sure if he wanted to hear the rest of the story but he knew he didn’t want to shut Dean down, not when he was finally opening up.
Just like when Jack showed Castiel the future when he was only a baby in Kelly’s womb, Castiel’s eyes glowed a bright yellow as he watched the scene playing before him. His eyes flicked back and forth as if he were watching a movie.
Dean shook his head at the memory. His dad had made him feel weak and even useless then. He had never anticipated becoming a father himself but the one thing he did know was that he wanted to be nothing like his own.
As happy as he was over his small victory, Sam could not help the sadness that plagued his thoughts as he packed. He had thought that knowing what happened and getting closure would help, but now that he knew exactly what happened to Castiel, it was even worse. He knew that he had no right to feel so upset, after all, it wasn’t him who Castiel had confessed his unwavering love to, but he still felt guilty nonetheless.

His eyelids fluttered as he slept and Castiel smiled at the peaceful expression on the man’s face. He tugged the quilt around the man carefully and gently stroked his hair as he let Dean sleep.
“I know you feel responsible for me. I understand why too. I’ve had time to grieve and as weird as it is seeing my dad’s corpse talking to me, I do moderately enjoy spending time with you.” She teased as she spoke.
Dean began to feel tears welling and he let his gaze fall to the table again, hoping his hair falling over his eyes could shield them from Sam.
A stick was shoved in his hand when Dean led him to the empty table in the far corner of the room and he stared at it incredulously. It was heavier than he anticipated but not uncomfortable. Much like his angel blade, it was well balanced but he was unsure what to do with it exactly.
“I told you, Sam, you were supposed to call me, Remember?” Eileen asked with a hint of jest in her smile. This seemed to help Sam as the wrinkles in his forehead eased and he leaned back in his chair, no longer offensively on edge.
Dean looked back with no desire to do anything but sit there and wallow in his own self-pity, but instead, he tentatively picked up the fork and cut himself a small piece.
His gaze traveled to the pavement and Castiel recognized shyness on his face. Even under the shallow lighting and as embarrassed as he looked, his green eyes were nearly as bright as his wondrous soul. Castiel knew that the righteous man’s soul was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen and at that moment, his eyes came close to that light.
Castiel and Dean swiftly made their way to the makeshift bar setup and tried out nearly every snow cone flavor. From iced old fashioneds to pina colada cones, they each had more than their fair share of sugar and spiked. It was just enough to bring a healthy flush to Dean’s slightly burned cheeks but Castiel was able to use his grace to keep the man’s wits about him.
Dean got out of the car, slamming the door behind him. Eileen and Sam both jumped when they felt Dean slam the trunk closed after grabbing his duffel. They watched his figure grow smaller in the rearview mirror as he made his way towards the motel room.
“Yes, but first thing’s first. The angels and demons. Put them to sleep” the Shadow responded, slight hesitancy in its voice, as if skeptical that Jack would actually keep his word.
“Well buddy,” Dean pulled several bills from his wallet as he spoke, “consider it as good as yours.”
“Chuck’s Heaven is perfect. It’s almost too perfect. There is a place for every soul and every soul is in its place. It just doesn’t sit right with me. How can Heaven be paradise if all it offers is reliving one’s happiest memories over and over for all of eternity? Humans spend their whole lives preaching about paradise and praying for admittance so it feels like they deserve much more.
“He never should have come with me but the stupid bastard, he always does…..did. He always came with me and I never should have let him. She was just so angry. She followed us back into the bunker, pissed as all Hell. She started spouting off about how she wanted to fix everything wrong with the world, every rule ever broken, and that started with me. She wanted to kill me before she died from the wound I gave her.”
Dean reached into the tackle box and pulled out a cup of live bait from the gas station they stopped at on the way. Jack had of course insisted on getting a few snacks and drinks for their trip so Dean took the opportunity to pick out some better bait.
Castiel was sure he would wake everyone in the bunker but he could not bring himself to care. He was so tired. He was tired of the desperation. He was tired of the nightmares. He was tired of feeling helpless so he did all he was capable of and screamed into the shreds underneath him.
He of course had loved women. Dean adored women. They were beautiful and smart and made him feel good even for only one night but men, they had always been different. For some reason, Dean had always built far stronger relationships with men than anyone else he knew.
Dean sipped his soda while watching with a smile on his face. He could feel the tips of his ears warming at the sight. Castiel’s smile was so genuine and his eyes shone with an affection that was pure and raw. It reminded him of the way Castiel always looked at Jack.
Hey y’all. As you know, life has been moving too fast for me to even try to get caught up lately. Things have been kinda rough and unsteady but as luck would have it, I came down with an awesome cold a few days ago and my online presence/writing work has come to a hard stop. If you are waiting for a work from me, I wish I could give you a feasible estimate of when it will come out, but I do not have a good idea now and do not want to disappoint. If you would rather I offer fic recommendations or ask someone else to fulfill your request, I would be happy with either!
“I should be alright. Thank you very much for your assistance.” Castiel smiled as he turned to find Claire to pay and leave when he noticed a small display.
The two crammed into the booth once again and as they got situated, Dean paid for two more strips of photos, six more photos total, and threw his arm around the angel’s shoulders once again. He tapped away at the screen and stared nervously at his friend as the angel tucked his bee into his lap for the photo. The sight melted whatever willpower Dean had remaining and the man wished he could cement that image in his memory forever.
When he returned, Sam wrapped Dean in the dead guy robe, hoping to provide a little comfort for the grieving man. He was worried for his brother and wanted to do anything he could to convince him to open up.
He was a proud older brother, what could he say, and yet when he looked at their smiling faces and open body language, Dean couldn’t help but feel a tinge of sadness in his chest. He would never admit it was jealousy, after all, he was perfectly happy alone. Dean had always been a ladies' man by night and independent lone wolf by day. That was his m. o. Nothing needed to change. Why fix something that wasn’t broken?
Dean looked at the boy in confusion. He truly had no idea what Jack was talking about. Surely he had heard the man tell at least one of them that they were family before.
“I love you, Dean,” Castiel urged and reached for the man’s shoulder once again. “I may have been staring down the inevitable, but that does not change the sincerity of my confession. I meant every word I said. I love you and I am sorry if that has been too much burden for you to carry.”
I know this was a tad unexpected, but I just could not leave the story there. They had so much more to look forward to. I had always planned to have snippets of the future and I am so happy I was able to do so.
A faint tapping filled the room and he looked up to the door frame. Castiel was standing just outside with his fist raised.
“I know, but still. I just couldn’t let you go and it bugged the Hell outta me. If it were anyone else I woulda said it serves you right for getting us there in the first place but I just couldn’t blame you.
Jack and Eileen both leaned forward and Castiel leaned towards Dean too. They all pleaded and watched Dean as the musical break started coming to a close.
Claire beamed and dug through the ice for a bottle of beer. She cracked the seal and tipped back a few swigs before hissing at the cold and turning to glare at the man seated next to her.
At least in Heaven, he would finally be able to see the angel again. It might not be real, but fake is better than nothing. He could finally see that confused and smug face again and he would weep at his feet. Dean would be able to finally see that crooked smile and tilted head again and even if it was just a memory, it would be better than wasting his life on Earth with nothing but the crushing weight of his disappointments bearing down on his shoulders.
Jack beamed as Castiel entered the room close behind her. She nodded in Jack’s direction and left the room silently to give them some privacy.
Hello Lovelies! Two exams down, one to go! I just needed something to spice it up and make me smile. I sure hope this chapter lightens thing up a little since that last one was a bit of a pain train! Be sure to let me know what you think in the comments and let me know if there are any one shot ideas you want to see put to paper!
“Hey, you three.” Eileen interrupted Castiel’s thoughts as she sauntered up to the booth and slid in next to Sam.
Hello Lovelies! I am so excited to get this chapter to you as well as the upcoming ones! I also appreciate all your input regarding a possible name change for this work and I have decided that I will likely be keeping the title I already have. You can find me on tumblr at rowanspn if you would like to give your input or request a oneshot or themes for future chapters in this work!
“I know and I am sorry. You know there was no other way either of us was leaving that room but that doesn’t matter now. What does matter is your safety and health and if I am being honest, I don’t believe that I will be of any help to you. I can heal physical wounds momentarily, but there is nothing I can do to help the deeper wounds you carry with you, not unless you let me in.”
Dean watched as his brother nodded and attempted to calm the squirming infant. Under normal circumstances, he would have laughed at the sight but this time he simply pointed Sam to where the can of newborn formula was waiting on the counter with a bottle.
“I figured you would ask that,” he sighed while swapping his empty glass for a beer bottle. “And I still don’t have an answer.”
Then I sat in Purgatory and thought I’d never see you again. I realized just how much I had been missing when I pushed you out. You heard my prayer and I think you know just what it was that I had wanted to say. That’s why you stopped me, isn’t it?”
A small laugh escaped Castiel’s mouth as he thought about how far he had come. Just 12 years ago he was commanding Heavenly armies and fighting for the Lord’s mission and now he was picking up Dean’s dishes much like he picked up the little pieces as he attempted to make the man whole again.
If you have a request for a one shot topic, ship, or scenario, drop it in the comments of any of my works or reach out on my tumblr, rowanspn. My ask box is officially open so I will be checking there as well!
It was amazing how far he had come with his brother. Just a few short years ago they were thwarting apocalypses left and right out of dingy motel rooms but now, they were living in a fully functional bunker with every possible thing they could want. They always had cool air, hot showers, functioning sinks, and washing machines that didn’t take every quarter they had.
“I got it from you guys,” Jack answered thoughtfully. “You always find a way to work deals in your favor without breaking them. I figured it would be good to have some extra insurance in case the Shadow decided to try to break our deal.”
“Yeah, we’re doing our best. We’ve fought, talked, “hugged it out”, the works.” Dean said sarcastically as he swirled the can in his hand as if it were a scotch or fine wine.
Any old how, (any Gabe stans in the house???), No warnings for this chapter. Would love to hear what you think in the comments and on my tumblr, rowanspn.
Hello Lovelies! I really hope you are enjoying so far. Be sure to leave your thoughts in the comments down below!
“Then he said……..then he told me he loved me. I was too surprised to say anything and I couldn’t process it. There was too much going on. The literal death was pounding the door down, Cas was babbling on about how he sees me, and then out of nowhere, he was telling me he loves me. I just felt so hopeless.
Castiel watched as the man turned to walk towards the bar, his fingers grazing the trenchcoat as he walked away. He smiled and felt his cheeks warm once again when he watched Dean chat with a few men at the bar while waiting for the busy bartender to make her way over to him. He looked so happy and relaxed: it was a beautiful sight.
The silence was broken when Jack spoke. “Is something bothering you? You seemed worried when you came in.”
“Why are we here again?” the man grumbled as he snuggled into one of the pillows, sleep obviously still having a great hold on him.
“Why don’t you help me set these up in the library?” Eileen asked Alex as she held several trays of crackers and pretzels.
Castiel sat in silence until Dean’s footsteps completely faded out of earshot. Only then did Castiel let out a deep breath that he did not realize he was even holding. He furrowed his brow while contemplating the action. He reminded himself that he did not need to breathe, so the gesture was an odd one.
The group laughed as Alex made her way over to the kitchen to join Sam and Eileen in setting up food. They had picked all of Dean’s favorite foods plus some extras. Eileen had made several platters of different jerkies and cheeses while Sam cooked an unbelievable amount of burgers.
As Dean drove, he white-knuckled the wheel, offensively on edge the whole way, only letting go to replay the tape in the deck every hour or so. By the time the tape had finished for the fourth time that day, Sam couldn’t take it anymore and pulled it out of the deck before Dean could stop him.
Eileen nodded solemnly before getting out of the car and retrieving her duffel as well. Exhausted and not too pumped about leaving right away, she made her way to her room, ready to pack.
Eileen wanted nothing more than to feel his arms around her again as she slept, but he had just felt so distant since the fight, she knew he needed to find himself before they solidified their relationship. It hurt her to leave, but she knew it was what was best for him, even if he thought the opposite but none of that mattered now. They had a body count racking up quickly and she knew he was the only one that might be able to help.
The world didn’t need him in it. He just caused pain and suffering wherever he went and it wasn’t like he was contributing anything currently anyways. All he was doing actively was encouraging the local liquor sales. If he let go, it wasn’t like the world would actually miss him. Sam would, but he would get over it.
Dean sighed deeply as he circled the table and tapped at the wood grain. It was difficult to acknowledge that the body under that sheet belonged to the being that meant the most to him in the world besides his brother and he desperately wanted it to not be true.
Sam and Eileen hugged each other tightly as they looked at the two kneeling on the floor together. Eileen looked up at Sam and couldn’t stop herself from smiling. Sam was beaming and he leaned down and kissed her forehead.
When Eileen and Alex returned to the kitchen they found Castiel helping Sam with the burgers. It looked like he was absolutely clueless and was really there more for moral support than anything else.
“Yeah. We’re really lucky to have him. I just wish there was an easier way to talk to him about this stuff. I mean, raising a child is hard enough as it is. Raising a Nephilim though, that’s been really challenging. The only easy part was skipping the diapers stage.” Sam chuckled to himself as he wrapped an arm around Eileen’s waist and tossed a few bills on the table.
New chapters come every Tuesday and Thursday. Be sure to leave comments with recommendations and requests for future chapters!
Then you succumbed to the Mark and I had no idea how much of my Dean would be left inside. I could still see your soul, that beacon so bright it could be seen from Heaven when you were trapped in the depths of Hell. I could still see it straining against that Mark and it gave me hope. I knew that even if you would spend the rest of eternity lost to it, I would not let you live alone. I was ready to remain by your side forever to make sure you would not spend the remainder of all time in solitude.
Hello Lovelies! I am soooo happy to be back and I am dying to get these next few chapters out ASAP! Get ready for some angst and more comforting Sammy! These boys deserve the world!!! Be sure to leave your opinions in the comments and take a look at my new oneshot in my Baby Jack Series, Touched By An Angel!
When Dean slid into the front seat next to him, Castiel watched as Dean took the flower and placed it behind the angel’s ear. Its white petals perfectly contrasted the dark windswept hair and Castiel felt Dean’s fingers card through it before pulling their foreheads together again.
The trenchcoat made its way from Castiel’s shoulders to Dean’s. The angel then wrapped the quilt around the two of them as Castiel pulled Dean’s back to his chest. The man settled between Castiel’s knees and he felt Dean relax against him.
Sam joined his brother for the final verse and soon enough Jack, Castiel, and even Eileen did as well. The group laughed and sang through the final verse as Sam watched his brother’s overjoyed expression. He could get used to this. He could get used to his family being truly happy.
I absolutely loved writing this chapter and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! I am also loving reading all your comments on here as well as my tumblr! Let me know what you think!
Sam bucked underneath her and tried to flip her but Eileen had a strong hold on the headboard and had already squared her legs around his waist.
Sam looked longingly nowhere in particular as he remembered what Dean used to be like when they were young. He had been so vibrant and full of life once. He missed seeing that version of his older brother. Sometimes when Dean laughed, Sam caught a glimpse of the teenager that raised him: the teenager that would hustle pool, bare-knuckle fight, and play late-night games of poker all to collect enough money to help make ends meet for Sam.
Just as Castiel turned his face to the sky, the moon dipped behind the horizon and the sky began to lighten from the complete black to deep indigo. It was truly beautiful to look at from his position down on Earth. Very rarely had he appreciated the night sky before and even when he did, it had been full of falling angels.
Dean had not complained once the whole time Sam led him through the halls of the bunker, eventually setting him up with a barstool in front of the kitchen sink. He was just too tired to properly fight Sam off. He even let his little brother carefully inspect and clean his wounds although he did lightly grumble in protest. He couldn’t give Sam the satisfaction of completely bending to his will.
Dean reset his jaw and took aim. He hesitated and aimed once again, desperate to do his job. However, the innocence on the sleeping child’s face lowered the man’s weapon. He returned the safety of the pistol and dropped his arm to his side.
Hello Lovelies! I sure love some unlikely Dadstiel content, don't you? No warnings for this chapter but I am requesting your help! I am still in a bit of a writer's funk and I cannot come up with a coherent idea for a oneshot or new chaptered work to save my life! If you have any ideas, drop 'em in the comments or message me on my tumblr, rowanspn!
It took Sam a moment to understand but flipping the cassette between his fingers, the dots finally connected. He was talking about Castiel.
As he snarled the last of the words, an expression of pure confusion crossed over the vampire's face but it only lasted for a few seconds before Dean ruthlessly shoved the blade forward hard enough to lodge it into the support beam behind her as he sliced her head off.
Castiel felt his heart sink and he shifted to use his free hand to turn the man’s chin to face him. “I have never been more sure of anything in my life.”
This was all they had done together since that kiss even though he wanted more. Castiel wanted to spend his nights protecting Dean from the inevitable nightmares. He wanted to hold his hand in the front seat of the Impala on the way to a hunt or shopping trip. Mostly he just wanted to make sure Dean felt loved.
Castiel scoffed at the images and tried not to feel insulted at the misrepresentation. He had met cherubs before and they were not nearly like the images humans had concocted. He found it odd that humans found such importance in depicting such things and found solace in them.
The hunter laughed deeply and threw his arm around Castiel’s shoulder. “I love it. Thanks, Cas. That was really nice of you.”
Having said his piece, Sam just desperately hoped Castiel could hear his prayer. He rationalized that if Lucifer could hear Nick those years ago, maybe just maybe Castiel could hear him. It was too optimistic but he didn’t care.
When the countdown began, Dean leaned back and gripped his friend close so they could both fit in the frame. Anxiety crept through his chest at the gesture and urged him to turn to stare at his friend’s profile. He looked into Castiel’s eyes and smiled at the grin he received in return. Their absorbed attention on only the other’s smile caused them not to notice when the countdown ended until the first flash went off and surprised them both.
“I’m the new God so I’m the one that’s going to be making requests and I suggest you cooperate.” Jack hoped his anxiety was not evident. If there was one thing Dean taught him, it was the importance of confidence.
“For you,” he said as a shallow flush reached his cheeks and he worried at his lower lip with his teeth.
Dean threw his arms over Castiel’s shoulders once again, pulling him tightly into his embrace. His face found refuge in the crook of Castiel’s neck as he attempted to suppress the tears he could feel coming yet again.
“Cas, you know you can talk to us right? I know coming back from the dead is hard and it’s bizarre that we all have personal experience with that, but if you ever need anything, we’re here for you.”
His hand never left Eileen as he pulled her along towards Jack who was standing in the middle of the blast zone and panting heavily. Sam kicked at the pile of ash and stared at Jack with concern.
No matter which way one looked, there were smiles everywhere but there was one frame, in particular, that was different from the rest. This one, a silver frame with an engraving on the side, sat on a bedside table out of the public eye. This one sat next to a shared bed in a shared bedroom and held three strips of photos as its engraving welcomed love into the eyes of anyone who read it:
Hello Lovelies! Slightly longer chapter this time but I mean, who doesn't love some good ol' angst? I sure know I do! I have been absolutely antsy to get this one out for weeks! Be sure to let me know what you think in the comments here or on my tumblr, rowanspn. I absolutely love hearing from you guys!
“I am not dying when I haven't even lived!” Dean growled while jamming a syringe into the vampire's neck.
“And you are correct. I have watched thousands of sunrises in my lifetime. I have watched the sun rise over bloodied battlefields as I counted the days of war. I have watched the sun rise as I wandered the Earth and Heavens, desperately alone. I watched the sun return to the sky when Amara and Chuck came to their agreement and I believed you to be dead.”
Castiel grinned and immediately picked up the frame for further inspection. “I’m sure we can find the perfect photo to put in it. What do you think?”
It wasn’t enough, however. Tearing into the pillows and sheets relieved some of the tension, but he was far too high-strung for that to satisfy his anger. Nothing inside the bunker could appease his rage so he left without a word to anyone inside.
“Well, much like cooking, I have observed humanity long enough to gather an understanding of how this is done.”
Claire looked up at Castiel as they entered the building and he stood eyes wide like a deer caught in the headlights.
The angel nodded and the corners of his mouth raised as his wings opened to silhouette the white space behind him. In that instant, Castiel felt like he had so many years before he fell from grace as he returned to his former glory as commander of Heaven’s greatest warriors.
He hoped to hear that Castiel had somehow managed to escape again, but he knew the answer he was bound to get. He would have felt Castiel’s presence if he was in Heaven, Hell, or anywhere in between.
“Never.” The angel’s voice came smooth and sweet as honey as he gently stroked Dean’s cheekbone with his thumb.
“It is my fault!” Dean snapped, voice slowly rising and becoming more frantic with each word. “He followed me because of my stupid suicidal plan to confront Billie and I got us trapped. I got him dead. Just like last time. He sacrificed himself to save us last time and yet again I got him killed.” Dean suddenly stopped and took a moment before choosing his next words carefully. “It’s always my fault.”
“Oh well. What can you do?” Rowena took a long swig from her glass before turning back to Dean. “Well, I sense you two have taken my advice and have fixed what happened between the two of you?”
Dean eagerly made his way down the dirt path through the dense part of the forest before entering the hidden clearing. He smiled when he noticed that Jack had already begun scaling down the rocks and fallen branches to the bubbling water. The boy found a flat rock next to the creek and sat down cross-legged before looking over his shoulder.
Anywho... I am so excited for this and the next chapter but I do have to put a bit of a warning in. This chapter is a tad long and the next one is the length of two chapters put together. With that length comes some angst and triggering topics for some people. This chapter includes references to childhood neglect, domestic abuse, and just John Winchester being a terrible dad in general. Please be warned of topics surrounding that are a concern for your mental health.
“Too bad! We need to talk about this! What the hell is going on with you? We can’t just pretend what happened back there didn’t Dean! I heard everything you said. I don’t know where that anger is coming from but you are starting to scare me. Not to mention that last thing…”
He landed on top of her, hurling his fist into her face. Dean punched her over and over again, breaking her nose in the process. His anger was dangerously boiling over and it was lethal.
“I’m fine Cas. One drink isn’t going to kill me. Plus, you just came back from the dead. You are more than deserving of one.”
“Aw, Cas. You shouldn’t have.” Dean teased as he winked at the angel. “Seriously though, you didn’t need to do that. Most of us don’t and besides, you already gave me a gift.”
“Yeah, Jack. I think so. Now you go over to the counter and pick whatever ice cream you want okay?” Sam sighed as he gave the command, hoping that Jack understood how sensitive the topic was that he was asking about.
Jack dropped another chip making three in a row. “I believe so. I think it is a metaphor. Sam has been teaching me about metaphors lately and it seems this one is a metaphor for doing everything you can for someone you love after letting them down. It’s very interesting.”
Hello Lovelies! New day, new chapter. Whole lotta angst in this one along with some brotherly love. This one's got lots of references to 15x18 so spoiler alert I guess!
Dean’s response was surprisingly calm. “It’s fine. Just don’t go missing like that again. We were worried sick. What if something happened to you and we didn’t know where you were?”
Castiel scanned the table and set himself again, this time missing the ball he was aiming for entirely. The disappointment disappeared quickly as he heard Dean laugh.
Castiel was drawn from his thoughts as Dean shivered next to him. He laughed and removed the quilt from Dean’s shoulders. The man immediately began to protest but Castiel pressed a finger to his lips to hush him.
“Get away from me!” Castiel screamed, reeling backward in fear. As he skittered across the floor hysterically on his hands and heels, Castiel grabbed his angel blade and waved it around threateningly. “You’re not real!”
He had to suppress his laugh as Castiel stared at the screen in the photo booth and Dean tapped away at his options. He worried at his bottom lip as he fed the machine while hoping upon hope that he was not misinterpreting the atmosphere between him and the angel at his side. After all, had Castiel not just poured his heart out to Dean?
He watched as Jack finished up reloading and considered the question. “Things seem to be reasonably in order. I have plenty of angels and Castiel has been training them since I asked him to be their new commander.”
The initial impact was painful but he appreciated the sting. Castiel did not even try to land as gracefully as he normally did. He simply hurled himself into the earth and let his wings break his fall. He wanted to feel something, anything other than the complete helplessness he had developed over the last few months.
“Oh he’s in here somewhere honey” the Shadow sneered, gesturing wildly around the vast expanse of nothing surrounding the two, manifesting itself in its new favorite look: Meg. “He’s sleeping peacefully, rocked gently by dreams of his greatest regrets”.
He sank to his knees and knelt in the damaged dirt. Castiel stared into the clear sky and begged for answers. He begged to know why his family could never get a break. Why couldn’t Dean be happy? Why did Jack have to take on so much responsibility? Why couldn’t Sam and Eileen be happy together without worrying for their family? Why couldn’t he just be an angel that wasn’t completely and irreversibly damaged?
If Dean ever was unsure of his fondness for the angel, it was these moments that reminded him why Castiel meant so much to him. In those moments, Dean could see not the outer shell of a man, but the angel kept inside: the angel experiencing humanity for the first time through Dean. He was the creature that could crush worlds in the palm of his hand, yet was so fragile that he had no idea how a camera flash worked so it surprised him and that made Dean grateful he was able to see it as it happened.
“Dean. He’s terrified. Let me do this. He can’t hurt me.” Jack tried to heal Dean's nose, but he shoved the boy’s hand away. After a few seconds of deep thought, he surrendered and sat back down. Jack slowly approached Castiel, hands up in an attempt to appear nonthreatening.
Dean’s hand found his back and rubbed a gentle circle as he spoke. “Don’t worry about it Cas. It took me years to master. Why don’t I get us a couple drinks huh?”
Dean stared into Castiel’s eyes only a few inches away silently and prayed with all his might he wouldn’t be forced to make the next move. He did not think he had the strength to close those final breaths between them. Even if he did, Dean was far too nervous of the outcome to do it himself.
Alex, Claire, and Kaia finished hanging the last few decorations from the bookcases while bickering about nothing valuable. Patience sat and watched pensively as she talked to Jody and Donna around one of the tables.
