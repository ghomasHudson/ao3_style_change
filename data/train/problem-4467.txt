The drive is silent, short of the music spilling from the stereo. Dean doesn’t comment on the side glances Cas throws at him and Cas, mercifully, doesn’t comment on the way Dean’s knuckles white out with his grip on the wheel.
Dean glared at him for a good ten seconds before dropping the Impala's key into his hand, "Not a scratch."
"I can't hold on, Sammy," Dean mumbles, breath rattling in his chest. "He's got better things to do, I'm just a bump in the road."
Their lips pull apart, their hearts don't. Dean doesn't want to open his eyes, not as long as his hand rests against Castiel's beating heart and the other man's stays pressed to the curve of his shoulder. Dean wants to wrap himself up in that feeling until all the loose ends of the storm on his chest binds down.
“It’s been three months, Benny,” Dean says, feeling kinda glad he spoke to Benny about Castiel. “I want him to be back but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen. Maybe I should start looking for something new.”
Dean knocked on the door, bracing for whatever reaction was on its way. Nine out of ten times it was teary eyed dismissals, only rarely people let them come in. Which was why he was surprised when a woman in her late twenties opened the door, smiling softly at them.
“That I do,” Dean leaned over to pop the movie into the disc and got off the floor, flopping down on one end of the couch. Cas followed suit, lowering himself to the other end and stuck his socked feet into the space between the backrest and the cushion, his knees bent weirdly. Ah, fuck it.
Cas laughs harder at that, turning to catch his gaze, "Dean, she's not who I want."
Dean shakes his head, “I don’t think that would do anyone any good. Besides, we gotta get Sammy out.”
“Gotta thank you for that.”
“What did you find?” Castiel asks.
“I assume you know the way to the vault?” Camael asks.
Dean throws a sock at Castiel. “Smartass,” he mutters, though the words carry no heat.
Dean balks, a sense of
Cas' lips curl into a smile, "Always."
“Well, who would’ve known heaven runs on the principle of absent fathers,” Dean laughs dryly, “Cas, can I ask you something?”
“Oh, I know ways to get him to be loud,” Dean waggled his eyebrows at Claudia and Henry, letting go of Cas’s hand to wrap it around his waist.
“Talking about a guy behind his back and one’d think you’d have the basic decency to whisper,” Dean said from the other end of the room, awake and grinning wide for someone who was in grave danger. “Mornin’ sunshine. And Sam.”
"You like me?"
"I've lost way too much," his voice comes out in a shaky whisper. "Dunno if I'll be able to take it if I lose one more person I care about."
"Are you singing, Dean?"
Eventually they hung up and Dean tossed his phone on the coffee table and looked up at Castiel. "Sorry, they can be a little too enthusiastic."
"You're telling me," Dean swallows with a click, "you're really an…"
“Neither was his,” Cas pulls away from his touch, walking over to the angel’s vessel and kneeling down next to it.
"How was your first day, boss? He asked.
One of the characters from the movie screeches and Dean and Cas both jump' mirroring each others' expressions of realization that they haven't been watching the movie for a while now. The rest of the movie goes by as they sit next to each other in silence, a strange sense of warmth—delicate strands of golden swimming into the empty spaces—engulfing them.
"For fucks sake," Ruby mutters, "Get your gooey eye sex out of my face."
A finger hooked under his chin to guide his face up. Cas’s eyes were blue as ever, something warm and reassuring dancing behind them. “I love you too, Dean.”
Yet, the first time he watched Dean bleed, the world stuttered on its axis.
"With fries?" Cas asked hopefully.
"Where'd you come from?"
Dean rubbed a hand over his face, the realization hitting him hard. Cas was human now. He probably felt fragile, and inadvertently felt Dean was just as fragile, which wasn’t too far off. Okay great, now he felt like a bigger asshole.
The war finally ends and the gates are sealed. Threat dismantled and everyone's safe. It's time for Castiel to go home. He should be elated at the prospect, finally getting to see the one person who served as his driving force; his motivation. Yet, he finds himself pacing the stagnant white floors of heaven, experiencing an emotion he now knows is fear.
The coffin lid is pulled shut and Sam Winchester lowers his brother to the ground, silence filling the deserted forest. The last grain of sand evens out on the floor of the clearing and Castiel returns back to heaven, prepared to embark upon his mission.
“You can go to bed if you want to,” Cas says, and Dean’s too far gone, he barely catches it.
“There’s no way she can spy on us while we’re here,” Dean muttered, seemingly disturbed by the thought.
"Holy fuck, that's awesome Cas." Dean's face broke into a grin. "This is fucking huge."
“God, no.” Dean grumbles, “Just stay wherever the fuck you are. You drive me insane.”
So much for a relaxing week.
He tries not to shudder at the memory of what happened the last time he was here. At that time, it was kind of surreal, watching the light die out of Alastair's grimy eyes. If it wasn't for Cas, Dean would've ended up dead or worse.
“How is my dead daughter relevant to this?” She snaps.
Dean's usually not the one to pose to assert dominance but the guy is clearly fangirling over Cas. Besides, Cas is a couple billion light years out of his league and Dean can't help but play a little alpha male.
"Is that Cas there?" A man's voice called from the other end of the line.
from the way you’re dressed,” Cas comments.
“Good,” Dean tried for a laugh but it felt flat. “Cause if you do, I’m gonna drag you back kicking and screaming.”
“Hey, Cam,” he calls. “Did you happen to see anyone around here on your way?”
"Having fun ordering people around, aren't you?" Nemiah huffs a laugh, turning on her heels and marching off with a wide eyed Sariel on her tow.
“I’m twenty three, Cas. I should be knowing what my
“Sometimes, it simply doesn’t work out, Sam,” Cas sighs, feigning a resigned sigh.
"It's a girl," Eileen mouths when she spots them. She raises the baby to him and Dean has his hands out before he can even process everything that's going on.
"Ma'am, we would like to ask some questions about your husband," Dean began.
He hops off the truck murmuring a thanks to the driver, and slumps down against the concrete sidewalk, feeling a little at ease. The streets are empty and the autumn wind is slow and warm. He closed his eyes again for a second only to snap them open as flashes of darkness and fire fill his mind.
"Man, it's the best feeling ever," Dean grinned. "Pushing down on the accelerator until all you can feel is the wind in your face and music down to your toes. Fucking life changing."
Castiel could feel the familiar slide of tension off Dean's shoulders as they melted into the kiss. Dean had been a little on the edge for a few days, as though he was waiting for something to happen, and Castiel reassured himself thinking it was just because of the wedding. Then again, Dean was more physical and affectionate than usual ㅡ not that he was complaining ㅡ so Castiel just let it slide.
The crime scene is swarmed by local police officers as well as the neighbors gathering around the house, pajama bottoms peeking out of the folds of their robes. They all look as distressed as someone who got woken up on a Sunday morning by a murder happening next door would look. Cas pulls up next to the opposite sidewalk, catching the attention of a few neighbors he and Dean had visited earlier, while pretending to be a couple.
“Wings, halo, the whole deal,” Dean chuckled, apparently amused.
Dean watched as Cas crossed the threshold of his house, disappearing behind the door. He sighed happily and pulled out of the driveway, his fingers itching to grab his phone and call Cas right then.
“I’m sure you boys have nothing to worry about,” Claudia waved her hand dismissively, her eyes slipping over to Cas. “You’re the quiet one, aren’t you?”
“Keep the flirting for later, after we catch this thing,” she said, and added, “Before you argue, this is my case so yes I’m helping.”
“Email? Really?” Dean frowned. “I thought she’d send an owl or something.”
“You’ve got the other team to play with, let us have this,” Gordon says, and Dean appreciates his effort at trying not to say a slur.
“Take your top three and leave the rest.”
"Yes, Dean."
"Yeah, we… we can do that. That'd be nice," Dean fumbles with his words, snapping his mouth shut before he can spit out anymore nonsense.
Dean nodded with a smile, “What about the apocalypse?”
Dean rubs a hand over his mouth, "I don't know what to do."
“You’re talking as if I asked you to give up your fucking grace!”
“Sure. Want my gun too?” Dean mocked. “So what? You and Terra fell in love and decided to get rid of the hubby? Was it a group effort or did Terra choose to be the bench warmer?”
“Nothing,” Sam shrugged, as if Dean was going to buy that load of crap. “Don’t you think you’re smothering him a little?”
The stranger's scowl deepens, "I have not consumed anything at all."
Dean grinned widely, heading towards the Impala, dragging Cas right behind him.
“Alright, drama queen, it’s not that-”
“I’m listening,” Cas says, and sits up a little straighter to drive the point home.
Maybe this was what qualified as love, but the labels didn't matter.
"We understand, Cas," Nemiah pats him on the back. "And, we're glad you're here."
“It’s fashion, grandpa. You wouldn't know,” Ivan pats him on the back on his way out, and Castiel once again regrets not catching up with the youth.
“What the hell does that mean?”
The split second of happiness from finding a solution to Castiel's problems disappear as he realizes that yes, Cas is human now, but that doesn't mean Cas wants to stay that way. Sure, he sounded like all the military ruling in heaven isn't what Cas wanted, but that doesn't mean stooping low enough to be a human, definitely not from the example Dean is setting him.
“What explanation are you planning to give in your report?”
Dean lifted his head, glaring at Sam, "If you finish that sentence so help me God, I'll start making out with him right here," and that was enough to placate Sam.
"You want to do all that?"
“Weirdo,” Dean mutters, amusement lacing his tone. “Where’d you find this car, by the way?”
"Highly complicated in terms of the spell as well as the ingredients," Cas said, and added, barely audible, "everything except my grace."
"Dean, kiss me, please." Cas pants, eyes closed and head lulled back against the foggy window.
The slashes were not deep but they were long, and by the time he was done healing them, Castiel found himself staggering only for a pair of arms to catch him.
So sorry for the delay in updating. Time is just a construct at this point.
Castiel considers his words, "I think I have made my choice, Michael."
“It’s okay,” Cas said gently, letting go of his hands. Dean barely bit back a whine at the loss of the touch. “You’re going to take some time to get used to the absence of the Mark. Give yourself time,” he said.
He doesn’t say anything though, just cups Cas’s face in his hands, feeling the delicious scratch of his stubble against his palm—because Cas knows best. Cas moans sweetly and Dean swallows up those sounds, hands trembling and chest filled up to the brim with the sensation of Cas everywhere around him.
Cas goes on to explain the different weapons and Dean contemplates going back and laying down on the bed as he feels his eyelids heavyㅡhe doesn’t even remember the last time he sleptㅡbut Cas is right there, so instead Dean wraps his hand around Cas’ waist and rests his chin on his shoulder. He talks about the Lance of Olyndicus, something called a
Dean snickered, “No jacking off on Tuesdays?”
When Claire Novak looked at him, searching for her father, Castiel had a definite answer for her, yet he did not understand the sadness emitting from her soul. James Novak was chosen as his vessel, and the child did not find any significance in that. The love and sense of belonging exhibited by humans are deeply confounding.
“The chick from the morgue,” Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, turning to look at Cas. “I told you there was something off about her.”
“And I stand by my statement,” Cas countered. “But, just in case.”
“Yes,” Castiel says, mirroring Dean’s smile, finally able to give him some good news. “Come on, let’s talk in our tent. You had a long day.”
Cas stopped him with a hand on his elbow, “Dean, what is going on?”
“Looking at the tissue damage, it wasn’t a quick job,” Dr. Robinson says. “The victim must have gone through intense pain before cerebral ischemia.”
“I swear to God it’s real,” he grinned. “I literally live there.”
“Where are we?”
“Shh, relax.” Dean whispered, a hand coming around to wrap around his cock, pumping slow strokes, which resulted in anything but relaxation. Castiel’s head was swimming in the euphoria of Dean’s touch but he willed his muscles to relax.
"It is a theory, yes."
“Right,” Sam sighs, pushing his hair back behind his ears. “That’s a five hour drive from here. So, we go and talk to Robin’s husband.”
“That’s really beautiful.” Dean pointed at the art.
******
Dean tsks, "Come on, Joanna. Tell me."
“You’ve really got Castiel wrapped around your fingers.” Nemiah comments. “What is it about you?”
There is a third explanation bouncing around in Dean’s head like a ping pong ball on crack but he’ll die,
Dean himself is not sure where he's going with this but he trusts Cas to figure it out 'cause Cas always has his back. He clenches his fist at his sides and stares down at his lap, focusing on getting air in and out of his lungs.
“Another minute and we would’ve been barbecue,” Jaime exhales, a hand pressed to her chest as she leans against the sturdy trunk of a tree.
"What the hell is that now?"
Dean whipped his head back to face Cas, “You did that?”
line."
"I tripped, he caught me from falling on my ass," he answers.
The bathroom knob turned and Castiel stilled, not pulling away since he didn't want to give Dean the impression that he would ever let Dean go. It might take another lifetime for the hunter to believe it, but Castiel was willing to try. He waited for Dean to pull away but, to his utter surprise, Dean stayed where he was. Castiel looked down to notice his eyes were closed, but the furrow in his brows and the stiffness in his shoulders indicated he was still awake.
“Are we ready to go yet?”
Castiel taps into his grace and manifests his middle pair of wings that emerge from his shoulder bones, and he feels Dean's hands grope around his feathers, just as an array of conflicting emotions from confusion to disbelief flicker across the hunter's face.
“I’m glad we cleared that up.”
Castiel doesn’t have a valid explanation to give to Dean. He was heaven’s, as Dean would put it, ‘little bitch’, this whole time. His orders were to not interfere, so he kept quiet. Perhaps, interfering was a mistake. He should not be here, this is not his place.
Dean opened his mouth to say something but Hillary interrupted, “Awh, you boys are adorable. Reminds me of when Ben and I met.” And with that, they launch into the story.
“Yes,” he mutters. “It’s a very long story.”
"The idea of even pretending to marry me makes him appalled," Cas huffed, watching Dean pace back and forth the small space between the beds. As soon as the words left his mouth, he felt the color creeping up his face.
"Not now, Cas." Dean cut him off. Castiel dropped the subject, not wanting to make him more miserable that he already was.
“Dean-”
“I’m fine.”
“I understand,” Cas nods empathetically. “Thank you.”
“What’s in the chest?” Dean asks, somehow already knowing the answer.
him. If he were a bit more drunk, Dean would think Cas is looking right through him at someone better. Someone worthy of everything Cas is offering.
Seconds trickled by but Castiel couldn’t care less. If for Dean, he was ready to wait for eternity. But to their dismay, the universe had different plans. Even as his gaze remained glued to Dean, through the corner of his eyes, he saw the exit door swing open and a silhouette wedging past them into the darkness, followed by a blood curdling scream that echoed through the air.
"Sorry," Dean finds himself saying, snatching his eyes away from Castiel's steady gaze. "You don't gotta explain shit to me."
Castiel stares at the shriveled heart in his palm, wondering what made the spirit want to hurt the victim in this way. Often, the method of killing holds a story, especially in the case of spirits. He sighs, grabbing the box to pack the organ back in, but a voice in the hallway catches his attention.
"I'm sorry, Dean," Castiel finds himself saying. "Raphael wants me and that's why both you and Sam got entangled in this mess."
“Go on,” Castiel takes a step back, letting Dean go for the handle.
Cas laughs softly, "Neither do I," he says. "I'm overwhelmed with the way I feel about you, and a huge part of it is way beyond my understanding…"
Castiel grabbed the pepper, leaning on the counter next to Dean. "How did you learn to cook?"
“Fuck, you’re so hot.” Dean panted against his chest, breath coming out in small huffs as he licked and sucked on Castiel’s neck. “I want you so much.”
His words die out as giant limbs pull him into a hug.
"Rose needs to stand a little farther from the railing if she does not wish to die," Cas says suddenly, startling Dean.
“I’m not that stupid, Winchester,” she whacked him lightly on his arm. “I’ll probably call you more times than you’d expect.”
Dean wants Cas—wants Cas to want him—and it doesn’t end there. Hand him a shopping bag and call him the line in front of Walmart on a Black Friday because,
"Cas," Dean breathes, holding his hand out, only hoping Cas would take it. Cas does. Of course he does. "Cas, I'm so fucking sorry…"
"Very well." Cas pushes his chair back, standing on his feet. "That was all I had left to give."
"Dork,” Dean rolled his eyes, “Come on, let’s go find Jess.”
"Talk to me," Dean said, and added, "so I don't fall asleep."
“I haven’t stabbed my boss yet,” Jaime flops down on the couch. “I don’t feel like that’s what I should be doing, Cas."
"Terra and Louisa are a thing," Dean explained.
"Not a hermit, Benny. Just busy."
"Who told you that?" Dean raises a brow, holding back a smile when Cas ducks his head. "You're plenty good, Cas, don't worry about it. Now go sit on the kitchen counter, it's the one place in this cabin I'm sure won't fall apart."
"I'm fine too." Cas chides in.
Dean blinks at his brother, having no clue what he's hinting at.
Beside him, Gabriel leaned back on his chair. "What a drag."
The silence that falls in the car takes all the air in the world with it, leaving Dean's chest feeling tight. He taps his fingers against the steering wheel.
Cas is right, as always, and Dean knows this too. He knows what he’s doing to himself—to others around him, but
"Barely more than a week and you're head over heels for those humans?" Zachariah says, like being human is the worst possible fate one can have. "You serve heaven, Castiel. Not those pesky little Winchester.’
“Unbelievable,” Ivan shakes his head, pressing his mouth into a thin line.
Cas' eyes reflect a deep sadness that Dean never wants to see in that gaze, "Don't do this to me, Dean, " he chokes out, "
"Shit, Cas. So tight." Dean panted, face flush. "So good for me."
“You’re lucky I love you,” he mumbles, pressing another kiss to Cas' temple, and slides out of bed. "I'm gonna clean up the attic, some of the German guy's crap is still up there. Might find a thing or two we could use."
"Cas?" Sam gapes, altering between wanting to lower his gun and shoot something at the same time. "Is it really you?"
When she had shown up in North Carolina with a sanctioned extended leave application in her hand four days after they had wrapped up the case in Illinois, Sam was a bit confused and mildly alarmed, but over all of it, he was fucking glad. He didn’t know where or how they went from here, but for now, Sam wasn’t going to question it.
Those words, they’re twisted into a coil, and Dean knows there are lines to be read in between. It’s not like he expected Cas to just swallow his apology dry and become one big happy family just like that. There is always something broken and Dean doesn’t have a single goddamn clue how to fix it. He doesn’t even know if anything’s left to be fixed, because that’s what he always does. He breaks things and stomps on the broken parts all over again until it’s too shattered to be put back together.
Days go by without any visits from Castiel. They hunt and research, working around the house in relative silence. Bobby makes calls and assigns cases, Sam spends his free time drowning among stacks of lore, finding no heads or tails for everything that’s going on. Dean, meanwhile, does what he’s best at, hunting. Days are a blur of blood and guts from whatever monster they hunt while nights are blurry from drinking. Nightmares are a bitch, and Dean’s not four anymore. There’s no mommy he can run to when he’s scared. There’s no one.
Anyways, hope you enjoy!
He drops to his knees near the six tails that splay on the muddy ground, plaintive and unmoving at the brush of his fingers.
Dean's heart hammers in his chest. "Then?"
"And, you want a medal for that?"
“Castiel, I kid you not,” Dean fixes him with a glare, “fly your ass away right now and this will be the last time you see me.” He says, not knowing how much those words mean to Castiel. He doesn't even get time to understand how Dean knew he was about to leave before Dean is shouting again.
“Yeah, I need a head shrink. News flash,” Dean mutters, trying to distract himself from Cas’s death grip around his wrists. He wonders how it would feel when Cas’s hands hold his wrists just like this and pin him to the bed while he— nope. Not gonna take that route.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “I assume you met Meg.” He said. “I don’t hate parties. I moved here a month ago from Greece and am only adjusting to Chicago’s life of the party.”
to hide than nowhere," Castiel recalled. "It said the decision was not something he could spend time debating over. It was a choice of survival."
"Ring shopping." said Sam, as though it's what they did every Saturday morning.
Sam's lips twitched up into a smile, warmth creeping up his chest watching the concern and genuine curiosity in Nadia's expression.
They each grabbed a beer and settled down on stools facing each other. Nadia was looking gorgeous as ever—the pale yellow glow of the hanging lights in the tent highlighting her sharp features. She caught him watching and smiled, a sliver of which he caught right before he ducked his head to hide the color in his cheeks.
Just as Castiel's hands curl around Dean's waist protectively, his grace rushes forward to soothe the way his soul aches, even though the angels around him could see — to strengthen his point, Nemiah lets out a gagging noise. In angelic terms, a soul and angelic grace interacting is much more of an intimate act than humans perceive it to be. Though, Castiel cannot help it when Dean is in agony.
"You're starting to sound like the shrink I never had," Dean chuckles. "I've put him in my past, Cas. At least I try to. It ain't easy when I don't even know if that fucker is alive or not. All I've ever gotten from him is an email that I still can't bring myself to open."
He wants to. And that’s a bitch of a enlightenment to have.
"Dean?" Cas calls, a pinch between his brows. It's only then he realizes that he was staring this whole time. Dean ducks his head and pulls his laptop closer.
"And sent a soul away with unsettled grievances." Cas deadpans.
"Cas, you wanna tell-" Sam stops mid sentence, probably registering the absence of the person he's talking to. "Where's Cas?"
"I don't like him," Dean mutters.
As much as he likes to play dumb, Dean is not a completely oblivious idiot. He has noticed that Cas is easy on the eyes, and he isn’t the first guy Dean has looked at that way. For an embarrassingly long while, Dean had thought it was just something every other guy felt. But as time went on, Dean’s mind took it upon itself to explore these feelings, to think what it might feel like to touch and be touched—to run his hands over the hard plain of muscles instead of the soft curves and have rough and calloused hands run over his own skin. Every time it happened, Dean did what he always did. He went out to a bar and found a chick to hook up with. And every time, he walked back to the bunker in shame from not even remembering her name.
Dean smirks, "Took you long enough."
"Is that what you think of me?" Cas asks, taking a step closer to Dean. "You believe I consider myself above you?"
Castiel closed his eyes, trying to quench down the burn behind his temples. He knew every inch of Dean’s body and soul, every little memory. He had rebuilt Dean from the atom after all. He’d seen the scars on his soul, and knows the memory each one is associated with. Even with his feeble human mind, Castiel still remembers all of Dean, the hurt and the beauty.
Sam snorted and Nadia stifled a laugh into a cough, earning a hard glare from Dean aimed both their ways.
"Faster, baby." Dean moans, the need to have his brain fucked out like fire under his skin. "S' all you got?"
The door swings open and Castiel lets out a sigh of relief, and Dean steps inside, his eyes fixed on the figure hunched over the desk in Bobby Singer’s living room.
See you next week !
——————
Despite his terrible math skills, it doesn't take him long to put the two and two together.
The collection was huge and Dean's eyes raked over the hundreds of displays, sapphires to diamonds to antique stones that would probably cost his entire fortune and fifty more bucks. He spotted a silver band with tiny emeralds lined around it, and his first thought was how it would look really nice against Cas' tanned skin. His heart backpedaled faster than the Tour de France pelotons at the idea, making him shudder a little.
"  Dean smacks him on the shoulder. "I'll just let you sit there and squirm this time."
Castiel watches as Dean interrogates Theodore Steller’s widow, carefully observing the way Dean speaks to her with gentle words and a kind expression. Dean is getting impatient, Castiel realizes, from the way he taps his finger rhythmically against his knees.
"You say that like you are an angel watching over from the sky." Dean hissed. "Why are there potholes in the goddamn clouds?"
He mouths down Cas' jaw, the soft skin like heaven against his lips. He feels fingers thread into his hair, tugging sharply, making Dean whine from the pleasant edge of pain. Their clothes hit the floor one by one and soon he's sprawled on his stomach, Cas stroking his thighs. Dean spreads his legs, chasing the endgame.
The newlyweds kissed and the crowd broke into applause, as they walked down the aisle, hand in hand, followed by the rest of the congregation. Soon enough, the dreaded photo session — the sequel: this time it was personal — commenced. Dean smiled cheesily for the photos, dying inside every passing second. If the photographer had said 'let me see those smiles' one more time, Dean would have put his head through a wall.
Cas grins looking over Dean's shoulder, "I would never do that to her."
“About that,” Dean takes a pull from his beer, “Where were you?”
So, fun story. I started writing this fic and got so engrossed in the plot that by the time I had about ten chapters plotted out, I literally forgot this was a destiel fic. I went through my draft and was like "...wait a minute, where's the romance?" Why am I like this?
Hello children.
“I wonder what Honey must be doing?”
“Jesus, Cas, I’m kidding,” Dean breathes out between fits of laughter. “Maple syrup gets all sticky and I just took a shower.”
They wash and dry the dishes standing side by side, yet it feels as though they’re a whole world apart.
"And what family do you think you're from?"
The first of his four alarms blare into the empty silence of the motel room and Castiel groans into his pillow, reaching out blindly and slapping his hand on the bedside table until the sound dies down. Maybe it is his paranoid nature or simply his cautiousness, but Cas always keeps multiple alarms within five minute intervals. It’s not like he has an agenda printed out and waiting to be followed, but once he is on his feet, Cas has not much choice other than to push through the rest of his day.
Michael laughs, eyes twinkling with amusement, “Perhaps God does work in mysterious ways.”
“Take him back to the camp.” Castiel replies.
“We should get you to the toilet,” Cas says, and yeah. Nothing like ugly puking and dry heaving noises to serenade such heartfelt words.
“Ain’t no skin off my teeth,” he mumbles. “At least you were saving lives instead of deciding to turn your back on the life and shack up with a wife and two kids.”
Dean gives a watery laugh, “You can stare all you want, Cas. I don’t mind.”
“Guess I’m never going to hear the end of- what’s wrong, Dean?”
“Props to him for being a good sport,” Dean’s voice came out in a breathy sigh. “So what was the point of the story?”
They head over to their tent, which is more of a cozy hipster themed campsite tent with white sheets hanging around mats and beanbags and a bed at the center with a metric fucktonne of pillows. Candles lit the room up with a pale yellow glow, shadows dancing around in slow waves on the sheets.
"Cas, can you hold him down. I think he has a concussion."
“I want to,” Cas countered. “I didn’t know it was
“Yeah yeah.”
He lets his mind wander, the destination somehow being Cas. Dean can't comprehend how weird and uneasy it must feel—from being an
"Just a cut, I'll be alright," Dean says, smiling up at Cas, only to have that smile fade away at the look of utter mortification on Castiel's face. Dean thinks Cas might be one of those people who gets queasy about blood, but then he remembers that Cas hasn't been a
“I tried to get her on line but you know how that goes,” Sam said. “She’ll find us when she wants to.”
“You didn’t...”
Cas cups his cheek and leans closer, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. He pulls away, a shy smile gracing his lips. “Is this okay?”
“I was not in support of abducting the Winchester. But Raphael knew that would bring you to him.” Akobel says. “Those who protested... you saw what happened to them.”
Dean stands there, staring at the curled up figure, not sure what to say next until Sam clears his throat from his bed. Dean sighs and heads back to the empty bed, feeling no better than he did in the past week. Sam flickers the lights off and Dean watches the dark silhouette of Cas on the couch, sound asleep. The sight does nothing to ease the pain in his chest, having Cas so close but knowing not an atom of him deserves to be anywhere near the former angel. Dean sometimes wishes he could start over, clean slate and everything. Spend another eternity trying to redeem himself worthy enough for Cas. But reality is a bitch.
to quench the ache in his chest from wanting to run straight into the angel's arms.
cry. Not even when Sam started crying when Jess walked down the aisle, or when Sam and Jess exchanged their vows with watery eyes and dumb smiles on their faces. As the officiant asked for the rings, Dean was too busy eye love-making with Cas that he almost pulled out the wrong ring. It was kind of surreal, his little brother getting married as Dean stood opposite to the love of his life. If sixteen year old Dean could see him right then, the kid would've freaked the fuck out, considering he graduated summa cum laude from John Winchester's School of Witchcraft and Internalized Homophobia.
Cas' lips are slightly chapped, but warm against his own, and Dean all but melts into the kiss. It feels better than anything he has ever felt even while it feels like shards of glass are cutting into his chest. Cas takes less than a second to kiss him back, hands coming to cup his face on both sides.
Miracle tilts his head, and Dean's heart aches all over, the gesture reminding him so much of his angel.
"Uh, I'm good. I just zoned out," Dean waves his hand. On a regular day, Dean would be ramping up the charm he usually carries tucked under his sleeve. But now not choking on air itself feels like a miracle.
“Try not to give Commander a hard time,” Camael adds.
"Huh?" he blinks. "You can talk to him?"
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asks, his whiskey warm voice washing over Dean.
Dean looked down at his -
a dark suit and inside out blue tie framing him. He's attractive in a capturing way—defined cheekbones and razor sharp jaw with a five o'clock shadow—minus the fact that he is currently in the process of freezing to death.
"It’s not my fault your family is hilarious." Cas feigned an innocent expression, and Dean's hands itched to pull him into a kiss.
The figure that was leaning on the armchair next to the window was surely Cas, which was confirmed by the soft, "Dean," whispered his way.
Dean rolled his eyes, "You sound so much like Sammy."
, trees are awesome. Dean just sits cross legged on the floor of the clearing and breathes for ten whole minutes, fresh air without the stench of blood and rotting bodies. He looks around for as long as he wants, making a mental note to beat the shit out of Sammy for burying him in the middle of nowhere. He wonders if his funeral party had strippers.
Dean expects Cas to jab at everything wrong with the morphology of dinosaurs or whatever, but Cas is enthralled in the movie, only occasionally grumbling about how improbable it is that the characters manage to survive this long.
Sam gaped, “Come again?”
"The guy you were talking to."
Dean wakes up somewhere dark, certainly not spacious enough for it to be hell. First thing he does is breathe and boy, it feels good.
“Where the hell did they even take him?”
Cas silently resumes drying up the dishes and Dean follows the lead, not knowing what to say to comfort him.
"You don't gotta rub it in," Dean made an attempt at rolling his eyes, only to stop with a slight wince and pulling away from Castiel's hold."I always wanted to go to the beach, y'know? Dad's never took us 'cause he was huntin'."
"Such a shame." Gabriel commented. "Anyways, I need to borrow your car.”
“Is this okay?” Cas looks up at him, a flicker of hesitation in his blue eyes.
"Now that's out of the way, there's something else you gotta know." Dean's gaze lingered on his face for a fraction of a second before it dropped down. "I like you a lot, Cas."
“What the fuck are you talking about?” Dean asks, lowering his blade.
, before he admits that.
"Yes, I would like that," Cas replies, the hint of a smile in his voice.
Now those words were just another broken promise.
"I prefer learning a language to pornography," Cas commented.
The sound of the door creaking open made them jump apart like they were burnt, Dean a little less elegantly.
"Sammy, what the hell–" Dean's voice dies out, and Castiel raises his eyes, the rest of the world turning into a wall of white noise at the sight of his hunter.
“Yeah, because that’s how you deal with stuff.” Sam calls behind him as he makes his way to the kitchen.
"It's clearly affecting you still," Cas says. "Perhaps you haven't let go of your father's influence on your life."
Sam grins. "You have no idea, dude," he chuckles, lowering his gun. "Holy shit, Dean's going to lose his mind."
"I love you too, Dean." Castiel thumbed the delicate skin under his eyes, petting the freckles visible even in the faint moonlight.
"Woah," Dean's eyes widened, "t’was so cool."
So, he shoots a prayer to anyone who’s willing to listen. He hopes his prayer doesn’t end up in Anna’s or Inias’ ears, but Michael seemed like a good guy. At least Dean thought so. He doesn’t ask for anything but to keep his niece or nephew safe and to have both the baby and Eileen to be healthy. Despite everything, it feels good to pray.
"I was a warrior of heaven, I spent the tangible eternity being a soldier and carrying out my assigned duties. My mind is still that of an Angel, but you…"
They gathered around for the reception and Dean gave his kickass toast, earning laughs from the crowd and scowls from Sam, and the best reward of a million dollar kiss from Cas.
"You're amazing, Dean." Cas grabbed his face and kissed him hard, and Dean couldn't do anything but kiss him back. "I'm the luckiest man alive."
“Take your girlfriend with you.”
"You little baby." Dean muttered, flicking his ear. "Want me to get an ice pack?"
"No it ain't that. She's...nevermind."
“She reminds me of you,” Castiel shrugs.
"Shut up," Dean rolls his eyes. "I'm doing good, really good actually."
“Send me some of those links to me, please,” Cas says over the edge of his laptop.
"So, you've got a game plan to find your way back to heaven?"
"You really love him, don't you?"
"I don't know him like you do but the one time I saw you together I could see how he looked at you," Sam says. "Beyond all that, I know my brother. I've never seen you look at someone like that. You look like you've found something good, Dean, don't let that go."
"Hey, it's not that bad," Dean says defensively, but keeps the topic of the pros and cons of human existence for another time. "How did you lose your grace?"
"I have always found this human custom to be very endearing," Cas says softly. "It's even more enjoyable with you."
." Camael nods. "The angels will return with information."
"Hiding, of course," he replied. "That night it was raining heavily and the water kept washing down the soil back into the burrow. But the mole never stopped digging."
The shopkeeper announced the cost and Dean bit his tongue before he could throw in a joke about how Cas would have to propose to him first. There it was, his stupid brain imagining a future with Cas. Not that he didn't want it, but the prospect felt exhilarating and scary all at once.
Dean didn’t wait another moment before crashing their lips together, not trusting himself to utter another word without breaking down into tears. The kiss wasn’t perfect, and Dean wouldn’t have it any other way. He slotted his hands into Cas’s hair like he had wanted for so goddamn long, trying hard to not let his knees give out as he deepened this kiss, every single nerve on his body lighting itself on fire.
“I’m so sorry for your loss, ma’am.” Dean tells her, “If you could give us contact details of his employees, maybe a secretary or something, that would be helpful.”
“This is your home too, buddy.” He assures, ignoring the way his voice shakes.
They stay like that for a while, arms and legs tired and wrapped around each other.
"You can't heal yourself!" Dean smacked his shoulder, rather hard. "We've been on hunts when you weren't there to mother hen us, this is not 'bout me or Sam."
"Perhaps," Cas nods. "I think it's safe to assume you've passed."
"Jesus, Dean," Sam holds his hands up in surrender. "You don't have to go around defending his honor, we have talked to people before."
“That would be me,” Castiel replied, gaze still locked on Dean. “He’s more than anything I deserve.”
As they finished up with their questions, Nadia caught his eyes and inclined her head in the direction of the kitchen.
There is a warm hand on his shoulder and Dean grips the spatula in his hand a little tighter. It's all he can do to not lean into that touch.
Dean blinked at him for a few seconds and then he was on Castiel's lap, lips crashing into his in a frenzy of passion. It felt as perfect as it always did, the sweet taste of pie filling Castiel's senses as he looped his hand around Dean's neck, pulling him impossibly close. After a small eternity, their lips fell apart, panting against each other.
“My name is Uriel.” The man says, staring them down like a bored tourist, “I work with Castiel, and I’m here to help him.” He presses a finger to Sam’s forehead and he flexes his wrist in awe.
"They do make a valid point." Castiel almost regrets his words when he notices the displeasure on Zachariah's face.
“Do you happen to know anything about the man?”
*****
"Never?" Dean mumbled. "Dunno if magic fingers count."
He rushed out of the front door, finding Cas sitting on the edge of the hallway looking out towards the parking lot at the people that walked past. Dean cleared his throat, taking a couple steps closer when Cas didn’t respond.
A small smile pulled at the edge of Dean's lips. "You can't ask shit like that when you know I got no answer."
“Whatever it is that you’re thinking to put yourself down, that isn’t you,” Cas dragged him out of his thoughts. “You’re just someone who had to grow up too fast and carry the weight of the world on your shoulder when all you wanted was someone to show you deserved to be loved.”
“Okay,” Cas says, and then ducks out from underneath him. Dean’s heart is ready to give out right then and there.
And, that's a wrap.
“Since you died, Dean.” Sam shouts.
warm—body behind him, planting his feet and willing his stomach to give up its gymnastics for the day. Cas holds him up, easy and nice, his hands around Dean’s middle and the hard line of his body pressed up behind Dean. It’s enough to make his heart flip in his chest and drop all the way down and out of his ass. Cas’s hand losens, and Dean lowers his teeth down on his bottom lip, choking down the whimper threatening to spill from his mouth.
"It's fine. We don't need the hospital staffs poking around too much, or worse, calling the cops," Sam replied. "He'll be fine with some rest."
Dean lets out a self-deprecating chuckle, "You don't gotta say shit to make me feel better about myself, man."
"That was Jimmy's choice, not mine," Castiel mumbled, tugging his hand away from where Dean was holding the sleeve of his trenchcoat.
"You know that's not usually a good sign, right?"
"Yeah, almost as clear as yesterday," Dean sighs. "Dad always said I had her eyes when he got drunk past the stage of yelling at me."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nah, but I want to," Dean spits out before he can stop himself. "Thought it'd be fun to spend a whole week
"Well, guess this works out for both of us then," she hummed. "So, there’s this party hall in town.”
“You want me to leave the keys too?” Dean mocks. “Cas, can you stay back with her?”
He shed his coat, hanging it on to one of the chairs. "Dean?"
As they slipped past the staff looming around the hallway, to make it all worse, Cas asked, “Why was she staring at me?”
“Hey, look at me,” Castiel meets Dean’s eyes, not remembering when it was that he looked away, “You’re not lost, Castiel. Family doesn’t have to be blood, or grace in your case. It’s something to be earned. You're our friend and if you trust us enough, you have a home here, buddy.”
It takes a while before the phone chimes.
“You guys doing okay?” Sam asked, having no idea what was going on, and honestly he really didn’t want to deal with his emotionally constipated brother and his best friend.
"To what extent can you recognize the damage in these autopsies?" Cas asked.
“I’m still not convinced you’re not playing me,” Nadia grumbled, turning to Cas. “I mean, an
"Just stay with me. Please." Dean chokes out, ignoring the quiver in his voice.
"Slow down, Keats," Dean laughs, and Castiel realizes he said the last part out loud. "I'm not pretty enough for you to go waxing poetic."
Cas would call it. Cas would say what they did was their choice and there was no one to blame. But it didn't matter because Dean was angry at Cas too, because Cas had no right to be so good to him. Dean's heart was too rotten for all those gentle words but Cas kept giving and giving like it was worth it.
Rain poured down heavily from the clouds, dotting the earth with softness and filling the air with that beautiful scent of mud and longing. He watched from where he was sitting on the floor, not anything in particular, just the surrounding world, or at least as far as his human sight let him. A sandpiper was trying to build a nest, which was a hard task during such a downpour, but it remained determined. The bird reminded him of Dean.
"He's still in the meeting," Eileen breathes out.
"I could say that for myself." Cas says against the shared space between their mouths.
“Well, what does it say?”
Sam cleared his throat, "I'll catch up on my sleep then." That's all they got before his brother disappeared down the hallway.
He sighs, pulling his laptop closer and skimming through the words.
Dean ran a hand through his hair, “Come on man, there’s gotta be something.”
"It's great, thanks to myself."
"Hhnngg," Cas says in reply, burying his head deeper under the covers.
Castiel waits. He waits as he watches the mutilated vessels of his brothers and sisters being disposed off. He keeps waiting as new warriors take up the suicide mission, sacrificing their lives to serve heaven. Castiel waits, knowing the sole purpose of his life is to fulfill his father’s orders and make sure the world moves as planned. Castiel does not make choices, he follows commands.
“Hello there,” she smiles sweetly. “How can I help ya?”
"Okay, that's fair." He grumbled. "Biggest fear?"
“I see your vocabulary has expanded beyond ‘awesome’.” Cas comments.
He breaks. Dean digs his fingers into his palm until he can feel the crescents forming, and it’s all he can do to not lean into Cas’s touch and start purring like a damn cat. He blinks away the tears until the ceiling turns from blurry to clear, and turns to look at Cas. He’s leaning sideways against the headboard, his head tilted and resting on his bicep, and his fingers in Dean’s hair.
“You’re staying back, Dean.” Sam says, firmly. “I literally just got you back and I’m not sending you out there again. Give yourself some time, man. Take a vacation or something, please.” The tone of desperation in Sam's voice seems to be getting to Dean. “You need some time to pick yourself up.”
"Fuck off, jerk." Sam huffs a laugh. "Bobby, why don't you come along?"
Despite the morbid scene around him, Castiel smiles at Dean's prayer. He would do anything to give Dean his brother back.
“Honestly, yes. But I have to power through.” Castiel said. “Are you still in college?”
“Are you drunk?” Nemiah raises an eyebrow at Dean.
"It's nothing you need to worry about," Cas says.
"Never realized what?" Dean prompts.
"Me? I'm helping people. I'm letting people have what they want," Irene argued. "People are tied down by tons worth of baggage from all four sides and in the end they die off without having what they want," she glanced at Castiel. "You'd know something about that, right Cas?"
"Mainly because you two only talk to each other," Sam provides helpfully. "Still don't know if I buy his story, but, if he's been an angel all this time and suddenly he's gotta eat, sleep and walk, that might throw a guy off."
And Sam needed alcohol.  A lot of it.
“I’m assuming we can’t stroll in there, grab Sam and walk outta the front door.”
“Dean,” Cas said his name as though it was the only thing worth saying, and it was more than he could take.
Castiel frowns, “I’m not…”
"Dude, you're human now. You could do all that."
“You left in the middle of the night without a word and you didn’t pick up your phone,” Cas sighed. “I was worried.”
"Sam, I don't want to overwhelm Dean right now," Castiel says, while his grace is clawing at his chest to be let out and seek refuge where he can sense Dean's soul, somewhere deep in the bunker.
Oops. Alexa play Cardigan by Taylor Swift.
The briefing lasts a long while as Zachariah allots them their duties and shares the desertions from various missions of theirs. Akobel, Esper and Bartholomew receive the task of seeking out Lilith’s whereabouts and Castiel is asked to keep eyes on the Winchesters, as expected.
"I'm familiar with this technology," Cas hums, squinting distastefully at the laptop.
“Type of movies, Cas.” Dean chuckled. “You wanna watch Indiana Jones?”
“I assure you, Dean is not planning to sleep with anybody.” Cas stepped in, his eyes glaring murder.
Castiel is blearily staring at the coffee machine, willing it to work faster, when his phone rings, startling him out of his morning stupor. He squints at the screen, smiling when he sees the caller ID.
“I did have my reason,” Dean chokes out, sounding as though he’s trying not to get angry. “I’ll explain it to you. All of it-”
"There you are." Nemiah calls, grinning. Castiel rolls his eyes, even as he smiles at her. Nemiah has always been one of the rebellious ones and probably the only angel who has spent more time on earth than Castiel. They both disbanded from their crowd for the same reason, but Nemiah was willing to cut ties completely for the one she loved. At one time, Castiel never really understood the motivation behind the decision, but now he knows. "Apparently, Raphael just nuked us."
They sit like that for a while, Cas pressed against his side and Dean's hand rubbing his shoulders every time he startles. It's all so stupidly domestic, but when Cas sighs and drops his head on Dean's shoulder, he knows it's as perfect as it can get.
"No," Dean replies, though his eyes never leave Castiel.
"I apologize, brother." Michael said, "We had to wait until you were back from your
“’M not,” he mumbled back, ignoring the shudder that ran down his spine at Cas’s lips so close to his ear.
for it, and Dean actually forgot to do just that. At least, Cas is trying to bite down a grin at Dean’s blatant lie, so that’s good.
“I’m great, Jess.” Dean fixed her with a stare, him being the one booking it out of the room faster than he could say ‘fuck’.
"Good, you're catching up."
Cas's eyes met Dean's, only for a fraction of a second before he turned to look at Sam.
Dean scrunches his nose, “You’re a disgrace, Sammy.”
The drive is silent after that and Sam dozes off next to him.
"Do you think she's being suspicious?"
"Oh, don't be like that man, I promise you we'll find it," Dean says. "Did you get anything from anywhere we have gone by now?"
“He saved me from a tight spot, more times than I could count,” Dean answered promptly. Castiel turned to meet Dean’s eyes, his heart coming to a screeching halt in his chest at the sight of the small smile that pulled at Dean’s lips. It all but stopped beating when Dean leaned in to press a kiss to his cheek. “I’m the luckiest man alive.”
“That’s right.” Dean says, “Now if your bosses have a problem, tell them to go cry over it. You got your own choice, Cas.” He does not. Castiel admires Dean’s courage — his surety about his choices and the way he acts only according to his own jurisdiction. Castiel, on the other hand, has to follow orders. Choices are not a part of his role in serving humanity. “You don’t need to kiss their asses if you don’t want to. Do what is right, not what others think is.”
That exact train of thought has Dean asking, “When did you get all tech savvy?”
“That has nothing to do with running around with a demon, Sam.” Dean shouts back. Castiel should probably interfere, but he does not trust Dean’s rage. “This is all about your stupid obsession with killing Lilith.”
"Easier said than done." Cindy sighs. "Even if she's gonna, the baggage is still left unpacked."
helping,” Sam tried to reassure, his heart aching at the way Cas’s frame shifts as though to make himself smaller. “You being here...he needs that. Just don’t take off on him.”
"The hell if I know." Dean shrugged.
"Not every description is accurate, Dean, case in point," Cas chides, gesturing vaguely at himself. "Demons are capable of resembling humans the way angels do, even more so at advantage since their wings are not manifested in this plane."
"How about we make out in front of them?"
"Well, he's not exactly people."
"It's just a concussion, trust me. I know you're worried but the cops were already a little suspicious when we showed up to investigate an animal attack."
“Leave that to us.” Nemiah eyes him with a calculating gaze, “You okay?”
"We dismantled the- the means of communication between angels fearing interception." Camael stumbled with his words. "It was a strategically poor attack. We were able to defend off without much trouble."
Dean sucks in a sharp breath, ducking his head, "It's fine if you don't like it, I we can work with—"
“We’re so sorry, ma’am.” He says.
“Guys.” Dean really didn’t give enough credit to his family. “You didn’t have to.”
The days were getting shorter, the sky turning a shade of crimson. As he drove past the row of houses decorated with hanging skeletons and Jack O'lanterns, Dean remembered the halloween back in Kansas, where everyone knew everyone else and life was easier.
This chapter is a bit smaller because I had to split it to make the next chapter. Words kept coming, ya know? Anyways, hope you enjoy!
“There is a death certificate issued under the name Robin Brown two years prior,” Cas says, brows pinched as he stares at the screen. “That does match with the time we believe the spirit first appeared.”
"Guys, Michael is calling. Someone pick up the phone!" Gabriel called from his office, and next to him, Cas let out a sigh, leaving to deal with Michael.
And so he begins to recall everything from meeting Dean leading up to this moment, Jaime interrupting to make snide remarks, though much less times than he expects her to. When he finishes, Jaime remains quiet for a while, though Castiel can practically hear her thinking.
“There’s always gonna be a
Dean shut the door and climbed into the driver's seat, silently thanking the universe for Cas.
“Lie down with your head in my lap,” Cas says, like it’s all there is to do. “Your neck will be grateful.”
He will need a rewatch, anyway.
Dean hummed, “So how did he die?”
"Shut up," Dean leaned forward, resting his head on Castiel's shoulder. "I meant it. No one else gets you."
"Dean, can you see anything?" Nemiah whispers.
Sam rolled his eyes, muttering, "Wuss."
Cas cups the side of his face, running a thumb across the delicate skin under his eyes, “Are you alright with this, Dean?”
Days pass and there is absolute tranquility in heaven. No orders are given forth, no briefings are held. After nearly a fortnight, Castiel receives his first message.
Eileen is pretty far along and Dean wanted to stay and be there for Sam but his brother and sister-in-law threatened to take his key back and lock him out forever if he didn't go along with the plan, so there wasn't much choice there.
“I’m gonna go pack,” Sam mumbled, or at least Dean thought he did. The door slamming shut behind him startled him back to reality. He ducked his head, suddenly every single atom in his body acting like a twelve year old schoolgirl.
“Dean?”
Dean laughs, trying not to outright skip down the hill with the way warmth creeps up his skin. Cas doesn't offer the array of compliments Dean's dates usually throw leisurely at Baby, but a warm smile reaching his eyes splays across his lips and he trails his fingers up the hood.
Dean shot him an apologetic smile. "Guys, leave him alone. He probably doesn't wanna talk."
Dean clears his throat, "You alright, Cas?"
Cas stayed.
Cas doesn't say anything for long until the words fall out of his mouth almost a murmur, "Can I kiss you?"
Dean made a face, "I just told you it hurts."
"I know," Castiel assured him, gently guiding Dean to lie back down. "I’m going to heal you. It won't be pleasant."
"I've done a lot of things in life and been with a lot of people," Dean began, but Cas just narrowed his eyes. "Don't worry, I'm not gonna brag about my body count. My point is, nothing's felt as right as you, Cas." He blurted out, hearing the thumping of his heart in his ears. He cleared his throat, wanting to get it all out before he had a stroke right then and there. "I love you so fucking much and I've never been so far gone like this but I ain't complaining. You're just perfect."
Louisa nodded, turning on her heel and disappearing into the night. Dean made his way back to the hall, the gushing of blood loud in his ears. The scream he had heard before slipping out still echoed in his head. He stepped in, eyes scanning the crowd for a sign of the familiar mop of dark hair. It didn’t take much time to figure out where to look for Cas since the whole crowd was gathered around in the middle of the ground.
Dean shook his head, "Just let me down easy, I'm a fragile heart."
Castiel was seconds away from confessing his love for the man in his arms, holding himself back at the last moment, not wanting to rush things. One thing was for sure, Castiel was going to try his best to make this work.
“He doesn’t,” Cas protested, eyes growing wide. “It was my wholehearted decision. I don’t expect anything in return, Sam. He’s...he means a lot to me and I couldn’t watch him spiral into insanity and violence if I could help.”
Cas frowned at the hand print on Dean's face where he had been slapped, "Sam, why did you–"
Castiel tugs at his arm, forcing him to meet his eyes "Firstly, if you could see yourself the way I see you, you wouldn't think so low of yourself. There is so much good in you, it's remarkable. You're remarkable, Dean." Cas says, like it's the one thing he's sure of.
"Do you need a ride home?" Cas asked.
“I’m sorry–” he began, not sure what exactly he was sorry about.
Dean chuckled, rolling the condom on and lubing himself up before lining up to push in. Castiel's breath caught in his chest as the blunt head of Dean's cock pushed past his rim ever so slowly. He arched off the bed, digging his fingers into the meat on Dean's shoulder.
"Hey, I'm the pinnacle of good coping mechanisms," Dean finishes the sentence with a snort of his own.
"Hey, it’s not ‘cause I think you’re not good. Hell, you’ve been fighting since day one," Dean moved closer, his gaze flitting between the wall and the floor. "I just lost Charlie…I can't lose you too."
“Ahem,” Gabriel says out loud, and Dean bristles only remembering they have company. “This is all real cute and heartwarming but I gotta take off.”
“I was just thinking what the symbol might’ve meant,” Cas shrugged, as the waitress dropped off their plates with a hearty smile, which he noticed was directed at Dean.
“Dean, don’t be dramatic,” Cas rolls his eyes.
"Castiel?" Michael's voice pulls him out of his stupor.
"You know what, don't tell me," Dean waves his hand, clicking the play button.
"I'm not sure anyone has said that."
they make it out of this alive. Maybe Cas would want to stay. He doesn’t think about it now.
"Guys, we can do this some other time," Dean says, leaving a hand on the small of Castiel's back. He smiles when Cas leans into the touch, his shoulders drooping. "We're beat, gonna head to bed."
"Relax, Cas." Dean whispers against the shell of his ear, gently pushing him down on the bed, straddling his things. Their clothing falls off one by one, scattering somewhere on the dimly lit motel room floor.
"You know what, we're getting takeout."
The few seconds of silence that follows marks the most uncomfortable Dean has ever been.
"Why not you?" Castiel counters. "What you did in hell was wrong, but that does not make you abominable. You did everything in your power to hold off torturing those souls. Everybody has a breaking point, Dean. You held off longer than yours."
He nodded. "Yeah."
Jaime rolls her eyes, "You ask this every time, dude. Keep it, I told you."
Dean met his eyes for the first time in the last couple of days and it was only then Castiel realized the potency with which he missed those greens.
"What you're describing is a normal home, Dean," Cas commented, a smile in his voice. "One day when you quit hunting you could have that too."
“I don’t know who that is, but I despise myself for it,” Castiel says, too late to stop the words from spilling out of him. “I’m no hero, Dean. Everything I ever wanted was to let the angels live following their will and yet here I am, giving out orders.”
Cas goes around to sit back on his chair and continue his research, but Dean’s heart is dead set on leaping out of his chest. It’s not helping that Cas is dressed in a leather jacket and ripped jeans, after years of hiding himself away in the stupid trenchcoat. He’s got that squinty expression, the one he gets when he’s on hyperfocus, and Dean can’t help but smile at these little things about Cas that haven't changed in the past three years.
Cas held out his hand, and Dean shook his head, sliding the ring onto his own finger. He pulled his wallet out and dug through it until he found Mary's ring. The ring was all he had left of his mom, but it was a punishment too; a constant reminder of everything he had lost. He grabbed Cas's hand and slid the ring onto his finger, hoping it will mean something better to Cas. After all, there was no one in this whole goddamn world who Dean would want to give it to.
It hurt him to realize how much those words meant to him, and how much he wished to hear them, just from seeing the momentary glaze of tears in Dean's eyes before he blinked them away behind a grin. "You're weird," he mumbled, lips twitching.
He clears the boxes one by one, opening the last one to find a small radio. There isn't much hope of getting any signal up here but he whips up the silver antenna, tuning the radio through the static until a somewhat tangible murmur of words echo through the speaker, only to fade away into static a few seconds later.
edition."
"And?" Jess prompted.
As though Dean’s eyes had its own mind, he found himself staring back into the blue of Cas’s eyes, unable to deny his friend anything. Whatever resignation he was expecting to see in Cas’s eyes was not there, instead all he could see was compassion, and if Dean let himself dream a little more,
"Oh, Dean told you about that." Jessica looked surprised. "It's going great, though I barely get to stay home. Listen, my shift starts in half an hour. I'ts really nice to meet you, Cas."
"Cas," Dean tries again with another shake of his shoulder. "You
hands on Cas in return, makes him want to tear down the walls. And he doesn’t know what to do with that feeling. Cas isn’t his, and it’s not like Dean wants Cas to be his. It’s
"Real mature," Dean rolls his eyes. "Who's the unlucky guy? Or gal?"
“We should go,” Cas murmurs.
"Are you okay, Dean?" Nemiah asks, her eyes trained on the demon.
Eileen snaps, whacking Sam behind the head, other hand on her belly as though she’s trying to cover its ears. Dean's glad his brother married a firecracker.
******
"Then, what do you want from me?"
"Sweeping dust and hiding it underneath the doormat, shoes on bed and morning people."
“It has to be one of the members of the families,” Dean comments, and adds with a resigned sigh. “Or, someone’s haunting the property holding the place.”
“Oh, get over yourself. You’re new, Cas.” He said. “Nobody ends up on the most liked list in two weeks, even if you own the whole thing.”
"That is good to know," Cas answers, squirming slightly.
Dean's heart threatens to explode at the sight of the two most beloved things to him right where he wants them, and for a moment he forgets how to breathe. He watches Cas pet the top of Miracle's head like he's the most precious thing in the world, and the dog nudges up against his hand with the same reverence.
Cas smiles at the fondness hidden beneath his words, "I will see to it," he says and ends the call.
"I'm open to both," she grinned.
“That’s right,” Dean threw an arm around Cas’ shoulder. “I’m taken.”
"Yeah, only for you." Dean slid the ring into his finger, a sigh escaping his chest. "Holy shit."
"Sounds like it."
Dean grins at his brother. "Fair enough."
Sam whipped his head up, the surprise in his features fading away only to be replaced by confusion, "Cas, you, um, you said you loved him," he said, gesturing to Dean. "Did he know?"
Whoever it is, Dean's going to kill them.
“You’re human?” Dean asked, the words feeling muddled on his tongue.
"Forever, dumbass," Dean snorted. "I'd do the whole
He placed a hand on his friend’s shoulder and gave it a shake, “Cas, buddy, it’s just a nightmare. Wake up!”
It's the way Cas says those words that makes Dean's heart beat wildly in his chest. He doesn't know the implications behind what Cas said but there is the same adoration that Dean has seen on Castiel's face when he waters his succulent or hums along to Dean's out of tune singing when they work together in the kitchen.
"It's not exactly— nevermind," he clicked off the tab with no results. "At least you know it's not all just porn."
In that moment, Castiel remembers the first time Dean presented him with the idea of following his own mind rather than blindly obeying orders. It was like a new door had opened up in front of him, an option he never knew existed. As time passed, it became clearer that the choice of free will came at the lives of many.
"Nah, Baby's just a few blocks away."
“Put up or shut up,” Victor grins back. Dean didn’t know if he was serious or just comfortable enough with his masculinity to play gay chicken.
The short distance from the steps to the Impala left him with a mixture of delight and dread. On one hand he was gonna get some time to spend with Nadia while on the other, he had no idea how he was going to convince his emotional brick wall of a brother and too nice for his own good former angel, at least for one evening, to stop pretending they weren't in love.
"I can't wait either," Cas says. "I also need to get a job. And a place to live."
Cas looks up from where he's examining a fry he picked up from Dean's plate, "Not literally. Well, not figuratively either." He tilts his head, face mere inches away from Dean's. "Huh, this is a peculiar situation."
Cas sighed, “Can you look at me?”
"The magic of the internet," Dean chuckled.
"As a heart attack," Which was exactly what Dean would have had if Cas didn't say anything soon.
Maybe the Mark was just an extension of his own twisted mind.
"S' fine, I get it. I totally understand if you don't wanna be friends anymore ‘cause this is too complicated-"
Three months. Eighty three days. One thousand nine hundred ninety two hours. A hundred and nineteen thousand minutes. Over seven million seconds.
Dean sighed. "Straight to business then."
“Yeah, what’s up with that guy?” Dean asked, “He’s nothing like you or Michael, everyone in the office loves him.”
“Look, just let me go check on Terra. Then you can arrest me or whatever,” she said. “I’m not going to run. Terra’s my future and I am not gonna leave her.”
“Nemiah, Camael and Dean have returned.”
"Good. Can't afford to fail that one," Dean leans forward and kisses him sweet and slow. "Let me take you home?"
“Oh, piss off,” Sam rolled his eyes, digging into his breakfast, but not before saying, “You guys are in an awfully good mood today.”
Castiel wakes up to the undesirably loud banging on his motel door for a change. He peers at his phone through once cracked eye and sees it’s only ten minutes past four, which explains the darkness outside, but does not explain why someone is waking him up this early.
He bit his tongue right as he was about to call out that he had someone far hotter to sleep with. Dean was never the one to brag but Cas wasn't making it easy.
******
“Human beliefs are so much more complex than what faith really is.” Cas says, all serious. “Abstaining from sexual intimacy does not particularly please God.”
"Why do you have to argue with me over everything?"
Everyone including Sam and Jess made a face, Castiel shook his head in resignation. If being in love with Dean felt that good, Castiel could get behind the feeling for the rest of his life.
"Your brother is awake." Cas says, tone void of any emotion. "You might want to test him."
“It’s probably just a mix up, nothing our supervisors can’t hash out,” the voice says. “Hey, the more the merrier, am I right?"
"Dean—"
As Jack tore down the walls while trying to build a new world, Castiel lost his connection to earth, and further his connection to Sam and Dean. But, not one moment has gone by without Castiel thinking about Dean. It's something he has begrudgingly admitted is out of his control. In his defense, as immortal as he is, Dean has been the center of his existence ever since that moment he placed a hand on his glorious soul in hell.
"Forgive me for being concerned about your health," Cas mutters, with the kind of bite in his voice that Dean can't get enough of.
The longer they kept looking, the deeper the fear spread through Dean's body. They moved through the town, ducking between buildings and tearing through the alleyways, blinking hard to adjust to the darkness.
It took everything in him not to fall into Cas’s arms and just cry until he couldn’t anymore. Dean was tired. He was so fucking tired he couldn’t do this anymore. It was ungrateful and cowardly but sometimes he wished it was him burning on a pyre instead of all the people that sacrificed their lives for him. His throat closed up and his chest tightened, everything around him turning blurry. Dean curled his arm into fist trying to stop his whole body from tingling like he was hooked up to a static machine.
"I was a doula in my past life," Jo says dryly. "Just shut up and drive."
One of the staff members introduced herself as Hannah, his assistant, and escorted him to his office. Barely ten minutes later, Michael called him into the conference room for their briefing for the apartment complex. He took the seat next to Gabriel, catching sight of the familiar green eyes on the far end of the table. Dean winked at him and Castiel cleared his throat, ducking his head from sight.
“What happened to her?”
Sam made a snorting noise before handing the phone to Castiel. "Just check to see if both his pupils are dilated differently," he instructed.
“We can leave the moment you feel like it’s too much,” Cas assured him. “I would never make you unnerved on purpose.”
“You stupid self sacrificing son of a bitch. Who woulda guessed you’d kick the bucket this soon.” Robert Singer chokes out, voice thick and pain ridden. “I’m proud of you, idjit, you gotta know that. Your dad ain’t half the man you were.” A hard gulp, “I’ll miss you, son.”
"You got it, boss." Dean threw in a salute and Cas scrunched up his nose, the familiar smile replacing it soon enough.
Dean shakes his head, a mirthless laugh spilling out of his chest, "I'm a wreck without you, Cas. Every time I lose you my life goes to shit," he says, blinking away the tears. "You tell me the things I've been wanting to hear from you ever since we met, and then you fucking die on me even before I can wrap my head around it."
“Well, we can’t be sure,” he sighed. “Love is complicated.”
Castiel's smile slips off and he shakes his head, "A plant doesn't conclude anything."
He's a little surprised when Bobby takes up the offer, guess the day is full of surprises. He stands through all the ambush and lets himself get pulled into a hug.
"Perhaps I know the love I feel for a honeybee, or an infant when they open their eyes to the world for the first time," he says, a far away look on his face. "But love has different forms and it's fascinating how humanity has so much of it to offer."
"Everything." Cas says, voice barely a whisper. "Why one minute you're kissing me and the other you can't even look at me."
"Is there any way I can assist in the search for Lilith?"
"Music feels different," Cas replied. "I used to hear the sound before...but now I can feel the rhythm and vibrations in my bones."
Sam chuckled, “That bad, huh?”
Castiel sighed, “I’m only working up the mindset to appreciate them myself.”
"Shh, ’s okay, buddy," Dean reached up with a hand to pat the top of Castiel's head twice. "My prom date was a hide-behind. He was ugly."
mad, Dean had to make him waffles for breakfast and drive him to the farmer’s market. Cas had brought three jars of honey.
"I assume we should talk about our situation."
Dean could swear his face was on fucking fire. "I'm sitting right here." He grumbled.
“Holy fuck, that’s so... cool.” Not the most eloquent choice of word. “Why don’t you paint for a living?”
"You wanna date?" Dean asked, words slow and calculated.
"Ten fingers and ten toes intact," Sam said in lieu of greeting, smiling wide.
The logical part of Dean's brain knew the next step was to put the ring on the guy's finger, dust his pants and head home to get celebratory fucked by his fiance, but his body didn't get the memo as he stayed rooted to the spot. Thankfully, Cas was hauling him onto his feet and tackling him in a kiss, his arms coming to wrap around Dean's shoulder.
"Hey, wait," He heard the shifting of covers behind him. A hand grabbed his elbow, turning him around. "Dean, please don't speak like that. You mean a lot to me in ways I can't explain. Outside of sex, you're still one of my closest friends. Please tell me if I said something to hurt you."
"No, Cas.
"I won't," Castiel assured them both, mirroring the gentle smile that pulled against Dean's lips.
Dean let out a long sigh and said, “I fucked up, didn’t I?”
Sam's expression softens, "Have fun you guys, we'll call later."
"I need you to give me something to work with, man." Dean says. "I've been batting a whoopin' zero here, trying to figure out what the fuck is going on."
"Shh...Cas," Dean whispers against the column of his neck, "Wanna make you feel so good…"
"No shit, smartass."
Dean is exhausted and broken and terrified of his own mind. Trying to breathe hurts, so he doesn't. Instead, he yanks Cas forward into a kiss, every inch of his being screaming at him to not to dump his pathetic self on the man. But, Dean might die if he doesn't. He will die.
“I’m not blind, Dean,” Sam groused. “I’ve seen you swallow your tongue enough times. Just tell him how you feel.”
Castiel raised a brow, "So, you had claimed as
"Dog person or cat person?"
"Not if I tell him I got a promotion as my boss' personal cuddler."
"Probably." Dean lies. He hates lying to Cas. He means too much to Dean. "I'm a dick like that."
“Fuck, don’t remind of that conversation,” Dean chuckled breathily, pulling back from the embrace. Castiel curled his palms into a fist at his sides to stop himself from tugging Dean back in, still recognizing all the signs of Dean pulling back and shutting him out. The green eyes that looked back at him were mellow and glazed slightly. Dean’s hands dragged it’s way up from Cas’s waist to rest on the curve of his shoulders.
“Nice to meet you, Ms. Devereux,” Dean walked over to shake her hand, wanting something, literally
“Dean.” Sam Winchester’s voice says, tone full of disgust, “Don’t chew and talk. Were you raised in a barn?”
“I know, Dean. I’m just worried.” She said. “I kinda think you’re freaking out.”
“Depends on what you’re thinking.” Cas said, and Dean was going to give him an extra blowjob for that.
“Those who did this will pay,” Cas bites out, voice cold. “In the meantime, we refrain from turning the people among us against each other.”
"You don't need to." Cas mutters. "And, if you're disappointed in me not having my powers anymore, I will understand if you want me to leave."
Cas smiled at him and held out his hand, "Come on, Dean."
“’Course you would, you leech. I ain’t your personal mechanic,” Dean mutters, a hint of a smile in his voice, before he adds softly, “I’ll get it done once we get back.”
"I was planning to send a pigeon-
******
They pull up next to the tail end of the row of shops, deciding to work their way up. A look at the man next to him and Dean feels his heart climb all the way up to his throat. Cas looks like a kid in a candy store on Christmas and New Year and Halloween all at once, blue eyes bright and sliding past everything around them.
"Dean, I never really understood how you can speak so low of yourself." Cas says, nothing short of genuine concern in his voice. "You are the bravest man I have ever met."
“Cas. Hey, no,” Dean grabbed his wrist on a whim, all the uncharted anger seeping out of him as soon as Cas’s face crumpled. “I’m sorry, man. I should’ve let you know before leaving. I won’t do that again.”
There are two explanations to this.
“I’m just glad I could do something for you,” he says softly, the blue of his eyes glinting.
“It has to be.” Castiel says. “Lilith is aiming only at releasing Lucifer, and if she herself is performing the ritual, then this must be important.” During his time away from heaven, Castiel has no idea how many seals have been broken so far. This could be the third or the last, there is no way to tell. And he barely doubts heaven has bothered with the task of stopping Lilith.
Bobby cocks a brow at him, “Thought you kicked him to the curb.”
"But why would he…" Castiel trails off, utterly perplexed. "I wanted Dean to be happy."
Castiel didn't understand the reference Dean was trying to make, but it didn't matter, not when his eyes were lit up so brilliantly and the smile that tugged at his lips looked endearing.
Castiel set the utensils aside and walked over to where Dean was standing in front of the door to the storage room. Oh shit, Dean was not supposed to see that. But then again, some part of Castiel wanted Dean to see it. He remembered the way Dean appreciated his painting the first time he was in the house.
Cas rolls his eyes, "Consider yourself lucky."
Everything feels right, his heart feels at home, and Dean could easily believe he's dreaming.
"And that thing's attached to you as well. Literally," Dean grumbled. "Way too many layers, man."
"They attacked us with some sort of weapon, possibly extracted from Lucifer's crypt." Sariel clarifies. "It has created a giant crater on the ground. The only remnants we found were this." He hands Castiel a metal ball the size of a fist, with carvings all over them.
"I don't know, Sammy," Dean sighs, "I gotta ask him, and if he says no, it's a no."
"Go to bed, you look beat," Dean says, nodding towards the one bedroom in the cabin.
They were packed into the corner booth of a small restaurant, Sam by his side and Dean opposite to him. Sam was on his laptop, pulling up files and scanning through them. Castiel always felt an aversion towards technology; their level of sentience always threw him off a bit.
“Perhaps, they might be working with demons,” Castiel says, not catching the whiff of what Dean’s hinting at, “it’s uncommon, but these are desperate times.”
“At least we don’t have to flee the country.”
on a paper?"
“Like you said, you have been through the pain of losing your dear ones,” he said. “It’s okay, Dean. You’re allowed to be afraid, but you need to let people help you.”
"Cas, look at me," Dean grabs his shoulder with his free hand, "It's just a small cut, man, nothing to freak out about."
Dean watches Cas climb into his car and drive away, the words echoing in his head, though he doesn’t know what to make of that. It seems like all Dean is doing these days is watch Cas leave and leave, being able to do nothing to stop him.
"It's alright, Dean." Cas sat down on the arm of the chair, carding his fingers through the unruly spikes of Dean's hair. He felt Dean lean into the touch, humming softly. "It's a refreshing change from the generally monotonous people I'm surrounded by. My whole family combined does not have as much enthusiasm as Charlie alone."
catch his eye.
Castiel stared back and forth between the both of them. “Am I missing something?”
Sam nodded, smiling, “How are you holding up so far?”
Dean shrugs, "A whole year plus all the teenage angst seems enough." Through the rearview mirror, Dean watches Cas stare out of the window, expression solemn.
“Dean, you don’t have to-”
Their fingers brushed as Dean pried the magazine away from Cas’s hand, springing a bolt of electricity right down to his spine. It was only when Dean realized how close they were, close enough that Cas’s knee bumped his hip. His legs were rooted to the floor even when there was nothing left to do other than move away. He just couldn’t, not when Cas’s eyes pinned him to the spot like a tack on a map.
It took Dean a moment to realize the choked out sound he heard was coming from his own throat. He gasped, feeling like he was about to fall off a cliff that didn’t start or end anywhere. Cas’s arms coming back around him and catching his from falling was somehow the final shove he needed.
“Fuck you,” Dean snapped, reaching over to pull his hair, the same time as Cas muttered, “Sorry, Sam.”
"I'm not taking another case for at least a month."
"Yes ma'am. Gotta fry a crispy batch for Jo 'cause she likes it crunchy enough to let out her frustration with each bite."
"Get some rest, buddy," Dean says softly, watching the stranger's shoulders droop as he sinks into the corduroy.
“...feed you down there, boy? You’re gonna get pie stuck in your pipe.” Robert Singer’s voice says from inside the house.
He clears his throat and looks down at his half empty bowl and sighs.
“Oh, well. I have a case for you.”
“There, done,” Cas pulls away, leaving a whiff of something like the scent of vanilla in his wake.
“It’s an abomination-”
“Commander!” Dean doesn't even turn around, not having the energy to deal with Camael’s dramatic ass. “I have set up a tent for you and your human.”
"Castiel, did you get hold of Michael?" Ruby asked.
Ruby pouts, her hand on her chest, “Wow, you really hurt my feelings, Dean.”
"Sure," Terra sniffed, and Louisa was by her side in an instant, rubbing her back.
“Not even an angel?” Dean asks, “Wait, don’t answer that. They’re your siblings.”
He had a new order to obey,
“It’s okay, Dean. You’re safe,” Cas’s hand wrapped around his shoulders. Dean was too tired to care and just leaned closer, curling his fist into the front of Cas’s shirt as he waited for the world to stop spinning.
"I am going to be returning to Chicago with you next week." Castiel began. "It is because a few staff from our branch will be moving there."
Dean sighed, “Please tell me it’s the good kind.”
"There is so much I don't understand about my emotions, but with you it's all simple," Cas says. "All through eternity I have felt lost, but the moment I opened my eyes all those days ago, I no longer felt untethered. I felt like I belonged, Dean."
He tries Bobby. "This better be important, idjit." Bobby says. There is the crackling of fire in the background.
“Breaking out the eyeliner, are we?” Jaime raises a brow at her brother, who simply grins back.
"We'd never, Sammy," Dean piped in. "We love you so much."
He looks breathtaking.
"You're on potato peeling duties," Dean says, noticing their hands are still weaved together, and uses that as leverage to pull Cas into the kitchen along with him.
"Hey, not that." Dean cuts him off. "Just hear me out okay."
Dean's eyes snapped up at that, a flicker of confusion amidst the green. "Huh?"
“Excuse me.” Castiel walked over to the door, wondering who it might be. He hadn’t met any neighbors so far and nobody else knew him around the area. He pulled open the door, a rain-drenched figure staring back at him.
"Consider this your first step into the family business, Castiel. Also, you will need to move to Italy to oversee the project." Michael supplied, "You have to stay only until the tender is sanctioned."
Cas sighs, shoulders drooping. "I'm sorry, Dean. I was trying to help."
"How did he manage last year during the anniversary?" Cas asks, curling his fingers around his drink.
"The kid's got some lungs," Jo chuckles breathy, resting her head on Dean's shoulder.
"They're lovely people, Dean. Exactly what I expected from your family," Cas remarks. "Though, I have a feeling your brother is not very pleased with me."
Castiel meets his gaze for one last time, an unreadable look in his eyes before the telltale sound of wings echo through the barn.
“Sam,” Castiel reached out and nudged his leg with his own. “Sam, wake up.”
Even in the middle of his mind running a mile a minute, Dean knew this was it for him. Nothing on God’s green earth would give him even close to the happiness Cas gave him. As sappy as it was, being with Cas was like being at home while flying though the clouds all at once. Sometimes Dean would find his own breath catching in his lungs on the days when he woke up and saw Cas asleep next to him, like there was nowhere else he wanted to be.
“Actually,” Meg stopped him with a hand around his wrist, “I have someone you can chat up with. He’s over there,” She pointed to her far left where a dark haired man sat on the arm of the couch, sipping something from a cup, a five o’clock shadow lining his jaw. “That’s Castiel. I dragged him along because he hates parties and I like watching him suffer.”
"And who was there to take care of you?"
"I'm twenty one, by the way," he taps a finger on his ID. "As you can see."
“So, you remember Ruby’s knife?” Sam asks.
******
"Heaven is...different," Cas says. "It is more or less like a tree. There are many branches and new ones keep growing out and infinitely expanding. The infrastructure morphs itself into whatever it is that is needed at the moment's disposal."
To his surprise, Dean laughed heartily, “Can’t believe you held out that long. With everything I’ve done to you it would’ve been fair if you had some fun.”
Sam cleared his throat, “So, you're saying Jamie killing her husband to pursue her career served as a sacrifice that woke
Cas cups Dean’s cheek, eyes soft and adoring before he turns to Gabriel. “Thank you, brother. I hope this isn’t a goodbye.”
, Dean should’ve known. His brother paused at the door, looking red. “Uh, everything good?”
"No, Cas, I have a car," he says between breaths. "Did you really think I left my kid down at the foot of the hill?"
Zachariah glowers at him, his wings expanding in an effort to intimidate him, "Those rules are forgotten, Castiel. An apocalypse would only be doing us a favor. Humanity is feeble, it can be erased and rebuilt in a matter of seconds." He says, "A clean slate would benefit all of us. If Lucifer is willing to do that for free, then why bother stopping him?"
"For what?"
Castiel watches helplessly as the restroom door swings back and forth behind Justin’s departure, knowing this is always how it went but unable to do anything about it. There is a monster to kill and people’s lives are at stake, Castiel tells himself, hoping those excuses will hold long enough for him to forget the man he fell in love with; the one who he knows he can’t have.
"Guys, this is Castiel," Dean introduces, "Cas, this is Sam and Eileen, my somewhat cool family."
“If you’re even remotely suspicious, call us. Please don’t go chasing whatever it is on your own.”
He hesitates a moment before pulling at the top button on Castiel's dress shirt, "I would've bought you dinner first but there's no time for that." Dean sucks in a sharp breath, too late to take the words back. He winks at Cas, playing it off as a joke. Duct taping is mouth shut would do all of them a favor.
Cas rolled his eyes, “I’m not going to defecate, I can assure you.”
"We can have it, Dean," Castiel ran his fingers through the hairs at the back of Dean's head, smiling when Dean tilted back towards the touch. "Instead of holding back because the world might challenge us any moment, why not enjoy the time we have to the fullest?"
Dean can't help but laugh, "Man, I hope he does," he lowers himself next to Cas, feeling his heart thudding hard against his chest.
uncomfortable,” he hisses. “I don’t know what idea you’ve got about me, but I’m not an asshole.”
Castiel grabbed the remote from Dean's hand to stop his aimless surfing and flicked over to Animal Planet, "In that case, we can tell as much truth as we can."
“We don’t have to talk about it, Dean. You’re clearly uncomfortable,” Cas murmurs, eyes fixed on his screen as if Dean isn’t having a crisis right now.
"’M tired."
“You’re a smartass, you know that?” Dean said, a grin sliding into place.
Castiel's hands cup his cheeks, "I owe you an apology"
Cas turned to Dean with his kitten glare. "Dean thinks I'm four feet."
"We could see him shifting in his seat every time you started looking a little nervous." Anna grinned. "You guys are so adorable."
Castiel’s hand stops halfway in the air and he glances at Dean, a brow quirked his way.
Dean slides his fingers through Cas's hair, his throat closing up a little from the gravity of what just happened, "I thought I lost you forever, Cas," he chokes out, holding Cas a little closer.
“We’re trying to be considerate, Dean,” Sam emerges from the kitchen, nursing a mug of mountain tea or whatever crap is that he drinks. “But if you keep trying to repress and push us away it won’t work.”
"Because I don't!" Dean snaps. "Goddammit, Cas, I'm not a fucking mind reader!"
“You know what? Fuck you,” he grouses, annoyed. “You think you’ve got me all figured out? Well, news flash asshole, you’re not the only one who has changed in the past three years.”
"S' gonna be okay, Cas." Dean smiles softly, "You can't get worked up over me dying 'cause I have the reputation of biting the dust a lot."
“Find out anything I can about Sam.” Cas replies. “We already have angels scouring the premises for any indication of where he is. There are only so many places they can hide him. It would be easier if Sam tried to communicate to me.”
Hope that was worth the wait! Let me know what you thought in the comments.
Dean pried his eyes open, not knowing when it was that he closed it, to realize Cas’s hands were cupping his face, "What I am trying to say is, I have caused you nothing but pain. The angels,
Castiel rolled his eyes, "You do realize it's one in the morning, don't you?"
Dean chuckles, albeit to hysterical from the adrenaline crash, "Sweetheart," he says, as sweetly as he can, watching the familiar warmth bloom in Cas' eyes. "You could test drop on me from heaven and crash on top of Baby and I still wouldn't be mad."
"Cas?" Dean murmurs sleepily, rolling over and resting his head on Castiel's lap.
"I'm keeping an eye out for cases, Dean. Haven't heard a single thing from anywhere."
He picks up his phone and calls Sam, knowing it won't be much long before the two bars of reception fades away.
“The hell, Cas?” Dean ripped his arm away from Cas’s hold. “You just let her drain you? What were you thinking?”
"Are you looking for a date?" he asked.
Dean threw an arm around Castiel's shoulder, "Our boss is still standing here."
“I felt your soul call out to me,” Cas replied, as though he was talking about the weather.
Hope. It’s a mistake.
"That's where you are mistaken, brother." Castiel says, "I'm no leader and no one is expected to follow me."
list. "How are your intentions any better than Raphael's?"
"Lie down, Cas," Dean said, or at least he tried, but his tongue was feeling all slosh-y in his mouth.
"Guys, be quiet," Sam pulled up Rowena's email through his phone. He read through the article and as far as he could tell, it sounded legitimate. "Two bodies found in Jerseyville, Illinois, both male, in their late thirties, married. Autopsy revealed no cause of death."
"Don't start now," Sam says, the hint of an eye roll in his voice. "Anyways, how's the place?"
"You started picking fights with someone at the bar and he punched you. You might also have a black eye in the morning."
Dean pulled back, his face breaking into a grin. "Castiel Novak, you are the best."
Dean laughs, a soft and lovely thing. He wraps a hand around Castiel's wrist, leading them towards the bed.
Dean nods. "Where did this one open to?"
Dean stares at some show about a girl and her roommates running on the TV while the sound of Cas and Sam chatting lulls him to sleep. The last thing he remembers before being pulled under is the covers being drawn over him and a hand on his shoulder. Somehow, he knows it’s Cas.
in decades, and some days, the cold fist of memories that close around his heart shatters something inside of him.
Castiel dropped the box with a jolt, the thing landing straight on his right foot.
“We all know how that went.” Charlie pointed out. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you two decide to elope one fine morning.”
Sam tapped his feet against the floor, feeling like he was intruding on something he wasn't supposed to. He evaluated his options to get out of the room without gaining any attention and his eyes zeroed in on the car keys sitting on the table
Dean palms his coat pocket one last time, feeling the metal of the angel blade against his palm and walks over to where Cas, Camael and that one angel, Nemiah, are standing.
“It scares me how less you appreciate yourself,” Castiel pulled his knees to his chest.
couldn’t be more distant from the truth. To Castiel, knowing Dean for five years should have meant nothing compared to his eternal existence, but it meant more than any event since the supernova has meant to him. But, Cas has offered nothing but betrayal and pain to Dean ever since they met, so the lie that slips out of Dean’s lips leaves a bittersweet ache of its own.
Castiel works up the courage to talk to Zachariah about Sam's suggestion about four times, backing down during each of them, too scared of the repercussions. Finally, when Zachariah adjourns the meeting, Castiel waits until all the angels leave to make the suggestion.
“About what?” Dean asked. There was something about the way Dean was holding himself, taut and fidgety. Sam knew his brother well enough to know it was guilt. Cas looked almost as worse, and Sam realized he was living with two ticking time bombs, now the bet was on which one exploded first.
"He's my boss."
wail.
Castiel scowls, "What do you mean?"
“Cas, can you fly us over by tomorrow morning?” Dean asks.
“More records should come up as you search since the library holds very ancient archives,” Cas assured. “Meanwhile, I think it is better that we pursue some other lead.”
He has had enough time to turn it around in his head, and thinking about how Cas was holding in all of that…it kills him. Dean's not going to repeat the same mistakes.
"Okay, I have some news."
"Good. That's great," Dean fumbles, reaching for his phone lying on the coffee table. He un-mutes it, shifting closer to Cas and holding the device facing them.
Two sets of approaching footsteps catch Castiel's attention and even without seeing or hearing him, Castiel can feel Dean's soul; the flicker glow of it brightening as he gets closer.
"Hi." Dean smiled lightly.
Sam hummed, twirling a piece of cloth from now what they know as Irene's down in his hand, “We should search Irene’s place. See if we find anything off.”
“There’s nothing to apologize for,” Castiel reassures, his chest tightening. “I should have said something. It’s just, there’s–” the rest of the words simply wouldn’t make it’s way out of his mouth because, honestly, what is he supposed to say?
“Dammit, Cas. Open up!” comes the voice from the other side of the door which he unmistakably recognizes as Dean.
He maneuvered the blade upwards and caught it in his fist, quickly cutting through the vines holding him bound.
Eileen lets out a tiny laugh and Dean smiles a little.
“No it’s not.” Dean says, “I’m the eldest and that’s my verdict. Now shut your face.”
Somehow, that one hurt the most.
Cas mutters, amusement lacing his voice.
“Human mind works in disturbing ways. In a moment of desperation what one might do can’t be predicted,” Cas said, rolling his eyes at Dean’s grimace.
Cas nods, “In a minute.”
“What about brown eyes over there?” Jaime ignores him as always, pointing somewhere over his shoulder. “He’s got that real nice tan skin and–”
"You don't have to," he assured. "I'm proud of you for who you are, not what you do."
“I hope I at least made your list.” Cas smiled, a hint of mischief in his tone.
"Something tells me we do," Sam says, "otherwise you wouldn't have hesitated turning us into dust."
The moment hangs heavy between them and Dean just lets it, taking in the importance of what he's holding in his arms. There was a time when he felt the trickle of it slipping through the crack between his fingers. But now, it all felt stupid; insignificant. Now Dean knows there was never a question here, not when Cas' eyes reflect every little fear and anticipation and love Dean's own holds.
“No, and I have a feeling he won’t be back until the morning.”
He inhales sharply and mouths, “Now.”
Sam seemed to have some trouble breathing, as he sputtered unflatteringly, glaring intently at Dean, while Nadia broke into fits of giggles.
He had to try hard to keep the disappointment away from his face, knowing it won't be much long before they'd be loading up the trunk and watching as this town fades to distant memory in the background.
“I’ll let you eat it off me.”
Cas frowns at that, "He did?"
Castiel watches the squirrels climb up the trees and the birds fly back to their nests, and all of these creatures feel a different kind of love. He remembers sitting in the same spot surrounded by nature; staring at the sky, looking for answers from a God who didn't know them himself. His existence involved having blind faith, questioning where humanity chose to put their faith, and by the end of it all, Castiel found himself questioning his own faith. What he realizes now is that every query of his always led to the same answer.
Dean doesn't dare hope it's a reciprocated promise to his earlier claim—
"It's killing two birds with one rock," Cas huffed.
echoing like a prayer between their mouths. The feeling is divine and simple all at once, the tangible sides of two truths shifting into one.
"Caffeine," Cas observes sagely. "I have tasted the berries and beans but they were always sour."
The house is similar to others in the neighbourhood—generously furnished and neat. Castiel likes the abundance of houseplants that line the corners of the living room, lush and green leaves reflecting sunlight from the window. He hears Dean mutter something about the wallpaper and quietly nudges him to remain quiet, to no avail. They sit side by side on the couch as Linda sits on the loveseat opposite to them.
He's got that calculating lawyer eyes boring into Cas, and a part of Dean wants to snap at him to be nice and the other part wants to laugh. He does neither since Sam, Eileen and even Cas has voiced the opinion that Dean coddles people a lot, and he's not going to prove their point.
"Find anything?" Dean asks, voice raw against his throat.
"I never said you were!"
She shakes her head, disbelief written across her features. “That’s not humanly possible. Unless it’s Superman, I don’t think anyone can stick a hand into a guy’s chest with this much precision.”
"It's not for me."
Jess’ words.
Castiel senses another one of his brothers being expended as the tremor shakes heaven. The impact is huge enough to wake the entire galaxy, yet the humans sleep through it like any other day.
“I called you because Gabriel was supposed to help me pack and ended up bailing on me the last minute.”
Cas runs his hand up and down Dean's back, "Is this because of what happened to your mother?"
"Maybe we can go on a road trip, once we get a window," Dean said. "How do you feel about beaches?"
"Eddnians are not Pagans, Dean," Cas supplied. "They don't feed on their victims, they simply feed off the satisfaction of having solved a dilemma for someone."
“So, when are you two getting hitched?” Bobby raised a brow at the two of them.
He threw a couple of bills on the counter and got up, the room spinning as soon as his feet touched the floor. Dean pushed past the noisy crowd, suddenly everything too bright and loud. Rubbing his knuckles against his eyes, he walked out of the door, feeling his chest crumble like a brick wall. He wasn't going to cry in a fucking bar he didn't even know the name of.
"That was very impressive, Mr. Winchester." Her tone was neutral but there was warmth in her voice. "We will be discussing the further motions with Michael."
decapitated body lying at his feet.
An hour—and a short reasoning regarding why Cas can't bring a blanket along with him—later they are out of the door, the former angel dressed in one of Dean's henleys, black jeans that hangs a little low on his hips and a black zip up hoodie. Dean head is swimming in the feeling of Cas looking so in place in his clothes.
"I thought Nadia already gave us a story."
"The threat is removed, we're all safe," Cas assures, rubbing his hand up and down Dean's back. He all but melts into the touch, honey like warmth coiling in his gut.
"Tell me about it." Dean muttered. "You're literally my boss, it would be a disaster."
And if that doesn’t hurt.
"You know that can't happen, Cas." Dean sighed.
Charlie didn’t ask him anymore questions and Dean didn’t know if it was for the better or the worse. As much as he complained, he never really liked it when Charlie was quiet.
The soldiers are gathered around the table, glancing at each other and back at Castiel. Some of them have their eyes on Dean too, who didn't look as comfortable as the hunter usually did. The wounded soldiers watch from their respective makeshift hammocks, intently waiting for Castiel to speak. It is quite frankly overwhelming to say the least, the way an entire army of his kind looks up to him.
Dean grins over his shoulder, “Scout’s honor.”
“Now that’s just terrifying.” Dean said, and leaned forward to press a kiss to Cas’ cheek. “We’ll get married in a cave to make up for it.”
"Who's grandma are you trying to be?" Dean asks, trailing his fingers over the fabric. It’s feels really soft.
“That’s great! I wish you could’ve gotten to know us at a better time,” she smiles sadly. “But this place is good. They’ll love it here.”
"Then why won't you even look at me?" Cas asks, the words hanging heavy in the air. "You are the only thing I have left, Dean. It hurts to be next to you and still feel like a stranger."
“No, it’s alright.” He sucked in a sharp breath. “I began painting as a way to cope with the loneliness in my childhood. Michael was the prodigal child and Gabriel was, well...
Castiel’s grace wants to sprint forward and soothe the ache in Dean’s voice, but he resists in fear of overwhelming the man. Dean’s soul is troubled, every single memory from his time in hell etched into it, even when it shines so brightly. His father’s creations are marvelous, especially this particular one.
They headed out to the wedding hall after about half an hour of bordering between dressing up and taking their clothes off while making out like hormonal teenagers. Cas was grinning wide all throughout the ride, and Dean couldn’t help but mirror the smile.
He couldn’t help but embrace the tinge of relief that crept up his chest. Cas without grace meant there was no reason for him to disappear, not for a while at least. He was tired of dreading the days when he woke up and found Cas gone, when only they spent hours through the previous night sitting in the library, chatting about nothing and everything. It was a cycle—Cas came home, Cas found a new problem to fix, Cas left. Deep inside he knew there would come a day when the cycle turned into a race—one with a finish line.
"Let's just say, since you came along, I've never complained about going to work. Not even once." Dean pulled away, climbing out of his chair. "If I sit here anymore, I'll freeze my balls off."
“I’m going to Earth. As a human. And I want a life as such, no matter what decision Dean has made,” Castiel says, meeting Michael’s gaze. “I’m aware that is ungrateful of me to neglect the duties God–”
. Reach out and take it, maybe. Because Sam’s off on his run and the bunker is so quiet, it feels as though the whole universe is just him and Cas at the moment, and it’s all just too much. Lucky for him, Cas has his back. He places his hand over Dean’s, his long fingers curling around Dean’s palm.
“What’s next, Sam?” Nadia asked, the question that has been dreading him for a while now.
Dean jumps, nearly knocking himself off his chair. When he turns around, he does so with a gun in his hand, pointed straight at Castiel’s chest.
"Cas, he was a mess," Sam says, exasperation evident in his voice. "He was living on autopilot, and I couldn't count on both hands the days I found him passed out drunk off his ass."
Cas rolled his eyes, “Give yourself some credit.”
"Of course, I do," Cas frowns. "Why would you doubt
spilling out of the speakers. Castiel recognizes the cassette tape as one of the first ones he obtained a few months after he left. It seems as though the world is set out to remind Castiel how much, and how quickly, the time has passed, but he can’t find it in himself to care. Even if he has not actively burned down the bridges, they were hanging by a splintered piece of rope, and Castiel has accepted it’s way past mending.
Cas reaches his hand up to press against Dean's cheek, "Please watch the road, Dean," he murmurs softly, turning his face.
"You guys can come in," Louisa was at the door again. "Be gentle with her please, you understand how hard it must be…"
“Oh,” Dean said eloquently as they pulled apart. Words were hard, sue him.
"Dean, can I have your number?" Cas asked, glancing up at Dean.
because having hope always ends in a heavy plot of disappointment. He's not planning to jinx it this time if he can.
"You're quite known for doing the same," Castiel replied, smiling even when Dean can't see him. "How are you feeling, Dean?"
“I would find better ways if that were the case,” Rowena answers. “Now, how are you boys doing? Is the not-angel still with you?”
"I thought that was already established from all the appreciation you received." Cas said, arms wrapping around his waist, and Dean debated whether to kiss him or kick him in the shin.
Dean looks around and sees her picking up a string of snowflake lights. "Stay with her," Dean tells Jo and pushes the cart towards the grocery section.
"You ever been to the beach, Cas?" Dean asked abruptly, the words coming out a little distorted from the way Castiel's palms were squeezing his face. He tried to pull away but Dean caught his wrists, keeping his hands there.
"Alright, okay…" Sam feverishly skims through the lore, "Demons are the only creatures who can go in and out of hell like that."
Right then, a knock echoed on the door, startling Gabriel into almost dropping the cookie jar.
,” Cas supplied. “This is unusual…”
"That's really romantic of you," Cas chuckled, quietly, nudging his nose against Dean's.
“He's the love of my life, Jo," Dean sighed, not caring he probably looked like a lovestruck princess. He swallowed down the tightness in his throat, suddenly feeling overwhelmed with everything he was feeling for Cas.
There is nowhere else to be—and another apocalypse couldn’t pull Dean away from Cas right now. Someone else will have to take one for the team because Dean Winchester is going to be busy kissing the only person he has wanted to kiss for the longest fucking time. Cas makes a small humming noise, and Dean’s brain packs up and goes on vacation. He wraps his arms around Cas’s shoulder, letting his weight drop back and pulls Cas down with him. Cas’s tongue—angel or not—is fucking
“Do you agents come across a lot of weird things?” Irene asked, but her eyes were now on Cas, who Dean noticed was busy reading the notice board next the door.
“What if this is not what God intended?”
“What?” Dean coughed around a mouthful of his wrap. “I never pray to you— well, not that often.”
“How unfortunate,” Cas says dryly, earning a chuckle from the two. He sighs, turning to Jaime, “So, how is the job going?”
“Right,” Dean scoffs. Even the ringing of his own blood in his ears is louder than ever, all the air in the room suddenly not enough for his lungs. “Just leave, Castiel.”
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” Sam muttered, his eyes widening just as the words left his mouth. "Shit, I didn't—"
“Uh, Cas. There’s something I gotta say,” he swallows. “I never told you why I asked you to…why I had to make you leave…”
“I’m not saying this might not be a trap.” Sam ushers.
"It's all good, Castiel," Irene chuckled. "I like a mouth on them."
There was a knock on the door behind him, "Cas?"
"Can I come over later in the day?" Dean asked, "I'll help you around with the cleaning."
“Irene, listen…” Sam began, tentatively reaching for the gun tucked in his pocket.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good, or else you'd have had no way to defend yourself when I tore you a new one," she pulled each of them into a hug.
part didn’t require much acting. Even then, his infinite angelic wisdom gave him the advantage of the right angles to hold and the right amount of force to apply. Eventually, the knowledge faded away under the forgetful grip of humanity, but Castiel had acquired enough skill to earn a few hundred dollars at the least.
"It's not like you're
" Dean mocked in a high-pitched voice, grinning at the huff Sam threw his way.
Sam laughed, leaning back against the table and throwing an arm around Nadia, his eyes flitting around the crowd for one last time.
"Fuck, Cas. You can't say shit like that." Dean feels his heart hammering in his chest.
"It was nice getting to know you, Dean." Cas said, leaning against the door frame. "I will see you around at the office."
"It's not chaperoning, man!" Dean snaps. "What's gotten into you?"
Castiel wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrist, pulling their lips apart for a moment. “Will you fuck me, Dean?”
“You’ve always been different, Castiel. You have empathized with humanity in a way any angel has not managed to,” Michael says softly. “Before the war began, you used to love visiting earth just to observe and listen. A part of you is indeed tethered to the place. That is why your grace in turn clasped itself to there.”
Dean blanched, not expecting
It feels too much. He couldn’t begin to explain the Cas shaped longing that has coiled itself around Dean's heart for a long time now. He doesn't know how.
“Yeah.” Sam says, “Yeah, he is.”
"Oh my God, introduce us!" Another voice exclaimed, this time female.
"They what?"
"You said," he swallows down the lump in his throat. "You said you couldn't have it, have
Dean holds him tighter, “There’s nothing you could’ve done, Cas.”
"Still with the air quotes," Dean chuckles, and his smile is so fond, Castiel has to remind himself not to go searching behind the meaning of it all.
“So, she’s gained more power from the two deaths that followed,” Dean noted. “She’s gonna keep killing people over petty things for more power ‘cause I don’t think she wants to take a nap anymore now that she’s finally up after all these years.”
"Are you not going to pursue her?"
The now familiar silence falls again and Dean peaks at Cas, not having the energy to sit up. Cas pulls off his coat and throws it on the arm of the couch like he has a personal vendetta against the thing. He sighs, running a hand through his hair, messing up the strands even more.
“Love you too.”
Lunch is uncharacteristically quiet, Cas poking at his meatballs looking up only once in a while to throw cold glances Dean's way. Dean runs and reruns everything he said to Cas in his head, trying to figure out if he messed up somewhere.
“Oh my God,” Nadia sat upright, “Emily had gotten an offer for a job in Sweden. Jacob wouldn’t let her go.”
A thin line formed between Dean's brows, "Huh. Dunno. Why din't we go, Sammy?"
“Yes, we can do that,” Cas walked closer, holding out a glass of water and two pills. “Take this first.”
Castiel doesn’t reply, not that he would be able to in the moment. There is no more than a foot of distance separating them, and from this up close, Cas can see the freckles dusted across the bridge of Dean’s nose. The constellations that he had handcrafted during the creation of the universe doesn’t stand a chance. Dean lowers his hand, fingers brushing Cas’s arm on the way, sending sparks of lightning down to his spine. Cas knows he should look away, but he can’t bring himself to rip his gaze away.
Cas nodded, placing a hand tentatively on Dean's cheek, "Can you open your eyes, Dean?" he asked softly.
"Yeah, she was hitting on you," Dean says absently, remembering how he was tempted to tip her less just out of sheer spite. "Anyways, do you wanna go there for lunch?"
Castiel dragged Dean to the dance floor before he could change his mind. He placed a hand on Dean's waist, taking Dean's hand in the other.
There are two paths ahead of him, to follow the familiar road to the bunker and to the man he considers home. Or turn away and live a life where he can watch and protect the people he owed to protect all those years ago, but only from afar. He smiles at the absurdity of it all—if it were another life, Castiel would have turned his back on Sam and Dean because it would be the right thing to do. Now though, he is weakened by the hold of humane emotions, even with all his powers restored.
"Yeah, I ain't gonna do that," Joseph snorts. "Anyways, try not to get yourself killed out there, kid."
"Oh, Dean." Sam said, tone dripping with sympathy. "You got a crush, don't you?"
“Been trying for a while now. I don’t know what this bitch has me tied to,” Dean squirmed around, possibly trying to untie himself.
"Rosie, the cactus," Dean muses, "got a ring to it."
“No,” Camael shakes his head.
I know I'm a tad bit late, so sorry for that. Got caught up in some work. Anyways, hope you enjoy!
“Why?” Dean frowned. “This way’s fine. Who said it’s not?”
"I said so because I didn't want you to think I had feelings for you, in case that is not what you wanted." Castiel replied truthfully. "I didn't want to lose you by forcing something you did not wish for ."
"Indeed, I have decided to bless you with my presence, Castiel." Gabriel emerged from the kitchen, hand dipped in the cookie jar. "You got any vodka?"
“Seriously, Dean? You managed to piss him off this early in the day?”
“It was just a story,” Castiel stated, leaving Dean to decipher it.
Dean reminds himself. In his defense, the girl's got strength on her.
“Cas, what are you guys gonna do?” she called out. Smart.
“Brother, our own kin is fighting against each other and plotting the destruction of our father’s creation.” Castiel adds, “We have no right to consider ourselves any superior than humanity.”
“Good, great. Real good.” Sam stuttered. “It’s great. Good.”
“I’m gonna leave you here,” Dean sneered, glaring at his brother. “Gonna block your number and just leave you behind.”
Dean sighs, annoyed, “For what exactly?”
“I’m as alright as it can get, Cas.” He says, “Now if you excuse me, we got a demon to kill.” He walks past Cas out of the kitchen, smacking the angel’s ass on the way out. Dean chuckles when Cas yelps in surprise.
“Well, shit,” Sam pursed his lips. “Dean’s probably got the blade in his sleeve but we gotta wake him up.”
“Dean, seriously, if you need me to step in—”
Dean stiffened underneath his hands, and Castiel feared for a moment that Dean's might have recognized his more than physical feelings for him. But then, Dean let out a soft laugh.
"No, everyone loved Issac," Terra's words followed a whimper, and Louisa shushed her gently, running her fingers through her hair.
"Oh, for fuck's sake!" he snapped, anger and panic taking over him. "This is not about any of that. We have a plan and we're gonna stick to it. If you're too good to be my– pretend to be my husband then just say it."
"Dean," he swallows. "Thanks for uh–"
"Seriously, how do you know gossip about literally everything?" Anna cocked a brow.
“I don’t want to buy any weed.” Castiel deadpanned, his eyes fixed on his cup.
“He’s staying back to research on the angel, in case it shows up again.” Sam says. “We gotta be prepared, Dean. I mean, it’s not like we have an exorcism tucked in our sleeve-”
"Your whole life is in the city, man." Dean said, "You could've gotten a nice penthouse or something, right in the middle of the city."
"Man, Lisa's nice and everything, and really hot, but something didn't click, you know?"
Packing took longer than expected, further delaying dinner. Castiel sat back and watched as Dean moved around the kitchen like a professional, sprinkling things into a pan and humming to some tune in his head.
“That’s the thing, Cas. You got your own crap to deal with and I shouldn’t dump my baggage on you.” Cas opens his mouth to say something but Dean shakes his head. “I know that ain’t gonna stop you ‘cause you’re too good. So let me shoulder some of your weight too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
the mark drove me crazy, you said you'd stay," Dean spoke up, eyes fixed far away. "Did you mean it?"
The tent in the center of the line of tents opens and an angel comes rushing out, sending Dean's hands to his blade. A look from Cas makes him drop his hands, not far away enough to be letting his guard down.
*****
Strong waves of tension roll out of Dean’s soul and Castiel’s grace responds equally. He contains the urge to have some sort of contact with the man; to ease away the discomfort.
“I have found you to be very adamant.” Castiel replies.
"All right. Since that's settled, I'm heading to bed. Long day ahead." Sam suddenly spoke, reminding them there were more than just the two of them in the room. From the look on Dean’s face, he too seemed to have forgotten.
"Look, I know we're sweet on each other and everything, but this is so much more than us. You gotta let me do what I have to." Dean counters. "It's just a quick trip, I'll be fine. I know it's hard for you but we just gotta trust each other to not die."
Dean’s head hurts, his whole body does. A part of him wants to stop so badly, to drop the blade and fall to his knees and just disappear. And the other part of him wants to feel the tender flesh under his fingers, to watch as he gets to rip apart souls like it’s just another toy.
The joke falls flat, but Cas still smiles, and Dean wants to ask him a hundred million questions, but he can't seem to unglue his tongue from the roof of his mouth. Cas gets on his feet and extends a hand to him, helping Dean up. He flops down onto the bed and pats the mattress, gesturing for Cas to sit.
“You are not convinced.”
“All done,” Sam said, and moved to pack up the first aid kit. “I think you’ll be alright to sleep now. Though, I’m gonna wake you up every couple of hours just to be sure.”
Castiel kicked off his shoes and sat on Dean's bed, crossing his feet. Dean sat down next to him, their knees knocking together.
“Awh Cas, don’t be like that,” Dean nudged Cas before turning to Sam. “I didn’t let him do the dishes. He’s pissed about that.”
"Well, shit, I kind of stomped out of there after the coroner couldn't give me anything on the cause of death."
Cas meets his eyes, tired and hollow. "I cannot let you out until I'm sure you're completely cured."
——————
Sam swallows, "We have the
“Ah, I believe children who grow up relatively alone make up imaginary friends to cope with their loneliness,” Cas hums. “It makes sense that Sam had one.”
"That's understandable, Dean," Castiel offered him a calming smile, which was partly a result of his own relief but Dean didn't have to know that.
"Go crazy, buddy," Dean chuckles, and that's all the permission Cas seems to need.
When Cas doesn't answer him and keeps inspecting the ground, Dean cups his jaw with his free hand, lifting his gaze up. "You know, I'm not the poster boy for communication, but we've had our fair share of fights. So, tell me if something is bothering you."
"Huh, Nadia was right," Sam said, eyes fixed on the avalanche of gift baskets sitting on the porch steps.
“You have to know I cannot do that.” Castiel says, his shoulders dropping. He senses the way Dean’s soul flares up, reaching out to him. Castiel meets Dean’s eyes, “I have a mission, Dean. I have orders to follow and tasks to accomplish. That is the purpose of my life.”
"Oh," Sam sighs, "Talk to me."
“Good talk,” he muttered, turning to the first door on the right.
"Yes, Commander," Camael gathers the weapons and heads outside, the rest of the angels following him.
"What are your wings like?"
“Those are the heavens for all the souls residing in here.” Cas says. “Each room inside the building opens into a region of its own where souls get to live out their good memories and fantasies.”
“Hey, that’s not true,” Eileen calls from somewhere in the kitchen. “I’m Switzerland.”
“Gabriel.”
“Yeah, something like that,” he nodded. “Probably ’cause I’ve never had anything this good.”
"Burgers make you very happy, I know," Dean mumbled.
"Cas, hey," Dean chuckles, grabbing his shoulder. "He's just being a bitch, don't worry about it. I know you won't hack me in my sleep."
"Oh, save the name dropping and speech, Sam," she waved her hand in dismissal. "I've been around since forever, and you know what hasn't changed even after all this time?
"Whatever you choose to do, I will be there with you." Cas says, and continues after a beat of silence, "I love you so much."
He has no answers to give Cas. No explanations, no excuses. Cas means the world to him and every second he spends next to Cas kills him slowly. It shouldn't hurt this much, not when he knows he doesn't deserve it. He's not drunk enough to grab Cas and kiss him but not sober enough to process everything he has been feeling for Cas since that barn in bumfuck, Illinois.
For a selfish moment he thought about throwing caution to the wind and just kissing Castiel. It seemed so easy like this. When Cas was an angel, Dean still loved him the same, but there was something unreachable about him. There always remained an invisible barrier, maybe it was his own fear that Cas being an angel, would never feel the way Dean did. He was a soldier after all, and Dean knew what that was like, courtesy of John Winchester. Now though, Cas felt reachable, soft around the edges even—like all Dean had to do was
idea that was going to affect his sanity, “Hold my hand,” he muttered. “That’ll make us look couple-y.”
"Can I bring the blanket?" Cas asks quietly, sending Dean’s heart flopping around in his chest in one epic gymnastic routine.
“Do you remember the Djinn case I mentioned?” Dean nods. “She and her family were the victims. I was able to save Jamie and her brother Ivan, but the parents... it was too late.”
Castiel grimaces and swings his machete, the tails falling to the floor in a clean cut. The fire around them has started to spread further, smoke rising to the sky and turning the clearing dense. Sweat pools at the back of Castiel’s neck as he digs in his duffel for the lighter fluid.
Cas gapes at him long enough for Dean to lose his last bit of patience. He grabs him by the back of his neck and kisses him, hard and desperate. He doesn’t need to feel gentle.
"Sam's not picking up. I left him a voicemail," Jo informs.
"Sure, I got some snow. Should be nice and melted by now," he elbows her. "Get offa me, Joanna."
“Is this okay?” Cas asked, ever the considerate one.
Dean and Cas got separated somewhere along the line, and they ended up in different cars on their way to the reception. He pulled out his phone to text him, only to see a message from Cas three minutes ago.
"If we split we can cover more—"
"Look what I bought you," he slides into the bed as Cas rolls around under the blankets to a position that's half vertical.
"That's a promise I can't make," Cas murmured. "Beyond everything, I consider you my best friend, Dean. I don't want to lose you either. So I'll try to be better at
Dean's up and running with dental floss and crappy drugstore bandages holding him together, but his heart is dead and battered, the pieces so far scattered away, there's nothing left to be picked up and stitched together. The night goes colder and Dean has so much to tell Cas, so much to let out of his chest. But none of those thousand things are said again.
“You didn’t bother to tell me at least?” Bobby asks, “All this time when you were running off with this and that, you were pulling this crap?”
"Cas, are you– this is–"
“You cannot tell me heaven is in favor of letting the devil walk the earth.”
“We all did,” Irene smiled sadly. “All we can do now is move on. I’m just hoping Emily and Terra are strong enough to get through this.”
"Move over, Gordon Ramsey. I got this." Dean grabbed the spatula from Sam and flipped the sizzling bacon.
“I’m afraid I might not have an answer.” He knows that for sure, since nothing in his immortal life is making any sense right now.
"Don't you think the cabin is lacking a bit of greenery?" Cas asks.
"Of course. You too must have heard his prayers."
“Could check up on his kids once in a while,” Dean grumbles.
"Okay, say something in Russian."
“The demons were fighting off Raphael’s angels in the other crypts because Alaistair said he would take you and Castiel.” Ruby says, looking behind her over her shoulder. “Once they heard about you killing Alaistair, they packed up their stuff and decided to camp out here to guard the weapons.”
“Cas, keep them from stabbing each other.” Sam says to him, “I’m trusting you on this.”
"It's nothing, Cas, don't worry about—"
Sam emptied his credit card and they drove back to their apartment in a hurry to hide the ring before Jess got back from her shift.
He narrowed his eyes, “And?”
"There is so much you don't understand, Dean," Castiel replies, and if Dean's words offended him, he manages to keep it out of his tone. Either that or he simply does not care what Dean thinks.
"You're good, man," Dean pats his shoulder. "I gotta take off. I'll let you get back to your carrots."
"Okay." Castiel pushes himself back against the headboard, his muscles protesting the movement.
Sam rolls his eyes, “Let’s see you try, then.”
“Hey, the whole motel could hear you two arguing,” Sam countered. “And then it got silent...”
—and Dean doesn't want Cas to leave so he keeps his mouth shut. The bridge ahead of them is one long road of potholes and thorns, getting closer and closer until the time to burn it will inevitably fall over their heads like an anvil, but for now, they're good.
Ruby tapped her fingers on the table, "How is Mr. Adams?"
They step around the strewn pieces of the collapsed tent into the woods outside to find many of the sheds in a similar condition — tousled up and buried under clouds of dust — with his brothers and sisters climbing their way out of the chaos. Castiel locates Camael in the crowd and walks towards him.
"Don't really have a preference for spectators when I'm spilling my dignity everywhere," he pants, gritting his teeth through the burn in his chest.
“Eat shit,” Sam muttered, lacking much heat. “Dean, cut yourself out.”
"Just some stupid thoughts," Dean replies.
The silence is not as unnerving as he had imagined, even the absence of something small but habitual, like the ticking of a clock somehow calming. Dean looks up at the ceiling as he lies back on the slightly dusty but soft mattress, wondering if the complete stillness would start to get eerie as the day grows dark.
"Are these two pathetic humans the ones that matter, Castiel?" she questioned. "How many times are you going to rip yourself apart to help them? How many pieces of you are you going to let them shatter in the name of saving this hopeless world?"
"God?" Dean asks, dumbly. Can't blame a guy for being a little out of it in a situation like the one he's in.
"Can't come off too desperate now, can I?" Dean laughs. "You got any plans tonight?"
“She is the one who pointed us towards this case. She’s a witch,” Castiel replied. Nadia’s face lit up with the same glee he was accustomed to seeing on Dean’s face when he found something childishly entertaining. Castiel rolled his eyes, “No, she does not have a pointed hat or a broomstick.
“You won’t.” Castiel replied, knowing that he trusted Dean with his body. “Please.”
“Well, there isn’t even a single person in this town who has it in for the Trentons,” Nadia said. “You wouldn’t doubt it if you saw the amount of casseroles and bouquets at their doorstep.”
Camael stares at him but raises a hand and illuminates the wardings on the wall surrounding the crypt.
He catches a ride to Sioux Falls, hence having enough time to make up some explanation on how he's topside. Dean closes his eyes for what feels like a second and he's already drifting off. A flash of something dark, something like wings, wakes him up accompanied by the same kind of calmness that he remembers from back in hell. He sits up straight on the leans against the floppy seat of the truck, legs shaking as he wipes the sweat off his face.
"I'm sorry, Dean." Fuck, he hates when Cas looks sad.
All in all, it could have gone worse.
“An entrance can only be set up from heaven.” Cas explains. “This is a system that used to prevail back when my father used to be present. When certain humans have done exquisite service to humanity, angels themselves set up the path to escort them to heaven, in their mortal forms if they desire. Unfortunately, humanity has gone too far down the path of crime-”
Cas sighed, “Of course. It’s not as though every case isn’t a trap in a sense.”
Dean traced the tip of his forefinger along the even plain of his skin where once the Mark remained etched to, red and blotchy, the source of all the anger and hatred that brewed in his chest. He liked to believe so, instead of the other louder, stinging thought that maybe the Mark had nothing to do with what he did—
"Yeah, probably why he flirted with me."
then he doesn't say anything. "As I was saying, we can talk to both the witnesses but I don't think Bettelheim would give us anything."
"Nope, none of that," Dean shuts him off. "You need better rest today. We can switch tomorrow if you want."
Nadia sighed, albeit dramatically, “Way to ruin it for me.”
he's more than ready to fall.
she signs, breathing heavily.
“I wish I could help,” Cas murmured, his voice quiet like a helpless child.
"I will arrange it." Camael says, and walks away.
"Samuel Campbell." The man held out his hand and Dean shook it. "I have to say, you crossed our expectations, which wasn't a hectic task considering how moderate it was. Nonetheless, good job." With that, he walked away.
The bar is rather crowded for a Tuesday evening, some form of sport—
Dean winces, “Shit, I’m so sorry, man. I didn’t know, and I shouldn’t have–”
Dean laughs, "Nah, but we get that a lot." He pats her on the back and stands on his feet, looking around the debauched living room "We could help you clean."
"You do, sweetheart," he murmured, gently tugging at Cas's hand to get him to look at Dean. "Wherever me and Sam are, that's your home too. You're a part of this, like it or not."
"Smells? Really?" she laughed, eyes glinting. "No, nothing weird. Well, except for this whole case…"
“We heard the police hit a dead-end with the investigation of the deaths,” Cas said, the sudden shift of subject throwing them off, if it’s anything to say by the look on their faces. Dean didn’t even blink; he was used to Cas’s bluntness. “What do you think happened to the two men?”
The game begins and Castiel makes a great effort to pretend he’s making an actual effort. A handful of minutes later, nearly all of the strips have been potted and Castiel is losing just as planned. His opponent laughs every time Castiel fails to pot a ball and the strategist in him smugly revels a little.
“Fuck!” Castiel cried out as Dean’s fingers brushed his prostate. “Dean, more... I need...“
"Perhaps. But you still need-" Castiel cuts off, pinpointing the exact moment the same thought crosses his and Dean's mind. "No."
"Yes."
And that feels like a good segway in his head to talk about the talk they will have to at some point.
“Oh, I’m sure we have time to discuss all that in the future,” Luke waves his hand in dismissal. “It’s Gabriel, bee tee dubs. Luke’s just an alias.”
. You know that's a load of bullshit, right?"
She smiled sympathetically, "Well, it was worth a shot." She topped him before sliding off to another customer.
"Yeah, but you'll be soon," he says, the chipper in his tone so forced, his throat feels raw, "once we find your grace."
