He holds his charcoal up to his canvas, and takes one more glance. The model is looking at him now, peering at him from under blond lashes, a small quirk at the corner of his mouth. Sherlock swallows, hard. It hurts. Everywhere.
“Let’s get something to eat. I’m starving.”
“Hey,” John joked, “at least I wasn’t wearing a jumper, too.”
“I understand if you have certain expectations of tonight, John. I may be inexperienced but I am not stupid.”
“Where should we put the photograph, Imogen?”

“God, Sherlock.”
James nodded and let his arms fall to his sides but he maintained his ramrod posture and held his head high. “My instinct was to find a secure place to regroup and consider what action to take. I won’t inconvenience you, though. I’ll be on my way as soon as I’ve thanked John for his hospitality.”
Sherlock’s hips were just high enough off the bed to give his cock room to slide back and forth, but he needed more friction. He tried to reach underneath himself, but John moved with him and grabbed his wrist.
John had been expecting Copland or Brahms or Weber or Debussy, all who had written beautiful clarinet pieces, but what he got was Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. The song sounded incomplete without the other instruments playing, but Sherlock played it poignantly, and with a grace and precision that only Sherlock could. After playing through the final chorus twice, Sherlock held the clarinet to his chest, took a deep breath, and bowed his head to the sound of John clapping.
“Well?” she asked, taking a sip from her own steaming cup.
A foot rub.
"Oh. Sure, okay. What kind of story?"
“Right?”
“I didn’t conspire, Sherlock. I have no harmful intention here. I wanted to help.”
“Cetus and Erebus, take Moringa to the huddle, and keep her there, in your sight. We will wait for the rest of the packs to arrive, and then we will depart for Pobeda.
“It hasn’t been wasted. I’ve enjoyed every moment.”
was ten feet into the restaurant, being led to their table by their hostess, and Sherlock was still standing at the podium blinking into the middle-distance while echoes of his man’s name surged through his bloodstream.
Sherlock slipped one of his feet between John’s. “In theory,” he said, lowering his voice to a low rumble, “a lot of what people do in bed should seem taboo. At least, it always seemed that way to me. But now that I’ve got some idea of what it feels like to actually be intimate with someone I care about, nothing seems very off-putting.”
Sherlock took a deep breath, held it, bucked his hips, rolled and thrust, and with one, long, decadent moan, went rigid and came. John, still thrusting into Sherlock’s fist, cried out, “Oh fuck, oh yes,” and followed. They stayed there for a long while, stayed until their hearts had slowed and their breathing was easy, until Sherlock couldn’t stay inside John any longer and John had gooseflesh from the chill of the purple-grey night settling around them.
John brought flowers to dinner; flowers for Mummy. He also brought a decent bottle of wine and a box of truffles for Sherlock. Sherlock knew he was expected to serve them with the after dinner drinks, but he slipped the box into the pocket of his dinner jacket, instead, and ate all of them in his bed later that night.
Sherlock turned Paul’s hand over and leaned over his wrist, feigning a deep inhalation of the scent while rubbing his nose along Paul’s flesh. “The amber undertone is so sexy, don’t you think?”
John was pulling him down, holding him close, both of them panting
John finished his toast and stood up again. “I’m going to go home and talk to dad for a bit. You take a shower and call me when you’re ready, then I’ll come get you, and we’ll go to the mall.”
Sherlock waits until everyone is asleep, then begins the arduous process of unravelling the tooth from its seaweed prison. He has not seen it for such a long time, but it shines in the moonlight now the way it did that last day on Cassiopeia, the details every bit as radiant as they always have been. He holds the tooth up to the sky. He tilts it this way and that and notes the changes on its surface as it shifts: shiny now, golden, then brilliant, white, ivory, soft, and now glaring, sharp.
Sherlock shrugged. “The shorter one was still showing signs of sexual arousal, so whatever they were doing, he wasn’t satisfied. The taller one spent a lot of time fiddling with his cuffs, a very dismissive gesture considering his cuffs were already perfect, so he was trying to avoid his partner.”
“Olive oil. Lots of it.” He spread the dish towel down on the bed and crawled over it, stopping in front of Sherlock to kiss him. He kissed his lower lip, the corner of his mouth, his upper lip, talking in between each peck. “That wasn’t so bad, was it? ‒ don’t wanna hurt you ‒ want it to be so good for you ‒ wanna make you come so hard ‒”
As Sherlock talks, John relaxes into Sherlock’s wings, and starts to rub Sherlock’s cheek, and return his affection. He listens as Sherlock talks about how much he has missed him, and when Sherlock stops, John nods, and pulls back to see Sherlock’s eyes.
“Like I said, boring. You’re not in it. Keep going.”
“Then that’s what we’ll do. Now, though? We have something else to do.”
“How long have you been here?”
“Smart-ass. Mrs. Hudson left a lasagna and garlic bread. Or we can have chicken chili. Your pick.”
“Oh. It means, um, beautiful … farm … nation, mom.”
"Hm?"
“We don’t know what the person after me knows or what information he learned about me when he was at my house, but if he knows that John and I are friends, the two of you might not be safe. As I only just met Annette a few days ago, there’s no way anyone could know to look for me at her flat. She’s closer to the police than you are. Finally, staying with her would allow me to get out from under your feet.” James held Sherlock’s gaze as he finished speaking, his head held high.
“Why are you making tea?” John counters, although he knows that there is no question, no matter how direct, that Sherlock cannot weasel his way out of if he doesn't want to give an answer. John contemplates this and then lets out a small groan of recognition. “What have you done, Sherlock?”
“I must go to her.”
One large step closer to going home ...
They are survivors.
“Are you – are you close?”
Next to them, Erebus murmurs, “You can do this, my young sirs. You will do this, and be reunited, and the colony will be better for your efforts.” He shuffles away then, his shoulders sloped in sadness, he and Cetus on either side of Moringa, who spits and hisses at them as they lead her away.
, my love, I am so sorry. I couldn't help myself.
"No, she's right, though. No one would know for sure, should he vote to dismiss the allegations, if he did it for the right reasons." John has been quiet until now, but sees the way the numbers are aligning and gains confidence.
“Like what? It’s a coffee place.”
“Mike? Yeah, couple years now.”
“Abandonment?”
“Jesus fucking Christ, yes, I certainly do.”
John huffed out a laugh and shook his head, flopped onto his back, and said, “You're asking that
Sherlock tread water and calculated where John might reappear. It was much closer than he'd approximated. Three feet away, close enough to feel the currents John's legs created. John wiped a hand over his face, pushed his hair back, and blew a spray of water between them. Drops of water sat on his shoulders and collarbones, and clung to his eyelashes, dark and spiked into clumps. John's eyes were a very angry shade of blue. A furious shade.
“Mm, s'nice,” John sighs, and reaches down to run his fingers along Sherlock's scalp. “You're so good to me.”
“I was looking at Mycroft. He looks as if he has an icicle rammed up his bum. I think Anthea will be a good fit for him.”
Mycroft stops walking, wings behind his back. “Mm. I see. And what do you intend to do about the tooth, now?”
“I’ve created a monster, haven’t I?”
He felt and heard John rearrange himself at the end of the bed, and then felt a warm puff of breath on the back of his thigh. He bit down on the pad of his thumb. The anticipation was like no other aphrodisiac, not that he ever needed one.
"And I suppose you'll be taking one of those dates to the wedding?"
There was no sign of the other couple when they got back to the hotel, and Sherlock was relieved. He wished them well but didn't need to see the outcome of their night out. In the elevator, John stood close and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder, and when Sherlock kissed his hair, John made a happy humming sound and kissed his neck.
The big sisters he never had, indeed.
The free-falling hunter announces her arrival with an ear-splitting screech, extends her wings out from the sides of her body, adding drag to her descent, and reaches forward with her talons.
Dumbass?
"Got it."
“How do you do that? How do you know about my grandfather, and about Harry?”
Erebel shuffles over to John and lets him wipe her face. She turns around and backs herself up into the space between his feet. John lays one wing on her shoulder and puts the other one around Sherlock.
“Yes, absolutely. Very important work to do, in the ice cave, alone.”
“I’m fine.”
Sherlock blinked at him. “Not interested? Engaged? But that’s not right.”
“Stop the truck?”
“As fast as you want. As hard as you want.”
“Nothing. Just you.”
“A couple dozen. Stephen is a bartender there. Want me to see if he’s working tonight and have him keep an eye on things?”
"Needed to see who would be sleeping in it. You, me, or both of us."
“Nope. This is for Queen
Once tucked away in the privacy of their hideaway, John checks over their treasure and fusses over a few pieces that the wind has shifted. Sherlock loves this side of John, meticulous and nest-proud. He hovers nearby, utterly charmed as John mumbles under his breath about
“Oh. Would you rather not talk about it?” Sherlock turned over and mirrored John’s position so they were facing each other. It was hard to see John’s face in the dark but he could just make out the curve of his ear and cheek.
“Oh. What were you going to say?” Sherlock said, drawing circles on the tablecloth with his finger and looking up at John from under his lashes.
“I'm not loud,” Sherlock said through a fake pout. He loved ribbing John like this, and loved when John fell for it.
“You’re hurt,” he said, dialling the police. This close to the window he could see directly into Annette’s flat across the road, including most of the front room, part of the front door, and James, straightening his tie in a mirror.
“But about working with Moringa, I truly don’t know. I have never observed them together, but perhaps I was not looking carefully enough.”
“Having a party to celebrate three decades of a successful career is absurd?”
"How do you know the topic? It's just the regular half-moon meeting, I thought. Might be short. Seal patrol schedules, or shifting of the shelf, things like that."
“It will be.”
“Go ahead,” Kevin said. “I’m looking forward to hearing you explain this.”
He picked up the teapot and swirled it in slow circles, then poured himself a cup. He swirled the pot a bit more, then poured for John, who was devouring a piece of banana bread. John was quite sexy when he devoured things, if not a bit messy.
Sherlock waited until they had each ordered before unzipping and tugging off his coat. He tossed it on the coffee table in front of them and scooted closer to John, lifting his leg so he could rest his knee on John’s thigh.
“What kind of
“Do you want to stop?”

“What if I want to fuck you into the mattress?”
Sherlock sank back against the cushions and pressed himself up against John, tucking his legs up to the side, his knees on John’s warm, solid thigh. John ran his fingers up into the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck, combing through them, gently tugging and twirling them. Sherlock sipped his champagne and wondered if it was possible for a human to start purring. John’s fingers dipped under the collar of his shirt, his nails tracing patterns over smooth skin.
John stirred again, mumbling happy little contentments, and reached down for something he could swipe over their bellies. That done, he took Sherlock's face in one hand, stared at him for a good ten seconds, then kissed him. He climbed off the sofa, held out a hand to Sherlock, and said, “Come on. To bed.”
“Three more days, John.”
“It's the study of motion … without regard to its causes … unlike dynamics … which is the study of motion … and the forces that affect it.”
“Somewhere warm. Somewhere we can be together, openly. Florida? One of the Keys?”
“If you can do that without killing us afterward.”
“Excellent.”
Maude’s, Sherlock quickly observed, was insanely popular, and difficult to get into unless you had several hours to wait for your name to be called. Not a problem, the twenty-something hipster hostess ensured them. Have a seat at the bar, and you’d be able to eat and drink your fill long before your name is called for a table.
Over the next few days, Sherlock showed no interest in the invitation, or anything else in the pile. Perhaps, John thought, he needed a subtle prompt. He waited for Sherlock to make himself available, which meant flopping over on the couch, and facing the room for a brief interlude.
“How are you doing, gorgeous?”
to look for, seek, search, hunt for, quest, search, hunt
“Are you hungry?”
"What? Oh, yeah, there were lots of bullets, and the doctor soldier helped take care of the soldiers who were hit by bullets, or shrapnel, or were caught in bombs, things like that. All sorts of things. But, one day the doctor soldier was himself hit by a bullet, and he had to leave the war and go home."
“I would quite like to excuse you, to be perfectly honest. I like your friend. I think you should make yourself scarce now.”
And what of the bigger issues? He was going to see John naked when John moved in. Well, actually, he’d see John naked the first night of their married life, wouldn’t he? And the only reason John would be naked would be because they would be expected to have sexual relations, and what was Sherlock going to do about that? He’d have to be naked, too. Oh, there’d be so much skin-to-skin contact, and Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d be able to cope with that, not if it meant ceding control of his body to John and losing control of his mind.
“Duck tongues, and wood oven roasted pig face.”
“God, no, of course you’re not a rock. That’s not what I meant. You’re… you’re … very much not a rock.”
, Sherlock.”
I think I mentioned this in the last chapter, but it's worth reiterating, as it applies to this chapter, too. When I first started this I wasn't completely sure what a juvenile emperor peng looked like. I gave John his coloured underbill stripe as a point of contrast to Sherlock, who hadn't physically matured as much as John at that point.
John crossed the room, shaking his head, and made a sound along the lines of ‘nuh-uh,’ before stopping right in front of Sherlock and getting a very serious look on his face.
“Do you know why I did all those things?”
“Tied! What do the rules say about breaking a tie? Do neither of us get our ask, or do we both? It's such a waste!”
He was contemplating how much longer this charade might last when Harry returned, smelling like cigarette smoke and something stronger than coffee. She did a double take at the addition to the party since she'd left, and introduced herself to Sarah.
Sarah nodded and smiled at Sherlock. He had to admit, it was a genuine enough smile, and she hadn’t done anything to warrant a negative reaction from him. She wasn’t even remotely flirting with John.
So Sherlock washed, and John dried, and made circuits around the kitchen as he put things away in their proper places. When the last fork was lying on its side next to all the other forks in the plastic utensil divider in the second drawer to the left of the sink, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock from behind, and kissed his shoulder.
He stood up and pulled on his briefs and his jeans, then started rummaging through the clothes in his duffel bag for a clean shirt.
Sherlock considered, then let go of John’s thick erection and shuffled back between his legs. He let his mouth flood, then took John in, loose and sloppy, bumping his shaft over his tongue and teeth, smearing John with saliva.
John flipped over again, and jostled around until his cock was a few inches from Sherlock's mouth, making it easy for Sherlock to lean in and press his nose into John’s pelvis. He took a deep breath, then used his tongue to draw John’s plump cock between his lips and into his mouth. He felt John’s hand wrap around the base of his erection, and his tongue lick up the shaft, again, and again, teasing him.
You scared me! Sherl, you can’t just go around sneaking up on pengs like that!”
“Jesus, no. Being here with you, just kissing you, touching you, God, I can't even tell you how good it is.”
“How do you know I’m thinking too much?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sometimes we write about the things we wish we had, especially when it seems highly improbable we'll ever have them.
“I KNOW!” John stands on Sherlock’s feet now, back to front, the top of his head crammed under Sherlock’s bill. “What on earth and sea would she need our feathers for? And fish bones? And a seal tooth?”
Three more tight sucks and John’s fingers started to wander between Sherlock’s thighs and low, down over his balls, stroking his perineum. Sherlock shuddered and moaned and John stopped. “Did the captain let him come, Sherlock? Did he touch him? Did he suck him like I suck you?”
The emperor standing left of the centre leans over and speaks in a low tone to the one in the middle. He in turn nods, then turns to the one on his other side, and confers with her. She nods. The communication passes down each side of the arc, each emperor turning to his or her neighbour, sometimes turning back for another word, restrained in their movements by the formality of the process.
He could hear Sherlock’s footsteps as he moved from room to room, dimmer, louder, depending on where he went. Sherlock made his way upstairs, and John pressed his forehead against the dirty glass pane, and closed his eyes.
John shifted off Sherlock to find his phone, and Sherlock turned over again. John tapped at the screen, started laughing, and flopped back down on top of Sherlock. “Sure you don't want to figure it out yourself?”
“Oh. I’ve still got the tooth. You were right. We need to tell Mycroft and Erebus and my father, and we need to deal with this as a community, because that’s the whole point, right? Community.”
John snapped to attention, blinking up at Sherlock and wiping his running nose with a crumpled tissue. “Are you up for that?”
Kevin was in a corner of the living room, surrounded by friends who were murmuring words of support and admonishments to
Pobeda floats in the distance. Everything precious to Sherlock waits for him on the expanse of her shiny surface. Anticipation, held at bay for so long, overwhelms him. He remembers once telling his Johnling that penguins could fly, and he proves it now, racing through this underwater world as fast as he can. Skybirds spend their lives looking down, Sherlock thinks as he looks up, scanning the surface for the last possible clearing before the ice locks him out. Sherlock flies up.
The second tag is engraved with an illustration of an anatomically correct heart.
Sherlock blinks, closes his bill, and resettles his feathers. He pulls himself up to his full height, straightens his wings, makes sure they’re pointing toward the ice, and waits.
“Am I?”
They sank.
“Yes, John. I understand.”
Sherlock’s head jostled against John's shoulder as he laughed, and then Sherlock started laughing, too, the two of them grasping at each other and sliding down the pillows.
The feathers along Sherlock’s neck give an involuntary bristle.
The first shot caught Tiny Bat John square under the chin, but he recovered beautifully, angling his head so that the second shot hit the roof of his mouth, filling it before spilling out and down the sides of Sherlock’s pulsing penis. He buried his face in the third shot, rutted faster, faster yet again, his litany of pornographic declarations trailing off into a string of, "Oh fuck, oh fuck, ohhh fuck, ohhhh fuh, ohhhhh..."
“This is useless,” Mycroft says, which certainly does not fit with Sherlock’s interpretation of his brother’s expression. “The entire ocean may be seeking the tooth. It doesn’t matter. We need to focus on one penguin, and one iceberg.”
“Yes. I will. I play the violin when I'm thinking. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential husbands should know the worst about each other.” Sherlock could barely see, his eyes were so scrunched up from smiling. He moved closer to John then, slipping right off the edge of his chair cushion, and landed on his knees facing John.
Sherlock slapped around on the nightstand for his phone, found it, and fell back on the pillows.
“Happy birthday. Again.”
“Hello.”
“Yeah yeah, I'll be right there.”
He slows, thinking about how happy the others will be when he loses the game, and then, out of the corner of his eye, he sees it. Two, maybe two and a half orca lengths below the surface, a discolouration mars the opaque white on white. The spot looks about the size of a Dragonfish, not quite as long as his wing. He swims closer.
Erebus’ answer makes so much sense, Sherlock is embarrassed not to have thought of it himself. Of course it would be particular to each peng, and each couple. He still does not know, however, why bonding with John has added some new element to
“What are you looking for?”

“Shush, you.” Annette laughed.
John burst out laughing, then shook his head and said, “I love how you are so passionate about the most inane things, Sherlock Holmes Watson,” which made Sherlock love John even that much more.
, Mycroft, only seven.”
John took off their shirts. That first touch of John's bare chest to Sherlock's back was heaven, all warm skin, and firm muscle, and the tickle of hair. John's biceps flexed against Sherlock's ribs as he reached down to undo Sherlock's button-fly. Sherlock was all wrapped up in John, and everything John touched was growing hot and needy.
“Oh, Sherlock. I wanted you, too, you git. Don't apologize. Don't apologize for not doing something that nobody wanted done. Don't. I could have asked you to intercede, couldn't I have? I could have gone after her myself. How was any of that your responsibility? I was selfish, too. And I was even more selfish, because I made that decision for Hannah, as well, to not go looking for her mother. I wanted you. I stayed.”
Sherlock swiveled away from John and held his coffee at arm’s length, and the person behind them laughed again.
“You’ll never be able to hear him if you call now, it’s too loud. Send him a text.”
“Yes, John. Tui, we will find her, and bring her back to discuss matters. Time is of the essence. Thank you. Thank you so much, for everything.”
“Of course, if you don’t think he’d be offended.”

“Are you going to tell me where we’re going?”
“Ha, ha. Do you really not know any of this bible stuff?” John stopped at the flashing red light at Main and 1st, then turned left and headed out of town, toward the freeway.
John barked out a laugh and spun them around. “Fine, why don’t you be Ginger, and I’ll lead.”
"Are you ... are you
John looks at Sherlock for a long moment, then gently bumps the top of his head against Sherlock’s sleek neck. “You did impress me. You very much impressed me with your talk about physics, and all the things you could deduce about other pengs, and your thoughts about the legends.”
“The thoughts just sort of came … and then I did, too.” He chuckled at his own joke and John smiled at him and leaned in for a quick kiss.
“Furthermore,” Sherlock continues, “it was only because of Mycroft’s confidence in me that I was able to continue my journey –”
Where is he going with that tongue of his I have discovered I quite like it in my mouth
Sherlock listened to those with half his attention, choosing instead to focus on the warmth radiating off of the man next to him. He was so small to be such a furnace, wasn’t he? But sitting this close, thigh to thigh, Sherlock could feel the heat of him through his trousers. That caused him to shiver, and wasn’t that ironic? Sherlock pressed his leg a little harder against John’s and John glanced at him and smiled, then patted his knee.
“Your – ass – oh fuck – yes –”
“You want to sleep in Pāpā Erebus’ pouch?”
Sherlock watched John lead a befuddled Greg into the kitchen. As they went he heard John say, “Probably don’t drink anything you need a bottle opener for.”
John shook his head and squeezed Sherlock's shoulders. “No. This only works if you're at a place that will benefit that magnificent brain of yours.”
He was just about to push his door open and step out into the crisp, fall air, when she grabbed him by the wrist and said, “I'm sure you don't have a thing to worry about, sweetheart.”
Sherlock wraps his arm around John tight tight tight.
Sherlock rattled around a bit, peeking into cupboards, drawers, and the pantry. “Mrs. Hudson, can we help you with anything?”
“Erebus, sound the call at sunset. We will start then.”

John was fast, determined; he wasted no time going for what they both wanted. His tongue was warm and slick, pointed and precise. He had his whole face pressed between Sherlock’s legs and was humming pornographic sounds of pleasure as he went about rimming Sherlock within an inch of his life.
“I love your hair,” John said. “I love the color and the curls and how shiny it is. I love how it frames your gorgeous face, how it sticks out even after you comb it. I love your hair because it reminds me of you, just slightly unruly, but brilliant. Rinse.”
John took a quick, hard breath in, and placed his hands on the back of his head. Sherlock nosed his way down John’s spine, tasting with the tip of his tongue as he went, then sucked a kiss to the base of John’s spine.
“Not really. Your dad is paying for it. And he’s getting acres.”
“Letting me do what I want.” John licked up Sherlock’s cleft. “Not rushing me.” He spread Sherlock apart and blew warm breath down low. “Staying still.”

Two hours later all hell was breaking out in Francis Ford Coppola’s cinematic masterpiece, and John and Sherlock’s hotel room was filled with the discordant sounds of Vietnamese Mnong Gar music, one of Colonel Kurtz’ delusional monologues, and John Watson’s soft moaning.
They walked toward the Brown Line El station in silence for a few minutes, but before they reached the station, Sherlock asked John if he thought he was ready to end their time in Chicago.

His finger jerked and curled inside Sherlock, and his tongue jabbed and slathered everything from Sherlock's balls to his perineum to his stretched, pinkening hole.
“I understand. If I am half as brave and good as you, John, I’ll be okay.”
“Five more days.”
He leaned against the counter, reached for John's tea, and gulped it. Maybe it would wash away the bitter taste of his disappointment.
“What do they imply?”
“The fountain pen shoots poison darts.”

I don't have photos of Sherlock and Lestrade sitting in Lestrade's office, or John and Laffitte playing cat and mouse, and you've already seen photos of Sidetrack ... so here are some links to johnlock fanart that I think fit this fic perfectly. I'm going to link instead of post, because I haven't asked for permission from the authors to post their art here.
The bathroom is really too small for the both of them, with only one sink and an old claw foot tub that takes up a ridiculous amount of room, but Sherlock crowds in behind John and wraps his arms around him as he tries to brush his teeth.
“So, who’s this, then?” he asked Sherlock while gesturing toward John.
“I hope you don’t mind, but I texted Kevin and asked him to delay his and Greg’s arrival until 7:30. I thought we might take a few minutes to discuss some matters of a personal nature.”
“I’m amenable to that plan.”
Sherlock came up on his elbows and spread his legs wider. John going down on him was undeniably one of his favorite ways to get off, and it would be even if he were blindfolded. But John doing this to him when Sherlock could see every single detail, when he could see the stretch of John’s lips, and the way his mouth met his fist as he ducked down, and the little bit of wet slipping down his chin, was magic. He could see John’s eyelashes, and the shadows they made on his pink cheeks, and he could see the individual strands of John’s gold blond hair as they bounced across his forehead with the force of each bob, and the slick on his cock as John coated it with his saliva. John Watson, his best friend, sucking his cock. Oh God, he was going to come.
“No, I am not okay, because you just stopped, and I need you to get the rest of your prick in me right now and make me come.”
“Home?” John has Sherlock’s full attention now.
Sherlock nodded.
"Lava oars seem highly improbable to me. But, we do die, don't we? And if we haven't passed on our knowledge, it dies with us. So, I talk to the elders."
“Oh my God, I’m so hard. I shouldn’t have worn these, I should’ve come to bed naked. I wasn’t sure if I was ready, but I can’t wait anymore, John.”
,” he continues, “I can’t imagine you are suggesting that certain pengs be forced to reproduce, whether they want to or not. I’m quite sure John has never had a conversation with you about whether or not he wants to have chicks, and just as sure he never will. So, that’s two.
John’s touch was light, just the backs of his fingers, his knuckles, slipping up and down the silk over Sherlock’s chest and arms and waist. He kept his mouth against Sherlock’s neck, and breathed. His exploration was slow and steady, and Sherlock put his hands on John’s waist, and let him do what he’d thought of doing two years ago, before they were this.
Greg and Kevin wished Sherlock a happy birthday and studied the drinks menu for a few minutes, and by the time both John and their server reappeared, everyone was ready to order. Mycroft kicked Sherlock under the table, a signal that Sherlock should keep his mouth shut, and ordered a bottle of 2013 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon.
“Your face. The patterns of flush over your skin, the complete lack of tension around your eyes, the relaxed shape of your mouth.”

“Surprise me. What do you want?”
“Sherlock.” A soft stroke to the inside of his knee to get him back on track.
Sherlock nibbled on his breakfast and scanned the headlines of the front page. There wasn’t much there to hold his interest, so he turned his attention back to Annette.
John jerked his chin forward and sucked two of Sherlock's fingers into his mouth, and Sherlock laid his forehead on John’s shoulder and swallowed down a moan.
What truly perplexed John, however, and it’s true that John spent a lot of time being perplexed, was why people seemed so interested in him and Sherlock
“We ordered a dozen different plates. We have three to go. Oh, and paella. We ordered paella. That’ll probably be last; it takes the longest to cook.”
“I have no doubt, Sherlock, neither in my mind, nor my heart. The moment I met Selvic, I knew it was forever. I just knew. But I can’t put myself in other pengs’ heads, and know what it feels like for them, or why you feel differently now that you’re bonded with John.”
He was a good man, John was.
“A picture of us, so she knows that we're her friends, too.”
John lifted his hips and reached between them, and at the same moment he took Sherlock’s mouth in another kiss and took his cock in his hand and stroked it from root to tip. Sherlock couldn’t help but thrust, couldn’t help but moan as he broke the kiss, panting and smearing wet lips against John’s jaw.

William Sherlock Scott Holmes
Instead, Sherlock rolled it between his thumb and index finger, pulling and squeezing, and moved to tongue at the other one. John arched up into Sherlock’s mouth from below, and pressed Sherlock’s head down with his hands, from above.
What Sherlock knew was that ignoring her wouldn’t make her stop. He’d learned that a long time ago. He sighed, picked up another russet from the pile, and waited for whatever was going to come next.
“It was not inspiration, Sherlpeng. I was simply doing what was right. The Shelf is very big, much larger than your island. You would not have survived one night without shelter, or the warmth of another peng.
“John, I’m … I’m having the same … I think I need to …”
Sherlock swallowed. “We'd have to live together to have that, John.”
Rimming.
Sherlock smiles. Johnling is nothing if not loyal. He has found the truth as he chooses to believe it, and will not be swayed. Sherlock will not try; Sherlock wouldn’t know in which direction to lean, anyway.
“Tell me how.”
John flipped through his notes and turned the pages back when he found what he was looking for. “I did. These places sounded good to me. Ready?”

Sherlock spread his legs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He would have told the truth of his nature to the High Council, not knowing how he'd have been received?”
“Really? What’s your first priority?”
“Tell me what you just figured out,” John said against his lips. He ran a hand up Sherlock’s arm and to the back of his neck, holding him there, kissing him through and over his words. “I want to know what’s going on.”
Sherlock hovers above them. He tries to break through the dense haze covering Pobeda, but the wind keeps pushing him back. Snippets of John and Maryle’s conversation reach his ears, and fuel his determination. He must reach John. He presses down again, trying to break through, wanting to make his presence known. He calls to John, he calls and calls, until his throat hurts and tears are falling from his eyes, mixing together with the sleet.
“Yeah, me, too.” John pulled Sherlock closer, whispered softer. “I don’t want it to go too fast, though. Our first New Year’s Eve, and all.” There was a beat of silence, John’s lips grazing the soft underside of Sherlock’s earlobe.
John shrugged. “My mom, Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft.”
“Hey, babe. Having fun?”
“I’m not sure I do, love.”
John shook his floor plan open and studied it. “This stuff, here,” he said, jabbing with his finger.
Who can say? He certainly can’t predict anything about that crazy bird, except the obvious: her craziness makes her unpredictable.
Sherlock slips away from John’s sleeping form and turns to regard the approaching figure. He kicks off, brushes the ice with his wings, hurrying to meet his brother, to welcome him home.
Soft wings are running down the length of his, again and again. Something touches and clacks under his bill, and prods his head up. His heart makes so much noise. Maybe that’s the problem. Maybe he needs to turn off that noise, so that he can focus on opening his eyes, instead. He’ll just turn it off. He’s not sure how, but surely that’s the answer.
John set his hands on Sherlock’s waist and nodded. “Yeah, sure, but those were reactive things, you know, to fix bad situations? I want to do things for no reason at all. I want you to feel special, because you are.”
They filled Mrs. Watson in on the details of their semester; teachers and dorm rooms, papers and exams, censoring out the more lurid details about parties and booze and missed classes. Well, John did. Sherlock didn’t have much to censor out, uninterested as he was in the more social aspects of university life.
“How many houses have you made her show you?” Sherlock asked, hands clasped behind his back, taking in the overrun garden and crumbling cottage in front of them.
With almost seventy beers on tap, a majority of them Belgian, Sherlock knew the odds were good that John wouldn’t be able to choose. Sure enough, twenty seconds into the bet, John started muttering under his breath. “Dogfish … Bosteels … St. Bernardus … Almanac Farmer’s Valencia Gold … shit shit shit … Perennial Hopfentea … Chimay Cinq Cent … crap fuck shit … Pollyanna Nose Over Tail … oh man.”
“Wouldn't dare.”
“You park the car under the cottonwood and we get out, and you strip down right there, next to the tree. You're slick with sweat, moving slow. I can't help but check you out, and I catch you looking at me when I take off my clothes, too.”
Sherlock closed his eyes. This was safer, here in the dark. Across from him, someone moved, then he felt that someone sit in the chair next to him and put their arm around his shoulder. John. Sherlock opened his eyes.
“The crust.”
“Of course you do.”
“Not only did they reclaim the stolen artefact, but when tasked with the responsibility of delivering the tooth to the High Council, Sherlock was able to interpret the star-shaped marking on its underside. For the first time in known pengstory, an emperor held that tooth and understood what the shape meant. The marking represented an exceptional star – Kororā and Ika’s father, Atutahi. Sherlock followed it, and then, with assistance from his Rūnangan escorts, Anahera and Tui, he found something extraordinary.
And that does it. That takes Sherlock down to his knees, where John can easily push him onto his back and straddle him. “This what you want, Sherlock? Is this what you meant when you said you wanted me to humanize you? Because I will, Sherlock. I’ll strip you down to your bones and put you back together again, but you’re going to have to tell me right now, Sherlock, how much you’re going to give back, yeah? Because I said romantic entanglement, and that’s what I meant. I didn’t say quick shag, and I didn’t say fuck buddy, and I didn’t say let’s-get-off-but-no-homo, yeah?”
“I am. I like this kind of stuff.”
“Just to be clear: you mated with a male peng from Pobeda to make our egg?”
The colony falls into a hush.
I know I keep saying this, but we're getting close to the end.
Sherlock let this new information settle. A small bird took refuge from the storm in the rafters above them and shook out its feathers, then began to groom itself with its blunt, yellow beak.
“Yeah.”
“I really do.”
Sherlock puts the last of the forks in the dish drainer and dries his hands on his apron, then turns to lean against the counter next to John.
“You okay, babe?” John’s voice was all innocence and placid concern. He pressed his palm to Sherlock’s forehead. “Actually, he feels a bit warm. Sherlock, have a sip of water for me.”
“It's been so long, I don't really remember much more than dark hair, and that he’s tall. Let’s wander around. I’ll probably know him when I see him.”
“Of course! It would be my pleasure. And the exercise would do my hip some good, too. I haven’t hiked up there in more winters than I can count.”
Can Sherlock kiss Johnling right here, right now, in front of the colony? Would that be a bit not good?
John ran his hand up and down the sleeve of Sherlock’s coat and pulled him back to the ticket machine. “Our stop is Western, right?”
“Well, I couldn't either when I was your age, and neither could your mother. But what if we had ice cream
“My birthday.” Sherlock ran the instep of his foot up the side of John’s calf, and thumbed a nipple.
. We remind you that this course material has been researched and designed specifically with you in mind, and is not available to other students.
“So what now?” John asked.
The trek up the iceberg takes a little longer than usual with Hudi in tow, but John and Sherlock are happy to slow down their pace in order to accommodate her. Along the way they chat about the upcoming migration home, and what they’re most looking forward to.
“There's no rush, okay? There's lots for us to do.”
“Sorry.”
“Not really. But it’ll work out. I’m sure of it.”
“All you know is your colony. You do everything with them. You huddle with them, swim with them, eat with them, migrate with them, and now you face the long, dark winter with them.
“The most unapologetic of the Apologists were given a timeframe within which they had to leave; it was up to them and their families to decide if others would voluntarily go with them. In the end, five families left, a total of twenty-three pengs.
Sherlock knows Erebus refers to her lack of colour, and perhaps the mysticism associated with this anomaly, but all he can think to say is, “Yes. She’s extraordinary, and very brave, and very kind. She is my friend.”
“You were standing up on your toes, John, glaring icicles at all the chicks around you who weren’t paying sufficient attention. You were so focussed on the legend. Your bill was open a little bit, that’s how hard you were listening.”
The last word snaps Sherlock back to himself;
“I do. Very much. Thank you, again.”
Almost done, he thinks, tapping his lower lip. Ah yes, mouth. He rummages through a bright green shopping bag until he finds what he's looking for, a small glass vial of thick gloss with a tart cherry flavour. He rolls the applier carefully over his full lower lip, then presses it to the upper, blotting and covering at the same time. He sucks the corner of an exaggerated pout into his mouth, tasting the sharp sweetness, then pats on just a touch more right in the middle of his lower lip.
“Well, yes.”
Erebus gives Sherlock a solemn nod. "You are both correct. Now, let me ask you this: What would that group of pengs stand to gain by disallowing same-peng pairings?"
This time, instead of ordering a small drink that they’d each want two more of, John ignored the chalkboard menu behind the counter and told the barista, “Give us two of the biggest, frothiest, dark roast coffee drinks you’ve got.”
“Go back to sleep. Sorry I woke you.”
“I've loved you my whole life.” John's smile was a tender confession now, lopsided and vulnerable.
They saw the smoke from the Watson’s chimney before they could see the house, and Sherlock made a mental note to make sure there was enough firewood stacked by his own fireplace. Maybe they could watch a movie later, with the fire roaring, and a shared bowl of popcorn and a blanket on the couch.
“John, we'll claim grandparent prerogative and privilege, clause six, article two, if she says anything.”
“Sherlock,” John groaned, “I’m gonna go off like a bottle rocket in about two seconds.”
John put his lips to his ear and whispered. “Your cock, Sherlock, is fucking gorgeous. So hard, so thick. Red now, flushed, so hot. I think you’re gonna come, just from this. Can you come, Sherlock, just from this? Can you imagine, if this is so good, what it’s gonna feel like when I’ve got my dick in you? Can you? When I slide in and hit this spot with my fat dick, what it’s gonna feel like?”
“She thought I’d given you the medicine earlier and said it was too soon to give you more. I admitted that I hadn’t given it to you. She tried to give it to you then, but you still wouldn’t take it. You said it was for Redbeard, that we needed to give it to him because he was sick. You didn’t remember that he had died that past summer. No matter what we said you wouldn’t take the medicine.
“– you complete
in your sleep. I think you got up to 'scenario seventy-six,’ before your brain finally had enough, and shut down."
No, not I. Let me pass with the knowledge that I reached my end while endeavoring to give pleasure. Let me find eternal slumber only after having performed such mind-bending, soul-sucking fellatio upon John, that he squeezes the last breath from my gasping lungs by clenching his powerful, almighty, glorious thighs around my trembling flower petal neck in the throes of an orgasm so profound that he also succumbs, and joins me in everlasting Elysium.
“She? She, who?”
He also wondered, though, if it was John’s ‘feverish distance’ that helped lower the tension a little bit. It’s hard to have an argument with someone who doesn’t seem to be aware of anything going on around him.
Once again, behind the closed door, Sherlock undressed. He hung the robe back on its hook and slipped out of his pants. He tucked those into the pocket of the bathrobe, then sat on a small chair tucked into the corner of the room and pulled the wedding garments out, one by one. There was the sleeveless vest, and then a blousy, long-sleeved shirt with a high boat neck. There was a long pair of pyjama bottoms with a drawstring waist and pockets, and pair of short pants, and two pairs of underwear. The first was boxer briefs, ordinary in every way. The second, though, was barely more than a scrap of fabric, just a small pouch with a g-string. Underneath it all was a long robe, not unlike the terry cloth one he’d just taken off, but this one was in the same smooth, white silk as all the other garments.
"You okay?" he'd called out as Sherlock readied himself to jump off again, toes curling over the edge, drops of water evaporating almost as soon as they landed on the hot rock on either side of him.
“– keep you safe – facilitate in any way – not let you suffer – carry the burden – you will go home – journey ends here – saw it in my shell – trust what she said –”
“Good. And the rest of the world can just mind their own damn business as far as I'm concerned. Be careful, though. We don’t exactly live in a hot seat of liberalism and open-mindedness.
“My Lord, is that really the time?” Sarah said. “I’ve got a date in Dodgeville tonight, so I’d best be going so that I have enough time to get ready.” She stood up and brushed down the nonexistent crumbs on her skirt. “I’m sorry to eat, ask, and run, but I do need to go. John, Sherlock, will you walk me out? Mrs. Watson, thank you again, so much.” She leaned forward, wrapped Mrs. Watson in her arms, and patted her on the back. She was halfway to the front door before John’s mom came back to her senses.
Sherlock will never be able to explain why he does what he does next. It happens without thought or intention. He lifts both wings, and holds them out to Mycroft. Mycroft appears startled, but then he reaches out, too, and lays his wings under Sherlock’s, supporting them.
“Sounds pretty arranged to me.”
John rubbed their noses together and kissed Sherlock’s forehead, the curls at his temples. “I love you, Sherlock. I always have.”
Most of Sherlock's clients would thank him, gather their coats, packages, and umbrellas, tell him to have a good week, and leave without looking back.
Greg knew it, too. “My God. Look at him. He’s practically foaming at the mouth.”
“You, my pengheart, only you. You are my greatest weakness. I lose all sense when it comes to what I would do for you.” John slides his wings up and down Sherlock’s, and turns his head so they are cheek to cheek.
Sherlock was pretty sure that John’s body was perfect, and would be no matter how his inches lined up. Sixty-six inches tall, fifteen around the neck, thirty around the waist, thirty down the leg, and there, just there, four-and-a-half beautiful, flaccid inches, almost seven when erect, and hello, four-and-a-half marvelous inches thick.
“Indeed. Plus, we all started out the same way, hatching from a simple egg. So, not very different after all.”
“Sherlock, you’re a fine young man, and you've always been a good friend to John. Whatever your future holds, you’ll have a place at my table.”
“No, sir.”
“Yes. It’s a condition in which our bodies are mostly inactive, the eyes stay closed, and consciousness is almost entirely suspended.”
John giggles and nods. “I do! And you said I was ridiculous, and you said it like being ridiculous was the very best thing in the world. And I thought, I will be all kinds of ridiculous for this peng, for as long as he’ll let me.”
The car was warm under Sherlock, a welcome comfort given the slight chill in the air. He managed to wriggle a bit closer to John as he stretched out his long legs and relaxed against the glass. Pine trees framed his view of the town below, and a soft breeze rustled branches and raised goosebumps on his arms.
John leaned over and kissed him, and Sherlock stayed there, in that moment, only somewhat aware of what John’s hands were doing with the slick until he felt John take him in one hand, guide him up and back, and press him exactly where he wanted him.
Sarah didn’t miss a beat. “That’s so sweet. How long have you guys been together?”
John took a quick shower, all business, and left it running for Sherlock. The hot water chased the cold out of the tips of his fingers and toes, the back of his neck and the tops of his ears. Thinking forward to sharing a birthday dinner with people he cared for, he turned off the water, stepped out, and rubbed himself dry. Hair, arms, chest, legs, feet. He stood up and pressed the towel between his legs, lifting and patting, then reached behind himself and swiped at his ass and down in between.
“I dated her. She was blonde then,” he said distractedly.
“And he didn’t like you asserting your independence?”
“Go, babe. It’s okay.”
John swiped his thumb through the slick beading out of Sherlock’s slit, then pushed the pad of his thumb over the smooth slope of the head.
John ran his hands up and down Sherlock’s back and huffed warm breath against his neck. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Of course. My life is far more interesting with you in it.”
“For spending the next hour, at least, in your bedroom.” John yanked his hat off and ran his fingers through his hair. “Okay. I’ve got it. Laundry.”
Sherlock rubbed the heel of his hand over his forehead and grimaced. “Dash?”
“Of course there is.”
Sherlock pushed his plate toward John. “Finish it.”
, isn’t she?”
“It’s definitely an emperor egg?” John asks, running the side of his bill over the creamy white surface.
Sherlock reached down with one hand and pulled his cock out of his underwear. He gave the length of it three long pulls and spread the slick over his crown, then pushed his underwear down to his knees. He pressed his face into John's ass and French kissed John's hole. It was sloppy and loud. Obscene. Perfect.
Sherlock chopped and grated, standing close to John, jostling his elbow and looking up to smile at him every now and then. When they were both done, John picked up the glasses of wine and held one out to Sherlock.
I know it's been a bit of a wait since the last chapter, and I do apologize.
“We talked about why he was here. He wanted to leave. Sherlock, I swear to God I almost let him, but I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if he left here and was killed because of it, no matter how small the risk.”
John had other plans. He waited until Sherlock had removed the ivory gloves and baby blue sweaters, then he spun him around, bent him over the vanity, and flipped the skirt up and over his head. Blinded by netting, Sherlock's other senses went on high alert. There was the taste of talcum powder and hairspray in his mouth, and the smell of Pond's cold cream and Chanel Coco at the tip of his nose. He waited for more, spread legs trembling, and then he felt John's hands pull him apart, and heard him moan, and then experienced the previously unknown miracle of John's tongue lapping at him in a most unladylike manner.
“Great. I have an idea, actually.”
“Don't be silly, Granddad. I don't have any faerie dust. Only the faeries have faerie dust. Although I should very much like to have some, if I could."
“Hey, we’ve been over all of that. Like you said, what you and I had wasn’t meant to carry over into this world. You were right. It was a time and a place thing. No regrets.”
“No,” Sherlock laughed over the phone, imagining John bouncing up on his toes and licking his lips. “Sorry to disappoint you. I know a detective inspector who lets me help out with cases when he’s out of his depth.”
John ran his hand down Sherlock's neck and shoulder and laid it over his heart. “Your heart is racing.”
“Yeah.” John just stared, watching his fingers disappear between Sherlock’s lips.
John shifted again, raising himself up a bit, and then Sherlock felt John’s hands spreading him wide. He curved his lower back and tilted his hips up, desperate for it, embarrassed, but wanting it just the same. John made an appreciative humming sound behind him, then came in closer, pulled him apart even more, and circled his tongue around the very center of him. Between his legs, his balls drew up, and his cock swelled. He dripped steadily onto the bed beneath him.
“Apo’s followers, the apologists, believe Kororā was punished for choosing a female mate, and have worked tirelessly, hidden amongst us, to eradicate the possibility of same-peng couples. Over time, the apologist movement has grown. This summer, one of their own infiltrated Pobeda’s Council.
“We were a lot distracted. What was it?”
“I realised, just now, well maybe I’ve been realising for some time, I’m not completely sure about the timing, but it’s probably not important, that is, I have come to the conclusion…” and here Sherlock had to stop, because John was holding his hand and beaming up at him as if Sherlock had just discovered alchemy, and truly, he had no idea how to say the words he wanted to say, no idea how to unstick them from the lining of his heart, from the back of his throat, from the tip of his tongue, so he licked his lips and swallowed and said, “... the conclusion, that I really do want to see that tennis court you were talking about.”
And John knows, too. John knows what he is to Sherlock.
Sherlock did the math in his head. Sixteen days until John went back to school. Sixteen tiny little stupid days. Under other circumstances, sixteen days would be enough to do just about anything. Some idiot had circumnavigated the globe in a hot air balloon in thirteen days; people had written novels and scaled mountains and saved lives and built schools for orphans in less time. But for him and John? It was a dearth.
They browsed through the stacks at Unabridged Books, flipping through bestsellers, and reading dogeared copies of
“Poor baby. Go get in the shower and you’ll warm up. I’ll take care of your balls later.”
"We were talking about the legend. What was it like, Dā, when you realized the tooth you had found was so special?"
“I’m the luckiest man in the world, and after dinner, later tonight, when we get back in this bed, I’m going to make you very, very happy.”
“Our expedition was quite exhilarating! We discovered all sorts of interesting new things!”
“And do you realize why I didn’t move?”
“What are you doing? I’m telling you about my dreams.”
Sherlock looks over his shoulder to make sure no one else has wandered within earshot. Taking his cue, Cetus steps further down the shore, putting more distance between them and the rest of the Senior Council.
“Nope.”
Sherlock allowed one small smile, then half a chuckle. “It really is amazing. And that sort of reminds me of something.”
“Please tell me you’re not talking about keratinocyte proliferation.”
“The matter of Mycroft’s prophecy is a complicated one,” she says. “We cannot divine that Sherlock has completed the entirety of his fate; therefore, we cannot know that Mycroft is finished following his.
“Hey, there you are,” John said, coming over for a kiss. “Annette made Cullen skink and I’m heating up some bread. Want to open a bottle of wine?”
“We need to find Anahera, John. She’s done something, this is about her, I can tell. I had dreams, I dreamt that she came back, although somehow she had never left, and she said that she had thought of us while she’d been away, that she’d brought us something, that we were safe now.”
, he thought. “Once I look at the data on the memory stick and figure out what Bea is hiding, it’ll be a win-win for all of us.”
Sherlock switches on the kettle and fusses over finding cups and saucers, a half-full packet of biscuits, the least damaged teaspoon. He balances everything in his hands, between his fingers, and carries it into the small sunroom off the kitchen, facing the back garden.
Mrs. Hudson.
Aumārire inspired courage, bravery, and determination. It overcame jealousy, spite, and insecurity. Aumārire was accessible and commonplace, easy to touch and see and hold. It was an integral part of their lives.
“I do. But I don’t like it so much when I stink, or when I’m sticky, or when I haven’t brushed my teeth in a while.”
“He’s going to follow Annette home when she’s done for the day,” John added.
“Rude, standing James up like that,” John said.
“Not bad. Come see.”
Sherlock turned his head to the right and squinted. It was the doctor. The Laffitte guy with the cerulean turtleneck. He wasn’t as old as Sherlock had thought, now that he could see him up close. Prematurely grey. Fit. Short. Napoleon complex. Probably had a teeny dick.
Sherlock peeled away from John and made a great show of picking up all the discarded bags, wrappers, and empty ornament containers scattered around the living room. John’s requests that he do more to clean up around the flat had become less suggestive and more demanding in the last few months, and Sherlock was trying, he really was. He was better about hanging up his towel after showers now, about keeping his stack of books and notes in one pile instead of scattered all over John’s things, as well. He made the bed if he was the last one out of it, and took out the recycling on Tuesday mornings because he left for classes earlier on Tuesdays than John.
“Very sure.”
“There, that’s it, John, right there.”
“I’ve been dreading this moment since we woke up this morning.”
“You go first,” he said, handing over his present for John. He’d purchased it in early December, in Boston, and had loved it almost as much as he thought John would. He was looking forward to seeing it again, and looking forward to John unwrapping it.
“You’ve spent the better part of the last few years convincing me that all things must end, that people move on, that they transfer attention from one interest to the next. You’ve quite effectively painted a scenario in which I have rather favourably imagined myself. The country, the sea, bees. You. What changed your mind? And why wait until now, like this, to tell me?”
John was silent for a moment and shifted slightly so that he could look down and meet Sherlock’s eye. “You’ve never said anything inappropriate when we’ve been together. Are you afraid you might?”
conference, meeting
“Did you know about this?” John whispers. He need only look at Sherlock’s gobsmacked face to know the answer.
The following information is from
“That tomorrow we’re going to check out the rooftops with a sightline to Caffe Scozia’s front windows.”
“Okay.” John says to the egg.
, because he'd thought so, too.
Sherlock did know, and it was a phenomenon he had only recently discovered. The sensation was different than being harped at by one’s family, or stared at by someone who thought you were a freak. It was an experience in which Sherlock felt pinned beneath a gaze, not inspected, but held close and appreciated, memorised, cherished. John made him feel special, so he said so. “Adored.”
“We really should. They’d love it here, especially now that it’s a reflection of both of us.”
“You are not helping, Sherlock.” John looks like he’s had more than enough. Sherlock is ready and willing to distract John from all of this.
If John is annoyed at him during the day, and Sherlock deduces that he is, he sheds that annoyance the moment they’re tucked up together, belly-to-belly, bill-to-bill, under the constellations. Then, with their wings wrapped around each other, with no need for respectable distances, they can murmur mythology, and whisper words of adoration, until John snuggles up under Sherlock’s wing, and falls asleep.
They stand as close as possible without touching, as any shifting of a single feather will cause the loss of precious body heat trapped beneath. They rest their heads on their own chests, underwing. Sherlock stops staying awake for the purpose of watching John sleep. Now he wakes himself for the purpose of seeing John, soon.
John did open his eyes then, and he laughed out loud. “Sex agrees with everyone, I think. And for the record, you look much the same. Completely blissed out, if not a bit contemplative.”
“I meant everything I said at the club, but I realize it didn’t come out in a coherent manner. I didn’t mean to startle you. I startled myself, to be honest. I was fine, and then all of a sudden I wasn’t.”
John studied the penguins. “That is impressive. I couldn’t hold anything on my feet for two minutes.”
The compliment is unexpected, but comforting. Sherlock ducks his head in acknowledgment, then changes the topic.
Sherlock fidgets, hoping John won't choose now to rehash the argument about the exorbitantly expensive microscope, but John is fixed on the photograph in his hand, a sentimental expression on his face.
“Not only that, but I’m pretty sure the New Testament is supposed to replace the Old Testament. Like, Jesus came back and said, ‘yeah, about that old stuff, just forget it. I’m here to set the record straight.’”
"That's a rather specific number for an approximation." Erebus has a fond look on his face. "What does the size tell you?"
Please see the notes at the bottom of this chapter for peng pics, Maori translations, and some explanations about artistic license.
Sherlock smiled. This nonstop adoration would be very easy to get used to. He reached out and gripped John’s knee. “If I look sexy to you it’s because of the way you make me feel.”
"It was you, John, you're the one who, you just, you changed, all of a sudden you were so, you have no idea, no idea at all. I wanted you so bad, all the time,
terribly. He tells them story after story about John, about how he loves to skip ice chips, and the secret language he’d suggested, and how protective John is, how easily he makes friends, and what a good healer he has already proven himself to be.
Sherlock found that the more Champagne he sipped, the more aware he became of John’s physicality. John’s eyes couldn’t possibly be becoming bluer, but they appeared that way to Sherlock. His lips were getting pinker, too, and his hair shinier. Sherlock stared at his flute glass with suspicion, then took another long sip. John had delicious squishy cheeks when he smiled, with deep indentations where he’d eventually have laugh lines. His eyes turned into half-moons of mischief and his forehead bunched up just a bit, too. He watched John laugh, then brush his fringe to one side and scratch at the side of his nose.
Sherlock grabs John around the waist and pulls him close enough that John has to put an arm around Sherlock's shoulder to stay afloat.
“It hasn’t been until this trip, and our experiences at Sidetrack and at Kevin’s party, that I’ve come to realize how little I know. This whole … scene … is unlike anything I would have imagined, mostly because it’s nothing I ever would have imagined for myself.
He shoved his clipboard, calculator, highlighter, and pocket ruler into his backpack, and zipped up his jacket.
“Babe, you look amazing. The shirt is perfect for you, and you are perfect in it.” He took a step closer. “And I am the luckiest man in the world to be seen anywhere near you.”
i. Look at John from under slightly lowered lashes
Sherlock woke first, to a dark house and the odd sensation that it could’ve been the middle of the night, or the next morning, and maybe he was late for the school bus, and where was everyone, anyway? John in his arms made everything clear again, and he smiled, and stretched, warm and relaxed under the blankets.
Did James know that John and Sherlock were here when he started his journey? Would he have come otherwise? What if he did know that John was here and what if he came because he was desperate to see him? What would drive one man to visit an ex who had just married someone else? Did James want John back? Surely, anyone in their right mind would realise that leaving John Watson was a resoundingly stupid mistake.
Sherlock’s balls drew up tight and a tremor ran up his inner thighs, ending with small contractions in his lower belly. He cupped John’s arse in one hand—he was learning that not touching John’s arse was going to be problematic for him—and brought their mouths together. He pulled away just once more to whisper in John’s ear. “I'm ready.”
That wasn't Mrs. Hudson.
"Mm. I suppose you’re right. Still, I should go over there, I should—"
Sherlock blinks and considers his options. He has none. “I was excited to come home to you, John.”
“My brain. It just … it was like it jumped tracks. The physical sensations of his hand on my neck, on my face, it was too much. His thumb brushed my cheek and he moved in to kiss me and I … I blurted out something horrible. I couldn’t help it, I don’t even know where it came from, from what random observations I’d been subconsciously collecting, but I said, ‘Your father is embezzling millions from his clients and having an affair with his secretary.’”
“I do. I definitely do have an extremely high opinion of you. I definitely do not think you'd have chosen to be with someone like that.”
“‘Dorothy liked the way I've rearranged the family room, and you were right, without some of those bigger pieces,’ blah blah blah, ‘lighter color really opens up the place,’ blah blah blah, um, she talks about donating some of the more outdated pieces to a women’s shelter in the city, um, wait, here’s something.
“Mm. Sight for sore eyes, you are. Except for the potato peel in your hair. Not sure that’s a good look for you.” John reached up and plucked the offending bit of potato out of Sherlock’s curls, and tossed it into the snow.
Sherlock felt something sour curdle in his belly. Jealousy and curiosity were nasty bedfellows, a bitter combination that pushed Sherlock forward despite his own common sense. He was tempted to ask James questions about his relationship with John under the pretence of investigating who was trying to murder him, but one glance at the look John was shooting his way took the words out of his mouth and put them to rest.
“I love you, Sherlock.”
He reached down, grasped John’s arse in both hands, and flexed upward. That movement may have been purposeful, but the next one, a full body shudder, was the result of Sherlock involuntarily responding to John’s obscene groan.
“I didn't know he loved me, too, Imi.”
“I had to jerk off before I got out of the water.” John slid the side of his hand down the cleft of Sherlock’s ass, and between his thighs.
“McDonald’s, Subway, or Cracker Barrel?”
Sherlock took a swallow of wine and passed the glass to John, who finished it off. It was absolutely, positively, 100 percent without a doubt, time to go. The only problem was that he was completely boxed in, and they hadn’t paid yet. “Shall we settle up, then?”
Sherlpeng. I’m just going to mess them all up again.”
“Good thing I’ve got about a million of them, then, isn't it?”
“And your coat, Sherlock, I’ve never seen such a rich black before. You look like midnight, like the space between the stars, made even richer for their brilliance.
“You don’t need to be.”
“Oh my gods,” John groans. “Are they out of their minds?”
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist and moved closer. His knees knocked into John’s. “Other oral things.”
“Queen Kate?”
“You? You aren't loud? Mr. OH MY GOD YES YES YES DON'T STOP YOUR COCK IS SO HUGE JOHN YES YES YES!”
The next morning they slept in, until the sounds of snowplows scraping metal against asphalt became impossible to ignore, and the heavy curtains could no longer block out the bright winter daylight.
Mycroft may want Sherlock to think he’s annoyed, but in truth, Mycroft is unsure, and if there is anything Mycroft cannot tolerate in himself, it is being unsure. He is particularly troubled because he has no real recommendation to make to their father. There is too little data, and too many variables. The look on his face now, Sherlock thinks, is a cross between addled, and afraid. And, as much as Sherlock would like to revel in Mycroft’s state of uncertainty, he finds he cannot do so. If Mycroft is
“The hair follicle experiment?”
When Sherlock was reclined, using his jacket as a pillow with his crossed arms under his head, John pulled his clarinet out of his rucksack, adjusted the reed in the leather ligature, and cleared his throat. He glanced down to make sure that Sherlock had his eyes closed, lifted the clarinet to his mouth, and for the next ten seconds made the most god awful sound to ever grace the Thames and its many estuaries.
“She’s injured, or maybe, um, more than injured.”
“Don’t ask me that, Sherlock. I’d never stop,” he said between kisses, “not until I had you saying a hell of a lot more than ‘oh.’”
“Stop it.”
“Oh my God, you and my armpits, what is up with that?”
In this fic, I describe swimming distances in "whale lengths." When Sherlock dives "twenty blue whales," he's diving 20 times 25 meters, or 500 m (1,640 ft.). Here's the key I've been using (these are averages; another source I saw said that Blues are 30m):
“Great. I’m going to do the bedroom across the hall. Meet me in the kitchen when you’re done and we’ll take a break.”
(noun) faeces, excrement, poo, dung, droppings, stools
John pours more tea, sensing that they might be here for a while.
“More than five?”
“The ketchup likes the bedroom.”
“Uh-huh.”
“Easy there, yeah? Just take a small sip.”
It is so much. It is the moment before diving into the sea, the instant before a sneeze, the tiny space before a yawn. Something has to give. Every part of him clamps down, squeezing hard on the throbbing at the centre him. Something, he does not know what, has to give.
“Interesting. Now, what if you had no ketchup?”
The next morning they woke earlier than they had in days. They showered, dressed, and threw their Chicago guidebooks into a shared backpack. In the lobby, Jessica waved them over with one hand, a stack of cookies in the other.
a long journey
“God, Sherlock, look at you. Fuck. Look at your cock.”
Sherlock dressed while John showered, then slipped downstairs to see what awaited him. He crept into the kitchen, not wanting to give James a heads up that he was coming, but what greeted him was more a scene of quiet domesticity than creeping ex’s and assassin’s death threats. James was seated at the kitchen table, a cup and empty plate to his left, his phone in his right hand. Annette was standing across from him, scrubbing a stack of copper pans that she’d taken down from the overhead rack.
“Noon? Or is that going to be too early?”
Sherlock watched John, who was watching Sherlock, and Sarah wiped her mouth on her napkin and looked back and forth between them.
“Apparently you do not.”
Then, in his third year, Victor happened, much the way a tornado might. They met in the evenings when the campus was quiet and their peers were winding down their days, when the sky was that soft violet colour before full dark, when the birds settled and the cicadas began to sing. Although used to studying at all hours of the day and night, Sherlock quickly cultivated new habits that allowed him to cram as much school work into the day as possible so that his nights were free for other endeavors.
“Daddy, come dance with us!”
“You okay?” John asked.
to KarlyAnne for her Beta
Some of the touches had been less innocent: the caress of the back of his neck, the grab of a butt cheek, and several forced kisses. Sherlock had warded them all off with his knowledge of Bartitsu and left them not wanting to come back for more. He knew that others found him attractive. What he didn’t know was why anyone thought they had the right to claim him as their own.
“Do you want to go back to the hotel?”
“It was obvious, really.”
“Fuck, yes, yes –”
“Mmhm?”
Sherlock took a deep breath and picked up the scone again. No need to get ahead of himself. He didn’t even know if a proposal would be forthcoming.
“On the path, sir, on the path that Sherlock and I take to the ice cave. It’s the longer one, the one that curves around the back and side of the peak, because when we first started going to the cave, my shoulder was still injured, and that path isn’t as steep as the regular path.”
John slumps down next to him and bumps his head against Sherlock’s. He mumbles something Sherlock cannot understand, and Sherlock wonders if the joys of mating have somehow interfered with his ability to comprehend language. It would be a small price to pay. He musters together some scrap of energy, and grunts a questioning noise in John’s direction.
“Nope. You got me into this, whatever this is, so you get the honour of telling me.” John pours cream into his coffee and stirs, waiting for the explanation.
“Ok. Um. Well, we should probably go in, yeah? Loitering on the street might look suspicious. Don’t want the neighbours calling the Met or anything. My Dad would kill me if I got an ASBO.” John huffed an awkward laugh and turned to the door, fumbling for the keys in his pocket. This bloke was throwing him off his game.
“Mine. I make all the stupid rules.”
Sherlock sneaks back to the crèche before the sun comes up. Before he can share his epiphany with John, however, he needs his very angry
“You let me know. I watch for you. And you,” she smirks, turning to wrap her other arm around Sherlock's waist, craning her neck to look up at him, “You be good to my Dottore Watson. Or no cannoli. Capito?”
Mycroft then revisits the only option with which they all concur. It is unlikely that she has it on, or in, her body. If she has hidden it on Cassiopeia, they must find it. The four of them have studied and memorized a map of the berg that Erebus had scraped into the ice. They each have one quarter of the iceberg to search, and have been doing so as frequently as time allows.
That night, Sherlock laid awake and tried to deduce where they might go for their honeymoon. He could rule Afghanistan right out, he was sure of that. John had expressed interest in Sherlock’s childhood summers in France, but John was too down-to-earth for the French culture’s flair for drama. No, John liked straightforwardness. That would also rule out Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece.
“Feels so good,” John murmured, and Sherlock closed his eyes and imagined John saying that in an entirely different context.
So, of course I ran off and watched it. It is, indeed, hilarious. I warn you, though, if you are easily offended by someone dissing Chicago's deep dish, you may want to skip it. ;)
“I don’t care. I was just wondering.”
“You like the jacket, huh? You like looking at it? Touching it?”
Sherlock put the pen down and looked up at her. “Am I really that transparent?”
“Go.”
“Fine. I’m fine. But if we go back to Kevin’s now, and stay through midnight, we’ll never get a cab back to the hotel. The roads will be crazy.”
Sherlock hesitated for just a moment, then gripped the edge of the sheet and looked up at John. John, eyes set on Sherlock, gave him the slightest of nods. Sherlock looked back down and slowly lowered the sheet to the top of John’s thighs. Whereas he’d previously been fascinated by the expressions unfolding on John’s face, he could not make himself look away from what lay before him.
They moved into the kitchen, a small room with mint green cabinets and black and white linoleum. Mrs. Watson had decorated it years ago, as a newlywed, with cherry-themed curtains, dishtowels, and Horticultural Society prints. It was like sitting in a time capsule dedicated to his and John’s childhood.
“Forty-two seconds.”
Sherlock left James to stare out at the rumbling grey sky and the sheets of rain. He went inside, walked past the kettle, past the bags of groceries waiting to be unpacked, and went straight up the stairs and into the bedroom he shared with his husband. John looked up in surprise from where he sat on the edge of the bed with a pair of socks in his hands, naked but for a pair of dry pants. A damp towel sat near his hip and his hair was sticking up from where he’d rubbed at it.
Erebus nods and bows to Molling and Lestra, who stare up at him in intimidated wonder, and gestures for Sherlock and John to follow him.
“OH, GOD!”
“Good morning, you,” his man muttered, face half buried in his pillow.
Sherlock put his phone down and let his head rest against the back of the armchair he was sitting in. What would it be like, he and John living together at Baker Street? Despite it being his family’s flat, he was really the only one who ever spent any time there. Over the years he had transferred everything Mummy didn’t want in Oxfordshire to 221b and the space had become more and more cramped with mismatched furniture, stacks of chemistry journals, cold case files, newspaper clippings, shelves upon shelves of books, odd specimens, laboratory equipment, and of course, the skull that she had absolutely refused to let him bring into the house. For the love of all that was sacred, he reflected, it wasn’t as if he’d tried to bring home a wild animal. It was a skull, its owner long-deceased.
“Not yet. Let them tend to her injuries. Soon.”
“Stop foostering!”
I am at least twelve-years-old
As soon as Erebus has left them in their huddle, Sherlock whispers to John that he will be right back, and he slips off. Twenty steps away he hears something behind him, and leaps into a spinning twist, ready to catch his attacker.
John winked at him. “I like your muffin, gorgeous.”
My queue is running and I’ll try to check @s and messages.”
“Can I ask you something?”
“What?” John asked, as the milk finished steaming.
John slips his mouth off Sherlock's cock and licks him, licks long, broad stripes up and down his erection, tasting and sucking up and down the slippery shaft. John is eating him up, using his lips and tongue to get at sweet gloss and flesh, all the while twisting and turning the round tip of the glass cylinder inside him.
“Now we have the chance to be a different symbol, one of progressive, proactive change. I want you to be at the very forefront of such a sea change, Erebus. You deserve it.”
The collection of box hives are a short walk from the back garden, in the fields that surround the cottage. The grass here is wild and uncut, woven with foxtail, heather, milkwort, and meadowsweet. Over the years Sherlock has worn a path from the gate to the hives, and recently has begun to line the edges of the trail with found sticks and rocks, an informal adornment to a place already staggeringly beautiful.
Sherlock hummed deep in his throat, rubbed, and licked, and John’s entire body spasmed, his torso curling forward, his legs coming up and off the mattress.
John does it again, and Sherlock’s legs wobble. When John moves behind him, murmurs in his ear, “Sherlock, let me …” and clamps down on the back of Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock’s body understands exactly what John wants, and he finds himself on his belly, facing away from John, with his tail high in the air.
“The faster you … with the right vector quantity, that is, the direction … ”
doing here?” Anderson’s sneer distorted his face.
“Do you want to?”
“Yeah.”
“The restaurant at the Knockendarroch hotel. James is meeting him there for drinks at seven, with dinner to follow.”
Sherlock has no idea what to say. Parts of it are awful, but it’s also a fascinating story, and an important one to penguins everywhere. John joins Sherlock at Erebel’s height and runs his wing over her back.
Sherlock turns from the sink, tea towel in hand, and blinks. “Really? Done?”
“There are a lot of just me in here, John. Boring.”
Sherlock puffed up his cheeks and blew out a slow breath. He steepled his fingers and scrunched up the bridge of his nose. He leaned down over his lap, where Bat John was now pacing on his thigh, back and forth, his wings now folded up tight against his back in indignation, back and forth, knee to hip, hip to knee, knee to  … kind of groin.
Sherlock didn't deny this. Something was stuck. He was stuck.
“Out with it, John. What’s wrong?”
Oh, how he misses his Johnling.
Erebel holds up her wings and stretches, and Sherlock reaches down and nuzzles her.
“Probably going on seven. Do you have your anatomy study group tonight?”
John made his way back to Sherlock and stood by his side. “Oh, yeah. That’s really nice.”
“What’s next, then? I’m voting for me taking care of you in a really long, hot shower, then going for a walk, then having dinner, and then going to the party. Then we’ll come back here and do the wall thing.”
Sherlock’s feet are slowing to a halt, the opposite of his thought processes, but Anahera nudges him again, and they keep moving. “Where were you, Anahera?”
“We don’t mind at all, do we Ariki? Would you like to interview us, too, Elder Erebus?”
“No. Nope. Not at all. Go back to sleep.”
Sherlock could not love John more. He doesn’t know why this surprises him. Every time he thinks he could not possibly love John more, he goes and loves John more.
“Hey,” John interrupted. “What does Kevin think?”
When Sherlock came out of the bathroom, drying his hands on a small towel, he said, “And
Greg sat and stared. He looked back and forth between John and Sherlock, and then to Molly, and then back to John and Sherlock. “All right, Sherlock, you can turn it down a bit.”
“It’s never the ones you’d expect, son, believe me,” the detective interjected. He looked tired, Sherlock thought, but kind. He gave John a brief pat on the shoulder and disappeared out the front door.
"Yeah, happierstill likes it, but I'm not sure it's my best work."
favourite, object of affection, lover, spouse, wife, husband
Sherlock switches shoulders and nods into that one.
“For god's sake, John, how old are you, three? We can share it.”
Sherlock danced closer and tugged John against him with one hand on his waist. John grinned at him and matched the movement, hand to waist, pelvis to thigh. This was their dance alone now, this simple gyration against each other, chests heaving, bellies pressed together.
“Shh. You aren’t taking anyone down, Rocky. I bet he’ll proposition you within five minutes of buying you a drink. Ask him what he had in mind, and play hard to get. Maybe hint that it would be easier to go out on a date if it weren't so hard to pay your rent. Be coy, act young, and needy, like you want him to take care of you. He’ll want you so bad at that point, he’ll offer anything.”
“What’d you have in mind?”
“John told me you like peas, so yes, it does,” she answered, smiling as she got into her car. “Have a good night.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to deduce that the armchair John is sitting in used to be owned by a Peruvian llama farmer when John leans toward Sherlock’s chair, grabs his suit jacket lapels, and says, “Deduce this, you mad git,” and kisses him soundly on those brilliant lips.
daughter
. That’s what they were calling it, as if they’d ordered it out of a catalog, and slotted it onto the side of the house. He didn’t think Mrs. Hudson was doing it on purpose, to avoid calling it the master bedroom, or his parents’ old bedroom. It just sort of happened, the way things and places acquired names that suited them, even if they didn’t really make sense.
Sherlock keeps calling, and they come. He calls for John while they approach, not because he has to anymore, but because he will always call for John.
So caught up in his thoughts, Sherlock jumps straight up in the air when he hears Anahera’s voice in his ear.
They shared a few minutes of reciprocal adoration, including a thorough snog and grope with the sun shining down on John’s back and Sherlock’s spread thighs, and then cleaned up the remains of their lunch and got ready to hike back toward Pitlochry.
We all make "Yeah, but" statements.
“You’ve revived me, John.” Sherlock lowered his voice, aware of the sound bouncing off the tiled floor and walls, not wanting to give Greg and Kevin another free show. “Lock the door, and come here.”

“I'm only going to keep asking, you know. You might as well tell me.”
“God, just do it, please, just do it.”
greedy, grasping, covetous
Bills to pay, a bed to make, maybe a dog to walk. A fridge to stock, favorite meals to cook. He could imagine stacks of books and shelves of objects they'd collected over the years: guidebooks, a conch shell, a stack of postcards, a framed photo of them—John laughing and Sherlock with sand in his hair and a stripe of sunscreen on his nose. Maybe he'd have a table of scattered science equipment, a microscope, and boxes of slides and test tubes in racks, and John would give it a wide berth until those days he couldn't take the mess anymore and he'd holler for Sherlock to clean it up.
“Did the meeting go well?”
John sighed.
Maryle impersonates a weasel; John revisits the Legend of Kororā with Erebus, and Sherlock tags along for support.
John looked up as Sherlock moved toward him. A glance, non-recognition; a gaze, a question; a stare, an invitation. Yes. Sherlock saw all that and one more clue, one sign that he had hoped for but not expected. John Watson would feel safe with Sherlock. Sherlock was dangerously different, and John would feel safe.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock slid his fingers into John’s pubic hair and swirled them in slow circles. “I’d like to take care of my husband now. I’d like to make him feel good. Very good. Exceptionally, outstandingly good.”
Anahera stares at him, and he’s not sure that she’s heard him at all. Then she kisses Tui’s cheek, and slips into position.
“Jesus, that’s incredible, so creamy, so smooth. My turn, yeah? Oh, please, touch it, yeah, show me how you clean a wand, mmm, that's right –”
Sherlock was not prepared. He hadn’t seen his niece or nephew in at least two years, and two years was a long time in the life of kids that age. Sharon hadn’t had barely any hair as a two-year-old, but now was the spitting image of Sherlock at the same age, and Michael bore a striking resemblance to Mycroft and their father.
“Oh. Oh, my. Oh, Sherlock.”
John is bordering on impertinence now, in tone if not word.
“Love,” John flicked again, “it.”
“Based on all the evidence available, yes, I do.”
“Not the mall. Please. Anything but the mall.”
of an emperor chick arriving into the world, his father showing him off to another dad, and the chick then chirping to an unhatched egg to help it hatch.

I've used another Polynesian language for the language of the seals: Samoan. I decided to translate it in the chapter, both because it works with the way Sherlock is processing it, and because I didn't want to make readers try to understand so much dialogue through context alone.
(See the end of the chapter for
John nodded.
“Anahera! Where have you been! We have been so worried about you, worried sick!”
“Probably not.”
“Oh my God, Sherlock, this was made for you.”
“You okay, Sherlpeng?”
John stepped away from the window and trailed his finger down the cover of the album, then looked at Sherlock and smiled.
“Do … what?”
“Yes, all right, fine. Is Miss Ross here, by any chance?”
Lestrade told them to have fun, walked into the throng of people gathered at the nearest bar, and disappeared.
“Sherlock?”
John laughed through his nose, an exhalation of doubt.
Anahera rests her head on Tui’s shoulder and smiles. “
“I am, actually. Get upstairs.”
They spent a few more minutes sipping their whiskeys in silence, each lost in their own thoughts, and when they were done John picked up the glasses and brought them to the kitchen sink. Sherlock’s hand was warm from where it had rested on John’s knee and twitched with wanting to place it back in the exact same spot for another hour or so. Instead, he had to settle for watching John look around a bit, taking in the assortment of science equipment, chipped crockery, and dry food goods scattered over the table and countertops. There was a packet of dark chocolate Hob Nobs on the counter, and John looked over at Sherlock and smiled. “You’ve got quite the sweet tooth, though, haven’t you?”
They finished preparing their meal and carried it into the dining room. John had lit the candles and Sherlock had found some soft music to play in the background. The food was delicious and the wine went down easily, but Sherlock was too distracted to finish. John kept one hand over Sherlock's on the table, as if trying to settle him.
You can't even imagine how many kitchens come up when you google "mint green cabinets black and white floor."
The others gather around them, Cetus, Siger, Erebus, each of them talking, asking questions, reaching for him.
And so with heads turned down and collars turned up against the light drizzle, they made their way down an alley, striding through an almost deserted midnight circus, and into the tiny, candlelit space with Angelo’s scrawled across the awning.
John rattled off some dubious sounding cocktail names and Greg went up to the bar to get them. John introduced Sherlock to Molly, and Sherlock tried to drag his lips away from John’s face long enough to shake her hand.
“Because.”
“God, look at that ass.” The mattress dipped again as John leaned down and kissed Sherlock’s bottom, two kisses, one on each cheek. “Magnificent.”
"So, Sherlock Holmes, tell me about yourself. What do you do other than keep the team on its toes with your amazing stats?”
“Whether you like it or not, Sherlock, your life is a reflection of the people around you. Your family, and friends. You’ll adapt. You can take private cases, or you can do something else. Surely you have interests to explore in this life other than solving crime?”
“Are those my slippers?”
“Why is that?”
“She wants you to mate with Janine.”
“Mycroft, let me ask you this. Regarding the task appointed to you when you were hatched --” and here Sherlock pauses to make sure Mycroft is tracking, “-- do you feel it is complete?”
“I don’t know. But just think, Sherlock, of what we could have done had we known!”
James recounted what he must have told John the night before. He’d been out to get his haircut at 10:00 a.m., driven by his driver who had stayed with him the entire time. They hadn’t been gone more than an hour and nothing looked disturbed when they got back to the house. He had read the newspaper for half an hour and eaten the lunch that his cook had prepared for him earlier in the day. The cook had left the house to do the grocery shopping when he and his driver had left for the barber. After eating he had watched the news, then had gone upstairs to his bedroom to fetch a book. It was then that he found the note on his nightstand, folded in half and propped up on its two ends. It had been written on a piece of paper from his own notepad and with his own pen. Nothing had been taken and there were no signs of a forced entry.
“Otter and hedgehog asks?”
“Thank you.”
John returned to 221b a changed man. He was no longer as pliable, no longer as prepared to sacrifice his own sensitivities at the altar of Sherlock's madness. He had been lied to, walked over, abused, and dismissed, and now he fairly thrummed with “don't even fucking try it” vibes. He seemed intent on exhibiting this newfound independence and fortitude through the most subtle of manoeuvres. He hogged the bathroom, he stopped buying the milk, never took out the garbage. He began using Sherlock's favourite mug, and rearranged the paperwork on the desktop to better suit him, and then he stopped asking if Sherlock would mind cleaning the body parts out of the fridge and began discarding them himself.
Sherlock relaxed in stages, from actively reminding himself to let go, to losing himself in the scent of eucalyptus and wintergreen, to drifting off into a drowsy half-sleep as his body melted and reformed under John’s capable hands. He was hardly aware of John’s attention to his hamstrings and calves, his heels and the soles of his feet.
Mr. Watson knelt in front of the fireplace and rebuilt the fire that'd dwindled during dinner, and Harry slipped away to make a phone call. Mrs. Watson brought in coffee, cups, dessert plates, and utensils on a serving tray, and Mrs. Hudson followed with two homemade pies: pumpkin, and apple.
Here's the thing. At my heart, I'm all about the relationship. Cases don't intrigue me the way Sherlock and John's relationships does. The plot of this story doesn't even intrigue me as much as the relationships of the various characters do. In other words, this chapter is really just another character study, and nothing happens, LOL.
Forty minutes later Mrs. Hudson called up the stairs asking if they were ready to go.
. After that, if anyone felt up for a third, Harry had added
Sherlock nodded. That, he could do. “I love you so much, John. Maybe I just don’t love myself enough to believe you could love me the way I love you.”
“Well then,” Sherlock asked James as he poured John a glass of wine, “what did you think of the tennis hut? Has John convinced you it should be turned into a guest house?”
“A date?” Anderson looked poleaxed.
“I don't know. I mean, it’s our relationship, but it's your family, so it was more up to you to decide when and how to share the news. It’s different for me. I don't really have anyone to tell.”
“Maybe I need to hear the question first. Give a guy some hope and all.”
Sherlock shrugged and pushed his empty plate into the middle of the table. “I think she’s going to wait and see how it plays out.”
"I would like that very much. I'll talk to your mama and we'll pick a date, all right?"
John lets one wing drift down Sherlock's side, then resettles it on Sherlock’s lower belly. He rubs in soft, tentative circles, and Sherlock presses himself into the touch. Emboldened, John slides his wingtip straight down Sherlock's midline. He pauses when Sherlock nips at John's throat.
“That’s what I truly want. Tonight. Let’s spend the day together doing whatever you want. We can run errands or do things around the house. We can go for a walk or go sightseeing, whatever you’d like. Then let’s have a quiet dinner here at home, a proper honeymoon dinner, and then I want you to take me to bed.”
Sherlock tried to spread his legs again, and this time John let him. John shifted and came up on his knees a bit, giving himself enough room to align his erection along Sherlock's ass and drag it back and forth. It left a trail of precome.
“Have you called over yet?”
He stood, hands lingering on John's waist, and brushed his nose against John's cheek. “For now, just sit here, on the edge of the bed, okay?”
John yanked the knot of his tie down and stared at his mother. “You've got to be kidding. I told you, Ma, no date.”
“So, what shall we do until we go to your house?”
“Me, too, John.”
“Dumfounded!” John shouts, wings up in a victory stance.
John pushes up on his toes and reaches for a stack of shoe boxes on the upper shelf of the bedroom closet. Sherlock watches him, noticing the way he winces when his shoulder is fully extended, then moves to nudge him out of the way and grab the boxes himself.
Sherlock brought the photo closer, staring at the two of them lying in the sun. They were on their backs, side by side, crossed arms cushioning their heads, legs bent at the knees. John was grinning up at the sky, and Sherlock was grinning at John.
I wrote this in a fevered, achy, exhausted, snotty haze. That there weren't as many errors as words is a mystery to me.
“So, why do you always insist on being on the outside?”
Sherlock took the box and set it down on the back seat, and John put the bag on top of it. He gave Sherlock a big grin, and for a moment Sherlock thought they were just going to sit in the parking lot, but then John shook his head, put the car into gear, and said, “Sorry. I’m just really, you know, glad we’re doing this.”
Sherlock drags his feet, plants his wings, and jumps to a stand. He calls. He calls louder and longer than any peng has ever called before, of this he is absolutely sure. He calls for John, over and over and over again, trumpeting the long stretch of beautiful sounds that make up John’s unique call. There is no other call for Sherlock to make in this moment, no other combination of notes. There never has been.
"Do you ever feel bad that we can't fly anymore? I mean, can you imagine what that would be like? To move that fast, and be that free?"
Sherlock made sure to show John the gifs of the lookalike actors doing lewd things to each other, John admitted to having already seen them, and they got busy reenacting each and every scene.
“Christ. You're going to need to roll me home.”
, Tahu-John.” John absentmindedly pats him on the head and locks eyes with Sherlock.
“Eat breakfast first.”
“John. I need to see you. All of you.”
“Oh my god. As if I’d ever be afraid of that fucker.”
“That’s … yeah, that’ll do for now. Jesus.” John was closer to the box of tissues on the nightstand, so he reached over and tossed it onto Sherlock’s chest.
Ass in hand, it was impossible to not want more, so he circled John’s curves, first one side, then the other, and let his fingers slip down to the tops of John’s thighs, and then into the space between his legs, and back up. He ran his fingertips as lightly as he could over the fine hairs on John’s rear, and felt raised goosebumps on his next pass.
And here, Sherlock stops, because he has told them everything, but nothing at all, absolutely nothing. He touches the seaweed wrapped heartstone that lies against his chest, and shakes his head.
, and everyone was happy.
picking up a slightly more respectable number of followers.
"But I only had a drop, just a taste! Was it that potent? Would one little drop have been enough to cause that kind of reaction?"
It was light, too light, just a tease, so Sherlock leaned into it, arching his back, letting the weight of his cock hanging between his legs and the stimulation of his nipple cause him to shake. “Oh – more – please – harder –”
“God, John.”
John caught up to Sherlock at the door and grabbed his arm. “Come here, gorgeous.”
“We just had pound cake.”
“Yeah?”
“I don’t know. Sherlock, am I a rascal?”
“Which do you prefer?” Sherlock asked, holding up two boxes of lights. “Blinking colors or solid white?” He could feel the crease at the top of his nose furrowing, his eyebrows drawing tight.
“Something 'bout you giving me a blow job.”
“Great. Perfect. Glad to hear it. Do you want to head out, then? I can lock up.”
“Hey.” John pulled Sherlock’s arm away and leaned down to kiss him. “Can I?”
“Anything? I’d like a locked room triple murder case and Anderson nowhere in sight.”
“I imagine so. If he didn’t know a few hours ago, he does now.”
“You have my promise,
“Oh! Wait. Let me just, you know, run to the bathroom for a sec. I'll be right back.”
John settles down on his haunches and shuffles to make himself comfortable. Sherlock wants to sit right on top of him. "So? What did she say?"
“That’s sweet of you, Sherlock, but I’m just doing my usual chores. Why don’t you boys go in the kitchen and get something to eat or drink, if you want.”
Also, it'll be Tuesday where I am in about an hour, so close enough.

"Me?"
“I told you last night, you are my family.”
“It's fine, it's fine, I've got them. Just a little twinge, nothing too bad.”
Back in his bedroom, he grabbed the navy blue-on-blue striped silk robe from inside his closet, slipped into it, and faced the mirror on the inside of the closet door. Mycroft had sent him this robe a couple of years ago when he’d been on assignment somewhere in Southeast Asia, but he’d never worn it. Now he wondered why. It clung to him, as if painted on by the very mulberry worms that’d spun the silk.
“It was on page seven. You and John will enter from opposite ends of the veranda and meet at the start of the aisle. You’ll be preceded by two flower girls and two ring bearers. When you get to the top of the aisle you’ll stop and face each other. The bishop will guide you from there. Clear?”
Olive continues to beam.
“To do this.” Sherlock lifted up and reached down between his legs, wrapping his hand around John’s cock and positioning it between his cheeks. He rolled the leaking head in circles around his entrance, slick pre-come coating him.
“Shush, I can speak for myself! I am Kahu of Tane and Ana. It’s very nice to meet you,
“With what?”
Alice returned to the table a few minutes later and held out her cell phone to John. Within five minutes of talking to Annette, they’d agreed that she’d come to the house each day of the work week from noon til 5:00 p.m., and when they’d deemed the house was back in acceptable condition, she could cut back her hours to three days a week. She’d be responsible for hiring handymen, as well, and Sherlock could tell by the smile on John’s face that she already knew which brothers, cousins, and friends would be right for specific jobs.
"Like this meaning with a cross-dressing instructor, or ..."
"You should not go check, John. Ariki and Kahu have been doing this almost as long as we have."
And that's how far he'd fallen, he thought to himself. That's how far. He couldn't even come up with a proper criticism or scathing put-down of these half-crazed otter aficionados.
“Well, if there was something to read, I read it, otherwise, yeah, I was looking at the pictures. I mean, I had no idea about some of those things. Like, you know, rimming.”
Mr. Watson jangled the keys attached by a chain to his belt loop as they walked down Aisle 2, out the exit of Peck’s, through the parking lot, and to the door of his Ford F550 farm truck. He didn’t stop jangling the keys then, though, because the doors were unlocked, so they all climbed in and sat there while Mr. Watson continued to jangle his keys.
Sherlock woke up the next morning in what was becoming his customary position: wrapped around John. Thinking about John’s encouraging words at the river the day before, Sherlock fought the urge to leave and stayed where he was. In fact, he moved closer. He buried his nose in the back of John’s warm neck and brushed his fingers tentatively along John’s arm where it lay close to his chest.
Sherlock shot him a look but stayed on topic. “The equation for the volume of a cylinder is pi times r-squared times height.”
“Would you like that?”
John yawns and the intake of air must revive his thought processes, because he goes from mostly still asleep to very much awake before his bill has closed. He steps back from Sherlock and plunges his head down toward the egg.
"Check the freezer if you want. I had strawberry frozen yoghurt last night. And why are you so hung up on – oh god. What'd you do to the ice cream?"
“Sounds good.”
“Perhaps you would care to enlighten me?”
“Indeed.” Anahera looks back and forth between Sherlock and John, and smiles. “It sounds like a thoroughly exhausting afternoon, all told. Why don’t you leave these little urchins with us, and go take some time to yourselves?”
“Let’s go see the U-505, too. It’s the only German submarine in the U.S.”
“Look, Papa, the bees are going into the hives, they must be getting ready for the party!”
Sherlock kissed him again, his mouth, his nose, his eyebrow and forehead. "Mm. Okay. Let's get you better. This is the first time I'm the doctor."
"Oh. Yes. It's just ... what is this, under your dress?"
"Yeah, well, he's not acting very lucky right now. He's acting like a jealous prat."

“I tore your stockings. Both of them. They're totally ruined. I'm really sorry.”
“I, you know, I, in the shower, for this. Cleaned.”
“Killed me. You should, you know, register yourself, deadly weapon.”
”But, you told me. When it was all over, after the—when we went back home that day, I asked you if it was my fault, if it was because I was sick, and you said they’d been on their way home because—”
Sherlock stood behind John and rested his hands on his hips. “I see why you like it. It’s very
Over the course of the morning, Sherlock and John find and talk to Ariki, Cetus, Siger, and Olive. Although not a council member, Olive has the ear of the entire colony, and promises to spread the word herself. Sherlock and John speak freely with her about the day of Anahera’s disappearance. The three of them were looking for each other, they explain, excited to share an idea that would give Sherlock and John a hatchling of their own. Olive listens, empathetic and kind, and vows to come to them immediately if she learns anything that might be important, no matter how small a detail.
“It does. You have a beautiful voice.”
Behind him Anahera titters, then coughs to disguise the sound of her amusement. He can imagine Tui poking her in the ribs, a silent reprimand to behave herself.
Sherlock poured two more glasses of Port and handed one to John. He leaned down for one more kiss and followed John out of the kitchen, turning out the lights behind them. “I think I might head up now if you don’t mind. I want to go over my notes from today and make a list of things to follow up on tomorrow.”
He didn’t want to be caught snooping, although looking at photographs on a bedside table could hardly be called that, so he climbed into bed, turned off his light, and pulled the covers up under his arms. Uncomfortable, he sat up a bit, then shuffled down again, trying to figure out how to look casual while lying in someone else’s bed. No, not someone else’s bed. His husband’s bed, he told himself, and therefore his bed, too. What would he do at home? He’d not lie there on his back staring at the canopy of the bed, that’s for damn sure. He turned onto his side, facing the inside of the bed, and soon enough heard the bathroom door open and close.
“Annette.”
“I do?”
John runs his fingers through Sherlock's hair, combing out damp tangles and pushing the hair out of his eyes, and Sherlock tilts his face up and smiles, presses a kiss to John's jaw, and says, “Don't tell me you're not impressed.”
“Very, very, extremely tiny.”
Sherlock met John’s eye and John kissed him, just a peck on the lips. Out of the corner of Sherlock’s eye, he saw one of the two men bump the other’s elbow and jerk his chin in their direction. Sherlock gave John another quick kiss. “I don’t want to be like that.”
“Jesus, you’re freezing. Get in here.”
“You're okay with being short, but you're not okay being adorable?”
“Merry Christmas! Hi John, Sherlock, how are you?”
“Let’s get undressed, then. Help me?”
“Right, that." Sherlock thinks for a minute. "Tell him you were defending my honor in hopes of getting laid, but that I flaked, and it didn't work out.”
“Come here, love.”
Sherlock sniffed, then nodded. When he spoke he sounded congested, and later he'd wonder if that's why the words got so stuck. “I did. I loved it, and I … I … you're everything to me, John. You mean everything to me.”
“Sherlock, we have not forgotten about the gift you presented upon your return. We are close to making an announcement about that, as well.”
put things to rest in his mind before turning his attention fully to Sherlock. “Yes. Yes, I, too, have had a very interesting conversation.”
Sherlock rolled over, bringing his eager erection with him. He folded his arms under his head and tried, rather unsuccessfully, to glare at John. “Look. Look at what you’ve done.”
Mrs. Watson had her back to them, and was whisking something as she poured it onto a griddle. Harry sat at the table, slumped over a glass of orange juice. She was still in her pajamas and a terrycloth robe, and had pulled her hair back into a messy ponytail. She raised her head when they came in, looked back and forth between them, and sighed. Mr. Watson was still thumping around upstairs, probably getting dressed.
“Mmm, that’s beautiful, Sherlock. A work of art. I’m rather proud of the results, to be honest with you.”
“Shhh. Don’t worry about me. I’ll take care of myself later. Right now, I just want to hold you and tell you how amazing that was, how hot it was to see you so on edge, that out of your mind. I can’t wait to do that together, to do that to you. I don’t care if it’s tomorrow or two weeks from now or two months from now, because I know it’s going to be spectacular.” John was speaking the words against Sherlock’s temple, stroking his arm and neck, kissing into his curls. “Come up here, let’s get you under the covers.”
Sherlock drank some of the spinach smoothie. Did John think he was unhealthy? Weak? Too thin? Tired. He was too tired.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see. Well then,
Mycroft clears his throat.
“I never got that far. I registered with the agency and received my first batch of folders but never contacted any of the candidates. Since I forgot them here and couldn’t send them back I haven’t been sent any others.”
“You don’t like it.”
“No problem,” John said, still grinning like an idiot. What was he grinning about? Breaking up with people was not a grinning matter.
John smiled. “Why?”
“How many nights do I get to stay with you and Granddad?”
“Okay. It started like this. How did Moringa hurt her foot? She fell. She must’ve fallen from a great height. Why was she at a great height? Was she looking for something? Someone? What? Who? Where?” He pauses. “See?”
“Happy birthday, John.”
“You conspired. Against me.”
John came closer, teasing a finger along the curve of Sherlock's jaw, nosing against his temple. Sherlock risked movement, took a step closer, and rested his hands on John’s waist.
The restroom was dimly lit and cool, a quiet oasis away from the nonstop buzz of the main room. A pistachio-green, upholstered armchair sat in a small antechamber just through the door, and above it was a chalkboard on which customers had scrawled their initials, preferred cocktails, and notes to other customers.
They weren't out the door thirty seconds when Sherlock said, “Really? A canoe?”
“I didn't – I didn't know. Until that night, the Fourth of July, in the back of the truck. Oh,
“Well, he obviously can’t go alone, love. He’s right, Mycroft should stay here and steer the committee, but that means Sherlock would be on his own, in the middle of winter, who knows where, for gods knows how long. I don’t think so, do you?”
“That's – oh fuck – that's ridiculous.”
He didn't start panicking until the sun started to set, and then he panicked so hard he had to put his head between his knees and take breaths as deep down as he could, and he cursed himself for being such an idiot. John was going to take him up on his offer.
Chapter 4: Sunday, December 20, day
Sherlock opens his eyes. His vision fills with white and silver, black and yellow, a streak of orange under black. The colours float in disparate shapes, then travel towards each other, slotting together, this way and that, until the scene is settled. Anahera and Mycroft. He’s back.
“And was there any one moment when something felt different for you, felt more … more?”
“Well, my mouth isn’t covered, is it?”
Together they picked up empty cans of Valvoline and tossed them into the large metal barrel in the corner, that served as a trash can.
“You’re brilliant.”
Sherlock gave John one last lingering kiss and pulled back enough to see him clearly.
“Sorry, morning breath.”
"You wish for evaluation of, and ruling on, the accusations brought against Moringa by the Pobeda Council. I can assure you that this, too, shall come to pass.
Sherlock stood and walked backwards down the stairs until he was a few feet away, then held out his hand and pulled John to his feet. “It’s the neighborhood where all the Swedes immigrated to when they came to Chicago. There are still quite a few Swedish influences, but it’s also become a gentrified residential area for gay and lesbian couples of a certain age, income, and lifestyle.”
“Sherlock? Half-time, yeah?”
“The average American male is five feet, nine-and-a-half inches. I'm five six.”
“I’m glad you think so.”
“That should do it.”
. He can see them clear as ice. Sherlock steps closer, and without opening his eyes, he bows down and touches his forehead to the stone.
Good job Sherlock, way to prioritize a hand job over the inferno of doom.
John smiled up at him and Sherlock hunched down for a kiss. “It’s been a great trip. It’s been perfect. I’m ready to go, but I don’t know if I’m ready to go home. It’ll be pretty quiet and dull after being here with you.”
Turning back to the bar John took the last ticket for a triple espresso. He could see Marcus in the back room clocking in on the computer. He would be relieving John in a minute and then he was finally free to go.
“But of course they will –”
Greg chewed thoughtfully, then crossed his arms over his chest and looked up at the ceiling. “Hmm. I guess I like putting things to order. It’s not so much that I like the process of solving a problem, but I like the satisfaction that comes with knowing it’s fixed.”
He turns around and Sherlock slowly bends at the knees, his thighs framing John's legs as he slides down and reaches for the dropped keys. He mouths at John's erection through his pants, turning his head to the side to gently bite at the shaft. John jerks forward, swears again, and pulls Sherlock up by the hair.
Sherlock is yawning himself awake and stretching like a contented cat, and John smiles sleepily at him from his pillow and says, “Hey, do you remember our first time?”
“Want to get in bed?”
Annette popped through the doorway with a grin on her face and a shopping bag in her hand. “Late start to the morning, boys?”
Sherlock nodded absentmindedly and frowned at his menu. Did John currently have someone to feed him up? He was ninety-eight percent positive that Molly wasn’t fulfilling that role, but his powers of observation were muddled by something he suspected were the stupid, pesky emotions flooding his system, the same emotions that made him break out in a cold sweat whenever he thought about John. Or looked at him. Or caught John looking at him.
“Because I don’t let you in the bathroom with me when I need to evacuate.”
“I doubt she was thinking about me when she wrote deathbed letters to you and Hannah. John, it's been a very long time. You're still very angry. I think you need to brace yourself for not hearing what you want, for possibly reading something that will make you even far more angry.”
One late night, a dozen days into their journey, Sherlock miscalculates the anticipated degrees of the sun, which causes a gross extrapolation of the curve of the earth, and a frighteningly large number of minimum days of separation. Muttering fractions and equations to himself, Sherlock freezes mid-number, gasps, and shudders.
“You talk to them, too,” answers Kahu.
"Said, ‘That's not what I mean, and you know it.’“
“All right,” Greg said. “I don’t recognize them, but I’m going to say the shorter one is a fisting bottom who’s into bondage, and the taller one is a dildo-loving daddy with a navel kink.”
“Are you sure I’m not too heavy?”
A linear path would have given Sherlock something to hold on to, something to expect and anticipate, but John was not in a particularly linear mood, and his mouth was veering side to side, up and down, exploring and teasing and leaving a wake of gooseflesh where he'd been. Sherlock tried to catalogue the different sensations, told himself not to forget to set up a spreadsheet later in which he could record and rank body parts (nipples, hip, belly, ribs, outer thigh, groin) against sensations (sensitivity, sensuality, heat, involuntary movement, vocalization).
“Awake,” Sherlock answered, rolling his hips, sliding against John's soft skin.
“Mmm.”
“And how about this?” Sherlock sucked John’s fingers down deep and tight and bobbed his head up and down.
It was a matter of ten minutes before they were at the address Annette had sent, and then another thirty seconds before they’d climbed three flights of steep stairs and were standing on a quiet, dark landing outside the door to a flat.
“Yeah. Yeah, I think I do. I really do.”
“John, young sir, as I approached the crèche this morning, I believe I overheard you say something about a seal tooth. Would that be correct?”
John had folded The Guardian in half, and half again, and was reading an article about rugby, or football, or cricket, or some sport involving a ball, while spooning heaps of ice cream into his mouth. Sherlock knew he'd picked wisely, as John could never resist ice cream. He'd have to make note of that flavour, keep it in consideration for future experimentation.
“How long do you think it’ll take? I mean, no rush, of course. I’m sure you’re busy with studying and exams and all that.”
Both Greg and Kevin were already showered and dressed. Sherlock thought Greg’s sweater looked a little big for him, and wondered if it was Kevin’s. No doubt Greg had planned to spend the night, which led Sherlock to believe that Greg had brought his own clothes, and simply wanted to wear Kevin’s sweater, and if that wasn’t the most sickeningly sweet thing ever, he didn’t know what was.
“I’m going to try something fancy,” John said under his breath, the two of them standing at the counter.
“I said I didn't want to talk about it, but I’m still thinking about it. Not fair to you.”
Sherlock seeks answers, because that's what Sherlock does.
John padded into the kitchen, and out of sight. Sherlock heard him quietly opening cupboards, then the clink of glass. What was taking so long? He looked down at himself, his cock straining up and out, undoubtedly looking for John. He smirked at the idea that his cock had a brain of its own. This must be what people meant when they talked about men having two heads. The cock wants what the cock wants, and his cock wanted to know what was taking so long?
“For leaving me?”
This was different, because this was him wanting, and choosing, and planning. This was him purposefully trying to create something with the person he had fallen in love with, and who had fallen in love with him. This was the family he’d chosen, not the one he'd been born into.
John shrugged. “I don’t mind going to hang out with friends, but I don’t have any burning desire to frequent them regularly. Our time together is short. I don’t want to waste it.”
John tossed his towel over his shoulder and crowded Sherlock up against the wall. “No, but it should be. He's perfect.”
“Incredible. Better than I’d imagined. And I’d imagined it a lot.”
“Specifically Sir, I don’t understand why your elders disregarded the lessons taught by Kororā. Not just her spoken words, but the consequences of Pono’s death, too.
Sherlock and Mycroft give each other a curt nod and turn back to their parents. Olive is beaming at them, her head raised high toward the sun, her wings folded neatly over her belly.
John joined him on the couch again and let out a contented sigh as Sherlock kissed his temple.
to the rotation.
“That’s not what I was going to say.”
“It is. You see, my brother – oh, dear me, excuse my manners. I am Mycroft, and this is my brother, Sherlock. We hail from Pobeda, but have been sent by our father and council leader, Siger, to consult with the High Council on a matter of great urgency.”
“Hello, handsome,” John said.
“Stranger things have happened.” John winked, closed the door behind her, and came back to the table where Sherlock had shredded his nanomaterials notes into several hundred pieces.
“For what?”
“You bastard, let me try it!”
“It's a little warm in here. I'm fine, though. More than fine.”
Sherlock felt John’s cock bump and slide against his own. He tilted his hips forward, the glide of soft-hard over hard-soft raising gooseflesh on his skin, making the hairs on his legs stand up.

“Sherlock,” John said, rubbing and pinching his brow with his thumb and index finger. “Thank you. I don’t know what to say, and thank you doesn’t begin to cover it, but … thank you.”
"Only because you forgot to imagine the stockings and garters, too."
“I do not have that journey in me right now, to be honest. It was essential when I left Cassiopeia, because of Moringa’s subversive actions regarding the tooth. That was absolutely a matter for the High Council. And the heartstone is, as well, but we need time with it here, in our own colony, if we are to benefit from what it represents.”
“I have done very little, young one. I have complete faith in you. I wish you godsspeed, Sherlock, and I will look eagerly toward the day you come home to us.”

“Yes, Ma’am, it is.”
Mrs. Watson fussed with the deli meat, sealing ziplock bags and stacking them up near her plate. “Waste of money, if you ask me. We can open a bottle of fizzy wine right here just as well as we can somewhere else.”
“Sleep on floes.”
Sherlock crossed the room and crawled in next to John, curling into his open arms and the warmth of his body. John's fingertips scrolled over Sherlock's back and dipped into the waistband of his briefs.
“As long as it’s not Merlot, I’m fine with anything,” Sherlock answered.
John pinched the plump flesh of Sherlock’s ass, then kissed the tingling away. He licked Sherlock's balls, rubbed his nose up Sherlock's cleft, rubbed his thumbs over Sherlock's lower back.
“No. It looks rather like something that an old lady would wear.”
Sherlock considers. “I don't know. Erebus believes that he and Selvic are together forever, for all time, even beyond this life. They weren't bonded.”
John looked back and forth between Sherlock and James. “Why is that interesting?”
They stand and watch the bees go about their business for a few minutes, caught up in the mesmerizing movements of the tiny creatures. Sherlock announces that the party must be well underway and that they should head home, and when they're far enough from the hives Imi asks to be put down so she can collect some of Granddad's favourite flowers, the purple, round-headed rampion. She knows that he likes them because they remind him of Papa, because they're the colour of the shirt Papa is wearing in the wedding photograph of them on the mantelpiece. Papa says that the shirt doesn't fit him anymore – Granddad said it barely fit him all those years ago – but Granddad has kept it folded up in a special box on a shelf in his closet.
“Oh my God, look at us! We were babies! Kevin, you look the same, just shorter.”
“Says the man who spends most of his day with bees. So, what are you two up to now? Ready for lunch?” John moves to the kitchen and starts rummaging around in the cabinets and under the sink for a vase, settles on an old mason jar, and holds it under the tap.
"Hi Sherlock, I'm Molling!"
The departure lanes were packed with traffic, and they crawled ahead, inch by inch, watching the security cops waving cars into drop-off spots, and blowing their whistles at those who needed to keep moving.
“Out of her mind.”
The VFW stands for Veterans of the Foreign Wars. They work to rehab vets and provide assistance to the families of deceased vets. They have Posts all over the country, and when I was a little girl, my mother's father, who served in France and Africa in WWII, would go up the street from our house to hang out with other vets, to attend organized events, etc. We went to a Christmas party there once, and I won a bottle of dishwashing soap in the raffle.
“If Tui were well enough,” Anahera says, “we could go with you. We know the way like the backs of our wings.”
John watched Sherlock stretch out beside him, all long limbs and floppy hair. John watched, and then he stared, because he could now. He could stare as long as he wanted at those gorgeous, lithe legs and those strong shoulders and curved forearms. He could ogle those straining buttons and that ridiculous length of neck with its tendons stretching and pulling and—”
“I have applied the same reason to this as I have to any conflict between the rational and irrational. When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
Sherlock kissed him again, because John was in love with him.
Sherlock had an image flash before his eyes, crisp as a high res photo. He saw John lying underneath him, legs spread and wrapped around his waist, pale inner thighs exposed, chest flushed, his face contorted in pleasure, his shoulders sliding against the mattress as Sherlock made love to him.
“Anyway,” Sherlock continued, “what are your plans for the weekend, while John and I are exploring Bucktown and Logan Square?”
John appeared soon enough, insisted on making tea and toast before logging in—god, it was like waiting for your parents on Christmas morning!—and then plopped himself down next to Sherlock while grumbling about somebody's impatience. Sherlock didn't care who was bothering John with their impatience, he just wanted to move ahead to the part where John said yes and they could kiss and maybe rub their penises against each other.
“Annette,” John said, a look of complete befuddlement on his face, “she could’ve killed you.”
Sherlock can tell that John is trying not to laugh. This business of charging a seal is not funny in the least, but Tui is alive, and Sherlock is calling that seal a piece of poo, and now Anahera is laughing so hard she can barely stand.

Sherlock looks at Mycroft and widens his eyes, tilts his head, tweaks his bill fractionally to the right. Mycroft narrows his eyes, wrinkles his forehead, twitches his bill to the left. Sherlock stares. Mycroft blinks. Sherlock stares. Mycroft sighs.
The seal twists away, roaring in their underwater battlefield. Sherlock hovers, suspended near her open, raging mouth. Her teeth are a line of daggers, soldiers constantly at the ready. One long, black feather swirls over her tongue, dances delicately out of reach, and floats away.
Ariki and Kahu wave their tiny wings at Sherlock and John as Olive prods them along. She calls over her shoulder, “Siger wants to see you after breakfast,
Sherlock has waited long enough. He’s going to seduce John Watson. He’s going to be as brilliant as he can be, and John is going to fall madly in love with him.
John snapped his head up. “Not like it? Not - oh, God. This is an 1830, fifth edition Caspar Wistar, Sherlock. Not like it? How on earth did you – this would’ve cost – I can’t believe – fuck.”
“I remember.”
Not content with a sample size of one, Sherlock kissed John again, again and again, and when he felt sure he had enough kisses to safely say that love was at play, he moved away long enough to post a picture of an otter and a hedgehog in flagrante, which caused a sizable subset of Tumblr to go into a reblogging frenzy, which resulted in the Tumblr servers crashing for approximately sixteen hours. When the site came back online, Sherlock and John were not really surprised to see they had each gained several thousand followers, no small percentage of which were porn bots.
John scraped together the last of his dignity. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have assumed anything. I should have talked to you about this, first. Probably years ago.”
“You're not disappointed, if we don't …”
The photos were from 2002, when Sherlock and John were six-years-old.
“I’ll take that as a yes. What I don’t know,” Sherlock continued, “is if you’re helping Daniel out of the goodness of your heart or if you have a connection to one of James’ cadets. I suppose we’ll find out soon enough, won’t we?”
John nodded. “When was the last time you talked to Mycroft?”
He squirmed until John came back into view, staring down at him, mouth open and wet. Sherlock needed to kiss, needed John’s tongue in his mouth. He surged up, and John lowered himself down onto Sherlock, his belly and chest settling on Sherlock’s, both of them angling their heads, their mouths meeting in an open, panting invitation to intrude.

Greg was just three seconds behind him, offering John and Sherlock one more handshake, nodding in agreement to everything Kevin said, and then they were gone, disappearing behind the bedroom’s clicking shut, locking tight, French doors.
John shifted under Sherlock, spreading his thighs and lifting his hips.
“Yes,
“Like what? Movies?”
“John. Look at you. You’re so handsome. My gods.”
“I don’t care.”
“‘Oh my God, you're gay?’” John said in a petulant falsetto. “She said I looked too straight to be gay and what a fucking waste it was.”
This is how they speak of love.
Sherlock crawled into John’s lap and John hugged him tightly. “I’ll help, if only to get him out of here as soon as possible.”
Sherlock’s ears prick to attention.

“What time do you think it is?”
He ignored the tap, and kissed John again. For some reason, ignoring the tapping was not making it go away.
“You said, ‘and we only just realized how we really feel about each other,’ and so I'm asking you, how do we really feel about each other?”
✓ buy wine!
“Right?”
Erebus shakes his head and shuffles closer to Sherlock. He lowers his voice and says, “I do not know how to explain, but to say that we made that egg together, the three of us.”
Sherlock kissed him and wriggled down deeper into the cushions. “How was the rest of your day? How were your parents?”
“The tooth is not important.”
It was more than Sherlock could stand, to spread his usual reserve of steadfastness so thin, to be speared on the reach of his own heart, spilling open everything he had worked so hard to protect for so long, and so he pulled John forward by the collar of his shirt and then tilted him up with his hands on either side of his face, and he kissed him. When he couldn’t kiss him any longer for fear of passing out, he rested his forehead on the top of John’s head and breathed, and when John said, “Yes, of course, I’ll love you. Of course I will. I already do, you fool. Of course I do,” Sherlock thought he might pass out for real.
“Sshh.” John kissed each eyelid, his eyebrows, the bridge of his nose.
John pulled the covers up and tucked them around Sherlock's shoulders. “You're insane, and I love you.”
Harry sat up a little straighter.
There, he had done it. He had gone too far. Sherlock looked down at the table and bit down hard on the inside of his lower lip. “I apologise. That was—”
They’d climbed into the back of the truck with a stack of blankets, arranged them in layers, almost businesslike in their efficiency. Then, under endless stars and the soft boom of distant fireworks, they’d gone frantic for each other, tugging off clothes and jostling for position, the unusual roughness turning it all up from desperate to crazed.
“Yes. Me, too. I’d be attracted to you even if we didn’t know each other, but knowing you so well, for so long, seems to magnify that desire.”
Sherlock reminds himself to breathe.
“Right—through—the mattress—Sherlock, take it—take all of it.”
Lunch was a messy, drippy, but satisfying affair, and by the time they were done John was stretching his arms over his head and yawning. Sherlock suggested they make one last stop before they hopped back on the El, and when John shot him a less-than-enthusiastic look, Sherlock mentioned the word
And then Ariki and Kahu are in front of them, and Sherlock half expects the young pengs to peck at it, or try to skip it, or sit on it. He does not expect Ariki to bypass the stone altogether, to come to stand in front of him, hug him tight, and whisper, “Thank you, Sherlo-kimi. Thank you.”
John came at him fast, pushing him backward with the flats of his hands, and Sherlock went down, hard, bouncing onto the sleeper sofa. John ripped Sherlock’s sock off, yanked his underwear down, flung them over his shoulder, and pounced on him. He caged him from above, using his knees to spread Sherlock’s legs. “All night, you and your fucking tight shirt and soft hair and your lips, your fucking lips, licking and sipping and pouting, I cannot stand it, Sherlock.”
“No. I want to take a nap. With you. Will you? Come to bed?”
John hits the print button on the screen in front of him and leans back in his chair. The printer starts humming, then spitting out paper in energetic bursts. He runs one finger along the edge of the open file folder in his lap, flattening the curling corners while he waits for the printer to finish. This folder has been the centre of his life for the last six months, and as he closes it, he feels a sense of professional satisfaction and achievement that he hasn't felt for a very long time. He reads the scribbled words on the front again.
They stand together until the High Council has left the way they came, single file, silent. As the last sweep of tail on ice fades from earshot, they turn toward each other. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock sees Terina lead Anahera and Tui back toward the heart of the colony. There will be time for them to talk, later.

“So good.”
“I did.”

Sherlock increased his pace, slurping up to the flare of John’s crown, sucking hard, ducking back down. John’s erection stiffened even more, although how that was possible, Sherlock had no idea. John jerked up, hard, and Sherlock felt him hit the back of his throat.
Merz Apothecary is amazing. AMAZING. You can shop them
John gave one hard nip to Sherlock's nipple and Sherlock, anticipating that he would stutter out a groan, opened his mouth and heard himself say, “What happened to the photo of you and Major Sholto that you had by the side of the bed along with your other cherished photos of loved ones?”
Sherlock held his breath and told his penis to remain asleep, told it that the thumb was an interloper and would soon be moving on. Sherlock's penis, completely done with being ignored, went out to investigate anyway, lengthening and thickening until it had achieved the proper dimensions to press directly into John's thumb and get a better sense of what was happening. Sherlock silently cursed his penis. His penis cursed back, then solicited the aid of Sherlock's hips. Sherlock ordered his hips to stay still, but they blatantly mocked him and rocked up a bit so that his penis could get an even better feel of the thumb.
“Erebus has never lied to us before, Sherlock. I doubt he would start doing so now.”
“Oh, you'd be surprised.”
John just huffed out an embarrassed sounding laugh and walked around to the other side of the bed. “This should work out well because I always sleep on the left side.”
John, though, is content to let his imagination fill in the blanks. “Have you seen those eels when we’re hunting, Sherlpeng? Depraved, the whole lot of them. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if she turned her back on them and went after something better.”
“It’s not as if John and I were responsible for him almost being killed,” Sherlock said, popping up from under the desk.
“Oh! I have to do something about it, do I? I think I can manage that, gorgeous.” John moved behind Sherlock and pulled his shirt out of his jeans, then reached around and started unbuttoning it. Sherlock stayed still and watched John’s hands strip him.
Downstairs, the floorboards creaked. He wondered if Mrs. Hudson was still having a hard time with her hip, and not sleeping well. He listened for her to go back to her room, wanting to be sure she was okay before he attempted to fall back asleep. Instead of going back to her room, though, she was coming up the stairs. What –
the power to bring them back?
When the sun is a feather's width above the horizon, Sherlock taps John on the shoulder. He taps harder. He puts both wings on John's shoulders and gives him a tiny shake. He gives John a bigger shake. He is about to give John a rather large shake, when John opens one eye and glares at Sherlock. John looks at the sky, no doubt judging the time of morning, and glares at Sherlock again, with both eyes this time.
Greg stood up, put all his winter gear back on, and slung his messenger bag over his shoulder. He gave Sherlock a pointed look. “And call me.”
“Traitor,” Sherlock growled, as he turned left out of his driveway.
“Mmhmm,” John hummed, his breath closer to Sherlock’s thigh than a moment before.
"That looks about right."
Pāpā Selvic.”
“In me. Get in me, now.”
- just about all of it applies.
“Just a bit. We can do the rest later.”
The doctor listened to Sherlock's heart and peered into his ears and nose and mouth, but when Sherlock tried to return the favour the doctor wagged her finger at him and told him to stay still. He wagged his finger back and yelled, “No still no!” When the poking and prodding was done she set him down on the floor, where he occupied himself by making puddles of exam table crepe paper on the linoleum floor.
Sherlock ran his cockhead between John’s cheeks again, stopping over his hole. He wanted it so bad, wanted to push in and watch John swallow him up. They hadn’t talked about it, though, and Sherlock wanted it to happen on his birthday. He wanted to always remember that on the day he turned twenty, he’d made love to John Watson. Still, John was fluttering against him, and it was so easy to lean in, to apply a bit more pressure. John’s body was burning hot here, and Sherlock could feel that greedy hole grabbing at the silky skin on offer.
“Yeah.” John took a deep breath and blew it back out. “Maybe I was just frustrated that I didn't know how to show you, so I imagined someone else making it happen for us.”
“Well, she's bonded now, for one.”
Sherlock stopped and tugged free of John’s hand. “John! You should’ve told him that
“You said, back at the mall, that your dad doesn't mind that we’re ‘dating.’ And I don't think ‘dating’ accurately represents what we’re doing.”
“Look,” John says. His voice is low and rough, the rumble of a calving iceberg. “Look at our lives, Sherlock, look at the evidence of all we have done.”
John smirked at him and finished towel drying his hair, then wrapped the towel around his waist and tugged him out of the bathroom. “How do you think I know, gorgeous?”
“And these pants do great things for your ass. Not as great as the things I’m about to do to it, but you should wear them more often.”
“Dorothy was supposed to go, but changed her mind when the weathermen proved themselves right. Quite a storm. Haven’t seen one like that since oh-eight.”
John stood and picked up the stack of dishes in front of his mother, then turned and put them in the sink.
A little buzz moves up Sherlock’s spine at the thought of him being noticed. “Everyone else is an idiot.”
Thoroughly versed in every aspect of this marvelous part of John’s body, Sherlock gave it one final pat, pulled John's briefs all the way down, and whispered, “Turn around.”
John stopped tickling Sherlock, tilted forward, and used both of his hands to keep Sherlock’s wrists pinned above his head. The weight of John’s body pressing down between his hips was an entirely welcome form of torture.
“Oh my God, are you serious? Right now?”
“I love your penis. I love it maybe more than you love my ass.”
John jumped a little, eyes swinging up, and up, to meet a pair of slate blue ones.
He closes his eyes, parts his bill, only enough to breathe, and sucks in lungfuls of air. Behind him, John calls his name, his tone full of concern, questioning. Still, he doesn’t turn around. He lets John approach, waits until John is tugging on his wing, trying to spin him, but still, he does not turn.
Mrs. Watson was waiting for them. The F-100 hadn’t rolled to a stop yet, and she was coming down the brick house’s porch steps, waving with both hands.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and settles his dishevelled feathers. He’s worked himself into a bit of a lather.
“Erebus. You must have considered your own battle over a long time ago, and I am sorry to see it rekindled now, especially so soon after the loss of your beloved Selvic.
“Did I ever tell you about the time we were at the quarry, and I lied about wanting to swim a bit more when you got out of the water, because I had such a huge boner for you?”
Sherlock bit his bottom lip and tried not to smile. He failed.
“Indeed, young sir. Elder Siger and I heard all the commotion, and have already been told quite a few interesting stories concerning your rescue from the
John turns over again and looks at this ridiculous man he’s chosen as his own. “You think I’m going to murder you? Maybe chop you up and throw you in the Thames, because we argued?”
They stand, side by side, and assess their destination. It has been the better part of a lunar cycle since they left Cassiopeia. Mycroft does not look at his little brother when he says, “You have done well, Sherlock. You have met, and exceeded, all of my expectations for this journey.”
He wondered why Mrs. Hudson hadn't hollered up the stairs to get his lazy ass out of bed yet.
“Okay, I get what you’re saying about not wanting to come across a certain way. You asked him to stay when he said he was going to leave, so you can’t really ask him to leave now. Leave it to me, then, and I’ll take care of it.”
John loves him, maybe even as much as he loves John.
John smiled and turned out of the driveway, and Sherlock played with the radio. “How’d it go, with your dad?”
“I do. It’s a perfect ass.”
, standing there studying the stacks of paper and binders and illustrations that he has so lovingly created and curated over their time together, and John’s mind is blank, filled with the whiteness of the ceiling above him and Sherlock’s tongue below him.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni did not sculpt French fries.”
“Here.”
“Like it? I ascended.” Sherlock wriggled his bottom into the vee of John’s hips and sighed. “I want to do it to you.”
“And how I’d wait for you after home games, wait for you to come out of the locker room, even if it took a while?”
“Windy?” James looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. “Not that I recall, but I’m not sure I would remember, to be honest. Why do you ask?”
The chicks have circled back around and are jumping on Ariki and Kahu, who are pretending to be injured and calling for mercy. “They’re all right, Sherlpeng. I’d leave our little one with them, you know?”
“I’m glad you enjoyed it. It’s a speciality in these parts.” She started to go but turned back at the door and looked at James. “I’ll let you know if I find those folders, Major.”
“It just means they like your blog and want to see it on their dash.”
“That’s actually not so bad, Sherlock.”

“But what else?”
Anahera gives Sherlock one last hug. He realizes that his heart is not pounding anymore. He cannot hear it.
“God, fuck,” John swore, reaching with one hand to turn off the floor lamp. “Off, everything off, right now.”
"Noooo. You called me...?"
John shot Sherlock a look over the top of his mother’s head, and Sherlock bit his lip to keep from laughing.
“I’ll do what I can to help.”
“If, however, you want to do a bunch of online research about the organic chemical processes inherent in decomposing fetal pig tissue, then yes, that's bad. Very bad.”
Sherlock made a half-hearted attempt to look around the flat for a copy of the BIG-SAM. He knew there was one here; Mummy had made sure of it. She and Daddy rarely stayed at Baker Street, preferring to stay at Ham Yard or the Four Seasons where they could see and be seen and spend gobs of money, but that didn’t mean that she hadn’t stocked the flat with everything she thought Sherlock might need, or
Sherlock hummed as he worked his tongue around John, feeling him fill out more, taking up more and more space in his mouth, until he had to slide off, wrap his hand around the base, and start again. He swirled his tongue around the tip, and flicked it against John’s slit, and under his crown, and then sucked him back in.
expect a trial truly absurd
Sherlock didn’t say anything, choosing to look out over the water and pretend to be interested in something he saw there, and John changed the subject and started talking about the local wildlife. Sherlock listened intently, always eager to learn something new about a place he hadn’t been before.
“Nonsense, John, I speak the truth.” Sherlock rolls up again and forgets what else he meant to say. For the first time since seeing John, he registers Erebus standing nearby. Erebus is a ghost of his physical self now, but the smile in his eyes more than makes up for his diminished stature.
“Yes.”
“Nope.” Sherlock took a swallow of his drink and smacked his lips. “Tasty.”
“Right. But what if we made a deal that instead of paying me for the acres he put that money toward your tuition? He would get the acres, I don’t need the money, and you’d get your tuition for the University of Chicago. He’d have to take out a loan to buy any significant acreage anyway, so he’d have the money, he’d just be paying tuition instead of me.”
“Right. See you later.” Sherlock raised his espresso cup in farewell and John raised his hand. His skin felt like it might vibrate off, like his heart might jackhammer right out of his chest, like his whole body might float up through the stratosphere clean into space.
Then the knocking came, and then the knocking stopped, and then it was snowing in the house. He was sitting on the couch in the family room with his head between his knees and the sound of his rasping in his ears and he was staring at the floor and it was snowing, tiny bits of white fluttering around him and landing on and near his feet, blowing with the gusts from the open door.
John nudged Sherlock’s elbow, drawing his attention back to their own table. “They’re here.”

“Interesting.”
“I'm going to take a shower and get dressed for dinner. You can sleep for another twenty minutes, if you like, then you need to get up and get ready, too. We're leaving in forty-five minutes.”
"Listen and you’ll find out," John answers.
“Kind of.”
“Okay. What is it?” Sherlock asked.
“Is that the only part you're going to refute?”
"How about TBJ?"
Sherlock turns to John, squeezes his hand, studies his face. John knows this expression, the one that means that Sherlock is sorting words, slotting them into space, figuring out how to deliver them in the best possible way.
“Is – is this – the tooth?”
“Sherlock? Supper’s ready, honey.”
Andersonville was still buzzing when they paid the fare and hopped out of the cab onto Clark. With so many shops selling everything from Turkish bongs, to refinished mid-century furniture, to vintage clothing, to Middle Eastern specialty foods, most residents could spend the entire weekend never venturing further than a few blocks of their townhouse or apartment. John and Sherlock strolled north with the foot traffic, and around them people of all ages popped in and out of stores, window shopped, and chatted with friends.
The group approaches; Siger, Olive, Mycroft, Hudi, and Erebus, each so quiet, so somber.
Sherlock leaned over and peered into the cup, his hands clasped between his knees. He looked out of place, perched there, a bit stiff, as if it was something he had seen someone do in a movie. John wondered, not for the first time, what Sherlock was like around other people. Were they put off by his ego and his slightly acerbic conversation style? John could see how it could come across as arrogant and condescending, but something instinctual told John that it was mostly just social awkwardness and a confidence in his intelligence that most other people would try and downplay. John liked the way Sherlock didn’t pretend to be something he wasn’t. He was singular. Unique. It intrigued John, made him want to know him better. Watching him sit there on the counter, obviously trying to engage with John and very obviously feeling awkward doing it, John wanted to make him feel more at ease.
John sighed. “Not really, no.”
John looked ever so pleased with himself, Sherlock thought. At that moment, he’d have agreed to eat dinner on a plastic tarp on the roof of the barn, if John wanted.
“Jesus Christ, it’s amazing we didn’t smash our heads open on that rock.”
He passed the snapshot over to Greg, then laughed out loud at the next one, which Mycroft must’ve taken seconds after the first. Instead of standing on the outcropping, though, Sherlock and John were mid-jump, only their chests, shoulders, and heads visible above the overhang. Sherlock looked like he’d seen a monster, his mouth frozen open in a shout, his free arm flailing above his head.
Later, side by side, sweaty and sated, they agreed that yes, the two of them together, in any way, shape, or form, were the most amazing thing ever.
“Mmhm. It’s tough. It protects. It’s masculine. It took strength to produce this, strength to wear it. But it has all these little delicate bits, too, little hinges and straps and decorations that look like lace. The etchings make it look delicate, like it might just crumple up if the wrong person got their hands on it. But looks are deceiving. Just like you. People think you’re one thing, when you’re really something else altogether.”
