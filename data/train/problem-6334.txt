(one issue, two entirely different methods of coping. Brave to the point of being masochistic, and severely avoidant. Polar opposites, probably both unhealthy. Damn if this didn’t define them to a tee.)
The red cape set dusts swirling anew as the Vision slowly descended from the air, feet coming into contact with the ground with a gentleness that belied the sheer power that the figure was holding in. Steve raised a finger to the patch behind his ear to deactivate the veil, met those cool, calm, distant eyes- wondering if the jaded maturity he could see in them now was his fault. Wondering if Vision still considered humanity worthwhile enough to be saved.
“You let them get away.”
Except that’s unimportant, because Steph’s eyes fleet back to rest on him and they crinkle at the edges, bright and clear. “Like Natasha.”
Steve couldn’t do this. He turned, almost unseating a kid perched on her father’s shoulders with his own broad ones. A swift apology, and he began to try and sidle his way out of the crowd-vision shorting out, breaths falling hard. The going was difficult, what with the entire throng seeming to press forward, and he couldn’t risk knocking someone to the concrete and fracturing bones with an errant push. Maybe sideways would be easier?
“..Alright.” And there was that little shift, that absence of an electronic whine that Tony was probably imagining anyway- that indicated FRIDAY was no longer actively surveilling the area.
Steve turned on his heels swiftly and made for the ceramic washbasins on the opposite wall, but Tony was too quick for him. One step in, and Tony had already cut him off, shoes sliding across the tile as smoothly as if it were a dancefloor, slick with…actually, Tony shouldn’t dedicate too much thought to what the public washroom floor was slick with. Especially with Captain America standing three inches away from him. Was aroused disgust even supposed to be a thing?
- and he looked back up at that small screen where he was seeing Tony Stark’s face for the first time since he’d brought the shield down on the reactor and seen Tony’s face snarling in rage and hurt and….and what? What?
“Tony wouldn’t.” Yeah, a drink would definitely be nice. Now it was less like churning, and more like cold lead was settling somewhere deep in his gut.
He knew that number.
and Steve had to push the bile welling up in his throat down.
“I mean.” Peter scuffed a shoe against the cemented floor-Tony didn’t know people actually did that. “I
Sam caught that pause. Stark probably loathed the life out of that pause. It was why he was turning around, striding away and ducking under the doorway towards the next room. Sam didn’t bother following, voice calling out at the disappearing armoured back, clear and unwavering. “You know it isn’t your fa-”
Oh, Natasha. “You have any wreckage for me to look at?”
he raised his chin up, something silent and resigned stealing over his expression. It’s the most terrifying expression Steve had ever seen in his life and he had no idea
Steve pulled back with a decidedly toothy grin, even as Tony rubbed at his twinging earlobe, blinking rapidly into the land of the living. “You seemed to be pretty open to it twenty minutes ago. Awake now?”
“Indifference versus disappointment.” And he turned away, breaking the connection, teeth still bared in a smile. “And I thought the latter meant you couldn’t give up on me either. Honest mistake, right?”
Steph though. Steph gets him. How could he have ever forgotten that?
“I don’t put much stock in how things used to be.” He took a few, unsteady steps backwards before growing sure of his feet, then turning to trudge painfully towards the exits. His muscles weren’t going to like him, hours come.
“If he got any more ‘famed’, he’d be on Mount Rushmore.”
“Wait.” Steve said, somehow pre-empting Tony’s overpouring of emotion at this piece of art that had just been demonstrated, and jabbed at the screen once. Words began spelling out at the bottom, accompanied by a vocal rendering.
Tony had been inching back to the suit with every sentence of that last bit, fingers already fiddling with the storage drawer of the creeper. Still one more verse of the song left to go, and he couldn’t possibly turn in to bed before that incredible guitar solo. He was in such a good mood – there was time to get in one last tinker, surely? “Sounds good to me.”
The explorer had been open for a few minutes, when he finally made himself look straight at the screen again. The arrow was still hovering over the attachment, a white mockery.
Steve blinked in startlement, bringing a hand up to shade his eyes from the bright spotlights. That…that hadn’t really happened, had it? Except it happened
Clint breathed.
–but not anymore. Maybe it was decades too late, but he had people to step in for him now, people who’d shed blood and heart and sinew so Bruce could live his life for himself. The thought made Tony’s breath stick in his throat, the warmth that had been gently stirring in his belly since the beginning of this conversation expanding into something bright and living. “Who’d have thought they’d get so protective of our gentle giant.”
, freaking hell Tony). Hijacking the hippocampus, reimagining and rewriting old memories. Traumatic memories- and Steve’s mind had flitted back to Bucky at the time and he’d smiled a little hopefully, but mostly in pride over the achievements of a friend. So generous. So thoughtful.
“Old wounds heal slow.” Tony informed her sagely. He scuffed through his own head of silver, breath falling naturally. “Just…thoughts of passage of time, y’know. Anniversaries. It’s the time of the year for that kinda thing.”
A second of silence. Then, FRIDAY’s voice filtering through quietly, “Bleeding Edge integrity at hundred percent.”
“Fuck.
(She’d gone into hiding too. And no one could take care of themselves better. But Steve missed her.)
to a body on a slab. And I can’t do that.”
The scene dissolved. Steve caught a flash, of a worktable and parts of something complexly mechanical, a ragged blanket slung over Tony’s thighs and a digital clock blinking 2 am behind his elbow, before the recording cut out.
who needed to keep a lid on the super strength, darn it.
and he can barely remember his social security number without her. And she’s aluminium because Pepper is a boss at everything including multitasking, and aluminium is not just a metal of innumerable uses: it props up industries and makes a bazillion alloys and is
Inch by inch, Tony lifted his eyes from the page and watched them blankly stare back at him from the grimy mirror.
He finally straightened up, completely, and blinked blearily at the sight around him. His workshop had no lights on, no illumination but from some of the holograms that were still powering through old calculations. No sounds, apart from the ambient beeps. Five minutes, it had taken him, to stand up. The floor was probably still littered with ceramic shards.
“If you
When Steve came back to himself, the universe was in stasis.
A blonde and a redhead, a dark-skinned man with another blonde…and there was the goateed man again-Tony, or whoever. He’d forsaken his fedora, a spiky, dark tangle of hair emerging in the bargain. His shirt was darkened with sweat, wrinkled at the back, long sleeves folded back untidily to the elbows. His sinewy arms were wrapped around a redhead-decked in a simplistic powder blue tea dress, buttons running up the front. And Steve might have stopped there, moved his eyes away for the final time…except at that choice moment, the redhead raised a prim hand and smacked the man upside the head.
“I can recognise a Wakandan aircraft when I see one, how much of an imbecile do you think I am.” Stark dropped the words, icy ill-hewn things, fast and cold and uninhibited.
The day he first thought of the word, he checked on the status of the tracking chip T’Challa had slipped into the phone Steve had sent to Tony. He hadn’t entirely approved of it- it was a massive invasion of privacy, even more so considering the recent turn of events. But the same sanctimonious self that had written out that letter, convinced himself that Tony was proud (which was true) and wouldn’t call for help even if he needed it (which was also true), and that Steve had to have some, however miniscule a chance of tracking Tony down against his wishes if that was what was needed (which was one of the biggest fucking lies and presumptions that Steve had ever had the audacity to make).
“This isn’t how it works, you know.” Tony drags the words out, every one screaming and thrashing in reluctance all the way. “People. People pick up pens. Bend over and pick up pens, I mean. And wrap their lips insinuatingly around popsicles and slurp on milkshakes an-wait, those were supposed to be first date milkshakes, weren’t they? The day of the Doombots?”
“That tendency gets problematic, on opposing sides.” Tony murmured, eyes calm and knowing. “But we’re on the same team. A team of superheroes. And we kicked ass today.”
“Fuck.” Tony whispered, and slid weakly on to the chair- except he didn’t stop there, and slid down the seat to hit the floor, tailbone hitting the cement. He twisted his head to throw a glance over and above his shoulder, no doubt to where the BARF was still powered up. Frustrated, as if wondering if he had enough strength to make another go at this latest iteration that had resulted in his workshop being reduced to a destroyed dumpster.
It was almost easy to miss, in the recorded echoes of a fight that he’d never forget and the slurry of memories whirling through his head, punctured by shards of pain. But it registered in his mind- he heard the whirr and moved his gaze from his best friend’s face to Iron Man’s visage. The two small, rectangular flaps on his shoulders had withdrawn, risen. The strategist in Steve, the Captain America part of him that had fought alongside Iron Man for years- dimly registered that those compartments stored the mini-missiles that Iron Man was equipped with. He’d used them to great efficiency in the past- usually against Chitauri or Ultron bots or other opponents that couldn’t merely be incapacitated.
“There a reason you showed me the non-official data?” Mark LV? No, way too bulky. He’d need something sturdy
had finally been proved- but he was strangely devoid of anything, but a lingering ache in his bones and the lead in his gut. “Vision, does Tony kno-“
“We can prepare,” Steve fists his hands by his sides, so as to not reach for Tony’s trembling ones on the kitchen countertop. Everything around them is night and still, but for the flickering of the bulb overhead. “We’ll be ready for them when they’re here.”
Natasha looked at him for several seconds, unblinking. Then, like releasing a dead weight on Clint’s twisting heart-a small burst of air puffed past her lips, bitter-fond.
Then of course, like something inevitable, Natasha’s low soprano took over his hearing again- describing how denial was a delicate, fragile construct; how essential it was for mental health, how sometimes damaging, how almost every man who’d committed a cruelty sought its help to do what he had done- how maintaining it required careful, almost deliberate lack of thought, an unnatural focus on some things and disregard of others. How when it started crumbling, it started all at once and it was like looking at the real world again after staring for ages through a kaleidoscope, though some still clung to it, smiling through their downfall- so much so that they didn’t even feel the impact as they hit the ground. And then it broke, all of a sudden, as the dust began to settle and the quiet began.
Steve reached out and swiped it, his own fingers brushing ephemerally over Tony’s. They were warm. Damp.
It wasn’t like it didn’t hurt, anymore. Even when slates were wiped clean, their graphite-black newness stayed out of reach – maybe the visible marks had been scrubbed away, but the surface would always remain a little worn, a little grey, a little tarnished. Memories lingered longer than chalk, and Tony had never quite learned how to wash their taint away.
aware you’re saying that to a self-proclaimed genius. Hell, weren’t you the target of that particularly sassy proclamation?”
And that was it, the construct collapsed- and he thought of Sam, ashamed and regretful, who he
to go, did he? It wasn’t a binding contract, he could just take the pass and…and not go, just raise his hand, take the scrap of paper from Tony’s warm grasp…and Sam said talk to people your age but Tony was clearly older than him, and-
Super soldier fucking memory indeed.
Steve straightened, closing off the tap, leaving white flecks on the smooth steel. Reached over to tug at the roll of toilet paper on the counter, tearing off a scrap smoothly along the serrated edges. “We’re both white.”
The Vision’s gaze intensified, like being pinned under a coring beam of light that illuminated all the shadows in one’s soul; and a frail, blasphemous thought flitted by Steve’s mind- if this was what it would be like to die and receive judgement. Strange that an android, beyond definitions of living or dead, could pass muster as a creature of heaven.
The church looked like a blast zone. It appeared to be the only part of the city untouched by repairing hands, stained by the lingering, contaminating presence of Ultron- but little flags had started coming up around the entryway steps too, areas beginning to be marked off by tape- as if determined not to leave any part of the land unhealed.
Tony sighed.
“It shouldn’t be this hot to see Captain America all covered in blood.” His repulsors hum beneath his feet as he barely skims the ground. Rogers turns her head, raising her face to see him, a little blonde curl barely restrained by the cowl slipping out to cradle her ear caked in drying blood and-
But he wasn’t, was he. Not anymore.
Tony stepped forward, shoulders pulling back, because it was impossible not to. “Then maybe you too need to remember that I’m the face of this entire grand operation to legitimise powers. Poster boy for superhero obedience. I leave, and this whole thing falls flat on its face.”
Repulsors cutting out, he hit the fake grass with a particularly defeated thump. Steve Rogers turned his head at the sound.
“-ank Benedetto at the mike, sing along if you know the words-”
“I wouldn’t go about sharing the gratitude just yet.” Tony’s lip curled- and that, was that, really.
But then the record would start again- Clint’s blazing eyes, Sam’s twisted smile, Vision’s emotionless words, Tony cutting a swathe through packs of reporters or slipping through crowds of strangers, always alone (
(Captain America fighting villains in shorts, and he’s too distracted by the blood of her victims running down her strong jaw. He’s never really been into kink shaming himself inside his own head-but
“No need Fry. ‘Sides, sleeping pills are for the strong.” All those pesky people with non-addictive personalities.
“That letter I sent you,” He began again- because it was impossible to stop, once he had started, just as impossible as it had been to start without a push. “So much of it were lies. I have nothing to justify them, except to say that I thought they had been truths, at the time. I had-“ And it was difficult to breathe here, difficult to search for words in their utter, utter inadequacy- “I was blind, and I’d take back a lot of-“
He ascended, cutting faster and faster through the air till he was level with the tallest building in the skyline. Manhattan was a sea of glass around him and concrete below, Tony hovering in place for one last look. Steve had reduced to a tiny figure in the middle of a street filled with tiny figures; impossible to tell apart, except how all the other ones were moving and this one stayed still.
Steve blinked. His t-shirt was a couple of shades lighter than his eyes; unlike the shirt he was wearing on the night ULTRON went berserk, which matched those deep blues perfectly. It was the last time he’d seen Steve in civilian clothing… no, the time at the farm.
Peter stared at him flatly. “You did.”
At the corner of his vision, he could see Rhodey’s shoulders fall. Just a little, air leaving his chest as though punctured out.
(Stranger still. It didn’t sound nearly as taunting as it did in his memories. It didn’t sound taunting at all.)
displayed by these groups…thinking they know better than the people of the world how exactly they need to be saved.”
“I’m trying!” Peter yelled back, twisting his head around; then erupting into a coughing fit from the little clouds of dust that exercise elicited.
“Alright, your turn.”
Another pause. This time longer, more weighted. Then, quieter than anything else. “Just hang on.”
Tony breathed, slow and controlled. None of those words were allowed. None. He didn’t have to give away a single thing he didn’t have to–
Steve’s eyes grew unreadable. “I know that.”
“Remember to turn the flash off, the museum exhibits don’t like that. Or the guards.” Sam reminded him, oh-so-helpfully. “Got told off for it in front of a bunch of school kids once, it was pretty humiliating.”
“I.” He cleared his throat. God, what had he even been thinking. FRIDAY was amazing, and nothing like Ultron. Even though his ‘worrying’ behaviour over the last weeks had nothing to do with this pattern of thought.
(time was a luxury they never had, the conference room, the airport, the bunker– )
One single swipe of his thumb, was all it would take- yet Steve found himself curiously frozen- mouth dry, eyes unblinking. After that brief stutter, his heart had taken to an outright rampage in his chest, thundering out a rhythm that felt too frantic for his ribcage to hold. All of the voices and thoughts from over the past hour seemed to merge into one incomprehensible mess and
Not even a half-hearted shrug this time, just matter of fact words. “You wouldn’t have done anything differently.”
Steve was moving – achingly, achingly slow, mincing steps pushing through the sludge that caked his feet. The pungent scent of wet leather suffused the shelter, acrid even through the suit’s filters, damp-thick in Tony’s nostrils. He wanted to sneeze. He wanted to stop breathing.
by a game hatched by some Camden Town kid in his attic. A game evidently called ‘a day in the life of sliced bread’.
One inhale; and his hands turned the phone over, dropping it face down on the pillow.
“What’re you thinking of?” She asks, and it’s difficult to find words, but he’ll try.
“Brilliant, of course you did.” Tony spun around on his heels, ignoring the flinch and subsequent wobble the server and his tray executed. The fajita table was on the far end of the hall, and it took fifteen whole minutes of ducking and weaving (okay fine, the crowds parted before him a la Moses-and-the-Red-Sea, but it still took fifteen darn minutes) to find the man of the hour and creep up behind him. Tony crossed his arms, realised it rendered him incapable of actually drawing said man’s attention, uncrossed them again and tapped the guy on his shoulder, if a bit imperiously.
“That video game you and Rhodey play, when he visits.
, and I trusted you’d keep your distance as I’d asked, and I thought-“
you think-” Fuck,
“I think Lord Byron would’ve resented that.” Tony can hear the grin in his voice, can feel it stretching across his face.
A bright gleam at the periphery of Steve’s vision- he raised his chin up, shielding his eyes with a hand, expecting the rising sun to have finally started breaking through the clouds. But the golden light was already trickling through, running down the church walls in rivulets, illuminating clouds of dust motes. The gleam of light, almost like a lens flare, had come from something much closer to the earth; the sun shining off an Infinity Gem.
But the words remain dammed up behind his lips, refusing to be spoken, because Maria and Howard taught him too well and he’s nothing special.
Memory-Steve’s face wiped itself of all expression, the shield rose. The setting Siberian sun flashed off it in a blinding glare as it fell in an arc- but Steve’s attention was caught by red, gauntleted fingers, rising up involuntarily to protect the face even though the owner had so clearly wanted this outcome. Goaded his way into it.
The little twist of his lips was invisible in the dark.
Steve and Tony’s story began after they fell in love, and this is about how they fell in everything else.
“Vibranium,” she whispers against his lips. Before he can ask for an explanation, Steph releases a slight huff of amusement, brushing amazingly past his skin. “That thing you do, you know? For Natasha and Bruce and everyone else…you never mentioned for yourself, and I thought vibranium, because you build things and protect me and it shines in your chest like..”
Back in the day. Back home. Steve’s throat was beginning to feel desert-like, harsh and prickly.
Fuck. Was that
Steve couldn’t stop thinking about the day he betrayed Tony Stark.
Well, Steve wasn’t in a warzone now, for all that his pain-ridden eyes seemed to forget that at times. So Tony finally took a physical step back, mouth curling up into that languid smirk it had apparently deserted some time during the course of this conversation. “Not that it would make any difference to our teammates. You know, what with us being in the men’s for over fifteen minutes now.”
“So are you an-“
Well, that checked off ‘hurting the strongest person he knew’ from his bucket list. What else could he knock off today?
Tony stared on. It was like watching a picture fading back to greyscale. It was dangerously like déjà vu. How did he ever used to believe that
“Talk.” And it was like the façade was crumbling, the granite that made up those strong lines, that straight nose, that inexorable jaw; wavering and disintegrating before his eyes. “When you went on about blueberries and Walt Whitman, robots and shields, heroes and responsibility. I wanted to talk from the very beginning, till the very end – and the more I wanted, the more I couldn’t, even when I should have. And now there are…there are…”
Tony’s eyes widened for a split second before narrowing down to almost slits. “Fuck no.”
And then, of a sudden, Tony felt abruptly, incredibly embarrassed- a man in his late forties standing outside a teenager’s door, seeking…..what? Comfort? Solace?
“I’m…not very good with stuff online.”
Clint was…..scraping something off his arrows. The natural assumption would be that he was sharpening them- except his arrows were pre-customised and pre-designed and all other sorts of pre’s, with poison caps and electricity and heaven knows what else at the pointier end…..so sharpening them was kind of impossible and useless.
“Ouch.” Natasha dropped her antique little stack of papers, smirk broadening. “I thought we’d decided not to discuss that little fiasco again.”
Tony’s jaw tightened, his mouth thinning out. “Did you find your miraculous invention of yore?”
“Yeah. 22
Tony blinked.
Even quieter. “Bye Sam.”
The call terminated.
The rain had gotten into his eyes. Tony could feel it – creeping hot and stinging past his lids, clotting his lashes and wrenching loose: a funerary crawl over the aged landscape of his cheeks. Like every trail carved new lines, new scars and canyons for a face ravaged by the decades. The rain had gotten into his eyes, even though he stood motionless under dank heather, even as he blinked – shielded, by a hero’s helmet.
the point of all these weeks of self-recrimination and remorse and chest-burning guilt, if he and Tony kept circling around and getting stuck on opposite sides of the
Tony says nothing. It hurts, the pulling together and healing of old wounds, all in a day. But Steph has been working at it for ages, hasn’t she. Patience and diligence, stitching each broken bit of skin and sinew, laying balm with cool hands. She’s stroking his face now, the climb of his cheekbone and the bridge of his nose, and he presses into it and places a kiss into her palm, because he can’t say anything.
“When did it happen.” Steve’s voice broke through half way. It was difficult to keep his heart in check-pounding along like hammer against anvil, coupled with the ocean’s deep roar in the distance. Everything was unmoored. The cracks had gone too deep. “This link-between knowing, and trusting. Aren’t we supposed to have faith in each other? In humanity?”
Of course, all of the above were hard won victories because more often than not, John Oliver the Second delighted in narrating their horrific deaths in that smarmy voice: from the usual options like becoming literal toast, ranging to the more obscure, like getting quashed by a bowling ball for being an uppity piece of bread. And of course, that time they had an existential crisis so severe that they ate themselves, thereby breaking physics and creating a singularity and ending the universe as they knew it.
“Tony, I- I knew it, I knew you would-” Memory-Steve sounded disbelieving, amazed. Steve wanted to punch him in the face.
Steve’s brows pulled together. “Maybe I should take point on this then.”
He could still hear T’Challa speaking though, over the blood pounding in his ears. “Of course, that is idealistic drivel that finds little ground in the real world. It didn’t help. Nothing helped. So the only thing I can say…is this.”
Infantry Regiment, born March the tenth, nineteen seventeen, Sergeant, war hero, best friend of Steve Rogers- brainwashed, Winter Soldier, Fist of Hydra, assassin, destroyer of regimes, best friend of Captain America, murderer of Howard and Maria Stark-
“Perfect.” Tony could hear himself say. His knees shook slightly when he hoisted himself up from his chair. One brisk clap of the hands, to really jolt him out. “Alright Fry, enough of the mope-reminiscing. Show her to me.”
Sam wondered how Steve felt about that.
Steve lounged on the bed, naked belly rubbing against the sheets – Tony glowered at him for good measure. “How exactly did you come across it?”
“Gather ye rosebuds, i-it’s a…” Damn, he was stammering, this was
“Mr. Stark, are you okay in there?” Peter’s voice rang through the flimsy door, half ‘am I crossing a line’, half ‘I really hope Tony Stark doesn’t die in my bathroom’. And a decent amount of concern in there too. God. He was such a good kid.
That was the mind of a spy all over, though. You’re only equal to the information you hold.
betrayed if he was praying for strength right now, the blaspheming bastard. “Because the canards and the ailerons perform the same function together, as you very well know–
And that’s all this is. Honest, all-too-natural appreciation of the peak of human perfection. Nothing more, nothing less.
“And while we’re on a streak-” The words exited almost in a garble, and Sam twisted his head back, to where Stark was staring fixedly at some point in the dark, or maybe just the entirety of it. But he raised his head, and his gaze found its mark. “Tell Barton to go back home.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony grinned, sharp and victorious. Steve didn’t look like he was too far behind, for all of his wholesome dimples. Ha, they could totally do this.
The light seeping through the windows caught in his eyes, near-blinding. Steve raised a hand to shield them – was the sun setting? “Must’ve been hard for you to go through that all alone, after the war. Don’t know how you managed it.”
(Agh, the voice shitted him the most. Tony missed that reedy, high-pitched wonder of a larynx, dammit.)
. He thinks he asks for a kiss, but they all just go for shawarma instead. It isn’t half bad.
“The recordings you’ve been sending me…I.” Steve stopped- suddenly, abruptly tired. Or maybe this had been creeping on him for a while. The sunlight was starting to hurt his eyes. “I thought you were Tony’s friend.”
The recordings didn’t come every night.
“Never much liked Shakespeare anyway.” Steph attempts a smile. It looks horrible. It breaks him.
“No. I mean, yes.” His words were colliding with each other, rapid and clumsy. Steve could feel a flush begin to build at the base of his neck, creeping past his jaw. “I-I get it.”
“There have been contenders.” Ross inclined his head. “In particular, Norman Osborn has offered up his services.”
Tony finally,
Tony closes his mouth. He blinks. Okay.
…so yeah. Flying them over. Close physical contact. Probably not a good idea.
“Right.”
Romanov was dancing with Bruce now, torsos pressed close, her chin tucked over his shoulder-swaying slow and tired. Barton and Hill were straight-backed still, his arm bent perfectly and pressed to her shoulder blade-and attempting to tickle her, if her impassive, unimpressed expression was any clue. Parker and MJ were obscured in the corner, feet wobbly and barely standing. Danvers and Rhodes had their foreheads pressed together, looking down at their moving feet.
Enjoy!
“And feed them. Don’t forget the feeding.” Something in Tony’s shoulders was beginning to unravel, something that had been coiled tight ever since a fateful Helicarrier conversation, when he’d been dismissed as a knock-off hero. Had it really been so simple, all this while? Did he really have to do nothing more than
“I know.” Nothing hoarse about that tone. Just quiet – quiet enough that Tony could barely see Steve’s lips move. His eyes looked pallid in this lighting, washed out against this world of green and brown and grey.
“Checking.” FRIDAY said. “Initial hit – a tweet at 2:14 pm, about a mile out from the café. @Hanessy34 says:
The screen panned over the smooth, polished exteriors of the Avengers facility- Tony’s mind whirred. Not many people had access to his data framework…okay, fine. Not many people
But more than that, he’d wish to be down-on-his-luck because that’s how his heroes always began. They struggled and strived, against evil and the system. No one found wealth very challenging. The rich were never particularly heroic.
“Yes yes, she’s beauty and grace and makes you pop duty-boners,” Tony waved his hand distractedly, “actually wait, coming back to the boners – please tell me you do it in the uniforms.”
brains- what a twat indeed.
It’s been twenty-three days since Steve told him about December 16, 1991. New traumas evoking older nightmares.
An exhale. He’d seen that stillness in her posture before, something almost studied about its quality. “You shouldn’t have done anything at all.”
He didn’t have much choice now. Satellites had detected the entry of a foreign object into the Earth’s atmosphere eight hours ago, and it took five of those goddamn hours before fuzzy pictures emerged – oblong, disk like structures hovering over a rice field in Vietnam. They disappeared twenty minutes later, but the damage was already done: a panicking government reluctant to deploy an airforce that still included craft from the Cold War era, unsurprisingly outweighing the terror of the Avengers swooping in and reducing everything to flame and rubble. Hell, at least the Avengers were still human. Sort of.
Steve’s head was bent, the fading light from War Machine’s repulsors catching on the bare skin of that chin. Back curled in, hands hanging uselessly by his side. Cerulean eyes lifted to meet Sam’s, dark and shuttered-and Sam could feel the pain lance through his own chest, quiet and hopeless.
“Hold on for a second.” Share, share, share…okay, this he had actually done before. Share to Sam Wilson…done. Hell yes.
His throat was dry. Nothing came.
Quiet.
at him. Her eyes are fixed at a spot that is not quite the screen, not really the floor. Her jaw is twitching, there’s a red sheen to her cheeks that seems to be born of something more than a work out, the words falling out of her mouth slow and clearly pronounced, almost like she’s working really hard to keep it that way and not spit it all out in a hurried garble.
It’s for Cooper, Steve thinks; it’s dumb, I couldn’t help myself, you haven’t told us and I’m so sorry–
There were rustling sounds beside him, as Tom pushed himself to his feet too, palms smacking against each other to brush the sand away. He was still smiling. “Well, you haven’t attempted an escape plan yet. You listened to everything I had to say, and answered me honestly. Maybe even more so than anyone else you’ve talked to, of late.” He sounded certain. Steve used to know what that certainty felt like, once upon a time.
And the quiet returned, vicious and silent and ever-encompassing, punctuated by the Black Panther’s cool, detached gaze. There was no judgement, only something curiously akin to pity. No, kinder. Sympathy, maybe. Like a look Steve might give a soldier who was stuck in the very hurdles Steve had long past.
“I guessed, what with the delightful references to pre-existing games of our time in-taunt. You really should pay more attention to me.” Steve’s response to that was to nearly shove the iPhone up Tony’s nostril, which…no. All body cavity invasions were to be conducted by Stark products only. So he backed up an inch, and looked. Blank turquoise screen, underset by the same bright, peppy music. Lovely.
, something that had flown out and lodged right under Tony’s elbow, blood creeping past his cheek and scrapes all down his arms – muscles screaming as he raised himself off the ground and flopped onto his ass.
“Come in!” Peter squeaked, backing up rapidly away from the door as if Tony was a wight that would vanish at the slightest delay or provocation- except his ankle clearly wouldn’t stand for it. Balance was lost, and his arms flailed and pinwheeled around as his scrawny body tipped back, landing with an ‘oof!’- and Tony found himself staring down at a seventeen year old sitting on his butt in the foyer of his apartment, gawking right back at him
Steve fell into step beside him, matching every length of Tony’s stride. The breeze caught stray, sweat-sodden strands of his hair, made them dance about his forehead in entrancing motions. Caught the contortions of his voice too, brought the quietly enunciated words over to Tony’s ears. “Eye of Agamotto? Or Mind Stone?”
And Tony…
And then, like it had been perfectly choreographed though Tony couldn’t have dreamt up this kind of symmetry – there was movement by the door. Tony’s eyes flitted over for a single instant, enough to catch the tall figure that had just ducked in; candelabra light gleaming off his favourite blue shirt and grey-blonde hair.
“Wanda needed my-”
The thought flashed past his mind, quick and involuntary, and it took a couple of delayed seconds for Steve to realise he’d voiced it out loud. Shit, he needed the serum to start working faster; he needed a clear head
The cursor hovered motionlessly for a while- a strange blend of curiosity, grief and loneliness staying the finger. A quick flashback of the last recording proved to be more than enough incentive- Tony Stark standing at his table for an entire night, head bowed, trying to get himself to
A strange prickling at the back of his neck interrupts his merry jumble of thoughts. Tony turns halfway and sees Steph standing there, wet towel slung around a sweaty neck, staring at the TV and looking thunderous. He’s about to interrupt with a quip on how he really hasn’t been processing the bullshit for the last ten minutes and she shouldn’t either because neither of them are trash compactors; which would have been a delightful segue way to Star Wars except Steph opens her mouth and-
This, though. This was quiet…barely whispering at the nerve endings of his eardrums, a whoosh that was there and gone. But at the same time it was low-a baritone that rumbled up from the depths of the earth, like having the faintest glimpse of something whose scope was beyond comprehension. A straining sound in the distance, deceptively quiet, layered with deeper things. The faintest threat on the horizon.
“Astute observation, FRIDAY.” Tony flipped the omelette, then squinted at it from one side. Then the other. Yellow-brown. That….was probably good.
He was tired. Sleep would be nice, but the greyish white ground looked so uninviting. But all would be fine. Someone was coming for him. No more fighting, screaming, punching….strangling. He could sleep. All would be fine.
“Not about this.” She said it like it deserved no argument.
Being on the run wasn’t nearly as exciting as the pictures made it out to be.
Today, though. Steve Rogers stood for a full fifteen minutes, watching the back of his ex-friend’s head, wondering if he’d ever be able to move his legs.
to whirl around and educate him on the very grave insult he’s offering all robots by comparing them to these piles of trash. When he turns again, Rogers is but a presence in the wind, having ran ahead to dispatch of some more evil bones.
No, no, no. Steve’s heartbeat sped up triple fold, clammy hands sticking to the rope he’d still been clinging on to all this time. He couldn’t, he
He didn’t have to hide anything. This man knew.
He also realises he’s kinda hanging limply in the air, carcasses of automatons he doesn’t remember shooting littered all around him.
He kept hearing footsteps though. Echoing in the distance, against the cold concrete floor where his forehead rested.
Open the camera up again. Done. Tap at the lightning. No helpful little note appeared, telling him if he’d mucked up something indelibly; just a little white line diagonally slashing through the lightning. Fine.
It was…..it was a strong word. Betrayal. Not one that he’d ever have imagined applying to himself. There weren’t many things in life he was proud of- but his moral compass had always held him in good stead. Considering he hadn’t really changed his mind on the things that had driven him to make a stand in the first place- the word couldn’t quite fit. Not really.
Tony was at the same workshop bench as last time, the real, present time Tony. The one with the unhealthily dark skin under his eyes, the tremors in his hands, the one who somehow looked more ragged and run-down than the Tony Stark recoiling from blows in battle. Coffee mugs scattered around a table so piled up with bits and pieces of machinery that the metal top was barely visible, holograms flickering weakly in the background, the blanket from the night before pooled on the floor. It looked like he hadn’t moved since then.
He opened his eyes, and it was like the screen had freeze-framed: his onscreen self a meter too far and absolutely wiped of sane expression, Iron Man standing dispassionately over Bucky’s dead body, stray hair strands soaking in the blood.
Right. Right. So this is what they’re doing. Skipping the writing on paper, saving the environment, going straight to the oration. Nice. This is a thing. This is going to be a thing, a significantly harder thing, considering the whole ‘failed high school English’ detail, but Tony will manage, Tony will probably design an app or something, JARVIS’ right brain is a little underdeveloped anyway…
Behind, the Ferrari crashed back to the concrete as if tossed aside, windows shattering with the impact and raining glass; a death-screech of sound that would never make it out of here.
No. No it wasn’t. Because he wasn’t just a self-sacrificing moron judging the healthiness of Steve’s choices; he was selfish enough not to fuck up the first real progress he’d made with Steve by fucking Steve. Oh sure, sex wasn’t the devil. Sex was a good way to establish a line of communications, oftentimes. It was just that with Tony, that also tended to be the end of the road.
“So I’m asking you.” Tom didn’t avert his gaze, not for a second. “Are you sure about that?”
“What name did you go by?” His feet settled on the floor, toe to heel, his breaths falling a bit more slowly. “Regina Phalange?”
“But they are
was…he didn’t know what it was. Malicious. Cruel, threatening, mocking the crudely put together but still sincerely meant apology that Steve had sent. Steve wasn’t…he wasn’t naïve, he didn’t think that weeks and months would pass, and Tony would suddenly become alright with the idea of the Winter Soldier slaughtering his parents, the relationship between Howard and his wife and their son was too complex for that. But….when the initial flush of emotion had passed…Steve had hoped that a reasonable man would be able to see past revenge and-
“So I turned to him and said, ‘well, I don’t know about love. But all that other stuff you mentioned sounds pretty fantastic’.” Peter was leaning into MJ’s side now, with all the light of the world in his eyes, while she gave his elbow an affectionate squeeze – Tony blinked rapidly, eyes burning with a curiously sweet sting. “And he goggles at me and goes, ‘you’re the only person I’ve asked who thinks I’m not crazy.’ Of course, cut to ten years and now, we’re gathered here commemorating the occasion solid proof was
“You’re twenty-four.” Sam attested easily, “I could give you my mum’s fridge. Pretty sure it’s from the time of her marriage, the miserly coot.”
And she could take one too. “Not you though. Never you.”
Walls, bars, cells. Red sparks of magic snuffing out into nothingness. “That’s an oversimplification.”
“In the light of the Accords being ratified,” And hell was Tony done to death with bureaucratic and legalese speak over the past few months, “we’re thinking this is the perfect time to re-legitimise it again.”
‘Heading off’ was probably not a thing people said in the forties. Did Steve learn modern turns of phrase online? Maybe from a blog titled ‘2010s slang’, with sad looking html and pictures that didn’t sit right in their divs.
Not the long, straightened sheet of locks he’d gotten used to during D.C.; not even the braid she’d started putting her hair in in the past five years when her roots started growing out. No, Natasha’s hair was scarlet, violently red – and done in the short bob he’d grown to know when they’d first met, and when they trained the Avengers at the compound together.
“You already know why.” Did he? The nose of the
And violent.”
A second more, to let himself hurt- and then Tony pulled that unnatural smile right back where it belonged. “New doodads.”
Tony didn’t stand around to hear the end of that sentence, barely looking sideways at Peter as he ducked out of the doorway. It was less of a hall and more of a narrow corridor, crowded walls and a grey cement floor echoing hollowly under his feet as he crossed its length in three strides and put a hand out to tug open the door at the end. It resisted him, ill-fitted in its frame and refusing to give way, and Tony could distantly feel a growing pressure in his jaw, teeth pressing hard enough to splinter. The doorknob slid in and out of his clammy grasp; and Tony had to stop himself from biting his tongue through in a suffocating surge of emotion too sharp to be frustration.
“Tell me if anything changes.” Tony moved through the corridors till he emerged in the communal kitchen- shining and spotless. There was a jar of paprika slightly skewed from its position in one of the cabinets, but that was easy enough to ignore. There was a jacket slung over one of the steel chairs- one of his own. Pulling it over bare skin, Tony picked up one of the tablets on the glass centre-table and pulled up his account- dark eyes skimming over screens as fast as his finger could pull them up. “Don’t I have about two hundred documents or so to look through and sign for SI?”
“However, I must dissuade you from coming here again.” T’Challa continued and Steve blinked- for all of that commanding presence, his thought had still drifted away somehow- and blinked again, for the man was sounding impeccably serious. Grim, almost. “You can be tracked here. For all that Wakanda can assert its own sovereignty, I will still be hard-pressed to deny the world powers should they become suspicious and start sniffing around. Bombing charges dropped or not, your friend is still the Winter Soldier.”
“Because I like having the last word.” Tony interrupted unceremoniously. “Winning.”
“No, I couldn’t have.” Peter’s lip quirked up, just a little. His gaze was clear and constant. “I was stronger than half the guys at that airport terminal, and the other half were on our side.”
Minutes passed by, his breath puffing out steadily in the quiet. An interminable amount of time later, there was a heavier breath approximating a sigh- and he moved his head to dig his chin into the pillow, strands of hair slipping over his forehead and brushing over the tip of his nose. Another minute.
Tony pulls back, smiles softly.
Wind whipped against the bridge of his nose as he emerged on the pad, the hulking lines of the Mark XLV glowing red under the afternoon sun.
The former thought was more stupid, perhaps. But at least it wasn’t half as naïve as the latter.
The man behind the weapon, Tony thought- the man behind the cybernetic arm: James Buchanan Barnes, 107
“All these years, Tony. The fights, with or against each other. We’ve talked and laughed and argued and cried and…” There, at that spot between his shoulder blades – Tony could feel Steve’s breath on his skin. Warm and just the littlest bit shaky. “Has any of it, ever, felt like waiting?”
They inched through, mission by mission, chapter by chapter-reports and assassinations, blood and words. They would only complete the book two years later: Clint bleeding out in Belmopan, Natasha reading to pass the time until help came. Her reading was as steady as ever, even as he cradled his head on her folded legs and stared upside down, watching her chin move senselessly for hours altogether. He didn’t register when foreign hands pulled him away, damp hair on the back of his skull leaving the warm patch on her skin. Didn’t recall the sheer agony of being pulled out on the stretcher, dosed to the gills while the jet buzzed under him, only to be cut open even wider than he was and sewn back shut hours later.
Tony dimly registers the TV still playing on in the background. Where was he? Right, right. An app. That suggests suitable love poetry according to your needs…
the description read,
Behind her glossy locks, Steve could see the diner fracturing – jagged shards of light cleaving through the vinyl booths, checkered floor, white tiling on the counters. His breath was shaking along with it, sucked clean out of his chest like an asthma attack of old, fingers digging into the table– “I never stopped loving you.”
“But six hours is healthy. Isn’t six hours healthy, FRIDAY?” His head left the pillow, and his feet swung to the side, bare heels settling over warmed floors. They arched and flexed, then flattened completely as he pulled himself up to his feet, moving automatically to the expansive windows. “I haven’t seen 5 am on the right side since……ever, really.”
. Pearls of wisdom, truly. Handwritten too; very personal, nice touch.”
The red-and-gold gleamed dully in the gloam, like the last remnants of a sunset that had long disappeared into the indigo sky. Next to it, the burnished grey of gun-metal was barely visible.
Tom walked around to the other side of the bed, padding steps soft despite his large frame. Steve sucked in a breath, feeling the muscles in his arm tense, his jaw grit tight. His fingertips dug into the pallet-an exhale, and a superhuman heave, and the dead weight of his legs slid across and landed on the ground. His left ankle almost gave way-he winced, incisor sinking into his bottom lip, and pushed through.
A minute click. Tony felt something wet creep out of the shadow of his eyelids.
I have ever come across.”
Steve raised his eyes, slowly, and met a matching tiredness in Vision’s own gaze. “Mr Stark has gotten so used to fixing his own mistakes that he doesn’t know how to fix those made by others.”
Damn, he was digressing all over the place. Unable to keep a straight tack. Maybe that was what happened when there was nothing to do. No clear, defined end goal in sight. Nothing to drive towards. Nothing to really keep his mind occupied. His mind just- digressed; darted down dangerous roads that there was no point contemplating, brooding and churning and tossing in memories and thinking about what-ifs and making the lead in his gut feel…permanent, somehow. For all that the air around him was mostly silent for the past weeks, his head was alive with sound: except instead of the Commandoes’ raucous voices, Bucky’s snicker, Peggy’s smooth register- he could hear Bruce’s mumbles, the foreign, erudite swirl to Thor’s words when he got a little cocky, Natasha and Clint conversing in a code known only to them that seemed entirely comprised of names of cities; Tony mocking him gleefully over pop-culture.
“Genealogically, that’s an impossibility.” Ooh, big word – though there was a tiny bean-scented burp between syllables three and four. Peter cleared his throat, faintly pink.
“Captain.” Vision said, suddenly so much like JARVIS that Steve couldn’t understand how Tony bore it at all.
Tony breathed.
He would have answered yes. His first impulse was probably always a yes. Pepper was a fixture of his life. This was a chance to get their friendship back on track- possibly even get back on the way of rekindling things. More Pepper was always good.
Whoopsie-do, here came the inappropriately-timed laughter. “What, you think I left the team ‘cause I didn’t
“I know of them.” Tom said, and opened his eyes. His loose shirt was flapping in the wind. “So I suppose the answer to your question is that yes, I like them very much. I don’t know if I trust them.”
but Steve’s brows furrowed inwards, lips grimacing slightly. “Feels weird to just strap it on my back and get on the subway with my shopping.”
And it was so easy to pick up where he’d left off
(For someone who derides poetry as much as he does, these thoughts might come off as hypocritical. No, not really. He’s a scientist, it comes as second nature for him to break things down into their constituent elements.)
The two parted: the redhead curtsied sarcastically, Tony swept into an exaggerated bow. The group next to Steve giggled again; his own mouth was curving upwards, outside his conscious control.
“Happy Sputnik Day!” Tony choruses, Thor’s deep base rumbling alongside his. Bruce is in the attached kitchenette, peering at jar labels in the shelf; Clint and Natasha playing
Fully automated.
And Steve….he had a tic. He knew about it. He could never stand to be quiet when someone was in his face, issuing challenges. Even when he should have. Maybe that was one of the reasons why he and Tony couldn’t help but rub each other the wrong way, sometimes. Tony Stark could never stop challenging people, and Steve Rogers could never stop accepting every single one that came his way.
“I love you Tony!” Someone screamed from the crowd, and the man paused. Cocked a hip, tipped the wide brimmed felt hat perched jauntily on his head. Brought two fingers to his lips, blew a kiss out in the direction of the voice. It was irking, was what it was, irking and
He didn’t recognise his voice, hoarse yet somehow unfeeling. “Up to par, FRIDAY.”
The body of lead that had been sinking in his gut for the past…..days? Weeks? – sagged several inches further. When had it gotten so cold in here?
Steve would have protested against the phrasing of that- he hadn’t been the only one doing the hitting- but the basic principle still stood true, and he still flinched. “I know- but that’s why I
kind of poem – thanks very muchly for the snark, it was totally called for.”
“Yes.” T’Challa said, without backtracking or dithering. Fuck, Tony wished all politicians could be like this. “But not all of them possess the skill to actually use and mould the vibranium into something dangerous.”
But then Bucky was releasing a desperate snarl and pinning Iron Man against the stone wall, fingers straining to pull out the reactor- and Steve leaned forward in spite of himself, knuckles whitened, a phantom sense of panic and worry and pain and displaced warmth swimming in his chest. God,
Clint waited.
? Walking shoulder to shoulder as everyone was, it was impossible for Steve to overtake the girl, as frustrating as her distracted ambling was.
A beep inaudible to all but superhuman ears had the king glancing down at his wrist cuff- that perhaps wasn’t just an ordinary wrist cuff after all, Steve should have learned by now that deceptive technology could be cloaked anywhere and in anything, if from no one else but T- no, no, bad topic. Redirect.
He walked away, and Steve kept staring at his back, as if in remote pleading for him to stay and explain- but Steve knew, and he did not know, and he knew, but didn’t
It was beginning to fade.
to get this done one at a time.
after this shindig for ages – I am aware.” Tony parsed out a smile, perilously polite. “The groom?”
There haven’t been many distances in Steve’s life that he has been afraid to cross. There was the flaming chasm in the camp that Steve had first rescued Bucky from- with Red Skull on the other side. There were the twenty steps between him and Peggy, resplendent in a red dress, in that dingy, bustling bar so very many years ago. Still, he’d always taken the leap in the end- flung himself into the unknown, across distances and down heights, never knowing the touch of cowardice. Even when his legs had been too scrawny or too banged up to bear his weight, he’d crawled forward. Sheer grit, if nothing else.
“I had it, I had him, why would, Steve,
difference between sass to pass the time in those infrequent moments of boredom whilst punching aliens, and sass that covered up very real annoyance over the welfare of a fellow… an ex-teammate.
Fuck, he was here. Tony slid a pass into the chubby fist of the kid propped on his dad’s shoulders, high fived his other hand, ruffled his hair. Steve felt something warm, and strangely gooey stir to life inside his chest. And then those eyes moved over to…
“You should come back.”
“Would it have killed you to
The sound of graphite over paper resumed – Rhodey patiently etching out line after line, mechanical pencil light in his grasp; Tony watching along, absolutely absorbed. Apart from fleeting thoughts about how impossible this would have been for him ten years ago, his attention barely wavered. He didn’t remember the last time he’d physically completed a design – MIT, maybe. Rhodey’s style had barely changed since then: he was all about the clean strokes, well-defined boundaries. Used an eraser whenever there was a scribble out of place, scrupulously neat as ever, but never too much as to wear down the paper itself.
He snuffled against the pillowcase, breath moistening the cotton against his lips. The sweat on his back was still drying, the cool air in the room gusting past it pleasantly.
Maybe it’s that the time wasn’t wasted after all.
Steve opted for a photostatic veil this time round- Clint had a couple on him even as they’d fled, and the face morphers had proved invaluable so far in keeping the authorities off their tail. Steve ordinarily hated it- the nanoparticles of the mask shifting around his skin, the all too blatant fakeness of it jarring to the very essence of the way he operated. But here, amidst the ruins of a city and her people that had been wronged so heavily by the Avengers, a baseball cap simply wasn’t going to cut it.
And then, again, like a player struck on a broken record.
“There’s been a….situation in Russia. St. Petersburg, to be exact.” Vision’s voice was careful, almost inordinately so. “The UN Council is dithering over whether to send the Avengers or not- Russian sovereignty is a rather delicate thing to violate. I don’t believe the Russian government would seriously object to our presence there, but by the time anything is fully finalised, there may be several lives lost already. Considering the Accords are new and must be honoured to restore the public’s faith in us- well.” And here, his words slowed down to something even more cautious. “The best option in this scenario would be to send a group….not technically under the purview of the Accords, per say, owing to a lack of signatures- to get in, erase the threat and get out before any significant damage is caused.”
“And you’re a pre-pubescent arachnid.” Tony said, or something else idiotic along those lines because there was laughter after that- laughter and banter and smiles- real ones- and lots, and lots of messing around with doodads.
Tony stood there, not five paces away, shirt and trousers wrinkled past repair, felt hat crumpled under his fingers. There were dark circles under his eyes, but they looked clear under the touch of the early morning light.
So yeah. It’s one of his old exes on some morning show grasping for TRP’s, and Tony stops because he’s trying to figure out if she’s lying about the vanilla sex or lying about being an ex in the first place because with that IQ and that mole, he really doesn’t see himself…though memory has been faulty in the past what with all the substance abuse…hm, it’s been a while since he dated now that he thinks about it-
“Better?” Stark asked, voice saying nothing.
She looked beautiful – and it had never seemed to strike him more, not even when she’d glanced up at him through Natalia’s doe-lashes and he’d been a dying bastard leering at her bikini shots.
“Sometime during that battle, the fight stopped being about freedom and the Avengers’ ability to save the world when it needed them, and became about protecting Bucky Barnes instead. And while I’d never back down from saving a man’s life, Captain.” Clint’s eyes flashed, from things brighter than emotion. “We damn well should have had the right to make that choice for ourselves.”
“You’ve seen him tonight.” Iron Man finally responded, helm still turned away. His joints were fixed in place, and the utter lack of clicking gears and soft hums alerted one to the utter lack of movement. “He’s doing fine.”
“My interfacing for this baby isn’t quite ready yet.” Okay, it wasn’t a tower, but what the fuck possessed him not to install an elevator to take him up to the main facility level? Security shmecurity, lack of time. Goddamn
“Yes.” But there was no elaboration, and T’Challa turned away and bent his head, making flicking gestures over the cuff and Steve couldn’t keep his damn mouth shut.
Tony snapped his fingers, terminating the train of thought and setting the video to play.
A slight exhale of amusement. Steve’s ears heard it, over all the chatter and music and Melbourne’s night air. Tony extended a hand, fingers long and tanned, the dark green card peeping from the crevice between his index and middle digits.
He felt his shoulders loosen, releasing the guilt of seventy years out into the thin, chilly air, and he let them fall back- let them hit the ground packed with snow and let his arms, unburdened by any weapon wave back and forth.
She nods, and remains waiting in the doorway. Steve is motionless on the bed, the looming weight of the future wrapped around his wrist.
Steve shuddered, and stepped back. The breeze whistled in the space they had just vacated, eliciting goosebumps over his bare forearms. He had to clear his throat twice, to get it working. “Thu..thursday, then?”
“I saw jellyfish in the sea life aquarium yesterday.” Steve informed him, because Sam was even funnier with a climbing blood pressure. “They’re rather beautiful.”
And here they were again, where the wounds ran the deepest. “I wanted to tell you.” Steve said, desperate all over again, “-but it would only have hurt yo-“
“When did you know.”
Natasha’s eyes went back to the linoleum floor she was so interested in scoping. It would probably save her life too, in some insane Natasha way, when that attack on the farmhouse finally came. “You should have stayed here.”
“I did. But the energy requirements for making a three inch chip and eight hundred pounds is remarkably different, believe it or not.”
The exhale left his chest, whistling out silently and mingling with the morning air. Steve hoisted himself to his feet, brushed his gravelly palms against the thighs of his jeans briskly. The air was crisp, the smell of sweet-spun sugar and coffee beans winding out from the café three doors down the street, drifting dreamlessly on the breeze. People had begun slipping out into the street again-jogging past in track pants, headphones secure over their ears, early birds in blazers and ties walking to work with a bagel in hand. Sunlight filtered dimly through the gaps between the buildings, golden shafts of light illuminating patches on the asphalt road, shining off the glossy steel and mirrored exteriors of the tall skyscrapers.
“Glad you’re here.” Steve said, not even looking Tony in the helmet. His neck was twisting this way and that, as if to keep an eye out for the Extremis-enhanced thugs lurking around. Fat load of good that would do when they crisped up his skin like pork crackling. “Three hostiles, enhanced. I’ve cleared all civilians from the immediate premises but I might need you to keep perimeter if needed–”

things, and elevons are one, and two things are more than one thing and more things lead to more drag–
“Understandable enough under the circumstances.” There was a notable pause, where a name or title should have been. Steve had noticed that King T’Challa seemed cautious to avoid addressing him- maybe because of the obvious absence of the shield, and they definitely weren’t casual enough to call each other by their first names. He didn’t know what the issue with a simple Mr. Rogers was, though.
“Yeah.” It came out as an exhale, halted from escaping by his faceplate sliding down into place. His ears filled with the whine of the repulsors coming to life, boots leaving the ground as Tony glanced aside and cast an unseen smile at Steve squinting upward at him through the sunlight. “Next time, take the shield with you on the subway.”
“I suppose I just want to see if people ask.” Swando’s teeth were brilliant white against his lips, cheeks hanging loosely on the sides. He lifted a hand to his brow, deep-set eyes straining into the distance. “I suppose I must take my leave.”
“You’ve been here all night.”
to him. It was only about ten times more annoying than being interrupted.
“Talk to people. Mingle. Someone your age.” The tone sounded more entreating than anything; it was almost touching. “Relics are all well and fine, but it’s the present that counts, yeah?”
“Jesus, kid.” And just like that, the insecurity was gone- fuck, it was like the kid was
“I thought I’d left that particular one behind.”
Clint said nothing.
Steve shot a tight smile at him and moved towards the sinks, and Tony was half-certain he’d heard a muttered ‘”much obliged” over the sound of gurgling water hitting the ceramic. Seconds passed, occupied by the motions of Captain America working up a lather from public handwash and scrubbing the gaps between his fingers rigorously. Jeez, Tony bet he counted up to ten and waited for the germs to die and everything.
Steve pulled his eyes away, sent his gaze skittering over the other couples on the floor, scoping for anomalies. The blonde and redhead right up the front were clearly the stars-she was positively ethereal, scarlet locks resplendent in victory curls and kissing the side of her chin. A sleeveless polka dotted blouse, and a short red skirt that flared when her partner hoisted her up in the air, arms strong, lines flawless. On the descent, he dipped her backwards, fitted waistcoat straining against a flexing back, purple lining gleaming. Steve could still discern echoes of the old rhythm in their movements-
“B-but meeting your heroes! Its like, I barely got to talk to-“
“You still there?” Sam’s voice shot through the deep-splintering the canvas of machine noise, as clear as a trilling bird in silent, mountainous gorges.
“I just…I want the old times back.” Steve had never thought, in all the days that he’d been awake, that the ‘old times’ could mean anything within this spanking, brand-new century. But he wasn’t thinking of anything else in this moment. “Shawarma, and aliens, and all the rest. I want to be on a team of heroes, and be worthy of being carried around on trading cards in a good man’s pocket.  I want to be on the side of
Was that…..was that a compliment? It didn’t much feel like one- not with the way it pricked at Tony’s sore spots. Yes, he was damn well aware of how dangerous the things he made could be, thanks.
“Nah, that’s Natasha.” Barton’s mouth moves, while every other part of him is giving the impression of sleep. “Have you heard those things? They’re fucking
Eyes that were a few shades lighter, flicked over him head to foot, just as scrutinising as Tony’s own. Steve’s voice barely carried when he spoke, but his tone wasn’t unreadable, not really. “I’ve missed that armour.”
And Steph raises her eyes, and without missing a beat, returns: “I do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands that the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses.”
Now….it was, mildly disconcerting. Discovering you were nothing like the fella you thought you were.
Steve had a weakness for it, for red. Any time one of his paintings looked a touch too dull, like the colours had been leached of their potency, like everything was too drab, too still (
Tom looked at him steadily, something almost like understanding flashing through coal-black eyes. It was…discomfiting. “Well, the area is buzzing with rescue efforts now. Army reached there a while back. Anyone who…might have been there, should be safe and sound.”
“That was a…” Steve cleared his throat casually, fooling absolutely no one – god, Tony loved him so much. “That was a really nice party, tonight. Pete and MJ loved it.”
to be Director.”
The echo of that smile returned on Steve’s lips. To be honest, even through all that, Tony wasn’t sure if it had ever entirely left. “Never said we didn’t.”
Tony drew the crisp air in, lungfuls of cool breath that were exhaled just as quietly. The city seemed muted, but like everyone was merely asleep – like New York was teetering on the cusp of opening its eyes. The only sounds that reached his ears were that of the suit: flex, release and clank as he took one step after the next. He wasn’t wearing his helmet. It would’ve seemed incongruous had it been his nanite suit, but this was the Mark VII armour.
the woman raising her knuckles and rapping her dance partner smartly on the head, as if they weren’t performing for a hundred people. The man’s mouth screwed up in mock indignation, eyes shining brown in the light, bursting to a thousand crinkles. He bent his head, lips moving next to the woman’s ears, the cocky smirk seeming like a distant memory of the past.
the description said), made using an ancient technique inlaying precious jems into jade or metal. Recesses had apparently been drilled into the jade, and the gems inset, held in place by bands of gold. Wearing such a ring was a mark of a skilled warrior.
A shining image, through rose-tinted glasses. There was something about that too, which rattled at the shadowy edges of his mind; tinted glasses, tinted glasses and dark eyes–
She fixed her eyes on him, steady and unwavering- the same eyes that had fixated on his the day they’d decided to…..step back a little. He wondered what she thought, what her reaction had been- on knowing that the people that he’d inadvertently chosen over her had left anyway.
“Maybe the key was,” T’Challa continued, a little slower. “-seeing the man behind the weapon. The man who’d lost family just the way I had. There was nothing drawing us apart- except the action that I’d choose to take in that moment.”
“If you continued indulging your hobbies and rejoined the team,” Christ almighty not this again– “would that make me a member of the Avengers?”
and it’s a little, okay only completely, entirely, impossible to imagine you having a terrible social life.”
Steve wasn’t the only one who’d caught it, there was an outburst of snickers from the group to his right at the redhead’s violence; and it was a blow in its own right, realising he’d been caught in stasis, staring for the past several minutes at a show he thought he couldn’t tolerate.
Tony opened his mouth, something about how he came prepared while Steve came dressed for Whole Foods, but Steve beat him to it. “Unless you’re reconsidering the whole business.”
Steve’s jaw clenched, very subtly. Tony admired the strong lines of it, beatific smile in place. And then, with a pronounced shake of his head as if he’d forgotten his place in the script, stepped out of the way with a bow and an expansive, ‘after you’ gesture.
“Someone like me?” Steve had already risen half-way through the passing minutes without realising it-he pushed himself up all the way through, palms pressing hard for support against the pallet. He didn’t want to be lying down for this. He didn’t think he could bear it.
basically devolves into a sniggerfest.
Steve didn’t look brassed off by it, which felt like a damn revelation. There was fondness in the blues of his eyes, like every time someone from the team repeated the well-worn ‘Language!’ joke – line of sight slightly askew like it was lingering on the crinkles around Tony’s eyes. “Not sure if you’re aware, but there’s this modern saying that goes… people leave their managers, not their jobs.”
“Neither.” Tony had no evidence to substantiate the certainty in his voice, yet certain he was. He pulled in another, cleansing breath, and let his words twist into something ironic. “This is the work of the Reality gem.”
“Really.” Tony breathed; and it was a light, sibilant, almost scoffing sound. “Answer me this, then. Would you have signed the Accords?”
They fight some more, and the world blows up around them, going to pieces. They fight together against an army, and for once, Tony Stark doesn’t feel so common. Doesn’t feel the urge to grandstand, to be the best and brightest. It seems almost natural, being part of an integrated whole. Voices in his ear and people at his back…and it’s a strange relief to not be one of a kind, not even in this.

Tony shook his head a little, gaze still fixated on the floor. More statement than self-rebuke. “He lies better than that.”
“Another round of applause for our lads from Swing Patrol! I’d also like to thank John Morrison, and his fabulous Swing City band, for lending their tunes to us tonight. Now, let’s welcome back on stage our amazing marathon dancers; they’ll be entertaining you guys from seven pm to seven am, that’s straight up twelve hours of dancing, I don’t know how they do it-”
“Despite what pop culture would have one believe, it’s hardly as simple as clearing a video game level. Fight through the projections, get the McGuffin-y physical representation of our hearts’ deepest desires, learn The Lesson, and bam – we’re out of the delusion.” It would be so…primally satisfying though, to beat the shit out of his issues. Then again, nine out of ten of his enemies in real life tended to be physical manifestations of his own screw ups anyway – the tenth slot being reserved for the odd alien, of course.
, of Tony pressing closer, hand smoothing over the back of Steve’s neck, felt hat crushed somewhere in the rapidly decreasing space between their bodies. Two unspeakable seconds of setting foot in another world, this world-and how long had he needlessly waited at its threshold, not knowing that the door was open?
.” Tony’s chest was squeezing on itself, the sheer
“You barely talk at all- and I don’t know if it’s because of recent events or because you do not feel as free with me as you did with JARVIS- but all the data I’ve gathered indicate that you talk better than most members of the human race and you…should.” FRIDAY was still going strong and…..hell. There it was, Tony’s old friend, Master Guilt. “….And you haven’t called me Girl Friday in ages, or Fry- which is a witty wordplay on my name and the fact that I’m the youngest of your AI, after the manner of fish; and I understand my predecessor disapproved of your nicknaming but I feel rather…prized, when you do so.”
(He was wrong.)
Steve cleared his throat. “I don’t recall there being anyone else.”
Too late. Too fucking late.
“No.” Tony kept calm and carried on with his uber-light smile; he had just saved the city, or at very least the block, and deserved better than this conversational turn at two in the afternoon. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m all out of honesty and openness at the moment, so I’ll catch up with you later. Kay?”
“Shushush.” Steve raised a hand to presumably bat Tony away, except he kind of grabbed Tony by the lapel and pulled him down instead – which okay, they were friends now, but jeez,
“I don’t like poetry.” He says, and that was supposed to be the end of it.
her acting would have been way wor-”
“Mr Stark?”
She looked amazing- even in a hologram, without the help of colour to fill in her strawberry blonde hair, or her creamy, freckled cheeks. Her hair was perfectly coiffed, her collar straight and starched, but there was that smallest indent in her lower lip that indicated she’d been chewing it before making the call.
Steve parsed out a sigh of his own, somehow eloquent for a glorified, unsyllabic burst of air. “Why do you always have to–”
to me and I swear I’ll never break-“
“I am.” Vision said, steadily. He raised his right hand, tilting it back and forth in the morning sun with fingers spread wide apart, as if perusing it. “I enclose parts of JARVIS within me, whom Mr Stark created. Parts of ULTRON live within me too, also brought into being by Mr Stark. And then I was given this.” A long finger rising to tap soundlessly against the gem set into smooth red skin. “The Stone which drove Mr Stark into madness long enough to set the wheel of fate into inevitable motion, bringing us…here. In a ruined city, seeking peace. Rest.”
He pushed himself back from the suit with a squeal of rubberised wheels, the helmet staring at the floor with empty eyeslits. Hobbled off the seat to stand up straight, breaths loud in the still air – bright spots dancing even when he closed his eyelids. Okay fine, time for beddie-bye.
? Even if they were in their mid-thirties at the time?
“You don’t need to psychoanalyse me, Nat.” Clint didn’t blink at all. He stared at the small jars on the counter, glass with metal tops, screwed on tight, filled with sticky jam. One, two, three. “You can just ask.”
Except it had been over three years since he’d met a cocky blonde breezing by him on his morning jogs, and Steve was a lake of still water before any op. Always had been. Sure, his mind could be churning up and falling to pieces on the inside, but he’d disciplined his body too well. There was nothing restless behind Steve’s motions now except the very
Tony had a brief, vivid vision of one of those Buzzfeed compilations of weird things New Yorkers did on the subway – and in it a picture of Captain America, glowering in the train with the shield on his back and a bag of satsumas clutched to his chest.
Soldiers. Tony had been surrounded by them all his life. For all that their little moments of joy weren’t inconsequential, they still hinged on conveniences. Take comfort from all quarters.
to boot. The latter didn’t make much sense to him (though in his less deprecatory moments, he thought it didn’t make much sense to anyone else either).
“There are still over twenty seven counts of murder alone on the Soldier, all almost certainly confirmed. This doesn’t really change much for your friend.” T’Challa spoke, something almost like caution tinging his tone.
Forward it was, then. Maybe he’d be able to emerge beyond the stage where the band had set up; they couldn’t have closed off the entire street. Movement was teeth-grindingly slow, it took him fifteen minutes to even draw level with the far end of the square stage. He threw back a last look at the performers-there were four…maybe five couples onstage. They seemed to be dancing to their own rhythms, instead of the choreographed, synchronised charade from before; and it was enough to stagger Steve for a second, keep his gaze locked and blinking. The band was closer now, the music loomed even louder-a slow, lilting saxophone underlying a throaty voice:
But Tony had a guest list to go through. “And the Big Flighty Giant?”
Steve freezes. No, no, he stills. The setting sun angles over Tony’s cheekbone, a deep, burnt red.
Outside the lakehouse, Laura is bundling the kids into a van. Clint steps down from the porch, murmurs something to her, then jogs over to where Steve is watching, arms folded.
He could have asked, the same kind of purposeless chatter that populated any Avengers comm,
“I can be there in three hours. Do you need me there?”
, in the best, most
“No.” Natasha said, and Clint wanted to take those little jars in his hands, take them and smash them against the tile. Small glass jars of blackberry jam that his wife had slaved over because she couldn’t think about why her husband wasn’t home with their kids.
It’s the full stop that annoys him. It isn’t a question. She doesn’t sound questioning. She sounds dubious…and if he’s being downright blasphemous, outright sarcastic. Captain America should not know how to do ‘sarcastic’ in addition to ‘heartbreakingly sincere’. It confuses the hell out of him.
“I have the shield.” Tony said. His chest hurt. “I want to throw it away, but Howard wouldn’t have liked it.”
“I’m worried about you.”
“What if Ross or someone else wants to use the Avengers for somethi-“
Sam didn’t wait for the completion of the sentence. His finger was back, tapping at the side of his visor, eyes affixed on a distant wall. “Cap. Come in. Cap.”
He hadn’t bothered saving it- it had seemed a bit too foolishly hopeful. Slipping that phone in the FedEx package in the first place had been an exercise in foolish hope. He had known that the effort was futile, even before the letter had been sent and every sentence playing on loop in his head made him cringe with the ignorance innate in those words. But now, the phone was ringing and the screen was flashing and that meant on the other side was….was…
“Har de har har.” Tony’s lips did flicker into something genuine for a second though. Goddamn it, this was why he was so insistent. Moments like these that convinced him that he and the good Captain could do better,
She sets down what looks like a first aid kit next to his elbow with a muted thump. Rustling sounds let him know that she’s settled into a stool opposite him; he’s looking over her shoulder, at some blurred middle distance. The sting of antiseptic on his clavicle is smoothed away by her cool touch.
No, the sun wasn’t setting. But the dimmed light had gone awfully red, casting shadows across Peggy’s cheekbones, creeping across the diner table that was somehow too solid and yet not enough under Steve’s numb fingers. “Peg.”
Steve had been silent for quite a while. The sound of Velcro cracking free from its crackly grip permeated the air again; the pale skin of Steve’s wrist gleaming in the light of the cockpit. He was in his old SHIELD stealth suit-the one Sam had first glimpsed Captain America in, and they’d gone on the run from the government for the first time. Not an upgraded one, the very first suit. Stark made suits didn’t have Velcro.
“Why didn’t you?” Tony asked, and it was like his mind had whited out with the pain again, images flipping before his eyes in a vividly torturous reel. “There was nothing stopping you.”
“All my life really, it’s been the same.” He was backing up from the table now, hand flying out in bigger and bigger gestures. Face growing flatter and more remote. It was a production, really. A production to hurt. “People in awe of the genius. In awe of the money. Not me though, not really. Too busy looking down their noses at the philandering and the sleeping around. Merchant of Death was a kind name, really. They never expected anything better.”
“I don’t live with common men and women. I was brought to life among heroes.” Vision’s voice didn’t sound particularly proud. It didn’t sound much like anything. “They don’t shun responsibility for the world around them, for the calamities that happen in it. They don’t push blame on others, or on the uncontrollable vagaries of fate. No, they invite blame. They yearn to save, and despise themselves when their hands aren’t long enough to reach everybody.”
His fingertips and knuckles were white, digging into Rhodey’s shoulder in a useless attempt to attain balance when they’d crumpled to the ground. He should have realised it, loosened his grip, pulled them back. He should not have glanced down at his own bare chest, a deer’s frightened twitch- where the contusions lay stark against his skin like a brand.
“Earthquakes.” Tony breathed.
“So yeah.” Tony stumbles over the words, because he’s been on an interrupted date with Captain America and
Natasha had the gall to actually roll her eyes at him. And after she’d told him off on five separate occasions for it too, once memorably in front of a supervillain.
“So it’s a…diplomatic thing? Trade?”
Except that couldn’t be right. They had left a long time ago.
He laughs. It emerges from his chest in short, stuttered bursts, and it hurts his reactor a little, but it feels so good. Behind, he hears a little hitch of sound; and he turns, and Stephanie is standing with marker ink on her fingernails, standing and staring and looking a little breathless even though he’s the one laughing.
He was sitting on the sidewalk, next to the front wheel of the Cadillac-butt cold, legs outstretched, hands folded on his thighs. Eyes still enamoured by the stage a couple of feet away.
The last time Tony had indulged in Mexican, he’d been toilet-ridden with gastro for over a week. “Last time MJ misheard you and now she keeps threatening to weld my ass shut.”
And yet, in the same breath, something in him, something almost monstrous- itched to
a sorority) unchallenged speed-reading champ for all of his time there.
Steve…hadn’t realised the absence of the pattering sound, the quiet on the roof. The air smelled musty, the silence loud enough to swallow him whole. He nodded.
“I’m not leaving without him.” If that entire conversation had one conclusion, it would be this.
, and Sam didn’t need the cover of light to read those eyes. Stark’s lip twitched derisively. “Rhodey was standing by his principles, not just by me. I could’ve turned tail and ran, picked another side…and he’d still be there. Falling to the ground, robbed of full use of his spine, fighting the good fight.”
that he’d received in response to letting the shield go- he’d never faced this. This outright….censure. It…he didn’t know if it was right. Justified. It probably wasn’t. But it certainly was…something. Different.
“We just……we didn’t have much time together. Amid all the fighting. I miss him, I suppose.” Steve smiled a little ruefully, rubbing the back of his neck with his right hand. It was true enough, he guessed.
with enough flexibility to make it through narrow passages. The Bleeding Edge interface wasn’t anywhere near ready… “Or was it just to make me jealous over what I can’t have? Because you know your existence is enough pooh bear-”
“I didn’t deserve you then.” Steve pressed the words into his back, blunt and not-to-be-argued-with. “I don’t know if I do now. But you’re here, and I don’t feel the need to question any aspect of how the most…how the best part of my life came to be.”
Success. Tony strode over, turning to face Steve and cocking a hip against the neighbouring sink. Moisture was beginning to creep into his finely-tailored trouser wool, but sacrifices had to be made for style. “Thousands of genes present in the human genome, producing
With his approach, all those little details of that first suit that had simultaneously aggravated and thrilled Tony resolved into clarity again – the clunky, candy-red gloves to match the boots, the chunkier belt, the two silver stripes running down the shoulder joints, the skintight fabric with its almost offensive simplicity. He’d called it spangly, the first time round. If he’d known it would be the only time, that Steve would come outfitted in a navy-and-grey more suited to the modernity of his times when they’d meet again…well. Maybe he’d have gotten over his adolescent resentment a little quicker, and indulged his childish amazement a bit more.
“Automatised metallic exoskeletons equipped with repulsor ports that enable free air suspension, you know this-” The response was automatic. Hell, Rhodey was good at this.
His brows automatically furrowing, Steve opened up the mail with a swipe. The message body and the subject header were both empty, with one video attachment only- but that wasn’t what caught his eye. What jabbed at his vision and made the steady beat in his chest stutter, was the sender’s address.
“Her brother died.” It had been weighing on his tongue for ages, so it was only fitting that he let it out, bleak and flat. Clint didn’t feel any better for it. “I think she knows that she fucked up.”
Sam didn’t blink. “How’s he doing?”
(Fond thoughts of afternoon naps. Damn, he really had become an old man.)
And Rhodey deserved better than that. Better than catering endlessly to someone’s infinite set of….needs.
Then the quiet began.
Steve exhaled, breaking the eye contact between a breath and the next. Glanced up at the Tower, sunrise mirrored in his irises. “I always thought my faith was in people, not institutions.” The lines of his chin straight and golden-strong, words steady and unwavering. “But institutions are only as good as the people holding them up. Laws are only as good as the people holding them up.”
Tony was delirious, so he thought he must have been dreaming it up at the time-Rhodey bursting in on him in frustration, then the scowl on the face wilting until it resembled something like resignation, and amusement. The affection in that voice,
T’Challa leaned back in his chair, spine still impeccably straight. His tone was inscrutable. “What do you plan on doing with it?”
the fuck is it possible for someone to be so adorable and badass at the same time?
’s cover just last month. Better made up, too.
Steve wouldn’t fall victim to the same heartless viciousness that Stark had.
So it made sense that the recordings would always begin at some point during their confrontation in the bunker, without exception. It appeared as though Tony was focusing on trying to…correct just this event in time, instead of trying to reach back further and course-correct….because how far could they go, really? The first time the Accords came up? That day on Clint’s farm? Their first meeting, when Howard’s friend Steve Rogers told his son that he’d known men worth ten of him and he’d never be a hero? Hell, Steve had been fucking up Tony’s life long before the man had even been born. His plane had plummeted into the Arctic, and with it had plummeted any likelihood of a decent childhood for the Stark. Of course, there were others (
“And yet you have spent a hundred and thirteen minutes working on the suit.” Oho, harsh.
Steve shoved his hands into his pockets, straps of his backpack drawing tight on his shoulders. The base of his throat felt tighter. Melbourne was supposed to be different. A place he’d never been to, with no preimages to cloud existing vision, no memories to leech away colour from the present.
“Not with what they did, I don’t.” Rhodey replied, with nary a pause. Like it was that simple. That easy. To choose never to forgive, and expect the grand machinations of the world to let him keep to that choice.
And possibly new legs, considering his were going to fall off any second now-
Tony’s voice was barely holding level. “You held it back because you
The phone in Steve’s pocket buzzed.
“Okay.” Tony said. “Okay.”
Sam could hear his breathing, in the quiet. Steady and unchanged, chest lifting and falling unimpededly. His heart was still running at above eighty beats a minute.
“We have a situation? Giant coffee heist, two blocks down, near Cherry Lane maybe?”
There was an almost ominous silence in response to that, and Steve felt almost obliged to provide a reason (and resented Sam all the more for it), “It’s Sharon.”
“Ah, but darling.” Tony glanced back over his shoulder, hooking a thumb under the silver chain that still dangled around his neck, tags clinking with the motion; the only thing he wore to bed. “You know I had to match.”
The answer is a farm that isn’t supposed to exist, in the middle of nowhere. “Minsk,” Natasha says instead, and it doesn’t sound like a lie he’s heard before.
Too bad. “This wasn’t her fault-”
“Kid, it’s fi-”
“Why not?” The words left his chest on a breath.
“There’s nothing here.” But sand and rock and a clump of three trees, with fissured bark and straggly leaves, sleeping at the far end of the beach. Sam could hear his own, whistling breaths.
It was a constant
“An old man’s allowed his hobbies FRIDAY.” Tony twirled idly on the stool, widescreens and ceiling beams and industrial downlights spinning slowly in his vision
” The menace in question quietened down immediately, blue eyes watching him attentively. Tony turned his head away from that stare, back faced to the bed he was still sitting on, gaze dropping to the wrinkled skin stretching over his thighs. He pinched a little of it between his index and thumb, the tiny liver spot marring the skin changing shape with the action. “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. That’s the first line.”
“The Army cannot be allowed to know that you’re here.” Stark seemed like he was almost forcing it out through gritted teeth, barely reigned energy jittering through his frame. “You need to leave. I’ll…I’ll fetch Rogers.”
Steve blinked. Stepped back. There, hanging on the wall were just two shields-iron painted dark and gleaming, cold and hard. Memories of blows ringing past the surface coating the iron as thickly as any paint.
that no one who’d heard ever really forgot. The sound of rain drops spattering against a tin roof, fast and quick, like the rhythm beat out by a marching band.
His arms rose and fell in the typical gestures for closing off background processes, taking holograms and throwing them to the storage folders or the bin as necessary, normal procedure for ‘shut down’ for the end of night...beginning of morning…middle of day, whatever the fuck time it was now. Set all fabrication units, swipe, close down search algorithm, swipe, close articles on new memory alloc methods, swipe, new urgent marked personal emails, swipe-
better. They couldn’t be entirely exclusive sets, not with the way Steve needled at his curiosity so deliciously, made his big brain sit up and take notice.
“Almost at the end of it.” Steve murmured. Weapons from eras long past hung on the walls, carefully maintained. There was an early 19
“Isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be.” That was…that was his voice. That was Tony’s voice, echoing strangely in the silence that followed, and he should have bloody seen this coming. All that remained was to hold on to the rails and wait for the punchline – wait for Steve’s eyes to grow colder at the mockery made of him. All that exited, however, was a solitary word. “Forgetting.”
Wanda was upstream- there was a stream, or a brook, or one of those synonyms chattering past the nearby rocks; the faint gurgling sound was the only thing that broke the silence amidst the repetitive
He was breathing heavily when the sparks littered to the floor again, a bright spot of heat stinging to life on his cheek bone. His elbow ached with the recoil; shoulder joints worn tight, sweat droplets crawling down his jaw like ants.
Water streamed down those shoulders, more bent than broad, now; the downpour hitting the leather in a relentless beatdown. Steve didn’t raise his head.
“Gave a set of coordinates. Said that a number of people needed to be rescued from cave-ins caused by earthquake aftershocks somewhere off the coast of Guinea.” Steve sealed the flap of his glove and curled his fingers into an empty fist again. Maybe not fidgety, but there was something strangely aimless about that blue stare. Like he could hear the voice inside his head and was just repeating it to himself, over and over. “There’s also some suspicious activity going on in the neighbourhood, and there wasn’t going to be a better time to investigate. And to bring Falcon.”
Because you see- he understood now. The singular moment when everything had gone horrifically wrong. It wasn’t when Tony had discovered that his parents had been murdered brutally by a brainwashed Bucky Barnes.
“I…” And there was a bit of hesitation here, Tony’s fingers fiddling with the hem of his jacket pocket, but he forged on. “If the UN council is……dragging its feet. If there’s any reason the…authorised Avengers can’t do their jobs. Then I’ll call. Drop the info so you guys can sort things.”
Steve turned his head, and Tony was probably just imagining it, but the sudden impression of a solid gaze pinning him down was hard to shrug off. They stood still for protracted moments, sightlines ensnared and legs unmoving, before Tony saw those shoulders swivel and scarlet boots begin to take the first steps toward him.
there at the desolate Siberian bunker while Steve brought down the shield on the arc- and felt a wave of alarm strong enough to never contemplate the idea ever again.)
“Steve.” He whispered, more breath than voice. They were so close now.
(Clint could still feel the creak of his bow pushing down on the tendons of her neck, so much stronger than they seemed. So much frailer than she wanted them to be.)
Memory-Tony took a long time to speak. When he did, his voice was wiped of emotion too, even if the words were slow in coming. “…Barnes? The Winter Soldier? The one who you- when SHIELD fell-“
Steve….had to pause there, for a second- maybe in admiration, maybe something else. He didn’t know why he was surprised; he should have understood the second Tony had traipsed down the corridors of the Siberian bunker, talking merrily about truces and the Manchurian Candidate. “I don’t know why I expected you to stick firmly to the rules.”
Tony dropped to his knees without a thought, and patted DUM-E’s strut. He blinked- once, twice, then huffed a little in amusement as DUM-E waved the pepper can before his nose.
The replying email came half an hour later.
“Anger is a futile emotion.” Long way from knowing that, and actually putting it to practice though. “I’m asking you to tell me where you think I went wrong, so I can do better.”
you?”
way I know how, because you’re too stubborn to listen to better.”
Quiet.
The blood rushed to his ears, a roaring sound. Or maybe it was still the ocean. He couldn’t tell the difference anymore, between it and him.
Then, almost inaudibly. “I liked it.”
Sam blinked steadily. “I had to make sure.”
Iron Man stilled, helm turned to the side. It was impossible to pinpoint what those blank eyeslits were looking at. “We’re probably going to find nothing else in here, but we should still physically check the rest of the rooms to confi-”
Until a finger prodded him in the side, scientifically engineered, Tony was certain, to be extra poky. “You know you’ll whinge about it later.”
– as though this was their regular banter and Tony was blabbering on for the hell of it. Which yes, he’d been guilty of in the past, but there was a qualitative – a
Tony pulled his eyes away from the wall, shifting in place and feeling the crumpled paper in his pocket prickle at his skin. Past the window, the sun was finally setting.
No one was going to care. Which was…fine, good even. It solved their problems, got Ross off his back for good, restored the public’s trust in the Avengers which meant no more fugitive status…it was good. Even if a part of Tony remained, small and shifting with unease at the back of his brain, twisting disquiet at the pit of his stomach – the same that reared up every time he had to release tech into the production line without perfecting it. Sure there were deadlines, some things just weren’t
His heart kept pace with his steps –

He could feel nothing- not his scored knees from being dragged repeatedly across the deathly cold concrete floor, not his bruised shoulder blades from being smashed against the wall, not the thick, blackened blood seeping thin and constant from his nostrils, not the repulsor scorch marks over his twisted ribs.

need to go around making house calls to nag us into attending your little social event.”
“Tony didn’t do that.” No thought preceded the words; the response was automatic, and far more assertive than Steve had been so far. It just…..it was an undeniable fact, to him. Not subject to discussion. “The General did. And just because he wasn’t behind bars, doesn’t mean he was any less of a prisoner. Besides,” And he had to soothe here, had to get more reasonable- Clint had believed he was going to be living with his family for good, being denied of that had to hurt, Steve had to understand- “I’d never have been able to spring you guys from an underwater max prison if Tony Stark really was in charge of keeping you there. Not with the resources I had.”
“I couldn’t sign the Accords because I didn’t…I was scared that they’d make us do things we didn’t want to do.” The words spilled into the coolness of the morning air, frank and uncensored. They weren’t particularly new, nothing that hadn’t been aired out in that first spat at the Facility.
As it turned out, Steve was afflicted by more than just a persistent case of nostalgia.
“You know.” Peter began, a little apprehensively, after all the tech-flailing and idea-exchanging and science-rambling was done. There was an expansive hand gesture, probably in the direction of said ‘doodads’ scattered across his study desk- “Most…..um, adults. Would be pretty pissed that I was doing this.  Instead of. You know.”
Sam’s wings curled out in reflex, stirring the still, muggy air in a graceful flap. War Machine had turned his face away, booted clunks thudding through the ground as he turned toward the black horizon. Steve…
Well, that was one question answered.
.” Tony whines, but the laughter has already started-skipping gaily from one member of their insane little circle to the next. Turns out, Clint can definitely snort mid snore.
The light in Steve’s eyes changed, banked heat dissipating in the face of something softer, brighter. Turned out, his soldier was more of a sentimental snot than a possessive one.
of everything. The swing band with their too shiny coats, the screen with Fred and Ginger waltzing away in perfect video quality. The smarmy dancers, the clamouring crowd that was pushing past him even now, phones lifted high in the air, ready to ‘capture the magic’.
“Step forward,” Iron Man said, instead-and Sam did it, not thinking of how floodlights could pour on them at any second, the click of a hundred rifles arming themselves, the blare of a foghorn asking him to put his hands up and surrender, a set of handcuffs ready to snap on his wrists and toss him back to the bottom of the ocean.
“Atta boy.” Rhodey pronounced sarcastically. His fingers outstretched for an eraser lying just beyond the pad, shoulder straining and back stiff and unbent. Tony bumped it over with a brush of his elbow, and Rhodey’s chin dipped in wordless thanks. “ ‘Sides, if you’re itching at the balls to design this much, you shouldn’t have dropped all those military contracts, hmm?”
“It didn’t feel like that for me, the ice.” The world was hazing around them again, soft and crimson. His fingers curled in harder, held on tighter. “I knew what I was doing was right, but… it didn’t feel like that.”
He probably shouldn’t have sworn. Impressionable young mind and all. Ha.
Steve stayed standing. “You can’t.”
Tony turned around for a last, parting glance, and the Mark VII’s eyes were glowing.
, heading straight for the Arctic shelf. Natasha’s mouth curled slightly, an affectionate smirk as if she could read his mind. “Serves you right for setting such a good example, hmm?”

It was a conscious, mammoth effort to pull his hand away from where it was clenched above his chest, rigid and shaking.
They were silent, as they staggered outside: the cold Siberian sun shining down bright and white on their shadowed lids. The steady crunch of snow under their boots the only sound- after their eardrums had gone deaf from anguished screams and whines and fists and metal hitting metal. Then they listed suddenly to the side- adrenaline had run out and Steve’s limbs had gone weak, and Bucky tumbled over and landed butt-first in the snow.
It wasn’t the only difference. The Black Widow altered her appearance to suit her guise, hair and all, but Natasha Romanov had begun growing her hair out in the interim, longer and longer each time before shearing it all away. Last, Tony had seen it reach Natasha’s waist, damp from the shower as she combed out the tangles and sunned it in the Mansion gardens, something contented about the curve of her face.
The Iron Man stepped out completely from the alcove, two hundred pounds of weight thudding onto concrete. Its fists uncurled, finger by finger, its palms coming alive with a faint white glow of –
“We should.” Tom answered, like it was that easy. “And we don’t. You…still trust the goodness in others. Fight for people, without knowing if they deserve it.” A pause, almost like he knew what his following words would mean. Even if that was impossible. “You’re a good man, Captain Rogers.”
“You mean like yours?”
“Except……I entered high school when I was
“Tell me something.” Tony said – and it wasn’t a long time in coming. It was timed just right. “If I wanted to kiss you right now, would you let me?”
“Please.” Reality flickered around them. The Gem glowed, nanites stirring under Steve’s palm, like the faintest tickle, a warm breath huffed over skin. They peeled out in layers, withdrawing from Tony’s ashy skin and flowing over Steve’s hand – welcoming streams that trailed static electricity till they encased him from wrist to fingertip.
Rhodey seemed to disagree, to put it extremely lightly. “I’ve been in recovery for six goddamn months.”
“But sometimes…” And the smile paled, faded unobtrusively into the distance. Tom’s eyes were clouded over. “Sometimes we remember other things. That is all.”
Steve could imagine how the conversation would go.
It was-surprisingly painful, to think that Steve would have to let go of this soon. Ten hours felt too short, an achingly brief glimpse into a world; into the lives of ten people that he’d probably never see again. They-
“It’s always the same with you millennials. Life is hard, it always is.” Steve’s gloves creaked as he flexed his fingers, boots gleaming cherry red just at the edge of his sight. The old uniform – now that was a different touch. “Don’t know about you, but I’ve got plenty in my life to get outta bed for.”
Steve didn’t say a word. Something creaked in the silence, loud and jarring.
“Gimme some slack, J.” He takes to the air, the wins squealing feedback into his ear. He barely minds, he’s in too good of a mood to. “You know how much I like a show.”
Queens was a dump of a place.
“Boss?”
Steve tucked his fingers in his pockets, thumbs hooking into the riveted belt loops. It felt good to walk again after keeping still for so long.
, a determination almost like the Steve Rogers of old, because he was fucking
Just a bare, pared down version of…not the truth, but the only parts of the truth that really effected Tony.
“Alrighty then! Our fantastic marathon dancers are going to be taking a breather for a minute-” Steve could feel his heart shrivel into his chest at the words, oh no,
“Ye-es. Yes.” Tony manages. He bites into his bagel to stop himself from saying anything stupid.
, does he have issues.)
His thoughts diverted him during the complicated entry procedures – retina scans and all, vaguely annoying but made way more sense than anyone just storming into the Director’s office as used to happen in the olden times, as they were. Procedures passed, the final doors slid open with a hydraulic hiss, Sixty Seven politely nodding at his back and taking their leave.
Another eloquent exhale. There was something more amused about it though, and something about the glimmer in those blue eyes, so rarely and welcomely conceding. “We did.”
Sam watched Stark tilt his head slightly to the right, the rapidly changing, increasingly complex microexpressions contorting his face, the silently mouthed
“But you had to save your friend, didn’t you.” And Clint looked at him, again, and Steve couldn’t look away- and there it was, all the acrimony. All the disappointment. “Everything else was secondary. Everything.”
Wow, that didn’t go over well at all. Those shoulders pulled up again, too straight, like shirt lines pulled taut under sewing pins. That barely tightening jaw – the lines of Steve’s body could spell out entire stories, if one took the time to notice. Tony just wasn’t entirely understanding this one.
but maybe the past wasn’t their only recourse.
He breathed, then rose to his feet. Fastened the buttons of his jacket, covering up his chest. Flexed his fingers, curled them into fists, flexed them out again. Then, as if the pause had never happened- “Bring her up.”
“It would mean a lot to him.” Tony poked at a loose sheaf on the desk; at least it seemed to be recycled paper. Still, ugh. “Keeps going on and on in that peppy, enthusiastic tone he has, you know the one, about how the famed Black Widow first taught him to fight. Between you and me, I think he’s starting to get worried that the little kiddies think he’s bluffing.”
“The American multibillionaire?”
“Your wife isn’t home.” Natasha returned, and something in Clint’s spine released till the edge of the counter dragged up from his coccygeal to his lumbar. This was good. This was good. One at a time. If she was here, she’d smile at him with those solemn eyes again and Natasha would slink away in the background and he
And so Alex burned their face against a hot dog cart, and Steve was either twisting with the guilt or really regretting that third soda pop. And then that meanie (Alex, not Steve), turned upon the only bystander, an innocent slice of bread, and vengefully squished it under their boot – because everyone knew that dough was shifty by nature, especially the baked variety; and who hadn’t blamed random pieces of bread for their misfortune now and then?
Guttural alien shrieks. Screaming. Dust, dust, everywhere. “The Battle?”
He thought about the folded piece of paper, currently crinkling inside the pocket of his jacket.
“And yes, I’m coming for the goddamned anniversary dinner.” Rhodey huffed, perhaps a touch more dramatically than was called for, in Tony’s esteemed opinion. “We’re not living in the times of her majesty Queen Victoria and you do
It was a common theme for all of them, really.
“You’re welcome, Sir.” JARVIS prompts him primly, and Tony bites back a laugh. He’ll deal with (express his unending gratitude to) his AI later.
A white light danced against the shadows on the wall- a quick flash on and off. Steve resisted the urge to bury his face in his pillow and groan.
Of course, then the memory actually started and all confusions as to whose memory it was got cleared instantly.
The smile disappeared under that moronic moustache. Good. “As amusing as these conversations always are…”
“Fine. I suppose I’ll just have to ask Kamala about this mysterious call to arms–”

I didn’t have you in my time – and. And. It is in the little things.
Ross sported a thin smile. “Maybe try a circle of salt around the house the next time.”
“You sleep on time.” FRIDAY was much more given to interruptions too, possibly because of aforementioned caring. “You cook, and eat, and don’t get completely lost in your work, and listen to me when I ask you to take a break when you do-“
Several more seconds passed in silence. When memory-Tony eventually mustered himself to start speaking again, coldness had seeped into his syllables. “So. Is this meant to be a ‘stay away from my best friend or else-“
“But.” Tony’s tone was stronger here, and yet also more desperate. “If something happens, in some corner of the world. If things go south, and……I tell you to stay out of it. Promise you’ll listen to me.”
“Are you heading off?”
voice. “Out with it.”
These people…they…they
“It was.”
This wasn’t like losing faith, like walking away in the middle of the journey. This was finally staggering to the summit, and seeing your destination over the horizon. This was adding that final fleck of paint, that dab of red, to make the picture all worth it.
(For all his resentment against the world he’d ended up in, Steve was fairly convinced that the ‘modern masterpiece’ that he’d received a link to very early on in his university days, was anything but a masterpiece. He still felt vaguely bad about the reams and reams of mockery that the work had apparently inspired-but considering the role it had just played in his own sarcastic commentary, he was probably a hypocrite.)
No matter how hard it was to convince yourself that heartburning, world-destroying agony was better than the nothingness. It led you nowhere, numbness assembling in layers, emotional calluses thickening until nothing could get through. Not joy, not sorrow, not life and its associated bittersweetness.
scrawled across the espresso machine in ant-like letters. Bruce too, casually hanging by the counter with his chamomile tea in hand, which is such a sham because Bruce never casually does anything.
Maybe because Queens didn’t expect Tony fucking Stark to be meandering in its lanes, not strutting or demanding attention. People just hurried by on their own business, harried and tunnel-visioned. They just looked so……purposeful. Like they knew exactly where to go and what to do, even if they didn’t necessarily enjoy it.
“I’m home.”
“It was…” Natasha paused, because she was better than him, and wanted to pick the right words. She always did, which was the single most frustrating thing because they were the right ones for the ears listening. Never her. “It was a source of safety. Companionship. Purpose.”
in recycling-
“A world where the distribution of power isn’t staggeringly unequal. Where groups of people aren’t free to make decisions that impact the rest of the world without any input, just because they were blessed with that power. That they have to answer to…” And Stark’s breathing had barely stepped up at all, words falling swift and fitful, eyes unseeing (and he’d known it, even on the plane. How had he known it?) “They have to answer to another power, but we won’t call it a higher one because this hypothetical world doesn’t have fatalistic concentrations of….yeah you guessed it, fucking power, in any one place, be it shadowy spy organisations or a Security Council or
After that, he almost preferred the dreams of the ice.
And that thought.
always went, “Don’t fret about it, big guy. It’ll get better, you just need more time.”
And Tony Stark not five hundred metres away, sitting with his back to Steve on a park bench.
Tony strode forward, blood thumping in his ears, uncaring of knees that might give out at any second. A second’s falter, and his fingers were scrabbling over the smooth metal plates, eyes peering through sweat-laden lids. Not a scratch. Not a hint of abuse.
Clint breathed.
registered something as a health hazard, it was pretty damn obviously hazardous. One nudge to the right, and that trunk was going to plow straight through the bed and the floor below. Probably flatten Aunt Petunia’s microwave downstairs too.)
