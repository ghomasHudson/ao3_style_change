“Aurora. I thought we wouldn’t be seeing you until next week in London,” Anne said in surprise before hugging the young woman warmly. “It’s so lovely to have you here. Come on in.”
The Stark-Rogers remained in London for another week and while Aurora made sure to spend plenty of time with Ella and her mum, she also spent as much time as possible with Harry. She hung out with Louis quite a lot as well, finding that other than Harry, he was the band member that she got along with the easiest and they were fast becoming great friends. The day before she was scheduled to fly home to New York, she was lying on the sofa in Harry’s house, a movie playing on the flat screen that neither were paying attention to. Her head was cushioned on his lap, a blanket pulled up to her chest despite the crackling fire nearby.
“Don’t be silly,” Aurora replied. “I’m getting so bored around here, it’s nice to have an unexpected visit. Besides, you know I always love seeing you Mark.”
“Just needed a minute away from the noise,” Aurora whispered, finally turning to face him and showing him the silent tears rolling down her cheeks. “It was all just getting a bit much.”
“Yes,” she whispered in reply, her voice shaking, and her right hand moved to his shoulder to steady herself.
Following the New Jersey shows, Aurora and the band travelled down to Massachusetts, and then on to Washington DC, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Missouri and finally Illinois. Along the way Aurora continued heading out exploring whatever city they found themselves in while the boys worked, and she would often find herself sitting in on writing sessions for the next album. Harry would often run lyrics by her, asking for her input and she found that Liam and Louis’ writing style was similar to her own which led to her often joining the two as they threw around ideas. By the time they reached Chicago at the end of August, most of the album had been written, if not recorded in full ready for its November release.
The engineer pouts even more, and rolls his eyes, setting the crystal decanter heavily down onto the counter. It’s late, and the kids are in one of the lounges, binging old holiday specials, and eating honestly worrying amounts of junk food. It’s been just Tony and Steve down in the kitchen, making cookies and chatting for hours. Tony’s had his standard old-fashioned glass less than half full of an expensive Scotch, and he’s bubbly happy, but it’s more from the overwhelming amount of holiday spirit than from anything else. One of the details that Steve remembers from the dossier is that Tony has a history with addiction, so he doesn’t say anything out loud, but he’s truthfully, very proud of him for restraining.
Right! so, I hope you guys liked it! I kept meaning to add in smut, but it just... didn't feel like it ever fit anywhere. I might do an update, that's later on in their relationship? we shall see!
“Overheatin’ to death ain’t gonna prove anything, punk.” Steve’s only recourse is to pout at him, and try to make himself look as small as he can in the oversized hoodie.
“ok. It’s… I guess there’s a solid month left, before you have to deal with me freaking out about it, completely.” Steve looks concerned, but Tony just smiles softly, pressing up on his toes to kiss Steve on the cheek, the only clue he gives, that he’s kidding, before walking out of the room, leaving Steve to turn off the lights, and shut the door.
“no, you don’t understand, he just, /fell/. We had just taken down an invisible kid, and one who could control rocks, and he just… went down, like a lead balloon. He wasn’t hit, he just—” Steve isn’t sure why, but he doesn’t want to hear the end of that sentence. It can’t be that he just went down, something had to have happened, maybe he was hit out of Clint’s line of sight.
“I – I have a friend who’s ran into you when you were, uh, doing mob things,” and it’s not entirely a lie. Jessica did run into Barnes before, though it was planned, a way to divert attention. And Tony orchestrated the switches and the drop-offs from the safehouse with Pepper, led a few of Barnes’ guys right to where Rhodey and the cops lay in wait. Oh, he’s so dead.
he'd saw. The floor was full of writhing bodies, and the strobes were flashing obnoxiously, so no small wonder one guy got lost. Steve growled in quiet frustration. “damnit.”
[I know. I can't...god I can't either Tony. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I Can't go five minutes without wanting you here. Beside me. I'm sorry I messaged you, ok? I guess... I don't know what I was thinking.]
“that’s… I know that’s a lot. I know it is. You probably need… a minute or two. I’m gonna… go get some snacks.” Steve looks up at him, lost as ever, and Ed holds a hand up. “I know your metabolism is fast. You’ve been sitting in that chair for at least six hours, and you haven’t moved a muscle. You need food, even if you don’t want it. Sit. Rest. I’ll be right back.” With that, Ed heads for the door, and the sound of it being shut behind him rings in steve’s head, long after it’s stopped. He takes a deep breath, and hangs his head into his hands, wondering how the hell he’s meant to ‘relax’ with news like that.
The fact that Bucky says ‘go’ not ‘went’ isn't lost on Steve, and it physically hurts, to hear it. He keeps his voice carefully low, and his eyes directed to the floor. “cocaine…” he says carefully, figuring it best to start with the least of these, and work up from there. Buckys already hurt, and the end of this list is going to feel like a personal attack. “... To start with. But that didn't… it worked its way out of my system quicker than I wanted, having to take a second bump pissed me off, so I went to h-heroin.” he sighs and shakes his head, pushing forward because Tony may not care about the next bit but he knows Bucky will want to know. “freebasing, and because I'm a selfish stupid jackass… Mainlining, after that.” The silence is awkward and heavy, and Steve tightens his grip on Bucky's hands, and wills himself not to shake.
Had the guy on the line not identified himself, Tony would have assumed his program had a glitch and decrypted the wrong piece of the phone's system, got him the wrong number, and that he was now speaking to the wrong person. Tony raises an eyebrow to himself, plays about with the security footage to have it glitch and skip as it's recording, cover anything Jessica and Wanda can't do from the ground. He trusts them, he does, but they're both shit at listening to him when he tells them to stick to the blindspots, not be picked up by the cameras if they can help it. Well, it's just more work for him then, isn't it? If he didn't value his life, he would ask Pepper about the possibility of overtime pay.
to purposeful. It’s all designed to make the occupants think ‘everything is alright. You’re not waiting on a loved one to die. Look how cute these hodgepodged together chairs are, would anything bad ever happen in a place as quaint as this?’ it makes Steve sick.
time. it’s not so long ago, that Tony would be here with him, rambling about how he could improve some piece of technology, or the redundancies in his newest iteration of an AI, to prevent it gaining sentience. (it turns out, he could learn a lesson, as much as Steve liked to tease him for being stubborn.) it’s not so long ago, that Steve would have been
He shifts their position slightly, and sets Tony gently down, giving him a moment or two to make sure that he’s steady on his feet, before taking a healthy step back. It’s awful, and his hindbrain screams at him to step back into Tony’s space again, but that isn’t what they need right now. They need to talk.
that traffic is impossible to navigate in New York, that it's all constantly gridlocked traffic, taxis all honking at each other, and joggers running past them like they're standing still. And that's certainly true of rush hour, but this is an off time, and the weather's shit, no one wants to be out in this, so the roads are relatively clear. Steve's able to get to a pretty good speed, something definitely illegal, so they're back at the loft in now time, and his body's already thrumming with excess adrenaline. He parks and pulls the door open for Tony, smiling devilishly. “Fun ride?”
Closest Steve can tell, neither of them are Tony’s biologically, they’re both adopted. Steve had wanted to ask, but it seemed like an awfully personal conversation, and as the bodyguard, it isn’t his place. That doesn’t stop them, however, from starting an interesting argument over captain crunch and cream of wheat.
"Alright? I'm not saying you have to do that. And you can't exactly contact him to break...whatever this is off. Kinda interested to see how he does contact you - no phone number and all." There's a moment, and then,  a soft huff of laughter. "And I don't think he'd love me after that stunt." The gun feels heavy against his waistband, and he kind of wants to go back in time and warn himself not to overreact to such an extent. "I'm surprised he wasn't immediately deterred by the whole 'you're married' thing, I'll give him that."
It’s too soon. It’s too soon, and it’s too much, and they haven’t talked about anything yet, they shouldn’t be doing any of this, but It’s so
There’s a certain amount of comfort to be spoken for repetition. For the simplistic contentment of habit. Even a bad routine, is a routine, just the same, and there’s a certain comfort to the screeching alarm you hate, or the early morning cancer stick you promised your wife you’d quit ‘as soon as this pack is done’. There’s a certain amount of comfort to be spoken for repetition, Clint thinks, as Lucky dives into the bed, pouncing on him, and using his paws to tap at his face. But the comfort of repitition, is kind of what got him here, isn’t it? Dragging his ass out of bed at seven thirty, not because he wants to, but because it’s demanded of him.
He blinks his eyes open in a blind panic, trying to get out of the bed that he’s in, before he has even the vaguest idea of what’s going on. He’s dizzy, and disoriented, symptoms that are consistent with anesthesia, and his stomach lurches, when he realizes that his bump is gone, and that’s nothing, if not a nightmare come true.
“You know,” he says, and he sounds more wrecked than he should this early on, “when I—when I said I want you inside me, I meant, like, five minutes ago.” He doesn’t even bother trying to bite back his next moan. “C’mon, Steve,” he adds, verging on a whine, rolling his hips as if to prove a point, “’m ready. Promise. I
Cint should say no. he really really shoud. But… he hasn’t ever really known how to do that with tony, has he? He sighs heavily. “Fine, yeah. Half an hour, you fuckin’ pillow princess.” the squeal of unrestrained glee from Tony is almost almost enough to justify the hike all the way out to queens.
“look, bud. You think I won’t set the entire city skyline on fire, just to see Stevie smile, you clearly don’t know who I am, and I’ll take every man you have down with me.” Steve smiles fondly, as weak as he thinks he can stand to be in front of Clint, who may still be a threat. He sighs, and puts a thumb over the hammer, holding it back while he squeezes the trigger. He eases it back forward, and he flicks the safety again, setting it back down on the table. He holds his hands up in a placating gesture and nods to Bucky to do the same.
Tony's eyebrows draw together, heart sinking at that. From here on out, he should maybe just ask for people's numbers instead of bypassing security and software to obtain it himself. He wants to ask Steve to meet up, but he knows that Pepper has a mission planned for tonight that she needs the technicians for, and he doesn't exactly trust Malcolm to handle it on his own. Kid's talented, sure, but he's that: a kid. He reactivates the sabotaged security camera once he's sure Jessica and Wanda have passed. There's the slightest flash in the corner of one of the cameras inside the warehouse, undoubtedly from the muzzle of a gun. Still, he knows tonight's mission is mostly recon, gather information about a supposed new gang. Malcolm can probably handle that. So, filtering the security footage, he clears his throat. "Are you free tonight? Say, uh--" He glances at the clock, and it's much later in the day than he thought-- "two hours from now? I really want to see you." Steve feels his mood lift instantly, and all of a sudden, he doesn’t care about having to run downstairs for the adrenaline, or having to drug the guy back awake, or having to finish any of this at all. He can see Tony again. He can see Tony again, tonight. Tonight.
Steve stares for what is probably longer than socially acceptable, but he can’t exactly bring himself to care. Because Ed is from a different world. Ed is from a different world, and Tony’s still unconscious, and it seems to bee too early in the day, to be dealing with that type of nonsense. He sighs heavily. “Ok, so if… if you’re here from a different world… why?”
“I know you left him for dead in an abandoned bunker in Siberia, Steve!” Rhodey bellows, completely demolishing Steve’s attempts to keep the environment as calm as possible. “I know you’re a sorry sack of shit, and I know that you have about three minutes and counting, before JSOC is dragging your ass to the raft where you should have been for the last year.”
“It’s fine. But… it’s not like I don’t know how much you like a sob story, Tony.” he says, eyes taking on a bit of a flinty edge to them. He doesn’t voice it, but a bitter thought comes to mind. ‘Hell, you gave me the time of day, when I was a sob story.’
"'m not gonna yell at you," he says eventually, voice low, warning. He's more afraid that he'll start crying at any given moment, which wouldn't be fair to Steve. He knows that. "It's just..." He breaks off on a sigh, runs a hand through his hair. "A warning would've been nice, Stevie. You know we agreed that...that one-night stands are okay, so long as we at least give each other a head's up. I had to hear it from Nat that you took some little brunette thing home, and that...it hurt."
Tony scrunches his nose up at that, because he's too caught up to put the thought into raising an eyebrow. "Gonna have to tie me down to stop me working, babe," he says, a smirk curving the corner of his lips. On the incredibly slim off-chance that he does wind up pregnant again, Tony knows he's going to need to give into the 'keep you in bed' part of what Steve's saying, because he has a funny feeling that a doctor would recommend excessive bedrest and minimal movement for the sake of the pup, and ensuring that Tony can carry as close to term as he can manage. Working, on the other hand...He could maybe give up Iron Man for nine months. Maybe. But he's still head of R&D at SI, which means a lot of paperwork.
“Fuck you, first of all, Rogers, you’re so wrong, I don’t actually have time to tell you how wrong you are. it was gritty and esoteric and—you just made a movie reference.” Steve slides his hands into the pocket of his (torn, what the hell?) jeans, and shrugs again.
Tony rolls his eyes, though the gesture has an edge of fondness to it that he can feel, so he’s sure Steve’s able to see it. Well, if Steve gets to be sappy, then he does too, he supposes. “You’re ridiculous,” he mutters, grinning like the lovesick idiot he most definitely is. He wishes that Clint was here, or magically knew when Tony was about to make a bad decision, and could just pop up to smack him. Or Logan. Logan’s also good at that kind of thing, though he tends to not get involved with Tony’s personal life.
Steve’s confused, initially, lost on why it sounds so very much like Tony’s trying to apologize for something beyond his control, and then it clicks. he’s talking about the future. A future that they might actually have. The simple revelation is enough to nearly choke him with emotion, and his next breath is ragged. “Tony. I don’t… I don’t care. I don’t care if we never have pups.” He promises softly.
Steve’s exhausted. He’s been crying, for what seems like an eternity. He’s so close to being able to help tony, but further away than he could ever be. He had no idea what to do, so… he cries. He cries, and though he wipes each tear away as it comes, it always seems like there’s another one there to replace it. At some point, he gives up, and just lets it go. A nurse had been in earlier, to switch Tony’s drip bags, and mentioned something about a new medication, something given as a half hopeful treatment to epileptic patients who’ve suffered too many seizures. She’d made it sound like the prognosis was grim, and frankly, that fits how Steve’s feeling.
“I got so used to see you every day,” she admitted, her face pressed into his neck. “I don’t want to say goodbye.”
tour in February with their shows in Australia, and with Zayn shocking them all by leaving the band in March, he was also feeling the stress of the first few months of the year. Following a show in Dubai at the start of April, the band took a two month break to write their next album and in the wake of Zayn’s departure, the boys made the decision to stick together during the writing process and flew to New York to write with Aurora. All four of the guys moved into their own floor of the tower and spent most of their days set up in Aurora’s recording studio, writing and recording demos to send to their team. The time off for the group was much needed and they enjoyed being able to kick back and relax with Aurora’s family while working on the album, something they had not had the opportunity to do for their previous albums given that they had all been written and recorded while on the road for touring. Aurora tried to split her time well between her obligations, setting aside enough time to study, paint for her upcoming gallery show and also working on the writing process with the guys. Harry also enjoyed being able to split his time while staying in the tower; he and the boys would all join Steve in the gym every morning and eating dinner with the entire team every evening. Harry felt comfortable in the tower and after more than a year together, he considered Rori’s home as his own, just as he hoped she felt comfortable in his and he would often roam the common floor while the band took a break, spending time with various members of the Avengers team. While the boys would usually turn in from bed around 11pm every night, Harry would have to pull his girlfriend from her art studio well after midnight every night, forcing her to get some sleep. Finally, a busy month and a half, Aurora sat her final exam for the school year and her paintings were completed and ready for the opening of her show.
“Good thing you’ll never have to find out,” he replied, a soft smile on his face as he lent in to kiss her again. “Happy New Year Rori.”
A few moments later, Ella arrived, her excitement clear from the moment she walked in the room. “Rori!” she shouted, launching herself into her best friends’ arms. “God, I missed you babe!”
Instead of splitting up for Christmas or trying to decide which family they should spend the holidays with, Aurora and Harry decided to invite Harry’s family out to New York so they could all spend Christmas together. Gemma and Robin’s kids all decided to go to their partners families so Anne and Robin were happy to fly out to them.
“As I’ll ever be,” Rori replied. There was a brief pause while the crew finished their final checks on the camera’s and other equipment before signalling for Letterman to begin his introduction.
As had become their tradition, Steve and Tony left Aurora alone for the most of Christmas Eve, only seeking her out later in the evening to watch The Santa Clause and have waffles for dinner. The rest of the team made themselves scarce for the day, allowing her to process the day in her own small way.
“They’ve got a private waiting room set up for you guys,” Happy told him once they reached the correct floor. “It’s the second door on the left up there. I’ll go take your things to the tower and then I’ll check in with Pepper.”
“With all the songs that you’ve written, that other artists are now starting to have success with, why is it that your band have never recorded any of them for yourselves?”
An hour before the show was set to start, the boys’ families started to arrive, coming first backstage to wish them all good luck and then heading out to take their seats in the audience. Aurora hugged each of Louis’ sisters when they arrived, before his mother pulled her aside.
“Well I’m sorry I’m not on a first name basis with Louis Tomlinson or Harry Styles,” Ella replied. “You better start talking right now because you have been holding out on me, I thought you said you’d just been talking with Harry a little since the AMAs but know he’s inviting you to Louis house so you’ve clearly skipped some pertinent details.”
Aurora paused, trying to piece everything together. Harry watched her silently from beside her on the sofa. “Get me dad on the phone, J.” Harry reached out, taking her hand in his and giving a gentle squeeze as the phone rang.
They spent the next few days swimming in the ocean, reading or watching movies in the evenings and revelling in the opportunity to spend time alone together with nowhere to be or no one demanding their attention for one thing or another. On their last evening they were curled up on the porch swing, looking out over the moonlit waves, a blanket thrown over their laps to ward off the cool breeze blowing up off the ocean. Harry had a glass of wine in one hand, his other resting around Aurora’s shoulders as her head lay on his shoulder.
Harry chuckled again, lacing their fingers together and tugging her reluctantly back into the main room. Louis and Liam wolf whistled as the pair re-emerged, causing the blush to return to both of their cheeks. “Yeah alright,” Harry said, “lay off.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Rori agreed. “We’ll have to say something before I join you on tour soon.”
“I think it’s a great idea,” Liam added, Niall nodding along beside him with a giant grin on his face.
Tony and Steve were glad to have Rori home, if only for two days, having missed her while she travelled with the band for the last 2 months and she’d missed them too, of course, happy to be home briefly before continuing on with the tour for another month. That evening they all crowded into the living room in the penthouse with Sam, Bucky and Thor joining the Stark-Rogers family and the band. They watched a movie, Aurora curled up against Tony, his arm wrapped around her shoulder. She fell asleep at some point, waking up when Louis started throwing popcorn at her, causing Niall to laugh hysterically. They didn’t stay up too late, aware of how early they would need to be up the following morning.
Harry had been right that no one was carding the guests at the afterparty and Aurora easily glided into the venue, ordering a coke at the bar before finding a stool by a table over against the wall. She looked out across the dancefloor and the steadily growing crowd, sipping on her drink and starting to question why she had come. She was not a huge fan of parties, never having been the type to get invited to them in high school and although she had attended a couple of events at the Columbia sorority houses since classes had begun two months earlier, she hadn’t really enjoyed them. She didn’t drink and had never really been great at making friends easily even before she had to worry that people were only being friendly because of her parents. Before she could convince herself that it had been a mistake coming out, she spotted the One Direction boys arrive. She stayed on her stool for another 20 or so minutes before Harry spotted her through the crowd and made his way over to her side.
“I think we’ve got some free time around the Ohio shows, Mark,” Harry butted in. “I’ll send you the tour schedule to see if you can fit something in.”
“It was so personal,” Rori admitted. “I knew I could never let anyone else sing it and before Dad’s wedding I’d never sung any of my original songs myself. I’d only ever done covers and I think I was just a bit scared of it. But then once I decided to sing,
Rori chewed on her bottom lip for a moment before quickly unlocking her phone and copying out the phone number at the bottom of the flyer.
“I’m fine,” Rori assured him. “Although I feel bad about the rest of the fans that caught up in it all though. It was kind of stupid, now that I think about it.”
It was Harry’s turn to blush as Aurora burst out laughing. “Hey Lou, can you do me a favour and fuck off please?” Harry asked. Louis joined Aurora in her laughter, stumbling a little in his drunken state as he stepped forward to place his hand on her shoulder.
“I’ve been walking to school on my own for years,” Aurora argued as she stood in front of Steve and Tony in the living room.
Louis grinned excitedly and held out his hand for Auroras. She laced their fingers together and they walked out onto the stage together, the sound of the crowd overwhelming loud. They both joined Liam and Niall who had already taken their seats behind the mic stands and Harry skipped his way back towards them all. “My wonderful girlfriend, Aurora Stark!” he yelled, winking at Rori as he took his seat next to her in the middle of the 5 of them. “This one’s called
“Jar of Flies. 3 Outlaws. Left Turn. Something Strange. Toxic Nebula.” Each suggestion was quickly refuted, and Xav barely paused after each no before firing off his next thought.
“You’re right,” her father agreed. “I’ve been working on fixing his prosthetic lately. The one Hydra made for him was a mess. They clearly didn’t care whether it was causing him any pain, so hopefully I can ease that for him with some modifications.”
Following the show, everyone headed back to the green room and drinks were flowing as they all just hung out. After a while, Steve decided to leave the kids to have their fun and made his way across the room to where Rori was sitting on Harry’s lap happily chatting with Louis while Harry was talking with a member of the crew.
It had been 5 weeks since Aurora had moved into Stark Tower and while the three of them had quickly adjusted to living together, today was a disruption to the easy going atmosphere that usually settled over the penthouse.
Harry’s smile grew bigger somehow in response, before leaving to find the rest of his band in the crowd and Aurora went in search of her dads.
“There you are,” he cheered as he stumbled over to her and she could tell that while he wasn’t completely trashed yet, he was well on his way to drunk and she laughed when he fell onto her lap as he attempted to sit next to her. “Sorry love,” he drawled, sliding sideways, his leg still hoked over hers as he sat beside her, his arms wrapping around her waist, “The boats a bit rocky and I don’t think I’ve got my sea legs yet.”
“I grew up in south London and the reason the world didn’t know about me is because for most of my life I’ve been no one,” Rori began, chuckling nervously before continuing. “I lived with my mum until I was 15 and I didn’t know that Tony Stark was my dad and he didn’t know I existed until I was 16 and I moved to New York.”
was always an emotional day. They headed back to the tower after lunch, stopping at Aurora’s favourite bakery along the way to pick up donuts for everyone and an apricot Danish for Rori.
“I don’t know,” Rori shrugged. “I’m still the new kid and trying to find my feet. I mean it’s hasn’t even been two months and I haven’t really made many friends yet or anything.”
The car dropped them off at one of the many docks along the Thames and they made their way down towards the medium sized boat waiting at the waters edge. The party onboard was already in full swing by the time the pair made it aboard and Rori found herself recognising most of the faces in the crowd, despite having never meeting most of them before. There were other singers, song-writers, producers and other behind the scenes members of the British music scene. Harry soon had a glass in his hand as they pushed through the crowd on the back deck, looking for their friends. Eventually they spotted Louis and Liam towards the back of the boat and exchanged hugs.
“Me too, but I feel guilty too,” she admitted. “Why did I survive? What made me more worthy than anyone else that day?”
“He was brainwashed by Hydra but he’s breaking out of it,” Steve replied, “and besides I’ve got your dad for backup this time.”
“Yeah,” she nodded, “Maybe a month or two after we started the band, we’d decided we were just going to cover songs we liked, but I was also writing a whole heap at the time and Dad helped me get an agent and I started licensing them out and some big names started picking them up and recording them.”
“Not really,” she sighed. “Sam has me working on this one step at a time thing, so I’m not really looking too far ahead at this point.”
“Get away from her,” Tony warned, his voice low and terrifying as he trained the suits weapons on the man in front of her. Aurora scrambled to her feet, throwing her hands out in a peaceful gesture.
“You did,” she promised. “You got be somewhere quiet and got Sam. Couldn’t have done any better.” She sat up a little to kiss his cheek.
“How’s everyone doing tonight?” Harry asked, causing the crowd to roar in response. Harry chuckled before continuing, trying to soak up the feeling of being in front of such a large crowd, knowing it would be a while before he’d get to do this again. “Well I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for spending your Tuesday night with us, and for being so incredibly supportive of everything we’ve done over the last 5 years. I know we were all meant to be here last month, and I just wanted to take a minute to thank each and every one of you for be so understanding and letting me drop everything to fly to New York. I love you all. The lads and I were talking last night, and we thought you deserved something special to say thank you, so we thought we’d add in an extra song tonight off the new album that’s out tomorrow.” Harry had to pause his speech as the crowd screamed with excitement, having already noted the extra mic stand and stool behind him they were anticipating his next words. “We’re gonna need some extra help with it though so I want you to give a warm welcome to our special guest.”
“I’m sorry,” Rori mumbled as she attempted to wipe her face clear. “I don’t know where that came from.”
“I think he’s just trying not to overwhelm you… or himself,” Steve replied. “He doesn’t want to come on too strong and have you run away.”
“May,” Harry replied. “First shows in Dublin on the 23rd and then it’s pretty much non-stop until we reach the States at the start of October. Think we’ve got a week off in June before we start the European leg.”
“God, I love you,” Aurora replied, kissing Tony’s cheek and returning her head to lean against his chest, her cheek resting beside the Arc reactor again.
Rori rolled her eyes at her friend. “Do you want a cuddle too, Lou?” she joked, letting go of Harry to walk towards Louis with her arms spread wide.
Should this have been 2 chapters? Probably. Was I having way too much fun introducing these 2 awkward ducklings to each other? Absolutely.
“Holy shit,” Rori said. “Holy shit. Holy fucking shit Mark!” She placed the call on to speaker, opening up twitter and scrolling through her mentions until she found the one she was looking for.
Aurora walked off the stage after the sound check to find Steve glowering at the side of stage. “You ok Pops?” she asked.
“Tony?” Pepper asked softly as she took a seat beside him on the sofa. “There’s something I need to talk to you about.”
“Now that you've finally,” Gary began, Aurora joining him on the second half of the line, “lost what you thought that you needed, never would have treated your heart, like you did. What goes around comes back around.”
“Good thing you’ll never have to find out,” she replied, smiling warmly up at the man she loved before kissing him. “When are you going to announce it?” she asked softly when they pulled apart.
“I thought I recognized that laugh!” Louis shouted, jogging down the hallway towards the couple, wrapping his arms around Aurora’s waist and lifting her into the air. She laughed as he spun them around. “Missed you love.”
The flight was the longest 8 hours of Harry’s life. He’d tried to call both Tony and Steve before he boarded the plane, but when neither answered he’d opened up the JARVIS app that Tony has installed on his phone when he last visited the tower. He informed JARVIS of his flight details and asked the AI to let both of Aurora’s parents know that he was on his away and then he turned his phone to airplane mode and ran his hand over his face, exhausted but unable to sleep. By the time he reached JFK, Harry was unsure how he was still on his feet. He was beyond tired and scared to the point of being sick as he walked through the terminal, his duffle bag hanging from his shoulder, grateful that there weren’t any fans to stop him for a photo. He recognised Happy once he made it to the curb and slipped into the backseat of the town car, closing his eyes as he lent his head back against the seat for the brief moment it took Happy to round the car and climb into the driver’s seat.
Aurora finished up at Columbia a few days before Christmas and after many hugs’ goodbye to her fathers, she boarded a flight to Manchester to spend the Christmas break with Harry and his family. Since she wouldn’t be home, Tony and Steve had chosen to also take a trip for the holidays and were spending Christmas in Malibu, so without access to the jet, she was on a commercial flight and it was long. She spent the hours with her sketchbook spread open on the table in front of her seat, a coloured pencil behind each ear and another between her teeth as she worked. When the flight finally landed, Rori collected her things, throwing everything into her oversized handbag and slinging it over her shoulder before pulling her carry on out of the overhead bin. Once she made it through the arrival’s terminal, she began scanning the hall. She spotted Harry standing towards the back of the small crowd. He had his Green Bay Packers beanie pulled low, his curls poking out from underneath it, dark sunglasses covering his eyes and a heavy winter coat slung over his arm. His smile stretched across his face when he finally noticed Rori making her way towards him, his dimples popping in his cheeks.
“It’s nice,” Tony said. “Did you draw it up yourself?” Aurora nodded that she had, tracing her index finger over the ink, smiling at the memory of sitting in the tattoo studio with the two boys, Louis laughing at her as she winced when some of the heavy shading was done.

“Thank you,” she gasped, trying not to cry again. “God damn it. I feel like all I ever do these days is cry.”
“Harry get away alright?” he asked to which Rori nodded, her face still pressed into the fabric below her. “You wanna watch a shitty movie and eat crap food that will make Steve disappointed in both of us?”
The first thing that Rori noticed when she entered the penthouse at the beginning of August was the size, the place was gigantic, and she couldn’t help but compare it to the tiny apartment she had shared with her mother. The walk in closets in this place were probably bigger than their entire apartment combined. The second thing she noticed was the view of Central Park through the windows. Having never been to America before, she had only ever seen New York in movies, and she was itching to go out and explore her new home. The third and final thing that she saw, and what stole her attention away from everything else in the room, was the glossy, black grand piano sitting by the wide floor to ceiling windows. Tony noticed her staring at the instrument from where he was standing behind her, and he smiled sadly thinking of how it had gone mostly unplayed for so many years.
In the end, neither Steve nor Aurora had the chance to tell Tony about her going on stage before he saw it plastered across the internet. After a couple of fans tweeted about it, every gossip site or trashy news paper like the Daily Mail was running with the story. The boys were busy all day with multiple radio interviews for the release day of
“What passed through your thoughts when the portal closed and all the Chitauri were dead?” David asked.
When they arrived at the arena that evening, they were escorted backstage and found the boys in the green room. Harry was quickly at her side as soon as they entered, his dimples flashing. “How was the rest of your afternoon, love?” he murmured in her ear, wrapping his arms tightly around her torso.
Tony eased himself off of the bed and made his way down the hall towards the kitchen, startled to find Sam sitting at the island bench with a mug of coffee in front of him. “Just made a fresh pot,” he said, gesturing the coffee machine nearby.
“It could be fun?” she replied, her voice lifting at the end as if in question, hesitant to seem like she was inserting herself into a moment that should be theirs.
“I don’t want you to go either,” he replied. “But I’ve got 3 more months before tour prep starts, so I’ll fly out to see you a couple times and then you can come spend summer with me. It’ll be great.”
“Do you feel comfortable talking about what happened to her?” David asked gently. “How is it that you finally met your father and moved here to New York?”
at the wedding and we decided to end the band, Mark and I started talking about what was next for me and I played it and a couple of other songs for him. The second he heard it he was so sure it had to be my debut and I trust his opinion, so I just had to go for it.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” JARVIS said, “But Mr Styles will need to leave now if he does not wish to miss his flight.”
The following night Aurora watched the boys from the side of stage and once they left the stadium, she spent the evening wrapped up in Harry’s arms back at the hotel.
. His eyes kept returning to hers as the song continued and every time he saw her singing back at him, his smile grew impossibly bigger. At the end of the song they once again locked eyes and he mouthed the words
As soon as Louis ended their hug, Aurora found Harry’s arm instantly around her waist and it remained there for most of the next 3 hours until the boys took to the stage. Aurora watched from side of stage, a huge grin on her face for the entire show, secure in the fact that she had made the right decision to be there as she watched Harry smiling and dancing across the stage. Gone was the haunting look from his face that had been present in every fan video from the previous shows and back was the man who loved performing more than anything else in the world.
“Just feels weird, doesn’t it?” Rori whispered, her eyes also glancing to the others, not wanting to upset anyone. “I still don’t really understand what happened and it just doesn’t really feel right that he’s not here.”
“I’m gonna go back to the hotel bug,” Steve said after gaining his daughters attention. “Don’t stay up too late and if Dad asks, I never let you out of my sight.”
“I painted the proposal,” Rori explained. “Steve down on one knee in the rooftop garden at the top of Avengers Tower, and then I posted the video of painting it which slowly revealed their faces. At the end of the video they both appeared on the screen and announced that they were engaged and very happy together.”
“fuck” he whispers quietly, keeping his mouth turned away from the receiver. There’s a huge mission tonight, Bucky’s been talking about it for weeks. Intel thinks they’ve narrowed the bad drugs down to a few solid candidates, and Bucky and Sam think there’s a pretty good chance of striking a few of those names off of the list, if they can get a look at this warehouse. He really needs to be there, especially since the new gang has been marking their bad shit with an emblazoned, stylized red star, meaning to take Steve and Bucky down, by making clients assume they’re the ones producing this shit. It’s crude, but it’s effective, turns out junkies aren’t that reliable. Steve really needs to be there… but… this is Tony. He closes his eyes, against the horrible decision he’s about to make, and nods, to steel himself.
Eventually, they have to go back, to New York and to Wakanda, and that last day is terrible, because they both shower with medical grade scent neutralizing soap, and they have to spend the last few hours they get, not touching. Steve mopes, and Tony tears up when he doesn’t think Steve can see.
Tony whines, low and in the back of his throat, and tightens his hold on Steve before he can even attempt to move them anywhere. “’m quite comfortable here, thanks,” he mutters, though he can’t deny that the cold seeping into his bones is substantially more noticeable now that he’s in from outside. There are a million things running through his mind: he wants to ask how Steve’s doing, wants to ask about Bucky and if he’s chilled out since the last time Tony encountered him, wants to figure out where the hell their relationship’s headed. He can’t decide which he needs to voice first. In the end, he concedes about needing to move upstairs to recover some body heat, allows Steve to lead the way.
“Yeah, right, sure.” he says, sardonically. “Pull the other one.” the other kid looks more serious though, sets his jaw, and lets something fierce flash through his eyes.
Tony makes a face, somewhere between panic and his usual ‘What the fuck am I supposed to do?’ expression, and grabs the wastebasket from where somebody’s left it on top of the dresser. Why somebody left it on top of the dresser is beyond him, but he figures that now isn’t the best time to inquire about that, and puts the basket underneath where Bucky’s currently dry-heaving, so at least nothing’ll get on the floor if he throws up. It’s probably not important in the grand scheme of things, but Tony’s had to clean up after more than one life-or-death event, and it doesn’t exactly help you move on. He faintly hears the sound of the ambulance in the distance as the dispatcher tells him there’s been a slight delay, unexpected roadworks, and that it’ll take another minute and a half to reroute. Tony’s very close to calling Happy and having him take them to the hospital instead—the man has no regard for the law and will break every speed limit he needs to if it means Bucky doesn’t die. Feeling a little useless just listening to the dispatcher telling him to remain calm, he turns to Steve instead, “What’re we supposed to do? Another minute to wait, I’d say three minutes to the hospital itself if we’re lucky, six if we’re not. Is that—Can we afford to wait that long?”
It's loud, sweaty, and obnoxious in this club. Everyone here is vapid and airheaded, but Steve has appearances to make, so he smiles, and nods, and schmoozes, and sells a few dimebags, while he's at it. The drugs are good, this newest batch allowing for a softer body high, letting the mind wander. Steve would be partial to it himself, if he wasn't so carefully opposed to partaking of the product. Bucky did, and that was fine and well for him, but Steve had watched his lover complete one too many 12 step programs for comfort. The game isn’t exactly what it was six months ago either. there’d been a sudden dump of new drugs into the area, that no one could track back to a specific gang which meant more time in the lab for Bucky, trying to fine hone their competitive edge, and unpredictable side effects from anything that wasn’t theirs, signed and certified. It also meant more time for Steve, spent just like this, hawking their product where he could, and taking note of anyone who used to buy, turning up their noses. The blond slumps and takes another hit off of his pipe before staring back out over the floor, idly wondering where Bucky was.
"Not many," he eventually concedes, before adding a, "Hardly ever, actually. You cried while you were having sex with him?" his voice is light, teasing, and he raises his eyebrows in open, if loving mockery. The information about the GSW is more than a little troubling, and Bucky makes a mental note to ask Frank to poke around in Tony Stark's background, figure out what he could have gone through that would have resulted in that. As far as he knows, the media probably would've gone crazy if Howard Stark's kid got himself shot in something scandalous, or was attacked, and there's no way the kid ever went to war. He doesn't say anything about it being suspicious to Steve, because there's no need to worry or offend him before Bucky has anything concrete on the guy. And he's not trying to keep Steve from Tony. He's not. He's watched him go through hell and back with how poorly he was as a kid, and he'll be damned if any more harm befalls Steve if there's something he could do to prevent it.
“I… I’m sorry, Cap. He’s… got a higher clearance than you, with the override code.” Steve whines softly, starting to realize that this might not go the way he needs it to.
Tony manages to hold back the noise he wants to let out at that, instead settling on a smile before he leans forward to kiss Steve again, only breaking off when he knows the need for oxygen is becoming too urgent.
Tony rolls his eyes, and kicks a piece of paper on the floor of his dining room-turned-workshop, cutting his eyes over to his computer, and definitely absolutely not pouting. He’s an adult. He would never. “It’s not nice to gloat, darling.” he doesn’t mean for the term of endearment to slip out. It just… does. He isn’t even really aware of it, until Clints answering comment makes him consider the word choice.
“I believe you, honey,” Tony says, tilting his head ever so slightly so that he can give Steve a soft kiss. If there’s ever been a point where Tony was most motivated to create a time machine, it would be now. He just wants to go back and tell his past self to just get Steve’s number. Would’ve been a whole lot easier to avoid this if he had been there to prevent it. “You didn’t hurt me intentionally, and I know you wouldn’t hurt Bucky intentionally, and he’ll come back, and he’ll forgive you.” Tony takes a breath, pulls back and stands up from where he was kneeling on the floor, taking Steve’s hands in his as he does. “C’mon. You’re not…We’re not having any talks about us while you’re like this—we need to get you into bed, and you need to get some rest.”
Bucky is fine. He's tired, and he's nodding off, but he feels good. Great. Better than yesterday for /fucking/ sure. He stumbles up the stairs, and he falls into the doorway on the way in, but it's hysterical that a guy as quiet as him can't manage to keep his footing about him, and he has to stifle quiet Snickers, as he unlocks the door. No one's in the living room, so he moves to the bedroom. He's gonna be pissed if they're fucking. They didn't talk about this. Why didn't they talk about this? He can't remember. He's...so tired. He trips over a pile of something in the doorway, clothes it looks like, but Tony and Steve are asleep under the covers, and very clearly /not/ fucking so that's. That's good. Small favors. Bucky steps closer slightly and notices that Tony's stirring. “Good morning, sunshine!” He stage whispers loudly.
Steve's holding back tears, but he manages to make himself read the message over and over again, committing every single word to memory. He knows it isn't true, he knows Tony's hurt and lashing out, with good reason, but it doesn't make him feel any less scum for it.
Tony’s in the middle of tugging his shirt off over his head when the phone goes off where he’s set it on the counter. He tries to maintain his breathing, level and easy, as he lets his fingers trace over the scar beneath his stomach. He hates the fact that they’d needed to open him up to repair damage to the walls of his uterus and stop the risk of him bleeding out, because it’s left him with a scar that looks similar enough to the ones omegas are left with if they choose to have a c-section, and that…that hurts too much to think about. How he should have Steve here, with him, and they should have a baby in a cot by their bed, and instead he has neither.
“God no. My brains already half melted, is that really what you want to do with my remaining thought processes?” His cock is thickening with interest, and a small smile plays on his lips as he rolls his hips up. Tony's gotta still be sore, they were
“Don’ worry about it right now. There’s a lotta red tape, and bureaucracy, but basically, Steve told T’challa you were pregnant, and he sent us both right back. We’re political asylees with the nation of Wakanda, so there’s not a lot they can do to us right now.  Rhodey realized you were in labor, brought you here. When me ‘n Stevie showed up, he went to go talk to Ross, see if there’s something he can do for the rest of the rogues.” Tony nods, slowly, while he processes it all. He still has more questions (doesn’t think anyone couldn’t, after all of that.) but… they can wait for now.
fucking easy to take a step forward, press Tony’s back up against the doorframe, and mouth eagerly at his swollen scent glands. His scent explodes in Steves mouth, bitter and sweet, cloying, like treacle.
much less this time. Steve moans loudly as he sinks to he hilt in Tony, and his fingers squeeze desperately at his hips, harshly looking for an anchor. It’s only a few seconds, before Steve is pounding into Tony, each thrust a punishment, every one angled perfectly over the sensitive lump of nerves that is his prostate. Steve growls lowly, at the muffled sounds Tony’s mewling into his ear.
He sighs softly, his heart pounding in his head, and takes a deep breath, letting the words spill out before he can stop them. “I was in love with you from the first time we slept together.” He swallows thickly and his eyes flick back and forth between Tony's, like he's studying any part of him for rejection. It's… A lot, he knows that, but waking up a John Doe in the hospital scared the shit out of him. Even if it terrifies Tony, he wants him to know their time was special to him. Precious.
This time, Steve doesn’t manage to keep the laugh back, and Tony looks at him, from over the top of his coffee cup. Steve isn’t sure what he’s expecting to see reflected in those chestnut brown eyes, but it isn’t the animation and sparkle of amusement, and intrigue. Steve’s chest clenches up in something resembling nerves, for the first time in 67 years.
That unhappiness gets that much worse when he sees that fucking archer skulking around. They're not in no man's land this time, they're in Red Star territory, and him being here is enough for an act of war, depending on what the fuck he's up to in the shadows. Bucky growls lowly, and signals Frank to come in, watch his post while he figures out what that squirrelly bastard is doing here.
“Hey,” Tony says, keeping his voice quiet. “Don’t worry, I was just getting a glass of water for our late-night visitor over there.” He nods in Bucky’s direction, doesn’t really look over at him before he leans down to press a kiss to Steve’s forehead. It’s only when he pulls back that he actually looks over to Bucky, and he’s seen Jess when she’s high enough to notice immediately that something’s off. “Bucky?” he asks, leans over Steve to poke Bucky’s arm. When that doesn’t get so much as a mumble, he raises an open palm over Bucky’s mouth and nose, feels the slightest hint of air ghost over his skin, and it means he’s still breathing at least. “Steve, get his—get his head back. I think he’s—/shit/—I think he’s overdosing.” Tony grabs his jeans from where they’re lying in the doorway, takes out his phone and dials 911. Even if this isn’t an overdose and is just a false alarm, he’s still going to be insistent that Bucky gets checked out by a doctor.
“You’ll still be with S.H.I.E.L.D., the high value target we have you assigned to is of strategic importance to our organization, as well as the department of defense.” Her voice is soft and warm, but there’s a certain ‘no nonsense’ tone to her words too, and the memory of Peggy thrums that much stronger.
"When you're strange, faces come out of the rain, when you're strange, no one remembers your name, when you're strange."
Tony huffs out a chuckle at that, rolling over so that he's lying on his back, giving himself a chance to get his bearings, maybe try to talk himself out of falling for a stranger after one night. See, this is where Clint usually comes in handy - always knows how to talk people out of making dangerous, foolish decisions, all the while making worse ones himself. Or even Karen. Karen would give him one of her looks, and Tony would see the logical side to this, that there's no way he's falling for a guy after one night. It's not...It shouldn't be possible.
"I love you too," he says, voice barely above a whisper. He doesnt need to wonder if Steve's heard it though, enhanced hearing and all that. "I wasn't --" He cuts himself off, changes his mind, and settles on repeating his quiet, "I love you." Because it's enough. It says everything.
about project rebirth. He wants to take another look at his memories, comb through them again, but he
“Last night was…” He trails off, because ‘fun’ doesn’t even begin to cover how he feels about what went down, about how Steve made him feel. After a beat, he settles for a, “Something else.” And it’s no better than ‘fun’, not really, and he’s aware he’s dragging this out, making it more painful for himself than it needs to be, but he can’t help himself.
He hears the mug shatter on the tile floor, before he realizes that it’s slipped out of his hand. “STEVE!”
“Get the fuck away from him.” The beta bites out, in no uncertain terms. Steve hates the pure disgust that he sees in Rhodey’s eyes. He hates the way his jaw and neck clench, already preparing himself to fight the alpha that caused this, whether it’s actually the truth, or not. Steve whines lowly, and shifts his weight, so he’s more in front of Tony. his breathing is still ragged and shallow, but it’s starting to even out. Steve had been so fucking close to having him out of the woods.
Tony shuts and locks the door behind himself, leaving the key in the lock to make it clear that this isn't any kind of trap and that Steve can walk out whenever he wants to. If Tony hopes that he doesn't want to, well, Steve doesn't need to know that. He runs a hand through his hair, a self-conscious little thing because he hasn't had his hair this long since Afghanistan for very good trauma-related reasons, and is halfway through trailing across the room after Steve -- he's not paying attention enough to realize it's happening -- when he comes back to himself and stop by the couch. There's maybe twenty feet between them, and it's entirely too much.
He takes a few steps away from the bath so that the sound of running water doesn’t overpower the sound of his voice through the line. At least it covers the way his heart’s pounding against his ribs in his chest. “I miss you, and I haven’t been able to get a single night of solid sleep since”—/since they sedated me at the hospital because I woke up in hysterics after the surgery and nothing could calm me down, not even Rhodey—“you left. I haven’t been eating, and the bots have to keep reminding me to fucking shower, and—and¬—” He cuts himself off, runs a hand through his hair and notes, absently, that it’s getting too long. But like hell is he going to let anyone go near his head with scissors—they can be made into a weapon too easily. “I miss you,” he repeats, the words far softer and too near a whine for his own liking.
“Multiple years. That’s… that’s what the chip he has says. I don’t… I’m not exactly sure how long. We never really… talked about it.” and maybe they should have. Maybe Steve should have taken more of an interest in Tony’s recovery. That’s something that’s important isn’t it? Hasn’t he read that hiding recovery leads to looking at it as less important? He shakes his head softly, to free his head of the intrusive thoughts. It’s not like he can do anything about the past now anyway. Famike nods, and writes something down.
Logically, in the back of his head, Tony knows he has to shut this down, that he and Steve can't sleep together, and they definitely can't spend an entire cycle together. He told Rhodey he'd be gone for two weeks, but spending almost a week in heat and then a week generally with Steve (if he can stay that long) is only going to mean Tony's returning home smelling like him.
The seventeenth time that Tony manages to nearly take himself out, he’s trying to wire an arm to work with the repulsor tech that weaponizes the Iron Man suit, and enables it to flight. Steve knows that Tony is the one who created the suit, but what he doesn’t know, is who pilots it. It’s got to be someone enhanced, as close as he can tell, because surely no mere mortal man could handle being shaken around inside a tin can, or a gold titanium alloy can, as the case may be.
“William?” the woman that speaks is gorgeous, standing at the other end of the hall, wrapped head to toe in a red dress, strappy at he shoulders and back, and dripping in crystals, so much so, that as she steps forward, there’s the faintest of tinkling sounds. Her hair’s swept elegantly up into an elegant bun at the back of her head, and pinned with a large red rose, perfectly color matched to her dress. Tony smiles softly.
- of all, you. I'm glad you're... Alive.] he doesn't say ok, because he's pretty damn positive that Tony isn't any semblance of that word. He knows for an honest to god fact, that he isn’t.
Steve smiles softly, and presses a soft kiss to Tony’s lips. He’s hesitant, he can tell, and that hurts, probably more than it has any logical right to. It’s not like this was meant to be any type of relationship, Tony has a life and responsibilities, and friends to get back to. It isn’t personal. No matter how much it feels like it is. “fine, then, lunch. We can compromise. I’m easy.” He can’t help but to pull tony closer, and kiss him again. “just as soon as I’m done kissing you.”
The girl gasps again, and manages to take a step back, looking with panicked eyes, from Tony, to the operating theatre, and back again. Tony’s just starting to ask what’s the matter, if she knows the person in OR, or if she has any damn clue about anything, when she looks up at him with a soft smile.
Steve hesitates to say that he was suicidal, coming out of the ice. He never had a plan or a note. Hell, there wouldn’tve been anyone around to read it, but the S.H.I.E.L.D lackeys that treated him like something under a microscope slide anyway. He’s not even sure if he could have killed himself, but the thought had occurred more than once. And then there was Tony Stark. Loud, brash, over the top Tony Stark, that crashed into Steve’s life violently enough, that it rearranged every single thing about it. The proverbial ‘big bang’ that got him out of his own misery. The first light in a long, long era of darkness. Tony always led him back home, from every single rough mission, every sleepless night, every time he felt out of place and unwanted in this century… Tony was always there, giving him his bearings, no matter how lost he was. His own personal North star.
“thank you for your service, ma’am.” Something weird flicks across her face, something brief and quick, but painful, nonetheless. It takes Tony’s brain a second or two to catch up, but when it does, he whines softly, involuntarily.
"Can you -- uh -- Do you mind napping with me?" he asks, and he already knows the answer, but he needs to check anyway. Because things have changed between himself and Steve, and if Steve's already a day or so into rut, then the rest isn't going to be as peaceful for him as it will be for Tony. "There are enough bedrooms upstairs for us to do that up there, or we could stay down here, so you have the TV in case you can't sleep."
Betrayal. Betrayal is the first thing he feels. If ‘archer’ here is the Hunt, and he knows Tony, knows him enough to be calling someone about him being in danger… that’s gotta mean he’s the Hunt too. Which makes him the enemy. Bucky is seething. He pulls back into the shadows, and skirts the edges of the building ‘archer’ is hiding by. He can go over one block, come up behind the gallery, use the maintenance door to get upstairs to the apartment, and warn Steve that he’s sleeping with a snake, without being seen. If he’s quick, hopefully he can do it before more reinforcements show up.
"Makes you feel any better, you're very distracting too," he says, leaning down to kiss Steve's jawline. "Somehow wandered into my dreams. Definitely distracting." He's not going to get into any detail about what the dream was about, because it definitely didn't have anything to do with their earlier activities, instead a whole lot softer with a whole lot of wishful thinking. He's not going to lie to himself about how quickly he's becoming attached, knows it's probably foolish and potentially dangerous, but that doesn't mean he's going to tell Steve the truth. They set out for a one-night stand, and Tony knows that's what they're going to end as. They have an expiration date, and it's the morning. "So," he says, words careful, "what fun things were you thinking about?"
Clint’s never been a fan of Red Star. He can forgive a man a whole lot, for love, or for fortune, but Barnes and Rogers have built a fucking empire on blood. Not to mention, the whole ‘Red Star’ name is a little overdone. Yeah, it’s a petty complaint, but who the fuck names their gang after the neighborhood they got fucking married in? Even at that, Red Hook isn’t the crime capital of the world. It’s rough, sure, but it isn’t exactly Bushwick. Hell, there are hipsters and artists there, just like everywhere else. Then again… who the hell is he to talk, he lives in Bed-Stuy. For christs sake he owns a fucking brownstone. Point stands, he thinks bitterly to himself, it’s a stupid name.
As much as he doesn’t trust himself to do it, still afraid that these hands are the ones that took their pup form them, he rests both hands on the curve of Tony’s jawline, applying gentle pressure, until he looks up. “I love you. ‘ve always loved you. You’re my family ok, and you’re… everything I’ve ever needed.”
As soon as tiny mentions somewhere more private, Steve's brain kicks into overdrive. He’s insanely lucky that any of this worked out, didn’t end up with a drink in his face, or insults lobbied his way. He takes a half a second of personal time to marvel at the gods smiling on him, and then every non necessary brain function is quickly diverted to trying to figure out where they can go. There's the office but Bucky and Sam are in there running numbers, and that's not exactly romantic. There's the vip lounge, but it's closed off and unlocking it with the key he has is
Steve can't keep back the tears then, even though he's biting his lower lip hard enough that it's definitely bleeding. The sound of the loft door shutting is enough to crumple him, and he drops his face into his hands, muffling a curse, and a shout. When he finally looks up, his face is tear-stained and red. “Can… do you hate me?” It seems like such a pathetically stupid question, but Bucky's gone, and apparently he took the rest of Steve's strength with him. Nothing is certain now.
Steve yawns widely, and scrubs his face in the pillow. He’s not really awake, not yet, it always takes him forever and a day to properly come to consciousness. He smiles lightly at Tony and blinks his blue eyes open, slowly. “you’re still here. Thought it was a dream. Shoulda known my imagination wasn’t good enough to conjure something as beautiful as you up.” His words are too sweet, he knows that. He knows he’s being too poetic for a one-night stand, but… hell, they’ve made it this far, the axe is about to fall on this… whatever it is that they have, so what’s the harm in being a little overly sweet?
“You don’t know that, the doctors haven’t seen him yet. It’s—” Second Tony scoffs, and stands up in an instant, stepping close to Steve, open challenge written all across his face. A face that’s warmly familiar, and startlingly different, all at once
“Red Star.” It’s breathless, and it’s disbelieving, and he’s going to tell himself that there isn’t a layer of betrayal in there as well. If Steve’s married to James Buchanan Barnes of Red Star, that means Tony’s just slept with the enemy without even knowing it. They don’t know who he is, of course, no way that they could, but he’s terrified nonetheless. "You know what," he says in a more audible tone, grabbing the sheet so he doesn't expose himself to Barnes and standing up to go retrieve his clothes, moving quickly. "I'm gonna---I'm gonna go, and we can all pretend that this never happened."
him, than anyone else besides Bucky. Normally, he keeps things professional lets people see 'the Captain’ not Steve. He sighs quietly, and rolls to lay on his side, reaching over and pulling Tiny into a loose hold. He's adamant that its not a cuddle, just a way to conserve body heat. “You ok? Went kinda...went kinda rough. You need anything? Advil, shower?”
Tony takes a few seconds to run through everything that could go wrong if he decides they should go back to his place: There’s the gun taped to the back of the bedside table in case anyone tries to break in, he doubts they’d be moving the bedside table for any reason, but it’s still a risk; there’s the ever-present threat of Rhodey dropping by to check in on him because apparently relapsing into old habits means constant supervision; and he’s pretty sure that he left half his computers on before he left the warehouse – not to mention that he co-habits the place with Logan because rent isn’t exactly cheap (can’t use your father’s credit cards when you’re trying to live off the grid, apparently), and he has no idea where the guy plans on being tonight. Sure, the warehouse puts enough space between them that they never really cross paths aside from in the designated communal areas, but he doesn’t want to risk it. “Your place,” he says after a second, looking over to the bar again to ensure that Clint’s attention is still on Karen. Both of them are gone, but he has more important things to worry about. So, he grabs Steve’s hand and tugs him through the crowd, towards the exit, only stopping once they’re outside and he can breathe without the fog machines they have at the side of the floor suffocating him. He turns to look up at Steve, raises an eyebrow. “Live far from here?”
“None of that,” Anne chided. “You both deserve to be happy and I’m just so glad you have each other. Couldn’t have asked for a better daughter-in-law.”
Eventually everyone started to yawn, and the night wound its way to its conclusion with cars called and everyone hugging each other goodbye. Harry walked with Aurora to the front door, waiting with her until her car arrived to take her back into the city. He held open the door for her as she climbed in and then surprised her by joining her on the backseat.
“I’ll call you when I land,” Harry said, pecking her lips one last time before stepping into the waiting elevator car. As the doors slid closed, she stared at them for a few long minutes before turning towards the living room and throwing herself onto the sofa, her face buried into the cushions. Tony found her there half an hour later and sat down next to her hip, rubbing a handing down her back.
The pain was excruciating, beyond explanation as blood ran down her arm, pooling on the ground. A second wound blossomed across her lower abdomen, quickly soaking through her pale grey sweater. More gun shots continued to ring out as Aurora’s vision became hazy and she fought against the desire to rest. She slumped backwards on the floor as still more blood continued to pool around her, a lot of it her own, but more still coming from her friends.
Tony’s eyes were damp when the song concluded, unsure how he had gotten so lucky to have this incredible little family to call his own.
The kids in the corner probably don’t realize they’ve been made, but Clint’s good at his job for a reason. He can manage to stick to the background, keep himself and lucky enough out of the way, that they just look like a person playing fetch with his dog. He silently thanks Tony for insisting that he let him design these aids, because eavesdropping is much easier than it would have been, two audiologist suppllied sets ago.
He tugs off his scarf the second they’re through the door to the loft, throws it over the back of one of the chairs, though he doesn’t take his jacket off yet. He’s lost the majority of sensation in his fingers, and he knows it’ll take him less time to recover the ability to feel if he stays warmer. His phone buzzes in his back pocket, a text instead of a call, so it can’t be anything urgent. He turns to Steve, leans in for another kiss, and lets himself smile when he pulls back.
Tony shifts slightly where he's waiting on the couch of the summer house, watching the TV without really watching it. Pre-heat kicked in early this morning, and the cramps only stopped an hour or so ago, which means that Tony can feel the beginnings of slick between this thighs. He's beginning to wonder whether or not this was a bad idea.
“so you’ve covered who you are, ‘Ed’. Want to explain ‘why’ exactly you’re here, now?” Steve’s sure to put a certain amount of emphasis on the other mans name, let him know that Steve’s still not exactly buying the cover story of being from another universe. (can you blame him?) but, if the brunet notices, he doesn’t acknowledge it, in the slightest. He’s fiddling with something, in his lap, a piece of technology not unlike a StarkPad, but more hardware intense, less holograph dependent, like the ones in the Tower. Ed must catch him checking the piece of technology out subtly, because he smirks, without looking up, and swipes a few pages off to the side.
Tony’s backed himself into a corner, because that’s the safest place to be, when he panics. He remembers being a child, Howard berating him when he was drunk, when he threw things. Corners were good places to be. Harder to fight off hits you can’t see coming.
The ‘both of you’ of Steve’s sentence takes too long to filter through Rhodey’s brain, and when he finally gets it, the final piece of the puzzle slots into place for him. He’d been so concerned about the obvious distress on Tony’s face, and the aggression on Steve’s, he’d never bothered to look down. Where Tony is obviously heavily pregnant. The light T shirt he’s wearing makes it incredibly obvious, but the last several times Rhodey had seen him, he’d been in layers, wearing clothes big enough that he just looked like he’d gained some ambiguous weight. he racks his brain, trying to think of the last time he’d seen Tony. they talked almost every day, sure, but on video chats, and through text, and it’s easy to hide a bump then, isn’t it? He feels a wave of nausea wash over him. What kind of friend he must be, to not have even noticed.
“Had the right stamina, my god.” he says, winking, before he turns back to the TV, and whatever trash show they’re watching. He digs into his burger, and the way Clint fiugres it, the conversation is off the table for a few moments, anyway, if for nothing else, then for the fact that the kid currently has half an entire cow shoved into his mouth. When the conversation picks back up, it’s on a totally different subject than Clint ever could have expected. “What do you know about Bucky Barnes?”
Moving away from Tony isn’t ideal, given that Steve’s grip around him is part of what’s grounding him, as ineffective as it currently is. Rhodey looks like he’s intent on murder though, so Steve moves, readjusting Tony as gently as he can, and taking a healthy step away from him, just in case. Tony whines, and Steve hates himself for it, but his focus now, has to be getting them all through this.
Clint swears he hears a noise somewhere behind him while he’s listening to Pepper ask too many questions at once, but he can’t afford to pay any attention to it. Tony’s just disappeared from his field of view with a member of Red Star, and there’s not a single universe in which that’s a good sign. He makes a distressed sound and Pepper definitely picks up on it, if her sudden demand for his location is anything to go by. They don’t have people to spare tonight, given that most of them are working on tracking and identifying the newest drug producers and dealers, so if he’s going to do anything, he’s going to need to do it solo or wait for the cops to arrive. Involving Rhodey seems like a bad idea though, especially given that the guy’s probably busy with the recent string of murders upstate, so he tells Pepper that he can handle it, that if he doesn’t call again within an hour, she’ll have to send people to his location. He pockets the phone, takes his gun out of its holster and checks that his knife is easily accessible in his boot before he sets about finding a side entrance to the gallery. He’ll need the element of surprise if he has any hope of saving Tony – or capturing him for interrogation if he turns out to be dirty.
“did…” but he knows the answer, doesn’t he? He shakes his head weakly. “I killed them.” it’s matter of fact, flat and impartial, like most truths are. He can feel his mind starting to work double time, trying to recover from the worst news he thinks he’s ever heard, and knowing that he’s the cause.
Tony cries out at the pleasure that courses through him, a short high whine that would've woke anyone nearby who wasn't roused by Steve's growl. It's a good thing they're surrounded by miles of unpopulated country, really. He's torn between jerking his hips forward, trying to get away from Steve's mouth because it's doing nothing but stoking the fire under his skin -- Tony could get off from this, yes, but it's not going to sate him like being knotted would -- and pushing back against Steve to let him bring him to climax anyway. In the end, he forces himself to still, stay exactly where he is, because Steve hasn't given him permission to move yet, and he's at the point where Steve's praise is affecting him in more ways than one, and damn it he wants to be good for Steve.
“Not the worst way I’ve ever been woken up, though, I’ll give you that,” he adds with a smirk in Bucky’s direction, because that leaves a lot to the imagination. The first thing that springs to mind is the time he woke up to the sight of Clint, naked, emerging from his bathroom. That was bad. Or the time he fell asleep in the safehouse and woke up while Jessica was torturing – she says interrogating, he begs to differ – a guy for information. Or the time – Yeah, being faced with a gun is becoming a common occurrence, and Tony wonders if he needs to revaluate Rhodey’s offer for a job with the feds. Reformed hackers helping catch bad guys and all that. That’d probably involve the same amount of guns and half the pay though, so he’s content where he is. He tugs his jacket on, then steps forward to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Promise I’ll call, okay? You just gotta have faith in me.”
“Sorry for nearly shooting you Tony. Again.” he takes a step closer, keeping his hands visible, and his movements slow, and offers Tony a hand, gently offering to pull him into a hug that they no doubt both need.
The first sign that this is going to be a massive nightmare is all the furtive looks Steve’s getting from the medical team. As the point man, it’s his job to stand around and look pretty, assist in whatever way he can, until a team member is patched up, or adequately transferred back to base. More often than not, he gets completely ignored, which is fine by him, but today… every single medic that he walks past looks up at him, and back down to their tasks. Something is wrong, but no one quite has the guts to tell him what.
“Thanks,” Tony mutters, pulling on his t-shirt. His body’s protesting at this much movement, insisting that he lies down for a good few hours and tries to sleep through the worst of the pain in his lower back, but he doesn’t exactly have a choice at this particular moment in time. He checks his back pocket for his phone, finds it still in one piece – if he had been wary about the potential of Steve finding something out before, he’s terrified now – and also finds twenty-seven missed messages from Clint, three calls from Pepper, and one of each from Rhodey. Well, looks like he isn’t getting that nap any time soon.
The dreams drift away slowly, as Bucky sleeps. What's usually a calm peaceful rhythm of his chest rising and falling turns to nothing but...well, nothing. He still completely as his respiration falls that much lower. Steve squirms, as Tiny readjusts the blankets and something, who knows what, makes him open one eye slowly tiredly. “T-Tony?” He mutters, voice rough with sleep and disuse.
"I'm so sorry," he says, the words leaving him in a rush as he pulls back to look at Steve. He doesn't really know what he's apologising for: the civil war, the accords, not knowing he was pregnant, losing their child, not telling Steve about it. He just knows he has to apologise. "Steve, I don't--I can't--I'm sorry." He falls silent for a moment, watching Steve watching him, and then adds a quiet, "We should go inside. In case...In case anyone sees us." There isn't anyone for miles around and they both know it, but Tony's still a tad paranoid.
"Sorry about the wait; took me the longest damn time to find your number. Would've asked you for it at the loft, but you seemed like you needed to have a conversation with Barnes and, uh, I thought it was best you did that. Anyway, completely my fault, and I wasn't blowing you off, still kinda sorta definitely interested in continuing things if you are." And Pepper will kill him if she ever finds out about this, or maybe just desecrate his body after Rhodey kills him. There's a pause, then, "It's Tony, by the way. Stark." Steve's face lights up immediately and he can't help the way his stomach swoops out from under him. It's been three weeks. He knew,
"You could... We could meet somewhere else. We couldn't really stay long, without someone noticing, but... It could be something." He falls completely silent, holding his breath in anticipation. It feels like his entire life is hanging in the balance, and he can't breathe. It all comes down to this knee moment, the will he, won't he.
“Boss, Cap, Colonel Rhodes is in the elevator, headed to the penthouse now.” Steve’s eyes go wide, and his stomach sinks to the floor. No one should have access to the tower at all, let alone the elevator to their private living space. Tony must have forgotten to pull Rhodey’s security clearance, or deactivate one of the override codes. Steve curses quietly, and moves to wipe away some of the blood on Tony’s nose.
“But surely his husband could see him?” he puts emphasis on the word husband, raises his eyebrows just enough, so that she understands that he’s asking special permission. Knows that there’s really two conversations going on here, the one that they’re having, and the one hiding just underneath the words they’re speaking. Its taking advantage of a fragile system, and Steve should maybe feel bad about it, but… he needs to see Tony. needs to make sure he’s ok. Famike sighs softly, and picks at a torn corner of Tony’s chart.
“Never really did like hospitals, did you?” Steve. Er… another Steve, leans up against the doorjamb, arms folded over a chest that is seriously stretching the Grey T-shirt that’s on it. Tony gives him a look that’s beyond confused, and well into bewildered, and Steve (Steve prime? Tony’s mind suggests, quietly, trying desperately to make some sense of this nonsense.)
It’s instinct to lean forward, drag his tongue over Tony’s scent glands, and it’s all too easy to bite down on the old scar, renewing it fully. Emotion washes over the pair, and it’s so intense, for a few hysterical seconds, Steve isn’t sure if he’s going to survive it. He whimpers slightly, and when he pulls away, he licks over the wound, hoping to close it. “f-fuck.” He says softly, voice weak and wrung out. “you ok?”
Steve’s eyes go wide, and he laughs, uneasily. It’s not funny, none of this is funny, it’s just that That’s not... that
Steve sighs softly, and his eyebrows furrow together some, as he thinks it over. It’s not something that he’d thought about, everything had changed pace after Ed disappeared, but… it’s a theory that definitely has validity. He shakes his head softly. “I don’t… I don’t know. But you know what? If he brought you back… whatever consequences it might have, I can’t be anything but grateful to him. For once, please don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.”
Harry spent the rest of the night trying to distract Aurora from the agonising wait. They had spent an hour on news sites after Tony ended the phone call, but eventually she had accepted that no one really knew what was happening and much of the so-called news was lies and propaganda against her Pops. When they finally turned in for the night and were lying in each other’s arms in bed, Harry felt her trembling against his chest.
The couple climbed out of the car, joining the other 4 boys as they walked towards the front door of the house. Harry squeezed his girlfriends’ hand in his while Liam knocked on the door. Anne threw open the door with a wide smile, welcoming the boys into her home. Harry bounded forward, sweeping his mother into a bruising hug. “So good to have you home, love,” she murmured into her sons’ curls.
I imagine Aurora's performance of Can't Help Falling in Love to be Hayley Reinhart's https://youtu.be/VqLU4wPzDVg
“Never planned on being a dad,” Tony said. “But Rori’s such an incredible woman and she’s made both of our lives so much better in the last 4 years. Can’t imagine not being a dad anymore.”
She was disorientated at first, groggy from the anaesthetic and confused by the harsh fluorescent lighting. All three men surged forward out of their seats as she started to wake, rushing to her side immediately. Her eyes flitted from her fathers to Harry before she burst into tears. Harry reacted quicker than either of the other two men, gently wrapping his arms around her, cautious of her injuries, and pulled her against his chest as she gasped for breath.
“It was horrific,” Rori replied, wringing her hands in her lap as she thought back to the previous summer. “In the days leading up to the battle, both my dad and Steve flew out to try and contain the situation in Germany and of course I stayed behind. That was a big moment for our family really. Up until that point Dad had gone away for business trips and Steve had been running the occasional mission for S.H.I.E.L.D but that was the first time they both left at the same time. I’m not ashamed to admit that I was scared when they left. I’d already been left an orphan once before and it was an absolute miracle that I got a second chance at a family, so I knew if anything happened to them, I wouldn’t get another. It was a tense few days and then the fight came to New York and all hell broke loose. I was at school when the portal opened and the Chitauri army came through. LaGuardia is only a few blocks from the tower, so we were right in the epicentre of the battle just trying to shelter as best we could and praying that we would make it out of there. Early on I saw the Iron Man suit fly past a window, so I knew that Dad was there, which meant Steve was too and that they would do what they could to protect the school. We could hear the explosions and at some point, someone got the news up on the TVs in the cafeteria where I was. The whole world has seen that same footage, the devastation and the casualties and then the Avengers fighting as best they could and then cameras caught sight of the missile.” Rori stopped, her breath shallow and her hands shaking recalling how close she had come to losing another parent. “He called me as he headed for the portal,” her voice was barely above a whisper.
Steve walked over to the sofa, standing behind Tony and placing his hands on the brunette’s shoulders. Tony put down his tablet, placing one hand over Steve’s on his shoulder without really thinking about and turned to Pepper with a smirk.
“You too,” Ella stammered, before Aurora took pity on her best friend and took her around the room, introducing her to everyone and helping to smooth out the awkwardness. While they were all sat around in the green room, Aurora tucked into Harry’s side as he talked with Zayn, her phone chirped and she fished it out of her pocket to see a text from Mark.
Anne and Robin left a few days after Christmas and Aurora and Harry spent the week before New Year’s watching movies, going ice skating in the park or doing anything at all that let them spend time together.
“Yeah,” Liam sighed. “It feels wrong, but we’ve got to keep moving. We might never really know why he did it, but we’ve just got to work with what we’ve got now and try to make it work.”
Aurora was sobbing, gasping for breath when Steve rushed into her room, Tony a few steps behind him, JARVIS having alerted them once again to her emotional state moments earlier.
“I’ve been thinking about what you said a few weeks ago about a solo album,” she said, jumping straight to the reason they’d organised to get together. “I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. I mean don’t get me wrong, the response to
“I don’t even know how to process this,” Rori said, not sure if she was speaking to Harry or Mark or just speaking out loud for the sake of it. She was freaking out and started scrolling through the replies to the tweet.
Harry agreed and Rori quickly moved his arm around her shoulder and held on to his waist as they headed back out onto the deck. She managed to keep her tipsy boyfriend on his feet as he stumbled along and was grateful when she quickly found Louis and Niall amongst the dancing party guests.
“Oh, nothing much,” Niall shrugged, before turning both boys around to face Rori. “Just this!” he announced with a flourish.
“No, it’s not that.” She shook her head, taking a breath before she explained. “You haven’t seen me without the bandages and there’s a lot of scar tissue.”
The next day was Christmas Eve and Gemma arrived that evening, just in time to join the family on the sofas in front of the tv, the fireplace crackling as they watched the Grinch who stole Christmas. Aurora had been quiet for most of the day, as she usually was on the anniversary of her mother’s death, but she’d found comfort in Harry’s constant presence by her side and had tried not to let her grief consume her as it had in previous years. By the time they found themselves snuggled up under a blank on the sofa, Aurora felt more at peace with her mother’s absence in her life than she thought possible.
“I’ll come with you love,” Louis replied, holding out his arm for her and he led her over to where Harry was hugging Anne, Robin and Gemma.
“The more you try to run from it, the harder it’ll hit when it catches up. You’ll have to face it eventually, so why not do it now?”
“Thank god that boy of mine finally plucked up the courage to ask you,” she said, her eyes darting over to where Harry was standing with his Steve, Gemma and Robin. “You make him so happy, love.”
The night was spent chatting, eating and drinking, as well as playing Uno, a disastrous attempt at monopoly, snap and go fish. Rori had been surprised to find the boys very easy to talk to and it took very little time for her to shake off her nerves. By the time she had been halfway through her second slice of pizza she had almost forgotten that the young men surrounding her where the same boys she had screamed at in concert years ago. Hours later, when the fire had burned down to a few embers and everyone but Rori was 4 or 5 drinks in, they sat in the near darkness talking quietly. Rori found herself talking football with Louis given that her team, AFC Wimbledon, had recently played his Doncaster Rovers in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy the previous month. The pair found themselves deep in conversation about the league tables, completely unaware of the soft look Harry was throwing their way, so happy to see his girlfriend and one of his brothers getting along so quickly and easily.
“Louis fucking Tomlinson?” Ella asked in shock. “How the fuck is Louis Tomlinson inviting you to his house?”
“Pretty much the same,” Rori replies, the smile on her face slipping for a moment. “The doctors have already got another 3 surgeries planned for the start of next year.” Harry rubbed his hand along her shoulder, the other grasping her hand and interlocking their fingers. She squeezed his hand in silent thanks and lent more heavily into his side.
Aurora was nervous when she entered the recording studio in North Hollywood. Mark had sent her the address the previous week and told her that the four members of Our Last Night would be expecting her at 9am, so there she was walking through the front door, with Harry’s supportive hand on her lower back.
“Way better Lou. Had another surgery on my hand 2 weeks ago but everything else has healed up nicely.
“He is, I just don’t want him to get his hopes up too much. Barnes has been through so much that I’m not sure he’ll ever be his old self again.”
Aurora chuckled to her self as she heard her mother’s energetic footsteps running up the stairs and took one last look at her laptop screen before turning towards the front door to watch the older woman enter with a wide grin as she sang loudly and out of key, “I’m dreaming of a waffle-y Christmas”. Aurora burst out laughing as her mother proceeded to dance across their tiny living room, tugging her daughter out of her seat and the two danced as they both repeatedly sang the single line of the goofy tune. After a few moments, the teenager pulled away, gasping for breath as she continued to laugh, tucking a lock of her jet black hair behind her ear.
“I’m sorry babe,” Rori said, rubbing her hand up and down the length of his back. “I just got a bit cold, so I came inside to warm up.”
of June. The day of the first show, Aurora was sitting in the green room, waiting for the boys to come back from one of their many media obligations. She was drawing while she waited, periodically picking up her phone to see if any other critics had reviewed her show. It felt weird for her to not be there for the final two weeks, but she wanted to be there with Harry. She’d spent months looking forward to her chance to spend the summer with him and the boys and she knew she’d made the right choice to come on tour now given everything that had happened at the end of their last set of shows. Her art was in safe hands and she trusted Pepper to coordinate its safe return to the tower after the show came to an end, so she decided to put it aside in her head and focus her attention on being there on tour and present in the moment.
“Last year,” the disembodied voice replied, “Sir and Captain Rogers purchased a large pine tree and decorated the apartment at the beginning of December. They hosted Colonel Rhodes, Miss Potts and Mr Hogan for a Christmas Eve dinner and watched
“No, you’re not,” Liam pressed, his eyes flicking around the room to make sure no one was listening to their conversation. “Talk to me.”
“I’ll join to in a minute,” Rori said when Anne asked her if she was coming with them. “Just waiting on one more person. Save me 2 seats next you?”
“Missed you too Liam,” Rori whispered back, returning his tight hug before pulling back and walking over towards her finance and their best friend. Niall had already walked over to them ahead of her and thrown his arms around their shoulders.
“That doesn’t make what they’re saying ok,” Tony said, already itching to respond to some of the nastier comments but knowing that would make things so much worse.
“You were so incredible up there kid,” Tony said, pulling away from the hug as Rori settled into her seat. They enjoyed the remainder of the awards show and as they stood to leave at the end, Rori turned to face the two men.
“Nervous?” he asked as they both sat down facing each other. Aurora gave a quick nod and a small smile in response, tucking a lose strand of hair behind her ear. “Don’t be,” Letterman added, “we’ll only talk about what you’re comfortable with and if you don’t want to answer any of my questions just say so and we’ll skip to the next one. This isn’t live so we can just take our time.”
Aurora looked up at the man leaning in the doorway to her bedroom, knocking gently on the exposed wood.
first and Aurora screamed along with the rest of the audience, her arm slung around Ella’s shoulders. When the song ended, a video package of well wishes for the hiatus played on the screens. In amongst the video messages from the likes of David Beckham, 5sos and Little Mix, Aurora’s own face appeared on the screen.
“Well there’s no one better to work on it than you, dad,” Aurora smirked. “You got Peter helping you on it?”
“Not at all,” Rori said, a smile still stretching across her face. “Your mum was just filling me in on how much you and Harry missed me.”
“I spoke to them and I really don’t think you have anything to feel bad about.” Mark reached out to place a comforting hand on her shoulder before he continued. “You’re the only one who gets to decide how you handle this Rori. No one else gets to decide for you or tell you what the right way to process everything is.”
“From everything Harry’s told us, I knew that you’d be a wonderful woman,” Anne said. “We’re excited to have you join the family.”
“If you’re smiling like that while texting a boy then I hate to break it to you but you’re dating,” Clint offered. “I don’t make the rules.”
. Aurora’s eyes grew damp with unshed tears while Harry sang out, “You’re perfect to me,” as he stared into her eyes and the tears spilled down her cheeks as she sang back along with him, “I’m in love with you and all these little things.”
“I figured it was probably about time we sat down and worked out a game plan,” he explained. “I spoke with your dads after everything happened and we all decided you didn’t need to be thinking about any of this immediately, so I just put a pause on everything. I hope that was the right call.”
“I think I’d like to plead the fifth your honour,” she replied. “But if it makes you feel better, you were my mum’s favourite. She used to say you seemed like you’d be a wonderfully polite young man.”
Aurora smiled brightly, turning back to face the stage, Anne’s arms still wrapped around her as they stood side by side. Towards the end of the song, Harry passed by their section of the crowd and after spotting them together he blew a kiss, happy beyond words to see his mum holding onto his girl and keeping her safe.
“If you’re not ready for me to see that, we don’t have to do anything tonight,” he murmured, ever the gentleman she fell in love with.
She left her face pressed into his neck, his long hair falling over her as she replied. “You didn’t do anything wrong Harry. I just wasn’t expecting…”
“So, it sounds like you had a quite a happy childhood despite not having much to your name,” Letterman said, steering the conversation slowly around to the topic Rori knew she needed to address.
“It’s at Louis Tomlinson’s house.” The other people in the bar turned to stare at the girls as Ella squealed. “I thought I said you couldn’t freak out,” Rori chided.
She nodded silently, tears dripping down her cheeks as she leant away from Harry’s chest and reached her uninjured hand out towards her dad, urging him to move forward and pull her into a hug. Steve added his arms around them both and Harry watched on as the small family held each other close, trying not to think of what the alternative scene would have looked like.
Not to be needy on main but please leave comments, I'm really enjoying this story but writing can be a bit of a lonely endeavour so it really helps to know that people are liking the story
“Doc said the surgery went really well. They want to keep you in for a few hours until the anaesthetics completely out of your system and then we can go home.”
“Well we already set up something with the Maria Stark Foundation to help cover the medical costs of the survivors and pay for the victims funerals,” Tony replied.
for the shows Summer Concert series and since it was scheduled to be filmed in Central Park, a mere stones throw away from Avengers Tower, it made sense for them to stay there instead of booking hotel suites for all of them.
“Of course,” Steve replied, already standing and crossing the room to her side, with Tony only a step behind him. “Have anything in particular in mind?”
Much later in the evening Aurora caught sight of the time, noting that it was well after midnight, although the party showed no signs of winding down. “It’s getting late,” she pointed out. “I should probably be heading back to my hotel before my parents start to worry.”
As everyone began to shout out the countdown, Harry spun Aurora in his arms so that she was facing him, kissing her deeply as the countdown reached one, and everyone screamed out wishes of happy new year. Harry blocked it all out, focused entirely on the beautiful woman in his arms. They were both so swept up in their kiss that neither realised that the fireworks display had started until they pulled apart. “Happy New Year my love,” Harry murmured in her ear as he quickly spun her back around. He heard her giggle as she moved and he returned to his previous position, holding her tight with his chin on her shoulder. The fireworks burst against the night sky and Aurora’s laughter died on her lips. Due to the way his was pressed against her from hip to shoulder, he instantly felt the change when she froze, her breathe sticking in her throat as her heart began to thunder in her chest. Before he could ask, she was spinning around to bury her face in his chest, her chest heaving as she gasped for air and trembled in his arms. It took him a brief moment to realise what was happening but as soon as his thoughts caught up with him, he bent down, scooping Rori into his arms and rushing from the room. As the elevator doors closed behind him, the sound of the fireworks was muffled but he didn’t stop until he reached the soundproof booth of the recording studio, dropping down onto the sofa in the corner of the room, Aurora still cradled in his arms as he attempted to calm her.
Christmas Day was a much happier affair, with Pepper, Happy and Rhodey joining them for an extravagant Christmas lunch.
“It’s still there,” he admitted. “I’m not sure it will ever fully go away, but it got better when I talked about it. Wilson’s offered to help. You know he worked at Veteran Affairs back in DC helping soldiers with PTSD?”
“I’m not sure how to say this,” she said, eyes glancing up to meet Steve’s quickly before looking back down to where her hands were clasped in her lap.
“It’s too much,” Rori explained, finally stepping back from the hug and turning to once again look at the recording studio spread out before her. “I don’t know what to say.”
with a small crowd of her friends and family assembled underneath it. The crowd included the Avengers, Pepper and Happy, Peter and May, her parents and two new faces; one of which she recognised from photos to be Bucky Barnes, while the other she assumed to be the newest recruit to the team, Sam Wilson. Rori quickly found herself sandwiched between both of her fathers as they threw their arms around her, crushing her in a warm group hug. She laughed as they finally let her go. “I missed you too,” she chuckled, allowing them to lead her further into the room to be passed from one hug to the next as everyone took their turn to welcome her home.
“Are they famous?” Ella asked, “because I know that I’m the only one you stayed in contact with after you moved to the states so it’s no one from school.”
Following the second week of Aurora’s art show, she flew out with the boys for Cardiff, Wales for the start of the next leg of their tour on the 5
After Mark left, Aurora headed to her room, already dialling Harry’s number as she swung the door closed behind her and threw herself onto her bed.
Aurora cringed, mouthing an apology to her father who waved it off before standing and leaving the room, knowing that his husband would want to yell and rant for a bit first before he was ready to listen to reason.
The silence that followed his words was thick in the air. No one moved, barely even breathing as the words slowly settled between them. Louis was the first to recover, quickly looking to Harry in dawning horror as Harry pulled his phone from his pocket, already dialling Aurora’s number. Liam also pulled his phone out, pulling up the latest news report. He gasped in shock when the first article included a photo of Steve carrying Aurora out of a building, blood soaking through both of their outfits.
“you shoulda told me about him, punk. That was always the deal. We talk to each other, Stevie. I don’t deserve to have to find you neckin’ some pretty little thing in your loft.” He shoots a glance to Tony and huffs quietly. “and he don’t deserve the red star enforcer threatenin’ to shoot him first thing after he wakes up.
“Stark. Hey.” he says, jostling the slighter man, to get him to wake just the slightest bit. He hated to wake up alone, when he’d gone to sleep with company, Clint knew that. Something borne from the way that his parents raised him, or acquired from a lifetime with the mob, or hell, just a random quirk about Tony. No matter what it was, Clint knew about it, and he always tried to do what he could, to make sure that he didn’t set off that particular anxiety. It was the least he could do, he figured. “Stark. C’mon, man, you’re crushing me.” Tony stirs sleepily, and shifts his position, burrowing more into Clints chest, and making his heart ache painfully, with missing something he technically never had.
Tony’s down in the workshop when he hears it: a sharp, tinny chime from the drawer Rhodey made him lock the burner phone away in. Well, Rhodey didn’t make him lock it away, but both Rhodey and his therapist agreed that it would probably be better for him and his recovery if he didn’t spend a solid two hours a day holding the phone in his hands and staring at it as though he could use it to telepathically communicate with Steve. So, he and Rhodey locked it away, and Rhodey left the keys in a little box on the opposite side of the workshop, because Tony swore he wouldn’t unlock the drawer.
“Don’t be. I’m flattered,” she replied, echoing his previous statement and they slipped back into the easy conversation that had occupied the last hour or so.
“Baby what’s wrong?” Tony asked, both men crowding her from either side, their arms wrapping around her as they tried to calm her. “Is it your hand? Are you in pain? Do you need us to call a doctor?”
“Mind if I join?” he murmured, pressing himself against his girlfriend’s back, taking the loofa from her hand and finishing scrubbing the body wash across her stomach and back. Rori chuckled as she turned in his arms, kissing him deeply as he tipped his head under the water to wet his shoulder length curls. She pulled back from the kiss to rub shampoo into his hair, smiling happily as she recalled seeing online that the fans had been calling it his Prince Harry hair.
. She had writing credit on almost every track on the new album, but after talking about it with the boys, they had decided that
“They missed you too, you know,” Jay chuckled. “Louis never shuts up about you and the way Harry pouts when he sees the other boys with their girls is honestly adorable.”
century he is still very old fashioned in many ways and he felt it was important to make sure that I was on board before he asked, which of course I was.”
“He’s told me a lot about you too,” Rori replied, a soft smile lifting the corners of her lips as she glanced over at her step-father. “That was before he knew you were still alive though.”
Christmas with Anne, Robin and Gemma was filled with plenty of tea, cosy sweaters, cheesy movies and more food than any of them could eat. By the evening, Aurora was collapsed on the sofa, snuggled up against Harry’s side, sharing a soft blanket as the sound of Michael Bublé filled the living room and Gemma and Anne danced across the rug.
“LaGuardia?” she asked. “I’ve read about it. It’s unbelievably good but the audition process is brutal apparently.”
She took another deep breath before lifting her head and offering a small smile to her rescuer. Her smile froze on her face when she caught sight of the man next to her.
Not long after the end of sound check, the boys’ families started arriving and soon the green room was crowded with people, voices rising above each other and plenty of hugs shared. Anne, Robin and Gemma were the last of the family members to arrive and after hugging each of the boys they were shocked to see Aurora and Steve amongst the small crowd.
“I’m just gonna go grab something from my bag,” he announced heading off down the hallway to where his bag had been left in Aurora’s room. Tony helped Rori get herself comfortable on the sofa with her legs propped up on the edge of the coffee table and a small cushion placed between her arm and stomach to take the pressure off of her sutures. Steve pulled a soft blanket off the back of the sofa and draped it over her lap and when Harry returned to the living room, both Steve and Tony excused themselves, leaving the young couple alone.
“You had a lot on your plate kiddo,” Tony explained, running his hand through her hair. “Steve and I were pretty sure it’s what you would have wanted us to do.”
“Aurora Stark, right?” he asked. “I was pretty sure it was you, but it was hard to tell with your face buried in your dress.”
“It’s got a matching jacket too,” Harry grinned, holding out his arms and giving a twirl. “I’m so happy you’re here for this Rors. When are you going to stop surprising me like this?”
