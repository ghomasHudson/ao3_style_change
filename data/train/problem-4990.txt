The brunet sighed, leaning on the chain-link fence. "I wonder if that guy is real. Maybe he is on the other side of this fence?" He said to himself aloud.
"Hey, shhh, calm down," Tony soothed, reaching over to wipe away the stray tear, "They never got it because Howard's voice didn't match, and mine didn't either. The video was too old and distorted, so they discounted the evidence."
"C'mon baby, I can feel you there," Tony moaned, reaching down between them to pump Steve, "C'mon, fuck--"
"Jealous, kiddo?" He teased, smooching Pete's cheek, "How was the aquarium? I see you've got a new little fella, there."
"I'm glad you were able to endure, but angry you had to suffer through that." Steve whispered, kissing Tony's neck in return. "I don't want you to hurt anymore, baby. No more..."
"Something like that," Tony mumbled, peeling a fingernail off and tossing it out the window. He ducked his head, stomach rolling even when he felt the car come to a stop in the garage.
[Steve felt relieved that the boy had been trying to draw something else, smoothing Peter's hair back and kissing his forehead.
Peter screwed up his face, angrily shutting his coloring book and tossing his crayon aside, standing with a teary huff. He stomped out of the room, marched up the stairs to his bedroom, slammed the door behind him and crawled into bed.
Steve had an idea. It swam around his head like crazy as he tried to sleep that night, not leaving him be. He knew it was wrong and dangerous, crazy even, but he knew it was his best bet if it came to visiting Tony on the surface.
"Well, you should know the baby will be in very loving hands." He assured quietly. "We have a little boy right now that we adopted and he is very well off, but we had him after the potty training happened, so we will definitely be taking baby classes. But he will be so loved and cared for completely.”
Steve huffed softly, close up his blankets and curling into them again. "You have a point. Don't like it though..." He hummed, at least inching as close as he could to Tony in the bed.
He smiled softly and smooched the blond's temple once he sat, grabbing the shampoo to start massaging it into Steve's hair.
Steve slowed his movements just a bit, feeling Tony's breathe being short and his nails in his back.
"I'll help you out. Then we can head to bed." Steve hummed happily, getting one more kiss in before helping move and stack everything up.
"I'd hope other people wouldn't be in there with us, though." He said, coming to stand beside Tony. "Just because it could, doesn't mean it should." He hummed.
"But I don't stink." Peter groused, but eventually gave up with a sigh. He got off of Tony's lap and waited for his Daddy to come along with him.
"Other than being sick? Yeah, I'll be okay." Steve answered, eating at his food carefully. "I've got someone taking care of me very well, so that's good." He smiled softly and gave Tony's hand a squeeze. "Are you okay?"
"Who is that, Sammy? Is that bubby? You like being with bubby, don't you?" He giggled, using one arm to mix up formula.
"You know what I meant." Steve said with a small grin, gently smacking Tony's arm as he left for the desk again. "How're the papers going, by the way?"
Steve smiled back, kissing him sweetly. "Love you, too." He hummed. He stretched a bit, letting out a small groan, “Mh...sore.".
After they had finished, Steve said goodbye to Bruce and went back on his way to his own dorm. On his way back he kept that image of Tony in his mind, making sure to make a rough sketch of it immediately when he got back.
"But now," he started as he stood up "it is bedtime for a certain Spiderboy." He grinned, petting back Peter's bangs.
"When my fever breaks, will you lay with me?" He asked softly. "I shouldn't be contagious then if I am now."
Steve raised an eyebrow to him, scissoring him just slightly. "You think you can handle it? Think you can handle my cock inside you without much prep, just splitting you open?" He hummed lowly.
"Hey, munchkin." Steve said with a chuckle at Peter's way of speaking when he first wakes up. "Did ya get a little catnap?"
"Huh? What? Yeah, what's up?" Tony answered, a curious head tilt towards him being earned from the other.
"I am, baby, but Papa's still asleep. Why don't you go downstairs and play?" Tony called softly, "I'll be down in a minute to make you breakfast." He grinned down at Steve, swiping his thumb over the slit just to fuck with him.
"Will do." Steve laughed softly. "Of course if that does happen and you are asleep on top of me, then you'll be woken up too, regardless."
"Don't look, Sammy. Daddy and Papa are kissin' an' its gwoss." The boy grumbled, earning a gurgle from the baby.
"Sorry lovie, but this is faster than a bath," Tony murmured, making Peter's hair stick up into a mohawk, "You look silly."
Steve threw his head back against the headboard, teeth biting into his lip to the point of bleeding. Not much more before he was going to come. Tony grinned, reaching up to tweak his nipples, pulling back ever so slightly. Steve came right soon after with a sharp exhale, toes curling up and hands tensing against the cuffs as he did. Tony swallowed it all, pulling off with a wet 'pop'.
"Not bad. Mischievous." Steve smirked back, grabbing ahold of Tony's wrists and slapping the cuffs on them. "But even mischievous boys get taught lessons. To the desk. Now."
"It’s more than okay, Tony. I've never slept on silk before." He smiled softly, changing into pajama pants. He walked over and led Tony onto the bed with him. "As long as you're happy with it, I'm happy."
"Looks like it’s you and me, kid." He told the baby, settling them on the couch with the babe on his chest. "Just me and my Samwich."
"Your Irish is killing me," he mumbled in English, laughing as he buried his face in Steve's neck, "Don't think I can last much longer--"
He grinned, smooching the top of Sammy's head before passing him up to Steve, taking his bowl of cereal.
Tony sighed softly, holding back his giggle. "Alright, alright. I'll be good," he mumbled, kissing him back. He quickly changed into his day clothes, grabbing his tablet up from the table. "Wanna go upstairs and paint?"
"I must say, Rogers, you certainly are comfortable," Tony hummed, tucking his head under the blond's chin.
"Now try to be polite when we meet Ms. Rushman in here." Steve warned. "With her reputation, she may have put half the bodies in the morgue herself..."
Back at his place, Steve cleaned up relatively carefully. He looked into his closet for one of his nicer pairs of jeans, slipping them on and tightening his belt. He then slipped on a white tank top and threw over a dark blue V-neck, grabbing his darker jacket to throw it all together.
"You love it though, don't you? Love that I can fill you up like this?" He breathed, caressing Tony's hips as they moved
"Ya goof. You are a big goof." He sighed gently. "When I feel like moving again, I' putting it out."
Steve huffed, looking around at the mess again with a nervous squeak as he took pictures of it, sending it to Tony before he worked on cleaning.
"No you will not." Steve warned nervously. "Your lips are only for me to smooch and vice versa. Don't do it." He actually whined, curling up protectively behind Tony.
Peter wiggled out of Tony's arms and crawled up onto the bed, tucking himself in next to Steve and Sammy. Tony rolled his eyes fondly and sat on the edge of the bed, watching his boys curl up together.
"Not too much sugar before bed, and make it last," Tony chuckled, "And save it for after dinner, squirt."
"Can you do d'micker? I gotta get dwessed," Peter asked, tugging on the electric mixer, "An' it’s too heavy."
"Mhm," Tony hummed, grabbing the washcloth to start gently scrubbing the boy down, "Lemme know if anything hurts, okay?"
"That'll be good." He hummed, running his hands through Tony's hair sweetly. "The good thing is that since we just moved, there isn't much to clean. We'll need to go grocery shopping, though. I want to make a nice dinner for her when she first comes to visit."
Steve shivered slightly as Tony's fingers trailed down, hips twitching back a bit at the touch."Always will be good for you. To you. Always good." He hummed.
"I think it would be a great idea. Having a baby that's a part of us. Just raising a baby in general, really." Steve chuckled warmly.
"Oh, I'll be the one curling up to you, huh?" Steve chuckled, raising an eyebrow. "We'll see about that."
"I know it doesn't. Things like that seem like they just happened a week or days ago when it’s been much longer." He sighed, thinking of his own mother. "But life just keeps going on. And we fall back in suit with it."
"Good for you, hon." Steve said as he came back in, carrying in the ham and setting it on the table. He kissed Tony's cheek before sitting in his place at the table and folding his hands in front of him. "Now would anyone like to say grace?"
"Hey there, sleepy face." Steve chuckled at their sleepy son. "You want a couple cookies before you go to bed?"
"I can reach!" Peter proclaimed, nearly out of the swing as he tried to touch the ground with his tip toes. "I want ya ta swing toooooo."
"Mmm, I love when you play with my hair..." He sighed happily, playing footsie with Tony as their legs were tangled.
"I was trying to keep quiet. You made that very difficult to do, y'know,” Steve said softly, looking to Tony carefully.
"So Papa is like your own Capt'n 'Merica." Peter grinned into the touch. "He keeps ya safe from bad peoples."
"Alaska and Hawaii, Alaska and Hawaii," Tony blurted, knowing his cock was completely obvious, straining in his underwear.
"I honestly don't know, but he's going to snap out of it, even if it means I homeschool him," Tony replied flatly, "This is-- I'm going to go talk to him, okay?"
"No you haven't." He scolded lightly. "You've been acting up here and there more often, haven't you Tony?"
"Yeah, I'm fine buddy. Just uh..." Steve covered the boy's ears when he heard another spiel of curse words. "Daddy is just saying some things you shouldn't hear right now."
"You've already done that. And I know you'd keep doing that without even trying." Steve said softly, reaching to caress Tony's cheek. "You are so good to him, Tony. He looks up to you so much, so you must be doing right."
"There were quite a few lovely projects, but I think Steven's was one of the best out of the group."
The genius hummed softly, listening to the merman's words and feeling a tug at his heartstrings with the way those blue eyes looked when filled with a longing look.
"You do that just by being with me.". Steve rubbed along Tony's back, feeling the man shake slightly as he did.
"Mostly things that look interesting to me." Steve stated, looking around at some of the things. "Honestly, some of these things look like they could double as torture devices."
"I'm guessing that's still in development?" Tony asked, amused, "Well, I guess we'll have to go get you an illustrator's desk so you can comfortably work on these projects."
“I’m sure that wouldn’t be a problem,” Steve admitted, looking between both Tony and Bucky, “I’ve known him for so long, I could probably recognize him right off the bat.”
"Very funny. Cute." Steve said, rolling his eyes fondly, sneaking in another finger. "Y'know you are making my job right now harder. Among other things." He smirked.
Down in the lab, Tony cursed at the top of his lungs, fingers underneath the lab sink as he washed off the burn. He let his concentration slip for
." Tony was practically hopping by the time they got to the shop, picking out a loaf of bread and a blueberry scone before going back out to meet Steve. "Ready?"
“Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes and Mr. Wilson have expressed their concerns with your recent behavior and health, as well as your absence from your regularly scheduled runs. They wish to speak with you as soon as is possible.”
"...Flash Thompson. He's been mean to me at school." He murmured softly, picking at Tony's shirt. "He's why my glasses broke the other day, too. Not cuz I sat on them..."
Tony kissed him silent, bringing his hands up to cup Steve's cheeks. He kissed on his lips and nose and jaw and forehead and any available skin expanse in reach, gently pushing him back down onto the bed.
Steve held Peter to him, brushing his hair gently with his hand. "See what I mean? You okay, Petey Pie?"
Steve hummed in affirmation, glancing up at Tony then back at their boys. "As ready as I am able to be. We've got this." He assured confidently.
"I know. And I see nothing wrong with that." Steve said happily, eyeing Tony's stomach as an idea came to his mind. He moved his face down lower on Tony's torso, stopping just before blowing a raspberry onto Tony's stomach.
"What--" Tony started, happily taken aback by the sight of Steve before him dressed like a chef in a cute little apron and mitts like it was the most normal thing ever. "What are you doing, Steve? I smelled burning fish and--
"Awe ya still sweepy, Daddy?" Peter asked just as Steve went to wipe at his face, smooshing his cheeks together.
Steve leaned in and cut Tony off with a kiss, a smile on his lips. "That sounds so great, Tony. Smarty pants, got everything all figured out. He is going to absolutely love it, I know he will."
"Absolutely. I love looking at the penguins, too." Steve chuckled, buckling in and starting the car. "On to the aquarium!" He proclaimed as they started to go.
Steve's late for work, Tony gets really angry at how the employer treats Steve. Also, couple-ly discussions.
"I bet it’s been long, baby... But now we have the house. And each other. We can be each other's home, all right. No need to worry anymore."
"Well, I suppose so, if you feel you need punished." Steve sighed softly, picking up the ruler and lifting it under Tony's chin for a moment. He moved it side to side, examining Tony's face.
Once back at the mansion, Tony helped Steve settle his new clothes into the room he was staying in, leaving them for now and giving the blond one of his old hoodies to use as a form of pajamas and a pair of socks to keep his feet warm. Steve looked like he was swimming in the garment with how big it was on his thin frame, but it was actually cute and endearing seeing the other that way. The way that Steve occasionally nuzzled into the fabric to feel its softness, however, just about made Tony's brain go into overload of cuteness. Big or small, this man just seemed to warm his heart with how adorable he was.
"Ooo, they have apples and cinnamon." Steve pointed out, grabbing a box and putting it in the cart. "We are trying these just because I find these ridiculous." He said with a chuckle.
He grabbed the stockings and tucked them against his chest while he scuttled by Steve, tucking the stockings away before returning.
"Yes, Peter. Dinner and cuddles." Steve laughed, petting the boy's hair. "Did Auntie Pepper give you sugar or something?"
"Unca Clint! Ladies first! Dat's da rules!" Peter scolded, crossing his arms. "Auntie Tasha goes next, mister!"
"Love you too, so much. So damn much." Steve sighed as he rocked down with Tony's fingers. He moaned softly when Tony slipped in a third finger and worked to open him further.
"Since Clint yelled and startled me," Tony laughed, leaning back in his chair, "I was up, though, just lounging around." He shifted in the chair, yawning at Steve. "I don't ache as much."
"Don't worry Peter, I'm sure your fathers will change the subject," Sharon laughed, setting the empty bottle aside.
He got up from the bed, shoving his hands in his pockets with a smirk. Steve groaned as Tony got up, hanging over the side of the bed and reaching for Tony.
"He did real well today. Helped me test some stuff, didn't touch anything he wasn't supposed to," Tony hummed, patting Peter's back, "Right, bud?"
Peter continued to pout as he listened to Tony, staying silent the whole time. He started to sniffle lightly, keeping tears from falling from his eyes.
"Speaking of my 'roommate', you need to properly meet the brood." He said with a grin. "Have a seat on the couch, and I'll be right back."
"He got too close and almost fell in the water," Tony sighed, kissing Steve back before sitting up, grunting at the small flare of pain, "He had me promise to not tell you, since you didn't want him so close to the edge, anyway."
"Oh! I just have to finish up the sides and by that time the ham should be done." Steve stated, patting Tony's arm as he stood to head back to the kitchen. "Let Peter wake up in a little bit for dinner, all right?" He whispered, leaving the group to mingle.
"You know exactly what. Playing dumb isn't your forte." The blond stated, still refusing to look. "Seven letter word meaning to be strongly attracted to someone?"
"God bless America," Tony saluted him, lips screwing up from attempting not to laugh, "Should I sing?
Hearing Tony's last statement, Steve peeked out of the hoodie a bit, looking up at the other expectantly with flushed cheeks still prominent.
Tony replied with a grunt as he sucked down the liquid, not surprised to hear Steve's laughter from the kitchen.
. Need you, please. Ah, damn..." He whined as Tony continued to hit at his spot. He panted against Tony's chest, hands gripping at the sheets.
He gently washed the lather out of Peter's hair, grabbing the washcloth to start scrubbing him down.
"I'm sure I would. But ask me again when I actually remember everything. Still sure I'll say yes, but it wouldn't hurt to ask." he grinned playfully.
Steve smiled softly at that. "You guys are soulmates, too." He asked as a statement, not really ever realizing it.
"Yeah, baby. Just don't stay up too late, okay?" Steve whispered back, kissing Peter's cheek. "Good night. Say night to Daddy too before you go."
"We'll do this again in the morning and again that night. Let it heal." Steve murmured, petting gently at Tony's face. "What am I gonna do with you?" He sighed with a fond smile, sooner turning relieved as he nuzzled into Tony's neck.
"They've been doing that since I was eleven, and I still don't believe it," He mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck.
Sammy looked over from Sharon's shoulder and reached a chubby hand out for Peter, making tiny whines.
"I love you," Tony breathed, once he forced himself to take his lips off of Steve's, "I love you too goddamned much to let my fucking stupid bitch ass to get in the way of loving you."
"Love you too. Love you so goddamed much," Tony whispered, content to stroke his hair before he fell into a deep sleep.
"Mmm. I know why," Tony replied with a hum, brushing his fingertips over the nape of Steve's neck, "I'll explain once we return to the flat."
"So the doc said that the stitches have to stay for a couple of weeks. I'll need to help keep it clean and put ointment on it to help keep from scarring, but that won't be trouble at all."
"Mmm, you know I could never leave you like this," Tony teased, leaning down to kiss up Steve's cock, "You're too pretty, bambi."
Peter shrugged silently in response. "I wuz in ma bed dis mornin'." He whispered, seeing Tony still asleep.
," Tony moaned, dissolving into noises. He rolled himself down onto Steve till he felt himself tighten, arching and screaming as he came on his chest.
"Now who's the meanie?" Steve said softly, but kissed Tony back lovingly. "You just took it a little too far, there. Sorry I got upset about it. It's just, you're my first real relationship and I'm protective of it. Plus it’s weird talking about people we know like that..."
"Afternoon." Steve hummed with a smile, eyes cracking open. He stroked Tony's cheek sweetly. "How you feelin'?"
"We'll just make sure he is occupied during then." Steve said simply. "We'll play and nap with him to keep him distracted."
"Mhm, that's the word," Tony's voice came from the hallway, causing Sammy to squeal. Tony poked his head into the room with a grin, waving a teether ring at the baby before giving it to him.
"Papa's silly," Peter whispered up to Tony, giving Steve a wary look, "Or he's weally tired. Does Papa need nap time?"
He kissed Tony’s temple softly, hugging him close to him. "You don't have to do that anymore though, okay? Never ever. You can talk to me, I'll help you. You don't have to hurt anymore, love."
"Good boy." Tony slipped in his fingers with the vibrator, stretching Steve further; he grinned, making sure the vibrator was tight up against Steve's spot before flicking it on.
"Sorry," Tony whispered against Steve's lips, pulling back to duck his head into Steve's neck, "I really fucked that one."
"But youse is married to 'im. Why's he worried about a lady?" Peter pouted, not really getting it all.
"This is true. Long while. Real long while." Steve hummed, tilting his head a bit. "Right now isn't a good time for any of it, sadly." He whined faintly. "Maybe this afternoon, we could see if Peter wants to visit his uncles and aunt?"
Tony lives in a tower, where everything he needs is catered to him and all of his extraneous household duties are done for him.
Finally, the wolf stops and huffs again, and steps forward. Its hot breath is back on his neck, and he whimpers plaintively.
want him like that. Steve picks himself up off the nest, looking down at Tony’s curled up body. Standing up, he realizes he’s wrinkled his suit a bit. He’ll have to hang it up in the shower with him to get the creases out. But it was worth it.
“Excuse me for one moment.” Steve smiles cagily at the justice and yanks Tony by his elbow towards the back of the room. The omega lets it happen, though his face is an open ‘o’ of shock.
Steve gets up and goes to his room to get dressed. It takes less time than the last time, familiarity making his movements quicker, and at last he throws on the sports coat, carefully buttoning the front.
When Bucky breaches him, it’s one smooth and long glide through the messy stickiness of Steve’s cum and Tony’s slick. It’s all over his thighs, sunk into a wet spot on the bed, and the sensation of it is as cool as a wet cloth.
Steve gently squeezes the table under his hands, trying not to break it. That didn’t go well. He’d been so sure he hadn’t misread Bucky’s expression. So now he has to consider the fact that Bucky could be right. That even if Tony turns into a monster while he’s in a rut, that he’s lonely and unhappy, is no justification to change his whole life permanently. Besides, Tony could just change it back. Which is more of a point in Steve’s column than it is Tony’s.
“Crushed a couple rose bushes, but hopefully we can get those back up and blooming.” The statue is a saint that he doesn’t recognize, and it’s laying on its side in the garden bed. He walks in and grabs it, hoisting it up, and places it upon its pedestal. He wiggles it from side to side to make sure it’s lodged on tight, for good measure.
It’s just so hard though, to think about Tony defiling himself. But he shouldn’t say anything, because he knows Tony will come down hard on him.
. It drips down the side of the couch and coils about his legs and reaches up to press against his scrotum and perineum. It’s a soft hum there, pulsating against him, and Steve smiles wickedly at Tony. Tony bites his lip and manages to pull his under armor off the rest of the way, leaving him entirely in the nude but for his symbiote.
“Oh no. He owed me a favor. You know the one.” Tony grins conspiratorially at her. His body is vibrating and he’s so close to Nat that Steve wants to step in between them.
Tony wakes up again, pressing his backside to Steve’s already hardening cock. It slips around in Tony’s crack as Tony backs into it, needy.
“Hmm. Good to know you have a line. Something where you’ll say ‘there and no further.’” Tony’s face is back to casual disinterest, as if he hadn’t just been seducing Steve into having his way with Tony. Tony strolls back to his seat, not seeming perturbed in the slightest. “Well, if you have nothing else to say, you can go.”
The glands puncture, and like morphine, Steve drips in. He can feel him all over, suffusing Tony with all of his desire. Tony is stunned, unable to hide his own affection for Steve swimming across the bond. A wave of the same desire hits him back, and Tony is lost.
“How do we do this?” Nat is all business. She’d make a great second in command to Cap, who is the logical leader here. Iron Man is just a grunt in a suit as far as many of them know.
“You’ll have to check in your cell phones and any knives or other weaponry. I know you’re from a government agency, but we can’t have any of those things here. No pictures, no nothing. Understood?” Nat drops a few knives into the bin that she pulls out from who knows where on her person. Steve, who has nothing but his cell phone, drops that into the bin also.
“The only reason I haven’t asked Nat for help is because Tony will perceive all of this as a betrayal, and if SHIELD and myself are the only people he’s mad at, I stand a better chance of having him forgive the transgression.”
Dr. Geiszler is gesticulating wildly, pointing at equations and other scribblings on his board as Fury glares at the two of them.
But Fury isn’t wrong about existential threats. Or at least, he isn’t as delusional as he usually is about them. Tony had read over what had happened in New Mexico and can see how SHIELD would have liked to have been in more control. However, making world-ending weapons is like deciding to burn down someone’s house because they kicked you in the shins. Nuclear deterrents don’t work how people want them to, especially if said aliens decide they aren’t at all adverse to loss of human life.
“I can’t eat that much. I told you.” Tony glares at Steve now, the heat of which is belayed by the spittle that still rests at the corner of Tony’s mouth and how pale he looks.
“You and every other alpha. I know just the place.” When they pull up to a store that has big, shining letters that say ‘nest,’ Steve feels rather foolish.
Steve didn’t disappoint, licking and sucking his way down Tony’s pectorals to his taut belly, which would soon soften into omega physiology.
Tony would never have to conceal himself again. Not with Steve. Steve would always be there to protect him from the way the world seems to ravage Tony’s sensitivities.
“Do you have a thought in your head as to what this will do to people? Particularly when they can’t get ahold of it anymore?” Pepper is shouting behind him, saying something about people, and blah blah, their health, or whatever.
“Howard did this so that SI could stay in the family, and so that you could have control over your life. And what have you done with it? Partied relentlessly. Exposed yourself to all manner of people. There’s pictures,
“God. Steve, you’re so big, god how are you so big?” And Steve, Steve is wondering how Tony is so unbelievably
“Ok, ground rules my dude. Don’t touch anything. Not a thing. It’s all mine and it’s all expensive. Cap, I don’t have to warn you off of my stuff, but some of this is irreplaceable.” The kid looks properly chastised and Tony thinks he won’t be starting shit any time soon. He has no idea what the kid wants or why he trusts Tony. He really, really shouldn’t be relying on Tony at all.
Tony stops in the middle of the entryway, looking down at the floor. He kicks at some invisible fluff there and looks up at Steve.
“But I need him. You don’t understand! He’s everything now. And all those things I did to him, they don’t change how much he’s under my skin and in everything I do and think!”
“So pretty. So gorgeous. Want you to keep these. Does that feel good? You like it when I touch your wings?”
“I’ll try, but you know how he is after his ruts.” Steve thinks that Bucky is beginning to understand, even if he doesn’t want to. This is what Tony needs to have happen to him. As an Omega, he’ll be more stable and emotionally even. Once he’s bonded, hopefully to Steve, it’ll alter the dynamic of the Avengers for the better. A bonded Omega is a happy Omega, if they are treated well and loved. Omegas are the heart of a group, and they’ve sorely needed one to provide harmony in their ranks.
Their arms automatically move to protect their head, but it’s too late as the glass crunches, then caves in, claws reaching for the both of them.
“Don’t ruin this for Tony,” Steve says, with an edge of desperation. Tony stays still and silent throughout the exchange, terrified that the two alphas will attack each other. He wishes Bucky would stop antagonizing Steve, and shamefully, he wishes Steve would
Tony’s shirt is intent on scrunching itself up in the middle, leaving his midriff and lower back exposed. Steve doesn’t seem to notice, his fingers kneading at Tony’s skin, every point of them a warm throb that Tony never wants to end.
Like a prisoner waiting for execution, he moves in slow motion towards the inevitable blade, turning his body so he can make eye contact with the ones who have destroyed his life. Above Tony’s lovely eyes, he meets those of Nat and Bucky, who look surprisingly subdued. Locking his eyes back on Tony, his Omega bounds over and latches onto Steve in an embrace that makes him shudder with relief.
Steve holds his breath for a second before remembering to not do anything to worry Tony or make him think that he has any involvement with these changes. But god is it hard to not think that Howard turned his son into an Alpha. If the hormones were delivered early enough, Tony would never have developed reproductive organs, so there was no way to tell. Steve would never know, and it almost haunts him, but for the fact that it was going to be fixed soon.
Tony cries out those oh-so-very necessary words, the ones Steve has been dreaming of hearing, and he lunges, blanketing Tony in him. He can hardly wait to be buried in Tony, his pliant Omega body begging to give it up to Steve.
Tony has eaten more, slept more, worked more efficiently than any time previous in his life. Sure, he’s not getting as much work done, but what he does is quality, and it’s making up for quantity.
“You know that’s the first time you’ve ever said please to me. I thought your mommy raised you with better manners.” Steve doesn’t know what to say. So he reaches for what he can.
He sits down, and grabs at the food in front of him, not willing to converse about any of it. Bruce lays a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Gosh, you really don’t get it do you. Brightest tactical mind of a generation and he can’t work it out. But it’s okay, I can help you, you fucking knot head. I’m an omega. Yeah. That’s right. Your teammate is a bow-toting, cursing, eat-ice-cream-with-a-fork-for-dinner-if-I-fucking-want, omega.”
The lab is the same as it always is, and that’s a comfort to Steve. It’s bold and beautiful, and everything that Tony represents. He’s there currently, tittering at some piece of technology. Tony doesn’t turn around, though Steve thinks that the other man knows he’s there.
“Uh, yeah, for sure. Um, so this should be easy, so long as you stand up the entire time. Try not to jostle the needles.” Tony coughs then, and turns away. If Nat weren’t watching the two of them so carefully, he would smile at Tony’s little bit of embarrassment. In another time and place, he might ask Tony to go out with him for a walk, if that was still acceptable. Steve’s gotten good at reading the room when it comes to the illegalities of being with men. Tony is receptive, but concerned.
“I want to slake myself in you. I want to drown. I want to carve you out and put myself there,” Steve whispers into the crook of Tony’s neck as he skates his lips along the unbearably sensitive skin there. His hand plays with the plug in Tony’s ass, pushing it in and out, a wicked grin lighting up his face as he pulls it out from Tony.
Alphas were certain in their identity, privileged. And the more Howard had attempted to squeeze and press Tony into an Omegan identity, the more Tony had decided the boundaries of that designation didn't matter. Tony’s lack of concern about mating had Howard begrudgingly bequeathing the company to him. At least Howard could acknowledge that Tony acted more like an Alpha than an Omega, which, while it resulted in slightly better treatment, it rankled his belief that Omegas were just as good, if not better, than Alphas.
“I was wondering if you could beat Bucky.” His eyes are kind, as always, but the aura emanating off of his body gives Tony pause. Tony doesn’t have time to question it before Sam walks over, gait steady, and places a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “We’re supposed to go for a run, but some stuff came up with Karli, so I’m just gonna drive you there. Sorry, man.”
“Always loved you,” Tony whispers, and it’s only through Steve’s superior hearing that he catches it, and he swells with the confession.
Steve takes his leave, feeling restless. He picks up some of his art materials, charcoal pencils and paper pads, and settles in to start drawing. It’s not surprising when he ends up seeing Tony on the page. Tony’s hands, Tony’s face, Tony’s body. Steve doesn’t do him the disservice of trying to draw him nude because he hasn’t seen Tony without boxers or a shirt, but it doesn’t stop him from imagining the curves that exist under the fabric. For hours he draws, pencil swiping this way and that, scritch-scratching across the page.
The Andorian hadn’t even haggled with him! That should have been the first sign. Tony is such an idiot.
Steve doesn’t want to go anymore. He wants to stay here and guard Tony. It’s only now that he’s seeing how dangerous this might be. Someone might try to claim Tony for his heat. Someone who isn’t Steve.
The sun doesn’t care for Tony’s hatred of it; it rolls in minuscule waves of light over his skin anyway, glittering like stars on a wall, and Tony hides his protesting eyes into his pillow. He doesn’t
The only time he’d ever lived with roommates like this was with Rhodey in college, and it kind of brings him back. It’s easy at that point to convert the penthouse area into a common space for everyone. The gym is already set up on the floor below this one, and it’s Iron Man proof, which means it will be Cap proof as well.
Steve’s mouth is rough, though he doesn’t use his teeth. He hollows out his cheeks and takes Tony to the root, nose pressed against the mons, nuzzling the soft padding of tissue there. Pulling off, he gives special attention to Tony’s balls, tonguing them in his mouth and sucking each one gently away from Tony’s body. It’ll slow the impending orgasm that Steve knows is coming.
They make it up to the tower in record time, all six of them eying Loki from his position on the floor.
“Too easy to weaponize, and I don’t deal in weapons. You’re coming to me because you can’t get it to work. You want my help. But once you have it, there’s nothing stopping you from selling it to the highest bidder. And that I won’t be a part of. Thank you for your time, but that’s all I have for you.”
“You gonna hurt me good, Steve? Is that what you want?” Tony cants his ass up, letting Steve’s fingers sink deeper down the fabric, grazing his ass with cold fingernails.
Steve doesn’t disappoint. He sets a punishing pace, knot catching on Tony’s entrance with every pound of his hips. It’s unmaking him. Piece by piece he shatters, his orgasm starting from the base of his cunt and running up through to his own cock. Steve doesn’t stop but rocks him through the orgasm that lasts forever.
“Stark, we have to talk about how we’re going to manage your reveal as Iron Man to the public. You should have talked to us before planning your reveal to the press.” Tony wonders if Fury likes having Captain America as his attack dog for Tony.
Which is, of course, when he hears it. There’s a soft hum moving towards him at breakneck speeds. It becomes a whurr, and he tries to see above the crowd to what might be headed towards him.
It doesn’t even matter that he’s keeping SHIELD agents safe. Steve knows why he said what he said. If only Tony knew how deeply his tendrils went, how much Steve longed to say.
“Steve Rogers, you flatterer. Keep talking that way and find out what happens.” In the sun, Tony’s hair shines with highlights, and his eyes sparkle with levity and hunger. Steve knows that desire is for him, and he hopes he’s mirroring it back to Tony. Maybe everything has burned down around them, but they’re still here, and there’s so much hope.
Before he knows it, he’s at the church, and he’s feeling hopeful. Like he might finally be making progress in the right direction. Maybe if he gets a good working relationship with Tony, Tony will be more amenable to learning things with him, like how to do laundry. Steve had seen the pile of clothing in Tony’s room, unfolded and wrinkled on the floor.
“There’s stuff I need to do for the company that can’t be done in my bedroom! Why are you so unreasonable? I don’t understand what I did to deserve this!”
“You know I was responsible for the death of those agents yesterday, don’t you? I love how you don’t even care anymore.” Steve did care, it just wasn’t enough to keep him away from Tony. And how he hated himself for that. Tony wasn’t shy about claiming lives if they stood in his way. Steve tried to tell himself that Tony didn’t intentionally kill; he killed by what he deemed necessity.
So far he’s met another quiet man named Bruce, two other people who carry themselves like killers, named Natasha and Clint, and a jovial, muscular man who insists that he’s the
“Oh, she’s hard on you honey! But sometimes things are just that way at first, you know? She’ll come ‘round.” Edith had a great laugh, he remembers. She was always cheerful and helped out at church when her alpha would drop her off there. She would sing in the choir. He finds he doesn’t want her to know that the Steve Rogers she knew is the same person. It feels like he started a new life when Erskine gave him the formula, and he doesn’t need to go back to his old one.
Next he rearranges himself over Tony, tucking the pillows around Tony’s body to comfort him. Tony takes the opportunity to hiss at him, reverting to hindbrain Omega coping mechanisms. It’s endearing. He’s going to reward his feral Omega.
He tries to sleep, but he can’t do that when he sees Tony’s tear-stained eyelashes flutter in his sleep and sees how closely guarded Tony keeps his body. As though someone might hurt him.
A $150 budget for clothing was no better than what David had done to stop Angela from living the life she wanted. Her job was respectable, like Tony’s.
“I ate from the same groceries. If what I did with them was more edible than what Tony chose to do with them, that’s not my fault.”
“He didn’t ask for any of those things?” At this point, Steve would be with Tony in that way if that’s what it took. But Tony doesn’t want that. That pricks at his pride, that Tony doesn’t
When he gets to the tower, he’s more collected, but still jittery and disoriented. He looks around at everything Tony has built, all the little pieces of art and furniture. Tony managed all of this on his own.
They’re sealed now, in an incontrovertible bond with one another that no law or force can sever, but for death.
“—shocked and upset that there’s government officials masquerading about while they plow each other secretly—”
His life seems so meaningless in the way it did when he first woke up from the ice. The contract had given him purpose. He was meant to guide Tony and change him for the better. But Steve had never known Tony enough in the first place to know what was better. Nor had he understood that there was never any one kind of ‘true’ omega. All the omegas he’d thought to be models of propriety were nothing but mirages, things he thought he saw when he was young that disappeared the closer you looked.
“On. Now. I won’t ask again before I toss you into the shower.” Natasha will do it, Tony is certain. Begrudgingly, he starts to undress, uncaring that Natasha is watching him closely, as if he can’t possibly dress himself on his own.
They were supposed to be back an hour ago, Natasha and Tony, but they’d commed in that they were held up. When the coms went silent under Bruce’s watch, the other man tried not to make a fuss about it around Steve, but there was a tension to his shoulders that said the situation was serious.
“Would you like a bath sweetheart?” They’re both filthy by this point, and Steve thinks it’s time to rinse off the numerous bodily fluids that coat their bodies.
Barnes to feel what it was like to have someone punch his father in the face so hard that he died. To know what a hand held tightly around his throat felt like, for his mother. Tony is sick with it, the desire to crush everything that Barnes is into
“Judge all you want, Cappy. At this point, we are all going to die. I intend to deserve it.” Which is not really an answer. He needs to play it calm, try to gain this man’s cooperation, his trust. That’s when he opens his big mouth, however.
Eventually, he makes it to Tony’s slick hole. His poor Omega has been oozing wetness for too long without attention, a tiny puddle of sticky slick in his nest. His love is the ideal. All that he’s dreamed of, and he watches Tony’s tight furled hole clench and unclench while it continues to drip. Steve’s going to bond himself to Tony as much as Tony is to him, though he’s already there when it comes to the need to worship Tony’s body.
When their hands touch each other as they draw back the sheet, they both stop for a moment, before Steve curls his fingers around Tony’s, so briefly, before pulling away.
“Are you sure this meeting is right? 8 am?” There were mornings, and then there was Pepper, bright and early at post-sunrise o’clock. His groan into the phone would have been theatrical but for the fact that he’d only gone to bed, no, sleep, a few hours ago. Maybe.
Steve eclipses everything, blotting out the petty insults, the fears Tony had regarding Alphas. Steve subsumes it all, curling Tony’s negative feelings in on themselves until they’re only a writhing mass of pleasure that Tony feels burgeoning underneath his skin. He has a moment of despair before the heat takes him, and he
“It’s not your concern, Tony.” The both of them are as tight as a drum when it comes to the subject of whatever is between them. Neither Bucky nor Steve have given Tony an iota of a clue as to what’s going on. Tony can’t help but let out a long-suffering sigh.
Lunch is a breath of fresh air, and he forgets all about Tiberius. That is, until the next morning when the newspaper announces the murder of Tiberius Stone, and hints at salacious details pertaining to it.
“Ok, ok Tony. I’m leaving.” Steve gets up and walks to the door before turning around to glance at Tony. Tony is staring off into the distance, not paying attention to Steve at all. He turns and leaves, feeling the sting of loss.
When the nuke hits, it smashes a large control ship, the one that he can see in the forefront. Behind it linger many more, but Tony suspects that only one ship has had their soldiers disembark, given the distance. The resulting explosion is enough to push him back, and he closes his eyes.
“Fury is in DC at the moment, I’m here to get you up to speed.” She lays down a file she’d been carrying and opens it up, pushing it towards him. On the very front, it shows a picture of a robot, gleaming with its gold and red panels.
“We do, but we also know he’s an adult and he’s responsible for his own choices. Do you know that, Steve?” Nat drains her mug and places it in the sink before slinking over to stand in front of Steve with her hips cocked to the side.
“Is it possible to do?” Steve has his palms flat on the table, waiting with bated breath to know if this is an option for him. He’s heard of people transitioning to Alpha. A lot of betas give it more than a second thought. But transitioning to Omega? It’s uncommon enough that Steve isn’t sure about it at all. Omegas have more rights than ever, but it doesn’t detract from the fact that there’s still discrimination and even sex-trade issues. Now, Steve is a believer that Alphas aren’t entitled to Omegas. If Tony transitions and he doesn’t want Steve, he’s going to accept that. Maybe not lying down, but he will.
Now that the battle is over, they’re all stuck in a fog of silence, each reviewing what happened that day in their minds. Tony still sees the wormhole, the edges of it so bright blue it burns his eyes as he zones out while staring at the dinged up chairs and tables. The flash of the bomb going off, the pull of gravity at his freezing body as he falls.
The ache inside him increases, until his entire body feels taut with an agonized shift of his reality. He knew Colleen and Brenna. And he realizes now, that somewhere he knew that one day he’d seen them, and then one day he hadn’t. What happened to them? Were they part of the statistics that Nat had told him? Had they died? Did they get out? He wishes his mother hadn’t stopped him from getting to know the omega girls. He’s surprised at himself, however, because he’d never really thought about himself that way concerning the omega women. He was always just Steve, who should have been more. Something else.
“I don’t know where you’ve learned these views, but you’re wrong. And you’re going to kill me with these restrictions.” Tony meets Steve’s eyes then, and they’re begging, pleading with Steve to relent. Steve absolutely cannot, though a part of him wants to so badly. He finds he doesn’t like watching Tony fumble through these rules. All of it is distasteful to him. Yet he resents Tony for making him do this.
Tony opens his mouth and cranes his neck towards Steve’s crotch instinctively, and Steve doesn’t prevaricate, but instead grasps his wet cock and leans in to feed it to Tony’s waiting mouth.
Clint and Natasha are there, each of them trying to wrangle a pig down with their weaponry. Clint’s pig looks like a pin cushion, the skin thick enough to prevent most arrows from going in too deeply.
“It’s like, ever since Sunset and Ty died, I just can’t help but feel like they stole something I can’t get back. Like I’ve wasted all these years not confronting them about it only to miss out on my chance. They’re gone now, and there’ll never be recompense.”
“Ok, let’s do this. Come here blood-bag.” Tony snaps his fingers at Steve. “We don’t have time to separate the antibodies, so you’re going to just hang out and pump some blood to Clint. I’m locking you in, because if it doesn’t work, well, it doesn’t matter if he bites you, does it?”
It’s probably just a deer. Or an ambitious skunk. Oh fuck if it’s a skunk that would be terrible for him.
As he makes his way inside, he plans out what he’s going to do next. First, is dinner. Tony is going to cook for them. And then after, they will delve into Tony’s finances.
He catches her before using the repulsors on full blast to escape the range of the detonation, riding the blast radius out. The suit reads that the temperature is high, but not so high that Pepper will have any burns. He carefully presses her against the suit as he flies, the blasts loud enough to reverberate back his fear for losing Pepper. She could have been standing there, a second ago. Instead she’s safe in his arms, but what about the next time? He knows there will be a next time so long as she’s in his life.
“Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.” Loki is in full medieval garb, carrying his staff like an emotional support weapon. Despite the location and circumstances, Loki looks nervous.
“I don’t need age to know that you’re an asshole. And I know Omegas worth ten of you. The only things you do are for yourself; I’ve read your file. You’re not the guy who makes the sacrifice play. No, you pay people to lay down on the wire for you while you crawl over them.” And that cuts him, deeper than he expected. He’s just— he’s just an Omega.
“I think you know that’s not true Tony. You dodged the spell. And as for authority, I’m usually the one who stands in your way. The one who undermines that authority, every time.” Steve takes a step closer, as Tony steps back on reflex. He must have just realized that he’d done so because Tony then steps forward back into Steve’s space in an attempt to reclaim control. They’re dancing now, using their words to cut at one another, to see where the flesh might part.
“I have you, love. I’ll take care of you. I promise you always. You’re so good, omega. My perfect, sweet boy.” Steve peppers his words and more kisses along Tony’s face, and Tony gasps at the kindness in Steve’s voice. How much it sounds like he means it.
“Sir, it’s a little early.” Rhodey raised his glass to the ceiling, whiskey, neat, at JARVIS’s words.
Steve latches onto the next one, which feels like silk. It ripples in his fingers and he immediately knows that he wants some of this one. But in a blanket or what?
In all the times he’d known Steve, he’d dreamed of this, but he never in his wildest imaginings thought that Steve wanted the same, or that he’d go through with it. And because he can never keep quiet, he opens his mouth to taunt Steve.
He manages to look composed, while the others look on at Loki. He’s so grateful they haven’t noticed. This thing with Steve is freaking him the fuck out, but all he can do right now is keep some distance between them.
“I can’t comment on that. But I think you need to prioritize his health. Is what he’s doing harming himself or someone else?”
“I don’t. Need time,” Steve says, turning on the beam of light that is his winning smile onto Tony. The shiny white and shape of those teeth should be illegal in all 50 states of America.
Steve has already been in him so many times, but he treats each time as though it was the first, teasing and stroking, drowning Tony in sensation. He feels each touch more keenly than the last, the slide of Steve’s cock against the seam of him an unhinging of his person.
“So you’ve been waiting for me, is that it darlin’?” Tony turns over to his stomach before hitching up his hips, exposing his ass for Steve.
Steve spits into his own hand this time and twirls it around the head of his cock before pinching the head to aim itself at Tony’s hole. It’s puffy and winking at him now, and he presses himself to it, slipping past the tight circle of muscle before he’s in Tony, finally. Tony is groaning and squeezing him, his hands pulling his knees back to open himself even more to the assault that Steve is starting to make on him.
They go on like this in silence for about ten minutes before Natasha pulls into a nondescript building.
“Shh, Tony, let me take you. Gonna treat you so well. Mate you, fill you.” Tony quiets and waits for Steve to use him, take him, make him his.
Tony’s hitting him now, fists clenched and striking at his chest, upwards towards Steve’s face. Steve hooks his feet over Tony’s writhing legs, pinning his shins down with his strength. He snatches one wrist, then the second, pressing them down next to Tony’s head.
“Lights fifty percent.” And he waits. He listens for the soft swish of the doors to the elevator opening and closing. He hears the tinkling of keys on the counter. He notes the footsteps that move so quietly down the hallway.
Thankfully, everyone is kept out while he seizes in the hospital bed, teeth grinding against a mouth guard until his jaw aches. They pump him full of sedatives and anti-inflammatories as they tsk over his bold stupidity.
They’ve left the Avengers Quinjet, though he doesn’t know how they got away otherwise. He’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
He imagines JARVIS operating the cameras to get a good view for Steve, and he shudders, body undulating in pleasure as it skates down his spine and up to his head before he lets that drop down. His fingers are probing, testing the area and just barely starting to penetrate his sphincter. He wants to tease himself, wants to draw this out, even though his body recognizes all the signs and is open for Steve.
The diner they find is small and covered in broken glass. The owners are an older couple who are already working on cleaning up the floor. After they’re welcomed inside, they all sit at two tables pushed together with chairs at either end. Tony deliberately picks a seat far away from Cap. One next to Thor who probably can’t tell by scent that Tony is an Omega. Yes, everyone knows, but they don’t need to smell him; that’s totally gross. He can’t currently scent Steve from his place either. He feels a push and pull to go near the man, but the instincts he’s learned since Afghanistan tell him to stay away at all costs.
Slowly, he was pushed back, up to his knees, backward, until he gently fell onto his ass, legs spread before Steve, Steve still mouthing at his lips, his kissing turned languorous, a liquid heat spreading from the focal point of Steve’s touch all the way down to Tony’s cunt.
“You know, White Zombie of 1930s fame? Its sequel? Not ringing any bells in that blond head of yours? You really did miss a lot of culture. Don’t worry, I got you. I’ll bring some things for you to read shortly.” Tony starts to scurry off, and Steve calls out to him to stop him from leaving. Steve doesn’t want to be alone, he realizes.
“Security Breach. It’s on you.” Tony’s brows furrow at how JARVIS’s protocol could be overridden. He takes a swig of champagne in preparation for whatever it might be that caused Fury to set the hounds on Tony’s life.
Steve gets back to the tower feeling like a used towel. The stink of fear of the omegas he met clings to him like a bad cologne. Raped omegas, coerced omegas, scared omegas. All the things his instincts cry out to fix. His thoughts linger on Angela, whose alpha controlled their finances with such an iron fist, that the money she earned was something she was never allowed to touch.
he’s not an old man anymore. Not that Steve’s jawline didn’t look equally cutting when he was ninety-five, and Tony is not ashamed to say he could be attracted to an older man. Besides, Extremis would have fixed that. But look, he doesn’t even have to do anything and Captain America is back to being Captain Handsome!
Tony feels stricken by her announcement. He’s been so set on hating his biology, that he never reckoned what it would be like to be given the choice to be without it, completely. Removing his uterus wouldn’t make him less Omega, but the loss of his glands would have stunted him. It would be like removing a limb.
But Tony is far from apathetic or angry. He’s so pleased he wants to text Steve right then. His smile turns into an outright grin as he leans back in the chair, imagining what Steve will do when he gets ahold of Tony next time.
“You know, one of the most damning books for omegas created in 1848 was Advice to Young Omegas on Their Duties and Conduct in Life. It details that omegas should be homemakers, relegated to cooking, cleaning, and pleasing their alpha counterparts. That omegas are to be cherished and stewarded, not allowed their head to take up jobs or gather influences outside the home, unless they’re with other omegas.”
Steve nods at Tony and stares at him for a moment before tossing his leg over the side of his motorcycle. Tony doesn’t wait for him to rev up before putting his own car into gear.
“You wouldn’t happen to have a tri-cyclic ten capacity transregulator, would you?” There are no small parts, just parts that aren’t nearly as important as other parts. A tri-cyclic ten capacity transregulator is one of those important parts that they cannot do without. Tony’s tried building one himself, but it’s not like he has a fabricator and endless supplies of cash. These suckers aren’t cheap either.
Tony knows he’s the better version of himself. The spell that was used to change his so-called alignment was just a tool to open the door for Tony to be his most effective. And he is the best. What it hasn’t changed, is his deep-seated desire for Captain America. For example his former self, the weaker and less capable Tony, had never done a single thing to impinge on his friendship with Steve Rogers. He’d kept his pathetic school girl crush to himself and practically ate his self-esteem.
Soon, Steve rolls them, Tony a preciously cupped thing between Steve’s legs, spooned against the warmth of his body. Steve reverently runs his hands along Tony’s flanks, fingers tracing aimless patterns up and down.
Steve stares across the couch and the bar at Tony. The man isn’t a shadow of what he once was, but his priorities are woefully misaligned. Steve is here to fix that. Steve is here to fix everything. Because otherwise? What a waste.
Steve pulls out the brick shaped phone that they gave him and dials Fury’s number. As he waits for the doctor to show up, he stands sentry at the foot of the bed, unable to move. He’s put the covers back on Tony, which has helped with the smell, but now that it’s in his nose, it’s impossible to forget or remove.
If he was unlucky, he’d trigger a corresponding rut in the Alpha. Which meant if the Alpha stepped into the room, and Tony didn’t like him, it may not matter at all. They’d have to bang no matter what. Biology really was a fucking cunt.
“My suits are an investment. Everything related to business is already paid for by the company. Next.” Tony waves him off flippantly, and Steve’s anger curdles inside his stomach. He’s trying to remain composed, but Tony’s dismissiveness bites at him, chews through his fine self-control. It doesn’t help that he can scent the man across the table. It’s so good. Too good.
Tony’s mouth is on his then, for the briefest of moments, and Steve chases it when Tony pulls away, much to the Omega’s delight.
Steve steps forward and reaches out for Tony’s face. He wants to kiss Tony, but he’s not sure if the other man will let him. But Tony surprises him and steps forward, letting his chin rest on Steve’s outstretched hand.
Steve is a flurry of kicks and punches, hands and bare feet becoming as bloody as the mass around him, but it’s not enough. They go for his legs, his shoulders, everywhere. There’s only so fast he can move, and he doesn’t have his shield.
It’s been a long time since he’s done confession, but he probably should. He needs advice, guidance that he knows a priest can give him. Ever determined, he gets up and heads towards the old style confessional booths that sit off to the side. The wood of it is dark and old, and deeply carved crosses rest on the sides. He pulls the door shut and sits down. He feels at ease here, and the memories of being a young boy telling the priest about the fights he’d gotten into rise to the surface.
“Give it to me. Give it back to me, Steve.” His breath is heavy, like puffs of wind over a discontent sea as he gazes up at Steve. Their arms are slung around each other in lazy satisfaction as Tony begins to mouth at Steve, like a baby animal hoping to be fed from its parent’s mouth. Steve obliges him with peppered kisses and the sweet marrow of what he’s done for Tony.
They fly over the city, and Tony feels the love that Steve described for it. It’s their home, their people, in a way that can never be taken from them. They’ve defended New York and the world from the onslaught of aliens bent on destruction, and they’d do it again in a heartbeat. The love Tony feels emanating from his chest goes out towards this city and the people in it and amplifies what he feels for Steve and even the other Avengers.
“Fuck.” He gets hit with a particularly rough thrust between his legs, and he feels fur tickle at his back. The wolf rocks back and forth, fucking itself onto Tony. Tony tries not to think about what the wolf’s dick must look like, or whether it’s getting off at all.
As Fury relays all the information they’ll need to suit up, Tony gazes up at his partner, his lover, his soulmate. They can say that there’s no truth to it, no higher meaning, but Tony
Tony arches his neck to the side, allowing access, and begins to purr with pleasure. Steve drags his hand down Tony’s back and grabs at the swell of Tony’s ass, dimpling the skin and pulling at his rim again. It’s pink and glistening, and Steve leans down to lap at it, letting the analgesic from his saliva take care of the sting. He fucks his tongue in while Tony lets off a long and low moan, and Steve pries the tip of his tongue in, forcing it past the taut muscle.
“Where are you Tony? Come back.” Steve says, his weight pressing down harder on Tony, if that were possible. If only it could have been uncomfortable, but instead Tony watches as Steve licks his own finger, and swipes it down the glands behind Tony’s left ear, giving Tony the most lovely shiver of
“Oh no. People are random and pointless. But these people, they have the right to lead their aimless lives to the fullest of indiscriminate events that simply occur to them. Which you want to prevent. So, I’m here to threaten you.” He meanders down to Loki, keeping his cool.
Time flies when you’re this close to freaking out, Tony thought when he heard the door handle rattle.
“No Steve, I just fucked up a little. I need someone to walk me to a clinic, make sure nothing happens in the meantime.”
The needle slides in without resistance into Tony’s neck, his face slackening as his eyes take on a sheen of wetness, their depths darkening as the pupils distend and the irises shrink. Tony doesn’t topple, but his limbs fall off the sides of the chair, his head lolling back as he looks at Steve.
Right now, he’s glaring morosely down at the breakfast he’s made. There’s too much of it, because in hoping beyond hope, he thought Tony would come up this morning and he could at least feed him. His chest feels tight with sorrow, his arms slack at his sides in defeat.
“Thank god.” Tony leans over to rest his hands on his knees, out of breath, and still running high on adrenaline. His limbs quake with exertion, and he can feel his body shiver with exhaustion.
“Relaxed? Me?” Tony cocks his head at Nat, who stares back at him with her usual closed-off expression. The silence stretches, and Steve stops his preparation of pancakes, willing Nat to say something.
The police moved in at that point and started loading the bodies of the pigs onto trailers. Iron Man dropped down and started to help lift, and Steve shook his head from his thoughts and started to help as well.
“I never knew what it was like. I was too sick for heats, so I never had to marry or spend them alone. My mom kept me sheltered. I see that now. I never talked to the other omegas. I wasn’t like them.”
“Looks like you got quite the haul. A nesting pad? Interesting. I’ve never made a nest before, but this looks good. Oh, and uh, I’ll need some things scented by you, if you wouldn’t mind sleeping with a blanket and some pillows from here.”
“Saint Anne, Mary’s mother. The patron saint of omegas.” He looks at the statue’s outstretched hands, the fingers of each curling in a gesture of conciliation. And if that isn’t what omegas are always doing, keeping alphas from hurting them or other people.
“Well, he’s not dead.” Clint is lounging on the couch in the dining room. Steve has made sure that Tony isn’t there for this initial confrontation. It’s the least he can do to ensure his mate isn’t embarrassed by questions from people who might not be genuinely concerned. He couldn’t opt to protect Tony from himself, but he will make sure no one else in this world upsets his Omega. His most precious possession.
“As I said, I’m not the man you think I am, but everything he ever did, every memory, every moment, I carry it inside me. I know every thought he ever had about you. He loved you. Even when you fought.” Steve’s own heart pounds with the surge of battle, every muscle corded tightly in wait for assault. Just a little closer.
Steve is once again overwhelmed with information. He never thought that things were this bad for omegas. He should have known. He just had never felt like an omega himself because he’d never had heats.
“Tony.” It’s Bucky. Fuck, of course, it’s one of the people on his mind. It’s like he’s calling them to him with his fucked up thoughts.
Maybe Tony was always meant to be an Omega. It’s possible something happened in the womb. He wouldn’t have put it past Howard to give his Omega wife a sufficient dose of hormones to ensure the designation of his child. He’s heard stories of it not being as good of an idea in practice, but if anyone could have worked that out, it would have been Howard.
“This is urgent.” It sounds that way, but does SHIELD have to call their favor in right now? Right this very second?
“Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Oh, fuck, Steve, are you serious? You’re serious. Yes!” He jumps up and down as Steve chuckles and rises from the ground, ring in hand. The ring barely matters to Tony as he sees Steve with new eyes, the eyes of a fiancé, someone who will be with Steve for life. They’ll marry, and bond, and spend the rest of their life being good to the other, saving the world and being with their family. All of the Avengers seem to be smiling harder, if that’s even a possibility. Tony retracts the hand of the suit and Steve, who is shining as though he’s the sun, takes Tony’s hand and slides the ring home. Belonging has always been something Tony has struggled with, but today that pain is a distant memory, something that no longer belongs to him. Instead, he’s wrapped up in the safety and love of one Steve Rogers.
“Steve.” It’s a whisper on his lips as Tony draws himself in, his hands now resting at Steve’s waist like parenthesis, exerting enough force to rub them together like two matchsticks, their bodies ready for the flame. With Steve’s neck tilted back, Tony tucks his face into the curve there, his breath a breeze on Steve’s skin.
“If you had an ounce of respect, it would change.” Steve’s eyes are a dark blue, and he looms above Tony now, arms crossed in a defensive position. If anyone needs defending, it’s Tony.
Tony can hear a high pitched, long whine. It’s him, he knows it’s him, and he bites down on the words that want to come streaming out of his mouth. He’s given enough of his shame to Steve that he refuses to give one more inch over to the man. Steve is hunched over him now, teeth to Tony’s skin, so close to his glands, a fierce ache settling into his used body that zings up from his ass to his neck.
Steve collects himself. Tony’s threats are blaring in his mind, but he did come down here with intentions.
Even a hint of what awaits them is appealing. It tells Steve that Tony will be happy with him, that he’ll want him as his Alpha.
And god yes, Tony is absolutely receptive. He wants it more than oxygen, more than the manic feelings he gets when he’s creating. The tenterhooks he’s hanging on feel flimsy, ready to toss his self-control away with the breeze.
“I’d ask you to put on that suit of yours, go a few rounds, but you’re too much of a coward for that.”
Steve plops a newspaper in front of Tony instead as he shuffles around the kitchen preparing breakfast. Rolling with it, Tony picks up the news and spies something that might be interesting under the second fold. He flips it open to look, and staring back at him is Aldrich Killian, found dead in his penthouse early this morning by his assistant. The article is scant on details, but it’s already making Tony’s blood run cold.
“So, what brings you to Delta-5? The stunning cuisine and entertainment?” This place is a shit hole, as is every unregulated hole-in-the-wall waystation they’ve stopped at. Being in Kree space means they need to stay off the radar and out of slaver’s hands. At least here there’s some amount of rules that keep places like this flowing. Kidnapped clientele is just bad for business. Those whose business, Tony doesn’t exactly know or care to find out. He’s just glad he doesn’t have to worry so much.
He can’t hold on, not with Tony stretched tight around him, the pink rim gripping with each extraction of his length. Reaching around, he grasps Tony’s cock and starts gently twisting it from base to head and down again. Tony howls into the bed and erupts onto Steve’s hand as Steve follows him, bottoming out and filling Tony up as deep as he can. He wants his cum leaking out of Tony for hours.
“Steve if I’m not sitting on that cock in a minute I’m going to scream so loud.” Steve chuckles and realizes he has already been too cruel, and he lines up his already fattening cock towards Tony’s clenched hole. When his head touches it, it winks invitingly at him, a wash of slick leaking out. Fuck, Tony is ready, and Steve has been holding back from the thing he wants the most for so long.
His Extremis will never end and he’ll always be in peak fighting condition, his skin blemish-free, and the rest of his body as eternally youthful as he can look while still aging.
“He’s in every part of the tower, including your room, but only if you ask him to be. You can ask him for anything you need. He’ll tell you to the best of his ability. Like, you don’t have to constantly check on me in the workshop. JARVIS knows. Not that I don’t love when you bring me food, but sometimes your loitering outside the door gives me hives.”
Tony barely notices Steve walk over and plop himself on the couch until the man is right next to him, breathing the same air.
“Later, if you want to get tears on my shirt, I’ll let you.” Steve sits down where Aldrich was and rubs his glands on the arms of the chair, scenting it as Steve’s. His husband does everything right. It helps ease everything. He’s overwhelmed with how grateful he is, how maybe some other alpha would be agitated having their life guided by their omega, but Tony, he’s built for it. He’s built for love like this. Without Steve, there would be no home to defend, no reason for the work. He’d have let things like Sunset and Ty consume him a long time ago. Steve is the only reason he can now take those difficult things and try to bury them. Even if they still sting.
“We need Tony for the rest of it. I think it’s ready to aerosolize.” While Steve is proud that Tony is a part of the cure, he’s also on tenterhooks regarding his lover. He’s hoping beyond hope that Tony’ll be fine. He has to be fine.
“It’s been over twenty minutes. I don’t know how he’s still here and hanging on, but we’ve got to get antibodies in him,
“Look at you! Pure Irish Catholic boy you are. Well, son, that beautiful girl told me to tell you about where and when I grew up, which was on Hicks and Pierrepont, right near this apartment called Leigh Place. We lived in the apartment next door. Never had a name put to it besides the Old Pierrepont place. The new one was across the street.” Steve’s blood runs cold and hot. Leigh Place is where he grew up. He estimates this woman to be about ninety years old, her skin that fine almost feathered look with a smattering of liver spots. She was around him in his earlier life. There, when he lived in Brooklyn. As he studies the contours of her face, he sees them morph into one of youth. He remembers her now, leashed up behind her alpha, smiling. She was beautiful then, docile and sweet like omegas should be.
“You know, Fury had this idea for us, called the Avengers, where we’d save the world. And you know I thought that man was crazy and seeing things with his one eye. But here we are, saving the world from a survivalist’s wet dream, and we’re all together as Fury wanted. So maybe he was right, but don’t you dare tell him that if he’s still alive.” They’re sitting on the balcony of the Tower overlooking the city. Even the fires and smoke that’s still coating the sky looks cheery with the mood they’re in. Everything is going to be ok.
“Look, just stop approving of me. You’re ruining it.” He gets up and leaves before Steve can dismiss him. Rogers always hates that. It gives Tony a little thrill.
Peggy is a distant memory, but the loss of control over his fate with her lingers. He’s over her, but he’s not over the helplessness. Helping Bucky fix that yawning need inside him to make things right. But now there’s no Winter Soldier to hunt, and finally, Bucky is starting to act like his old self again. This is supposed to be the life he’d bargained for, lied to Tony for. What more is there? There must be something.
Tony finally stops arching his back and collapses back to the bed, sweat-stained and exhausted. Steve pulls off and out, and immediately brings his fingers to his mouth.
Steve leans over and gently kisses Tony’s pliant, willing mouth. Everyone will know that Tony was with Steve during his heat. The scent will carry with Tony wherever he goes, and it’s a comfort to Steve, that Tony will smell like him. More, it’s outright possessiveness at the thought of everyone knowing that Tony rode
“Fuck, no, that’s– no. Steve, please. Not this way.” Begging is gratifying, especially from his untamed Omega. Steve is looking forward to hearing his pleas more often, in a different capacity.
They all bow their heads over Tony’s bed as they wait. His wounds look puffy now, the blood cleaned off by Nat while Bruce has wiped down Tony’s face. But they all know that recovery is almost a certainty at this point. If Clint’s progress is to be believed.
He thinks the man’s suit needs a complete makeover though, maybe from the guys on Queer Eye, who would likely be rendered insensate by lust. Because even in those basic bitch colors, Captain America is all Alpha. Tony wondered how much dye went into making his leather utility belt blue and why they used a seat belt buckle. What a waste. Didn’t the Captain study American history where we shot at Brits who wore garish uniforms like fish in a barrel? Well, it still didn’t stop him from wanting to run his hands over Cap’s abs to see if they felt like the topography of a map.
“Should we go help rebuild them? It’d put SHIELD in your debt.” He’s wheedling, he knows, but he loves to get Tony riled about things. The man is ever so animated when he’s ranting. Steve thinks Tony knows he’s being baited and does not care in the slightest.
Soon Tony has Steve’s pants removed as well, and they both spend time breathing in the musk and sweat of one another. It’s Tony’s scent that contains traces of metal, like hot steel and solder. Tony moves first, leg hitching up and over Steve’s hips while taking Steve into his mouth in one long gulp, his cock bypassing a non-existent gag reflex as the head constricts in Tony’s throat.
“Tony.” Just one word, and he glances up at Steve before he examines the rest of the Avengers. They’re acting like they’re not paying attention, but Tony swears this is their weekly entertainment.
“Omega. Sweet, perfect, lovely omega. You want my knot sweetheart? You’re still so tight, want to fill you right up again until it spills over.”
They’re all silent, grieving, as Steve begins to shake Tony less gently, imploring his lover to wake up, to come back.
Tony rights himself, and looks at Steve, suspicion writ on his face. It makes Steve feel the terrible weight of how he’s hurt Tony before. He wants so badly for Tony to trust him, so he holds out a blueberry like an offering to him. Instead of snatching it, Tony leans forward, eyes still discerning, and takes it with his lips, twining his tongue around Steve’s fingers and sucking the berry into his mouth.
It’s then that Sam’s serious expression cracks, and the tiny upward tilt of his lips is like a blessing. Just because Tony can survive without Sam’s approval doesn’t mean he
When it’s all set up, he spends the majority of the time he’s at his apartment in the nest itself, scenting the pillows on his glands as he coats every square inch of fabric in his own smell. Tony will need it when he’s here, the calm from an Alpha’s scent neutralizing the inherent fear of new surroundings.
“What is there to know? How, since at any point in the past three years since the Triskelion incident you could've told me? No, I’m fucking done with this.” Tony showers Steve in repulsor energy, the shield bouncing each beam back, some sliding harmlessly past while others push him back up into a wall. Steve is there then, shield in hand.
His pants and underwear feel rough over his length, but it’s oh so good to have someone, anyone, especially Steve, touch him at all. As it stands, he’s about halfway ready to orgasm off of the bare minimum of what Steve is doing. And Steve, oh, fucking Steve, he’s drawing the fine bones of his fingers in a slight curve over the ridge of Tony’s cock, feeling every little contour up like the man wants to commit it to memory.
Tony shucked his tight-fitting shorts off in half a second, before sprawling back to let Steve kiss his chest.
“Wanna see you cry. Wanna hear you beg me.” Tony has already given as much as he can possibly give. There isn’t more to say. He just wants Steve to stop. It fucking hurts so badly, and he thinks he’s bleeding. It’s even more humiliating that through the ache and stinging, it feels so good. His body opens up to Steve, taking it and taking it.
“It’s like that Steve. I’m sorry. I didn’t realize that when you touched them it would feel so—so good.”
“That’s not up to you.” Natalie smoothly slid into the booth with Director Fury, their ease with one another apparent. Of course the government would have access to any kind of scent they wanted.
“Yeah, I’ll make that pasta you like. I picked up some shrimp earlier today anyway.” The alpha ruffles her hair a bit as she ducks away from it.
“But is it normal for him to go into a coma?” Natasha is exuding quiet nervousness, and Steve recognizes the fine-tuned control she must have to keep her pain off her face.
, oh god. Tony lets out a tremulous sigh and groans. Steve was rubbing everywhere, hands buried in feathers and wrapped around the delicate bones of the base of his wings. So powerful, Steve could snap them off at the ends, but he holds them with such tenderness, Tony knows Steve will never hurt him.
“Tony, you are an omega. That is what you are. And omegas are designed to correspond specifically to alphas. We protect, you nurture. We go to work, you take care of the home. This is not difficult to understand.” Steve didn’t think that Tony could get colder, but he looks positively frigid now, his eyes a tundra of unsaid things. Tears are standing in the corners of his eyes, but they don’t fall, and Tony looks like he’s not going to speak at all. But he does anyway, with a look of long-suffering patience.
"I, Tony, take thee, Steve, to be my wedded husband.” The justice starts. Tony is staring off into space, hands fiddling with something in his pockets.
“You’re welcome, Rogers. You don’t deserve him, but if he wants to give you a chance, then we can too.”
“Oh! Excellent. The team has already gone through the C section and should have digitized all those. Let’s go bother them and see what we can find.” The priest darts down another aisle of filing cabinets and leads him back to a room. He can hear laughter inside and as the door opens, he’s hit with the scents of a few omegas and maybe a beta. No alphas.
“To continue, Tony is going to want everything to be normal. You may feel the need to pull him aside, assure him that you’ll treat him just the same. Do that. I’m not here to take him away from the team or anyone else,” Steve says.
“He’s got about twenty minutes. Stark, give me something.” Natasha looks at Tony, demand evident on her features. She isn’t going to take no for an answer. Tony balks and looks at Bruce.
That was all it took for Steve. The man launched himself at Tony, knees hitting the ground hard before he snatched a fistful of Tony’s hair and pulled him in for a bruising kiss.
“Oh looks like we have that one too. Married 1936, and it looks like—Ah, there we are. And, ah well, yes this is another common thing.”
“It’s ok, you know. To be Omega and a hero.” They’re sitting on the couches after Clint has gone to bed. Star Trek is playing on the TV and everyone else is otherwise occupied elsewhere or asleep. She tosses what remains of the popcorn into her mouth as she eyes him up.
Before Afghanistan, it’d been about fifteen years for Tony. He could acknowledge that maybe that hadn’t been the right play. Now, he couldn’t put his body off for much longer.
The tower is a steel monument to Tony, and Steve thinks the sharp angles and modern lines are synonymous with the way Tony hides himself in the minutiae of what he creates. Somewhere between those contours is Tony, waiting. Tony must be as lonely as Steve is. The man exhibits all the classic signs of social deprivation, isolation. Steve understands this, has understood it, and now it’s drawing him in like a magnet, all these things that are wrong with Tony. That could be fixed just by just a few pills.
He shouldn’t think of Tony in that way, but there’s something about the defiance he exhibits that while agitating his beliefs, it gets under his skin in another way. He has to admit to himself that he wants Tony. It’s hard for him to do that, because when he opens that door, that makes his duty all the harder. How can he enforce necessary rules if he’s busy wanting Tony to like him?
No one had ever successfully dodged the law, until Tony, as far as he knew. It was next to impossible to hide the scent of an omega in heat.
“I’m here for you on behalf of the Church and Christ. I have to say I never expected to hear from you.”
This isn’t happening. Thousands of scents, of alphas, and a fucking intelligence agency, a cabal of spies, happens to have the right one. The equivalent of Tony finding a soul mate, but for sexing.
One hand firmly placed in the middle of his back, Steve keeps shucking. Tony has no idea what’s happening. Maybe Steve is going to kill him out of his armor. Maybe he’s going to beat Tony’s chest or back in, leaving him broken on the floor. The simple truth is, that he has no power here, except what Steve gives him.
“Hey, stop scheming. I’m not getting together with whoever it is. It’s just sex and that’s it. Now can I get a drink?” They were still looking at each other, eyes all faux innocence and things they thought they knew about Tony.
"Peter told us he accidentally sat on his glasses. Why wouldn't he have told us he was getting bullied? He knows how I feel about bullies." Steve hummed in thought. "We need to ask him what he'd want to do first, though. Find a compromise before we just pull him out of school."
"You're not greedy, baby. This is something normal for siblings." He explained. "Especially newer ones. But trust me when I say that I am trying my best to give you both attention."
He grinned, moving his hands up to gently play with Steve's nipples. Steve purred gently at Tony's touch, trailing his hands along the other's sides and resting on his hips.
The little click of the door unlocking was a bit of a surprise, but he gave Peter the chance to get away from the door, stepping in and closing the door behind him. Tony crossed his arms, rubbing a hand over his face.
Hung upside down from the ceiling in a tangle of cords, the engineer grinned sheepishly, still trying to kick off his rocket boots.
"Mhm. He found a paper of mine I wrote back in the nineties," Tony chuckled, putting an arm around them both, "I still have it in the attic somewhere, with my other research papers. I'll let him have those while he's on computer probation, try to cheer him a little."
"Then I won't stop touching until you tell me too, Steve." the engineer assured, trailing gentle fingers along Steve's abdomen. "I want to make you feel good."
"So...?" Steve answered back with a smirk of his own and a raise of a brow as he slowly worked his ways closer to Tony.
"The bandaids is for your booboos." Peter explained softly. "I got Transformers cuz you like wobots 'n princesses cuz I thought it'd be funny." He said with a little giggle.
Steve smiled back fondly at the praise, taking a bite of the meal himself. It was certainly different from raw fish, the cream sauce and lemon giving the fish a different taste than what he has tried before. It wasn't half bad cooked this way, he thought.
Tony whined in his sleep, hands fisting into Steve's shirt. He moaned softly, pressing his hips up into Steve's hand.
Steve sighed, relaxing against Tony's body and trying to keep small movement so he didn't wake the others.
The boy nodded and gently took one of the sandwiches from Steve, nibbling on it before happily settling back into Tony's chest.
. Had his robe on, was pretending to drink coffee, tried to stay up late and work. Heck, he even said things that sounded like stuff you'd say."
Steve eyed him carefully, slowly letting go of the griddle when he felt Peter had a good hold on it.
"Howdy, Prince Charming," Tony rolled his eyes, stealing a quick kiss before grabbing his favorite mug, "Little bug should be down in a minute, he's finishing primping."
"No, sir... I won't do it again." Peter murmured as he leaned up. He kept his head down as he stood, stopping in front of his father quietly.
"Steve. I will buy you a baby doll if you cannot wait," Tony tried to keep a serious look on his face, only to dissolve into giggles. "Okay, okay, maybe not, but still. You'll get all that baby time in in the classes we're gonna take. Right?"
"If you stop looking like my dick is still up your ass, then yes," Tony said with a laugh, pressing kisses over Steve's face and chest, "I'm kidding, I'm
"Perhaps I should send Howard down here. The air would do him wonders, don't you think? He'll love the disrespect you treat his son and his employees."
"Mhm. That's what I thought. You're having naptime today, young man," Tony murmured, reaching up to pet Peter's hair.
"It’s not whatever, baby. You are so great, and I will always tell you that." Steve soothed, hugging Tony close. "So don't ever think that I'll think bad of you, love."
Peter just nodded and kept doodling, tongue poking out of his mouth. Rolling his eyes, Tony stood back up, going back to the kitchen to make a snack. Steve watched as Tony left. He'd follow if he didn't need to keep an eye on their boy. Instead he smiled over at Peter cheekily.
Tony's briefs were long gone, letting himself curl onto Steve's body for a moment, preening under the skin to skin contact.
"You must be real excited if you're willing to take a bath." Steve chuckled, petting Peter's hair. "We want him to come home, too. And soon he can meet the rest of his family."
"Nothing wrong with being a sap." Steve admitted, nuzzling Tony sweetly and leaving small kisses on the man's face. "Mmm...I didn't get to kiss you at all during our escapade."
"I am now." The man replied, setting his tea down and scribbling away on his notepad. He turned to look back at Tony, giving him an affirmative nod to proceed.
He brushed past Bucky to find Clint, not surprised that Natasha took his bag while he melted into the man's arms.
He swayed his hips while he walked to the kitchen, dancing Peter around the room till he set him on his booster seat.
"Gladly." Steve murmured back, thrusting his fingers in and out of Tony. He undid his pants, relieving some of the pressure from hearing all the brunet's noises.
"Don't tell me to listen right now! You know we aren't supposed to interact with humans in any way, shape, or form!".
"Um, my husband came in a bit ago with our son who was having a severe allergic reaction to shrimp?"
"I was thinking the same. We'll save water showering together, I'm sure." He grinned contently. "What do you think?"
“Maybe," Steve grinned, adjusting to make Tony more comfortable. "Eventually you'll get a chance to find them all. Eventually."
"If...if you're really sure about this." Steve said nervously. Hell, he couldn't even bring himself to spank Peter, and now Tony was wanting it. He had to shake his head, driving the thoughts away and starting up on the swats.
"Maybe later I can make up for what happened another way. Right before bed so you're nice and relaxed." He hummed in thought, running his fingers through Tony's hair to fix it.
"I bet. The Romanoffs- the Famous Romanoffs- have been gone for decades. This is... Tony, thank you." She said softly, admiring the nesting dolls.
He went on to explain about how the teen got his powers, how he decided to become Spiderman, an eventually reached how he met up with Iron Man and Captain America.
"I don't know, just go with it," Tony whispered back, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist, "And you're not hurting my legs. You've straddled them many,
"Wanna finish the mural?" Tony suggested, kissing his cheek, "Or did you have something else in mind?"
Already snuck out of his bed and over to the nursery, Peter quietly slid the bars down on the crib and helped Sammy out, tugging the sleepy baby into his arms, only to turn around and stare up at Steve, like a deer caught in the headlights
"How come you 'n Papa is always kissin' like dat?" Peter asked curiously as he was being brought upstairs. "Those is diff'ent kissies."
"Essentially." Steve reiterated. "It’s because you are the starter of making things naughty." Steve grinned, waggling his eyebrows playfully.
"Hey, munchkin. You had us scared there. You feeling a little better now?" Steve asked Peter softly, smoothing the boy's bangs.
"For however long it takes your brother to come out." Steve said with a chuckle. "So it'll be a while, bubba."
"We might take you up on that, Stark," Clint whistled, pulling Bucky and Nat to his sides, "You best keep the black lights away, though."
"Fuck," he gasped, whirling around to grab onto Steve, "They're sedating him right now, behind the curtain, he'll be okay--"
Tony mumbled back in his sleep, unconsciously snuggling up into Steve. They slept soundly through the night surprisingly enough, Tony curled into Steve and Steve curled around Tony, just enjoying the other's warmth and comfort.
Once he heard Steve go up the steps, Peter grabbed his paint kit out from under his bed, quietly sneaking down to the living room to paint a masterpiece: on the wall. And white couch. And rug.
"Auntie Peggy?" Peter asked, tugging on Peggy's shirt lightly. "Why was Papa cryin' then?" He asked curiously, batting his eyelashes up at her.
"Yes, yes, very smooth, mister touchy," Tony grinned, "If this is the response I get, I'm definitely shaving more often." He preened under Steve's touch, sighing happily.
Steve happily scooped Peter up, bringing him into the kitchen and setting him in his booster seat. He got them all a small glass of milk and a couple of cookies, still warm but not too warm.
, Rogers." Tony drawled, "But you are correct. I'll have Miss Carter give Sam a ring to ask which morgue Wade is being stored at, and we'll have a look."
"When we do that, the goal is to make you feel good. And that didn't wind up happening." He said softly.
Tony was up and about already; Clint's screaming had done its trick to wake him up. He was showered and dressed, bed made, room picked up--with a sigh, Tony sat down at his desk chair, putting his feet up.
"It's doesn't, but you'd look sexy," Tony muttered, "Now shut up and help me get these pajamas off you."
"C'mere," Tony held his arms up, hefting the boy up onto the bed and into his lap, "You okay, sweetie? Feeling okay?" He pressed a hand against Pete's forehead. "You're not warm, that's good."
Steve smacked Tony's arm slightly. "As much as you may like it, please don't use that word." Steve scolded gently, burying his face into Tony's neck.
"You sound so pleased with yourself." He answered, light pink creeping up his cheeks. "That'll change. Anymore you'd like to own up to, Anthony?"
"Before you ask, Peter wanted to play Tattoo Parlor and give me tattoos." Steve explained with a grin as Peter drew a heart with an arrow through it on his forearm.
He pulled Steve up to draw him into a kiss, licking his own taste from the blond's mouth. The blond hummed with want into the kiss, lip slightly pink and swollen from their activity prior. Steve moved his tongue with Tony's, panting gently when they had parted.
"Yeah," he grumbled, tucking his head against Steve's neck, "I can't reach m'favowite shirt, ish too high up in m'dwawer."
Steve blinked at him for a split second. First he takes the lead being all angry, then he totally flips it? Didn't make much sense to him sometimes, but that's how Tony operated. He used one hand to pin Tony's arms above his head as he worked at the man's jawline. His other hand slipped under Tony's shirt to play with the nipple rings gently.
"Whoa, hey, c'mon! I was just trying to find someone! You don't need to do that!" Tony squeaked, backing away slowly and falling back on the ground.
"Of course, sir," Tony breathed, putting his arms up. He squirmed under Steve's touch, bucking up into his hand. "Sorry sir," he murmured, a smirk forming on his lips.
"You make me feel safe and at home, like you're a best friend I've had since preschool. You make me happy just being you and make me smile when I think of you." He explained gently. "You're one of the best things to happen to me. And I know I sound like a sap, but what do ya do?"
"I know, I know, shhh, it’s okay, you're gonna be fine, just a few more minutes," Tony soothed, more to his own nerves.
"As long as you know what to do--" Steve joked, giving Tony a dopey grin when their lips parted. He gave Tony one more quick kiss before heading to the wall.
He bust out in a fit of laughter, reaching up to clap a hand over his mouth, silently thanking his stars that Steve wasn’t treating him like he was weak.
"I'll tell 'em you partied too hard." Steve chuckled back. "I can bring a plate up to you so you can rest? As a peace offering for making you sore." He grinned as he started to stand.
"Oh, shush. You wouldn't bully me," Tony cooed, kissing his cheek, "You wouldn't hurt a fly, babe. I trust you."
"I love you, too. I'm very proud of you." Steve whispered back, returning the hug and petting softly at Tony's hair. "So very proud of you. You do so good, baby."
"Interesting choice, baby bear," He chuckled, picking up the princess box, "Any reason for these, sweets?"
"Perfect, Steve. Feel that warmth? That fire building in your lower body? Chase it. Chase it until you feel you're going to burst, then let it go. Let loose, gorgeous." Tony urged, hearing Steve's breath quicken and body looking taut.
"You can have more later after you eat a good lunch," Tony hummed, standing from the table to kiss Peter's cheek, "Especially if you get Sammy to eat lunch too."
He put a hand on his forehead, closing his eyes to try and stop the onslaught of panic that crashed down on him, echoes of the video still playing in his head.
“Fuck yes," Tony gasped, spreading his legs just a little more, "Always loose for you, baby, m'such a slut f'your cock--"
"It's not really a personality--" Dummy beeped at him. "Okay, he has a personality. Sheesh, kid. Don't make me put you in time out."
"He did make good points, it just sucks that half my brain is telling me not to believe him," Tony huffed, picking up Steve's hand, "I'll get there. One day."
"He got Steve and me plushies too. Mine's a shark, and Steve's is a manta ray," Tony added in, coming over to flop down onto his recliner.
Smiling at his handiwork, Tony dashed upstairs to done Steve's favorite black panties, going back out to lay on the mattress and wait for him to wake.
"Sap," Tony pointed out, pulling Steve down so he sat next to the hammock, "Send it to me, and I'll get it printed. We can hang it up, if you want."
He grinned, looking over Steve's shoulder for a millisecond before gasping, bouncing in Steve's arms.
"How about actual sleep?" Steve offered, covering Tony up with the blanket as well. He hugged the man close and rubbed at his back. "Sleep'll do you good, love."
"Everyone needs to be silly, sometimes. Makes you feel better if you been too stressed, and as you get older you will encounter a
Steve smiled fondly, having peace knowing Tony had such good friends on his side. He finished the list for now, at least until he could add Peter's contribution to it.
"I--ah, yes, yes Sir," Tony replied softly, slightly confused as he looked up at Steve from under his eyelashes, "Whenever you wanna ask, go ahead."
He stuffed socks onto the boy's feet, double checking that his hair was dry before scooping him up again. Peter looked back at Tony, a little confused by the statement, but nodded in understanding anyway as they headed back downstairs. Steve was just finishing cleaning up when they came down.
Upstairs in the nursery, Sammy stood upright in his crib, bouncing on the soles of his feet; his binky was on the floor outside the crib, making him whine as he tried to reach for it.
"Hey, hey, Peter," Tony gently swiped the washcloth over the boy's forehead to help him wake up, "Just a few more minutes buddy, okay? Just need to get you dried, in pajamas, and brush your teeth, then we'll grab Wade and you can come sleep in my bed. Think you can stay awake a little while longer?"
"You bring out the cheeseball in me, so get used to it. You're stuck with me." Steve grinned up at him, reaching up and stroking his cheek. "Your blush is still cute. Can't wait to see it for years to come."
"Yes, yes, Princess, I'm getting there," Tony laughed, taking the heated bottle from the microwave to test on his wrist, "Okay, it's ready, don't suck it down too fast."
"Should I go talk to him?" Steve asked. "I really wasn't meaning anything by it all. I don't want him upset."
Steve made a soft noise at that. "You don't have to reward me for that. I'll do it, anyway. You deserve it." He stated with a kiss. "We can just go to go. Have fun, y'know?"
"But you are different from that. You are an actual friend." The brunet admitted softly, clearing his throat before throwing an arm around Steve's shoulders and leading them out of the workshop.
"Made it here just fine, thanks. Jarvis let me in so I didn't disturb you guys." Bruce hummed quietly, coming to sit down near the end of a couch.
Steve's eyes fluttered shut as Tony kissed along his skin. He hummed contently with the presses of lips, feeling loved and cherished. He mewled slightly as Tony moved further down along his body, trying to keep as still as he can.
Steve nodded in response, appreciating Tony's guidance as he started to make his thrusts a bit longer. He moved up and down wantonly, mewling at the pleasure starting to shoot up his spine.
"I know buddy, we're wanting to spend time with you, trust me." Steve sighed, kissing the boy's temple. "Maybe when Daddy is done with his work and we can find a day, we can see if someone'll babysit Sammy. Then you, Daddy, and I can spend the day together, doing fun stuff. Does that sound good?"
"Not really. He's just been thinking some stuff isn't big boy stuff, or 'he's too old for it.'" Bucky shrugged carefully. "I personally think it’s all fine for his age."
"Well, you probably could do that while I'm cooking Christmas dinner." Steve offered up, reaching to pet at Peter's hair. "And while I cook, you all can chat with me on designs if you'd like?"
"No ma’am, you're not old, you're not a day over nineteen," Tony laughed, licking the icing off his nose, "Alright, alright. Not old. Cut my cake so I can stuff it in."
"Yeah," They chorused at him, to which Tony laughed and hopped out of the car, helping Peter unbuckle.
Steve's cheeks warmed hearing the tone in Tony's voice, following along down the aisle to see what all Tony was picking out. "What else were you thinking about getting while we were here?".
Sammy giggled happily at Tony, patting his beard before settling against his chest, sucking on his thumb. Tony smiled fondly, grabbing one of the muffins from the box before giving Sammy his teething ring.
With a huffy breath, Tony reached down to grab Steve's hand, pulling him off. "Want you in me," he murmured, "Don't wanna come without you in me."
"We already saw, dim-bulb," Bucky snorted, "You can say 'honeymoon'. We all saw it coming." He sighed, stirring another sugar into his coffee.
Tony happily kissed him back and snuggled up to him, worming his way up to tuck his head under Steve's chin.
"C'mon, Daddy!" Peter urged, tugging Tony along. "I want ya ta go down da slide with me!" He said excitedly.
"You will not always be able to hide behind your father, Anthony. You will find that I am not a man easily shaken." Schmidt made clear, glancing over to Steve. "I believe you have a job to be doing, Steven. And it is not to be standing there and gawking like an oaf, correct?" He spat.
"Constant use of the mouth keeps the lips and throat sufficiently lubricated," Tony purred, nosing at Steve's cheek, "Otherwise they both dry up."
"That's no excuse to be having sex at your age, Steven," Tony replied, watching his ass turn from a pink to a dark red, "That's-- I cannot believe this."
Tony nodded and dashed over to Peter, sitting down next to the clearly upset child. "Pete? Honey? What happened, baby?" He asked softly, wincing when Peter started to cry once he put a comforting hand on his back.
"Steve," He started, looking down at his hands for a moment "Do you know why I volunteered to help you?"
"Ooo, chilly--" Steve teased, feeling Tony's feet as they snuggled. "Our little escapades aren't done yet today, but a catnap first'll be nice--".
"Oh, you have your moments, hon. You are super adorable," Steve hummed, moving to sit on his knees in front of Tony. He booped their noses together, a smile on his face.
"Please do not call me a sexy monkey," Tony sighed, knowing there was a blush of embarrassment on his face, "
"If I had the Stark name on my back, I'd feel the same," Bucky sighed, helping Steve tidy the room, "I mean, all the scandals
"You know what I want, Rogers. It's been two weeks and my bond is throbbing," Tony muttered, gently sucking on Steve's collar, "Carry me?"
"I think he is fine right now. No scarring." Steve hummed, deciding to lightly lay on top of Tony. "Just wanna lay down with yoooou."
"I think he put yours in the front and everyone else's is in the back since you have more. And probably were the best behaved." Bruce explained with a smile, ruffling the boy's hair. "And we slept just fine, Tony."
"Sounds good to me. As long as it’s all fair." Steve smiled, kissing the top of Tony's head. "We'll have to make sure everything is set up before people move in, though. Could take a bit." He hummed.
Steve let out a soft whine, moving back towards the hit a bit. It wasn't as pinpointed in one spot, so it didn't smart as bad that time.
"Nap time sounds perfect to me." Steve agreed, running fingers through Peter's hair. "We can finish fixing on the Christmas stuff later together. Right now, we should have a group nap time." He hummed. "We could have a pallet on the floor."
"That sounds like a wonderful plan." Steve fully agreed, shuffling in the room behind Tony and moving to change. He quickly snuggled underneath the blankets, lifting them up for Tony to sneak in.
He pulled back to start getting out wine glasses, pulling a bottle of sparkling grape juice out for Peter.
"I'm so sorry to hear that, Sharon." Steve said sympathetically. Alzheimer's was a sad thing to have, especially for someone as young as Sharon seemed.
"Nothing's wrong, its just-- you're enjoying yourself, clearly." Tony pointed out, careful hands roaming Steve's chest while his thoughts of what to do ran wild.
Tony got his velcro sneaks off, then undid the button, turning to shut the water off while Peter finished undressing.
would. Speaking of, no sex the night before meeting your parents. I'm sure my 'thoroughly fucked' walk would make a great first impression."
He quickly retrieved the medicine and a glass of water from the bathroom, helping Steve sit up to give him the dosage. Steve took the medicine, guzzling down the rest of the glass of water afterwards. He laid back down in the bed, looking up at Tony with tired eyes.
He changed into his warmest sweats and a sweater, standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. Steve sat at the end of the bed after he slipped his sweats on, patting beside him for Tony to join him.
"Pete's already like me," Tony smiled softly, "He's my mini me. And then we can have a mini you. That, and there's no way in hell my sperm is leaving this house. I would die of embarrassment in that office."
"I believe it." He chuckled, finishing things up and swooping in to kiss Tony's lips. "Now, let’s get out of here before we're all pruny."
"Love it, love your cock," Tony whimpered, head bowed as he fucked down onto Steve. He made tiny, quiet sounds, seizing up at the arousal bubbling in his abdomen. "S-Steve, baby--"
"I'm allowed to smooch my boy. You had your chance all day today. I get a turn." Steve smirked playfully, setting the boy down at the table.
"Shhhh, Petey." Steve whispered, hugging him close. "Don't be so upset, baby bear. We love you so much and we wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if you ever felt unloved—“
Steve couldn't help the light blush that grew on his cheeks. Tony was being far too nice to him for his own good. Taking him in and showing him all these things... Steve was very thankful.
"Hmm, maybe. I hope that’s all. I mean, I know not every gets a soulmate, but I wouldn't think they have dwindled so much." Steve explained, tracing small shapes along Tony's arm.
"Good luck. The guy is a stone-cold Nazi, I swear." Steve explained, searching for a clean uniform and swiftly putting it on. He had to be sure everything was put on straight, putting on deodorant and some cologne to cover up the sex smell a bit.
Steve crashed his lips against Tony's, bringing them into a deep kiss if only to get Tony to stop. "You are such a nerd. My God..." He murmured, face still red.
"You can say that again," Tony murmured, reaching over with a shaky hand to lace their fingers together, "I wish we could do that more often. Like when we first met..."
"You sure? As long as you are okay with it." Steve said gently, picking Peter up to carry the boy to the living room. “So munchkin, what movie we gonna watch today?"
Peter walked in from the kitchen, the only evidence giving him away being a streak of blue paint on his cheek.
"Admire all you want," Tony laughed, burrowing himself into Steve's chest, "I think I need a couple more hours. Still tired. And cold."
Steve's eyes got slightly wider as Tony told the tale, his facial expression turning apologetic. Tony began to quake more in his arms, but unwilling to cry in front of Steve.
Tony snorted in laughter, leaning over to kiss Steve passionately in front of everyone, earning more groans. "I love you, thank you," he murmured, pinching Steve's behind.
"Uh- huh. I weally like the Gwinch," Peter replied enthusiastically, beaming at Pepper, "He's lots like Daddy."
Wait, no. That face... It was that of the armored human! He was just without the armor this time. but was still sinking down.
. It was taking a large part of his willpower to listen and basically go against his body's instincts to pleasure. Because damn, it felt
He buried his face in Natasha's stomach, inhaling her scent of lavender and jasmine, instantly feeling his nerves be soothed.
"I'll have to ask Tony about it." Steve said with a hand over his face. "He's planning something, so I have no clue."
He took a second to look at the fish dish with an amused smile, the slightly browned cream sauce in the pan. It honestly didn't look overly burned; certainly still looked edible, unlike those eggs he tried to make Pepper on the jet that one time. They could eat this and enjoy themselves, he was sure.
"Mornin'," Tony murmured, "Y'always smell good in the morning." He sighed happily, snuggling into his warmth. "Whaddya wanna do today?"
"'Kay, Daddy." Peter said with a smile, snuggling his penguin happily. "How long we gonna be at da hop'ital for?" He asked curiously.
“Honey. If you really don't want to, we don't have to," Tony reminded him gently, collecting the baby's toys before giving Steve's arm a squeeze, "Believe me, I don't, but Pete needs to be able to see his aunts and uncles, and Sammy does too, and we need our own time without worrying. And if anything happens, we're a block and a half away."
Tony laughed, nearly stumbling at the shove, "Watch your strength there, bambi. Yeah, yes, next foundation benefit we'll dance, I mean-- are you ready for that?"
"Mmhm," Tony grumbled, reaching for the pillow, but getting too tired to try anymore, he dropped his hand, "What time is it?"
"I don't particularly care for the guy, or rather he doesn't really care for me. The man works here at the university and doesn't even bother to TRY and see me.".
"Very. Very good trip." Steve grinned, hugging back then picking Peter back up. "It was very eventful."
Steve's head lolled back, moaning as Tony thrusted into him and hit his sweet spot over and over. He came with a shaky sigh, eyes closed and a blissful expression set on his face. Tony groaned when he felt Steve clench around him, only managing a few more thrusts before coming, bent over Steve with stars dancing in his eyes.
He didn't even know how he wanted to continue his sentence. Steve just wanted to praise. Praise Tony for how good he felt. How good Tony always made him feel. Words were just a difficult way of expressing it.
"Unless you intend to call me that for the next half hour..." Tony warned, pulling Steve into their room.
