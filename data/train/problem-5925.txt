Hopefully this chapter works for you. My beta reader asked for changes that I just couldn't make on time to post today. I think it works and shows what needs to be shown for this stage of the story. Enjoy!
In his hands he touches the key to his salvation. He trembles as he caresses, the fear of loss so potent and ever present. Lying side by side, Steve grasps his hands and kisses each finger then each palm.
“Yes, we spoke of him briefly on the ship. Estane was my father’s alpha by proxy. Dad was a beta and until I came of age, the Stark family needed an alpha to keep their place at the table. Once I came of age, I kept Estane on but things got messy when I came back to make my claim. He didn’t like it, and he left. It wasn’t on the best of terms. ” Tony begins to eat and when he notices Steven not eating he taps his bowl with his fork. “Eat. You had a very strenuous night and you are still slightly under weight.”
“God, Steve, no.” A chill of loneliness crawls up Tony’s spine. There were too many bad people in Tony’s life for him to believe that Steve acted with malice. He swallows the hard pain that’s welling in him. “I wanted to protect you from what I learned – how your friend killed-.” And then his voice breaks, and he barely gets out the word mother before a sob cracks and chokes him.
Tony frowns at him as if he’s said something wrong. Overstepping his boundaries seems to be a hobby of Steve’s – anyone in the Army could attest to that, especially his CO. He stays quiet as Tony shuffles about the room, putting things in their proper place.
Pain meds – more like ibuprofen – not alcohol. There’s always weed, he can have that, but he’s on the wagon and he wants to stay there. He’d much prefer a stiff drink. “No. I’ll just rest a while. Like you said it’s just a little wonky today.”
"Why's he like that?" He knows it's rude to ask. His mother would have pinched up her lips and shaken her head. It's just not done – no one ever remarks about a Companion if they are not paired. When he looks at the boy and then back at the older boy’s Soul Companion he doesn't see derision in the boy's features just a little curiosity and maybe amusement.
“I think it’s a great idea,” Rhodey says. “You need to get out there more. You’ve been hiding out for weeks. The press doesn’t like it.”
“You don’t, you don’t want to do this,” Tony had said as he crept ever closer to the wide open door. Bucky clutched onto his wrist and dragged him over to the window. With his metal hand, he shattered the window and then pushed Tony out of the pane. He held onto Tony’s shirt, letting him hang out of the window as the shards of glass stabbed and pierced his torso and shoulders. Hanging there, nearly insane with fear, Tony only wanted to explain, to tell Bucky he cared for Steve. He never wanted to hurt him.
He needs to figure out which building to go to and do it fast. If he figured it correctly either Steve hasn't arrived just yet or he's just appeared on the scene. It's been well over the hour he estimated. With bag in hand, he crosses the gravel parking lot, trying not to acknowledge the sweat dripping down his temples or the running of it down his back. He slips on his sun glasses and surveys the first building. It's falling apart, a mere shell of its former manufacturing glory. Probably a great buy with good access to the water. He frowns and keeps searching around and as he crunches the stones under his too expensive shoes. He sees a black SUV and a motorcycle parked behind the second trash heap of a building. It shouldn't bother him, but it does and he shouldn't investigate but he does. He checks out the bike. There's nothing about it that should set off alarm bells except for the fact there's a little (faded) A painted on the seat as if someone wanted to show it but decided displaying it anywhere else would be too recognizable.
Bruce huffs. “No, you’re not. You did something you wanted to do.” Steve can’t see exactly what Bruce is doing but he hears the rattling of a tray, blood draw supplies, and the monitor beeping that reads out his results. Bruce carries the tray over to him. “Roll up your sleeve.”
“Hmm,” Tony says and decides to drop it. He doesn’t need Steven to think he’s going soft. It’s safer to go with what he knows, then to chance the possibilities. Lord, even Penny thinks he might be going soft with the bonding. “Today we meet the competition for the chair. This is not a formality. This is a true negotiation. We need to win over as many as possible to my coalition.”
“That’s not a nice word, Steve,” Natasha admonished him, yet she kept her tone neutral, understanding.
Without pause Steve gets the mugs for the coffee and fishes out the creamer from the refrigerator. They work in unison much like they do during battles. Without words, without signals, they are in sync. It hits to the heart of matters. In his bones he appreciates it, the knowledge. They go together. Lock and key.
When Tony and Steve depart from Avenge, the sun is still low in the sky. The clouds are a fierce gray with an underlying violet that speaks towards winter storms. Steve very nearly calls off the journey, concerned for Tony’s health, but then he remembers Bucky writhing on his cot above the jailhouse and knows he has no other choice.  The poison has gone deep and, he fears, without the intervention of Loki and his potions, Bucky will be lost to him forever. He cannot fail Bucky again.
“I know,” he replies. He doesn’t want to hear it from her, not from one of Tony’s most trusted allies. He’s not really part of Tony’s fleet, his company, his friends, or his family. He’s a whore and nothing more. “Anyway, I need to ask you something else.”
Tony jerks his head and he leads Happy back into Steve’s assigned quarters, leaving Steve on the deck with the guards. He smiles at them and then looks away. This isn’t uncomfortable, it’s outright painful. Lots of people on the station recognize brothel workers. The fact that the workers stay in certain areas of the station like the brothel ring, the court, the lowers shops and concourse eases any tensions. Plus, since Steve and the rest of his workmates have routines -well, they see the same people again and again. The Avengers guards? That’s something else. Sure, Steve’s seen them in passing or when they are going from one place to another on Prime. But standing stationary while they await the return of the prince? That’s a recipe for disaster or at least anxiety.
The Silver Knight charges his beast. It growls in response as if it knows that he’s asking it to sacrifice as well. It’s a mission of death, now. The Silver Knight accepts this – it has always been a danger, a peril of his mission that the demons and the Red Knight would discover his hideaway, would overtake him. He has no other purpose right now but to ensure the vows of the Silver Knight do not fall into the hands of the devil and his minions.  He took on his burden as a child, lost and alone in the woods with no memory to tell him who he was or might have been. Saved by the mysterious Soul Keeper, the Silver Knight has become a shield of the Realm, keeping the souls from destruction by the forces of the Red Knight and the demon infection.
Steve doesn’t answer. He’s frozen in the bed, trapped in some nightmare kind of sleep. It’s somewhere between a coma and slumber.
She’s working the seams of his collar as she says, “Don’t be. That’s your job. Now, let me do mine.” For a few minutes she considers and measures and readjusts the uniform. “I’ll have boots sent over because you can’t go barefoot or in dress shoes. You’ll have only a short time to get ready once the uniform is finished fabricating so don’t dally.”
“Well, we already knew that, didn’t we?” Steve replies and then room falls silent except for the rapid beeping of the heart monitor. Before either of them can break the quietude, the nurse returns.
Tony took it the wrong way. The words riled him up and he flung insults and barbs at Steve. “Are you looking for a high class whore? Is that who you want? What you want? I thought you were the Captain of the Honor Guard. You’re the guy my father couldn’t shut up about? You?”
“Please don’t call me that,” Steve says and she nods while closing the door. The screen before him is frozen on the three professionals. They’re good looking men. He wouldn’t have an issue with that. But it feels like a betrayal and can he handle more on top of what’s already happened?
Tony leaps to his feet. “This isn’t a fucking little detail. This is his nature. He’s Hermi! I mean how the fuck did he hide it all these years. I’ve only ever seen him in rut never in heat. What the fuck?”
Tony didn’t speak again to Steve during the flight. He should have. He admitted that much to himself, but sometimes he could be as pigheaded as the next guy.  When they approached the rendezvous point, Tony glanced over at Steve near the front of the jet and sighed. He reached out then, just a slight brush, a caress of his soul against Steve’s, and felt a shudder in response. Steve met his gaze and smiled. They might not always agree, but the bond remained.
Steve had thought retiring would take him out of the game, release him from the idea of even having to worry about the Accords. He didn’t know that Bucky and Zemo would end up throwing them into a tangential situation that would end badly. None of them did. So many times he thought he could handle it, figure out a way around the division. It escalated during the Accords. He knows it. The Accords didn’t end it though. The issue of Bucky ended it.
Tony stands under the willow tree as Steve lays out a blanket. He spins on his heel and stares at Happy in the distance who is just driving away. His life is driving away from him, it has been since that fateful day in December when his father drove them home from an early Christmas Party. Sometimes, in the dead of night, Tony still hears his mother’s failing voice calling for his father. Howard had refused to wear his seatbelt – of course- and had suffered the consequences. He’d been thrown from the car, died instantly. Mom – well, it took time for her to fade away. Tony swears and blinks a few times. Memories aren’t like vision. Vision is a momentary thing, a thing that can be cut off. Memories stay.
If you haven't noticed I also added a chapter because I realized the last chapter needed to be split into two for clarity's sake. Hope you like it!
Hesitantly at first, Steve started, “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He heard Natasha’s low tones join his voice.
When he came back to himself, Tony leaned against the side of the shower as the water still rained down, the words still on his lips. “Steve, Steve.” He murmured the name over and again. How could he be so screwed up? He didn’t even know the guy. They’d been apart for years. His soul didn’t bond with Tony. They didn’t resonate together. Steve found no place in his pack for Tony. Nothing.
It’s the same story everywhere so that when they trudge back into the brothel, the exhaustion eats away at his dignity and pride. He hasn’t been made to feel less, or even like the label on his registration (whore) all the time he’s been at the brothel. When he returns and Natasha comes to check on his wardrobe, he opens his empty hands.
He left the private quarters and headed back to the main area of the underground bunker. As he approached the command center he heard Hill speaking. “I don’t know. Wilson said to be on the look out – that Tony took off and was headed here.”
“You know --.” And then he says a long sentence in Farsi that Steve only picks out five or six of the words.
Equipment spread out in front of him, telling stories of how long he’s worked on this project. The incentive had been to find Bruce, to find a way to track him beyond the Quinjet landing near Fiji, but it changed, transmuted into something else. When he figured out a little about the mind gem, when he looked deeper, and deeper still until he’d finally broached something – magnificent, something insane, something with the possibilities to change the world.
As Tony pours his coffee, he tells JARVIS to put Richards through to the open line right after he gets Bruce here. It takes a while and he’s sure Richards is steamed, but Tony doesn’t give a shit. This is Steve. This is Captain America they are talking about, so Richards can fucking wait a minute. Bruce, bless his heart, joins Tony in the kitchen in record time. He looks a little harried, and his hair is dripping wet. Tony interrupted his shower, which demonstrates just how important Steve is to all of them – not just Tony. For some reason this helps Tony get through the next few minutes.
“Okay?” His heart races. He shouldn’t be worried or concerned. He’s had some repeat clients and bookings that lasted more than the standard hour.
“Well, yes. But they decided on Prime because of Jane. Well, she’s leaving the station and Loki refuses to go. Says something about owing someone something and the brothel is the best hiding place. Blah, blah, blah.” She waves her hands in the air. “He’s in trouble, that much is clear and Natasha’s considering tossing him out on his ear.”
Steve chewed on his cheek and then said, “It’s who we are. Mates. Isn’t it? It isn’t about the power but about who we are.” Steve jumped to his feet, not sure if he was breaking some royal protocol, not sure that he cared. “There are mates all over America. So many of them. So many families with vampires as their sisters, brothers, and so on. They surely don’t want this war against their loved ones. They surely don’t want to break apart a nation with such promise.”
When he shows up at Asgardian Comics with his final proofs of the pages, Steve’s glad to get away from Tony for the day. Though he admits to himself as he walks through the door to the comic book publisher, his nerves want to pop out of his skin with anticipation of seeing Tony again. He’s got to get it under control.
But it happened that Tony did not come to visit him the entire time he was in the hospital. When the days went by and Tony never showed up, Steve ignored the ache in his chest and the conflict he received from his new bond with Tony as if the threads already frayed and burnt on the ends. He wanted to ask for Tony, but that kid from Brooklyn, the one that was only ninety something pounds of spit and vinegar lived underneath all the muscles and bravado. Steve’s abilities never helped him to muster the courage to talk to people, especially not in situations like the one he happened to be in. He thought about reaching out along the tendrils of the bond, to feel and to search. He wanted to discuss how they were going to deal with the bond, but then Steve realized that maybe Tony just didn’t want to be in the position either. Maybe Tony felt or heard or whatever Steve’s thoughts about the bond and had been insulted by it. That thought shamed Steve, and so he curled back and tried to keep as much distance from Tony as possible in light of their new uncomfortable situation.
After days at the Council’s meeting estate, he heads back to the Stark mansion. He intends to take a long bath, throw back a few good drinks, sleep for an age, but not before he fucks his omega senseless. He has to admit, Steven is brilliant. His tactics to counter whatever Estane does have been not only intelligent but somehow slightly tainted. After a particularly difficult parliamentary proceedings meeting, Steven had taken Tony aside and said, “Watch Estane. I don’t trust him. He’s not to be trusted. He may have walked away from the Stark Family, but he still thinks of it as his.”
“My doctor, neurologist really. He’s going to check the implant. I want to do some upgrades so I need his input.” Tony goes back to his seat at the island, sliding onto the stool.
As he walks the landscape around him darkens, he refuses to look back over his shoulder. Instead, Steve keeps the ringing in his soul close and knows that he feels the entanglement of Tony within him. He is just a particle, a part of space-time now, and he’s meeting with another force willing to tear apart the entire universe for greed. His mission clears his mind, calms his fears. This is for all – for the entire existence. Even the Outriders are at risk. Every soul in the living universe is at risk.
Bucky needed relieve from the urgency in his blood. He needed that connection between an omega and an alpha. He tried. But even as he penetrated Steve again and again, he couldn’t get the relief he sought. Because he couldn’t knot. The knot is required not only for the omega but for the alpha. Without it, there is no relief.
“She’s just outside here, no problems with her hooves. She looks in prime condition, though I think she saw some of the war, too?”
Tony pants through his anger, regulates his breathing and then says, “Sorry, but – sorry. I would like it if I could take care of you now. Is that all right?” He waits and then adds softer, “As your alpha, you have performed well shown me your fealty and I would like to reciprocate.”
“We were able to save you. I’m not sure,” Steve continued. “How you feel now, but I wanted to thank you again. You put yourself on the line for me and for Clint. You didn’t have to do that, and they came after you because of that.”
Iron cuffs tightened around his legs at the ankle. The weakness sickened Tony brought a rising miasma into his brain until a delirious fever shuddered through him. The arm around his throat dropped away, but then someone clamped a leather collar around his neck that must have been linked to the cross. It forced his head upright so that he could not escape staring at the sun as it rose in the sky. He shut his eyes, but his lids felt like sandpaper. No more tears wet his eyes as the sun’s rays beat through his lids.
After he suited up as much as he could without a uniform, Steve went to the window and hit the manual switch to untint it. “Damn.”
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, that is not true. Now let me tell you about one vampire very dear to my heart. Her name is Peggy Carter and she knew Captain America!” Jarvis sat down at the kitchen table as his wife Ana came in and put on the kettle for tea.
Tony rubs at his eyes and crawls back over to the cot where Steve murmurs in a half-sleep, half unconscious stupor. Blinking several times, Tony starts to reach out to touch what he sees, and then Steve moves and flips over. For a second, Tony thinks he doesn’t look as bad as he thought. But then there’s something god damned sprouting out of his back. Or at least that’s what Tony thought he saw.
“Yeah, that would be good,” Tony says. He waits as Steve adjusts. The weight on the couch shifts and changes, but remains the same overall. “When I first went blind my friend from school, Rhodey – James Rhodes – came over. He was great. Very supportive. But I was in shock so much, I couldn’t picture his face. I kept having these panic attacks about how I couldn’t see him. How I couldn’t picture him. What did he look like? I was a basket case.”
He practically feels the ping ping ping of pieces falling – not into place exactly but coalescing into possibilities and potentials. The young woman across the hallway – Nat he called her – she’s not a customer. But she’s important to the puzzle.
Steve glanced around, glancing into the setting sun as it glinted off the leafy waves of corn. “I don’t know.” That truth hurt. He ran, and Steve never ran from a fight, but what he escaped had nothing to do with a fight even if his heart and his muscles yearned for the combat because it was a simpler foe. That’s all he was good for anyway.
Tony curls onto him and, without pause, Steve wraps his arm around him. “I don’t want you to be a replacement for him. I want to know you, Tony. I want to get to know everything about you. I want to know how you tick. I want to know why we’re-.” He stops and swallows as if he’s hard to face.
“Dinner with Bruce?” Tony frowned. Of course, it wasn’t about him, but about the soul pack. Could today get any worse? He snapped, “I’m not his secretary. You can call him and ask him. I’m not his keeper.” He went to cut the connection.
She snickers. “Really, Rogers?” Somehow she jumps through the hurdles and finishes without answering and completing the security checkpoints. “Tell me, Rogers, is that the best you can do with security?”
“Not him! Why did they do this to him?” Steve said. He jerked against their embrace. “He’s innocent. All he did was help me.”
Those simple words set in motion a new path to venture down. Steve cringed to himself and ground his teeth. Another question was all that he needed right now. He should probably excuse himself and just go and get the Mantra over with, though Wong repeatedly taught him that the Mantra wasn’t burden, a chore to be completed but something to find solace and comfort and mindfulness in. It took months to figure it out.
Strange releases Tony the next day with strict orders that he’s not permitted to use the glasses or tap into the implant unless he’s able to revert to the previous software version. Wong and Strange promise to attend the gala so that they can gang up on Hank Pym and see if Tony can get his hands on the code for the nanotechnology he’s developing. Tony ropes Rhodey into taking some leave and helping him with the downgrades as he’s been referring to it with the implant and the glasses. Rhodey never complains, though he’s unusually quiet when Tony talks about Steve.
Tony had the audacity to laugh. “Do? You have a lot to do? In your beige and boring apartment?” He turned around and glanced over the non-descript place without pictures on the walls, with taupe colored couches, and dark wood tables. Nothing but brown or versions of it.
“Stark has never been accused of being reticent.” She reached for her fries, grabbed the bag, and sat back on the easy chair. “Something’s up.”
“Holy shit!” Tony scrambles away, tripping and going to the ground. “You went into the ocean, you went into the ice.”
Tony jolts and Steve feels his muscles quiver under his grip. He yanks his arm away, readying for the fight. “It shouldn’t be this way. If I’m going to make things right than they will accept you – whatever your profession.”
Ross glances at the guards and with a simple gesture, they leave the room, save for one who stands next to the door with an AR15 at the ready. “You have to understand, I have to see how far I can go. That’s how you play the game.”
“I’ve been in the workshop. I thought you were going to get some rest.” Tony notes that the blankets are strew on the floor as if he couldn’t find comfort in the soft mattress and chose the floor instead.
“He won’t marry,” Clint remarks as they are fishing through different sashes for the robes. “He’s even designated the Duchess Virginia as his heir.”
Steve sat down at the island when Tony pointed to the stool. Steve needed to get to Clint, but when he stretched out his soul’s energy just a buzz returned from him.  He couldn’t manage to lock onto it and he surmised he needed Wong and for Clint to wake up for him to actually do anything. Would Clint wake up? Steve inwardly cursed, they needed Wong.
“There has to be Northern Lights, we should be able to see them,” Tony says and races past Steve toward the stairs.
As Tony recalled the word he dove into the water and plucked out the shield. The debris field encompassed the whole of the river. Across the shore, the cataclysm of helicarriers dropping out of the sky still smoldered around him. He headed toward the hospital with shield in hand. Ignoring the flashing lights along the roadways, the gathered emergency personnel. How many dead? How many Hydra? What had he been living under all these years? Had his father known?
Tony settles on the bed, placing his hand on Steve’s chest. “We’re going to Korea. Cho is optimistic she can help you.”
Steve’s always been ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, but he hates the thought of his team saddled with the guilt of that decision.
“Your funeral, right boss man?” Clint winks at Steve and then hands the bow and the quiver over to Tony. “Give it your best shot.”
“How old are you, anyhow?” Steve hisses and yanks his hand away from his pants. “Once we get back, you’re washing up. Full shower. Lord, you even have it in your hair.”
The ache pulses through him. And he cries out, sobs. It’s done and he can never bond again and he will never want the knot again. He never wants the kind of heat he had, the kind where he allows a stranger to touch him and dominate him. He will be neutered and shamed. Cold runs through his veins as he stares at the past. “Tony,” he murmurs and feels the loss even more strikingly as he shivers. He gulps at the air because the last breath of life is gone. Hot tears run down his face and he stares at the mutilated gland in the sink. His voice is hoarse and rasps, “Tony.”
Natasha nods as if she already knows. He wonders if everyone knows. Everyone but the stupid omega. He rubs at his face and then decides to overdose on coffee. He downs the steaming drink, not caring that it scorches his mouth and throat.
As he sits in the shower, he rocks and denies the tears flowing down his face. He doesn’t want to remember anymore. What Estane taught him, showed him over the years as he grew up… He’d never confessed it to anyone, but one of the reasons he went rogue was because of what Estane showed him. He blanches in the shower, gagging a little.
Steve clamps his mouth shut but a glimpse over to the passenger seat and Tony detects it again – the slight quaking of his shoulders, his hands as he holds the phone. Tony reaches to him and clasps his hand.
“Then I have to ask you: what are you loyal to? The Constitution is a document that’s aged. It, at one time, allowed slavery and it can be interpreted any number of ways-.”
“Bugs have been out for a while, yes.” Fury was – well – infuriating sometimes. “I don’t really need a babysitter.”
And Tony knows. Something went wrong. Went horribly wrong. Somehow Steve rescued Natasha but sacrificed himself in her place. Why? How? He wants to scream. He wants to die. The hope that had blossomed in his chest unravels and he can’t hold onto it. It’s slipping through his fingers, lost, an unwoven mess.
It shouldn't have felt as good as it did. Even a tinge of shame couldn't stop Tony from basking in the warmth, the spread of completion as he grunted out his release. And then he felt as well as heard Steve groan around him as he jerked himself off with Tony in his mouth and a hand on his own erection. It felt filthy and lovely at the same time
Jamison cocks a brow at him. “Listen, Tony, I might be an alpha but I’m not a prime, nor am I a dom. I don’t have the same stake in the game that you do. My needs are satisfied with a drone if need be. You need a warrior. You need the sub-omega. He’s it. That’s good for you. I’m not going to judge.”
Sawyer cleared his throat and adjusted his belt where a shock bully club hung. “Not in the last decade. But we got precautions.”
Tony closes his eyes and shakes his head. “I don’t think that’s in the cards. Let’s get to this store you’re talking about.” He leaves behind the hope and Steve sees the joy dissipate from Tony’s face. Steve observes the shields close down on Tony’s expression; his engagement separates from the people around him. He’s always been set apart from people.
Tony shook his head and the tightness at his neck reminded him of what just happened again. “You need to get back to bed. You’re hurt.” He didn’t wait for Steve to answer but turns to Bucky instead. “You understand? He’s taking care of you while he’s hurt.”
“Yeah, Wanda, she used her voodoo magic or whatever the hell it was to give me this vision. You were dead. You were all dead. But you were blown to pieces. And the bond -.” He trembled in Steve’s arms. “Felt like all my limbs had been ripped off. I never want to feel like that again. What the hell did she do?”
For a second Tony worried that weaving their souls’ energies together might be a little too manipulative. When he plopped down on the couch and Steve went to follow him, Tony put a hand on his chest and said, “Are you sure? It’s not just the soul thing.”
Steve searches around as if he cannot remember whether or not he left the phone in the factory or, God forbid, in his apartment. He finds it and lets out a sigh of relief. The text only takes him seconds as Tony gets back on the road, kicking up gravel as he streaks out of the parking lot.
“We have a problem, a big one,” Steve said. “We have to get back to the site of the crash. Now, immediately.”
“Are you sure it just isn’t jealousy. Losing the love of your life can make you do stupid things. “ He rubs the back of his neck and adds. “I lost my dog once-.”
Bruce rolls his eyes. “Don’t mess with me. Or Big Green. What were we just talking about? Steve spent the last year with his old flame, Logan. They went around the country, went around the world. They lived together in Japan. I literally just said this Tony. I mean are you listening to me? They were living the life, happily ever after until – well, who knows what happened.” Bruce’s brows furrow together. “Did you ever find out what happened?”
“Not your family home,” Steve said. He wouldn’t put Hawkeye’s family in danger. The twins and Bucky were pack members but volatile and unpredictable.
Steve looks over at him. Tony blinks and looks like he’s staring directly at Steve. For a second, Steve thinks he is seeing him. His heart jumps in his chest and he says, “Tony?”
“Just meditating,” Bruce answers and scratches at his head. “I’ll get the supplies. Take a seat.” He points to the couch and Steve follows orders. If anything, having to get tested early only stigmatizes him because he failed to follow the rules.
“I did it for them,” Steve says. “I did it for you. I tried to keep you safe and now, it’s all going to hell.”
Steve shuddered as if a cold wind hit him hard in the face, but the air warmed and he gasped out, “Yeah. Just give me a minute.”
Staring at his phone, Tony considers his words. Usually he's just writes a date and time. Now he has to ask to change the time. Later. It should be easier; it's not that big of a deal. He grumbles and writes a quick note. He ends it with a sweet epithet and then pushes the phone back in his pocket. Heading up the stone steps to the DC brownstone, he tries not to wait for the chime that tells him Steve received, acknowledged, and agrees to his text.
“You don’t need to know,” Steve says and winces as he moves. “You can go, I can take care of myself.”
“There were two people there,” Tony says and his voice is barely above a murmur. “Yinsen died. They put a gun to his head and blew his brains out in front of me.” He doesn’t try to disguise the tremor in his words, it would be useless. “Then, then the Captain came. His name was Steve Rogers. I couldn’t believe it, like Captain America.”
“But the implant isn’t close to the optical pathway.” Tony shakes his head. “You’re talking major surgery, Strange. I don’t want anyone messing with my brain.”
Most people who take anti-seizure medication have to put up with headaches, dizziness, maybe some vomiting, but Tony deals with fogged memory and lack of motivation. He hates the meds and as soon as he’s able to he refuses to take another dose. Strange isn’t surprised and he acquiesces while Pepper bursts from the stress and demands that Tony consider his health and well-being for once. It’s Tony’s fault that she teeters on the edge of anger and frustration, he’s never been easy to manage. One of the few nuggets his father always said to him was a good employee knew how to manage the manager. Pepper does a good job with Tony, most of the time. But he needs to put his foot down. This is his life and he doesn’t want to spend it doped to the gills.
“It’s okay. I can live without it for a bit. I have to check and make sure it’s functioning correctly. We took a hard hit from that bastard.”
“You’ll be careful, right?” Tony murmured as the night shrouded them from the day. Quietly in bed, Tony spoke into the night.
“Good a place as any for some privacy,” Steve said, picked up his duffle and walked out of the house.
Tony leans over the candle lit table as the lights lend more shadow to the room than illuminate it. In a low timbre, Tony says, "But you are, aren't you Captain?"
He huffs, removes his glasses and hooks them on his collar before he stuffs his hands in his pockets. Bending forward the facial brace molds around his forehead and chin. The light comes on and the laser matrix scans his retinas and facial bone structure. It quickly verifies his identity.
“I don’t know who he is, I bought them at the Goodwill,” Steve says and scoops up the cash. He sticks out his fist full of cash and offers it to Tony. “I don’t talk for a living. I fuck. Either fuck me or go.”
Tony decides it’s best not to tease him too much. He eats but then notices something is missing. “Where’s the coffee?”
“Don’t consent?” Asking the question feels like a betrayal of everything between them. Natasha has been one of his confidants, his closest friends since he was thawed. She introduced him to so much. She was the one to suggest Tony as an alpha though he never believed Fury would agree to it.
The man whose robust and dark haired with fair skin that looks ruddy underneath, pulsing and livid leans forward and offers his hand. “Commander Rogers, Tiberius Stone. I believe you may have met my father.”
“You’re his personal assistant, Steve. We hired you so something like this would be prevented, stopped. Your main task was to keep him safe.”
Steve was stunned, this couldn’t have gone any better, he had expected to be offered a  position within the Department of Defence, where he could set up his intelligence gathering and begin to mingle with the higher levels within government, but this gave him access to everyone.
“Come on doll, doctor’s orders got to fatten you up, make sure our pups get all the nutrients they need and that you keep a good layer of fat on your skinny bones.”
“Jarvis has Steve started his drive back to the Tower?  Ok, release the media files onto the internet, let’s see how long it takes for Steve Rogers to be trending for all the wrong reasons.
He had finally gotten Tony to admit that his mind was so full of engineering designs and ideas for upgrades both for the Avengers equipment and Stark Industries products that he could not think of anything else and that his behaviour would only get worse, not out of choice but out of need to get all his ideas and creations out of his head.  After speaking further to JARVIS and Pepper he had given him permission to spend the next ten hours in his work shop with no interruptions from anyone baring an Avengers Alarm.
Tony was by this time staring wide eyed and opened mouth at Dr Gottlieb, he cheeks burning red with embarrassment and shame.  Steve’s arm was comfortingly still wrapped round his shoulder so he turned and hid his blushing face against his broad muscled chest, the steady thump of Steve’s heat beat against his ear a distracting and soothing presence.
Steve was amazed by the sensation of fullness with just two fingers, he was sure he would never want anything larger shoved in his ass but he would give Bucky this tonight. Bucky’s wicked lips sucking on his cock and the jolts of pleasure from his prostrate being continuously touched had him gripping Bucky’s hair forcing his cock down further down his throat as his orgasm exploded and he shouted out his release.
Tony is never going to be the perfect omega, he acts the part in public but only because l discipline him beforehand. He works more than the law allows but the Government have given him a special dispensation to do so to help rebuild the world, even after two years there is still so much to be done.  It’s not good for him, all this outside stimulus, he should be home with the children and being a proper omega to me.  I am a strong Alpha and don’t allow him any leeway in our private life but there is just something missing, l don’t know what more l can do.”
Steve was thrilled with Tony’s current height loss but hoped that he continued to lose a further few inches, he wanted his baby boy under 5ft, so he could fully enforce his child like status even when he was in his adult mind.
He watched as the blacksmith roughly combed out her hair and tied it back with a strip of leather, using a pair of shears he cut just above the tie leaving her hair just above her shoulders.
“Tony if you require help you will ask politely for assistance, there is no shame in admitting you are unable to do something. Now Nurse Meyer has been waiting patiently to bath and change you, I believe it is time that you showed her what a good boy you can be.”
“Yes l have thoroughly examined her and Jarvis is going to monitor her tonight at the Compound.  Tomorrow you can insist that she has a final check up before leaving so that l can map the timeline of her healing strength.
Do you know how beautiful you are, even now with just this small amount of weight gain, can you imagine how stunning you will be when you have a thick layer of soft fleshy skin and rounded curves for me to hold on to as I have you hanging off my knot.”
Releasing Tony’s ankles, he pulled Tony’s legs up and over his shoulders, gripping his hips he raised his omega’s lower body off the bed so that he could swallow down the plumb little cock.  The slightly bitter tasting precum a contrast to the sweet breast milk but a welcome one, holding the stubby thing between his lips he swirled his tongue around the head before fucking it’s tiny  slit with the tip of his tongue.
I know this bonding could be problematic for you Alpha Rogers as the Dominant Alpha, but you need to put aside your possessive and aggressive attitude and do what is right for your bonded and your pups.
Steve scooped Tony into his arms, settling them in the rocking chair and placing the teat of the bottle against Tony’s lips, it took a few moments before he was able to get him to start sucking, tear filled whiskey brown eyes looking sadly up at him.
With one hand he pins the omega’s neck, forcing him to bare his swollen bonding gland. The purple flesh throbbing in time with his thrusts, he can feel his knot beginning to swell as his omega’s hips push back forcing his knot past his wrecked rim.
Tony spent the next few days down in his workshop whilst his Alphas were at Shield Headquarters, working on the Avengers equipment and small projects for Stark Industries, he wanted to make sure that he had a few new products ready and extra equipment for the Avengers for when the pups arrived.  His time was going to be taken up with caring for the pups, he had no illusions that Steve or Bucky were going to be of much help.
Steve keeps up a steady rhythm driving Tony to distraction each time his prostrate is nudged, it hurts but he can feel his ass clench trying to hold on to the invading fingers.  He vaguely hears Steve telling him to relax and push down he tries his best to comply but his body jerks and twist, it hurts so fucking much as he finally feels a thumb join the rest of the fingers stuffed into his ass.
It was days later that Tony saw Loki, he was in the bathing chambers with the pups, who were all splashing about in the shallow water under his and Bruce’s watchful eyes.
But don’t fret or worry sweetheart, to me you are my equal and partner l would never treat you as less.  It’s just that l always promised my Ma, that l would bond as she and my father had.”
Thor grabbed Loki as she leapt at him, throwing her onto the bed, with the dagger still imbedded in his shoulder he ripped of her robe and sank his cock into her wet cunt, pinning her hands above her head.  Blood dripped from his wound onto her pale white breasts, he ran has fingers through the drops smearing it over her breasts and stomach, fingers drawing ancient runes of ownership.
“Don’t worry Steve, the jab I gave him to wake him up included a minute dose of ‘Misty Memory’, it is a drug  l created that clouds a person’s recall of their last conscious memory, it’s completely harmless and over time the memory will surface as a vague dream.  In Tony’s case it will play as a pleasurable erotic dream.
Bucky plugged the still out of it omega before leaving him in his room. Slipping in to the master bedroom he retrieved his rucksack and headed out after shouting to Steve that he was going to meet up with the other Avengers.  It was time for some fun, time to hunt and time to play, that was the good thing about New York in this time, there was always plenty of prey wondering around without the protection of an Alpha and even if there was an Alpha about most of them were shit at protecting their property, so they deserved to have it taken, played with and depending on his mood returned even if somewhat damaged.  Good job he had sharpened his knifes earlier that day.
“Does that feel good baby boy? Do you want daddy to make you squirt your special cream?  If you want to please daddy and make him proud, you need to tell daddy how it feels and ask daddy nicely to milk you.
Now for the moment he hated, time to get dressed, the outfits in the chest were getting skimpier, and he didn’t think he would get away with not wearing one today, after last night.  But when he returned to the bedroom the chest was gone, in its place a small table, on which was placed a red box tied with a black bow. The black mesh booty shorts and crop top left everything exposed, the knee length platformed boots had him tripping and stumbling until he found his balance.  Tony had always said the trick was to find your centre of gravity and walk with a straight spine on the balls of your feet.
Wanting to ensure that Pepper knew remembered that she was in charge, she pressed down on Pepper’s shoulders until she slid down that final inch, screaming as her pussy exploded with pleasure.
Natasha had caught glimpses of Widow and Potts throughout the week, the dynamics between the two were interesting to say the least.  Widow was clearly a dominant Alpha and wanted Potts as her submissive partner.  Potts seemed to be struggling occasionally but the Widow soon put her in her place.  It was not a dynamic that should have worked being that they were both high Alphas, she would need to get into the system and gain access to  Dr Banner’s research and labs as the doctor was always watching Potts and holding quiet conversations with Widow.
Before she had even answered, somehow, they were both through the door and leading her in to her own lounge.  Peter having heard voices bounded down the stairs to see what was going on, stumbling over down the last couple of steps when he caught sight of the two Avengers.
Moving to the kitchenette he picked from the bowl of fruit as he waited for the microwave to heat his mush, or porridge as Winter called it, sprinkling a handful of blueberries over his omega meal supplement he greedily spooned it down.  A 2 litre bottle of cum shake disappeared just as quickly, finally with the edge taken of his hunger and another bottle of cum shake in his hand he went to check on the girls.  The bots beeped in warning for him to be quiet, Dum-E’s camera eye swivelled round to peer at his creator, quietly beeping at him to go rest.  Tony smiled at their antics, the girls were going to have some very protective older siblings watching over them.
He stands there perplexed and pained. Something is wrong. He knows it, feels it – as if he has a phantom limb. He jerks around at the Outriders as they paw at the ground waiting for orders to annihilate him. He understands what he needs to do now.
“Fuck. Fuck a fucking duck,” Tony says and tears the device from the panel. “Pack up. Now that we know, he’s going to come at us – any minute.”
The last jolts Steve and he nearly forgets himself and reacts, but at the last minutes he freezes and clenches his jaw. Of course, Tony would have had an urgency. It would be logical. He would have shared it with someone, someone other than Steve. It hurts like a bolt to the head.
“Yeah so? If it’s true than this is a damned miracle and Captain America is not a private citizen. He happens to be a member of the US Army, MIA for the last 70 years give or take a few. If he’s not Captain America, then he’s certifiable and if you side with him and take him out of here the government is going to go hot shit on your ass, Tony.”
“Okay, so.” He needed to lay out the plan, but he didn’t want to overwhelm Sam. Recruiting him to support a man labeled criminally insane was one thing – to ask him to support a different road, a change in the way things were run – that was something else entirely.
“I’ve been here less than an hour since this morning’s meeting,” Steve responded and that just irritated him even more. He didn’t need to justify anything to Stark. “You want to do this, sure. Okay. Tell me how?” He just wanted Stark to get out of his hair.
When the man smiles and it lights up his eyes, Steve feels the world spin around him. He clears his throat and tries to look away, but not this time – he can’t make himself. He’s captured like one of those entangled particles.
“Onward,” Tony said with a gesture for Steve to lead the way. As they entered the elevator and it closed, Tony quelled his reservations. Once he’d looked at Pepper as an angel. Tony had thought that Malibu and Pepper would be his last refuge when in fact the world literally tumbled down on his head. How could he believe after a quickie blow job and hand job that Steve committed to him? That would be naïve and incredibly stupid. Even with Pepper, Tony fucked it up.
“Like I said, I need someone to help with technical schematics. I need someone who is a fast study and willing to work through the night. I am on a tight schedule.  I only have a few months to get the project completed. I may need to travel some, in order to consult with experts in the field.” Tony stands up, keeping his hand on the desk as he rounds it and then sits on the edge of it. “I need someone quick on their feet, willing to be a personal assistant, a technical drafter, a researcher, and a little bit of a bodyguard when I need to travel.”
“And something did happen, didn’t it?” Tony says softly as he gently prods Steve to stand so that he can pull off the uniform pants. The boots are already set aside. Tony examines the bruise on Steve’s back where the bully stick hit him. “Fuck. I’m going to fucking bring him down.”
They walk in silence the persistent wind their only companion. In the broad distance, Steve studies the cloud cover. Dark gray clouds move swiftly over the sky. Beyond the line of snow, a ridge of mountains looms. Getting out of this rim level presents a brand new problem. He hadn’t gambled on having to climb mountains.
“They weren’t hurting me,” Steve muttered and went to the side table and picked up his track pants. He slipped them on and then pulled on a t-shirt. He had a large burn across his chest. It hurt like hell, but he only cringed as the shirt’s fabric touched it. He’d turned around to dress since he still wasn’t comfortable with sharing changing rooms with women, but that’s how they did it at SHIELD these days.
Bruce could see that she was burning up, the serum eradicating extremis, literally heating it out of her system.  Pepper’s face was flushed and her arms twitching as she rubbed at her prickling skin, he could see that the cool breeze was making her nipples pebble, the silk shirt buttons straining as she twisted and turned.  The tight pants would be unbearable against her heated skin.  Time to test the other aspect of the serum, see how pliable she was to another Alpha’s will;
Tears came to his eyes and he stopped speaking as he remembered seeing the un bonded omegas being schooled and fed fantasies of being mated to the perfect Alpha even though they never met them before bonding, given little choice but to be bonded to that Alpha or face a life of servitude in an Omega House alongside all the sick, old, barren and widowed omegas.
With that he stood and walked to the door biding JARVIS to dim the lights and monitor Tony whilst he slept.
Hulk discarded the fluffy pink towel once he was sure his Daisy Cow was completely dry his large fingers stroked the soft skin massaging in the buttermilk oil until her skin glistened.  He purposely left her enormous udders untouched.
“You look so pretty with your mouth full of cock such a cock slut aren’t you? Perhaps I should keep you gagged all the time, it would certainly be quieter and less likely for you to earn a punishment for saying something wrong.
Tony crawled behind his Alphas, neck and head held high to relieve the tightness of the thick leather punishment collar, mouth held wide open by the attached O ring gag.  This allowed him to breathe as deeply as he could, given his restricted lung capacity but ensured that he could not speak. Drool and cum coated his chin, meaning that he would be getting a punishment spanking for allowing his Alphas cum to go to waste.  He was in a no-win situation, one of his Alphas making, Steve as the first part of his punishment had ordered him to suck off each pack member. Bruce for the first time had agreed to stay and take part in his punishment, eyes flashing green as Tony had gurgled and choked on his thick girth, a pleased rumble from the Hulk as his partly transformed shaft slid down the omega’s throat.
Banner came with his omega to watch Pepper’s second session with Raider, it fascinated him how nothing was taboo in this world, that  scientific advancement was not stymied by endless years of testing and regulation.  It didn’t bother him that this version of Pepper had been reduced to a breeding bitch, he wondered if he could do something like this to Ms Potts, take the snooty woman down a peg or two, her superior attitude had always grated on him and the way she would look down her nose at him after any Hulk out.
“Bruce I think that would be an excellent idea, but I must have your promise that you will not go against my word as Tony’s Alpha and that you will not treat him any differently to how I do.  I cannot have him confused or under the impression he can deviate from my rules whilst he is with you or expect any leniency for bad behaviour.”
Hulk huffed at the mess dripping out of Tony’s ass, retrieving the shower nozzle he easily pushed the tapered head in to the loose gaping hole and set about making his little milk cow’s fuck hole, all fresh and clean. Once he was satisfied he reinserted the dildo, getting Jarvis to inflate the knot to hold it in place.
The President couldn’t hide his enthusiasm at the thought of schooling yet another recalcitrant omega and the political gain of the Prime Minister of England owing him huge favour.
“Come on Jarvis, want to fuck your omega creator? bet you would like to fill me up and make me scream, get me back for all the times I have over ridden your protocols, been reckless and endangered myself and gone against your advice.”
He was an omega and his body was exactly how it was meant to be and now he had two incredible reasons to embrace fully his journey to being the best omega possible and Steve would be with him every step of the way.
“My Tony is never going to be as disobedient and Will full, he will respect and look up to me as his Alpha and abide by my decisions. He will retire from being Iron Man straight away to concentrate on strengthening our bond, I will guide him with a firm steady hand in our relationship and advise him what work he is to prioritize for the good of the Avengers and Stark Industries. He will carry my babies and take care of them himself, it may be old fashioned but that’s how it will be, I was waiting for Tony to mature and settle but with the defeat of Thanos, the world is forever changed, omegas are going to have to understand that there are going to be certain restrictions placed on them for the next few years until the birth rate increases once more, then things can be looked at again.”
Spread your legs bitch, let’s see how wet your cunt is, l am going to prove that you are a just a slutty submissive, trying to pretend you are a dominant bitch.”
Steve talked through each stage of the piercing and fitting of the ring and wand, Bucky watched avidly although slightly pissed that Steve had anaesthetized the area, he had been looking forward to hearing their bitch scream.
“Tony you are beginning to experience you first real unadulterated heat, you are going to finally experience what you were made for. Omegas were created to be dominated to be subservient to the will of their Alpha, to be fucked in every hole, mounted and filled with cum and babies.
After stripping out of his clothes he climbed back on to the bed, straddling the now unconscious Darcy, the effects of the slow acting drug hidden in her food would begin to wear off in the next few minutes, before that he was going to have some fun.  Placing her arms above her head he strapped on the leather wrist cuffs, next the ankle cuffs which he left unattached as he hadn’t decided what position he would finally fuck her in.  Straddling her thighs, he ran his knife up the centre of her t-shirt, her tits sprang free again from the restraining material, they were gorgeous, plump and round with pert hard nipples, there was no sagging or drooping unlike his previous bonded omega’s.  He would make sure they stayed that way even after breeding, modern medicine could provide nearly anything now, that an Alpha wanted for their omega.
Put your hand here and tug on her clit, twisting it slightly, that’s it, your small hands are ideal.  Now you need to push her pussy rings together to form a sheath for her clit and thread it through. It is a tight fit but just tug it through, there we go, now push the crystal tip and the free length up into her cunt.
The promise of being allowed to orgasm had been an effective training method, Tony was an extremely sexual being, but just when his Omega had nearly reached his goal Steve devised a way for Tony to fuck up and fail.  His poor Omega never seemed to realise what his Alpha was doing and became more and more desperate to please and to obey, chasing that ever elusive orgasm.
“Come on Tony, let us hear how much you love being fucked stupid by your Alphas, having your slutty holes filled. Our own little cum dump!"
Tony was convinced that everyone was staring at him and could hear the sound of his pull-up crinkling with every step he took, and he definitely heard sniggering when Steve had to ask for cushion for his seat so he be level with the table.  Throughout the dinner he kept his eyes lowered and just ate and drank whatever Steve gave him, a hard pinch to his thigh ensured that he didn’t refuse the third glass of water.  His stomach ached as his bladder filled, the coldness of his wet pull-up against his genitals uncomfortable and heavy.
“Shh… Tony, such a greedy omega, now you have had a taste of my, cum, you will want it all the time, but what do you need to do to earn such a reward, can you tell me my omega?”
Steve watched as Tony paced up and down getting more and more wound up, his little omega looked so cute and sexy, eyes sparkling, cheeks flushed, his lounge pants hanging off his hips, showing his burgeoning belly roll and outlining his soft little cock.
Tony wriggled on Winter’s lap, trying to line his cunt up with the large bulge in his trousers, whilst making doe eyes at Steve as he licked the last drops of Loki’s milk from his lips.
In the beginning he had fought every time they entered his stall, every time they touched him or cleaned him, each time they pushed a larger plug into his ass hole, put a thicker and heavier cock and ball ring on him.  The first day he didn’t lash out was the day he first scented the presence of an omega outside his stall. His rage dissipated for that few minutes he caught the sweet heavy scent of aroused omega. Each day he followed the routine they had set for him; he was rewarded until he craved the scent of the omega cows gave off.
A balance would be found but first his omega needed to learn to fully submit  at all times to his Alpha in private and in public before he could be given any rewards.
Steve adored how flustered Tony looked, and how he kept glancing down at his caged cock, his mitt covered hands twitching as he restrained himself from touching.  To keep him a bit more off balance before his treatment he decided that now was the time to slip on the new omega drawers that were a bit more, fancy that the plain ones he had been wearing for the last few days.  The soft white cotton was trimmed with delicate lace around the edges of the legs, mother of pearl buttons lined the expanding waistband.  But it was the thin lace panel that held his caged cock in place, yet allowed it to be seen, that had his breath quickening and is own cock stirring.
Days passed, the meagre food supplies ran out, until all he was left with was dried fruit and tap water, but still he was not prepared to give in and follow the instruction written on the parchment left on the table. He was not going to be bullied into being a performing monkey.
Keep him tethered on his back to the breeding bench and ensure that the fucking machine is used for at least four hours twice a day, anal penetration only for the first three days and then gentle cunt stimulation for two days.  After the fifth day the bitch will be able to be pounded in both holes without any fear of tearing his wound.
Now he regretted all his earlier decisions, the Jeans were scratchy against his thighs, the T-shirt to big and left him feeling chilled in the air conditioned limo.  His feet ached with the weight of the trainers as his legs dangled off the seat. A sob escaped as he lost the battle with his bladder and a trickle of pee leaked out the side of his pull-up to stain his jeans.
“Won’t do you any good, struggle all you want but this is happening, branding then cleansing inside and out, your body, especially your cock and balls belong to the Milk Barn now.  Your sole purpose is to breed the cows, to provide a new line of claves for Asgard’s use.”
He doesn’t concentrate on it, lets the data stream to the side of the lens, forgotten and ignored. “But you think he’s the one?”
Lying side by side, Steve’s eyes flitter over his features. His hands cup Tony’s face. “It’s been a long time since we met.”
Finishing up, Steve finds a thick white robe next to the bed that he’s sure wasn’t there when he left the room. He shrugs and because he has no clean clothes or his robe, he puts it on. It’s beyond luxurious. They don’t have anything like this at the Brothel. He rubs his hands up and down the arms -soft and plush. Not exactly sexy. Hopefully, the prince will see beyond that little issue.
“No one was condemned, Steve, especially not you.” His words drift away – lost in the ripples of night surrounding them. “The tesseract might be a passage, a doorway to some other spaces, and it might be linked to some-.”
Steve wondered if Thor was around and just watching them, or if he’d summoned the storm and left them to their own devices. “Any more help available from Thor?” Steve said as he glanced up at the cloud cover and the rain.
Steve glances up at the schematic of the armor; the reds and blues swirl together. He clears his throat and points to the line of the armor. “It’s the form and function. The beauty of the line of the concept. It’s artistic in its fluidity and structure.”
“It seems to follow my mood.” Tony grimaced. “Natasha said I’ll have to learn to control it, so it isn’t so obvious to the outside world. Eventually she said I should be able to.”
“Sort of,” Steve says and leaves it at that, not explaining. Before Tony asks for further details, Steve jumps to another subject. “I didn’t know. Men can marry?”
“I’m not sure what part I’m acting here,” Steve mutters but follows the prince along with the guards to the very exclusive shop. Being embarrassed and shamed for what he needs to do to survive riles him. He doesn’t want to lose his temper in front of Tony.
“Yes, something like that. Plus I could tell how she was wounded and how much danger she felt she was in. It was all communicated through the bond. Not words but feelings and glimpses of life. On top of that I was able to call Sam to the scene to help.” Steve placed the coffee mug on the floor. “It worked like a charm and Sam hadn’t even been bonded for twenty-four hours.”
“If Stark is right, he could hurt himself. He doesn’t know what’s happening. How could he?” Steve only wanted to see Bucky. This morning had been hell. Bucky had acted strange during the last few days of their mission. As they returned, Bucky became more and more possessive of Steve’s time, not letting any of the other Howling Commandos near Steve without his presence. He even snapped at Falsworth when he’d conferenced with Steve over coffee one morning on the trail as Bucky stepped away from the group. It’d gotten uncomfortable and all of them had noticed. “He needs someone to go in there and help him. I’m the obvious choice.”
“Ultron is your creation. You’re the brilliant mind that brought him to life. You’re Doctor Frankenstein and he’s the monster. The book ends with Frankenstein in the arctic looking for the monster. This Passage is through beating the Hulk. The monster.”
She glides right by his sarcastic ‘sure’ and lifts the garment bag. “This is your uniform for today. I’m a little worried about the fit so if you could try it on, I might be able to get a uniform fabricator to alter it.” She shoves the garment bag at him.
The kid looks like Tony just punched him in the gut and then when he bent over from the pain, kicked him in the face.
Steve steams as they get to the elevator and take it to the outer ring. They head toward the dock and only then he realizes they have no guards to protect them. He stops, paralyzed before Tony pulls him onward toward the dock and the ship.
“Tony is fine. I am here on behalf of Ms. Potts.” He rolls his eyes. “I don’t know what forces came over me to accept this minimal chore, but I am here to bring you to the gala.”
“You fucking ungrateful snot. I knew your father was right about you. It’s always about Tony, nothing else matters. Well, I can tell you a lot more in this universe matters than your damaged heart.” He hits Tony in the chest with his pointed fingers. “You can barely survive with this thing implanted in you. What the fuck do you think is going to happen when it fails? I’ll tell you what; the Conclave will be rid of your arrogance that you’re better than everyone.”
“Each group of stars is one of the souls in our pack,” Tony said. He reached up and turned the projection. “This is you, in the middle. You’re the core of it. Everything revolves around you.”
“Well, we have a whole new crew of members mainly made up of homicidal maniacs.” Tony dared Steve with those cunningly brilliant eyes to refute his statement.
Steve can’t help but snicker inwardly. He leads Tony over to the table with the different food, but before the prince picks anything to eat, Stane joins them.
Steve yanked his arm away. “Fine then.” He walked into the small galley kitchen in the apartment that also served as the hallway to the single bedroom and bath. “You can go - I have a lot to get done.”
Steve has no choice; his biology takes over and he falls down to his knees and then puts his face on the cool tile floor with his ass in the air. He can feel his slick wet and heavy at this cleft. The alpha walks over to him and examines his ass, pulling apart his cheeks and sliding a finger into him. Steve judders under his touch and closes his eyes. There’s part of him that wants to run. The last person to touch him had been Tony and that was ages ago. He forces himself to stay put, and remain calm.
Blu huffs and gets up, the large chain clanking. Tony freezes, but the lion only goes to a bone it has tucked in the corner and drags it out. There’s no meat on it; it’s been cleaned by Blu ages ago. He settles down with it between his paws not unlike a dog and starts to gnaw on it. Something hazy comes over his eyes, and Tony recognizes he’s lost its interest. He’s not sure whether to be insulted.
He disconnects because if he stays on the line a minute longer, he might start confessing to her. He’d very nearly spilled the beans about his fake marriage to Pepper as it is.
“Not a missile,” Tony says and then smiles. It looks very nearly angelic as well. “Not a missile at all.”
The clinicians both nodded and something gleeful glanced over their expression. Tony blanched. They would remove his glands now and do whatever Frankensteinian research they wanted to do. Would that release Tony to the winds? Would it be enough?  He wanted nothing to do with it. He wanted to be gone now. He wanted to hold Steve in his arms again and beg forgiveness. If Steve had never gone to that Blood Den in the first place, then Tony would never have taken him – mated him. Now Steve was condemned because of Tony.
“Probably haven’t inhaled a lung full of bleach either,” Tony says and his hand cups Steve’s jaw. “But you’re okay?”
Until the new life he lived become something of a puzzle. At times when he tried to unravel it he felt like a cat with a ball of yarn. It never stopped unrolling and it never stopped knotting around him until frustration tied him.
“But this isn’t Valhalla?” It couldn’t be because it never felt like a heaven to Steve, only another realm or layer of hell. “With all the blood and dead-.”
“You think Nat’s always been preparing for the day when mates become a liability to the vampire conclaves?” Steve asked.
Steve grimaced as Tony petted his wound. “Clint gave up a lot, his life, his family for her. I don’t think he wants to consider that she doesn’t love him.”
“Paying the check,” Steve says. His eyes are too bright as if unshed tears glisten there. “I screwed this whole thing up. I get that, and I am sorry. This is not the way it should have gone or was supposed to go. But then again, things changed – for the better, much better – but the fact is that change.” He shrugs. “It changed everything. I’ll get out-.”
Steve put his hands in his back jeans’ pockets. He stepped backward toward the windows as if he might leap to freedom. “Tony, I don’t have a choice in these matters. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they just happen.”
Maybe Pierce weighed in to defuse the situation. Steve didn’t know but as Pierce stared out across the Potomac River below the Triskelion he said, “Sometimes to build a better world, it means tearing the old one down. And that makes enemies.” Turning to look at Steve, Pierce sized him up and then added, “I wonder, Captain, where do you stand? On the side of progress and a better world or on the side of stagnation where the status quo will surely tear the world apart.”
“Since Master Tony’s parents died, it has been my task to help him in his life. The first few years were difficult for him. He has never accepted his blindness. He won’t.” Jarvis looks disgruntled, frustrated as if he’s remembering something. Maybe at one time Jarvis tried to help Tony find his way to acknowledging his disability and moving his life forward by accepting his new normal. “For him it is a challenge, a mental challenge to overcome. He invented ways to hide it and conceal it. While I might not agree with his approach, I have pledged to always support him.”
“You know I’m right.” Tony keeps his hand on Steve’s shoulder, inching it up to the nape of his neck. “Don’t do this to yourself. We’re going to make it right. We can now that we have you.”
Carefully, Steve places it aside, and then washes Tony’s chest one more time. He checks each of the battery wires, and then disconnects them, hoping he’s right for once. If this is what he thinks it might be, he needs to remove what’s implanted in Tony’s chest first. He’ll only have minutes to do it, the shrapnel will move and kill Tony if Steve doesn’t do it right.
“We – we,” Steve says and spins around looking at the display as Tony wipes it out of existence. “What’s this?”
“Stark,” he repeated and finished off his first burger. Going to the bag, he pulled out the second burger with bacon and unwrapped it. He tried not to remember that dinner with Stark, how awkward and uncomfortable it had been. How Stark kept his eyes trained on something over Steve’s shoulder, so much so that Steve turned around to see if something – a bug or something – was crawling around on the high back of the wooden bench.
As Tony drank down the thick blood, he experienced the energy of the serum through him. His veins answered it. When he mated with Steve for the first time, Tony never knew the qualities and benefits of blood laced with the super soldier serum. An immortal made superior in so many ways. Natasha had only smirked at him when he described it as feeling like he sat on the top of Mount Olympus. He became drunk with it, an addict for Steve and his blood. Their mating had been fast and quick, that first time.  Tony hadn’t even known Steve’s name, hadn’t known that he’d encountered the famous Captain America of World War II now one of the Captains of the V-Corps.
“Steve.” The word was lightly spoken and he tried to parse who said it. Was it his mother? A hand touched his face and he moved into it. It comforted and he sought the solace. He ached. “Steve, can you hear me?”
“Lessons have been offered. Wong has done his best to teach the pack but the whole lot of you tend to be loose cannons. What other pack would be so dispersed for so long!” Strange’s cloak bristled at his words.
Steve settles his wing around Tony and he feels it as well, that unspoken, unseen bond. It forms between them, stronger.
The question is asked practically in his ear. He startles and turns around to find Justin Hammer standing far too close to him. Steve takes a jerky step backward, knocking into the table. “Sorry, sir.”
Steve got on the bed, kneeing his way over to Tony. “Sure.” Tony joined him on the bed and went to unbutton Steve’s shirt – though his hands were shaking. Steve clasped them. “I’m nervous too.”
“No, I want you to stay,” Tony says. He shifts in bed, sitting up a little. Estane’s training be damned. “It doesn’t have to be anything. Just stay.”
Jamison eyed him with a glare. The man hates it when Tony steps on his toes. Shrugging, Tony goes to the ladder down to the meeting room level. “Chop, chop, we have bills to pay, you know.”
Steve yanks a bit on the reins to stop Shield from chewing on the grasses. The damned horse can sometimes spend the whole ride nipping for a snack.
No time to consider the consequences now. Steve heaved himself to his feet and went to the closet. He pulled out his pants and shirt. He dressed as quickly as he dared considering the room spun around if he moved too fast. He grabbed hold of his holster for the shield and clipped it on, and then slipped on the shield. He felt whole and protected with the shield, even though he wasn’t certain he could actually throw it with any accuracy at this point. Going to the bedside table, he retrieved the Gatorade there, snapped it open, and drank it down. He pulled out the door, searched around and found the iron pills. He down a few and finished off the rest of the Gatorade.
“No, that little shit never does give up.” The voice sounded tired and Tony whipped around to meet Bucky shuffling over to the group from his wing of the medical floor. A large white gauze covered his stump and he held his shoulders hunched forward. “He ain’t going to give up I can tell you that.”
“If being like Bruce means I’m concerned for your welfare, then yes, I would think so,” Steve says and realizes as he states it that he’s more than concerned, he’s worried, a slow churning anxiety has seeded itself inside Steve. It’s like anything these days. He’s afraid of losing what he has ever since his experiences in the war.
Tony sets the toy on his pillow, wipes away the tears from his eyes, stands up from the bed. He straightens his jacket and heads to his workshop, he knows what he has to do. It might be consider by some as a lark, a fool’s move, but Tony’s life has been plagued by foolishness. For the first time, he knows what he needs to do, and while the world may judge him as reckless, in his heart of heart’s he hears a whisper. It’s something, a need to do, if he doesn’t he might as well rip the arc reactor out of his chest now, and wait for the shrapnel to pierce his heart.
Steve waves him off. “No. We get rid of everything else in the world. You’ve been able to do it before. Shift things. Shit, you just did it when Ultron was going to have Natasha shoot me. Get rid of everything.”
“The definition of life was first described by an alpha – so doesn’t that muddy the waters?” Steven says.
She freed his hand, but she stroked it once. “You did a wonderful thing for him. Your sacrifice changed him. If you hadn’t, he’d be condemned.”
He spins on his heels. “I mean that alternate realities and different dimensions could exist, intermingle, and warp through that connection. The tesseract is a doorway. Red Skull harnessed it’s energy as a power source for weapons, but what if – what if exposure causes doorways to open, not only through space but through dimensions?”
Steve frowns. It makes no sense. Why here? Why now? And then he studies Tony – is it really Tony? Could it be another mirage of Ultron’s? Steve leans over and grunts for the effort, but he reaches out all the same, reaches out to touch Tony. “You?”
The dining room is decorated with the finest furniture. A table for eight with carved wood and a brilliant candle chandelier over it. The china cabinet in the corner shows off the best porcelain dishes and crystal. Steve looks down at his work worn hands, and can’t remember when he ate off anything as fine and perfect. He’s only ever eaten out of tin cans or wooden plates with spoons. He drinks from tin cups, mason jars, or leather pouches.
“I am not your son, and you are not anyone I want to talk to. He wanted your help, do you know that? But no, you left him to the streets and he had no other choice.”
Tony seizes the cash and throws it to the floor. “I want to talk, I want to know you, I don’t want to fuck. I want to-.”
Tony wasted no time. He manhandled Steve back onto the gurney, throwing the blanket over him. Pale and weak, his whole body shaking uncontrollably, Steve reached out a hand to touch Tony’s chest where it glowed. “I’m dreaming,” he murmured and fell unconscious.
“Where are you getting the veggies?” Tony asks and places the battery on the bench next to the single burner hot plate.
But they’d only just begun the plans to remodel and fix the Tower. She’d gone over them with him only a day or so ago. They’d planned out the floors, given each Avenger their own floor and put together an area for training and another lounge for relaxing. The whole new design would be spectacular in classic Stark fashion, but it wasn’t spectacular. Not anymore. He didn’t want them around. He didn’t want to be anywhere near pain in the ass Capsicle. Who wanted to associate with someone from his grandpa’s generation who seriously had a stick up his ass? He should just wipe clean the ideas for the Tower remodel and put it back to business and rental space. He was a business man after all, not just a philanthropist. He needed to make money to be able to keep giving it away.
