Sherlock glanced sideways at him, "None particularly." After a few moments of silence he spoke again, "Do you like anyone?"
"That's hard stuff," his dad agreed. "Thanks for letting me know. I'm proud of you son, I got your report card today, all As!"
"Do you think you could help me after school? I'll have to ask my dad but I can probably pay you to tutor me," John asked as they packed up their notebooks.
Harry and their dad stared at him in shocked silence for a moment before he decided to leave and stormed out of the house. He didn't know where he would go, but suddenly the night air wasn't cold to him and it didn't matter if he ended up sleeping under a bridge, he just needed to get out of that house.
He sat there on the bed trying not to think of anything at all for a few moments; he'd almost managed it when Sherlock came back in with an arm load of clothes, "Mrs. Hudson said she can wash your uniform tonight if you'd like, that way you don't have to go home for new ones."
"It was good, I'm almost done with the assignment." He decided to press his luck and ask instead of risk getting caught sneaking out, "Do you think I could go back to his place tonight? He said something about catching a movie or something."
"Yes. Yes however he did not find me of his own intention. I later learned that the morning after my disappearance my uncle created a search party to try to find me. They were unsuccessful and unable to find a trail so they gave me up as kidnapped. A bounty was issued for Lord Moran as well as for my safe return. As the months drug on my uncle lost faith that I would be found and was attempting to resolve how to approach the matriarch, my grandmother, about the situation when he received a letter from Sebastian informing him what I had done. He beseeched my uncle for permission to claim me as his next fledgling, to raise and care for me. My uncle denied him, knowing that as an Oaken Solvanar our families were bitter enemies and having my blood in his line would complicate the tentative truce between the twelve families beyond the point of war. Unfortunately Sebastian was not pleased with that response as he had grown fond of me and wished to claim me as his mate. My uncle arrived a few weeks later to recover me but Sebastian drug his visit out in an attempt to keep me. It was only when I personally asked to be allowed to consider the decision myself until I came of age that he relented and let me free. I met Moriarty shortly after that and I believe Moriarty overheard part of my conversation with my grandmother where she explained I was a mender and informed me of bits of what my life would hold."
"You bastard! You complete and utter ass!" John shouted, but his voice was muffled against Sherlock's chest. Sherlock slowly, tentatively wrapped his arms around John, sighing with relief when he didn't pull away. "Why did you do this to me?! WHY?!"
"Alright, I'll let the doctor know so we can increase your morphine drip." The nurse nodded and stepped out of the room.
“My love has not gone; however, we have both been changed by our experiences. We will need to learn who the other is now. To embrace the journey and let it make us stronger.” He leaned down and peppered small kisses all over John’s face, trying to reassure him.
"As always John is oblivious to the truths right in front of him." Sherlock teased, sweeping past them to his chair. He popped his coat collar up and sat in the chair glaring at the door, assuming his 'busy' routine again. They looked up as they heard footsteps on the stairs.
"Lord Mycroft, leader of this coven - grant me your nocturnal crown. Remove me from the cycle of the sun and birth me into the phases of the moon so that I may bring honor unto your coven and family for all the ages of the world." John whispered, bowing his head. "I follow the rules of the Coven matriarch and the one she has deemed leader, you, the coven father. I give all of my loyalty to ensuring this family is protected and honored. I submit to your will asking only that you grant me the right to remain at my beloveds' side for all the ages of the world."
"I quite agree. We shall accept this treaty." Sherlock growled and stood stalking from the room, leaving the two alone. Mycroft smiled as John stood and moved closer to him, a pained and worried look on his face. "He is worried for you, my little one."
“The same wound…” John mumbled to himself, checking over the body.  Sherlock felt it nag at his mind but the two fell silent as they took in the details of the scene.
"God you're a tease! Fucking touch me!" John demanded, moving to grab Sherlock with his left hand, but Sherlock smirked and pinned his arms to the bed.
"That is precisely what we are endeavoring to find out." Mycroft replied softly, fading into the shadows as they approached the manor.
"You're forgiven." He said softly and Hamish threw his arms around his neck with a squeal of joy. He sighed and tightened his arms around his nephew. Greg couldn't hold out and dissolved into giggles.
“John? Is everything…” Sherlock’s voice echoed down the walk from the house and his aura whipped up into a fury as he saw the scene in front of him. He watched as Sebastian stepped back from John and moved to his husband’s side, squeezing his shoulder possessively. “Oh, good evening Lord Moran, I see you finally found a way to speak with
Elizabeth huffed in anger and turned to her servant, barking orders and storming out of the house. The two brothers followed John and once they were sure Elizabeth was gone, they enfolded him in an embrace, his head on Mycroft's chest, and held him as he sobbed.
“To the uneducated yes.” Mycroft said soothingly. “However allow me to explain what this particular punishment entails. When a vampire chooses to sleep they take blood and simply go to rest the next dayfall. The remain in their chambers and simply allow the blood to slowly fade until they become still, almost as if they are made of stone. In this case James Moriarty will be put into a tiny chamber, much like a mortal coffin. His blood will be drained by his Sire until he is on the edge of death. Then he will be bolted into the chamber where he will be fed only a nominal amount of blood daily for the next fifty years. Thus for fifty years he shall be suffering on the edge of death. They will keep him, a prisoner of his own mind, for that time. In most cases a vampire who has gone through this sort of punishment no longer remembers themselves when they are awoken.”
"No, because if it had been I would have pumped the damn thing full of bullets." He growled and from the doorway Sherlock's eyes went wide. Not there?
"What do you mean?" He tensed, Hamish grunting slightly as John unconsciously tightened his arms. Sherlock stopped pacing and looked directly at Jacob, fixing him with his most piercing stare.
He became vaguely aware of the conversation floating up the stairs, something about the new gaggle of reporters that had shown up outside the flat following the Yard's article. It took several minutes for John to regain full control of his body and he forced himself back to his original goal of straightening his room. He sorted through his wardrobe finding an outfit that would be suitable for dinner and wouldn't look like he was wearing clothes ten sizes too big for him. He licked his lips and moaned again, still tasting Sherlock on them. His mind and nerves were already behaving like a teenage boy, not a promising start to his first actual date with Sherlock Holmes. He gathered the things he needed and showered and shaved. He put on his outfit, hoping to use the rest of the afternoon to feel comfortable in it again. After spending twenty minutes fussing with his hair he gave up and made his entrance into the living room. Sherlock was playing the violin but opened his eyes to survey John and gave him a purely indecent look before returning to his music. Mrs. Hudson was sitting in John's arm chair drinking a cup of tea. When John met her eyes he forced himself not to blush but smiled quite sheepishly.
"Hush, John. I've got you, I'm here." Sherlock said and repeated it four times before John seemed to just collapse again him. He pulled John into himself with his left arm, almost crushing John to him. "I'm here, focus on me John. Please…" He whispered feeling like he was trying to focus through a tunnel.
"You two bloody idiots," Greg chided his voice thick with emotion. "I like taking care of Hamish, but I don't want him that bad."
"No," Sherlock grabbed his hand, making him turn back to look at him. "So I would let myself feel." He pulled John into him again and kissed him, cutting off John's planned angry retort. His hands gently reaching up and caressing his sandy hair. He ruffled it slightly as they broke apart. "You need me to be here with you now. To help you. So let me help." He whispered.
“Look,” John said suddenly, very agitated. “I know what I’m doing. I'm not an idiot despite what you two think." His voice was tight with anger. "I know that this could all go wrong and I could end up next to that box of bricks and dirt. I know I'm going to end up in the hospital and on the edge of darkness. I think that I have proven by now, Mycroft, that I am perfectly capable of handling myself in the face of danger. I was not crippled by terrorists, or war, or C4 strapped to my chest, or a sniper's laser sight pointed at my chest. The only thing that has ever unseated me was the belief that your brother was dead! This is nothing! This is a fumbling girl on a power trip! I can handle this so please, all of you, stop treating me like a child!" Sherlock was caught off guard by the tension in John's voice and sighed, allowing himself to relax.
“Simply because you have not moved.” John purred again, licking a stripe up the side of Sherlock’s neck before letting him go. Sherlock turned on his heel and immediately began for the house. John’s chuckle following him inside.
“Sherlock Holmes!” John growled but Sherlock was all over him. The adrenaline of the fight and his passion at hearing John uttering words in another tongue changing the air in the room from post-fight to pure lust. “Sherlock,” John grunted even as Sherlock pushed his wet coat off his shoulders. “SHERLOCK!”
." Sherlock emphasized. He desperately wanted John to think for the moment and not feel. To understand what he was trying to say.
"The two women were both lovers of the owner of the jewelry store broken into last week." Sherlock added with a disappointed sigh. "They got into a fight and one of them shot the other. The shooter was then killed by their lover in a fit of passionate rage. I told you that last week, Lestrade. Or have you been listening to Anderson again?" Sherlock's tone was abrasive. Making it clear that this interruption was very unwelcome.
“Then why are we still out here?” Sherlock forced out, his voice quivering as his arousal soared and his body seemed to thrum with his desire. John smirked, somehow knowing that though Sherlock was trying to seem in control, he was quivering with need.
"Mycroft, you may interrogate them as you wish, however I suggest we do so quickly." Sebastian stepped back, his eyes moving to where Sherlock held John.
John grunted awake his head felt like it was split in two pieces. His vision swam in front of his eyes for a few minutes as he tried to recall what had happened. Right, someone had drugged Hamish and hit in him the back of the head. No, not just any someone had hurt him and his son, no his God forsaken
"I don't think, despite all of the times we went to get food, that I ever just watched you as you ate. It's rather mesmerizing." A wicked grin, John blushed more. He turned his attention back to his biscuit but almost choked when Sherlock spoke next. "When?" He demanded and though John knew exactly what he meant, he feigned ignorance.
“I need to know, John. There is a rift in the coven and before it grows wider I need to understand what it was that happened that made the brothers become so distant and what transpired that made you turn away from Mycroft?” He finished softly, leaning back in his chair. John sighed and stared into the fire for a moment.
They were in a large room made of some sort of smooth stone and illuminated with a golden glow from several lighting fixtures around the room. The entire room was underground and there was only one entrance set far against the wall opposite the area he was in. He and Hamish were alone and trapped in what looked like a large cage, the only furnishing was a bed built into the wall where Hamish was lying shivering. John was on the floor and his back gave a painful ache. His wedding ring, pistol, and cell phone were missing. Hamish looked to be okay, no injuries or bleeding that John could see which was a relief. John himself seemed to only have the bump on the head and one black eye. He struggled to remain sturdy on his feet, trying to show strength in front of the obviously terrified little boy.
Sherlock sank down so he was sitting with his back to the door, tears in his eyes as he let his head fall back with a loud thump against the door. It had been almost two months since Lady Elizabeth's visit and her carefully programmed words had ruined the shaking foundation the Holmes men had put together on shaking bricks to heal John. Since then John returned to his own bedroom and kept himself more often than not locked up in the library alone. He refused to admit Sherlock no matter how hard Sherlock pleaded, a fact that seemed, at least to Sherlock, that John no longer wished to be his mate. Sherlock knew logically that John was trying to make his way through the darkness inside his heart and mind, that he was being affected still by the power of the herb, and that he was resorting to the darkness of ill opinions put on him in childhood - but the pain of rejection still stung strong. John refused to allow Sherlock to bestow any comfort upon him, even the simple comfort of his presence in the same room and it left Sherlock aching inside. Anthea tensed as Sherlock put his head on his knees and began to cry in frustration. She turned on her heel and headed towards Mycroft's study.
“I know you are worried and I know why.” John said softly, stepping closer to Mycroft. He kissed him softly. “You must go ahead to hold the boat for us, or else we may not make it in time. If anything should happen we shall send for you immediately. A rider on a single horse would find it easy to gain on you if something terrible should occur to us. It will be alright, my Sire.”
little mender." He purred as they entered his study, but he looked up to survey them closely.  Sherlock's face was dark and brooding. Mycroft knew it would be only a matter of time before he sank into one of his 'dark moods.' "You've come home early and directly to me upon your arrival which can only mean something of import has happened." He motioned for them to sit, which John did not do. Sherlock threw himself angrily down on the couch as John timidly handed him the letter. Mycroft looked up between the two of them as he saw the writing on the envelope.
"Here, let me." John laughed softly as he took over the tea. "I think there's still a tin of biscuits on the counter. Mrs. Hudson bought them for me last week."
"Please let me go." He pleaded, sobbing as he tried to push away from Sherlock. His arms still weak and shaking.
"Aside from half drowned in this cup of tea, I'm... Getting there." John proffered, trying to actually drink his tea this time.
Sherlock was confused and he did not like the feeling much at all. John's body language went from rigid to protective, shielding Jacob from something. The man had just punched him in the face and now they were chatting away without respect to the fact Sherlock couldn't understand them and it was purely infuriating. He was missing out on vital information because of this and John was being purely oblivious to it. His irritation sky rocketed and he couldn't keep his mouth shut any longer.
"He left two days ago... After..." Moriarty looked down, flushing with shame but neither Mycroft nor Sherlock missed the small smirk at the corners of his mouth as Elizabeth immediately moved to comfort him.
"Yes, since we are on the subject - I must continue to break your rule of no work at the table and ask you something of crucial importance. Especially to me." A tremble ran through John's body as Sherlock spoke, but John fought the alcohol that muddled his brain to focus. Words tumbling free of his mouth before he could stop himself.
"And you have every right to be." She squeezed his hand and saw his thoughts drifting. "Harry's death wasn't your fault John. We couldn't have known what your father would do."
“Previous military experience, judging by the evenness of his stride.” Sherlock continued on. “He attacked from a close distance but the victim was concerned about his, he was turned slightly away from him. Victim died slowly, but there is no blood to suggest he bled out. Likely he was administered a poison to continue the snake bite theory that has pervaded these cases. In his last moments he wrote a note to John, because he was coming to Baker Street to see us. He is the second son of James Pendergrass, and with his daughter Elisa also dead his entire heritage has been destroyed."
"James Pendergrass is your uncle." Sherlock sighed softly, furrowing his brow. "We were here together weren't we? When he was murdered..."
"We'll make breakfast." Sherlock offered as he reached up to scratch his nose. There was a brief flash of pink and John had to fight not to laugh.
“Where you go, I go.” John replied simply before standing, he pulled Sherlock to him claiming his lips and gently biting them as he pulled back.
"Sherlock you are an adult, I understand wanting to entertain childish notions but there is a time and a place for that."
John grunted and wiggled a bit, the aching need in his cock pressing everything else out of his mind. Sherlock was angry and desperate to relieve a whole host of emotion he was holding inside. John didn't mind letting him use his body this way, it thrilled him. Another smack came down and John cried out in pleasure, feeling the red bloom across his sensitive cheeks.
"I'm going to go check in with Georgina and be sure she doesn't require anything else of us before the party. Greg I'll let you relax a bit here, shall I?"
Marcus snapped his finger and two men appeared beside him. The door to the cage was unlocked and one of the men walked forward and tried to pry Hamish out of John's hands. But John wasn't having that. He fought with them and did well too, until one of them knocked him around the head again. Hamish was removed from his arms and given another sedative as John blacked out. When he woke next the first thing he noticed was tingling in his hands and feet. The second thing he noticed was that he was not in the cage with Hamish anyone and Hamish was out cold on the bed.
"That sounds very promising." Sherlock winked and stood, he waited for John helping him back into his coat and gently brushing his skin on his neck as he did. John blushed but made no other response.
"Oh Christ..." Lestrade shook his head. "It always gets better with you two doesn't it? Alright then."
"This is different with you..." John protested but was cut off when Mycroft's mouth was on his again.
Gah! How has it been a year already? Adulting sucks as does Social Distancing and COVID-19. I am however making the most of it by posting a new chapter.
"Ja, aber er muss in der Lage, dich verstehen sein." He smirked and pointed to the highly affronted Sherlock, who was pacing and looking absolutely livid. Not this again. John was tense and it bothered Sherlock that there was a sense of fear crawling into his own emotional pool and making him uncertain how to proceed.
"You do not know how I feel. I heard the words you spoke, Sherlock and you are wrong." John whispered, forcing Sherlock to meet his gaze. "I do not desire in any way to be anything other than your mate." Sherlock's eyes grew wide as John stepped a bit closer to him. "I have never wanted an end to our bond, I simply did not believe you could tolerate a sudden distance from me."
“S-Sherlock?” John asked very quietly. He barely blinked before he was surrounded by Sherlock, those long arms enveloping him in a warm embrace. John's body shivered as he felt the shift in Sherlock's energy, tears flowing slowly at first but the heavier as the moments passed.
Sherlock's mind had been rampant with thoughts of his brother since their last bout against this blood passion in the little mender.  Thoughts that he'd locked away as mere folly barreling to the surface as his gaze burned into his brother's form. He had to concede that watching how easily his brother worked his lover into a frenzy had become deeply pleasuring. Perhaps the situation was now established enough it would allow Sherlock to conduct an experiment. He slowly ghosted his fingers up over his brother's shoulder and across neck, raising an eyebrow with a smirk as he saw goose pimples cover his brother's flesh. Mycroft let out a soft moan, pulling up and away from John's mouth before turning to look at his brother with a confused and incredulous glare. John was caught between his own desperation and the slow smoldering heat passing between the brother's glances, his own breath hitching as it was sucked from his lungs by the fire burning between them.  Mycroft felt his skin flutter as Sherlock wound his fingers in his hair and tugged gently, his confusion deepening. This was not arranged or discussed, though if he was honest it was also not... Unwelcome. A smirk barely twitched at the edge of Sherlock's mouth before he pressed up and kissed his brother, enjoying the surprised moans that came from both his brother and their desperate lover. There was a struggle and suddenly Sherlock was pressed back into the bed, Mycroft plundering his mouth and grasping his hair possessively. John whimpered and struggled but half of Mycroft's body was still on him, keeping him pinned to the bed. The noises issuing from the throats of the brothers resonated in John until his entire body felt like it was liquid.
Greg grunted as the medical team arrived and helped him up. They started treating his wounds as Mycroft and Sherlock swept around the house searching for clues. After about twenty minutes the two brothers reconvened at the make shift medical station, Mycroft's mouth tightened in a thin line.
"He has a fair point brother. He observes her character truthfully." Sherlock whispered. He had never heard someone so accurately describe another person's behavior with the sort of clarity normally reserved for himself and his brother. "I believe his plan to bring Lady Elizabeth's child into the world safely is a sound one, though I am not sure how I feel about it myself."
“My John…” Sherlock muttered softly, sweeping over and sinking to his knees before John in his chair. “Do not do this, do not grant me grace when I deserve scolding.” He admonished the Mender as he slowly took the others’ hands in his own. John tried to use the motion to force the Detective to stand, however, he refused to budge. “You give me far more grace than I should be allowed. I turned away from you when you proclaimed one of our greatest enemies had returned. I left you alone with the darkness inside your mind.” He took the Mender’s hands in his own, rubbing his thumb over the scar on the back of John’s right hand. A cut from one of the silver daggers Moran had used on him.
“Oh…” Sherlock whispered, stepping close to them. “It has been enough time has it not? Mycroft, please be sensible. We shall be fine.” Sherlock urged.
"Caring is not a disadvantage Mycroft. That's what this has proven to me. That having John at my side has saved my life in more ways than I previously imagined."
"I know I am no longer alone! I did not expect to need to be in my mind palace for as long as this task required! I also had been informed by him that you would care for him should I be unable to do so and it seems you have not taken to your task very well!" He leaned over their faces almost touching.
Sherlock stumbled back slightly, holding his face. John had frozen exactly where his hand had made contact with Sherlock's cheek. He was panting for breath, anger pouring out of every part of him. But the slap had been held back. Sherlock had felt the moment when John tried to stop himself. There was still hope. He'd slapped him, not punched him. There was ringing silence for two minutes before Sherlock picked up the tea and offered it to him.
"I have hardly spoken with him in months! I simply wanted to spend one night with him! ONE!" John's rage was quiet but furious.
“Come along now Sebby. We have a boat to meet.” James ordered and the group retreated. Sherlock collapsing over and John trying desperately to get up.
“Because Jason, the previous dishwasher, moved home to Belfast and we were short-staffed,” she says. She changes knives and resumes her sharpening, turning away from them. “Come and find me in the back when you’re finished with the rest. I’ll walk you through the freezer and tell you whatever you need to know.”
A thrill goes through Sherlock: this is precisely what he had in mind, too. He grazes John’s right cheek with his bottom teeth and makes a low hum of agreement before getting swiftly to his feet again. “Yes,” he says into John’s ear, his hands still stroking John’s erection, and he feels it leap as he says it.
Sherlock looks at him for a long time, hardly believing his own good fortune. “You’re rather incredible, you know,” he says, and John shakes his head.
John nods. “More or less, yeah. I… couldn’t go back to the flat. Mary’s flat. I hadn’t worked out what to say or do. She texted me sometimes, usually guilt trips over my missing appointments about the baby. I usually just didn’t even answer.”
“It might stop by then,” Molly says, not caring much one way or another. She’s got her umbrella. She sits up and stretches, stiff from the long day in the lab and then sitting in the same position for the last hour.
Sherlock’s face lights up. “Oh! Yes, over on Clerkenwell! Brilliant idea! I’m famished, actually. When did we last eat?”
Sherlock looks at him keenly, scanning his face and eyes for any sign of insincerity. When he doesn’t find any, he takes a deep breath. “You’re the best friend anyone could ever ask for,” he says intensely. “I mean that, John. The very best.”
Mrs Hudson makes conciliatory gestures. “Nothing, nothing. Not my place. I know. Only I notice he’s stopped wearing his wedding ring, too. It was about time.” She stoops to pick up Rosie’s carrier. “Where should I put this, then?”
a rather momentous thing, when you put it that way,” he says eventually. “And you’re not incorrect about the complications that having a young child with us would pose. However, if this is the – not ‘cost’, but – the reality of what it would mean for us to have a life together, then I’m more than willing to do whatever it would take, John. I’ve always known that I would do whatever it took to allow you to have the life that you want. I just – if that could include me, that’s the only thing I would ask. I would do anything with and for you. Including to raise this child with you – as her parent, if you would trust me with that role.”
John thinks of another person, any other person, sharing Baker Street with them, just above them in his old bedroom, and feels deeply reluctant. “I suppose that’s one option,” he says slowly. “It’s just… then we’d all be sharing the kitchen and public spaces, and it’s not a huge flat as it is… I don’t really want someone else living with us.”
Lucas opens his mouth, about to make a hot denial, but before he can speak, Lestrade walks into the office behind Sherlock, hands pushed deeply into the pockets of his coat.
“It’s true,” he agrees. “I also run experiments that take over the kitchen sometimes. John doesn’t like that.”
Sherlock’s arms fold themselves instinctively around John’s shoulders in return, in a way that already feels terribly, intimately familiar. “Me too, honestly,” he says, angling to make John laugh.
He doesn’t say anything, though, the air between them too charged. Instead, he looks questioningly down the corridor toward his bedroom, then back at John, and John nods again, and follows him out of the kitchen.
Mary nods toward his jacket pocket. “I’ve sent you the file with the results. I’ve known since she was six months old. She’s not your daughter, and you are never going to see her again.”
Molly blinks and swallows. “I always thought so,” she says, and he’s relieved to hear the evenness of her tone. “Even when I was trying to persuade myself otherwise, I always thought so.” She looks down at the daisies, masking her eyes, and nods. “Thank you for telling me at last.”
John wakes smiling, Sherlock’s hair in his face. He’s asleep, still draped over John like a blanket and snoring lightly, to John’s amusement. He’s never heard Sherlock snore before. He listens. Rosie is still sleeping, her breathing unchanged. He turns his head to look at the clock on the night stand but Sherlock’s head is blocking his view.
That afternoon, they’re lying on the sitting room carpet with Rosie between them. Sherlock has been trying to read her a book but she’s more interested in banging her plastic rings together. John is more interested in him, reaching across to stroke Sherlock’s thigh and arse cheek as he attempts to concentrate on the book.
“You needn’t look so pleased about it,” John reminds him, but the corners of his mouth are tugging into a smile in spite of himself.
“Good,” Ella says. “Sherlock, you mentioned that you’ve also discussed your own sexual history. Have you discussed John’s?”
Sherlock looks up at him, then smiles. He ducks his head again, types something and clicks, and their conversation subsides.
Sherlock stands up abruptly and goes over to the stained glass window, his back to her. “I… don’t think about it,” he says, his voice low. “It doesn’t matter now.”
I’ve already got the zip-tie in my hands. “Sorry about this,” I say, hauling him to his feet and cuffing him almost before he’s figured out what’s happening.
“Did you want it to?” John’s mouth is set, asking as though already steeling himself for Sherlock’s answer.
After a little while, they get up jointly and move to the bed, pulling off their dressing gowns and tumbling down onto the covers together, using the remote controls to shut off the lights and the fire. They move together, kissing all the while, bodies fitting back together in warm, familiar, need-driven intimacy, moving together, their pleasure twining and becoming one need, one insistent, rising, spiking pulse of climax, and then it’s all breath, bodies heaving, hands stroking hair off sweaty foreheads, legs shaking as the aftershocks shiver through both their frames, arms around each other as they fall asleep.
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Please. Spare me. Everyone who’s ever seen the two of you knows otherwise. Let’s not dance around it. I don’t know what sort of mental gymnastics it takes for you to deny your own feelings in this bizarre relationship the two of you term as being ‘best friends’, but it’s genuinely painful to observe. He loves you and you surely know it. You must. And your own feelings are just as obvious. I won’t force you to admit it, but please don’t imagine that I’m an idiot, even in this particular respect. My point is this: your presence in his life will only fuel his hope that one day, perhaps, should you ever deem him worthy, you might actually allow yourself to return his feelings. Sherlock is rather more perceptive than the average and you must know that he is almost certainly aware of the potential for feelings on your side. He likely also believes that you would never give in to them, owing to your persistent feelings of victimhood on your side as well as your general contempt for him. You make both unmistakeably clear. But as long as you’re here, in his life, he will hope. I’m given to understand that it’s simply human nature. Even Sherlock’s. So if you now choose to pursue Mary, whether or not you succeed in mounting some sort of reconciliation with her, whether or not you then choose to return to London with her – assuming you could persuade her to do so in the first place – you would then reinstate the awkward triangle that resulted in one of the least happy phases in my brother’s recent life as a permanent state. This, I will not permit. Thereby I am letting you know that, should Mary set foot on British soil and thereby the MI5’s jurisdiction, I will have her arrested at once.” He indicates the bullet again.
Their bags are packed and sitting at the top of the stairs, ready to go. Gwyneth brought Rosie home just after one, as promised, and Rosie was promptly put down for a nap. Now she’s awake, though, which is all they’ve been waiting for. They could have woken her, as John pointed out, but her mood is sure to be improved by waking up when her nap comes to its natural end, and they’d all prefer a cheerful toddler than a fussing one, they agreed.
John settles back into his chair and finds the page he was on, and companionable silence takes over again. Sherlock steals several looks at the glasses, and John in them, over the top of his book. John catches him the fifth or maybe sixth time. “What?” he asks, his voice suspicious.
The surprising warmth of his mouth, the heat of his body and arm, the fact that it’s so immediately addictive, all culminate and make John want to turn instantly into that heat, and perhaps that’s what makes him tense. As soon as the conversation’s turned away from them and onto speculation about today’s breakfast, John turns to Sherlock, drops his voice and says, through a tight jaw, “Don’t get carried away with this whole cover bit, all right?”
After Christmas, they came home and fell back into what are now impending wedding plans. Sherlock stopped taking cases in November and John still hasn’t returned to any clinic, so they’re at home a good deal. Nevertheless, Sherlock manages to make his arrangements without John noticing. On the eleventh of January over breakfast, Sherlock asks casually if John has any plans for the following evening. John reminds him that they’re going for a suit fitting in the afternoon, which Sherlock acknowledges and says he hadn’t forgotten. John then concedes that the evening seems to be open.
“That chicken smells so good, it’s killing me,” John says from the kitchen table, and Sherlock looks over at him and feels a wave of affection so thick that it nearly hurts.
Emboldened, Sherlock experiments, using every resource available to him: his tongue, the inner walls of his cheeks, his hands. He turns properly onto his front and bobs his head up and down the length of John’s shaft, sucking and licking and observing every minute shift in the taste of the fluid seeping steadily from the head of John’s penis. (Should he call it a cock, he wonders. Perhaps. He’s woefully unfamiliar with the vernacular.) John is pushing upward in a gentle rhythm, not forcing anything, but moaning steadily, one forearm flung across his forehead. Sherlock detects that his orgasm is approaching and increases his speed until John is panting shallowly, then jerks his fist rapidly along John’s length, sucking hard at his head, rubbing his tongue against the slit, and that’s what does it. John gasps and without warning, Sherlock’s mouth is flooded with salty release. John’s breath gusts out from between his teeth and his penis twitches and erupts again. Sherlock swallows it down, a bit escaping the corner of his mouth. He keeps sucking until John stops coming, and when a different sort of shock runs through John’s body, Sherlock releases him.
Sherlock makes no effort to resist this, his pulse thudding in his throat against John’s lips, lifting his chin to give John better access. It’s racing, actually, John realises, and suddenly wonders if Sherlock is dreading him seeing the bullet scar again and having the same problem as last time. He steels himself. (
They listen to the click of her heels descending, to the front door. When it closes, Sherlock looks at him and his lips press together a little, possibly self-conscious. John gets to his feet, barely breathing, his eyes on Sherlock and Sherlock alone.
! And there’s more. I’ve got questions, and you’ve been holding out on me. I want to know the truth, for once, and you are going to give it to me.”
I look back over my shoulder, always curious to see if it will work, even though it nearly always does. The kindling catches and Sherlock bends over to blow gently at the base of the fire and it occurs to me again that I’m impossibly, hopelessly, helplessly in love with him and always have been.
He puts the rest of it away in the cupboards and thinks about how normal this feels already. He was here all the time anyway during the construction, passing Rosie off on whoever was free to take her, helping rebuild a place he still thinks of as home. Sherlock finally brought it up one day, almost brusquely. It was late and they were working jointly at putting the books back in the shelves, side by side but not facing each other.
They’ve got precedent on their side this time, though, John thinks fuzzily as they stumble down the corridor to Sherlock’s bedroom. It worked earlier. Surely it’s going to be okay this time, too. He wants it so much he could cry, yet he wants it for Sherlock even more. He can
, but somehow my courage fails me. I can feel him watching me, waiting for me to say it, but when I don’t, he doesn’t ask me, either. The conversation fades lamely, until Sherlock starts talking about the food again. Safe topic. We stick to that for the rest of the meal, then walk home through the fading early spring light. It’s still warm enough to be comfortable, the trees already in leaf. The urge to take his hand swamps me all of a sudden, and I wonder how he would react if I just did it. Just reached out and firmly held his hand. Would he pull it away, I wonder? Give me a strange look and ask what I’m doing? I don’t know. Maybe one day I’ll have the balls to try it. Not tonight, though.
Sherlock isn’t quite aware of what he says, if he says anything. He fully expects John to release his hand then, but he doesn’t. They stand jointly, and John still doesn’t let go. He will when they leave the office, then, Sherlock thinks, but John continues as though they’re still being observed. Their fingers are laced together, John’s palm warm and dry against his own. When he still doesn’t let go as they walk away, Sherlock’s mouth goes dry. Perhaps this isn’t only for show, then. Perhaps John truly wants to be holding his hand this way. The thought is stunning. They make their way through the back building and toward the north guest wing, encountering no one. They don’t say a word, walking together as though on a secret mission, hand-in-hand, and Sherlock’s pulse is hammering all the louder against his ear drums.
He delivers this without making eye contact, which perversely makes Sherlock want to do something, anything, to get John to look at him. He decides against it. “Thank you,” he says. John’s compliment was blandly given, as though to a perfect stranger, not best friends and housemates who have been through life and death together, more than once. His response is equally bland and he feels rather flat.
“Far too long,” Sherlock says, hardly able to speak above the pounding of his heart. “John – ” He bends forward, wanting it to happen again, and John doesn’t deny him, closing the space between their faces and kissing him for another long, rather wonderful moment. It feels better than anything he’s felt before, better than any drug, better than solving an impossible case. His entire frame is trembling with it, with the magnetic warmth of John’s proximity, craving the gentle suction of his mouth more than anything.
It doesn’t work this time. “No,” Sherlock says. He turns and goes into his bedroom without another word, closing the door from the loo firmly behind him.
I wake in the morning filled with the odd feeling that it’s the first day of holidays or something. I yawn and frown at the same time, trying to put my finger on the feeling, then remember: Sherlock!! I sit bolt upright in bed, then flop back down again, smiling stupidly all over myself, revelling in the memory of last night all over again. What time is it? I glance at the clock on the night stand: it’s just after ten. And we’re going for brunch at eleven! This thought is enough to spur me out of bed. I grab at my dressing gown and tie it hastily around myself, then thunder down the stairs to get into the shower.
“That’s it.” Sherlock summarises their professions again. “We have a fashion editor, a financial advisor, a teacher, a pastry chef, a singer, and a photographer.”
John thinks of how Sherlock suggested it to him only twenty-four hours after they met. Should he be insulted or honoured by this? No – honoured, definitely, he reassesses. He knows what Sherlock means: Corey is a glamorous mega celebrity, used to fine dining and the sort of cuisine that goes with his multi-million dollar film fees. “Right, yeah,” he says, endeavouring to keep his voice even.
All she gives him is worried indignation, though – there’s no sign of recognition or wariness or anything like that. “Oh no! The poor dear! Should I go up and see him, do you think?”
As John recovers from this one, still panting, Sherlock kisses his neck. “All right, maybe a flannel,” he says, the words muffled as his presses his mouth into John’s hot skin.
, she scrawls in her notebook, guessing that the world’s only consulting detective could certainly read writing upside down, and that the former flatmate of John Watson most certainly would. Shorthand for
He tries not to seem impatient through the ritual exchange of his child for his freedom of movement, but it’s difficult to hide. “Look, I’ve really got to get going,” he cuts in, belatedly becoming aware (but not particularly caring) that he’s cut Kate off mid-stream. “You’ll be all right?”
When John releases him, he doesn’t go far, his hand still on Sherlock’s face. “Thank you for that,” he murmurs, doing that thing that makes Sherlock’s heart feel as though it’s skipping a beat, looking at his lips, then glancing up into his eyes. “I really wanted to do that with you. Took me years to even admit to myself that I wanted to. And I loved it, Sherlock. Loved having you inside me. Love how it made me feel, in every single way. It was phenomenal.
Todd shakes his head and gives a bitter laugh. “Have I just lost your faith in me as a therapist?” he asks. “Unable to see something like this in my own house?”
Lestrade gives a loud throat-clearing. “Well!” he says. “Colour me surprised! Although, not really, either. It’s been years coming. Hasn’t it, Donovan?”
Mycroft allows himself a sound of exasperation. “No. They were there for you. They would have shot you had Sherlock not been seen to jump. There was another one at New Scotland Yard, intended for Lestrade, and a third in the sitting room at Baker Street. It’s why Sherlock wanted you there: to protect both you and Mrs Hudson. He was very much aware that he couldn’t protect all three of you, but had a lackey at the Yard manufacture an errand in the basement of the building that shielded the detective inspector. You, unfortunately, returned too quickly, leaving both yourself and Martha Hudson exposed. Since you were there, Sherlock not only had to jump, but he needed his ‘death’ to be convincing to you. Your reactions were being watched, as proof. Your grief is what kept you from being shot. Furthermore, he was obliged to go on keeping his survival a secret from you, as he had no way of knowing how long the assassins would be watching. The only guarantee of your safety was to dismantle all of Moriarty’s ring. And even with my help from here in London, it nonetheless took him far longer than either of us expected.” He pauses, giving Watson a moment to absorb all this, his mouth open, eyes blinking. “He suffered,” he says bluntly. “He was taken captive more than once. Beaten. Tortured, in one instance. And in return, you would have denied him your friendship altogether, more than once since his return. You should have been grateful to find out he was alive – at the very least.”
John takes a breath, about to attempt to say something rather emotional, only then he hears the sound of Mrs Hudson’s heels starting up the stairs. He pulls back, exchanging a quick look of horror with Sherlock before scrambling to get himself out of Sherlock’s lap and everything zipped away again, Sherlock hastily doing the same. They’ve only just made it when she appears in the doorway with one of her hoots of greeting. “Anyone home?” she asks cheerfully, blissfully unaware that she’s only just missed walking in on them in a rather compromising position.
John studies him, trying his best to deduce Sherlock. “But you do want – that? Something along those lines?” he asks, wanting to confirm before assuming, and Sherlock nods. “In that case…” John sets his book aside and gets up, takes the laptop from Sherlock and puts it on the table beside his chair. Next, he straddles Sherlock’s lap, settling his weight carefully onto his thighs and stroking the curls back from his forehead, looking down into Sherlock’s eyes with so much feeling that he’s still half-afraid to show it, his throat tightening. Sherlock reaches for his face with both hands and John kisses him with abandon, falling into it with hungry enthusiasm, as though it’s been days or weeks since they last kissed rather than mere hours. John opens his mouth and Sherlock follows it, their tongues finding each other’s swiftly, and Sherlock’s hands travel down his sides and over his back, then slide down onto his arse a moment or two later. John hears himself make a sound into Sherlock’s mouth and presses closer, his fingers gripping Sherlock’s hair at the back of his head. Sherlock makes a sound of his own, surprised but definitely aroused, and it moves quickly after that, all four of their hands fumbling at zips and trying not to stop touching each other or kissing for even a second as they get their cocks lined up between them, half rubbing and half thrusting together. The kiss devolves into breathy moans, hot on each other’s cheeks as the pleasure rises between their hands and bodies, and if it gets there too fast, John doesn’t even care – he’s just grateful that it’s working. He grits his teeth and makes himself hold off until Sherlock’s hips give a jerk that he can’t prevent, his breath sucking in, and the instant John feels the hot gush between them, he groans and thrusts against Sherlock’s cock only twice more before letting himself go, too.
"John?!" Sherlock demanded, coming into the doorway but his path was blocked by John's form. The shadow before them was clearly a man and he stood up to his full height ready to attack again.
"My brother, you should..." Mycroft moved to hug him, to comfort him. Sherlock however pulled away and stalked partially across the balcony.
"She is and has been. I am happy to hear that you have seen the truth." His voice shook and the cup shook in his hand. Something was wrong, most decidedly and absolutely wrong. A familiar fire built in his veins and he fought to keep his mind focused. It would not do to succumb to this now, here, with him. Mycroft and Sherlock had helped him just last night. He should have been fine for another month.
“Sherlock…” John called out softly, a piece of paper in his gloved hands. They had both just examined the contents of the spilled bag and come to the same conclusion.
-Warehouse, smell of something like sulfur, metallic taste in the air, the smell of scorched material maybe from welding -
"I... I know... You get bad guys." Hamish said softly, looking ashamed for being so sad. John sighed.
"Oh trust me, they have been." Lestrade said in a somewhat tired voice. "The man left behind, the poor John Watson and the recently returned exonerated but distraught Sherlock Holmes. Barely reunited before tragedy strikes again." He fought a snort of laughter, saying it all in a very melodramatic tone. "One day they hate you, the next you're their best story."
“Rest, Mycroft will tend to him.” Greg whispered, hoisting the girl in his arms and carrying her to lie on the sofa. He helped Anthea give her blood, knowing that Mycroft no longer knew any of them were present.
"He is my husband, I will do as I please!" Sherlock snapped at him, trying to shove Mycroft out of the way. Mycroft remained firmly in his path.
"John," He hummed, forcing the kiss to stop. "What do you know about us?" He asked, directing him to sit down. John handed him the leather volume and the rolled parchment. He quickly scanned them. "These handwritten notes are yours?" He asked in awe.
“Do not hide it, for there is nothing that can destroy me more than losing our beloved already has. Tell me Mycroft. Tell me at once.” John held himself firm as Mycroft recounted what he had seen from John’s memories, what he had observed from John’s body when he was given over from Sebastian, and what he feared had happened. John let out a soft sob, his body shuddering but he did not pull away. “So it is true. Sebastian’s determination to learn about the herbs was simply to gain power over us. I handed Sherlock over to them on a platter.” John’s voice was wretched and it made Mycroft ache.
“John, you have been through so much. You suffered such hells while I was none the wiser.  Your body bears so many scars now, your mind broken, your soul aches… How can I ever repay you for being so fiercely loyal to me despite knowing I was blissfully ignorant while in his hands?” Sherlock looked down, a tear slipping down his cheek as he did.
"The Master should keep a better eye on his pet." One of the men growled at him, shoving him into the middle of the alley. The man lunged at him and John cried out as he felt a knife blade sink into the muscles just below his clavicle on his right shoulder. He tried to fight back, several blows landing on his face as he managed to kick one of the two men in the groin. He stumbled back from the men, sinking down as the bump to the head and the blood rushing out of his shoulder wound began to overcome him. Blood ran over his eyes from his forehead but he struggled to regain his footing.
“N-nothing.” John lied, looking away from Mycroft. He didn’t look at the other man either, he’d felt the emotion his Sire had been feeling before John’s pain had interrupted.
In the end the snow subsided only a few days later and it took only one carriage ride for the two to arrive at Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson gleefully welcomed them, pleased as she was that they were moving in even without stopping by to see the flat. She took them upstairs eagerly to show them around, fussing over Sherlock as she did. They settled in quickly and Gregory easily contacted them at their new residence to follow up on the case they had been reviewing. Within a month the two were fully settled in. Snow was still falling outside and the two were settled into their arm chairs near the fire, each with a book in their laps, after solving a spectacular case involving two nobles attempting to kill each other for having an affair with the other’s spouse. John finally decided to ask about the landlady and Sherlock looked up before John had even begun to speak.
Mycroft stalked out, traveling briskly down the port until he saw the other boat. He hid himself behind some crates and listened as several soldiers explained how a man had just shown up with his injured mate and declared he would buy the boat if he must however he needed to return to England right away. Mycroft was considering his options when he felt his brother reach his mind.
"Yes well Mycroft called me and told me what your father did." She sighed and looked down. "How he was going to kill you and your husband. I'm so sorry Johnny. I should never have let him... I shouldn't have just let him treat you however he wanted to. I betrayed you by letting his hatred drive me away." A tear slipped down her cheek.
"He is complete. All that remains is your bond, however you cannot complete that now. We must speak with his family tomorrow." Mycroft stood and kissed John's forehead. He grunted and grabbed for him but he couldn't reach him. "No my little one. You stay and rest. Sherlock will protect you." Mycroft nodded to his brother. Sherlock pulled John to him and sank back against the headboard.
"Or for those too stubborn to stay dead," A voice rang out through the room just as John entered from the hallway. Both men straightened up and tensed, their faces betraying their emotion quite clearly.
“John,” She whispered, reaching out with a shaking arm to grab his hand, stopping him before he pulled away. “Your forgiveness was all I needed. Please, John… Stay away from them. They are… They will…” Her chest shuddered as her breath came and then left her completely, taking her life with it. John did not let go of her hand, looking down as anger and tears welled up in his chest.
“So you need punishment as well.” Sebastian growled. “Come and beg for what you want.” He commanded, laughing as John scrambled to obey.
"There was nothing you could have done John. She would be proud of you now, knowing you put this all to right. She was proud to be your sister, and I think at the end she might have even been proud to be my daughter. But I doubt it."
"Sherlock, if you heard all of it…" He was gearing up for an explanation but Sherlock's mind was already focused.
" John's voice was husky in Sherlock's mind, filling him to the brink. Their arousal swirling and humming in their bond until Sherlock could not focus on anything else.
"The little boy looked lonely John over and asked him what his name was. This made lonely John sad again because he didn't have a fancy name and he certainly wasn't a prince. So he just looked down and replied that his name was John, just John." John inhaled to continue but Sherlock's voice cut him off.
"Yes he is. Who was the other?" Mycroft raised an eyebrow, his dark eyes examining every detail about his brother.
"Why are you doing this?!" John demanded again, involuntarily twitching his leg. One of the hooks, just around his shin found its purchase in his skin. He shouted.
Several days passed before Sebastian was content he had successfully removed whatever taint had been on the mender on his return. He returned to his usual methods, tormenting and taunting John while abusing him in front of the whole coven. John, for all anyone else could see, still looked broken and battered. He cried out in pain and allowed himself to express every ounce of sorrow he possessed, but Sherlock could see the glint in his eyes, the fire of purpose. And it made him burn. He had grown more restless since his last meeting with John, desperate to taste more of him, to have him all to himself. He found himself lurking near the room where the mender was kept, eager to claim him. John was a fire in Sherlock’s veins and he could not understand it. The herbs he had been given for so many years had easily stripped his mind of the memories, though he knew they were locked inside one of the many rooms in his mind. He didn’t know if he would be able to last a fortnight without taking John for himself.
"It's brilliant." He replied, smiling and blushing slightly. "You're not bad considering you didn't have as much training as I have."
"I'm here love, easy..." Sherlock whispered reassuringly. John grabbed his hand as tightly as he could, grunting softly with pain.
“He is my fledgling and I shall claim him.” Mycroft replied, standing up to his full height. “You have no right to make demands of me. I am the Coven Father and as such I have rights to all vampire fledglings of this coven. You cannot keep him from me!” He rushed forward only to meet Sherlock’s fist with his cheek. Sherlock expertly maneuvered and Mycroft found himself against the same wall across the room, grunting in pain.
"Mr. Holmes is away on business this evening. He said you had everything you needed in the guest house and to make yourselves comfortable." One of the men handed Sherlock a key. "He will check in on you tomorrow when he returns." A text noise, the man checked his phone. "And it seems Detective Inspector Lestrade dropped off a few files for you as well." John's phone chimed and he slowly extracted it from his pocket.
"We're going to need Molly's report on the body, too." John sighed. "I don't know if I'll be able to get into the secure server out here."
"You'we my pwisoner!" Hamish exclaimed suddenly, sneaking up right behind her and brandishing the sword. He was far too excited to say his words properly and Sherlock sighed softly. But she jumped and let out a little squeal before dissolving into giggles.
"It doesn't matter if we could, Sherlock." She finally looked up at him. "My usefulness is over. You have something infinitely better than me. Don't let him go." She whispered as a forceful command, her eyes scanning his as they finally let their gazes meet. "
“Oh yes.” He replied setting the case down in front of John and staring him directly in the eyes. “Come on now, our friends want to hear us play.”
His hips took on a life of their own slamming into John even harder as his essence spilled into his hungry mouth. His blood carried his lust forcing Sherlock's to achieve atmospheric levels as he teetered close to his own release. He pulled up off John's neck as they both we finally thrust over the edge, their vision going white, both of them shouting, and completely in sync with each other. A few drops of John's blood dripped down over his chest as the two lay there panting and staring in each other's eyes. Silence descended around them but Sherlock spoke, the words echoing in John's mind.
"What do you mean?" There was a shyness and doubt in Sherlock's voice that almost took John's breath away.
"You know so little of me yet you seem to care so much. I have never seen this side of you, Lord Holmes." His voice was soft but he tried to remain firm. Mycroft was pleased by his effort and softened more, cradling him close to his own body. Trying to help subdue the shivering that possessed him now.
His breath quickened as he sat up in one move, but Sherlock saw the panic. He saw the darkness that raced through John's body and tried to consume him as his eyes locked with Sherlock's. The two of them silent as the room seemed to suddenly become devoid of oxygen. Both of them terrified to move or speak. John didn't think it was real, he seemed to believe he'd finally lost it completely. He looked to Mycroft who simply turned and exited the room. Car door slam, engine starting, and echoing silence. John was shaking hard. He was clenching the cushion so tightly under his hands he was scared it might tear. Sherlock clenched his hands, trying to regain his normal calm demeanor but the amount of emotion this man felt for him was too much. TOO much!
"You could have been labeled a hunter, that would have endangered your life." He kept staring at a word on the first page of the book. Solvanar - he had seen it before but he could not recall where.
"You've already given it. Consider it repayment for borrowed time." She didn't meet his eyes as she spoke, a cool edge to her voice.
I have no idea who John will end up with after everything is said and done. There will be a few more chapters set in this initial time frame before we skip ahead. Kudos/Comments always appreciated!
John just nodded but his entire body tensed and his mind went blank as Sherlock's hands began exploring his hips and over his thighs. He cried out as the touch shifted and he realized that Sherlock had wrapped his hands around his erection. He explored every inch of him before sliding up and down over it, watching how each pass made John shiver and moan. He changed his speed, alternating his touch and the amount of contact. Tormenting John and learning every detail he could about how to bring pleasure to him.
"It..." Sherlock's mouth opened despite his efforts to shove the desperate need away, the throbbing of John's pulse completely undoing his mind. "It is the sign of a bond mate. It means you are destined to be mine..." John felt the heat that pooled in his stomach as Sherlock came slightly undone.
“No witnesses, no one saw him get off the train, no one saw him come down here. His train ticket says he came in this morning. Three hour trip with a return booked tomorrow morning. He’s a younger guy, we’ve got an ID – Jared Pendergrass.” Greg rattled off. John snapped around and narrowed his eyes. Sherlock felt John's energy tighten and he looked at his husband with confusion.
"When he started shouting at you in it, because the look on your face would have been priceless." John shrugged and Greg laughed loudly.
"My apologies, little mender. I thought you heard me approach." He smiled warmly, however something darker stirred in his eyes. For the first time since meeting the man so many years ago John felt fear claw at his chest.
After they broke apart John let himself be guided as Sherlock lay back on the couch and brought John with him. He arranged himself so they were both half sitting up, half lying down with John against his chest. John felt comfortable in the arrangement, though the couch was a bit small for the two of them to cuddle together like this. Sherlock didn't speak as he watched John turn towards him, pressing his ear to his chest. He just tried to continue thinking and processing all of the emotion they had just shared. John instead focused on the sound of his heartbeat and breathing, trying to establish some sort of solid ground to stand on. John grew incredibly comfortable in the embrace and before long Sherlock felt him sink to sleep. It was only after John closed his eyes however, that Sherlock let himself reveal how deeply affected he had been by their discussion. He didn't move an inch, trying as best he could to allow John the space to rest. Instead he focused on trying to piece together what little information he had on the most recent developments to try and prevent the spider's web from trapping anyone else. There were several times John would slip into a nightmare, usually muttering Sherlock's name. So Sherlock would press a kiss against his cheek, the top of his head, or wherever he could reach to bring peace back to the man he loved so well. Each time John would curl up more against him, seeking even more comfort.
"What did it say?" John picked up his tea a bit shakily with his left hand, pleased to note he caught Sherlock off guard. If Sherlock wasn't going to stop 'working' then John would keep pace with him. After all for three days Sherlock had been pleasantly quiet about the whole 'case' in hospital.
"I need to ask your opinion on something." He crossed his arms, bringing his attention to bear on Lestrade.
“My love,” Sherlock whispered as John started to turn to look for Mycroft, surprised he had not joined their embrace. “You look ill, you have not fed in some time. Will you please go feed now?” He kept his voice soft, pressing a gentle kiss to each of John’s eyelids.
John with her initials. It irritated him immensely and made something very vile rise in his stomach. His thoughts quickly became dark as he plotted all of the things he could do to make her pay. Mycroft swept out of the room when a doctor motioned to him and about an hour later John slowly opened his eyes, groaning in pain.
"It is too late, John. I know not how he managed this evil. Though I do know his hand was behind it. The child is lost and I fear the damage of losing her cost me too much.” She lay back, gripping John’s hand as he wiped her forehead again and tried to warm her up.
to be the one who saw what would have been your last moments in the world." Tears fell down on their hands from his eyes. "That's how I knew that you were just… Just going to go with what that bastard wanted everyone to believe." He shuddered.
"I appreciate that, I'll see to it they don't plan anything too underhanded." He sighed and a few minutes later silence settled around them.  Greg sighed and ran a hand over his face.
"Look at you." John growled. "My love... My mate..." He whispered trailing kisses and soft bites over Sherlock's neck. His fangs dragging over the vein. Sherlock moaned loudly and his eyes fluttered closed. "Yes Sherlock, give in to the pleasure. Let me see you unmade." John ordered, his voice thick with his lust. Their bond swirling with their arousal so much so that Sherlock wasn't sure he was encased by his physical body any longer.
"What are you talking about Sherlock? Is this some sort of joke, where is your mender?" Mycroft's voice was a dark growl. He looked deeply angered by Sherlock's insinuations.
"They showed you how to do it four times and I can walk you through it. You have been violently insecure over this." John looked into Sherlock's eyes. A host of feelings past between them as their gazes locked.
"John!" Sherlock shouted, clawing John until their mouths met. John hips moving hard against his own. "God, yes." He panted, arching up into him.
"Yes, Lord Mycroft." Anthea said softly, her brow still furrowed with worry. She hurried from the room.
Kitty was just rambling now. She continued tracing the letters for about five minutes before getting up. She kept pacing away and then pacing back, whenever she got close to him she would slash him again with the scalpel; sometimes lightly, other times deeply but each time with malice and hatred. Time seemed to pass slowly, Kitty wandering back over to retrace the initials or cut him someplace new before wandering back out to pace and spew her insanity. There was no clock, but John could tell the moment the two hour mark hit as could feel the next stage of the poisoning rocketing through his body. His muscles felt like they were on fire. He didn't let it show on his face, channeling his military training to keep himself strong. Sherlock would show he just had to wait.
"Oh, my apologies!" John snapped but Sherlock registered the hint of fear on his face. "It was Lord Moriarty wasn't it? They did not inform me you arrived." John stepped forward and grasped the man's hand in supplication. "I apologize Lord Holmes, we will have to part our pleasant conversation. I must attend to my duty."
"Impossible," John smirked tiredly. "In order for me to do that you would have to have room for your ego to get bigger."
"You're sick you God damned bastard!" John shouted back at him. "Hurting a child, and all for what? Your stupid hatred?!" Hamish whimpered at John's anger.
There was a sharp tap on his window at around 8, John froze on his bed having been waiting. He got over his moment of "Maybe I shouldn't go," and looked out the window to signal that he was on his way down.
"No, an elephant is an elephant from the moment it's conceived and a fish is a fish the moment the egg is laid. You could just say the elephant is swimming and the fish is just jumping, but fish swim and elephants jump. Everyday people have the potential to commit crimes, and criminals had to be everyday people before they committed the crime. Criminals can be everyday people because they are everyday people, but once they've committed a crime they are a criminal that can act as an everyday individual."
His appetite would disappear until all of his school work was done; if he got homework from his morning classes he wouldn't eat lunch until all of it was done. When his friends should have been concerned, they became annoyed. John was no longer fun to be around, all he did was focus on school, when the second semester of school started and the transfer students came in his spot at the table was soon filled.
His dad scoffed, "I honestly can't believe her sometimes. How did she think she'd get away with this?" John shrugged. "Well, anyways, how was studying with your friend?"
The second time John saw his father hit his sister was a year later, they had both just entered the house from school, he was waiting there for her. He forced a bar of soap into her mouth and made her bite off a chunk of it before he pounded on her. John could only stand there and watch horrified and stay out of the way. He hated himself for not defending Harry, but he was so shocked and blindsided he hadn't even thought about it, which made him feel even worse when he thought about it later that night.
Something snapped in John, suddenly he wasn't anxious, he was angry. This fucking hypocrite. "You know, she does seem a little different. She kinda reminds me of you dad." He laughed though none of this was funny. "Hell, why don't I take up drinking too?! We can be the drunk Watsons, and all of the neighbors can point and laugh as we stumble down the street!"
"Look who decided tuh come home tonight, Johnny. Even thow she's grounded n isn supposed tuh be out."
Sherlock blinked, "Normally kids put off their homework until the night before, I just assumed it was due tomorrow," he chuckled.
When John first saw his father hit his sister it was at the dinner table; he had found the report card she had been hiding from him that said she was failing two of her classes. John was 14 at the time, Harry 16.
"No it's no! It's not okay!" He walked over to the sink and tossed his phone on the edge while he rinsed his face with cold water. He leaned over the sink, his eyes closed while his brain tried to process what was happening. "No, you're right, I'm sorry. It's okay." He picked up his phone and pressed call.
Sherlock smiled, "Excellent! This is me," he gestured to a gated off house. It was bigger and fancier than John's, but still cute and modest; he loved it.
"You don't, so what ever your father beats her for is something he doesn't beat you for. What does your sister do that you don't? You don't drink, you don't sleep around—you've never even had a girlfriend, you never cause any trouble or drama, you get good grades. I've had classes with Harriet in the past, so I know the the drinking and partying and boys have all come recently. Her grades have been shit since your mum died."
Before his dad hung up he added something, "Tell Harriet I need to speak with her when she get's home, I got her report card today too."
"No, it's fine," he lied. "I just don't want to make Sherlock wait. Goodbye," he waved slightly as he backed towards the door.
"And what is your master plan, then? Are you going to go back there, in the hopes that your father and sister are just shouting at each other? What are you going to do if, god forbid, something worse is happening? You're still just a boy, John.
"How about we study and then drop you home, and then later tonight I'll wait outside your house and if you decide to come with I'll be there and if not, no hard feelings," Sherlock suggested.
"You have severe anxiety when it comes to your grades, could be because you're a serious student who really wants to get into med school, but you don't eat until your work is done, which isn't consistent with any data I've collected."
Sometimes the best way to fight, is to surrender. In certain situations, if one chooses to fight right away,  they'll find that they've unintentionally hung themselves. If they surrender, however, there will always be a chance to fight again, so they might as well try to bargain with the enemy first.
Sherlock scoffed at his pathetic attempt. "My mom's a mathematician,"  he explained as he set his bag at a table and went to grab a couple of books off the shelves.
There was still a five minute walk ahead of them and neither of them knew what to fill the silence with, finally, however, John thought of something, "So, what's this favor you want me to do?"
They met at the front of the building after school like they said they would, but Sherlock said they were waiting for one more person. A couple minutes after a small girl walked over to where they were standing, "Hello," she greeted.
The guest bedroom looked as impressive as the rest of the house, causing John to shudder at the idea of Sherlock ever seeing the inside of his own house. He could almost swear he'd seen it in an interior decorating magazine that he'd looked through in the waiting room of a doctor's office. The bed was a queen with the fluffiest pillows John had ever seen; even the sheets looked better than anything he'd ever seen first hand—he didn't know what a thread count was, but he was sure these had a high one. There were two windows, both looking out into the driveway so the room was partially lit by street lights. There was also two mirrors, one above the dresser and one full length mirror next to the door, which surprised John more than it should have.
"Well you never bring anyone over," she turns to John in the car, "I'm always telling him to bring sweet little Molly over, but he never listens to me. Have you met her?"
"You're smarter than this, Harriet! What have you been doing this whole time?! I grounded you a month ago for the same thing and your percentages have gotten worse!" Harry refused to look up from her plate, John was playing with the food on his, suddenly not hungry even though he'd been starving before. "Answer me Harry, explain yourself!" When she still didn't look up their father stood abruptly, pausing for only a second before striking her. It shocked both Harry and John, Harry teared up, but stayed silent; John, who felt like he was going to throw up, excused himself to his room.
John's eyes widened to saucers, "You're not coming home at all? Harry, he's going to kill you!" he whispered angrily.
John prepared himself for another storm as he exited the vehicle. The lights inside were still on, which meant either his dad had passed out on the couch, or he was still up. He opened the door as quietly as he could, but to his dismay his dad was still awake. And Harry was home.
"When's the last time you heard of a crime happening in this part of town? Don't worry," Sherlock said exasperatedly, "We're taking a cab."
"I am not controlling nor manipulative, you're upset I've told you exactly what you don't want to hear, even though it's the most logical."
John chuckled halfheartedly, "Not really." The warning bell sounded, "I'll meet you at the front of the building after school, okay?"
John found a nearly empty table to sit at instead, "Can I sit here?" he asked the kid with curly black hair who occupied it.
"Oh, hush up. Where did you say you live, John?" The ride took barely ten minutes and when they pulled into the drive John nodded to Sherlock which bedroom was his while Wanda chattered her goodbyes. "Come back soon, okay John? You're welcome over anytime; don't be afraid to just drop by! If Sherlock's out you can just stay and chat with me till he get's back, not that he ever goes anywhere. I swear he wouldn't get out of bed it I didn't force him to—"
That gave John a warm feeling in his gut and a smile on his face. The cab pulled into the driveway and Sherlock tossed a few large notes towards the front seat before dragging John excitedly inside.
John scoffed, "Most logical what? It's certainly not a plan, I don't leave my fate up to hoping everything will turn out okay, Sherlock," he said bitterly.
"Thank you, but I need to go back for my bag anyway. I can wake up early and walk there, you won't even know I've left, so don't worry about needing to wake up early or anything," he rambled anxiously.
"See you tomorrow, it was lovely to meet you too." John got out of the car and waited until they pulled out of the drive to go through the door and face the storm he was dreading.
John stopped Harry in the hall later in the day, "Can you tell dad I'm studying with a friend tonight so I won't be home till later?"
Sherlock grabbed it from his hands, "We can do it at your house if that'd be easier for you," he tried again as he dialed the number for him and handing it back so he could press call when he was ready.
"THEN DO YOUR FUCKING HOMEWORK FOR ONCE, HARRIET!" He regretted raising his voice, people were staring now.
John sat across from him, taking out his chemistry textbook, knowing he wouldn't be eating today because they'd been assigned three pages worth of problems. He could feel Sherlock's eyes on him as he worked, but did his best to ignore it.
"No! I need help with chemistry," he said as he tried to dial his phone, his hands were shaking too much and he couldn't stop pressing wrong numbers.
"I can and I have! I'm staying up all night to make sure you stay put, whether you sleep soundly or not."
"I'll show you to the guest room. I might be able to find some pajamas in your size as well, but you'll have to stop by your house in the morning if you don't want to wear those clothes to school. Or you can borrow something of mine, up to you," Sherlock shrugged and led John upstairs.
"I'll feel guilty if I don't pay you something; I think your place would be best." There's never any telling what awaits Harry and him after school.
"You're not," Sherlock stated before he launched into an in depth explanation. They only got through one page worth of problems before lunch was over and neither of them had eaten a thing.
"No you're not. You're curious, just like you were curious about the burglar, and all those people you deduced when we were waiting for him. I don't see why though, so what if he likes an occasional glass of bourbon, lots of people do," John defended.
He was shaking and he couldn't pinpoint why, his breathing was becoming labored as well, he quickly ducked into a bathroom and pulled out his phone. The door announced someone else had entered after him, he glanced over his shoulder to see Sherlock had followed him in, "Are you okay?" he asked.
"Not yet, I've observed a few others like the one were going to see tonight; I'm hoping there's some sort of pattern. Criminals are everyday people when they're not being criminals. What's the difference between a fish and an elephant?"
Sherlock quickly spoke up, "Don't listen to him, he's an alcoholic too, recently divorced, frequently chooses booze over rent, and about to be evicted. You did the right thing, it'll turn out fine," he said nonchalantly, as if John's life wasn't in danger, because it wasn't in Sherlock's opinion. "Worse comes to worse, you can always live with me."
John understood then why the other students pick on Sherlock. "Well, at least that saved me a lot of time explaining my home life, or making up lies."
John made a half-arsed attempt at straightening his posture so he didn't look so pathetic; Sherlock pretended not to notice as he set the clothes down next to him.
"You've obviously been raised to be the parental figure for Harriet, but you are not her father and no one is going to blame you for being self preserving."
John looked outside to see they were outside his house, "Holy shit, I didn't even know we were here."
While Sherlock went to go talk to Mycroft about covering for him as they snuck out, John thought up every possible outcome and any possible solutions. The problem with that was he couldn't come up with anything that ended well. The more he thought about it, the more staying put sounded like the best and most logical decision.
He needn't worry, however, the cab was still waiting outside with Sherlock next to it. "Need a place to stay?"
"Well, the idea of that makes me shudder." Sherlock laughed assuming he meant the idea of the assignment being due tomorrow.
"Sherlock, dear!" a voice came from another room, the person it belonged to coming to greet him. "How was school? Who's this? I'm Mrs. Hudson, the housekeeper."
John reluctantly took a step forward, his dad practically lunged at him and fell in his arms. "Dad, Sherlock's waiting for me; I'm gonna smell like booze," he complained.
"All the more reason you should be going home," John reasoned. If he's been home all day that'll mean he's been drinking to relax.
"Oh, how lovely!" a voice came from the other room. "I'll put on some tea, John make yourself at home!" Sherlock eyed John in a told-you-so way, to which John rolled his eyes.
John went silent for a moment, "You can smell it on me? That's impossible, he hugged me before I left, but that smell wouldn't have stuck on that long."
"Yeah, I am, I was just calling to let you know I won't be home till later tonight. I'm going to a friend's house so he can help me study," his voice wavered, but you couldn't tell over the phone.
"You're nearly a stone under weight (10 pounds). I've seen you at lunch before, you don't eat when you have homework; at first, I confess, I assumed you were just doing homework that was due the same day, though you proved me wrong today when you were working on something that's not due till next week. Am I wrong?"
"You should take a shower before school tomorrow," Sherlock stated on the cab ride home. Their adventure turned out to be a waste of time, the burglar didn't even show up. They waited for two hours before Sherlock called his informant, who then informed him that the burglar was picked up by the cops for drug possession that afternoon.
"If I tell you, you won't do it. I don't offer my tutoring services for free," he added with a smile.
"Oh! Thank you, John, that's so sweet of you! But, please call me Wanda or mum," she gushed. "It's so nice to have Sherlock bring a friend over for once!"
"I didn't—good guess though, if I say so myself." John laughed a real laugh this time and Sherlock grinned at him before giving the cab driver his address.
"You will," Sherlock insisted as he led him into the kitchen, only to find Mycroft sitting at the kitchen table. "Mycroft," Sherlock sneered, "Where's mum?"
It soon became apparent to John that Molly had a bit of a crush on Sherlock, every time he glanced at her as he told the story of how one of his teachers was wrong that day, she blushed and looked away.
John wasn't sure what he'd just done, or what the ramifications would be. One thing was for sure, he did not want to know what was happening at home right now. His head spun just thinking up possibilities; he walked over to the giant bed to sit down, not trusting his wobbly, anxiety-ridden legs to hold him.
"Oh. Oh!" John exclaimed once he got the full weight of what Sherlock said. "Do you like any boys then?"
"Idiot," Sherlock said. "You've been staring out the window the past two minutes, where did you think you were?"
"Just shut it, John! You're not going back and that's final. Your neighbors are only 3 meters away from your house, if anything serious happens they will hear it and call the police. John, I am asking you to stay here for the night, and accept the safety I am offering you. I'll walk with you to your house tomorrow and wait outside while you grab your things, what happens past that depends on what is happening tonight, and for this night I am asking you to think about yourself, because—forgive me—I don't logically see how you going home right now will be of any benefit to you."
"John Watson," he held out his hand to shake, but Mycroft simply looked at his hand and back up to his eyes; he let it drop. "Are you Sherlock's brother then?"
John was surprised that he wasn't more drunk, he must have only started an hour or two ago. "Harry's not home?" He feigned surprise. "Actually, I think I heard her friends talking about a party or something?" He fiddled with his backpack strap as he started to go to his room.
The cabby burst out laughing, "Son, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you're in the dog house with them, that's for sure!"
"I'm helping him study, can you please tell everybody to stay out of the library." He led John up the stairs and into a large room covered wall to wall with books.
"I invented it, I'll be the only one in the world. When the police are trying to solve a murder and ultimately failing to do so, they'll call me," Sherlock explained with a mix of pride and smugness. "I'll tell you one thing, if your scalpel work is anything like your handwriting I won't be going to you to patch me up," he teased.
"You seem off," Sherlock narrowed his eyes trying to use some of the tips Mycroft had given him when deducing someone.
There was a moment of silence as Sherlock thought of what to say that might offer some sort of comfort to John. He didn't normally care about other people's comfort, nor did he offer to tutor them or invite them on outings. He could sense something different about John though, he could tell he wasn't as stupid as other people and he wasn't mean to Sherlock like the other students.
Sherlock gives in. “It was traumatic then,” he says. “It was – a child’s loss, a child’s horror. Blocked and buried and – changed. It’s not traumatic anymore, though I suppose that learning the truth was disturbing enough.”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches, not quite a smile, but it’s progress. “True,” he allows. “‘We’ could try that, I suppose.”
John shakes his head. “Not so far.” He knocks again. “Mrs Hudson?” He looks at Sherlock. “Maybe you should try,” he says dubiously. “She likes you better.”
It’s absolutely ridiculous inside. John walks inside and his jaw drops again. “Good God,” he says in frank disbelief, and Sherlock puts his arms around his shoulders from behind, pressing his nose and lips into John’s cheek.
Molly feels brushed off by Mary’s cold logic. She types again, feeling petulant and more than a little angry now.
John accepts this. He busies himself by running the hot tap and crouching to get his kit out from under the sink for some alcohol, a roll of gauze, and some sturdy medical tape. Next, he wets a flannel, then gives his entire attention to the length of Sherlock’s back. The blood from the cord slashes has dripped, drying in thick, dark tracks, but the cuts themselves are still oozing bright red blood. The damage is worst where the plug end hit. The cuts are the deepest there, the skin jagged and torn. “Just keep nice and still,” John advises, and pats as gently as he can. He’s bracing himself not for the fact that the alcohol will sting Sherlock, but for another round of panic, he realises, and forces himself to relax. The panic doesn’t resurface, however; Sherlock inhales a bit sharply, but apart from that he just holds himself still. Too still, in fact. There’s tension in every line of his body, but John supposes that he must be in pain. He dabs carefully at the oozing cuts, trying to clean away enough of the blood to see just how deep they go. It’s not as bad as it could be, he sees, though the deeper wounds where the plug tore into Sherlock’s back are considerably uglier. John rinses the flannel and starts again. A healthy bit of bleeding of the wounds is good for preventing infection, and the mild heat of the flannel could help with the pain, too. But then he sees something else and his hand stills mid-air. “Sherlock…”
Mycroft opens his mouth to speak, but gets distracted by John plunking a mug down in front of him. “Thank you,” he says again. He waits, but when no one makes a move to fill his mug, he makes a slightly martyred face and pours it himself. “It is and it isn’t. I merely wanted to catch you both at the same time. It’s a bit of a favour.”
. They’re planning their wedding – a wedding they both wanted so much that they each proposed and accidentally bought each other the same ring. What could have changed to make John doubt this, make him stop wanting it? Has he become paranoid? Is this some sort of self-sabotage that he’s subconsciously attempting to wreak upon their relationship? If nothing is going on, then why is he so intent on feeling a slight drift between them? He attempts to keep the frown off his face as Mrs Hudson chatters to John about the wedding, the two of them seemingly having accepted that he has withdrawn from the conversation. He makes himself tune back in, not wanting to miss out on whatever John is talking about.
Knowing that Sherlock knows the precise location of Corey Graham’s condo makes John’s stomach knot. “Oh?” he says, as casually as he can. Sherlock comes back out of the kitchen. “So – did you see it after?” John asks jerkily, the question coming out rather more directly than he intended.
“In addition,” Sherlock adds, before Corey can respond, “I would imagine that you would prefer us to confiscate all laptops, hard drives, and other storage ware that he could have stored copies on, in addition to any online or cloud storing locations, should we find manage to prove that he did make unlicensed copies with or without intent to sell. Should be easy to get a warrant once that’s confirmed.”
Molly feels as though she’s been slapped, but it makes sense. She agreed to this plan, and Mary says it’s working so far. Molly still hasn’t seen Sherlock at all or heard a word from him, but Mary assures her that this will change. She nods, tears still slipping down her cheeks, and Mary’s face softens and she kisses Molly again, nicely this time. “I’m sorry,” Molly says after, her eyes opening slowly.
John’s hands come up to hold his upper arms, then slip around his back again as the kiss unfolds between them. Kissing John makes Sherlock feel closer to him than he knew was possible, and he wants still more of it. He combs his fingers through John’s hair, kissing him more deeply still, and John responds in kind, which is thrilling in and of itself. When they finally draw apart, John’s eyes have gone starry and soft, deep blue-grey and filled with tenderness. “Well,” he says, take a long, deep breath. “That’s the best good night kiss I’ve ever had in my life, hands down.”
Doug’s eyes brighten and they head off to the dance floor. “Good Lord, I’m going to cry at that,” John mutters.
“I understand that,” Ella says firmly. “I really do. But you’ve got to get yourself under control. Come on. Let me drive you to the clinic.”
Greg clearly doesn’t notice. “Well, now I have a boring finance job, if you want to know. Day trading. It’s what I went to uni for, only then I joined the army.” He shrugs. “You know how it goes.”
John’s arms tighten. “I think we do, believe it or not,” he says, but he can hear the wonder in his own voice, too. He reaches for Sherlock’s face and their eyes hold for a moment first, seeing all of it reflected back in each other’s faces, and then John kisses him again.
John’s face clouds over again. “Angry.” He thinks for a second, then adds, “Undervalued. Not valued at all. Underestimated in every way. Like she thought I was an idiot. At one point during the confrontation in the empty house, when she realised I wasn’t Sherlock, she actually thought I was a dummy. That pretty much sums up her opinion of me.”
been years,” he points out, though John notices that he’s distinctly short of breath as he says it, and that only makes him want to kiss Sherlock again.
Somehow things fall into a pattern. They work on the house. Mycroft comes by to interrupt and drill them on the depositions. John rotates Rosie around during the days, though it’s mostly Harry and Liz who have her. He messes up one night when he and Sherlock drink a little too much at dinner and he falls asleep on the sofa at Baker Street. He wakes in the morning to find a blanket draped over him and Sherlock cooking breakfast in the kitchen, his curls still wet from the shower. John watches him for a moment, privately admiring his long, smoothly-muscled back in its tightly-tailored dress shirt, which is tucked into a pair of trousers equally tightly-tailored in a way that should be illegal. John has to swallow at the sight, his morning wood giving a gentle pang of yearning that has everything to do with all of the rest of the stuff that’s been stuck in John’s chest for six years now. His phone buzzes on the coffee table and he sees that Sherlock plugged it in for him. Thoughtful of him. The screen is showing several texts from Harry. He remembers Rosie and his heart sinks. He was supposed to pick her up last night.
John feels stunned, as though someone has just punched him in the gut and knocked the wind out of his lungs. But before he can even say anything, Irene speaks again.
Sherlock tells her about the hotel they found just outside the city, the honeymoon suite with the jacuzzi. “We’ll stay the night, eat brunch, which is supposed to be quite something there, and fly to Bora Bora in the evening. Mycroft is sending cars to take us there and pick us up for the airport.”
“Yes. She’s coming, she just wanted to change and wash her hands and such. She’ll be right up.” Sherlock looks around. “Oh, you’ve already put the kettle on. Good. Thanks.”
The time has come – is past due – to do something about this. He will give Watson one chance, Mycroft resolves, feeling his expression turn ugly as the cameras show John leaving, blood dripping from Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock hesitates, then relaxes again. “Okay,” he says, unsure whether he’s to go on feigning sleep, or – or he doesn’t even know what the other alternative would be.
Phil frowns. “Right, yeah. It would seem that way. So does that mean that the investigation is going to be closed again?” He looks over at John.
Sherlock smiles reluctantly, but is spared having to respond when he hears their names. John tugs him over by the sleeve. “Come on,” he says.
Sherlock looks at John, who looks back at him. “Mmm,” Sherlock says in vague affirmation, just barely managing to keep his expression neutral. Beside him, John takes a long drink of tea.
John wants to vault over the chairs, but he’s very much aware that they’re in a church. “Let’s – go outside,” he says, his throat tight, and Sherlock agrees. They meet in the aisle, Sherlock finding his hand, and they hasten out the door and into the night. John is about to stop and turn to him, but there are students and tourists still milling about nearby, and Sherlock has other ideas.
Sherlock pulls over and parks the SUV, though the road is quite narrow. “Let’s have a look,” he says briskly.
“Says the man who recently blew up a brick in this very room,” John says dryly, but his mouth is twitching as he slices the bacon.
John’s throat tightens. He looks down at the box again. “That’s – I mean, I just feel like we can’t possibly accept this, Corey.”
“Okay,” John says, trying to ignore the fact that he’s not exactly soft, either. “So then the question is – ”
Since that night, everything has been better. They take cases, usually chosen together, and they generally solve them. John moved back into Baker Street to help repair it and then just never seemed to leave again. They eat together, sometimes cooking, sometimes going out, and after the first week or two, they started playing games again the way they used to, long ago. As for cinema, John has now dedicated the entire Marvel Universe to Sherlock’s study, so it appears they won’t run out of films any time soon.
“Clearly not, given my utter lack of experience apart from the past two nights – and this morning,” Sherlock says. He opens his eyes. “So, about those emails – did you read all of them?”
Sherlock shrugs, more with his face than with his shoulders, which seem to be frozen. “All right.” He removes his own shoes but leaves his coat on. The cottage is exceedingly charming, to an extent he finds nearly painful just about now. The front door gives way immediately into the sitting room, its flagged stone floor covered here and there in carpets and mats. The walls are plastered in white with dark wooden beams exposed. The furniture looks worn and comfortable, grouped about a large, stone fireplace. To Sherlock’s right, nestled in the leaded-glass window is a small, live spruce, decorated and lit, giving the room a soft glow. On the far side of the room is an open kitchen with an island, not separated from the sitting room except in how the furniture is arranged. To the left of this, a hot tub sits on a raised platform in the corner, the same, flagged stone leading up to its in low, wide steps. There are bookshelves lined with novels, a basket with bottles of wine and boxes of biscuits and chocolate arranged on the coffee table in front of the sagging, ruby-red sofa. A hammock chair is suspended from a sturdy hook to the right of the kitchen, as though the person doing the cooking might need to be kept company. A hollow wooden staircase leads up to a second level. He follows John silently around the ground floor, John making brief comments about this and that, checking a door beside the hot tub nook that evidently gives out onto a small terrace.
They wake a couple of hours later when Rosie starts to cry again. John yawns and stretches. “I’ll go,” he says, before Sherlock can.
John rolls his eyes. “Probably just someone’s wife cheating or something. Why should you have to chase them down?”
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate. He withdraws the Browning from his coat pocket and aims it with both hands at Mycroft’s face. This, at least, registers. Sherlock doesn’t care. “Yes. You are.
Irene’s mouth takes on a stubborn set of its own, her jaw going square and obstinate. “I thought you had hinted at more,” she says, a bit petulantly. “Clearly I read you wrong. In that case, I completely understand why you said no just now. I don’t understand why
It’s a hot day in July and Sherlock is only wearing a dress shirt, the sleeves rolled up to the elbow, and the cord cuts directly through the material. That would be painful enough, but Sherlock goes completely rigid and makes a sound that goes straight to John’s heart, somehow. He’s never heard Sherlock make a sound like that before, the cry torn from his throat. Sherlock staggers to his knees and by then, in the three seconds that it’s all happened, John’s caught up and leapt at their suspect, tackling him to the dirty pavement with a shout.
Sherlock nods, scanning his phone again. “Not sure what the fuss is about. I’m sure he’s got nothing to be ashamed of.”
Sherlock smiles and lays a hand on his face, his thumb touching the corner of John’s mouth. “Hi,” he says back. “Welcome back to the land of the living. Or the conscious, I suppose.”
“I’m just finding out…” John scans a little further. “There’s a big introduction to the presentations and workshops this evening, then what’s described as a sneak peek at the exhibits. Tomorrow all of the talks and such begin, but we have a choice. In the evening there’s some sort of live entertainment.”
Sherlock watches him and thinks that this is good, despite the acute embarrassment just minutes ago. It’s dulling the edges of the anger that surfaced this morning at the circle meeting. He looks at John’s chest and wants to swim over and put his lips to it, again. Another dangerous urge.
Sherlock surveys the field a tad skeptically. “Someone local is definitely involved,” he responds. “And it’s quite possible that the farm buildings offered some shelter, a place to rest, whether or not the farmer was involved. I suppose there’s only one way to find out.”
It still feels like a nightmare as John goes back to the Yard with Sherlock and the rest, Rosie’s nappy rapidly stinking up the cruiser. John apologises but no one seems to mind. Donovan has tears in her eyes and Sherlock is openly holding John’s knee. They get inside and John finds the nappy bag and changes Rosie in one of the loos, cleaning her up with baby wipes and warm water and trying to still her crying through his own tears. When she’s changed and clean and dressed in the spare onesie he’d stashed in the nappy bag, he holds her tightly and bounces her until she’s stopped crying.
Sherlock savours the words, his eyes still closed, his arms locked around John’s shoulders. “Okay,” he says at last, and John pulls back just enough to kiss him. It last for a long time, unhurried and beautiful, and by the time it’s over, much of the tension has left Sherlock’s shoulders.
“You’ll wreck your eyes, reading your screen in the dark,” John responds. He yawns. “Mrs Hudson’s door was locked, so I didn’t knock. Look, do you need anything? Want me to help you with that? Tea? Something to eat?”
,” he tries, his heart pounding. “I don’t care at all. It’s – it’s over. It was what it was, but it’s long over now.”
Sherlock agrees with reluctance and they separate and go back to their own tasks, John preparing the fruit and cheese plate at the table while Sherlock chops carrots, cauliflower, small, white mushrooms, and long ribbons of coloured peppers to go with the celery. He fits a container of store-bought dip in the centre and wraps the entire tray in plastic wrap. “That’s that done,” he says. “What are you wearing? I’m going to put on a proper shirt.” He’s already wearing black wool trousers, but only has a t-shirt on over top. He’s stopped wearing dressing gowns as often, as John has mentioned casually that it makes his arse more difficult to access.
"Alright, alright..." John waved his hand, slightly overwhelmed by the amount of sentiment. He sank back on the couch and flicked on the telly.
"Yes, but that's good. He needs to rest. I know you want him to be better already but you have to give him time to rest my little pirate. I'm sorry we can't play pirated again yet." Hamish snuggled closer to him, clinging to his shirt and looking at his Grandmother.
"What?" Mycroft's eyes went wide as he looked at his brother. "I thought you said marriage was a contrived affair with no real meaning."
"We have fought so many battles side by side, Sherlock. If you had babysat me all the time like you are now we never would have even had the chance. You like that I take risks, that's part of why you chose me as your flatmate. If I had taken the peaceful and easy way out you would have died before we solved our very first case." John sighed as his shoulders sagged under the weight of the emotional burden he was carrying. "It's just... I already feel helpless enough without Mycroft and now you constantly reminding me of how I have failed."
“I was hoping to catch you here.” Gregory smiled, John nodded but did not speak. “Sherlock, I have a few cases that the Yard is working on that do not make any sense to me. I was hoping, since you are so good at solving puzzles and understanding how people work, that you might come have a look at them.”
“P-Please…” Meaghan gasped her voice dry. She was weak, having ridden non-stop to bring John to safety.
"Your doctor," The nurse smirked and nodded to John. John blushed slightly and Sherlock shook his head. Even half dead John was worrying about him.
“John, it is the middle of the night. Why have you asked me to meet you here alone?” He sighed. “You have been behaving very oddly and it is driving your lover mad.”
Sherlock took his hand and half drug him back into the house. Anthea came to them to offer them anything they needed and Sherlock snapped at her to leave them be. He pulled John in his room and snapped the door shut behind them, pulling him to himself for a deeply lustful kiss.
until we were home. Claiming he did not want to repeat himself to you." Sherlock spat, pouting. "So brother, tell
And so it was. That evening they went to dinner with the Duke, where Moriarty made it quite clear that he did not approve of their engagement. Lord Moran made an appearance but John was saved any interaction from him by the presence of his sister, who refused to part from his side for a moment. Comfortably entertained by his fiancé and his sister John passed the time easily. Their wedding was quickly arranged and just over two months after his rebirth as a vampire John Holmes had his lover all to himself in the rich trappings of a French manor. His head was still swimming from all of it, the fancy ceremony, the all too fake tears from his mother, and the overwhelming feeling of dread when he saw the look on Moriarty's face gnawing away at his stomach.
"I don't believe she intended to meet with him at all, I think he surprised her when he showed up at the restaurant she went to. He told her that he'd found a man willing to marry her and make her very wealthy in the process, if she would turn away from you and from her girlfriend. She refused outright and he vowed he would not let her continue on the way she was. He had learned about Uthur's attempt to destroy his bloodline in retaliation for destroying his and James' and he decided that if that was how Uthur wanted to play then he would confront him first. Marcus wanted to set a war ablaze in the Order so he poisoned her using the Serpent's Claw. He deliberately used the Serpent's Claw for each of those murders." He saw Sherlock's look and sighed witheringly. "The Serpent's Claw is a talon shaped dagger type weapon. It has been the ceremonial weapon of choice for the Order for centuries. It is rarely used these days but when it is, it is done for a killing that is seen as purging the Order of some darkness believed to be creeping in via the member who is murdered." He looked up at John, seeing how tightly wound his face was. Sherlock was watching John closely as well.
taken care of.” He replied coolly, his eyes flashing over John. John could feel the force of Jim trying to push his way into his mind but he easily repelled it. His pendant flashing slightly.
"As always taking care of us." Sherlock smirked, teasing. He turned to look at John with a very intent glance, something unspoken passing between them.
"He will be. Mrs. Hudson doesn't even realize it. The gas leak was a cover, they've set some sort of trap for us at Baker Street which will be activated on New Year's day just after midnight. The timing will be exact, so that is some relief. John and I have already worked out the entire detail of the plan and he is aware of the risk involved."
“What a noble fool you continue to be. Even after being shown your nobility is naught but weak. You willingly hand me the keys to a kingdom that could be yours, just to save little Sherlock’s life?” Moriarty’s grin grew as he stepped closer and circled John. “Oh my, my… What is this? Has the kitten lost his collar?” His hand was instantly wrapped around John’s neck, squeezing tightly. John, however, did not flinch.
worked this all out. You made me believe you'd killed yourself, this is much easier than that. How is this not going to work?" He furrowed his brow as he surveyed Sherlock, watching his face tighten as it did when he was
"You are nothing, John Watson. You will never be anything. Sherlock will be mine and you will pay for what you have done to me. I think we shall begin now."
"Never, my love. Never." Sherlock promised and he bit down on his own wrist, offering it to John. John fought, trying to pull away however the hunger inside him was overwhelming. He began to suckle on the proffered wrist much the way a babe might suckle its' mother, settling down as the blood lulled him into comfort and a half sleep. Sherlock's attention never faltered from his love, still cradling him and rocking him gently.
Hello my beautiful readers. I know it has been an age (seriously I took a Sherlockian hiatus there) but this store is most assuredly #NotDead and I do intend to keep to a 2-3 month update cycle now that I have wrapped up some other responsibilities in my life.
They drifted off, enjoying the closeness of each other and John. They slept for hours before Anthea slowly crept in the room and just barely nudged John’s foot. John opened his eyes and looked down at her before sliding out of the grip of the brothers to stand beside her. They both smiled as Sherlock instinctively curled closer to Mycroft, burying his head against the long expanse of his brother's torso. Anthea helped John into his dressing gown and led him just outside the room.
“Something about Sebastian has changed, his tone was much darker than he has used with me previously. He also made veiled accusations that you are mistreating me, demanding of me that shall I ever become unhappy I should seek his comfort. I…” John looked down, trembling violently. “In all the years I have associated with him I have never before felt so terribly threatened.”
"Why?" He just let him have the space to feel. No pressure, no anger or disappointment in his voice. This was the third time John had watched as Sherlock tried to work through something like this. First with
"You obviously miss her, and if what my pavement addled head remembers I'm fairly certain she misses you." Sherlock ignored his comment about her being there and launched into an explanation.
"Some of us more than others." She smirked and her eyes flicked to Sherlock who had the eye patch off and was positively devouring the pictures with his piercing gaze. They didn't worry themselves with Sherlock's behavior anymore, knowing as they did that he likely wasn't even in the room with them anymore.
"Sherlock, this sudden change in behavior is alarming." Mycroft said softly, as they stepped into the office and Lestrade closed the door.
"Greg?!" He shouted and a slight grunt let him know Greg was off to the side behind the couch. He had a nasty bump on his head.
“Begging for me?” Sebastian purred, perhaps John was finally giving in to the inevitable. He had hoped this absence would be enough to break the younger vampire. His smile grew as he purred with pride. “Good, take me to him.” He dropped his things there in the hallway as he stepped away with Meaghan.
"He has no hold over your husband, Sherlock." Mycroft said reassuringly but Sherlock continued to brood as he paced. Mycroft motioned for John to continue.
"I..." Sherlock paused, he was paler as he stepped back. He extracted the small black case from his chest pocket and slid it open. He slowly, with a trembling hand extracted an exact copy of the key but with a green piece of sea glass.
. He bit back the words afraid of what they meant to both of them. Afraid to let that much sentiment out into the world just yet. He sighed heavily and changed his tack. "What happens if you get hurt?!" There was a sort of desperate quality hidden behind his angry tone that made John sag. John returned his gaze to the floor fighting another wave of shame and trying to calm his anger.
He gets into bed as quietly as he can, and turns onto his side behind Sherlock’s still form. “Are you still awake?” he whispers.
“Put them in,” Sherlock says, his tone unfocused as his fingers untie the apron. “And then take a step away from the stove. That’s it – just like that.” He smiles to himself as John moans, Sherlock’s fingers coming round the front to find his erection.
The goodbyes are said and Sherlock gently leads John from the flat, taking his hand once the door is closed behind them. “Are you all right?” he asks carefully as they walk toward the Underground stop.
John wonders privately whether Sherlock has told him about all of their favourite places, but decides firmly against saying anything about this. He nods. “Okay,” he says hollowly. “And – how did it end?”
Maybe Sherlock will tell him whatever he’s not saying about that bomb now, he thinks, but Sherlock shakes his head a little. “I don’t know. Psychopaths come in all varieties. There are still a few missing pieces here. But we’re getting there, John! One thing is certain: if we don’t want to be poisoned, ourselves, we need to make very sure that we seem to be backing off. Perhaps we should interview Phil and tell him that we’ve run into nothing but dead ends, and are just going to enjoy the rest of the weekend.”
The alarmed facilitator gives his colleague a quick look, then says, “Yes, of course. Have a good morning, Dr Watson.”
John looks at him for a moment. He wavers visibly, seeming torn between saying something more about their discussion, but eventually decides against it. “Staying over here, then?” he asks, striving to keep his tone light.
Maybe not. He deals with the rubbish, then goes back upstairs, leaving the door to the stairwell open, so that he’ll hear it the instant Sherlock comes home –
“It’s a long weekend, brother mine,” Mycroft informs him. “It ends on Monday afternoon. You would have six days. If you fail to solve it, you’ll have to find another conference to attend with a different cover story that the staff would find believable. I mean, everyone knows who the two of you are. There is already plenty of speculation in the gossip tabloids about the two of you; hence I think that the engagement story would sell rather well. Two appearances, however, and they’ll know they’re being investigated for sure.”
“Yes,” he says, and that’s all that needs saying for the time being. They lie there in each other’s arms, their bodies coming down from the high, and eventually, they sleep.
John is looking into his eyes, his head turned sideways on the pillow. “I’ve been such an idiot. Blaming Mary’s death on you. Walking out on you, that day in the hospital. After what I’d done. I – do know that, Sherlock. I’ve been meaning to bring it up, but I could never seem to find the right way to do it, just – say it out loud. And then when you said you thought things were too fragile between us – I just got stubborn about it and handled it so badly, right up to last night. I phoned your brother this morning, you know. Before we went to the landing site.”
John sits down, too, his back against the left post of the stone bridge. “I’m utter shit at putting any of this into words,” he says, his voice still strained. “I’m trying, Sherlock. I swear I am. It’s just – hard.”
When he grows too sensitive, he pulls himself out of his fist and resumes pulling at John’s erection. John is panting and flushed and Sherlock, rendered weak by the strength of his orgasm, drops his head to the crook of John’s neck and shoulder and sucks there, hard, fist flying along John’s penis. John is breathing out a steady stream of profanity through heavy, hot breaths, Sherlock’s name mixed into them. Sherlock adds his teeth and tongue and John cries out then and comes hard, groaning and thrusting and then collapsing forward against Sherlock’s chest.
Lestrade releases him, the grin not fading. “Ah, knock it off. You know you’re over the moon. Sure sounded like it last night, at any rate!”
“Tonight?” Chris asked, an eyebrow rising. He was leaning forward on both elbows, and snuck another chip.
God, he knows exactly how to turn my heart into mush. I reach for his face with my free hand and kiss him, just long enough that it won’t be completely inappropriate, not that either of us cares particularly about that. We hold hands on his thigh and chat for the rest of the trip, him pointing out things that I hadn’t noticed about the journey before and making plans for a weekend getaway sometime, on one of our free weekends. “It would mean three weekends in a row of no cases,” I warn him.
Sherlock turns his head and looks at him now, maybe seeing more than he should. “It’s not your fault,” he says evenly. “You didn’t know. I worked rather hard at keeping you from knowing. I didn’t want it to… compromise whatever you felt you needed or wanted to do with regards to your marriage.”
They walk through the north wing and exit through the back building where the spa and counselling rooms are, to a door leading out onto the grounds. The walking tour that Kyle led is just returning, the walkers looking tired but content. Kyle greets them and asks if they brought their map. John shows him that they have, and Kyle gives them a direction or two, as there are multiple trails. They thank him and move off.
He’s awake in the dark of his bedroom, fist jerking furiously over his cock, and Jesus, that’s twisted, but he’s way too far gone now to stop – all he can think of is Sherlock’s tongue in his mouth and pressing up against him like that – John grunts twice, loudly, and comes all over the empty far side of the bed. He gives himself another stroke or two, letting it wind down, and listens to his own heavy breathing, strangely magnified in the dark of the room, his heart thumping.
John can understand this. “Yeah, I get that,” he says sympathetically. “Learning how to read another person is unique to every person and situation.” He pauses, wondering if he should address this lack of familiarity with giving head and offer something, but it already sort of came up yesterday and was awkward then. He can’t very well offer to coach Sherlock in the art of giving a blow job without it just sounding like he wants a blow job. Which he does, but not like this. And then there’s the entire subject of penetrative sex, which he’s only versed in with regards to female bodies. They’re getting out of
The accusation stabs like a knife. Sherlock can’t look at him, so he looks down at his hands. “I didn’t think you wanted to hear about it,” he says quietly. “I was – grateful that you were speaking to me again at all.”
They get ready together in an uncomplicated quiet, then get into Sherlock’s bed at the same time. John turns onto his side, Sherlock facing him with very slight apprehension that he can’t quite manage to disguise. Communication, John reminds himself. “Can I – I’d like to hold you,” he says, feeling like an arse, but he thinks that Ella might be proud that he actually said this aloud. “Would that… could we do that?”
“Okay.” Molly twists the combination lock on the fridge shut – not that it would keep Sherlock out if he decided to take an interest in her specimens, but it’s worth trying for some security, at any rate – and rapidly calculates transit times. “I’d best get going, then,” she says.
John puts his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and kisses him on the jaw. “I can’t wait to marry you,” he says into the skin just below Sherlock’s ear, and it sounds convincing enough. His lips touch Sherlock’s neck over and over again and Sherlock feels some of the tightness dissipate from his shoulders. He cannot resist John when this is happening, and doesn’t care to try. He puts his hands over John’s left forearm and squeezes it. John reaches for his face and pulls it sideways, putting his mouth on Sherlock’s and kissing him for a long moment that stretches out and out, the one kiss becoming two, three, and a fourth that doesn’t let go as they reach for each other, hands fighting into each other’s clothing, stripping pieces off and dropping them to the floor. This –
“No, it’ll be fine right here against the wall,” he says, indicating the patch of floor between the door to the corridor and the bathroom door. “If you don’t mind her being in here. I’d just put her upstairs but it’s a little far off if she cries.”
“Oi, save it for later!” Justin hoots, coming over with Thom, and they find themselves engulfed in a four-way hug.
This is definitely a challenge now. Sherlock keeps his voice utterly even. “I am somewhat well-known, as is John, if you recall. We relish our privacy.” He hopes rather devoutly that whatever credit card Lestrade used to pay for this has been thoroughly back-stopped.
“No problem. You know we’re always happy to have her.” Her eyes go to Sherlock, but they’re less sharp than they sometimes are. “I hear you tried to blow yourself up,” she says conversationally.
John still doesn’t understand. “But last night,” he says. “I mean – what did you think I was thinking when that was happening?” he asks, still feeling weird about saying it out loud. “Did you think I didn’t want to, or…? I don’t get it.”
The food comes forty minutes later, piping hot and delicious. The chicken shish taouk is tender and perfectly spiced, sitting on a bed of fragrant rice next to the lamb/beef shawarma that John loves, a heap of crisply-roasted potatoes alongside, with chickpea and tabouleh salads in their own containers. There’s also hummus and garlic mayo and pita, and it all smells and looks mouth-wateringly good. They arrange it all on plates and eat together at the table, the fire that John built crackling in the fireplace. Afterwards, they retire to their chairs with their books, though Sherlock finds it difficult to concentrate, particularly given that John is wearing his glasses without even having been prompted by him. He’s wearing his own, new frames and catches John glancing over at him more than once.
Sherlock doesn’t look reassured. “You don’t have to do this,” he says, self-consciousness all over his face.
John exhales. “I thought it did need a talking about, yes,” he says. “But the short version is that I don’t regret it. At all. It was – good. Yeah. Really good.”
John swallows and nods, aware that Sherlock can’t see him. “Yeah. Okay.” His voice comes out half a whisper. He goes back to cleaning the cuts, but his mind won’t stop. It must have happened when Sherlock was away, then. Someone, somewhere, did this to him: whipped him, maybe? The lines are plainly visible in the direct light of the loo, long and faintly silvery, raking the length of Sherlock’s back in any number of stripes. Thirteen or fourteen, he thinks. They might not even be visible in a dimmer room, but Sherlock has clearly kept him from noticing the scars before. He just wasn’t perceptive enough to even notice his attention being manoeuvred away like that – Sherlock is far too skillful when it comes to navigating matters that way, and this is obviously something he feels extremely private about. John swallows down his curiosity and his concern both, though the latter is even greater than it was when they were in the alley. Was that a trauma response, then? Related to whatever happened that made these scars? John bites back his questions and silently finishes cleaning and dressing the wounds from the electrical cord, placing the gauze and tape as deftly as he can. When he’s done, he clears his throat. “All right,” he says, to let Sherlock know he’s finished. “I’ll just – clean up in here. Er – are you hungry at all?” It’s a bit of a lame gambit, but food
John raises his eyes to Sherlock’s, full of rage. “I want to be the one to do it,” he says, his voice low and tense. “When we find her, once Rosie’s safe, I want her dead. If I can’t take the shot for some reason, then you have to. No prison time. No deportation. Just – gone.”
“I don’t give three fucks,” Sherlock announces at full volume, the precision of the k so perfect that I want to suck it out of his throat right then and there, but I’m also laughing again, hardly noticing when Sherlock’s demeanour changes. “What’s this?” he asks curiously, tugging me by the hand to another rack.
“Of course I do!” Molly is very firm. She pulls Mary’s wet hair back with one hand and kisses her neck. “I’m right here with you.” She moves her other hand lower now, slipping her fingers into the hottest part of Mary’s body and rubbing, using technique she learned at Mary’s own fingers. She starts slowly, murmuring into Mary’s ear about how much she loves touching her, and when Mary’s thighs begin to tremble, she knows it’s close. She holds Mary through it and feels a thrill of power go through her, far more than what she ever felt in letting Todd spend himself in her – she holds Mary’s orgasm in her very hands and Mary trusts her with it – this is power of a sort that Molly has never possessed before, and it’s a bit addictive, honestly.
Sherlock turns to John. “Let’s start with that, while we’re waiting for the coroner to remove the body,” he says, his eyes gleaming. To Lestrade he says, “I assume you traced the call.”
Sherlock bites his lip and nods, slightly embarrassing as it is to admit. He’s made a silent vow to only ever be honest with John from here on in. “I liked it a lot,” he makes himself confess, his voice low.
When the alarm goes off, John starts, inhaling sharply. Sherlock opens his eyes and reaches out to turn it off, then yawns and stretches. John lets go of his semi-soft penis now and rolls onto his back to stretch. Sherlock turns over, drawn to him like a magnet, and curls himself around John again, all of his skin already missing contact with John’s. He pushes his mostly-soft penis up against John’s thigh, missing the warmth of his hand, and hugs John to himself in unabashed want.
John attempts to clear his throat again. “Yeah,” he says, and it comes out half in a whisper. “Just – up here, a bit. A little further.”
Sherlock nods. The decision, when it was finally made, came with wet eyes on John’s part, but a firm sensation of having made the right choice for his daughter. Sherlock held him and asked if he was completely certain, and John was adamant that he was. “I think so,” he says now. “The first week or two will be the hardest, I think. So I’m taking him away. We’re going to give ourselves a bit of a honeymoon. That way, Rosie can really settle in properly and by the time we get back, we’ll really want to see her again, too. Right now I think we’ll both be glad to have a bit of a break.”
John glances at Sherlock. It’s coming from one of the bedrooms in the back. “We’re coming,” he calls back, and they move swiftly toward her voice.
"Me?" John exclaimed, "What about you? You reek of formaldehyde! Did you have a biology experiment you decided to swim in today?"
John didn't notice Sherlock looking at him like he was a creature from an alien planet, or a pup that was easily startled, yet a brave soldier at the same time.
"I know your sister is a trouble maker, hell, the whole school knows she is. She get's bad grades and parties constantly, she sleeps around, she drinks. I know your mother passed away three years ago, because you missed two weeks of school and it was all anyone would talk about for nearly a week. I know your father hits your sister; she'll show up with red marks on her face, sometimes even bruises."
