“DTR Steve?” Tony asked that night and Steve calmly explained that they were not having sex until they Defined The Relationship.
So instead of complimenting him when they were in the workshop, he just started doing it during fights. It began with a “Good job Iron Man,” but it went south from there.
“I DON’T WANT A DOORDASH FOR DEMONS TONY!” Steve screamed in a high voice that he would deny till his dying day.
“Oh Clint, you’re making our Captain blush,” and because the universe had it against him, there was Tony. “But what is it about this time?” He asked while searching for his favorite mug.
“Language,” said a chorus in his ear because his team was made up of little shits. How many times did he have to remind them he was in the Army. He cursed like the best of them.
Once they had their orders, Steve took a deep breath and prepared to talk to James about his wish to date Tony. And then took another. And another. And now he was hyperventilating.
“If I’m honest here, I’ve actually never been called up?” The handsome demon told them. “They train us for this, but I never paid much attention. I mean, they can’t expect us to, right? We’re in hell for god’s sake — shit, sorry, for satan’s sake. This was the first call I received and I wanted to see why I was chosen.”
Somehow, after weeks of Clint strategically ensuring Tony and Steve always sat together, that became the norm, even without Clint’s intervention. Tony would come into the living room, look around and sit wherever Steve was. It didn’t matter whether or not there were other empty seats. There had been  that time when Tony actually sat on Steve’s outstretched legs and wiggled until Steve made some space for him.
So Tony read books, searched online, and even went to a mystic store called Enchanted Chaos that was recommended to him by Natasha, who found the whole thing amusing and told Tony he could sleep on her couch if things went tits up.
“They reminded me of you, Shellhead,” Steve answered using his shield to aim one of Tony’s repulsors at a bot coming at them.
Next to the table where the guestbook was, where there would normally be a picture of the happy couple, there was a blown up scrapbook page - and while Tony and Steve could have vetoed it, they loved it. Well, Tony loved it. Steve just loved Tony.
“You don’t need another plan Stevie,” Bucky was saying while Steve sat at the kitchen table looking like a puppy that didn’t get his treat . “Just go to the workshop, and say, ‘Tony, I want to take you on a date. I’d like to take you out dancing, and then some fondue,’ and then you take him out.”
“Excuse me, the correct term would be Cambion for now. Demons are usually fallen angels and I was never an angel,” Bucky said. “I won’t actually be a demon like you’d see in the Bible when I graduate. My momma was human and my father an incubus.”
“Tony play nice,” Steve began and immediately followed it up with, “Now move, jerk. This is Tony’s spot.” Steve caught the small pleased smile on Tony’s face when he passed the popcorn.
The next year, during their, now, annual Halloween party, Clint showed up with graveyard dirt, a stuffed cat plush, and a kitchen knife. “I’m ready,” he told Steve as soon as he opened the door. “I want my very own demon.”
Anyway, That’s what made movie night both Steve’s favorite and worst night of the week. Sitting next to Tony, almost feeling the warmth he emanated and watching those nimble fingers fly across his StarkPad. Sitting close enough to see the few freckles that adorned his face.
“Come on Cap! I was just pollen your leg. It’s nice to see a blossomin’ romance between my two buds.”
It had been three months since Steve had finally realized that the funny feeling he got whenever Stark Tony was around was not annoyance at the mechanic. And in his desperation at the realization, he’d made the ultimate mistake: he told Clint about it. Well, not necessarily told as much as Clint dropped in on him muttering “fuck fuck fuck fuck” and Steve had been so surprised that he blurted out “I think I love Stark!”
The answer was a resounding no. So they kept going as they were, dinners, movies, whole days spent doing nothing but basking in each other’s presence.
“Look, Tony is amazing,” Steve began. “He’s smart, and witty, and funny, and generous. And I think he deserves the world.”
Steve was at his wits' ends. Nothing he did got through Tony’s thick skull… for a genius, Tony really was an idiot when it came to emotions. He was glad he wasn’t trying to woo Tony a year ago. After the first confused look from Tony, he’d have thought Tony was not interested, he’d have given up and probably moved out of the country; ok, that was an exaggeration, he’d only have moved out of state.
“Well, now I know you’re on the table, cap…” Tony said, raising one eyebrow suggestively. “But who’s the lucky fella?”
And that was that. A few weeks later, Steve had moved in and they found themselves planning the Halloween party to end all parties.
The book he found there gave step by step instructions on the summoning of demons. He had everything he needed, well, not everything but he could improvise. He was sure that if demons did indeed exist, it would be the intent that would matter.
Something was working, Steve only wished he knew what to do next. The magazines weren’t too helpful with that.
“Damn right you were in the wrong. Tony can be difficult to get along with at first but inside that prickly pear exterior, there is a big squishy marshmallow.”
“Tony, I think you are amazing, and I wanted this to be a date. Hopefully the first of many, and I hope you want that too. Do you?”
The roses, the compliments, the texts, none of that mattered if Tony didn’t realize what was happening.
Tony threw himself into the research with everything he had. Even his trustworthy AI J.A.R.V.I.S. was tasked with searching the internet for anything that might help them.
Since then, he’d been signed up for no less than 4 magazine subscriptions (Steve would never tell Clint, but Cosmo had given him some ideas about what to do). Clint also liked to choose rom-coms during movie nights and they always dealt with someone falling in love with someone else, but only after realizing their first impressions were wrong. There were a surprising number of movies with that premise.
“Great. I’ll see you then; there’s a great burger place I found that I think you’ll love,” Steve got up from his chair and stood in front of Tony awkwardly smiling at him and looking like he might just burst out of his skin. He asked Tony out, and Tony said yes.
Making a last minute decision, Steve ran in, dropped a couple of hundreds on the attendant’s hand and grabbed the bouquet. They smelled amazing. He figured he’d stash them somewhere safe and come back for them after the battle.
“Oh, well, I think - “ Tony began but was interrupted by the Avengers alarm, causing Steve’s heart to beat even faster.
“Sam wants to have my ass-kicking, leather-wearing, murder-faced babies, Steve. How did you not know that? But that’s not the point. The point is, desperate times need desperate measures.”
There were no parents to talk to, but there WAS a Rhodey to convince. It would be better if Steve knew for a fact that his feelings were returned, but it wouldn’t hurt to have the colonel on his side before he continued with his plan to woo Tony. Steve knew they were like brothers, and he had to admit, it had been nice when Sam asked for his permission to take Bucky out. Even if it had been in the middle of their kitchen and Sam was wearing nothing except Bucky’s boxers.
“Um,” he heard Tony begin and Steve’s heart sped up. “Captain? Where’s your All American ass right now? The team is busy with their own batch of bots and another one of my repulsors is out. Hiding behind a car is not my style but it will take me a few minutes to fix it. I need support like five minutes ago!”
When there weren’t that many bots around, he saw Tony’s hair behind a car and why would he not be wearing his helmet? He was going to have a heart attack. Loving Stark was not good for his health.
Bucky set a mug of coffee in front of Steve and after a moment, added a generous amount of Whiskey. “Stevie, you’re being as subtle as the uniform you wore during your USO days.”
“You can NOT bring a ouija board into our home, Tony,” Steve told him. “You don’t know what may come through, especially if you are not taking it seriously. There are horrible things that can be summoned, or evil ghosts and poltergeists or demons!”
“I’m not asking him out for fondue,” Steve was saying as Tony walked into the kitchen, most likely looking for his first cup of coffee of the morning. Steve was trying hard not to stare, the suit Tony was wearing fit him perfectly, and if he wasn’t careful, he might actually write that poem about his ass.
This whole thing was getting worse and worse by the second. Steve was going to kill Bucky, Clint and maybe even James for making him think just asking Tony out would be enough. This was just great.
He chopped some more.  Cooking, while not exactly Steve’s favorite activity, did at least keep him busy.  And while absolutely nothing besides maybe (
“What do you want from me, Tony?” Steve says.  “Bruce asked me for help, so I did what I had to do.  It has nothing to do with - ”
Steve rolled his eyes as he tore the cardboard away.  “I’m not sure most history textbooks say ‘TV’ is what defines the modern era.  There, you think?”
Tony snorts.  “Nice?  Nice would have been the bottle of wine I have on hold for us at Le Bernardin.”
And then there’s Rogers, Natasha thinks as she opens up an unlabeled bottle (moonshine, 140 proof, Clint likes to threaten to use it to clean the john) and pours a healthy glass.  A momentary hush falls over the Black Widow when he walks in, until Clint shakes his hand and the regulars chuckle and murmur to their friends that he looks like a lawman because he is one, but there’s nothing to worry about, he’s as crooked as the rest of them.
“So what’s new around here?” Scott says cheerfully.  “I feel like it’s kind of lame being in California all by ourselves.  What if there’s some kind of west coast-based supervillain?”
“Worth a shot,” Steve says, and Tony hears his motorcycle rev as he comes into view two blocks away.
Banner shrugs and eases into the barstool next to Steve.  "Miss Romanov asked me to come.  She seems to believe you're not here to bring me in."
Steve shrugs.  “Not bad.  Only took a couple days.  Oh, and I went to that great Chinese place in Greenwich Village that closed in 2014.”
“Could be worse,” Steve says, which is true every day, all the time, but Tony tries not to think about it that way and apparently Steve agrees because he adds, “I mean, I could be stuck getting brunch with Sam and his one night stand.”
Natasha watches Stark slip through the crowd after Rogers and tries not to roll her eyes.  If she cared about either of them even a little bit, she'd be embarrassed for them.
“The city’s rotten,” Stark says.  “I’m not talking about the speakeasies - they’re business establishments meeting a need, it’s the government’s own fault that most of them are run by the mob - but the whole core of this city has gone bad.  I just want to try to safeguard whatever small parts of it I can.”
Peter took the opportunity to snuggle up to Tony, who always welcomed him even though he usually sat in the chair in the corner. ”FRIDAY, turn on the morning news, will you? It’s chilly today, I can feel it in my old bones. Wanna watch the weather.”
bored he was. He had posted a selfie too, showing off his vein cannula. The caption read ”Back in hospital with flu, literally cannot breathe through my nose ew”. A second post was showing off a sleeping Steve, captioned ”I thought I was the one needing rest???” Tony smiled to himself.
“I’ll check, bud, but I think that’s gonna be hard to make happen in just a few hours. Harry’s really popular at the moment.”
So Steve set out on a mission in secret, one to find a mother figure for Peter. He didn’t tell Tony because the man was so dang sensitive about stuff like this. He would go on a rant about how just because they were gay, they could do parenting just as well as anyone else. Steve knew that. The two of them were Peter’s parents and no-one really had any issue with this.
As the evening went by, Peter slowly but surely felt peaceful again. He thought about how everything had been fine with Steve, how nothing ever seemed to get to that man. He knew by his dad’s look that he was thinking the exact same thing. Steve was their rock. He was their rock that required loving, stable relationships to be so, but he was one of Peter’s biggest heroes.
”Pete, sweetie, come out and let me look at you.” Yep, Peter should have known. Papa was there, probably with his thermometer of doom. Suppose the achy bones and itching eyes weren’t just tiredness.
”Sam, did you know there’s going to be a new year ball in january, right after school starts again?” Peter asked, trying to keep things light.
Peter slumped in his seat. In Steve’s opinion, his son was much too well aware of how easy it could be to get a table.
”I called your principal to schedule a meeting about you-know-what. He had time this morning, so it starts in ten minutes.We want you to join in about half an hour, so your homeroom teacher will come get you from class when we’ve explained the situation to them. It will be the principal, your homeroom teacher and maybe a couple of others who have time to join. Does that sound fine to you?”
While steve rolled the bed table over and dished up Peter’s favourite sandwich and a small packet of crisps, he explained how Tony had gone home to shower, update their family and prepare for next week. Dr. Garcia had told them to prepare to stay for a few days, so Steve and Tony would be switching between sleeping at the hospital with Peter, so that they could also go to work every other day.
”It was the ticket for the new year’s ball.” Peter said after the laughter died down. Tony looked over at Steve. In monday’s meeting with the school, they had agreed for Tony to be an extra parent present, to make sure Peter was adjusting well and figuring out how he would deal with his own behaviour. Peter knew this, but it wasn’t his favourite topic. He felt a bit watched, which was understandable, but didn’t changed the fact that they felt it necessary.
”Uhm, Peter?” He didn’t answer. A cough. Wait. That wasn’t papa’s cough? Peter turned around, and there was a conference table full of people. Peter knew some of them, recognising people from practices and tests he had observed at shield and some from the other offices beside papa’s. ”Oh my god. I’m so sorry! God, sorry! I’m just gonna… Go. I’m so sorry for interrupting,” he said, already grabbing his backpack and jogging out the door. He almost shut it before he remembered his papa. He said he didn’t have meetings that day, so he obviously wasn’t part of that. Peter left the door open.
”There we go! Right. As expected, not great. 102. We’ll do one more before dr. Green goes home today, in case I need to call. Oh god, Pete, don’t pretend like I’m the bad guy here. It’s not that bad and you know it, suck it up. Come on, make space for me too. Wanna watch a movie before we get up? A show?”
, Steve! There was a significant chance you were lying half dead under a car wreck, I wasn’t about to take any chances!
”Tony, grab us some water, will you?” Steve asked, barely panting. Tony had a normal, un-serumed body and Peter was tiny. But Steve didn’t need to exhaust himself, it was all about Peter.
Peter watched as Tony placed a hand on his top button, and opened the door. Peter was quick to do the same. They walked over to the end of the conference table where the camera was set up with two chairs. Peter could hear the other participants talking about the two chairs when they were still out of shot, wondering if ”Captain America was going to join again”.
Tony nodded along, occasionally glancing back at Peter. He was awake now, picking at the hem of his sweater and looking around.
“I know! I know. Should have checked. Not happening again. But when I was living at Bucky’s, I could finally identify the circumstances it happened. It’s always when I’m reminded of you, when I remember how much I love you. So, yeah. I love you so much it hurts, baby. Like I said in my vows, we’ll always make it through. I’ll be there because I need to be with you as much as you need to be with me.”
Peter blinked, slowly becoming aware of his surroundings. That certainly didn’t look like his room, or the master. Oh, pain everywhere? He couldn’t breathe through his nose. The room was spinning slightly as he tried sitting up. Oh, right, the hospital. Wait. Fathers?
“Yeah all right, you go home now, papa. You don’t get to dictate what dad and I do when you’re not there”
”Thanks, James. Really, thanks for today.” Steve was sincere, placing a hand on James’ shoulder. Rhodey smiled at the men while leading them into the living room. He was glad that Tony and him had managed to keep their close relationship after he got married, the only change really being that Rhodes had gained a close friend in Steve too. After Peter came into their lives, Rhodey had been prepared to take a step back from the close relationship he had with the pair, but they had welcomed him into Peter’s inner circle of family, giving him the role as one of two godfathers. Rhodey loved the kid like he was his own.
”The doctor should get to us pretty fast, Hap. Would you mind waiting until we know how long we’re staying?” ”No problem, boss. I’ll just take a look around the area, if you don’t mind.”
”Yeah, you’re finally getting it honey! They represent types of care that you have to treat the kid with for them to have the right balance in their life. Motherly principle represents a safe homebase that he will always know he can trust. Fatherly principle represents pushing the kid out in the world, introducing them to experiencing things for themselves, without us there to hold his hand. They’re really just old, stereotypical names that don’t really matter. What matters is that we’re representing both of those caring strategies to Peter. God knows we’re providing a safe home for him, with the way we baby him from time to time. And I think we do alright with the fatherly principle too, you know? We try pushing him so he’ll make experiences on his own and he does. With his friends, business partners and the press. Truly, babe, we’re fine. He’s fine. Come on, let’s go creep over him like we did when he was little,” Tony explains, patient as ever when it comes to Steve, but grabbing his hand to go. But something was still kinda buzzing in the back of his head.
”Hey Steve, you alright? Just as distressed as your man?” Steve sighed. He’d been slightly distracted all day, although not nearly as bad as Tony. ”Hey man, when does Pete want to come home?”
See, steve loved reading, he loved parenting and he loved expanding his knowledge. Therefore, throughout the years, he had read quite a lot of parenting books. Most of the books talked a lot about preparing the kid for the future, giving them what they needed so they would turn out a decent human being.
The doctor was on the young side, but was doing a good job at calming Tony down as they were discussing Peter. Tony knew how visible his anxious feelings were, but he couldn’t help it without Steve there. ”Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks for being so quick about everything, by the way. Our security guard isn’t the biggest fan of open floor plans, makes him stressed. It’ll help to be in a room.”
”No, he hasn’t been since last night. Says he doesn’t need to. As mentioned, I haven’t really been successful in getting him to drink.”
”Morning, I forgot to show you the ticket for prom yesterday, look at it!” Peter was excited again, once he remembered the ticket he had kept in his pajama pocket. He climbed into the bed, sitting cross legged between Tony and Steve’s legs showing them the ticket.
Peter could hear the smile in papa’s voice. ”I look forward to getting home, I was thinking I’d bring Bucky and Sam, so you don’t miss out on your day with them? Dad and I have some stuff we need to do anyways.”
After laying Peter down flat, he went into the bedroom across the hall. Peter needed warmer clothes if they were going outside of the penthouse. And a couple of changes, just in case. And then tony needed to get dressed. And get Peter’s records from the drawer in the hallway. And his medication from the kitchen cabinet. And a bottle of water, and juice pouches. And a couple of granola bars in Tony’s coat pocket. Was he forgetting something? Ah, alerting Happy of their excursion.
A hand grabbed him around the waist, keeping him from reaching his fathers. ”Peter! You’ve got to watch out!” Someone said. Peter stopped squirming as he saw a car driving past him, the driver looking back at him with a slightly panicked expression. Peter turned to the owner of the voice, to see Harry and Lola Osborn’s chauffeur, Klaus, probably there to pick up their little sister. Harry and Lola was the same age as Peter, but they had started school at the normal age so they were freshmen in high school. ”Sorry, thanks Klaus.” He mumbled, before Julietta could catch up with him. ”Peter! Oh, I’m so glad you’re okay, Peter!” She exclaimed, giving him a quick hug before she tugged him across the now empty road.
”Don’t worry, Pete. I know. I just wanted to see you for a couple extra minutes. Uncle Bucky, uncle Sam and I will be leaving before you wake up. We just got called out on a mission that will probably last through the weekend.” Steve explained, and Peter was already jumping back out of his closet, pants only halfway on. Steve had sat down on the bed, Tony standing beside him.
As soon as they had shook on that, Peter went to the living room to pick a movie. It was always fun watching movies at Rhodey’s place because he didn’t have FRIDAY to put on whatever he wanted. James Rhodes was a DVD collector, so he had a whole wall in his living room full of movies. Peter loved dragging his fingers along the long rows and getting a good look at the possibilities.
Tony agreed with him in theory and they had agreed to raise Peter not to use his name to gain favours, but Steve knew that Tony tended to slip up at times.
”Well, if he, a… a grown man, an- an experienced human being, doesn’t know what to say, why does he expect me to?” Peter said, just as slowly. He really didn’t know what to do, he felt like talking to his fathers but didn’t know what he would say. ”Well,” James started. ”I don’t think any of you need to say anything, really. I remember walking in on my parents at your age, and we didn’t really talk about it either. I think the difference is that we didn’t want to talk about it, we just spent a couple of days getting past it, and then pretended like it never happened. It’s what most people do, actually.” Peter looked up. Could they just pretend like nothing happened? It wasn’t what they ever did about stuff, they always sat down to talk about things when something happened.
Peter wasn’t stupid, he knew his dad’s worried voice when he heard it. ”Fri, can you tell me papa’s location right now?”
Tony steadied himself with his hands at the headboard, and lowered to give Steve a slow, light kiss. And Steve felt it again, those tiny tingles, this time all over his face.
Naturally, before Tony could come, something had to happen. This time, several weeks since last time had to be the day Peter walked in on them having sex in the morning. Tony had known this had to happen eventually, there had been some very close calls a few times already. Of course, just Tony’s luck.
Peter was nervous. He’d joined in on conference video chats several times before, but never with people this high up. It was usually with other companies. ”Dad, do I have to be on screen? Can’t I just observe from the side?”
After saying good night to the others downstairs, Peter pretended to lean on his dad and almost fall over the whole way upstairs and into his room. He was annoying Tony into pushing him jokingly onto the bed as soon as they got there, wrapping his son up in the top blanket, face and all. This prompted Peter to pull the man down with him, starting a small wrestling match on the bed. Which all of a sudden stopped, Peter’s giggles dying down as he tried figuring out why Tony was eyeing him suspiciously. ”You’re warm. As in fever warm.” He said, feeling Peter’s forehead, cheeks, neck, back.
Tony rubbed Peter’s back soothingly. The time was twelve, midday. He had just cleaned the kitchen after their brunch, and come back to Peter buried in throw blankets. Tony feared Peter had caught something bad this time, he had heard rumours of employees not feeling well after Peter had left the SI offices the previous day. Stupid, Tony thought to himself. Bringing Peter into the bacteria fest that is the cafeteria? Stupid. Especially when everyone had just returned to work from big family gatherings over christmas with all sorts of germs.
Tony showed off two different suits for Steve to pick. “Yeah, papa told me about the schedule. Sounds great, Pete. Now, I want to know all about this new school of yours. How was it?”
”I’m gonna be better tomorrow, and then I’m going out,” He said after the first episode finished, and the men were cleaning up after dinner. Steve snorted. They all knew which way this was going, Peter wouldn’t be very sick but enough to live on the couch for the first couple of days of christmas break. ”Sure petey, sure,” Tony answered.
Steve was aching. He had skipped the ”relax, gather your thoughts and give your body some fuel” part of debrief so that he could go home sooner.
”Worse.” The boy muttered, clearly not wanting to elaborate. ”Worse, huh? I can see you’re more exhausted now than what you were last night. I observed you being in a better mood and talking more than now.” The doctor put his hand over Peter’s forehead and felt along his neck. ”Is the pain worse too, or just the tiredness?”
After explaining everything to his husband, Steve went to Peter’s room. The bed was as unmade as it used to be, the corner with the comics as messy as it used to be. Steve smiled at the laptop still lying on the bed, making it evident that Peter had broken the ”no laptop after bedtime”-rule. It hadn’t been there when Steve had shut the lights off the night before. He started to go through Peter’s dresser, finding clothes for the boy to wear the next day.
He could hear Tony’s thinking sounds, the rustling and tapping signalling he was probably looking for Steve’s tracker. ”Uh, yeah.
Happy got out of the car first, and Peter readied himself for meeting everyone. It wasn’t that he was embarrassed about being bisexual, but everyone made such a fuss and he wished it would stop. It had to happen some time, though, and Peter had agreed it would be best to get it over with. Peter took a deep breath, and knocked on the window for Happy to open the door.
Peter opted to snuggle further into the blankets at the promise of a day off. He heard Steve exit the shower, the conversation between dad and papa about who was going where. He heard them growing slightly annoyed at each other, because ”Bad guys don’t take snow days, Tony, neither does shield, today will be so busy and he can’t watch TV in my office all day” and ”Well, I can’t exactly take a snow day when I take an
Peter stretched in his bed, still tired. He was curled up under his blankets, but emerged for a minute to pee and also grab his fluffy blanket from its spot in the dresser. A little while longer in bed, then he could grab a late breakfast, call it brunch and stay out until dinner. He just needed a little more sleep.
”Okay bud, do exactly as I do when we walk in. Dramatic entrance and all, you know? Gotta keep ’em on their toes.”
A while later, Steve remembered the paperwork from the mission that he was supposed to have done by monday. Tony was staying the night at the hospital so Steve could go in to work the next day, and they were going to go in shifts until they could take their son home.
”What did you guys do today?” Steve asked, rubbing Peters back as they went in the elevator. Peter had a habit of leaning into the big man’s side when he did that, giving Steve the chance to hug his son close who frankly was getting too big now, despite being a bit underdeveloped physically.
”Spoke briefly to your dad earlier, he said he didn’t know what to say to you. He was afraid you would distance yourself from them instead of getting over it.” Rhodey said in a calm voice, almost like he weighed each world before he said them.
Steve takes a kick to the ribs and flops back against the bar.  "Miss Romanov," he says firmly, "you may want to remove yourself from the situation."
And then he reaches out to squeeze Steve's thigh under the bar, winks, and disappears into the crowd.
“Every day - I’d think how if it was just possible, I’d walk right back into her life and make it work out the way it was supposed to,” Steve said.  “Leave it all behind, live a quiet life, finally get that dance.”  He paused at the crest of a hill, gazed out at the city lights.  “But maybe this wasn’t the way it was supposed to go at all.”
Steve figures the jig is up.  “It was an experimental treatment to see if they could make me immune to mustard gas.  It worked, and then some.”
“Considering you were falling down the stairs at the time, I’m pretty sure that was an accident,” Miss Romanov says.
It's true; they recently put Bruce in a room with a grenade, and the Hulk showed up only long enough to yell, "Puny Banner!" and crush it in a fist before he disappeared again, leaving Bruce holding a smoldering scrap of metal and scowling.
Sam sets down beside him and stows his wings.  “The semi was empty, and the trailer was moving some kid up to his dorm room at Villanova.  Cops find anything?”
“I don’t know how many Caps you know,” Bruce says.  “Okay, so you have a crush on Steve.  Is that it?”
it, actually, but it’s one of the coolest things I’ve ever done.  And scariest.  And most fun.  And wow, okay, I’m doing that thing parents do where they talk about their kids nonstop, I used to hate that, I think I fired somebody for that once, actually.”
“When I came back here, I thought I’d be setting things right,” he said finally.  “Picking up where I left off, taking it all back.  And in some ways I did, but - it turned out there was a whole other set of ‘all’ that I left behind.  No matter where I am, there’ll always be something I can’t have.”
A man with less finely-honed reflexes would have dropped the bottle of milk; as it stood, even Steve bobbled it as he spun around.  “So, you’re real.”
“That was her dream ten years ago,” Steve said.  “Now… I don’t know if I know her well enough to know what she dreams about.”
“I know, I know, I wanted the rules too,” Tony says, holding his hands up in surrender.  “You know why I wanted them?”
thinking that, after all.  “I spend most of my time making sure the business stays up and running.  Mr. Stark’s usually too busy inventing things or getting into trouble to worry about bookkeeping and production lines.”
“What happened here last week was… unfortunate,” Coulson says.  “We’d known for months that there was a double agent inside the bureau, but nobody had fingered Pierce.  If word got out that a high-ranking member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was the head of an organized crime coalition, the entire law enforcement community would suffer.  It could set us back years in our efforts to bring the criminal element of New York under control.”
find Banner, the man shut down as soon as he started asking questions, and there's no reason to believe he might open up now.  It's not worth the risk, Steve decides firmly.
Steve stuck his head into the freezer.  He’d never say it out loud, but god, he missed central air conditioning.  “Do you have a point with all this?”
"Good," Tony says.  He spreads his legs apart, gives Steve better access, but Steve pulls off with a soft
The smoke is getting thinner, and Steve can see that they’re in trouble.  Their group is all strong fighters, but Killian and Pierce have more men, and while they’re not using their guns yet for fear of striking their bosses in the smoky room, Steve knows they don’t have long until the goons decide it’s worth the risk.
“No matter where you are in time, it’s like you can’t help but put every goddamn thing on your own shoulders,” Tony said.
“I saw it on the news like everybody else,” Barnes says.  He keeps looking around furtively, like he expects somebody to jump out from behind the nurse’s station.
“You always have a choice, Agent Rogers,” Coulson says.  “But from what I can tell, you tend to make the right ones.”  He tips his hat at Natasha and heads for the door.  “I’ll be in touch.  Good luck with the repairs.”
Tony wasn’t shocked by either of those revelations, but he decided to keep his mouth shut.  “Me too.”
“Yeah. He knows us too well by now, it's gonna be an issue when he starts lying to us, I'm tellin' ya,"
”Wow, kid. First of all, you’re three minutes early for a change, and then you bring me baked goods? Wait, double positive.. What do you want from me?” Happy eyed him suspiciously, and Peter raised his hands. ”Nothing, I swear! I’m just so ready for school to start again. Although I wouldn’t mind if you remembered this for another time!”
”Yes, it’s a pleasure to meet you, young Stark. I’m sure you must fine these kinds of meetings boring though, lots of the scientific talk is going to go over your head. Stark, do you really think this is better than sticking him with a TV?” One of the men suggested. Tony snorted.
Uh, Pete, can you call uncle Happy and tell him to come to the penthouse? I need to do something. Love you, talk later!” And a click.
”Hey, I’ll have you know we just negotiated new bedtimes and that sounds suspiciously like someone trying to be bumped back half an hour, if you ask me.” Tony grumbled, making a beeline for the coffee Steve had prepared before he left.
“It was so so so sooo good pops, you won’t believe my schedule! Every second friday, I don’t even have to be here until ten! And I have a bunch of classes with Ned too!”
The meeting consisted of the principal, one of the secretaries, the school counselor, his homeroom, P.E. and music teacher in addition to Peter and his fathers.
Dad Tony snuggles was great because of the hair playing, and head massage he would get, it created shivers down his back. He had a spot in his fathers side that felt like it had always stayed the same, even though it had changed as he grew from toddler size to small-teenager-size.
”Not on a school night, no. Your uncles are sleeping over so I can ride with Bucky in the morning.” Steve reasoned. A sleepover on a school night was boring, though. Never any fun. ”But dad, if I have the day off tomorrow and Sam is too, then we can stay up longer!” He turned to the other father, often much more open for Peter’s logic.
Peter was right, it wouldn’t be a problem. If the Stark-Rogers family called and wanted a table, they most definitely would get a table wherever they wanted. Steve wasn’t as comfortable with those scenarios as Tony seemed to be. His husband had grown up in the world they lived in, and every aspect of it was natural to him. Steve couldn’t help but despise some of the values their community carried with them. Values that led them to be okay with sneaking in line, simply because they had more money than others.
Steve manhandled Tony so he was straddling his thighs, and grabbed his chin so he could look Tony in the eyes. “Hey. I love you with all of my heart. I love you so much it hurts sometimes. Sometimes, when I drive to work, a song will come on that we’ve danced to, or you’ve sung loudly to somewhere, or one that just reminds me of you. And I’ll get this kind of… Pinch, in my heart. For several years I thought I had some kind of heart problem, but I never checked it out because it would just be once in a while, and gone as quick as it came,”
”What about this, Squirt? Think he’ll like a new running outfit?” his father interrupted his grudgeful thoughts. ”I don’t know and I don’t care, dad. Can I pleeeease go home now? I’ve finished up all my presents, I should be socialising with people my own age, not helping you with problems that you’ve caused to yourself!” Peter practically whined, resting his head against the back of  his dads shoulder. Detention was exhausting, and Peter hadn’t gotten the best week of sleep. He thought he was coming down with a cold, but didn’t want to say anything before he had to. His fathers always made such a fuss of him when sick, and it wasn’t like he disliked being babied for a few days once in a while, no he loved that. But he wouldn’t get to go to the movies if they knew about his slight headache and tingly throat, so he kept that on the down low.
Considering what they knew, no one was surprised when Peter was already out on the landing balcony as they arrived. His cheeks had tear streaks and his eyes were red, and his face was the embodiment of worry. At the same time, though, one could easily see there was so much energy inside the teen’s body. He was literally jumping up and down, Happy standing behind Peter trying to ground him. ”Papa! Papa, are you all right?” Peter shouted. They were fifty feet away from the balcony, but could already hear him. ”Looks like you’re gonna have a koala on you for the rest of the day, hon” Tony said right before they landed.
“No way! That’s exciting, Pete,” he started, buckling into the car. “Now, I spoke to dad and he suggested you can choose dinner tonight. So firstly, do we eat in or out?”
As they got into the garage, Steve was just getting out of his car. Peter went over to him as Sam backed out right away. Cause apparently, he was already a couple of minutes late to pick up his and Bucky’s takeout.
”Sorry Peter, we’re sending out a message in the morning. Doesn’t matter if the roads are better by the afternoon, we won’t have time to set it up. We were supposed to start today, so it’ll be postponed at least a week.”
But there was something for Peter, about being in such a lab, the entire floor dedicated to that small object, getting to work on it, look at it, be a part of such a process… ”I don’t know dad, it’s cool.”
Steve was stressing. It wasn’t the kind of stress that would go away by taking a bath or spending a night on the couch. It wasn’t the kind of stress that could go away with being productive and getting stuff done either. It was the stress that Steve saw no solution to and it worried him.
”Hey buddy, want to help me set the table or papa making the salad?” Tony asked as their son stood in the doorway. Peter sighed, but not loud enough for Steve to hear. Steve had always been eager for Peter to help out around the apartment, and was super sensitive to Peter complaining. Tony smiled at his son, putting an arm around his shoulders. Peter leaned into it while they made their way to the dining room. ”Come on, Papa started in here earlier. Right, we need a serving spoon. Go get one from the kitchen, will you?”
“Yeah, definitely. Smells like a mixture of sick and teenager in there, I'll suffocate if I have to sleep in it.”
“Hey T? Do you think we should do that vacation sooner than easter? I was just thinking we could all need a bit of relaxation. Think about it babe, it’s the last term where he’s not in high school. We can’t take him out of school anymore when he starts there!”
It was a good morning for Tony. No, Scratch that. It was a great morning. Over Christmas break there had been one thing he and Steve was deprived of, and that was sex. Not that they thought of it in the moment, but everything was about Peter in that timespan. Again, totally fine, as it should be, but Tony was missing his boyfriend. His boyfriend, husband, best friend, co-father, roommate, his Steve.
”Yeah. I didn’t think about looking around cause it hasn’t been so bad lately, I haven’t really needed to actively remind myself of that stuff. So I forgot about the cars.”
They relaxed in eachothers touch, both because they were tired and had missed each other that night.
Peter cast a glance back towards his fathers before staring at the ceiling. Steve had his hand on Tony’s arm by then, and Tony was looking back at his husband with a look that somehow said ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘it’s okay’ at the same time. He considered his work done there, so he started the tale of how his first day of high school had gone.
”So Peter, you wanna go get that game you were talking about and then go to our place? I was thinking, if you keep this quiet around your dads you could keep it at ours and play when you come over,” Sam suggested. On thursday when they’d picked Peter up from school he’d rambled on about this game that ned had gotten that was ”so awesome, it’s super realistic and awesome and- and the storyline is awesome!”
“You know we don’t do that, Peter. If you’d like, I can call to book for this weekend, if they’ve got something free. Or, you know, if they’ve got space tonight we’ll go tonight.”
”Thought about lasagna the whole gym session. Will you grab garlic bread from the freezer and preheat the oven?” Tony was tying his apron and looking around the kitchen. With Peter gone the entire previous evening, they had used their date night to pre- make some food, including Tony’s home made garlic bread and pasta sauces. It had been a great evening after Rhodey had called Steve and relaxed them.
The workout was long although not intense, but Tony enjoyed not feeling as overwhelmed by the emptiness of the penthouse. He wanted to go to the hospital right away, but had decided not to break visiting hours, so he had to wait until it was past eleven to leave. The pediatrics ward had been quiet throughout the weekend and the nurses had told them to come and go as they wanted, but he knew the set hours were there for a reason. He had stayed later than usual the previous night, and was honestly hoping that Steve and Peter were still sleeping.
”Wait. Tomorrow’s friday, right? What will happen to the prom? Papa, please tell me that’s still on?” Peter turned back, inching subcounciously closer to Steve, who he was already almost on top of. It was a thing when he wanted something, knowing they were all easily influenced by touch.
”Pete, can you explain what was going through you head when you were running towards the road?” Steve asked gently. They were sat at the kitchen table, and Peter was thoughtful. Both fathers were too nice about this. Tony wasn’t pacing on the floor and steve’s jaw wasn’t as tight. Pete looked down at the table and crossed his arms. He knew what the answer was, and it scared him. What if Klaus hadn’t been there, where would they be then?
Peter was so bored. So so so so so bored. Almost an hour had passed since he last spoke with his dad, papa should be home by now. He took up his phone and posted a couple of instagram stories about being stuck with homework on a snow day. Then he called Steve.
”Yeah, I thought the same thing. You heard him about how ’it’ doesn’t work. I think what happened today scared him, made him frustrated with himself, diagnosis included.” Steve reasoned. They heard footsteps in the stairs, and grew quiet. They knew Peter hated it when they talked about him. It was no secret that they did it anyway, but still tried to avoid annoying him.
Tony looked thoughtful. He wasn’t a big fan of making Peter miss out on routine and schoolwork. But Peter was smart enough to catch up even before they left, and the school was pretty lenient.
”What do you think about what I said during dinner, bud? Thoughts?” Steve said, nudging the feet on his lap.
”Okay Pete, lie here. I’m going to take your temperature real quick, and then call dr. Green. Okay? Okay, great.”
”Steven Grant Stark-Rogers. Love of my life. You wonderful, intellectual, stupid piece of hot idiot. You were going to
I appreciate kudos and comments if you liked it, and I'm also available to talk on my tumblr at the username "lerums".
The two others just nodded and gave him a little grunt, busy with their devices. Nope, that’s not the goodbye he was getting. Steve snatched the starkpad from Tony’s hands and the phone from Peter’s.
Steve thought about it for a minute. About how his son didn’t deserve this kind of struggle. About how he would take all of Peter’s struggles multiplied with ten, if it meant that his son would be relieved of them. About how kind Peter was. And respectful. And caring. And goofy, stylish, brave. His Peter. Steve teared up at his own almost poetic thoughts.
After Steve had hung up with Rhodey, he returned to the living room. ”Babe, we’ve got to take this down. Change of plans.”
”No can do, bud. It’s friday, so you’ll have doctor Pont at nine tomorrow, we’re not cancelling. You’ll manage to walk one block when Sam’s with you.” Tony argued back, smiling regretfully at him.
Peter started brushing his teeth, but he could hear his father on the outside. ”I’m not saying you need to do anything now, Pete, but if you’re under the weather I’m not sure I want you going to the appointment tomorrow. A public office and the cold weather? Don’t think so. You know what, I just made up my mind. You and Sam will have to do with penthouse activities tomorrow.” Then there was nothing, and then there were footsteps coming to the room.
He rolled his eyes and turned around. The pouty face returned, but his dad was so terrible at this. They would be there all night if Peter didn’t take action. ”Dad, what does pops like to do? He likes his non-fiction books, right? And he’s artistic. When working, he’s in some type of gear but he always brings his wallet, mainly because of the family pictures he has there. And when he doesn’t work, he literally has three outfits that he switches between, always. So I propose you get some of those family pictures from last week printed and put into a new wallet, buy him a casual but christmassy outfit for the holidays and also a couple of books about something he likes. Stop making this thing so damn hard for yourself, and take me home please!” Peter ranted, while he dragged his dad into a clothes store and picked out some of the pants he knew his papa always wore.
Miss Romanov is the only one among them who can get away with walking in the front door of a mob operation without risking a chest full of lead.  While she distracts the boys in the front, Steve and Stark will sneak in through the back entrance, Barton will climb the fire escape, and Banner and Odinson will wait for Barton’s all clear to go in the side door.  Banner says the laboratories of these set-ups are usually on the ground floor - the scientists are smart enough to like the idea of an easy escape - and with any luck, they’ll be in and out in ten minutes with an armful of whatever records they can find and a blueprint of the place to hand over to the feds.
.  They were sixteen, maybe a tall fifteen in a few cases, and while Tony was relieved they’d all taken it in stride when he’d told them they were actually adults and, oh yeah,
New Yorker,” Clint said, shoving his bag into Tony’s hands and following Steve.  “He wants to wait for his
“Most days, I think,” Steve says.  “After Germany, Nat said you were training a sidekick, but what you actually wanted was a protege.  Seems like she was right.”
Steve doesn’t give himself time to think about it: he presses his lips to Stark’s and they stumble backward.  The door opens under Stark’s hands and Steve barely notices the room they fumble their way into, and then Stark is pushing at his jacket, yanking at the sleeves.
But Tony looked thrilled.  “Yes, I did.  I did!  You can feel me.  You can see me, you can hear me, and now you can feel me, this is huge, this is - ”
And with a self-satisfied grin, Steve got off Santa’s lap and headed back to the table in the corner to hand out more turkey.
“Ooh, you’re in trouble,” Peter teases.  Tony arches an eyebrow as the rest of the team filters out.  Is Steve actually about to
Steve doesn’t so much as blink.  “Got curious, sir.  Zemo’s smaller time than the other two, but he’s ambitious.  Thought there might be a roadmap to what he’ll be trying to - ”
“I’m mighty glad to hear that, son,” Pierce says.  “I’ll look forward to your next debriefing on the progress you’ve made with Zemo, and I won’t expect to hear any more about you stepping on any toes.”  He smiles patiently, like Steve’s a schoolboy who’s just completed a hard sum.
“Right,” Steve says.  He adjusts his trousers carefully and glances back into the room to see that Jarvis has gone.  “Well, I’d better go.”
A few years after Steve moved permanently back in time, he started having conversations with Tony again.
The house is huge, three stories of brightly-lit windows and fancy brickwork and climbing vines.  The lawn’s covered in cars, and there’s a band playing somewhere; by the buzz in the air, Steve would guess that a fair number of people have been enjoying the libations for some time already.
Tony climbed the stairs slowly.  If Tony was a little less drunk, or maybe a little less fucked up about what the Maximoff girl had shown him, or maybe just a better guy all around, he would’ve kept looking straight ahead, said goodnight, and walked down the hall to his guest suite all alone.
“I mean, it’s maybe a thing,” Tony says.  “Like a two-way thing.  Possibly.  I think probably, actually.”
“That’s okay,” Steve says over his shoulder as he heads down the driveway.  “I could use the time to think.”
“Pancakes it is,” Tony says.  “Can Daddy have five more minutes?  You can have Friday set an alarm.”
For the first time, Barnes looks up and meets Tony’s eyes, and it takes Tony a second to recognize it but he looks - he looks  like he’s in pain.  “Right.  I - forget that, sometimes.”
for this to mean something.”  Tony looks away, out at the blackness, and then back at Steve, and when he does his eyes are fiery and his jaw is set. “But you know what?  After the last few weeks, I think I’m actually more scared that it doesn’t.  I’m more scared that you disappear at any moment and not even want to tell me why.”
“Fucky you too, Barton,” Bucky said with a smile while Steve just frowned and looked up at the ceiling.
It seemed that no matter what he said, Tony would give him this odd look - it was a mix between pensive and constipated. Not a good look for him necessarily, but nobody’s perfect.
“First of all, don’t call it wooing,” Clint said before grabbing the coffee carafe but skipping the mug entirely.
“They are fucking beautiful Stark,” Clint said over the coms, taking pity on their Captain. “Be a good boy and say thank you for such a thoughtful gift Steve.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Steve said, hoping the warmth he felt on his face wasn’t actually visible. Damn his Irish complexion, and damn Tony’s ass.
Steve felt his face heat up and grabbed his neck with his left hand in embarrassment. “I thought so,” Steve answered trying to figure out where he’d gone wrong. “Look, it doesn’t have to mean anything if you don’t want it to. You can still come to the exhibit as a friend - I get it.”
“I don’t know what to do with that information,” Tony said honestly while trying hard not to get lost in the demon’s eyes. The
“I am serious about him. I just want to make him happy,” Steve said. He thought the conversation was going well, it sounded like there were no objections from James at least. And since he was Tony’s best friend, Steve decided to just ask. “How do I make him see that?”
There were movie nights, brunches, afternoon walks in the park, and slowly the research became less and less important until one day Steve asked Bucky, “Do you even
She said that it had been owned by the same witch for centuries. Tony was a little skeptical (“Centuries, Nat? Really?”) but off he went anyway.
A few days ago, Tony had shown up late for movie night, half asleep with a screwdriver in his hand. He walked straight to his and Steve’s couch and had seemed confused at finding Bucky sitting in his regular spot.
Steve watched Tony walk to the elevator from the landing pad, holding the roses close to his chest, and with a thoughtful look on his face.
“I swear to Thor if you ask me if I have a concussion, I’ll scream,” Steve interrupted Tony before he had a chance to finish his sentence. “I think I love you Tony and it’s ok if you don’t feel the same. All I ask is that we see if we can make this work.”
“Cap, you have that face again,” Clint brought him out of his thoughts. “That face that says you’re thinking about how you’d like to bend Tony over the table and make him call you daddy..”
The ceremony was officiated by Coulson because there was no way Clint would officiate another wedding after the disaster (or epicness depending on who was talking) that was the Potts/Hogan wedding.
“Well, I intend to leave you for a younger, richer, and smarter man if a demon actually appears tonight.”
Tony looked taken aback, but smiled pleasantly. “I have a meeting with R&D in a few minutes, but I’ll be done by 2, if you want to meet me down there.”
“We need to talk,” Tony said one day, Steve next to him turning different shades of red. “Bucky, we care, maybe even more than care, about you and we feel like there’s more to this friendship. We’d like to date you.”
“Captain, I’m worried about you,” Tony said as his suit rose from the ground to provide air support. “Roses Steve? Really?”
When they were leaving, James extended his hand to Steve and pulled him close. It looked as if he’d give Steve a hug at first, but once he had Steve close enough, James looked into his eyes and whispered seriously, “Remember that I know a lot of people, Captain. I can make anyone disappear, even a national icon.” He smiled at Steve and continued in a more normal tone of voice, “It was a pleasure seeing you today Steve. Do let me know how everything goes.”
“Yes, I’m destroying them look, see? I punched one, but I can still ask. Who stops for flowers on their way to a fight? I mean, thank you and all, but aren’t you the one always talking about priorities?”
Shield in one hand, flowers in the other, he disabled bots left and right with well aimed kicks, shield hits and at some point even a head butt. He’d pay for that one later, he knew.
“Thanks Steve, you’re my hero,” Tony smiled at Steve, and it was the small smile he only gave them when he was at home. It was a little crooked, and it made the dimple on his left cheek stand out more.
Steve placed his hands on Tony’s hips, bringing their foreheads together and trying to memorize every detail of that moment. The smell of the rose still in one of Tony’s hands; the taste of Tony’s lips on his, a mixture of the chocolate shake he’d drank and coconut; the sound of the voices around them; the feel of Tony’s hands still around him. Steve cupped Tony’s face in his hands and kissed Tony on the corner of his mouth, the tip of his nose, each cheek, and finally his lips.
Steve was sure that if it wasn’t for the serum, he’d be sweating buckets right now. He had never felt this nervous before and wasn’t sure if James was messing with him or not.
He took a deep breath and reached over Tony to hand him his mug. “I’m not wooing anyone and Clint is asking for extra training time.”
It was now or never. “Are you busy right now Tony? We could go out to lunch?” He asked Tony out. He asked Tony out. He did it.
He was as tall as Steve, brunette, with deep icy blue eyes with a red rim around the irises. He took a deep breath and was about to say something but was interrupted by Tony.
“Not a lady, why Steve, you’ve been holding out on me,” Tony sat down across from Steve and leaned his elbows on the table, cradling the cup of coffee in his hands.
Either way, Clint figured he should start getting his material ready. And after a couple of hours of snooping, he found the best thing he never knew he needed.
“What kind of name is Bucky?” He asked, and received an elbow to the ribs from Steve and a flat look from Bucky.
There was some small talk about the last battle War Machine had joined them on while they waited for their coffee orders. They also talked about having a training exercise with Iron Man and War Machine grounded.
“I didn’t think we needed to explain anything,” Tony said and knew immediately that it was the wrong thing to say based on Steve’s pinched look. “I mean, I thought you were my boyfriend?” he added and made it into a question in case he had misunderstood.
They spoke of Tony’s new StarkPhone and the upgrades he was making to JARVIS’ code. Steve told him how his art classes were going. This was good; this was a good first date and Steve felt confident that a second one was on the horizon.
When it was obvious that Steve had moved into Tony’s place (even if the pair of idiots hadn’t realized it yet), Clint dropped from one of the vents into Steve’s apartment in the tower. He thought it was only a matter of time before he’d be called on to officiate the wedding (he was already ordained in New York, Vermont and just in case California), or to make the best man speech (he’d fight Bucky tooth and nail for it).
Except, it wasn’t easy and he couldn’t do it. He tried but based on the look Tony gave him when he told DUM-E he was as smart as his dad... well, Steve might need help with that.
“It seems Doctor Doom has unleashed a new version of his bots. They are currently attacking the Baxter Building but Dr Richards and his team are out of the country.”
There was also a picture taken from a CCTV camera during a fight. It was Captain America jumping over a car, a bouquet of roses on fire held in one hand.
That’s when shit hit the fan. They both heard a rushing sound, and felt like the air was being sucked out of the room. They closed their eyes when it seemed like things were about to start spinning and when they opened them again, there was a man standing in the middle of their living room.
What did the winky face mean? He could do flirty texts. He could be suggestive in a subtle way. Right? But he did not know what would be a flirty reply to a winky face.
ceremonial knife and adding a drop of his blood to the box. He then buried it in the planter he bought specifically for the occasion and waited.
“I’m five minutes away. What’s your location Iron Man?” Steve asked and Tony sent him the coordinates  - why couldn’t the man use cross streets or building names? “Team check-in!” He ordered over the comms and after receiving notifications that they had things in hand, he headed towards Tony.
James just sat there with a look of pleasant surprise on his face, which quickly changed into something darker. “And what makes you think you are good enough for Tony? Didn’t you tell him he better stop pretending to be a hero once, that you knew men worth ten of him? And now what? You want to date him?”
Alright, this one was easy. There was no way Steve could mess this one up. He could get Tony flowers. Roses! Roses meant love; it was decided, Steve would go out and buy him some roses. A dozen beautiful red roses.
That was actually good advice. Not the ass part, even though it was a nice one. Maybe the battles should be kept strictly professional. He’d keep the compliments outside the workshop and outside battles - which left the common area as a safe place for it.
“You both are terrible as best friends,” Steve said while getting up from the table, glaring at the ceiling and at Bucky.
“Yes, he does. And I’ve tried showing him I’m interested but it doesn’t seem to work. I don’t know what else to do.”
Bucky looked at them like they had suddenly sprouted second heads. “I thought we already were?” he said.
James for his part, took out his phone and began looking through it. “Well, I’d hope you want more than that. According to Clint,” he appeared to be reading something off his phone as he continued, “you have printed out documents to officially adopt the bots and JARVIS already. I have to tell you though,” James continued. “If you really want to date him, you need to talk to him not to me. You’re a good man, Steve and Tony deserves a good person.”
Clint wanted to know how Bucky was summoned. He was the only one of their friends that seemed to take Bucky’s answer at face value. But it was Clint, so none of them knew if he actually believed it or if he was just being Clint.
“Wooing? Really, Cap?” Tony was now on his tip toes trying to reach his mug, which he found on the top shelf of a cabinet. Going by Clint’s shit eating grin, Steve could tell it had been placed there by him. “I could show you a thing or two.”
“Demons. Have you not been paying attention when I’m watching my shows?” If Tony was honest, he tended to tune out the ghost hunting shows that Steve loved to watch. They all just seemed so intent on proving there was something, and never really seemed serious about trying to disprove any of the supernatural claims.
“I know that. And we have gotten closer together since then. I’d like to say he’s one of my best friends and I think I am one of his too. But --”
He was running towards the action when Tony asked if he was already on the comms. Responding in the affirmative, he pushed himself to run faster.
Not only that, but somehow, Clint made sure that Tony and Steve always ended up on the same loveseat. Steve was beginning to think Clint might be paying him back for all the extra training.
There was a laughter from the vents above them. “You are as subtle as Sam’s crush on Bucky,” Clint said.
It all started the previous October when Tony and Steve were planning their first Halloween party together. They had been officially dating for two months after Steve decided they needed to have the DTR talk. They had been going out and having fun for a few months, but never got around to the conversation and Steve was honestly tired of trying to figure it out.
“You too, Tony,” Steve said, getting up and giving him a hug. Tony seemed surprised but not completely unhappy about the situation.
Steve sighed and gave Bucky his Look of Disappointment, even if he knew Bucky’d grown resistant to it back in the 30s. “I’m not showing up at the workshop wearing nothing but a bow.”
Tony, Bucky and Steve went back to Enchanted Chaos to find a book that would tell them how to return Bucky to hell. Bucky told them he could just die again, but Steve flat out refused to kill or let die anything that lived and breathed.
That’s how Steve and Tony found out about the demon classes, and the demon tests, and the demon professors,and the demon finals that Bucky had failed three times already (which was NOT how they pictured hell).
“Oh for fucks sake Stark, just take the god damn compliment,” Steve huffed and walked out of the room, leaving behind a confused Tony.
“Spit it out, Steve. You look like you’re about to have a heart attack,” James said once it was obvious Steve would not be saying what he came to say any time soon.
It seemed that no more magazines or google searches would be needed. To quote Bucky, he’d just have to show moxie and take the plunge. He’d have to create a good plan for it. Steve needed everything to be clear to Tony. No backpedaling this time.
“Are those roses on fire?” Tony asked, and yes they were because the universe really, truly hated him.
Steve and Bucky spent evenings cooking and prying Tony away from work and his research to spend some time together. And since they didn’t know how long their Cambion friend would stay, they also took him around New York - to touristy places, and to his old neighborhood to find if he could remember more of his human life.
At two on the dot, Steve was waiting for Tony in the lobby area of the R&D department. He had taken great care to look good for Tony; he’d even left the khakis at home and had worn a pair of designer jeans that Bucky said made his ass look like America’s Ass. Since they’d be walking to the burger joint, he was also wearing his Chucks and a leather jacket over his white t-shirt (no button up, per Sam’s advice).
finding the whole thing exciting though. He meant to prove that there were no such things as demons and yet, here was proof that there was something
“Say I was right, Steve,” Tony said. “Say it and I won’t rub it in your face later,” he added, ignoring Steve’s disbelieving look.
"Wha–" he starts to say, but she follows it up with a roundhouse, and Steve barely dives forward in time to block it, grabbing her leg and sending her crashing into Sam's coffee table. "What the hell, Hill?" Tony asks, wiping at his chin, his lip split and bleeding.
"You may have my blade," Fandral offers graciously, handing off a sword that nearly reaches Tony's shoulder, thin and sharp. Tony's arm flexes just holding it at his side. "Hogun favors headlong attacks, he hits like a gladiator, and he feels very little pain until after battle–"
Arm bent over his face, Tony nods, lying on his back and near asleep enough to assume Steve requires a response.
"Twelve in a boy's boarding school," Tony says, and takes Steve back into his mouth, back into that wet, fantastic warmth, swallowing practically all of him, and Steve has no idea how he manages to take it so -- so deep without choking, without his teeth scratching, even a little.  The inch or so he can't manage, his hand comes up and grips firmly, his second one fondling Steve's balls, and he's coming with a loud moan, hands holding tight to dark, thick hair.
Steve turns back to the mess of arguing, splintered heroes and villains. This is chaos. Steve grips his shield, "Avengers!"
Tony blinks, then leans close to look at the serial code running along the side. "That – well, did, yes. Thank you."
They hadn't expected an entire army of inept bigots. This is bad. SHIELD's descended below having information leaked; the black hats are out- maneuvering them.
"It's almost four in the morning, Maria," Tony says. "How did you even find us?" And then she punches him in the face.
"Yes it is." Steve doesn't bother undressing him except for his shoes, and Tony battles the sheets on his own, admirably. They end up half wrapped around his body, and he seems content with that.
"You're – you said that you've felt alone, lately. You know that I'm not Sam or Bucky or Sharon–" Tony stops at Steve's expression.
Tony moans the moment he gets it in his mouth, deep and appreciative. Steve is fully erect almost immediately. "Tony . . . you're amazing," he breathes, sincerely.  Tony
Tony's hands find the back of Steve's neck, nails digging into the flesh that's exposed in this uniform, rocking in time as much as he can with so little leverage.  Steve takes the hand he's been using to prop Tony's hip and brings it to his chin, forcing it back down, and smothers the steady stream of moans and gasps and wails with a kiss, claiming his mouth.  He thrusts his tongue in the same time grips particularly hard on Tony's cock, shoves in like an assault.  Tony comes.
"You alright?" Steve asks. He'd instinctively stopped the roll with himself on top, shielding Tony's body from the potential explosion.
Very aware of what this is, what he's doing, and how rash it is, how idiotic, Steve opens his mouth, deepening the kiss. Wrapping his free arm around Tony's waist, pulling him away from the wall, against him. Warmth, Steve's missed this, deeply, comfort and Tony; he groans, suddenly realizing what he thought was a mild hunger was near starvation, finding it difficult to pull away, even for air.
Steve is too tense for honest sleep; he closes his eyes and falls into a sort of in-between doze, the bedroom around him blurring to an obscure shape, but never fully fading. It's not terribly restful, but it's saved his life on more than one occasion, and he's learned not to fight it when his nerves are too keyed up for anything deeper.
Even with his enhanced reflexes, Steve can't follow the majority of the battle. He could hear it, certainly, smashes of metal on metal, but except for moments of stillness– Hogun is slammed into the air, smashing into the ground - they just move too fast to see.
"You're gonna need those numbers, Rogers." It's Castle, speaking quiet and calm to his left. "She's just gonna slip away again. Another family is gonna die."
Steve finds Tony attractive; Tony's an attractive person. He's been able to appreciate it for years, but as with several teammates he's found appealing over the years – he rubs shoulders daily with a lot of healthy, fit people – it's never been appropriate to act on, and he's never dwelled seriously.
His exes also seem to have a troubling habit of ending up insane. As much as Clint likes to joke that it's an inevitable reaction, Steve's sure they start out that way; there's just something about that that seems to attract Tony. It's a subject Steve's wanted to broach with Tony a few times, but is at direct odds with respecting his privacy and decisions.
Steve's quiet, watching Tony closely. He used to think he could read him; now he's not so sure. "You couldn't override it, or wouldn't?"
A second team of misfits Steve's never seen before in his life appears; mostly teenagers with street clothes.
Hogun surges forward, pick raised. He's turned it blunt end forward, and Steve realizes he's going to hit Tony with the flat side, send him tumbling across the field–
And he does. Grabbing a duffel bag and forgoing his own car for one of SHIELD's, he's a speck against the sky seconds later.
Sam lives on the top floor, which is always so convenient when jumping from rooftop to rooftop, but now means Steve can feel Tony's gaze hot on his neck for three flights of stairs. "Yeah?" Steve asks.
"This all could've been taken care of months ago if Tony had come here to begin with," Reed continues easily. "It's not Osborn, or anyone else, which is why Tony didn't wake up after I blocked all signals. The orders are coming from Tony's mind. It's Tony. It's Extremis," Reed says. "Simply put, Extremis is a kind of computer program, and Tony is a computer–"
"I'll just . . ." Jack trails off awkwardly under their combined, surprised stare, hands up as he escapes down the hall.
"We came as soon as Vision told us about it!" Hulkling protests in a grunt, struggling to maintain the chokehold he has.
"So, how does this go?" he asks, pushing off Tony's desk, slowly cornering the other man against the door.  "Did I say anything in particular? Do I sweep you off your feet?"
"The Iron Man that fought beside a god? You kept pace with Thor?" says the blond, and Steve realizes, really, it's only the one in pink dressed ridiculously, there was just so much of him, he was all Steve could really process. Now that he steps forward, arms spread, the other two's darker, plainer outfits come into focus. Still old-fashioned cuts and boots, but much more practical – warrior's gear
All the models of the armor Tony had made up to that point had capitalized on connections, being able to access information from any point, relying as little as possible on outside hosts. The systems were so worlds away from everything else operating, he hadn't had to worry about someone finding holes. You don't put a barbed wire fence on the balcony of a seventeen story high rise.
Three blocks away, and Tony is still more dazed than not, blinking slowly in the passenger's side, watching Steve curiously as he makes it back to the car. "Where'd you go?" he asks.
"Peter got me hooked on this," Tony says the name with forced nonchalance, then finally takes the first bite of his burger, as Steve takes the last of his. The fact that Peter will probably never speak to Tony again is uncomfortably loud in the silence.
"Tony is Extremis. Maybe one day there will be technology that will allow us to go down to a microscopic level and rip apart cells that make up a living being without destroying it, but you won't find it in the Fantasti-lab, today," he says. Then stops. Considers. " . . . Although . . ."
So it's Tony he watches for references in the hair and expression, it's that smile he tries to emulate; when his eyes narrow with pleasure, mouth slowly curling upward, almost mischievous, head slightly ducked.
Not going to make it, no time to move, no room, Steve braces himself in front of the kids, probably a useless effort, the flaming heat is bound to reach them, but he's seen bigger miracles happen – he grits his teeth –
It probably wasn’t the best kiss, what with both of them smiling, it was more teeth than lips, but it was perfect. It was everything Steve had hoped for and more.
The night of the summoning came and Tony found himself holding a box of graveyard dirt, and a stuffed black cat. “It's the spirit of the intention, Steve, not the letter of the law... I'm not going to hurt a cat just to prove demons don't exist,” he explained.
“Isn’t he?” Clint asked, and when the hell did he get up on the fridge? Steve wished Bruce’s special calming tea would work on him. He needed something to slow down his heart; maybe he should still try it, or maybe Bruce would be willing to share his brownies.
“We’ll have a Student Art Exhibit and I’d love for you to come,” Steve said as they walked towards a small park that was nearby. “Nat, Buck and Sam are coming too,” he added to let Tony know he wouldn’t be there alone while Steve made the expected rounds during the exhibit.
As they approached the park, Steve saw a flower vendor and pulled Tony by the hand towards her. “Can I have a red rose, please?” Steve let go of Tony’s hand to grab his wallet and pay for the rose.
”Hello, you’ve reached Lennox Hill Hospital, how may I help you?” Tony mocked the answering lady, getting a smile from Peter.
Tony looked helplessly at Peter walking out of the kitchen, the boy’s fingers switching between clenching around nothing and tapping harshly at his own thighs. Then he looked at Steve beside him, who started off with the same expression, but now looked like he had an idea. They rose, and Tony followed his husband, counting on Steve to have a plan.
Tony could see Peter thinking about that. Every time he mentioned saving the planet, Peter would mention iron man. ”Yeah, I know, iron man and all that. But this is a much more peaceful and, honestly, stimulating way to do so, don’t you think? A lot less violent and dangerous.”
As Steve hung with his head he realized he wasn’t able to hide anything of importance to his husband anymore, and would have to spill.
“Please. Let me look up something tomorrow and you can look at it when you get home tomorrow night. I’d say we should leave in a couple of weeks, maybe three. What do you say, can I toss a couple of proposals your way?”
Steve bent down to kiss his son’s cheek, and Peter let out a sleepy giggle when Tony pecked his nose at the same time. They were still getting used to Peter actually being sleepy before falling asleep. It had been just over a week since he started his medication and just a few days since deciding on the best one. So far, they were loving it. Turns out Peter was as cuddly as ever, and always in a good mood when he was half asleep.
. My fantasy started wandering. Like some bachelor-ish activity where we would mingle and eventually decide for a lady most suited. Then give her pacifier at the pacifier-ceremony, and she would start mothering our son, who she wouldn’t even know, and she would be horrible cause the ladies you picked are all boring and busy and not at all suited to match Pete’s personality, ” Tony explained, grinning from ear to ear at his elaborate fantasy.
At lunch, Tony decided they’d go to the cafeteria. Tony didn’t love the space, he was in the process of redoing it, so he usually went to the penthouse to grab some lunch if he had time for more than a coffee. The main reason, though, was the stares he received when he was there. Sure, he knew some of the department heads here and there, and he worked closely with a lot of the engineers, but to everyone in the room, he would always be the boss’ boss. It wouldn’t get any worse while bringing his kid along, they’d receive even more stares, but for some weird reason, Peter loved the cafeteria.
”Hey boys, I come bearing stuff!” Steve exclaimed, and placed the bad on the bed. ”Blanket for Peter, there you go. Warm socks for both of you, and tablets, you’re welcome. Glasses for my love. Hi, honey.” Steve was over by Tony now, hoisting him up. Tony’s back creaked. Yeah, Steve knew a hunched over back when he saw one. Steve put the glasses on Tony’s nose, and kissed him. Light, quick. ”Welcome home, dearest” Tony whispered.
Steve didn’t know what just happened. Peter had just ”teenagered” completely at him (tony’s word). It was a rare occurrence, but it happened every few weeks. This time, in front of a meeting about a training mission. Steve had loaned out his office that day because it had the biggest conference table. ”Uhh… Teenagers, am I right?” Steve said gingerly after Peter practically ran out. The people having the meeting were either smiling amusedly, or looking completely gobsmacked. Later, when Steve thought about it, the people who smiled had teenagers of their own. The rest didn’t. So Steve left to find peter.
He jumped onto the bed, messing up pillows and blankets in the process. “I’m thinking maybe Rosemary’s tonight? The steakhouse? I’m feeling a proper celebratory steak, what do you guys think?”
”Ready to explain what you’re thinking yet, Pete?” Tony said through a bite of lasagna, accidentally spitting sauce on Steve’s hand. Peter giggled lightly as Steve slowly wiped it off with a napkin, eyebrows raised, giving Tony a death glare. It was light, though. Steve knew he had done it on purpose, to lighten the mood. They had been eating in near silence so far.
” Peter stood up from his chair and walked out of the kitchen, needing a way to let out his excess energy.
Peter was awake, but felt like he was in a different reality. He could barely keep his eyes open, everything hurt slightly, and he couldn’t even be bothered to shift into a comfortable position. Papa was always in the room, usually sitting in the chair by his bed but occasionally stretching his legs by walking around the room. Thankfully, he left Peter mostly alone besides caressing his cheek from time to time.
Tony put his hand on Peter’s. ”It’s all right, Pete. Papa and I was distracted too, we usually help you remember but we were talking to John. We should probably have parked on the other side in the first place.”
The conference call was over, and Peter slumped over to lean on his fathers shoulder. ”That was kinda boring, dad. I mean, it was fine, but it would have been better if those guys understood what they were talking about! I almost laughed when you had to explain osmosis to them.”
Steve didn’t pick up. Dad had said he would be home thirty minutes ago, what was keeping him? ”FRIDAY, patch me through to dad again, will you?”
”It’s why I’m here. Remember, don’t hesitate with bringing him to the ER. They know him at your hospital, they’ll take care of you. Either way, he will turn out fine in the end. And if you remember, give me a call Monday morning and update me, will you?”
”Great, I think you’re going to like this. FRIDAY, patch us through to the chat.” They were still outside the office door. ”You’re in, boss.” came from the roof.
Steve thought about it for a second. They had prepared a bowl of popcorn and a blanket fort for when Peter got home so they could talk about it all. Maybe that wasn’t the best solution this time? ”Yeah, sure he can stay. He’s coming home tomorrow, though?” Steve heard Rhodey huff a laugh. ”Yeah Steve, you’ll get him back after school tomorrow, don’t worry.”
James Rhodes was in the pickup lane outside Midtown middle school. It was tuesday, and tuesdays was pick up Peter from school days. It took a while, but eventually Peter came sneaking out the door. He hurried over to Rhodey’s car, sneaking between all the other kids hanging around the school yard. He always found it slightly amusing to watch Peter with other kids because of his size. While Peter was fourteen, actually a year older than the oldest people on his school, he would probably pass as eleven to people who didn’t know him.
Peter didn’t feel his eyes and head hurting as much, so he asked for his phone and starkpad. He had some serious social media time to catch up on, so he settled with some old episodes of his favourite show on the pad while scrolling, liking, posting and answering.
Tony was caressing Peter’s forearm that was lying on top of the covers. It was nine thirty, and Peter’s breakfast had just been taken away, untouched. The boy had woken up feeling worse again, barely bothering to talk, needing help to get to the bathroom. He was just lying there, staring at different objects around the room. Sometimes at Tony. Tony didn’t pay much attention to the numbers, but the nurses were checking his fever every hour.
”Oh.” He sat down just as the others did, and stared intensely at the food. Both Steve and Tony stared just as intensely at Peter.
”I thought all of them were choices I had? What if I want to hang out here all day, or down in the lobby?” Peter teased, his dad hated him hanging about in the lobby. Peter never knew the exact reason, but Happy had hinted that it had something to do with the weakened safety in the area.
“Hey bud, how was first day?” He wrapped an arm around Peter, who didn’t immediately sink into the hug, but didn’t pull away either.
”So's dad godda cob back tobowow?” Peter couldn’t stop himself from worrying. Tony had left while he was asleep, and wasn’t coming back until the next day? It wasn’t like him. But papa shook his head, smiling. ”No, he’s coming back later today, we’re both spending our days here now that it’s weekend” He explained. Well, that was a relief.
