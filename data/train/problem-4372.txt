“Not if I tell her you elbowed me in the mouth first.”
“Quiche.”
Sam rolled his eyes and leaned in to examine a page written in something that was definitely not English and which probably predated England as an idea by about a thousand years.
“Come on, man!” Dean shouted. “I brought you cookies!”
“What, so I’m supposed to leave you to face this on your own?” Dean asked. “There is no way in hell I’m doing that, Sammy.”
“It’s okay, Sammy,” he murmured. “I’m going to take care of you.”
“House rules,” Bobby said. “Everyone who walks through the front door gets tested for demons.”
Neither of them slept well that night, but for once it wasn’t because of Sam’s nightmares. The few hours he managed to grab were blissfully free of visions of Dean’s death. He found no vindication in the proof that it really had been a premonition, or relief in the knowledge that it had passed without being fulfilled. Old torments had been replaced by new ones.
We could really use your help. We’d owe you one, if that makes any difference.”
Sam looked away.
In Dean’s own head, the words are sour and soaked in filth. They flicker weakly into his thoughts, slipping through the safety net he carefully maintains, and he works quickly to squash them back down into silence. It’s too late. The damage is already done. He feels sick with his admission.
“He’d want to know,” he repeated.
“What is my life?” Sam asked nobody in particular, even as he looked back up.
Patience giggled and hid her face in his shoulder.
He was on the floor, playing with some stupid toy. Dean couldn't remember what now - a truck of some kind. The kid had always had a thing about trucks. Dean hadn't looked back to see what the matter was, though, just shushed him.
“No, but you’d think so based on your reaction,” Dean said.
Sam.”
He headed for the stairs leading up to the loft.
Dean watched as Sam’s eyes slid closed. The eye on his arm slid shut beneath his finger, too. A moment later, all three of his eyes opened again.
“What?” he says, taken aback.
“I know I’ve told you a lot tonight,” Missouri said, setting the tray down in front of him. “Maybe more than you wanted to hear.”
“Oh my god, we’re going to go to jail,” Sam breathed. “We’re going to jail and Missouri is going to disown us and you’re going to start drinking toilet wine. This is how it all ends. In a maximum security prison cell with a picture of Pamela Anderson taped above the sink.”
“This is no life for them,” he said. “Dean’s only four. Sam’s only a baby! I can’t take them where I’m going. It’s too dangerous.”
A few seconds and some furious rock-paper-scissoring later, Dean was standing up with a huff, flipping his copy of ‘Wandering Spirits: Chen Shiyuan’s Encyclopedia of Dreams’ shut, and pushing through the beaded curtain that separated the back room from the front counter.
She set the cup down in front of Dean. He hesitated, then tentatively reached for it with one hand.
I’m telling Missouri you bit me!”
“Okay, Dr. Phil,” he scoffed. “First of all, if either of us was going to turn into a basket case, it would be you, not me. You repress, like, everything.”
Dean reaches out, picks the book up off the floor, and snaps it shut.
“But what if I was an angel?” Dean ventures. “You just said that they find love between angels and humans shameful.”
“Let me get one thing straight,” Bobby said, reclaiming his holy water canteen. “John and I might work together, but we do not get along.”
“Hey, Dean, I just had the weirdest customer,” he called, flicking on the living room light. “She was, like, the spitting image of Tess.”
“Don't ‘Missouri’ me,” she said. “You know my rules. No magic with -”
Still numb with shock, Dean had merely nodded in obedience.
“Whatever it is, we’re sorry,” Sam tried. “If you would just explain -”
“I'll call you back when we have better service,” Dean said. “Gotta go. Bye.”
Case in point - Marlene.
“They deserve to die!” the other joins in.
Dean only shrugs.
John was still sitting hunched over on the couch, a cloud over his thoughts so dark that Missouri could practically see it with her bare eyes. He stared into the middle distance, hands clenched together over his knees. From an outsider’s perspective, he could almost be mistaken for a man deep in prayer. Missouri knew better. He was planning.
His first solo hunt. A seventeenth birthday present from Dad.
“You and me, we don’t split up,” Dean said firmly. “We don’t do anything alone. No matter how bad it gets, we’ve always got each other. That’s the way it’s always been, and that’s the way it’s always going to be. It’s gonna take a lot more than some bad dreams to scare me off.”
His dad eyes him critically for a moment, then seems to decide that ‘a little close’ is an acceptable outcome for a first hunt. He nods and lets it go.
Sam had also never known the uncertainty of that period right after their dad first left, or the hope, confusion, and disappointment that flared each time he returned. In those days, their dad had come around much more often. Every couple of months, he would appear again and take custody of his children for a few days, even if it was just to a cheap motel where John would spend long hours making phone calls and pouring over books and newspapers, scribbling in his notebook the whole time. Then some new lead would snatch him up in its jaws and Sam and Dean were back off to Missouri's again.
“Just in case of what?” Missouri asked.
“I guess,” Sam said slowly.
He reached up and wiped frantically at his face, trying to get the blood off. His hand was shaking when he looked down at it, smeared with red. His gaze fell past it, to the body.
He licked his lips nervously and refocused on Marlene.
“It’s too late for that!” Steven snapped. “Or it’s too early! It doesn’t matter. Don’t come back! Either of you! Not for anything, ever! Ever!”
Their fingers trace old, yellowing pages. Their lips, full of life, full from kissing, move in harmony as they form words their owners know by heart. They hardly need the light at all. They could say it together in the dark.
Sam raised his hand in a half-wave.
He should burn it, he knows. It’s what his dad would do. When it comes to violent hauntings, you can never be too careful. A mistake can lead to people getting hurt later on down the road, and Dean has already had that lesson drilled into his head a thousand times. Just look at what happened in Fort Douglas, what nearly happened to Sam. All because of Dean.
Sam almost laughed. Calm washed over him. Dean volunteered to go to Sam's favourite book store without complaint, so Sam caved.
'Ellen driving you?'
Dean groaned and buried his face in his hands. 'I am so sorry. I honestly did not plan that. I wasn't even going to mention it.'
“Oh fuck,” Dean gasped, overwhelmed, and felt his entire body tense. “Fuck, that's so, so fucking gross. Sam, control your dog!”
'No, they aren't. At least they're there for me.' A cold fear and a hot rage fell on Dean at once. He had never openly contradicted his father before.
Cas smirks and reaches down to undo the button on Dean's jeans. He slides his hand past Dean's waistband. Dean inhales sharply and pushes into Cas, pinning him against the wall, and kisses him hard. 'You are the best catastrophic distraction a man could hope for.'
'Sam.'
. Then she turned to Dean, who was still looking far too pleased with himself. 'How much do I owe you, Dean?'
'What's the matter with you?' she asked. Emphasis on the 'you.' She wasn't curious, just offended.
Jo shrugs. 'Probably intimidated by you. He doesn't know you sleep with a teddy bear and a nightlight.'
Dean is immediately on the alert. 'What's wrong?'
Dean tries to keep his breathing even. 'But you did run. You got away.'
Hyun-Sook beamed at them and led them through the front door. “I can already tell you two are going to like Castiel. That's the next door neighbour on that side.” She pointed in response to their questioning looks.
'We're going to grab drinks and find somewhere to stand, catch you guys after!' Sam calls, and pulls Dean to the bar. 'What are you having, Dean?'
'I think he's sweet,' Jo chimes in. 'Needs to grow a pair, but he was really nice to me when I showed him the staff room.'
Dean heard pounding footsteps as Sam and Cas crashed in through the doorway. Dean, mouth dry, gestured silently at the bear. There was a moment of silence, then Sam bent double, wheezing with laughter. He hung on to the doorframe and shook, unable to speak.
And that was how John found himself buckling a happily babbling Sammy into a booster seat while Dean bounced around Castiel from next door, telling him all about the Australian Outback exhibit and the kid's park where you could draw on the sidewalks with chalk. Castiel was listening calmly, staring at Dean with wide, trusting eyes. Castiel's father, Chuck, a thin, rumpled man in a thin, rumpled dressing gown, stood squinting at John loading the car.
'Wake up! Merry Christmas!'
'Thank you! It's so nice to finally meet you.' Sam reaches to shake Cas' hand, and Jess gives him a quick hug.
'Freaking hurts.' Jo limps back to the couch, which is draped in blankets. 'I made an appointment at the hospital tomorrow.'
'We should blow something else up soon.' Crowley tapped his foot.
'The what?'
'Dean. And yours?'
'That's the gospel truth.' Jess joins them, wrapped in a long coat. She winds an arm around Sam and smiles. 'If you're taking requests...' They start walking toward the car.
'You're joking.' Dean stares disbelievingly at Sam, who's covering his eyes with his forearm.
Dean's silence would be dignified if not for his sheepish expression. Cas' eyes crinkle up in silent laughter. The room feels warmer, brighter. It's been too long, Dean thinks. Even a day, an hour, a minute is too long. Dean desperately wants Cas to stay. So he brings out a toothbrush and a set of old comfortable clothes for Cas without asking. Cas doesn't respond, just smiles and leaves to change. Dean is thrilled, and takes advantage of Cas' absence, surreptitiously loading the dishwasher and texting Naomi to say he'll be in tomorrow morning. When Cas plods back in sock feet, Dean feels himself soften. Dean's pajamas are too big for Cas and Cas' hair looks even more unruly than usual.
'Hey, Cas, listen.' Castiel starts and meets Dean's eyes for the third time. Dean suppresses the feeling of awkward over-friendliness and opens his mouth to continue before realizing he has no idea what to say. 'Uh...just...let me know if you need anything. Anything at all. I remember wishing someone had said that to me on my first day.' He smiles at Cas and turns around to go find Chuck and realizes. That. He. Just. Called. A complete stranger. A. Nickname. Just keep walking, Dean.
His heart was a wreck of broken compasses, flood damage, and derailed trains, and he couldn't talk to anyone about it except Cas and Benny. Benny listened to Dean without judgement. He never told Dean to cheer up or stop griping, he just let Dean be confused and upset, and Dean was incredibly grateful. Benny knew what it was like to have two half-lived lives and to have to pick up the strings of one when you lost the other. His family had moved to Lawrence from Louisiana when he was too old to belong but too young to forge his own life. In a way, Benny was in limbo right along with Dean.
Dean straightens up so fast he thinks he might have dislocated his kneecaps. Chuck sniggers. Castiel blushes and opens his mouth, but before he can say anything, the rest of the attendants stream in around him for lunch, and he's carried off in the tide. Dean, Kevin, and Chuck follow, shucking their aprons. Cas is already surrounded, his table full, so Dean takes the seat directly behind Cas. If he leaned his head back, it would be resting on Cas' shoulder. He is sorely tempted. Instead, he swivels his chair a little so that he's facing out, and Castiel has room to turn slightly and join in the conversation at Dean's table. Kevin and Chuck raise their eyebrows and pointedly talk amongst themselves.
'Her fruit has been at the back this whole time. They don't pay me enough for this shit.'
When he reached the meeting place, Crowley and Bela were just pulling up, tailpipe spewing black smoke. If Dean had told her to check the air filter and fuel return line once, he'd told her a thousand times. That was Bela and her posse all over for you though; completely reckless. Simultaneously self-destructive and self-absorbed. It was a kind of statement: if you were the most important thing to yourself, destroying yourself was about as badass as you could be. Dean shoved his hands into his pockets and scowled as they pulled in and got out of the car, slamming the doors.
It took them a while to remember all the letters and even then Dean taped a cheat sheet to his wall, beside the window, so he could look at it while blinking his flashlight at Cas in the middle of the night. Up until the spring of 1992 they never got much sleep. They were too busy talking, for lack of a better word. It was liberating to say things without saying them. It made Dean feel like there would never be any consequences, like the things he was telling Cas didn't count as real. Even so, he was glad Cas knew them. They told one another about dreams they'd had, about private thoughts that they didn't feel they could tell anyone else, about their fears. Cas talked about Anna a lot, and about how she stopped making sense and fought with their parents all the time now. He was losing her, Dean understood, she was starting to move from Cas' world into one of her own. Dean told Cas about the loneliness he felt when his dad was gone, about how his responsibility for Sammy sometimes felt like a huge stone dragging him down, and his guilt for feeling all of that. They told each other dirty jokes, they called each other names, and they pretended they were lighthouses. That made Dean so dizzy he fell over, which resulted in Cas laughing so hard he dropped his flashlight and cracked it. From that night on, Cas' light was not a perfect rounded beam, but a shattered, blinding pulse. Dean thought it was very uniquely Cas. It was only a few days after that that it all stopped.
Christmas Eve, 1991
'I think it's the high school.'
Cas balled his hands into fists and stared at them. 'Are you sure? I can't punch you. I'm not even mad at you.'
'Maple and pecan plaits please! And meeting your charming and elusive boyfriend would be a bonus.'
4th of July, 1996
Sam flushed. 'Sorry, Jess.'
A bright smile because that was his dad's bright-smile tone of voice. 'Yeah!'
Sam didn't really think so, but sleep descended on him quickly.
'You finish it,' Dean told him, 'I'm good.' Cas slugged it back. Dean whistled. 'Didn't have you pegged as the liquor-holding type.'
Dean finds Chuck staring forlornly into the staff fridge. 'Hey, Chuck.' Dean pinches the bridge of his nose and tries not to think about what a serious ass he just made of himself. 'See that lost-looking guy with the black hair over there?' Chuck cranes his neck around Dean's shoulder.
Dean smiles, feeling relief flood his veins. His brain knows that Sam is fine without him, but the rest of Dean needs to see it to believe it, every time. 'Sammy!'
'When were you planning on telling me?' Dean's voice was low and dangerous.
'That spicy green sushi gunk?' Dean added.
'I wanted to thank you. For earlier.'
'What? With Cas? No. No, nothing's going on.' Skeptical silence. 'Seriously! Nothing!'
Dean calls in that favour from Naomi and goes home after lunch. He claims sickness, and he must still look awful because Naomi takes a step or two back and says, 'If you must. Let me know tonight if you think you won't be able to work tomorrow.' Dean agrees, privately thinking that he'd rather eat dirt than stay home alone in the silence of an empty house for longer than he has to.
Dean bounced on his feet. 'Okay, do it hard, though. If you punch like a wuss it won't work.'
'Probably your dad disapproved and that made you second-guess it all. But it seems like you've chosen something that fits you. It's pretty high-maintenance, right? To do with intellect. That's the ace of swords. You're responsible, a hard worker, and you enjoy what you do, even if you have nagging doubts. Am I close?'
Dean feels a kind of warmth in his stomach that spreads to his chest. He looks at Sam and Jess, how blindingly happy they are together. He looks at Bobby, who told Dean he was proud of him today, who's watching Sam with undisguised fondness. He looks at Cas, watches that wide smile that invites the world to smile with him, watches those blue eyes as they meet his own. Dean's not sure what will happen. He doesn't know if his bakery will do well, if he and Cas will stay together, if Sam and Jess will change once they're married, if Bobby...well, Bobby's always Bobby. The future is uncertain, a tunnel with twists and turns that Dean can't anticipate, but he thinks he sees light. Or is it the hope of light? He sees love. He sees happiness. He sees a family. And that's enough for him. What more can we ask of life?
'But the two of you came in together the other day and – don't you live with her?'
Dean laughed. His heartbeat pounded in his face. The pain dulled a bit. 'Don't be sorry. That was badass. Man, who knew you had it in you?' He was face to face with Cas, who wasn't backing away. Adrenaline flooded his veins.
'Whoa, hey, breathe. We have a few in the back storeroom.' Castiel breathes a sigh of relief and Dean tries hard not to smile. 'Come on, I'll show you.' Dean leads Cas past the walk in, which is slightly ajar, as usual. Dean can hear someone clattering around at the back. He turns his attention back to Castiel, who's looking around like he's trying to memorize the place. 'These face cloths are the older ones; they're a little smaller, but they do in a pinch. They shipped them back here when the new ones came in.'
They saw Bela coming from a long way off. She hopped over the fence and walked towards them.
“Me! What are we making, Uncle Cas?”
'Hey.' He turns to Chuck and Kevin, who stop snarking at each other to listen. 'What do you think of the new guy?
'What's going on?' Becky asked.
'Shhh. Ow.'
His jaw clenched. 'Fuck you.' He pushed her away, relished the low thud as her back hit the wall, did his pants back up, and stalked to the door. 'Yeah, fuck you too!' she spat.
Sam pulled on his coat and followed Dean to the door, where Dean opened the hall closet and fished out boots and mittens. Sam pulled his boots on first, wiggling his toes to straighten out the lining, then pulled his mittens on one at a time, the second with his teeth. Dean opened the door and the freezing quiet of the world rushed inside. The ground was blanketed in white and the world was still and peaceful. Dean tromped out first, his breath making clouds against the darkness and the starry sky. Sam followed and closed the door, listening for the muted clank of the letterbox flapping with the momentum. He kept his head down and watched his boots sink into the snow with each step. He loved the crisp crunching of his footfalls. When he walked through the snow he felt like he was breaking something that was made to be broken, like a piñata or a piggy bank. Dean was waiting for him at the end of the walk and Sam smiled at him. If Dean said it would be alright, it would be.
'Oh no you don't. We're taking a day off today.'
Dean adjusted his position to look Cas in the eye. Blue interest. Post-orgasm satisfaction. A warm contentment. The connection was enough.
'These are at least an 8. I think you're jealous.'
They reached Dean's house and walked to his backyard, where Crowley and Bela waited with the box while Dean climbed the fence into Cas' mom's garden. Dean's heart was pounding and his palms were sweaty as he took the box from Bela.
'...and that's Sammy, and that's the tree from the front yard, you know the one my dad won't let us climb? And that's my mom the way she used to be.'
'Hey, it's me. What's the word, Cas?'
'What?' Sam's confusion tripled. That was unheard of. The last time Dean had gone longer than a couple of days without talking to Cas was a year and a half ago when Dad had taken Dean and Sam camping. And even then, Dean had dragged Sam, Cas, and the tent out to the woods by the train tracks as soon as they got back so he could show Cas everything they had learned about roughing it. 'So...you don't know what's wrong with him either?'
When dad eventually came to get Sam, everyone was sad to see him go. They gave him a lot of food in containers and big hugs.
Gabe rolled his eyes. “It's an expression, Cassie dearest.”
'You've got a look if I say you've got a look. Now git. And pick up the phone sometime, it won't bite.'
'Would you like me to remove the bear?'
'Yeah. Anyway, I'm going to run this tray out really quickly, then I'll come back for the mains, you finish the eclairs. Do not overcook them or Naomi will have my head.'
| -.-. | .- | … |
Cas laughs and fills Dean's glass, waving off his protests before handing it back.
Cas smiled a sad smile (not a rare Cas-smile) and wrapped an arm around Sam's shoulders. 'I'm going to miss you guys too. My dad will still be here, you know. Maybe I'll ask my mom if I can spend Christmas with him.'
'Hm?'
Bela unlocked the back and hefted the trunk door up. 'I'm not sure how quickly the fuses will burn, so get out of there sharpish.'
“Dude. Tone it down.”
Dean flushed again. 'Yeah. I got that.'
'What? Why?'
'What
'Wait, what?' Dean is confused. More than confused. 'What does this have to do with Jo?'
'I am attempting courtship. Is it not working?'
“Of course. Just let me know when works for you and we'll set something up.”
'Yeah. If it IS real, awesome, and if it isn't, no harm done.' She stole a bite of Cas' cake. 'It was cool anyway. You should give it a shot. There's nothing to lose.'
'Jerk.' Sam wrestles the duffel out of Dean's protesting hands on the way to the carpark, and after only a few minutes, they're at Sam's car.
He looks at Dean and smiles, then his nervous eyes flick to the backseat. He walks over as everyone piles out of the car.
'Dean?'
'Yeah. In case you didn't notice, I've been off the reservation for a while.'
“Dust blocking the compressor fan.”
The short drive into Lebanon would have been hair-raising if Dean weren't made of stronger stuff. Even so, despite his nerves of steel, he found his foot automatically stomping down onto an imaginary brake every time they came up to a junction or a traffic light. It was like Cas didn't understand the concept of 'gradual.'
In one fluid motion, he threw the sheets off, letting the cold in with a frenzied whuff. Goosebumps rose on his skin even as he pulled his pajamas tightly around himself and padded over to his orchids. They rambled and bloomed waxily in pots on his dresser, their broad olive-green leaves obscuring every inch of wood.
Dean tuned out their bickering and scanned the field, the shallow sea of humans. Two kinds: the AP overachievers and the failing second-chancers. The Sams and the Deans of the world. His lips quirked. And that was when Dean saw him. Cas. Right there, in the distance, standing with a group of people Dean didn't know. Dean's heart stopped, then started beating twice as fast. No, he had to be seeing things. That was probably just some random guy with messy black hair. This was just a moment like all those other moments after Cas had first left, when Dean had seen Cas everywhere. That couldn't be Cas. But it was. Dean would know him from a mile away. As if he'd heard Dean's thoughts, Cas turned and looked straight at him. Shock rolled over Dean in waves. He felt like screaming, he felt like dancing, he felt like hitting something til his knuckles bled.
He feels antsy. He doesn't want to go home, he knows that all he'll find there is solitude and quiet so pressing that it hurts his ears. He knows he's running from something, but he's so damn terrified and moving so fast that he doesn't want to slow down even for a second to find out what it is. He turns around in the kitchen, looking for anything to fixate on, and his eyes land on cocoa powder. Why not? The apple pie went down a storm at lunch the day after he made it, and that's all the excuse Dean needs. He bustles around the kitchen, grabbing all the ingredients. The secret ingredient being blackberry jam. He measures, he weighs, he mixes, and it seems like everything narrows down into a single point. Everything in his life, everything in his mind, is quantifiable and calculated, certain. He knows that if he adds this much sugar to this much egg and whisks it over heat that it will turn into a sponge base, and no variables or emotions or tragedies can change that. He might not have a family anymore but he has this much flour and this much baking powder and a cake tin big enough to hold it, and that's all you get from life, sometimes. It's only when something falls into the half-finished frosting that Dean even realizes his eyes are wet. He stares at the tear sitting on the surface of the mixture, fighting a weird urge to laugh, and he hears a quiet knock behind him.
'Freak flag you like to fly, freak flag you like to fly, freak frag you – damn.' Cas hmphed a laugh. Dean grinned and lowered his head to rub his nose against Cas' cheek. He tried to come up with a way to let Cas know that he thought he was bizarrely adorable without having to say it, but he couldn't think of one. So he nipped Cas' neck and ran his hand down the bulging front of the Christmas boxers, savoring the shiver it evoked in his living Christmas ornament of a boyfriend. The covers rucked up and wrinkled around them. He rubbed up and down slowly until Cas was stifling moans against Dean's skin and grinding his hips up, holding Dean tightly with hot hands. Then he slipped his hand in through the candycane-covered opening and around Cas. Hot and velvet and hard. The smell of warm skin. Dean almost groaned along with Cas. He felt like he was seeing with his hands what Cas was feeling.
“Well, Cassie, obviously I was lying. But ask me how the sex was! It was WEIRD, he wanted to - ”
“Are we sure about this Bobby guy?” Sam asked, pulling onto the interstate. “He's a hunter. Historically, hunters don't feel great about our kind.”
“A ghost once told me I’d be killed for love, you know,” Dean tells Castiel, and isn’t really sure why.
He runs his hands along the walls, searching for any imperfections - a loose brick that might work free. He finds nothing. After a few minutes of fruitless examination, his heart sinks. The room is empty. He’ll have to brave the ghosts once more, try to get past them to the next room.
And then Dean is suddenly kissing Castiel.
They had died because of the church’s condemnation. Now, of course, Dean knows it was a condemnation based not on the real wrath of heaven, but instead on the baseless bigotry of humankind. God never despised them, just as He never despised Akobel or Lily’s daughter. Still, all of them had died.
He would’ve thought that Sam - bizarre serial killer nerd that he was - would feel similarly, but judging by the pinched look on his face as they mounted the front steps, this was not the case. That might have been due to the fact that if Bobby Singer did turn out to be a serial killer, Sam was probably his type.
“Yes, well,” Missouri said. “I’m sorry to have given you more questions than answers.”
Dede arrived not long after with a bottle of wine and immediately dove into a funny story about a client. As the food was trotted out, they all settled in around the dinner table, Dean sitting close to Patience so he could listen to her rambling stories about preschool, with Sam on his other side, engaged deep in a debate with Dede about the relative value of quartz as a focusing crystal in spellwork.
“I know they’re your favorite.”
He shakes a healthy dose of salt over the hair, then flicks his lighter and lets it burn. He watches dispassionately as the fire crawls up each strand toward his fingers, twisting into another braid, this time of acrid smelling smoke. Soon there is nothing left but ash that clings to the memory of what it once was. Dean lets it fall limply to the floor.
Dean sets his beer carefully down on the table.
“On a related note,” Sam said, “Marlene came in again today. Second time in as many weeks.”
Dean falls to his knees and pries at it with his fingers. The tile is stiff from over a hundred years of gathered dust and dirt and damp, but he can feel it start to wiggle in its place. He picks up the shotgun and raises the butt of it into the air, then slams it down. The tile cracks. A few more slams and it breaks open, revealing a small crevice squeezed between the floor and the wall.
And if unfit for tombs and hearse
“You’re such an idiot,” Sam said. But there was no point in arguing once Dean had made up his mind. “Fine. What do we try next? African Dream Root?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That sounds perfect!” Marlene said. “Where are they?”
“You can give me the full rundown later,” he says.
“Say doctor,” James whispered. “Say doctor.”
“Go right ahead,” Steven said, munching on an oatmeal cookie. “Dean, when are you going to bring that nice friend of yours back around?”
“Dude, what are we going to tell Missouri?” Sam asked, pressing the cold bottle up against his temple. He’d started forming a headache at about the time they’d arrived at the cemetery with a body and a pair of shovels hidden in the bed of his truck. It didn’t show any signs of abating now that they were home.
“So they keep telling us,” Dean said.
And also:
“What happened?” he asked, scrambling to his brother's side.
“She’s good business, though,” Dean said. “Can’t really afford to tell her to beat it.”
Sam slumped back down into his bed with a groan.
And they had. Having spent their formative years in the parlors and kitchens of psychics and hedge witches, Sam and Dean had seen plenty of thoughtless souls receive signs that they chose to ignore to their own detriment. They had shaken their heads, rolled their eyes, and gone back to making houses out of tarot cards, all the while thinking - you could lead a horse to spiritual intervention, but you couldn’t make it drink. They’d hardly make the same mistake themselves.
But the moment was forgiven, not forgotten.
Then he hung up.
“It’s the truth,” Castiel insists.
He dropped the towel and studied Sam’s panicked expression, taking in the remaining streaks of blood and the pale tinge to his brother’s face. They were in way over their heads, and they both knew it.
“What do you want from me?” Sam asked again. “If this is about the ritual, I never finished -”
. When he moves to look inside, the book falls open to a page somewhere in the middle, marked by a lock of hair.
Slowly, he began to calm back down. He swallowed, and then had to do it again when he found his mouth was bone dry. He was just sitting up to reach for the glass of water on his nightstand when there was a knock on the door - almost deafeningly loud in the ringing silence.
Sam drew back from his perusal of Bobby’s collection to exchange an alarmed glance with Dean.
'It wasn't your fault, Cas. There was nothing you could've done.' Dean knew it was trite, but what else could he say? He tried to hammer home the truth of it in the stare he gave Cas. Cas' eyes were wide open and trusting, taking Dean in without a filter as they always did. Dean didn't think he had ever noticed before just how blue Cas' eyes were. They were like lightning, fire, electricity. Dean had read somewhere that blue and green in the eye were caused by an absence of pigment and that the scattering of light was what created the illusion of color. There wasn't any blue, just light pouring through holes in the iris. Empty spaces patched up with something beautiful. Dean couldn't look away.
'I used all your spinach.'
'Ahem. Am I interrupting something? Do you guys need a minute?'
Cas nodded. 'Okay. After I've packed this suitcase.'
'Do you have any spare face cloths? The laundry is out and the laundry man says the next load is still drying and we need them for the 120 corridor because we're way behind and Hester sent me and she needs to get this room done quickly because the guests are in the lobby already.'
Cas sighs and slumps against the seat. 'I apologize. It's different when you're walking.'
Cas doesn't answer. He nods and stays silent, and Dean is grateful. Cas sits on the stool and watches as Dean beats the frosting into submission, tear included, until it's perfectly smooth and the whisk stands up in the bowl when Dean lets go of it. He watches as Dean places the cooling rack on top of the cake tin and flips them both upside down, carefully teasing the tin up and off the cake. He watches as Dean spreads the icing with a spatula, each stroke perfect. Dean feels self-conscious about the faint tear tracks on his face, but he doesn't want to draw attention to them by wiping them. He does not cry. He's not that person. He fills a sieve with icing sugar and whacks the side of it with unnecessary force to dust the top of the cake.
'No. I'm so tired I could fall over. I'm ready to sleep.' Cas sits down on the couch.
Soon after that, during one of John's rare weeks at home, Cas commandeered Dean to help him clear out the garden shed in his backyard and move in all his art supplies and a big wooden desk. Dean spent more time playing around with all Cas' brushes and paints and strange thin tools than he did helping, but Cas didn't mind. When they finished, Cas sat down at the desk and ran his hands over the smooth surface. 'I should break the place in.'
He woke to the sound of gravel crunching beneath the tires. Blearily, he wiped his eyes and looked around. They were at Uncle Bobby's and Aunt Ellen's. The windows downstairs were bright and welcoming despite the hour.
When Dean pulls into his driveway, he calls Cas.
'Ahhh, nothing.' He patted Dean's shoulder obnoxiously. 'Just...good luck with that.'
Dean gave Sam an appraising look. 'Are you?'
'You can borrow one of my old shirts, I have a ton. Seriously. I feel bad, you were just here making me dinner, and it's a long drive back to yours.' Dean agrees. He'll feel better knowing that Jo isn't all alone here and injured on top of it, after all.
'It's okay, I'm cultivating callouses.' Cas shows Dean his palm.
'No.'
Dean looked down at the pile of Toobers & Zots. He pushed half the pile over to Cas, who sat down and picked up a handful of foam circles.
'Hi.'
'Here, Naomi.'
And with a chuckle, Dean was gone. Sam looked over at Dean's desk. He was dying to know, so he crossed the room with tentative steps. He flipped through Dean's books until something slipped out of one and fluttered onto the desk. Sam picked it up. It was a creased photograph that Sam recognized immediately. He, Dean, and Cas grinned up from the photo, their faces sun-burnt and sticky with melted popsicle juice. That was the day Dean and Cas had let Sam join in their game of truth or dare. Shortly after their dad had taken the picture, Sam had eaten about 15 popsicles on a dare and thrown up rainbows. Dean had laughed himself hoarse, even after Cas had whacked him for being insensitive. To make it up to Sam, Dean and Cas had let him pick all the pizza toppings when John ordered them dinner.
Dean leaves for the walk-in. He hears Jo tell Kevin to try to scrub the trays. Dean knows he must look furious and red-eyed, because Jo would usually joke around and laugh it off. Right now everyone in the kitchen is looking at him as if he might grow claws and spit fire.
'Caaaaassie! It's the Baby to your Johnny!' Gabriel grinned at Dean around the enormous sugar cookie he was eating.
John sighed. 'Not long, son. I'll be back before you know it.' He opened the door. Sam's throat tightened.
“Good morning, Young Novak.”
'My equipment will be arriving day after tomorrow. I'll be able to start up my studio again.'
The corners of Mrs. McGuirk's eyes crinkled as she laughed. “I'll start swearing around you when you drop the 'Mrs.' and start calling me Hyun-Sook.”
Sam cleared his throat at Dean and inclined his head towards Cas. It was his 'where are your manners' face. Cas was still looking at Dean curiously.
'Dean? Are you alright?'
Cas rolls his eyes. 'Get your mind out of the gutter.'
'She's right, Dean. You need to rest.'
That was the year they really became family. John Winchester, tired of scrambling around after an eight-year-old Dean and a four-year-old Sammy without the relief of school or daycare, had called up Bobby and Ellen and asked if they wanted to bring Jo along on a trip to Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita. The weather was beautiful, the kids were hyper, the zoo was open, and the hours of entertainment seemed worth the long (ish) drive. John never minded driving anyway. You'd think, as a truck driver, he'd want to avoid the road during his time off, but behind the wheel was the one place where John always felt safe. Nothing happened in a car that he couldn't control. Driving also had the dual benefit of letting him relax and making him feel productive at the same time. He didn't do long-haul trips though, not yet. He didn't want to leave his boys alone for more than a day, even with the neighbors checking in. Maybe when Dean was a little older he could take the bigger jobs. He mostly drove within the state so he knew the routes well, and driving from Lawrence to Wichita would put them past Emporia, where Bobby and Ellen had settled. He knew they would have to take two cars anyway, so when he called Bobby, he suggested the kids bring friends. Between the three of them, they agreed, they could manage a few younger ones, especially since Dean was becoming more independent.
Sam took her hand and pulled her over to the fence that separated the back yard from the front. 'I thought I heard – '
“Good morning, you picky photosynthesising parasites.” He scanned the roots for mould or mites and leaned over the one with yellow blooms dusted with pink spots, which had several still-closed buds at the end of its stem. 'How are you feeling today?' He blew on its leaves affectionately and a cloud of cinnamon exploded into the air and went up his nose. He hastily withdrew, sneezing and rubbing his eyes. He knew it was what his sister Hannah would call 'new-agey' to use cinnamon on orchids, but it worked so much better than anti-fungal spray and it made his room smell like a bakery. Which was a change, because the rest of the house smelled like moss and earth and old books.
Cas beckoned Dean in to the living room, where Cas' whole family was spread out. Their tree was huge and the room was warm and friendly, covered in wrapping paper just like Dean's, with empty plates and mugs on every table. The radio was on and playing Christmas carols and Anna and Michael were wearing their respective Christmas sweaters. Michael looked like a stuffed frog, but Anna looked like she was enjoying herself, as did Cas' parents. Dean made the rounds. He gave Cas' parents the Christmas card Sam had made John and Dean sign and answered the standard questions about school and his dad. Gabe came down with two flat boxes. He shook his finger at Dean.
He rinsed the ash off in the bathroom sink and stared at his reflection as he brushed his teeth, trying to figure out if he was losing his mind. He didn't look like a crazy person. He looked like a confused and spooked man who was about to be late for work. He shook himself. He scrubbed at his teeth energetically and ran a brush he called Losing Battle through his hair before shrugging on his clothes and hurrying from the room.
He glared over and gestured for Crowley to zip it.
“It's a simple question – are you an idiot?"
'I came by to check on you. How's the leg?'
'Whoa, I'm definitely Johnny.'
'Which girl?'
Bela laughed and lit a joint. The sickly sweet smell of the weed mingled with tobacco and floated around her like a cloud of perfume. 'Aren't you a sensitive flower tonight. Chickening out, Winchester?' Her voice was barbed. She was furious with Dean and too proud to let him know. He knew, though. He just couldn't bring himself to care.
The Bunker
'Dean?' Jo's voice cuts through the babble. 'God, are you okay? Is something on fire?'
The bathroom door opens. Cas doesn't object (he's never felt a possessive sense of prudishness or self-consciousness about this body even though it's technically his own now) but he is curious. He peers out through the steam and sees Dean. Dean stands completely still and stares at Cas staring at him. Some shampoo runs down Cas' forehead and gets in his eyes. Blinking rapidly, he turns back to the stream of water and rinses it out.
Sam exhales through his nose. “God, I hope not. I never want to drink again.”
Cas rushed Anna out the door before she could begin the interrogation.
When it was time for Cas to go home, Dean really didn't want him to go, even though he knew it was only next door. He opened his mouth and waited for his feelings to arrange themselves into English words in an understandable order, but they didn't. They swirled around him in colors and shapes and foam-textured anxiety, so he closed his mouth and settled for watching as Cas put his shoes on and tied them. Then Cas said, 'You can come over to my house next time if you want. All my toys are still in the box but there's a tire swing in the backyard. My mom says it's safe.'
Dean is acutely conscious of Cas' presence in the kitchen for the next few hours. He and Kevin and, eventually, Chuck, bringing news of Jo's welfare, are busy and working hard to finish the main courses, then to get all the dishes clean. When Dean finally has a spare moment, he glances around for Cas, and doesn't see him. He assumes Cas went back to 160 to finish his shift or clock out. Lucky him. It's another couple of hours before everyone in the kitchen is finished, before the place begins to shut down, and Dean is left alone in the middle of a half-dark room.
Bela had adopted the garage as a second home. She mostly kept a sharp eye on everyone else's business and picked pockets. And that was exactly what she was doing when Dean walked in. She had her hand in the back pocket of some pierced guy who was chatting Meg up. He didn't seem to notice as she lifted his leather wallet and shook it at Dean. Her eyes flashed with spiteful humor when she took out a few crumpled bills and slipped the wallet back into the guy's baggy jeans.
'I didn't MEAN it, you idiot! Anyone could have figured that out!'
Cas smiled and unbuckled his seatbelt. 'He told me you hadn't talked in a while.'
'No.' Dean focuses on his frosting instead of Cas. 'Sometimes I just need to cook.'
Who says things like 'out of sorts?' The corners of Dean's lips twitch. The bruised place in his chest feels sore. 'What are you doing here so late, anyway?'
'Cosmopolitan.'
Dean, still irritable from the unwanted furry affection, retorted, “He can't understand. You do know that Bones doesn't speak English, right?”
“Pizza. I'll show you how.” He got out his phone and ordered one, which Claire thought was hilarious.
'What do you mean?'
The town of Birch Ridge contained many things that made it a town just like any other. It had houses, shops, schools, restaurants, churches, and a town hall. It was also full of things that set it apart from other towns. For one thing, it was founded around a single tree. The story of its founding had been told and retold by its inhabitants until it took on the tone of legend. No one was quite sure how much of it was real, but that didn't seem to matter. The exalted fiction of it all was more true to the town than a historical record could ever be. The story, give or take a few details, went like this: The founders of Birch Ridge, before they were the founders of Birch Ridge, wandered inland - a ragged group of aching legs and half-empty bellies. When they reached the huge birch standing alone in a clearing someone sighed and sat down. Here, they decided. Here will do. It feels peaceful and we are tired. The spiders spun quiet webs, undisturbed. The trees stretched slowly upward. The air was clear, the leaves fell as if gravity was a choice rather than a rule. Now, though they didn't yet know it, they were founders. Their exhaustion made it easier to accept the strange atmosphere. They lit a fire with twigs and smouldering damp logs and ate sitting in the grass. When one of the women went into labour within several hours of their arrival and gave birth to a beautiful baby speckled like a heifer, they put it down to the effects of hawthorn or traveling too late in pregnancy. His large mournful eyes were open to the sky. Blood on the grass. The softness of new skin. The people had made up their minds and, despite the oddities, felt at home. They stayed.
'Well, half the books are my brother's. Sorry to disappoint on the magical-atmosphere front. I could pretend this mug of coffee is a scrying pool if you want.'
Dean chuckled. 'No, I mean...what's your poison? Tarot cards? Palm-reading? Ouija board? You look confused.'
Cas touched Dean's shoulder. 'Dean, are you okay? Shit, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit you so hard. Tell me you're okay.'
He rubbed the back of Cas' neck and Cas hummed a little and closed his eyes. He shifted and moved closer, pressing his body flush against Dean's, so Dean kissed him. It was slow and soft. They weren't in any hurry. Dean hiked up Cas' hideous sweater a few inches and rubbed circles onto Cas' hipbone with his fingers. Wrote letters. P. X. S. Drew shapes. Cas broke away and started kissing Dean's jaw, his neck, just beneath Dean's ear. Dean closed his eyes and felt the heat on his skin. It reminded him of that time he'd watched Cas work with watercolors. The instant Cas' dripping brush had touched the wet page the paint had spread out in a wide circle of tiny blue tendrils. A color nebula, a winter halo, a mushroom cloud the shade of Cas' eyes. It was hard for Dean to function with Cas kissing his neck, but he let his hand slip underneath Cas' sweater and trailed his fingers along the bumps of Cas' ribs. Cas made a helpless sound in the back of his throat that Dean felt more than heard. He brought his hand back down again and traced along Cas' waistband. Cas angled his hips back to give Dean more access.
Suspicion crept over Sam. He looked back to Dean. The pale-faced girl mimed something with her hands and the rest of them laughed even harder.
'Thanks, Jo, but I don't have pajamas or anything.'
'He knows. Don't worry, he's gonna make it. Now come on! Let's go.'
Inias and Castiel affectionately referred to Castiel's gardening pet projects as the pets. One section of the greenhouses at the back was reserved for Castiel's experiments; grafting plants together, rehabilitating very sick specimens, growing herbs for friends and family, and trying out strange new non-native plants.
Dean heard Benny and Jess whooping and Sam laughing as if from a great distance. All of his senses were currently preoccupied with his best friend standing next to him and staring up at the light-streaked sky. Dean thought about reaching for Cas' hand and waited for the appearance of fear or hesitance or anything that wasn't screaming, 'Yes, yes, do it!' There was only the desire to get closer. So he reached down and slipped his hand into Cas', who squeezed without looking away from the fireworks. It felt like their hands were made to be fitted together. Dean tapped a message into Cas' palm.
4th of July, 1996
'I'll drive.'
Sam heaved himself up. “I'm going to take him for a quick walk. Get to know the neighbourhood a little.”
'Don't worry, Sam, he'll come around.'
And that was when Dean exploded, like Sam knew he would. 'Why are you even
'My brother. We only had each other when Dad died, and it's been my job to look out for him since we were kids, so I just...kept doing it. But he's at Stanford now, so...' Dean shrugs.
The car rumbled on the gravel of the café parking lot and the feeling faded as he rolled to a stop. He looked around and saw Mrs. McGuirk stepping out of the café as he himself stepped out his car. He waved and smiled.
When they pulled over at an old field just on the edge of town, Dean got out of the car and nudged Cas. He leaned in close and pointed at the treeline. Sam heard him say, 'The park is right over there. So if we time it right...'
The tall silhouette, Sam eventually learned, was a guy named Fergus Crowley. The shorter silhouette was a mysterious, cold-eyed girl named Bela Talbot. Sam asked around about them and was told a number of highly-colored stories that involved theft, fires, smoking, drinking, car crashes, and bullying. Fergus and Bela started coming around to the house in a dinged-up car that wheezed and rattled like Pestilence. They made the living room smell like cigarette smoke. Sam hated them. Their eyes were caustic and hard, their smiles were insincere smirks. He hated who Dean became around them. He wanted his brother back.
'Hey, Castiel.' Kevin says.
Jo sizes him up, then relaxes into the couch cushions. 'Yes please,' she groans.
Cas' parents were in an animated discussion about puff pastry with Jimmy, and walked over to hug Cas hello without stopping. He sat down as they weighed in on store-bought frozen pastry and his father winked at him.
Before Dean knew what he was doing, his fist was swinging through the air. It was a bizarre reversal of roles. His cheek where Cas had punched him months ago throbbed as if remembering the blow. Cas was bent over, stunned. Dean could see blood coming from a split in Cas' lip. There was a moment when Dean felt paralyzed with regret, then Cas looked up, dark clouds gathering in his expression, and lunged. He surged into Dean and pinned him against the wall, an arm across Dean's throat.
'Perfect. You guys make it look so perfect. Like something out of a TV show.'
'It's my fault. I'll go grab some of the frozen baguettes.'
“Always for you, my brother from another mother.”
Gabe shielded himself from the flying flour. “Watch it, Master Chef, you're gonna re-dust the counters!”
'You've never fallen for the wrong person?'
Dean feels all the tension drain out of him as the machinery powers down. Everything whirs into silence except for the gentle hum of the freezers and fridges, and Dean can relax. Everyone has gone home, everyone has clocked out except for him. He wipes down the surfaces one last time, hands moving in familiar circular motions, and thinks about the day. Everything had gone smoothly after the morning. He had had to rush the sifting a little to make up for those precious lost minutes, but everyone was on the ball, and all the pastries were made in time for the banquet. Weddings. He shakes his head. Weddings are the worst. Everyone is high-strung, and everything always seems to go wrong.
'You're way too good for a hotel.'
'Jo told me. I'm sorry. For what it's worth.'
'Cas, let's just pull over and ask someone. Hang on, I'm going to park here.'
'There is a whole entire pie in the kitchen, you know.'
'No buts! It's Independence Day, Sammy. Be independent.'
Dean doesn't want to change the subject. He wants to keep kissing Cas for as long as Cas will let him, until he figures out where they stand. 'I'm fine. I have to try to clean up the mess I made of the day.'
“Uhh...” Cas squinted but kept listening.
From his room, Dean heard the car pull up in the driveway. The growl of the engine was unmistakable. For no discernible reason, he thought of the circle of spruce trees in the park down the block, a space where sounds were muted and the air smelled like autumn all the time. He considered going back to sleep, wrapping the quilt and his own body heat around himself and nodding off to the sounds of his dad getting settled. He felt unresolved, though, and he knew he needed to see his dad in person.
Dean chokes on a sudden laugh and only just manages not to spray beer all over the table. Sam clears his throat and cocks his head at Dean, raising his eyebrows. Dean, still smiling, puts the phone down and adopts a mock-serious expression. He looks expectantly at Sam. Sam narrows his eyes and shoves a page across the table. 'Any good business plan starts with a unique idea, so try thinking about what makes you different. What sets you apart from other businesses like yours?' Dean looks down at the sheet of paper, which is full of bullet points and tables.
'Cas. The stuff in those magazines isn't real.' He struggled for words. 'That's not the way real life works. Those articles are written by people who have nothing to do with you, or me.' Cas' face fell. 'Not that I don't appreciate the gestures!' Dean added hastily. 'It's just...there's no need for...all that.'
He nodded again.
“Dark chocolate and rum mousse for the filling. With whipped cream. And a chocolate sea salt topping. And maybe chopped Macadamia nuts on top.”
Dean groans delightedly at the mention of garlic bread and his stomach grumbles in agreement. 'Did Jo reorganize my kitchen? Where is she?'
'Don't worry about it! Happens all the time.' Dean maneuvers into a small parking space in front of the Gas n Sip and turns the car off. 'Come on, it'll be an adventure.' He and Cas leave the car, and Dean surreptitiously locks it before they walk in through the front door. The lights flicker and the cashier - a bored-looking teenager chewing gum in an obscenely exaggerated manner - looks up.
'It's almost Christmas.'
“Oui, monsieur,” Dean says with an exaggerated little bow and a terrible French accent. Cas follows him into the gas station. “And for madame?”
Dean was on the alert immediately. 'What do we need protecting from?'
'Don't worry, Sammy, we'll lift you. C'mon, Cas, just like we did at school.'
'Hester, Jo's gone home injured, can I borrow Castiel for an hour or so?'
Cas looked at it properly. It was a drawing of two naked people; a man and a woman, standing in front of a tree with their arms around one another.
Dean looked up at Cas sheepishly. 'That's your immediate future. You're going to think I'm nuts.'
“I'm sorry, Ga - ”
'Yeah, of course. Come back in time for dinner, though. You're welcome too, Dean.'
Dean unlocks the door and lets everyone in. He looks around and gives it a once-over. It's not a huge  space, but it's open-plan and feels bigger than it is. The wooden floors make the place look homey and the glass displays make Dean think of ice cream shops. Dean tries to pretend he's seeing it for the first time - the half-brick and half-painted walls, the cushy chairs, the potted plants and hanging paintings, the lamps and couches by the window. 'The paint is kind of amateur, and the cushions don't really match, but - '
The tension drains from Dean's shoulders, his stomach un-knots, and his fists relax. He tries not to sound shaky when he responds, 'God, Samantha, don't freak me out like that. Alright, enough with the feelings. What are we doing tonight?'
'Yes you do. Thank me and accept it. If you don't I'll just drive you back to my place before work anyway.'
Sam understood. 'Okay, Uncle Bobby. Thanks.'
“How do you feel?”
'Yeah. Let's go see the carolers.'
When he wakes, it's with a start. Cas is watching him from the armchair in the corner. Dean sits up slightly and inhales. Something smells delicious. 'You watching me sleep, Cas?'
'It's amazing.' Dean wanted to flip through the sketchbook, but when he moved to turn a page Cas' hand twitched like he wanted to grab it, so Dean simply handed it back to him and asked, 'Do you want to watch a scary movie?' It was a dare and he knew Cas knew it.
“Is that Cas?!” Another voice rang out. Castiel's twin joined Gabe at the counter, grinning and stirring something floury in a big metal bowl. Puffs of fine powder rose up and settled on his forearms.
Ten minutes later, she walked out the door with at least six bags of tea blends that Castiel had given her as a 'gift,' and Castiel's eyes closed for a long moment to rest from the assault of her shirt. They opened again when he heard Inias laughing.
He's right, of course. Lunch is barely over and Cas' back is just disappearing through the kitchen door when Chuck and Kevin converge on him.
He thinks dully as Sam and Dean run over.
Jo laughs. 'I think there's some spaghetti in the cupboard.'
Dean cast a guilty glance at Cas' house. The lights were still all off despite the occasion. Dean guessed that the whole family was at the park to watch the fireworks, which surprised him, given Cas' hatred of crowds and family outings. Then again, Dean thought bitterly, what did he know? Cas might be completely different now. He might be absolutely thrilled at the thought of watching fireworks in the park with his dysfunctional family unit. Little did they know they could've just stayed home. The windows were dark. Dean could see his own pale face reflected back at him in the living room window as he walked down to the street and turned away. He was meeting Crowley and Bela about half a block away just to be sure none of the nearby neighbors saw Bela's license plate, then they were all coming back to Dean's.
'I was wondering if you'd help me move some of it in. It is quite heavy.'
'Is the milk really in bags? Seriously?'
'Aw, Sam, I'm only kidding.'
'You're always hungry.'
Dean grins and spreads his arms. 'Would I let you down, Sammy? Would I?'
'Of course, sure. You have our number?'
Dean pays and they go back to the car.
Sam heard crunching gravel in his mind, remembered playing in Bobby's salvage yard, remembered the feeling of weeks stretching out to the end of forever. 'Come back soon, Cas. I'm gonna miss you. Christmas won't be the same without you.' Sam couldn't help it, his voice wobbled and cracked a little.
It had all started on the day of the annual trip to Vegas. It was strictly a Dean-and-Sam thing, an opportunity for brotherly bonding (code for pretending their problems didn't exist and blowing off steam) so Castiel wasn't invited.
'He still has half a shift to finish,' Hester snarks irritably.
Cas made an irritated sound. 'You're the one who's been AWOL, Dean. I've been trying to tell you since Thanksgiving. It's impossible to tell someone something if they're avoiding you like the plague.'
Cas' eyes are wide and he looks wildly around the kitchen before he sees Dean. He lets out a shaky breath, hand over his heart. What is he wearing? It's an oversized beige trench coat over his uniform. It makes him look adorably rumpled. The hair doesn't help. Dean wonders how anyone could resist that gloriously sexed-out bedhead, and those huge wide eyes.
“Winchester?” Cas asks.
'Then stay, if you want. There are some dishes that need to be washed, and they're not urgent, so you can take your time.'
She undid the button on his jeans and dipped her hand inside his boxers, wrapped her fingers around Dean's flagging half-erection. Dean leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes, tried not to think about messy dark hair and burning lightning blue. All he could see was Cas. His mind revolted, he opened his eyes and focused on Bela. She was the opposite of Cas in every way. Her eyes were narrowed. Her expression flashed self-consciousness for a moment before she hid it beneath irritation. 'What's wrong, Dean? The unexpected return of your boyfriend put you in a strop?' Dean knew she meant it as an offhand, non-specific insult, but it was like a lash across Dean's back. The soapy air seemed to condense around him.
The next day, Sam brought in cards for all his friends, but saved Jess' special one for last. He handed it to Jess, blushing furiously. Her face lit up and she hugged him tightly.
'My little dog?' Dean was baffled.
Sam rubbed his coat like he was trying to remove a stain and didn't look at Dean. 'Dad's not coming, is he?'
'Why not? What's stopping you?'
“We just worry about you, son,” his father added. “We don't want you to be lonely.”
Cas' face cleared. 'Ah,' he muttered, and took another swig.
Sam rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean. Whatever. I'm starving, I'm going to go grab some lunch.”
While Dean picks out sandwiches and jerky, Cas wanders down the short aisles marvelling at the huge variety of flavours and textures invented by humans to occupy their mouths and minds. It feels alien to him even though he is now, for all intents and purposes, human. It's not his heritage but he is expected to live in it.
“It's pretty strange and kind of risky, which is why I want to run it by you.”
Sam didn't look up. 'Bring me back something. We can hold down the fort while you go.'
'How you're not fatter than you are, I don't know.' Jo jabs him in the ribs.
'Hi.' A grape-colored smile.
doing? It's Thanksgiving, you know. Every other family is having a paint by numbers moment.'
The next day when Cas gave Dean, of all things, a shoebox filled with Snickers bars, Sam was a perfect blend of delighted and smug.
'It's considered a leisure activity in Russia,' Castiel retorts, with a perfectly straight face. Dean bursts out laughing, and Chuck and Kevin stare at the two of them. Dean couldn't care less.
'Huh?' Sam snapped back to his reality.
Blood hits Cas' face and his lungs blow up as suddenly as they seized. His body convulses up in a desperate grapple for air as the werewolf falls forward, eyes lifeless.
'Did you hear me, Dean?'
'Hey, I'm easy. So, what are you in for?'
'So you don't know when you're coming back.'
Cas' face fell. He chewed his lower lip. 'She's alright. She still hears voices but I think she's stopped believing they're angels. She keeps talking about the end of the world. She says she dreams about it all the time. Last time we visited she said, “Cas, what would you do if you were going to die tomorrow?”'
He remembered scary movies, loud screaming from the TV, the crinkle of sleeping bags. Junk food, talking quietly, gentle snoring, and the whir of the fridge.
The rest of his siblings were always called by their names, but to Mrs. McGuirk Castiel was always Young Novak. He never wondered why; Mrs. McGuirk was a bundle of Unfathomable Tendencies.
4th of July, 1996
Dean didn't bother turning the lights on. He didn't want to face the emptiness of the house and turning the lights on while John and Sam were both out was like bringing up politics at dinner: It broke the peace and shed unnecessary light on what was usually hidden for a reason. His eyes were already adjusted. Besides, considering what Dean was about to do, darkness suited him better. He pulled on a black button-down and went downstairs. He stood by the big living room window to center himself, eyes closed to avoid looking at Cas' house. When he opened them he thought he saw a flash of movement across the way. He drew back against the wall to watch, but nothing else moved. The windows remained dark and devoid of life. Probably just his imagination. He shook himself. The framed photo on the mantelpiece caught his eye. John Winchester was front and center, his arms around a young Sam. On the left, Bobby and Ellen with Jo and Charlie. Dean on the right with Cas, the two boys leaning against each other with an easy familiarity. Their flash-frozen grins made Dean's knees weak. His breath caught and he felt his chest tighten twice; once with bittersweet affection and once with anger. He felt ready to destroy something. The smiling people in the photo frame watched him leave. Emptiness took his place.
He drops the bowl in shock, and thankfully it's only two inches above the counter. The clang reverberates through the kitchen and Dean turns, hurriedly wiping his eyes. Of course it would be Cas in the doorway. Whatever gods run Dean's life have an annoying sense of humour.
'Wasabia Japonica is a plant that needs very specific conditions to grow. It only thrives in certain areas, the most common of which are mountainous streams or rivers in Japan.'
Dean avoided Cas for a week. He took detours at school, he walked the halls or sat in empty classrooms at lunch, and he only went home to sleep. He spent the rest of the time climbing trees in the woods, borrowing the car keys to drive around Lawrence in circles, or riding bikes with Benny. Benny stared at Dean's bruised face and tightened his jaw in disapproval, but didn't ask. Dean was half-tempted to ask Benny how Cas was doing but the words died in his lungs. Occasionally he caught glimpses of Cas in the hallways. Cas looked defeated. Seeing him made Dean painfully aware of a certain lump in his throat, but he was overwhelmed with it all (nerves, sadness, tension, humiliation, anger, caution) so he always turned away abruptly and tried to pretend that he hadn't seen Cas seeing him. Dean didn't even realize how much effort he was putting into tracking Cas in order to avoid him until the day Cas didn't show up. Why wasn't he there? Cas was never absent. And Dean meant never. Last year Cas had come to school with the flu and passed out at his desk in English. Foreboding washed over Dean. It must have shown on his face because Benny finally cracked and said, 'Go talk to him, Dean. Stop being such a dick.' Dean wondered how much he knew.
“Are you experiencing a hangover?”
Dean nods and swallows his laughter as best he can. 'Yes. Sorry, yes. Do you – Do you want it?' He sees Cas trying to calm himself down.
Sam would walk by Dean's room after school only to see Cas and Dean sitting in silence – Dean struggling with homework or playing a video game while Cas zoned out with his nose in a book or a pencil in his hand. Sam's Accelerated Reader buddy, Jess, asked if Cas lived with them. Sam laughed and told her that no, he was their next-door neighbor, but it made him think. Cas was over a lot. He hung out with Dean, he helped cook, he ate dinner with them, and he slept over at least a few nights a week, unless dad was home. Benny was over too, sure, but Cas soaked into their daily life like he had always been there which, Sam realized, he pretty much had.
He shoved her hands off. She didn't know a damn thing about it.
'Thank God for that,' Ellen chipped in.
'I already went. Anna's back too! She's better, I think, better than she was last time she came back.'
Dean and Castiel both crossed their arms at the wrists and grabbed each other's hands, then they lowered their makeshift sling and let Sam clamber on. They straightened up, lifting a delighted Sam to peer through the fence. 'There it is, Sammy, see it?' Dean nodded at the creature, which emerged from behind the rocks, a hulking dog-like shape covered in spotted fur, with a hunched back and a dark tufted tail. A hyena, John thought. Sam looked at the hyena and Dean looked at Sam. The look of wonder on Sammy's face was really something. John almost didn't notice the look of wonder on Dean's.
'Mark. Bill. George. John.'
Cas froze and a barrier went up behind his eyes. Dean's heart thudded in his ears. Cas finally spoke, at a normal volume. 'If that's the big fucking deal then I'm sorry I ever did it.'
The sudden lack of sound as the coffee finished dripping broke him out of his thoughts. He pulled out a mug (“NOT PAINT WATER,” it said) and glanced at the clock as he took a sip, scalding his tongue. This was the point in the morning where his breakfast was usually finished, but he hadn't made any. He recalculated his arrival time at work factoring in a stop at the café en route. He swore his subconscious regularly made him late on purpose so he could treat himself to Gabriel's pastries. Thinking about it, he factored in an extra ten minutes for breakfast because it would take a miracle for Gabe to relinquish a captive audience in less than five.
The whiskey made Dean's head swim. He felt warmth spread in pulses to the tips of his fingers. Everything felt better and easier to ignore. Whatever was bothering him went fuzzy and blurry and danced over to a place in his brain that he knew he'd have to concentrate to reach. He didn't concentrate. The stars were really beautiful. He looked up at them and felt himself tipping backwards. Cas caught him.
'Hey, I don't judge, you know, whatever freak flag you like to fly.'
Dean thought about it. 'How much dynamite, exactly?'
'Hey, I got you boys presents. A little late, I know.' John reached into the bag resting on one of the chairs and pulled out two packages wrapped in green and red paper. He handed one to Dean, who unpicked the taped edges. It was a set of strangely-shaped magnetic toys. A bit young for him, which gave Dean a pang in his chest, but it was the thought that counted. Dean did used to enjoy these kinds of building-block toys.
'Thank you,' says Cas, yawning, 'I really didn't want to drive back to Michael's.'
Bobby squints at Dean. 'Don't be thinkin' I'm gonna be runnin' all over the place like some cocktail waitress, boy.' Dean waits, still smiling. 'I wouldn't complain if you made chocolate chip zucchini  bread though,' Bobby mutters. Dean's grin widens and he claps Bobby on the back.
'Oh. Yeah. I should be offering you a refill, you're the guest.'
“It's fine, it's a town. Cute place.” Dean shrugged. “Why?”
Cas wiped at his split lip and decided to humour him. 'Not even you believe that.'
Dean doesn't look at him, just flops down into a chair and sips his black coffee. “Nope.”
'Well, I - How do you know about that?'
Dean looked around and lunged to smack the button on the toaster before the fire alarms went off. The last time Cas had cooked the whole bunker had gone into lockdown and the sprinklers in the kitchen had soaked all the food. Cas stared at the blackened toast like it had personally let him down. Dean chucked the toast into the bin and loaded the toaster with fresh bread.
“Alright, it should be...on the left somewhere....” Sam craned his neck around to look, and then pointed. “There!”
John looked stricken, but his voice came out as a growl. 'You watch your tone, Dean.'
Anna laughed. 'You're such a cynic.' She drained her mug and got up to pay. 'I'll get this one.'
“Aw, your one deal-breaker.”
As they pull up out front, Sam and Jess crane their necks to see out the window. Cas is leaning against the front door, underneath the wooden sign saying:
) then drew Dean inside and closed the door. Dean offered him the bottle. Cas took a swig and coughed. 'Ack. That is not pleasant.'
Dean drives home from the airport, reveling in the feeling of being back in his own car. He pats the dashboard. 'That hatchback didn't mean anything, baby.' He puts in a cassette (yes, he still uses cassettes, so sue him) and turns the volume up, relaxing into the sounds of his own familiar music. The late afternoon sun streams in through the windows, slanting across the air in the car, making Dean feel peaceful and safe, light flickering through the trees on either side of the road. When Dean drives, all of his thoughts blow out the back windows and he doesn't need to think, doesn't need to feel anything, he just needs to exist. All he has to do is steer. He sees his father's face in every passing car.
'Get out!' Silence. 'I mean it, Cas! Get the hell out.'
'Hello.' Holy shit. Did the guy gargle rocks for breakfast?
Add pecans and mix the wet and dry ingredients. Stir roughly. Breathe.
'You're probably right,' Chuck tells him gloomily. 'You wouldn't believe the fruit abomination at the back of the staff fridge I found the other day.'
The slanderous words remained unsaid, though not unshaped.
Cold morning light streamed in through Sam's window. As soon as he opened his eyes, he felt wide awake with excitement. He threw back the covers, barely shivering in the draft, and bounced out of bed. He threw his door open and nearly tripped on a bulging stocking right outside, the one his mom had made him with his name stitched on the front. Sam's first thought was that Dad must have come home in the night. He raced to his dad's room, where he was brought up short by an empty, made bed. His brow furrowed in confusion. Maybe dad left again early this morning. That sometimes happened, but he usually came in and woke Sam up with a whiskery (often-boozy) kiss on the forehead. Sam shrugged and ran to Dean's room, narrowly avoiding crushing Dean's stocking. He burst through the door and launched himself at Dean's bed.
Dean groaned. 'I hate thinking.'
Dean cleared his throat. He wanted to hit something. 'Come on, we'll be late.' He didn't look at Cas.
“I'll say. And he was so gorgeous, too. It was a real tragedy.”
Dean perked up as Sam walked to the door. “Now there's an idea I can get behind!” He threw Sam the keys.
Dean gaped at the phone, then looked at Sam, dumbfounded. 'What - ?' Understanding spread across Sam's face and he started laughing.
Dean scowled and turned his collar up. 'Shut up. It's not like that. It's just...'
“And father,” Castiel reminded him.
Dean sipped his coffee. 'Just go with your gut.'
'Do you mind if I go to Jess' for dinner?'
'He's home now, I think.' Sam looked at him hopefully. 'Please, Cas? You know he won't talk to me.'
'What's up with him?' Dean hears Kevin ask Chuck, who frowns and shakes his head. Dean winks at them and bends to check the tarts in the oven once more before lunch.
Dean gives him the once over. He looks deceptively sweet, there's no other way to put it. He's a few inches shorter than Dean, slim build, with a twinkle in his eye. Dean likes the guy's confidence; he knows he's not exactly approachable. The broad shoulders, height, and overshirt usually put people off. This guy looks...mischievous. Like one of those pictures of the goblins from the books Dean's mother read him when he was young. He decides to play along. He wiggles his shot glass and raises his eyebrows. 'Shots. Blow jobs.'
Castiel thinks for a moment. 'Well. It's like handling fire. You're shaping this burning-hot lump of molten glass, and you know that it could shatter at any time, or burn you badly, but if you stick it out and try hard enough, it ends up as this beautiful thing that you shaped with only your breath.'
'No, I heard you, but what? I mean – what do you make? How does one...become a glassblower, exactly?'
Crowley grinned wolfishly. 'I like it. His dad the big hot-shot writer. Taking them down a peg wouldn't hurt.'
His dad is waiting for him out on a nearby ridge with Sam, both with drinks in hand - beer for Dad; root beer for Sam. They’ve been eating pizza while they wait. Dean scoops up a slice as he joins them and finds that it’s gone a little cold.
“Urgh,” Sam said with great feeling.
Dean led Marlene to the display of scented candles, pointed out the ones he was referring to, and then nodded and made polite humming noises as Marlene proceeded to describe in great detail each of the specific personality and aesthetic flaws that her niece possessed that were inhibiting her search for the perfect man. About the time Marlene said, “and she keeps her hair far too short,” right after, “she only spends time with female friends, never even trying to date,” Dean began to suspect that Marlene’s desire to see her niece bonded forever in heterosexual matrimonial bliss may have been doomed to failure, candles or no candles.
Dean turns and leaves the mission and resolutely does not look back.
Dean stared at him for a moment.
“You’re such a jerk,” he complained.
“It’s 2005!” he shrieked.
On the other side of the wall that separated Sam’s bedroom from Dean’s, a similar storm was brewing.
“Sure will,” Dean lied. “So what is it this time?” He did his very, very best to keep the irritation out of his tone.
“You would say that, poindexter.”
“I’ve thought all I need to,” he said. “It’s nearly all I’ve done since...since Mary was killed. It’s time to do more than think. That’s why I came to you.” He took a sip, grimaced, then glanced away, toward the kitchen.
Dean forced a loud laugh, mostly to stop himself from saying, ‘I suggest you mind your own friggin' business, lady.’
He made sure to slip a vaccine brochure into her bag. It was probably a lost cause, but hey. They had about a million of the things.
Abruptly, he drew up short.
“I know,” Missouri sighed. “I wish we didn’t fight, either. I just care too much about you boys to keep my mouth shut.” She shook her head. “My two Winchesters.”
Sam accepted the drink gratefully. He wondered how long the nightmare had gone on that Dean had had time to be woken by it and then to go boil water. It had felt like only a few minutes, but now that he was awake it wore on him like it had been years. Sam shook himself and took a sip.
“Alright,” she acquiesced at last. “I’ll watch them for you. But only for a little while, John. Do you hear me? Whatever fool errand you’re thinking of, you’d better come back from it quick.”
Dean forces an easy grin and tells him, “Just that the Red Sox are gonna win the World Series.”
“None that I’ve ever met,” his dad says. His eyes narrow in sudden suspicion. “Why? Did one of them say something to you?”
“Quit playing games,” Sam said, “and just tell me what you
“Nah,” Dean said. “It says here that the
“You do? Who are you friends with? Why do I not know any of your friends? Sam?”
The table resounded with laughter.
“Uh-huh,” Bobby said. “I’m surprised about that, too. Thought your daddy would’a taught you all about ‘em.”
“His car,” he finally said.
“Yeah,” Sam said again, “that sounds like Dad.”
He unloads a round of rocksalt straight into her face.
“I’ve already broken many of heaven’s decrees,” Castiel says. “For you.”
kind of magic store.
The stock itself was an eclectic mix of new age junk shamelessly ripping off a variety of cultures, a wide range of items (from tiny to furniture-sized) that may or may not have had actual magical value, and, here and there, if you knew where to look, everything necessary for a real honest-to-goodness spell. The really rare (and weird) stuff was kept in the back or under the locked glass counter, of course. And at the front, near the door, was a small display of trick card packs and vanishing coins, because people kept coming in thinking it was
That was the impulse, the need that led to the first and last time Dean purposely, intentionally cast magic.
“Escapably indisposed, I’m afraid,” Dean said.
Sam’s hands tightened around the steering wheel, then relaxed again.
“That’s my girl,” Missouri said proudly.
“Dean!” Sam shouted. “Stay away!”
“Just you wait,” she tells him with a nasty grin. “Just you wait and see.”
“Yeah, and I’m really freaking out right now!” Sam said. “It’s hers. Marlene’s. She bled in my mouth. She said -”
“I guess we just have to wait and see,” Sam said. “Maybe it was just one dream. Maybe we’re getting worked up about nothing.”
With a flick of Marlene’s wrist, Sam went flying backward, up against the wall. The salt shaker dropped from his hand and spilled in a pool across the floor at his feet. His head banged up against the plaster and his ears began to ring as the air was nearly choked from his lungs by the force of the strike. He struggled to break free, but there were invisible bonds keeping him paralyzed in place several inches above the floor. He was stuck.
Sam said nothing, only wailed harder. On the floor was the toy - definitely a truck - with one of its metal doors twisted at an odd angle. It had nearly snapped off, leaving a jagged edge which must have caught the fat of Sam’s hand.
“If anyone ever needed a therapist more than a psychic, it’s that woman,” Missouri said. “I’m half-tempted to tell her not to bother when she comes in for a reading. She never takes good advice.”
“Two, in fact,” Dean said. “Anyway, we have kind of a situation here, and our dad isn’t answering his phone. We were hoping you could tell us how we can reach him.”
Sam nodded.
“Is Dad coming back?” he asked.
Sam huffed a soft laugh, and followed her back toward the kitchen.
“Yahtzee,” Dean says, and pulls the remains out.
Us canonized for Love.’
What the hell does she know? What the hell?
Our legend be, it will be fit for verse…’
Sam’s gaze slipped from the mug he held, down to the hands that held it and then up, along his bare arms, both of them covered in colorful tattoos of intertwining sigils and magical designs - the little green snakes that twisted up to his knuckles; the string of wide, staring eyes that climbed up his left forearm, each one paired with a single letter; the menacing, many-headed dragon that stretched itself along his right bicep, its shining scales imbued with something frozen and burning. The large set of black ink seals that sat on his shoulders like brands.
Sam was still a little annoyed that Dean had wanted to call him about the dream. As if Sam hadn’t put considerable effort into keeping as much of his life a secret from their dad as possible. He hadn’t been there, not for any of it. He didn’t have the right to judge Sam for his decisions, even the bad ones. So what if this had something to do with their mom’s death? Sam had never met her. He barely knew their dad. As far as he was concerned, the only family he needed to involve in this had been there on that hot June day four years ago, watching as Sam accepted his diploma.
It is, Dean thinks.
“Just give me a minute, Sam,” Dean had snapped. “I'm trying to watch -”
It had been two weeks since Sam’s dreams had started, and they hadn’t let up. Every night he went to bed, only to be tormented by the same vision - his brother pinned to the ceiling, blood dripping from a wound in his stomach, and then - fire. When he woke up in the early hours one morning, jolted awake by his fifteenth consecutive nightmare, Sam wasn’t surprised at all to find Dean already in the kitchen awake and cooking. They were both starting to feel the strain.
Sam focused on his breathing, on the feeling of her palms against his skin, warm and soft. His own eyes slowly closed as they fell into harmony with one another. Missouri made a small, thoughtful humming sound, but Sam could barely hear it.
Dean’s reaction to this declaration - shocked dismay - must be written plainly on his face, because Castiel explains bitterly, “Sacrificing yourself for the people you love is what you do, Dean. As you would put it, it’s your ‘M.O.’ That’s the whole problem. That’s the whole -” He scowls. “I wish you would stop.”
Dean scoffed.
“All your hovering is doing is making me want to strangle you myself,” Sam said. He closed the book and set it down. “Honestly. I promise I’ll be fine for one day.”
Silence reigned for a short while, the streetlights slipping in and out of the truck’s cab as they went past the only thing that punctuated their stillness.
“It means they’re in hell,” his dad responded.
“I do not!”
“Last month,” Sam helpfully provided. “September, 2005. It’s October, now. The 26th.”
Possibly, he wouldn’t need any of these things, now or ever. That would’ve been a-okay with Dean. Even so, he’d sleep better knowing they were within grabbing distance.
But he can’t promise that he’ll stop like Castiel wants him to. He knows himself better than that. The look Castiel gives him is as knowing as it is displeased.
He’d picked up much more than that, Missouri could tell. Perceptive little boy. It might save him some trouble in the long run - or get him into more. Only time would tell.
“Hey Missouri,” he said brightly, trying for casual and landing somewhere in the neighborhood of ultra suspicious.
“You guys aren’t having money trouble, are you?” Tess asked with a hint of worry. “I know the convention in Kansas City didn’t draw in as much traffic this year. Steven was complaining to me about it the other day.”
“A few hundred,” Missouri repeated. “Every now and again.”
“Since Dad is a paranoid bastard and I had a sixteenth birthday,” Dean said. “And I'm not saying we shoot Bobby. Just...suggest with the threat of violence that he back off a bit should the need arise. No one has to get hurt.”
They were in another motel room. John had gone out to use the payphone and Dean had climbed up on the chair to watch him through the window, trying to figure out if this meant their dad had caught another job, if he was leaving again. Dean didn't know how to read lips, but he was trying to work out a method on the fly.
Dean looked down at the box in his hands, then up at Sam.
“You find anything yet?” he asked.
Frantically, he begins to search.
Dean has kissed plenty of people before - countless women, a few forcefully forgotten men. It’s never quite been like this. This is both a memory and a revelation. It is familiar. It is brand new. It feels like coming home, and Dean hardly even knows what that means, even now. He spent thirty years without one. Now here it is: He comes home. He comes home and Castiel is there to greet him.
“That’s you, Dean.”
Maybe Marlene’s niece could use it to get rid of Marlene. If not, well, at least they were nice smelling candles.
Steven hummed happily as he accepted the box, opening the lid and wiggling his fingers over it as he made his selection.
“I have an important job to do,” John would always tell Dean when he left. “There are things out there that other people don't understand. Bad things. One of them hurt your mom, and I have to stop it from hurting anyone else. Do you understand?”
The next afternoon, as Sam and Dean sat in the back room pouring through books about dreams and dream interpretation, the bell over the door of Rising Sun Magic Supply chimed. They both looked up and listened for voices in the store. When they heard nothing except for the muffled sound of footsteps, Sam held out his left arm and pressed his right index finger over the tattooed eye marked with a red letter ‘S.’
“What’s going on?” Sam asked, trying to climb into Dean’s lap so that he could see what was happening. “What are they saying?”
The dead nun says to Dean, “They killed us for love. Someday they'll do the same to you.”
There was no response.
“Take it,” Missouri said, offering it to him again. “Maybe it’ll calm you down. Make you think about things a little harder.”
“Dean,” Sam had called from somewhere behind him. “It broke.”
“Plus,” Sam went on, “he didn't know we - I was a witch when he helped us out.”
“Bobby Singer?” Dean asked.
As a child, barely more than a toddler himself, there wasn't much he could take control of in that regard. He had to rely on Missouri for everything they needed. She let Dean help out, especially with the easy tasks - this is how you mix his formula, this is how you change his diaper, this is how you burp him after he eats - but there was no getting around the fact of their dependence on her. Still, Dean was resolved that he would watch over Sam. He would master these tasks to the highest possible degree, and then some. Dean would do whatever necessary to keep his little brother safe.
“Since Metatron...nevermind,” Castiel says. He looks away, clearly embarrassed. “Forget I said anything.”
If not, he’s in trouble - his hand is shaking as he draws the salt line along the floor in front of the door. He spills too much. By the time he’s finished with the window, there’s barely any left in the container. Definitely not enough to salt another room.
“You know, I was just reading an article a friend sent me about rates of autism -” she began.
“- clouded intent,” Dean finished with a grumble. “It's cooking, not magic.”
“There,” he said. “All better.”
Dean stared up at the ceiling, not answering, brows furrowed into a tight knot.
But Missouri had heard plenty of men swear to her before. They’d all meant it, too. It hadn’t made a difference in the end.
“Not a lot,” Dean said defensively. “Just a few hundred every now and again.”
Dean obeys.
For some reason, more than anything he’s ever killed, more than any body he’s ever burned, this feels like desecration.
He squinted at them, like he was fishing for an answer. No one was really sure if Steven was actually the mixed up time traveler he acted like he was, or if he just had an uncanny knack for being both very punctual and very confused.
“Instant death.”
Dean shrugged and reopened ‘Wandering Spirits: Chen Shiyuan’s Encyclopedia of Dreams.’
Even after all these years, even to Castiel, he finds himself unable to confess the whole truth. The nun had meant, they will kill you for having loved. Their hate will be poison in your ears until it is poison in your mouth. They will do it to you because you are a man who loves other men.
Dean examines the side of his face for a long moment, then looks away, too. He hasn’t thought about that in a long time. His first hunt. The poem. The nuns.
“If only,” Missouri said. “It would certainly make my life simpler. Although not even that could help some of my clients. Lord have mercy.”
They both blinked at him for a surprised moment, and then Dean’s felt his face split into a broad smile of genuine delight.
“Is something going to happen?” Steven barked. “Ha!
“I had a weird dream,” Sam said.
Dean had been banned from his after orchestrating the unofficial senior prank. He'd broken into the school after hours and plastered the hallways with photos of the vice principal kissing a woman who was definitely not his wife. There hadn't been enough evidence to charge Dean with any crime, but everyone had agreed it was for the best for Dean to just take his diploma and go all the same.
Dean groaned.
Sam sucked in a breath and stumbled backward a step. The strange sense of unreality that had gripped him the moment he’d seen her face went careening rapidly back into fear.
“‘Lo?” a tired voice answered. “You know what time it is?”
Together. At peace.
“Nah, she’d probably just start blaming everything on demons,” Sam said. “Like those Christian mom advocacy groups who say hair metal is the work of the devil.”
Missouri watched the car pull away from the curb, listened to its rumble as it disappeared down the street and around the corner, off into the night and the universe at large. Then she turned to look back at the two small children still sitting at her table. Dean stared up at her, his small face filled with uncertainty.
He remembers fragments of things that he has been trying desperately to ignore, all of them crawling back to the surfaces now, as if summoned to stand and take sacrament. Dean remembers an abruptly met gaze, like a lightning bolt out of the blue, like a gut punch in a crowded bar, and there’s no way to respond without pulling the whole room into chaos, into a brawl. All he can do is tear his eyes away and hope desperately that no one else has seen.
“I’m adding that one to the list of things that will keep me up at night,” Dean said. He stood up and went into the kitchen to fetch them both a couple of well-earned beers. “Guess all we have to do now is keep our heads down and hope no one notices.”
“Bit slow on the uptake, aren’t we?” the demon said. It began stepping slowly toward him. “Someone’s been skipping Daddy’s lessons. Or maybe it’s the other way around. Missed a couple birthdays, has he?”
“Don’t laugh,” Dean said. “It’ll be you next time.”
Sam nodded, but it didn’t quite rid him of the unsettled feeling in his gut.
If you're curious, Artemidorus says that dreaming about not having eyebrows is a sign of "impending misery."
He swallows.
“It said,” he began hesitantly, “that the ritual I tried when I was a teenager...this wasn't about that.”
“Missouri,” Dean pleaded, sounding betrayed.
She screams and dissipates and Dean turns on his heels and runs.
Her eyes slipped shut.
John nodded and shook her hand one last time.
“Just a simple spell,” Ted had explained, “to stop small wounds from stinging. Dead useful when you get as many paper cuts as Zara does. All it takes is a lot of intent, a little innate talent, and a couple of simple words.” Then he winked.
Castiel hums.
“That’s not what the ghost meant, anway,” Dean says, if only to change the subject. “She meant that other people would be so disgusted by it that it would kill me.”
He turned on the light and shook himself, trying to rid himself of the cloying sense of deja vu. Nothing had happened. Nothing was amiss. There was no one here. Had he just imagined the sounds? Was it just his nerves and the lack of sleep playing with his mind? Dean was out at the bar, safely out of harm’s way, and everything in his room was exactly as he’d left it, down to the -
“Thanks, Dad,” Dean says.
The laughter turned to groans.
The door snapped shut, and Sam was left alone to sip his tea and try to forget the dead-eyed look on dream Dean’s face just before the fire had consumed him. He hoped that it really had been just a nightmare. The alternative was that they were in trouble. Dean was in danger. And if it involved the thing that had killed Mom, then…
“Bobby's?” Sam repeated. “Dad’s hunting buddy that you talked to for all of fifteen minutes? Why would you want to visit him?”
He tried to bury the dreadful feeling in his stomach that was telling him it wasn’t - that it was all ruined, again, and this time it was Dean’s fault.
“What do you want?” he asked.
Sam shrugged.
Dean spotted the top of her enormous head of blonde curls bobbing along down the aisle filled with statues and miniatures (from porcelain angels, to stone buddhas, to brass chinthe, all the way down to carved jade zhulong). He hastened to catch up to her, lest she decide to pick up some poor glass fairy figurine and accidentally snap its delicate wings off. She’d broken sturdier items in her time as a regular, and never with much sympathy or remorse.
‘Now they are with the worms that do not die,’ one letter surmises.
“What else could it be?” Sam shrugged.
Dean frowned, but said nothing in response.
I also updated the summary to better reflect the trajectory of the plot.
“Yes, yes it will,” Dean said, snatching the money up. “Alright, let me grab my jacket.”
“Alright, take a seat,” Missouri said. “Get comfortable. I want to get a nice clear picture of what’s going on inside your head.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Yeah, I know.”
Sam stared at him, flabbergasted.
“We have to call him,” Dean said. At Sam’s opening mouth he went on, “Don’t argue with me, Sam. There is only one person we know who is even remotely qualified to handle this, and it’s Dad. We don’t have any other choice.”
“Do you like sugar with your tea?” Missouri asked the little boy sitting at her kitchen table, a baby cradled in his arms.
For several long minutes, she sat quietly in the living room, finishing her own tea, studiously not listening to the low conversation happening in her kitchen. What was she going to do with these two boys? She could hardly mind the one she had. And James - James wasn’t going to be happy about this.
“James!” she snapped. “What did I just hear come out of your mouth?”
Sam stopped in front of the closed door, heart hammering, head ringing. He took a deep, steadying breath, trying to push down the threatening panic, then pushed the door open and looked inside.
“Dean!” Sam and Dede both said at the same time, breaking off their conversation.
“Not really,” Sam said, but he let the matter of the gun drop.
Sam and Dean shared a grin. They both loved watching James being scolded.
“I haven’t seen her in a couple of months myself, though,” Missouri said. “I guess something else caught her attention.” Her eyes twinkled and she winked at Sam.
Chapter title is 'Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap' by AC/DC. 'Hysteria' by Def Leppard is a Destiel THEME, though.
Dean didn't do witchcraft. Not like Sam.
“Huh,” he said. “The ancient Greeks just had, like, no hobbies, I guess.”
He’d always known that his dad and Missouri fought sometimes, no matter how hard they tried to hide it from him, but the fight they had after that day was the only time he ever heard them yelling. Dean watched from the backseat of the Impala as John and Missouri had it out on the front steps of her house, words indistinct but the matching looks of fury on their faces clear as day.
“Cheer up,” Dean said. “I'm sure Dad would've gotten you one too if you'd asked.” His gaze turned knowing. “Besides - don’t think I didn’t see you palm your athame on the way out the door. You’re just as armed as I am right now.”
“That was rude,” it said. “She’s still in here, Sam. Are you really gonna spit on a lady? Even an obnoxious old windbag like this one?”
'In that supply closet. I left the door open.'
'Nice to meet you too,' Castiel said, oddly formal for someone under ten. 'Dean talks about you a lot.'
When he woke in the morning, he sat bolt upright on his sleeping mat and scanned the room for Anael so fast it nearly gave him whiplash. 'Was it a dream?' he thought frantically. Jimmy and the others were still asleep, breathing deeply. But Anael wasn't there. Horrible dread crawled up his arms and lodged in the dark of his imagination. That knife had been so sharp. Where was she?
He knew he wasn't the Dean he had once been, he knew it. But now it came to him that the changes he saw were entirely self-made. Was the Dean in the dark window really who he wanted to be? Could he change it all? Somehow erase the metallic militant glint in his eyes? Put down his heavy anger and sand down the spiteful roughness of his edges? He took a step back, looked at the painting again. For a second, he was Cas, looking at his best friend laughing. He took another step back and bumped against the light switch, which rocked a tiny bit but didn't turn on. Dean turned and stared at it. He was tired of sneaking around in the dark. Without letting himself think he reached out and flipped it up. He was blinded by the sudden brightness. He couldn't see out the window anymore but he knew the lawn would be lit up, knew he was visible from the house now, knew Crowley and Bela would be hoofing it back to the car. He put the sketchbook down and waited for Cas.
'Thank you,' he says quietly, and takes the tray without looking at Dean. He begins piling on cups and saucers.
'Yeah. He thinks...home. Didn't want to.... Did you...my stocking?' Silence. 'Cas...didn't have to.'
'Jo, you should stay at mine until Ellen's back. You're not really in a fit state to drive yourself to work.'
'God yes! If you're sure it's okay?'
'Hi.' His voice wasn't candy-coated, it was wide open and welcoming. 'That looks fun.'
'Yep.'
'Dean? Are you hearing me?'
Sam's face lit up. 'Alright, let's go!'
'Fag,' she spat. Meg and Alastair surfaced long enough to stare, then went back to sucking face. Dean didn't flinch. It was like someone throwing a pebble at the Trojan horse. The ridiculousness of it made him laugh. It felt so good to find something genuinely funny that he only laughed harder.
Later, he woke up again, groggy. He could tell it was later because the light from the window looked different. What had woken him? His eyes fluttered closed and he was almost asleep again when he heard a noise from outside his room. He tensed, but relaxed when he heard Dean swear quietly. Just before he dozed off again, he could have sworn he heard Cas' voice and another boy's mingling with Dean's.
Sam gave Cas a hug. 'Yeah, Cas. Is Anna coming too?'
As the gear shift shivered in his grip with the chugging of the engine, Castiel pictured strangers next door colonising the old porch swing, altering the eternal smell of tiger balm and herbs in the house. He'd miss the kindly presence next door, the music floating through the windows, the warm glow of friendship and belonging. Castiel's stomach growled and he had to suppress a feeling of loss. It wasn't as if she was going far. She'd still be nearby.
A peculiar calm settled like icing sugar over Castiel as he entered the café. The bell over the door chimed brightly and Gabe's voice rang out from the back.
a sly inner voice asked.
“Did Dean go on a beer run?” He knows what a beer run is, and it loosely translates to 'unexpected absence.'
'Gabe? Seriously? I didn't know he played.'
'Hey!' Dean says, and plants one on Cas' lips (Look, everyone, look what I can do.) 'Cas, this is Bobby, and Sam, and Jess.'
'He'll be here, Sammy. Promise.'
'Actually, I was all for it. We need to talk, Dean, just us.'
'Everyone's got a weak spot.'
The corners of Dean's eyes crinkled and when he opened his mouth to speak Sam felt their conversation click into a familiar place. 'Mhmm. And how many have you missed?'
'You're rude.'
He felt Cas' hand on his shoulder leading him out of the way of the rushing students. 'Dean?'
'Yes.'
'They're called gesture drawings. They take literally 30 seconds to draw.'
Sam gives Dean a look. 'You know, Dean, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to...you know. I mean, don't let me keep you. You guys looked like you were hitting it off.'
There are mutual anxious-to-please smiles. 'Hello,' Cas says. 'Dean's told me so much about all of you. Congratulations to you two, by the way.'
“What about the town?”
Dean twists himself around to look straight at Cas. 'I never seriously considered it. You know, as an actual...possibility.'
'Oh. Uh, no. I have a backseat full of bread. I'm about to take it to the shelter downtown. Thinking about it, actually, I don't know how to get there. Should've thought that through.'
Dean sat down on the bed, his brain still trying to wrap itself around 'romantic interest.' He was roiling with embarrassment and had absolutely no idea what to do in this situation but Cas was obviously sincere and Dean felt sort of responsible when it came to Cas' haplessness about being human. Dean would be damned if he let Cas down. He wouldn't let his discomfort make Cas uncomfortable. He took a deep breath. Where to even start? First (and easiest) things first.
Dean cranes his neck and they make their way through the heavy wooden door. They put the machine down on top of a stack of boxes and Dean wipes sweat from his brow. Cas' eyes track the movement. There's a forcefulness there that Dean hasn't seen before. It seems to occur to both of them simultaneously that they're alone in a small room. Their breath mixes in the air, and Dean feels slightly dizzy. Cas takes a step forward; he reaches out and wipes a drop of sweat from Dean's temple. Electricity crackles. Dean lifts a tentative hand and slowly runs it along Cas' arm. Cas' skin is cool and soothing against Dean's palm. Is it just him or are Cas' eyes about four shades darker than they usually are?
As he approached Dean's door he thought he heard Dean mumble something. Fuck it? Fuck this? He knocked and opened the door. Dean stuffed something out of sight into one of the books on his desk.
Dean huffs a surprised laugh and looks at Cas. He waits, expecting to recoil from the pity in Cas' eyes, but he doesn't find any. Cas is staring at him intently and the burn of his gaze is a relief to Dean. There's nothing there but strength and thoughtfulness. Dean can't look away. He knows it's all wrong – they're sitting on the floor in a closet, Dean is shaky from a panic attack, his face still burns where Cas slapped the air back into him – but he also knows that the wrongness of it all isn't enough to stop him. Things don't always line up perfectly like ingredients in a recipe. Not all lives can be a series of events that come one after the other like beads on a string. Sometimes life hands you a fistful of madness and a fistful of joy together, and you take them both because that's all you can do in a world where madness and joy are too often two sides of the same coin. So when Dean leans forward and kisses Cas with all the strength he has left, he doesn't know if it's madness or joy. Or both. When Cas breathes a noise into his mouth and kisses him back, though, he thinks he might be figuring it out.
'What magazine?'
Every place has secrets, of course, but the most fascinating and powerful secrets of Birch Ridge were not kept by its people. The town kept its own secrets like buried childhood toys. When someone stumbled into one, as they did on occasion, they, like their parents and grandparents before them, learned to look the other way. They shrugged and accepted it as 'just another one of those things' and continued living their lives secure in the knowledge that sometimes it's best to leave strange enough alone.
“I'm not hungry.” He's not full either. He figures he can wait until they get back to the bunker.
It wasn't poetic and frilled with complex concepts. It wasn't remarkable or violent. There was no hallelujah chorus, no bright light, no gasp of 'Eureka!' It was quick, and clean, and complete. Dean felt the bricks of the wall around his heart shift and break. The structure made of sex and avoidance and denial cracked open and collapsed. Some sort of compassion flooded through him. It was like a rush of cool water. He felt unusually alert. Details jumped out at him. The tiny balls of lint that clung to the corduroy fabric of the couch. The dust motes that floated through the air. Every point where his shirt touched his skin. His mind took hold of the thought that Dean was a bad, broken person, bundled it up, and put it in a bin labeled 'Nonsense.' And once that was done, Dean saw that the lines between what he should want and what he did want were imaginary. And he didn't want this.
Anna looked determined. 'That's reason enough! Technically it counts as studying. Okay!' She clapped. 'Come on, you're going to get your fortune told. I'll spot you the 20 bucks just to see the look on your face.'
Dean cast his eyes around the shed and they landed on the box of fireworks and dynamite. Cas' eyes followed Dean's.
He pressed his face into his pillow as embarrassment, shame, and nausea ran through him in equal measures. He groaned. He couldn't remember anything after that. He must have walked home and stumbled up to his bed somehow. He sat up, head spinning and face thumping in pain. Had Cas gotten home alright? He looked reflexively at the window, squinting against the light. He stood up shakily and noticed his near-nudity. His clothes from last night were strewn around his room. He stumbled to the window and screwed up his face against the sun. He could see into Cas' room: the bed was filled with a Cas-shaped bulge, a mop of black hair protruding from haphazard covers. Good. Dean could go back to feeling like a needy, disgusting freak without worrying.
That perked Sam up. 'Are you sure?'
'Me either. Full of surprises, I suppose.'
'A glassblower. Someone who - '
Cas and Dean both felt the same way about their parents, even though they didn't speak about it. Realizing that parents are ordinary humans who make mistakes and break promises was a cold shock, like waking up in the middle of the night to a loud noise or missing a step in the dark. It might have been because of this that Dean found himself clinging to Cas like a lifeline. They took the broken parts of themselves that didn't fit into their respective families and tried to glue them together into something else.
The unpleasant memories of the morning disappeared as Castiel stepped out and brushed himself off, thinking of the birds that would have a field day with his fallen crumbs. He didn't bother locking the car before he went in; The Nursery was set back from the road and, really, no one ever worried about locking their doors properly in Birch Ridge.
'Don't take it personally, she wanted to see them anyway. That's Jess,' Sam says fondly, 'always thoughtful to a fault.'
'Alright, hit me with some chemistry.'
'I shouldn't have to show you this, you've been here long enough. Didn't you do this with Rachel?' Castiel responds so quietly Dean can't hear him. 'Well. I have too much to do here, I don't have time to babysit you. Here, you dust, I'll vacuum.'
And then, before Cas can move, Sam stomps around the corner and nearly falls over him. Sam looks like a prey animal frozen in shock. His eyes are wider than Cas has ever seen them. “Cas. Cas, I – ”
'I know.'
Dean didn't mind the mad scramble to catch up before the school year started. The high school buildings were open for summer school, so Dean and Benny came in to try to bring Dean up to speed. He had gone to school when he was at Sonny's, so it wasn't like he was that far behind anyway. He liked the way readjusting to school and life back in Lawrence gave him something to focus on. Underneath it all, though, he felt confused. He knew he should be glad to be back home, but instead he just felt like a bombed-out city. Everything in him was on fire, screaming, collapsing around his ears. Some days he could hardly hear for the sounds of crashing timbers and tearing metal. He knew he deserved it. He'd messed up. He had lost their money in a stupid gamble, had tried to shoplift some food, and he had been caught.
'It's not your fault, Dean, accidents happen. It's no big.'
'Don't be such an idiot. How can you
“Anna?” he whispered. “Are you okay?”
'Started the party without me?' Dean gives Cas a quick back-thumping hug.
'Keep telling yourself that, hon.'
'Up here, somehow, it feels easier to breathe. Although that makes no sense. The air is technically thinner.' Cas sits down against the mesh barrier. Dean hands him the cake, and leans his elbows against the railing. He closes his eyes and leans his head back into the wind. His head spins. When it settles everything feels calm and still. The wind bites through his jacket. He feels free. The cars make a steady rumbling noise underneath them. After a minute or two, Dean opens his eyes. Castiel is looking at him, his eyes wide. Dean turns and slides down the barrier, sitting next to Cas, and pulls a fork out of his pocket. He hands it to Cas, who finally looks away to take it.
'You ARE. I'll come say hi but I actually came to get you. Come over for a bit.' Cas perked up at the suggestion and Dean couldn't hold back a smile. A nice smile this time, although it would go back to a teasing one A.S.A.P. because holy hell, Cas in a themed sweater was hysterical.
'Three fifty.'
'Cas, why were you reading Cosmo? Where did you even find it?'
'You get started on the presents, okay? I'm going to pour us some cereal.'
'What the hell?' Cas spluttered. 'Seriously, Dean?'
'I'm not sure. We'll be gone until Anna gets better, I guess.' Cas sighed, dropped the socks into his suitcase, and sat down next to Sam on the bed. 'My mom just wants us to be closer to Anna so we can visit her more often.'
Anna, who was blushing furiously, managed to stutter out, 'Uh..well...it's not for me, it's...this is my brother, Castiel.'
'I'm not an idiot, Dean. I know that look.'
Cas flicked his wrist and the terrifying mass of fur slid several feet to the right. Dean gave it the once-over as Cas left. As far as bad gifts went, this one was his favorite. After the initial heart-stopping terror.
'Sounds tough.'
'We thought you might need babying,' Jo grins, and she lugs her bags into the kitchen, past a rather stunned Dean.
Dean shook his head. 'Y'know, Cas, I'm all for you going Better Homes and Gardens on the place but none of us are going to remember to water that thing.'
Bela spun the can with nimble fingers. Dean watched the flashing metal skitter across the floor and knew it would land on him before it had even slowed down. He felt it in his gut. He wasn't mistaken.
'Sorry.' Dean says again, and tilts his head. There's an awkward silence. He doesn't know what to say. Fuck it. He's never been one for beating around the bush. Sam calls him tactless. 'You been avoiding me, Cas?'
'You don't know Dean. He won't come around unless you force him. I just hoped that...that Dean would go back to normal once Cas was here again.'
'I've ruined you, now you'll never like a Bartholomew.'
'Didn't eat my Wheaties this morning.'
The first greenhouse was for seedlings. Trays upon trays of seeds, bags of compost, peat, perlite, lime, calcium, rocks. Soaked husks cracking open, tiny roots emerging and drinking, the first signs of sprouts peeking over the tops of the trays. Toward the far end – pots. Rows of new homes spreading out like a tiny leafy suburb.
Things at Cas' must've been pretty bad that evening because Cas didn't even raise an eyebrow, he simply pulled on his jacket and followed Dean, turning the light off as they left. He drank again, then handed the bottle back to Dean as they walked. He didn't ask where they were going.
Sam leans over and attracts the bartender's attention immediately. Dean has to admit that there are advantages to being a relative of Bigfoot. Sam leans in close to the bartender to holler their order over the music, and she nods, pulling out a bottle of Baileys and a bottle of Amaretto. And two shot glasses. Oh no. Dean is going to be hammered by the end of the night, even if it is just Sam's girly liqueur. He whaps Sam on the shoulder and mouths, 'Sammy, shots?!' Sam cracks a wicked grin and pushes the filled shot glass over to Dean, who gives up. They clink and down them. Chocolate and cream burn down to Dean's stomach and warm him up. 'Ack.' Sam coughs and Dean laughs. The bartender smiles at them and pours them two more, then heads off down the bar to where a big guy in a skintight muscle tee is yelling for her attention.
Dean turned and threw his arm around Castiel's shoulders. 'This is Cas! He's lived next door to us forever! We're in the same homeroom, too.'
Everything, that is, except for the grating voice drilling a hole through his early morning calm. Steam is rising from the kitchen, the freezer is being pillaged as people prepare their worktops for the day ahead, and Naomi is striding through the maze of steel, plastic, and wood with her clipboard, calling for Dean.
'Don't fall. You'll fall asleep.'
'The pontils? Or the blowpipes?'
Cas' eyebrows furrow, and Dean has to resist the urge to lean forward and smooth them. 'How can fruit be that bad?'
'I don't mind. Never liked the name anyway. Especially the nickname. Bart. Yech.'
.' He throws his duffel bag (which now contains a business plan – mostly written by a micro-managing Samsquatch) over his shoulder and walks out to the car.
Cas and Dean are quiet as they descend the overpass steps. When they get to the car, Cas puts on some music. Blue Oyster Cult. 'Nice,' Dean nods his approval. He and Cas grin at one another, then Cas grinds into gear and they head off back to the hotel parking lot, driving through the sparse dark. Cas pulls up next to Dean's Impala and gets out as Dean does.
'I don't.'
Sam wasn't unhappy, but he wasn't happy, either. He felt caught in between, as if he were trapped in a waiting room (albeit a really homey and familiar one). Uncle Bobby and Aunt Ellen were extra nice to him and asked him about Dean a lot. Some evenings his dad would call and Sam would tell him about teachers, schoolwork, the soccer team he had joined. John asked questions but rarely gave Sam any information except to say that Dean was fine and that he'd come and get Sam soon. Sam felt the hopeful optimistic part of himself shrink every time, as soon as he handed the phone over to Uncle Bobby.
Dean struck a ridiculous pose. 'Make me look beautiful, Francois.'
Dean does a double take. Usually new maids – sorry – room attendants – are chipper and bright-eyed. Dean's used to smiling women in their mid-twenties armed with confidence and a no-nonsense attitude, but this guy...he looks like he's afraid of his own shadow. Naomi keeps talking, but Dean isn't really listening, he's busy looking Castiel up and down curiously. He's not bad looking. In fact, if he wasn't shrinking in on himself, he'd be gorgeous, with that black bedhead hair. Castiel shoots Dean a nervous glance and Dean is momentarily incapacitated by a shock of bright blue. Why does it suddenly seem so quiet? And why is Naomi giving him such a weird look?
'Well, excuse me for listening to you! Stop playing the martyr, Dean, you're the one who started this stupid fight!'
'No, you didn't. Come in if you want, it's almost done cooling.' Cas walks in and sits down on a footstool. He watches Dean from the floor. Dean picks up the bowl, resisting the urge to wipe his face again.
'There you are. Castiel, this is Dean. Dean, meet one of our newest. Castiel is joining accommodation today.'
He ignored it.
'So not all good news and rainbows and unicorns, then.'
“It's not funny,” Castiel snapped.
Dean sighed. 'She only mentioned you, and didn't talk about your guys' dad at all. She wanted to know...well, I shouldn't say, it's her business.'
Dean woke up tangled in his sheets with a splitting headache. He grabbed his head and yelped when his hand met a tender spot on his face. What had happened? He searched his memory. Yesterday was Thanksgiving. He had stolen a bottle of whiskey, walked through the neighborhood.  He had ended up at Cas' house, hadn't he? No. Cas' shed. Train tracks. He and Cas had finished the whiskey down by the train tracks. Could Dean's life
Dean would never admit to liking the way Benny called him 'brother.' He shook his head. 'No. Of course not. You just said...something about a book report. Wait, a book report? Seriously? I thought we got over those in middle school.'
Cas tried to stop laughing. 'I - ' He clutched his ribs. 'Sorry - .'
Dean's voice rose. 'You're the one who disappeared and didn't call, Cas, so don't act all high and mighty!'
Dean looks into the room. Cas is standing with his head down in front of an exasperated Hester holding a rolled-up face cloth.
Dean chuckled. 'Just cuz
'Uh.' Sam checked the newspaper. 'This doesn't say. But we can hack into the police reports online.'
Well. Not ANYwhere else, he thought, an hour later, as he stumbled in through his front door. He almost laughed but didn't want to wake his dad or Sam. He knew he smelled like weed and beer on top of having a collage of massive hickeys on his neck. He silently cursed Bela. At the same time, he pressed his fingers into a bruise and it felt like touching a live wire. Something wickedly delightful flared in the pit of his stomach. He made his way to the stairs. He was almost there when the living room light flickered on and John loomed large in the doorway.
Cas nods, keeps his eyes down. 'He broke two of my ribs.' He says it with a blank face, in a tone that says I'm telling you so you know but please don't ask. Dean flinches and a deeply-buried part of him fractures. This is surreal. A few weeks ago, Dean didn't know this man, and here they are, sitting on top of an overpass late at night, telling each other about ambition and broken ribs. He doesn't know what to say. I'm sorry? My dad once hit me so hard he broke my nose? There's no combination of words that could change what happened, there's no way that anything Dean could say would be anything more than a tiny butterfly stitch on broken leg, so he very slowly wraps an arm around Cas' shoulders. Cas is tense at first, staring at his feet, but as the seconds tick by, Dean feels Cas' shoulders loosening. Dean sits perfectly still and lets the weight of his arm rest fully on Cas' shoulders until Cas is completely relaxed again. Then he gives Cas' shoulders a small squeeze and lets go. His arm tingles.
The three of them sat at the table and ate Cas' horrendous attempt at scrambled eggs with good grace. And if Dean hooked his leg around Cas' under the table, well, that was his own business.
“Okay!” Dean interrupts, staring at him pointedly. “Point is, how are you feeling now?”
'What time?'
'Any brother of Sam's is a brother of ours.' Dean struggles not to roll his eyes.
John waved a small-child wave.
'Cas,' Dean says seriously, turning to face him. 'Can I ask you something?'
Cas cocks his head to one side. 'I don't understand you.' Cas' voice is a little hoarse. Dean looks at him.
John smiled at the new boy and said, 'You make yourself at home, son. I'll go make you two some lunch. Maybe you can meet Sammy too, if he's up from his nap soon.' Dad left for the kitchen, and Castiel looked at Dean.
'Shh. Stop moving.'
Benny rapped the desk with his knuckles. 'Yeah, don't we all. It ain't that bad, just ramble on about personal development and how the arc of the character makes the difference between a tragedy or a comedy.'
'The magazine suggested that I get you a stuffed animal.'
Dean can already feel his head clearing, but there's a dull ache in his chest. Everything sort of fades as he splits the avocado with a knife, whacks his blade into the stone, and twists it out. He knocks the stone off on the edge of the sink and the impact reverberates up his arm and makes him feel sick. He cuts the avocado into quarters neatly, cleanly, thinking of surgery and scalpels. He digs his thumbs between the skin and the flesh and the avocado separates effortlessly. He feels brutal. He feels lost. He cleans it all, chops it all up into little pieces, pours it into the pan, and somehow, alchemically, violently, all of his horror becomes a meal that he will put on a plate and take in to his brother, who needs it. Who needs him.
book and she hasn't put it down since,” Amelia said over her shoulder as they joined everyone else in the living room. “She's been teaching us all about guineafowl.”
'Dig in.'
Cas burst out laughing. It was a rare event. Dean savored the sound and hoarded the vision of Cas' happiness. 'Francois?' Cas asked.
Sam narrowed his eyes. “Yeah, go ahead, laugh it up. It's not like that. I just feel like...we're supposed to be here.”
John thought for a moment. 'He's been good, Bobby, real good. Ever since he started talking again he won't stop. He's a regular chatty Kathy. It helps that he has friends his age in the neighborhood, I think.'
Dean crouched in the garden with the box and tried to plan a route through the flowering plants that would hide him most efficiently from the neighbours. He wasn't worried about being caught, not really. He knew that most of the neighbourhood was out celebrating. Leaves brushed his face and clothes until he reached the lawn. He stepped out into open space and a bright light from the kitchen washed over him. He froze, heart pounding in his chest. He ran over about a dozen excuses in his mind and waited for someone to call him out. No one did. Slowly, very slowly, he looked around. Shit. Someone was home. And they had been sitting in the dark this whole time? Dean raised an eyebrow and stepped backward behind a huge butterfly plant. He peered out between the flower spikes and long leaves and watched as Cas walked into the kitchen in his favourite comfy pjs and reached up to get a bowl from the shelf. Dean hated how his breath hitched when Cas' shirt pulled up and exposed a strip of pale skin.
Sam blushed. 'I'll go ask Dean.'
Bobby would leave the room and close the door, but sometimes Sam could still hear what he said. The volume of his voice dipped up and down like he was trying not to shout.
Cas gave Dean a look that was a cross between offended and stubborn. 'I
'I'm a glassblower.'
Dean leaves early the next morning. Sam gets up to drive him to the airport, yawning and, thankfully, not playing any music. When they get there, Dean pulls his bag out of the backseat and turns to give Sam a hug.
Castiel smiled back. “Morning, Jimmy.”
“Sorry, it's just...the GPS keeps glitching and saying we're still on the highway.” Sam returned to squinting in consternation at the location settings on his phone as Dean tried in vain to wipe the dog spit from his ear without gagging.
As he studied these pages, he flipped his athame over and over again in his hand, feeling the cool weight of the dagger in his palm. The small wrought iron blade with its smooth wooden handle brought him a measure of security that he desperately needed after the violation of his home - and his body. It had been a long time since he’d felt the urge to keep it close, but he felt it again now.
“He seemed to know a lot about demons,” Dean said. “And he said he had a crap load of books about them, too. He gave me his address, said we were welcome to stop by and take a look. We should probably find out all we can, don't you think?”
Missouri looked down at the dregs of her tea through the still steaming water. It was too soon to read them. They hadn’t settled yet. There was still tea left to drink, still time for things to become something other than what they were becoming. But she watched them swirl and felt something ominous in their movements, like the omen that came before the omen.
The book had said:
But Dean never did magic after that. He never broke his promise. Not on purpose, anyway. The cooking was another thing entirely, no matter what Sam or Missouri or anyone else tried to say about it.
“Sit down, Sam,” Missouri said sternly.
He flicks the lighter open again. Then he stops.
“And what is it you think your grandma does exactly?” James asked.
It threw Sam a nasty smirk.
They went straight to Missouri’s after that, but she couldn’t see anything more than she already had, and didn’t have any more advice to offer.
Sam Winchester is asking me if something is going to happen! Well, not in my house it’s not!”
“Well, look on the bright side,” Dean said. “At least now you know how to get rid of the evidence.”
He was, however, a little startled by the sheer quantity of food that Dean had made.
Sam kept crying.
“Look, we'll go up there and scope out the situation,” Dean said. “Get the lay of the land, figure out if he has anything useful to tell us. And if he makes a big deal about you being a witch -”
“When he was sixteen years old, flipping through a Ralph Lauren catalogue, ogling the model families in their matching polos,” Dean said. “You know, when
The pounding on the cell door ceases. He listens for a moment, just to be sure. A minute passes, then another. Not a sound can be heard out in the hall.
“There’s that African Dream Root stuff, too,” Dean said. “Cassandra was talking about it in Kansas City, remember? We could try that.”
But John was there. He had come back. And Sam was safe, unaware, wrapped up in some dream about cartoons or animals that could talk or trucks - always with the trucks. John had done his job, and Dean had done his.
“Hey, look,” Dean said, pointing. “Dog.”
“What kind of body?” Bobby asked in the same wary tone.
“Okay, let’s get you up,” Dean said, sticking his hands under Sam’s armpits and hoisting him upward.
“Something bad happened,” he said. “That’s all I know.”
When they break apart again, Dean feels breathless, like they’ve been kissing for eons instead of just a few tender seconds.
“So,” Castiel continues. He stops. Then he concludes: “So what’s one more?”
John had just looked at him. Then he closed his eyes like a man resigned.
He reached out and took his brother’s hand, wiping away some of the blood with his thumb.
“...You two are really John Winchester’s kids?”
Sam gathered all the saliva in his mouth and spit. The glob landed squarely on Marlene’s forehead. The demon flinched, then wrinkled Marlene’s nose in disgust, reaching up to wipe away the offending liquid.
“Let's get one of you with the family, Sam,” she'd said, shuffling the four of them closer together.
Going to elementary school, bastion of the normal, had been, for Dean, weirder than anything else he saw or heard growing up. The other kids all thought magic was made up, and you got in trouble for fighting them for saying so. It was like being told up was down, right was left, and don’t you dare argue back about it, even if you know they’re wrong. Sam's early memories must have been similar. But Sam's memories lacked something that Dean's didn't - their mom, their dad, and the strange, hazy days before any of them had known the truth.
Except, sometimes, he does remember.
“Then it was right,” Castiel says at once, with conviction.
Dean thought about that for a minute.
“Way to stick your foot in it,” Sam muttered.
He didn’t sound like he really believed it, though, which was fine by Dean, because he didn’t really believe it, either.
” he said, flabbergasted.
For how many nights, though? Until John was swallowed up in some rabbit hole, tumbling down into a place that couldn’t be reached? Until the days slipped together into one long, sleepless marathon, each hour indistinguishable from the last? Sure, he would call. When he remembered that time had passed.
“Ladyheart was pretty bad,” he allowed.
Missouri sighed and set her cup back down on the tray. She reached up to rub at the pain in her temple, tried to ease it, but her head was filled with aches - those of the past, those of the present, and those of the future. They were all tangled up in one another, dense, and all of it painful.
John stood and went to the kitchen, leaving his tea sitting on the table, still mostly untouched. He’d hardly had more than a sip. Missouri resisted the urge to lean over and see what his tea leaves were doing. Her curiosity wasn’t great enough to overcome her trepidation.
