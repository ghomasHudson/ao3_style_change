A big shout out to MissDavis for a great set of prompts, I'm off to do my Christmas shopping, cooking , housework and all the things I haven't got done while this fic has taken over my life.
“Thank you Ruth.” Sherlock acknowledged her intervention, “I see your careers in nursing, and subsequently in ordained ministry have given you a high level of people skills, and your success in what is still ostensibly a man’s world has enhanced your natural authority… damn!”
Mary smiled at that thought but only briefly, things had been going fine, despite the upheaval to their relationship caused by the return of Sherlock Holmes from the dead. But just recently John had been acting strangely, she was aware of it even though she had hardly seen him. John had started staying up later and later, until after even she was asleep; apart from last night when she had got in from the gym and found him already in bed, dead to the world. Could it be that John was getting cold feet?
“Certainly not, in addition to the surfing business, Eddie runs a café I have discovered serves the finest cup of coffee in Wilvercombe. He is also the purveyor of all manner of comestibles essential to the surfing community, his hash brownies are superb…”
Mrs Hudson seemed as delighted to see them as she had been on Friday, fussing over Rosie who was equally delighted with the attention. They went first into 221a where Mrs Hudson had the kettle boiled and scones fresh out of the oven.
John surveyed the wall, somehow having neither seen nor heard a sign of Sherlock for over three weeks, he had arrived at Baker Street after work to find that Mary was already there and that the sitting room of 221b had been turned into Wedding HQ. Sherlock had, it appeared stepped up to the plate regarding his best man brief and applied his creative but highly effective organisational skills to the subject of John and Mary’s wedding; every detail, from the canapés to the confetti was now under Sherlock’s meticulous management.
In a last act of mercy, to spare his cherished brother pain, Mycroft’s final words are carefully designed to goad Sherlock into killing him. In detail and at length he dismisses as worthless the complex, courageous, noble man that is, John Watson
This seemed to do the trick as the door opened a crack, and then wider when Aziraphale recognised his caller, “Oh it’s you!” he said, before he turned back to the darken interior of the shop. Crowley stepped in, closed and locked the door behind him, and followed Aziraphale to the small back room of the shop. He had never quite understood the meaning of the word ‘crestfallen’ until now.
Sherlock was startled, from the moment he had met the Duke and his assistant the day before he had ceased to worry about Arthur Saltire, to the extent that he had almost forgotten that the boy was missing presumed kidnapped. He tried to school his face, but his bewilderment must have shown as John turned his head in disgust.
“Well it is thanks to you that we have a true picture of what happened here tonight, in all its tragic detail. Will you be going back to London right away? Only there will be a matter of statements.”
“No more lies,” John ranted and raved, shouted at Mycroft and made as if to strike the man, but he never flinched. It is this that finally convinced John that the British Government had known the true identity of his former fiancée for less that forty-eight hours.
Lestrade sighed and signalled to the undertaker and the forensics assistants who were ready to collect the body.
John took a moment to compose himself, running his hands across the fresh paintwork and the cotton mattress. It was lovely, so much nicer than Rosie’s bedroom at home which he had started before Sherlock was shot and never finished.
He opened his newspaper at the crossword and peeled the wrapper from a Fry’s Chocolate Cream that he had purloined from Sherlock’s secret stash.
Despite the fact the whole business was needling him; Sherlock found he was reluctant to raise the subject of the mawkish verse with John. He sincerely hoped that it was merely a temporary mental aberration on the part of his friend, something that would fade away as long as it remained unacknowledged.
When the tears had finally abated, John said in what Sherlock was beginning to recognise as his ‘doctoring’ voice. “Miss Sutherland, I am staying for a couple of nights with a friend and his mother and I have arranged to meet them for something to eat at a pub around the corner, perhaps you would like to join us?”
Sherlock put down his phone. John was coming back to Baker Street, with Rosie, his final wish come true. It was indeed a miracle.
Sherlock heated up one of the tins of soup from John’s store cupboard and made tea for them both. Sherlock found these small domestic activities, which he had so studiously avoided during his tenure as John’s flatmate, remarkably therapeutic. It was something practical he could do for John, and kept his hands occupied, without which he might have been tempted to continually touch John to reassure himself that his friend was truly there with him. It was only now John was found that Sherlock was able to admit to himself just how afraid he had been.
He had hoped for a quiet retirement and a chance to finish his definitive history of the British Isles, (and possibly his memoirs) before expiring in a touching deathbed scene.
The first time John’s phone rang he ignored it, that is, he pretended to sleep through it. He had a sneaky feeling it might be work saying one of the other partners had called in sick. The next time he glanced at the number, didn’t recognise it and decided against answering, he hadn’t been in an accident in the last three years unless you counted kidnapping. The third time it rang, John thought perhaps the number was vaguely familiar and did answer. It was Greg.
“Have you seen him?” Sherlock was in no mood for games, which was unfortunate as Mycroft was determined to play.
The Boscombe Valley Hotel hardly merited the name; it was a perfectly serviceable village pub whose previous owners had at some point in the 1970s, built an ugly single storey extension containing six additional bedrooms in the hopeful anticipation of attracting tourists. This optimism had been misplaced, the village had no features of interest and was too far off the beaten track for the hotel to attract anything but limited passing trade. In addition, the extension had been built cheaply, and on land that was prone to flooding in the event of a wet winter, which the area experienced nearly every year, including this one.
The car delivered him to Mycroft’s office, where his brother was sat behind his desk in the usual manner, face a little rounder, hair slightly thinner but otherwise unchanged. If it hadn’t been for the encounter in Serbia, Sherlock might have supposed that the man had not moved a muscle in two years.
“Well Irene Adler offered it to you on a plate, I expect there have been plenty of women… and men who have done the same. But you’ve never…”
“No, I suppose not…” Steve answered slowly, unsure what Sherlock was getting at, but Danny cottoned on immediately.
Mycroft Holmes is a busy man, with little respite between being the British government, the secret service and moonlighting as the CIA, yet he always has time for his brother.
How did she do it? One day she’s dead, the back of her head blown away yet the next, she’s taken a cab to Chinatown, murdered her husband and hey-presto she's back in the morgue. Sherlock knows it's all done with smoke and mirrors solve it and the mystery of Moriarty’s return's solved with it.
John decided he really couldn’t put off doing Christmas shopping any longer. He had managed to get presents for Rosie and Mrs Hudson online, but he was still stuck for an idea for Sherlock and now he supposed he needed to get a present for Greg and Dinah. He wondered if they had a list anywhere and quickly dialled Greg’s mobile to ask, but again it went straight to voicemail.
The villain springs from nowhere leaving John unconscious and bleeding. The rest of the yarders give chase while traumatised Sherlock cradles John and Lestrade secures an ambulance.
I haven't watched much of the Granada Sherlock so when I did watch this the other day I was a bit miffed with some of the similarities with the form this fic was taking.
In fact they would all have lost their money as when Greg arrived a few minutes later he was trailing a sheepish looking Mycroft.
“Not exclusively. In addition to the surfing supplies and the food, Eddie’s also operates as an internet café which is unlikely to be busy this time of the afternoon. Although you may not think it, it will take more than a few drops of rain to keep the surfer boys out of the water. The tea and cake are a bonus. This way,” he added veering off down a side street before stopping so abruptly John nearly ran into him. “Oh your friends”
“Paul told me that his father greeted him warmly but then told him to be on his way as he was due to meet someone. Paul thought it odd and said so. At that point, his father started to argue with him, and as a final blow suggested that instead of hanging round the farm, he should make the most of his unexpected visit home to settle things with Alice. Paul took objection to this and stormed off, intending to head home as he had lost his appetite for the walk, and for taking shots at the bunnies in the woods.
There must have been something, a subconscious deduction that had prompted the thought of Afghanistan, but what it had been still eluded him.
Greg looked round too, and in doing so, missed both Amy’s conspiratorial wink at Sally, and seeing Sally’s smile in return, eyes mischievously twinkling.
In the time it took for Sherlock to dress and collect the overnight bag which he kept for such occasions, and for Mrs Hudson to make them both sandwiches, they were ready to depart. However, there was little point in hurrying, the first train with a connection to Mackleton was not until Midday.
John taps softly on the door of the last cubicle. The gents, like the rest of the club, is busy though no one is paying attention to him. The door opens just enough to let John in.
“The possibility occurred to me; I knew that Sutherland & Co on the Tottenham Court Road was a literary landmark. What I deduced about Chris was that he is quite a simple old-fashioned boy, mad about books, who, as he grew up around London, would be bound to know the establishment. Whereas Mary is an old-fashioned girl who just wants to settle down with a nice boy she can relate to. They’ll write to each other while he’s way and if anything comes of it, then all well and good, and if the Windibanks try to interfere, then Ruth Taylor will be more than a match for them.”
“You know full well. Everyone at the Yard is intrigued by your indefatigable good mood, plus they all claim to have put on five pounds through the cakes you keep buying them. Sherlock reports that his brother is insufferable as ever, but even I have seen Mycroft crack a smile twice, and not his scary one either.
“Ridiculous, I told you often enough,” Piecroft, despite his natural aversion to legwork has followed Sherlock down, “Caring is not an advantage.”
Harry tries again “I need you, moral support, keep me on the wagon. And who knows when you’ll get another chance to hook up with some cute guy, you’re in the army now.”
John fetches the baby monitor, Rosie tends to sleep through the night but it wouldn’t do not to hear her wake.
“I’m sorry,” the woman said in a voice that clearly indicated she was nothing of the sort, “but you shouldn’t be in here.”
“How much did it cost, that jaunt to Scotland, the bones, the local force, the hotel? Which department’s budget did you blow on that?”
Sherlock slowly gathered his wits, locked the door and turned the sign to closed. He went through to the back, shed the cloak he wore as The Great Nostradamo, peeled off the wig and the goatee beard and lay down on the bunk, taking up his preferred thinking position.
Crowley tried to persuade him otherwise but Aziraphale was adamant, in the end it was Crowley that caved.
“We had an almighty row, he said he was sick of living a lie, and he went straight up and came right out to his folks.
Sherlock was at home, dressed in soft pyjamas, and his second-best dressing gown, he was toying with his violin, working on the outline of a waltz for John and Mary’s first dance. Assuming he was still invited after what Sherlock had stored in his mind palace as ‘the incident’ that had occurred the previous Saturday.
“Mrs Flugrath’s solicitor who had been responsible for the will and for the schoolboy error redeemed himself admirably by producing copies of all Mrs Flugrath’s previous wills at the hearing. According to this report Mrs Flugrath made a will in 1985, shortly after the death of her husband which left the bulk of her estate to her cousin Thomas Sutherland. This will was revised in October 2001, one would assume just after Thomas died as it left everything jointly to her cousin’s widow Mrs Thomas Sutherland, which is an old fashioned way of writing her name but helpful in this case, and to her niece, there’s that word again, Mary Sutherland.”
There was no grand return, no reception committee. Just one of the British Government’s ubiquitous black Jaguars waiting on the tarmac at Brize Norton, complete with its anonymous driver, his courtesy transport to London. For two bits Sherlock would have stuck a finger up at the nearest surveillance camera and made his own way home. But he had no money, no phone and anyway he ached all over; the thought of hitching or being jostled on the train was untenable.
“I can’t comprehends why that would be a source of mirth; it is after all the fifteenth most commonly spoken language in the world.”
There was no point trying to get out of it, the car would sit there idling and blocking up the traffic for as long as it took him to concede defeat. Sherlock reluctantly put his socks and shoes, slipped out of his dressing gown and into his jacket, coat and scarf, pausing only to retrieve his phone before going downstairs.
Lestrade seemed to take John’s comments at face value and broke into proud smile, agreeing with John that he was indeed a lucky dog. The convivial atmosphere was ruined by Sherlock asking.
Through understanding there’s forgiveness, in forgiveness there’s healing, and, as no confession is complete without it, in penance there is cake.
“I did so love to dance,” Aziraphale sounded wistful “I used to go to a lovely little club just for the gavotte, such a shame when it closed.”
John kept his gun trained on Dinah as they sat and waited for the police, and Sherlock filled him in on what had happened while he was supposedly outside for a cigarette.
Sherlock, Steve and Danny made their way up a gentle slope to the tall thin entrance of the cave. As they walked, Sherlock asked Steve about the people he had named as other drivers of the pickup.
“Two years, Mycroft. Two years of surviving on the crumbs of affection you could spare me from your work and your country. You’re the one who dictated the terms of our relationship, kept me in my place. I know why my security service code name is Justin, Anthea let it slip… it stands for ‘Mr Just in for the weekend’. That’s why we split Mycroft, I never expected to be your top priority, but I had hoped to make it into the top ten.”
“What do you want Sherlock, for me to list all the rotten choices I have made since I met you? We all make choices, every day; shall I get up now? Shall I have toast for breakfast? Most are so mundane we don’t even notice we are making them. Some are significant and life changing and we don’t even notice making them either. Some bad choices turn out for the best, some good choices end in misery, like I said to you before… It is what it is…”
Sherlock cradled his violin carefully as the helicopter came into land. After working his way through his solo repertoire, he had decided to try a duet and had been assiduously practicing Shostakovich’s five pieces. He had no idea if this would provoke a response from Eurus, nothing had so far, but she was more than capable of taking the lead, should she rise to the challenge.
There was no road to speak of, not even bare patches of earth or ruts to indicate where vehicles might have traversed the moors before. Steve explained again, “the Duke doesn’t permit green lane driving.”
John caught Sherlock by the arm, he winced. “It appears I must intrude on the school’s hospitality for another night, Dr Huxtable, if you are willing to contact the police please advise them that we will be available tomorrow morning. Dr Watson needs to rest and recuperate.”
Back in his bedsit in Bloomsbury Sherlock enjoys a hot shower and shaves. He tames his birds nest hair and dresses in his sharpest suit. Today he thinks, today anything is possible.
He knocked on the door of 221A and called out to Mrs Hudson. “I’m expecting a parcel; if the person who delivers it won’t take it upstairs leave it in the hallway. Don’t try to lift it yourself.”
John smiles and licks his lips a little in the old, heart-breaking style and finally calls Sherlock his ‘best friend’ and Sherlock’s resolve collapses like an overcooked soufflé.
“Weird. He told me if I was serious about being Head Receptionist I needed to finish my NVQ in business administration and to stop wearing Santa earrings in September, if that’s what you mean?”
“Ah, I was not convinced of her murderous proclivities at the time of your engagement. Sherlock only discovered the irrefutable evidence during his courtship.”
“It won’t settle.” John said optimistically, watching the flakes dissolve as they landed on the wet road.
“If you say so dear” She turned back to her mixing bowl and sighed “If I get everything I need to do today done, it will be a miracle”
Then there were the local bobbies, who seemed to manage to combine the burning resentment that another force had been brought in with a deep and abiding hatred of the English to make a particularly toxic mix. He didn’t understand what they were saying half the time and he was sure that was deliberate, he’d worked alongside plenty of jocks in London and he’d never had a problem before.
Left to their own devises they wandered out into the majestic hallway to wait for their lift. They had expected to find it empty instead they found the Duchess, striding up and down the length of it, her stiletto heels beating a tattoo on the ancient flagstones as she unleashing a torrent of angry Russian to whoever was on the other end of her mobile phone.
“According to both the solicitor and her GP she was as bright as a button right up to the day she died, of a massive stoke, at the age of 94.”
Once home they went their separate ways, John to finish his usual Friday chores, while Sherlock disappeared out into their small backyard to check on his current experiment. John changed his and Rosie’s beds, unloaded and loaded the washing machine (yet again) and did their Tesco order, he supposed he had better buy some ‘drinks and nibbles’ then. The whole idea of Sherlock planning a social event disturbed John more than he cared to admit, but that wasn’t the only thing.
There, under the infra-red lamp, he was able to decipher the remaining few words on the charred remnant.
John was worried. He had so much to worry about he didn’t know what to worry about first. He needed to index his worries so that he could produce a list in degrees of urgency and importance, which would enable him to prioritise worrying over certain issues ahead of others. This kind of categorisation was not John’s strong point despite being a man of science himself. Sherlock would have been of great assistance with this task. Unfortunately, Sherlock was one of the main sources of worry.
“Alex got involved with a girl from the village, one of the Wilder girls, Joanna. She was as crazy as he was, nothing she wasn’t up for. Any road, she ended up in the family way, and James was the result. Alex was no more than about twenty-two then, I guess he didn’t want to be tied down, but neither did she. They left the baby with Jo’s older sister Julie and off they went. Julie had married the landlord of the Fighting Cock, that’s the pub just on the left as you go into the village, they didn’t have any children of their own.”
“After we all moved to Lyon Place, I began to feel down. I had always thought it my own special place but as soon as he moved in Mr Windibank began to lay down the law.  Like I said to you yesterday I was not best pleased when Mother remarried eight months after Daddy died, it all seemed rather soon. I had no wish to stand in the way of her happiness but now it seemed she and Mr Windibank were determined to prevent mine. He never wanted me to go out, not even to see our old neighbours in the Tottenham Court Road, and he never wanted us to have visitors if he could help it. He would say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to Mrs Etherege, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.
“You seem very trusting of a man you have not known long. What makes you so certain he has not simply,” Sherlock thought for a moment, “chickened out?”
By ten o’clock, when Sherlock appeared in the kitchen, John was making great strides with his list, as demonstrated by the number of items that were crossed through. Rosie was supervising John’s activity from a seat at the kitchen table where she was busy with her stickers making a card for Uncle Geg and Aunty Dinna.
Between them the wrestled the bike from its resting place in the hedge. Sherlock quickly compared it to the description Aveling had given him. It was a high-end mountain bike, less than six months old – almost certainly John’s. Despite being thrown over a hedge it seemed to have come to no harm and had certainly not been in an accident.
Sherlock quickly found a hoodie for Rosie to wear on the way home and was just leaving the room when he noticed a scrunched up piece of paper on the floor, just beyond the waste bin, as if it had been thrown but missed the target. It was the same notepaper as the night before and Sherlock found it impossible to resist investigating further.
Greg seethed, he had more than a fair idea of who was behind ‘organising’ his trip to Scotland but instead he said, “I’m holding you at your word, Sir. If I don’t get back in time, it won’t be me you have to deal with.”
She’d bang their heads together if she thought it would do any good; that went for the Watsons too, did they not realise how precious family is? Mrs Holmes turns her mind to deal with her ever squabbling brood. She could wring their necks, the authors of those parenting books that had told her the best way to prevent sibling rivalry was to encourage her seven year old to help her look after the baby. The problem was he had taken her far too seriously and for far too long.
Lestrade was tempted to prevaricate but what the hell, here was the one person he could be honest with. “Blooming marvellous.” He announced with a great deal of satisfaction.
Sherlock pondered the words on the notepaper a little longer while absentmindedly flicking through the old newspaper until his attention was gripped by the report of an unexplained death in a house in Camberwell that sounded suspiciously like another death he’d investigate three months earlier. Sherlock reached for his phone and started firing off texts to Lestrade, the words on the paper forgotten until sometime later he heard the door downstairs open and the exciting babbling of a two and a half year old as John and Rosie greeted Mrs H. Sherlock hurriedly stuffed the piece of paper back where he had taken it from and went down to meet them.
There’s something about the resurrection of James Moriarty that resonates with the detective. An investigation from a previous life or parallel universe. He recalls Watson had been spellbound, a case filled with ghosts and apparitions, messages from beyond the grave, eerie melodies, secret societies and tales from the crypt that had caused a veritable hurricane of hyperbole in the journals of his Boswell. At the centre the most magnificent maleficence, the murder of a man by a wife already dead.
Greg’s plane touched down at Heathrow Airport just before one o’clock on Saturday lunchtime, he looked out onto the grey, wet tarmac and thought that he had never been so glad to see anywhere as London, for all her dismal winter plumage.
Sherlock had lit a fire which was burning brightly behind the new fire guard. John cooked the ‘thing with peas’ for supper and Mrs Hudson joined them, after all she was on duty for the Christmas dinner.
“I think, my friends,” Sherlock whispered, “that we had better take up our position behind the door. He isn’t expecting us, but he was armed before and every precaution is necessary. Be ready with your handcuffs, inspector. You can leave the talking to me.”
Sherlock appeared fifteen minutes later, washed and shaved and his hair tamed, the vulnerability John had seen while he was sleeping completely vanished. Sherlock shrugged his coat on and wrapped his scarf around his neck. John bit his tongue not to ask where he was going, if Sherlock wanted to be all mysterious with his coat and his cheekbones again then he could be. But John felt something akin to a blow to the gut when Sherlock stopped at the top of the stairs and said.
“Mr King” Sherlock questioned the agent “You handle guns in your line of business. Do you think that it might have been two shots ﬁred almost at the same instant?”
The room was almost but not quite restored to the way it had been before the incident with the motion-triggered grenade. It had caught the brunt of the explosion and most of the interior had been destroyed either by fire or water. His chair had been salvageable as had been, somewhat randomly, the bison’s head. But the tables, soft furnishings, the couch and what he still liked to think of as ‘John’s Chair’ had all needed to be replaced.
John had a feeling that he probably didn’t want to hear what Sherlock had to say but there was no point in delaying the inevitable.
John chalked the wall inched forward a few paces before dropping to his hands and knees again. It occurred to him that it was getting lighter, but he had been fooled more than once before by the faintest shafts of light that briefly appeared through crevasses in the cave roof. He cupped his hands and drank as much water as he could manage.
Sherlock has but doesn’t say so “Make yourself at home, stay the night if you like. There’s food and a bottle of white in the fridge, take what you need and I’ll be there as soon as possible. Miss you”.
The club, when they finally reached it, was in John’s opinion, a right dump. The entrance tucked away underneath the railway arches in an alley that ran alongside the canal (not exactly Canal Street). The scrawny ginger haired bouncer didn’t look as if he would offer much resistance should John decide he was getting in without paying, or much use if there was any ‘trouble’.
On the last night, after a few too many tequila sunrises, she kindly lets him down and says as much.
Crowley thought that being the only two full time supernatural beings on the planet for the past six millennia was plenty to be going on with, but he kept that to himself.
“No, the warehouse was a blind, a waste of valuable time; they have another headquarters closer to the wharf. I need to concentrate. Silence everyone!”
“Oh I reported it until I was blue in the face but nothing was done about it, and eventually I just got used to keeping everything in the cupboard in the basement, this isn’t a large hotel. I load up my trolley and bring everything up in the lift.”
John pairs off with Ceri, a petite and curvy blonde with an infectious laugh and an accent you could cut with a knife; for the rest of the week they are inseparable.
Not the hollow silence that had followed Sherlock’s return from exile, nor the lonely silence while John was living across town with his wife, and certainly not the agonising silence following Mary’s death, when John had cut Sherlock out of his life. Rather it was the relieved silence that can only come after a spirited toddler has been bundled into her coat and out to the park with daddy ready to burn off some energy before bath time.
It was no surprise, Sherlock supposed, that John would choose not to spend time under the same roof as the man who murdered his wife, and whose escapades had once again nearly got him killed. The flat may be habitable once more, but that didn’t mean he had his old life back. That was all so much soot and ashes, ashes and soot.
Lestrade drained the rest of his coffee, and wrapped his scarf tighter round his neck; he pulled on his gloves, still unpleasantly damp from his earlier trip to the crime scene and made his way outside. It was still sleeting, although the flakes seemed to be getting whiter and more substantial, the sky looked worryingly full of it.
“Except his parents kicked up a fuss, said that their son was a deeply religious man, would never have committed suicide. That’s when the Guv got involved, especially when the rags took up the story and speculated he was guilty after all… oh hello John.”
“It strikes me that we went about that the wrong way.” Crowley waited for the rebuttal, it never came so he ploughed on, letting the car keep an eye on the road for a while. “Perhaps we should have prepared the ground a bit more, you know, they have been apart for a long time. It might have been a bit much to just present them a double bed and expect them to get on with… er… it.”
Sherlock lets George rant on; although he would never admit it, he is distracted. His mind has been on other things all day, no wonder he’s lost his edge.
And so it went on, for hours and hours, round and round in Sherlock’s head, every syllable, every nuance, every tone, every expression, examined and catalogued until all other possibilities were exhausted.
“I see you have uncovered the skeleton in the family cupboard. Well, it has not been much of a secret for many years, anyone who lived or worked on the estate or in the local area will know that James Wilder is my late brother’s son by Joanna Wilder. There is no scandal or mystery about it, although my mother and father never knew the truth.
Mary let him guide her over to a far wall where there was a full-length standing mirror. Mary was stood in front of it, admiring the flowers when a man came into view behind her and a voice said.
“Because they could” Sherlock replied simply “Because they get their kicks out of exercising power over unsuspecting victims.”
Once in the kitchen, John got busy putting away the shopping and preparing lunch for Rosie “She needs a nap” he explained “Once she’s gone down, then we’ll talk. Make yourself useful and put the kettle on”
Alas hope dies before it gains expression; the calculating look the man is giving John contains no hint of recognition.
“Then, you’re going to get changed into something much more suitable, and we are going to see the ponies, followed by a trip to the Shetland Distillery Experience, then back here for dinner and the hot tub. What do you think?”
“An interesting study,” the geography teacher said, “in nature versus nurture, one cannot help wondering if James Wilder had been brought up by one uncle rather than the other, if his life would have turned out differently.”
“That’s where our criminal made their first mistake. This lock is high quality brass, which while it will corrode if exposed over time to water or some other corrosive substance… won’t rust.”
Mr and Mrs Holmes kindly suggested Martha and Rosie might like to go home with them after the wedding and Mrs Hudson agreed thinking it would be nice for her ‘married ones’ to have Baker Street to themselves for a few days.
If she were being romantic, she would have said her life had changed when she met John Watson, if she were being honest, she would have said it all changed when Jim Moriarty died.
“My father never got over Alex’s death and within six months he had the stroke that killed him. I have always regretted not telling him about Alex’s son. Once I was living on the estate I decided to do what I could for the boy, Hayes had made a poor show of running the Fighting Cock, and couldn’t make it pay, so I let them move into the Lodge, that was when the rumours concerning James were confirmed.
After they had finished and Lestrade had his paperwork signed he came back to where Sherlock was still crouching by the door. “Got anything for me?”
“Did you follow us last night, is that how you operate? Spying on visitors to get the gen on them in case they come to see you.”
“Shut up. What if she hadn’t tried to be smart? What if she’d gone for a bullet instead of poison? I couldn’t have saved you then.”
DI Martin agreed to John’s suggestion, wished them well then went back to his regular job of policing, securing the scene and arranging for the removal of Richard’s body.
Time went on, she had begun to hear rumours, that Moriarty was dead, that Sherlock had killed him before he killed himself; that Mycroft Holmes had had him killed in revenge for his brother’s death; that he had killed himself in a fit of pique once his greatest adversary was no more. Mary was sceptical, she was working at the surgery by this time, her nursing qualifications were genuine, even if her certificates were forged; it put her in the perfect place to keep an eye on John Watson.
“The Windibanks and Mrs Etherege live and work closely to Mary Sutherland and know her intimately. They know her likes and dislikes and are supremely placed to create her ideal suitor. Mrs Etherege encourages Mary to advertise in the lonely hearts, they produce a reply that is so exactly her perfect man that even if she receives genuine replies, she will not consider them. She becomes so enamoured of this man that she willingly becomes engaged to him without ever meeting him, to the point that they are due to be married. Then fate intervenes, he does not show up, but he has not jilted her, instead he writes to her with the story of some unavoidable incident that has prevented their marriage at this time and making her swear to wait for him for eternity. Heartbroken she agrees, she will remain true, and single, working for Mrs Etheredge and with the Windibanks living off her the rest of their natural lives.”
Deciding he would never cope with everything on the tube, he ordered a taxi and text Mrs Hudson to say they were on their way.
, making careful notes of what Miss Sutherland had said. The notes weren’t at all necessary, but it gave Sherlock a reason to keep him from leaving.
John decided at that moment, that alongside being a soldier (retired) and a doctor (part time) he would be a blogger and write up the tales of his beloved’s amazing powers of deduction, of the crimes he had solved and the villains he had brought to justice, so that everyone knew the name of Sherlock Holmes and it was remembered for all time.
After another hour, the newspaper abandoned, John stood and stretched a little. “Right, I think I’ll turn in, don’t forget to go to bed at some point”
It turned out it was his luck that ran out. After several miles but before they reached Mackleton, the pickup made a sharp left turn, suddenly and without warning causing the front of John’s bicycle to clip the side of the truck, and for John to let go, needing both hands to steady himself, the wheel completely buckled. Ahead of him the vehicle stopped abruptly, and the young man John had seen earlier jumped down and walked towards him.
“We’ve had a discussion,” Sally announced, “and we have decided that as officially we are off the clock at ten, and as you missed out on a stag do being sent on this wild goose chase and as we are stuck here for at least a couple more days and there is nothing anyone can do about that, we thought you could have your stag do here, complete with stags” She waved her hand in the general direction of the mounted heads on the wall. “so, this is what we are going to do, you are going to get yourself on the outside of the full Scottish, complete with Lorne sausage and haggis, plus a nip of whiskey on your porridge.
The thought wouldn’t go away. He had to do something, make a change, break the mould before he went stark staring mad. Then an idea came to him, tomorrow, he would pack a bag for Rosie, enough to keep her clean and fed and occupied and they would spend the day at Baker Street. Mrs Hudson had said he was always welcome, he would take her up on that and if Sherlock was there that would be a bonus. Mrs Hudson had said he had a case on, perhaps he could help.
Mr Chatterjee, once more in favour, appeared with platefuls of sandwiches and savouries, and said he would see them later. John cautioned Sherlock to behave “He’s a widower and his family come from Dhaka, stop winding the poor woman up”.
Sherlock spent another unprofitable hour or two working on various permutations of the letters and was pretty certain that the second most frequent figure was an A, or possibly a T. He gave up and lay down on the couch. The couch was new, long and wide and ideal for thinking and occasionally sleeping, so Sherlock did both.
The superstore was another Christmas nightmare, with every piece of seasonal tat that you could imagine. The store’s address system announced that Santa and his reindeer were in the store today and John thought Rosie might enjoy a look.
It was a rum way to earn a living, but it suited him better than he might have expected. True the punters were the worst kind of morons with their banal enquiries, the tedious triumvirate of love, money and death.
“I was pushed for time, and anyway what is wrong with it? And what is wrong with being a florist? You like plants.”
What was wrong with a good old fashioned English name like Ralph? Then there was the case, that was the sort of trivial problem that Sherlock wouldn’t sully his mind palace with, even in acute boredom. Missing jewels indeed? Next people would be expecting the detective to look for lost cats. John had fully expected Sherlock to send Mr Fell away with a couple of scathing deductions and a flea in his ear.
The summer term was a short one and John had the long vacation to explore his surroundings. While the other teachers took holidays abroad and visited family, John was quite content to stay in his rooms at the school and spend his days exploring the surrounding countryside. Walking was an ordeal as his limp persisted, so he bought a bicycle and took himself off every day, up hill and down dale, along the country lanes to market towns and villages around Mackleton, stopping to discover ancient churches, quaint tea rooms and peculiarly dressed wells. The exercise did John good, it restored his soul and made him feel at peace in a way he hadn’t for over two years.  He little knew that his world was about to be turned on its head again.
Crowley sneezed again. Aziraphale produced a perfectly laundered cotton lawn handkerchief and handed it to the demon. Crowley murmured his thanks and removed his glasses to dry his eyes. For some reason both they and his nose were streaming.
He was gratified to see that at some point his coat had been rescued from captivity, possibly by the same officers who arrested Harry Harkins, and was now hanging on a hook by his hospital bed.
“You can next time.” Mary replied, as she brushed passed him to pin another post-it to the wall. John gave her a squinty look; he was never entirely sure when she was joking.
“False teeth… pleurisy… only child… banker… votes conservative,” the isolated words forming pieces of a puzzle falling seamlessly into place, “Lived in Stirling… Episcopalian”
Now there was a daybed in this room and the stranger, instead of replying, lay down on it, closed his eyes and placed his hands together as if in prayer.
Sherlock went to fetch the magnifier and couldn’t help noticing that a wad of soggy lined paper had appeared in the bin by the basin. He was certain it hadn’t been there last night.
Big thanks to ADC for housing his heroes at 221B and not 221X or Z or something equally impossible to end a sentence on.
The soldier listened to this sorry story very carefully and when the stranger had finished, he stood up, put his shoulders back and looked squarely at the man and said.
Sherlock had spent the day oscillating between the two most recent crime scenes in Battersea and Camberwell until suddenly, at four o’clock he had sent two texts to an anonymous number and received a hand delivered note via one of his homeless network before haring off to a show down with a serial killer on Clapham Common.
The line is dreadful, in these days of modern technology, John thinks, they could do something about the static.
Reluctantly John went up the seventeen stairs to the first floor; he paused momentarily outside the closed door to flat B before taking the next flight to the landing where his old room was situated.
A couple of minutes later Sherlock was back on the phone to Hilton-Cubitt, the photograph open on his laptop in front of him.
“Well, look on the bright side, they’re not likely to be heading back to town in this weather, and if he solves the case before nightfall…”
John Watson, at home in his chair, restored to its rightful place by the fireside. His anger is ice in his veins and fire in his belly and the steam inside him may explode at any moment.
“I suspect that is highly unlikely seeing that he’s been dealing with hotel customers for the past five years. Get him processed and I’ll be with you in an hour. Black, two sugars.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure. He liked the sound of the word ‘stay’, but not so closely associated with ‘a few days’ so he said nothing.
John looked up confused. “It looks as if this letter from Ian Moody aka Mr Nobody was written on Mary’s own typewriter.”
Sherlock did as he was told, and Steve put the truck into gear and set off back the way he had come. In the mirror Sherlock watched as Danny pushed the bike through the gap in the hedge and clambered over the stile, climbed on and started peddling furiously down the bridlepath. He was soon out of sight.
“Possibly, but that still doesn’t explain how she got there, nothing on the CCTV and the lock was completely rusted up, the hotel maintenance had to force the door with a jemmy.”
“Only there is a children’s craft day down at the church hall, making decorations, all ages and then we’re going to decorated the big room ready for the Christmas Bazaar tomorrow, I thought Rosie might enjoy it.”
But there was something about his air of self-satisfaction as Mycroft reviewed Sherlock’s files that made him want to wipe the smug expression off his brother’s face.
“Well, there’s always next year…” Mrs Hudson pulled herself together and placed the wooden spoon into Sherlock’s hand, “So, in the absence of any real children you’ll have to do. Stir the pudding.”
“Now they 'download' their holiday reading onto something called a Kind-ley or they listen to a Jane Austen that some movie star has recorded onto a cassette, and it has become harder and harder to fob them off with a PD James. It all became so dispiriting, I decided to surround myself with beautiful flowers instead.  Hence the change to the sign on the premises.”
John did as he was told, but the truth was that he neither felt nor looked at ease. How much of this was simply because he and Sherlock were not a well-matched pair and how much due to the range of complex emotions caused by the proximity to his friend (which was both too close for comfort and not close enough for waltzing), was hard to tell. But it was made significantly worse by the fact that John, the shorter of the two and the beginner, was leading while Sherlock, who was much more experienced, was totally unused to being led.
“So, did I!” Aziraphale exclaimed, “So did I. We were having a marvellous time, going about here and there, enjoying ourselves, and it was doing the boy the world of good and Dr Watson did not know what to make of it. I had even managed to wangle an invitation to the wedding as Sherlock’s ‘other half’. My dear, he was fit to be tied, he was so put out. He interrupted us dancing on Saturday morning and his face! It was a picture of jealousy.
Garvey raised his face once more, stumbling as best he could to his feet, then spoke with the cold composure of despair. “I have nothing to hide from you, officers,” he said. “If I shot the man then it was in self-defence and you won’t pin a first degree charge on me for that. But if you think I could have hurt Eddie then you don’t know either me or him. I tell you there was never a man in this world loved another more than I loved him. We were as David and Jonathan.”
“Sherlock asked, I could hardly refuse the best man, could I? After all, Mrs Hudson is bringing Mr Chatterjee, and Molly, her chap. He’s Sherlock’s plus one.”
John watched as Sherlock tried to assimilate all that was meant in their short conversation. He decided it might be better to show him. He stood up, took Sherlock by the hand so that he stood up too and there in the sitting room, before the fire on a winter’s night, and under the mistletoe that was still attached to the light, they shared their first kiss
Sherlock wondered if there was some sense in what Mycroft was saying but was not about to concede any points to his brother.
“Why would I be anything else… despite our differences I considered your life was still too precious to be forfeited if I had the power to prevent it. Sherlock was far better equipped to deal with the likes of Dinah Shepherd.
“No can do, the CCTV’s a nonstarter, too dark to make anything out. The nerds are working on it now but they’re not optimistic. There was activity in this corridor two days ago but they’ve only shadows to go on.”
Steve and Sherlock descended from the truck and walked back to join Danny at the spot. Steve made to fetch the bike, but Sherlock held him back as he quickly examined the scene, the flattened grass,  the mishmash of footprints, something that might be blood, all the signs of a scuffle.
Sherlock agreed. Aveling turned into the corridor at the top of the stairs and stopped at the first door, producing another set of keys.
John answered him, “If I fill this room with gold then the Queen will make me her husband which frankly, I would rather not be. But if I leave the room full of straw, then she will have me killed. So, you see, I am damned if I do and I am damned if I don’t!”
So, Sherlock straightened John’s tie and wished him luck as he went off to catch his train, and then took Rosie to ‘stay and play’ in the local church hall. This was not Sherlock’s natural milieu, but he had managed his occasional visits so far without incident. John had at some point told the other parents, predominantly mums, that Rosie’s godfather was very shy, and he wasn’t being rude if he didn’t talk much and this had eased Sherlock’s venture into the world of toddler groups
Crowley sprung to the defence of his angel. “It’s essential. Mary Morstan is not who she claims to be.”
Sherlock didn’t need asking twice. “I’ve spent a lot of time in London, Sutherland & Co. on the Tottenham Court Road is something of an institution, it has been there since the 1900s. I hadn’t realised that it had changed hands. Looking at the records from Companies House, Sutherland & Co. seemed to have been in decline even before Thomas died but this escalated after his death. He left the business to his wife, but it seems her heart wasn’t in it and although she married James Windibank who was a buyer for the firm, he also lacked the business acumen to make a go of the place. Added to that, they did not own the property only the lease, which was due for renewal in 2004 and the Windibanks did not have the wherewithal to cover it. It was most fortuitous that Old Aunt Edna died and they came into the house in Lyon Place. Mrs Windibank sold up, below the asking price for a quick sale and they all moved into Lyon Place where we can assume they live quite comfortably on Miss Sutherland’s money. She certainly seems to be the only one with any form of income.
“If I may furnish you with a little background to this desperate situation. My name is Dr Thorneycroft Huxtable and I am the headmaster of a boys’ preparatory school in Derbyshire.  I am the fourth generation of my family to head the school which was founded over a hundred years ago by my great-grandfather.
Sherlock had always been slender but now he was positively gaunt, his cheekbones that had been the source of much envy were far too prominent and his eyes sunk into his face with the grey shadows beneath them. He was holding himself stiffly, but John wondered if there was a more sinister reason than just his displeasure at being beholden to his brother. For the first time since Sherlock’s return, John began to wonder just what had happened during that Boy’s Own Adventure Sherlock had been on.
Hoping that the silence meant that he was alone rather than the fact that Arthur was nearby but unconscious, John applied himself to his predicament. He was a doctor and a soldier and was trained in survival techniques but nothing in the Afghan desert really compare to this. But he had also studied under the master of deduction, as he relished the comforting flavour of the mint, he let his mind wander. What would Sherlock do?
Lestrade who had come to the conclusion this was burglary gone wrong is sceptical. “You mean this was a hit.”
Aziraphale clocked that John was watching them intently and was tempted to kiss Sherlock goodbye but instead he turned to the doctor and said, “Do enjoy your dancing lesson, Dr Watson, I hope I haven’t worn him out for you.”
John’s heart lifted and sank at the same time, he momentarily wondered if there was a medical term for that.
Though it was when Sherlock returned and Mrs Hudson, who had already had her herbal soother for the night, got on to the subject of her and the late Frank Hudson’s compatibility in the bedroom that John drew a halt to the proceedings. It might be the eve of Sherlock’s wedding but there was no need for that kind of talk.
“Good!” Crowley replied, changing into his snake form, and slithering through the bars of the nearest cell.
Sherlock walked through the dip with John a couple of times and then announced they would do the whole routine from the top, he restarted the track, and they took their positions. John thought he was beginning to get the hang of it, he was no longer consciously counting in his head which allowed him to listen to the music and the words of the song. They seemed kind of melancholy he thought as he listened more carefully.
The celebrant, a tall, heavy set man in his sixties, with iron grey hair, thick horn rimmed glasses and a distinct stoop addressed the couple on the seriousness of the step they were about to take then gave them the opportunity to exchange vows, which as John expected were brief and to the point.
Sherlock awkwardly opened his arms, John walked into them and Sherlock closed them again as they rocked very slightly together. John breathed in the essence of him, shampoo, tobacco, formaldehyde, and something else that was quintessentially Sherlock and very male.
Except it wasn’t Sherlock. True, he was dressed in a bespoke suit and along black coat that covered his tall, sparce frame and what John could see of his face revealed its fine bone structure, but while the hands holding the newspaper were blessed with long, elegant fingers they weren’t quite Sherlock’s. Initially the man’s hair appeared as dark as Sherlock’s although longer and straighter, John could see the way the fluorescent light in the carriage brought out the red in it. He held himself all wrong too, while Sherlock had an animal grace, this man was more sinuous than feline.
Mary interpreted this as relating to the invitation, “perhaps it’s a bit soon, but I thought it would be nice for Sherlock to have a friend of his own at the reception, especially as Mike’s working abroad.”
“Only that there would be a need for more grouse shooting in future.” Sherlock replied smugly, before going on. “The Duchess invested heavily in the Holderness estate and now it is in a much better place financially than when he inherited but that doesn’t mean that the Duke’s money worries are over. He has another issue, and I use that word deliberately, that needs to be provided for.
Sherlock shook is head annoyed with himself, when he looked up he caught Molly staring at him intently.
“Mr Holmes, you don’t know how relieved I am to hear you say that. You’re an angel, that’s what you are, an angel in disguise.”
It would help if he knew the number of letters, or could fill in some of the blanks from other clues. Mildly annoyed with himself for getting sucked in by such a banal conundrum, Sherlock started to look for yesterday’s newspaper where he assumed he would find the crossword the clue belonged to. He located the paper in the recycling bin but the crossword was untouched. Curious, he ferreted through the papers from the previous week but the crosswords were all the same unattempted state. Not from the Evening Standard then or at least not a recent one but nevertheless nothing to do with John’s distracted state after all.
So, you wear the stupid hat, you flip your collar, and you pose on the steps of Baker Street and smile for the cameras, and all the while your heart (which you never knew you had until you met him) quietly breaks.
“That you never run away from danger you always run towards it… You didn’t hesitate for one second to put your own life on the line to ensure the safety of Arthur.”
Rosie, significantly happier now she was the proud owner of a new tooth, babbled enthusiastically, “bubububub!”
John hadn’t thought much about the implications, he’d gathered he would be expected to do his share of night feeds and dirty nappies, but he also knew he was never going to be the primary care giver; they would never be able to afford the mortgage on Mary’s salary. Or perhaps they might have, who knew what she had squirrelled away from her previous occupation?
He never set foot again in Baker Street after Sherlock’s death. He dossed at his sister’s, Mike’s, Sarah’s and even for two (possibly three – his memory of the time was at best vague) drunken nights at Lestrade’s, before he secured a bedsit in same hostel where the whole sorry saga had begun. John’s sole conversation with Mycroft Holmes in twelve months that could pass as civil, had consisted of a barked instruction to have the contents of the small bedroom at the top of the stairs at 221b packed up and delivered to his new address. He regretted losing touch with Mrs Hudson but was too immersed in his own grief to cope with hers as well.
Garvey went on, “Who was this Englishman that he should come between us? He led poor Eddie astray, making this mockery of a marriage. He should never have entered into such an ungodly union.”
On the plus side there were six of one kind which by rights should represent E, and four of another which should in theory be T, or possibly A, but the frequency of letters could be thrown out by irregularities such as proper nouns; and what were those little boxes about? Sherlock scowled at the print outs of the two photographs, despite the second message, he still didn’t have enough data.
Thus, it was a still mildly hungover, sleep deprived and not exactly fragrant Inspector Lestrade who collected his bag from the overhead locker and left the plane. Marcus lived in Hounslow so could practically walk home from the airport, but Amy and Sally both joined Greg on the Heathrow Express back to Paddington.
Food would be an issue and he didn’t fancy running around on Christmas Day trying to find a takeaway that was open, and he certainly wasn’t going to a pub on his own. The idea of a turkey or even a chicken was absurd but he stopped by the local butchers and bought a rather expensive steak which was more of a treat anyway. He passed the off licence and thought about getting a nice single malt, but settled instead for a packet of Assam and another of orange pekoe from the artisan tea shop next door.
He wants to know why he’s standing in a redundant Victorian graveyard when a man more recently deceased is speaking from every billboard, TV screen and mobile in the country.
“Well, Greg, you dark horse, you’ve kept this under your hat, you lucky dog,” John said as cliché followed cliché; he could tell without looking at him that Sherlock was rolling his eyes.
Although these days John rarely struggles for survival in the sands of Afghanistan, his sub-conscious often takes him back to Bart’s, or Sherrinford, as he is forced to watch, without reprieve, his friend sacrifice his life for others.
“That is where you are wrong,” Sherlock stood up and addressed the Duke, “Alexander and Joanna were married at the time of James’s birth, I have had this information from a most reliable source, and what is more I believe that James is aware of the marriage too. He may not have known it for long, but I am certain he knows it now and because of this he is a very real danger to your son Arthur.”
Either way, John thinks, the detective has made a mistake that will cost him, cost them all, dearly.
Mrs Hudson stopped in her tracks and stared at her tenant in amazement “Sherlock you made a Christmas joke, what on earth has got into you?”
John turned his head away and said in the most matter of fact way, “I don’t come back from Afghanistan, do I?”
Certainly, Mycroft thinks, his brother’s intimate companion is a fortunate man to possess such an excellent moustache…and reliable beard.
Harry is delighted to hear from him. “Johnny!” she exclaims before launching into an excited prattle about how amazing it is that he should call at this precise moment in her life.
Four o’clock on Sunday afternoon saw a small party gather at Euston station to see John, Chris and Bill off to join their regiment. Sherlock who hated crowds, farewells and any kind of sentiment (although he now supposed he must make an exception in John’s case) longed for the whole performance to be over. The delight of seeing John in his uniform, neat as a new pin was already fading. He was beginning to experience the first pangs of missing John and if he was going to have to learn how to live with someone’s absence, he was impatient for the lesson to start.
