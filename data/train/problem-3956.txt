“It’s fine, Dean,” Cas said. “I’ll get dressed.” He got out of bed, tangled himself in bedclothes and fell hard, catching himself on the stuffed chair.
“Well, shit, Jimmy, one time he shoved a bigass chunk of grace into my mouth and fucking near scared me to death, and the other time, well, that one I really enjoyed.”
“He’s eager to make her acquaintance,” Dean said agreeably. Dean thought to himself that his heart would likely explode if he saw Castiel holding Mary, but that was not a smart thing to say either, so he said, “He helped teach the kids at Haven,” Dean said. “I think he really enjoys them, including babies.” Castiel had mentioned it over breakfast, looking at Dean even more intently than normal, which was saying something.
Garth made a weird squealing noise under his breath. Benny shot him a look, and continued to grill Dean.
“I just didn’t think it would all happen so quick,” Dean said. There was a hint of a laugh in there, he hoped. “You were the one who was worried. Do you have any fucking clue how hot you are?” Dean asked. It was a rhetorical question, but Castiel’s answer amazed him.
Castiel shook his head and got that bossy tone that always made Dean feel very compliant. “Who knows what lies he’s telling Sam? He may be my relative but he won’t have a problem trying to cheat Sam in some way.”
“Please don’t talk like this,” Castiel begged. “Stop being childish and for my sake attempt to be civil.”
Dean gaped, and then controlled himself. “I know it’s all part of your process or whatever,” Dean said, putting his hand against the wall, “but seriously, you need to stop with the religious talk, or I’m going to think you’re critiquing my housekeeping.” As he leaned up against the wall to fight with one boot, Castiel rushed up to help him and knelt to pull it off.
Gabe, of course, did not give him the desired reaction. “As a test of his devotion to you that would be quite something. So, not interested yourself?” He sounded entertained.
“I’m not leaving town,” Dean said confidently. “God picked you out for me, why would I argue with that?”
Dr. Castiel Novak could not get the conversation he’d had with Dean Winchester out of his thoughts. To take on rescuing so many chickens struck him as being absolutely ludicrous, and yet he was also impressed by the gallant resolve he’d heard in the other man’s voice, as if he knew and was facing how hard it was going to be with a realistic frame of mind.
“No, I don’t mean to do that,” Castiel said carefully. “I’m going to show you what I’ve been thrown out of,” and for the next ten minutes, thanks to between four and six ounces of Crown Royal, and because Dean encouraged him, Castiel wandered up and down the living room, pretending to give a sermon like he got every Sunday from the “Servant”, ‘either live or on tape’.
“No, just the three of us. Eileen is with us in the bunker but she’s not – she’s not participating.”
Cas closed the door behind him and eyed Dean. “You look unhappy to leave me with Gabe. I’m not going anywhere with him. Also,” and abruptly he was holding Dean, “With Gabe around,” he whispered in Dean’s ear, “I can’t give you a kiss goodbye before work.”
“What about him? Tell him no funny business while we’re asleep and I’ll pretend I’m not pissed off that I’ve actually been sleeping with two different dudes for the last year.”
Dean felt acutely embarrassed. He’d just opened up on this guy and dumped on him without the courtesy of introducing himself. He could feel his father’s ghostly slaps against the back of his head. “Dean Winchester,” Dean said.
“The only thing I know for certain,” Cas said, once again looking off to the horizon, “Is that you are seriously confused about how invested I am; whether or not you’re a hypocrite is a side issue right now.”
“To losing your whiskey virginity!” Dean toasted, and downed his with aplomb. Castiel scowled at Dean, and still scowling, upended the shot glass and started wheezing, and after Dean clapped him on the back said, in a choked voice, “Will anyone care if I have two?”
Gabe didn’t leave for two months. He stuck to the program and found a job and moved out. Gabe testified against the loan sharks, even after death threats. He quit gambling, and opened a candy store with two sets of counters, one for kids and one for adults, and the store won design awards, and he paid back all his loans within five years. Franchisees lined up to get a piece of the “
In two minutes they were in Dean’s room. Dean, ignoring the tension, said, “I want you to drink two eight-ounce glasses of water.”
“You don’t have any ID or money,” Dean said, which didn’t really answer the question, but let him know that Dean knew he was in dire need. He elaborated. “Something happened to you and you need food and shelter, same’s everyone else.”
“It’s sickening,” Eileen said. Two months into dating (really living with, but that was not being publicly announced) Dean, Castiel had acquired something he had not expected, in-laws, of sorts, and nephews. The boys (John, known as Jack) and Adam, known as ‘Adam, no!’,  were so adorable, observant and loving and funny, that he felt honored to be brought into their lives as a guest, who was growing into being a relative. It felt weird, and then it felt right.
“Jesus fucking Christ in tit clamps,” Dean said, too horrified by this not to exclaim in the vernacular.
“Rocky’s? I know it,” Castiel said with a smile in his voice. “I’ll see you shortly.” Castiel promptly did something foolish; he looked up Dean Winchester on social media. The Facebook account was locked but Instagram was loaded with dimple-cheeked nephews; a chicken coop; a brother and sister-in-law who were gorgeous and oh so in love, and Dean himself, who was, in the telling slang expression, ‘a snack’, whether he was showing off his car or pointing to the garage he’d just cleaned out. Castiel scrolled back. There were no pictures of a significant other more recent than two years ago, a woman with pointy cheeks and red hair.
There was no response for quite a while. The tension stretched until Castiel went to make himself tea and they sat at the kitchen table staring at each other with shared anxiety.
“If there’s one thing that being a lawyer has taught me,” Sam said, “It’s that there’s no end to how outright manipulative, childish and, and
The quip, whatever it was going to be, never made it out of his mouth, and his smile vanished into his curiosity and alarm. This was not a face he felt like lying to. Dean said, “I was hoping for a quiet place to pray.”
When Dean came in the following Wednesday, he was only ordering for himself, and he made very little small talk. Cas hoped he’d hang around for a chat, but he left.
“Kinda intensely so,” Dean said with a lopsided grin. “But if I promise not to critique you, you wanna take charge?” and got the shock of his life when Castiel took him at his word. He reached under Dean’s left arm and over his right shoulder and pulled him in, kissing him softly at first and then with more and more intensity.
Dean heard himself sigh and his eyes closed. He made a little sound in his throat. Castiel hummed into his mouth. Time stopped and restarted with a few long, slow strokes of Castiel’s tongue.
Dean thought about it. “I don’t think I’m ready for a fearless moral inventory,” he said. “Or any other part of the twelve steps. Thank you for checking in on me. I - I’d better get back to it, I’ve got quite a list.”
“I stopped remembering you were rich while you were pounding me in the ass,” Dean said apologetically.
,” I said. I was stupefied. I loved Dean, but there was no way I’d ever tell him. I also knew that Dean wouldn’t lie about it, he’d have no reason to. I could feel my heart pounding so hard, I had to strain to hear him.
Gabe’s mischievous face grew even more sly. “More respect than you showed me, slobbering all over my cousin this morning. ‘Traumatized’ is pretty much the only possible way to characterize how I –“
“Don’t date anybody more than a couple of years older than you. You’re more likely to get manipulated by an older partner. Don’t go anywhere with anyone alone in a car. If some guy shows you that he’s mean and hurtful, believe him. Walk away, no matter how much fun his dick is to ride. Educate yourself about gay culture, but don’t watch porn all day, real life’s not much like that. Always use a condom, don’t skimp on the lube…. I dunno what else to say.”
When he told Cas, his discomfort was quite obvious. “Can you, er, make a copy and then scrub the system?”
The kissing went on for quite a while. Cas said, after he got enough air in himself to speak without panting, “This conversation has been sort of all over the place.”
“I would like to apologize without reservation for anything I said to cause offense,” Jimmy said. “I was forward and invasive to your privacy and I gave Castiel terrible advice.”
“It’s a memory foam mattress with six hundred thread count sheets and extra firm pillows,” Dean said. The implication that it would soon be thoroughly ravaged made itself clear to everyone else in the room.
“Well, sit next to me and learn from a master at working the phones,” Dean said. He brought another chair over to the desk.
“You’ve been not very subliminally begging me to fuck you for the last two hours, and then you say things like
“I hope so.” Cas returned to licking Dean’s asshole. He paused. “For the next little while, I’d like to make a new rule. You can move as much as you want, but only speak when you want me to change what I’m doing. You can either tell me what to do or let me switch it up.”
“I’m a brown belt in Tae Kwon-Do,” Gabe said, one puckish eyebrow raised. “Unless you know how to fight once you’re on the ground, you won’t last long.”
“Are you yanking my chain?” Dean asked. “I should go,” he said, making for the door handle. Cas fended him off easily. “Youngest black belt in goju-ryu karate in Washington State history,” Cas said. “I could go all day, and you’d be a whimpering mass of bruises at the end of it.”
They watched TV. Trying to get Castiel caught up with current trends in TV shows gave Dean a headache, until he figured out that the Great British Baking Show was probably exactly the right speed.
“I can be quiet if you can,” Dean said, and Castiel stifled a laugh when he felt around under the bed and pulled out knee pads. Hoarsely he replied, “What? I use ‘em when I’m scrubbing floors!”
“I wouldn’t,” Cas said. “But you’re either the world’s best liar or you genuinely care about the outcome.”
“The human vagina is a marvel of engineering,” Castiel said, and then, face reproachful, “Dean, it was not meant to amuse.”
They were on the bed, half naked, trying to show off their kissing skills. Nothing on earth had ever felt like this to Dean. He was always the boss of a sexual encounter, in total control. Cas palmed his dick through his pants with one hand and caressed his scalp with the other and Dean exclaimed and grabbed onto him harder.
“No,” Cas said. His posture shifted and he sat up straighter. “It was a dream to warn me to stop lying; that lying is a worse sin than being gay. That I would feel closer to God if I stopped lying, and became….”
“Minimal devotion to the details of the rites was paid,” Castiel said, returning to his normally bland style.
Dean figured, so maybe he had found sex with Lisa not exactly super-exciting or challenging, but what was wrong with that? Everybody was having orgasms, what was the big deal?
“All the shit we’ve been through and you think that’s the weird part?” Dean remembered bitching at her. “We’re not each other’s original, this is just how things turned out, I sleep better, and fuck you.”
“You need to get the word out as to how many and what breed and what condition they’re in as fast as you can. Did you want me to come along with you?”
He and Castiel texted each other all day. Despite everything, he smiled each time he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He didn’t know Castiel was smiling too, but he could feel it, in the warm encouragement of his messages.
“Find their old church, message the pastor. Find one person in the phone book from the old stomping grounds whose name you recognize and start making phone calls.”
“I’m so sorry you had to listen to all that,” Cas said. He closed the door of the study. It was a beautiful, well-lit room, not large, but cosy and homey.
“You have no idea how much I want to make you feel good,” Castiel said gravely. “You redeemed my life. I know that my redeemer liveth, and you are him.”
sales job by calling me the nickname that made me pray to God for your quick death when I was twelve. I’m not pleased to see you. I was having a private breakfast - ”
“It’s safe to look at him,” Castiel said. People teased them because they were jealous. Something was going on under the surface with them, something between them that wasn’t ordinary or even necessarily good, or calm.
“Trouble is,” Dean said with a rueful chuckle, and as if he hadn’t heard Cas, “It’s something I’ve stopped looking forward to.”
Perhaps he was trying to avoid Cas for being too fucking cute and not currently dateable, or maybe he was pruning his task list –– or maybe he was questioning how his entire existence was now in a tipsy orbit around his weekly trip to the weed store. The upshot of it was that Cas had more customers in raw numbers, but Wednesday Dean was no more.
“Well, don’t pass out in the shower. I should probably feed you first but dude, you smell like you’ve been living rough for a minute. As for the food, it won’t be anything fancy.”
Dean said the first thing that came into his mind. “That’s rough.” He reached for the dish of peas as Castiel put down pot holders for the meatloaf and potatoes. The smell was so appetizing, Dean felt like he might drool.
Cas: A lot, actually. I thought being with him made me a better person, but now I think him being with me made him a worse one.
There was an obviously unhappy pause. Castiel exhaled through his nostrils and shifted against the upholstery. Finally he said, “If I was worthy I would have been upheld by angels,” Castiel said.
“I think I have enough money for my own hotel room,” Dean said stiffly, “If you’d prefer me elsewhere.”
Dean looked at Cas with disappointment. Cas sighed. “Yes, I told him. This is my brother, Gabriel. Gabe, Dean, Dean, Gabe.”
For maybe twenty seconds, Cas watched with hidden fear and open amusement as Dean considered his options. His expression fixed on mulish, and he said, “Yes,” and then to prove he wasn’t going to drive off, he didn’t get into his car. Trust Dean to get him good and mad and then calm him right down again by signalling his good intentions.
“Dean never did the right thing from instinct,” Castiel said. He was so matter-of-fact that for a second Dean didn’t really understand the words. “I thought it was enough to be partners. Don’t you think of us as more? More than partners?”
The little cry, more tentative than angry or scared, was still in Dean’s ears. Sam had called him and despite the hour, Dean was welcome to join him and Eileen as she gave birth, “As long as you stay on the cheerleading side, not the business end,” Eileen signed, before she groaned again.
With the last of my strength, I brushed his lips with mine and said, “That’s how, assbutt. Now, I need to go back to the bunker and lie down, this instant, I’m about to fall down.” It wasn’t a long walk, and I leaned on him hard, because I had to.
Dean shrugged again. Bobby hadn’t gone to the wedding; he and Sam had fallen out a couple of years back and he hadn’t been invited. It was a slap in the face to the man who had practically raised him, but what could you do? Sam had fallen in love with a rich girl and his life had changed, and Bobby’s most emphatically had not.
“We’re not a very judgey family,” Dean said. “I mean, Sam’s come back from giving blow jobs in cars to raise cash for his next score and he’s in grad school now. A-a-a-nd I should probably have let him talk to you about that since that’s all really personal and it was a total betrayal of trust…”
“I don’t even want to do that, and I have to get ready for to work,” Dean said. He left them at the table, against his better judgement, to shower. The feeling that Gabe would either kidnap Castiel, or convince him to leave voluntarily, settled over him like a cold fog that his hot shower did nothing to melt off.
They talked for hours; Dean fell asleep on the sofa like he belonged there. Castiel watched him do it. He got a pillow under his head and threw a sheet over him – it was too hot for anything else – and went to bed, his mind just whirling.
“I feel seen,” Dean said with terrible sarcasm. In a rather different voice, he said, “I went for this deal because I wanted you to stay. You are good for my mental and physical health. I would die for you, cheerfully. You are the best friend I ever had. I did this so you wouldn’t leave. Asking me if I want you to leave is just killing me, man, don’t do it. I know Jimmy’s in there, but I don’t want to interact with him until I’ve had a chance to talk to Sam.”
Dean knew that every word of this was as true as the intention behind it, however exaggerated in form. “So, no marrying in secret.”
Despairing of sounding casual, as he saw Novak Clinic come up on his phone, Dean opted for being brief. “‘Lo,” he said.
After a minute or so, Dean realized that Castiel was mocking the Servant and he started to laugh. This wound Castiel up, and he started flinging his arms around and exaggeratedly pulling out the final syllables of words, and finally, after a truly terrible and mostly incomprehensible impromptu sermon about the evils of modernism and the perils of socialism, they were both on the floor, laughing their asses off. Cas had this high, breathy chuckle that made Dean never want to stop laughing.
He took me to my room. With his help, I was just barely able to get into my pyjamas before I passed out, and I woke up fourteen hours later, with him fully dressed, boots kicked off, pressed against my back with an arm thrown over me. Apparently Sam came in during the night and backed out again, but Dean and I both slept through that.
He could hear his own voice, yelling, and woke up completely to hear Castiel’s calm voice in the darkness. “You’re all right. It was just a bad dream.”
Dean’s mouth firmed up, and then he said, unemotionally, “I’m a cam worker. I have different channels I make content for, and I also do livestreams and then package them. I have very high tech video feeds and I also am doing VR of various sexual acts with toys, since I’m a solo act.”
“More like yourself,” Dean supplied. He leaned forward and kissed Cas. After about two minutes they pulled themselves apart. Cas looked awestruck. It was very cute.
“I could bread and bake them. Normally I’d make salad to go with it but I didn’t see any ingredients.”
There was plenty of weed at home. He had no reason to go back immediately. Bobby was stocked up for now and everyone else was on their own. Dean got out of the ‘picking up other people’s weed like a courier’ non-business, advising his network that if they were
“I know how wonderful you are, from how terrible life is when you’re gone,” Dean said. He was prevaricating, and that felt wrong to me; I wanted him to stop dodging the truth of what we are.
Dean’s voice cracked as he turned his bedside lamp on. “I’m Winchester, remember? Not the original?” He never stopped moving the wing oil around, though.
“Is that Sam?” I asked. I didn’t know where the name came from, but it was suddenly there in my mind.
“About half of them came from my mom, she gave me all her Stephen King as she read them and then bought them all again, can you believe it? No wonder that guy is fucking loaded, I tell ya. The rest is from school and random purchases, and people know I read, so I get stuff when they move.”
“So, do you own this joint,” Dean said, asking a question without ever making a sound of enquiry. He got out of bed, stark naked, and approached Michael, who showed immediate and quite justified alarm. It was all Cas could do not to laugh.
Michael frowned. He knew it was a trick question, somehow, but Cas would call him on a lie, he knew that without asking, so he said, “I have a key.”
Dean was relieved Cas hadn’t said anything flirtier, because that would have been damned embarrassing. He allowed himself to agree.
Castiel’s nose wrinkled. “Perhaps you should wash your face first?” At Dean’s snort, he said, “Dean, you’re a barbarian.”
Dean was very annoyed that, having super-secretly decided that Castiel with his so-blue eyes was the one, the One of song and fable, he instantly had to deal with one of his in-laws. It was outrageous, it was too fucking much, it was a manifestation of demonic evil.
“Because I’m his family and I didn’t think of it.” After a second, “Sweetheart?” Castiel said faintly.
Dean barked a laugh. “Not yet,” he said, looking around appreciatively. The store was immaculate, although the pungent smell of weed was impossible to ignore. “What would be the perfect variety for ’just got home from work and don’t want to lose my motivation for cooking and dishes and laundry before I collapse in front of the TV?”
“For Pete’s sake, Dean, come into the store, I’ll give you a hug and you can decide if I smell nice. No cologne though, that’s just for special occasions.”
“That is how families are supposed to be,” Castiel said. “I thought that’s how the people of Haven and I were, but it turns out we’re not really family at all.”
Dean came up behind him and embraced him, putting his chin on his shoulder. “Think I’m too dumb to help you with your business?” Which was not subtle, but Cas now knew he’d overheard at least part of that.
“I had nothing to do with that, Eileen did everything including the graphic design and I don’t want anyone to forget that,” Dean said furiously, and Castiel outraged him by another soft laugh. It was very gentle, not a mean laugh at all, more like an ‘aren’t you wonderful’ laugh. Castiel continued, “Anybody as kind-hearted as you needs a total bastard like me in his life.”
Cas made a little noise which might have meant anything. Dean hurried on, “Also, and this is full disclosure, her professional association has investigated her twice because she’s taken juvenile clients on in the teeth of their parents’ objections, but the outcome of one investigation was the arrest of the stepfather and the outcome of the other investigation was the emancipation of the minor, so —“ Dean spread his hands. “Also very LGBTQI and Ace friendly, okay with neurodiverse people, and her office has an ensuite accessible washroom, which also has amazing acoustics for recording and
“I was choking. Dean got me breathing again,” Cas confirmed. He was smiling at Dean again. “I’m really sorry I puked in the vase but I just grabbed the first thing I thought would hold it.”
-prone wealthy people can be. I know this guy has a public reputation of being a complete sweetheart but those are the fuckers you have to look out for. Stay sharp.” Sam left.
“Castiel,” Gabe said, his entire manner changing. “I’m in big trouble, I owe some bad people a lot of money.”
“He went into law because he’s damned good at putting an argument together. Or maybe he put the eight inches in height and the yard in reach he’s got on that pipsqueak mofo to good use, and just hauled him to the meeting against his will.”
Dean felt unease as he walked in under a small, tinkling bell; he’d expected other people in the store, people he could hide behind as he oriented himself.
“Well,” Castiel said primly, “That’s good to know, although I don’t like you saying bad things about Gabe’s mom. Is it okay if Gabe stays overnight and leaves in the morning?”
“Five months ago,” Cas said. “Some kids threw a bowling ball from an overpass and a truck driver swerved into his lane. He lost control of his car.”
Alastair had a heart attack after he was transferred to jail on various charges, including fraud and kidnapping, and died without a will, so the lawyers had a field day and the feds had to put together a task force to deal with the tangle of land and buildings he’d owned so as to disburse funds to his victims.
“Oh yeah,” Dean said. “Let’s get an eighth of that Trainwreck stuff, I think I read something about that.”
Dean: That’s on him. Partners stay partners when they can grow without hurting each other. I never figured that out until after Lisa and I broke up.
“Um,” Dean’s voice said. “No drugs. Some major spell-work and one fuck of a team effort, but you, uh, you don’t actually have a physical body at the moment. You’re sort of a … you’re an AI, until we reunite you with your body, which is, uh, sleeping right now.”
“I’ve killed various gods and a fuckton o’ monsters and seen a lot of weird shit in between. I am kinda hard to impress. Anyway I could totally tell it was his shindig, so I let him have it.” Dean seemed to think he was the easiest-going groom ever, and Castiel had pulled some bridezilla shit on him. It was horrible, normal and excruciatingly Dean, but Sam was spared the effort of a civil response when Castiel spoke.
“I’m going to resht now. I’ve had a ferry tiring day.” And with that he fell asleep. Passed out, really.
“You mean my awesome memory foam bed. And excuse me, but you said you’d leave if I wanted you to. You didn’t tell me you’d die if you left, just that you’d get sick.”
“So after that you had to rescue them. He pushed your hero button and now you are going to throw yourself into the impossible task of rescuing a thousand chickens. Tell me you at least have feed.”
For a moment Gabe looked blank. He shot a look at Castiel and said to Dean, “I said it looked like you two were ‘involved’ and I’d punch your lights out if you hurt my cousin.”
Castiel: You have an amazing circle of friends and family. They are all people who love you. You should see their faces when they talk about you.
“Wumf,” Cas said. His voice in his ear while he was coming was still echoing in his body. Then he makes soft silly noises like that and Dean wants to grab him and rut up against him again or maybe just grab him.
“Because for about an hour I intend to treat you like the softest, tightest, most eager-to-please power bottom who ever jizzed his brains out for me.”
To leave his possibly-dying best friend to do research back in the bunker seemed like a fucking terrible decision, even if it was a fine afternoon stretching into the evening, and a comfortable temperature to be outdoors. Dean lay down next to Castiel and put his hand between his shoulder blades. Castiel didn’t waken, but he whimpered, and not really understanding what he was doing, Dean started kneading Castiel’s wings, sliding his fingers from next to his back up to the weird finger-type bones he had at the top of his wings, smoothing and pressing and massaging. Once in a while Castiel sighed, but not in a pained way, so Dean kept working.
night, you fucking jackass! — and now you’ve picked up some — guy — and you’re going to take him upstairs and bang him?”
“I am unclear as to whether that statement could be supported by the Bible,” Castiel said, narrowing his eyes.
Dean braced himself but all Castiel said, when he understood what Gabe was telling him, was, “Oh. So I’ll have to find another way to get money to go to college.”
Castiel said nothing, but his eyes got cartoonishly big and he walked around the table to kiss Dean.
There was something about Dean, an imperviousness, that was a clue to a hypersensitivity to criticism. He’d sense that a comment was coming and leave, or change the subject, or get frisky, or take a shower, or run the water in the sink. If Castiel was even thinking about talking about something emotional Dean would sense it and find some way to stand the moment on its head. He was so adept at it that if he had not known how sweet Dean was already, he’d have thought he was the biggest asshole who ever sucked in a breath to derail what you were about to say by talking about interspecies sex between Chewbacca and Han, at which point Castiel would be grimacing and trying not to laugh. Dean was very good at it. It was the kind of good that spoke of long practice and being shit-scared of criticism.
Dean shrugged. “Sure, but if she says a fucking thing about me and Cas here, she may not like my reaction, capisce?” Dean got a mean smile on his face as Sam reacted to the ‘Cas’ which Dean had dropped so casually.
The Feminine Side - skin care, makeup, clothes, food and everything glamor, aimed at male-identified people wanting to explore smashing the gender binary in private and in public
A few minutes later, Dean’s kitchen tornado act came to an end, and there was egg salad on wheat toast with a side of celery and carrot sticks. “Can I have tea?” Castiel asked timidly.
“Not until you know what you’re committing to,” Cas said. He chuckled, then turned a little and put his hand on the wall. “If you fly with me, you are committing to be my bonded nest companion for the rest of our lives.”
“Yeah, Sammy, picture my surprise when I’m going on my honeymoon cruise and turns out some creeper’s been lying in bed with me. Well, since Jimmy the creeper seems to have an opinion on everything without necessarily wanting to share it, I thought I’d open up the floor.”
Dean drove down Chuckanut Drive with his arm around someone. A special someone. Someone whose come he’d just wiped off his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Yeah,” Dean said, reaching the plates down and grabbing some forks. Castiel looked at him, and he got out knives as well. Dean wanted to know how he did that, when most of the time he came off so meek and mild.
Somebody in P-town started calling him Dr. Frog, which he absolutely hated, so it stuck. He kind of did look like a frog. He and Dean had ‘dated’ twice (hooked up more than that) and Dean didn’t exactly hate him because the sex had been way hotter than he expected, but Ferg was a manipulative and bitter man with a grievance against his mother in particular and the world in general that made you wonder if he only got into veterinary medicine to give him an excuse to cut into something alive. Which was a horrible thing to think but plausible as hell once you met the guy. And then there was the whole ‘did he or didn’t he roofie me’ thing. He was still having trouble dealing with that so he did the best thing he could, he completely shoved it away, until he tried to date again.
“So you fucked off from our reception — did it ever occur to you that Jess is so worried she’s upstairs
Customers assumed he was friends with Dean because of how much Dean talked about him, which made him fidgety; it was true that Dean had been the high point of his week, the last little while.
“I would have flown him to Saturn, but he was angry and tired and wanted to go home,” Castiel said. “I admit it, I was disappointed.” Sam’s face as he realized Castiel was describing the behaviour of a toddler was priceless.
He didn’t seem to find it amusing, so Dean tucked his smile away with his hand. Castiel gave a gentle shrug.
“Well, it was easy to wreck then, because I left quietly and didn’t make a scene; you’re the ones with problems, not me.”
“Over the last year I’ve fallen in love with you,” Jimmy said. “It was not what I expected, and I felt torn over my Catholic teachings,” at which point Dean wasn’t feeling the honeymoon flight at all anymore, and said, “I’d like to go home now,” and they were back in the bunker, on their bed, in the dark.
Cas sounded dubious, and then cheerful. “If you say so. What’s the forecast for an overdose of dick?”
“What are you doing in a dump like this?” Ash asked. He recognized the name, and that he was local, and loaded, but otherwise was at a loss.
Speaking slowly, with a lot of pauses that helped him keep his cool, he filled Cas in on his childhood, in more detail than previously. Dean had roughly outlined his role in raising his brother, always on the edge of losing custody, but with a solid core of family friends who provided shelter and jobs and cars, the daily practical stuff you need to get by, when the chips are down. He didn’t need to go to them much, but Bobby and Ellen and Rufus and Missouri had prevented Dean and Sam from being split up. He talked about how they became his family, how much it meant to him when he could return the favor and help them with anything.
“Shut up,” Dean said. “Her sister in law called her a pervert if you can believe it. The shit they said was gross. I’m sorry I did it now, it was - it was – “
“Oh, so the flash and smoke I saw from your end of town was you,” Sam said, with what Cas considered to be witheringly fast response time.
involved! Why are they trying to kill you?” Dean asked. “If you owe money they break bones to motivate you, they don’t
“Ready when you are,” Dean tells them, and steps to the edge of the sigil. Short, clipped words pour from Sam’s mouth, and Dean hears the hiss of a match falling into the bowl. Jack closes his eyes, holds his hands downward, and spreads light from his fingertips across the sigil.
Neither Dean nor Castiel can comprehend what they’re seeing. Their minds race concurrently, neither having the courage to speak aloud.
Dean feels shame blooming. Firstly at the truth of the statement, but then at the realization that he’s instilled his own messed up baggage into this divine being, now lying beside him in a by-the-hour motel.
Dean has his palms cupping Cas's jaw before he realizes he's moved. "You don't understand how worried I was that I'd find you dead." Cas's brows turn down. "And that's not an option, alright? I can't do this without you. I was so desperate after a while, I thought I was hallucinating you. Hell, maybe I was. I mean, look at this mystical night club - this place is such a fever dream, I’m honestly not even sure if you’re here and alive, or if I’ve just finally cracked.”
In the last few minutes, purgatory's mock sun has well and truly set. The loss of haze from the entrance has left them in near darkness - except for the patches of crystal growing between the stones. Their subtle glow has brightened into a magnificent shine. Every edge and face splinters outward in a kaleidoscope of colors. The ceiling above them is illuminated too, clusters glittering like stars above their heads. The cave has transformed into a cocoon of prisms.
Cas ignores the jab. “Here, just...hook your hand behind my neck.” Dean does, and feels the rough scrape of concrete against his knuckles. “Good. That’s...better, that’s a stronger connection.”
The cave feels Heaven-sent. The irony of that isn’t lost on Dean. He just knows that if he considers it for another nanosecond on this colossally weird day, he’ll run headfirst into a tree. So instead he eyes the thick copse of trees surrounding it, and imagines the visibility it offers on such high ground. It isn’t a perfect shelter, but it’ll do for the night. Granted, he thinks, looking over his shoulder to the vampire and angel at his flank, anything besides an open clearing would do.
“It’s okay,” Sam says, pushing the water and ibuprofen closer to Dean. “Here. Looks like you had a rough night.”
Slowly, with just enough flare for it to be obvious he’s playing it up, Dean bows at the waist. He extends a hand towards Cas with a flourish, palm up, fingers loosely outstretched. He lifts his brows in question.
Cas had remained unconscious for most of the treacherous climb out of the ravine, draped over Dean’s shoulder. They should both be grateful for that, since his multiple bruised ribs had violently opposed the position as soon as he awoke. Once Dean had reached level ground, he’d shifted him into a bridal carry, but that’s not much better. It only means the wide gash on Cas’s hairline is gushing blood onto Dean’s shoulder, and his dislocated ankle is dangling tremulously with every step. The head injury has left him wobbly and confused in a way he’s never been before, which ratchets Dean’s worry up a few thousand notches.
A surprised sound escapes the back of Cas’s throat. He is stiff as a board for about three seconds, and then he absolutely melts in Dean’s arms.
The demon hisses in his ear. “There is no waking up from reality, boy. You’re mine, and no one is coming to save you.”
Dean rolls his eyes so hard Sam thinks he might pass out, but he doesn’t object. They trudge to the Impala in silence.
Alastair whistles. “Man, you sure know how to sweet talk a guy. Anyway, as I was saying. Dean here ain’t your Righteous Man, and he sure as hell ain’t goin’ nowhere. Isn’t that right?”
okay.” Cas declares fiercely, eyes flashing wild and panicked. “You are losing blood at a dangerous pace, and I’m clearly not enough of an angel anymore to withstand this weight for much longer.”
Once Sam ties it off, he sets about checking his brother’s pulse, pupillary response, and breathing. He wraps the rest of his jacket around the arm in an attempt to stem the bleeding. It seems like a losing battle to Cas, so he keeps his eyes on the phone. He has thought before that humans show a bizarre deference to emergency vehicles; pausing their own journeys, breaking roadway rules in order to make way for them. It’s the kind of unconditional respect Castiel always believed humans should show his Father, rather than each other. But in this moment, he cannot have anything but gratitude for how quickly the ambulance must be on its way.
it looks. The foot is bent at an unnatural angle, and the shin bones are jutting out way further than usual. A light sweep of his fingers confirms that nothing is broken, just that it's been violently wrenched out of place. The skin around the joint is beginning to flush an ugly purple, but despite the swelling Dean can see how he’ll have to pull to get it back where it belongs.
The bar is dim and hazy, floorboards creaking under their feet as they enter. Dean pops his collar and marches straight up to the bartender. Specks of dust swim around him, dancing in the warm overhead lights. “Two shots of whiskey,” Dean mutters to the man. Sam steps up beside him. “Oh, right, you’re here too. Make that three.”
"Humans are miraculous. I know that firsthand now because of you. But you were born with a soul, and were raised into your humanity. Iss who you are at your core.” Cas gestures at his bloody form. “I’m as soulless as I was as an angel. Just some celesel...cel...
Dean kneels on the ground, his knees grumbling in protest. He tentatively folds his hands over his chest. Then, he bows his head. He isn’t sure if he’s supposed to do any of it.
or whatever.” Dean weakly imitates that croaky voice from The Princess Bride, and then remembers at Cas’s blank look that he never gets the pop culture stuff. Damn, he’s gotta put that one at the top of their list. Cas would like it.
Cas cocks his head, listening to the shift from one jazz arrangement to another. He narrows his eyes at Dean, a mischievous twinkle glittering in rings of blue. “Have you?”
Dean chuckles. “We’ve got plenty of time for that, don’t you worry.” He wraps an arm around Cas’s shoulder and begins to lead him out of the room to partake in a more family oriented celebration.
“Hell.” Dean only manages to squeeze out a whisper. He looks at Cas again, inexplicably nervous that the angel will flutter off and leave him in this vulnerable moment, broken open and all alone. But Cas looks on steadily, patiently. God, he’s always so patient with Dean. More so than Dean deserves, that’s for damn sure.
Dean closes the distance and then they’re kissing, sweet and chaste. He moves his lips against Cas’s and tastes blood at the corner of his mouth. Dean presses in deeper, like he can say what he needs to say without any talking at all. He’s always been better at gesture than conversation.
Dean glares at the phone screen and drops his forehead to the coolness of the plastic toilet seat. Sam sympathy-texting him from the adjacent motel room is not nearly as comforting as either would like it to be. Dean has been knocked out of commission by a nasty stomach bug, and his brother sheepishly insisted on getting his own room to avoid contagion. He musters up the energy in his shaking fingers to type out a snarky reply.
My eyes should be turning black any second now, so I sure as fuck do not deserve to be resurrected like some righteous hero.”
Sam knocks the bottle out of Dean’s hand with such force it crashes to the floor. Mira barks once and runs from the room.
Sam blocks his path. “Dean, stop! Use your brain, here. You’re not going to drink yourself into a coma when there are actual things to be done!”
Anael nods to him before stabbing through a hellhound. This plan has been thoroughly discussed. He entrusts the fight to his siblings and prays the garrison is able to maintain their position here, so Castiel can proceed to find the Righteous Man alone. Once Dean Winchester’s soul is in hand, he will send his siblings a telepathic message and they will all fly skyward as one.
The rancid, rotting hunk of myocardium behind Dean’s sternum breaks. He’d call it a heart, but it stopped beating like one ages ago.
“Alright, buddy, hang in there.” Dean pulls onto the dirt road, one hand on the wheel and the other pressing down on the makeshift bandage. Cas keeps shifting his neck as if to move away from the painful pressure, but Dean doesn’t let him. “Hey, eyes open. If you fall asleep right now, you might not wake up.”
and a few that must be Enochian. But mostly it’s his name, repeated like it’s something holy. And Dean loves the way Cas says his name, the way he whispers it, and gasps it. He sucks and nips at the junction between neck and shoulder and Cas
. Cas’s hand on his left shoulder is vice-like and he can feel a pulsing in the handprint Cas left there before they officially met. Cas is holding onto him like he’s the only thing keeping him on Earth. (And Dean can be that, he can be an anchor and weigh him down, keep him from drifting and soaring too far.)
"Still hunting, huh?" He had this look of awe about him, and Dean was pretty sure he didn't look too different. But damn, the last time they saw each other they'd both assumed they'd be dead in ten years... or less.
Cas’s eyes do the happy squint thing and the corners of his lips turn upward. And the amount of sappy thoughts that come to Dean’s mind is far too many. (And it feels like his heart is doing some sort of happy song and dance, as stupid as that sounds.) (Goddamn feelings.)
Only two people could have known where he was going and only one of them tried to keep him from going.
"That old friend of mine I was catching up with? He was taking people and feeding them to a gold shitting monster-freak," he explained, thinking about all the stupid problems he'd started 'cause he hadn't frickin' talked about something with Sam or Cas. He wasn't gonna start shit like that again, not after all the shit they'd been through. Not with Jack around.
“What did Cas do to your neck?” Sam asks, gesturing to his right side (Dean’s left). Dean mirrors, his fingers finding the thing in question. Cas had tried to give him a few hickeys, which had ended up being all so close together with so much teeth and pressure, it stung to touch it. (Cas had apologized profusely, then apologized that he couldn’t heal it, and it had been cute. Not that Dean would ever admit that out loud.)
). The lighting in the bar was nice too, blues and pinks on the stage making for a fun atmosphere where they cast the shadows in purples. The rest was typical lighting, a classic wood bar, and natural floors.
"Always liked that crusty son of a bitch," the Lee really broke into a smile, "Remember that time he caught us wasted on a Hunt?"
"Dean! We looked snakes and tigers!" Jack exclaimed, all the energy of a comet and then some all condensed into a barely waist-height little boy. Dean wasn't sure if that was a nephil thing or just a kid thing.
Jack went on to ramble about birds and then back to snakes again 'cause the kid was strongly cemented in that snake phase. He listened with his head tilted back looking to the sky. The stars had come out and speckled the dark sky. The moon looked like a cookie with a bite out of it, and he could not remember if it was smaller than the night before or bigger.
Cas settled down beside him, stealing a sip from his mug every so often as he told the story. Jack watched his hands and his face as he recounted the tale of the brave and clever Queen Charlie and how she defeated an evil fairy who had been attacking her subjects. A story that was heavily edited, but still mostly true. And one day Dean would be able to tell Jack the full version.
He couldn't begin to understand why a person, a regular human person, would ever think it was okay to just kill someone else. Especially for something as stupid as money.
Cas’s eyes are dark. Narrowed with a dangerous intensity. In moments like these, you could tell that he was larger than life, larger than the kinda scrawny human body he inhabited. Dean had half a mind to run, surely he would be smited (smitten?
For all he knew, that was a weird or very personal thing to ask. Or Cas's wings were a sort spot, and since his year as a human and all they'd been a sore spot for a while. Dean didn't know much but the last he'd known they'd been half broken and misshapen and missing lots of feathers.
He woke up tied to a chair in a dingy grey basement, a needle and a tube feeding on his elbow to a door with a window with bars on it. A damn ugly fucker jumped back and forth to catch each drop of his blood as it slowly dripped out of the open end.
Dean tries to show Cas how to kiss better, leading by example and all that, tilting his head so that their noses don’t press together awkwardly. Cas, for what it’s worth (everything, it’s worth
The Servant, whose real name was Alastair Beck, tried to sue Castiel and lost his temper so badly during a deposition that he ended up being tranquillized and sent to the psychiatric ward of a local hospital.
Castiel noticed the stack of pancakes and bacon and the carafe of coffee and, still looking at the note, sat down to devour his breakfast. In his exhaustion, he had slept, all unknowing, as Dean cooked it, only a few yards away.
Castiel’s eyes weren’t blue any more. They were black. He was flushed and his pretty pink lips were pinker and fuller than ever. Dean leaned forward and nipped, super gently, on Castiel’s lower lip, then trailed nips and kisses along his jawline, down his neck to his collarbone.
“He said I can go help him kill them with gas if I don’t feel like paying for a truck; it will be a lot cheaper and I’ll have learned my lesson.”
“All of Dean’s, anyway,” Garth said. Dean shot him a look - that in the comic book universe would have punted him over Benny’s standup desk - and Benny chortled.
“I have a small inheritance from my uncle’s estate! She says that the last time she looked in on the account, it should be enough for schooling; you said I’d need to do that to make my way and I’ve been thinking about it.”
“Told ya,” Dean said. “Hang on to that money, you’ll need it for school, or getting yourself set up.”
Castiel’s eyes suddenly met his, and Dean felt his breath catch. They were so honest, so earnest, and held so many questions in their depths.
“What? so’s we can get dragged through the shit along with you?” Dean asked in disbelief. “Maybe you can work on your
“And I’ll go into my bedroom and let you talk,” Dean said, after dialling for Castiel and handing over the phone.

“My aunt can’t take me in. She said, ‘If you don’t mind living in a tent you can come here but I have no room because a refugee family from Guatemala just moved in with me!’”
“We’re past flirting. We’re promising each other a very sexy future, and we now have a track record. You made me come in my pants! Damn, dude, that’s me back in high school, squirming around under the railway bridge with Lee.”
“Dean, please, Mr. Dean is probably… some old redneck.” He, sneezes and looks surprised, he still hasn’t stopped staring at Cas. “Honestly, we waited way too late. I would rather fight monsters than shop this close to Christmas ever again.”
Cas is angry, truly furious for the first time since he’s been back and damn… Dean’s hot all over. His mouth goes dry, and, well, Cas has been staring at him for years— nothing new, but
Chest to chest, he can feel Dean breath, human instinct blinds him, he grinds lightly against him, watching curiously, seeing Dean’s face go wide with want.
“Oh nice, that works, cause uh, me too.” He holds Cas’ gaze for a long moment, hoping the angel gets what he’s trying to say in the same way he’s always understood.
Dean can remember the moment he explained to the angel that wind chimes serve no purpose other than to make people smile on days with bad weather. It’s what Bobby had told him years ago, he’d been about 8 at the time, and shocked that anyone would keep something around that didn’t kill, or feed a person.
He’s too beautiful for this simple space. The Angel belongs in a high place, exalted, worshipped, adored; not in this tiny kitchen in Kansas listening to the too-late confessions of a broken man.
.” He bursts out, teeth clenched, fighting the anxiety, locking away the deep seated emotions in the lowest part of his heart. “You don’t have to say it, I’ll pack my things.”
” He blushes but he isn’t sure why, there’s an intimacy to it that makes him want to run. He grips the edge of his chair with his free hand,
It shakes him up a little to notice new things about a man he's shared a considerable chunk of his life around. Kinda feels like realizing that you've been driving past your favorite restaurant every day for years because you were just bound and determined to eat somewhere familiar.
Dean’s laugh is instant, large, and infectious. Liam notes that there’s no trace of the bravado and fearsome nature he’d heard stories about.
“Teasing, teasing. Let me have my fun, I wouldn’t dare play with your toys without permission.” He sighs dramatically. “Upstairs it’s all
“Dean the Empty has one sole desire, to sleep.” Jack looks emotional. He’s just a kid saddled with literally everything. “What do you think it did to the one thing standing in its way?”
Liam, nods, watching the way the taller leans to say something private into the blue eyed one’s ear. The second smiles faintly, nodding at whatever is said his startling eyes traveling around the room with something more terrifying than mere curiosity. His attention shifts to the group of men who’d stopped in front of them, offering his hand in greeting.
"Uh huh. Not quite the same. Look, I'm not trying to force you into anything but like... you really never considered it?" Sam waits,
“Sorry it took me 10 years.” Dean says sheepishly. “I’d never had a friend before.” He snorts. “I’d never been in love before either,
Dean’s already stomping past like a pillar of fire made human, and is peevishly yanking random food from the fridge.
Sam's frown deepens, like he didn't already fucking know. Dean remembers fondly what it was like when Sam lived in reverent awe of him.
"Well, yeah Dean, We. Everyone who knew you two saw that you were important to each other. And I mean, can you blame us? If Cas was in trouble there wasn’t anything that could stop you. You
In what feels like a life long past they sat on adjacent park benches and discussed an uneasy alliance and the tet offensive, it was the first time Dean saw him smile, and
“What?” He brother is instantly shy and defensive, “They’re both green, both plants, both inedible. It’s Cas, he’s not gonna know the difference. He's just gonna wake up and be starving and boom—” He slides the bacon onto the plate with a flourish.
“Couple years now.” Krissy, kicks her head back to remember, still seemingly oblivious to his awe. “Big ol’ redneck shindig. Everyone who’s anyone in the hunter community invited, couple civvies too— you know Claire and Kaia? Claire’s Cas’ daughter. The Queen of hell officiated. Jack was their ring-bearer,
“Your memorization of that particular scripture will never fail to be astounding.” Cas remarks soullessly, all the while unashamedly checking Dean out.
A wide, clean breeze brushes across them; he’s never seen water like this. He opens his mouth a few times, snapping it shut and opening it as his throat tightens up with emotions he can’t quite name.
“Cooper’s Island.” He says, then points out over the water toward another land mass. “That is Bermuda.”
Dean fixes with him a stare. The unspoken reason lies heavy, they both know he wouldn’t ever have left his little brother. Sam smiles tensely, trying to make it look supportive, they don’t talk much about their dad anymore for good reason.
“Heaven.” He says simply, like it’s an everyday occurrence, like Dean doesn’t have an Angel in his room, sitting and adoring him for no reason other than he wants to, wants
Cas” She interrupts kindly, already adding a burger and fries into their digital register. “It was definitely a date. He paid right?”
“Love always is.” She says, with an understanding smile. “Maybe try talking to him? Speak of the devil—“
Cas squints, much of his first years near Dean was figuring out how to speak Winchester. He still wouldn’t say he was fluent, but it occasionally helped when Dean underestimated his understanding.
“Did you mean it?” Cas asks, sort of breathless, and out of character for him, endearing and (mostly) human.
“His grace. He’s hidden it so deeply, I can’t forcibly retrieve it without harming him. It’s so intertwined with his memories of you, it would rip him apart.”
Cas blinks slowly, looking more like himself, he reaches out and skeptically taps Dean on the shoulder, Dean smiles,
Cas has to get away. But there’s only these tiny snow swept streets, glittering lights overhead and—
“And you aren’t wearing underwear.” Cas’ voice sinks lower, he leans close and presses his lips nearly to Dean’s ear, the warmth of his breath tickles, he shudders in anticipation. “Is this your way of begging?”
Cas turns and smacks his back, wiping the goo gently from the other’s face, clearly concerned at their lack of movement. A trickle of grace glides across into them; Jack watches curiously. The unknown figure rolls onto his knees and retches black goo.
“Learn that from the pizza man?” Dean whispers half-cheeky, half-frustrated, Cas pulls them free, his thumb moving to rest on Dean’s bottom lip, worrying it with his thumbnail.
,” He repeats, dropping the rare, attention-grabbing use of the Angel’s full name for the second time that night. “There ya are, Cas, this here’s, my friend… Erin, she wants to know if we’d rather have a booth or table?”
Cas wants to argue but he’s not angry enough, and they’ve both had too much to drink. Instead, they hobble and weave their way down into the bunker. Dean steers toward Cas’ bedroom. The sound of talk and laughter comes from the kitchen area, Dean veers from the noise in annoyance.
“I do not recall that.” Cas can feel the uncomfortable beginnings of a human blush, his face dropping into what Dean fondly refers to as ‘resting bitch angel’, “And I have never once been adorable.”
“How’re Sam and Eileen?” Krissy asks, handing him her gun to inspect with his critical eye, he’s still half talking to the other group, mindlessly stripping down her gun with graceful expertise.
and told anyone who asked that he named it after his Dad. Erin knows, she’s met the other Bobby now, and despite the fact that she doesn’t know the supernatural details she somehow understands.
“I feel like an asshole now though, cause I definitely figured you’d look different— guess it teaches me not to subconsciously stereotype the sexy, lumberjack dad— I mean—
“What was that for?” Dean asks stupidly, still hasn’t opened his eyes. Sitting there like a dumbass on their kitchen floor with his eyes closed.
He whispers into Cas’ skin, his heart pounds with the blinding clarity of it. He looks up, impulsiveness driving, and moves to kiss him, this time going for the lips, clumsy; his balance is shit, he fumbles forward mostly brushing the Angel’s chin and cheek.
“Are you out of things that happened in my reality so you are reduced to fabricating now? Are you able to do that now? Because I do not recall this dream either. I do not understand why you show me—”
Dean’s forehead creases; Sam for a split second thinks maybe he’s been too obvious, maybe should have salted the word ‘bro’ or ‘buddy’ in a couple of times. But then a there’s a quick shrug of agreement and Dean is around the corner.
what I do to the things I touch. Cas, he was no different, he died for me, he came back, he died, I rip him out of his happy dean-free existence, and then just dump him—”
“Nah, but this might.” Another box from another pocket, this one smaller, plain and wooden. He pushes it into Cas’ hand a mix of shy and insistent.
.” Dean’s voice has dropped into that withering, hoarse tone he uses when he’s trying to be sincere and in the process has sort of panicked himself.
Jack, in his new understanding of being a deity had spoken cryptically about how Castiel’s grace was deteriorating his human form. He had not been overly clear on his plan, but calmly indicated that the Winchesters—
He pushes himself to his feet, wincing, forgetting about his injuries and how long it takes humans to heal, tipping slightly— Dean’s next to him immediately, arm around his waist.
After a few minutes he feels brave enough to open his eye again, the other apparently bandaged shut.
"Hey, hey, hey—“ Dean gambles, He knows he sounds like a fucking broken record, and grabs Cas' face, jerking his eyes and attention back to him. “Stay with me here Cas— Listen to me, we never stopped looking for you, never. I would fuckin' die trying before I could leave you like that. You know that.”
“I already did.” He says, charmingly against his lips, and Dean isn’t sure how he managed to forget that One: Castiel is
Dean seizes his wrist, shakes his head stubbornly. “It’s just cause I’ve been working outside on the house, probably some sort of damn cold. Listen, go out there and steal Sam’s other laptop, it’s in the library. Stop fussing— I’m fine.”
“Cause I want you to feel comfortable.” Dean retorts, hand now on the small of Cas’ back, pushing him to follow Erin. He only drops his hold on the Angel when they reach a booth at the back corner of the pub. Dean flashes a quick smile and excuses himself to go to “the little boys room”.
Castiel winces at the hunter’s anger. At least they are back in territory he feels accustomed to: Dean angry with him about something neither of them completely understand. It is far more familiar than whatever had been happening the past few days.
.” Cas moans, it becomes a repeated anthem of his name over and over as the Angel watches the hunter take him in over and over, and teasing touches brings him closer and closer to ecstasy.
old ladies, talks comfortably about guns and cars and hunting big game with the guys who wander in, is amused or purposefully oblivious to all young comers who try to flirt with him intentionally, but never
"Cause drinking your way to the bottom of every bottle in a 10 mile radius sure as hell isn't helping Cas—“
It’s worse this time around, being human: ripped unceremoniously from the endless darkness, flung into his host body; sealed in by Jack. He woke from his sleep of self-reproach to be driven almost exclusively by desires, by needs.
“I realize now that you said... what you said after the Werewolf fight, in jest.” Cas admits softly after a long, silent moment passes. “I
Sam stands outside the bunker and stares up to the sky. “I know it’s been a while, Jack says you’ve been busy with the uh, the Empty— and uh, everything, but I figured you’d want to know, it’s about Dean, he’s uh, he’s missing—”
“No.” Cas frowns, “I mean, yes, I knew Balthazar for eons Dean. Murdering him is one of my biggest regrets— but that has nothing to do with why I marked—“
Whole mess of vampires had taken up dwelling around some poorer neighborhoods outside of Chicago peeling kids off the street and leaving them desiccated pieces of jerky.
"No, cause I was part of the deal." He bites the inside of his lip and watches his palm bleed, "Saving me— it was— it would come for him and it would save
When he opens his eyes, they shine with fire, his blade is open in the air, shimmering and wreathed in flame. He takes a step forward, the darkness at his feet retreats with every step. This time, he feels the movement of spirits around him, the countless nameless multitudes beginning to stir, roused from their deep slumber by his words and memories.
He remembers how Dean had felt, the resigned despair ringed in agony. Dean was sure he was going to die, he felt the regret yes, but also
“I’m not leaving.” Cas says it simply, directly; answering the unspoken question that’s been on Dean’s mind all day.
“Well?” The Angel asks again, pressing into his space aggressively, his pupils large, expression fierce. “Leaving? Staying? Kindness? Anger? Hate? Desire? Decide what you want Dean.” His words are direct, rapid fire and merciless.
He knows he should apologize, grab him by the hands and tell him he’s sorry and all the rest of the things he’s been avoiding thinking about since Cas fucking died in front of him. He drops the bags to the floor and steps close grabbing Cas’ ice cold hands, unafraid for the first time as to who sees him.
Cas ignores the self-imposed warnings in his mind, He sees the way Dean is reliving his own regret, and as always his instinct is to rescue Dean, even from himself.
Belphegor, sits off to the side, cleaning his nails with a long jagged blade. “Do you really think I believe that?
Again you are blessed if you reviewed prior, I keep all of them in my heart. But honestly, thanks for reading.
“No, just me.” He can hear Cas smirking, the bastard, his hand settles over the top of Dean’s, kissing the back of his shoulder absently as he thrusts in deeper and deeper.
He even manages to go on few dates, hunters and civvies, guys and girls who’re bold enough to try to engage him in conversation that isn’t work related. He’s always surprised when they ask, but he never turns them down.
“The alley?” He breathes sharp with surprise, his hands slide down between Dean’s legs, the noise Dean makes is his answer. Every thought and desire Cas has held close over the past decade rips out of him in a boldness that could be blamed on a heady mix of rage and alcohol.
The wrinkles around Dean’s eyes deepen as he listens to the angel grouse. Cas tries not to notice, twisting vaguely against the hunter’s grip and being easily manhandled via ankle back into place.
“I have returned for all who you devoured!” He roars, his voice thundering across the vacuum, he thinks of all those lost and in pain, his wings unfurl with a roll of thunder, his grace intensifies, tearing at the seams of this vessel. “You
. But I felt— I felt as though I should tell you first, and ask your forgiveness, and then your permission.”
“Sam already knows, pretty sure Eileen would give us a high five.” Dean sneezes again, taking the duffel from the angel, already making his way down the hallway, Cas follows quietly. “I gotta teach you some sexier words.”
“If you keep starin’ like that, I’m gonna get embarrassed.” Dean murmurs sleepily, eyes still closed, his lips curled.
“And in the meantime you’re just gonna what? Explore your sexuality cause Cas is willing? Can’t you see that’s fucked up?”
“—Castiel Singer.” His husband interrupts, tiredly, on any other person (human) Liam would have called his tone, bitchy. “
He bucks at it; wonders if they’re asking for trouble. Yes, it might broker an uneasy peace, maybe an alliance but at what cost? Sam argues that melding the wisdom of age and established power
Cas piles blankets on him, ignores his protests, insisting the google told him it was a good idea, he chooses Lord of the Rings, Dean grumbles, mostly about the blankets.
A part of him, a sad pathetic part of him, hopes Dean will not let him walk away, which would be the opposite of classic Dean behavior.
Cas pulls his knees to his chest, the lamp continuing to blink erratically, now slower, the shadowy shapes no longer visible.
The sound, so infrequently heard stirs Dean to reach further. “You told me that, when we were done with all of this saving the world stuff, you would like to have a garden, tend bees. Yeah
When the ribs are sufficiently bound, Cas sags as much as he dares into the chair. His eyes have gone glassy again and his pulse is thready. Dean looks up at the motel’s grimy ceiling, his own eyes beginning to burn. This is so beyond wrong, he can’t even wrap his head around it. A fucking
Dean forces his eyes open. His vision is doing a damn good impression of those old school photographs, where the subject is ringed in fuzzy darkness. At the center of it are two blurry blue eyes, blinking back tears. He’s never seen Cas cry. But then again, Cas is going through a lot of firsts today. Dean wishes he had gotten him laid when he had the chance.
Dean pulls back enough just to whisper against Cas’s lips, their foreheads touching and their breaths mingling. “Let me make this crystal clear. I want you here, Cas. All the time. And if Heaven doesn’t, then that’s their loss, but
“Yeah, you really are.” It’s not a lie, but it probably sounds like one. Dean can’t imagine what all this must feel like to Cas, with his only frame of reference being the cold, distant way angels perceive human feelings.
“So you can’t get him out,” he mutters, misery seeping in like a winter chill through the warm spring air.
He tries to place this image in his head. Yellowed pages of mythology and lore flutter to the forefront. Where has he seen this creature? Wings. Hundreds of eyes. Blinding light.
“Dean,” Castiel breathes, moving into his space. Hands skate over Dean’s biceps, eyes scanning for the source of the blood.
“I remember screaming for help. For someone to get me out.” In an attempt to lighten the mood, Dean snaps and points finger guns at Cas like he’s giving him his cue. It doesn’t work. He concentrates instead on the warmth of Cas’s hip, inches from his own ear, and finds it grounding.
Right. Dean braces himself and turns to look at the arm that had burned like lava moments ago, and has now dulled to a throbbing ache. It’s-
“Oh,” Dean mutters. His voice comes out oddly calm, given the blasphemy that’s just powered up a light bulb above his head.
“Because I’m gonna pass out from blood loss soon, and I’m trying to stay awake as long as I can.” Dean focuses again on the warmth of the body above him, how stark a difference it is to the leeching cold of the stone at his back.
It takes Cas a moment to realize he’s not being attacked, but rather, embraced. Dean feels the instant he figures it out, because his hands set firmly against Dean’s spine and he hums against Dean’s ear. Dean clings harder, reveling in the slide of Cas’s palm up the nape of his neck. “I know.”
As quickly as it began, Cas’s shaking stops and the rock above Dean’s hand stops vibrating. Cas rolls his shoulders back a few millimeters and steadies his arms. Dean sees for the first time, maybe ever, there is pain in the lines of the angel’s face.
“Fine!" Cas shouts, voice cracking. "I don’t know how to be human! I am not equipped to handle the...the sensations, especially not here and now. I cannot take the physical pain, or the fear. This weight will literally and figuratively overwhelm me any minute. I am nearly powerless, you're in danger because of it, and I don’t know
Sam’s hands are on him. Blessedly warm, roughly calloused. He turns Cas over gently, and gasps at the sight of his brother. The crushed arm, now exposed, is mangled beyond belief. Blood seeps out from a dozen places, and the bones bend where there are decidedly no joints.
Dean could tell him all that. He could explain how good it makes him feel to have Cas here with him, how those small moments of joy have made up for so much other bullshit the world has put on their plate. But what kind of a purpose is that for someone who watched the birth of the universe? How could a human life beside
Eventually he has to drop his hand to the ground, weakness seeping through the rest of his limbs. Cas bites back something suspiciously like a sob at the loss of contact.
“I heard your prayer." Cas’s lips twist in amusement. "On this particular evening, it went something like, and I’m paraphrasing, ‘You’d better not be dead, you son of a bitch, or I swear I will kill you myself.’" He looks like he's holding in laughter.
And yet, as he watches flashes of that silver sword arch gracefully through the air, the voice in the back of his mind whispers to him once again.
Months after the Great Collapsing Witch Warehouse, there is still no sign of Cas’s grace returning to him. It’s an adjustment.
“Who wants to play some pool?” Dean slurs to the room of locals, lounging in darkened corners and puffing on cigarettes.
He pockets the phone and picks at the dirt beneath his fingernails. Minutes later, a flutter of wings sounds behind him.
They’re hitting the road in Bumfuck, Nowhere, heading west towards Bobby’s. Dean is about to slide into the driver’s seat for the first time in months, both hands aching for the smooth leather of Baby’s steering wheel. But the air has shifted since the doctor sawed off his cast, and he has to make sure one particular passenger still wants to be on board.
He and Sam follow in the Impala. The ambulance clears the road for them, and Sam practically tailgates their bumper. They’ve been told the hospital is a mere sixteen minutes away. All the same, the silence in the space of the front seat feels heavy and oppressive, dragging on for miles. Neither dares reach for the radio.
Another added benefit is that Cas always comes to dinner when Jack is present. Non-obviously Dean manages to snag a seat where he can watch the angel interact with his— with
“Tell me what you need.” Dean’s says from his knees, penitent of his own free will. Unbowed in his devotion.
Let’s just do exactly what I’ve been doing for 12 fuckin’ years and sweep it all under the rug.” Dean clenches his hand around the beer bottle, drains it dry in one pissed motion. “I’m gettin’ another beer.” and stands up jerkily, knees knocking into the table, not waiting for a reply.
"Then be serious Dean, and actually tell me all of it, cause all you've done so far, is drink and hide in the damn bunker." He sighs, "I don't know to help you cause won't talk to me, without…” He inclines his head toward the smaller pieces of the coffee cup in the sink, the bloodstained paper towel still clenched in Dean's hand.
“Not what I said.” He rumbles, pulling Cas back toward the bed, already leaning forward to tease the skin under the angel’s ear, he sniffs, pauses, nose wrinkling. “Cas, why do you smell like
Dean felt the same level of intense regret as he had in the moment when Castiel originally told him. He had quietly promised himself that when all this was over, he’d make sure there was something under the tree every damn year. He could even make up a birthday if he needed to.
," Dean stumbles, his ears already red, "When you uh, said that shit about me being the righteous man and you always um… well, it felt like vows.”
“Nah.” He replies in between bites of a pickle. “You died of old age, I think. Your hair actually got
“You know, Claire suggested we fight like normal people and just refuse to have sex with one another for a couple days—“
“He loves me.” Dean says, but he does see it, and he’s panicking, but he knows what it felt like last night, how waking up to him… fuck static and chick feelings and all that shit but it was one of the best mornings of his stupid tragedy of an existence.
from the guy who literally just spent the last few minutes... his eyes dart back to Cas' lips and instead of thoughts there's a neat little warm feeling in his mind.
Cas’ head drops onto Dean's shoulder, hypnotized by the sound of Dean’s voice, until slowly the shaking lessens and then stops entirely.
Dean catches Cas’ troubled gaze and holds it, crosses the empty kitchen and pulls Cas to his feet, inserting himself firmly between the two men.
Dean finishes, thrusting the cup of coffee at him along with an attempt at a smile, trying to make it less cocky than it felt. He can’t help it, he’s thrilled. It’s the first time he and Cas have spent more than two seconds alone in the same room since that night. He’s fucking
, he so loved that classic Dean Winchester smile. But all he can think about right now is how good it would feel to wipe that patented grin off of Dean Winchester’s face.
“Christmas shopping.” He replies dismally. “We have been in town for hours. He told to me to come here and eat, that I was
Next to it, a sticky note with step-by-step instructions on the right way to lace them and a tiny diagram of the holes and laces.
He reaches out toward Cas’ face, faltering midway, choosing to lay his hand nervously on the bench between them, his pinky just brushing against Cas’.
“No, hon, I mean, yeah, sorta, the tall ken doll lookin’ one, that’s Dean Winchester, I know, he seems like a dinosaur but I’d say he’s probably the most dangerous human here.”
The hunter finds himself on his belly, Cas’ arms bracketing his head. Dean twists, finding Cas’ lips; tries to soften it, to draw it out, to flirt and tease— he lets out a hiss when Cas’ fingers are already seeking his entrance, there’s no hesitation, like he owns everything about the action and Dean himself and
He grunts something in response and heads back into the office. Some guy brought in a busted up ’66 Camaro last night right before closing, Guy said he’d heard about Dean, heard he was the best.
They’ve been sleeping in the same room for two days, waking up together, falling asleep wrapped up in each other.
It’s not the first time he’s done this: mind filling with old memories of truck stops and bar alleys when John wouldn’t come home on time and the cash he left ran low. Of warm breath that smelled like cheap beer and felt like shame. Of faded bills dropped on the pavement with a snicker and the sound of a zipper.
“You know.” Dean saunters up, shit-eating grin growing wider and wider. “By law, if we are both under the mistletoe at the same time, we have to kiss.”
“Boning.” Dean finishes, confidence returned, his mouth curved, “Knockin’ boots—“ He forms a circle with the finger and thumb of one hand and then uses the other to do an in-and-out motion universally recognized by middle schoolers everywhere. “Spelunking the bat cave—“
It’s only when they are walking back out into the twinkling lights of Main Street, breath rising faintly between them, that the other shoe drops.
Cas may not understand why she’s speaking to him, but he does appreciate her appropriate use of air quotes.
Dean tends to throw himself into what he cares about with a reckless abandon that leans toward suicidal obsession.
It makes his skin itch, trying to have such an open mind. But he guesses maybe it’s fucking time. Maybe his dad and the men of letters were wrong.
He meets her eyes evenly, blue and infinite, and she wonders if anyone has ever disbelieved him when he looks like this.
“Yeah if you like him.” She laughs. “Why do you think he kicked you out of shopping? He’s trying to get you a surprise.”
After that the Angel makes an effort, he sits off to the side, content to listen to the Hunters talk and laugh and reminisce.
"So Balthazar," Dean adds two more slices of toast to the growing pile, and pulls coffee grounds out of his cabinet, "You know anything about the
night, cause that’s the shit you do when you fucking love each other for ten goddamn years. So how’s that strike ya, you abusive asshole?”
“Cas doesn’t think we should hunt so much anymore, spend more time with em’, they’re over at the house every five minutes away. Between nieces and nephews and all of
“Dean.” Cas interrupts, patiently, “Let him breathe. Not everyone is as eager to stare at my true form.”
“I would like to spend a life with you, Dean Winchester,” Cas continues, his elegy sincere, soft, reverent. “I will always answer your prayers, I will protect you with my physical form, and I will love you, and you alone, from this day forward until the end of my days.”
“But—that wasn’t—not just for like— you know— sex— um, that doesn’t excuse how I… I treated you. How I’ve always… treated you… But, I lied to you and I, Cas I need you to understand how sorry I am. For being selfish... for how angry I was, how I handled all of it.”
Dean shreds the paper and pauses, fingers drifting faintly on the outside of the simple sketchbook, when he looks up his eyes are big and shy.
“Well,” The Demon considers. “I wanted to hurt you, ya know, cause you smoked me and made me feel shitty about myself.” Another shrug, “Ever since I got shat out of the empty, I’ve been sorta…
“We uh, we didn’t have any of that organic honey shit you always liked. So it’s just plain… uh tea.”
let them do that to her.” He finally gets out. “Or you.” He adds, already reaching across the table, his fingers barely brush the back of Castiel’s knuckles before he catches himself; jerks his hand backward.
And talking it out like this has been,” He blows air through this nose. “Honestly it’s been great—weird as hell, but great. I just don’t want you rush into having something with Cas, because you’re actually letting yourself
His eyes slide shut, relieved tears leaking from underneath in relief, focuses on listening to the raindrops hit his roof. He leafs through the fuzzy memories, skips across the days of pain; pausing on the last few bursts of color and sensation—
“Cas.” He sighs, he feels too warm and annoyed with himself. “You’re the best friend I’ve ever had— no, shut up, Sam’s my brother, and you— you’re my best friend. Of course I like spending time with you. I mean… I also like seeing you naked— it’s a very confusing turn of events to be honest. I feel like I’m handling it
“No.” Disgust passes over his face at the suggestion. “God no, Sam, we got there, and the bartender, she definitely thought Cas and I were on a date…”
Unfortunately, Cas usually learned his routines within a day or two and by then can skillfully avoid him.
“You need… context.” He murmurs, and tilts his head up toward the night sky to avoid looking too closely at the man beside him.
Castiel looks up to the green plant taped clumsily to the door’s arch, squinting suspiciously first at the plant, then at Dean whose eyes sparkle. “Who enforces such a law?” He asks, Dean takes a big drink of his reindeer mug.
He’s too tired to argue with Dean tonight. He can’t let it sit for long, staying is too risky; his human nature makes him vulnerable. Now, with no purpose, and no war to win, it’s too easy to talk, to smile, to allow himself little daydreams.
Cas frowns, and seems to catch himself, the other faces fade into a mere shadow and he is quite suddenly just a man with a too-direct stare.
, kissing is like Dean Winchester 101. He’s fucking good at this. So he kisses back, cause well, Cas needs a damn good example of his skill set especially if the angel is just bound and determined to love him for the rest of their lives.
“You’re an asshole Dean.” Krissy informs, pulling Cas into a hug. “Good to see you guys. Always a good feeling to have Winchesters on your team.”
“Sure, sunshine.” Dean says to Cas, his eyes drop suddenly to Liam, voice lowering unexpectedly into an intimidating range, fixing Liam with a cool stare.
At least with darkness there may be the remembrance of light, but what can be compared to the absence of all?
By June he runs out of excuses, wipes his hands on a nearby rag, and sits down quietly in the back of their meeting.
He's on cruise control now; his brain a fuzzy haze of protective anger mixed with high, whining noise that feels a lot like truth..
Those words, from him after all this time, cut at Dean deeper than any knife. To his shame he panics, wavering, fighting the urge to run, to take a step back and hide from everything he was feeling— was trying to avoid feeling.
“Yes.” Cas agrees, he stands unexpectedly. Dean moves quicker, fear motivating him against his protesting wounds; he grabs hold of the Angel’s wrist.
Erin opens up after that, talks while they paint the walls of the coffee shop that closed, she brings leftovers and meals when they have to work all day; shoving them casually at Dean, telling him her mom’s the best cook in Kansas. After Dean tries her pie, he’s likely to believe her.
Before, There was sex, and it was raw, intense and mind blowing but never anything more than that, but now their bond is blown wide with the intensity of what they’re feeling. It’s multiplied and refracted between them.
second—Did you know about the fuckin’ deal too?” Somewhere Castiel is probably furious that Dean swearing in front of Jack.
He taps the box softly, still not looking up into Cas’ face, still intimidated by what he saw there, “
This is nothing new to the Angel as he has spent more than a decade adjacent to two conventionally attractive brothers. He takes it all in with irritation, and the self-satisfaction of being the only one who has seen the light which rolls off Dean Winchester’s soul.
Cas walks for hours in the snow to clear his head and breathe deep, It helps most times, being outside, able to see the sky. The Bunker had always represented safety and security, but since being back it has felt oddly stifling and now even the presence of Dean gives him a skittering sense of anxiety.
“My garrison, we were created for the hallowed art of battle. Warriors, assigned to protect and watch over earth until the arrival of the final day. We were renowned and feared among the legions of the adversary, and even
“Five fucking minutes.” Dean’s already on his feet, emergency lights blinking now. “All I want is just five peaceful damn minutes.”
. They’ve got him strung up like a rotisserie chicken.” Her eyelids drop, “Be careful, we’re lookin’ at a professional in there Wings, he’s cuttin’ on Dean with skill.”
“Uh, I uh, I knew, I knew something was different, after I came back— when I saw me, and Cas from the like alternate timeline shitscape back in ’09—”
Cas’ face softens. Dean tears his eyes away to look at Sam, daring him to react poorly even though they both know that’s not gonna happen. “We all on the same page?”
There’s the half smile, cracking like dawn across the Angel’s face, his hair’s lighter in this sun, softer, faded in places. The wrinkles around his eyes deepen, laugh lines, age lines, lines that show he stayed,
It’s cheesy, and awkward, Dean’s nearly forgotten how to talk to people who actually know him. Sam knows him better than anyone, loves him regardless; Asks him questions anyway.
Cas doesn’t even make it into the hallway before Dean follows with singular purpose; walking double time and in a single smooth move has him pulled by the shirt into the dark doorway of the infirmary,
“I’m always rude.” Dean’s eyes are heavy with flirtatious energy, “I’m starting to feel like you kinda like it.” The hunter tilts his hips; pajama bottoms doing nothing to hid his obvious desire.
For the first time in 10 months he reaches out across their bond: instantly gold-tipped pain and yearning comes screaming down their connection. The pain spikes unexpectedly and he leans into it, trying to pinpoint his charge’s location. The agony is overwhelming; excruciating in detail.
Dean’s head jerks shakily, he sighs, mildly relieved, but the sense of antipathy remains, vibrating low along their bond.
“Oh...” Cas nods his acquiescence, his eyes already on the sky. “I was less accustomed to human friendship initiation rituals then and… I quite eager to meet you.”
He reaches out and takes Jack’s hand, “I also think, that part of Chuck’s weakness was his loneliness. We saw it manifest itself in ways that hurt the ones he loved: his
“Yeah, you know, the holiday, the reason there’s lights and trees, Santa, baby Jesus. Ringing any bells? You’re an Angel… isn’t this like required learning in angel kindergarten?”
Cas wonders what that means about him, the two beings who he had been closest to shared many common traits.
I’ve had to deal with your ‘will they won’t they’ slowest burn of all time bullshit, staring at each other like.” He shudders. “Listen, I am
Dean runs a hand through his hair self consciously, it’s gotten so long that it tickles the top of his ears when he moves.
smuggest bastard ever to have wings and B: this whole war-bride thing suddenly doesn't sound so bad.
his back is covered in ugly red scratches, there’s a telltale hickey visible on the back of his thigh.
“Will that appease the Fae?” Cas asks, and Dean knows him so damn well he can hear the amusement in his voice.
A moment of razor sharp jealousy spikes in Dean, “Right, right.” He forces out, “Cause you were old pals upstairs.”
No one talks about Christmas Eve, the way Dean stood in his room in shock until Sam came looking for him. The way he let his brother wrap his arms around him while he sobbed soundlessly into his hands. How he cried until there were no more tears, Sam didn’t ask what happened, he just sat next to him.
“It’s thirty-two degrees Cas, roll up the damn window before you get sick.” But there’s no fire behind his words, he cranks up the heat in Baby, laying a hand on the dash fondly. Relieved that Cas' panic from before seems to have dissipated.
There is no urgency in Dean’s movements, nearly teasing, as he kneels in front of the Angel, looking up, biting his lip, Cas’ eyes glitter in the sunlight. The storm has passed in the night giving way to cloudless midwestern brightness.
Cas, on the other hand, had gotten the strangest look on his face, like he was trying to figure out how to work his cheeks and eyes. But he’d nodded, thanked Dean and walked outside to stare enraptured by the sound and motion. Dean watched as the odd Angel stood in the rain and smiled at the wind chimes. It was the first time Dean saw him smile.
Dean watches while Cas fumbles at the laces for a moment more before kneeling in front of him, ignoring Cas’ surprised intake of breath.
Of course, being Dean, that means he had gone through the Christmas Eve festivities with their family, found family, and whatever hunters were within driving distance, with his usual good-natured banter and only the barest hint of unease.
“What’s got your motor all revved?” Dean asks cheekily, settling his hands to a safer space, around Cas’ thick hips, digging into the strength of them. “Not at all complaining by the way—“
“I guess it makes sense though, some random guy calls up and says that he ‘used the google’ to find us.”
“Cas we don’t—“ He grabs Cas’ hands, stilling the motion. “We don’t have to— literally as soon as we are alone.”
He sits up, realizing both eyes seem to be up and running, kicking off covers, his left arm is in a cast from the elbow down, he could have sworn it was just fingers.
Dean's entire being feels pinched and tight, everything he's ever constructed folding in on itself, fight or flight engaged. He clears his throat,
He’s being held, his injuries are screaming painfully as blood begins to flow back into broken places.
Sam tucks an errant strand of hair behind his ear. "I just think, maybe you should be careful. Okay? You know I'm here for you, and Eileen and I—
present, he had noticed the AA meeting reminders on Dean’s calendar and isn’t exclusively an asshole.
“You are not wrong for finding solace in those memories, I have often found comfort during my hardest battles,” He chooses his words carefully, pausing between each and savoring the power of them, “In remembering good times with the people…
“— that was an alliance of necessity.” Cas informs him seriously, there are probably glaciers warmer than his tone. “She was aware of my lack of interest, which was reinforced when I declined the final step to our marriage,
,” Dean replies absently, already testing a couple of the pieces, getting charcoal smudges on their sheets. Dean looks up through his eyelashes, face bronzed by the wind and sun causing his freckles to stand out across his nose,
A strangled gasp comes out of the Angel’s lips, Dean is smiling even with his mouth full of Cas, humming happily while the Angel’s grip tightens, and he allows the Cas to guide his mouth back and forth. Gagging softly, the tip rubs the back of his throat; Cas rotates his hips in small motions, bringing tears to Dean’s eyes.
“Cas.” He can’t help it, he’ll beg, he just needs him to understand, to let him explain, explain… the static is back. “This wasn’t how it was supposed to— Cas I—“
Cas sighs uncomfortably, rolling his shoulders; tightening his grip on his blade.“Please open the portal Rowena.”
got flagged again; figured it was time for a nice change, get away from the legacy of you know, serial killing murder sprees, so you’re looking at Mr and Mr. Dean Singer—”
"I guess, I always just assumed you sorta, felt that way about him too. We all did." He scratches his ear and avoids eye contact.
“That was years ago.” Cas replies, still staring out the window, cheek pressed against the glass, it fogs up with each exhale, he doesn't seem to notice.
at the sight of Castiel: Angel of the Lord, Vessel of Mercy, Warrior of Heaven standing in the doorway of his room in a blue flannel that Dean had worn maybe once (not his color, according to an Elle magazine he’d picked up ‘by accident’ during a stakeout), and a pair of Dean’s tightest old jeans. They’re hanging so loose off his hips that Dean makes a mental note to buy him a belt, or stop looking at the way his hipbones show below the
, I mean, um, it was very difficult,” He assures, “Nearly a constant battle against my desire for… intercourse.”
“Cas, I made uh, fajitas, there’s leftovers on the… top… shelf.” The Angel is already shoulders deep in the fridge by the time he finishes his sentence.
“No.” A quick grin, a twist of pink tongue swiping over them, “This is real.” Then as an afterthought, “Happy Birthday Dean.” enjoying the way Dean’s whole body coils tighter and tighter. He keeps looking around, bouncing eagerly on the balls of his feet.
“I think it would be a worthy legacy Dean Winchester.” He replies, filled with a sudden sense of pride over the man next to him, “Have you spoken with Sam about it?”
Cas is there (always), tucking the abandoned boots into the bag, handling the socks with distaste and amusement. He pulls out a pair of sandals, ready to hand them over; but Dean’s already rolling his jeans up to his knees, smiling widely as he’s tears off toward the water, whooping in glee when he feels the January chill.
Cas chuckles, “Even in your weakened state, you fought me, in my true form; Understandably, you could not know my purpose was rescue. But I could not fight the hoards of hell
Sam makes it to the sink, nodding faintly at his dilemma, filling a cup and trying to avoid direct eye contact.
“You have made your decision.” Jack says when Dean’s voice trickles in from the other room, he’s singing along with a record, his voice rough and happy, “Rowena and Amara have a bet. Amara will be disappointed you decided to stay.”
“We’ll need help.” Balthazar intones, his eyes are lazy, but calculated, darting over the building with an expert gaze. “Whoever is in there is anticipating that you won’t be able to stay away.”
you, Cas, last thursday, in my living room. And honestly I’m pretty sure you kissed me back, so here we are.” If he says
Cas seems to relax, nodding faintly, Dean becomes aware of his hands still holding Cas'. He drops them nervously and clears his throat.
“It’s fine Dean.” He repeats, finding his voice, and carefully empties his glass of water with only the barest tremble to his fingers, straightening his napkin, picking at his fingernails. “There was never time.”
.” He gasps, and everything compresses into the feeling of Cas inside him, moving and filling, he gasps.
Cas finds himself flipped onto his back, feels the familiar rush of watching Dean’s skill as a hunter repurposed into other parts of his life.
are always bubbling up, vying for the surface— it doesn’t help with Dean acting the way he has. Everything was easier when he thought the hunter was just waiting to ask a favor.
Cas shrugs, sinking elegantly into the overstuffed chair. “Full again, hopeful for the first time in ages, I’m sure Jack has told you—“
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” He plays with the keys still in the ignition, “You know, we have a lot of extra bedrooms. And uh, you’re pretty above average for an ex-angel…”
“Which shit?" He asks, "The part where he defended our best friend against a homophobic asshole? Or when he actually let himself be happy after spending most of his life being brainwashed by our crap childhood?” He steps aside, gesturing for John to pass.
Something stirs at the base of his memories, familiar and cold, like an echo in a darkened room. Cas reaches for it, but it slips and squelches away.
Minutes before Cas had entered, nodding at Sam and Eileen, she has her feet propped up in Sam’s lap, pouring over bunker schematics and planning in low tones. The Angel had greeted them politely, looking flushed and confused, waiting just long enough to be acceptable before making a break for his room.
They group up nervously, more out of being habitual outsiders than anything. Twenty or so hunters standing in a dank in-between alley in a big city.
The only place left is Dean’s heavy wardrobe, an original to the bunker, He sighs and pulls the thick wooden doors open. Digging aimlessly, until he sees a glint of tacky red paper tucked behind familiar dark green fabric.

“Have you decided about your vessel? I can see that it’s getting worse. You pushed too hard in the Empty
has a minor crush on.” He takes a lingering drink of his wine and sighs. “I have nothing poor to say about your son, Castiel don’t get prickly on me. You did well. He’s a good one.”
Dean wakes up one morning; looks in the mirror and doesn’t recognize himself— can’t remember most of the past 90 days— he smashes every liquor bottle in his house in a rage, then sits down against the wall and stares at nothing until it gets too dark to see.
“Does it scare you?” He asks suddenly, and he looks like the same little kid who tried to impress his dad and brother with card tricks.
Jack’s young face relaxes and his sunshine smile returns. “It is perhaps better that he is not here. I have things to tell you.”
Sam blinks twice, somehow less shocked than Dean expected, "Oh." And there it was, the immediate empathy and borderline pity, Sam's face
, pining for 12 years, might as well give him a nice send off. Especially after I confess my…“ He swallows around self-disgust and dark emotions he can barely name. “—
His brother, far from stupid, cycles through a fairly typical set of lingo learned almost exclusively from Westerns, late night television, and his brief interludes as a pseudo-normal teenager. “Dean, why—“
“So I was what? A joke?” The Angel is so angry- and his newly released grace is fueling the rage and embarrassment he feels. “I mean- it’s been a while since you had Angel isn’t it? Probably doing me a favor right?
Cas watches him with sticky concern, by now others are being dragged back through the tear, all in similar states of confusion and disarray.
His brother is humming, making coffee and pancakes, apron’s tied off around his waist, hotdog pajama bottoms on display. Cas is sitting at the bar, signing animatedly to Eileen, who is laughing infectiously.
When Dean finally finishes flipping pancakes and comes to take a seat, Sam notices curiously that he sits more gingerly than usual. Cas eyes him with concern, they share a charged look; Dean winks, Cas looks down at his plate. Uncomfortable but not displeased.
Dean winks, now high on his victory. “Uh, let’s see… you told me the one time you talked me into going to that Farmer’s market down in Arizona, that succulents remind you of me. Still don’t know what that means.”
His ears catch sudden fire, and he blinks, glad this one isn’t a fucking video chat, and mutters. “He told you about that?”
Cas nods overly seriously, wondering how far he can take this particular amusement, “It has been done in the past, to specify spoils of war for those pledged exclusively to a member of the Host. There was a great deal of angel worship during certain eras...” His face is a interesting mix of nostalgia and gloomy disgust.
The door slams inward, two beautiful and terrifying creatures burst in, their swords gleam like fire and ice, their presence suffocates with barely repressed grace.
"Oh fuck. Sorry man…” Dean brushes past the Angel, his hands barely graze Cas’ side as he does. He’s so busy willing himself not to react that he misses the way the Angel wrenches back, his lips curl into a snarl,
I kissed him Sam.” Dean looks like he stuck a fork in a toaster now that he’s said it out loud. “Yep, I did… that thing I just said.”
“Shut up jackwad. I’m never telling you anything ever again.” Dean frowns. “And Sam, when you tell Eileen about this later… do me a fuckin’ favor and
, the psychic, he’s a witch like you right? The one that’s been getting all you magic-types and shit, out to help us fight? Eileen— his partner— she’s pregnant
was fuckin’ hot.” He says, pressing a kiss to Cas' bare thigh, the angel looks sex hazy and relaxed. He allows Dean to climb up, straddle him and kiss him, tasting himself on the other’s tongue.
“What? Fake it til you make it? You knew I’d never leave you willingly. I mean— I died for you didn’t it?” He laughs frantically and it’s an ugly sound, steps away, dropping the jacket, Dean can see how his hands are shaking.
Dean refuses to let himself be intimidated by the ancient Eldritch being who (often) shares his bed and (recently) his life and sits heavily, Cas sighs and shifts on the bench, not quite away from him, but just enough to let Dean know he isn't pleased.
, he realizes that there is not enough paper in the world to hold all that he would be willing to say about the man frowning down at a sketchbook with charcoal smeared down the side of his face.
Cas searches his face for the truth in those words, straining like he wants to believe him. Dean feels his heart in his throat, it’s beating so fast he can barely think.
He reads for a long time, lost in the familiar words; feels Cas’ eyes before he looks up, knows they’ll be a little swollen and too-blue and his heart’ll do crunchy things when he sees them.
“He loves me.“ Castiel says, ducking his head shyly, a gesture softened by Balthazar knowing him for many years.
It feels like a dream: an Angel sitting in his kitchen looking soft and rumpled, no suit jacket, no tie, just a simple white shirt, buttons undone or ripped off. The barest shadow lingers around his broad shoulders, his knuckles are bloody and unhealed.
he comes in and sits at the bar, lookin’ awkward, and then orders every gourmet peanut butter and jelly we offer, drank a couple of craft beers and talks nonstop about you, ‘
Dean scrubs his hair and paces, pouring himself a glass of whiskey, taking a sip. He sets it back down, walks two feet away and then stomps back and picked it up again, draining it.
” Cas’ voice is fierce and so loud, sounds like a thousand voices, it hurts Dean’s ears. The lights buzz and brighten, a familiar whine keeps increasing, and Dean finally notices what Cas is holding.
Cas grumbles softly at his movement, hand shifting absently. It’s taken some getting used to, sleeping with someone.
The angel cuts him off, exploding forward in a flurry of motion and energy; Dean is kissed, savored, devoured. He can’t help but arch up into the feeling of Cas’ tongue sliding against his, and chapped lips on his own.
Call went out from a beat cop who knew the life, to any hunters in the area. The size of the nest was a little more than the normal teams could handle, even the ones boosted by angelic help or even the rare hedgewitches and magic users who had popped up partnered with various teams.
" His voice breaks on the last few words, turns and slams the empty coffee cup into the sink, shoulders dipping in weariness, head bowed.
Castiel— angel of heaven, beginner of Harems— nods, in what is perhaps the most patronizing of manners. “That is correct Dean,” He pats Dean's shoulder gently, "You are
Dean yelps, dropping his tools with a clatter, clutching his heart, remaining on his knees, sweat dripping off his forehead.
Yesterday He and Dean had gone through the presents Dean had ordered one by one and Cas had discovered that Dean is good at many things; wrapping gifts is not one of them.
Of course sir.” Liam responds earnestly, regretting ever speaking, wishing somehow he could melt into the bricks around them.
, you’re right. He’s an Angel, they don't, they don't feel stuff that way." Dean stumbles over the words, “Like you know,
They appear to be a repeated variation of “I am well. Do not worry.” And an odd assortment of emojis, it’s phrased so awkward and stilted that it’s followed up by several even
Two men sit off to the side, the first keeps a sawed off shotgun precariously balanced on his knees, his forearms are covered with intricate designs and pictures in deep black ink. The other man, obviously a companion for he stands too close to be a stranger; broader shoulders, messy dark hair, beard shot with grey, a wicked looking blade held loosely in practiced fingers and at a careful glance quite a few others stashed beneath his clothes.
thankful if you don’ make me return to those Winchesters boys with bad news about their favorite blue-eyed-boy. You know, I would hate to disappoint Samuel for personal reasons. But, our Dean Winchester would hunt me endlessly if you were to perish.”
. He doesn’t add, choosing the safer, “In hindsight, timing does not matter, it was the actions after.”
" His voice cracks, the words sound painful. The ancient coffee machine is hissing now, burbling and steaming, Sam remembers how it used to terrify Jack.
Cas rolls his eyes, but he smiles, a small just-for-Dean smile, and Dean’s heart catches in his chest.
Sam can't help but worry because Dean is free and at they're at peace and he is somehow worse off than before.
His eyes are drawn to something on the shoulder. He knows dried blood, he’s cleaned it out of his coat many a time. Cas pauses, flipping on the lamp absently and peering closely.
As soon as they’re through his door, Cas tries to pull away. He hopes desperately that Dean, for the first time in his life, will get the hint.
Cas is staring at the kale in confusion, before sticking it in his mouth with a shrug, “He kept putting it up where people had to cross paths…” He doesn’t look up at Dean.
“Sorry bud, I was just teasin’ nice to meet ya.” Dean reaches down and pulls Liam effortlessly to his feet.
He feels like he can’t breathe, the bunker hall suddenly feels as tight as his chest. He bites down, trying not to lock his knees.
"I told her that wouldn’t work, since I live with an insatiable, and somewhat depraved former angel.”
“Dean.” He says seriously, leaning close. Dean has to pretend that the way he says his name doesn’t do something crazy to his insides, but then he'd have to admit that it's been doing that since day one. “I would like to apologize to you in advance for whatever I may do if he pushes.”
"Huh," he filed that away for future, non-phone conversations. Because he was getting really damn curious about this.
, and he wouldn’t get to see all that pretty skin). (And no, he was not gonna think about how he shouldn’t be thinking that about Cas’s skin). (And he was not gonna think about it because Cas was a dude… maybe). (Correction, he wasn’t gonna think of it because Cas
"I'll be here, Dean," the quiet seriousness and surety of the seraph's tone is like warm water on aching muscles, pulling the tension out of him. After what he just did, a lot of him feels like he doesn't deserve that. But the rest of him is so relieved from the comfort Cas provides.
And since Dean’s done (maybe) (probably) being a coward, he lets his tongue into the equation, slipping it out against the seam of Cas’s ridiculous lips. Then his tongue is in Cas’s mouth and he didn’t think he’d get this far. Cas’s mouth tastes like hard liquor and like any other human mouth, but it’s also better because it’s Cas’s mouth. (And as much as it doesn’t make sense, it also
Cas hasn't moved his stare from Dean's mouth, and while his face is flushed he doesn't look like he gives a damn that they have an audience. He's like laser-focused. And that's what decides it. Last night on Earth and all. Dean's already gotten kissed by this angel, he might as well continue and see where this goes, before he goes chicken shit and loses his nerve.
"I'm sorry for asking about your wings, I shouldn't have and-" he had been waiting to apologize and he was not going to do something stupid like avoiding the subject for the indefinite future.
But that was tomorrow. Tonight, he settled against Cas, relaxing into the seraph's hold. Letting the angel hum to him and run a calloused hand through his hair.
"You have too much faith in me, I spent nine and a half of those a complete idiot growing a crush the size of frickin' Montana and never said a damn thing,"
he could see straight through Dean. Through all the layers of B.S. Cas became more human and he became more of who he actually wanted to be and less of the layered violence and obedience John had taught him.
Interviewing Sally hadn't been as helpful as he thought, besides highlighting just how quickly the girl and her car had vanished.
Cas’s lips don’t taste like much of anything, maybe spit, maybe a bit of alcohol, but they’re fucking delicious all the same. Because they’re Cas’s lips, Dean can’t fucking get enough of them. Pink and spit-slick and swollen. They feel amazing against his lips and almost better between his teeth with the whine that it pulls from Cas. Cas’s tongue tastes like less but it’s wonderful to feel against his, exploring his mouth with reverence and wonder that Dean distantly feels undeserving of (but it’s so
Instead of a verbal question or answer Cas leans in closer, face flushed, so that their warm breath is mixing, so that their noses are less than a hair away from each other. It’s a request. (And Dean can’t pinpoint how he knows that, but he
(he hopes it isn't the window-sill salt) before his tongue is back on Cas’s throat and he's realizing just how still Cas has become.
"Alright, you can keep it, just don't let me catch you glued to the screen." she teased, pointing a finger at him in accusation. He pocketed the phone.
It was a good morning, he was glad for everything he'd done and everything done to him, for having led him to this.
Lee could have done all this for himself without the freaky fish-man looking monster in the basement, it was possible. But he'd taken the frickin' easy awful way out. He chose to become another monster by frickin' proximity than actually work for the life he wanted. He acted like the world frickin' owed him the damn bar and the nice life, and maybe it did at some point, but not when it cost people their blood, their lives.
Dean grinned, he'd been the one to sign up for this, and he sure as heck would not complain now. Not after he'd seen what he could've become.
“Good morning,” he chokes out, blinking like a frickin’ moron. (They might’ve worked out some of their communication and feelings issues but it would still take a while for Dean to get used to this.) (To get used to someone caring about him.) (Someone who he didn’t raise or save or fix-up cars for.) (But,
"Yeah!" he laughed until his sides were sore and the quiet dragged along comfortably. "Okay, I really need to call them now,"
"If you want," he chuckled, glad that they'd gotten those oatmeal squares that Jack seemed to like as much as cookie crunch (which Sam hated with a passion), with less sugar and more of the vitamins and mineral things that Jack needed as a growing boy. He was a sweet and wonderful kid, but toddlers did not need that much sugar for breakfast unless the idea was to kill the toddler's parents.
. With all the gusto and strength and none of the abandon and absolutely no damn experience or practical knowledge of how to do so. And
Somehow Cas loses his tie, this is after god knows how many shots of hard liquor (anyone else would’a been dead an hour ago). And his shirt is unbuttoned at least three or four down from the collar. The line of Cas’s throat, and all the skin… it sure was something pretty to look at. Angelic skin normally covered up by Cas’s holy tax-accountant get-up. Dean was hungry or maybe he was thirsty and that skin looked fucking delicious. (Damn he needed a good fuck, but the idea of going to get some was unthinkable, then he’d have to
for you Dean, I care about you, Dean, you are my-” Dean wonders if Cas would be so honest if he wasn’t tipsy. (He would be, Cas doesn’t really do anything except brutal honesty.) (And Cas doesn’t lie to him, Dean knows that but doesn’t wanna think about how he knows it.)
“Were those your first?” he asks, even though he is pretty sure, what with Cas being a virgin and all.
He almost propositioned Jo before his stomach caught up to him, and helpfully reminded him that if anything she was a little sister or annoying younger cousin and that was past stupid and firmly in the realm of gross. And even if they didn’t have a history, he wasn’t that much into blondes anymore.
"Yeah, I wasn't sure I'd even fit in a family, but Cas has always been good at pulling me outta my bullshit,"
and I met, -" Lee gave him an impressed raised eyebrow and Dean almost shoved him for that,  "-Damn!- eleven years ago, and first it was a mostly business thing, I had to work with him and he had to work with me, and I thought he was a dick," he starts the story, leaving out the angel thing becuase he did not have the time to try to explain that, or to explain how Cas was the one who pulled him out of hell and oh yeah he'd been in hell and died more than a half a dozen times now, "then I met the rest of his ...hunting crew and turns out he was the awkward one, the rest of them are dicks on purpose, and long story short he became my best friend and we couldn't ever stay away from each other long. Even when we were idiots,"
Not that he could ever change that schedule up, 'cause that kid had baby blues that could rival Cas's, and being that he was two, he was intrinsically blessed with the gift of the best puppy pout in the world.
. He and Lee slapped their hands together in that half clap, half handshake half high-five thing they always did. (And he only briefly thought about how Cas would frown and tell him
Dean wakes up to find himself leaning back against a warm chest, fingers gently petting through his hair. He’s somehow got himself sitting half-sideways inbetween Cas’s legs, with his head against the angel’s shoulder. He doesn't quite remember how he got in that position and is not surprised to find his flannel thrown on the front bench seat with Cas’s trench coat. Cas’s blazer is still on, though it’s wrinkled to all hell and his shirt is still very much unbuttoned and pulled to the side to display the hickeys Dean had given him. Cas’s eyes are lidded with a softness that makes Dean’s heart stutter and his stomach roll.
"Someone's gotta look out for the little guys," he bit out, scowling at the door and the monster beyond it, glad he didn't have to look at the metaphorical monster Lee had become.
"But story!" Jack whined, he was probably pouting with that little bottom lips wobbling and his big puppy eyes all sad and pleading.
Oh. Huh. That was one way of getting people to engage with others. Though what person who could go to a bar and sit on their phone the whole time didn't seem like a person that existed in the real world to him. Vamps, Angels, Demons, Nephilim, frickin' Jefferson Starships? Those were real, a person sitting on their frickin' phone at a bar? Nah.
. But it's a different skin taste than Dean's, not that Dean has licked himself outside of getting wing sauce and fry seasoning off his fingers and lips. He drags his tongue up the column of Cas’s throat, quickly dumps the thing of salt Sam gave him from fucking
Even like this the way Cas touches him, kisses him feels good, pure, it feels like praise and faith. (And Cas has that in him, faith.) Cas kisses and touches him like he’s going to pop out of existence any second, like he doesn’t have enough time to cherish it. So instead he savors Dean with a righteous fury, an intensity like wind tearing at your clothes and biting at your skin. And surely this must be a sin, how good this feels, and yet it makes him feel holy.
Cas’s ridiculous lips are ridiculously plush and still wet from where he’d licked them. This kiss is sweet, but not in flavor. It’s intensely warm and the fire in his chest is so much more than lust. That feeling is Cas. It’s warmth and fondness and comradery. It’s the smell of the grass after a thunderstorm and it’s the warm summer wind that carried the storm. And it’s Cas,
Then Dean chokes on his own spit like a fucking moron. When he looks up Cas leaning towards him with concern, a hand reaching to steady him.
Bobby makes them pose for a group picture and they try to ignore the fact that he might be left in this house alone after tomorrow, with all the rest of them dead and gone.
Everything in the world sounded better when described in the limited words of an excited two-and-a-half-year-old nephil, even snakes.
Dean can’t trust himself to say something, so instead he moves to taste that smile and see if it is as sweet as it looks. (It is.) (And he feels like a blushing stupid teenager for even thinking that.)
At least the monster's body disintegrated to ash. Lee burned that poor girl's body, to keep her from haunting him. That only leaves him to deal with.
"What are you doing while you wait?" Cas asked with a sort of hum, Dean imagined that he was stirring one of those nutritional microwave mac-and-cheese meals they packed so that it was heated evenly for Jack's dinner. Or maybe he had ordered something for delivery and was helping Jack reach the sink to wash his little hands. Whatever it was Cas would have that fond eye-smile thing on his face, the corners of his eyes crinkling and making him look like a soft middle-aged father. Which Dean supposed they both were at this point, since he was 40 now.
And one of the lovely benefits of having the road to yourself is that the speed limit was even more flexible than usual.
said that.) He hadn’t even noticed his mouth moving until the words were out, in the open. And he decides that he’s already come
"I was wondering when one of you idjits would do something," Bobby says, "Been getting sick of this 'just friends' bullshit,"
"I'm sorry, man." Lee's voice had that sad sincerity thing he did between hunts when they were young, when the jokes were over and they were patching up, when they had nobody to pretend to be alright for.
Cas caught him and held him. Dean clung onto him, and his silly plaid-lined trench coat. To keep his hands from shaking he fisted them into the weird flap thing that fell over Cas's shoulder blades. Almost like it was to cover a hole in the coat from which Cas could stick his wings out of.
He wanted to slap himself. Lee had been acting weird and cagey every time he'd brought up that missing girl. But he hadn't seen the guy in almost fifteen years and he'd wanted to believe that his friend (though he was hardly that anymore) had gotten out of the life. That he'd made something good of himself because people could do that, not because he's been keeping a monster in the basement and been feeding it people for the better part of one and a half decades.
From the looks of it, Ellen had challenged Cas to a round of shots. Which was a damn stupid idea. But what the hell? They were gonna try to corner the devil the next morning, so in all likelihood, this was their last night on Earth. So why not do something stupid and fun?
His eyes passed over the singer, decent voice, live music was always better than... Wait a frickin' minute.
, it really has been a long frickin' time. He can feel his mouth pulling one of those cut-your-face-in-half grins that Jack has mastered.
an angel, you’re- you could-” Dean can’t honestly say that Cas could kiss anyone, not with the way he’d handled the Chastity situation, and if that hadn’t been a fluke? “What do ya want to kiss me for?”
"Let me show you," he fished the phone from his pocket, opening it up to one of the other pics Cas sent.
And yes, Dean remembers, he remembers vividly. He remembers being fifteen and more than a little tipsy. He remembers the room swimming and looking at Lee just a little too much, and touching him just a little too much. He remembers drunk sloppy teenage kisses. And most of all he remembers John coming in, tearing them apart, dragging his out to the impala. He remembers the cold ice of fear in his heart sitting in the passenger seat, he remembers the choice words Dad had given him that day, about what made a
"Tell you what, he always liked you though, he always liked you," Dean said, his smile feeling a little less forced. At least he doesn't feel bitter about that anymore.
"I'm trying to find the only witness, then I'll figure where the victim's car went," he explained, "I don't think she just drove off, but it could be one of those normal human kidnappings," he shrugged.
"Soon as I burn the body," he answered, pulling his hand away from his face, his eyes were starting to burn from the pressure. "I don't think I could sleep alone tonight," he admitted.
And he can’t take it back now, he’s said it and Cas already heard it and they’re both tipsy, and probably dying the next day so maybe it’s okay that he’s being so monumentally frickin’ stupid.
Cas’s blue (so blue) eyes are dark and hooded, not quite hazy but definitely determined and lustful. His hair is a worse fucking mess than usual, his trench coat and dark blazer hanging off his shoulders and his shirt partially unbuttoned and collar pulled to the side. Flushed face, flushed and marked neck, swollen, wet lips.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know a better word,” Cas says, and Dean is going to find some way to keep his mouth closed so that he doesn’t- (Wait a second, a
.) (And because Dean shouldn’t want him to be.) (But his traitor of a heart still asks why he shouldn’t want that.)
