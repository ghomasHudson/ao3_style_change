“Nah, I’ll be alright for a minute. I’ve missed our hugs today, far too much excitement for cuddles with Daddy, though I can’t blame her. She’s like her father, always wanting to get into everything,” John said.
‘It would never be my intention to speak ill of an acquaintances marriage but I do not believe Mr Lestrade is very happy currently no,’ the look of the Landlady’s face is entirely to knowing and Mycroft wonders when he started allowing sentiment to play on his face so clearly.
‘She could have, I acknowledge that, however it has always struck me as odd the timing of Sherlock’s actions as well as the manner, he made the effort to get clean and I imagine this is why. This child, perhaps not in a solid form but the idea of her, of a child, my brother may have worn a facade of ice but he adored children, their natural curiosity and sense of adventure, he would have jumped at the chance to be a father, lost his heart over the idea of his child being in the world. I do not doubt this.’
“Alright, we’re straying from the point gentlemen. Moriarty identified those Sherlock was closest too, the three of you and placed a hit on each of you.”
‘I don’t understand what you mean Mrs. Hudson, sorry, what’s happened with Greg?’
“About fifteen minutes ma’am.”
‘Sir would you like to leave?’ it’s the man in the overcoat again, he’s looking with concern at Greg like he’s the one mortally injured, not injured dead, Code Zero, Code Zero, it keeps running through his head again. He looks to his team again but they’re wrapped in each other, he can’t offer them comfort, not now.
Sherlock could not sleep in the rain once he noticed it.
Mrs Hudson speaks first, ‘Mina sweetheart, did you just say something?’ John thinks this is ridiculous, his daughter doesn’t speak; she’s shown no interest in forming words, noises they’ve managed but not words.
‘No Sally calm down, I’m fine, just disorientated,  everyone else ok?’ his thoughts turn to his team, they’d lost two of their own yesterday evening, ‘People been checking in?’
Please notice the slight change in tags. PTSD (and all its associated fun) is going to come into force quite a bit in this chapter. If that's not something you can handle this chapter isn't for you. Leave a comment if you've had to skip it but want a summary and i'm more than happy to do that.
There’s no objection John can think of which does not sound petty and so he hands Mycroft his key as he braces himself to face the room he hasn't stayed in for months. He counts the stairs as he ascends them remembering the loose floorboard and the step which sits slightly out of sync with the others, meaning someone unsuspecting is liable to trip. John had used this to his advantage with a few dates ending up catching them and pulling them close, it had worked surprisingly well on the odd occasion dates decided to stick around after a Sherlock meeting.
She has been attempting to seduce me John and I am ashamed to say I have been allowing it to continue. Not ashamed because I feel it is a betrayal to you John or even a betrayal to my sexual identity, if such a thing is possible, it is more that with every flirtatious utterance and every well placed hand I hear your voice telling me that playing with this woman’s emotions is ‘a bit not good’ but John I see this to be the most expedient and painless way to gain access to the place I need to be and security systems I need to learn.
‘I apologise John, I was lost in thought. I should not have left you alone with my parents for so long.’ Mycroft seems embarrassed, especially when he moves to check his pocket watch, near enough fifty minutes have passed since John noticed Mycroft’s absence,
I MISS JOHN. I MISS MRS HUDSON. I MISS LESTRADE.
He hears Mrs Hudson’s voice trying to coax more words out of Mina, who laughs in return; she’d hidden her face in John’s neck then, hiding from the camera,
‘I’ve wanted to unwrap you from these suits more times than I’d care to admit,’ he hardly recognises the husky tone of his voice, he’s struggling to hold himself back from simply pouncing on the man, dragging the zipper of his trousers down with his teeth, using his hand, mouth, anything to bring the man in front of him to a wordless state of pleasure. He knows he shouldn’t, but at this moment, in this position it takes every morsel of his self control.
“It would be prudent, Francis will explain a little about the property and provide you with keys and the alarm code.”
The woman’s frustration was obvious. There weren’t many that would stand up under Anthea’s personal brand of questioning but Mycroft could have anticipated Mr Mitrović being one of them. Moriarty had been much the same; except instead of answering he had chanted Sherlock’s name, he had carved it into the walls and tables. Most memorable was the occasion he’d bitten into his own arm to use his own blood as ink for the walls. The hot smell of iron was what Mycroft remembered when he had entered the room the next day.
‘Oh John’ Mrs Hudson are the only words to fill the room for several minutes after John's exclamation,
‘This is John, little one although perhaps he will simply be Dad to you, and this place right here, this is home. I think you’re going to love it.’
Youngest daughter of an English Duke and his second wife. She is the favoured child; the jewellery she wears is exuberant for the wife of an unfaithful bank manager. Gifts from her father then.
“If the world knows about her existence you will expose her to all of them.”
“Would you like to speak in private or are you comfortable with John and Gregory being present?”
‘Well you entered the third house down having received the all clear and, from what I understand, you found a family of three, all young women, translator by your side, you approached them to offer aid and got hit over the head by the grandma neither of my highly trained officers, that’s you dickhead, noticed hiding behind the door,’ John closes his eyes as he groans, he remembers it vaguely, he’d taken his helmet off so he could make proper eye contact with the girls, they’d been very young and seemingly terrified, which John didn’t blame them for, of all the soldiers. He remembered having Abdul ask if any of them required help, he’d knelt to offer aid to the youngest at the front, he’d heard Abdul exclaim loudly from his right and he’d turned just before a sudden flash of pain on the top of his head had made him lose consciousness.  Sholto’s still laughing from his perch next to him, he’s dressed in the majority of his uniform, rank clearly shown, but everything about him screams off duty,
“Oh yes love, I’ve got everything sorted. Should we get the pushchair?”
‘Sir, are you even listening?’ Donovan clicks her fingers in front of her Greg’s face, he’s not had enough sleep the handle this level of annoyance so early in the morning, he never seems to sleep anymore and sleep is a luxury; a rare one at that.
Greg wasn’t sure quite why he put his in-car Bluetooth on when he started the car, or why the first thing he did was ring the private number he had spent the past twenty four hours memorising. It connected on the fourth ring and Greg’s car was filled with the silky tones of Mycroft’s greeting.
‘Actually John there was a purpose to my visit today. Seeing as we are discussing family it seems like an appropriate moment to mention it. My parents would like to arrange a meeting, one where they will have the opportunity to meet you and Mina as well as learn more about the decisions that are being made for her future?’ John lowers himself into the red chair framing the fireplace, he looks mildly concerned but Mycroft deduces the cause is most likely nerves,
Accepting the photograph John gives it a lingering glance before stating ‘Explain’,  perhaps his brother had left a mark on their friendship after all.
All of that before I went to university and none of it worked. There was no relief until I went to university, until I met Victor and he introduced me to the blissful serenity of cocaine. The floating disembodiment of a seven percent solution's high.
John’s perturbed,  Sherlock had never mentioned having to take a call and John never overheard him having long conversations over the phone with anyone although he supposed they were hardly together every minute of every day but it still surprises him that it never came up. He holds nothing against Sherlock, he never discussed his family in any great depth either, not that there would be much to talk about on his side. He tries to hold back the slither of jealousy he feels for the family Mycroft is describing, he had never known his father well, the old man left before John had a chance to know him properly and his mother, the less John thought about her the better, she was still alive and still someone John had to deal with from time to time, he couldn’t think of much he was dreading more than the necessity of informing her about Mina, except perhaps dealing with Harry.
‘A trigger, in this case a trauma trigger, is something that causes a flashback, a recollection of the original trauma. They can be any number of things, people, places, sounds, smells for some people taste also plays a serious part in the process but that’s less common. For Mina the majority seem to revolve around items or certain social situations. She seems to have a form of claustrophobia; she can’t be in enclosed spaces for long periods of time, she reacts badly to shouting, we discovered that with the television, she panicked when she saw someone smoking so I tend to believe it might be a trigger.’ Mycroft makes a mental note of the last one; it was something he hadn’t realised, yet another reason to attempt quitting again.
‘Forensics on scene now, back up is on route, sir I think it would be wise for you to seek medical assistance now, the scene is secure, officers have completed a second sweep,’
I hope I will make it back to London. I hope I will live.
‘What, no of course not, Mrs Hudson is here,’
The van he’s in stops not far from the dock, the cover of darkness should help mask their approach but there’s always the possibility of early discovery with these jobs, he addresses his team, they’re some of the best the Mets got.
‘Good afternoon Mycroft, I’m afraid Mina is asleep.’ While John moved off the floor Mycroft checked his watch,
Somewhere near his sleeping area a phone was ringing, that annoying Nokia tone, it repeated over and over again. John cracks his eyes slightly only to find them forced closed by the blinding light.
I had just hoped you would be there when I came home. But everything has changed hasn't it. I am dead to you and you have just moved on. I am alone and you are surrounded by love still. Do you even miss me at all?
John brought the tea and left one cup on the desk above Sherlock's head. He ran his fingers through Sherlock's curls. Sherlock leaned in to it and closed his eyes. They stayed that way for awhile. John sipped his tea and watched rain drops race together, neighbour against neighbour down the pane of glass until eventually the two drops merge and run to the edge of the frame.
“You don’t have to; none of us know what we’re doing. But John’s right, Sherlock deserves better and so does Mina. You want to give her the world, I know that, but right now what she needs is the opportunity to grow up in a world where both her fathers are heroes. Where she knows Sherlock didn’t leave because he had nothing to live for but rather he died because he loved others more deeply than himself.”
“Perhaps at the beginning, Mr Mitrović” Mycroft mirrored Mitrović’s sneer of disdain with one of his own.
“Alright, so let me first say that my marriage for the last few years has been somewhat…” Greg seemed to be struggling for the word so John filled in.
The sound of heavy footfalls on the stairs, coming down from the upstairs bedroom, bring John back into the present. There’s been no real sound since the two men had gone up to review what would become Mina’s bedroom; the realisation that this meant John’s would now be occupying Sherlock’s old room was something he repressed, how he would be able to exist in that space was beyond him. He’d failed to take it in earlier only stepping in to change his clothes before the social worker had descended and even those few moments of naked vulnerability in a room so inherently Sherlock had caused a deep routed ache in his stomach he couldn’t identify.
He could hear the other members of this room talking, their voices were raised but he wasn't paying close enough attention to catch their meaning.  Greg was so certain this child was Sherlock’s, but she just couldn’t be. It wasn’t that John didn’t believe Sherlock could have a child, of course if he had been so inclined he could have, people were always falling over themselves to get close to him, men and women offered themselves on silver platters all before he spoke a single word to them, they'd attended a party once John remembered, something thrown in their honor; a thank you from a wealthy and youth obsessed dowager they had saved from matricide, during the steady stream of guests and handshakes five phone numbers had been slipped into Sherlock's tuxedo jacket, John remembered feeling such jealousy at that but Sherlock had dismissed the entire evening,
Greg had never been that fond of how open his office is to the rest of the department; the glass walls left him feeling exposed. He had spent the first months after making D.I. moving filing cabinets to award himself some privacy.It became steadily more important as Sherlock started becoming a regular fixture on cases, there were only so many times he could put up with being called an idiot in front of his team before it became completely humiliating. More recently, when his work had become a distraction from his failing marriage and his wife's ever worsening excuses for infidelity, the glass walls of his office had meant every passing colleague had a front line view of his humiliation.With Sherlock's fall from grace and his subsequent suicide Greg had been forced to take a leave of absence, the idea of having to sit behind that desk with his personal grief on display to his whole division; a room of people who believed he had been deceived for so many years, that he'd been taken in by a fraud, disgusted him, almost as much as it filled him with dread. So when he'd returned to work and seen the head of Scotland Yard heading towards his, highly public, office he had been certain he was about to be fired, in the full view of his subordinates. Instead however he had been handed documents pertaining to a long term project; Project Poppy, something he could be passionate about, something that would help to start rebuilding his faded standing in the police force. He had thanked every deity he could think of for the opportunity to once again do some good for London. He would not be thanking them today however, today he was cursing the day he had seen his boss approaching his office, because today he was sitting across from one of the best men he had ever known and trying to explain the impossible.
‘I just wish there was more we could do.’
He had been to hell and back through the night, reports of a casualty and than a fatality coming out of Gregory’s raid on the Russian mobster referred to as many things but most notably to his team as Mr. Red, it was an aliases ,his real name was a common Russian name and the man had left it behind as he climbed the ranks of one of Russia’s most dangerous mobster families, he’d been in charge of a branch of Moriarty’s web, Mycroft had lost track of him somewhere in Bulgaria two months ago but his prints had alerted his team once they were scanned at New Scotland Yard. He had thought the worst, he had felt his heart break at the idea of losing another person he loved, and he did love this man, if he had not known it before, the pure relief that had nearly bought him to his knees when Anthea had called through that Gregory was not injured Would have been proof enough.
“This other man, I think I recognise him,” Greg said.
‘No I can’t think of anything thank you Mycroft, tell your parents I look forward to meeting them.’
‘I guess not. I mean, if you’re happy, then I’m happy for you.’
A scream wrenches through the near silent warehouse, the officers still present look up in panic, it’s a woman’s voice, seeming to come from the office.
“It’s just… I did notice that the money from the opiates was a lot higher than usual.”
I hope my home is still there and that I will still be welcome within it when I finally make it back to London.
“It scared me, today, he said her name and I lost control,” Mycroft confessed quietly. John left it to Greg to comfort him, he wasn’t even certain he was supposed to have heard. He focused on Mrs. Hudson instead, refilling her glass and taking her hand. She smiled at him timidly both of them ignoring what was quickly becoming an embrace.
‘Any news from the surgery?’
“From Moran to name but one, Sherlock had enemies and so do I.”
‘What would reassure you Vi? Mina has a doctor for a father, not to mention an uncle whose influence could get her pushed to the head of any waiting list; I think we have fallen into focussing too much on the negative darling. We promised we would try not to do that remember?’ John had released her hands so Siger could hold them once more.
‘Abdul alright?’
“I’ve never met any of them.”
T.W. Discussions of Mina related issues
“Never knowingly.”
‘I couldn’t save him though, he’s dead and he’s gone’
"Of what?"
‘I know some, Mycroft likes to buy Mina things involving star systems and, well, when I was in Afghanistan the night sky was beautiful, industrialisation is much lower over there you understand, their skies are free of light pollution and you can make out the constellations clearly. They have different names for some of them though, my team, we had a translator, a local, to make communication with the villagers easier. He taught me some of them,’ he can see the other man smiling broadly,
Mycroft closed the file in front of him, letting Mitrović take the lead and spreading his arms to indicate he was ready for the man to begin his tale.
TORTURE.
He follows his instincts as he starts treating her, apply pressure to wound, keep her talking, one of the other officers has called for an ambulance response team, he can hear the sirens now, the screech of tires, he just keeps her talking, she wasn’t alone in this room, he remembers this now, he keeps talking but looks up, he sees P.C. Flowers head on the other side of the desk, another officer is applying first aid but he’s not responsive. Sammy’s crying under him,she’s such a strong woman, the paramedics are there, they have him move aside but he stays by her head talking, he’s not sure what he’s saying but he hopes it’s comforting, she keeps whispering apologies to him, all he can do is reassure her it isn’t necessary. The second team of paramedics are by P.C. Summers attempting resuscitation, he’s still not responding.  The paramedics move Sammy, he’s not supposed to follow, he has to secure the scene, he looks around the room in a daze, he sees a cabinet by Summers body, the door has been flung open, it’s a thin cabinet but Summers should have checked it before the clear was called, how could they have missed it, he sees him being carried off now, one of the paramedics is shaking his head and Greg knows the man is dead.
“What bloody good is that? We had a case against him; my team have been working constantly to get ready for trial. You lot can’t just swoop in and take over. He killed two police officers; two of mine. How would Mycroft feel if one of his team died and he could do nothing but watch the perpetrator swan off to Russia?”
‘Dr Watson?’
‘God is it? Sorry Dan I’m not with it today’ the younger man smiles before dashing off the collect his belongings, he thinks it’s possible the young man rather fancies Sally. The age difference doesn’t bother him but the idea of yet more drama integrating itself within his team fills him with dread. Maybe he can introduce the young man to some of the women on the fraud prevention team, they’re lovely, friendly and approachable and they’re also a completely different division on a completely different floor of the building.
“So did you ask about the opiates?” Greg asked this time. He had moved forward, Mina now silently sleeping against his chest, her face turned into his neck, her fist closed around his shirt collar.
‘Well no dear, no one’s been living here have they, the milk from earlier was mine, I don’t think you’ve even got tea here anymore.’
“Yes I’m afraid so. Poor manners are not the worst of his crimes, although I quite agree they are distasteful.”
‘Do you mean you cannot be certain?’
“Nope, because it gets better, Greg, because I didn’t say anything, not because I didn’t know how I felt. I bloody knew alright. I knew I loved him, but I repressed it because I was ashamed of being bisexual. I was ashamed because my wanker of a dad was a homophobe and my mother was no better and I had to watch my sister go through that shit and come out the other side a mess of an alcoholic.”
‘I have waited for longer than I would care to admit to touch you like this,’ Mycroft’s voice is soft as he moves slightly to stroke through the short strands that curve around the shell of his ear. Greg feels a slight shiver move down his spine as he slips to his knees and runs the palm of his hand across Mycroft’s thigh, the younger mans legs part slightly to allow Greg closer access, he moves his hand up, caressing the man’s hips and the side of his ribs before stroking down the firm chest in front of him,
But now the man stood in front of him, the height different more pronounced than normal as the detective inspector was without his shoes.
‘Tall Latte, double shot, single hit of hazelnut, half fat, foam, no chocolate’
“I’m afraid you’re not.”
‘You need to pick a bedroom, a name and then you need to accept your impending fatherhood’ John laughs at that, Mycroft is being entirely honest, but he can sense the edge of panic in the man’s tone.
John watches Mycroft and Mina interact, Mycroft’s dual nature confuses the hell out of him, Sherlock once described him as the most dangerous man in the country and yet here he was sitting in Sherlock’s leather chair allowing his niece to play with a pocket watch John is certain would be worth more than any other item in the room and yet he doesn’t flinch when Mina starts trying to chew it, merely smiles and tucks a loose curl behind her ear.
‘There is nothing wrong with projecting a perfect self image Mycroft; you only get one chance to make a first impression. You must always use it wisely.’
‘That sounds awful Greg, how’s work reacted? You’re not in any trouble are you?’ John was already thinking of which favours he'd have to call on Mycroft with in order to straighten out this mess, although remembering the furtive glances the two had been sending each other the last time they'd been together perhaps he'd need do no more than inform Mycroft of the problem.
I MISS LONDON.
“No, he wouldn’t answer any questions put to him in any of the languages we know he speaks.”
He’s not sure how he ends up in the uncomfortable plastic chair, there’s a nurse waving a small light in his face and he’s been covered in some heavy knit blanket, they check his vitals while he tries to demand updates on his team, Sally returns with a cup of tea and news, the scene had been secured and handed over to the back up team, forensics were now on site, Franklin and the other officer on her team who were injured only experienced minor sprains and a broken wrist. They were already on route back to the station for debriefing, Greg wonders If he’s supposed to do it but before he can open his mouth Sally is informing him that the Superintendent is handling debriefing and that Greg is likely to placed on sick leave until they get him a Psych evaluation.  He doesn’t want that, he’s about to object but Sally shakes her head at him, if he makes a fuss Devin and Sally will have no choice but to inform those higher up of his near attack on the perpetrator.
Two officers were struck down in a raid gone wrong Thursday evening. Project Poppy, the brain child of Chief Inspector Samuel Author, has been in operation for a number of months. Casualties have been few amongst the police carrying out the operations but in the early hours of Thursday morning their collective luck ran out. Two officers were confirmed dead at the scene with a number of others were in need of urgent hospital attention.
“How exactly…”
“Mr Mitrović, you’re wasting my time, I already know about your boss’ obsession and about my brother’s descent into heroism, if you can’t be interesting I’m sure Interpol will have more to say to you than I do.”
I have been plagued by migraines since my teens. We never discussed it and you never saw the worst of them John, I apologise for hiding them from you but I hate the idea of you feeling guilt for not being able to cure me of the dreadful things.
Mycroft threw Mitrović a smirk expecting it to enrage the man further. Mycroft was waiting for the snap, the breakdown of the man’s higher functions and the release of the violent bloodlust he knew lay within. But it did not materialize. Rather, the man slumped backwards into the chair, his rigid posture uncoiling as he did so.
There's a bad guy.
John tilted his head. "What does it sound like then?"
Thank you so much to my beautiful Beta Ruby. I could find you a million cat Gif's and it would never be enough *air kisses*
‘There were three books when I found them but I can’t seem to find the other, but these were the ones I had a quick look through and thought you might like.’ Mycroft flicks the front cover open, knowing he’ll find a chronological look of Sherlock’s life, sure enough pictures of his brother from before he was Mina’s age stare back at him through the album, the first chronicles a large portion of his life, his mother was highly selective in the pictures she included knowing Sherlock would not accept too many from his more photograph friendly younger years, the older he became the more he ran when Violet Holmes revealed her camera. It did not surprise him that the second album had photographs missing between full pages, most likely the ones that had been contained in those pages featured people Sherlock wanted to delete. He imagined Victor and Sebastian had been removed from the University examples.
Brother
‘I was just saying that your police officer friend Greg has been coming over to see you dear’ Mycroft starts to feel awkward when everyone in the room is doing something while he stands leaning against a counter, he looks around for something constructive to do and spots a washing basket on one of the chairs on the opposite side. He may never have folded laundry before but how hard could it honestly be, he was the owner of two bachelor degrees, two masters and one doctorate, domestic chores should hold no challenge when placed against those achievements.
“What’s up, Greg?” John asked.
John shifted a shoulder in a vague shrugging motion.
'Eliminate the impossible and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,'
Enjoy
“Well Sebastian wasn’t a runner or anything; he didn’t technically work for Frank. He came over with a load of uncut product the year before Frank went to jail. He had propositions for Frank about expanding outside of Florida. I never liked him, Mycroft, I don’t mind telling you. He had a rather nasty habit of rubbing cocaine into his gums. They’d bleed something awful and he’d just spit that blood anywhere he liked.”
‘You cannot do that to me again, please Gregory, never again.’
"Forever Sherlock, I'm not going anywhere." John held out his hand to help Sherlock up. Sherlock looked at it. Looked at the rain. Then looked back and took John's hand.
‘Definitely cool, I’m a little worried I’m going to be forcing my tastes on her but who can say no to a cuddly set of the Star Trek characters.’
‘Not to fret Mrs Hudson,  it would appear Mycroft has it all underway’ the words of the Detective Inspector would have bought a smile to his face, if he had not currently been observing John Watson going into shock. This would never do.
“The man gave up his life to keep the people he cared about safe and all Mina’s going to hear about him from anyone that isn’t the four of us is that he was a coward and a fraud. How is that right, Mycroft? That can’t be what lasts about him, it can’t.” John’s voice broke on the last; his grief pushing up through his chest, his heart racing and a hatred so dark it scared even him roared for justice against the monster that had taken Sherlock from them. That had taken Sherlock before he had a chance to realise…to believe how much he truly loved him.
‘Mr. Ambassador if you could refrain from speaking nonsense for five minutes I would appreciate it. Let me first reiterate that you have disgraced the position awarded to you by Her Majesty the Queen and as such it would be wise to refrain from insulting any more of her employees, would you not agree?’ Silence had greeted his declaration until an unexpectedly clear voice spoke from the other side;
John couldn't stop himself from giggling, the idea of Sherlock being outraged by being named after an aunt provided him with more joy then he’d experienced in months, he’d imagined sitting and discussing Sherlock with people who knew him would be painful but in reality the pain, although present, was lacking its sharpness thanks to the company he was keeping.
‘From Mycroft, lord no, it was star’ Siger grins at the memory, ‘it was summer and Violet, she developed this habit of bundling Mycroft out of bed when he woke up the second time, always at one A.M. and taking him out onto the balcony attached to our room. She’d sing him the names of the constellations in French. I think she was slightly disappointed you went for the English Myc, would have profferedétoile, all things considered.’ ‘My second word was French; I imagine it pacified her somewhat.’ Siger bobs his head in response. ‘Now his lordship, Sherlock, he caused some mischief. Didn’t speak in front of anyone until he was two, we would hear him sometimes talking to his bear or his puppy but whenever we would try, nothing. His first word to us, unsurprisingly, was no.’ It’s John’s turn to snort now, it’s so Sherlock he can hardly stand it,
*Goes in search of ice cream*
‘How’d I manage that sir?’ Sholto chuckles, his smile suggests a story John will find humiliating for years to come is to follow,
BOUGHT A GUN.
“Inside” Sherlock growls and slips a hand holding the golden key for the door past John and into the lock but the moment is already broken and John knows it.
“We’re not one hundred percent certain of that yet but my team have been working for some time of suspected links between drug cartels in the United States and Eastern Europe. I wonder if you might remember any of his colleagues, in particular this man.” Mycroft pointed to the man on the left hand side of the photograph. “Did you know him?”
Also vague trigger warnings: Discussions of issues relating to recovery from trauma, If you've read to this point you know Mina's been through some terrible things but there's a little more detail here. Please look after yourselves and read safe. MJ x
You just love sex don't you? You always have. I could always tell John. Do you really think I didn't know you masterbated in the shower most mornings. Perhaps it will come as news to you that you are not a quiet man, especially when you come. You grunt and you muffle your shouts but I can still tell.
‘I did, I didn’t understand as much as you did though. How do we help her, she should know not to be scared here.’
‘Are you competitive sir?’
“He wouldn’t, you’re right, it never made sense.”
Greg spotted Francis walking slightly further back and stopped momentarily. Waiting for him to catch up, he crouched down to mimic refastening his shoe lace. When he saw the two polished shoe covered feet stop just in his line of sight he turned his head to mutter quietly, “Do we know who he is?”
I am ever thine John
They’ve relocated to the chairs in front of the fire and at some point John realises someone’s made tea, he’s relatively certain it wasn’t him because he’s not been able to take his eyes off the little girl currently in between them, she’s sitting independently but he’s been certain to surround her with cushions. Lisa insists it’s not necessary;
‘You are most welcome Gregory, perhaps next time you call there will be no crisis and I would like to hear from you without something dire having occurred.’
There's some torture.
“Not to our knowledge; the information we’ve intercepted indicate he has set out to collect pictures of you; enjoying yourself while the nation mourns or some such rubbish.”
‘She has no reason to know that, preferable scenario she’s shocked to have left everyone she knows behind and she’s adapting. Worst she’s been traumatised by the actions of the bastards Greg saved her from and if that’s the case we’re going to help her heal and then so help me we’re going to shoot every one of those dicks in the head.’ Mycroft not commenting on the aggression or the tears running down John’s face struck John both as compassionate but also an agreement. If they needed too, the two men would defend their family.
‘Oh come of you loved it, you didn’t see your face, come on at least finish A Study in Pink, after that’s done it’s up to you but that one, come on, please,’ she clasped his arm tight enough that it might leave bruises,
“So these coffees, they weren’t dates?”
‘Indeed I do Detective Inspector but first' he turns to the only woman in the room 'Mrs Hudson, in approximately two hours a good many men will be arriving to remove certain items and place them in storage, it will be up to  Doctor Watson to decide which bedroom he will now occupy, however there will need to be room made for the arrival of bedroom items appropriate for a young child.’ Mrs Hudson’s gasp as she rounded on John seemed to pull him out whatever deep thoughts he'd been lost in.
“I know, you’re not alone in that, we all loved him Myc. No one is going to get to any of us. Trust us just like we trust you.”
But it's all about the wife John.
‘Did you know a honey bee had five eyes and can see ultra violet light?’ John can’t see the owner of the voice but its female,
Some of you may have noticed the chapter's been separated again, this entire section is a complete beast.  But the completed chapter would have been 8000 words and even for me that's a bit much.  So the next chapter is done and being proof read. It will be up tomorrow evening. MJ X
“Sherlock,” John whimpers because he doesn’t have the energy to face the questions right now. An edge of the booze is wearing off and he’s starting to feel the first flushes of embarrassment at his behaviour this evening. Not to mention his cheek hurts. His cheek fucking throbs in fact. But Sherlock doesn’t answer. John feels him move closer and then stop again. He hears the man’s breathing turn into something ragged and he feels a hand stroke through the short hair at the back of his neck where the skin is exposed to the elements and small drops of dew like rain have been caught on the silvery blonde strands.
“I was thinking, perhaps, if you would like, rather than a hotel you are welcome to be a guest at the house the family holds in Mayfair. You would be within walking distance of work and the property is extensive.”
‘Sure, yeah I can do Sam’s for lunch, when are we leaving?’
‘Hi Mycroft’
Greg followed his instructions turning onto a street framed by large and opulent properties that towered over his slightly beaten up Ford. He pulled to a stop behind a black SUV and waved to the man that exited the vehicle.
“So there are four, why four?”
But that’s not you is it John? She could be your idealised image of a partner, she could welcome you into her life and home yet she will never be enough for you.
“We caught him eventually, brought him down,” Mycroft said, his tone biting.
‘Yes, I’m alright, it’s just, something weird happened and I didn’t know what to do and for some reason I thought of you.’
‘Yeah, I know, I should get into the office at some point. What’s even happening?’
“His name is Petrovski and he was an assassin; he operated in Norway for the majority of his career before moving to London weeks before Sherlock’s death. You know him Mrs. Hudson because on the day of Sherlock’s death he was in Baker Street posing as a handy man.”
He gently placed Mina, who was still sleeping solidly, into the pushchair they’d brought in from the car. She curled slightly so she was twisting away from the fireplace but slept on while Greg turned toward the other two men.
Mitrović spun a tale before Mycroft’s eyes detailing the meteoric rise of an academic man’s son, Mycroft thought for a moment that the man was detailing Mycroft’s own life but the details were off; his family had never lived in Ireland. Mitrović continued weaving; his words lulling Mycroft slightly until he leant, forward his elbows braced on the table.
‘That is precisely what I am doing and precisely what you will be doing.’
‘Oh well I thought we could invite your nice detective friend, Mr Lestrade. He could drive us and honestly I thought he could use a nice day out after everything he’s been through recently.’
‘To be honest most of these toys are for slightly older children, the board games are a bit more advanced but there are cool costumes she might like for fancy dress and our Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings sections do have some toddler options,’ John moves to the sections she indicates ‘We have soft doll ranges to make them more appropriate for younger children, let me just’ she dives under the table in the middle of the room part way through her section but John feels he’s starting to get used to this brand of conversation, it’s not so different from when Sherlock would jump into the middle of an explanation without providing any context, he’d learnt coping mechanisms, ‘Ah ha!’ Her arms are full when she reappears, the already messy ponytail now looks more like the top of a pineapple than anything else and John barely stops himself from laughing. She tips her offering onto the only section of the table not covered in bobble heads and holds up a cuddly Spok toy, ‘Isn’t he so cool’
“Sir, with all due respect Mr. Holmes…”
“Yes, that’s Sebastian. Awful man, very rude, he once broke one of my teapots over a poor man’s head. I mean honestly it was such a waste.”
For three hours he filled out reports, followed up on interviews, spoke to his superiors about potential deals for lower criminals to provide evidence against the high rollers in the organisation. This was his job, moves and countermoves, he didn’t dislike days such as this where he was behind a desk completing the reports necessary for convictions, it was how their justice system worked and he was damn good at working with the system,  what he did dislike however was how data entry provided time for your mind to wander. His night had been filled with dreams that haunted him into the day time, memories of cases he’d never solved, children he’d never saved and one of his closest friends jumping to his death, but his nightmares were not alone in causing his insomnia.
“Darling Gregory, I would be your guide any day. Perhaps you would enjoy taking my direction?” Mycroft asked with a tone of faux innocence. The hint of laughter was still present in his voice and Greg liked to picture him grinning down the other end of the phone.
Italics = a recollection
He turns to see the other two important women in his life, Tammy is crying softly on Mrs Hudson’s shoulder but they’re both smiling broadly. He kisses his daughters hair as he thinks about how lucky he is, this morning he’d felt like he was losing his mind to his past but now, holding his daughter in his arms he’s never felt more blessed, every day with her pushes the ghosts of his past a little further away,
It was so clearly rehearsed that John felt the need to check for a prompter,
I am nervous about my next move John. I am uncertain about the decisions I have made and the plan I have already started to enact. I have befriended the wife of my enemy in order to gain access to his home and remove him from this volatile equation.
‘What triggers? I don’t understand’
I do truly hate you sometimes John. You have made me feel so much and very little of it would I ever thank you for. Jealousy for example is a useless emotion. It brings nothing but pain and yet I am unable to delete it. To delete the pressure of it in my head and the feel of it in my gut.
John nods his assent and moves to fetch his diary, he’s taken a leave of absence from work and hasn’t started to consider going back to it yet, he knows he can no longer work full time and the state his finances must be in has started to pray on his mind and yet there’s been no angry notes from credit card companies demanding payment, so far nothing but he knows he will need to return to work eventually which will mean finding childcare for Mina for at least three days a week, he doesn’t know where to start with that, she doesn’t like strangers and is very selective about who she’ll interact with. The doctor he’s seen for her weight check up expressed concern at her still not attempting to speak but since then she had become more vocal with noises, John would occasionally come across her humming a tune to her toys while she played and they’d been working successfully on animal sounds since it became apparent she loved the horse and animal toys to such a degree.
“That’s so natural Mycroft; you love her so much. We all know that,” Greg said, brushing his hand down Mycroft’s side to grip his hip. He sidled in close to the other man’s back and held him, let the warmth of his body quieten the tremors in Mycroft’s body; leant him his strength as he needed it.
“So, you know after Sherlock, I just ended up doing some thinking about what made me happy and what didn’t and how I should be happy, you know,” Greg carried on; waving his arms in a display John was sure had many passersby looking for the aeroplane the fool was trying to guide in.
I intend to avoid such actions John but I have not ruled it out of the possible progression this evening will have to take. My experiences of heterosexual sex have all taken place while I was under the influence of one drug or another.
‘Yes she is Doctor Watson, I’ve bought you her files, I think it was mentioned you’d want to look over everything we have about her. I understood you chose a name, we’ll edit our files accordingly.’
I also adore my beautiful beta Ruby who constantly works to keep me sane and as grammatically correct as possible considering it's me. You're my rock & superstar and seriously so much love to you.
Anthea looked at him quickly, raising a clearly unimpressed eyebrow in his direction.
“We spy on most people John, and most people spy on us. Countries and governments don’t honestly trust each other.”
‘Right you are Greg, take care of you. And bloody text me when you know where you are okay? I worry.’
“I think it might have been one of the raids we did at the beginning of Poppy, you know. Some of the thugs put up more of a fight when we went in to close down production. This one was holding on to one of the girls with a broken bottle. Sally took him down.”
John let Greg digest what was apparently a surprising reaction and contented himself with looking over what part of the grounds he could still see.  This far out from the city a scattering of stars were visible.
Your loyal companionship means more to me than I know how to express, thank you for your care and patience. Happy Valentine's Day My John Watson.
‘I apologise for leaving you alone Gregory, I just finished on the phone with the Prime Minister, he sends his condolences for your teams loss but praised all your actions as exemplary police work’ Greg doesn’t miss the slight sneer in his voice when he says the word exemplary. He feels his defences rise, he won’t have anyone bad mouthing his team, no matter how important that person may be to him, he’s about to state outright that his team IS exemplary when Mycroft continues, ‘the man wouldn’t be able to be sincere if it was his own family grieving, your team succeeded in bringing down a criminal group responsible for numerous global atrocities Gregory, don't mistake me we’re discussing mass rape, killings, drug trafficking, people trafficking, child enslavement at this point and all the man has to say is, he’s sorry for your loss but good job on sorting out my mess. The woman was in her twenties and her life was forfeit because the bastard refuses to let me do my job! He interfered with my investigation because he thought I was too close to the edge after Sherlock and now, because of his stupidity, a young girl is dead.’ Mycroft’s breathing heavily now, one hand pressed against the glass of the window as he leans his head down. Greg can hear the guilt in his tone that would match his own, he doesn’t see how a moment of this is Mycroft’s fault but he also doesn’t understand what he’s talking about, the group they were after were big, yes, but there had been no indication of anything bigger than London, nothing indicating what Mycroft is talking about.
‘Seriously!’
“Oh come on John, you never talk about him. I dunno I didn’t want you to feel like you had to because it led you into it. I swear I didn’t mean to.”
Mina let out a cry of distress from her car seat at Greg’s outburst but stayed mercifully asleep. John slapped him hard on the shoulder, the last thing any of them needed right now was a screaming infant and with the sheer amount of tension in the car Mina was sure to react. Greg raised his hand to acknowledge his mistake but kept his phone glued to his ear, clearly listening to Sally on the other end explain some form of fuck up.
‘Indeed,’ Mycroft moves to speak to Mina who’s moved herself to standing in front of her horse, ‘Goodbye Mina, be good.’ He kisses her head while she pats him on the cheek. John takes it as a sign of affection and from the small smile on Mycroft’s face he does the same. He watches from near the table while Mycroft descends the stairs,
The most ridiculous thing was John only owned three ties. He owned three plain, very workable ties, any of which would go with the plain white shirt he was wearing and yet here he stood, in front of Mycroft’s front door, obsessing about the colour of his tie. Light blue with a silver thread, Mrs Hudson had told him it brought out the colour of his eyes, It was too late to change it in any case, he was already here and leaving to change ones tie would most likely not give a positive impression to the people he was desperate to impress.
They’d made Johns stomach twist when he’d come across them in the corner store or walked past someone reading them. Having his face continued to be plastered on the gossip pages of the national press brought him nothing but pity and as his sister had enjoyed reminding him;
“Denise, I need you to come in here. We need to have a conversation and it needs to be now.” Greg was done waiting for this nightmare to be over, he wanted to be allowed to find and bask in the happiness and love of his friends and family and potentially the excitement of a new love.  Greg strained to hear the words his wife was muttering as she trudged back down the three stairs she had alighted between her entrance and Greg’s words.
I am an irresponsible man. I always have been. I am reckless with both my transport and increasingly my mind.  I have done things over this past four months John that would disgust you. The memories keep me from sleep even when my body requires it, even when all I want in the world is to lose myself in unconsciousness the recollections of my actions haunt me.
“Yeah, sorry Greg. I got lost in my own head there. What was the question?”
‘Yes, Mycroft told me, I’m sure we can organise something. I just wanted the chance to meet you first, maybe answer your questions. I don’t like to talk about certain topics in front of her.’
‘You know John it strikes me that we’ve all been quite focused on making her happy now rather than dealing with the negative ramifications left over from her early life experiences.’ John felt himself bristle with anger, did Mycroft honestly think he didn’t remember everyday exactly what he’d read in that folder, he’d seen for himself some of the marks her early years in those monsters care had given her and he had to squash the violent reaction he had to the knowledge of their existence every time she screamed for him in the night.
‘John I…’ Greg sat behind his desk feeling that desperate desire to apologise that he had allowed to fill him in the first weeks following Sherlock's suicide. He had drowned the feelings in bottles of scotch and explosive arguments with his wife. But he had tried so many times in those first days John had been catatonic; initially sedated in the hospital, he had sequestered himself in Baker Street alone until the funeral,Greg had tried knocking on the door once only to find himself being shoved from the front stoop by a surprisingly strong Mrs Hudson.
‘No more morning disaster zones for us little love,’ Mina had been quiet for the shopping expedition but once in the open air and London drizzle she started a stream of noises, exclaiming and pointing at anything she considered note worthy John tried to keep up. Three stores later and the only thing left to buy were toys, this was something John knew little about; but one look in the girls section of the toy superstore in front of them was enough to make him realise it wasn’t the place for him, why did everything need to be divided by gender and then why did the girls toys all need to be covered in glitter. What did a baby need with that much glitter!
‘Of course she was upset John, She is whenever you leave but you both have to get used to it. She’s perfectly fine just tiered, I’ll tell you what I’ll check on her in thirty minutes and check her forehead, if she feels even a little hot I’ll call, but until then shouldn’t you be socialising. I hope you’re making a good impression John Watson.’
‘We’re on silent approach sir, air support is showing little movement on the surrounding roads but we’re keeping the helicopter high to avoid detection. I’ll radio when we’re in position, Devin out.’
“Looks like she’s falling asleep, do you want me to find the pushchair?” Greg asked as he peered down at Mina where she was snuggling more deeply into the thick material of John’s winter coat and scarf.
Greg put as much depth into his voice as possible, his next statement coming up as more of a growl than anything, “You haven’t seen my skills yet Myc, you’ll know when you do.”
The doorbell ringing shocked them both, Mina turning to stare at him with wide eyes while they listened to Mrs Hudson bustle to the door downstairs. ‘Well little lady that will probably be for us, shall we go see?’ instead of moving to pick her up he took two steps and opened his arms, Mina considered him and then the distance between them, she took a step before faltering and ending up sat next to her bear, ‘Come on Mina you can come over here’ he knelt on the carpet with his arms stretched towards her.
No one was speaking, the car moved through London smoothly but John couldn’t tell which direction they were heading in, his attention span was limited with his thoughts continuing to return to the face of the little girl . When the car stopped he moved before thinking, opening the door onto a road he knew, he spun to observe the black door of 221b Baker Street and couldn’t quite bring himself to move. He hadn’t been back here in three months and had thought never to again. Why were they here?
John heard it but he wasn’t listening, he was remembering his dream and the words his phantom version of Sherlock had whispered in his ear;
John raised an eyebrow. He had control of the sarcastic single eyebrow raise down, thank you very much.
Chapter warnings: sex and jealousy.
Yours in all things,
The Sherlock voice that lived in the back of his mind, existed like an itch you just couldn’t reach, spoke up now, he did his best to ignore it during his everyday life but god did he miss the rush of a mystery, no matter how small this one was,
‘John please, I just, just for now will you allow me this, this precaution will cost you nothing and you won’t be aware of it. Keeping her safe is all I want.’ John knew he couldn’t say no, he also knew that saying no wouldn’t stop Mycroft Holmes, better to agree so he was at least aware of who was watching them.
John moved further into the structure, his newly acquired guide occasionally stopping him to smell a specific example, explaining in detail about the treatments and care provisions required for each. John exclaims once at the supposed worth of one of the rarer examples causing his guide to chuckle lightly,
He unwraps it and finds a beautiful leather bound journal stamped with his initials in gold. John sits for a while and stares at the book before giving up trying to discover it's meaning and opening the note from Mycroft.
“It wasn’t suicide Mrs. Hudson. Was it, Mycroft?”
“Alright, what do you do?”
‘Holy Sh..’ he realises at the last minute that Mina is still In his arms chewing the ear of the cuddly Ewok and not caring in the slightest that John thinks he might just have walked into his teenage self’s version of nirvana. When he was growing up it was Harry who had filled the house with rock music, head banging with her friends until their mother would scream, she’d been the rebel with piercings, tattoos, late night parties and one very memorable excursion with acid which had put John off recreational drugs for life, he on the other hand had lost himself in worlds of science fiction and fantasy until fourteen when he’d also discovered a love for rugby. He’d lost himself in worlds of heroes and absolute truths when the reality of home had gotten so ugly, his mother and Harry so similar it could be volatile he’d had to play peacekeeper on more occasions than he cared to remember, but stood here surrounded by Star Trek and Star Wars play sets, board games from the Princess Bride, Labyrinth and Cowboys Vs Indians he’s reminded of the heroes and escapes of his youth. He found solitude and peace in these stories.
Radio silence
‘Maybe not,’ there’s silence again, ‘why did you call me Gregory?’ he’s glad to be addressed by his first name again,
“Did he know about her? We’re not sure yet, Mina’s existence has been kept quiet for numerous reasons. There is a potential criminal link that we are investigating,” Mycroft indicated the folder and loose pictures, “The drug den Mina was found in has links to the mob Mitrović belonged to and as such is also linked to Moran.”
“I miss him.”
“Not to our knowledge, all communication so far has concerned you and on one occasion Doctor Watson. There’s little interest in the child at this moment.”
“John, take a look at this picture and tell me if you recognise any of the men.”
“Are we prisoners?” John asked, panic having taken a firm hold in his chest now. Beside him Mrs. Hudson was visibly shaken and maintaining her grip on Mina who slept on despite the noise.
Mina snuffled slightly in her sleep, burrowing closer to John until her face was obscured entirely from view; she still slept best when she fell asleep like this. Something about the closeness seemed to sooth that part of her John knew still worried he would disappear and she would be left alone again. He saw it every time he collected her from a stay at Mrs Hudson’s and felt it every time she clung to his jumper or hand when they went to the kid’s club at the White Rabbit. She was growing steadily more confident around others, in particular other children; she hadn’t hesitated before reclaiming a snatched toy from a boy at least six months her senior. Granted, John would have preferred she do so without smacking the child on the head with said toy in retaliation and her chanting “no” repeatedly, but progress was always something to be celebrated.
Dear John
‘Do you have any plans today John?’
Mycroft’s eyes sparkled with humour when Greg moved in to kiss him lightly. It was fast and chaste, aware as he was that they still had an audience.
“Seriously Greg, I make a confession and you make a joke.”
He started up the stairs, they would simply have to be a group of four and Mycroft would deal with the results of their discussion later. All would be well if Mrs Hudson agreed but there was of course the possibility she would find the whole business of child rearing distasteful. She had never had children herself and perhaps the reason was because she was not fond of them, removing a set of keys from his pocket he swept his way into a room that had once been the centre of his brothers home.
Mycroft repressed the rage he felt burning within him., Breaking the man’s nose would be considered a bad move in many people’s books.
‘Don’t worry you’re merely educating her in proper entertainment from a young age’ Tammy offers Mina the cuddly Spok, Mina considers him while chewing the ear of the Ewok, that they’re now going to have to buy, letting go of her death grip on John’s jumper she reaches with her other arm bringing Spok close to her other side, she doesn’t relinquish the Ewok but ponders her new toy steadily, John wonders if the attention is being paid to the fact the squat toy looks vaguely human or the frankly huge pointed ears which adorn the sides of its head.
John said it quietly, he knew Mycroft would recognise it, Sherlock had said that constantly, muttered it under his breath so often it became a mantra to John, whenever their world became too much, this was what he took comfort it.He took the remaining steps to the door, no one stopped him, he walked to the elevator, no one stopped him,  he stood waiting when Greg came out of his office, leaving the door open for the remaining inhabitant he shrugged his jacket on and made the straighten his tie. In John’s opinion it meant nothing but John knew Greg had long since stopped caring for that.
I feel like I should apologise in advance here, ahead lies heavy angst. Graphic descriptions of violence, shock, a little gore, more angst and generally it's pretty depressing.
“Are you going to tell me?” Greg watched Francis, obviously uncomfortable with Greg’s gruff questioning. He didn’t like letting John and Mina out of his sight but they were currently being flanked by people he could only assume were government trained. “I can ask Mr. Holmes if it will make your life easier.”
“How about anything else?”
“Prince,” Mina said, her voice muffled against John’s chest and stifled by her own yawn.
Sally makes a sarcastic noise of disgust ‘You think the instant drivel we have here is going to help? If you need coffee you best send someone on a run’
‘Well the estimate was made by the paramedics and doctors who’ve been treating her. To be honest with you I know very little about children myself. She does look a bit old to be called a baby though.’
“But I’m still married.”
“Did Mr. Hudson specialise in opiates?”
John laughs in response, considering how stressed all of them seem to be with Mina it would be a miracle if meeting her calmed Mrs Holmes any. ‘Well I guess we’ll have to wait and see.’
He had been unable to answer her enquiries in the detail she’d apparently desired leading to a heated argument which had ended with his mother threatening to move to London so she could conduct her own surveillance as his was clearly failing her, his father had done a great deal of the mollifying on that occasion and she seemed to have calmed a great deal once Mycroft had sent them an email with a small portion of video footage John had sent him; the clip had shown Mina riding her rocking horse, a small piece of Holmes heritage Mycroft had provided his beloved niece, the fact she’d taken to the imitation animal so thoroughly had provided him with a great deal of pleasure, Sherlock had always loved horses, along with Redbeard  and thoroughbred Toby had been the closest he had come to friends until he had made the change to university. Memories of watching his brother compete had flashed through his head while watching his niece play with the gift. No matter John’s objections he was determined to provide her with all the lessons she desired when the time came.
COCAINE.
Mycroft stood for a moment looking over each of them before glancing down at Mina.
‘One officer fatality and one gravely wounded’ this report is unnecessary but there’s a procedure that needs to be followed,
“It’s not justice Mycroft, not by a long shot.”
“No we could have done it together.” Mycroft stood pulling his suit jacket down before facing John.
“Oh fuck off, is that what you focused on? What about the rest of it? Come on man I’m all at sea with this.”
“Yeah.”
“Yes, from the American government. They had been watching your husband closely. When Sherlock arrived Agent Walters got put underground so Sherlock wouldn’t uncover their operation. My brother had a tendency to overlook the potential damage destroying an undercover persona might cause.”
“He would only have left me if he had no other choice,” John didn’t realise he had said this out loud.
The first time I held a gun I was fifteen and it was a hunting rifle. My Grandfather was a keen pheasant hunter and once the season was upon us he would take over the family’s estate in Yorkshire and prowl around our land with as many of his friends as he could muster. He continued with this tradition until late into his seventies when both his hearing and eyesight became too poor, but even then he would haunt our halls for those weeks when said poultry hunting was legal.
“Maybe all it says was that he was scared too John, the man hadn’t dated anyone seriously since university and the two dates I know he went on burnt bright for the grand total of an hour. Sherlock ditched one bloke at a bar, climbed out a bloody window, to come and join us at a crime scene.”
Greg sucked in deep breaths of the crisp December air as he stood outside the closed door. He could hear something smash against a wall and imagined it was likely something she thought he would cherish or miss, a wedding picture perhaps; but all it proved for Greg was that walking out when he had, ending this when he had, not being drawn into another unending fight, had been the smartest decision he had made in potentially years.
‘Well John I will take my leave unless there is anything either of you need?’
‘He’s so young.’ It's all John seems to be able to say,
He watches Mina for a few minutes, she’s been quite all through the visit, he’s become used to her little noises and being without them upsets him more than he can explain.  She smiles up at him then and moves so both arms are stretched towards him, she’s always more clingy after a nightmare but Mycroft’s appearance seemed to have distracted her, no matter, John had started developing skills in doing jobs one handed with his daughter balanced on his hip.
“Am I allowed to ask questions, John, or are we leaving the topic of Sherlock alone? Either answer is fine.”
“I don’t want to think like that Greg; like we could have had the whole thing if only our timing had been right.”
‘Now, now little miss we must teach you some new words. Your poor Daddy will develop a complex if not,’ Mrs. Hudson said  Mina just cast their landlady a glance before returning her attention to her already ruined breakfast.
‘You’re what, but you, you don’t wear a ring, you’re not wearing a ring, you never mentioned anyone!’ he seems angry now and Greg understands, he understands because even though he’s estranged from his wife he could never be unfaithful, not in reality, he’s never made his move on Mycroft because he’s not free, free to be with the person he wants, he made a vow and until it’s dissolved he won’t be able to do anything.
“That would be helpful, yes.” All three of them looked for the nearest security team member they could find. Someone must have noticed because a minute later Mina was strapped in; John’s scarf still in hand as her grip bordered on super human sometimes. Mrs Hudson walked in front of them with the pushchair and two agents on either side, each of them carrying half her rather extensive shopping.
“Yeah but eventually,” Greg let the thought drop out there.
“Oh, is he an awfully bad man?”
The trip is a gift for the wife. Christmas? No something more romantic, anniversary then. Husband is overcompensating for weight gain, 18 lbs over 5 months, with an expensive suit. Indulgent for a man whose hours have been cut recently but the girlfriend said it made him look young. Girlfriend younger: early 30’s, no late 20’s. Works with him. Stereotypical; underpaid assistant.
“There was a lot more of it if that’s what you mean.”
‘Hear me Tamara Devereux, I did it as a favour, not doing it again,’ he could be just as stubborn as
“Good evening Gregory. Where are you off to so late this evening?” Greg wasn’t surprised the man was watching him; he spared a short wave for the nearest CCTV camera and heard the younger man chuckle over the car’s speaker system.
He paused when Mina whimpered against him, cutting himself off mid rant. While stroking her back again he tried to sooth himself as well. It was easy to lose himself in confessions but Greg didn’t need any of this. He’d been in the middle of raid mere days ago, he had lost friends, and here John was complaining about his family. God he was ungrateful. Just like his mother always said.
‘Forgive me John I was simply trying to be useful’ John shakes his head and smiles at Mycroft.
“Like I said Mr Holmes, we’ll bring your world down with three little words because there’s nothing you wouldn’t do to keep her safe. Three little words Mr Holmes; Mina Louise Holmes.”
This man tonight, Alexander, I doubt you will hear about him on any British media but Mycroft will and that thought scares me more than it should. I failed to hide myself well tonight John. My face may have been visible to cameras I cannot say for certain. I should have been more careful I know but there were so many children John and I was so angry.
‘I’m sorry Danny but it’s true, I’m married, I can’t do this, I’m sorry.’
John’s genuinely not sure what’s happening, he’d spent the entire time Mr Jones had been present certain that the badly dressed bastard was going to turn around and proclaim him to be unfit for fatherhood yet he was now being informed to expect daughters imminent arrival.
“Greg is fully certified and extensively trained, aren’t you Greg?”
‘Have at it Mycroft, there are some new photographs too that I was meaning to send you, the first ones in the gallery?’ He sees Mycroft’s grin broaden when he finds them. The shots show Mina dressed in the Guinevere outfit Tammy put together, she does look awfully cute. John had wondered at buying her some dresses, she seemed quite taken with them and he didn’t want her to miss out just because he lacked any knowledge in the area, thank god for Tammy.
‘Ok John, Anthea said she’ll have your belongings delivered at the same time.’
‘Alright so the question with the bedroom furniture is colour and design, everything in this section is made of oak but you can have different stains or paints if you’re planning a matching set.’
BROKEN ARM.
‘I’m alright Devin’
‘Sir all clear has been confirmed, no sign of foul play anywhere,’ there’s silence while Mycroft speaks on the other end, he notices Anthea giving him a more thorough once over, he feels quietly exposed but he knows she’s only doing her job, ‘Yes sir,’ more staring now, ‘I would advise it sir, I think he might have more luck,’ Anthea smiles slightly at him, ‘affirmative sir, I shall do that.’ she hands the brick of a phone back to him before taking a seat of the stairs in front of him. She faces away, looking towards the corridor instead of at him
(See the end of the chapter for
Hi just a minor warning, slight mention to child abuse, nothing graphic but the mention of it so if that triggers you then the section of speech starts 'Doctor Watson, you need to understand...' and it occurs towards to end. Stay happy lovely people, MJ X
But now she stood, posture perfect, wine glass placed on a coaster on the side table to her right, facial features held in a neutral arrangement devoid of any strong emotion, except perhaps in her eyes, Mycroft thought to himself before standing as to be able to perform introductions, his Mother’s eyes held a slither of panic he was unused to but before he had the chance to offer her reassurances however the door leading to the hall opened wide and the two remaining members of their dinner party entered. The pair was in good spirits, laughter evident in their features and Mycroft deduced no tension between the two, clearly meeting in a less formal setting had put the men at ease. Siger had been snappish for the preceding hours preferring to take himself off to tend to Mycroft’s, somewhat neglected, orchids rather than be forced into his mothers endless dinner preparations.
I don't know how happy I am with this chapter, it feels clunky but it's taken two days and I figure I should publish before I end up editing it all again. Oh well, I hope anyone reading enjoyed.
The sound of the front door opening causes him to raise his gun once more, he points it at the head of the stairs until he sees the profiles of the two agents, Anthea, the only member of Mycroft’s staff he knows on sight, spares him a look before entering the living room with her gun raised, a bald man John vaguely recognises enters behind her, he hears them move through the rooms quickly, the bald man entering Sherlock’s bedroom while Anthea climbs the stairs towards him, he’s lowered his gun so it would no longer place a kill shot but he refuses to loosen his hold on the weapon, he also refuses to move from his place in front of Mina’s door. Anthea stands seven steps beneath him and merely observes. The house is silent until the other agent reappears;
Siger saw his son leave but made no move to stop him, his sons were some of the finest brains in United Kingdom but he would be damned if either of them had ever been able to handle displays of emotion. He noticed John moving to stand by the window behind them, awarding him and his wife as much privacy as the room would allow.
NEW YEARS
“Sir the only information I have is that he doesn’t want you to know, his reasons are his own.”
Had Mycroft been asked to describe his Mother patient would not have been one of words he would have chosen,
“Their loss then.”
It took two hours and a twenty minute negotiation about security with Mycroft for them to finally arrive at Kew. The morning was crisp and the parks nearly deserted. Mrs Hudson walked confidently through exhibits keeping up a constant commentary for the seemingly fascinated Mina. The little girl sat tucked within the confines of a fluffy white snow suit and surprisingly sturdy shoes. Greg had watched the numerous clips both John and Mycroft had of Mina walking between the tall trees of the arboretum that covered much of the sites 300 acres; however, it appeared Mycroft’s security team had other plans. Every time one of the adults made a move to take Mina from the pushchair the guards motioned not too. It took Greg an unforgivably long time to discover the reasons.
Then there’s the question of Sherlock’s parents, John’s racked his mind to find any mention of them he can, as he doesn’t have a mind palace his efforts have been relatively fruitless, he remembers Sherlock mentioning their existence post case once but he would never provide details, he only garnered their names when a flower arrangement had arrived at 221b with a note asking Mrs Hudson to ensure they arrived at the house, he’s not proud of the fact he read the card they placed on the arrangement for Sherlock, he doesn’t think he would have wanted anyone reading one if he’d written it but there you are,  it had been a simple cream card with black cursive script,
“Because why would he do that?”
Greg managed an uninterrupted night of sleep revelling when he woke in the softness of the mattress that cradled his body. His morning went downhill quickly. Between dodging calls from lawyers, his wife, the media and unknown numbers, Greg resorted to the hidden box of cigarettes he kept stashed in his car before nine o’clock. The constant calls had become such a frequent feature of his morning that he almost ignored the one that came through from John while he was downing his second cup of coffee. He was glad he didn’t in the end.
His mother collected her glass before standing at the drawing room’s window;  it looked out over the lawn and rose beds but Mycroft doubted she would see much through the days fading light, the other members of their party would arrive in due time and there was no point in her working herself up this way. She had lamented Gregory having to leave so soon after he woke up, a mere five hours of his delightful company was not nearly enough she declared, but he had insisted he had important matters to attend to. She had allowed the farewells only after she had forced an agreement for afternoon tea before they returned to Yorkshire the following week.
‘You’re not hijacking if you’re invited, Greg. Did you honestly give her the papers?’ John asked. He’d listened to Greg hem and haw around the topic of divorce through at least three separations in the last year. He’d honestly given up hope of his mate dragging himself out of his hell pit of a marriage.
John had managed to make it a fair way across the garden by now, he thought suddenly that his feet were carrying him on a natural path towards the faint yellow glow, he could make out now that it seemed to be coming from a small shed like structure, he wondered what it was that caused that glowing,
‘Does John suffer from them often Mrs Hudson?’ He thinks it might have been the tone of his voice which makes her turn to him but either way she faces him with something bordering on anger in her features,
‘Which quotes do you like?’
“Its bloody murder, Mycroft, its bloody murder and no one knows. Sherlock is still the fake detective. Everyone still thinks he was a fraud because the man who forced him to commit suicide was just too damn clever for you.”
He feels Mycroft press his lips to his cheek before moving off slightly, his lungs still fighting for oxygen as he comes down from what, had no right to be, one of the most intense orgasms of his life, he feels he should make some move to reciprocate but when he tries, moving his hand the short distance to the front of Mycroft’s trousers, his hand is stopped by another gently wrapped around his wrist,
‘Well in that case I won’t try to see you on the wardrobe, changing table though that’s a must and we do have mahogany over here.’ He led the way to a section a richer toned colours, reds and greens and royal blue, the furniture was darker but in Johns limited knowledge looked hard wearing, and at the prices they were asking he would hope they were. Selecting appropriate pieces and a set of the sapphire blue bedding John left the store considerably poorer but feeling more prepared.
