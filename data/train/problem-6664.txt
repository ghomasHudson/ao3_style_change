Steve’s movement stills, Tony’s quiet admission setting him on edge. “What? They who?”
“Tony…” Steve sighs. “I’m completely supportive of your decision to hide your sexuality if you think it’s best. Knowing what I know about the sports world since I’ve started, I’d sadly have to agree that it’s what’s best. But I don’t want you to think you have to hide it from the people who care about you—”
Howard Stark is extending a very personal invitation to him. The last time the two had talked, Tony wasn't even in the picture, and Howard was drunk and raving over how big of a fan he was. Steve is going into this dinner already on a pedestal, and even if it is just a friendly invitation, that pedestal is automatically placed in the lion's den because of Howard's son.
, Steve thinks morosely, the last time having seen them all together in one place like this being at Dugan’s funeral four years ago. It’s a comfort to see that no matter the distance or time, as soon as they’re all back in one place together they’re able to fall into the same habits from years prior.
“Well if it isn’t Mr. MVP! Aren’t you popular tonight?”
Everyone was dying for an inside scoop. Steve had the luxury of being officially retired after his great big public display of affection, feeling a small amount of guilt that Tony couldn’t hide away so easily. Part of him feared for Tony’s safety, just as he always will, but luckily nothing to the extent of the original incident has happened. Sure, insults are hurled at them from the occasional stranger on the street. There are still protesters outside of their games yelling about sodomy and sin. There will always be reporters so afraid of the truth that two male athletes could’ve fallen in love that they create conspiracies that it’s all some big PR stunt.
Pepper snorts, clearly not believing him either. “Is that what he told you? Because, trust me, that boy is absolutely
him advance. No, Tony has a point to prove, and it looks like the pitcher is now contesting the last call and seems fairly distracted. Tony inches further away from Rogers’ base, eyes darting around the field for any sort of whistle-blower.
“Ah, fuck,” Tony suddenly swears, Steve just now noticing how pale he looks. Arm clutching loosely at his stomach, he scrambles to get out of the booth, knocking the table with his knees as he does so. Before Steve has the chance to question him, Tony is gone in a flash, flying into the bathroom.
“Pythagorean Expectation,” Tony mumbles under his breath.
“Not at the cost of you getting hurt!” Tony explodes. “Don’t think of the stupid game right now, none of that matters!”
!" Tony finally shouts, shoving Steve's chest. "
She gives a half-shrug, tucking a lock of blonde hair that had escaped from her ponytail behind her ear. “We’re technically on break. And, please, like I don’t know you break it all the time.”
you are,” Janet groans from the stairs above, tromping her way down to grab Tony by the elbow. “It’s starting any minute, we have to get down there— Can you two save the teenage flirting for
Snowballs stop coming from Team Steve’s side of the fort, Tony popping his head up cautiously. “You guys ready to wave that white flag or what?” He called over the empty space.
"Marnie's?"
“We shouldn’t be doing this at all,” Steve points out as he hypocritically pulls away to shuck off his button up and undershirt.
Steve hears the familiar voices before the owners of them come around the corner into the locker room. “Both Hodges and Carter don’t want you playing today, you know that right?” The team’s PT continues despite Bucky still walking away from him.
He sits there in silence, almost expecting to see Steve appear beside his window at any moment. He’d knock gently on the glass with one knuckle, face out of view from Tony’s position. He’d roll down the window by an inch and look up to see Steve’s apologetic gaze peeking at him through the gap. ‘
The fury doesn’t leave Janet’s eyes, but it’s also two in the morning, a time when someone can only muster so much anger before needing to deflate. She glares at all the players around the room, assessing the damage. She points at the door, arm in a stiff, straight line. “Everyone back to their rooms. Need I remind you that most of you have a flight back to New York in a few hours? Get some sleep. I’ll yell at you properly once we’re all back on the East Coast.”
Steve sighs. “At least you’ll be close… that’s gotta help, right? Maybe after our game I’ll be able to make it over to the Bronx and catch the end of yours.”
Tony thumbs his way through Steve’s cassettes— yes, seriously
He starts taking the thing apart piece by piece now, ripping each plastic propeller blade out and tossing them into a nearby garbage can. The genius picks up right where he left off, "Problem is, with the added weight I've got to recalibrate the entire frame. Honestly, I might just toss it and start from scratch," He keeps gutting the thing and Steve doesn't know the difference in value between what Tony keeps on the table and what he throws away. "The material has to be dense enough to withstand the force it takes to lift the device including the receiver and the camera, but light enough to where flight is even possible. I had a polyurethane carbon before, but I'm probably going to have to ramp it up and use an aluminum alloy composite for the propellers... the frame might actually be okay the way it is." He taps on the hard plastic of the drone.
“Come on, let’s have a beer on the porch,” Carol says after they finish clearing the plates.
thinking.”
Steve gives one good push with his shoulder and the chain snaps. Tony jumps back as the door swings open, and Steve ignores his indignant cries as he shoves past him into the suite, looking around for any evidence of the reporter. They must've already been in the bedroom.
The alarm clock blares incessantly at him, lazy arm snaking its way out from the sheets to palm at it until he manages to hit the snooze button. The skylight on his slanted ceiling casts a long rectangle of light onto the far wall, fuzzy and faded yellow that slowly saturates around the edges as dawn creeps closer and Tony’s alarm continues to go off every five minutes. He eventually peels himself out of bed to shut it off fully, looking back at the empty space next to him.
Steve rather than
“My best friend,” Steve clarifies, somehow forgetting that the two have never met, despite their significance in his life. “He lived directly below us. My mom was pretty protective of me at the time, but Buck always took care of me and made sure I didn’t push myself too hard. I started playing outside with them more and more, and baseball was a huge part of me getting stronger. After high school, Bucky wanted to start taking it more seriously, so we started in the rookies together…” Steve bites down on his lip, realizing that Tony has probably heard his life story at least from that point onward about a hundred times from his father. “When did you know you wanted to play?” He deflects, knowing that if there was one way to appeal to the young star it was to get him to talk about himself.
“Ball four! Walk!”
“It’s not going to matter how hard you push yourself if we win this game and you injure yourself before we even get to the Series,” Steve sighs in frustration. “We can afford for you to sit this one out.”
check the locker r-room?” He bites down on his lip as Tony deepthroats him, no regard for him struggling to keep cover.
Tony just hums.
noticeable. Some could even say naturally and physically impossible.”
“Considering we’ve got the rest of our lives, please do,” Bucky grins and is able to doge Natasha’s elbow without even looking. “Love you, dearest,” he drawls, kissing her on the cheek.
Tony’s leg jumps up and down with anticipation. After the disgrace of Fury and Natasha collectively banning him from being eligible for last year’s All-Star game, Janet had convinced them to come around this year and at least see if he could win the media/fan choice if given the option.
He's been pretty good these past few weeks about not lashing out at everyone trying to help him. His physical therapy training with Dr. Erskine is slow-going, but going all the same. For a while, it was impossible for even Steve to try and keep him rational about the situation, but he eventually came around. For the first few times, Steve would just drop him off and pick him up, but lately Bucky has allowed him to come in towards the tail end of each session.
Her arms are crossed, expression unimpressed at his cluelessness. “Coulson and Hill track your every move, Stark. Did you really think I wouldn’t find out?”
she had told Steve during last year’s off season, when he first found out his injury would keep him from major league play.
Surprisingly enough, Tony isn’t in the gym or locker room when Steve heads inside to look for him, and he can’t seem to find any sign of life anywhere else in the stadium save for the occasional janitor or two passing him by. Which leaves one place Tony can be.
!’ But you never did. I never got anxious about you staying the night; I started
“Steeeve…” Tony interrupts lowly, slow grin spreading across his face. “You’re not a virgin, are you?”
He wonders if she knows about him and Steve. They’ve been able to fly under the radar thus far. They’re
I thought I was doing plenty to just
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “What am I supposedly overcompensating for? It’s a crime to flirt now?”
Steve is present in the moment, undeniably overjoyed for two of his best friends getting married, but he can’t help but let his eyes slide past them to where Tony is standing on the other side of the altar. They catch each other’s eyes more than once, sharing small and knowing smiles together. Tears are shining in Tony’s bright, honey-colored eyes, something he’ll surely blame on Barton later.
Steve lets Tony argue the semantics and relativity of time as a concept all the way to the bedroom where he passes out as soon as his head hits the pillow. Steve crawls into bed behind him, wrapping an arm protectively around his middle despite the fact that he knows he won’t be disappearing in the night. No longer carrying a heart laden with worries of feelings not being reciprocated, it’s one of the most sound sleeps of his life.
The buzzing from the speaker by his door grows incessant as Tony rushes around his apartment. He stubs his toe on a stray wrench that had somehow become sentient and found its way in the middle of his living room, sending it skittering across the hardwood floor.
Bucky throws his head back in laughter. "If she does I'm in trouble," he glances over to their teammate who’s still immersed in a game of quarters on the opposite end of the bar. "I'm gonna get out while he's still distracted."
"Tony, please," Steve sighs, following him into the tiled room. "You can't avoid me forever, you know."
Tony deserves an award for holding himself back, not even so much as twitching at the low blow. He refuses to give Ty anymore than he’s already getting, keeping his expression composed. “You’ll finally have the spotlight with me out of the picture. Funny, I guess not even the steroids were enough to surpass me.”
Steve has to drown out the sounds of the crowd, shaking his head. He can’t let himself get psyched out by the pitcher now. He watches the man carefully, trying to determine what he was going to do next. Steve doesn't want to go for a bunt just to land a hit. When he pitched the third ball, Steve held his position.
. Every time Steve tries to breach the subject, Tony finds a way to brush it off.
going to cut it. Now, most of my clothes are custom made or tailored, so they’re not going to fit you, but surely you brought something else,” he goes over to Steve's closet and dresser drawers, immediately combing through his very limited options. The best thing he finds is a simple, pressed white dress shirt and a hideous brown sports jacket.
He sounds genuinely impressed, and not like he’s just saying it for Steve’s sake. He glows with both embarrassment and pride by the praise, ducking his face into the back of Tony’s neck as he tugs him fully under the showerhead so they can properly rinse off.
People still may not be ready to accept Tony for who he is, but his teammates are hellbent on protecting him this time around. According to Janet, all publicity is good publicity if you know how to use it. Her top priority is still Tony’s safety, but both he and Steve know she’s just doing her job when she talks about them like they’re assets. With it being Steve’s last season, and Tony’s heroic comeback, it’s going to be a very Avengers’ focused season in the Triple-A, which is exactly what they want.
“Our team,” Steve corrects. “And I think I need to thank you as much as anyone else. I know I don’t need to tell you this, but you bring a lot to the team. I can’t imagine we’d make it to this point without you.”
the man in his arms. Steve’s hands slide reassuringly into his hair, fingers curling against his neck, holding him steadfast.
“Okay, feel better, man,” Clint shrugs. “I’ll see you later…” He throws one last odd look Steve’s way before exiting.
. Steve steps up with bases loaded and gets a two-run sweep, the next batters assisting further and driving another two home with some sacrifice flies to end the inning.
“A fight?! With
With speed Tony shouldn’t be surprised by, Steve is out of his chair and on him in an instant, grabbing his arms and forcing him away from the table to prevent further destruction. Tony’s thrashing attempts at escape are futile once Steve decides a better approach is to just wrap his arms around him, trapping his arms down against his sides. Tony still has legs though, and uses them by kicking out, foot managing to clip his chair and send it toppling to the side, crushing more glass underneath it.
Tony opens his mouth and immediately clamps it shut.  “You’re right,” he changes his course. “But you were never going to make that decision. I deserve to be the bad guy here; I was the one who pulled the trigger. I needed to face my own demons instead of push them on everyone else.”
Tony plops down in a seat next to him with his own pair a few minutes later, eyes narrowed at him. “Why this place?” He asks curiously.
“Hey!” Another familiar voice booms from the entryway. “You four chucklefucks wanna tell me what you’re doing dicking around and not getting on the bus?”
The music suddenly stops, Steve realizing he had just been staring around the workshop without actually announcing his presence. Tony has spun around in his chair now, and is staring blankly at him. “Morning, sunshine,” he says, taking a sip from a steaming mug.
“You know, I really don’t appreciate being singled out like this,” Tony huffs, narrowed eyes still trained on Steve’s behind as he tries to figure the best way to go for the keys. Maybe he stares for a little longer than necessary, but no one seems to notice.
This was a newer tradition in the baseball world, and Tony loves the addition. Beginning last year, the Triple-A League put together a huge All-Star Championship game that was to take place in the middle of every season, normally the day after the Major's All-Star game. Since the Triple-As were split into two sections, the Pacific Coast League and the International League, these two almost never got to play each other during the regular season. Now, the crème de la crème are chosen from every team in the league to represent their division.
She places her hand on top of Steve’s, her dark eyes watering as she turns them on him. Her gaze is so intense it makes him want to glance away, but he maintains eye contact. “Please take care of him, Steve.”
“Better come back here quick, we can’t get the show on the road without you!” Bucky calls after him teasingly as he heads for the door.
"Three twenty-five," Steve corrects. "Now what was that about dinner?"
Steve has no interest in sticking around, knowing exactly how this conversation is going to go. He’s seen enough hourglass-figured ingénues cross into Tony’s path and completely occupy him for the immediate future. He spends the next few hours of his time seeking out fans and supporters of the team instead, engaging as many of them as he can in conversation to thank them properly. Without them, they’d have no one to be going to the Championship for aside from themselves. He doesn’t care how pedantic it sounds: he just can’t believe in that celebrating an accomplishment like this alone is nearly as gratifying as celebrating it with those that helped get you there in the first place.
Steve is trapped between two different arguments now, turning back to look at Clint and Strange fighting over the remote while the rest of their team goads them on, mixing in a few complaints that they were going to miss the end of the game if they didn’t hurry up.
It works out. Steve plans on having a quiet day to himself to draw, maybe even go for a walk around the city to try and seek out a naturally occurring photo-op. Tony kisses him goodbye at the door, promising to stop by after with takeout from their new favorite Greek place up the block. He calls Janet ahead of time just to be nice, the woman brief on the phone just to keep the mystery alive.
,” Steve mouths, giving a stern shake of his head. “
“You’ll want to go downstairs, there’s concrete and aluminum in these walls that will interfere with the signal,” he interrupts before reaching over and turning his stereo back on. The blaring music leaves no further room for argument, Steve quietly picking up the phone and retreating back down the stairs. He feels awful for even implying in front of Tony that he didn’t want to be here, but he’ll have to find a time to apologize for that later. He knows the man well enough at this point to know his stubbornness has a time limit, and he’ll just need to wait it out.
“Tony,” he interrupts calmly. “It’s fine. Just drop it.”
“Figures,” Rhodey laughs, brushing off Steve’s weird behavior. “Now if you don’t mind me, I’m gonna go smoke our birthday boy on the lanes.”
Unlike when Bucky retired, Steve didn’t really stay on top of things that went on in the realm of baseball. He hung up his glove for good, that part of his life behind him now. He stayed uninvolved beyond remaining a sponsor for the Avengers and attending as many of Tony’s games as he could. He’s happy though, living upstate, selling his paintings and photos, doing freelance work here and there. It’s a good life, all things considered.
Purposefully, he edges his way back closer to Steve, watching the pitcher’s suspicious gaze turn forward again.
, Steve. This is fucking bullshit! We’re getting slaughtered out there! What the
Steve leans down and kisses the grin right off Tony’s face. The water has gone cold by now, both of them hastily cleaning themselves off before shutting it off and grabbing their towels. Seeing that there’s only the two of them left, they steal a few more kisses and gropes here and there, though Tony is more of a culprit of that, Steve having to practically hold him at arm’s length just so he can have a few seconds to get changed. As appealing as the thought of bending Tony over the bench is, Steve’s pretty sure he’s done with that kind of risk for the day. Besides, they have plans.
“Do you really have to shake these?” Tony asks as the piece of film develops, pinching one corner carefully between two fingers.
He doesn't hear the rest of the nurse’s words, everything drowned out by a white noise as he numbly makes his way through the parking garage. The only thing he can hear is his own labored breathing as he shakily gets into his car, practically snapping the door handle off in the process. “Presbyterian,” he echoes shakily, cutting off whatever the nurse had been saying. “That’s on— William Street, right? Right off the Brooklyn Bridge?”
Accepting all the pats on the back from his teammates as he heads into the dugout to grab some water, he feels a hand seize him by the back of his jersey, choking him for a moment as he’s yanked backwards. “Ack— Hi, Coach.”
. Tony’s head is swimming with all sorts of dismissals and arguments, but who was we exactly? “Nat agrees with you on that? Because I find that hard to believe,” he crosses his arms. Natasha has become one of his closest friends here, and he can’t fathom that she could be in on this without even talking to him about it first.
"What happens when you two become hot commodities and a bigger, richer team buys you out from under us?" Peggy asks, suddenly serious.
from a teenager, Tony still manages to make him feel as giddy as one. Janet smiles at him sweetly as she passes by him with Tony in tow, tugging him down the rest of the stairs. More footsteps come from above as the rest of their side of the wedding party comes down.
The smirk quickly turns into a scowl, Hammer spitting at the ground between his feet. There are no more words exchanged before the teams are dismissed to their respective sides of the field.
, you didn’t walk away from this. Weeks kept going by and you never hit me with a ‘
Tony’s head snaps over to look at Bucky, wondering if the man is trying to call his bluff. He doesn’t look conniving or manipulative, pose relaxed as he drives with one hand on the wheel, the other resting on the center console. “He did?” Tony asks, voice catching in his throat slightly. He and Steve had agreed on keeping things a secret for a multitude of reasons. Pepper only knows because she’s privy to everything going on in Tony’s life, and he supposes it’s only fair if Steve has someone he can talk to about their relationship as well.
“At least you can keep up with him,” she sighs playfully as Steve spins her around if only to not be faced with the suggestive smirk for too long.
“Not attacking,” Tony interrupts the woman, still staring Steve down. “Just assuming I’m a damn
“You’re calling the shots today, Pete. Make sure to give us that strong lead I know you can. I want the other team
Tony just scoffs, truly speechless for once. The room is uncomfortably silent for a few moments before Coulson clears his throat, turning to face Tony. “We’ve had our eyes on your for a while, Mr. Stark. Specifically Coach Danvers
He dejectedly leaves the building, the media now scattered down the street but still lying in wait. Steve shoves past the group of them that resurge to try and get some kind of quote, squinting through the rain as he jogs back to his car to escape them.
Steve’s hand starts to draw before he even realizes what he’s doing, marking down the contours of his face and the vague outline of his shapeless form beneath the blanket. He thought Tony might look more peaceful in his sleep, but if anything, his mind seems just as active as when he’s awake. He keeps seeing little ticks on Tony’s face, his lips parting and closing occasionally like some part of his addled brain is still trying to form a clever remark, eyebrows twitching expressively, his long, dark lashes fluttering as if his ever-searching eyes are still trying to find something interesting to piece together or pick apart on the inside of his eyelids.
All in all, being trapped inside an apartment with a ticking time bomb personality like Tony for days isn’t nearly as awful as someone might expect. And the sex is… well, that’s just an added bonus. An extremely nice bonus that Steve is enjoying very,
Tony’s fork scrapes against his plate, his gaze slowly rising back up to stare at his boyfriend. “What do you mean
His eyes drop away, good humor waning slightly. “Not everyone,” he responds quietly, not even meaning to voice it out loud. He blames the concussion.
"Right then," Howard clears his throat and accepts the phone from the butler.
, so I could see why he was so torn up about it. I was shocked at first just because Steve’s never really given any inclination of swinging that way, but I was really more surprised as
Whitaker shakes his head in anger, looking out to the field to make sure they’re all set for the next inning to start before he storms over in front of Tony, getting into his personal space. He jabs a finger into Tony’s chest. “You better watch your fucking tone, kid. You’re not the first hot shot dickhead I’ve had to kick off my team. Now this attitude might fly back in Malibu, but not here. You wanna know the reason you’re done playing for today? It’s because of that big head of yours thinking you’re the
Janet ushers them along quickly, Tony stopping to sign a few autographs for some of the dedicated fans waiting for their arrival. This causes Thor to stop as well, and soon it’s both Janet and airport security trying to break apart the mini herd that had formed. Half of Tony’s signature gets a little mangled on a photo from his Playgirl shoot as Steve tugs him away by the elbow, but the woman looks thrilled either way.
When security shows up minutes later to escort him out of the building, Steve is still beating uselessly at the unresponsive door with both hands, his forehead pressed against it as he calls out Tony’s name. Steve doesn’t fight it as they apologize and tell him he’ll have to leave the premises, letting them escort him back to the elevator.
“Not really,” she shrugs. “A couple of close friends. My family, of course. They’re all very supportive as they made clear over breakfast,” she laughs, rolling her eyes. “Mostly people outside of the baseball world. I have a hard enough time as just a woman, I’d rather not throw
Tony.”
“I’m surprised to see you up. You’re late and hungover to almost every morning practice we have,” Steve comments. “What were you up to?”
"Should you be operating, um, heavy machinery?"
“Tony is fine,” he fiddles with the settings on the bed until he’s inclined to a comfortable sitting position. “And sure, after I go to the bathroom. Am I allowed to do that by myself?”
“Is Tony alright? Can we please see him?” Peggy begs in desperation.
"Godspeed," Steve replies, giving Bucky a firm push towards the door. Now that he knows Buck is taken care of, Steve doesn’t feel bad about slipping out the back door and heading home.
"You know it," Tony flashes her a smile. "They working you hard today, Dove?"
the place.”
They don’t go to bed just yet, both of them slipping into their shared home office. It’s the only room they’ve actually gotten 100% set up so far, more as a necessity than anything else. When they signed the lease for this Brooklyn flat two months ago, they immediately started getting what was primarily Steve's office together, with a nook in the corner where Tony could reside, tucked away in a comfortable armchair to do whatever coach-type work needed to be done while Steve sat at his computer behind the big mahogany desk. Tony starts rifling through the filing cabinet, combing through copies of all the hand-me-downs of info from Janet’s records until he finds the folders he’s looking for, stacking them up in his arms and retreating to his corner.
“Uh,” Steve has to flip the book closed to check the cover, having absolutely no idea what he had grabbed. “
The man is getting into a pickup truck that looks like it could use a paint job about five years ago. Tony looks at his roadster parked across the street and hopes no one decides to come along and vandalize it before he climbs up into the cab with a total stranger.
Steve is actually surprised when Peggy asks for Tony to wait in the car while she talks to Steve. He hasn’t ever really seen the kid lose his cool before, but he was unable to hide the twitch in his jaw at Peggy’s request. Steve tries to contain his own grin, ducking his head as Peggy walks over to his motorcycle with him, her hand on his back.
Steve actually glares at him. “Stop that. You know I hate it when you treat me like I’m just some naive idiot to this stuff. You throw yourself at everything half-cocked and fall back on the excuse that you’re young and dumb, so you don’t get to act like the wise one when it comes to our relationship.”
Steve can’t help but laugh, his hand coming down on Tony's shoulder much to the shorter man's surprise. "Can't wait."
“Yeah, because I wasn’t trying to sell my soul out to a team. I did that to prove a point,” he argues.
Tony certainly doesn’t fail to notice that the opposing team is rotating pitchers every two innings, an unconventional move on the Irons’ part. He knows they have more active members than the Avengers, but how many pitchers does Killian have at his disposal? Maybe it’s a strategic decision. Even if Tony isn’t the one at bat, most people know of Tony’s tendencies to analyze players and immediately pinpoint the exact ways to combat their abilities, which is information he can easily share with his coach and teammates. He could also be baiting Natasha to switch out pitchers as well, knowing Tony is their best shot at outsmarting his batters. Tony trusts Tasha to keep her word, and so far she’s given no indication that she’s going to pull Tony from the mound. Killian’s playing a game of chicken by himself and it has yet to pay off considering even with all the substitutions, no side seems to be pulling far enough ahead to warrant any comfort.
Steve hesitates. “Actually, it’s Sam. Yeah, he’s in town and I got a few drinks with him and crashed at his place last night.”
“I don’t know, but you’d find a way,” he retorts sourly.
Tony quickly glances around both ends of the hall before grabbing Steve by the front of his sweatshirt and yanking him inside. He kicks the door shut and locks it behind him, practically climbing up into Steve’s arms. Steve catches his weight, hoisting him up so that their lips can meet in a clumsy reunion. “Oh my god,” Tony says between kisses, holding onto his face just to make extra sure he’s real. “What are you— Doing here?”
Tony’s back is to him, facing the back wall of the stadium. There are hundreds of baseballs littering the ground, a thinning pile next to him. Steve watches as he picks up ball after ball, winding up and throwing a pitch at a small square outlined in duct tape on the wall.
Thank you guys so much for continuing reading and leaving such nice comments. 💕 See you guys with chapter 5 in 2-3 weeks! (Hopefully!!!)
Tony slides when he knows he’s closed the distance he needed. He comes to a stop right on the base almost at the exact same time he feels the catcher’s mitt come into contact with his thigh. Both their heads whip upwards to look at the referee. His arms come together in front of him before being thrust outwards in a horizontal line, deeming that Tony had made it in another close call. His elbow that had been propping him up went lip, collapsing onto his back in relief as the uproar of cheers washed over him. He blinked up at the blue, blue sky, still breathing hard even as a referee urged him to get up before he’d have to eject him for holding up the game.
Tony wants to ask. He knows that it’s an impossible question for her to answer. He almost broaches the topic of his and Steve’s argument from when she ran into them the day before, but he knows he can’t run to everyone else when he’s having relationship problems to hope they have solutions for him. This is something he has to figure out on his own.
“You think it had to do with…” Steve feels his throat tighten, a hotness prickling at his own eyes. His stomach drops again and he’s unable to voice a concern that had been pushed to the back of his mind as something that you just heard stories about, not things that could actually happen to you or your loved ones.
“Doc, it sounds like I’m not going to be pitching in the World Series later this month,” he smiles sardonically.
There are blackout curtains keeping out all signs of light, which explains why Steve slept in so easily for once. In his own apartment, his curtains are gauzy and weak, really just there for show. The plastic blinds over his windows do very little to keep out the morning light, but here there’s thick fabric covering the floor-to-ceiling glass walls.
“How is solidifying how we feel about each other ruining things?” Steve asks, genuinely curious why Tony’s thoughts go directly to doomsday possibilities. “I’m not saying that we need to come out to the world and fearlessly proclaim we’re in a relationship, but I want us to at least be honest with
They don’t get another run after Steve’s grand slam, but that hardly matters. Tony’s not going to let a single run past him until the end, meaning they only need three runs on the next inning, and then they win. What may have seemed impossible mere moments ago is now in reach. Any kind of passive nature either team had in regards to who walked away as a winner or loser for this game is gone. With such an exciting upset, both teams are hungry for victory, and the time is running out.
The ride is just as nice as he expected, the wind whipping past him as he gets on the highway and makes his way back into the city. It’s strange that he doesn’t miss it nearly as much as he thought he would. Bucky had the right idea moving upstate, and now the distance between them didn’t feel as large. He’s able to see him almost every weekend, whether it’s at either of their homes or at one of Tony’s games.
He wants to start a fight, to argue that of course he
"You started playing in the minor league at 15, and now are sitting next to a team going towards going to the World Series. Is this where you thought you'd be?"
Tony scoots closer to him on the couch, holding the photo close to his face to watch it develop, giving it the occasional little flap through the air. “Not too shabby.” Once it’s developed completely, he passes it to Steve for his own approval.
Steve squints at the semantics. “Well in that case, I’m not quitting. I’m
Another reporter stands up, looking at Steve. "Even though you've only played for the Stars for a couple seasons now, your popularity is enormous amongst fans. What do you think it is about you that makes you such a fan favorite?"
for a while now. And I know we haven’t really talked about it because you get all dodgy when I try to bring it up, but I think both of us know that this is more than just us being close friends who occasionally fool around.”
“Okay guys, thanks to Stark we were able to keep the last inning at a standstill. Now I don’t want to see a single one of you go out there without giving it your all.
seen Tony’s record, and it’s fully in his capabilities to strike out every single one of them. He was quite interested, however. When they had played against each other for the All-Star game last year, Tony wasn’t even slated as a pitcher. Steve has never seen him actually pitch in real life and wonders if he’s all he’s cracked up to be.
He remembers the game at this point last year, how they all were practically begging for a mercy killing to end it. It had been a truly soul crushing defeat for his team, the final scoreboard reading Irons: 15 - Avengers: 3. Its marked in the books as the biggest gap in points in the history of the single-game Championship event. It’s a David vs Goliath story that, last year, didn’t end well for David.
“Nothing against you, specifically, Steve,” she amends, patting his arm. “It’s just… Dating
. Steve doesn’t care what kind of leaps and bounds technology seems to be making these days, he will always love his simple, crisp newspapers.
His walls have dissolved completely, Tony almost choking on the scornful apathy in the air. “I bet you’re fucking pleased.”
Patches receives one quick belly rub before Steve heads back inside, sure that the end of the season festivities were already in full swing. By the time he pulls up to the pub a half hour later, he can hear the boisterous crew inside even over the roar of his engine.
Steve shrugs, crunching on perfectly crisped bacon. “Suit yourself. I’ll see you later.” He inhales a few more bites of food before pulling his shirt on and heading out the door, leaving Tony to his own conflicted thoughts.
His Stark-brand flair is showcased elsewhere, a custom garage built out back to house all his cars and double as his lab for the more extraneous projects his mind cooked up when he’s home on break. That space is all Tony’s, but they worked together to make something for the both of them as well.
Steve’s jaw tightens. “You don’t mean that,” he says softly.
Suddenly the scoreboard reads 3-7, and it’s not even the bottom of the sixth yet. Tony almost can’t bear to watch as Bender’s morale dips lower and lower, his performance following suit. Steve hasn’t gone in yet either, and Tony is practically pulling his hair out while his Captain attempts to keep him in check with a calming hand on his shoulder.
“Christmas back in ‘92?” She reminds him. Steve immediately feels a warm rush of fondness at the memory of him and Tony finally figuring it all out after years of misunderstandings and ill-aimed animus. “You and Bucky were both supposed to come to Christmas at the Bartons, but
at first when he told me. Then I told him what an idiot he was.”
games. Every. Last. One. I see that look on your face every time you strike a player out, or steal a base, or really just outsmart anyone else on that field. I've seen you yell and cry and cheer over the result of a call. I've seen you throw fits over not getting your way just like I’ve seen you dogpile in on your teammates and shake hands with your opponents. And sure, maybe I’m just like any other spectator watching the games on TV or from the stands, but that much passion doesn’t come out of someone who doesn’t give a fuck about what he’s doing. So if you’re really going to try and say the reason you don’t want to take this deal is because you don’t
Tony shrugs one shoulder. “Don’t thank me, they’re your clothes.” He spins back around in his chair to go back to his sketching.
He earns something between a laugh and a snort as Steve follows him back inside. They change into lightweight running gear and Tony takes Steve on a loop around the bluffs of the cape to give him a tour of the path-less-traveled by tourists. It’s not the most elegant course, plenty of hilly slopes and fields beset by knee-height grass. It’s a rolled ankle waiting to happen, but luckily neither of them get hurt when breaking away from the sand-dirt path through the moor. Their journey takes them through fields overrun with clusters of wildflowers, barren trees to their right and the cliff face leading down to the beaches below to their left. They keep up a steady pace, taking a winding path to travel at least a few miles away from Tony’s chalet, eventually taking a break atop a wide berm that stretches out over an idyllic, pastoral view, houses scarcely dotted across the landscape.
Steve watches the antics from afar, happily eating his nachos with the terrible, rubbery, room temperature cheese. He’s sitting alone at a small table at the edge of where everyone’s gathered, close enough to still see all the action while staying far enough away from Tony. They have an unspoken rule about keeping things casual in public, not needing to raise suspicion to what they’re relationship is really like. All the fun and teasing aside, it could be incredibly detrimental to both their careers and their personal lives if the true nature of their relationship was to get out. As much as it kills Steve to keep his distance when all he wants to do is be close to Tony on his birthday, he knows they just
“Huh.”
about the same-sex growing up?”
Holy crap. I'm not crying, you're crying. The story isn't even technically over, but I am STUPIDLY EMOTIONAL about the last official chapter. While I think this is a perfectly good end to Steve and Tony's story, I'm too much for a sucker for a flashforward epilogue to not add one on to this story.
"Steve," Peggy's voice pulls his attention. "There's someone I'd like you to meet."
They duck behind their snow forts and immediately start readying up ammo, Steve counting down before each side starts sending off their barrage of snowballs. Tony is unsurprisingly accurate and fast with his throws, purposefully ignoring any of the minors as targets and only aiming for Steve’s face. They clearly have a better defense with the ridiculous fortress Tony had managed to scrape together in ten minutes, so there’s only one logical thing to do: go on the offense.
“Fuck, seriously?” Tony groans in annoyance as they step into the room. It’s still large and lavish, a huge bathroom and en suite kitchen available to them, a great view of the glittering city below from their large window. The only problem is that the two queen-sized beds are in one shared room.
“You’re pretty far from Manhattan,” he remarks.
Steve’s eyes flicker away from her, picking at his chips in his basket. He glances back up at her to see her smiling still, a look of understanding in her eyes. “It’s okay, Steve. Tony told me about you two,” she keeps her voice lowered, even though there’s no one nearby or paying them any mind to eavesdrop.
Work has kept me busy, but I've always had an eye on you." He winks which makes Steve even more flustered than he was before. He’s still trying to process that
Tony gets out of the car and looks around, a flickering neon light source catching his eye from across the street. There’s a run-down looking bar with only a couple of cars parked out front, but that’s more sign of life than Tony can see finding anywhere else. He takes a scrap of paper and pen out of his glovebox and jots down a quick note, sticking it under one windshield wiper.
“You look excited to be here,” Steve comments, Tony’s mouth open wide in a yawn as he stops in front of his locker which is now directly beside Steve’s.
a real game with Tony Stark if you don’t get out there, kid,” Tony says from behind them.
Steve is taken aback by that, almost offended. “Why?”
“As long as you’re using your brain!” Rhodey calls out after him. He glances Steve’s direction raising an eyebrow. “What?”
As Steve rounds the corner of the hallway leading to Tony’s room, his heart skips a beat when he sees the door is already partially open. Maybe he can get in easier than he thought. Or the door would just get slammed in his face. As he gets closer, he sees a man crouched by the door with a toolbox propping it open.
He feels goosebumps raise up on the back of his neck.
“Me too,” Steve answers immediately without really thinking about it. They share a small smile.
Steve wants to scream at Tony to shut up. He has no idea what he’s getting into right now. Natasha has a reputation as one of the hardest coaches in the minor league. At first, Steve assumed it was so she wasn’t undermined as a woman, but he soon caught on that gender had absolutely nothing to do with it. She’s a hard ass who refuses to take anyone’s excuses, all the way down to her core.
Steve still can’t believe this is a real offer. He remembers Peggy making a similar joke to him years ago, and he’s sure he thought the same thing he’s thinking right now. Just because he knows baseball and was a Captain at one point doesn’t mean he can take on the burden of managing an entire team. And especially one that’s risen to such promise. What if he screwed it up? Former players became managers and coaches all the time, but that didn’t mean it was the kind of career path for him. Athletes had tendencies to retire early, whether it was willing or because of physical strain. For Steve, it was a bit of both. Even now his injury didn’t bother him all that much, his hand moving under the table to absentmindedly rub at his brace.
“I said break it up you two!”
“Ball!”
"And do you smoke?" Peggy asks.
Tony doesn't glance up as he sits down and starts to take the device apart. It's about the size of a dinner plate with four propellers on it, and that's about all Steve can deduce. "Drone."
He almost expects the offer to get turned down. He’s never seen Steve enjoy more than the occasional two-dollar beer whenever he ends up going out. “I’ll have an Old Fashioned, please.”
“Right, this is your first season back since leaving the Avengers four years ago to attend MIT, Tony’s alma mater. Were you nervous coming back after so many years out of practice?”
Steve thinks of the teams that will be playing for the World Series over the next month while he is officially in his off-season, a part of him wishing he can experience that. As unrealistic as it is for a first year player in the MLB to be lucky enough to sign onto a team that competes in the World Series, there’s always hope for next year. As long as he has Bucky at his side, nothing else really matters.
The Stars are up to bat again, and Steve and Bucky are too far apart in the batting rotation to have any real conversation. Bucky gets a double, the next two batters helping him along to slide into home. There’s some contesting over whether or not he was tagged out, the crowd and players alike growing anxious. Brooklyn needs every run they can get at this point. Hodge is arguing tensely with the ref before the play is deemed good, earning cheers and boos from both sides.
“I’ll let you boys handle it from here,” Carol cuts in with an eye roll before turning back to the players. “Happy to have some of you back. I look forward to seeing the rest of you prove yourselves,” she says before taking her leave.
As always, I love this fic more than anything and hope you guys are enjoying it too. I'm still sticking to saying I'm going to TRY and update within about 3 weeks, but uhhhhhh we'll see!!!
about this, Tony.”
A tense and awkward silence hangs in the air. Steve is pretending to busy himself with examining the row of bats lined up on a rack, fingers gliding over the wooden and metal surfaces. “Sir, I hope you don’t mind me asking this, but do you happen to know why Tony left the Irons?”
Steve sits down on his own bed, facing Tony. “I don’t know if that’s the word I would use. It was certainly entertaining.” He nods towards an envelope sitting on the table in the corner. “I collected your winnings for you after you go too drunk to walk out of the place.”
Tony shrugs in defeat. “I'm sort of at the end of my rope here, so yeah, why not?”
the idea that some part of you could still be around to see what I’m doing and hear me now… Well, I just want you to know that I did what I set out to do from the start. Despite Howard’s last-ditch effort to guilt me into going back to the Irons from beyond the grave— big surprise— I didn’t listen. I’m still playing for the Avengers and despite some issues at the start of the season, we’ve been doing really well. I’m going to be playing
At least once or twice a week during the season, he and Tony have gotten in the habit of grabbing breakfast or dinner just the two of them, or meeting up in the city for whatever reason they can come up with that would be improved by some company. A lot of the time, it’s Steve tagging along with Tony when he decides to go shopping for clothes, hardware materials, or art for his apartment. Steve introduced him to one of his favorite flea markets, and any time they’re lucky enough to not have a morning weekend game scheduled, they get up early to peruse all the artisans’ wares. Steve even lets Tony give his input towards records or movies that seem interesting to him. Without fail, Steve usually ends up walking out with vinyls and VHS tapes he would normally have no intent on buying. A lot of it is a bit beyond the genres he would normally associate himself with, but there’s something kind of endearing about Tony’s odd, eclectic taste being juxtaposed into his life.
The last part is said more as a strict warning rather than a suggestion. “Right,” Tony responds dryly. “Thank you, Doctor.”
, being the operative amount there. I swear, it’s like his sole purpose in life is to bend things until they break.”
He hates when Steve, or anyone else, calls attention to his sobriety. “
They sit in silence for a few minutes, not having exchanged a word by the time Miss Sun comes back with their drinks. Tony pours tea into his cup, absently running a finger around the rim of it without taking a sip or looking up at Steve.
is Rezzo waiting for?!”
A hum of interest rumbles in Tony’s throat when he feels it too, Steve feeling his lips curve into a grin as his hand snakes lower. He feels the pressure of his hand wrap around his growing erection in his jeans, Steve’s hand instinctively shooting down to grab Tony by the wrist. He doesn’t move it away, but he doesn’t let go either. Tony breaks away from the kiss, Steve’s eyes snapping open almost sheepishly at his sudden reaction.
Tony takes a deep breath and lifts his gaze, flipping the cards face down onto the podium as he stares directly into the camera with the blinking red light.
Even with all that excitement, what Peggy had mentioned offhand resonates with him. What happens if he does get sold? The Stars are on the lower end of financial prospects in the MLB. Players are sold off and traded all the time, no matter what the player themselves wants. His contract can already be set in stone when the next season starts and he won’t really have much say in negotiation. It will always be a possibility that lingers in the back of Steve's mind.
Even if he knows this is the best team someone could hope to be apart of, he doubts Tony will ever feel so strongly about them the way he does. Once Tony gets what he wants out of this— more fame, controversy, notoriety, whatever it is he’s looking for, Steve has no doubts in his mind that he’ll ditch them as soon as the opportunity arises.
Tony is sitting up on his side of the bed, thick-framed glasses still perched on his nose when Steve emerges from the bathroom. The lamp on his bedside table is on, folder still open in his lap as he reads over the charts in front of him, occasionally marking something with a pen.
The worst part is, Tony knows he’s right. It’s not like the Knights are the only players who do it either. “Who said I was going to tell anyone?”
Some days are nicer than others during the month-long getaway in Truro. On the days they’re bombarded with blustering Fall winds, they stay inside, reading to each other, sketching, playing chess, watching movies. When the cloud cover dwindles and allows the sun to shine down on the cape, they go for walks along the bluffs, Steve bringing his camera to take pictures. While he snaps plenty of shots of just the landscapes, he insists Tony get in some of them as well. He ends up taking what have to be hundreds of photos of Tony alone, but he’s always loved the camera, so he can’t complain.
team in
Peggy nods and squeezes Steve's arm. "It was really good to see you again, Steve. We really should catch up sometime soon."
“I think you owe us the truth after
The only question he knows he can answer is the first one. He’s not ashamed of what happened with Tony, nor of his feelings for the man. He stands up from the couch and heads back towards the loft, knowing he needs to clear that up straight away and make his intentions clear.
. Playfully, he pushes Steve’s hand away and gets to his feet. “I’m fine. It’s a nice morning for a jog is all.”
Flashes of cameras immediately start going off now that Tony has appeared, the throng of them pushing against the human barrier of the police and hurling so many questions over one another that Tony can’t make out a single word. “Inside,” Hill orders, planting a hand on Tony’s chest to push him back into his house. They enter quickly and slam and lock the door behind them.
“Mind if I steal your bride for a moment?” Steve asks just as the music transitions back to something a little slower and thankfully more manageable for Steve to attempt to dance to than the upbeat song playing before.
The room is quiet, Tony wondering if he can get away with just making a dash for the exit while Janet is giving him the silent treatment. He eventually turns to look back at her, the woman looking exhausted as she stares out the window, Pierce’s little slip of paper clenched in one of her hands.
"Tony Stark, yeah," Tony answers with a sigh, throwing Steve a ‘
Steve comes back to consciousness with a slight jolt, feeling a hand remove itself from his shoulder as he finally gets up. He wipes a hand down his face, straightening up from where he had slumped down in the seat. Tony is standing in the aisle next to him with his backpack hanging off one shoulder. He’s got Steve’s duffel in one hand, tossing it unceremoniously onto his lap. “Come on, slow poke, this is the end of the line.”
“Ball two!”
Tony stares down at the folder, mouth hanging open, unable to look up at Hill and Coulson standing in the center of his living room with crossed arms. Coulson picks up a remote to turn on the TV, flipping through the news and sports channels.
Tony doesn’t risk turning on the TV until he knows the game is over. He raids the fridge and settles on a fifth of Bourbon to drink from while he proofreads the eighth draft of his thesis he's been working on, marking it up with a red pen while he scans the pages. His cell phone rings a few times, but Tony ignores it.
, he doesn’t. Steve would be walking around with him looking like one of his college professors, and not even the hot Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones kind, even if Steve had the best chance out of anyone to try and pull that off.
Luckily, he doesn’t have the displeasure of running into Hammer at the hotel or the stadium when they arrive for their second and last day of practice. This time they run through a couple of scrimmages, splitting the team in half so everyone gets their opportunity at both offensive and defensive positions. He and Bender trade off, Tony analyzing his pitching style while he waits on the sidelines. He’s not as precise as Tony, but he’s definitely got the skill and strategy that will make for a strong opener for the team and someone Tony isn’t embarrassed to call his partner in this. Really, sharing the mound with a blind, one-armed monkey would still be a step-up from sharing it with Hammer.
"Can we talk about—"
” Janet calls out to him. “Stop.”
That particular dilemma is pushed off as Tony slides out of reach, dropping to his knees on the floor. He grabs Steve by the back of the calves and drags him forward slightly, nudging his legs open so he can reach up and undo his pants. Steve lifts his hips up, helping Tony slide them off along with his underwear. The relief of no longer being constricted and not having to worry about coming in his pants like a teenager intermingles with the sudden realization that he’s fully exposed in front of Tony.
“It’s, um…” Steve glances over towards Tony who’s cracking open his crab legs with his bare hands, a couple of small shell chunks scattering across the table. He seals his lips around the edge of the leg meat with a fervor, expertly slurping it out in one piece like he’s done it a million times. Steve is still fumbling with all the special silverware that came out with the meal, which was completely disregarded by the twenty-year old sitting next to him. “...A challenge. But challenges are rewarding after all.”
A deep sigh escapes Tony as his chin tips back down towards the ground. "That's what I was worried about." His eyes meet Steve's—god, is he pouting? "Dinner's this Saturday, after the first game. The house is in Malibu, so it's a bit of a drive, but—" Tony lets out another exaggerated sigh, his teeth grinding together as he gets the next part out. "We'd love to have your company."
Tony wanders closer, sitting on the edge of Steve’s bed to stare curiously at a monologuing Kirk Douglas. “I’ve read the novel. And a couple of biographies. You know the famous ‘I’m Spartacus’ moment was never actually documented by historians? Fast made it up for his version.”
The ice clinks softly in Howard’s glass as they walk, a melodic chime accompanying them as they round another corner. Howard opens a set of sliding wooden doors, gesturing for Steve to enter. “Wow,” he can’t help but breathe out as he walks in, taking in the room.
Tony frowns and sips at it. He’s not sure if Steve told him his usual order, or if the kid is as obsessed as everyone teases him about, but it’s exactly how he likes it. “Go tell him I said to get his ass in here. Drag him by the collar if you have to, I don’t care.”
"What's up with the delay, Rogers?" Tony calls, tossing his ball into his glove repeatedly. "Gonna go powder your nose first?"
Tony visibly recoils at the idea. “New York is our home. We’re not going anywhere.”
Thank you thank you thank you thank you to everyone who's left such kind comments and reviews after this last chapter was posted. It took a little additional time to get the "official" ending out here, but I finally did it. Truth be told, it was almost finished a month ago....... and then Endgame happened. (No spoilers, but I can say to stay tuned for a fix it fic or two inspired from that movie lol).
"There's a lot of controversy around your approach to the game, Mr. Stark.”
Steve looks around the apartment as leaves his shoes by the door and follows Tony into the den. There are no decorations up, no indication that it’s the holiday season at all. Tony’s apartment feels dark and cold until they reach the living space where there is a warm glow provided by the fireplace, as well as some lights turned on behind the bar.
Steve's in awe as Tony uses a long blade along the edge of the table to cut a huge square of his material out, then climbs up on top of the table to lay out the blueprint on some kind of lightboard that hung over the table. He hit a switch and a projection of his blueprint appeared on the material below it. Tony jumps back down onto the ground, taking a bite of his sandwich. "Ay'shur crmnr," he explains around a mouthful of ham and cheese as he pulls out his ruler to make sure his measurements are correct.
As the game starts, he does feel a pang of sadness seeing someone else on that pitcher's mound. Harrington is the second best choice on the all-star team, and he proves that in the first inning. His ace pitching combined with the Pacific Coast team's impressive outfielders ensures no runs for the International League. Tony barely gets any handling on the ball, and was itching for some action. Unfortunately for him, he's low on the batting rotation because of his position as shortstop. When it's their team's turn to take to the plate, they manage to get one run before three outs are called. There's still two more players ahead of Tony for the batting rotation, so he'll have to wait until the next inning before he has the chance to swing.
“Nope,” Tony denies. “I’m not walking away from you anymore, Steve.”
He sighs, picking at the frayed sleeve edges of Steve’s oversized sweater he’s taken to sleeping in on particularly lonely nights— which is steadily becoming most of them. “Nothing in particular, I guess. It’s just the same as every other day. Practice is no fun, no one talks to me during the breaks, all the other pitchers hate me, and I miss all of you guys.”
Bucky presses his lips together and shrugs. "No change," he answers, all-too casually.
Tony’s smirks, not looking up from his papers. “By George, I think she’s got it.”
If the game continues like this, Tony is going to be stuck here with Rogers for the rest of the inning. He shakes his head and scans the field again, eyes jumping from player to player, settling the longest on the pitcher. He spreads his legs a bit further apart and begins to scoot his way closer to the second base, reluctantly letting his eyes move back to Rogers in his periphery. He notices Steve punch the palm of his glove three times. Now, this wouldn’t normally strike him as odd if he hadn’t done it so
Tony gapes at him, uncertain of how to reply to the speech he’s just been given. It sort of reminds him of Steve’s heart-to-hearts between innings, and maybe this is where he gets it from. Tony stares out the window, pupils dilating and expanding rapidly with each spaced out street light they whiz past.
Whitaker shrugs at him. “You asking me to fold on a winning hand, Stark?”
“Of course not,” Steve finds his coat hanging on the back of a chair and reads off the address of their farm.
“Yeah, well I certainly don’t make it easy on them now do I?” Tony responds easily, unwilling to give Hammer any sort of satisfaction. At this point, the rest of the group seems to be humoring him as well.
“Were you? Or are you mistaking genuine worry for guilt that you feel the same way about me as the scumbags who thought they could beat the gay out of me?”
Steve nods, pressing his lips together. “Thank you, Maria. I promise I’ll do my best. Tony’s a good kid, I at least know that much.”
but his mouth is too interested in doing other things than voice any reasons to stop right now. His arms wrap easily around Tony’s waist, hands running up his back and pulling him closer. He sinks back into the couch thinking that Tony’s right and it
“Me,” Steve answers immediately, taking Tony by surprise. He straightens up out of the huddle. “Listen to Stark, he knows what he’s talking about here. We can do this guys.”
"New gear is one thing, but this kid openly trashes the hard work and effort these athletes pour into the game," The newscaster looks into the camera now. "Just a refresher, this was the statement Tony Stark made after last season."
Steve swallows thickly, backing himself against the wall. "No. Whether you are or aren’t, it doesn’t matter to me and it— it's none of my business."
"Aren't you drunk still?"
Tony turns his impatient gaze on him, hands on his hips. “Tools. Have any? Like, a screw diver? Tweasers? A cotton swab? A pencil? Rubber band? Literally anything?”
"It's kinda my thing," he croaks wryly.
Tony shrugs, his mouth curled in disgust quickly morphing into a grin. “If it does pass we could drive down there. Carol could marry us. Ha! Imagine that. Two gay men getting married by a lesbian. I’d do it for the big middle finger alone. We could get custom-made rainbow tuxes and burn bibles instead of saying vows. Elton John can play the bridal march as we walk down the aisle.”
They run out from behind their fort, round plastic sled raised up in front of Steve to block the snowballs as the children behind them let out their battle cries. The children on Team Tony immediately start screaming as well, furiously chucking snowballs with no avail. The makeshift shield blocks every last one, Steve charging forward until the kids are forced to scatter as he goes crashing into the fort.
They wait outside of the team buses, having a little alone time for Steve to cool down and finally let himself ride the high of his incredible last home run. Peggy's going to chew him out for not being around for press, but he's sure she'll shove him in front of every camera at every opportunity once things have calmed down.
Feet of snow are piled up outside, completely covering cars on the street, windswept up against the fronts of buildings and storefronts. The past few days have been without precipitation, but the temperature has still been far below freezing, leaving the snow to settle into perfect packing snow for a winter’s day like this. The blanket of gray clouds in the sky has cleared up this morning, the sun shining brightly down to make the snow sparkle. Tony’s right, the city will probably have trucks out later today to start clearing the snow away, especially if it gets warm enough to naturally melt some of it away. By tomorrow, the roads will probably be clear enough for Bucky to make his way down for some New Years Day designated best friend time.
Bucky has always had these plans of grandeur, ever since they were kids. Telling Steve how they were going to tackle the world, Bucky either becoming an important astronaut, lawyer, detective, doctor, cowboy, all those things and more. In every fantasy, all Steve wants to do is to make art and play baseball. He doesn’t need to be some sort of super hero.
Silence hangs in the air for a few moments as the two lean against the brick wall of the bar, Peggy's hands in the pockets of her blazer. Steve has no idea how to initiate conversation, but luckily his manager takes the reins before he can fumble out any awkward small talk.
“This is dinner, not a fucking interview,” Tony grumbles under his breath, taking another swig from his wine glass.
picture perfect. They house was nothing special at first, but the architectural structures were genuine and had character, enough that Steve knew it was the one right away. Tony only had minor renovations in mind, all of which have been completed within the last three years of them owning the home.
“Did you already turn them down?”
So yes, there is still more I want to do within this verse, so don't be surprised if I turn this into a Series in the near future! This is my first official fic I've ever posted anywhere, and I have a ton more Marvel fics up my sleeve that I no longer feel too nervous to post now that I've gotten this monster fic out of my system. The reception has been amazing, and I appreciate every kudos, share, and comment. They mean the world to me and I never would've been motivated to finish this fic, and I'm excited to write more for y'all. Check my bio for links to find me yelling about fandom things elsewhere, if that tickles your fancy at all. <3
“Steve, stop,” Tony sighs, reaching out before thinking better of it. Steve drops his hand away from the door handle, turning to face Tony with arms defensively crossed over his chest. “I’m not signed; Janet wouldn’t do that to you. I wanted to ask you first.”
of our careers— our
“Do you even hear yourself right now?!”
Steve swallows. She’s right, he does know that. Janet doesn’t waste anyone’s time, especially her own. “I’ll… I’ll think about it.”
She shakes her head mournfully, digging out a tissue to quickly wipe at her watering eyes. “I was so worried something like this would happen,” she whispered, lower lip trembling.
No one joins Steve in the elevator with any sort of explanation. It starts descending down to the lobby, a few people getting in along the way. Just when it empties out at the bottom floor, a group of Steve's teammates get on board.
Tony shrugs one shoulder, popping a cigarette out of the box and placing it carefully between his lips. “Don’t I always?”
“No, you’re not
He starts with a screwball just to get a good eye on the trajectory of his swing, then pitches a circle changeup just for research purposes. Two strikes, and what would be an easy out, which is what Tony’s counting on Hammer also thinking. He doesn’t expect the ball to go anywhere.
“Steve…” Tony warns.
Tony draws a finger through the condensation on his third bottle. “No. Well, I guess that’s not true. Pepper knows, but she knows everything about my life. It’s kind of impossible for her not to,” he shrugs. “We don’t talk about it. She’s not my assistant anymore now that I’m in New York, but she’s still the head of my PR department. If it comes up in conversation, she just makes it very clear that it’s something I’m meant to keep—” Tony swallows thickly. “
Steve shrugs. "I guess I can understand where you were coming from." Tony's points at dinner, as harsh and vulgar as they were, weren't completely unwarranted. Taking it out on Steve wasn't exactly fair either.
Once all the individual positions finish their focused trainings, Tony and Bender switch off to throw pitches for batting practice. The team’s pitchers are replaced with designated hitters for the All-Star Game, so Tony isn’t going to see any base action this game. That’s alright with him for once, all of his focus solely dedicated to pitching. Rezzo blows the whistle at him twice after completely striking out a handful of his teammates, the man reminding him that he can throw good pitches while still giving the opportunity for the batters to hit it. Tony thinks this is a little counterproductive, since he should be trying to challenge his teammates as much as possible so they’re prepared to hit any kind of pitch thrown their way, but he takes Rezzo’s direction and reformulates his strategy to allow the batters a
Tony pitches left-handed for the final inning, doing his best to keep the ball away from Steve’s position. He knows what a pipe dream that is. The entire basis of shortstop is that it’s the toughest defensive position with the most labor intensive movements. Plenty of pivoting which was bad for Steve’s knee, but the man prevails. Tony does his best not to lose his focus now, but whenever he has a spare millisecond to turn around and look at Steve, he does, just to make sure he’s not showing any sign of struggle.
, but neither her nor my folks are particularly religious, so we kind of forgo that title. I guess her and Howard go way back or something; She’s been around since I was a baby. I don’t have much in the way of family on either of my parents’ sides, so I’ve always thought of her as my Aunt,” he shrugs.
Dressing simply in jeans and a t-shirt, Steve digs around in the back of their closet for his special jersey for today’s occasion and then fastens on his knee brace. On his way out of the bedroom he can see a few stray bolts and screws abandoned on the floor, scooping them into his hand so he can drop the orphaned bits off in the studio before he leaves.
“I was thinking Just-You-and-Me thing, but we can invite the others along too if you want.”
He doesn’t cry like he expected, but he does get a little choked up towards the end. Blinking a bit to clear his blurry vision, Tony gets to his feet and wipes his nose off on his sleeve before he turns back to Steve. “Happy now?”
Yankee Stadium is swarmed by the time Steve arrives, both with fans tailgating in the parking lot before the start of the game, as well as media conducting interviews with fans and players alike. He debates putting on the jersey for his walk through the parking lot, trying to decide whether it would help him blend in or just stand out
“You dodged the question,” Steve accuses. “Why are you here? I’m assuming you didn’t come all this way to tell me something I announced publicly six months ago.”
, Tony thinks as he lies on top of his covers next to Steve, both of them on their backs and covered in sweat. Their labored panting fills the room as they come down from what must’ve been the third round of marathon sex. Tony is sore and aching in all the right places, knowing it’s going to affect his pitching tomorrow but not even caring. Really, this has just been a little extra stamina conditioning in before the game. Carol should
“Didn’t need you to tell me,” Tony scoffs, as if he’s totally offended by the idea. He gets to his feet, wiping his hands off on his jeans. “I also installed the rewinder right into the machine so you don’t need this anymore,” he kicks the now gutted leftovers of his separate machine. “You’ll just use this new little button on the end.”
But he’s the captain. And he has to try. Tony’s not exactly avoiding him, but he seems to not drift too closely to any of the other players. The team must feel the same, none of them engaging Tony more than necessary. Apparently Steve isn’t the only one with reservations. It seems like the only player Tony is actually seen interacting with beyond a casual hello in passing is Rhodes. In most of their warm up games, Rhodes takes his position as second baseman, directly behind Tony on the mound. He was like an intimidating shadow to the pitcher when looking down the middle of the diamond.
These thoughts of Tony keep him up most of the night. If only this was a one-time occurrence in Steve Rogers’ life.
“I won’t listen to anymore slander out of that mouth!” Howard points angrily at his son, a vein bulging on his temple. “You don’t even know how lucky you are to be playing underneath such a stand-up player, let alone sitting next to him at dinner right now. You could learn a few things from this man, but instead you choose to misbehave, complain, and make your snide little comments under your breath like a
The cold post-practice shower is satisfying, but not quite the level of distraction Steve needs right now. He moves so slowly that by the time he's finished with his shower, there is no laughter or sounds echoing throughout the locker room. Everyone’s already packed up and gone home, probably excited for their day off tomorrow.
“Yes!” Tony pumps his fist as Steve jogs to first which allows Nancy to advance to second. He can see Hammer’s ugly tomato-colored face from here, his beady eyes meeting Tony’s as he strides forward, spinning his bat in quick circles over his wrist. Tony flashes a shit-eating grin, winking at the man who knows he’s getting beat at his own game.
Tony almost leaves it at that, one last disrespectful monologue to give his old man the finger before he goes off to seal his former team’s fate. His eyes fall upon Maria’s tombstone. Tony crouches down, reaching out to run his fingers along the soft petals of a few white roses that have been left there. A few petals crumble and fall off the flower from his delicate touch, the integrity of the blossoms compromised from the few days sitting out in the stale weather. He lowers his voice so Steve won’t hear, needing this moment to stay between him and Maria. “I lost myself for a little while there, Mom. I started doing what I thought would make people happy and forgot everything you taught me. I’m still figuring out the kind of person I am, and the person I’m trying to be. You aren’t around to help me figure that out anymore, but I… I think I’ve found some good people who
“That I do. Have a good night, Steve.”
“Why?” Tony interrupts, still glaring away from him. “What we have is a good thing, I don’t see why we need to ruin it.”
Steve eventually has to be the one to call it a night, coaxing Tony out of his chair and into their bedroom. The younger man still clutches at one of the folders, muttering something about win ratios as Steve guides him to bed.
“What happened?” Peggy asks behind her hand, mouth covered in horror as she looks at her broken nephew lying before her.
Everyone dutifully files out of the room, not even bothering to bid Tony and Steve a goodnight lest they incur their manager’s wrath. “And you two get some rest as well. I’m going to try and pull both of you out of tomorrow’s press conference, but be prepared anyway.” Janet fixes one last glare on Tony that clearly says ‘
“I just don’t think anyone should walk around alone, no matter how far,” Steve answers earnestly. “I was actually thinking about walking myself since I’m not too far from here. Whereabouts are you?”
“I stayed because I’m a sucker for nostalgia and I had nothing better to do,” Tony denies, it ringing so clearly false even to his own ears. “Besides, I couldn’t just come back and win
Tony nods stiffly and Steve can see the telltale twitch of his brow and mouth that he’s fighting back tears. “Fuck,” Tony sighs in exasperation, tilting his head back and blinking furiously at the ceiling. “This is what I mean. The most random things will just… I don’t know. Hit me. And then I start bawling like a damn baby,” he wipes quickly at his eyes, ridding himself of the tears gathering threateningly at the corners. “Didn’t shed a tear until I got back to California and Peggy came to the house to help me get everything in order. As soon as she walked in and hugged me I was done for,” he laughs weakly.
been pretty lonely these past couple months without you…”
Now dressed, he sets out on the insurmountable task of looking for Tony in the massive penthouse. As he exits the room, the rest of the apartment is dim, curtains still drawn in the main rooms with a few lamps turned on here and there. After enough aimless wandering, he can hear the sound of a steady bass line coming from somewhere above. He finds a spiral staircase in a tucked away den near the back of an apartment, ascending upwards closer to the sounds of guitar riffs and stadium-sized vocals.
Not exactly much to be chatty about.
Those words don’t make sense. “Very funny.”
Short stop is one of the most demanding defensive positions, so Tony knows he has his work cut out for him. This is the ultimate opportunity to show off the range of his skillset. He doesn't mind being pigeon-holed as a pitcher, he's phenomenal at it after all. The only times he normally got the opportunity to leave the mound was for the friendlies, and there was still only a 50% chance Obadiah would let him try out a different position. This game is going to be huge in terms of showing Tony's versatility with his scientific method, and that it didn't just apply to throwing the perfect pitch.
“Anytime, brat,” she laughs fondly into his ear. Suddenly she tears away from him, running out of the group as Clint and Pietro break through the crowd with a water cooler hoisted over their shoulders. No one else joins them in their dubious pursuit, Natasha screaming at them that she’ll have them running suicides until their legs fall off if they get anywhere near her with that. Tony laughs as they streak around the field, Natasha much faster and more nimble than the two hauling around the container, spilling more on themselves than their coach in the attempt to douse her.
“You’re acting like a child!” Steve bellows, hands now clenched into fists on top of the table. He pushes his chair back slightly but makes no move to stand.
Steve expects the usual response, Tony preening from the praise, saying
He can see the white of Tony’s teeth as he grins at him. “But fucking you in a broom closet sounds so much more appealing.”
“Stark is a wasted player to me if I only let him do one thing. I want to move Tony around during the exhibitions and see how far I can push his potential. It’s also a test for his patience. I want to see if he’ll still perform at his best even if he’s not getting his way,” She crosses her arms, Steve practically shrinking under her hard gaze. “I know what I’m doing, Steve. I told you to let me worry about Stark, so don’t question me again on this again, understand?”
don’t even know— but you’re here now. And I don’t think you plan on going anywhere next season,” he smiles with feigned smugness. “In fact, I’ll bet right now that you’re still here after December signings. And if you are, you have to get an apartment. A
Tony’s mood improves significantly once they step into the Avengers’ private box, familiar, less hostile faces greeting him. Only about a third of the team have come out, most of the others utilizing their couple days of break to spend time with their families or just have a relaxing weekend to themselves. Rhodes immediately surges out of the group to capture him in a warm hug.
Steve has no time to linger on how despite being
Steve hums. “Kind of sounds like an excuse to cover up that you drink too much booze and caffeine at all hours of the day and night so your circadian rhythm is out of whack and you just need to lay down for nap time.”
“Happy birthday!” Comes the excited chorus from their teammates as they all rush forward to hug Tony in a greeting. Steve steps back, laughing as Tony almost topples to the ground from all the forceful love, even though he really should be used to their team’s tendency to tackle to show their love at this point.
“What did Nat say?”
Steve is grateful that Tony is the one he’s discovering this aspect of his sexuality with. He’s kind and patient even as Steve awkwardly tries to fumble his way through figuring out what works best for both of them. They take things slow, Tony insisting Steve just sit back and relax while he
