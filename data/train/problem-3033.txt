“You don’t want more water before taking care of that,” Dean pointed out, using the humour to ease his way past Cas in the doorway on a laugh, so that it wouldn’t be too intense.
“She’s not still all
Dean’s face was a mess, a confusion. He looked as though he were trying to look light and uncaring, but the fact that he was feeling something heavy was writ large across his face, undeniable.
“Yup,” Charlie said. “And don’t think I didn’t spot your Lord of the Rings back there, either.”
"So what are you doing?"
“I need the hat,” he says. “To keep the sun off my neck.”
“I know. But this is important.”
When he’d cleaned out the tub and de-scaled the shower head, he settled himself down on his sofa and put on Netflix. And he felt – he felt good, he realised. He felt full and his meal, while it hadn’t been entirely healthy, had been delicious. And he was clean, and his home felt nice and cosy with everything put away in its right place. His bedroom was still a mess, and there was more to do in the kitchen – the fridge needed cleaning out – but it was something.
“I said,” he heard Sam bellow, “are you still coming over for Christmas?”
“Shut the hell up,” he said out loud. “C’mon. Play fucking nice.”
It’s still not Heaven. It’s not even close. But – Castiel pulls back, and sees the expression on Dean’s face, the way his eyes are wide and unbelieving and so, so happy. But it’s a place, where Castiel is growing things.
deep voice.
happen, because Castiel was just an ordinary person. And Dean was the Prince of an entire country. If Dean had ever had any feelings for Castiel – which he clearly hadn’t, because for years Dean had always told him everything and never said a word about it – but if he
“I was,” Castiel said. “I am.”
“I don’t think so.”
“Do you live nearby? Could I – I don’t know – see you again?”
When Dean felt Castiel watching, he glanced up.
“I am,” Castiel said blankly. “You’re… surely, I don’t have to explain it.”
“What did you say?”
“And I don’t think you’re gonna lose Sam,” said Charlie, and from her tone of voice Dean could hear how carefully she was choosing her words. “I really don’t. He’s your brother. I know there’s been ups and downs between you two but I’ve met him those couple of times and he was super nice, and he knew I was gay.”
And sure enough, just as Castiel was expecting, the colour drained from Dean’s face as he read.
“Fired me,” Castiel said.
Outside the closet, a shuddering rattle. And then a footstep, but further from the door, and then another. The thing – whatever it was – moved back six paces, and then its steps changed. Castiel heard them go hollow, still receding.
“No shit!” Dean said, grinning. “You know Charlie?”
“Jody, Dean swore,” Castiel heard Claire say immediately, and he heard Jody take a breath in to speak, and then quite suddenly fall quiet – because there on the front porch of Saint Crispin’s in the early afternoon light, Dean was getting down on one knee.
right. All wrong.
“You, uh - you take care, Dean.”
“But you want…?”
“Are you alright?” Cas asked, looking concerned.
. What did that even mean? Was Cas ever particularly glad when Dean asked anything?
Mary walked towards them. There was something definitely off-balance about her, though she moved with her usual grace – some uncertainty in her step. Her eyes moved from her eldest son to Castiel and back again.
Dean said nothing, for a long time.
“I mean… I get it. Only takes one time hearing the wrong thing and you're always watching your back afterward, waiting for it to happen again.” He shrugged his shoulders, feeling big and clumsy and awkward. “If it helps, I think it’s bullshit that anyone ever treated you badly. It’s bullshit that they did it at all and it’s bullshit that they did it over you being asexual.”
Dean put the mixed milkshake into the cupholder in the arm of his seat. Standing up, he patted his pockets automatically to check he had all his things, and looked back to the pair of seats where they’d been sitting together just a few moments before. He couldn’t connect to the fact that he was here, and not right there with Castiel anymore. It felt silly and nightmarish. The empty seats and the sad milkshake and the wallet on the floor.
Castiel understood. Dean was calling the name he’d given him.
“It’s fine,” Castiel said, the words out of his mouth too soon and too forceful, almost angry. “Nothing’s even really changing. We’re still going to be friends.”
The silence, this time, was significantly more protracted. For a few seconds, Castiel thought that Dean was actually gone, or that maybe the line had gone dead. Instead, after an incredibly pregnant pause, Dean said in his normal voice,
Had Cas already watched the video?
other: best friends. Close, understanding each other in a way that not many others did - they’d come out to each other first in college - but in a way that was not and had never been even slightly romantic. They were easy around each other. It had always felt natural.
Dean leaned back, just far enough to be able to look into Cas’ eyes. They looked at each other, stared,
“Well, I, uh…”
“I just wanted to help. That’s why I found Samandriel.”
“Well,” he said, sounding embarrassed. “It’s… that much is fairly obvious, isn’t it?”
“We need a story,” Dean said. “About what happened in there.”
And so Dean kicked them back underneath as hard as he could, and smiled at Cassie, and held out his hand.
“Dean…”
Castiel reached into his own pocket, and pulled out his own ring. He held it up in front of Dean – and for a second, he was back in the hotel in Las Vegas, just the two of them in the room, holding their rings up to each other and realising what they’d done.
at him - for the first time. He appeared to consider for a half-second, and then Dean noticed a smile at the corners of the guy’s mouth.
“Awesome. Can I get your name?” The woman lifted up a clipboard expectantly.
“He’s just… you know, when I asked him to the movie, he wasn’t even my first choice. I asked a bunch of other people first. I thought he was just this dorky guy.” Dean thought back to Castiel rolling up his sleeves, Castiel meeting his eyes directly when they spoke. “He’s, uh. He’s not. Those things. He’s, like, the person everyone else on campus probably would’ve asked first, turns out.”
, though, their Paris pics had been subject to their friends’ wink emojis and innuendos. Jo’s mother had even called to ask if they were getting married. There were only so many times that they could reply to insist that the
“Sir,” said the woman in the realtors’ office on the end of the line, “you don’t own the whole forest. There’s no way to stop them logging. They’ve obviously bought the land and they’re free to do whatever they want with it.”
“You mean…” Castiel’s eyes were suddenly wide. “You mean that you…”
thumb to wipe it off, and then decided every option was a bad option and it would be better to leave it.
Castiel gave him a look, and Dean held up his hands.
Dean nodded.
Beside her was sitting someone Castiel didn’t know, though her face sparked recognition. She was young, no more than Dean or Castiel’s age, and she had rich dark hair and dark eyes to match. She looked nervous, Castiel thought, but she smiled when Dean, Charlie, and Castiel came in, and stood up from her seat.
She had pulled away, just a little, in her confusion. Her hand pressing on Castiel’s chest wasn’t so hard.
They were looking at each other again, each trying to read the other’s expression, and Dean seemed as though he was willing Castiel to be able to hear his thoughts without him having to say them at all. As well as they knew each other, Castiel couldn’t do that.
“Well,” Castiel said, “I don’t think you are, either.”
“Castiel,” Dean said. “Castiel Novak?”
Of course he was.
lights, clearly flashing on setting number two.
Over Sam’s shoulder, Castiel saw the moment utter relief flooded Dean’s face, and then watched him say,
“Did you find out what she wanted?” Dean asked.
He could just ignore that, never even try to say anything. But why? It was how he felt. It wasn’t ridiculous, was it? Or maybe some people would think it was, but Dean didn’t have to be one of them. He could feel how he felt without cringing at himself. Fuck, he just could do that. He didn’t have to get in ahead of every laugh and pointing finger. One-upping them by doing all their work himself was a pretty shit victory anyway.
Dean opened his eyes. He thought for a second he might literally see stars.
“What?” he demanded, of an empty bathroom. He took a second to look around it, confused – and then the knocking came again but from his left, and he saw another door. The one to the outside world, rather than the bathroom. Castiel gritted his teeth, reached out for the golden swirled metal handle, and swung it open.
Focus. Dean needed to focus.
“If they’re not ace,” Dean said shortly, “they’re not Cas. Thanks but no thanks.”
said the voice again.
The air was a metallic yellow, light from sol-panels in the building's walls illuminating the many bridges that linked different buildings and open plazas in the Mid. The sun was going down, breathing a tinge of orange-red over what Dean could see of the sky between the buildings. The glow of Heaven, its moving banners calling for respect, was visible as a beautifully vicious talon clawing ever upwards above the rest of the city.
“Hello, yes. I’m contacting you from His Royal Highness Prince Dean’s Public Relations team. I’d like to enquire after some photographs taken today, of the Prince and his friend inside the house…”
That was the last of them. Dean set down his laptop carefully on the end of the sofa. He could feel that his cheeks were bright red. His heart was racing. He was too – it was too much for him to be able to smile, or text Charlie, or even move.
“But,” Castiel said, “it feels like a good kind of not knowing.”
“I think so.” Donna’s eyes were twinkling, almost as if she knew what was going on - but she couldn’t, Dean thought. She couldn’t know about him and Cas. Even if they all thought he, Dean, was a total fraud, there was no way that anyone could know he was a fraud who’d come to try to ask another person at the auditions for his number. They’d only be able to guess at him being a regular, generic, non-number-seeking kind of fraud.
Dean was frowning slightly, watching Castiel’s face. Castiel wondered how clearly his own feelings were written across it.
“You don’t think it’s bullshit to have to hide who you are?”
“Okay, hold on, Mr Optimistic,” Charlie said. “How would you even know what’s gonna last and what’s not? Who are you, Shawn Spencer? Actually, maybe, because literally that guy’s whole thing is that he says he’s psychic and he’s not. And neither are you. You don’t know what’s going on in Castiel’s mind, do you?”
Castiel clenched his eyes tight shut again, and dug his fingertips into his palm. The pain of his bruised fist eased the hot, pleasant sensation that began to course through him when he watched Dean for too long.
“Listen,” Cas said, “there’s an audition tomorrow. Singing. I have to be there… maybe you can go too? You have an amazing voice.”
He offered them a half-hearted wave and kept walking. He could feel himself starting to panic. Why had he thought coming here was a good idea? He could see the glowing green light of the fire exit right in front of him, and hated himself for turning right and walking away from it and heading into the corridor that led backstage. He hated the way he hoped Cas might also be in makeup, since he hadn’t been sitting at the front with the others. He hated the whole stupid mess that he was in, right now.
“I…” Castiel said, and then stopped. Because fluttering up to him, making its way through the trees on soft, tiny wings, was a butterfly.
It did mean that he had to change in the elevator. No one could see him, even though he could see out - the elevators had one-way glass, or at least the ones that went all the way to the Up certainly did. No, no one could see him - but it wasn’t so much the issue of privacy as just the odd feeling of undressing somewhere outside his own rooms.
No… no. He couldn’t have read that right. He blinked, and tried it again.
There’s Dean, he thinks. There he is. Sometimes the feelings in Castiel grow so big and overwhelming that he forgets the shape of the man at the heart of them. The way Dean cares. The way Dean looks at him right back, matches him – when it comes down to it, never pretends it doesn’t matter to him when it does.
Dean was starting to glower, but he tried to keep his cool.
“Don’t do it,” John repeated, more forcefully.
Dean swallowed, and looked down at the floor.
“I mean…” Cas put his hand against one of the bare walls, flat against its surface. “I mean… I don’t know what I mean. I’m sorry if that was rude. It really is very nice.”
“When she’s paying attention, there’s no one better than Charlie to have in your corner. She just... doesn’t always see it.”
Not that it mattered. Not that they could do anything about it, even if it had been. And it was probably just another one of those moments that Castiel read too much into, anyway. But still, the way that Dean had looked at him –
The answer was, Castiel was surprised to find, yes.
“Remember when we used to hang out?” Sam said, his voice still wound up tight.
Dean thought.
“Awesome.”
The hustle onto the plane was a blur, diplomatic seals and documents granting them a queue-less path through. Castiel dragged his suitcase, trying to hold up his end of a conversation with Garth and doing a bad job at it. He kept looking over at Dean, trying to figure out a way to speak to him alone, even if it was only for a few minutes.
“OK. Well. First. Did you talk to Cas about him getting mad?” Charlie asked quietly.
But he
The words came as naturally as the challenging expression on his face. It would have been such a typical thing to do, not so long ago. To stare at Dean like this.
Castiel opened his eyes. The pain didn’t lessen.
“Mmm. Okay. But it’s definitely better at the place at the mall,” Dean said.
it. That felt so good, too good to be allowed - he should hate his own performance - but Cas would like that he liked it, Dean thought, and Charlie would like that he liked it. It was okay to like it.
over. And if you want to argue otherwise, feel free. Just remember who you’re dealing with.”
Castiel didn’t say anything.
“Are you sure you could look as though you were attracted to me?” the man said seriously - not as though he doubted his own attractiveness, and more in the t
“I didn’t say anything,” Cas said, in a tone that was either so dry that it sounded sincere, or simply sincere.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH. what is going ONNNNNNNNNNNNN. I mean I know what's going on but what is going ONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN. you know? Anyway, apologies for the slightly late update - I could only start really working on it today because life really be like that sometimes. Every time I type out one of these end notes I always think, hey, but this week that's coming is gonna be way more chill, and then I live it and I'm like, well then. WELL THEN. So this time I'm going to outwit the universe by expecting a terrible no-good very-bad week and seeing what happens. I'm clearly going to now lose all my socks and get dunked on by a pro wrestler who mistook me for their worst enemy or something else worse than I could ever expect. If that happens, next update may be late as I limp around buying socks.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had to get out. He had to go. But how? Where?
Castiel couldn’t find words. The emotion in him was too big, too much. He wanted to cry, or laugh, or – he looked at Dean, and something in him shifted to the front. A feeling that he’d pushed away for so long, battled back. A sudden breath-thieving wanting.
“I’m ready,” Dean said, and went to stand by his microphone, wrapping his hand around it.
“I’m sorry I said that,” he said. “I meant it as a joke but it was a real bad one. It’s not true. You just listened to me talk for forever. Case in point.”
When they halted to take a breather, it was by common consent, both slowing down and putting their hands on their knees to breathe.
Castiel looked over at him. Dean swallowed, and seemed to be grappling for words.
For once, then, Dean wasn’t worried about opening up to someone. It felt giddy and strange and terrifying and somehow incredibly safe, all at the same time. It was so
“Was that nice?”
Dean could yell at him, right now. He could ask him what had happened. He could demand to know if there had ever been a time when Castiel had wondered if there was something going on between them.
“Stay,” Castiel said, standing up.
Instead, having to say,
Castiel kept looking at Dean.
“Right…” Dean grinned as though at a joke, trying to diffuse the moment. “Sure."
He wouldn’t win. There was no goddamn way he would win. He sang in the shower and at a gay bar’s cheap karaoke night and that was it. The person who won was going to be semi-pro already, Dean was sure of it.
“Or maybe she’d choose not to,” Castiel said. “Maybe she wants something. Maybe if we can get her what she wants… like ghosts, they have unfinished business. Maybe we need to help her finish something here, so that she can move on.”
“And a kitchen island,” Dean blurted out. Charlie and Castiel both stopped talking. Charlie rolled her eyes, while Castiel’s mouth flicked upward in a smile.
“Jesus. Okay. Where is it then?”
Dean tapped on the screen of his phone for a few seconds, holding it a little further away from his eyes than he used to have to do. He read over what he’d typed once, and then hit send.
“Don’t you need to get to class?” Charlie said. “Unless you wanna keep going.”
“Was he surprised?”
“Let’s go,” he said.
“Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, Sunday.”
The answer to all of it is yes. It’s Dean, after all. The answer is yes.
“No, I’m grateful.” Castiel poured boiling water out of the pot he’d used to heat it up in, and into two mugs with ground coffee in the bottom – and then went still. “Oh, no.”
“That’s… yeah.”
“I’ll go to a hospital,” she said, pulling a face at the idea of going to an Underlight med-bay. Dean raised an eyebrow. So, he’d been right. This person had to be from the Up if she could afford a hospital. “Thank you for your help.” She got to her feet, wobbling on those ridiculous shoes.
“So,” Dean said. “Robotics. The study of how to make a thing… into more than just a thing. Well, it’s still a thing. But it’s, like, a
Dean’s managed a tight smile.
“Hey, Dean, you taking off?”
Castiel glanced towards him, and smiled. His every nerve was straining. He didn’t know how much longer he could keep going, but he forced himself to appear calm and unruffled. There was no other way that he was going to convince Anna and the logging company to leave. He hoped that his legs trembling wasn't visible.
Cas was glad he’d asked about what?
He turned away, and closed his eyes. He felt his chest constricting, his fingers tingling with pins and needles. He’d said yes. He’d said
“Hush,” said Jody.
“‘A nerd like him’? Whoa. Look at that stone, flying through your glass walls.”
“Oh, god,” he said. “Cas.”
The kitchen went silent, except for the tinny innocent sound of Castiel’s phone playing a song he didn’t know.
“I know. I get that, it’s just…” Dean trailed off. “I know.”
the voice said.
“You pay for my drink or you sing for your dinner,” he said.
“Cas,” Dean said.
“Yeah,” Charlie said. “I know. I mean, they met a couple of times as kids, I think, but not for like, a decade or two. He’s just flat-out refused to see her for months. I’ve been meeting with her to try to explain that he’s just nervous, but I’m really not the best at explaining things like that, and I don’t think she’s buying it, and every time he skips another party or event that she’s supposed to be at or refuses to set a time for a date, it just gets more awkward… ugh. Anyway, I thought you knew about all this.”
“Ohhhh, pop again!” Dean heard Ash say. He tried to focus. At least he could be pretty sure that their table would be safe; Ash didn’t usually call on the same group twice in a night.
Dean reached for a better feeling in himself, for understanding.
“Mmm-mmm.” Hannah shook their head. “Jody wanted me here for safety reasons and to help with the equipment and some admin stuff, she wants to upload a video today I think. She’s also here to direct you and she needs to be near Cas when we do the upload so that she can talk to him about anything that comes up, if there’s a problem or whatever. Cas isn’t great at answering his phone so she likes to be right next to him when she does this sort of thing. Oh, Donna’s around, too, but that’s just because Jody’s here. You won’t be in make-up today.” Hannah smiled at Dean as he nodded, taking it all in. “You know, I’m glad it’s you,” they said. “Doing the concert, I mean. I wanted to say before, at The Refuge, but I forgot and then the night ended kinda soon.”
He was the guy Castiel had chosen to go on a date with, the one standing outside with him here in the rain. Castiel was looking at
“That doesn’t make sense, Ash,” Dean said, and raised a pointed eyebrow at him, and then turned back to Cas. “So… Catullus. I’ll check out his stuff.”
“That’s right,” Cas said, sounding relieved. “I believe you told me you’re going over to your brother’s house for Christmas, Dean. That sounds wonderful. I hope you already have gifts all bought. I read somewhere once that you should always try to buy your Christmas gifts in January, because everything is cheaper then. I always think that then you have them just sitting in your house for a year, which is fine if it’s something only they would like, but what if you really like the thing, too? The temptation would be huge. Or what if it’s, say, uh… some socks, and then one day you wake up and you can’t find any socks because they’re all in the laundry, so you dip into your Christmas gift store once, and then again, and before you know it… all the socks are gone? And you have to buy more again in December? It seems like a system that could easily fail, to me.”
He licked his lips.
“We have some time?”
“I’ve got it,” Castiel said, retrieving the blanket and handing it to Charlie, who shook it out of its folds and up high before letting it fall flat to the ground. Lisa, who had crouched to look at the contents of her own bag, smiled mischievously.
And Dean was going to sit down in front of him and say – say something. Probably something stupid. Probably something that wouldn’t work. Probably something that would only make everything worse.
thank you so much for following along with this fic as it posts. it's so wonderful to read your comments!! this week's been next-level busy for me and I think I'm developing an eye twitch maybe but this fic is a oasis in a desert filled with the sands of BUSY-NESS. yeah. permit me a wonky analogy in this time of turbulence. thank you again and hope you enjoyed!!
me, then.”
The figure on the ground looked up - Dean had a better view of them now, their pale linen pantsuit and soiled strappy shoes, totally inappropriate for the Underlight. This was someone who lived in the Mid at least, maybe the Up. What were they even doing down here? They had long manicured nails and dark, shining hair. And they had an expression of utter contempt on their face when they spat on their assailant’s boots.
“You guys still have her income, right? So you can keep the apartment?”
Another tear.
The cathedral of United Corelia wasn’t so large as its grand name suggested. Its warm, sand-coloured walls housed intricate murals and stained-glass windows that speckled the gathered congregation with gentle rainbow lights; flowers in firework sprays adorned the ends of each row of seats. At the end of the central aisle was a simple table with a pale cloth covering it, on which sat a grander bouquet of Corelian blue blossoms.
Mary acknowledged it with a flick of her eyebrows, but the troubled look on her face didn’t ease. Castiel could see her battling with her own memory, searching out all the times when she should have noticed something.
“It can’t be like this forever,” Castiel said, and his voice cracked a little just at the thought. The pain didn’t even belong to him and the thought of it never ending was unimaginable.
“Done. Thought I’d come say hi.” Dean raises an eyebrow and a half-smile at him in greeting. “So, hi.”
It all came back at once.
Anna’s face went still, their certainty frozen.
The pain that had come to rest inside him suddenly rushed, jolted, skittered through him, thrust new needles into his chest, burned new brands into the underside of his skin. He closed his eyes but he could still see her, see the revenant, see her through the darkness – except in his mind, now, he saw her not as the creature with pitted eyes and ghost-white skin. He saw her with long wavy golden hair and terribly sad eyes.
“Oh,” Castiel said.
“You didn’t know?” Castiel said, and Dean knew him well enough to be able to picture the look of disbelief on his face. “But Dean, I… I thought you knew. I was so obvious.”
“What stuff?”
He slammed his fist against it, just once, and then pressed his forehead to it, both hands cradling his stomach.
“Mmm. Not that rating.” Again, Charlie sounded as though she was enjoying herself far too much.
“I… she…” Dean shook his head. “Charlie, I didn’t… I didn’t decide any of that.”
Dean read on a little way. At one point, Charlie started talking at length about the pattern she wanted on the wall in her bedroom, some kind of stencilled effect; Dean almost skipped ahead, but stopped and frowned. Intercut with Charlie’s speech were some messages – messages from Castiel.
“Criminal? They were just trying to keep their brother alive.”
No matter what, not knowing seemed like the only way to avoid the hurt. It was going very well, Castiel thought, feeling his heart aching moodily inside him.
So many answers.
“Only polite,” Dean said. “Come on, then, let’s go through.”
“Hello, Dean,” said Cas. The mask looked back at Dean, and Dean wished he could step closer and slide his fingers behind it, lift it up, find the smile that he could hear in Cas’ voice underneath.
“Wait,” Castiel said, “wait, don’t go. You can’t try to scam me for my address and then not give me any answers, I…”
“Thank you, Ma’am,” Castiel agreed courteously, and bowed his head to her as she turned away from him. The group straggled towards the cars that awaited them in sleek dark resplendence.
A little firework burst on the three-dimensional screen, over the word
How could Castiel be sitting there? Just sitting there in front of his bookshelves, looking that good and talking and moving like a real person? Dean had spent so long after they’d stopped talking just thinking about Castiel, arguing with him in his mind, picturing what could have happened if things had gone better between them. If Dean hadn’t been wrong about the way that Castiel had felt.
“And I wanted to ask you for something.”
“– swear to fucking god, I’m gonna kill you if you don’t wake up, I’m gonna kill you if you’re dead, I’m gonna fucking kill you, I swear to god – Sam, you’re gonna have to help me move him –”
Cas was there in front of him, and suddenly the whole thing felt almost funny, the good kind of ridiculous. Cas was there, and Dean found himself smiling for no reason.
“It’s Jo Harvelle,” Jo called back, when Castiel didn’t answer. After a moment of silence the bathroom door clicked open and Dean’s head poked out, with a distinctly confused expression.
“Wait,” he said. “Wait.”
The moment drew out. In that moment, in Dean’s eyes, Castiel could have sworn that he saw something. Some look, some expression that made Castiel’s own chest feel open and painful, and –
This time, it was Dean who got to watch Castiel’s mouth drop open.
He’s made his choice. And if he ever regrets it, if he ever wishes things could be different, all he has to do is look at Dean and it pales to nothing.
“Well,” he said, deliberately casual. “Hi.”
“I told you,” Dean growled at Charlie over the phone. “I wanted to be the one hosting.”
“Oh, y’all were gone by then,” Garth said.
Castiel felt himself freeze, just as he made eye contact with Dean.
“Shh,” Castiel cautioned, as he hit
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey,” Dean said, sitting down.
“Yeah, I get it. I do. There’s a lot more hanging on it when it’s someone closer, or whatever.”
Then, abruptly, he tugged on it. The thread snapped. He nodded to himself. Whatever the thing was, he wasn’t going to live with it hanging in his bathroom, the circles watching him like a single eye. Matter-of-factly, he moved to the next room.
“Mhm. So,” she said, her tone shifting gears, driving them away from their reconciliation and down a different road. “About that video.”
“If you don’t want anything…” Dean said awkwardly.
“You’re alive,” Dean said.
Castiel rounded the corner of an aisle, and found himself looking at a closed fridge with a glass door full of milk and yoghurts and butter. He began putting things into his basket at random. Back at home, he’d had a grocery store that he’d visited regularly, and he’d usually ended up going home with the same things each time he’d shopped there. Now, though, he had no idea what he liked from here. He decided to try a banana-flavoured yoghurt.
For a second, Castiel stood still and drank in the sensation of being alone – of no one knowing exactly where he was. The last short while had been a mess in so many ways. In the hush of his own space, he felt a part of him relax.
After a moment, Lisa reached out a hand for Charlie. There was hesitation and fear on Charlie’s face, but Lisa kept her hand held out, and eventually Charlie took it.
This time, it had printed out Castiel’s messages. But last time –
“Hey,” Dean said. “I, uh…”
“Seriously, man, don’t worry about it. It’s no big deal. Not like I’m out here selling drugs every night or something.” He’d said it a little too loud, and saw out of the corner of his eye that one of the couples at a table nearby had turned to look at him.
This was turning into a dream. Dean felt the need to pinch himself. It was a damn good dream, though, so he’d pinch later.
How strange, he thought, to be feeling someone else’s hurt all the way through him. Not bad, not exactly. In a way, it almost felt good. Or maybe it just felt right. It felt right to look at the sunlight on the wall and feel his chest twist with how beautiful it was, and how lucky he was to be here and to see it, instead of feeling nothing. It felt right to think of the day before and hurt just a bit about it, about Jess, about how she’d woken from sleep to protect the forest, about how she loved Dean’s brother.
He backed away from the man, who stopped and turned to him, looking him dead in the eye.
it, and at The Refuge you were allowed to like things that the outside world didn’t always get.
Hope you enjoyed this one guys!!! The brownies last week turned out lovely. This weekend I'm going to Pride in London!! For the first time ever!! I hope you all have a great weekend and you feel the queer vibes radiating out of the big city. <3
“Mom…” Dean said, and Mary’s shoulders tensed. She turned, and took in the sight of them both standing near the entrance to the room, side by side.
“I’m gonna – wait, wait, I’m gonna –
“Yeah?”
Before he could let his mind run too far with what exactly that
It wasn’t entirely what he’d meant, but Castiel realised as Dean’s arms wrapped around him that it was exactly what he wanted. They hugged in silence for a second, and then two, and then three.
“Damn,” Jo said.
”Do you have a printer?” Castiel said blankly, his heart sinking. So, whatever Dean had meant by that, it wasn’t that he wanted to stop the wedding to Lisa. Castiel couldn’t keep up with each new way he thought Dean felt.
“Charlie,” Dean said to Charlie’s back. “You’re not fired.”
Castiel’s mouth was dry. He knew that he should be saying something, letting Dean know what Jo had said, asking her to tell them how she’d found out – but he was frozen, stuck listening to them small talk as his mind frantically grabbed for words to say.
“I don’t know, Dean.”
“Just pick it up.”
“Mm?” Castiel said.
“You really don’t know?”
It hadn’t been Memphis, of course, but that feeling of where he lived being so irrelevant to everyone passing through under the burning summer sun, the feeling of being small and stuck when everyone else was on their way to bigger and better things, that was something Dean remembered with a sharpness that almost still hurt. He moved into the chorus, and realised suddenly that he was doing it - he was doing what Charlie had said he should do, what he’d already told her he couldn’t do tonight, what he’d panicked about doing from the moment she’d suggested it; a pit opened up in his stomach as he suddenly felt the reality of it all sink into him, but there was no time, here came that chorus -
“That’s a long title,” he said. “Very unusual.”
“Uh huh,” he said. “Right, they just… what, survey?”
“Dean?” he called.
“Castiel, they’re asking for you.”
“Oh, nice,” Sam said. “I can call ahead to the warden, have him clear the area for you.”
“Oh,” he said. “Crap.”
Something about the second tap on the door made it more of a question. Castiel hurried down the hall, and clicked open the door.
He was looking down at the floor, and Dean swallowed hard. Looking at Cas, now, at the expression on his face, Dean got just a hint of what it was like to be him. The surreality. The hiding. The loneliness.
Everything was still. Calm.
Castiel had said. And despite himself, he’d been glowing.
and even though he knew he didn’t want to melt through his days like this – slumped on his sofa with phone in hand – he ended up doing it anyway.
“You think so?”
––––-
“What about if they weren’t a stranger,” Charlie said. “What about if you meet someone you connect with like you connect with Cas, except they’re not asexual?”
“Here all along, huh.” Dean says. “Damn it, Cas. And there was me, worrying where to find it for no goddamn reason.” The words are irritable but Dean’s tone is a betrayal of them, because it’s so gentle, so serious. Serious enough that Castiel doesn’t feel silly when he takes a step forward, closer to Dean.
“Thank you for tonight,” Castiel said. He had to speak a little louder to be heard over the deluge. “If you wanted to do this again…”
“Who are you?” Castiel asked again. Dean opened his mouth.
“You’re always welcome,” Castiel tries quietly. Dean seems to catch himself, shifting his expression to something more neutral as he turns back to Castiel.
“No, no,” Cas said. “Nothing.”
“Had all night to think about it,” he said roughly. “Need to do it. Try this. Before you leave the forest.”
“Okay, everyone, best smiles!” Charlie said. The cameras started to flash again in earnest, and Castiel resigned himself to where he was stuck. He tried his best to look photogenic. In front of him, Claire and Kaia shuffled closer together.
“Cas, we’re so fucked. We’re so fucked.”
“I did?”
Dean wanted to say.
It fell away.
Dean glanced over at her smile, and thought about the way the shifter he’d taken out earlier that day had looked at him, right before he’d swung the blade through her neck. He swallowed hard.
“Shelve it,” Charlie said, but kindly. “Your stuff first. Get in the damn car.”
“We just are,” Dean said immediately, stolidly.
Walking through the city in the early morning was better with Dean there. If Castiel needed more proof of how he felt, it was the simple comparison: the day before he’d walked through the city alone, and it had been good and beautiful. Today, he walked through the city with Dean at his side, and it was the best, the most beautiful. There were several people with whom the walk would have been better, but perhaps only one with whom it was the best.
He moved on, stepping out the other side of the parking lot and onto the sidewalk.
“Oh,” Dean said. “You know. Not much. Uh.”
said Anna, and the camera saw her lean around Dean to look at Cas, who was just out of shot.
to ruin it. Not even knowing what he’d done, he’d screwed up Dean’s master Christmas plan.
“Whoa, there,” said John, as Dean felt his balance go, his feet skidding out from under him – and suddenly he was being lifted, one hand on either side of him. John pulled him up out of the fall, and set him back down in thick snow.
” Dean wiped a hand across his face. “I thought you were a goner. I was trying to say stuff to you but it was like you couldn’t hear me. And I was trying to move to push her away or fight her but it was – I couldn’t move – I know that sounds like I made it up but I swear…”
Cas said. The camera zoomed in close on Anna’s face as she nodded politely, oblivious, and Dean found himself smiling down at the screen - at the joke the editing was making.
“The revenant.”
is, though. Look at him, sitting over there. Just lording it over everyone else.”
“The revenant?” Castiel asked.
Dean wanted to say something. Castiel could tell by the way that he was sitting, and by the quality of the silence. He let the quiet draw out, hoping Dean would have the courage.
“Dude, we sat on that balcony and laughed for, like, three hours at the stupidest crap. D’you remember,” Dean said, and now he was actually smiling, “I almost fell over the railing thing, because you said the word ‘peanut’ –”
“You don’t want this to build up into something bigger,” Charlie said. “Talk to him. Just… trust him enough to talk to him. If you don’t trust each other enough to talk about stuff, it’s not gonna go well.”
“Wait, you are? Seriously? Oh. Wow.
He searched for that feeling inside himself, and could only find that soft, insistent voice that murmured
“Hey,” Dean said.
“Right. Yeah. Great, good.” Dean looked over at the stranger he’d just kissed, and then found himself looking down and away with a half-smile on his face, like a school kid. “Awesome.”
Eating his breakfast – a couple of cereal bars, skinned of their foil wrappers and gulped down in huge bites – Castiel got himself dressed. Better to go sooner than later, after all. He didn’t want to have to think about making it home through the forest with the sun gone. It was going to be bad enough as it was, with only the map on his phone to guide him.
“Oh. Thank you.” Neither of them seemed to be in a rush to leave the car, however. Hannah eyed him from the front seat, waiting for him to get out. Maybe that was just the protocol for a driver, Castiel thought. Maybe he was the only one feeling the grasp of coldness in his throat, the only one half-waiting to see the shadows on the porch start whispering or watch the house windows start to cry red.
“Uh-huh.” Dean turned back to the books. “Why are half of these books with wizards in, and half of them books about law?”
Castiel lifted his chin up, and stood straight, and said in his strongest possible voice,
“My - my arm - I need a doctor,” said the figure on the floor. “Please, I - who are you? Are you helping, or…?”
Cas, peering around the kitchen, shook his head. Dean could see him thinking, could see that he hadn’t let go of what they were talking about before - his apartment, how he’d decorated it. Or not decorated it, more accurately. He could have headed the conversation another way, brought up another topic, headed Cas off - but he bit back the impulse. He let Cas think, and then talk.
. “You’ll tell us, right?”
“Well… she thought I meant I was a bigamist. Told me she didn’t mind, one of her cousins had married two women at the same time by accident and they were still on speaking terms.”
There’s a
“The pictures. The wedding pictures.” Castiel put his hand back into his pocket, a little clumsily as his coat was rucked up behind him on the sofa, and pulled out the envelope that Balthazar had given to him. “We could look at them, and see if anyone else was there.”
“Dean?”
“I don’t remember that,” Castiel said. He wanted to flop down on the bed next to Dean. He wanted Dean to put his head on Castiel’s shoulder. He wanted to kiss Dean and tell him it didn’t matter anyway, and they should just run away to a place where Castiel could always wear his clothes. He felt young in the slightly too-big pyjamas, too young to know how to handle a potentially international scandal about to drop.
He hoped that when he returned, something might be different. That he and Dean could talk. Maybe even – as he walked down a side-street with neon lights that glowed through the drizzling rain, Castiel allowed himself a wry little smile. Maybe even do something together. Go somewhere. Go on a date.
“One sec,” Dean said to Sam, and slid his finger across the screen to answer the call. “Hey, what’s up?”
One by one, the singers stepped out onto the stage; there were all sorts of people, all ages and vocal styles and song choices. Dean heard some renditions of Castiel’s songs like he’d never heard them before - sung in a different voice, yes, but he was hearing them with new ears after Anna had defended them against his criticisms. The lyrics that he’d thought of as generic, they took on a delicate meaning when sung by people who loved them. Beside him, Cas seemed to be caught up in the performances on some profound level that Dean didn’t fully understand; there was a wistful, almost proud look in his eyes as each new hopeful took to the stage.
It was as though she understood how much it was hurting to have to see this happen. And as Castiel looked back to Donna and Jody, he thought that they did, too. Somehow, they knew.
Jo shrugged.
Castiel considered pushing the question he’d wanted to ask, but decided to drop it. He’d never found hard questioning to be a good way to get answers out of Dean, anyway.
“Maybe she had less to lose,” Claire said.
. And you don’t… yeah.”
He wasn’t meeting Castiel’s eyes, and Castiel looked away from him down the path he knew they’d take – the one to the right, that led to the lake.
Dean managed to smile.
“About you. You look good, Cas.” He raised his eyebrows. He flirted, hard, with the way he looked at Cas. “You always do.”
Castiel tucked his left hand behind his back. He held eye contact as Dean said,
Charlie made a smoochy noise.
Dean shrugged.
“Which guy?”
he thought.
He turned to face Castiel.
Keep it simple, he figured.
“Not end with one of your own?” Jody said sceptically. “Why do you want to end with the Bublé cover?”
"Ha-ha, hilarious, we already went over that. Seriously, Dean, don't."
Castiel raised a hand, half in acknowledgement, half in a wave of parting.
“You know what? If you can’t help, just…" Dean's face was all angles, furious. "Just
“Uh…” Dean swallowed. He hadn’t brought a tape, hadn’t brought anything. God, what was he doing here. “I actually… no, I don’t.”
Dean picked up the mic stand, and turned it ninety degrees. He got behind the mic, facing off towards the wing instead of straight ahead, looking towards where Cas was standing. His eyes sought Cas’, and found them.
When he said the name, he didn’t think of Cas. He thought of bright lights, and lyrics with thin meanings, and synth beats. Everything was quiet. Sam wasn’t saying a word. He could hear a couple of taps at a keyboard, though.
“Are you okay?”
“We could all talk about how being sensitive and appreciative of beauty doesn’t detract from who we are as people, and how his friends need to learn a thing or two.”
“Uh –”
The way Cas had held his look, just then! God, it was completely undeniable, and Dean was so goddamn happy that he couldn’t stop goddamn smiling, even though he now had to go and sing on a stage - a cappella no less - for an audition to take part in a show he didn’t even
Dean stared after the car as it drove away. Eventually, Charlie left him standing there.
They looked into each other’s eyes. Something should be said, Castiel felt, but what and by whom he didn’t know.
Castiel can’t meet his eyes. He looks to the side, around the garden that he’s created. The flowers that have unfurled for him, trusting, unfussy about what deep love and secrets he’s hiding. The leaves and shoots that grow steadily under the care of his hands, no matter who else those hands wish they could hold.
“I… don’t use hair gel. We’ve been through this.”
“You should kiss me,” the guy said.
“And leave her to come and find you?” Charlie said sceptically.
Castiel nodded, trying to follow the train of thought, his head pounding painfully.
He clicked across his screen, grabbing the transcript and firing it off in an email to Castiel. There. Done. Finished.
“It’s not a good idea,” Castiel said, even though he knew he was going to say yes, just to needle Dean for a little longer.
“Yeah?”
“I didn’t expect anything to grow when I buried it here,” Castiel says to Dean, over his shoulder. “But then the first flowers came, and so I bought more, and then I put in the fence, and – it helped, being able to come here.” He puts out his hand towards the peach rose, speaking meditatively, almost not quite to Dean at all.
"Sir?" said Hannah, still sitting in the front seat, watching him through the open door. His hesitation had to be written unmistakably on his face; they were watching him with obvious sympathy. Castiel gritted his teeth, and steeled himself.
“I teach fine,” Dean grunted. “No complaints.”
“Whatcha talkin’ ‘bout?” Ash said, smiling past Dean, towards Cas.
Dean swallowed, just the sound of his brother’s voice like a punch to the stomach. Sam sounded like he normally did when he picked up the phone - just a little annoyed at being disturbed, but also a little pleased to get the call. Dean could hear it all in just that one word. He knew his brother. He’d
Inside him, a little voice was saying,
“I think it was a spa that we broke into, actually.” The reply was so suave. Had that actually happened? Castiel looked across at Dean, a question in his eyes.
“But I did already see them,” Castiel said.
of you.”
There was general laughter from the other bachelors, which Castiel tried not to judge them for. It hadn’t been the funniest story in the world, but it was polite to laugh. Hopefully Castiel’s own rudeness had escaped notice. He took in another breath of the steam. It smelled like eucalyptus.
OOOOOOOOOH suspense. I am bringing this chapter to you with love in my heart and also a blue-haired friendo at my side!! Thank you lovely natmoose for being here and for insisting on reading this chapter tonight (against all better judgement, perhaps this is another one of the crimes we have committed, along with luggage-leaving and walking up the wrong side of the stairs). I hope this week brings good friends and good times to everyone. Be well out there!! <3
Revenant. Revenant. It was out there. Dean was putting up the – the wards, the things that had been hanging in the house. Keeping it at bay, Castiel realised now. Those shadows that had seemed to move, the ones that had rushed and scurried as he’d gone up and down the stairs, they’d been it. Or a part of it.
“You asked, and I thought you meant -”
“Just surprised that they’ll make it that way for us.”
The elevator flew. The city cupped him in one of her many metal hands and desperately flung him upward. Dean couldn’t make out the letters on the read-out, the glowing cube above him.
Dean tried to push thoughts of the Underlight away. They didn’t mix well with parties. He could remember a time when holding the line between his life down there and his life up here had been so clean and so easy. Nothing had got to him. He’d left it all in the elevator. He’d been two different people. And then, around the time that goddamn Angel had started showing up, it had all started to change.
He leaned forwards, and kissed Dean.
After all these years of saying nothing, being good, being
He wasn’t noticing the shape of Dean’s shoulders. Or the way there was a drop of sweat moving slowly down the back of his neck.
Dean swallowed, and reached out, and adjusted Castiel’s tie.
He stared across the room. Should he answer it? If it was Charlie, she’d want to know why he was in Dean’s room and wearing Dean’s clothes. If it was Mary, that would be terrifying. If it was Sam, he wouldn’t know what to say. If it was Lisa…
Burning in his mind, the image of him leaning in to kiss Cas -
“Sure,” they said. “On its way. That’ll be twenty-one fifty.”
“What you’d… be?”
“Mm?”
Dumb piece of crap, he thought, couldn’t even keep up a decent attitude for one whole day –
Friends, it's here!! I hope you enjoy this chapter nugget. Deep-fried and full of goodness. The next chapter will be up in a week, Friday the 10th! Good luck with this week, my dears. I hope it brings you many delights <3
“You’re just?” Charlie prompted. Dean threw her a glance. So, she was going to make him say it.
“Jesus, Charlie, it’s barely been a week.”
Jo winced.
His tone came out all wrong, too sincere, too heavy. He was wincing at himself from above before the sentence was even finished.
He tried not to. He didn’t want to see the pale body, robed in shadow. He didn’t want to see the gaping mouth, the empty eyes, the grasping hands. He didn’t want to see the way the shaded folds of its clothing danced and spat and screamed and laughed with tiny fanged mouths, the way they rippled over each other and swirled and moved but bound to the central point of that horrific white body – they were rats in a rat king, and the corpse at their heart leaned forward and drew in a breath and Castiel felt his lungs go stiff as iron. Felt his mind go dark and cold. Felt –
And Dean didn’t want it to be. He spent the whole of the rest of the day thinking about how much he didn't want that.
“You thought you could stop us being friends?” Castiel said, hearing the perplexion in his own voice. He saw Jody’s familiar little half-smirk creep onto her face.
Damn it.
Another wave of physical feeling pulsed through him, and Castiel trailed his kisses away from Dean’s lips, and down his cheek to his neck.
But Dean swallowed it. He couldn’t just have that. He couldn’t. Could he?
Dean said,
He wondered what he, himself, was thinking. Somehow focusing on Dean and imagining what he might have going through his head was much easier than turning inward, and trying to face what he saw inside. The face of the revenant, round and round.
“She’s undead,” Dean said incredulously.
“Exactly. At that point, the execs pretty much took over. Cas got a say in some things, but mostly… I mean, he gets to write some of the lyrics, like just a few songs on each album and definitely not this one. And all the production, that’s out of his hands. Apparently there are algorithms and they can predict what people will respond to and that’s what they make.”
went the camera as Dean put his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, and pulled him backwards. Castiel let himself be tugged away, but then turned and pushed past Dean, heading for the door to the back garden. He’d just talk to the photographer, get those pictures deleted – he could feel bile rising in his throat. If they weren’t deleted, and if pictures of himself and Dean holding matching gold rings were published in the newspaper tomorrow…
“Oh. Well… well, I - okay.” There was a pause, and Dean could sense Sam running his hand through his hair, trying to figure out what to say. “Hey, I -”
“What?”
“Yes. It got a grand total of eight views and it was terrifying.”
Could he let this happen? Could he allow Dean to live miserably, just because it was Dean’s choice to do so? Could he break everything apart so that the two of them could have a chance of happiness? And could he choose to do so in the half of a half of a second that remained, before Missouri moved along with the ceremony?
He swallowed hard.
Dean very definitely did not look at Cas as he said the last part, but just voicing those words in Cas’ presence felt like setting down drawing pins in front of a magnet - they were pulled his way, became about him. Dean cleared his throat, and shrugged.
“Only… everything? I mean, directions, memories, hormone control, pain control, mood control… this thing is a lifesaver.”
A complete mess. A rude mess, too. And Castiel had still said yes
“Really? Thought you’d be staying at the Hilton or something.”
No right. He had
“Bathroom,” Cas said tersely, and left.
“Mostly, yeah,” he said, struggling not to feel immediately inadequate. “I tend to reread stuff. I don’t really know anything else… I know there’s shorter stuff but I haven’t read it… yet.”
and that’d clear a path for the
“Just a rumour,” Castiel said roughly.
“Well… we could make a stop.”
In the quiet intimacy of Dean’s bedroom, curled up together in his bed, Castiel felt the unfairness of it fill him up until it overspilled and he said, in a murmur,
“Cas…” he said, a little hoarsely.
“Are you?”
There was a general sigh of relief.
“Absolutely not,” Castiel replied. “It’s my turn to pay.”
Dean, Prince of United Corelia, said,
Dean chewed his final mouthful of burger, while Castiel swallowed his own.
“Is there… anything you want to talk about?” Castiel said eventually.
Except he wasn’t asleep. He was definitely awake. And Charlie was looking at him, a little lost. She reached out and patted his arm awkwardly. He shifted away, and she pulled her hand back.
Charlie let out a sigh.
“No, I just forgot to actually look at the board with the job notices on it.”
“Oh,” Dean said, “please, be my guest.”
he thought. What was he supposed to say? Confess his feelings, now of all times? Dean was getting married to Lisa. Dean
“What are you, the cops?” Dean said, at the same time as Castiel shot back,
Castiel didn’t meet his eyes.
“No,” Dean said quickly, immediately.
“It’s like,” Dean said, feeling the need to explain himself better, “I’ve read interviews with him because they’re
“Hi... is this makeup?” said a nervous voice, and in the mirror Dean could see someone else leaning through the doorway tentatively. Donna beamed at them.
“Well, I don’t know, do I?!”
” Hannah said.
“Oh. Like… the thing? That website… rate my professor?” Dean waved a hand. “S’always been fine.”
“Hi guys, I’m Balthazar, one of your judges,” said a new voice with an English accent; a slightly smug-looking blond guy stepped up onto the stage, but Dean only had eyes for Cas, who took a step towards the back. Cas looked down at Dean.
with the anger, at least. Something that would look as big and terrible and life-shattering as the way all of it felt.
Dean hesitated.
“You can eat a whole large popcorn on your own?” Castiel said, sounding surprised.
“I got yours,” Cas replied, and it sounded like a kind of ritual between them, the way that he said it; it made Charlie smile, and she reached out to clink her bottle against one of the beers on the table, encouraging Cas to take one.
“I was assured they’re the height of discretion. I’ll do some research on them before I tell them who you are, though.”
“What if I baked a pie with something bad in the filling?”
“I don’t,” Cas said. “I want to switch out
Castiel swallowed.
Castiel’s twisting skewered heart went numb, completely numb. He looked down, away. He stepped back, pulling himself out of Dean’s arms.
The leaf spiralled.
Opening the door, he saw a delivery person wearing a big smile and carrying a bunch of flowers.
“Was it?”
Was this real, Dean asked himself. Surely this had to be wishful thinking, nothing more.
look at the way he looks at him jfc is this allowed?
“Do you think so?”
He sounded more confident, he realised. His rehearsals with Cas had made his voice sound surer, like he knew what he was doing. He didn’t look up at Cas, just kept playing the song the way he half-remembered he’d played it before. God, was he actually doing this? The guitar strings thrummed under his fingers. How had the next bit gone? Hadn’t it had something about blue eyes in it? Should he change it?
“It’s true,” he said. “I haven’t hooked up with anyone. I just… I didn’t tell you why I didn’t want to, when we talked before. It wasn’t because I never felt attracted to anyone. It was because I only felt attracted to you.”
He meets Dean’s eyes, and says simply,
“I’m staying,” Castiel said. “I’m staying with you.”
“It was either that or your breakfast wasn’t sitting well.”
“Thanks,” Dean managed. “You want some?”
The sunlight through the windows of Castiel’s bedroom was a little kinder today. Still grey and limpid, but with a sweet pastel pink twist. For a few minutes, and then a few minutes more, Castiel lay back on his pillows and just let himself be.
Red-cheeked and grinning, he left small bootprints in the snow.
He looked like he could easily lift Dean up off the ground.
“Hey,” Dean said. “You okay?”
A hand on his arm. Cas.
Dean showered the next morning, and shaved. He put on a little cologne. He wore a fresh shirt.
He missed Dean. Missed his solidity. Missed his smile. Missed having him within touching distance. It had only happened once, but missed his kiss. He wanted that kiss back in a way that felt like roots through earth, reaching for what they needed.
“Watched the full Lord of the Rings extended editions back-to-back together?”
Cas watched him, waiting.
Dean looks confused. He doesn’t even bother to look down at the rose, just keeps his eyes on Castiel.
“Still,” Sam said, and didn’t seem to want to elaborate further.
“I thought I was doing what he wanted,” Mary said, eventually.
“Castiel…” Donna reached across the table. The kids of Saint Crispin’s were in and out of the kitchen, moving around them, the place as busy as always. Castiel was nursing a cup of tea and sitting opposite a pair of worried expressions, Donna’s eyebrows drawn low and Jody’s mouth tight.
“It feels like I have to do something, though.”
Charlie repeated the noise, and when Dean looked up at her, she raised an eyebrow challengingly.
The class shuffled for their books, retrieving them from their bags and opening them up to the first page with a few mutterings here and there – the odd giggle. Dean had no book, but thankfully was still sheltered from Castiel’s notice by the tall student in the seat in front. Instead of reading, Dean – keeping his head low – rested his chin on his hand and watched Castiel.
“You - you -”
“You just said…”
“You don’t need to change. Seriously. Noooo,” Charlie said, as Dean got up. “Don’t put on the dusty car clothes. Castiel, tell him he looks good today.”
“I’m sorry,” Kaia said suddenly, in a quiet voice.
tell me on this call. I can come meet you wherever you are, and we can find somewhere to bury the -”
said the someone, more insistently.
Castiel submerged it with a stern hand. No. He wasn’t going to think like that. The second he started trying to plan out a way to stop the wedding was the second he’d start getting his hopes up, and those hopes would only ever be disappointed. Even if he did manage to stop the wedding, Castiel could picture the look on Dean’s face: disbelief and horror that Castiel would do this to him.
“Ah. It’s okay.”
and you know that you shouldn’t and you know that it’ll have consequences and shit, but literally you can feel that kiss burning inside you, it’s like… that’s the good shit for me, you know. If it doesn’t spill out of you because you can’t keep it in, if you don’t feel the same thing coming right back from the other person... man, love like that is so goddamn raw. It’s so raw.” Dean blinked, and then cleared his throat, and awkwardly looked down at the floor. “Anyway, I’m… uh. Yeah… sorry if you like his stuff… there are ones of his that I don’t mind. Just…”
"Not down here," the Hunter said.
Like…” Dean sought for words, swept up in his own point. “When you want to kiss someone
“Well,” Cas said, “it can be scary to care a lot about someone, and then they reveal something about themselves you didn’t know before, and you realise how much you didn’t really know them. It makes you wonder what else you don’t know, I think.”
“It’s okay,” Sam said. He took an audible gulp of something that looked like sludge.
“Yeah. So, but… he’s told you, and things are still good between you? I mean, like, as far as you’re concerned?”
Castiel thought. He looked across at Dean. The familiarity of his face. The shape of his body under the covers, the look in his eyes.
The text, though, when Dean read it, put a frown on his face.
“But when you leave,” Dean said, “if I’d never – I’d never felt what it was like to –”
Out of the front windscreen, he could see it. His house. Blurry-eyed and still chasing back the smooth chrome reassurance of his imaginings, Castiel blinked up at it.
“You already know,” Castiel said. “You know what they’ll say.”
read the subject line. Castiel tapped on it and turned his phone around to Dean, trying not to look too upset. It was alright, wasn’t it, that the annulment had gone through? In a way, it was probably better. It meant that they would have lots of – lots of space, a no-pressure way to test-drive their relationship. It was a good, practical thing.
“This feels like… why are you asking?”
“Really,” Dean insisted. Their concern was embarrassing. “I’ll be okay.”
Dean’s listening intently, but his eyes are clouded with confusion. He looks like he wants to say something, and then stops himself. Castiel can’t blame him for not understanding, when half the point is that he’s talking without getting to the point. He doesn’t
The feeling was so intense that Dean pressed his lips together, hard, to keep himself in line and not make it weird. He hadn’t had someone react like this to him touching them in so long that it felt nothing short of miraculous, even though it was just holding hands in a movie theatre while a crappy movie played out across the screen.
It felt right to think of Dean, and feel an ache go all the way through him. As though his whole body clenched. As though his bones were trying to speak. Intense, and good, and bad. Dean, who sat next to him on the porch. Dean, who had run towards him with so much desperation in the forest, who had called his name so rough and raw when he’d thought Castiel was hurt. Dean, who didn’t trust him to stay. Dean who made him laugh. Dean who had learned more about him in a few days than any of his city friends had known in years. Dean who looked at him, looked at him like
“Next time,” John said, giving Dean a little push indoors, “I won’t catch you. You’ve got to learn, Dean.”
“No,” Dean said distractedly. “Wait, wait, can we – can we go back to the part – the ‘how I felt’ part?”
Yep. Awkward, just like he’d predicted. Fantastic. And of course Castiel was still dressed like a hot professor even though it was the weekend, and of course Dean just wanted to – to –
“I…” Dean didn’t know how to begin to explain. Of course Castiel hadn’t really known about the chili ratings, hadn’t ever been being smug. For a second, Dean thought about how Charlie was going to tell him ‘I told you so’ with a live orchestra for a backing track tomorrow morning.
Castiel frowned. Lisa. That was the name of Dean’s fiancée. There was new information here to try to take in with a brain made of fuzzy felt, and he knew he had to be missing some context.
“Ah,” Castiel breathed out against Dean’s cheek. “Ah, ah, ah – ah, Dean –
Dean made a noise that was both acknowledgement and irritation. When he had Jo had planned this trip together as a big blow-out spending spree after their first paycheck in their first jobs after college, it had felt like a great idea. For
Standing there behind him, staring right at him, was a man.
The corridor in front of him was long and empty. If he was being chased, his pursuer would easily see Castiel before he could reach the door at the end – but there were other doors all along the way, glass doors leading into other steam rooms. Castiel hurried forward and chose the nearest one, which led into a low-ceilinged, pleasantly dim room that was thick with peppermint steam. There was seating to one side, all seemingly made of some kind of whitish stone, like the walls and floor. Castiel pressed his back up against the wall next to the door, praying that whoever had come after him would just walk on past.
He went to cross the road, and a car gave a screech as it swerved suddenly to avoid him. The driver made a few different gestures at him through the window, and Dean held up a hand in apology.
“It just… it doesn’t feel…” Cas blinked thoughtfully. “It’s lovely,” he said. “But it doesn’t feel like it’s yours.”
On the screen, Charlie’s eyes narrowed into the briefest of winces. She replied to Castiel, giving Dean the space to be quiet.
“Really?”
It was only when he saw Gordon’s slightly sharp-edged grin that Castiel remembered there were a lot of stories about supernatural creatures and food and what it meant to accept it, and found a little room in his overworked chest to be relieved at his own choice. He remembered the mints Gordon had put in his grocery bag and made a note not to eat them, if he made it back to his house.
“Okay, so… anyway. Your name’s Cas, I got that. Where you from?”
There was a long pause. Dean could hear Sam breathing. He thought his chest might be about to explode. He wanted to hang up, wanted to throw away his phone, wanted to cry.
“I know,” he said blankly. “If you think it’s better to turn it over to Charlie or someone else, they’d be able to keep it secret better, we can do that.”
There it was, the smoky shyness that gave his voice its edge, it emotion. He leaned into it, tapping out the beat to keep himself on time with one foot. When he had it, he let himself turn towards the little crowd in front of him, but kept glancing back to Cas when his nerves caught up with him again.
To one side, a countdown showed that Dean had only a few seconds left before he arrived.
“Oh my god, Charlie.” Dean put his face in his hands. “You have never asked me that about anyone I’ve ever dated before. What
He put his hand in his pocket, just to feel its smooth weight. The ring he’d been given by Dean, on the night they’d got married. Castiel closed his eyes. The further he got from the Poison Bombs, the more details were coming back to him. He remembered the expression on the officiant’s face as he’d declared them married. He remembered the ridiculous music playing in the background, something he’d recognised – that was it, Taylor Swift,
“You didn’t have to,” Castiel said.
“Mm?”
“It’s a picture of you, with Castiel, holding wedding rings,” Mary said. Her voice betrayed no anger, her composure complete.
“No. No. No,” he said. But he couldn’t make it untrue. Castiel had seen the message that Dean had sent to Charlie, wishing that things could have worked out between him and Cas.
“Is it the money-grabbing fakers or the racism or the homophobia? Or is it -”
In the living room, he found another one of those mobiles. It was tucked away behind a bookshelf in a corner, almost out of sight. He stared at it malevolently for a few seconds, and then he went and retrieved his scissors from the top of one of his boxes, and snipped its string. It felt heavy and ugly in his hand. In a few steps, he was at the window; with one hand, he unlatched it and pushed it open, and dropped the mobile out. It landed with a thump on the bed of leaves outside.
“You know,” he said. “I’m the school disaster. Why’d he even say yes to me?” As soon as he asked the question, Dean realised that it was at the heart of what had been bugging him all this time. “What’s he expecting? I'm not… interesting. Even when I'm trying to be."
“‘Who is mysterious Dean, the viral star?’ What the
Castiel’s full day of cleaning, the mess he’d made of his white t-shirt, the sweat that had dripped down his forehead as he’d scrubbed the trickier patches of dirt, the way his back was aching now – all of it was very suddenly and very definitely worth it.
“I think you went to Coastal to study the law, not beat up bad dudes," Dean said. “Am I right, or am I right.”
Mary was rigid in the centre of the aisle, her dress fanning out from her hips in a perfect silhouette, her crown glittering. The congregation’s mutterings grew louder as Lisa looked away from Dean towards Charlie and squeezed her hand tighter. Dean was completely still, watching Mary.
“First real date,” he managed.
said his heart, as he waited.
“You really can,” Jo said. When Dean and Castiel turned sharp eyes on her, she shrugged. “My mom bought them before she knew exactly what they were, and I peeked. Sue me. Listen, uh, I don’t wanna bail, here. But I don’t think there’s anything I can do. You know where to go if you want the photos pulled. And I should get home and feed my cat.”
“I just… there’s a lot going on,” Dean said. “I’m, uh, gonna come out to my brother later. Like, later today. So there’s that. And also I told Cas that I like him and he told me he likes me, but he… told me something pretty personal before he did and he was so… he almost left, just walked away, he was so mad at me. And like, at the time I was just in, like,
he had.
“I don’t know, Cas.” Dean was looking around the clearing, seeming nervous. “Maybe she’ll come out and talk to us if we wait.”
“It was different,” Dean said. He reached out and flicked on the blinker of the car absently, but it did nothing while the keys weren’t in the ignition. “He didn’t know he was aro so I had no idea what was going on, and I couldn’t ask him about it. That was mostly why I was unhappy, really, I just didn’t get what was happening. Whereas with Cas I know about him being ace. I can talk to him about it, we’ve already talked about it. And anyway, with Nick, I mean - I liked him, he’s great, but it didn’t - he wasn’t Cas.” He flicked off the blinker. “None of the people I’ve dated have ever been Cas.”
They ran together, all the way to the porch steps of the orphanage. They tucked themselves under the small portico, and leaned against the front door and each other, and breathed.
Dean’s face darkened.
“I believe you,” Castiel said.
“No. Do you?”
“I just care that you lied,” Gabriel said.
They probably didn’t have feelings for Cas, then, Dean thought. Not if they were this supportive of Dean’s apparently very public attempt at flirting, which he’d somehow in the moment thought would be going unnoticed by everyone but Cas.
“Me too,” Dean said. “Me too, Cas.”
Castiel paused a moment.
“Do you not want me to –”
“Donna’s making breakfast,” Claire said breezily. “So I’m great.”
Charlie lifted up her arms, reaching for a hug, as she moved around the desk; the gesture was cute, almost childlike. Dean folded her up tight, squeezing her, lifting her a little way off the ground.
“No, I… no, I didn’t.”
“Oh? So what’s up?”
Obviously, he had to leave. He’d stayed last night because there had been no chance he was going to try to head out into the forest alone in the dark, and he hadn’t called Hannah to ask them to come back because – well, the wards had been up, and – and he hadn’t wanted to sound as though he’d snapped, and have them tell Ishim, who would tell everyone at his old law firm.
“Yeah. They’re going to upload it today, I think. That’s the video I’m here to help with.”
Dean gave him a look.
Castiel was frowning, but after a few seconds he nodded.
And there was no point in remembering what the ring represented, either. From today, that had to be put aside. Left behind. He had to move on.
“Dean,” Charlie said, “seriously, you could’ve just told him it wasn’t a joke, told him that you like him –”
Castiel, still feeling the ghost of Dean’s hold on him, pressed his lips together.
“I believe you’ll have to fight me for them.”
“I'm sorry I snapped,” he said.
Charlie looked to the Queen, who gave a tiny nod.
Castiel knew. It made no sense to him either. They were both here. They were alone. It would be as simple as Dean’s hand a little closer than it was. Dean’s lips on Castiel’s neck. Castiel’s lower back pushed forward off the wall, and –
Years of thinking about it. Hours to prepare. A whole dictionary full of words in the English language that he could have used to broach this topic, and the way he’d chosen to go was that. Was Batman.
“Why?”
“Two very grand names,” she said. “This is a historic occasion. But let’s not forget, it’s also the union of these two people who stand in front of me. Before us all, they will pledge the rest of their lives to each other – a promise to love each other, and support each other, and be the rock in each other’s storms. This is a royal wedding, but it’s also the beginning of a marriage that will be like any other – full of small happinesses and strifes, that the two of them will face together, with love to sustain them.”
“Yes,” he said again. “Yes. It is.”
“What’s going on,” Sam said, with enough calmness that Castiel knew Sam had a very good idea about what was going on, and had decided to play ignorant for now. Castiel watched Sam meet his brother’s eyes, and a moment of understanding passed between them.
The ride was so smooth that he could sit with his head leaning up against the window, staring out. He’d watched the metallic huff and grumble of the city,
“Guess all you’ve got left is your natural talent, then,” Dean said, still holding out the phone.
“That sounds wonderful. Congratulations.” The words could have sounded stilted and formal, but Cas said them with such sincerity that it shaved off the awkward edges. Dean looked up at him, and smiled.
“If Dean doesn’t want to get married –” he began.
The Queen looked to her eldest son, and raised her eyebrows. When Dean cleared his throat, looking for the words, she folded her arms in anticipation.
It was a plush twelve-foot space. The walls were lined with red velvet - all but one, which was glass, and afforded a view out over the city. As the elevator rose higher and higher, the buildings of the Up came into view: the Prosperity building, the Peace building, the Honour Building. They were leviathan in size, each housing thousands of people. And soaring above them all, a glittering spire lit up in bright neon, a spike that pierced the dark sky - a building so elite and exclusive that it was only called by one word: Heaven. Dean eyed the tower where the Angels lived and worked. On the side of the building, moving banners showed the smiling face of the current Archangel, Naomi. It was captioned,
“Not yet,” Cas said. “Nice to meet you.”
“So’ll my brother,” said the asshole, and suddenly Dean was pulling up short, and they weren’t quite such an asshole anymore. “And he doesn’t have a good job or fancy shoes or a nice watch to sell like you do. So I’ll still be having what’s in that bag, thanks.” They waved the lightknife threateningly. “I will use this. You don’t need all your fingers to open a bag.”
“It can’t be.” Castiel reached the newspapers and picked one up. There it was, stark and slightly oversaturated: he saw his own face printed there on the front page of the Mail, slightly blurry and dark through the window of Saint Crispin’s. Opposite him was, quite clearly, Dean. They looked tense, and Dean’s mouth was open as though he was speaking. And between them, they were each holding a golden ring.
“Just checking,” Dean said, a touch defensively.
Dean looked up at the sky, tracing patterns in the stars. He thought of how he’d made it here, to the big city. He thought of The Refuge. He thought of his brother, still with no idea that Dean wasn’t straight. He thought of Cas, who he liked more than he knew how to say, right now.
“You didn’t have to freakin’... embarrass me in front of him.”
“Mm. You’re the best, Charlie.” He put her down carefully, and she grinned at him.
Dean stared at her. How was she here already? Had it really been an hour? It felt like five minutes.
“Just take it,” said the figure on the floor, kicking it towards their attacker, who shook their head coolly.
Was Dean pranking him? Probably not, right? Why would he? But then again, Dean was trying to convince him that the hack was real over WhatsApp in a way that was stylistically similar and just as unconvincing as the hacker themself over text… Castiel wasn’t sure what to make of that. Attention from Dean would feel kind of good, but given that the attention he was possibly getting was some kind of attempt to scam him out of his personal details, the good feeling was definitely not boundless.
“I know you won’t save my brother,” Dean said, backing away.
“I’ve literally never seen you like this,” she said, sipping on a milkshake that she’d managed to convince Dean to stop long enough to let her buy.
Dean dropped his head into his hands.
It was a soft knock that sounded through the room – not shy, but careful. For a confused second, Castiel looked over at the bathroom door that Dean had gone through, but then the knocking came again. It was coming from the door out into the corridor, Castiel realised.
“I don’t care,” Castiel said. “I want you.”
She smiled, but then shook her head.
And then they faded, and he could see the bright yellow giraffe-shaped bouncy castle, and the paint pots, and the sheets of white paper.
The makeup room was small, with cream walls and a big black chair sitting in front of a wide mirror. Dean took a seat, feeling big and clumsy. Donna, though, didn’t seem to be suspicious of him; on the contrary, her smile was huge and genuine, and being on the receiving end of it somehow made Dean feel just a little bit better.
Cas said nothing, only waited; Dean shrugged his shoulders, and a feeling managed to lap its way briefly over the numbing wall of shock - a slightly frantic, fervent confusion.
He sat for a few more minutes, and then got up and fetched his phone and googled,
“Thank you.”
He’d started to lose steam a little there, towards the end, but he felt like he was doing a decent job. He glanced quickly around the class and saw all eyes on him – no one obviously distracted on their phone or losing interest. That was something.
“Like Batman?”
With a more suspicious expression on his face than ever, Castiel responded,
“I think I’ve had enough to eat,” she said blandly. “It’s a lovely day. Dean, why don’t you show Lisa the terrace?” At her glance, a palace worker in a bright, elegant coat hurried over and opened the doors that led out to the stone-flagged terrace, letting in a rush of sweet-smelling air. The Queen grew her honeysuckles and roses around the terrace columns.
“But Dean,” Castiel said. “Dean says you frighten everyone away. You came into my house when the wards were down. You were frightening. That didn’t seem like helping.”
She was being kinder than usual, joking with him rather than about him. Castiel could sense it, even though she was working hard to keep it locked down – her need for him to be normal, and calm, enjoying their jokes and arguments. He swallowed, and managed to pull on a smile.
Quietly, they went to work. Dean chewed on cold pizza while Castiel filled out his name, his address, his email, his phone number. The papers required his passport number, so he went to his room and picked it up, feeling disconnected from his own body, barely noticing that he was gone from Dean’s room before he was back in it and sitting on Dean’s bed to type out the numbers he needed.
“Woo!” yelled a voice from one side that Dean thought might be Donna, though he hadn’t heard her come in. He walked out onstage, feeling suddenly goofy and clumsy; he headed to stand beside Cas, but Jody was waving her hand to his left.
“Dean,” he said. Dean looked flushed, even a little dazed. His tie was askew. “Dean, wait, what - is this - is this just…” He struggled for the right word. Dean swallowed, and Castiel wanted to kiss his neck, kiss his throat, put his mouth to Dean’s skin and make Dean say his name.
“Right. Papers. Yeah.”
“I’ve got you,” Cas said, as Jody put a hand under his arm on the other side. “Come on, let’s move you back a little bit.”
He closed his eyes, and passed the time imagining himself going back to the city, being welcomed home. The bowing and scraping of the people who’d acted so mock-sad when they’d heard he’d been fired. The smile on Bartholomew’s face to see his favourite junior partner back in the game.
“Oh?”
His stomach sank. He’d read about the colour draining out of someone’s face, but he’d never thought that it would happen to him, and that he’d be able to physically feel it happening.
He pretended, even within the confines of his own mind, to be shocked at himself.
he knew what Dean might say. And yet –
“Tell-tale,” said Patience, sitting across from him. Todd stuck out his tongue. Castiel watched, trying to keep the amusement off his face. Todd was still new to Saint Crispin’s, only a few weeks into his time there.
“No, I – yeah. I mean, I – yeah, I want to,” Dean said, saying the last part to the floor. His chest felt as though it was going to crack open. He wanted to walk around the table between him and Cas, and drop to his knees, and just ask Cas with his eyes to touch him, anywhere, anyhow, gentle or not. “Just… I mean, look at us. Are we really gonna fit with any of that crap?”
“Whatever you need to do,” Dean said. “Hey, have you… has anyone called Cas come through here, by any chance? A guy?”
A Christmas party. A neighbourhood Christmas party, no less, judging by the faces Dean had seen walking in - Anna, Charlie, Gordon, and even Garth had got an invite despite continuing to show up to every function in aviators.
At least someone else looked as nervous as he did, though Kevin did also look about a century younger than Dean. He couldn’t be out of high school.
“Well, I was just wondering about, uh, the ace thing, actually. And the mask.”
shut up.”
Dean cleared his throat.
“It’s necessary for the trees to survive, isn’t it?” Castiel asked, making conversation as Dean indicated the way they should go and came up to walk beside him. “The network of deep roots.”
“Dean!” Cas reached up for the mask, but Jody pointed a finger at him.
He had no right. No right at all to feel that way. Dean had only ever been his friend.
“You’re calling me ass-headed,” he said.
Castiel turned, and through the syrup-slow air he slammed his hand against the bark of the dead white tree.
They sat quietly for a few seconds, and then a few more. Castiel felt something rising up in him, and he could have headed it off, but he decided to let himself say it.
Castiel wanted to hold Dean’s hand. It would be monumental, just the slightest of movements, just the
“That sounds perfect to me.”
“Yes. I do.”
Dean threw her a look. It was true that usually,
“Um,” Castiel shifted uncomfortably, “no. Ishim, from work. He owed me a favour before I left. So he’s lending me his car and driver for the day tomorrow.”
real -
Dean said nothing. For a while, the two of them sat still on the forest floor, just breathing. Castiel took the time to enjoy it. In and out. Smell of soil and leaves and sharp sap and musky animal.
“Did you know the people who lived here before me?”
Dean’s body was pressed against Castiel’s right side. The two of them were bound together in stillness. Castiel couldn’t turn to look at him, but he tried not to think of the revenant that was almost on him. If these were going to be his last moments, in the haze of dark and cold he wanted to be thinking of the warmth of Dean against him right then.
“I knew it wasn’t gonna be perfect, telling him about it,” Dean said, and he heard the disappointment in his own tone, and cringed. “Seriously. I know how lucky I am. I’m not taking it for granted.”
make him feel that way, because Castiel just saw him as a friend. A colleague. That was a
He was silent for several seconds. On instinct more than anything, Dean stayed quiet, let him think it through; when Cas did speak, it was with precision.
“Hello?”
“It’s just for you and Sam,” Mary said. “Castiel will be there for the ceremony.”
Castiel nodded. That made sense. The only thing that made any sense was that they’d each puked their guts out in the bathroom while the other was sleeping. That was a hangover. That was feeling gross after a night out. That was normal and unpleasant. That wasn’t…
Castiel managed a small smile, looking down at his steaming mug of tea.
“No…” Castiel thought about it, and then said again with more certainty, “No.”
After enough time under the steadiness of Castiel’s gaze, it seemed finally to sink in for Dean – the truth of it, the reality of it. Dean breathed out.
He was –
He said it jokingly, but when his gaze flicked back to Castiel’s face, his expression dropped. Castiel watched him, feeling Dean’s words needle at his anger. He held his temper in the same way he’d hold a white-hot and razor-sharp wire in his bare hand.
“Come to the audition,” Cas said. “I’ll be there.”
Charlie turned her phone around to show Dean the screen.
“Cas. Talk to me. Do you have something?”
He wanted to walk this palace hand-in-hand with Dean. And he wanted to pull on Dean’s hand to bring them to a stop, and then kiss Dean, shamelessly – against the wall of a huge, silent, elegant room. Or tucked into the shadow of a corridor. Or sitting on the floor of the empty ballroom, slowly.
“We’ve gathered to celebrate the union of Crown Prince Dean from the House of Winchester, Heir to the throne of United Corelia, and Duchess Lisa of Someria.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, feeling that smile climb back onto his face. There was no way to stop it. “Yeah, so, I did it.”
“Yes,” Castiel said again as Dean got up, taking away the temptation to lie down next to him. Probably for the best.
“Promise,” Dean said. “Hey, Cas?”
Dean watched as Cas’ expression changed. It went from slight confusion, to sudden horror – and finally settled on a kind of dry acceptance.
Castiel frowned.
Or to go to a bar and try to forget all about this – Jesus, that sounded good right about now. A strong drink or two or three should take the edge off, and even if it didn’t bring the floor back and stop him falling, at least he’d be happily oblivious to it.
” Cas sang softly. He reached for Dean’s hand, and Dean could feel his own face go soft and surprised and happy. “
Castiel dropped the topic, letting Dean’s handwave brush it away. He didn’t want to push too hard. He’d learned it didn’t really seem to work with Dean.
, not to this idea of who you think I might be because you've read some interviews and heard a few songs. I thought that if I told you, you might not see me anymore. I just… I think I pretended that Castiel wasn't real, because
“I do feel nauseous,” Castiel admitted.
Dean lifted his hands as though in surrender. The waiter swooped past, and Dean ordered the check; Cas patted his pockets, but Dean forestalled him.
“Are you,” Castiel said.
“I’m,” he tried, and then had to take another go at it. “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life.”
Castiel watched them start to laugh again, still holding onto each other.
“Bye,” Jo answered, and then slipped out of the door. The silence that followed her exit was sudden. Dean and Castiel looked at each other.
“What do you mean,” Dean said, seeming to be only half-concentrating, his eyes searching the hallway behind Charlie. “Hey, do you think we could get breakfast?”
“Damn. How does a junior partner afford that? Were the Angelus bonuses off the charts last year, or something? I’ve been looking at a Maserati but I think it’s about a quarter of the price of the Cullinan. Not everyone will know that, obviously, but for those who
“What? No, man, I –”
Dean’s brain took a second to catch up – and then he pressed his lips together to hold in a laugh. Cas tilted his head to one side.
“Oh.” Cas looked confused. “But… I told you…”
“Merry date-mas.” It was the first thing that came into Dean’s head and he’d blurted it out before he could stop himself, but as usual, Cas looked unruffled by the strangeness. The amusement on his face was subtle, like most things - expressions played over his features with the volume at about a three, usually, Dean thought - but it was definitely there.
Castiel smiled at him, and nodded.
“Don’t hate her.”
“Anyway,” Cas said bracingly - and then the next song came on, and his face went oddly still. Dean frowned, turning towards the stage; a young man was standing there, looking pale and shiny and excited, grasping the mic, and swaying to the first notes of a Castiel song.
“Well. I mean... it changes things a bit,” Sam said, and Dean’s stomach dropped, but Sam wasn’t done. “Like... I’m not gonna ignore that you told me… and never bring it up again like nothing ever happened. Unless you want me to? But if you’re asking about whether we’re cool, like, that’s not even in question. I think it’s awesome.” There was a pause, filled with a slight rush of static. “You’re my brother. Of course I think it's awesome.”
When Dean swung around sharply, Castiel tapped at the fourth finger on his left hand. He’d left his own wedding ring in the bathroom, on the shelf, but Dean was still wearing his.
“I think I heard that Taylor Swift song,” Dean said.
“You’re cold. We should… we should stop.”
“You can, though,” Castiel said.
Dean just wanted to see Castiel’s eyes light up again, see his hands move. He wanted to see Castiel poke his tongue ever so slightly out of his mouth as he concentrated. He wanted to watch as Castiel stroked his hand down the spine of his book – slowly, and lightly, but with obvious care –
“Your Highness,” Castiel answered, with the little inclination of the head that tradition dictated.
For now, though, he just had to play nice enough with his host to ensure he’d be invited to the next party.
“Oh! Kal-El.” Cas turned back to Dean with a smile. “I’ve never read the comics, but someone once sent me some fanart in a letter with me as Superman, and she labelled it Cal-El.” He turned back towards his records. “It took me half an hour of Googling to figure out what she meant.”
“I never reveal my sources.”
, she said.
But no - he was a part of the organisation. They had been a family to him when he had, himself, been lost in the Underlight. They cared for him. The least he could do was wear their colours when he guarded the streets in the way that they’d taught him.
“But you know,” Castiel said in a hurry, before he could think twice and stop himself, “that if you really don’t want to marry Lisa, you don’t have to do that either. You don’t have to be married at all, if you don’t –”
Castiel took in a breath, and opened his mouth.
“You’re a nerd. But thanks.” She glanced back down at her phone. “Okay, I think it’s just this way…”
Salt.
they were separated.
“It’s just a... project I’m working on,” Dean said. “It’ll be over on the 30th, and then everything’s going back to normal. You’re gonna have to put up with this face being around for a while yet.”
“I look like a goddamn idiot. Who’s totally starstruck,” Dean said. Charlie opened her mouth, obviously trying to figure out how to reply, but he added, “That is kind of accurate, though. So I’m not mad. Just kinda… jeez. It was so obvious.”
Castiel swallowed hard.
They’d talked. They’d actually spoken.
“Even bigger night, though,” Ash said, and Castiel could hear the leer in his voice. He felt himself go cold, even in the steam of the sauna.
Dean snorted when he read Charlie’s text, and shot back a quick reply.
, came the retort.
The whining gasp of air became a scream, an immediate scream that tore into Castiel. He fell to his knees, his hand scraping down the bark – and then with a force that hit his stomach in a rippling wave, he was pushed backwards and away.
And the look Dean had given him, on the plane, while they’d been cramped into the galley together…
It felt as though he’d been running and running and running and his legs had been aching and he hadn’t been able to stop or to feel it, until this moment, right now, in his car. He was suddenly aware how heavy it had been sitting on him, how much of himself he’d had to give just so that he and he alone chose when Sam found out the truth. He could feel himself choking up, stupidly. It had been so goddamn painfully much, and he hadn’t talked about it with anyone. He couldn’t have. Or maybe he could, but he hadn’t known how.
"And the kid behind the door…?"
“This might be totally out of nowhere, but, uh. Do you - do you wanna…” A large part of Dean wanted to just upend the milkshake in his hand over his own head and walk out. It seemed easier. It seemed more fitting for a guy like him. But Castiel was looking at him questioningly. “Do you wanna make this… like… a date?”
“Sir, I work as a secretary at a realtor’s office in New York city, but I imagine if they’ve begun work, it means they have the permits or whatever it is you need to cut down a tree in a forest in Maine,” said the woman. “Was there anything else I could help you with today? If you want to start the preliminary process of making a sale, I’d be happy to –”
Castiel sat in his apartment, scrolling listlessly through his phone. He’d tried to stop doing this recently. The hours he flipped down the wishing well of his Instagram feed just weren’t rewarding him with the perfect life he wished for, and at a certain point it was time to stop making the wishes. But even though he’d put his social media apps in a folder marked
“You sure, kid?”
“Am I up to…”
“Well, it’s not the Lawrence, Kansas skyline, is it,” Dean said.
“Hey,” he said, and she put a hand on his arm. Dean fought down the urge to draw away.
There was a silence. Dean pressed the back of his closed hand to his mouth. He wasn't moving, but somewhere deep inside himself he was shaking, absolutely shaking. He’d done it - he’d done it, he’d
It’s happening, he thinks. It’s happening. We’re the same. We’re the same.
Because society was broken and some people had no way to pay for the things that they needed to stay alive, while others lived lives of splendour and plenty in the Up, frittering away credits on parties and gold jewellery and shoes and bags, he further reminded himself, and then decided to stop before he really did burn the insulin.
“No, no… no. OK, listen. Honestly, the main reason I haven’t been telling you, it’s actually… it’s not because I really believed you were gonna wanna cut me off and never speak to me again.”
“You’d have to ask him,” Castiel said, without rudeness.
“It’s not,” he said, “a date.” It was creepy that she’d even say that, given how much he’d been thinking about it.
The stare between them lengthened, until Sam cleared his throat.
All of Dean’s carefully placed anger is gone, suddenly, in his shock. There’s no performance, no strategy, in the way that he steps closer and looks utterly bewildered.
He saw the lights on the tree come back on, the glow spilling out of the window and onto the snow on the ground, painting it gold. Dean waited a whole two seconds before leaning round and switching them off again.
“Help her,” Castiel repeated.
“Looking for you,” Castiel said. “Yes - yes, I was. I have something of yours that you… left here, last time.”
The man had started to look around the room, his expression tense.
“And I’m out,” came Sam’s voice. Castiel’s eyes snapped open to see Sam getting to his feet, towel wrapped firmly around his waist, and heading for the door.
him. Everything was a flurry, a frenetic whirl of black, an impossible scream. It was shadows laughing. It was eyes hollowing. It was skin paling, weakening. It was rush, rush, rush, and press, press, press, and fear – it was fear. And he was never going to get out. He was never going to be free of it.
“Uh huh… right. Well…” Dean scratched the back of his head. “Good that it’s gone, then?”
Today? Dean still hadn’t given Sam a call. He should’ve done it yesterday, done it this morning, but he’d put it off and put it off, like an idiot.
“We can do that,” Castiel said. “Can’t we?”
“Was it - so, but like, uh. So like, when we were talking, all that stuff we talked about - was that real? Or just you pretending to be normal?” Dean asked. “Do you even keep bees? I just… it feels like I don't even know who I met last night, and like...”
“You guys were pretty far gone,” he said.
“We have to be. Jesus, Cas. Don’t make me lose you for this.”
“You know. The whole schtick. Lovey-dovey crap.” Dean mumbled it, aware that even in describing it he sounded ridiculous.
“Okay,” she said. “Look. I’m being harsh right now. I don’t wanna be too much, here. I’m gonna go cool off in a sec but I want to say my piece, like – like I’m just gonna try to channel Uncle Iroh right now, because someone’s gotta tell you, okay, like – if this whole thing really is no big deal to you, then you’re right, you’re both better off not trying to do anything more about it. But I think that this is a big deal to you? I think you do give a crap about him? I think you want something to happen between you guys. And I think if you gave a crap about yourself, like
“There are pictures? Of that night?”
“I think we can make it work,” Castiel said. Dean squeezed.
had been mouthed right into Cas’ watching eyes, when the song had been over.
“Didn’t much know what to say,” he mumbled. “You just kinda… I mean, I walked into your kitchen, you turned around, next thing I know I’ve got two human legs. I didn’t even have to say anything about who I was. You just kinda decided for me.”
the blue lit up and happy enough to crack in two, suddenly, as though being in Dean’s space, dancing out here in the cold and empty parking lot to the sound of Bruce Springsteen from inside was everything he’d ever wanted.
“I wanted to talk about your contract,” Bobby said.
Dean had never told Castiel the name of the lawyer from the Underlight. The only way Castiel could have found out was if one of the other two people at the scene - the lawyer herself, or the Angel - had told him.
Dean as he truly was, with his hooves struggling a little for purchase until he stepped onto the red rug and found some friction. His chest was heaving. When he saw Castiel standing on the stairs, he grabbed the bannister.
“You look more nervous than my dog before a bath,” she said, reaching for a box and a makeup brush. “His name’s Caligula, he was adopted, won’t answer to anything else. Now, don’t worry, hon. I’m just gonna give you a little dusting of powder to make sure you don’t shine on camera. No glitter, I swear.”
Movie? Dean’s worn-out brain struggled for a second, and then light dawned. That was right. There was a one-off showing of Tombstone this Sunday, part of a Western Weekend at their local movie theatre. Dean had asked a few other people – his brother, a few of his friends, even his other coworker Charlie – but none of them had wanted to go. As a last resort before just deciding to go solo, Dean had asked Castiel. The two of them only really talked about work-related things when they talked at all, and Castiel was a weird mixture of dorky and aloof, but Dean had marginally preferred the idea of going with him to going alone.
Or perhaps Dean just wanted to sit together in silence. That would be alright, too. Companionship in the quiet. When he thought about it, Castiel knew it would be more than enough just to sit by Dean in a bar and drink together, knowing that they were both choosing to be there. Even if they didn’t say a single word the whole evening, even if Dean didn’t so much as look at him the whole night. They could spend the date speechlessly. But it would be a date. It would be an acknowledgement. Maybe it would ease a little of the longing that Castiel felt and felt and felt from Dean, burning.
The buildings along the streets were quintessentially European, long rows of tall apartment buildings all joined together. When he reached a slightly shabby-looking building with a sign over the door that read only
“C’mon. I’m gonna see it sometime.”
“I said it, when we were in the theatre. But I don't think he believed me.”
“Or not,” Dean said, “if you have an offshore account.”
She kept talking as Castiel’s brain tried to grind into action. There was no reason why Dean shouldn’t be sleeping in his room. It was fine, he could tell her.
A bit of shampoo got into Dean’s eye, and he blinked hard to get it out.
“You said
“Here?” Dean looks confused.
And then - then Castiel had checked that it would just be a quick thing, and Dean had tried to reassure him, but he'd been messed up somehow by the kiss and he'd known he hadn't sounded fully convincing, and Castiel had been able to sense his hesitation, and he had pulled away. He’d decided going further wasn't worth the risk of Dean possibly getting attached and awkwardly expecting more from their encounter, and had sent him away like a naughty puppy.
“What you said was true,” he said. “I had no idea what I was talking about, singing about love.”
Dean snorted.
“Nope,” Dean said, but he was still smiling. “It’s a mess in here. But I’ll get her working.”
did - he had to come out, too.
“Yes, that’s correct.”
Castiel watched as Dean’s expression broke into a smile. A true smile, with his eyes lit up, with his shoulders loose. He turned away from the crowd to look at his brother; Sam met his gaze with an expression on his face that burst past happiness into relief and outright joy. Castiel could feel his heart in his throat. Gordon’s hand was still on his arm, squeezing slightly, and Castiel thought that maybe he was being asked whispered questions – but he didn’t care. Dean had stopped the wedding. Dean looked
That was more than something.
“I didn’t know that you wanted to,” Dean said, his voice rough and low, clearly fighting embarrassment to try to speak.
“Uh,” she said. “You mean, about the wedding?”
Dean frowned.
“We can’t,” he said.
“Think faster,” Castiel snapped, knowing it was unfair, but his heart was pulsing hard and fast and the room was spinning just a little and everything ached and he wanted to sleep.
Castiel searches his face. Just as he’s about to say something more, Dean breaks their stare, glancing around at the plants nearest him as a light breeze ruffles at them.
“– and then she said,
“Is it the hair,” Castiel said flatly.
This is the place Central should be. If the Angels weren’t holding Central back, this is the place it
Dean’s mouth closed.
“I might,” he said, and held his arms a little out from his body. “How long can I contain this much raw aggression, you know?”
“Oh, God,” Sam said. “So, what, you just
“Doing the right thing about what?” Castiel said.
Castiel stepped across the room towards him. He could feel his heart pounding again. Images pushed at his brain - pictures of what might happen, what could happen between them. He tried to shove them back, like he always did, like he had ever since that night on the roof when they’d shared a moment and both admitted that they didn’t always know what to talk about at parties, and something had shifted, and suddenly Castiel had felt hot and somehow - somehow with an appetite, though he didn’t want to eat or drink, and - and he’d left Dean standing there on the roof, made a quick exit. Ever since, he’d pictured a moment like this.
“Here he is,” said a voice that still sounded a little thick with drink. Castiel blinked, and saw that in the car with him was the full list of invitees to the bachelor party. Dean was sitting all the way down the other end of the car, only the tense jaw behind his smile giving away that he wasn’t happy.
“Hey,” Cas said, and he lifted up his mask, and peeked out at Dean from under it.
“It doesn’t matter,” Dean said, with a little burst of impatience that pulled him a little further back into himself than before.
And Dean didn’t feel that bond with him, Castiel knew. That had been proven when Dean had shrugged away Castiel’s touch at the end of the night.
“Dean?”
Castiel turned to stare at him. Then he reached into one of the pockets of his suit, and retrieved his own stack of insulin patches, holding them up for the Hunter to see. From the shadows of the hood came a snort.
“You think I don’t know?”
Dean woke up and got into his clean shower. He could feel nerves writhing in his stomach every time he thought about meeting Castiel, so he sang loudly to take his mind of it – odd bits of his favourite songs, seguing into the latest hits he’d heard played at the mall, skipping the lyrics he didn’t know with vague hums.
Castiel thought for a second.
A dead white tree in the green-gold forest, thought Castiel. Not quite the same, but a part of each other.
he sang.
Castiel didn’t say anything. He had no idea how to justify the rush of adrenaline-fuelled certainty that had struck him at three o’clock on Tuesday morning, when he’d been browsing for places and had come upon a listing for an absurdly cheap house in the middle of nowhere. Among all the overpriced or undersized offerings on every website he’d checked, that one house alone had seemed palatable.
“Claire’s been talking about setting fire to the cathedral,” Jody said. Patience, who had been grabbing herself something out of the fridge, rolled her eyes at Castiel as she walked out of the door.
“They were usually already at the restaurant waiting for me,” Castiel pointed out. “So it was either go on the date, or leave them waiting there alone.”
“Do you need a ride down to your new house, then? I’m free this weekend.”
He didn’t want to think about it. Knew that it was dangerous to let his thoughts linger even for the briefest moment on any of the memories from last night. He knew how easily his mind liked to latch onto memories with Dean, and hold them too close, take them too seriously, read things into them that weren’t real.
Of course, the organisation would probably also like to think that the aforementioned operative wasn’t taking unscheduled trips to the Underlight to attempt to provide help and order to the citizens down here. The organisation would definitely like to think that he wasn’t associating with a vigilante. But that didn’t slow Castiel’s steps as he ran towards the building where he’d located the raised heartbeats. He wondered how the Hunter would get there, and if it would be slower or faster than Castiel himself. Somehow, he always found a way to get there in time to help.
“It’ll be good,” Cas said. He looked at Dean, and smiled. “Ready to go?”
“I missed you, too.” It was so much truth in so few words that Dean felt his own voice give. “Cas, I… fuck. Is it too late now? For this?”
“Yes.” Castiel says it bluntly, to try to shave off the emotion, make it easier to talk about. Dean’s hand still doesn’t move. Castiel can feel each place Dean’s fingers are digging in slightly through the thin material of his t-shirt. His heart is pounding and he wants to be able to turn it off, quiet it down, hear Dean’s heart instead in the way he could when he had his grace. He wants it with a sudden acuteness, a pang of loss.
The drive to work was definitely more pleasant on a solid eight and a half hours of sleep. When he reached the teachers’ lounge that morning, he grabbed his usual coffee – but not before he’d waved good morning to a few other faculty members, and complimented the school’s head secretary on his new haircut.
“We should have this conversation in private,” Mary said. But now it was Dean who was stepping forward, his eyes on Lisa.
“It’s not a big deal,” Dean said, hating himself even more for selling himself out, undercutting himself.
In a little polite, decorative flurry, the congregation took their seats once more. Missouri looked from Dean to Lisa, and then out to look at faces in the crowd in front of her. She was rock-steady, calm, her voice sweet and thoughtful.
Castiel narrowed his eyes, while inside he was gaping. He had no idea how to respond. He tried to shape a few words, but none of them quite came out his mouth.
“You’re sure this has nothing to do with Castiel,” Charlie pressed, as they wandered. Dean shrugged. It was unusual for Charlie to prod at him this much for information he wasn’t volunteering. He must be genuinely starting to worry her.
Outside the car, he could see a couple of the other mechanics moving around, finding tools. He hoped none of them would come over to see if everything was okay; he was just about handling having one of the very few deep and meaningful conversations he’d had with Charlie, and if they got cut off, he knew they’d never get back into the zone.
Didn’t Dean have a choice? Castiel wondered. But then, Castiel had never known his own parents. Raised in Saint Crispin’s, and as close as he was to Jody and Donna, he had no idea what it would be like to have his mother ask him to do something like this. Maybe it didn’t feel like much of a choice at all.
Someone Dean knew turned and waved at him, and then beckoned him over. Dean smiled, and made an effort to stop fidgeting with his clothes as he walked over.
It bounced off and rolled away undramatically. Castiel stared after it.
Maybe Castiel just wouldn’t come. It would almost be a relief at this point. Well – that was to say, Dean would be miserable, but at least he’d be a familiar and lonely kind of miserable, and he’d be able to just go home and be familiarly lonely and miserable in a nest of increasing piles of junk food and mounting dirt.
“It, uh. You know, it...  doesn’t always work that the people you’re most honest with are the people you care about most,” he said. “Actually, first person I came out to was a drunk old lady at a bar.”
“He’s not in his room,” Charlie said, snapping out the words. “We’ve looked for him everywhere. I’m going to have to call the local authorities, and –”
“And did you?”
still breathe. It wasn’t the revenant. He was fine.
“Where’s your bread? What about any meat – are you vegetarian? ‘Cause you need way more protein, like lentils and that crap, if you’re not gonna eat animal products…”
“No, I - I need - I can’t give you the bag, I can’t - it’s got my -”
“You know they either don’t like you or they’re scared of you, right?” the Hunter was saying casually. “There’s no point trying to make pals down here. They’ll never trust you.”
Was he going to leave? He’d told Dean a few times that he wasn’t going to, and he meant it when he said it, but – but he had lived in New York for so long. It had been his home, with all its rattles and rumbles. He’d carved himself a niche there, painstakingly. If the city called him back, could he say no? To stay out here in whatever strange fairytale this was, with no money and no job prospects and only a disappearing neighbour for occasional company?
“I do want to tell you about it. It’s just - it’s complicated.”
“Cool. See you.”
“He wouldn’t,” said Cas.
was also weird. Like, formal… too formal, or something. Did you screw up?” She said it conversationally, and Dean felt his affection for her rush back. He shrugged.
Castiel spoke earnestly, fluently.
He slurped again.
Things like look in this guy's - Cas’ - eyes, when he turned back to Dean.
“You,” Dean agreed.
Dean’s heart begged, against all good reason, against the circumstances, against sanity itself.
“And Gilda…?”
Sam snorted.
“You’re sure?” Jody said, with a definite note of doubt behind her professional tone. “There are lots of great Castiel songs that I can recommend. What about
“The kids? Who cares about the kids,” Dean said. “If
“But then he came out to me as aromantic when he broke up with me and I realised that all along I’d just been kinda trying to give him what it felt like he really wanted. It’s like that, kind of. My gut knew first.”
"I don't know," he said. "Maybe he didn't give it
“Meet me first thing tomorrow,” he said. “Early, before anyone gets into school.”
dance terribly, all hands in the wrong places, dorky and awkward - and Dean should have been put off by it, he knew, but there was something about the way Cas moved, the odd self-consciousness of it that gently transformed into odd unselfconsciousness as the song went on, that he
“Your brother’s name is Sam?” he asked. Dean looked confused by the change of subject, but he nodded.
“What’s the genre again? Ah, crap, right. Country. Uh, gimme… you got Steve Earle?”
“Yes. It’s unusual, I know…”
“You say that like it’d be a bad thing,” Dean said.
“It’s starting to get dark,” they said.
Dean’s expression was a mirror for Castiel’s – confusion, horror, each desperately seeking an answer in the other’s face.
“Yeah-huh.”
“See you later.”
“Whoa… careful.” Dean’s foot slipped out from under him, and he only managed to keep his balance by grabbing onto a parking meter that happened to be close by.
“Cas… what do you want from me,” Dean said. “Am I supposed to tell you to be responsible and go back in there and do your job? Am I supposed to help you run riot for the day? What is it you want me to be?”
“Hey,” said the Hunter. “I said, that was a nice act.”
“So, you can talk to people who already know about Cas’ identity,” Jody said, whipping the papers away once they’d been signed. “But you can’t tell anyone who doesn’t already know. And if you try to make money from the information in any way, if you tip anyone off regarding Cas’ whereabouts…”
“I’m fine… ugh.”
And his face was always so soft in sleep. Castiel tilted his head. For a moment, while Dean rested, it felt safe to think it again.
“Mmph,” said a sleepy voice on the other end of the phone.
"I'll come back for him. This one I really will take to the Angel base."
“Not bad?”
“What did you get me?”
For a second he sat still, assessing the damage. Nothing broken.
Dean groaned.
“Everyone except me,” Castiel said.
“If Dean doesn’t actually want to get married to Lisa…” he said to the Queen, and then let the sentence hang delicately.
“Hello?”
Castiel, whose mind felt like a worn-out sponge, tried to prepare himself mentally to fend off any awkward questions as he turned to Charlie. She watched after Dean for a few seconds, and then looked up at him.
“Oh, okay.” Anna smiled, looking a little disappointed - and then her expression shifted into curiosity. “Is everything… alright?”
“Saw you reach for your brother when you were falling,” John grunted. “Don’t do that. If you two’re on your own and both of you go down, you’re both dead. If Sam’s still up, he can go for help.”
“Dean, I –”
“No!” she said. “No – Jesus, no.”
“I think it’s just a fracture,” the Angel said to her gravely. “I’d go to a med-bay as soon as possible.”
“Why not,” Claire shot back, so quickly that Castiel knew she’d been expecting him to challenge her.
“Why did you help me,” he said, still in a barely-there whisper. “How did you know… how…”
“Well… we’ll be outside!” she hinted heavily, and then let the door click close again.
Castiel was going down the stairs two at a time – and then came up short.
“You almost sound like you believe me,” he said.
Castiel’s body ached. Everything felt painful and dried-out and tired. He stumbled back into the bedroom. Where he was, what had happened, why Dean was asleep in the bed – none of it seemed to matter. He fell back onto the mattress, and closed his eyes. Only sleep could save him.
At a run, far faster than two legs could have carried him, he fled the clearing in front of the house. Castiel watched after him, phone still held out uselessly.
“Really?”
As they went, Dean could feel some kind of tension from Cas - but not the good kind that he was used to, not the comfortable
Still, Dean thought, at least this meant he
They parted, Donna and Jody heading backstage and Dean following Cas down the stairs and out towards the lobby, snagging his coat and the box of donuts on the way. They passed Hannah in the lobby, who gave them both a little wave.
a mega-fan that he’d literally changed his name to be the same as Castiel the singer’s?
“Are they coming?” Dean asked.
“If those things happen, it’s nothing to do with me and I’m sure they’re done only when necessary.”
Dean was looking at Castiel as though he wanted to say something, but didn’t know what. And that didn’t matter, Castiel thought dizzily. That was alright. Because now there was time. They had more time.
Cas came to stand by Dean, and because he could, Dean leaned forwards and kissed him again. His heart raced as he did it. Cas kissed him back, and Dean felt as though gravity probably shouldn’t be holding him down at this point.
Dean could feel his face light up. All this crap, the whole sham, might actually prove to be worth it.
say that around him. It’s ammunition for his plan to raze the palace and build a clean energy factory, or something.”
Sunburn, he reminds himself, is more uncomfortable than the growing look of mixed amusement and judgement in Dean’s eyes. Even on a cloudy day, his skin will burn if he’s outside for a long time. Something he learned the hard way after becoming human.
Because your business is just between us.”
“Sorry,” Castiel said, already backing out again through the curtain.
His head tilted forward slightly. His eyes dropped, just for a fraction of a moment, from Castiel’s eyes to his lips, and then back up.
“If I had what I wanted,” he said, “you’d be here.” After a pause, he rolled his eyes. “I’m sure that’s news to you. Like, wow, right? Not as though I’ve ever asked, after all.” Another silence, and then he said, “But you know, I – it’s not that I just want to… fix it, or… finish things off. It’s not… I’m not…” He pressed his lips together, smiled wryly. “Jesus. I hope you can’t hear this. I’m not making any sense. I’m just trying to say, I want you here, man. I want you here to stay.”
“Hi,” said a familiar face when Dean reached the theatre and walked into the lobby - and then the face broke into a smile when Dean held out a brimming box of donuts. “Well, hey! Thank you!”
“I have never,” she said coolly, “experienced anything like this.”
It was a lot easier to think about this mystery than it was to wonder why Castiel was so repulsed by the idea of Dean having any actual feelings for him. Was just the potential of him being around for longer than a night really so terrible? Why?
“You - what?”
“By the way, you never actually said. Are you up to date with the new research on the artifact? We should probably still try to find the damn thing.”
“Looking good,” Dean says.
That stung.
“Well,” Cas said, and as he thought about it, Dean threw a quick look over his shoulder and was relieved to see that Ash had taken the hint and made himself scarce. Dean had no idea if anything was actually happening between him and this guy, Cas - or what sort of thing it might be - but he wanted the space to find out. “Well, no, not necessarily. Anything you want to recommend.”
“People put up notices on the board over there,” Gordon said, nodding towards a cork board scattered with papers that was up on the wall back by the door. “I think there are a few people looking for someone to do some heavy lifting.”
Now Cas looked confused.
“So,” Lisa said, when they were far enough from the car that it was no longer visible between the trees. “Is this a famous place to walk in Mariport?”
Dean took a long, long gulp of his coffee. When the chair across from him at the table scraped backwards and someone sat on it, he didn’t even look at them.
“Let’s get that pizza in the oven,” he said bracingly, gesturing Cas through to the kitchen, hefting his own share of the grocery bags in his hands. “Come on.” He led the way through, pushing open the door to the kitchen and leaving it wide open to try to hide the way the paint was peeling in that top corner. “It’s not much. But tomorrow or something when I text you like, hey, I’m in the kitchen making dinner, you can, like, picture it in your head. Exactly where I am and what it looks like.” He was rambling, filling up the quiet, as he pushed open the door to the kitchen. “Here we go. Fridge… oven… yeah, standard stuff.”
Until then, he was apparently going to stay in this poky little theatre with its tiered dark seats and its intimate little stage, and he was going to have to deal with that.
That glimpse of himself as kind of good-looking that Dean had seen when he’d gone into school wearing his nice jeans – Castiel must have seen that even before Dean had been trying to dress up. Because Castiel had said
There was the smell of magnolias in the air, along with a lasting brush of sea-salt and a hint of laundry powder as they passed a laundromat. Castiel closed his eyes and breathed in deeply.
“Why did you get two kinds of milk?” Dean said, putting them in the fridge door.
This time, the silence rang. Castiel found himself staring at his plate, his mouth working for words, trying to understand the question. Why would Claire be asking about him when they had been talking about the wedding? He’d never spoken to anyone at Saint Crispin’s about his feelings for Dean. Were they really so obvious that Claire had been able to pick up on them, just from when he and Dean had come together to the orphanage? It seemed like it.
From somewhere a few feet above, still, Dean felt a lump rise to his throat.
Cas reached up a hand, and gently – so gently – put it against Dean’s cheek.
“Well,” said Cas, “thank you.”
“Okay,” Cas said, tearing off the mask, his hair ruffled as he threw it down to the floor. “I thought today we could go over some basic mic technique to start with. Maybe some breathing technique, too. It’s one thing knowing the song, but being able to sing it into the mic and have it sound right is a thing on its own, so I thought I could give you some tips.”
“What,” he said.
“You don’t look happy,” she said.
The dark blue door swung open with Castiel still standing in the street.
“Was it Hester?”
“Yeah,” Dean replied. “It’s okay.”
Ahead of him, he saw Mary half-start to her feet.
She sounded the same kind of determined that she’d once sounded when she’d insisted she’d be fine to go to her ex’s birthday party in their second year of college. The night had ended with a lot of crying in the back of a taxi, if Dean remembered right. He didn’t bring it up, though. He just shrugged and kept looking out over the view.
“Is this because of what happened last year?” Dean caught Sam saying. “Dean, I know getting cheated on was…”
“Cas.”
“Or, I don’t know. Maybe I just want to.”
He sharpened his resolve.
Castiel sat up straighter, and stared down at it. It was from Milton and Milton. And the subject line simply read,
“Won’t they be upset?”
“I don’t know.” Dean was watching the tree, his expression hard to read. Castiel wanted to reach out and take his hand, like on the night the revenant had come to his house.
“Axe first, ask questions later, as you always say,” Cas said, nodding, and Dean snorted, unable to hold up the pretence through the pun.
“I dunno,” he said, and it came out as more of a mumble.
What was actually going to happen would be simpler. They were going to go their separate ways at the airport, and that would be it. Castiel would text Dean when the annulment came through, and he’d be present at the wedding. And then it would be over.
“Ah,” she said. “Yes. Turns out, I have something way more important than the blanket.”
“If you wanted a poster,” Cas said as they walked away, sounding as though he found it distasteful, “there are always some around. You didn’t have to pay for it.”
“You don’t know what?”
“Yeah. You get a rating out of ten chilis. Every teacher does.”
Castiel felt his thudding heart kick up a notch. He couldn’t let anything slip. Neither of them could. Mary was kind and she was understanding, but she was also the ruler of a country and Dean was the son who was supposed to make a good match when he married. She wouldn’t be angry if she found out, Castiel didn’t think. She’d just be sad, and disappointed, and that would break Dean all the more.
“I’m out,” she said.
“I know.” Castiel did know. He’d just let himself start hoping again, without even meaning to. He’d got it into his head that he was the only one stopping something happening between them, because of his talk with Mary and her explanation of why Dean had to marry Lisa. But he’d been wrong.
They grinned at each other. As the sun began to truly set, they took snaps of each other posing in front of the tower, some of them trying to look nice, others just derpy selfies with their tongues out. After a while, they went and sat on the steps to the back of the square, and Jo pulled up Instagram.
“The mystery is too alive,” Cassie said. “It could die a bit. I’d be okay with that.”
“It was perfect,” Cas said.
They were silent for a long time. Castiel thought about the Hunter. Thought about how he worried over getting his suit fixed, got his insulin from a dealer, seemed to live a cheaper and harder life than Castiel did. He wondered how much of the Hunter’s existence was given over to trying to make things right in the Underlight. He wondered how much of his own was, really. He felt as though he was doing his best, but it couldn’t be enough, because it wasn’t fixed. Everything down here was still so, so broken.
Dean could hear himself saying in his head.
It was worrying, he reflected, how much even the mental picture of it brought him some temporary relief from the twisting flurry of anger in his chest. It would be something to
“Yeah, I…” He trailed off. He had to give back the wallet, and he knew it. But it was something concrete tying him to Castiel, and he didn’t want to give it up.
Their ride pulled to a graceful stop and Dean was the first out, quickly shoving his arms through his satchel straps with a forcefulness that was almost aggressive and then turning impatiently back towards the car.
They stared at it together.
“Castiel, you’re comfortable with that?”
“Belief,” Castiel said, starting to move away. He didn’t know how much longer Dean would be able to hold them off at the work site. It was a miracle that they hadn’t started already.
"You never fire that gun of yours," Castiel said eventually, just to say something. "I've never seen you do it."
which would probably just make most people laugh. “Batman’s bi.” He cleared his throat. He needed to finish the voice message. “Uh - uh, yeah. Anyway, I’ve gotta get to bed, got an early start tomorrow. But I’ll, uh, yeah. See you on Thursday for the rehearsal?”
“... No,” Castiel said.
“Group night? Cas, I booked us a fancy dinner, I was dressed up –”
“I just wanted it,” Dean said.
“C’mon,” he said, wanting to get them through the awkward moment. “Grab some cookies. Let me show you the rest of the place, at least. It’s all pretty much the same, but whatever. Bathroom’s in there.” Dean led him past it, and towards the bedroom.
Enough was
“Oh?”
A beat, and then –
He ran a hand through his hair and looked down at what he was wearing as he walked through to the door. The pyjamas he’d brought with him to the forest were too nice for Dean’s taste, he thought. Dean would roll his eyes at the way that they matched. Castiel himself looked at them for the first time with a slight wrinkle in his nose. He’d thought they looked smart when he’d bought them.
It was still unreal. He couldn’t connect those people’s words with himself, his own singing, his own lived experience of the auditions - but he didn’t mind them all talking about it so much, now he’d seen them do it. It was kind of… kind of nice, in a way. They were just people getting excited about something.
“If you’d like.”
“Yeah,” Cassie said with a laugh, pushing his hand away, “it is, asshole. That’s why I’m not letting you take me down with you.”
“What are you thinking?” Cas asked, jerking Dean out of his reverie. He seemed to have picked up on the serious tone of Dean’s thoughts, because his expression held no hint of humour.
“You can just use my straw,” he said. “It’s alright.”
“Yes?” they ventured.
But Castiel had said yes to him once, when he’d been a mess.
“... Okay,” Dean said. “But what am I supposed to –”
“I don’t know,” she said.
Sam made a miserable face. Their breaths were puffs of air between them. Underfoot was the hiss and crunch of melting, slushy snow.
Maybe there was a kinder world where being Dean’s husband meant that Castiel could take off his slippers and his dressing gown and move around the bed, and slide under the covers, and slip his arm around Dean’s waist. And Dean would grumble in protest, but he’d shuffle backwards so that they were lying together, and when Castiel put a kiss to the back of Dean’s neck, Dean would tense and then relax into the touch – and then reach back a hand to push it clumsily through Castiel’s hair, and Castiel would grab it and lock their fingers together, and Dean would turn around so that they were facing each other, and –
“So? Really?” The Hunter said. “You can’t see what it is about an Angel that might make them just a little bit less likely to trust you?”
Dean looked up at him, hardly daring to hope -
“Okay,” Dean says, as though slightly and genuinely concerned for Castiel’s sanity.
“You’ve been disinterested in pretty much every party we’ve ever been to,” he said. “Third one probably included. So let’s say that counts.”
“You’re out of your mind if you think that, though,” Dean said.
“No. I just don’t know what to tell you.”
“Amends,” Gabriel repeated, non-committal. “What do you mean?”
“You know how that went last time.” He looked over at the far wall, with its dent still preserved in it.
And quite suddenly, Dean couldn’t take it anymore.
They reached the welcoming party as the cameras flashed and clicked. The royals of United Corelia had never been ones for rituals or formality as long as Castiel had known them, but the bachelors still lined up to briefly pay their respects the Queen, who was wearing a chic coat and a smile as she greeted her sons and their friends one by one.
Dean sat down at the edge of the stage, legs dangling. In front of him, Cas handed the laptop back to Jody.
“Stop it!”
Dean muttered sarcastically in Castiel’s ear as they walked.
Castiel couldn’t. He couldn’t look at it. He set the pictures back down on the sofa between himself and Dean.
“I’m surprised every day,” he said, “that I still want you just as much as I did on the day we stopped talking. I kept waiting for it to fade. Waiting for myself to finally realise you weren’t coming back. But it was like it didn’t matter. Like the time passing didn’t matter. Like it couldn’t touch us.”
“Um,” Castiel said. “I thought this would… I don’t understand. When you sent those messages, I thought it meant that you… that you felt…” His voice trailed off.
The Austin landscape slipped past the windows, feeling frail and unreal compared to the little world of the two of them inside the car. They weren’t talking, weren’t even looking at each other, but they were
Whatever, he thought. It felt good right now.
“Dean,” Charlie said, her voice somehow jarringly loud and very far away, “you could’ve actually told Bobby I was coming. You know he hates it when I just turn up out of the blue. I had to promise him I’ll help him with the website again before he’d let me come find you.”
“Maybe we can just tell your mother that it’s not what it looks like?” Castiel said, following a few steps behind Dean, who was striding through the doors of the palace and into the hall.
“No, I – you do,” Castiel said. “You do. You look good.”
Castiel half-glanced over his shoulder, just for a fraction of a fraction of a moment – and left.
“I thought you could do it. Your belief. It’s strong.”
“Back off,” the figure on the ground said, clearly trying and failing to sound authoritative. “I’m a lawyer. If you don’t back off, I’ll -”
Castiel said nothing. After an awkward pause, Hannah said,
Dean could hear Cas warming to his theme, building up a head of steam, and he couldn’t have explained why exactly it made him so happy, but he was beaming into the blue-grey quiet of his apartment.
Dean stared at her for a second. She’d been paying far more attention to him than he’d given her credit for. Cared about him, to be seeing this stuff. He felt a surge of affection for her, at the same time as sticky embarrassment at being noticed.
Castiel waited for Gabriel to gather his thoughts, but he seemed to be lost for words.
The lights came back on.
“But… something’s changed for you,” Castiel said. “Hasn’t it?”
Castiel went still. The wards? What on earth were wards?
He pulled back, more sharply.
Castiel breathed out into the quiet.
Castiel can see the slight smile on Dean’s face, but it’s almost completely buried under the worry and the anger.
“I said, tell me the address.”
Castiel thought about that for a second.
“Chili,” he said.
“What did you -”
“Why not?” Dean demanded.
“Well, if you’re sure,” she said. She was looking at him askance, as though she knew something was up with him, and Dean swallowed nervously.
Dean sat up, pulling his hand away from Castiel’s so quickly that Castiel knew he’d been aware of the contact, too. He gave Castiel’s shoulder a push, just rough enough to be on the platonic side of early-morning touches.
Dean let out a sigh. He’d come to a stop to let Charlie root briefly through his new belongings, and now he took a morose slurp of milkshake.
Dean could only look at him for a few moments. In his mind’s eye, he was seeing the giant stack of mail on his kitchen counter. The letters that he’d assumed were from the bank, or from insurance companies, or something.
“Cas,” Dean said, “come here.”
Cas glanced over towards the stage, where Charlie was coaxing Jo up to stand beside her with the help of the crowd, who were cheering and clapping for them both.
Blearily, he pushed at the left-hand side of a pair of double doors, and walked into Dean’s bedroom. It was all just as he remembered it – the wide windows, the glass door that led out onto the balcony, the guitars on the walls and the shabby posters over the bed. One of them was ripped, a Led Zeppelin one, legacy of Jo Harvelle in year seven. The room as a whole was an odd mix of modern stylings with some decorative hangovers from Dean’s teen years.
“Getting frozen yoghurt with Roman poets,” Cas said back, and Dean felt a little spike of pleasure at how neutrally he said it, as though he too wasn’t overjoyed that they’d been interrupted - and how his eyes cut to Dean’s for half a second afterwards, as though wanting to share the joke again.
His mind felt as though it were in a fog after the day’s driving. What he was looking at felt like an exhibition in an abstract gallery,
moment, only one - to dive deep into the picture that had been bashing on the door of his brain since they’d first walked into the store together. For a second, he let himself imagine that he and Cas were together. Walking down this aisle as a couple. Just on a casual shopping trip to pick up snacks before heading home to their shared apartment. They’d been doing this for years, this was so normal. Cas being here was familiar and reassuring but still somehow incredibly exciting - and they made each other feel so wanted and so special, and it all came so easily, and...
Maybe he just looked like something out of an Enrique Iglesias video.
“Pamela, you know we don’t believe in…”
“You were honest,” Cas said simply. “I haven’t ever heard anyone be so honestly, accurately critical of my music like that to my face. It was refreshing.”
honestly so cute I think deans a little bit in love.
“Me? Why would I do it?”
He drove, swinging his car into a parking lot and heading on foot towards the place he’d said he would meet Cas. And he found himself smiling, irrepressibly. It was idiotic, he had to look like a total loser, smiling to himself as he walked down the street. But he couldn’t squash the smile completely. He’d come out to his brother. He was about to go on a date with Cas. And Cas was coming for Christmas. Everything was - everything was good, it was so good. Everything looked beautiful to him. The people walking down the street around him, the leaves rolling down the sidewalk, the neon sign advertising
It still said the same thing.
Castiel woke up with a headache so gentle that it was almost pleasant. The nibbling twinge of it and the slight tackiness in his mouth filled up his mind. It was easier to think about the discomfort than it was to think about what had happened the night before. The long evening, the almost-kiss.
“Anyway,” Gabriel said bracingly. “There are plenty more job fish in the sea, right?”
“I really don’t, I just – whatever, I don’t,” Dean said.
They neared the lake, and Dean said,
read the screen, which he glanced at before bending down to open up the oven. When he tugged at the door it yawned open, the hot air rushing out to blast his face. If he’d been hoping that the music or the smell of food would ground him, ease the sense of strangeness and floating above himself, he’d been wrong. The loudness of the song was clattering against ears that didn’t want to hear it. The pizza inside the oven was bubbling greasily and the heat felt dully painful on his eyes the longer he watched it, so he shut the door. His breaths were coming a little too quickly in his chest. He swallowed hard, looking around the kitchen. He needed something – something – he didn’t know what, something to ease everything, to make it all calm down, to bring him back to himself.
, had he? He’d just said yes. Obviously, Dean had blown that now. But there had been a time when Castiel hadn’t been disgusted, or whatever, by the idea of Dean liking him.
His was one life; the city held hundreds of thousands.
Jody put a hand on her hip.
“Yeah, Dean. Ten. You’re down to a six point five, by the way, after yesterday.”
Sam snorted.
He stared down at the water, simmering away innocently. It looked clean. Boiling it would make it clean too, wouldn’t it? Maybe?
He settled deeper into his chair. He could still feel his heart pounding. It gently slowed as the minutes unraveled, with Castiel still thinking about Dean’s expression. And the way he’d leaned in close, at the start.
He reached for his phone.
Maybe the compliment had actually been sincere.
"Hey, by the way," the Hunter said. "I need you to use your eye-tech. Search the Underlight for diabetics. Does it have a setting for that, or whatever?"
“Alright, well. I’ll leave you to your coffee,” Castiel said, still sounding far too chirpy, and he got up and walked away.
“Uh, shall we?” he said, gesturing into the movie theatre.
“I wasn’t,” Dean said.
it, people sing it too, knowing what it meant to him and to them.
“Yes, thank you,” Castiel said.
“I’m Castiel,” Castiel said.
But Dean wanted to.
“What else did she say?”
his brother, if this went wrong. His throat went tight, and he couldn’t speak. Was he really going to do this?
“Yes. You?”
Dean said the words to thin air. The breeze caught and tugged at them, pulling them away amongst the trees. Noises could hide in there, Dean thought, invisible. But he was solid and human and if he tried to hide here, or downstairs in the apartment, or anywhere, he would be found. In minutes, rather than hours.
Dean snorted, and turned back to unbagging the many, many packs of cookies that they’d bought.
“Just for fun?” he said. Dean seemed to pause for a half of a half of a moment, and then his charming smile was back in place.
Half a million people now knew his name? Knew what he sounded like when he sang? Knew he was going to be singing again, at a sold-out concert, in a week and a half?
“Sounds good. But you’ll be takin’ your break now. It’s past lunch.”
Still standing in his hallway, he took a breath, and let it go.
“My mom…” he said.
These weren’t messages to the group chat. These were private messages. Messages that Castiel had sent just to Charlie, during the call. Dean kept reading.
A longer pause still, and then –
“It’s not obvious,” Castiel said softly. “I swear. It’s not.”
