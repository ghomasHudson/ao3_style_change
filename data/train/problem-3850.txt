“It’s
"You saw him, right?" Sam says when he reaches them, pushing his hair out of his face.
“Do you remember that time, with Ishim? In a diner booth much like this one?”
Dean starts the car, and switches the radio over to an only-slightly-crackly rock station before getting back on I-88.
He’s probably dreaming, but he could’ve sworn Cas kisses the back of his neck before he’s lost to sleep again.
“Hi, Eileen.”
"You can still - it's okay if you touch me, in the way you always have," Cas says, trying to keep the exasperation out of his voice. Dean has been acting conspicuously careful since they got back, and he’s tired of it. He misses the casual, easy way Dean put his hands on him before. "You aren't leading me on."
It’s embarrassing. He loves it so goddamn much.
The glossy, grey head of some kind of something rises from the water, its black eyes at Cas’ level. Cas holds a hand palm out behind him, signaling Dean to stop whatever dumbass idea he has of splashing in after him. Just in time - Dean had already pulled back the safety on his gun. Dean watches gobsmacked as Cas nods understandingly at the monster’s gesticulating, all green scales and pointed claws.
“Thank you, Dean. The motel is just up ahead, past the Hardees with the burnt-out sign. Okay, next. You’re beautiful.”
“Heaven, generally. I—that’s where I’m supposed to be.” Fuckin’ figures. Dean swallows and tries not to shrug away from Cas’ too-gentle touch. “To be clear, it isn’t where I
“Fair point. House or apartment?”
But too soon Dean is pulling away, and Cas’ displeasure at that course of action would shatter lightbulbs if he still had his grace.
“You’re not doing that anymore though,” Dean says, yawning. “You gotta stay alive so you can fuck me.”
The minutes tick by, over an hour lapsing. Dean doesn’t turn the radio back on. His hands are still on the steering wheel, a practiced, patently artificial calm. Cas turns things over in his mind. He had what should have been plenty of time on the journey from Maine to think, to prepare, and yet he finds himself at a loss. The fundamentals though, those need sorting.
The pace of Dean’s hips picks up in a slow build, and the fire in Cas’ blood builds until there’s nothing he can do to resist the sharp crack of pleasure working up his spine. He curls his fingers within Dean in a last-ditch attempt to drag him along with him.
Dean’s stomach drops out.
More lube until he’s dripping with it, two fingers again, and they’re not enough. Dean fucks back into his hand, digging his toes into the cheap blanket they’d spread out before this started. Until Cas grips him by the hip, holding him still, and Dean lets himself be held. He closes his eyes and breathes, and feels his heart rate settle as he hands the reins over.
“It’s possible he’d smite me on the spot for drawing this comparison, but Gabriel was the closest approximation of a mother I ever had. I miss him.”
Dean drags his tongue up the crease between leg and hip before answering. “Don’t be stupid. Obviously not.”
“You mean -” Dean starts, and Cas shrugs. “Dude, no. You weren’t broken, Cas.”
“Looks like the bedding section is just over here,” Cas calls back from the end of the row.
If it wasn’t for the thick steel separating the driver’s cabin from the truck’s cargo hold, Dean would insist on riding shotgun with Cas. But, Cas swears he’s fine with Dean following along behind.
Cas crooks his fingers just right, making something snap and white out in Dean’s brain.
“So, your life story,” Cas prompts.
Cas huffs a laugh. “Yes. I assume you’ve heard of the concept.”
"I see that. I meant
Farhiya starts fidgeting when the bus takes the exit for Rochester.
When he sets Cas’ plate of eggs down in front of him, he squeezes his shoulder in silent thanks.
In Dean’s peripheral vision, he sees Cas’ eyes go soft, sad.
“That’s a two day drive, goddammit,” Dean interjects. “I’ll check the Greyhound schedules - we can meet somewhere in the middle.”
“Your nightmares, that first year back from hell. I justified it to myself that we - heaven - needed you well. Needed you sharp and ready for the mission. But it was more than that. I cared - so early on, I cared - about you hurting.”
“I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable. We can keep not talking about it.”
Dean huffs a laugh. “I was thinking something a little more...”
“Uh, alright. Want me to walk you through it?” Dean asks, conscious of the way his dick is filling up against the mattress at having Cas’ weight on his. Cas doesn’t have to know.
“Yes.”
“Well, I’m working my way through the bestsellers of the 21st century. I have some questions about the memoir structure of ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ as a matter of fact, and I’d love your thoughts.”
It’s taken some getting used to, the whole part-human, part-angel thing. Cas is aging alongside him, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepening and rogue silver hairs appearing at his temples. He sleeps now too, curling an arm around Dean’s middle every night and breathing against the back of his neck. Dean is so goddamn grateful for all of it.
“Cyanobacteria. It’s algae,” Cas corrects him.
“Nothing has to change, Dean,” he says, kindness in each word.
Dean feels the immediate twist of guilt in his gut when he thinks of one significant outlier. “I know I have a lot of work to do, with Jack.”
“I’m perfectly content. Are you alright? You seem a little...”
In for a penny, in for a pound. Dean shifts forward until he’s resting atop Cas’ ass, and wow, that’s...a lot. He curls his fingers over Cas’ shoulders, thumbs digging into the creaky knots at the join of neck and shoulder. Each downward press pushes a little hitching breath from Cas. Cas hums when Dean’s thumb finds a knot at the back of his neck, and when he moves both hands up to dig into his hair and press against his scalp, he earns an honest-to-god moan. Dean drags it out as long as seems even remotely defensible, Cas pliant and boneless beneath him.
“Like what?”
“Yeah, yeah. I’m good. Just thinkin’, you know.”
“That term isn’t commonly used among active enthusiasts, according to Jack’s subreddit community,” Cas says archly, sipping his tea. “Also, he’s become quite invested in the lives of several YouTube personalities, and taken up a vibrant interest in brewing his own kombucha.”
He follows Cas to the start of a wood-chipped at the edge of the parking lot and they fall into step alongside each other.
Dean deflates, eyeing the plant, which to be honest, already looks a little droopy.
“I’ll do that,” Cas says, a smile in his voice.
Dean drops his head to Cas’ shoulder, grinning into the skin at the stretched-out collar of his shirt.
“Oh. Right. Based on the condition of the dust atop the gravel driveway, I am confident that the homeowner has been absent for at least three weeks. So I don’t think there is any significant risk for a violent human encounter.”
There’s a knock at the door. Dean is immediately awake and alert, hand going for the closest gun only to remember it’s across the room in his bag rather than under his pillow where it belongs, like he’s a goddamn rookie out on his first spook hunt.
Dean settles into the other bed and stares at the ceiling, letting Cas' gentle breathing and the distant whir of semi-trucks on the highway send him to sleep.
This, he knows at least. “Of course, Dean.”
“You really are acting strangely, Dean. Is it the questionnaire? We can stop. I would never intend to cause you actual discomfort. If this is beyond your vulnerability tolerance level, I apologize.”
“That thing you were gonna tell me last night? The quality or ability or whatever that you wish you had?”
“The natural order. Or, more accurately, a new order entirely. Demons in hell with a path to redemption, angels in a fully-powered heaven, humans unbothered by either on earth with the surety of an afterlife at peace with their loved ones. Angelic and demonic nonintervention in earthly affairs as rule number one.”
“You want to share your life with someone other than your brother. Someone you can count on.”
Sam says on the other line.
“That’s good, you should. Enjoy things, I mean.” Dean rubs at the back of his neck, hot under the late May sunshine.
Dean strips down, leaving his clothes in a disgruntled heap beside the bed. He sits on the edge of the bed, facing away from Cas, completely unsure of what to do next.
"What do you mean? No offense, but applying dog piss to the dirt isn't really my idea of a good time."
Y'all, your comments. Gah. Thank you. Truly.
“That’s what I mean. You were—you weren’t good, then.”
“‘If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?’” Cas says, apropos of nothing, before Dean realizes it’s another question from the list. Of course Cas has it memorized verbatim.
Dean nods. Cas lifts his hand to Dean’s face, and Dean fights to stay still for it as Cas ghosts his thumb across his cheek. Cas’ fingers drift to the curve of his jaw. Dean swallows, mouth dry. He realizes he’s got one hand still on the steering wheel, the other gripping the meat of his own thigh as Cas traces featherlight over the shell of his ear and then behind, into his hair. He tugs Dean forward, tipping his face down until he’s pressing a kiss to his forehead.
“So why do you want the telepathy back, if you know me so well?”
Dean opens his arms wide to hug Donna, and she squeezes him back so hard his feet nearly leave the ground. When he looks back out across the roof, he sees that Claire is gone and Cas is talking to someone else, a woman he doesn't recognize. He makes his way closer, weaving amongst the ever-drunker guests that squeeze his arm or shout congratulations in his ear as he passes. He notes how the mystery woman is wearing a brilliant green dress that sort of
It goes on like that for weeks. The peas keep on producing well after the daily high tops 90 degrees - something Cas finds utterly shocking. He’s keeping a logbook of every unusual thing the garden does. Or more accurately,
Dean plops down in the grass with a grunt and leans back against the fence post.
Dean rolls his eyes. “No one can do the Saturday crossword.”
“...No.”
“We need to get on the road.”
Cas rises to his knees, fucking his fingers into Dean and fucking his own fist. They’re looking into each other’s eyes, and it’s never been like this, never been this good or this close or this (oh, god)
“Tell me that you watched ‘While You Were Sleeping’ with Jody and the girls, via Skype?”
“Let’s withhold judgment,” Cas says as they step inside. “Maybe the damage is limited to -” Cas trips on a high spot in the floor, Dean throwing out an arm to catch him. The air inside is crisp and clean, owing to the fact that most of the glass is missing from the main room’s windows.
“Gonna figure out everything you like,” Dean murmurs as he mouths a trail across the flat of his back. His hand leaves Cas’ cock before he runs his fingers lightly over Cas’ balls and then behind them, circling closer to where Cas very much wants him to be, until he diverts back up and tight around Cas’ dick again. How he does all this while keeping up the sinuous roll of his hips, Cas can only guess. Next time - next time he might be
Then, that's Cas' breath on his fucking
“Yes, Dean,” Jody says, hands at ten-and-two on the wheel.
Cas considers the invitation. Over the winding course of their relationship, topics large and small have been off-limits. A door flung wide to
Dean touches the edge of a blue blanket labeled as “OVERSIZED ULTRA MICROPLUSH” as Cas drifts over to stand beside him.
Jack looks between them with increasing alarm.
Dean rubs his temples, breathing slowly.
Cas shakes his head. Dean’s got to find something other than his eyes to focus on (were they always that blue?), or he’s going to do something weird. Weirder than compulsively lying about breakfast. He grabs one of the menus stuffed behind the napkin dispenser like he doesn’t already know what’s on offer at every diner in middle America.
“Wow, this quiz thing sure isn’t pulling any punches, huh.”
“Uh, we blew out a tire outside Cleveland, and well.”
“You celebrated Jack’s birthday?”
“I got it. That barn. What was it - ‘09? You came in there, lightbulbs bursting, all
“You’ve got the jump on me there. I mean, it’s not that I haven’t thought about it. The you-and-me thing. God, I’ve thought about it. It just always seemed like something that could only happen to a version of me living two universes to the left, you know what I mean?”
Cas had said. So Dean had improvised with the detachable strap from his duffle and Cas’ tie and got to work. In more ways than one.
Dean would grin, would quip something cocksure and devastatingly charming, but instead he twists his tongue around the head of Cas’ dick and waits for him to pull himself together one methodical breath at a time. Ujjayi breathing, Cas had called it—a yoga thing probably more suited to a remote mountain forest than a basement in Kansas. Still, it isn’t long until he goes pliant again under Dean's hands, relaxing into the ropes. There’s skill on both sides of this game, and Dean will never stop being amazed at what Cas is capable of.
Dean lets out a wet laugh, smiling into the warm skin of Cas’ hip and feeling like maybe, for once, he could keep something good.
He’s pouring his heart out to a Gen Z kid, and he’s in love with the guy who looks like her long-dead father. It’s a mess, is what it is, and yet, he’s wiping his eyes and feeling more unburdened than he has in...god, awhile.
He shrugs, takes a long drink, and hands the bottle back to Cas before sitting down on the edge of the mattress to work off his shoes.
“I never said it didn’t have to do with you. It absolutely does. My relationship with you is the bar by which I would measure any other friend, which possibly does them a disservice.”
They check off all the freakiest rides until Eileen begs off at the tallest of the coasters, opting instead to wait for them on a bench next to the exit. At the top of the lift hill, Dean grins at Sam, feeling his heart racing despite himself. Sure, he’s beaten an archangel or two in his day, but even he can’t stifle his body’s reaction to being 200 feet up and ready for the drop. The latch on his seatbelt seems a little wonky, but it's probably fine. These rides are inspected all the time, right?
Dean points out a stack of plywood sheeting in the corner. “Couldn’t we brace these panels against the trellises, like a lean-to, and -”
“Ah." Cas shakes his head, and Dean gets the surreal impression that he's being pitied. "I’ve been around a long time, if you recall. Observed a great deal of humans’ sexual nature, both the mundane and the profound.”
“The crack in my chassis,” Cas answers after a beat. He flips the windshield wipers on, clearing off the haze of drizzle that started falling somewhere near Springfield.
That night, Cas gets him on his hands and knees, spread out and desperate in front of the flickering light and crackling logs just like he’d envisioned.
“Dammit, I owe Eileen twenty bucks now. Dean knows what he wants, but I guess he’s just too much of a chickenshit to do anything about it.”
Dean opens his mouth to argue, to point out the obvious differences, but then...hm.
“Last question for tonight,” Cas says, kissing over his chest. “‘If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?’”
“Cool. That’s...that’s good. So we can just...”
When he gets back to the car, Cas has moved to the passenger seat. Dean hands him the sunglasses. Cas turns them over in his hands, puzzled.
“You loved her, Dean. I don’t see why that’s embarrassing.”
“I don’t know, fuck around on your phone? Listen to the radio, literally anything else?”
“Sure. Cas, you’ve gotta stop talking about what you did to upgrade my, what was it, mortifying flesh? What, you make my dick bigger too?”
-” another kiss. “I told you, it’s in the
"Huh. Never thought about that. Being famous - infamous, whatever - was never really something I had any control over."
Dean hands them over, and Cas tells him about how removing the suckers at the juncture of a tomato plant’s branch and main stem helps keep the plant structurally sound over the course of the season and improves overall fruit yield. Dean’s listening, but he’s also thinking about all the salsa and marinara he’s going to can in August. Or, a thick slice of an heirloom brandywine tomato on a perfectly grilled burger. Fuck, he’d even make Sam one of those freaky meat-substitute burgers from the fancy grocery store down in Hays. Make a real day of it.
, they’re so fucking stupid. He hauls himself up to his elbows, getting a glorious view of Cas’ mouth working around him.
“Actually, I was wondering if you wanted to pass the time another way,” Cas says, throwing him a considering glance.
“How would it -”
“All good, just called Sam.”
“Okay. He’s not riding in the car. How the fuck do we get him back to Lake Michigan?”
“You corrected my
Walking beside each other when the trail widens, Cas asks, “‘How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?’”
“Dean,” Cas groans at the ceiling, arching his back in a sinuous stretch and killing off at least a couple thousand of Dean’s remaining brain cells.
Dean swallows reflexively and taps a coaster against the bar.
Dean shrugs. “I’ve hauled heavier bodies further.”
Cas isn't breathing at all. It doesn't seem important.
Dean drops his empty coffee cup, and it clatters on the formica tabletop. At least it’s plastic. Small mercies.
“What are you doing up?” Dean asks, forehead creasing. “Did I hog the covers or something? Haven’t, uh. Slept with anyone for...awhile.”
"Could I." Cas says it like a statement, rather than a question, eyebrow arched. He must’ve felt Dean watching.
Dean lets a long breath out through his nose, head tipped back against the booth. Cas raises his hands in surrender.
“And the rest?”
, he doesn't say.
“That’s hard, man. I usually have no damn clue what’s going on in your mind. You’re kind of a mystery - a beam of celestial intent, I think you called yourself once.”
Cas says through gasps, vision growing dark at the edges as he plays his one remaining card.
His rank is gonna take a hit from leaving the match early, but Dean’s closes out the tab and turns to face Cas.
“Nah, it’s fine. We don’t need it,” Dean says, stuffing his hands in his pockets. Sure would be handy for movie nights though.
“Dean, everything okay?” Sam asks, picking up on the second ring like he’s been waiting by the phone. They always did have a bit of a second sense about one another. Thank god for that.
“I’m fine, but most critically, are you?” Cas asks, heart in his throat. “Are all of you alright?”
“Exciting,” Dean says, toeing at the corner of the garden bed closest to him, wondering if he should have used stronger corner brackets.
“No.”
-” Does he know any other words, or is it just Dean’s name in ten thousand different languages?
“I don’t know, man. But why do I feel like the plants just said, ‘aw, shucks’? It sorta looks like they're blushing.”
"Why did you want me to -"
Dean swallows hard, adjusting his grip on the bars and trying to form a coherent thought, a herculean task given the circumstances. “Yeah, uh. You can boss me around, sure.”
With the Food Network on in the background of a Comfort Inn queen suite, Ina Garten demonstrates the appropriate oil-to-acid ratio in a vinaigrette as Dean’s fingers find that spot inside Cas that makes him swear in Enochian.
Dean reaches blindly for Cas, trying to tug him down with uncooperative limbs and failing in the effort. Cas takes mercy on him and helps, rearranging Dean’s arms and legs until they can both fit as well as a full size bed is ever going to let two six-foot-something men fit. After Cas pulls the scratchy sheets and violently pastel comforter over them both, Dean curls around him, his head on Cas’ chest and the steady thud of Cas’ heartbeat under his ear.
"Hey, the little stick tag thing clearly says that Pothos plants are well-suited to low light conditions," Dean says, chucking the dirt-covered tag in Sam's direction for added emphasis.
Turns out, they know more people than Dean thought. Summer has given way to fall, and there’s a crowd of maybe sixty guests milling about on the bunker’s roof, sipping on cocktails and bonding over shit like preferred exorcisms and the relative merits of ceramic versus tungsten blades for offing crocottas. Dean tries to get close enough to Kaia and Garth to eavesdrop on their conversation, but all he hears is something about cheesecake and the psychic energy of lunar rocks.
“No, no,” Cas says. “Not a case. Just expertly prepared, plant-based cuisine.”
“I’ve never. Um. There are certain social-sexual rituals I’ve never engaged in that I would like to try. I think.”
“It’s not Jimmy, either. Don’t get me wrong, he was a good-looking guy. But it’s...” he could get into trouble here, “...something about how you carry yourself, I guess.”
“Didn’t catch that. What was it again? The 36 Questions that...oh. Huh. Found it.”
“It’s time by your side, so it’s time well-spent.”
Outside, Cas crowds him against the driver’s side door of the Impala and kisses him so good that he doesn’t notice his keys going missing. Dean can’t be blamed that a strong hand on the nape of his neck makes him a little absentminded, not to mention the feeling of Cas’ bottom lip under his tongue. Before he clocks what’s happening, Cas is steering him over to the passenger side and opening the door for him like he’s the gentlemanly prom date Dean never got the chance to be. Cas stashes his trench coat in the backseat and rolls his sleeves up to the elbow before settling in behind the wheel, and he looks so good that Dean can’t bring himself to object.
“I’ll talk to Jack. Maybe we can amend the terms without compromising the goals of the agreement,” Cas says, thumbing over his cheek like he’s made of glass rather than scarred skin over broken and mended bones. “More miraculous things have happened, after all. It won’t even be the first time I’ve negotiated for my own resurrection.”
“Dean. Not that I don’t appreciate your enthusiasm for your nation’s history, but it’s very late. Perhaps -”
Somewhere in central Missouri, Cas leans against the side of the car as Dean pumps the gas at a service station that looks straight out of a Jimmy Stewart movie.
"You might want to keep your voice down," Cas says archly, before taking a sip of his brilliantly yellow drink, eyebrows raised.
“Why didn’t you - never mind,” Dean says, shaking his head and looking down at the tabletop. “It’s none of my business.”
Cas is stupidly, maliciously sexy the entire too-long drive from the rural church cemetery to what passes for the nearest town. It’s passive harassment, is what it is. What with the way the occasional streetlight casts shadows across his face in profile, the way he fuckin’
As Cas deals with reception, Dean looks over the tourism brochures in a rack on the wall. A twilight riverboat cruise, a guide to the area’s antique shops, a winery, and a museum dedicated to Buffalo Bill.
Dean - exaggeration,” Cas gasps, fingers clenched in Dean’s hair as Dean works an unrushed trail of kisses across his stomach, Cas’ cock brushing against the side of his face.
Sunlight is streaming through the den’s picture window as Dean wakes up in increments. He slept far better than vinyl cushions and scratchy yarn blankets should have made possible. Probably has something to do with the company.
Suddenly, it doesn’t seem so funny.
Dean sneaks up behind him to peer over his shoulder.
Sam laughs, bright and happy.
- what I mean.”
have - kept on going.
“There,” Dean says. “Won’t last once we shower, but -”
“Did you like it?”
“You were a
“But changing kinda broke you, man.
Cas shifts up to the head over the bed, pulling the blankets back and sliding underneath. He pats the other side, and Dean goes willingly, settling beside him as far apart as a full-size bed will allow two grown men to be.
They jointly decide on a gyro place, all decked out in Greek blue and white. Over stuffed grape leaves, fries, and pitas filled with everything delicious, Cas wonders at what is going through Dean’s mind.
“If you say ‘stop’ I swear to fucking
“Right. But now, I’m not sure.”
“Well, no, but I have...died. Since then. So. Family law and most major religions of the world would say that takes care of that,” Cas says as he smooths out a wrinkle in the trenchcoat folded over his lap.
“Shit. Hi.”
“I meant, you’re already spiritually united, so marriage is a human formality. Not that that diminishes its significance in any way!”
“Alright, alright. I do, okay? I...acknowledge that.”
“I’ve wanted someone for over a decade without realizing he could want me back,” Cas says once he’s pulling him close and naked to himself. The room is warm, and Dean is shivering. “I’d say my blunder qualifies as one long, embarrassing moment.”
“What the -”
“Dean. I appear to be without my powers, at the ferry station in Swan’s Island, Maine. Oh, this is Castiel. I’ll call Sam next.”
Sam and Eileen cut out early from movie night when Eileen nods off against his shoulder halfway through True Grit. With them gone, Cas can’t follow the plot of the film’s final act, his body stupidly, uselessly attuned to how close Dean is in the near-dark. Ridiculous.
“Oh. How is he?”
“That’s not true,” Cas protests. “Your brother is anything but a ‘chickenshit.’”
“You’re thinking of a birthday party. For a six year old,” Dean says. Most honestly, a bounce house sounds kind of fun, but he keeps that to himself. They’re probably not weight-rated to support four fully grown men anyway. “But cake, definitely.”
“For fuck’s sake—”
“Tell me about the loaded hash brown scramble.”
“Sure.”
“So, I would save my coat. It sounds silly, perhaps. It’s just industrially fabricated polyester and plastic buttons, after all. Fully replaceable. Except it isn’t. It’s been with me each time I’ve died and come back, when I’ve been killed at the hand of one or another brother. Or when I’ve walked into lakes and - is ‘dissolved’ the right term, do you think?” Dean shudders. “Only to have a dear friend keep it with him until I was able to return. It’s a mythic object, at this point. Worthy of saving from a fire.”
“Mm. I see. Are you asking if I find him attractive?” Cas asks, voice low and making Dean shift in his seat to hide how that pitch makes his traitorous dick react.
“What the
In Galveston, Cas gives him turn-by-turn directions until he’s pulling into a sandy parking lot where land gives way to the Gulf. It’s a weekday in the off-season, and there are no other cars in sight.
“Actually,” Jack says, leaning across the table. “I’d say that the imprint of Cas’ grace on every segment of your DNA is of quite significant import.”
"Do you have any idea how much self-control it takes to be near you?" Cas says.
With Cas panting against his skin, Dean rubs at the back of his neck where he can feel a bruise forming. Good. He wants those everywhere.
Why ‘duh,’ he wants to argue, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t say anything.
“You remember what it was like last time I—last time we lost him.” His fist bloodied against the backdoor to a fast food joint, an abandoned hospital full of ghosts and a too-casual trip to visit Death with the thin excuse of doing it for a case.
“Can we switch again?” Dean asks after a flash of inspiration. “Get me on my back, and you can really fuck my mouth.”
Cas huffs a laugh, shaking his head. “That’s not the issue. I’m not—
Dean pulls off, and Cas groans a protest low enough to shake the earth.
“What - what do you mean?”
Sue him, sibling dynamics are a bit of an emotional trigger. Whatever.
Donna grins, dimples flashing. “Just over by the bar yakking it up with Cesar and Jesse. She wants to take me horseback riding, and their ranch is only a day’s drive from here.”
Sam takes Eileen’s hand, kisses her palm. “Eileen and I are going to Ireland for a while. Maybe a couple of months?”
“I apologize if the fact of our cohabitation embarrasses you,” Cas says. “I’m aware of your discomfort when a stranger mistakes your sexual preferences.”
The waitress delivers Cas’ food, and Dean watches him methodically demolish it. He can’t wait to cook for him when they get back home. With Cas occasionally humming his approval of the food, Dean’s mind spins off into a sepia-toned domestic fantasy of flipping pancakes at the stove and humming along to the radio as Cas washes the dishes. Except, in the fantasy, they’re not in the windowless kitchen of the bunker, they’re somewhere else. Somewhere decidedly above ground and most importantly, their own.
“I’m - I just. Figured. We’ve been doing a lot of sharing and caring these days. So. If you wanted to, uh, talk about it. That would be okay.”
“Okay, I’m not gonna argue - you know I want to anyway, you already know what I’d say. Alright, last one. You’re adaptable. Nobody’s had to change their own personal rulebook like you, and that takes guts. You went from soldier of heaven to crashing in shitty motels just like this one with Sam and me.”
“Freshly laundered sheets. Why is it that they feel so much better? I would make a study of it, but given our area’s propensity for drought, it’s a difficult thing to morally justify. Especially as I barely sleep. Let’s see, what else. The Saturday crossword.”
Dean’s free hand balls into a fist against his thigh.
Dean reaches over to grab his phone again. Cas leans over his shoulder to snoop.
Cas kisses him into the mattress until Dean is pulling at his clothes in an entirely ineffectual way. Cas takes mercy on him, stripping first Dean and then himself before wrapping a lubed-up palm around Dean’s shaft, thumbing at the head on every twisting upstroke as Dean clings and gasps and doesn’t contribute at all, too overwhelmed in the best possible way.
“...Cas? Castiel - oh my god, hang on -
“Okay, yeah. It’s got to be new. I’m sure we’ll think of something.” A baker’s dozen of life-threatening ideas come to mind immediately, but Dean keeps that little tidbit to himself. No need to worry Sam. “Wait, you said we learned something else too.”
tell me all about sexy math.”
Dean grips the steering wheel. The car feels small, his clothes are too tight, everything hot and uncomfortably close. He’s gonna say something stupid. He can feel it bubbling up.
Cas toes out of his shoes, then sits to pull his socks off rather than risk a topple into the lake. He tucks them carefully inside his shoes at the same time Dean realizes he's never seen Cas barefoot before. He looks away from Cas' newly-revealed ankles like a scandalized Victorian as he moves to sit by his side.
Cas looks up at him, eyes dark as he works one boot and then the other off slower than is probably necessary, slow enough for Dean to feel the blood leave his brain for warmer climes. Cas stands again between Dean’s spread knees, surveying him.
“Given my choice to relinquish limitless access to grace - the angelic equivalent of a human 30 year old’s physical form, I suppose - my answer should be obvious.”
“Lie down, Dean. On your back, please, and under the covers.”
“That wasn’t a compliment. The compliment is that you are capable of receiving tenderness, even after all you’ve endured.”
“How did you know about that?” Dean asks, embarrassed.
“That’s the next question. You have four minutes. And you are to use as much detail as possible.”
“Oh, great,” Dean groans, sinking back into the couch cushions.
Dean swallows hard at that, and he wishes there was some space between them for this conversation, or better yet, no space at all. Fuck it, plausible deniability is well out the window anyway. He shimmies a leg between Cas’, keeping their hips a couple inches apart. This would sure be a fuckall lot better without clothes, but Dean will take what he can get. Anything to get a little closer.
Dean swallows, nodding and tipping his head back, eyes to the ceiling for a moment.
“Once, but it doesn’t count.”
“The Golden Age of Islam. While your ancestronies - excuse me,
And that’s what they’ll keep on doing, always.
“Is that a denial?”
Cas chooses a table near the front, startlingly bright sunlight streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Speakers shaped like pineapples are playing music that Dean knows in his very soul that Sam likes. Ugh.
“Single or double?” the older guy at the counter asks, not looking up from the crossword he’s got folded open on the desk.
Meanwhile, Cas’ palm has found its way to the center of Dean’s chest, and Dean is suddenly very, very aware that they’re in the middle of a crowded bar after midnight. Somebody might get the wrong idea. Or the right one, at least in Dean’s case.
“A caper, if you will.” Cas glances shiftily from side to side, as though to check there are no wayward children around to corrupt with their conspiring. “To liberate the languishing produce.”
He’s avoided this state of being for so long. He’s been conscious of his own feelings for years, after all. Long before the Empty made its promise to him in exchange for Jack’s life. All his fears, the terrors that kept him wandering the bunker’s halls at night, of all the worst ways Dean could respond - it’s all gone. In its place is the certainty of a home waiting for him in middle America, the promise of friendship, companionship, and belonging. He wants for nothing.
Cas fights back the urge to insist that he doesn’t, that there’s nothing he needs to hear from Dean. But maybe this isn’t actually about him, maybe Dean has things he needs to say for himself.
"I guess, it'd be cool if people knew about the good stuff too, maybe."
“I don’t know, I really wanna -” Cas removes his hands entirely, and Dean groans, far too few brain cells left to be embarrassed by it. “Fine, fine. I won’t come. You’re the
"Three quarters of a mile up the road, there is a small farmstead. I jog past it sometimes."
"No, no. I get it, I get it."
“Because I’d teach you.”
Dean laughs and scrubs a hand over his face, but he can’t manage to summon any real embarrassment. Cas has been staring at him since 2008, so he's earned the right.
“It’s not your fault, it’s not,” Cas says, deflating. “I know that. Multinational corporations bear the lion’s share of the blame. Anyway, the beans will be shredded by morning. I’m just...it’s fine. Let’s go home.”
he loved him. Kid doesn’t need to hear that. Some shit can stay private.
“Forgive me if I’ve misjudged the situation,” Cas says, petting at his face, his hair. “But I am fairly certain you’ve never done this before.”
"Mm. Well, in that case, I was thinking that the purgatory blade you've got hanging on your wall might have the right edge to get a really close shave, especially with the teeth on the end of it. Kitsune, was it? Or Shtriga?"
“Angels come into existence fully formed,” Cas says thoughtfully. “Ready to fulfill their spiritual purpose in heaven or on earth. But there is a short period of time - roughly ten thousand years - when you might say an angel operates with training wheels. Every new angel is assigned a mentor. Someone older in the garrison, who can model ideal angelic behavior. Gabriel was mine.”
“Social-sexual. And, sleeping in a bed with someone after sex. Waking up with them in the morning.”
“It’s worth a fucking
The sand is hot underfoot, so they rush to the edge of the beach where the waves are lapping at the shore. Stepping into the surf, he reaches for Cas’ hand when a wave nearly takes him out at the knees. Before long, they figure out how to brace for each impact together.
“Yeah, see, this -” Dean gestures at the lack of space between them, “- I can do. This makes sense to me.”
He raises an eyebrow at Dean in question, and Dean scratches at the back of his neck before pointing at a beat-up yellow Honda parked crookedly against the curb.
“This is different, come on. Nobody’s dead or trapped in another dimension this time.” He’s also not on his own anymore, and neither is Sam. “And Sam and I’ve been in each other’s pockets for so many years, he’s probably dying for a little breathing room with Eileen.”
Cas detaches slowly, hands dragging along his sides and back, and ambles off toward the bedrooms.
Cas is blushing, picking at a loose thread from the sheets and decidedly not looking at him.
“Touch yourself, Dean. Show me.”
Once he’s sure Cas has had as much as he can take and his own patience is at its limit, Dean sits up. He sets his palm on Cas’ chest to feel the strong thud of his heartbeat, working harder now.
Cas pulls off immediately, fingers stilling too.
Cas wades backwards toward the shore, the lizard-monster-thing following closely and making Dean thoroughly nervous. He fidgets with the gun at his hip, ready in case anything goes pear-shaped.
“It’s not?”
“Gonna hold you to it.”
“Nice. But someone’s gotta watch the place though, right? And Jack?” The kid is three, after all. He’s burned cereal.
“The ones with the curved blades and the daisy-print handle,” Cas calls out, which is helpful, because there are at least eight things that look like they could conceivably be pruners. Dean can think of several lesser monsters that could be easily handled with any one of them.
Cas’ hand drifts down his face until he’s cupping his chin tight, keeping him steady. “Dean, I want - there’s something I want...” Cas gasps.
“...What?” Dean asks.
“You’re sure.”
“I mean, I didn’t even say anything back,” Dean says wetly. Cas can’t look at him to confirm, but he knows by heart the sound of Dean breaking down.
“It’s a haul. Couple days’ drive. Still worth checking out, maybe. Sure as shit wouldn’t need a credit score. And with nothing breathing down our necks, what’s a twenty hour drive even matter?”
“Well, a full 23% of your genes are shared with those present in yeast, so I wasn’t especially focused on those.”
“Okay. Alright,” Sam says, the tone of his voice well-suited to either a crisis or a miracle. “Are you good to drive, want one of us to come get you?”
“Alright, let’s see. ‘What would constitute a ‘perfect’ day for you?’” Cas asks.
After a brief speakerphone call with Sam that ends in a lovingly condescending “
Cas just wants to make him feel as good as he’s always deserved to feel, and it doesn’t hurt that he desperately wants this as well. He searches blindly through the sheets until he finds the bottle again, a feat in and of itself with Dean sucking a kiss into his shoulder. He pops the cap, pours some out in his palm, and...stalls out.
Cas shushes him urgently and points at a nearby trellis. “The tomatoes, they’re ripening, right before our eyes."
"I said, can you hand me my clothes? I seem to have forgotten them."
“Thank you, yes,” Cas says, sitting up and leaning forward right into Dean’s space.
When he wakes, he asks his seatmate, an elderly man, if he can borrow his phone. The man shrugs, and passes it over.
Cas and Eileen start rapidly signing to one another, smiles on both their faces. She pulls out her phone, sliding through photos that are all blindingly green.
“I need another, Dean, just -
you picked it? Man, that was a good BLT.”
“Did you pray, during those days I was away?” Cas asks, and Dean suddenly looks wide awake.
Their food and drinks arrive, and Cas decides he doesn’t actually like whiskey as it burns a path down his throat. This small bit of heresy seems like something he should keep to himself. The fries on the other hand - excellent.
“Huh? What’s he talking about, Cas?” Dean says, leaning against the side of the table next to Cas and knocking a knee into his.
He orders one, and Dean asks for a re-up on his whiskey. It’s lucky that the motel is next door; he’s pretty sure he’s well on his way to toasted. By the subtle tinge of pink to Cas’ cheeks, he knows he’s not alone.
“Sure sounds like it. You know you can call anytime, right? I know we’re not, like, close, but I just got Kaia back from another dimension so if anybody can understand...”
notice the way his forearms look, with the sleeves rolled up to the elbow. “Exactly.”
Cas smiles, and stirs a packet of sugar into his cup.
Sam holds up a hand in the universal symbol of 'I'm alright' and lopes awkwardly through the neatly-spaced rows toward them, all gangly limbs like he never aged past fifteen. Dean can hear snippets of Carl and Jody’s quiet conversation off to the side, her steady reassurances that this was a one time thing and none of his future customers are going to get plucked out of the air mid-fall.
Dean thinks back at him.
“What Dean is trying to say is he left the Impala on the side of a less than ideal frontage road and hotwired this fine piece of machinery instead,” Sam says, with a grin. “We were in a bit of a rush, weren’t we, Dean?”
Dean’s fingertips twitch when Cas drags the blunt edge of a nail down to the base of his thumb.
Without that defect in the assembly of my angelic nature, I wouldn’t be here with you now. And everything -
Dean grinds against him, Cas' dick hard in his jeans, to prove a point. “As if you’re so unaffected.”
“Can I help?” Cas asks, not exactly sure how he could contribute. He is admittedly lacking in the practicalities of vehicle maintenance. He could hand Dean tools, but he seems to have that covered. There has to be something...
“I see. So disrobing with you would be for purely pragmatic purposes,” Cas says solemnly, eyes flashing.
“That ain’t a surprise.” Dean thinks of all the times Cas has pulled Sam’s ass from the fire, literally and otherwise. “It’s not like I’m the only one he—that he...” For fuck’s sake, just say it, how hard is it to say.
Cas laughs softly, shaking his head. He takes a sip, adds creamer, and stirs again.
“No. Wait, once. Lisa, um. I’d had a fall at work - really torqued my back. She, I guess, yeah. Gave me a massage.”
“Does it matter? The fact of it remains regardless of its duration.”
“No.”
“Not to be too on-the-nose, but a trench coat is for travelers, for wanderers. Not for people who...”
"Is that a question?”
hear you.”
“I appreciate the sentiment. However, from a purely technical standpoint, I am. Angels were designed to be unthinkingly obedient emissaries of God’s intentions. And instead, I’m...well.”
"Hey, Cas. You dream-walking me?"
Dean shakes his head, but decides to let it go. Cas turns the question back on him, and Dean gives the only answer he can. Sam.
A glass of water in the kitchen, a quick trip to the small bathroom next to the gym, and he heads for his room. The light flickers on with a faint buzz, casting the room in shadows. He hasn’t spent much time here over the years. There was never a need to, before. When he’s stayed overnight in the past, he’s whiled away the hours the Winchesters were sleeping in the library, or later on, in Dean’s movie room.
Cas smiles, crinkles at the corners of his eyes.
“Right on time - the orchids. Just over there,” Cas says, a hand on his shoulder steering him to look northwest toward the lake.
Cas looks at him questioningly. Dean shakes his head and mouths back ‘
? In what capacity?” Cas asks, trying to be patient. “I don’t mean to belabor the technicalities, but...”
“Dean, open your eyes.” It takes effort, but he does, and Cas - Cas looks fucking

“Nothing of value to anyone except for me,” Cas says, unfolding a paper napkin and smoothing it across his lap like someone taught him table manners between one apocalypse and another.
the ocean, for starters. Cas thanks the woman, ducking around the side of the booth to place a call with shaking hands.
“You gotta stop assuming things, man.” He’s trying to keep the irritation out of his voice. Sounding pissed off isn’t going to help Cas grasp what he’s trying to get across.
Cas brushes off his hands on his borrowed pants, realizing belatedly that it might be slightly rude to get them this dirty when they aren’t his own. Maybe Dean could show him how to use the bunker’s somewhat old-fashioned washer and dryer tomorrow.
“No, I mean it - go back to the beginning. You could have walked out on my ass a dozen times.”
“Uh, not that I’m complaining, but what you’ve been doing for me and Sam sure doesn’t seem like nonintervention.”
“It’s intended to provoke revealing disclosures of intimate personal information, so small talk would be counter-purposeful. How do you think you will die, Dean?”
Dean just laughs and holds his hand out, palm down. Cas frowns down at the obvious tremor, taking the hand in between his own palms.
Cas works a hand between their bodies, grip tight on Dean’s dick and Dean lets his head fall to Cas’ shoulder, mouth open and hot against his skin as they rock together.
He starts working at Dean’s belt, but his fingers fumble with the buckle. Dean lays his hands over Cas’, then brings Cas’ palm up to his mouth to kiss.
“What are you - nevermind.”
Dean thinks back to those early days, Cas helping them - helping
“Guys. We’re right here,” Sam cuts in.
“Alright then. Telepathy. I occasionally miss the ability to read minds. It had a way of smoothing over complicated social interactions.”
“And you know what? That isn’t even the only time it’s gotten that bad,” Dean says with a mirthless laugh. “Nearly fucking drowned myself in whiskey when you died the first time. Or, I guess it was the third time? Hard to keep track. The one with the Leviathans, the lake. Didn’t stop drinking until you came back. I was a shit hunter that year, even more of a shit brother. Could’ve gotten me and Sam killed and probably would have if it wasn’t for Bobby pulling my ass out of the fire.”
It’s there, staring him in the face.
“Alright, well. This is a new one. Let’s get you dry, and then you wanna get something to eat?”
“I mean...girls have, uh, said stuff...”
“Tell you everything. Or show you, rather.” Cas’ hand shifts to cup his jaw, kissing him again. “I can let you into my mind. Just a portion of it. More than that might be...disadvantageous for your health.”
“Alright, mission accomplished,” Dean says, balling up the blanket and stuffing it in one of the trash bags they always keep stocked in the trunk of the car. “But it’s 10:00 PM in fuckin’ Nowhere, Michigan. What do you want to do now?”
“Huh, from the side, Burr kinda looks like Jonny Lee Miller.” Dean shrugs, holding the phone out of Cas’ reach. “I can see it. So what did the other guys - oh, Jesus. John Adams.”
“Dean, that doesn’t clear it up.”
“Uh...”
“If you roll to your side, I could -” Cas says with a grunt.
“And that’s...enough.”
“No, no—not a ghost. Definitely the real deal.” He couldn’t explain how he’s so sure of that. It’d be too sappy to say he’s never seen a ghost with eyes as blue as Cas’.
“Anything,” Dean slurs.
“Fuck. Kinda hoping you won’t ever be.”
“Thank

who was the -"
"I want a window," Cas says. “Exactly like this one.”
“He has symmetrical features, and kind eyes,” Cas says. “He didn’t say anything offensive during our admittedly brief interaction.”
Meanwhile, the research dries up. Sam finds the owner’s obituary in a Jacksonville newspaper. Jack finds the county record of title transfer to the owner’s daughter a couple weeks later. But every day, the only tire tracks in the driveway are the Impala’s, and no one seems to know or care that they’re there. Except the garden itself.
“Uh, you maybe didn’t see, but last night, I kinda, might have...” Cas lifts his head to look at him, like this isn’t difficult enough. “Cried a little. Yeah. I haven’t felt that close to anybody in a while.”
Cas hums in response, and they’re sitting so close Dean can feel it.
A thunderstorm rolls in on a night in early July. The morning after, Dean notices a few shingles in the yard. While Cas picks pole beans and pulls weeds, Dean digs a ladder out of the shed and climbs up onto the roof.
“Okay, uh, how -”
“No, nothing like that. I ran across an interesting journal article the other day, a study of questions designed to improve a relationship's intimacy. I thought we could try them.”
Like many of Dean’s adolescent stories, it’s heavily tinged with equal parts Winchester resilience and parental neglect.
It occurs to Dean that there’s nowhere else he needs to be right now, and nobody who needs anything from him. That’s almost never happened before—when he’s been with someone, there’s always been a shortage of time or privacy or both. But here, with nowhere to go and no one to see, he doesn’t have a single job other than to withstand how good Cas’ fingers and mouth feel while he tries not to come too soon.
means a dimly lit motel room, he and Cas sitting across from each other at an undersized dinette, spilling all their secrets.
Cas smiles over the rim of his coffee cup. “I don’t think the researchers had hunting in mind when they developed this question.”
Cas thinks of that sunrise on the coast yesterday. Definitely the most beautiful of his rebirths.
Looking around, he sees a small fishing shed not far up the shore. The walk/climb up the rocky beach makes him add shoes to his list of urgent needs. He tries the door, locked. Pressing his face to the glass of the shed’s lone window, he sees shelves with various supplies and provisions stacked neatly along the wall. Rods, nets, tackle, a bright red cooler. But more critically, what looks like a small bundle of what will pass for clothes.
“The next question might be a challenge as well, but in a different manner,” Cas says, pulling out his wallet and laying a pair of crisp twenties on the table. “Maybe on the way to a motel? There’s one not far. And even better, the Google reviews are without a single recent mention of bed bugs.”
“Something tells me I’m not gonna find out he’s a secret Republican at this point. So, yeah.”
Does he
“You could put them inside me,” Dean says, his normal voice turned into a fucked-out drawl.
“If you wanted to be closer, all you had to do was ask,” Cas says, weaseling his other arm underneath Dean’s and pulling him forward into a frankly humiliating full-body hug. If only Dean could remember to be humiliated rather than really fucking happy about it.
like the way Lisa touched him, all almond-scented body oil and sexy, ineffectual drags of her smooth hands across his bare back. That has been nice, no question. But this?
“Hm, something like that,” Cas says, a warm, faraway look in his eyes.
Dean looks over at the clock - just past eleven. Jesus, when’s the last time he’s slept that long?
“You gotta cut that shit out.”
“Oh, yeah, that was a weird week - there was this wood nymph, and -” Sam tells the rest of the story, as Cas sips his coffee and gives 80% of his attention to what he can see of Dean’s face in his peripheral vision.
The sun is starting to slip behind the clusters of white birch trees at the lake’s edge when he hears the creak of the floorboards behind him. He turns, and there's Cas, coat abandoned and sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He smiles down at him, warm and fond.
“My turn first?”
“Uh, I’m sorry?” Dean replies, and it feels woefully inadequate. He thinks of the Impala’s gas mileage, of the ground beef thawing in the fridge back at the bunker and feels at least 50% responsible for the sum total of global climate change.
“‘If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? If so, why?’” Cas asks as they pass a shelf of Instant Pots that has Dean more than a little curious.
“Alright.”
Dean smiles, a real one. “Alright. Yeah, we tried summoning him. No dice. Anyway, if you think of anything—”
Dean is chasing bell peppers and onions around a pan with an old wooden spoon when Sam hops up on the counter beside the stove, long legs dangling like he’s eight years old again rather than close to forty.
“Four minutes,” Cas answers, his angelic doppler radar apparently intact.
“It’s not strong enough to get him to stay though,” he eventually makes himself say. “Never has been.”
Cas stands alone on the top deck of the ferry, hands gripped around the cold, steel railing, and lets the ocean spray hit his face. He feels very, very alive. Vital, even, in a way he hasn’t experienced in quite some time, or ever. He wonders if that has more to do with his current mortality, or with the pervasive sense of lightness in his mind. He keeps no secrets now. Dean knows everything there is to know.
He tugs a grumbling Cas out of bed, kissing him and walking him backwards toward the bathroom. He presses him against the wall of the walk in shower and starts mouthing a smiling path down his chest as the water heats up. They’re going to be late for checkout again, but the way Cas looks down at him when he’s on his knees is worth it.
After a leisurely stop for maple bacon donuts and coffee at a strip mall on the outskirts out of town, they make the two hour drive down the coast to Indiana Dunes State Park.
. What he doesn’t know is
Dean smiles. "I’m also gonna go out on a limb here and say we both aren’t quite ready to head home yet.”
“Pretty sure gardens don’t spontaneously regenerate within a four hour period, Cas,” Sam interjects.
Dean. If anyone were to devise a way to retrieve him from that most unretrievable space, it would be Dean. His heart seizes in his chest at that thought, paralyzed at the idea of what Dean might have traded away. He has just enough of his celestial self to sense that Dean is still on this plane of existence. It might be that that is in fact all that’s left of his grace, if the very human emptiness in his stomach and sweat on his back are anything to go by. He needs to find a phone. And humans, he’s found, are more receptive to requests when the asker is clothed. So, clothes first.
“And you can still listen, while that’s happening?”
Dean reminds himself that he’d trust Jody with his life. Has done, more than once. But entrusting some dude named Carl with
, Cas' hands pushing his knees apart, and oh fuck, this is going to get embarrassing real fast, and Dean didn't wait more than ten years only to -
“I see. So like sex, the best fishing happens with someone you love.”
Plates practically licked clean, Dean leans back against the vinyl bench with a satisfied hum. Cas dabs his mouth carefully with a napkin and then sets about stacking the plates and silverware into tidy piles. The waitress smiles at him when she clears the table, like recognizing like. Working in the service industry leaves a permanent mark on a person.
“No?”
Cas sits back on his heels, and Dean feels the loss of his tongue with a swoop in his gut. Cas’ eyes travel over him as he gets his belt off, then pops the button, lowers the zipper so slow Dean’s gonna stroke out before he sees Cas’ dick.
Cas gets his hands under Dean’s ass, tugging him forward until Dean lets go of the bed and repositions himself in Cas’ lap, legs wrapped around his back and Dean’s dick trapped between their bodies.
Dean scans the page quickly. “Oh. Yeah, that would do it.”
“There is a perfectly functional bed right
“You know what that means though, right? I ain’t got a lot of friends, man.” Not a whole lot of living ones, anyway, and none as good as Cas.
“Jesus Christ.” Dean blinks, mouth slack.
“So who’s going to take care of shit around here?” Dean asks, visions of fucking Cas in front of a crackling fireplace fading in the face of their larger responsibility to the hunting community.
Dean pictures it, the two of them in their best fake-FBI suits, standing in front of the nine or so people they like who are still alive. Promising to honor and love each other for the rest of their days. Who needs that? Except maybe...he needs that.
“Quite the opposite, actually,” Cas answers with a small smile.
“I would look at you, while I tell you all the things that make you my favorite being to ever walk this earth,” Cas says hotly into his ear, the weirdest pillow talk and yet alarmingly effective.
By unspoken agreement, they let themselves into the house, removing their shoes at the door in a probably-unnecessary show of respect that still feels warranted. Besides going up to the attic to repair the rafters when he was working on the roof, Dean hasn’t been in here much. They make their way to the living room at the back, and sit side by side on the olive green, 1970’s sofa facing the window. As they watch lightning streak across the sky and listen to the pitter patter of hailstones hitting the patio outside, Dean tries to decide if some dry ice and Sam’s hair dryer will be enough to get the dents out of the Impala’s roof tomorrow.
“Not intentionally. When an angel is tasked with protecting a human, it is inevitable that certain commonplace elements of their existence will be on display. I didn’t - it wasn’t like I...at the time, it held no personal appeal.”
, that’s - that’s...”
“Please, alright? Please, please, please, I’m
The next hour passes swiftly, as the woman, Farhiya, tells him about a boyfriend back in Boston, a disappointed mother in Rochester, and the nursing program she can’t decide if she wants to complete.
He shuffles into the kitchen, and is greeted by a steaming plate of breakfast on the counter. Eggs and bacon, and familiar-looking berries from the night before. He hears Sam’s voice from the war room.
“As long as it’s not any of that CSI, Law and Order bullshit,” Dean says, leaving the ultimate choice up to Cas. “I fuckin’ hate cop shows.”
“Hm. I see your point. I can think of some less-than-flattering synonyms my brothers and sisters might use in place of ‘optimist,’ however. Naïve, foolhardy, headstrong, imprudent, rash -”
“What?” Dean is quickly being outmaneuvered. Of course, Cas’ version of what feels suspiciously like flirting would be a verbal sparring match. “I mean, I wouldn’t stop you. Obviously. Every man, angel, whatever for himself, I guess.”
“I think you know me better than anyone, and better than you think.”
They drink the rest of their tea and say goodnight in the hall between their bedrooms. The bed is still too firm, the room too unnaturally dark and still, but Cas sleeps. Must have been the chamomile.
Sam and Eileen join them as they’re taking their seats. Jack passes around a bowl of fruit, and Cas refills their coffee cups. They shoot the shit for a while and compliment Dean's cooking (as they damn well should), until conversation dies back. Everyone full of the breakfast voted Most Likely to Send a Person Back to Bed, it's now or never.
Cas nods. “I do.”
“No, like a questionnaire - nevermind. Forget I asked.”
Dean smiles.
He isn’t disappointed. Dean wraps his arms around his shoulders, Cas’ hands coming up around his back, and he’s being held so, so tight.
Cas laughs softly, bracing his unoccupied hand on the back of Dean’s thigh.
“Uh.” A semi passing on the highway behind the diner chooses that moment to let off its engine break, the jackhammer sound of it knocking inside Dean’s skull and no-doubt giving him away.
Cas smiles wryly. “Funny.”
Cas smiles. Beams, really. "I just - have you met a cow? In person? They're delightful. Their eyes alone..."
Dean shrugs. "Uh huh, sure. Well, I'm making pizza tonight. Fig, prosciutto, and arugula. It's gonna be awesome."
“This is an ‘every day for the rest of our lives’ thing, Dean,” Cas says easily, hand gentle on the side of his face, “If you’ll have me.”
“Time to sleep, buddy,” Dean says, patting Cas’ finely-haired stomach. Such a nice stomach. All of Cas is nice, really. Man, he’s exhausted.
Dean laughs, but it’s cut short when Cas applies pressure in the center of his palm. Dean bites off a moan.
Dean's hand freezes in the hair at the base of Cas' neck. "Oh my God, no. I'll hide the scissors and the razor. Salt and burn ‘em just to be safe."
“Yeah, I know. Fuck, me too, god, how do you
. That’s the one. Everything was different, after that.”
love with him. The force of it works him over, feels like stepping into a rainstorm and getting punched in the gut and riding a bike too fast down a steep hill.
“In my duffel, there’s a pocket—you’ll need that first. And a towel. Then, you can just...”
He sees himself sleeping in a dozen shitty motel rooms, always badly. He watches Cas place a steady palm on his back or his shoulder or his arm, and then, invariably, he sees his own face settle and his fists unclench in the sheets. He feels how proud Cas is each time, how glad he is that he can do this one small thing right.
His hand goes to Dean’s face then, both to give reassurance and to seek out an anchor. Dean tips his forehead against Cas’, sharing the same air.
Cas thanks him and retreats to the bathroom. Dean is more than a little disappointed by that.
The first time they’d done this had been a haphazard thing. It had been after a hunt, the type that goes pear-shaped from the jump. Cas had taken a blow to the back of his head and a set of fangs to the meat of his thigh before the nest was under control. With his grace depleted, he hadn’t been able to heal himself before Dean had seen the blood dripping onto the barn’s dirt floor. Why does all the worst shit happen in barns? Dean had broken land speed records on the way back to their shitty motel on the ass-end of Tulsa. One he’d gotten Cas undressed and situated on an already-stained motel towel, he’d threatened to tie him to the bed if he didn’t stop fidgeting and messing up Dean’s stitches.
“Do you practice when you call
The shuffle of showers and changing clothes before they settle into their respective beds is unremarkable. This in itself is surprising. Cas now occupies a reality where he has openly talked about how long he’s loved Dean and then not an hour later argued with him about the relative merits of Cheers re-runs vs. a children’s cooking competition as ideal pre-sleep television programming.
“This really bothers you, doesn’t it?” Dean asks.
He’s about to head out on a beer run on some random Friday night when the keys to the Impala go missing. He could’ve sworn he put them in their usual place, the hook just inside the door to the garage, but maybe he’d forgotten and they’d gotten mixed up in the laundry. Except, no, his jeans are all clean and put away in his dresser, and surely he’d have noticed his keys when he was folding.
Cas nods. “Yes, Dean.” His name, always his name, dozens of times before nights like this are through. “Please.”
“Uh. I can neither confirm nor deny -”
Dean spits into the sink. “So...is that still the plan? When are we heading out?”
“Sure, man,” Dean says with a yawn, shutting his eyes. “G’night, then.”
,” they drive south. They kiss at every stop for gas, and Dean feels drunk on Cas’ proximity as corn fields give way to wheat and then cotton. Being awake for nearly 36 hours catches up to him somewhere near Oklahoma City, and he falls asleep with Cas’ hand on his thigh.
They make their excuses to Sam and Jack, earning a highly sarcastic eye roll from Sam. Dean’s fingers are laced with Cas’ as they make their way down the bunker’s long hallway to Dean’s room. Or, as it’s been for the last couple months,
Dean sighs and sets down his beef bourguignon-laden fork, a tragedy if there ever was one. After tonight, it’s all diner food for the next who knows how many days. He and Cas are headed to California for a hunt.
Dean laughs, knocks his knee against Cas’ in silent apology for bogarting the cookies. “Anyway. Sam, too. We’re - I don’t know. it’s different than it used to be. Warmer, I think. Less fighting about life and death shit. Now it’s just empty threats about serving him medium-rare burgers in punishment for him suggesting we add bluetooth speakers to Baby.”
“A quality writing implement makes a world of difference. We should consider upgrading the office supplies around the bunker.”
Dean’s hands are uncooperative and slow as he attempts to slide the knot loose. It doesn’t help at all that Cas’s fingers have wandered across the blanket and are now drawing patterns on Dean’s knee.
“Debatable,” Dean replies, before shaking his head and getting out of the car. Cas only has a moment to attempt to decipher that before Dean drops his duffel bag into Cas’ lap. “Pick out whatever you want.”
Instead, he gets one hand around Cas' wrist and the other in his hair and then they're kissing, fucking finally. Someone's crying, it's probably Dean but maybe Cas too. His ears are ringing, his palms are hot, and he hasn't taken a breath in probably too long, but none of that matters because that's Cas' goddamn tongue in his goddamn mouth.
Stripping down to his t-shirt (Dean’s t-shirt) and boxers, (Dean’s boxers), he settles into the middle of the bed, pulling the blankets up to his chin. Now, what should he do with his arms? He can’t seem to remember what position is natural. Down at his sides? Hands clasped on his chest? That seems too formal. Closing his eyes - that step is common sense, at least.
Cas' hands join Dean's on top of his head, lacing his fingers with Dean's and shifting their joined hands down until Dean thoroughly gets the message. Cas doesn't move an inch until Dean makes him. Dean alternates rocking up into his mouth with dragging Cas head up and down on his dick, Cas’ hands gripping just above his knees. Each time he slides his cock back home in Cas' throat, he earns a cut-off moan from Cas that he can feel in his bones.
Dean watches the woman cup Cas' face in both of her hands, and from this angle, he can see the way Cas' eyes have gone wide. Dean would kill to know what she’s saying to him. He quietly steps closer until Cas’ gaze meets his over the woman’s shoulder.
Dean looks up at him, and Cas pulls back enough for him to nod without the risk of hurting him. He’d beg if he had to, for Cas to keep going. It doesn’t seem like Cas is going to make him beg. Maybe next time.
Cas pressing him against the back of the motel room door is pretty good too. Even better is the leg Cas slots between his as they kiss, and the way Cas loudly gasps his name when he’s arching off the bed twenty minutes later.
Cas sets his chopsticks down carefully on his plate and gives Dean his full attention.
“Then we drive a little. Hey, what about Six Flags? Eileen was planning on heading back this way once she finishes up this run-of-the-mill haunting over in Indianapolis. What if we met her in St. Louis?”
“He was very clear that this would be a one-time thing. He’s traveling for business, apparently.”
It’s not like Dean forgot. Not for a second. Instead, he feels the weight of all the shit Cas gave up so he could save the world and spend the rest of his days ganking baddies and complimenting Dean’s cooking.
“The vagaries of human sexual orientation were new to me at the time,” Cas says, understating it just a little, “and then, apropos of nothing, you mentioned that puppets on a children’s show were gay and that you were going to facilitate me having sex.
The tavern next to the motel is little more than a door in a concrete block wall, a neon Budweiser sign in what passes for a window. Dean flashes him a skeptical look before they head inside, but Cas holds out hope that more than 800 positive reviews for its signature stuffed burgers can’t be wrong.
“Finally,” Sam says. He hugs them both, blinks back tears, and it’s embarrassing for everyone involved. Dean loves it, but that’s a secret he’ll take to the grave.
Cas looks around the room for Dean’s cast-off clothes. “If you’d be more comfortable, we can -”
Some of the warmth drops out of the air, replaced with a chilled, clammy breeze on the back of his neck. Dean may not be doing it on purpose, but clouds creep in across the sky from the north all the same, casting shadows on the surface of the lake.
“Uh...when you say ‘all,’ you mean...all?” Dean says, eyeing the shoeboxes of berries with no small amount of grief.
He isn’t intending to start an argument. Semi-competitive martyrdom is an overplayed song at this point. But here in the bunker’s dim lighting, the dark circles under Dean’s eyes are as obvious as the deep creases at the corners of his mouth as he stands there frowning. This was one small, insignificant thing Cas could take off his shoulders, and apologizing for it would be disingenuous.
Cas just rolls his eyes and sips his Earl Grey.
“As I was saying, I have less of a need to call you now that I can simply knock on your door. Were you worried the waitress might make assumptions about our relationship based on -”
Dean has nothing to add to that. Cas is right, after all. Dean has done more than his share of remembering, of sifting out the good from the bad from someone’s life at the side of a burning pyre. Hell, he’s done that for Cas. More than once.
“Isn’t it?” Cas says, lips returning to the divot between collarbone and shoulder and setting his teeth in.
“There’s nothing to be afraid of. I won’t hurt you.”
Cas carefully re-folds the map, smoothing down the creases before returning it to the glovebox and giving Dean his full attention.
“You don’t think there’s too much mustard in the marinade? I wasn’t totally sure on substituting the Dijon for the -”
Dean sets his plate on the table with a clatter. “Regenerate? What the fuck?”
A minute or two later, just as Dean starts to worry that they’re getting stood up for the weirdest appointment of all time, the creature’s head appears, the tip of its tail swishing through the shallows.
“No. You can’t jump to blaming yourself so quickly.” Cas fishes his hand out of the blankets, pressing a kiss to the heel of his palm before lacing their fingers together. “Let me explain. Your persistence, the volume of your prayers - it all proved more than the Empty could sleep through. It offered me one final deal, to cut its losses. My grace - a boost of power sufficient to put all the angels and demons there back to sleep - for my freedom. As a human.”
Dean laughs, and it hurts. “You already know the answer to the second half.”
“Fuck that guy,” Dean can’t help but interrupt. Cas nods his agreement.
Cas nods.
. Cas lets him lead it - Dean’s under no illusions about that. He lets Dean lick open his mouth, slow and then desperate until Cas is tracing fingertips up his spine under his shirt like Dean is a spooked horse rather than a 40-something guy about to (hopefully) fuck his best friend.
“Hello?” Sam says, and Cas’ shoulders sag with relief.
...oh golly, here I go.” She blots at her eyes, and Dean offers her a handkerchief from his jacket pocket.
"I thought so," Cas says, obviously pleased. “Take off your clothes, Dean. Don’t make it a performance. I just want to see you.”
Dean wants to press, to needle at him until he gets a begrudging answer out of Cas about how he obviously prefers stacked blondes in red lipstick and combat boots so that he can be sure, finally, that he stands no goddamn chance. But he doesn’t.
"Not what I meant. The plant is fine. He'll love it, I'm sure. Maybe we can get one of those fancy grow-light things."
“Fine. You know everything, I get it.
"Hello, Dean."
“And you finally have time to do it.”
“Yeah, you can - more of that,” Dean breathes against the side of his face. The first thing he’s asked for, just for himself. Cas wants to give it to him.
“Yeah. Uh. It was. It is. But maybe he’s not gone. Not all the way gone, anyway.”
Cas kisses like it means something. Like
“Thank you,” Cas says. You didn’t need to do that.”
“You thought I’d pull my punches?” Cas says consideringly. “So, as I was saying, you’re conscientious. Please don’t think I haven’t noticed that you change the Continental’s oil every 5,000 miles on the dot. Or that you always buy Sam his oversized bags of carrots for juicing even though they take up the fridge’s entire produce drawer.”
“Burgers sound okay?” Dean asks, mouth thin. He digs his phone out of his pocket, unlocking and handing it over. “Find us a spot, yeah?”
The shower beckons eventually, and they both cram under the shitty, two-short nozzle to wash each other clean, kissing water from one another’s lips until shower sex starts sounding like a better idea than it ever, ever is.
“Nicely, Dean,” Cas says, dragging his cock so slowly out until just the head is still inside.
Dean slides the long end out of the knot, then helps the rest unravel before tugging the whole thing through Cas’ collar until it slips out into his hand.
“Is that an argument?” Cas says, one eyebrow arched.
Cas parks the car a quarter mile past their target, going so far as to do a perfect, Driver’s Ed-quality three point turn in order to have the car facing the opposite direction from where they came.
In the distance, he sees the double blow of a baleen whale, a spout of water shooting up twenty feet in the air. He watches it slip below the surface again, and he breathes.
“Got it two weeks ago when I bought us the place,” Dean says. "Sam helped."
He sees his own face at the footsteps of a house in Colorado, when Cas was someone else entirely with no memory at all of him. Jesus, did he really look at Cas like that? Like he...like he always...
“Thanks, Claire. Say hi to everybody for me.”
“Okay, so that’s the dream. You, me, Sam, and Jack. Some hippy in a beach hut renting us boards. California, Hawaii, I don’t care.”
“That’s good,
Cas assesses himself. Nothing pressing, but human bodies have requirements that will soon be making themselves known.
“Enjoying a TV binge with Eileen.”
Dean scrubs a hand through his hair and thinks of at least forty reasons why he should.
“You want me to talk about my sexual interests and objectives, such as they are?”
“I don’t think this chair has the craftsmanship to withstand -” Dean shifts forward, knees pressing into the back of the creaking chair, finally getting things lined up like they should be, “the combined weight of two full-grown men.”
“For the rest of our days,” Dean says with a yawn. “And most importantly right now, our nights. I have it on good authority that there’s a memory foam mattress in there calling our names.”
” Cas says, indignant. “How 'tough' can a child,"
. It’s all miraculous. He never thought he would see any of it again.
"Dude, come on,” Dean says, fucking himself on Cas’ hand and knowing it’s begging, not caring at all. “I've been ready for
“That good?” Such a simple touch, and yet.
“Good, so good,” Cas says, stroking that hand over his lower back, soothing.
“In that case, Keanu Reeves,” Dean says. “He builds motorcycles, had a shitty dad, and might be immortal. Figure we’d have a lot to talk about.”
“Alternatively, what is the Impala’s towing capacity?”
“I’m sorry—was it too much?” Cas asks quietly, barely audible over the birdsong filling the air.
“Makes sense. She got me a self-help book on cognitive-behavioral therapy.” It was pretty good, too. Identifying negative self-talk, resetting the patterns in his thinking. He should write her a fuckin’ thank you card. Send her a bouquet of flowers. She’d probably hate that. “Anyway, yeah. I got my shots recently enough, I think? Actually, funny story - it was the last time I was here. Did I tell you about when I broke my leg and almost got eaten at the Leviathan hospital?”
Dean leans back on his hands, face tilted up to the sky. Then, he sees it—stars streaking north to south, beelining for the ground or the limits of space itself. Pinpoints of twisting, spinning light condense and burst apart in a cosmic fireworks display that contains colors Dean has never seen. Stars swoop down and hover close enough to touch before they ricochet back out into the immeasurable distance. Dean clasps a hand on Cas’ steady arm as the dock sways beneath them in the unnatural tide, but it’s not because he’s scared. He hasn’t been scared of Cas in years. Maybe he never has been.
“Thanks, Cas. I thought of another one for you, too. You’re an optimist.”
“So as for what I’d change... I suppose it would be to add critical thinking to the arsenal of requisite angelic skills, rather than obedience. Considering our father’s absence, the course of history would have benefited from the most powerful beings in existence acting as something other than mindless soldiers.”
“So you define your life most essentially by your relationships,” Cas says with a serious nod, like Dean’s answer was something profound.
“Promises are exceptionally important in aquatic reptilian culture,” Cas says. “It will be here, waiting for us.”
Dean zones out then, lulled by the warmth of the fire, the warmth of Cas’ palm on his skin, the slow and searching pressure of the fingers inside him.
“Like you too,” Dean murmurs. “And I’m not leaving. You okay?”
“Yeah, your baby babbling in Sumerian before she starts crawling might’ve been a giveaway that something was up,” Dean says. He’s not wrong.
Sam clears his throat and blinks rapidly. “No, uh, sorry. I just. I’m really happy for you guys. It’s already at like, move-into-each-other’s-rooms stage?”
"We're going to require additional buckets," Cas says, reverence threaded through his voice.
Color rising in Dean’s cheeks, and Cas doesn’t want to embarrass him.
“Breakfast?” Cas asks.
In the hair care aisle, Cas reads the back of at least ten different bottles, popping the cap and sniffing each one, before making his decision. Dean watches him from the corner of his eye while pretending to investigate the styling gel options. Cas places his selection into the cart, and they head toward the homewares department.
"I think we dicked this question up. Pretty sure the answer is supposed to be like, 'pitch a no-hit game in the World Series' or something," Dean says after he realizes he’s left his hand on Cas’ knee for more than a normal amount of time. Thankfully, Cas doesn’t seem to notice.
Dean preens, because of course he does. His bread is fuckin' great. Last week, he made a seeded semolina that nearly brought Sam to tears. Or maybe it was Jack. Somebody almost cried, and it wasn’t just him.
“Nevermind,” Cas backtracks. “In that case, there is a U-Haul less than a mile away. You can drop me off there and follow behind on the way to Grand Haven.”
Cas raises his eyebrows. “Then your brother’s nearby presence is a reality you’re going to have to adjust to.”
But, if Cas’ gentle mouth on the shell of his ear and fingers tracing over the knobs of his spine are any indication, this is different. And sure as shit isn’t a one-time thing. It better not be, anyway. This all needs to happen somewhere more tangible than his subconscious. Preferably in his bed.
“Whatever you want, buddy.”
"They're perfectly safe, Dean. More than that, actually - they have an exceptionally high amount of phytonutrients. I think...I think they're a gift."
“Fingers crossed and all that. If yeah, if I get the chance, I’m going to set things right with the kid.”
"It's a fact. I don't need much time to recite a fact. Perhaps it’s apocryphal to call him a Founding Father, but he played a pivotal role in the passage of the 12th Amendment after the constitutional crisis of 1800. That’s often forgotten."
“It’s okay. I enjoyed sleeping with you last night too, Dean.”
“What the fuck is going on. You think the other angels—” Dean cuts himself off, realizing that they've still got a civilian within earshot who doesn’t need to have his world shaken any more than it already has been today. "Hey Carl, thanks for the ride, man. We owe you."
Dean lifts his hips and crawls off. There’s no way to do it gracefully, but Cas is too far gone to care. His knees wobble when he stands at the foot of the bed, bracing himself with a hand on the footboard for a beat while he tries to focus on the task at hand. Gauging how much slack to add to the line is hard as hell when Cas’ cock is
. Someone who can’t be there. A familiar hand reaches forward, and the world disappears for one disorienting moment, and then he registers the feeling of his feet on steady ground instead of the floor of a shaking roller coaster car. He nearly flat falls on his ass, stumbling and then bracing himself against the edge of a table just before he hits the dirt.
The next morning, Dean gets up early to run some errands while Cas sleeps in. It feels vaguely sacreligious, leaving Cas when he’s all laid out in their bed, the long line of his naked back on display.
Cas smiles, fingers trailing down his arm until he’s giving his hand a small squeeze.
“Totally.”
“‘Treasured’ is an interesting adjective. It doesn’t say ‘happiest.’”
Dean glances at him and then away, eyes wide like Cas knows something he shouldn’t. What, Cas has no idea.
“You will not rush me in this,” Cas says eventually, licking his lips and starting up again, tongue circling the head and working him over.
“No! I mean, yeah, but not like that, just -” goddamn little brothers, Jesus Christ. “I don’t really want to hear it from Sam, you get that?”
Dean fidgets on his stool. “I mean, you know me and school weren’t on the best of terms, I might’ve missed out on...that.”
“One could argue you could have seen that from the comfort of your own bed.”
Hyacinth returns, setting a plate down between them.
“Hey, don’t we still have a couple of those questions left?” Dean says into the quiet.
“Yes, I did. Do. Love you, in every form you’ve taken.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you really going to insist on a false premise that you are comfortable sleeping atop the blankets?”
Cas drives the next leg through central Illinois, past sun-faded billboards denouncing abortion and handmade election signs for 1980's presidential candidates. In time-honored tradition, Dean lets him pick the music.
Outside, he pulls his jacket tight around himself and leans against the brick. When he pulls out his phone, dialing Sam comes automatically.
“Saving room for Jesus?”
He encourages Dean to roll over, and Dean keeps his eyes tightly shut as Cas works his way down from his neck to the thin skin over his ribs and on lower, past scars and ticklish spots that make Dean take quick, shuddering breaths.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Thanks for the sympathy. It’s a good thing I’m not allergic or something.”
“Whenever you’re ready, man,” Dean says, his voice rough and well-fucked.
“I can feel many things now, Dean. Fortunately, most of them are far more pleasant.”
“I used to walk through your mind, memories parting like overgrown grass as I picked out each hurt, old and new.”
Even Sam eats pie for breakfast now. He says he’s just enthusiastic about the antioxidants, but Dean knows for a fact that his raspberry pie is so good, it’s brought at least one grown man to tears. That man was Dean, sure, but still. Damn good pie.
“Just a quick hand job first,” Dean bargains, reaching for the lube on the nightstand. “You can come on my ass, too.”
Cas pushes down the bone-deep worry that springs to mind, that Dean is angling for him to make other plans, plans that take him away from him, away from the bunker.
“I don’t want you to have to
“Yeah, no. I think we would’ve caught wind of it, with Jack helping out upstairs and everything.”
It should scare him, maybe, how much he means that. Dean would hand over anything he wants, anything he could think to ask for, and more besides. As certain as he is in that knowledge, he’s even more certain that Cas would never ask for something he doesn’t already want to give.
“The youth of today are passionate and inspiring, Dean. We should be proud.”
“Well, fortunately as we live together, there are fewer occasions when I need to -”
Cas nods, pleased. The arc of the moral universe is long, but bends toward justice. Dean relaxes in his seat, one hand dropping to the small space between their seats. Cas is more conscious of the distance than he would prefer, some significant part of his brain dedicated to informing him at regular intervals that if he were to shift his own hand to the left by a scant number of inches, they’d be touching.
Dean grins. Yes he is.
“I didn’t say ‘boring,’ I said ‘peace.’ We engaged in non-violent ecological preservation yesterday. That looks like peace to me. Try adding some additional hoisin to your soup.”
“Please, Dean.”
“What?" Cas says defensively, tucking a stray curl behind his ear and slipping his phone into his back pocket. “The water pressure from the well is weak, so I was concerned that the areas closer to the faucets would receive the lion’s share of the water, leaving the string beans parched, and that just won’t work. So what I did was -”
“Hit me,” Dean says, wandering a few feet away to sit on a well-weathered log. Cas joins him.
“Marry me. Be with me, the rest of our lives.”
“Sam.”
“Thank
“Hey, you been going grocery shopping? Somewhere new?” Dean asks Sam one morning, as Sam meticulously spreads almond butter on his whole wheat toast.
Dean shivers at the closeness of Cas’ voice in his mind, at how he can still feel Cas' breath against his mouth, inches away. He takes a deep breath before landing on one specific moment.
Cas hums. “Not quite. More like, attempting to subvert Michael’s. You were never his, Dean. You belong to no one but yourself.”
,” The Empty hisses, in Meg’s borrowed voice.
“You want to load this thing into a U-Haul and drive it to Lake Michigan.”
“Are you thinking brownies? There’s a lot of Scottish lore about them,” Sam is saying as Dean rounds the corner, plate in hand. “Maybe the hogboon, given the lack of livestock.”
“You gonna tell me what that means?”
"It's just BuzzFeed. Not
Dean looks around for cups, but this isn’t that kind of place. He’s rapidly coming to grips with the fact that he and Cas are about to be two guys complimenting each other in a room with one bed and floor-to-ceiling wallpaper in a turkey hunting motif.
“Not everything has to happen at once,” Cas says, pressing a kiss to Dean’s temple.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas says. He’s eager for it himself; the leg room available in a late 1990’s Civic leaves something to be desired.
—I think it’s great. I do. But are you...are you alright? Are you going to be happy, like this?”
“Alright, lay it on me.”
“Nothing’s wrong,” Dean says, petting at his face, his shoulders. “I just - I was gonna come and I don’t want to, yet.”
Dean just shakes his head at the mutual tragedy of their backstories. What is he even afraid of?
Dean smiles, nods. "I can do that."
"Yes, I just. I'm fine. My clothes, please."
He considers it, possible positions unfolding in his mind like clicks through a stereoscope reel. “If you want closer, I’m gonna have to pull off for a minute.” Cas groans, and then nods like he's decided this is a price worth paying. “Alright.”
“Nearly all of the supernatural beings and deities associated with the land’s fertility have historically been female in nature.”
“Fair enough. Uh, I’ve got some news, maybe. Nothing guaranteed, but—”
Cas dries his hands carefully and then circles around in front of him, hands going easily to his hips.
“Ballpoint or rollerball?” Sam asks.
“So we’re bringing absinthe into this?” Dean says with a raised eyebrow.
“Out with Charlie. It’s Buffy trivia night at the bar in Mankato. And wait, Isn’t the shovel speech supposed to be for the
“No, I mean. Yeah,” Dean squints an eye, head to the side. “But you don’t have to -”
He pulls back, and it severs the connection. Cas is looking at him, eyes wide and worried.
Cas’ hands move to Dean’s ass, encouraging him up until Cas has enough room to get Dean out of his jeans, out of his boxers, and just like that, Cas is taking the entirety of his dick inside his mouth. Dean could cry, he might be already. Or maybe he hasn’t stopped. Cas sucks like he’s made for it, tight and wet and humming. Dean, for his part, is a mess, hips rocking to meet Cas’ mouth on every hot, slow slide. He’s taking his time and it’s still too fast, Dean’s heart pounding so hard he can feel it in his ears.
It seems like an easy question, but he draws a blank as his mind spins through a myriad assortment of porn stars and rock stars and Mother Teresa. “Oh man. So many options. You go first.”
“Well, I didn’t need a $20 bottle of organic lavender shampoo, but I’m getting one anyway. We all deserve nice things occasionally.”
“Alright. Let’s see.” Cas carefully cleans his fingers with the wet wipes thoughtfully included with their trough of assorted meats and sides before pulling out his phone. “Would you like me to answer first, to give you a chance to eat? The food really is fantastic, Dean. I especially recommend the ‘Eat My Ash’ sauce. The smokiness really compliments the -”
“The last time I cried in front of someone was in that barn, as I was dying. The last time I told you I loved you.”
First on the agenda - a berry buckle. Or a clafoutis. A crisp, maybe? They’re going to need more fruit. And a tart pan, springform, and bundt. The Men of Letters kitchen is sorely lacking in bakeware.
“Fantastic.” His mind, an empty lot full of broken glass and old tires.
Dean takes a bite of garlic bread instead of the stew, a small consolation prize. This guy has saved his life
“Do you need a babysitter?” Sam asks, not unkindly. The question sounds glib, but Dean knows better.
Cas is settled on the left side of the bed, propped up against a couple of pillows he must’ve pilfered from his own room while Dean was showering. He’s reading one of the books from Dean’s dog-eared collection, cover torn clean off. Must be one from the early years, back when most of their reading material came from garage sales and Goodwill.
For a moment, Dean lets that sink in, only to be interrupted by the buzz of a news alert on his phone. He glances at his screen, scanning the article about a couple of corpses with missing gallbladders in Grand Rapids.
“That doesn’t bode well,” Cas says over his shoulder as they both peer inside. “Have you had a tetanus shot any time in recent memory?”
“Nah, we’ve done ‘em all so far, and it’s not like I don’t have things to choose from,” Dean says, kicking a rock out of the path with a bit more force than necessary.
“It would still be a deviation from the vehicle’s manufacturing standards. One that would merit correction, unless by fortunate happenstance the factory’s quality control personnel failed to notice.”
Well.
“I think we could let it out now,” Cas says, grunting and struggling to hold on tight.
“I put him first,” Dean says. He might as well keep talking, though the words feel rusty, like riding a bike that’s been left in the snow all winter. “Every time. I think it kinda fucked something up in me, maybe. But it was worth it.”
, not the having, I didn’t think you - I was at peace if you didn't -” Cas trails off, forehead pressed to Dean’s shoulder.
“I should say not,” Cas says with a scoff. “Dean, the
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
Cas hums, noncommittal, and Dean is very aware that he’s being studied.
“What makes the rice so yellow?” Sam asks, before shoveling some of the saffron pilaf into his mouth.
“Fuck,” Sam says. And that about covers it.
“That’s not it.”
Dean laughs, and nudges Cas' foot underneath the table. “Pot, kettle.”
Night falls eventually, and Farhiya drifts to sleep, her head pillowed on Cas’ shoulder. The bus is quiet, the silence occasionally broken by the sound of a child’s voice and a mother’s shushing, the subdued conversation between pairs of passengers.
“No. I didn’t.”
“You’re gentler than you realize, or will readily admit," Cas says, standing and turning toward him again. "You like this, living here. All of us, together."
“Another question, right now?”
“Dean, she expended her energy to protect the Impala.”
"You make a compelling case," Cas says, laughing softly into his neck before pressing a kiss there. "But yes. We should. First."
Dean nods.
“Figured you could use a pair.”
“Oh my god, we’re raising a Gen Z kid.”
He’d thought he was past the denial stage of grief. Cas is gone, he knows that in the hollowed out place that passes for his beat-up heart, but even so, he’s finding it really hard not to argue with Sam. That was Cas. It felt like Cas, anyway. Something familiar he’d be hard-pressed to articulate but feels true all the same.
“Yes, it’s rather clear on that point. Things get better. Or, they already did. Recently.”
“Better, right?”
from Sam.
“You don’t wanna just...leave it here?”
Dean grins back. Figures.
“Mmhmm. A heist.”
“For the record,” Cas continues, “I’ve wanted to kiss you since at least 2009. That’s probably something important for you to know. For context.”
“Still needs his dad.”
“I stepped on a squash vine the other day and then got stung by a weirdly territorial honeybee. Does that count?”
and the move puts him so close to Cas that the backs of their hands brush.
“It’s something Naomi said to me once. That I, what was it... ‘came off the line with a crack in my chassis.’”
Then, he sees them. Dean, his hands stuffed in his pockets, Sam looking left and right.
“Did you know we - Sam and me - got an inheritance when Bobby died?” Dean says when she leaves.
For the first time in a while, he hopes he doesn’t end up there for a long, long time.
“Just one thing left, I think,” Cas says, quieter than before, eyes scanning over Dean’s face.
each other over the last decade, across universes and dimensions, through wars and endless crises in order to catch a rare moment of peace. Those moments are getting less rare these days.
“Yeah, uh, motel pools were more our thing, growing up. Even when we’d do a job near the coast, Dad always said he didn’t want to risk getting sand in the Impala’s upholstery.”
“Gross.”
“It’s not about - I mean, they’re exemplary, but that’s not the point. Don’t make light of what I’m saying.”
“Uh, thanks,” he manages to say, feeling goosebumps rise on his skin where Cas’ touch has been.
“Yes. It was early in my time on earth, and he must have mistaken my bewilderment at a food truck that sold chicken and waffle ice cream sandwiches for abject poverty. He’s a good choice for a dining companion.”
“Fuck that,” Dean argues. “We’re leaving now. Grab the bags, Sam.”
Cas slides back the zipper as Dean flips on the turn signal to merge back into traffic. He carefully picks through the bag, selecting a well-worn flannel and a soft, grey t-shirt. If he can imagine exactly how Dean’s shoulders look in it, early in the morning when he’s soft and uncaffeinated, who will ever know?
“Yeah, I could eat.” Dean racks his brain. Given that he’s criss-crossed this country a thousand times over, it takes a minute to call up the right stretch of highway in his mental rolodex of roadside grub. “You up for barbecue? There’s this place outside town, best ribs in the state.”
“I’m feeling agreeable,” Cas shrugs, corner of his mouth lifting in a grin.
“Cas, are you adopting this garden?”
Cas crawls onto the bed, tugging Dean up with him until they’re both settled on the pillows, facing one another.
“I believe there was a second component to the question.”
“I mean, kids are great, who doesn’t love kids?”
“Yeah, I know. I’m really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, guys. We might just have to call this one a win and move on,” Sam says, leaning back in his chair.
Dean’s stomach objects—he’s experienced more than enough g force for one day—but he’s on his unsteady feet and headed for the queue line with Sam and Eileen hot on his heels before he can think twice.
He’s white-knuckling the seat bar and bracing for the lurch of gravity when he sees something impossible on the maintenance platform, just for a second. He sees
“English is idiotic,” Cas says, dropping their bags and unscrewing the lid of the bottle. “Alright, I have more nice things to say about you.”
“Uh huh. Okay.” Dean wonders where the nearest office supply store is. Seems a little crazy to drive to Grand Island for pens, but really, what else is he doing with his time? If Cas wants nice pens, he’ll get him nice pens. “What else? Gotta be something better than stolen drugstore pens.”
Cas gingerly roots around in the innumerable drawers and cabinets for a sachet of something herbal as Dean lights the stove. Dean cuts his search short by handing him a box of chamomile seemingly from nowhere. It’s unopened.
Then Cas fucking
“Can I?” Cas says, disbelief coloring his voice but his touch trailing to the skin of Dean’s inner thighs anyway. “I didn’t want to ask for too much. But I...I very much want—”
Dean kisses him then, because he
Something like relief and disappointment churns in his gut, zapping the quick flood of adrenaline. He imagines how it would feel to have the decision taken entirely out of his hands. His subconscious spilling the beans on all the stupid, sappy shit that rolls around his head. A humiliating miracle.
"Jesus, Cas." Dean wipes at his eyes with the back of his hand.
“But,” he says, before he has the chance to pull it back, “Dude, you were married.”
“I think it’s the Wynn.”
“What’s wrong?” Cas grumbles, and Dean feels the reverberation of his voice from where they’re pressed close, chest to back.
A span of minutes is lost after that until Dean can rouse himself enough to reach around blindly for wherever his phone ended up. Cas reaches under the couch and hands it over to him.
exposure? I’ve been living underground for half a decade. I’ll take what I can get.”
Cas gives Dean's foot a meaningful nudge under the table, smiling at his plate as if to say
“‘Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So.’” Cas reads aloud. “That’s an evocative title.”
“Where the hell are you, man?”
Sam clasps a hand on his shoulder, that perfect proud father look on his face. “That’s great, Jack. Let me know if I can help with registration later.”
“Cool. Uh, yeah. Me too," Dean answers, like an absolute idiot. Abort, abort.
Some amount of unknowable time later, Cas returns the stars to a semblance of reality, and they blink out of view as the sun begins to rise.
. Forgive me for not getting spooked when I had ten grand of safety equipment strapped to my body. Carl really does run a tight ship. You should see his Yelp reviews. And his FAA inspection reports.”
Cas demonstrates the accuracy of this assessment when he pushes both hands into Dean’s hips, forcing a groan Dean definitely didn’t intend to let out.
“About what you might expect,” Cas says, turning his hand over to work at the webbing between thumb and forefinger. “For someone who has lived and died as often as you have. It’s an unusual line, to say the least. Few of your kind experience so many temporary sojourns in the afterlife.”
“I don’t know, I’m still working on remembering I’m awake?” Dean says, voice gone frayed. “Reminding myself I’m not dreaming this. Except this wouldn’t be a dream I’d have. My dreams are usually a little more... yeah. You already know all about that. Think I might be a little hysterical. No big deal.”
“Cas.”
“We’re skipping the question.”
“I think - uh. Shit.” He rubs at his forehead, tiredness creeping in around the edges. It’s so
“I took care of that earlier,” Cas says, snaking a hand around Dean’s midsection to wrap around his dick, fingers wrapping around Dean’s. “Free late checkout. All it took was some help on the Friday puzzle. I wasn’t stationed in Europe during the Reformation, but the names of the popes from that era are common knowledge.”
ground."
Dean shakes his head. "We've all been there. She put her minions’ ears out for chatter though, all over the world. Nothing yet. So, covered heaven, hell. That takes care of all the major players.”
Cas situates himself between Dean’s legs again, bottle in hand. Dean lifts his hips, and Cas carefully lays the towel out on the bed. He looks a little unsure, and fiddles with the cap of the lube as his gaze skitters over Dean’s body. Dean takes the bottle from him gently, Cas’ hand in his, then squeezes some onto Cas’ fingers. He guides their hands together to the junction of his thighs, and presses the slick pad of Cas’ index finger against his hole. Cas looks up from where his gaze is fixed on their joined hands, catching Dean’s eyes as he slips the tip of the finger inside.
"Everyone knows camels are the least romantic of the ungulates," Jack chimes in. "Maybe that's why the marriage ultimately failed."
Dean lets his skin go, moving to the other side. “Got naked with someone I - someone I...” He looks at Cas, hoping he’ll fill in the rest of that for himself.
Cas laughs softly, then rocks his hips against the cleft of Dean’s ass in time with the stroke of his hand. It’s a tease, and Dean wants more, but then his traitor stomach growls.
Dean stalls a moment or two longer, eyes on his plate as he tries to look busy assembling a bite that contains the optimal ratio of hashbrowns to eggs to sausage.
“I see.”
“You are?” Dean asks.
. How are you so-” upright, collected, sane
Cas gives him a long moment, waiting to see if elaboration is forthcoming.
“You’re welcome,” Cas says, finally sounding more than a little breathless himself as Dean falls fully apart.
“Wait though, no wings?” Sam asks Cas. “Are you - are you human?”
"Strawberries - heaps of them," Cas says, popping the berry into his mouth and humming.
," he says, wrapping Dean's fingers one by one around the bars. "Keep these here, please."
“I’m...gonna go back inside.”
When he gets wind of a possible case in Ohio—something vaguely familiar involving skeleton masks and tongues ripped out—he passes it off to a couple of hunters ten years younger than him instead of insisting he and Sam take care of it themselves. Call it gut instinct. Better safe than dead.
While Cas’ food sizzles on the cooktop at the back of the diner, he fills Dean in on the events of his latest reincarnation in a low enough voice not to alarm the civilians present. Diplomacy, formal treaties, the ritual where he sacrificed his grace and restored heaven in the process. A new cosmic order that offers the possibility of real redemption, and a place for people to live out eternity with the ones they love rather than their hazily-remembered shadows.
“Caring for someone is never wasted,” he says eventually. Those days weren’t awful for himself alone.
“Sounds like a milk run,” Dean says, and he’s smiling stupid-wide, giddy.
“Uh,” Dean blinks through the grit in his eyes and tries to assess if he’s going to drive them into a ditch if he tries to be a hero. “Hey, hand me that box of tapes. If we get some Metallica going, I can do this.”
“I mean, if Anna could forget who she was when she fell - does it work like that sometimes? Amnesia as a side effect?”
“You got it from here?” Dean asks, throaty and dark. So fucking obvious. His stupid voice would be a dead giveaway if Cas were anyone else. But of course, Cas just nods like helping your buddy undress and then sharing a bed is all totally above-board.
“I did actually check, once. Out of curiosity. A neighboring dimension, one where you were still born in Kansas to Mary and John. No matter the universe, they were poorly suited for one another. In this particular iteration, they divorced when you were six. You spent most of your childhood with your mother and your brother, and the occasional weekend with your father. You had friends, did well in school -”
