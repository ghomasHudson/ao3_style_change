A couple of seconds passed in silence and then the older Winchester carefully asked, "So... did he have anything important to say?"
Sam had to swallow back a lump before he could answer. "Sure. I'll be there in ten."
"Which we don't," Mick added.
Luckily, whoever took his clothes had left his bag behind. It was hardly a comfort though. Dean was pissed. Real pissed. He loved that leather jacket and he was gonna make sure the asshole that took it would be regretting his decision for the rest of his life.
Lucifer's jaw clenched immediately. "I knew it. That pathetic little asshole, I swear..."
"It looks like you're in my personal space," he commented.
Misha was already diving into the fridge, gathering all kinds of ingredients. "So, you never answered," he said, closing the fridge and getting out a frying pan from one of the cupboards. "How did it go on set?"
"Dean..."
"Biology."
Well, he hadn't exactly welcomed any of the other Ilvermorny students. Great. Some kid that wanted to be his friend because he was a Shurley. Why was he not even surprised. Gabriel immediately moved the arrogant-looking, well-built boy that was gonna be his number one victim to second place and decided on this Crowley dude instead. "Good for you, bucko." And he turned back to his food.
To his surprise Sam sent him another text.
"I'll see you at lunch?" Sam asked while he started walking backwards towards his class.
He cursed and continued his way. That information wouldn't get him anywhere. Although he had to admit, one of the words seemed to trigger something in his mind.
Dean kept an eye on his ex-boyfriend until he disappeared out of sight and Sam felt like he could breathe again. That was it then, he'd seen Lucifer again and he'd survived. It hadn't gone much worse than he'd expected. No one had gotten hurt. Nobody had fought. Lucifer hadn't tried to talk to him, just acted like he didn't care, which Sam had already known. Yet, none of that made him feel any better.
Dean had made his decision. Despite the surprising... feelings of attraction he had towards Michael, Dean wasn't ready for something like this. Yes, he liked Michael, the guy was nice, funny and definitely not unattractive. He'd helped Dean multiple times, got him like not many people did and they got along fine. But at the same time he just couldn't shake the feeling they didn't... click. Maybe it had something to do with him being used to dating girls, maybe it was something else entirely, fact was Dean just... couldn't.
He suddenly realized how close he'd been to becoming just like Lucifer when he'd been fighting with Dean and neglecting his friends in favor of his boyfriend. Or well, ex-boyfriend. At that moment, Sam decided he would never let one person have so much power over his life again.
Sam started up. "What?"
Sam was dumbfounded. One of the Shurleys was doing this? What had he done wrong towards them? He hadn't even talked to any of them yet, since most didn't seem very eager to start a conversation and he was too shy to do it himself. "So which one is it?" he asked Lisa, still shocked from the revelation.
"Alright," Lucifer said and then he winked at him. "Coming right up!"
The first one was to Dean:
"But..." Dean started. "How... What are you doing here? Where's Balthazar?"
Did Dean realize he was being a bit of a hypocrite? Maybe. But then again, Michael and him had never actually taken any steps in their "relationship".
He got up. "I've heard there's a candy cart somewhere in here, anyone want anything?"
Then one day everything changed.
Lucifer let out a deep sigh. "Come on, Sammy, we had fun, didn't we? Isn't that what's most important?"
"You know, we can still hang out a little longer," Lucifer said and then suggestively pulled up his eyebrows. "At my place, for example."
With a laugh, Sam shook his head. "Okay, okay. Whatever makes you happy."
Sam gave him a quick nod and Dean got up to walk towards the fridge, praying that that still was where beers were kept. To his relief there were a couple of bottles in the door. Dean grabbed two of them before shutting the fridge.
"Fine. I'll see what I can do."
"Lucifer?" he muttered against the other boy's lips in between kisses.
The older Winchester was already waiting for him, taking his time to put some of his books away.
"Hey, Cas." The other boy sat down next to him. "How are ya?"
to stop it. He wanted to know everything there was to know about him, the boy who had peaked his curiosity, who made him laugh and blush and... happy.
"My brother, who else?" Michael mumbled.
"Honey, that's amazing, I'm so happy for you." Then she turned to Sam. "For both of you, of course."
He allowed a moment of silence to pass by, just in case Dean wanted to spontaneously share something else. Apparently he didn't, which wasn't that much of a shocker, but he could try, right?
"Hurry!" Castiel called after him. "We're already late!"
Sam immediately relaxed into the kiss, enjoying the feeling of Lucifer's by now familiar lips against his own. He closed his eyes in contentment and allowed Lucifer to part his lips by slipping his tongue in. He hesitantly placed his hand against the older boy's chest. This was all still so new and yet it was exciting at the same time. Apparently Lucifer took the gesture as quite the encouragement, because he slid his own hand upward, running his fingers through Sam's hair, and God, did he like that. He let out a moan of pleasure and felt Lucifer smiling in response. When Sam opened his eyes, he was staring right into Lucifer's blue ones.
Sam shook his head. "You know nothing about me and Lucifer." He barely even noticed he'd started almost whispering.
"Hey, watch it!" he called at the guy who- "Gabriel?!"
"Shut your face," Dean mumbled and walked over to the counter to pour himself a cup of his own. He'd never needed it more.
Dean shot him a deathly glare. "No, Sam, but I am your brother and I am responsible for you when Dad or Bobby aren't around. So I'm gonna ask you one more time: what the hell were you doing in a place like The Cage?"
"Easy," Dean grumbled. "He told Sam himself."
When she went for the door without further comment, Gabriel grabbed his stick and basically ran after her.
Misha made his way towards them without as much as a clue of what was going on. "Hey, Jared," he greeted Sam before pecking Dean on the lips, which caused the older Winchester to turn a shade of red that tomatoes would have been jealous of. Sam was trying his very best not to laugh too obviously.
"What, no," Michael said immediately. "I'll come with you. Oh but if you don't mind, can we make a quick stop to drop this off?" He motioned to the bag. "And my family is probably wondering what is taking me so long, I should probably let them know where we're going."
"That's very nice of you but I should probably sit with my family," Cas answered without even looking up.
he sent, then quickly added,
His husband shook his head and put butter in the frying pan. "What is it with you? You've been acting weird from the moment I got home. Did something happen at work?"
Dean nodded. He could understand that. From what Michael did tell him, he could guess whatever had happened, still went deep. "If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine too, I mean, I'd understand but I was just thinking... maybe if I understood better I could convince Sammy, you know."
Eventually, they agreed to go home. Part of Dean didn't want Cas to leave but he also knew they both needed some time to think things over. Which was exactly what he didn't want to do. His brain was starting to feel panicky already.
For a couple of seconds Sam was dumbfounded. This guy was a Shurley? But... Then he remembered what Lisa had told them about the Chuck Shurley's lost son and he laughed, shaking his head.
Lucifer smirked. "They can if they look like you."
He let out a mocking laugh. "Disastrous of course. What did you expect?"
. Speight plays a recurring role, the Archangel Gabriel, originally thought to be a "Trickster" or Loki, in the WB/CW series
"Talking about friends, how's Kevin doing?" Bobby changed the subject. "Haven't seen him in a while."
He heard the movement of fabric and then the sound of the stall next to his opening. "Stand on the toilet seat. I'm going to help you over the partition."
"It was just him actually," Sam answered, embarrassed. "I don't really know any of the others. Although I have to admit they're all a little bit weird."
Nonetheless, Cas answered him, his voice as even as could be. "Yes."
"You want to hang out after school?" Lucifer asked.
The candy Sam thought he understood. That was just Gabriel's way of showing sympathy he guessed. But the Trickster had given Sam his phone number and he had no idea why. Or why he was already getting his phone out for that matter.
"He totally overreacted! I was just being honest with him and I..."
"It's okay," his little brother interrupted him. "Sorry I pushed."
"But, Dean?" Sam told him. "Let's never fight over who we hang out with anymore."
"Dad?" he shouted and made his way towards the kitchen. The talking fell quiet immediately and just when he wanted to enter the kitchen John appeared in the doorframe. Father and son collided in a tight hug.
Dean nodded at the first question, still not understanding how Mick knew his dad.
"What? No," Sam said, becoming confused now too. "Dean doesn't have anything to do with this."
He turned around quickly to walk away but it was too late.
Somewhere during his words Sam had started to feel like he couldn't breathe. It was like the air was stuck in his lungs and he was choking on his own tears. He desperately tried to inhale but he just couldn't and suddenly he was sobbing uncontrollably.
He found a hallway students passed less frequently and settled in a corner, hoping people would just ignore him and leave him alone. He didn't want company. He knew his friends meant well but he just couldn't. Their reactions would always be too much for him to bare right now, no matter what they would be. He knew it wasn't fair towards them but there just wasn't anything they could do right. It would always remind of Jessica. And above all, he just wanted to be alone.
His friend let out a sigh. "It's late. If I come home now, someone will certainly notice and they will wonder where I've been."
"I just wanted to talk to him about it but he wouldn't listen!"
He heard footsteps approaching and could imagine Cas coming to a stop on the other side of the door, only two feet away from him. After a bit of fumbling with the doorknob, he guessed Cas was trying to pull the door open. Just like Dean's earlier attempts, the door did little more than shake a bit.
He shrugged. "Just a soda is fine."
The brothers exchanged a look before Sam turned his eyes to the smaller man. "Uhm yeah, sure," he said, feeling a lot more insecure than he hoped he was letting on.
"I like bees."
Now that he thought of it, Dean'd had enough of that. He wasn't just gonna follow orders from some kid like Gabriel without knowing what he was stepping into. If Gabriel wanted his support, he was gonna have to tell Dean what that big secret weapon of his was, and otherwise the guy could go screw himself.
Michael stopped laughing immediately and looked at Crowley in shock, while Dean's eyebrows shot up in disbelief. "Lucifer is the
He gave her a thankful smile. Meanwhile Jess had sat down next to Sam, talking to him worriedly. It took Sam about three minutes to fall asleep in her lap.
Just as he was about to open the door of his car, a familiar voice called out his name and he froze in place. He took a deep breath before turning around to see Cas hastily make his way towards him, trench coat flying around his legs.
And there the feeling better went. "Because of Michael." It wasn't a question. He knew it was the truth.
His little brother entered the living room and raised his eyebrows, clearly not impressed with Dean's current state. He ignored it though.
Dean swallowed back a sarcastic comment and told him instead, "I need to find a club called The Cage, you know where it is?"
. Not that that was gonna stop Dean but the way the Shurley's eyes seemed to spit fire at him did take him aback a little.
But first there was food. And more importantly, desserts.
"Hello?" he called out, even though he was pretty sure he hadn't heard anyone come in while he was on the toilet. "Is somebody there?"
' he signed instead.
"Stolen," he grumbled, tossing his backpack to the ground.
Two other cars were already parked on the drive, which caused both brothers to smile. Dean shut off the engine and opened the door, Sam followed his lead quickly and they headed towards the front door together. As soon as Dean opened the door he heard two familiar voices chatting.
he thought sarcastically.
"Or Castiel? I've seen him talk to Dean a couple of times-"
Sam was texting. During class. Something he normally would never do. And a part of him did actually feel guilty about it. But he had to admit, the other part felt... well, excited, in a way.
He looked over to the signs Dean was making and tried to figure out what they were talking about. He'd never really been good at signing and it'd been a long time since he'd used it, so he only got half of what was being said. As far as he could tell, Dean was explaining how he'd run into Castiel.
He got a reply only seconds later:
"I know," Cas said but the look in his eyes remained distant and all Dean wanted was to fix it.
He looked up again, back to feeling very, very uncomfortable. Jesus, he had been so preoccupied imagining them together, he hadn't even noticed Michael had started talking again. Well, at least he had been a couple of seconds ago. Now he just looked at Dean worriedly.
The younger Winchester had trouble not sighing and giving up. Adam looked at him sympathetically.
"No alcohol," Sam stated. He remembered his last experience with drinking very vividly and wasn't ready for a second round.
"Who?" Dean asked with a frown.
"Okay then!" Dean said. "I'll see you later! Call me if you need me!"
Did he? It sounded possible. "Yeah, sure. Can you think of anything out of the ordinary when we were recording that one?"
?" Dean interrupted him, his eyes big with shock. "Why would you... They're not...
Sam shrugged. "He was acting decent for a change."
Sam grinned at his screen.
Castiel on the other hand hadn't seen him before, so he asked his brother, "You know him?"
During his last hour Dean got a text from Lisa saying she wouldn't be able to come along with him and Michael after school. Dean sighed. For a moment he contemplated cancelling the whole thing but decided against it. Michael didn't deserve that. And after all Dean still liked the guy. As a friend.
He opened his mouth, ready to give his former friend a real piece of his mind-
Sam huffed at that.
Dean nodded. "Good."
"Because I needed to talk to you," Gabriel simply said. "And I couldn't exactly do it myself, always having my big bro around. Michael's already paranoid enough as it is."
Dean unlocked the car and him and Sam got in. After helping Gabriel into the backseat, Castiel did the same.
Sometimes he felt like he was the older one. Still, it was better than the alternative.
"He wanted Sam to have some company in case you'd bring him," Castiel shrugged.
He hit the dial button. He didn't need to wait long for Crowley to pick up the phone.
?!" Charlie basically shouted.
Sam joined him at the small table. "Yeah, you don't say. Although they really look alike. Seriously, it's creepy. Anyway, what about you? Find anything?"
"I thought you were serious about him."
“Yeah, I guess you could say that.” Cas shifts uncomfortably.
The sex is slow and intense and it’s even better than the dreams Dean’s been having. Each thrust pulls a quiet moan from Cas and Dean tries to commit it to memory. He can’t imagine how he ever forgot this feeling. Not just the physical part of it, which is great, but the all consuming feeling of rightness, of finally being home.
"Not that I'm aware of."
"Fine. Who needs alcohol anyways? We have classic rock," the boy grinned and held out his hand.
"Why are you such a good person?" the other boy asked, shaking his head.
"Will do. Thanks, Bobby," he nodded before hanging up.
"Yeah, he's a Pukwudgie in my year."
The answer came in rather quickly, as if the other boy had been waiting to hear from him. Sam liked that thought.
"Yeah, okay," Sam swallowed in a heavy voice.
"Who else?" Lucifer confirmed his assumptions. "Only one of my brothers is enough of a coward to pull something like this."
At once, Gabriel pulled up his eyebrows and grinned. "
"Alright, movie it is," Dean said, trying to not show how excited he was too obviously.
Next Monday he still hadn't found a solution for all of his problems. So when he saw Michael making his way towards him and Lisa, he practically froze.
Bobby frowned at him. "Of course not, you have any idea what time it is? I've been here for hours! I don't know where the two of you have been, but you sure as hell kept me busy. Called all of your friends to find you."
"If it's any consolation, I've never known him to be very caring to anyone. But then again, we were never exactly close."
Close enough.
She let out a dramatic sigh. "Crazy in love."
"You're not," the Winchester replied immediately. "I wouldn't be offering if I didn't mean it. And you'll like my friends, I promise."
So instead, he decided to play it safe. "Let's save that for tonight, okay?"
Dean's eyes nearly popped out of his head. "Twenty dollars?"
- Michael Shurley
"Yeah I know, alright?" Dean waved her words away. "No good fighting with someone like Lucifer, I get it."
Keeping this from his brother for now was one thing, but acting like nothing was going on in the short amount of time he actually got to see his dad? Sam knew their father wasn't happy with the Shurleys and even though Lucifer had left his family, he had a feeling the man still wouldn't approve of him, much like Dean and Bobby hadn't. But at the same time... Lucifer was his boyfriend. How could he not share something that important with his family?
Unfortunately, Michael knew him long enough to completely ignore his drama and simply said, "Yeah."
Now Dean really started to get angry. "Well, then why the hell did you bring us here in the first place if you're not going to let us in?" he yelled.
Luckily Sam didn't seem to have lost his tongue. "CAS?!"
"This is absolutely insane," Gabriel mumbled, as basically all of the Ilvermorny students stared at the hat with wide eyes. Even Bobby looked a bit taken aback.
Kevin shrugged. "We just had class together but I haven't spoken to him. As soon as the bell rang, he rushed off."
"Good luck," Sam whispered to his little brother, who smiled a bit in return.
The silence was deafening. They were all just watching him in disbelief, wide-eyed, mouths open and everything. Until they all burst out in all kinds of 'why's, that is.
He stared at the words. Oh screw it, who cared if he poured out his heart to the Trickster.
In any other situation, those words would have probably been enough to make Dean's brain crash again. But he was still holding Cas and after that kiss, who the hell cared what it said about him. If "boyfriend" was the word that connected him to the boy in front of him, then he would gladly take it.
"I don't wanna talk about it." And with that he turned around and walked up to the porch.
He shook his head. "No, he hasn't told me anything," he admitted.
"He's not someone you should be worried about though," Balthazar filled in, then subtly pointed towards a slim boy with dark, neatly combed back hair who was sitting by himself. "If you want to worry about someone, do it about
So when the first bell rang and pulled him out of his thoughts, Dean ran.
The moment his eyes had met Lucifer's he'd known. This was all just a game for the bastard. He didn't care that he'd hurt Sammy and he didn't care if Dean would come after him. That little smile on Lucifer's face as he looked at Dean made him think that the guy would actually quite enjoy it. He'd had those two girls next to him and ready within a second. Dean didn't think he wanted to know what that meant...
"You too," the shy voice answered, clearly not used to talking a lot. He didn't know exactly why but Gabriel thought there was something quite adorable about the insecurity in Sam's voice.
Even Sam had to admit that to be true and just gave a small nod, allowing his brother to drop the subject if he wanted to.
"You like Gobstones right?"
"We were four years old," Lucifer told Sam, "when one day Chuck walked in. He was looking for a foster kid to adopt. Now, adoption isn't exactly like you're going grocery shopping so he came by several times, sometimes a couple of days in a row. He wanted to get to know us all a bit better, see who he got along with best."
"Dean!" Castiel shouted as they finally pushed through the doors and he jerked away the arm Dean had held in a tight grip the entire time.
"See you later!" Sam called after him, before turning back to Lucifer.
Cas asked but he didn't sound angry or anything, he sounded... defeated.
And now Sam was blushing too.
"Sure," he answered and they got in.
"What?"
He laughed at the shock clearly visible on... well, all of Gabriel. The guy looked as if his eyes could pop out every second. But he wouldn't be Gabriel if he didn't recover just as quickly. "Okay, what else?"
Dean didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to think. He didn't know how to act in front of Michael. He didn't know how to act in front of Lisa. And he sure as hell didn't know how to act in front of Michael
fearless, as one of you pointed out. She does get scared, she was even nervous about the Sorting Ceremony, although she proclaims not to care about what House she would get into. Perfectly normal of course, especially since she was first to go, but still something to keep in mind. She knows how to manage on her own, she's had to in the past as the child of at least one Muggle."
Sam shrugged. "I don't know, okay? Fact is Dean still doesn't like you. And I don't know what to do about it."
"What the hell are you doing?" Lucifer laughed from behind him.
"No, that can't be it. Gabriel doesn't care about other people."
He thought about the question, biting his bottom lip in the process.
Something was going on with his brother, that much Sam was sure of. If only he knew what it was. He suspected it had something to do with Cas, since Dean had so pointedly avoided Sam's question about him.
family! I was ready to introduce you to my friends as my boyfriend! And all that time, you pretended that I was special and mattered to you and what for? If it wasn't love and it wasn't Michael, then what, Lucifer? Fun? Sex? Was that it?"
When he got to them, he turned to his girlfriend at once. "Hey, can we hang out after school a bit?" he softly spoke, so the others wouldn't hear. "I need to talk to you."
"Good," Dean said. Then he realized what he'd just said. "I mean, that's not... it's good that... we... get to have some time... you know?"
Dean wasn't stupid. He didn't miss the slight fluster that suddenly appeared on Sam's face, he just told himself he'd probably rather not know. Sam was a big boy, he could handle himself.
"Sure, honey," the lady smiled at him. "Will a pumpkin pasty do?"
"I do," Castiel answered protectively. "The ones of my age. The others maybe a bit less, but I do. It's just that Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, even Gabriel, they were always kind of..." Dean could see him choose his words carefully. "the aristocracy of the family, you could say."
The Shurley boy walked past some lockers and tapped one of them. A couple of seconds later the owner tried to open it and it slammed right into their face. Sam couldn't help but laugh at the practical joke, although he had no idea how the guy had pulled it off. It didn't matter, the Trickster was long gone. He hadn't even turned around to watch when the locker had burst open.
"Dean," Cas stopped him. "I love my family. No matter how much we may disagree on things, I can't just turn my back on them."
Dean laughed a little. "'Cause that's gonna happen."
"Bitch."
Sam tried to pick up some of the rumors that were being told, but he could only make out one word: Shurley.
Dean waited until there was a good chance Sam would already be asleep before going upstairs himself. When he entered their room quietly, he saw his brother was curled up under the sheets but he couldn't say if he was sleeping or not. He quickly changed and got into bed.
- Adam Winchester
"Yeah well, so did I," Dean admitted. "But now I'm not so sure anymore."
Castiel was frowning immediately. "Should we go take a look?"
"Hi," a deep voice, presumably Dean, said and Gabriel put out his hand for him to shake it.
"Well, be prepared to meet some of them, 'cause we're going to a party at their place."
"It's not your fault."
"Gee, thanks bro."
Dean nodded and John laughed. "Guess that means you're stuck with me then."
He cleared his throat. "Uh, random question but do you remember that episode that we did a couple of years ago with, you know... us in it? As in
"With difficulty," the Hat admitted.
He shook the idea out of his head. No, he was just going to have to find a way to talk to Cas - preferably without attracting the attention of any other Shurleys - and figure out what the hell had happened Friday and how they were going to go on further.
"Dude, look what I just found in my locker," Dean said, subtly handing him a stack of bills.
He spotted the Shurley family table almost immediately. Michael, in the middle of them as usual, was looking their way, and so was the girl from his class Dean now knew was called Naomi. As soon as they noticed him watching, they turned away of course. Why the hell were they looking at them like that? Maybe it was nothing but Dean had a feeling it was the exact opposite. And he didn't like it one bit.
Dean shrugged. "Don't want some freshman kids to go gossiping about us before we even get a chance to tell anybody ourselves."
"Wanna join us?" Dean asked while walking along to the line.
Oh crap. Now he'd have to talk. "Y-y-yeah?"
"That's not important. What I need to know is how to get rid of it."
Dean frowned. "Wait, you mean the one send away by their father? What does he have to do with your business?"
Technically, he wasn't lying. He did have some stuff to do. Like asking Dean why the hell he'd been talking to Gabriel, for instance.
He checked his phone again and just as he did, he saw Dean crossing the street, along with a guy in a tan trench coat. Sam pulled up his eyebrows in surprise. He was pretty sure he hadn't seen Dean's friend before.
Sam flinched. "Actually, I told Kevin we'd have a gaming night..."
"Thank you," the other boy got out before he took his hand. And pulled him down.
Well, that wasn't what he had been expecting. Not knowing what else to say, Sam simply sent him,
Michael looked at him in a puzzled way. "What, Crowley? Why?"
"So..." Dean started. "You ditched him?"
Ignoring a fangirling Charlie next to him, Dean shrugged. "I don't know," he mocked. "Maybe you could... well, let's see... jeez, actually
His classmate smiled again, clearly very satisfied. "Here's the deal: I'll go in and find your brother for you."
"Seriously?" Sam commented. "We're starting to basically have pizza every week."
And he was. As he sank back into the mattress and Lucifer's body fitted against his, it was all Sam ever wanted. There was nothing he'd like better than letting Lucifer know how he felt, showing him how much this meant to him, sharing the joy that was rushing through him, telling him-
"Sam," Gabriel sighed. "I wish I was lying, okay? They may be dicks but I love my brothers. Both of them. So trust me if I say I know Lucifer isn't any worse than Michael. But he also isn't any better." He averted his eyes for a second and when they met Sam's again, his voice dropped. "They're broken, Sam, and I know you like to think that you can fix it but you can't. This isn't about you, or Dean for that matter. It's about two brothers that loved each other and betrayed each other. And that's not gonna change, not until one or the other lets go. There's nothing you can do about that. Nobody can save 'em but them, Sam."
"I'll be in Ravenclaw, Dean in Gryffindor and Adam in Hufflepuff," Sam told her.
"Only one. But nobody got his name."
Without further ado the teachers turned around and the doors opened. Some children gasped for air as soon as the Great Hall came into view. Most of them at the sight of the enormous room that looked so much older than the one in Ilvermorny, others, like Dean Winchester, at the food that was already waiting for them on the tables.
"Actually," he admitted sheepishly, "we kind of already have plans for tonight. There's this club called The Cage and it's kinda cool. You can join us if you want to." He quickly looked back at Lucifer, suddenly doubtful. "Right?"
"I don't know," Castiel confessed. "What do you want to be next?"
"Wait, who's that Shurley guy?"
Michael pulled up an eyebrow. "So you're saying that if your father, whose judgement you trust beyond anything, told your brother - for a very good reason by the way - to leave, you would pick Sam's side and go with him?"
"This place is nice," he said, and Dean grinned. That was the kind of reaction he'd been hoping for after all.
He was mostly ignored during the meal itself, his fellow Americans too scared to get close to him, the Hogwarts students talking among themselves. He'd just started his third Cauldron Cake (he was really digging those) when someone finally did address him.
He had been thinking about the 'but' from the moment Lucifer dropped him off yesterday until the middle of the night, when he'd finally fallen asleep. He'd thought about Lucifer, about those daring blue eyes and the mocking grin. The day they'd met, their visits to the Cage, the time they'd spend in the Corvette, he played it all back in his head. He remembered how Lucifer made him feel, the courage he gave him and the adrenaline that rushed through his body because every second with Lucifer was like an adventure, but also how easily the other boy's flirtations made him feel uncomfortable or blush or the butterflies in his stomach spring to life. Sam had realized all of that. And although he had never actually been in a relationship with another guy, he'd always been open to it. Never told a living soul but still. And he certainly would've never ever even dared to approach someone that way, but
? He sighed to himself. He would have to make up his mind by the end of the day and he knew it.
"Really? Why?" Lucifer asked and Sam was surprised by how interested the other boy seemed.
"That's alright, I don't mind," he said truthfully. "Could use some company."
"Fine, I guess," he mumbled. Then something occurred to him. Or rather
He was about to open his mouth, but as usual Gabriel beat him to it. "Nope. Actually we only moved here to go to college. We're from Sioux Falls, South Dakota. But KU seemed nice and we were kinda moving anyway so..."
Now he really was confused. "Who? Balthazar?"
- Castiel Shurley
Lucifer looked at him with actual terror in his eyes. "Please tell me you're talking about the island."
believe you," he stressed, his voice filled with honesty, emotion and... yes, maybe love.
When he quickly checked his phone, Sam actually saw two new messages from Gabriel.
Dean surges forward and plants a quick kiss on Cas’ cheek and his own cheeks immediately flush crimson. Cas flashes him a grin before initiating a kiss of his own. His hands bury themselves in Dean’s hair and he lets his tongue tease at Dean’s lips until he opens up for him. Dean's hands grip Cas' waist and he pulls the other man's body flush against his. Cas pulls away a second later and gently pushes Dean back a step before it can go any further. Knowing that he won't be able to stop himself if it does, he takes a steading breath.
“Won’t judge what?” Dean said a little too defensively.
“I just really need to see you right now.”
“That’s mother for you. Efficient even in death.” They both chuckle sadly and then Gabe wraps his arms around his younger brother in a bone crushing hug.
It’s his turn to order so he stands back up and waves goodbye. “See you around Jack” He says and Jack waves back “And Jack’s dad” He winks at Cas and then turns to the barista. Cas’ face flushes hot for a moment before he quickly ushers Jack out the door and to the office.
“Exactly, he does it all the time. So I started listening closer and he’s been humming . . .” Sam pauses for dramatic effect. “Taylor Swift songs.” Sam laughs.
Cas rushes out of the movie theater as soon as Dean is out of sight. He’d almost kissed the other man several times throughout the movie. He’d lean over to comment on something or steal a kiss, like they used to do before, and then remember everything and reluctantly pull himself back. Having Dean that close was the best and worst thing that could have happened that night. He really needed to talk to someone about it.
-----------------
Dean leads Sam to the top of a small hill and then places the box on the ground.
-------------
“So, Dinner? I'm making teriyaki chicken with rice and mixed veggies.”
Dean can clearly remember the feeling of Cas’ sweaty skin beneath his hands and the taste of him on his tongue but it all seemed so impossible. Dean is fairly certain he’s never been with Cas like that. He is firmly set in the closet and Cas is straight. When would something like that even happen? He tries to focus on something else, anything else, other than his dream. Slowly he puts the ticket stubbs back and picks up his tie, trying to figure out why it is in the box.
“Yeah!” Sam cheers “I’m starving” he rubs his little belly. Bobby chuckles at that and ushers the children into the kitchen to start breakfast. He finds himself hoping John will take his time, while he fries up some eggs. Sam is running around his kitchen with his rocket ship, making his own sound effects, and Dean stuffs two Reese's peanut butter cups in his mouth at once.
“You’re the definition of a dinner party.” Dean grumbles and stomps out of the room. He doesn’t want people to come over in another of Sam’s attempts to jog his memory. The last one didn’t work and it’s been nearly two months. Dean has resigned himself to the fact that his memory might never come back.
“What? That’s not… you think he’s in the closet too?” Sam asks.
“No wonder I keep you around.” Dean laughs. Cas grins at the joke but his heart breaks just a little too. Dean used to say that all the time. Every time Cas made him a pie Dean would say “I’m gonna have to keep you around” or “I might marry you if you keep bringing me pie”
“Cas, I don’t think this is the best time.” Dean tries. Cas just shakes his head and fights back tears.
He finds his parents and younger brother all gathered around a flustered looking Castiel in the living room a few minutes later. Cas looks up at him with wide eyed fear and Dean gives him a quizzical look. He knew Cas had a hard time with meeting new people but he never thought his family could scare the guy off in less than five minutes. Cas is clearly sending him SOS signals but before Dean can even begin to process what to do his mother jumps up and pulls him into a tight hug, finally.
“No, daddy did not kiss Santa,” Cas answers for him.
Cas is simultaneously proud and a little bit sad when Jack tells them that he was not one of the children goofing off. He’s proud because his son is well behaved and respectful of his teachers but it makes him a little sad because he never wants the kid to just blindly follow orders. He wants him to make his own decisions.
“Because nobody else knew.” Cas mumbles. He’s so quiet that Dean nearly misses it.
“Clair, remember how I was working late at the hospital last night?” Cas asks her gently. She nods.
“Sorry man.” Dean’s not sorry at all. Then he reminds himself that the guy’s straight and even if he doesn’t have a girlfriend it doesn’t mean he’d be interested in Dean.
“It’s just a flat metal tray.” Dean tells him and then cheers in triumph when he spots it buried underneath some pots. He pulls it out and hands it to Jack.
“It’s a girl!” He cheers and the handful of people in the waiting room clap at his news. “We have a girl, and she’s perfect guys. You have to come see her.” He and Eileen had chosen not to know the sex of their baby before she was born. Eileen said she liked the idea of a surprise.
“Thanks, burgers are my specialty.” Dean beams with pride.
“It’s a Christmas tree.” Dean says as if the nephilim knows anything about Christmas. Jack just squints at him even more and Dean is struck, yet again, with how much the kid reminds him of Cas. “It’s a tradition, you put up the tree and Santa leaves presents under it on Christmas Eve.”
Sure He and Dean had known each other for nearly four years now. They had a lot of classes together but up until a year ago they were only acquaintances. The kind of acquaintance where you know the person’s face and you might nod a hello when you pass each other on campus but other than that you don’t really talk. They had been paired together on a project for one of their design classes. They had to design a green, sustainable office building for the final and they were assigned partners at the beginning of the semester and then give half the semester’s class time to work on it. He and dean had spent several weeks together on that project.
“Shit, sorry. Something came up.”
“I’m not.” Dean argues and then he sees Charlie. “Hey Char, am I intimidating?” He asks her and she gives it a montents thought.
The rest of their coworkers finish distributing their gifts until they’re all opened and then they disperse to find food and drinks. Castiel just runs a thumb across one of the tiny bees with a soft smile and Dean feels a little self conscious.
“What dragon?” Dean sounds less excited and more frantic.
Dean eventually reaches his limit and shuffles down the hall to his room, stopping to check on the sleeping child on the way. Sam follows soon after and he too pokes his head into Jack’s room before reaching his own room. Cas wanders the bunker silently for several hours, periodically checking in on his sleeping family. Sam and Dean know he checks on the kid but they don’t know that he checks on them every night too, occasionally soothing nightmares before they can get too bad. He never mentions it in the morning because Dean has told him it’s “creepy to watch people sleep dude” and he doesn’t want them to feel uncomfortable. But he also doesn’t want to stop doing it.
“Charlie” Sam tries to stop her but she’s not paying attention.
“Doesn’t matter now anyway, she’s dead and she can’t hurt anyone else.” Dean pats him on the shoulder and then carries his bag out to the car. Sam follows him and when Dean starts the car the radio starts playing Deck The Halls and Sam quickly changes the station. Dean just smirks at him and they head back to the bunker.
When Dean stumbles into the kitchen the next morning Sam is already up making waffles.
“I hope they didn’t have to put in too much effort.” He bites his bottom lip and Dean has to fight the sudden urge to reach up and run his thumb across it.
He goes back to the group and tells them not to expect Dean or Cas back any time soon. No one asks him to elaborate.
“Oh, um, that--that’s not necessary.” Cas stammared.
“Glad I could be of service, now will you put that thing away so we can finish our movie?”
“I told you the last time we talked. Cas, we met a few months ago.”
Dean nods and takes one last sip of his coffee. “If I’d known you were coming I would have done the whole christmas thing with the tree and the gifts.” he says in an attempt at a conversation.
“Why are there so many people here?” Jack wonders aloud and narrowly misses being run down by a gruff looking old man exiting the store.
“Morning, how’d you sleep?” He asks Dean cheerily.
“What girl?” Sam looks at his brother with a furrowed brow.
Dean: Hey me too.
“I don’t mind at all.” Cas whispers against Dean’s lips and then presses in for a deeper kiss.
“I can’t babysit for you tonight. I caught a bug or something and threw up at school. I was going to call you earlier but I fell asleep in the car on the way home and I just woke up. I’m so sorry.” Dean sighs and looks at the time again. He wonders if he can find a last minute sitter before dinner.
“Where do you even get a book that big?” Dean leans over and asks Sam who just shrugs.
“Makes sense.” She signs back and Sam has to agree with her. Now that he’s actually looking at them from a different perspective he can see why their friends call them an old married couple. He can also see why it took him so long to realize. They’ve always been this close; it was just a little more toned down before.
After Jack has left to do whatever it is he’s been doing, and Sam and Eileen go to bed, Dean gently tugs Cas by the hand as he makes his way to his room. Cas lets himself be led and then sits quietly at the foot of Dean’s bed while he changes into night clothes. Then Dean slowly pushes Cas’ coats off his shoulders and pulls his shirt untucked. Cas looks at him curiously as Dean bends down to pull off Cas’ shoes but he doesn’t ask. Once Dean is satisfied he climbs into his bed and tugs Cas down next to him.
“Will you send us copies of these?” Cas asks as he hands her camera back.
Ten minutes later found Cas sitting at a table alone with a plate of food while his brother and Kali went to track down some alcohol. He could see Garth and his fiancé a few feet away and if he paid attention he could hear snatches of the conversations they had with their guests. He stared at his plate of food as his good mood from earlier started to fade. He thought this would be a nice way to take his mind off of things and catch up with an old friend but it really just served to add salt to the wound. All the happy couples chatting and celebrating made him insanely jealous and bitter. Why did all of these people get to be with the ones the loved but he couldn’t? What had he ever done to deserve this?
“Did you have a nightmare last night?” He guesses and she gives a slight nod. She feels bad for not being completely honest but it’s close enough to the truth. He holds his arms out to her, silently asking if she needs a hug and she realises she does.
“About me?” Cas asks.
Dean follows Cas to Gabe’s apartment and after they make sure he’s safely passed out on his couch they go back to Cas’ place.
“I heard about Dean. Is he alright?” Cas’ ears perked up at the name and he pretended not to listen to Garth and Sam’s conversation.
“Yeah?”
“Peppermint hot chocolate. That actually sounds pretty good. I’ll take one of those.” He looks down from the menu hanging on the wall and makes eye contact with Sam, giving him a kind smile. Sam scowles back and aggressively pounds the order into the cash register. Novak’s smile falters and he looks around confused. Charlie elbows Sam in the side, hard, and he remembers that he’s at work so he plasters on a fake smile.
Mary had smothered her eldest son with kisses and bone crushing hugs the second she saw him. John rolled his eyes at his wife with a gruff “Kid’s fine, see? Still in one piece.” And if the hug he gave Dean lasted a little longer and was just a tad bit tighter than normal, well, neither of them said anything about it.
“It was nice meeting you.” Sam shoots back awkwardly.
“I asked him to come dad.”
They play trains for hours and then they order a pizza and watch some cartoons. Dean thinks he could get used to something like this but he doesn’t let the thought linger for long. He hasn’t even asked Castiel on a date yet, doesn’t even know if he’s into guys. He’s got time to figure it out though. He’s got a fresh new year on the horizon and he thinks there’s no better time to start something.
“No one knows. The doctors are hopeful that they’ll be triggered once he gets back to his normal life but they might never come back.”
“Jack it’s time to go.” Cas tells him after their order is ready and Jack looks downcast.
--------------------
“Look who’s under the mistletoe.” He giggles and Charlie wants to murder him. Benny looks up and then quickly back down at the little redhead next to him. His face flushes in embarrassment.
“Jack did you wash your hands?” Dean asks the little boy as he climbs up onto his booster seat.
When Eileen told him she’d never been ice skating he’d been a little surprised but then when he actually thought about it he didn’t know why it surprised him. She was a hunter, and an orphan. Who would have taken her ice skating? Sam himself had had a similar lack of traditional Christmas activities until he got to college and started dating Jess. He tried not to dwell on that memory. The Last time he went ice skating was with Jess just a few months before she died.
“Hey buddy.” Sam loves his nephew but he kinda wishes he would go bother his dads and give him some time to get acquainted with the beautiful woman in front of him.
“Speak of the devil.” Dean opens the door to find his oversized brother behind it. He Introduces Sam to Eileen and then explains the situation. Sam doesn’t have a problem with their improvised plan either so Dean sends him and Eileen into the livingroom to “get to know each other” and pulls Cas into the kitchen to help make dinner.
"Thank you," Castiel laughed. "My adopting father was a very unique person."
When Castiel let out a sigh, Dean had the feeling he was starting to get on the guy's nerves. "We are a family, Dean. We're supposed to stick together."
"And why should I have the answer to that?"
Dean was in front of his bedroom, building up the courage to go in. Of course it was his room too and he knew he was being ridiculous but since the fire Sam had barely left it and Dean only got in to sleep, wanting to give his brother some privacy to deal with his emotions. It didn't help he knew Sam wasn't going to be very happy with what he had to say.
Dean frowned his brow. "What do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know?"
But that didn't change the fact he got a very uncomfortable, tingly feeling every time he saw Michael. He wished Castiel had never told him how the other boy felt. He really shouldn't care this much but he did. Not about Michael being bisexual, hell he couldn't care less, but being the subject of it? It was just weird.
"You know that building right besides lot 54? That's KU Law School."
"I don't understand!" Lucifer basically begged. "I still don't get it, why?! I've been thinking and thinking and I... I mean, we had a fight a couple of days earlier but we had fights all the time! It wasn't any different so why..." He shook his head before burying it in his hands. Sam didn't know what to say. Everything he came up with just felt like it wasn't enough. So they just sat in silence for couple of seconds before Lucifer looked up again and ran his fingers through his hair. "He was my best friend. I trusted him. And then he betrayed me and I don't even know why."
"They were nice," Gabriel continued.
Gabriel followed the three pairs of footsteps and also noticed Dean and Sam had started a signing conversation again. Too bad he couldn't understand what they were saying. He wondered if they were talking about him...
"Yes," Michael agreed, nodding frantically. "Yeah, you're absolutely right. We totally should."
"It's not that easy..."
Dean was having trouble keeping the broad smile on his face to a minimum. "Thanks, Cas."
"You don't have to make up for anything, Dean. And I don't want to intrude."
"He'll never listen to you," Dean said, shaking his head. "You're on Michael's side."
"Good," Lucifer grinned. "I've been dying to."
Dean swallowed back his nerves and just said, "Go ahead."
The Winchester himself, however, really started worrying now. He couldn't just go with Ca-
Sam tried to follow him as subtly as possible, which was a lot harder than he'd thought. He managed to keep track of him long enough though to see him getting something from his pocket and then throwing it without stopping to someone near the lockers.
"So? How hot were they?" the smaller Novak asked. "I gotta say, I definitely thought the deaf kid was cute."
"Yes, well, no one messes with me," Crowley sneered but it was obvious he was still embarrassed by what had happened.
Their teacher started talking but Dean barely paid any attention to it. With a frown he opened the paper, and that frown only became deeper when he read what was on it.
Lucifer ended up dropping Sam off at the end of his street, so Dean wouldn't see him. They hadn't really talked anymore and especially not about the kiss. Which only added to Sam's confusion and insecurity of what to expect.
And they were. The three brothers were in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, the final stage of the long journey they'd undertaken since leaving Ilvermorny. They were all beyond excited at this unique experience, Dean was just the only one showing it this much. But that didn't change the fact the Winchesters had indeed been offered an opportunity of a lifetime. As Sam looked out of the window, he wondered what the odds were of being selected for the brand-new exchange program between Hogwarts and Ilvermorny. There were about thirty children on this train right now, all of them at different years and from different Houses. Now, Sam didn't know how many applicants there'd been but he figured quite a lot. This was only a trial, so who knew if they'd get another chance next year?
His brother shrugged. "Doubt he'll ever stop. The guy's almost dramatically stubborn."
"What's up, dudes?" Charlie grinned while squeezing herself in between Dean and Adam. His older brother's smile lit up at the sight of the redheaded girl that was not only his classmate, but also one of his best friends.
Sam just kept staring at the picture. This couldn't be true...
Hoping his brother wouldn't immediately stop talking again, Sam tried, "But you trust Cas."
"Go get the Pukwudgie kid, whoever he is," Dean decided to add. He was ignored.
"I know," he said, but honestly he wasn't even sure if he believed it or not.
Sam quickly wiped his eyes and nodded. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm good."
After a second of hesitation Dean reciprocated the gesture and quickly padded him on the back. When they let go of each other, their gazes locked and once again Dean was blown away by the beauty of Michael's eyes. It was at that moment, their bodies so close to each other and Michael's hand still lingering on his shoulder, that Dean not only thought it, but for the first time also actually acknowledged it.
That made his boyfriend stop. He looked at Sam with a confused frown. "What makes you ask that?"
"I don't wanna talk about it."
Sam's eyes grew wide immediately, a hurt look appearing on his face. Without another word he walked out of the kitchen. Dean instantly regretted what he'd said and went after his brother.
Dean's jaw dropped at that. How could Gabriel possibly... "How do you know?"
"Gross."
The young American rolled his eyes and let out an annoyed sigh.
"Just keep the sex out of my face, okay?"
Oh, and apparently Misha and Jensen had changed their last names when they got married.
"Out where and with which friend?" the older Winchester pushed.
He felt like hitting himself in the face. The last thing he wanted was for Sam to worry about him. "It's nothing, Sammy."
Dean was driving them to school like every other day. There had been nothing special or different about that morning, nothing that could have foretold the tragedy that was about to occur. Sam was simply staring out of the window while Dean was humming along with the music.
"Is something wrong?" he asked in a serious voice with a hint of worry. "You've been quiet. Very quiet."
"Are you sure? Will they still match my outfit?"
Sam desperately shook his head. "But why? You don't even know me, what could you possibly need to talk to me about?"
"... have anything to do with her death?" Gabriel completed his sentence, hurt in his eyes. Nothing like guilt or regret or even surprise, just an indescribable pain. "Is that what he told you?"
"Then Lucifer left, and so did my father. Most of the bad got worse, most of the good..." He didn't have to finish his sentence for Dean to understand.
Next to him, Samandriel had noticed the boy sitting next to Molly who seemed to be following their conversation. "Hi, Adam."
Gabriel was leaning against the wall a little bit behind Lucifer by himself. His usually mocking smile was replaced by a serious look, the candy bar in his hand forgotten. He seemed strangely on edge and was watching the situation in front of him attentively.
Surprising even himself, Dean found that he didn't want to, and after a couple of seconds said, "You ever had a day when the entire universe seems to be out to get to you?"
"Well, it sure as hell wasn't a good one," he grumbled. "I'll see you after school."
"Am not!" Crowley shot back indignantly.
Cas gripped his arm with one hand and used to the other to hold on to the partition so he wouldn't fall off himself. With a lot of effort, hitting his head and praying the container wouldn't fall off the wall, Dean managed to wriggle the upper half of his body over the partition. Lifting his foot from the container and risking his balance, he then tried to swing his left leg over again. It was a bit of a gamble but with Cas holding him steady, he got there. Now the only problem was that there was no place to put his foot down again.
No matter what universe they were in, one thing would never change: Sam and Dean sucked at acting.
There were only a few people in the bathroom, two of the stalls occupied and a couple others who were just about to leave. Dean hoped that none of the guys still doing their business was Bartholomew or something.
For a couple of seconds it was completely silent. Then Sam slowly faced him and mumbled, "I'm going to bed. Goodnight." He went up the stairs without looking back.
Lucifer didn't give him the time to think about it any further, dragging him towards the library's entrance. "Let's go read some books!"
Castiel bit back a sarcastic remark. Instead he got out of the elevator and started his walk to the bus station. His brother followed closely behind.
Again Cas looked at him for a moment but remained silent, and within a couple more minutes Dean turned into a little side road. He hadn't come back here for a while but the place seemed just as empty as usual.
"First of all, they're not the same thing, Dean," Sam explained. "Like I said, Hogwarts Houses have different values. Just because I think you're going to Gryffindor, doesn't mean all Thunderbirds are. And secondly, I won't get to pick. Hogwarts Houses don't pick you, you are assigned to them. By a hat, I've heard."
"No."
They exchanged a look and remained silent. Sam didn't want to keep fighting about this. It was stupid and useless and he knew they were never gonna agree on the subject anyway. And he had to admit he also knew Bobby wouldn't be happy about it.
Lucifer gave him a small smile. "I know you're not. I'm sorry, I shouldn't take it out on you."
The Shurley just looked down at his feet before mumbling a quick, "I'll go wait by the car."
As he was walking through the hallways, Lisa came running up to him. "Hey, Sam!"
He hadn't been kidding but okay? He looked over at his brother, who just shrugged and took a pull from his beer as well. Sam actually didn't think it was that bad. Beer was the least of their problems right now anyway.
He glared back at the Trickster, the rage clearly visible in his eyes. The guy was still watching him and now pulled out his sucker but that was all. The fire wouldn't go out.
"Listen," he decided to start over, "I don't wanna ask you to pick a side. Michael is your brother, I understand that you're loyal to him and I respect that. But you shouldn't just blindly do what he says, Cas, you deserve to make your own choices and I just..." He shrugged and bit down on his lip. "I just wanted you to know that our friendship? It means a lot to me and I... Of course I'm not gonna force you to choose or anything, but what I'm trying to say here is just... Don't make me lose you, too."
Rolling his eyes, Sam opened the door. Then he turned back one last time to give Lucifer a peck on the lips. "Bye."
Misha gave him a small, curious smile. "I don't know what happened on set today but I'm liking what it's done to you."
Dean started pacing back and forth across the pavement while waiting for Crowley to return. Michael just remained silent, looking at him with a worried look on his face. It probably wasn't more than a couple of minutes, but it seemed like hours before the door finally opened and Crowley came out again. Alone.
"They're a bit antisocial," Jo summarized.
Sam replied, hoping that the emoji would make it sound a little less harsh. Admittedly, he was only half joking.
doesn't know about what happened between you and Michael? That's why you didn't do anything about it, you didn't have a clue about what was going on!"
Dean sighed at the memory of why he was here. "I'm looking for Sam."
"Not Gryffindor, huh?" the Hat said. "That's too bad, you'd make a fine Gryffindor underneath all of that deceiving people. Very well, in that case... SLYTHERIN!"
The other guy looked away from him and for the first time Dean thought he could see something like doubt in his eyes. He watched in surprise as Gabriel, the overconfident boy that always had his answer ready, seemed to be looking for the right words.
"It's understandable. This campus is a little bit out of proportion."
Sam let out a little laugh. "Well, that shouldn't be a problem anymore, my supposed husband being the new director."
Sam just rolled his eyes and decided it would be better for both of them to change the subject. "So when did you get this place?"
Kevin cursed at the other end of the line.
They walked to the cafeteria together, where Kevin, Charlie, Jo and Benny were already sitting their regular table. Sam couldn't help but look around for a moment, only to find Lucifer at a table with Ruby, Meg and that jerk Azazel. He still didn't understand how that had suddenly happened. Not that it mattered anymore.
Okay fine, maybe Sam hadn't seen that one coming but that didn't mean he was gonna drop his guard. "No?"
. But since it was about his precious daddy, it apparently is enough of a reason to shame me for the rest of eternity!" he finished sarcastically.
"Oh shit," Charlie muttered and Dean gave her a reassuring squeeze before she made her way to the front of the group. Professor Hudson lifted the hat so she could sit down and then placed it on her head. It was a little big for her but it didn't seem to care.
Michael immediately noticed the worry in his eyes and looked at him sympathetically. "You want my help?" he offered.
He wanted to kiss him.
The stranger smiled at him engagingly. "The Shurleys. At least I'm assuming that's why you were looking so annoyed at one."
He thought he could see an offended look pass Gabriel's features.
"Oh, really?" the Trickster retorted, pulling up an eyebrow.
"Oh by the way, Jensen, Misha asked me when we'd be finished, so he's coming to pick you up," Richard added when he'd finished packing.
Leaving Gabriel to get out on his own, he smiled at the older guy. "It was nice meeting you and your brother."
"TURN IT BACK!"
"Still can't believe you're also into guys now."
They mainly spent the drive towards the diner in silence. Once in a while Michael would make some small remark but otherwise the only sound in the car was the Led Zeppelin music. Dean had expected it to be uncomfortable but surprisingly enough it wasn't, not really. It was as if they'd come to a silent agreement to just enjoy each other's company.
They were just trying to learn a bit more about Jared and Jensen when the door to the trailer slammed open. Sam and Dean jumped and out of instinct went for their guns, which they didn't have on them anymore of course.
Suddenly the two men were in the backseat of what appeared to be a pretty big car with tainted windows, driving along with the sunset. They exchanged a panicked look that seemed to be screaming the same question.
"Would you stop sulking?" Jo asked from the seat next to his.
But where the hell was he supposed to start? They'd already covered their usual investigations. Strange behavior, search different places for clues... There wasn't much left to do. Except for maybe... Was there something they'd forgotten about that had helped them the last time they were sorta here? Dean didn't remember, it had been so long ago. Balthazar, a spell with a bone of a saint and some other crap, that douchebag angel following them, the keys to Balthazar's weapons, Misha, Misha's death, annoying crew members... Was he missing anything?
With that thought in mind, Dean started wandering around the school again, looking for the short boy. He turned a corner... then another... then three more... What was it with the Shurleys and being so incredibly hard to find? After a while he spotted Balthazar. Maybe he'd know where to find Gabriel, but his classmate was with a couple of his siblings and Dean really wasn't in the mood for a repetition of what happened when he'd tried to talk to Cas.
"It's nothing, Dean. I told you, I'm fine."
Dean just smiled back and opened the door. As he got out of the car, Cas did the same and together they walked up to one of the stores. It was cramped into a corner of the square and the sign above the door simply read
"Do we know something about the Houses?" Castiel interrupted his thoughts.
"Fine," Dean grumbled and he started to look around. "If I were a spare key, where would I hide?"
"Sure thing, honey," she smiled and led them to a table. "You boys want to order now or should I come back later?"
"I don't know," Lucifer decided. "I just do. You would too if you'd met you." Then he turned around and started walking back to the club. "Wanna go dance some more?"
Not even remotely surprised, Sam rolled his eyes before sharing what he'd found out. "First of all, yes, Hogwarts is a castle. As are most wizarding schools by the way. It's a lot older than Ilvermorny but as far as I could tell, the two are very similar. Probably because the founders of Ilvermorny based our school off of Hogwarts. So yes, Hogwarts has Houses too, four of them, just like Ilvermorny, although they do represent different values. They're called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. I looked into them a little bit more and I think it's safe to say I will be sorted into Ravenclaw, Dean into Gryffindor, and Adam, you'll probably be in Hufflepuff."
"Jess," Sam whispered and then one of the tears escaped after all. He was scared to death to ask but he had to know. "Did you..."
Lucifer smiled at him and slowly nodded. "Okay then," he sighed. "Here goes nothing."
And when he walked back to the Gryffindor table.
His older brother pulled up his eyebrows in disbelief. "And you're planning on actually doing that? Sam, we're
His little brother stared at him. Then stared some more and realized Dean wasn't joking. Eventually, he opened his mouth to say something but couldn't figure out what, so he closed it again and just continued the staring.
He immediately shook his head, afraid that he'd accidentally maybe hurt Lucifer's feelings. "No. No, of course not, it's just that..." He couldn't stop a blush from spreading across his cheeks. "Don't you think that this is maybe moving a bit fast?"
"You live in the neighborhood?"
"You like it?" he asked, even though the spark in Cas's eyes had already told him the answer.
When no one made a move, Misha looked at them over his shoulder. "Jensen."
"Skip it."
Sam rolled his eyes.
Adam's jaw basically dropped at the offer. "Wha- Really?"
"No," Gabriel said to his relief. "Despite the grumpy arrogance you're a good friend to him and he deserves someone like that. But, Dean?"
He shrugged automatically. "Because she was fucking perfect? Nice, smart, beautiful... God, I loved her, Cas. I never expected to say this but I even thought she could be the one."
"I went over to him to explain how I was feeling about the whole situation. You could say things... escalated a bit."
Gabriel raised an eyebrow. "Now, why would I do that?"
a by now familiar voice said on the other end of the line.
She tried to find out why he wanted it for a while but after a lot of avoiding she dropped it and about half an hour later she sent him the number. He called it immediately.
Michael smiled. "Right. Hey, do you guys wanna hang around a bit after school?" he asked, looking to and fro between Dean and Lisa, who was sat beside her boyfriend.
Instead he started, "About your brother..." And then fell quiet again.
"Dean and I talked," he said, fingers caressing the other boy's. "He said he'd be okay with getting to know you a little bit better. Like, we could all have lunch together, or you could come over for dinner if you'd want to."
John's head snapped up. "You're a captain?" he pressed and when Michael nodded again, frowning in confusion, John exclaimed, "Thank Merlin! The Gryffindor captain went to Ilvermorny and asked me to replace him but I'm not really the leader type, you know... But with the exchange we have some free spots anyway, so you could step in if you'd want to!"
"Seems handy to me," Dean said with a shrug.
Sam's jaw dropped. "But..."
Lucifer tilted his head and shrugged innocently. "You know, one moment you're messing around with Google and the next..."
"Good." As much as he liked Cas, the guy wasn't the easiest one to have small talk with. He was just about to ask another question when he heard Bobby calling him. "Hey, I gotta go, but I'll see you at school, alright?"
Sam and Lucifer were sitting on a brick wall behind The Cage. It was almost 6pm so Lucifer had ordered a pizza and this was the ideal place to eat it.
It was 9pm by then and he'd immediately started calling and texting him like crazy, cursing himself for being so caught up in his own shit he hadn't even thought about his little brother anymore. He felt terrible and nearly panicked when he didn't get an instant reply. What if something had happened to Sam? Dean didn't know where he was, how was he ever supposed to find him? He hadn't even seen him since this morning!
Dean had frowned and shaken his head in confusion. This guy was such a mystery sometimes.
"Sammy, are you drunk?" Dean asked, his eyes big with shock.
His older brother let out a little laugh. "Right back at ya."
"But..."
He made his way over to his usual spot at one end of the bar. After taking a seat, he raised a finger in the general direction of the bartender - they knew his drink at this place - and listened. There was a loud group of guys in one of the booths behind him. A lonely drinker two seats to his right who was in a bad mood if the way they put down their glass was any indication. Two giggling, probably drunk girls a little further. Two men in another booth, more to the right. A couple at a table to his left. Three women at the other side of the bar who seemed to be complaining about the men in their lives.
Sam smiled. "I know right?"
Castiel didn't seem to understand what he meant by that but he didn't say anything about it.
Dean shot her an annoyed glance.
"Do you even want to sit with them?" Dean asked before he could stop himself. He hadn't meant to be that rude but he was really wondering.
"Hey there, Cas," he grinned despite himself.
"Your brother needs you," Crowley told him and Sam immediately felt a pinch of worry in his chest.
Still smiling as well, Cas shook his head. "That hardly seemed necessary."
Misha's eyebrows shot up. "You don't know?"
Dean quickly said his goodbyes and got out.
Dean sent him. Then he hesitated for a second and typed another text.
"What do you mean?"
After a quick nod Lucifer continued his way to the kitchen. "So pepperoni?"
Dean had had his fair amount of family trouble. His mom had died, his dad was gone most of the time, and he'd been responsible for a pretty big part of Sammy's upbringing, but none of that compared Chuck Shurley, the man who had left over twenty children with nothing more than a big house and a pile of cash. Not even a goodbye. He had been dead serious when he'd told Cas he'd go with him on his search for his father, just to teach him a lesson. Cas deserved better than Chuck, better than Michael too, and all of his other asshole siblings. Dean wished he could do something to help him but it seemed like every time he got involved with the Shurleys, it blew up in his face. Well, except for Cas himself maybe but even that had been pretty tricky so far.
Again Sam needed a moment to recover from that, his heart fluttering in his chest. Then he asked,
And he'd taken Dean's hand. What did that mean? Did Cas feel the same way or was it just a comforting gesture?
- Balthazar I.P. Freely
Lucifer laughed. "Already turning tables on me, huh? Okay, first of all I'm probably not gonna go to college, because studying. I don't know what kind of job I want yet. I mean, I'd like to be a CEO of something, I don't even care what, not because I want a big company, but mainly because I like telling people what to do."
"Well, too bad," Dean shot back when the guy tried to get past him again.
"Do I look like I don't?" he retorted. "Lucifer is my friend, Dean!"
He shrugged. "He was never around much. My brother and I moved out five years ago and we haven't spoken to the rest of our family since."
"Coast is clear," he announced once he'd made sure there weren't.
"You can set the table if you like," Dean shrugged before turning on the stove. "Plates are in the second cupboard, cutlery in the top drawer."
Sam looked back at the other boy, who was still seated on the couch. He went to join him again and took his mug from the coffee table. "Thanks."
He actually liked her and that was something that didn't happen very often. Still, he'd convinced her she could possibly be his soulmate and now that it was clear she wasn't, there really was no point in staying together.
"You're the one who wanted to check him out," Dean shrugged.
Dean rolled his eyes.
"But not when you're with Michael."
"Dean!" he yelled and when he didn't get a response, he snatched Dean's phone away.
"I sure hope so," Dean joked. "You free that night?" He immediately realized how that sounded and quickly added, "I mean, I'd maybe like to talk to you about it afterwards if you don't mind. You don't have to, I'd understand, I've been bothering you with my shit enough lately and if you don't want to..."
Dean gave a nod back and patted him on the shoulder. "I'm gonna get dressed real quick but I'll be right back, alright?"
"I don't know, Dean," he yelled, pissed because his brother wouldn't believe him. "It tasted like water, I swear, I had no idea!"
"Okay."
Dean nodded and looked down, embarrassed. "Sorry 'bout that, Bobby."
Sam could barely believe his eyes, his jaw dropping. Anyone who was watching him probably thought he was crazy.
His brother successfully found the vase and even realized he should probably fill it with water first. Tap. Misha was standing right next to the tap. And Dean really didn't want to get that close to the man who had just kissed him on the cheek. He looked from the vase to the tap, to Misha, to his brother, and back to the vase. Yeah, he was so screwed.
"I said it was nothing," Dean grumbled back.
"Did you forget that not only we don't have a clue how that stuff works, we're also terrible at acting?"
"Sure," Michael smiled. "Let me know how things ended with your brother!"
Michael pulled up an eyebrow at him. "I'm sensing a 'but' coming."
Bobby hummed in agreement.
Dean shook his head. "Buddy, I swear you gotta get out more."
Dean tapped his shoulder.
"How were things with Cas? I'd have thought he'd still be here."
Michael nodded. "After that a lot more children followed, as you can probably guess. And everything was great. We all got along fine and even though there were so many of us, we knew we could trust each other. I'm not going to lie to you, Dean, I don't know all of my siblings as well as I wish I did. But we were family. And that was enough."
"Hey, Sam says he knows what Houses we're getting in," Dean was telling Charlie in the meantime.
"Yeah, don't worry about it."
Gryffindor:
He had kissed Cas.
Both Sam and Kevin's jaw dropped and Dean burst out laughing. Charlie gave them a grin as well and then walked towards the first table to their left.
Castiel smiled and it was the most genuine smile Dean had ever seen on him. "I'm free Friday night."
"I told you, it's nothing," Michael glared at him.
"Hey, do you know where Sam is?" he asked hopefully.
"Dude," Dean mumbled, too shocked to say anything else.
Castiel remained as calm as ever. "I was going to say that I'm sorry."
"So, any special events at school today?" Bobby asked after a while.
He started nodding, hesitantly at first but then more confident about his decision. "That would be great, thank you."
"Did he..." he started, then realized he didn't know what he wanted to ask. There was so much about the Shurleys he didn't understand. Except for the fact that he'd been on the wrong side all along. He shook his head and mumbled, "I've been so stupid."
"I still need to tell my friends. But yes, after that you can harass me in public," he joked.
"Ah," Castiel nodded. "That would explain it."
As they walked up to the school building, Sam noticed that Dean was unusually close to him. He was slightly amused by the thought of Dean being prepared to defend him against actually really nothing at all but at the same time he felt grateful. It was a comfortable idea that his brother had his back, as Sam knew he always would.
The Winchester pulled up an eyebrow. "You think you're easy to deal with?"
He took another drink from his beer and went for his phone, glad Sam was still at Kevin's so he had the place for himself. He'd earned it. Bringing the bottle to his lips another time, he held the calling phone to his ear and waited for it to be answered. He didn't have to wait very long.
"So what do we do now?" he carefully asked, becoming shy after everything he'd just admitted.
It was a common word of course but still it reminded him of... something. Something linked to Lucifer.
"Let's go," Castiel sighed before opening the door.
His friend looked up. "Yes, please," he said, joining Dean at the counter.
Just as Dean thought this day couldn't possibly get any worse, the school principle came out. Apparently, he'd been able to hear Dean curse as far as his office.
A couple of hours later at Lawrence Free State High School, the school bell rang and Sam Winchester came running out of the building. He sprinted towards the parking lot, in search of the familiar red convertible. The car wasn't exactly hard to find and as soon as he reached it, he hopped in. He looked back just in time to see Lucifer rushing through the doors. In the meantime some other students were coming out as well and looked at the Shurley strangely as he passed them.
Sam started protesting again but the other guy was already dragging him through the hallways.
Lucifer frowned at him and Sam immediately felt his gut twitch, afraid he'd said something wrong. But then the other boy said, "Does it really matter? No one will believe you anyway. They'll think you're just picking my side."
"Jared? Can we talk for a moment?"
"I won't," Sam interrupted him.
of all people is scared of him. I'm sorry but that just can't be a good sign."
A couple of hours later they got back to the Impala and he offered to drop Michael off at home. He remembered his way to the Shurleys' house and when they got there, he was surprised by how normal it looked in the light of day. It was still huge of course, but it didn't look like a party castle anymore.
Dean shrugged and lent back casually. He was quite enjoying playing with his brother like this. "Enough."
The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Sam told himself he didn't believe two words that had come out of Gabriel's mouth. He wouldn't. But the thought was there and as hard as he tried to just erase the entire memory, it kept nagging at him.
Slytherin:
The thought of Cas joining their lunch table warmed his heart but he knew that would be impossible. "Yeah maybe I'll invite all of you over together some time," he said instead.
Crowley motioned at the same boy Gabriel had indicated as his first target at the beginning of the evening. "That's Arthur Ketch. He can turn out to be an ass sometimes. Actually, you never know what he'll turn out to be, except maybe selfish."
"Don't know."
"Oh. Let's say I recognize unrequited love when I see it," Molly answered with a sad smile, suddenly feeling a bit uncomfortable herself too.
"Sure, no problem," she assured him, just before her eyes turned to his side. "Oh hey, there's Michael."
"I don't know if that's true and I don't want to cause trouble, but I think that wasn't the worst idea," Castiel commented.
Sam shrugged. "Doesn't matter, you wouldn't know them anyway."
When the school bell announced lunch time, Sam told Kevin to go ahead while he went to Dean's locker. His brother had texted him during second period to ask if they could talk in private for a minute. Even though he was definitely surprised by the request, Sam hadn't hesitated for a second. If Dean needed him for whatever it was, he'd be there.
Okay, so that may have hit a nerve. Glaring angrily, Dean told him, "Yes. My dad's out a lot, doing his job. Yes, we don't see him that often and yes, he probably doesn't take care of us the way he should, but he
"I am just doing my duty towards my family!"
That caught him of guard. "What?"
By the time classes started, Dean knew he'd screwed up big time. Challenging Lucifer, getting Cas involved, it was all no good.
Lucifer looked away before mumbling, "What for?"
"Why, Michael? Doesn't he want to talk about Lucifer? Or just in general? He can't be completely ignoring you, there's gotta be something you can do. Why don't you just talk to him about it?"
"Population genetics of bees," Cas answered.
"You know what," he eventually said, "Let's go. Dean doesn't tell me what to do. And it's just a club."
Lucifer interrupted his thoughts by cupping his cheeks and smashing their lips together almost desperately. Sam kissed him back on instinct more than anything else, the thought of what had just happened almost slipping from his mind. He didn't know how long they remained that way. It could've been second or hours of tasting, nipping at each other's lips.
Dean shifted awkwardly at that, and Sam knew he was onto something. "Doesn't matter, it was nothing."
"Bye, Sammy!" Lucifer yelled and Sam waved him goodbye as he drove away.
"I wonder why," Balthazar huffed sarcastically. Then he patted Crowley on the shoulder. "Cheer up, mate, what did you expect? Not everyone allows you to bait them into your debt."
"Gabriel?" Dean repeated incredulously. "Seriously?"
"Alright guys, listen up," Michael started a couple of compartments further down the train and Gabriel rolled his eyes at what without doubt was going to be his family's usual cheering on speech. Hooray.
Dean snickered. "Told you." Then he let out a satisfied breath. "My dad used to take me here once in a while when I was a kid. Sometimes I like to come back when things get messy, you know?"
"Mike, you know I like you, right? I mean, you're an amazing friend and I want you to know I really appreciate everything you've done for me."
He slammed his laptop shut and leaned back in his chair.
"Jackpot," he mumbled to himself as he opened the page. A pensive frown on his face, he started reading through it. It was hella creepy, seeing his own words on screen and realizing that it was all in fact exactly how it had happened. Dean made a face. The thought that millions of people knew all about his life made him feel icky.
"Jealous much," Dean mumbled.
Without nothing else to do he looked around a bit. Most students who finished at this hour had already left. There was a shorter boy waiting at the bus stop, but that was about it. He was leaning against the bus sign and Sam would have told him to be careful because the thing didn't look very trustworthy, but then noticed the folded white stick the guy was fiddling with, swinging it back and forth, and he refrained. He had met blind people before and it was extremely difficult for him to communicate with them.
Nothing.
"That's one thing we agree on," Michael muttered but Dean ignored him completely.
Dean hung up the phone, got up and walked back down the stairs. Sam and Bobby were already seated at the kitchen table.
Dean shrugged. "Oh, that's Cas."
Dean gave him a thumbs-up and with that he grabbed his backpack and walked up the stairs, to his room. Sitting down at his desk, Sam replayed the unexpected meeting from this afternoon.
experienced something like... whatever that had been. This unknown kid had basically just described Charlie's life, simply based off of... what? Her notebook?
"I told you, I had some stuff to do," Dean said, looking down at his pie.
Yep, he definitely shouldn't be thinking of Gabriel's actor that way.
"Yeah Dean,
John let out a sigh of annoyance at the name alone. "Arthur Ketch is Mick's boyfriend and one of those people who confirm the prejudices of Slytherins. Time after time, he's proven himself to be selfish, cold-blooded and everything but trustworthy."
"You guys are quiet," he asked after a while. "Nervous about Sunday?"
"Yup, Chaser. So, what do you think?"
"Sorry," the guy said with an apologetic smile.
Sam had a feeling he was supposed to know who this "Bob-o" was but he honestly didn't have the slightest clue. "When do you think you'll be home?"
His boyfriend finally stopped moving and gave him a confused look. "Is something wrong?"
Sam gave him a little nod. Dean had been so close to Michael for a pretty long time, he guessed it made sense Lucifer was nervous the older Winchester would still judge him.
Lucifer pulled up his eyebrows, dropped his fork and grinned at him. "That's great, Sammy!"
After a couple of seconds of uncomfortable silence Dean asked, "So Michael dragged you along with him?"
Dean closed the remaining distance between them and kissed him. His eyes fluttered shut as their lips met. It was nothing like he'd expected, although he wasn't even sure he'd expected anything at all. Cas's lips were soft against his, and he tasted just a little bit like beer but also sweet, almost like... Was that honey?
"Sooo," Sam tried after a couple of minutes. "End?"
"You tell anyone about this, you'll have me to deal with," Dean warned him, but he couldn't keep a big grin from his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
He slightly shuddered. What a weird word.
Now he was completely clueless. "Dean," he asked his brother. "What is this? What's going on?" And then it hit him. Dean didn't like Lucifer, even though he'd never met him, and he hadn't wanted Sam to go out tonight. "How did you know I was here?"
The surprise on his face quickly switched to a small smile. "Hello, Dean."
Dean sighed and turned to Michael, without letting go of his girlfriend. "Nope. I tried everything but he just wouldn't."
Dean gathered all his courage and breathed out, "Because we're on a break."
Apparently his brother felt the same way, because he cleared his throat before mumbling, "Right." Then he added, "Wait, so you just got here?"
After a couple of seconds, Dean parked the car in front of their apartment.
Dean nodded with a fond smile on his face that had Sam wondering how much time he'd spent with Castiel.
"Done," he said with a smile and motioned her to lead the way.
It was a never-ending point of discussion. Sam had been offered both the Thunderbird and the Horned Serpent and he'd chosen the latter. And his family still wondered why. Well, the truth was Sam had chosen his own path instead of following the family tradition. It wasn't like their dad disapproved of him being a Horned Serpent, it just hadn't been what he expected or hoped for. Both their parents came from a family of proud Thunderbirds. They'd met at Ilvermorny and been together ever since, till the day their mother died at least. Their dad had wanted his boys to continue the family legacy, for them to stick together and be a family, to honor their mom and everything she represented. So even though, after a lot of fights, everyone had finally come to turns with the situation Sam had put them in, sometimes it still rose to the surface to cause trouble.
"Can't promise that," Dean grinned and took a sip from his beer. "You're my little brother. Gotta make sure the guy's got his priorities straight."
His friend came from the other side of the park, so Dean guessed he'd taken a detour. He huffed to himself. The stuff they had to go through for their friendship...
And oh boy, if that didn't leave Dean a blushing, babbling mess for the rest of the dishes.
"Well, yes, but you don't put it on a
"Well, if you ever change your mind..." the other boy went on.
"Yes, it probably is."
Not that Dean really caught that, because his friend had just put an arm around his shoulders. And just maybe he was silently freaking out about it a little. But instead of doing something awkward he told himself to calm down, let it be and move on.
Michael nodded. "I know what they're called but that's it. I have no idea if they're more or less the same as ours. Their names are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Hopefully the teachers will tell us something more about them when we get there. I'll definitely try to find out what I can before the sorting ceremony."
"Scottish," Crowley sneered back at him. "If you're gonna mock me, the least you can do is know what you're talking about."
Castiel sighed and looked annoyed. "Dean, you are the one who wanted to meet up with me. So I suggest you tell me what you wanted to say."
Before his brother could get any worse, Sam decided to intervene. "All I'm saying is I'm happy for you, man."
"But why? I'm having fun," Lucifer whined, way too loud.
Sam kept waiting for who knows how long, until he finally heard Dean's satisfying soft snoring. As soon as he did, he grabbed his phone and held it under the blankets to dim the light.
"What do you mean?" Benny asked with a frown. "Is she sick or something?"
"What?!" Dean said, almost sounding offended. "Of course not!"
"Are you sure, 'cause you seem a little... disturbed."
"Then you better start getting used to them," he just commented.
"But Gabriel is dead," Dean shrugged.
He gave his brother a warm smile. "Thanks, Sammy."
It took Sam a couple of seconds but then he remembered Lucifer'd left his car top down. The Chevy must be drenched by now. The idea made him chuckle too.
He suddenly came to a halt. Jess. How could he have forgotten about her? Sure, the point of his research had been to get his mind off of her, but he hadn't planned on this, on having fun without even thinking about her. Pangs of guilt shot through his chest. He hadn't meant to abandon her...
"He really shouldn't have bothered bringing the two of you though," he continued. "No point in putting so much effort into it while it's hopeless anyways."
He heard footsteps and Misha strode over to the counter that was separating the kitchen from the living room. He placed his arms on top of the shiny marble surface and leaned down, his eyes focused on Dean.
"What are you doing?" Misha suddenly interrupted his thoughts.
Dean pulled up an eyebrow. "So?"
The thought had barely crossed his mind when Cas suddenly turned towards him. He was smiling again, in that careful way of his, and his eyes reflected the sunlight like sapphires.
"He wasn't always like this," Michael explained. "Back then his name wasn't even Lucifer. Dad wanted to give us a fresh start, he renamed us all."
Sam shrugged. "I just... wanted some space, you know?"
It was almost 2am when he went for another refill. As he neared the bar - yes, there was a bar - a guy with dark hair and green eyes approached him. Dean recognized him immediately. It was the same boy Lisa had called the oldest brother, the leader of the Shurleys.
Sam signed as soon as they got home. Signing in the car was always a pain in the ass, since he would have to lip-read and Dean had to keep his eyes on the road.
He hadn't thought it was possible, but now Sam was feeling even more guilty than before. He tried to think about a solution but with Dad home there was no way he'd have any spare time this weekend. He also couldn't cancel on Kevin, he'd already neglected their friendship enough as it was. But... he really did want to see Lucifer's place. He had been curious about it from the moment Lucifer had told him he'd left the Shurleys and lived on his own now. Sam cursed inwardly and got out his phone.
"Yeah, just hold on for a second," he answered while getting his phone out.
"Oh my gosh, Crowcifer!"
"I didn't know you guys were that close," Sam noted.
"I can't say I'm really surprised about him being the Trickster," Cas continued. "He's pretty fond of the whole just desserts idea. What I don't understand is why he would go after you. You've done nothing to him, and I doubt it had something to do with Michael. My oldest brother would never approve of something like this."
Actually there was one person Sam would like to talk to. And apparently his feet agreed because after who knows how long he found himself at the entrance of the cemetery. He walked in and followed the familiar path. Passing by his mother's grave, he let his fingers trace the cold surface for a second before continuing to a patch that was a little further back. When he got there, he let his legs finally give way and dropped into the grass. Through his tears, he stared at the inscription.
Lucifer had noticed his hesitation and leaned on the passenger's door. "You're not going to back down now, are you?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Kevin was still eyeing him skeptically. "Really? Anything?"
Sam laughed and was just about to reply when someone approached them.
"You do?" his younger brother asked.
Now Dean had two options. The easiest one would be to accept their fate and let it go. But he'd already needed to let go so often lately and this whole Michael situation was getting ridiculous. "No."
"You're friends with Shurley Senior. So tell him to keep his little brother under control. That's all I'm asking for."
Sam frowned. "What do you mean?"
Sam didn't think he'd ever fled this fast. And in his line of work, that was saying a lot.
Lucifer frowned and pouted at him. "But then how I am supposed to claim you in public?"
"And that's supposed to stop me?" his brother mocked, raising an eyebrow. He turned back to Dean. "Just keep your brother away from Lucifer." He started to walk away, to a shiny silver car parked at the sidewalk, but at the last moment he looked back at him. "Actually, it would be wise for both of you to stay away from my family in general."
He entered the room, put down his bag and leaned against the teacher's desk while Lucifer closed to door.
Cas glared at him. "They're my family, Dean."
Just when he thought he wouldn't be able to contain himself any longer, the bell rang and broke the tension between them. Sam reluctantly put a step back and Lucifer quickly looked away.
They arrived at the Shurleys' house and Michael got out instantly, speeding towards the front door so they wouldn't lose too much time. He came back after only two minutes max.
Of course he didn't really want to go. He knew all too well everything about the school would remind him of Jess and he didn't exactly look forward to people asking him questions, whispering behind his back or just staring at him sympathetically either.
And that's when it hit Sam. He patted his pockets, looking for his wallet, and when he'd found it, he took out his driver's license. Exactly what he'd expected.
"I, uhm..." she stuttered, "I've been living in the wizarding world for six years now."
"So he didn't tell you anything about his plans for tonight?"
"A bit, yeah," Sam said with a friendly smile.
"So?"
To say Sam was shocked would have been the understatement of the dimension.
"No, hey," Michael was quick to say. "It's alright. I understand. Thank you for being honest with me."
"Oh my god..." he mumbled.
"Hey," he greeted his boyfriend excitedly, having a hard masking his enthusiasm.
He was just about to introduce himself to Michael's brothers when someone behind him shouted, "What's up, bitches?"
Michael nodded, secretly a little bit relieved.
It eventually was 10pm before Sam noticed Dean'd sent him multiple messages and even called him a few times. He was surprised it had taken his brother this long. He'd probably been hanging out with Michael the entire evening.
He'd looked back at Michael and saw the boy's face had completely turned red with anger.
Sam burst out in laughter at that and it didn't take Lucifer long to join him. He walked over to the younger boy and wrapped his arms around him.
"I'll take one of those Cauldron Cakes actually," he answered while checking out the rest of the food.
"Dean?" Castiel interrupted him.
"He is definitely an attractive man," he said.
"I'm in fifth, Samandriel is in fourth," Castiel told her and Samandriel nodded.
Kevin laughed a little. "A club? I don't know, Sam... I mean, I'd like to come with you, but you know stuff like that isn't really my thing."
Sam took a deep breath and forced out the words he'd been practicing in his head. "After Jess and what happened to her, I didn't think I'd ever be ready for another relationship. Honestly, I still don't know if I will be."
He couldn't help but laugh at the scenario and the blind one turned to him immediately. He was met by two of the most beautiful eyes he'd ever seen. The sunlight reflected in them perfectly, like sunshine going through a glass of whiskey.
"Hey." Sam placed a hand on his arm and gave it a little squeeze. "Don't worry about him, okay? He's just being an ass, if we ignore him, he'll stop it eventually." Not that he'd left Sam alone, not until Jess had died. He swallowed away the lump in his throat.
Lisa threw her hair over her shoulder and leaned closer to the three of them, as if she was going to tell some big secret. "Okay, so apparently this insanely rich guy Chuck Shurley yesterday moved into the mansion at Cross Road with all of his children."
Then the other boy spoke again and Dean didn't have to see his face to notice he was getting frustrated as well. "I don't know, Dean, give me a second. It's not like locks are usually easy to open from the outside."
Charlie shook her head. "Nah. Maybe now, he'll finally get out of the closet."
"What is it?"
He was kidding, right? Sam stood up straight and took a deep breath before starting, "Well, I mean..." He cleared his throat and ran a hand through his hair. "Yesterday, at the library, you uhm... you... you kissed me and..." When he realized he didn't know how to finish that sentence, he made some vague gesture with his hands.
"Nooo," Sam sang. "I only had water Dean I ssswear. But... something is really really really wrooong." Then his brother whispered, "I think somewone is... tricking me."
"Mr. Winchester, watch your language please. We don't talk like that at this school. One hour of detention."
Why was he even making this complicated? "Gabriel," he admitted to his brother.
When Sam got out of the Impala, he took a deep breath and determinedly walked towards the school. He had been planning what he was going to say the entire morning and by now he basically knew the words by heart. He was confident he would need them too.
"Well, they mentioned a club."
"Chuck Shurley happened."
"I really doubt he knows me well enough to decide if I'd make a good friend for Sam."
"I do care-"
Charlie's eyes grew wide at that and Benny and Jo immediately inched closer.
"What year are you in?" Mick asked.
After some attempts Mrs. Drover managed to get everyone seated and started class. As usual Dean lost his focus after about five minutes, so he started examining his new classmates. Besides Balthazar and the silent guy next to him there were three others. A couple of chairs to his left two guys, one of them slim and tall, the other one a little bit broader, were seated next to each other. And at the front row sat a girl with brown put up hair, who was wearing, and he wasn't kidding, a woman's suit. Seriously. What was wrong with this family?
"Does anyone actually know what happened between Michael and Lucifer?"
"What?" he said, relieved they could change the subject.
"What am I doing?" Dean exclaimed and Sam could tell he was a lot more pissed off then he'd let on before. "Well, apparently this is my home, so I'm gonna go in and figure out how to get out of this mess! Again!"
"Actually it's Misha," fake Cas corrected him. "You know, just in case you didn't read the marriage license when you signed."
"And I'm definitely gonna be in Ravenclaw too," Kevin added.
They finally pulled up in front of their home and the Winchesters got out of the car. After a quick thanks and goodbye, they went inside and dropped their stuff in the living room.
When he got to the cafeteria, he noticed his brother was already sitting by himself at one of the smaller tables. Dean smiled and joined him. It felt good to spend some time alone with his brother. It had been way too long.
The other boy turned about fifty shades of red at what Lucifer was implying alone before he managed to say, "Fine. We can order pizza."
And then of course the hat started singing.
Sam frowned.
After a couple seconds he carefully looked back at Castiel. "How do you do it?" he asked, his voice almost a whisper.
Sam was about to assure him that it was fine when it finally dawned on him that Castiel Shurley was in his house, having breakfast in his kitchen, wearing his brother's clothes. He'd have to ask Dean about that later.
"... then there really would be no stopping him. Come on, Dean, they're already acting like jackasses, do you really need to give them another reason to hate you?"
Sam would be damned if he told him what had happened between Richard and him, so instead he decided to focus on the one thing that might actually be of use to them. "Richard. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but he is too... Gabriel."
In the meantime Lucifer was laughing so hard he actually doubled up and fell to the ground, right in one of the pools, which made him laugh even harder. By now Sam couldn't control himself either and it took everything for him not to collapse next to his new friend.
"Gabriel?" Sam asked, trying to remember some of the gossip that went around when the Shurleys first got here. "One of the senior Shurleys?"
"Yes. No, well..." He cursed under his breath and leaned against his locker. "We're fine. I just needed some time on my own."
Sam was filled with relief. If they had a computer, that was the first step of their journey figuring this out. "Great. Let's do some researching."
"Yeah well, I didn't like my car being ruined either."
Sam rolled his eyes but smiled all the same. They just sat next to each other in silence for a while until Dean suggested they'd order pizza.
"Then why would your brother believe a crap Michael's told him?"
"So anyways, I was wondering if you'd like to join us for lunch? You don't have to," he quickly added. "I just wanted to offer, you know. As a chance to make it up to you."
Jo smiled. "He won't, eventually. Karma's a pain in the ass."
"He said you'd never do anything like that."
His younger brother shrugged. "I figured out who he was when he was pranking me, so I went to talk to him this morning. He actually had some very interesting stuff to say."
"Yes, you are," Lucifer said without hesitating, making Sam blush just as quickly. Lucifer had that effect on him quite often.
"Oh, right," Sam huffed. Yes, he was being salty but he'd be damned if he didn't deserve to be. "You probably know him as Gabriel."
Honestly Sam didn't know how or where else to find food, so he might as well take advantage of the situation. "Yeah sure, thanks," he answered and then motioned for Dean to follow him to the kitchen as well. It still took his brother a couple of seconds to completely snap out of it, but then he reluctantly strode after Sam.
"That's impossible," Kevin put into words the exact same thing Sam had been thinking, with an almost horrified expression on his face.
When he came back, Sam was looking at him with a genuinely happy smile and Dean had to suppress one of his own. Lucifer was gonna have a long way to go to get into his good books but for his brother he was willing to try. He handed Sam one beer and sat down as he opened his.
He snorted quietly before typing,
"This tastes... not bad," Cas stated.
The next day Dean was storming through the school's hallways in an attempt to find the Trickster - or Gabriel, whatever - for the second time this week. And, as he probably should've seen coming, once again he came up empty. That guy really was annoying. Dean sighed and promised himself that one day he'd get him.
Michael handed him the cups and Dean was just about to take them when he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket.
The funny thing was Dean couldn't see any way this would end well. Everything about this situation seemed doomed to fail. But Cas was right. Before he could even make an attempt at fixing things, he would have to decide what he wanted.
"Thank you, Dean," Castiel smiled back.
"Uhm... yeah, I-I forgot mine," Dean stuttered.
For the full two days they hardly spoke to each other, only exchanging the formalities. Saturday evening Sam moved to their dad's room. Just for sleeping though, somewhere that wasn't in Dean's near proximity. When Bobby came up and found him there, already asleep, he muttered a curse and went to sleep on the couch, because apparently the boys had forgotten he was still there. He decided to just let them be for now and hope they would quit the drama soon enough.
Kevin smiled back at him. "Hey, you still in for a gaming night?"
The other boy rolled his eyes and Gabriel decided to step in before things would get out of hand again. "So which one is she?"
"Wha- But he... the note..."
"You enjoying yourself, Sammy?" Lucifer whispered against his lips and all he could do was nod. Of course that only made Lucifer's smile grow. "Good."
"How do you know my name?"
"Yes, I think I can see why," Cas said, eyes still on the water. "It's peaceful here."
His friend obviously flinched at that. "It isn't something I really enjoy talking about."
"What's gotten your attention?" Lucifer asked from across the table.
Even though he was relieved that it hadn't come to a fight, Sam was still glad to have Dean right by his side when Lucifer casually walked on. As he passed them, he shot Sam a smile that made his stomach turn, and for a moment he thought Dean was going to punch him in the face after all. For a second, Sam almost wished he did. Maybe he would hurt less if Lucifer did too.
They were silent for a moment after that. Sam wasn't really surprised, Castiel hardly spoke in class too. But if he wasn't talking, he was thinking, and Sam didn't want to think.
The look on Michael's face had turned back to a slight frown but Dean could still see the hurt in his eyes. "Just like I said. He isn't here."
"Why's that?"
He quickly looked around the hallway  and he thought his heart stopped when he saw Dean passing them, heading down to the corner that Lucifer had just rounded. Sam knew his brother well enough to realize this meant war.
Sam rolled his eyes and turned around. "What do you want, Crowley?"
"Alrighty," Dean mumbled and took the turn.
"I think you have feelings for Michael."
"Whatever," Sam muttered, but Dean wasn't going to let it go yet.
"Who?" her boyfriend said.
The day went by that way. During every break he went back to his corner, just sitting there on the floor, waiting for his next class to arrive.
"You heard me."
Castiel smiled and softly said, "Thank you, Dean."
Richard lifted an eyebrow and even with the glasses and the cap and the beard it was so... Gabriel. "You sure? 'Cause you acted pretty weird before and now you guys are ridiculously late... By the way, where were you last night? I went home this morning to take a decent shower and change but the place looked like you hadn't even been there at all."
Sam smacked him against the arm and Kevin certainly didn't look amused either. All the while Adam was trying to hide a smile behind his hand.
"Alright," he said. "Let me just quickly get Lucifer and..."
He shrugged and gave his dad a smirk. "We're doing great, Dad."
Playfully, Lucifer's fingers walked up his stomach and Sam had to force himself to not react to it. The soft touches all over his chest made his heartbeat quicken.
"What's wrong with the library?" Sam teased him.
"That's Professor Lestrade," John continued to explain. "He's the Head of Gryffindor. He also teaches Charms."
Dean's voice returned to a grumble. "Yeah, if I ever get him out of Michael's creepy claws."
Crowley shrugged. "You asked if I knew where The Cage is, so I showed you. You'd think you'd be happy I did you a favor."
"Or I'll tell Dad what happened and you know he won't like it!"
he typed and hit 'send' before pocketing his phone again. When he looked up, he could see Cas smiling at his screen and something inside of Dean sent a warm feeling through his body.
Cas turned to him again, the expression on his face a silent question to continue. And what the hell, Dean'd had enough of keeping secrets. So that's how he ended up telling him everything, starting with the note he'd gotten from Balthazar. Castiel's eyes grew wide at the mention of his other brother but he remained silent, allowing Dean to continue his story. He went over everything, his weird talk with Gabriel, the events of Tuesday and what little he knew about the conversation between Sam and the one and only Trickster. To say Cas seemed disturbed by what he was hearing would be an understatement. His frown pretty much got a bit deeper with every word.
"Mick Davies. This is John and... well, you probably know Dean, I guess."
Lucifer tilted his head and looked at him, curiosity sparking in his eyes. "Why don't we go to your favorite place?"
"Aww, that's adorable," she laughed, keeping it quiet enough so no one would hear. "I'm Molly, by the way. Molly Hooper."
, Dean took the time to prepare dinner for when he'd get back home. The note had said 5 pm but who knew how long Balthazar was planning on talking to him. He made some pasta with chicken and tomato sauce and put it in the fridge to reheat it later. As he was cleaning the kitchen, he called Bobby.
"Your point?"
Sam was doing his very best to control the enormous grin that was trying to push its way through. Of course he'd been hoping Dean would come around but he hadn't been expecting it to happen this soon.
"Well, I think it's cute you guys wanna stay friends anyway," Charlie smiled. "You should introduce him sometime."
He took Jensen's phone out of his pocket, glad that he'd taken it from the trailer too, and scrolled through the contacts until he'd found the one that was listed as Jared. He pressed the call button and prayed Sam had gotten a hold of his actor's phone somehow. For a couple of dreadful seconds, Dean listened to the ringing of the phone.
He dropped his head onto his knees and closed his eyes.
Lucifer nodded his head slowly, looking away from him. "Yeah okay, that's alright."
"So do they," Sam said.
Dean frowned at him. What was he talking about? He hadn't come down that fast, had he? "What do you mean?" he asked while sitting down.
"Wasn't Ravenclaw for smart people?" the oldest Winchester mocked, while Professor Hudson continued to call forward students. "'Cause in that case you two can both kiss it goodbye."
"That's too bad, 'cause I don't have any more money on me!"
"Wait," Sam interrupted her. "They're all this guy's children? That's impossible."
"Still can't believe you're dating one," Dean retorted.
Dean shook his head. "No no no no, hey, that's not how it happened, alright? He wanted to talk to you and I didn't see a reason to stop him. I didn't even know he was the Trickster!" Then he stopped himself.
They only had to walk a couple of yards before Crowley turned to a right and walked in between two seemingly very regular buildings. Dean was just about to say something about it when he rounded the corner himself and froze in space. At the far back of the side of one of the buildings was a discreet black door with above it the name he'd been looking for:
He was about to call out Dean's name in surprise, but held back when he noticed Dean was ignoring him completely. He rushed through the classroom, zigzagging between the tables and past Sam's. He only stopped next to the table of one of his classmates, one of the Shurleys, a boy with dark hair who always seemed to be wearing the same trenchcoat. As Sam got more confused with every second, Dean grabbed the guy by the arm and nearly dragged him out of the classroom without further notice.
"He'd never payed that much attention to one of us. Well, except for..."
Lucifer's icy blue eyes turned to him at once and a corner of his mouth slightly lifted at the sight of Sam's now very big smile. "Well, don't you look happy," he commented amusedly.
"I'm not sure I know what I want to be anymore."
Happy holidays, everyone! I suddenly remembered that last year I felt like I should have done a holiday chapter and thought I could do one this year butttt yeah that ain't happening xD Maybe one day in a different fic...
He gave her a grateful smile. "Thanks, Charles."
Misha huffed at him. "Okay? Jeez, thanks, Jensen. I thought you'd be excited."
Adam gave him a comforting smile. "I've seen you play in the Pukwudgie common room a couple of times."
"Oh," was all Samandriel got out. He hadn't expected anyone to have noticed him. Ever. He just wasn't that type of person, only doing what he was supposed to do.
"Balthazar?" he called carefully. He was sure this was the place...
On both sides there were two long tables full of students who were staring at them and at the end was the table for the teachers. Right in the middle of it, in front of a large, golden chair, stood a stern-looking man in a suit. He wasn't even that tall and yet all of the American children at once decided they shouldn't mess with this man. Okay, maybe almost all of the children. His dark hair was thinning out and combed back neatly and his piercing eyes scanned through the group like those of a hawk.
It turned out there were quite a few. They discovered West and Maison Collins were Misha's children from his previous marriage with a woman named Vicki Vantoch. Apparently they'd split up pretty peacefully when Misha and Jensen finally admitted their feelings after years of working together. There was a lot of gossip about the situation but it seemed like Misha and Vicki were still close friends. Dean frowned at that. He didn't know why.
he told himself, getting out his phone to text Cas. He really wished he could tell his friend about all of it. Gabriel had sworn him to secrecy though, and with all of the secrets the guy seemed to know, Dean was pretty sure he didn't want to piss him off.
, but they hadn't even been together for that long yet. Sam wasn't like his brother, this was kinda important to him and he wanted to take his time to get there.
Yes, definitely the second.
"What?" Dean said in a shocked voice. "I didn't... Nothing happened!" He angrily put some spaghetti on his plate.
The brothers exchanged a look. Even if they remembered where Jared Padalecki's house had been last time, clearly this was another universe. Unless Sam's alter ego had divorced that Genevieve girl and decided he was more into guys after all.
Gabriel shrugged. "Well, you know, I was just wondering..."
At last he'd managed to make the other boy smile again. Dean smiled to  himself too, leaning against the wall while waiting for the reply  that would come in any second now.
"Yes...?" Misha replied in a questioning voice.
"What? No, of course not," Crowley said, revulsion all over his face. Dean wasn't sure if it was because of the idea or his stupidity to ask about it. "The Cage doesn't really do ownership. Just think of Lucifer as one of the founding fathers. A board member, if that's something you can wrap your tiny mind around."
Needless to say Sam and Dean's jaws dropped and their eyes nearly jumped out of their sockets at the automated Wikipedia card popping up, picture included.
"Would you two stop it?" Bobby sighed. "I'm trying to have a peaceful meal here."
It seemed like Kevin wasn't going to give him that chance though, because a couple of minutes later he called Sam. There wasn't much of a choice left now. If he didn't pick up, Kevin would probably be even less likely to give up. So, he answered.
And not just pink but neon, probably glow-in-the-dark pink pink.
"The library?" Lucifer suggested with a playful grin.
Lucifer got up and together they walked back to the car. They both had trouble keeping a straight face when they saw the couple inches of water standing in it. Lucifer walked to the driver's seat as seriously as possible and casually jumped in. When he sat down, water ran out of the seat. Sam got in as well and immediately felt the water invading his sneakers, up until that point the only thing on his body that had stayed dry a little bit.
"Where do they get their customers if nobody has ever heard of it?"
It took him a few seconds to realize both of them were now waiting for him to say something.
For a couple of seconds a heavy silence hung in the air. Dean was clearly trying to contain himself, fists clenching and unclenching, his jaw set. Sam was simply waiting for him to burst and get it over with. Castiel just looked from one brother to the other.
friend
Cas nodded. "Okay. Now if you don't mind, I do really need to study."
"Hey," he mumbled, putting an arm around her shoulders by habit. He could tell she knew something was off about him but chose to ignore her worried look and turn to his friends. "What's up?"
Dean nodded, remembering what little Michael had told him about the black sheep of his family. Then something dawned on him. "Wait, so you're saying that Sammy's new bestie is the same guy your dad felt the need to kick out of the house?"
"You think we went too far?" Jo asked, watching him leave.
"Let her finish, Sammy," Dean told him before looking back to Lisa.
Sam followed his big brother back to the living room. Dean was lying on the couch, watching
Sam was almost certain he knew who Lucifer was talking about, but he asked it anyway. "The Trickster?"
John Winchester was one of MACUSA's best and most famous Aurors. He wasn't home very often, so before they went to Ilvermorny, Sam and Dean had spent a lot of time living with their father's friends. Bobby Singer, an old Thunderbird family friend, former Auror and one of the accompanying teachers on the exchange trip, was basically like a second father to them. No, if Sam was being honest with himself, he didn't think their dad would visit. Not unless he'd got a job in the UK too.
When they got to school, Sam almost immediately left his side to go find Lucifer. His little brother had been a little quiet last night, and Dean had been worried maybe something had happened between him and Lucifer but that morning Sam seemed to be back to his usual behavior so he guessed they were alright. Good. He'd kill that asshole if he hurt Sammy.
"We are getting out now," Cas noted.
"Muggle?" Sam interrupted him.
"Am not."
Sam and Dean exchanged a look, and they knew exactly what the other was thinking.
Sam grinned as they started walking through the school's hallways. "What am I, your property?"
Lucifer's eyes turned stone-cold, as if he'd decided he'd had enough of this conversation. "That's not my fault."
The grin that Cas gave him was enough as a response, and even if it weren't, the kiss that followed would have done the trick. The only reason they stopped was because the school bell eventually rang.
Oh so that's why... "Yeah," Dean answered a little surprised. "Although 'best' may be a bit overreacted. You've heard of him?"
"You pissed off the Shurleys, right? Maybe Michael or one of the others sent him after you? Or he decided to take revenge for Michael himself?"
Sam rolled his eyes and opened his locker to get his books. Lucifer rested his head against the locker next to it. "So what are our plans tonight?"
"Yeah, peachy," Dean answered while taking a good mouthful of his soda and clearing his throat.
Dean looked at him suspiciously. "You'll help me get Sam to unfriend Lucifer?"
When they were ready Dean drove them to Lisa's house and then to Jess' and Charlie's, where Benny and Kevin had arrived in the meantime. The Impala wasn't big enough to seat them all, so Charlie drove the others in her own car, following closely behind Dean, because he was the only one who got Balthazar's address.
Lisa looked at him with surprise. "A party? At the Shurleys?"
Dean couldn't help but grin. He'd told Michael how much he loved that place. "Don't need to say that twice."
Sam rolled his eyes at his brother's childish behavior but he also couldn't suppress a smile at the enthusiasm they all shared.
"Oh," Dean cleverly said. Then he decided an actual conversation would probably help the situation a lot better than that. "Yeah okay, I think I'm gonna meet with J-Jared anyway so..."
"Bobby..." Dean tried, but he was interrupted.
"Well, I'm sorry, Dean, but you haven't exactly been brother of the year either. We've barely talked for the last couple of weeks and I know that's partially on me, but it's on you too. You have put me off every time I tried to have a decent conversation, you've completely ignored my opinion on Lucifer, you have shut me out and you have put me aside because of this secretive stuff you won't tell me about and I have taken it, thinking to myself that if you wanted to talk about, you would, but this, having
That was probably the thing that bothered him the most about his disability. How was he supposed to find his soulmate, already one in a seven billion, if he couldn't even talk to a small fifth of the population?
He could see the other boy's eyebrow twitch when he got the message.
Misha let out an annoyed sigh. "No, it's fine... Just... If Rich's not home yet, you can crash here if you want."
And then he pulled out a sucker.
"What did I just say about details? How tall?"
"The Trickster," she said as if it was obvious. When no one responded, she looked at them incredulously. "Really? Am I the only one who knows all the gossip around here?"
"No, seriously, how did you not notice?" Dean asked him the next day for like the twentieth time.
"Don't," he simply said. "He's not worth it."
"Yeah, go ahead," Sam answered. They exchanged a final look before Dean turned around and walked out of the room. Sam let out a sigh.
"Hi, Dean," Michael greeted him and he answered with a smile. "How was the rest of your weekend?"
They exchanged a look, both of them knowing what Lisa had meant to Dean. To their family. First Jess, now Lisa... Nothing was right anymore.
"Jeez, don't have to get all fed up about it," Charlie said, rolling her eyes.
"Oh," Sam said. He could barely remember the last time he and Kevin had gamed together. They always had a great time at Kevin's place and he'd really missed it. But then he remembered what he'd just promised Lucifer.
His friend let out a little laugh. "Dean, I know you mean well. I like that about you. But you don't know what you're talking about."
The stranger let out a little laugh. "I do, but you're not exactly close. Just follow the signs pointing to Green Hall, it's that way," he said, pointing in the direction Dean had just come from.
"Yeah, of course," Dean quickly said, making his way to the cupboard Misha had indicated.
They were actually just having an argument about it that morning when Sam had walked in and told the both of them, to their surprise, that he wanted to go to school. Dean tried to reason with him but he wouldn't give in and their father didn't try to stop him. So he went to school.
Castiel let out a sigh. "What are you trying to say, Gabriel?"
"Of course!" she was quick to say. "No problem at all. What year are you in?"
Dean was a junior, while Sam was still a sophomore. "Six? Ish? I don't know, I've only met Balthazar. How many have you counted?"
"We should get you a dog," he commented when a woman walked by with a seeing-eye dog.
Adam inwardly thanked Merlin that he didn't start blushing like an idiot and managed what he hoped was a normal smile. "Hey, Samandriel."
"Cas?!" He quickly thanked the universe for letting one of his friends find him.
"Yes."
"What?!" Dean gasped but the principle was already leaving. So he just turned to his little brother with a look that just about screamed,
Lucifer sent him and Sam was actually glad he'd brought the conversation back to a lighter note.
Honestly, Sam wasn't that passionate about music but Lucifer had told him it was his favorite shop in town and he had gotten curious. He glanced around a bit while Lucifer started flipping through some vinyls. A couple of electric guitars hung above the counter, next to some of the most famous record-jackets in history. Sam had to admit he didn't know enough about classic rock to recognize all of them but he knew a few.
"Jesus fucking Christ," Dean groaned as soon as he was gone and he dropped back his head. "This is a complete disaster."
Michael gave him a small smile before opening the door. "I'll see you tomorrow, Dean."
Lucifer dropped his head and sighed. "Fine. But you better make it quick."
Luckily he noticed the younger boy almost immediately. He was sitting on his own at one of the smaller tables, surrounded by books and sheets of paper, his trade mark trenchcoat on the back of his chair. Dean walked over to him and when Cas stayed focused on the work in front of him, he tapped his shoulder. Castiel jumped at the sudden gesture and looked up, finally acknowledging Dean's presence.
He was speechless for a moment. He knew it was meant as a compliment but it just made Sam worry he wasn't exactly portraying Jared too well. He really needed to learn more about the man that was supposed to be playing him, not the other way around.
A lot of hours later, Sam fell back onto Lucifer's couch, the other boy right on top of him. His boyfriend really was in the mood for a celebration and it looked like that would be all they were gonna do for the rest of the evening.
Suddenly a frown appeared on Sam's face. "Hey, where's your jacket?"
Kali remained silent for a moment, and he heard her take a sip of her own drink. He knew she loved to keep him guessing, so he waited patiently. Call him arrogant, but he knew what she'd say eventually.
He nodded with a smile. "Sounds good to me if you're up for it."
John shrugged. "Mainly just sharing a room really. Oh and Quidditch of course."
Dean came to a stop immediately. "You
Dean's eyes grew big before he groaned in despair. "Balthazar."
"I know, right?" Dean said through a mouth full of pie. "This place is awesome."
"Uh... actually I didn't really..."
"Are you okay?" Samandriel asked quietly and Michael cursed himself for being so obvious.
Speaking off hell, Sam had decided on something. He was going to find out who had been tricking him for the past few days. It had to be one and the same person, because there was no way all the incidents had just happened coincidentally. Sam was sure of that. So he was going to bust whoever it was and confront them with it. The fun had been taken out of it as soon as they'd gotten him drunk.
"Shurley, Michael!"
"Six," was all she could manage to say.
Dean clenched his jaw. "Well, as far as I can tell, it was all about the talk he had with Sammy."
Lucifer grinned. "Now that's what I'm talking about."
Then he thought of something.
Dean looked insulted. "What's wrong with that? Come on, the guy couldn't have exactly named himself Misha Ackles-Collins, that's just a tongue twister."
"John."
I'm praying to Luci, Chuck and Crowley that this chapter works out. I did a little POV experiment and well... Let's just say that if something isn't perfectly clear, that means I'm leaving it open for interpretation xD
So... he went with it.
He didn't know why but those words seemed to calm him down a bit. "Thanks," he muttered.
The other boy laughed and nodded. "Good to know." He held out his hand. "I'm John. John Watson."
Dean's eyebrows shot up and he looked at him in shock. "A hat?" When Sam just shrugged, he repeated, "A hat is going to tell us in which House we belong?"
"Come on, Cassie, if the hot guy offers you a ride, you take it," Gabriel decided to intervene. He was met by a satisfying silence.
it, Dean. You just... be."
"I call you whatever the hell I want to call you," his friend replied with a mischievous smile.
"You think this place'll be any different from Ilvermorny?"
"Name?" he said.
He'd only just opened his notebook when a shadow fell over the pages. When he looked up, Dean was both surprised and annoyed to see Balthazar Shurley standing in front of his desk. If the guy was there to give him some don't-mess-with-my-brother speech, asses were gonna get kicked.
Dean's jaw dropped and he looked at his brother wide-eyed.
Michael looked at him. "Why do you think my dad kicked him out, Dean? He doesn't care about other people's feelings. He uses them, plays them to get what he wants." His eyes grew apologetically. "I'm sorry, I really wish I didn't have to say this, I saw how happy Sam looked in there. But being friends with Lucifer? It's just not a good idea, Dean, it will only end up getting him hurt even more. I doubt Lucifer would have given him a second look at all if he hadn't been your brother."
- John Watson
Dean gave him the look again.
For the record, just because Gabriel was blind didn't mean he didn't have standards. Okay, that came out wrong and made him sound like a superficial asshole. The point was that he didn't just sleep with anyone (although sometimes it was a close call), he first had to be attracted to them just as much as the next guy. It just wasn't looks that did it.
"Why not? Maybe we can find a lead!" Sam protested. "If not there, then maybe on our way over. That's where we were dropped."
"But he had such a sweet voice!"
Still with a very serious look on his face, Cas stated, "I had never kissed someone before, but I liked it."
"Dean," she said. "Who's your friend?"
"You'll see," Dean grinned. "It's a surprise."
Dean took a deep breath. "Well..." he started. "When Michael and I were still friends, he uhm... kinda had a thing for me and... you know... turned out I may have had a little thing for him too."
The students walked up the aisle until they were standing at the front, where their teachers came to stop.
by Kansas. Sam hadn't heard of them but he knew how much Dean liked to play cassettes in the Impala and after tonight he would have something to make up for.
Gryffindor:
- Samandriel Shurley
Dean's eyes grew big and he looked at Sam for support. Unfortunately, his brother was just as clueless. "Okay?" he tried.
he sent.
He should have gone to his class, but at the moment school was the least of his worries. Luckily he still remembered where Sam was during first period.
"I just don't trust the guy," his dad said. "And I don't really expect his children to be any different."
"Just..." Dean started. "If you get to pick the Gryffindor thing..."
Now Sam's curiosity was really aroused. "But how did you come across it?"
"Not your right, my right."
Dean suddenly remembered the guy who had sat next to him during physics. Why would he have been talking about him?
"Listen," he tried again. "I get you can't just go back to how things were but maybe you could at least try to make amends a bit? How about your dad, he can't still be that angry, right?"
His brother looked at him with something of hurt in his eyes. "And you seriously thought I'd make a problem out of that?" he asked in disbelief.
"Cas," Dean said, looking the boy dead in the eyes. "You
"You sure?" his brother asked.
"Hi, Michael!" Dean shouted through the hallways.
Clif gave them a worried look through the rearview mirror. "Why? You've done it so many times, the fans adore you, everyone's coming over and you don't even have to do any traveling yourselves this time."
, he signed before going back to the Impala to drive to the University of Kansas. He dropped Sam off, waved goodbye and then headed to the garage he worked at. One day he wanted his own garage but right know he needed all the money to support his family and to pay for Sam's education.
Sam rolled his eyes and put a step to the side, putting more room between them.
With a sigh, he grabbed his phone and leaned against the wall.
Sam thanked her with a smile and started taking some books out of his locker. It was when he turned back that he saw them.
Sam looked at him guiltily and mumbled an apology, but there was still a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth.
"You just saw it happen with your own eyes, what more proof do you need?" the guy answered and looked at them patiently, as if he was actually expecting them to come up with another challenge.
He didn't immediately get a reply and he looked up to see Cas staring at his phone, thumbs hovering over the keys. Dean was just about to emphasize that he really didn't have to and that it was fine either way when he got his answer.
"Just two beers is fine, thanks."
Gabriel took out his wallet, dropped a couple of notes onto the bar and downed his drink in a single go. Then he got off of his chair and held out a hand for Kali. "What do you say you and I get out of here and I flatter you all night instead?"
The three of them looked at him, waiting in anticipation for a further explanation. When it didn't seem like they were gonna get any, Sam asked, "What is that?"
But more importantly he couldn't help but wonder what Michael had told his brother. Whatever it was, Sam wouldn't let it destroy his friendship with Lucifer. What he'd said to Dean was true. When he was with Lucifer, it made him feel... alive, in a way. More than usual. Definitely more than after what happened to Jess. And he wasn't going to give up on that.
Dean's eyebrows shot up. "Sorry?"
Cas frowned at the menu. Dean gave him five seconds before he interfered. "He'll have the same."
Michael laughed. "Only the good stuff I hope."
They played like that for at least an hour before Dean was so tired he went to grab another beer as a refreshment. He only noticed then Michael's brothers were still sitting by the tree. One of them, a short guy with golden hair, had actually climbed up onto one of the branches and was eating gummy bears without paying attention to what was going on below him. The other one was sitting a little further off, watching the play attentively.
A part of Sam felt a pinch of guilt at the worry on Bobby's face. He could see Dean was having the same reaction.
"You never loved me, did you?"
Now Sam's face turned red so much and so quickly he didn't have the time nor a way to hide it. He had basically only heard one word.
"What are you smiling about?" Jo teased as soon as she spotted him.
, and Sam sat down next to him.
"Oh hi Mike."
And didn't that turn out just to be the question that would finally make Dean snap. "What happened to me? What
Dean rolled his eyes and turned to put some of his books in his locker. He'd had enough of this whole situation. He didn't want to talk about it even more. So when the school bell finally rang Dean was almost happy he and his friends could get to class. Almost.
Sam gave him a strange look but didn't push, and Dean went back to the living room to watch some TV.
"Like hell that was nothing!" Dean exclaimed. No way he would be dropping it now. "What was it?"
"I don't think we've met yet. The name is Michael," Michael said, offering him his hand.
Dean quickly nodded. "Right." He headed for the door, Sam closely behind, when Richard stopped them.
Sam leaned his head back against the door and closed his eyes, allowing himself to enjoy this moment for two more seconds. But he knew Dean would be mad if he took too long. "I got to go," he whispered and looked back up.
"I haven't seen him in a while," Castiel told him.
, and he held up a bouquet of colorful flowers.
"I will hit you," the older Novak promised.
Sam frowned, no idea what Dean could mean by that. "What are you talking about?"
Lucifer pulled up an eyebrow. "I don't know if you've noticed but neither am I."
Samandriel blushed slightly at the undivided attention suddenly pointed towards him. "Uhm... Well, what Castiel said basically. I don't think there's anything else interesting to mention..."
Dean laughed and nodded a little. "Yeah dude, I invented that trick. Ain't gonna get rid of me that easily."
Cas looked at him and even with the only light in the room coming from the TV, his eyes seemed a little brighter. Then he turned them downwards, as if he was considering the offer attentively. Eventually he simply told Dean, "Okay."
He did know that he was really fricking angry though. To think that he'd been willing to give Lucifer a chance, all for Sam, while Michael was right all along. Well, "right" was maybe a bit of an overstatement. Dean hadn't forgotten the way Michael had treated him just because he thought his dad was some sort of saint.
What was he going to tell his dad about Lucifer? Dean had made it abundantly clear that he had no problem telling John about Sam's friendship with the Shurley. And Dean didn't even know half of it...
"Not that I care," Lucifer continued. "Not anymore at least. What's your deal with our beloved Trickster anyway?"
"Of course you are," Sammy answered and no matter how hard he was trying to hide it, Dean could still see the ridiculous grin on his face.
He downed the rest of his beer in one go.
Then Lucifer suddenly stopped and his eyes grew wide, looking at Sam with shock.
With that his little brother started to walk away, Kevin followed after him, and Dean watched them both go in surprise. Well, that was convenient. He hoped he hadn't just chased Sammy away but he doubted it. Sam almost seemed... happy to leave. Weird.
Rolling his eyes, Sam answered, "Look, he was just being friendly. It's not like we're suddenly friends or something. I didn't just forget the crap he pulled."
Dean didn't feel like explaining it, so instead he let out an exasperated sigh. Maybe Cas was right, maybe he was asking too much. After all, if the roles were reversed, what would he do?
"Yeah."
"You stay on your own continent, would you?"
His vision blurred at the words. He wanted to yes, that he was fine, or at least would be, but he was too choked up to speak. Instead he just let out a shaky breath.
Just when he started debating calling his brother, he got a text that made his eyes nearly pop out of his head.
Sam couldn't help but remember the feeling of Lucifer's lips against his own. "Not physically if that's what you mean."
"Oh no, I do, it's just..." He grinned. "It's about a cat."
"Great, we know who he is, can we move on now?"
He let go of the breath he didn't he was holding. It was time to be honest. "I do," he admitted. But before Michael could say anything else, he added, "But I can't."
." And then he slapped Sam's ass and walked out of the trailer.
"Yeah," Dean repeated, and he even smiled a little at that too. "Yeah, that's for sure."
The younger boy smiled back. "Thanks for understanding." When Lucifer just gave him a brief nod, he added, "Maybe I should go home anyway. Now that Dean knows, he'll probably go into full protective brother mode." He didn't know why he said that. It was just that he was afraid he'd broken the mood and now he felt stupid for bringing it up. Maybe he should've just waited to see where Lucifer was head before drawing the line.

"That sucks, man," Dean commented and Charlie petted him on the shoulder sympathetically. "So then what third-years are coming?"
Sam sighed, "Lucifer... You know I'd love to tell them but..." He bit his bottom lip. There wasn't really a way to tell Lucifer his family wouldn't like him without hurting his feelings. Just thinking about it caused a knot in his stomach to tighten. "They're not exactly a fan of your family," he decided to say.
Castiel only gave a hum in agreement while he opened the front door and started towards the elevator.
"Is this about what Michael said?" Charlie added.
Dean had been on campus a few times but honestly he didn't understand how any student could find their way here. The place was a maze. He started off in the same direction Sam took every morning but after following some paths, taking a few turns and even crossing a street - what kind of school needed a street in it? - he still hadn't found a building that said 'Law School'.
"Are you sure?" Sam asked and his stomach clenched together with worry. He really didn't want to hurt Lucifer or make him in any way think Sam didn't care that much about him...
"Thanks for the ride," he grinned, walking away from the car backwards.
His heart seemed to stop when Lucifer laughed a little. "Seriously, what's gotten into you, Sammy?" Then he squinted his blue eyes. "You didn't talk to one of my siblings, did you?"
are underestimating how kind and loyal Charlie can be."
Dean huffed. "Well, obviously there's something interesting about it since you're spending your spare time studying it." He offered a broad smile and shoved Cas playfully. "Come on, I'm curious now."
Dean was getting really tired of giving vague answers to questions he didn't understand. Luckily his brother jumped in.
Eventually Dean found a free bench underneath a bunch of trees and turned off his music. He was barely seated when he looked around and spotted Cas.
"Oh come one, I'm sure you can think of something," Lucifer encouraged him.
Alright, so maybe Cas didn't feel like talking about it and Dean didn't want to push him. "Okay then. Anyways, I promised to call so... I just got back from Michael... Didn't really go well..."
Great. Straight to the point as usual.
"Look," Lucifer continued. "I just think that with the whole deal with him and Michael maybe we should just wait a little. You know, enjoy our time together for the fullest and all of that. And then..." He smirked. "... we can do your family thing."
He stopped, for something suddenly occurred to him. "Why did you walk up to me that first time?"
"Nice to meet you, Dean. You having fun?"
"Cool."
"Yeah, Balthazar invited me. Said I could bring along whoever I want."
"Glad you asked. As a matter of fact it has something to do with that new friend of yours. There are rumors his long lost brother is back in town."
"Thanks, you too," Sam politely replied, realizing just in time he didn't even remember the guy's name. Guess they'd have to find out about that later.
It was during the last break something finally gained his attention. He had been looking at his feet numbly, just staring off into nothing, when he'd suddenly heard a sound, very soft but surprisingly near. Then he'd looked up and there it was: a lollipop, lying at his feet. He quickly looked around the hallway in an attempt to find whoever dropped it but the only students present were too far off, engaged in their own conversations. Nobody even seemed to have noticed it happening.
For some reason that gesture alone calmed his nerves a bit.
Lucifer shrugged. "I only know you for less than a week and you're already the best thing that ever happened to me."
"Please stop talking," Sam nearly begged him, trying his best to blink away the tears in his eyes. He wasn't going to start crying over this, not here, not in front of Gabriel.
"He talks about me, huh?" Lucifer smirked.
"Because..." How the hell was he even going to explain this? "Because."
Dean spread his arms. "I live here, don't I? Shouldn't I have a key then?"
"What is it?" Kevin asked, looking at Sam worriedly. Sam didn't wonder why. He knew he had to look like crap after the day he'd gone through.
He clicked on a website called OneLove.Com (he was really surprised by the lack of creativity) and stared at the red letters beaming on the homepage.
"Son of a bitch," he swore under his breath, slapped the laptop shut and ran his hands through his hair desperately. This was not good. This was not good at all.
While Lucifer was fetching their drinks, Sam looked around the club in an attempt to keep himself occupied. The place was amazing but he had to admit that without Lucifer, he felt a little uncomfortable in the crowd. He was just thinking about how he actually didn't know anyone else in this place, when he noticed Crowley standing at the entrance.
John rolled his eyes. "There's no evidence for that whatsoever, Mick. Everyone knows it's just gossip. Anyhow," he pointed his attention back at Dean and Michael, "he's very nice so you don't have to worry about him. I think that's all there is to say, really. Well, except maybe that Gryffindors are said to get along best with Hufflepuffs and worst with Slytherins, but that's only if you believe the stereotypes of course."
His friend returned the gesture. They enjoyed the quietude for a couple of seconds and when Cas spoke again, he sounded different, less certain in a way. Almost... more human, as weird as that seemed.
"Oh, and as far as my family is concerned, this conversation never happened."
"Of course I will. With flying colors."
Then he hung up.
The rest of the group looked up in surprise and watched him go. Dean sighed, let go of Lisa and muttered a quick, "Be right back." before going after him.
Misha was still frowning worriedly, but he slowly nodded. "Okay."
"Oh, he's in there. With Lucifer," Crowley simply answered.
Castiel gave him a sad smile. "I'm sorry."
Sam smiled a little. Yeah, he knew Dean would never stop trying. "So what happened with you and Michael?" he changed the subject.
"What do you want for dinner?" Dean asked. "Don't really feel like cooking to be honest. We can order take-out. Or go to the Roadhouse, say hi. Wait," he interrupted himself. "Never mind, we
"Well, just don't let him get to you."
"Nothing, just... I don't know, tired I guess. Don't worry about it."
Sam shrugged. "Might as well have just gone for Cockles," he muttered.
He had to admit it was fun hanging around with the older boy. He truly couldn't understand why Lucifer's dad would have kicked him out. Sam did want to know though. He was just too polite to ask and he didn't want to invade Lucifer's privacy. If he wanted to tell Sam, he would.
And of course it didn't help their dad was joining them too, even though he'd already be leaving again after a few days. Gabriel guessed he was probably with some of the teachers in a separate compartment now. Maybe he'd even be discussing his children with them. That would certainly result in quite some surprises since his father basically knew nothing at all about their education. Well, except from Michael's of course. His older brother always made sure his dad was well aware of the grades he got. Gabriel just hoped his teachers would be too polite to tell Chuck about all the skeletons in his closet. Merlin knew he had
