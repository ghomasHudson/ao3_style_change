He was feeling a little better, still hot and cold but no longer lava and glacial, so Tony decided to stretch his legs. They hadn’t seen much use in the past week, having been forced into bed rest. Heavy and leaden, he took a few cautious steps, aiming for the kitchen, aiming for a coffee. Pouring himself a cup, he pondered the silence of his house. Eerily silent. Then a clatter of metal on stone. Tony swore using all the expletives he knew. They were in his workshop. Thundering down the stairs, puffing himself up to yell, to scream at them for getting near his toys. Although all the wind was gone from his sails as he approached the bottom step. They had tidied up, everything was neat, organised. No plates, mugs in sight. Nuts and Bolts, organised, categorised. Springs swept away. Wires tidied by length and material. Dummy was ‘helping’ by dropping a wrench on Clint’s foot, if the way he was hopping about was anything to go by. Stunned silence. He could not move a muscle. Why would they do that? He was being a burden again.
An arrow whizzed past his ear into someone attempting to garrotte Thor. Foolish move really, they could barely reach his neck.
Tony waved his hand towards the tray, a drifting aroma causing his stomach to rumble and groan. Steve shifted a little, trying to balance the water jug on his arm as he set the tray on Tony’s lap. He nodded.
The protests fell on deaf ears as suddenly Stark’s body was lurched upwards, two sturdy arms, real, physical arms around his shoulders supported him when his legs could not.
He turned sharply on his heel but before ascending the stairs he glanced back. Come on. His brain could do this. He gestured vaguely to the workshop.
“Clearly,” she arched an eyebrow, “but Tony, he said you were in the car. None were missing. What were you doing down there?”
“Tony, you should stop with the coffee and eat something,” Pepper glanced round, nose crinkled in disgust, “and clean up. You aren’t a child.”
None of the cars had been missing. Damn the glass walls, need to change that. Now he would have to answer all their questions. Insufferable questions.
Someone was aiming a gun at Captain America’s back. Darting forward Tony grabbed Steve’s shield and protected their back. The blast ricocheted, vaporising a nearby lamppost.
He was ignored. It was just Steve and Tony left in the little private hospital room. Natasha and Clint had been called by Coulson, Banner had wandered off. Thor was booming about something a few floors below. Pepper had also gone. Just Tony and Steve.
This stunned Tony into silence. Something cared. In his sleep deprived state had he altered the programming? No, no, learning AI. But who was he learning from?
He began ripping the IV painfully from his arm, pulling off the wires and pushing himself out of bed. Hands immediately began grappling at him, pushing him back down.
Damn the alcohol, or sleep deprivation, or whatever, why did he feel like crying? He could feel the tears hot behind his eyes, trying desperately to blink them away.
His brain seemed to have a virus, it was not acting the way he wanted. He meant to thank them. He meant to apologise for making them look after him. Why did they keep trying to help? Tony screamed at his brain, begging it to reboot, delete that data. He wanted to thank them, not yell. But they all stood there. The looks ranged from startled surprise that he was out of bed (Clint), to anger at being yelled at (Natasha), to stunned (Banner), to something he couldn’t place (Steve). Thor hadn’t even glanced up. He was too busy examining Dummy, prodding at the joints. Steve took a step forwards, hands outstretched as though trying to calm a wild animal.
“Of course sir. You have been shaking since you put on the suit, your temperature is 39.2 c, and you have sneezed seventeen times since stepping outside, all of which suggest that you are ill with-“
Tony shook his head, he shouldn’t rely on people. The years had taught him that. Self-reliant. Independent. He had been since childhood. Natasha nodded.
“What were you thinking! You are still ill, you complete and utter ass, you entirely senseless man.”
He landed with a thud, damaging the pavement beneath him. Already he could feel gunfire ricocheting off of his armour. Repulsors poised and ready to fire, he took a cursory glance to acquire his target. Locked, prepped, and fired. Target subdued. The constant fire of bullets knocked Stark off his feet, losing balance and stumbling forward. He turned and aimed a solid punch to the nearest baddy. The guy doubled over, and was sent flying into a coffee stand, scattering coffee beans to the ground. Without looking, Tony aimed a Repulsor at the guy who was about to attack Captain America.
Age five. He could just about remember it. The horrible feeling of bile rising in his throat. The empty ache of his stomach. The burning acidic after-taste. His mom had hugged him once when he was ill with a stomach bug. That was a long time ago. His father had reprimanded her for mollycoddling him. That at least he was being quiet. That he’d be fine in a couple of days, leave him alone to get over it. That otherwise other people, more important people, would get ill. Age eleven, just after he had been shipped off to boarding school. Headaches, not just his regular dull-throbbing-without-coffee headaches that he experienced now, but full-blown migraines. Light hurt his eyes, noises pounded on his brain, muscles ached from the simplest of movements. The school nurse was long gone, some vacation day or holiday. Tony hadn’t cared. The replacement found his attitude insufferable (justifiably, even Tony had to admit) and let him be. He had been too stubborn to admit how bad he really felt, he didn’t want to make her sick. So she tossed him paracetamol, told him to stop being a pain in her ass and a burden and stated to him that he should just sleep it off. Pointless really, even back then insomnia plagued him. But age twenty-one had been the worst. He had caught stomach flu abroad. He felt like he had vomited up everything he had ever eaten in his life, the taste of iron blood left in his mouth. No water would remove the dryness from his mouth (nor would any alcoholic cocktail, but at least it dulled the pain). He had lost so much weight. He kept his illness hidden from any tabloids, but they noticed his sudden skeletal appearance. Luckily they put it down to the stress of taking over Stark Industries. Don’t be a burden, mustn’t be a burden. Rely on no one.
“Sir, your temperature is dangerously high. If you do not consult a medical professional I will be forced to tell the others of your condition.”
“Oh thanks,” he replied sarcastically, “always good to hear. It’s just the coffee. Need more coffee.”
His brain had shut down. The virus was taking over. It would not restart. Tech support, tech support, he needed tech support. Pulling open a draw in his side table, digging under old patent papers and leftover parts, cogs, wires, the usual junk, he found it. A bottle of scotch. He undid the top with his teeth, drinking copious amounts. His mind was blank, peaceful. He felt so free. Floaty. Soon half the bottle was gone. He giggled with childlike innocence and glee. When was the last time he laughed? He felt so blissful and numb. He wanted to fly. Off and away. He could fly. He had found a way.
Shrugging off the shoulder Tony flew off aiming for home, leaving the others behind, tiny ants on the pavement.
With a roll of her eyes and a reproachful look, Pepper carried up the plate and the scattered array of mugs. Tony watched as she left and sighed. He really should clean more. At least it stops Pepper getting annoyed at him. The world still felt far too warm. Maybe a quick flight would cool him down.
Anyway, I really hope you enjoyed this. I had a lot of fun writing this and I hope my writing didn't suck too bad this time.
He crossed the room in long strides and peered into the bag. The toy was put back into its packaging, and the remote control was actually returned.
“Yeah, no thanks. But Tony’s so irritating! I’d be in an elevator with him and he’d just smile. He probably thinks this is a fucking riot.”
“Huh.” Instead of asking inquiring more, Tony headed towards the coffee machine to prepare for another ten hours of inventing. JARVIS was relieved.
Instead of the small smile Steve expected, Tony turned his whole body over to face away from him. But Steve didn’t mind much. Tony was safe now. Steve stayed as Tony’s breathing became slower and refused to move the rest of the night despite the nurses’ objections.
Tony was trapped, desperate to come but held against an immovable force. He struggled, trying to push himself back onto Steve’s cock, but it was no use. Steve simply hummed, nuzzling into the side of Tony’s neck, scattering kisses into his skin. Tony stopped trying to move, realizing he was truly at Steve’s mercy, dropping his warm head onto the coolness of the counter.
When Clint pulled away, he smacked his ass, making the plug scrape against his tender insides. Tony whimpered, but Clint ignored him in favor of pulling Steve in for a dirty kiss.
Without any warning, Steve gripped the back of his head and pushed him fully onto his dick. Tony spluttered but Steve gave no mind, only moving Tony’s head easily over his cock as if his mouth was a fleshlight.
What annoyed him the most was that the punishment Natasha planned for him wasn’t even that bad. Hell, once he got over feeling humiliated and exposed, he even enjoyed it. He wasn’t used to having the entire team’s perverted attention on him; despite his playboy reputation he never even joined them on one of their sessions.
Steve was waiting for him on the communal floor. He knew Tony had a tendency to be late to every social function, despite Tony assuring him he’d be on time. Still he glanced up at the ceiling and asked, “JARVIS, where’s Tony?”
When he couldn’t get himself immersed in reading again, he set the book aside and leaned back into the sofa. He watched as a mother bear tried to find food for her cubs.
“I don’t know, Tony, but if I’m going to have you, I’d want the full course.” Steve moved closer, inclining his head towards Tony, with a mischievous look in his eyes. “If we start, I won’t be able to stop myself from having you.”
“Sir, he did live in a neighborhood with a substantial homosexual population and active night life scene back in the 1940s.”
Hulk glanced at the stairwell and his frown deepened. “Metal Man might have trouble.” He ran to the stairwell and jumped straight down, disappearing. A loud thud followed.
Tony smirked. He leaned back in his chair, laced his fingers together, and made an obvious show of looking over Steve. His eyes swept over Steve’s body, lingering at his well-defined muscles.
He locked everything up in his workshop and moved into the elevator, trying to appease his nerves. Casual.
He could hear the almost inaudible swoosh of the door and froze. Shit, he forgot to tell JARVIS to make sure he was undisturbed.
Tony laughed nervously. “You might feel differently in a few minutes. So, the thing is… Remember when I said I needed music to help me concentrate? Well, I was kinda… lying…”
“Shush.” But Steve couldn’t help but grin, adding another finger. It was a tight fit, the muscles surrounding his digits were relaxing incrementally. He pushed them deeper and found what he was looking for, touching Tony’s prostate.
Right. Deep breaths, like how Natasha showed him. Start slowly. Stay relaxed. He spread his legs and coated one finger in lube, spreading it around his hole.
Sam shook his head but didn’t comment further. Bucky continued to needle him until their supervisor came by to tell them to stop goofing around.
“Short for operating system. It helps manages all of a software’s functions, very important. Anyway it’s for a prototype smartphone; I’m trying to give Apple a run for its money. Their vision of technology is rudimentary at best.” Tony tried for a cocky smirk but it fell slightly flat.
Tony’s flush deepened and he dropped his gaze. He should’ve known Natasha would take the chance to gloat. The whole butt plug thing was her idea after all and no doubt she wanted to see the true goal finally realized.
The fingers disappeared and Tony could feel Clint right at his entrance, breaching him slowly. Tony moaned.
This was not amusing to him at all. But by the fiftieth time he complained to Bucky about it at work, he could see his best friend was trying hard not to burst out laughing at him.
If Tony had all of his faculties, he would have squawked at Steve pulling him into a bridal carry. Instead he just sighed and snuggled into Steve’s chest. Steve beamed at him and followed Natasha to his room.
They would have been done with these HYDRA thugs by now but more kept appearing from the elevators and stairwell, and several tanks had suddenly appeared right outside the blown-open entrance. And now Hulk was getting anxious from Iron Man being out of his sight for too long.
The giggling that started very quickly turned into wheezing and Tony clapped Steve awkwardly on the shoulder. “‘Not that hot,’” Tony repeated.
Tony would be a liar if he said he’d never fantasize about this. Long before Steve ever showed up, Tony got himself off to thoughts of sucking Captain America’s cock. But in those fantasies, he always thought of the Captain as polite and respectful, not brutish and demanding like the real one was. Steve looked like he was ready to pry Tony’s jaw open and force himself inside.
Tony jerked up with a yelp, but he couldn’t move, as Steve held him firmly down. He moaned at the pounding against his prostate and the restriction of his movement. No matter what he did, Tony couldn’t escape Steve’s secure grip, and it seemed that Steve wouldn’t let him go until he was finished.
“Mr. Kennedy? Our landlord?” Steve couldn’t help but sound incredulous. This guy didn’t even know their landlord was?
Okay, that was fine. Sure, Steve was disappointed. But this was his chance, the chance he was waiting for. It did take more than two weeks, but shit happens. All right, now then.
Steve ran down the stairwell, taking two or three steps at a time. He reached the last floor to see Tony out of his suit and messing with the computers while Hulk checked the perimeter.
Tony stretched and reached up to feel the back of his neck and shoulder. It felt tender, but the ache felt delicious instead of painful.
It wasn’t until Steve managed three fingers in him that he was satisfied; he kept jerking Tony throughout it and avoided brushing against his prostate. He glanced at Tony and grinned when he saw his expression. “You’re evil,” Tony grumbled, straining against Steve’s hands.
“Yes.” Tony reached for him and led him back into another kiss, this one sweet, letting Steve know that there would be more for them after this. Their urgency turned it dirty and Steve was sucking Tony’s bottom lip between his teeth, worrying at it until it became red and glossy.
“You’d never think Illinois would be the base of such a nefarious plot,” quipped Clint as the quinjet ascended over New York.
“I need your cock,” Tony said thickly, gasping when Steve scissored two fingers inside of him. Steve paused, moaning quietly at the thought, and Tony rocked against the fingers, trying to get them deeper.
Once those three have left, Bruce muttered something about ‘soft tissue injuries’ and disappeared, leaving Tony and Steve alone in the room. This wasn’t what Steve was hoping for when he was thinking of getting Tony alone after the mission.
This was better than last time, he decided. It probably had something to do with not being worried over his team’s reactions. Having the focus of five different people, having them possibly judging him, was a bit nerve-wracking. Tony had a well-documented history of letting people down, and he knew he would just get in their way if he’d ever join their team bonding time.
“Dummy, what the hell! I swear one of these days I’m going to send you off to be recycled, you useless sack of bolts.”
Steve sighed and took his usual seat on the couch, taking out his sketchbook and charcoal. Tony didn’t acknowledge him for the rest of the day.
It didn’t take long then. Tony threw his head back, arched his hips up, and came, his release spurting over his stomach. His muscles clamped down around Steve and a few short and quick thrusts later, Steve reached his own completion.
Tony wiggled, feeling the plug jostle inside. He knew he was going to be sore as hell when he woke up later, but he couldn’t help but look forward to it. “I want to keep it.”
Steve wrapped one hand around Tony’s length and rubbed, pumping his hips faster. It didn’t take long; Tony had been on teetering on the edge. Tony moaned and stiffened, his come splattering over Steve’s fist. Tony clenched around Steve, and Steve went right over the edge after him.
But this was Steve. Steve, who thought Tony didn’t like him anymore and was still somehow willing to be ignored as long as it made Tony happy. And Tony felt like such an asshole, Christ, but he was going to fix it. With a totally-not-date.
The minute Tony heard Bruce’s footsteps on the stairs, he shoved his sweats down his thighs, exposing his heated cock to the cool air. Gasping, he barely wrapped a hand around himself before he was coming. He stared at the semen that hit the ground, surprised he climaxed so hard and so suddenly. The thrill he had from nearly being caught by an employee was nothing compared to the excitement of Bruce nearly seeing him.
The brunet didn’t waste time on fancy tricks or a slow build to orgasm – not right now.  His mouth worked feverishly – first taking Steve to the hilt, then pulling back to lave at the underside with his tongue.  His hands came up, fondling Steve’s balls, grasping the rest of his cock whenever Tony didn’t have the whole length in his mouth – always moving, always touching.
Steve struggled out of his own clothes, clumsy in his eagerness.  (And if that clumsiness was both adorable and made Tony preen to know he was the cause of it?  He’d never tell.)  “If we got hotter with toys and games, we’d combust.”  Naked now, he flung the last of his clothes carelessly to the side and knelt on the bed, pinning Tony beneath him.  “You ever miss it?”
Steve rubbed his thumb in circles on Tony’s waist, turning to kiss his cheek softly.  “We were kind of blind to it ourselves until pretty recently.  I know when I started to have feelings – well.”  He shook his head.  “I didn’t think they’d ever be returned.  I’m… really happy to have been wrong about that.”
Bracing himself on his toes, Steve pushed back against Tony, groaning.  “You can – ” he gasped “ – go harder.  Please.”
Steve turned to him, smiling.  “Right back atcha, love.”  He tossed his tie aside, followed with his jacket and shirt.  Belt and pants followed, until he stood in his undershirt and boxers.  “You’re overdressed for this party.”
They waited a minute or two before the call connected.  “Martini,” Rhodey said immediately, “tell me this isn’t another Bain or Stone.  I don’t want to have to kill Captain America.”
“I’ll let you two talk.”  Steve rose, ignoring the scathing look Pepper gave him.  “I’ll just be down the hall in the studio, doll… have JARVIS buzz me if you need me, alright?”  He ignored Pepper right back, brushing his fingers over Tony’s cheek.
Media coverage of their date – their very lovely, extremely romantic date – was bad enough.  Tony had dealt with the press his whole life – he could compartmentalize that worry and set it aside for later.
“Are you okay?”  Rhodey leaned into the screen, raking Tony over with his eyes.  “You look – damn it, are you crying?  Do I need to – I can be there in like eight hours, kid – ”
He couldn’t really grin with his mouth full, but he did shoot an amused look up the plane of Tony’s body.  When their eyes met, Steve made a point of swallowing around Tony’s cock.  It earned him another expletive, and Steve felt Tony’s hips jerk involuntarily.  That caused his fingers to hit Tony’s prostate again, which set up a delightful cycle.  Steve played him like a virtuoso – fingers twitching just so, tongue lapping at the vein along the bottom of his cock before taking him all down again until he couldn’t breathe.
“We’ll get to the other stuff eventually,” Tony whispered, curling over him to kiss the small of his back above the towel.  “But for now, just let me work on you, yeah?”  At Steve’s inarticulate groan of agreement, Tony had to smile.
“I like taking care of you.”  He bent to kiss Tony one more time before walking into the bathroom.  He cleaned himself off and returned to do the same to his lover, his touch gentle.  “You ready for sleep, or you want to turn on a movie?”
“You want everything,” Steve whispered, pressing into his lover.  He moved slowly, but didn’t stop until he was fully sheathed inside Tony.  “And I want to give it to you, my love – everything I have and everything I am.”  He caught Tony’s lips in a kiss, deep and panting and desperate.
“You deserve it,” Tony purred, dropping a third slap.  “Is that what you want to hear, Steve?  That you’ve been very bad, and need to be punished?”  At Steve’s frantic nod, Tony laughed.  “God, you’re such a boy scout.”  He gripped Steve’s hip, grinding deeper into him.  “You broke the rule, Steve,” he murmured, stroking his fingers over where he’d slapped.  “You knew there’d be consequences.”
Tony tightened his fingers just this shade of painful, thrust to the hilt and ground into Steve.  That was all it took – for both of them.  Steve spilled into Tony’s hand and all over the bed, gasping and panting.  Tony came inside Steve, thrusting twice more before he was too sensitive to continue.  He didn’t pull away immediately, resting almost on top of Steve and breathing against the back of his neck.
He came back to awareness some moments later, breath still wheezing, feeling Tony stroking his back.  “With me again?” Tony whispered.
“Whatever you say, Spangles.”  Tony winked at him, and Steve had to resist chasing after him to follow up on that expression.
“You’re such a fucking romantic,” Tony gasped when their lips parted.  “God, I love you.”  He rolled his hips again, this time feeling the full length of Steve inside him.  “Make love to me, Steve.”
Tony sat up a little on the bed to allow Steve to pull his shirt up over his head, then wriggled himself out of his jeans and boxers.  He gestured imperiously at Steve’s button-up and khakis.  “Come on, old man.  You’re falling behind.”
“I didn’t know you worried about that.”  Steve sat back on his heels, not wanting to crowd Tony, but… his resolve didn’t last long, and he scooted closer to wrap his arms around his lover, one hand cradling the arc reactor.  “Is it stupid that I feel better knowing that you worry too?”
“So much,” Steve promised, lifting him up off the stool.  Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist.  “Someday, I’m going to drop down on one knee like the romantic sap you accuse me of being, and I’m going to offer you a ring and beg you to marry me.”  He carried his partner through to the bedroom, laying him down on the bed and kissing him thoroughly.  “Someday, I’m going to stand next to you in front of all our friends and pledge to be yours forever.”  Steve sat up enough to strip his shirt off, though he didn’t pull away far enough to undress completely.  “Someday, I’m going to ask you to give me your name, and to take mine, so that anyone who ever says them knows we belong together.”  He buried his face in Tony’s neck, kissing and nibbling.
“There you are,” Tony murmured, his kisses shifting from Steve’s neck to his ear as he relaxed, and finally to his lips when Steve turned his head.   More than the caresses, the kisses spurred Steve into full hardness.  Two decades of playboy lifestyle meant that Tony was one hell of a kisser – well, he was sinfully good at most everything in bed, but Steve was particularly fond of the kissing.
“You love me anyway.”  Steve kissed him – hard.  “Go back to the table, beautiful.  I’ll be along in a minute.”
Steve’s lips curved against his.  “I promise too, doll.  And I agree, it’s extremely unlikely that you’ll leave me unsatisfied.”  He slid a hand down Tony’s body.
“No…” Tony said hesitantly.  “Just us.”  He paused.  “Just me.  I mean.  You’re… um.  She didn’t order you to go.  I… was assuming… hoping you’d… go as my partner?”
“My pleasure.”  Steve bent down to lick and nibble at one of Tony’s nipples as he let his fingers gently begin working him open.  “Besides, you like my ass, smart and all.”
“I vote for Thai and a cheesy action flick,” Clint groaned as they climbed back into the QuinJet for the short hop from SHIELD HQ back to the Tower.
“I know, sweetheart.”  Steve nipped at his lower lip, then tenderly kissed the tears away from Tony’s eyes.
Eventually, Steve pulled away.  “Shower,” he decided, getting to his feet and looking for their clothes.
Carefully, Steve slid one finger into Tony’s hole, moaning at how easily he took it.  “Jesus, I love it when you’re slutty.”  He added a second finger, swallowing hard.  His cock had softened some after his orgasm, but was now harder than it had been in Tony’s throat.
"What if I want to count these strokes first?" Steve teased, easing a third finger into Tony.  "I counted at least a dozen infractions... what do you think, three strokes each?"  He pulled his fingers almost free before thrusting them in to the hilt.  "One."
Steve sighed, tightening his arms around Tony.  “That’s two conditions, doll.”  But he could live with them.  “Deal.”
Steve reached across and took Tony’s hand.  “Relax, sweetheart,” he murmured.  “This is just two people who love each other very much having Italian food.”
Steve’s hips stuttered.  “I’m so close,” he murmured.  “You gonna come with me?  Can you?”  Tony nodded, panting.  “Come on then,” Steve urged, his hand speeding up on Tony’s cock just as his hips did.
It was delightful and terrifying.  But Tony was committed to not fucking this relationship up like he had so many others so… he agreed.
“Alright.”  Steve kissed his neck, nibbling lightly.  “How about we get cleaned up, put some pajamas on, and you can show me some more of that Captain Picard show?”
“Whoa.”  Tony’s eyes were wide, startled – but he didn’t pull away.  “Yeah, okay.  I changed my mind.  We are definitely having a discussion… just not here.”  He looked around the communal kitchen.  “Your quarters or mine?”
“Yeah.  Right.”  Tony tried to believe that – but he’d seen the paparazzi outside.  Hell, the patrons in the restaurant had cell phones.  This would be all over the internet before they even got to dessert.  He cleared his throat.  “I mean.  Yes… you know I do… um.”
“Did I hurt you?” Steve asked in a low voice.  He’d dropped his head to Tony’s shoulder when he came, and didn’t lift it now.  Wasn’t sure he could make eye contact at the moment.
Steve leaned into Tony shoulder, turning to press a kiss to his cheek.  “You wanna explain that, doll?”
“I’m pretty much a sure thing, baby – although we’ll have coffee, not a drink.”   Tony finished tying Steve’s tie, giving it a pat.  “Time with you is too precious not to spend it sober.”
Steve didn’t notice him come in, lost in his own mind and movement.  His punches were perfectly calculated and precision placed with a rapidity that put many robots to shame.  (Particularly DUM-E, though Steve was inordinately fond of Tony’s bots.)
He shook his head.  “Just Steve, ma’am.  I’m not the Captain at home.”  He gave her a crooked smile.  “And for the record… home is where Tony is.”
Tony flipped up the faceplate of his suit.  He hadn't even gotten banged up in this fight, no new bruises to speak of.  That was remarkable in itself.  "Whatcha think, Cap?  Maybe we should give that robot a closer look?"  He ignored his teammates rolling their eyes -- he knew it wasn't subtle.  Knew they knew he knew.  It didn't matter.  (And if there was going to be some other pairing-and-more-ing-off in the Tower while he was occupied with Steve, whatever.  No skin off his nose.)
Steve shuddered.  “Yeah, okay.  That’s – that sounds good.”  He nudged Tony onto his back, a hand sliding down between the brunet’s legs.  He was completely shocked to discovered Tony was already slick and partially worked open.  “What—”
“I’m… you really scared me, Tony.”  He said it softly, almost too quietly to hear.  “And I wanted to be mad instead, because that was an easier thing to be than scared.”
“Trust me, you keep your foot moving like that, and I’ll be wide awake.”  Tony rocked his hips very softly against Steve’s sock-clad foot.  “I didn’t know you were an exhibitionist.”
“Cute,” Rhodey drawled.  Tony startled – he’d forgotten the line was still active.  “I’m not done with you, Captain.”
“I suppose not.”  Steve tried to find the lightness for banter and failed.  Tried to find the place where he was okay with a quick roll in the hay and couldn’t find it either.
“Maybe.”  Tony plucked at the fabric of Steve’s pajamas.  “She was pretty upset.”  And she’d upset him as well – but Tony didn’t see any reason to tell Rhodey that.
“I know you do um,” Steve agreed, smiling.  Beneath the table he slipped his foot out of the very expensive leather shoe that Tony had picked out and pressed it against Tony’s calf.
More emotion in Steve’s eyes.  Tony ignored it again.  “I’m good.  I’m not shy, Tony.  If I don’t like it, I’ll let you know.”  He returned the kiss, making it slow and deep, before rolling lithely onto his knees, leaning forward on his forearms, and looking back over his shoulder.  “What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation?”
“Wrong on both accounts.”  Steve slid his arm around Tony.  “I blurted it out in the middle of an argument – ”
They panted together for several minutes before Tony started to chuckle.  “I have never needed as many showers before,” he managed to say between laughter.
Reaching out to stroke Tony’s chest, Steve raised an eyebrow.  “Yeah?”  It didn’t surprise him that Tony needed rules – or bother him.  “And what were the old ones, doll?”
Shifting, Steve spread his legs farther and canted his hips forward to make it easier for Tony to finger him.  His head tilted back against the tile and he sighed.  “Your hands – you know, they were the first thing I fantasized about.”
“It’s always better when there’s love,” Steve said fondly, kissing him again.  He wanted to ask if Tony had really never had emotionally connected sex – but it seemed like the wrong time for that particular conversation.  “Thank you for letting me love you, Tony.”
Tony wrapped his hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him close.  Steve let most of his weight rest on Tony, pinning him to the mat as they caught their breath. He found his forehead pressed against Tony’s, their eyes closed now but their breath coiling together between them.
“There’s rough, and there’s mean.”  Tony stretched up to kiss Steve.  “You’re too precious to me to be mean, love.  Not when you’re promising to someday make an honest man out of me.”
“Always.”  Steve gripped Tony’s hips to still them.  “Would rather we move to the bedroom, love.  I don’t really fancy bein’ walked in on.”
As parting lines went, it wasn’t awful.  Not as powerful as it could have been, but Steve didn’t dare try to think of something better… he was already vibrating with the need to get away from Fury and get home.
Obligingly, Tony picked up the pace.  He’d been trying to stay gentle – but he couldn’t, in the face of Steve’s hunger.  “You’re so good for me, baby,” Tony whispered in his ear.  “You take it so well.”  Steve arched beneath him, a desperate moan bursting out of him.  “That’s right, sugar – just let go, I’ve got you.”
Tony laughed as he bent to clean Steve’s stomach with his tongue.  “Coffee doesn’t usually wind you up like this.”
“Yes I am,” Tony agreed, tilting his head back to give Steve better access.  He feathered his hand through the silky blond hair.
“I don’t care about the pan,” Tony waved that away.  “I care about – the look on your face.”  He self-edited at the last minute.  “What’s wrong?”
Pepper Potts strode out of the elevator, dressed immaculately in a white designer suit.  Her heels clicked on the hardwood floor, demanding answers before she’d even spoken.  “Since when does JARVIS hold me in the elevator, Tony?”
“Oh, I know.”  Steve grinned, nipping at Tony’s neck.  The touch of teeth made Tony shiver.  “Want everyone else to know, babydoll.  Want to tell the damned world that you’re mine and I’m yours.”  Steve slid his hands up and down Tony’s body – touching everywhere, but not lingering.  “You want that, love?”
“Are we good then, baby?” Tony asked, his eyes searching Steve’s.  “Are we – are we agreed it’s the real thing, and…”
Tony chuckled, sitting up enough to pull off his own shirt, squirming to unfasten his pants.  “I used to think this level of arousal only came with toys and games.  Imagine my surprise to discover I just needed the right partner.”  He shoved pants and boxers off, catching his socks on the way because really, who left socks on for sex?
“There are thirteen voice messages and twenty-nine text messages from Miss Potts, and a similar number from Colonel Rhodes.”
Tony shook his head, leaning down to kiss Steve slowly.  “Can’t hit you either.”  His lips twitched against Steve’s.  “Besides, that would be defacing a national monument.”
Tony stood up, smoothing his hands over Steve’s ass.  “You’re alright, baby.”  Steve was shivering beneath his hands.  “Can you drop down on your belly for me, sweetheart?  You’re too tall up here.”  Steve obliged, shimmy backwards until he was standing next to the bed, laying forward over the mattress.  Tony used the time to add more lube to his cock.  He didn’t make Steve wait any longer – as soon as he was still, Tony pressed into him slowly.
“I promised you I’d take you hard up against the wall,” Steve reminded him, viciously yanking on fasteners.  “And right now, it’s either continue to scream at you or fuck you – and I’m choosing door number two.  You got a problem with that, Stark?”
“ – didn’t mean to make it awkward.  I wish I could just give you what you need but I can’t pretend that I’m not in love with you anymore, Tony, I just – I just can’t.  I’m sorry.”
Tony grimaced.  “Yeah.  Christ, that was a mess.  Took me days to get it all out of the nooks and crannies of the suit, even with your help.”
This thing between them, that was only for the battlefield… it kind of started to bleed into other portions of their lives.
Tony was silent, shivering in Steve’s arms.  “Defining the relationship has always been the beginning of the end for me.  And I – it’ll damned near kill me if you wind up in the same category as the others… an ex.”
“People don’t… don’t stay with me, Steve.  They take what they need, and then they go.”  Tony clung to Steve, not daring to look at him.  “It took longer with Pepper, sure – but with Ty and Sunset… fuck, they were absolute nightmares.  It’s all I’ve ever known, baby… and it would damn near kill me if you were one of them.”
Ah, hell, that wasn’t helping his whole not-embarrassing-himself plan.  Tony’s hips stuttered briefly at the idea of Steve serving a whole lot of men wearing vaguely military uniforms – he liked uniforms, okay? – but Tony pushed it aside and focused on swift, hard strokes.  “Were you as good for them as you are for me?”
It took Steve a moment to realize it wasn’t the physical sensations that were overwhelming Tony, and his heart flip-flopped in his chest.  “I love you,” he whispered into Tony’s ear as he started to thrust.  “I’ve wanted to be able to tell you for ages, and having you here in my arms like this is just fantastic.”  Steve met his lips for a long kiss even as he continued his slow, rhythmic pace inside Tony.  “To look down at this incredible, beautiful man and know he loves me too is just – it’s everything, doll.”
“I am, I promise,” Tony groaned, pushing back against Steve’s hand.  “Scout’s honor, pinky promise, solemn vow, cross my heart.”
Tony turned his head to catch Steve’s lips with his own.  “I love you too.”  For a moment he ignored the insistent demands of his libido and focused only on the overwhelming love he felt for his partner – for Steve.  “God, do I love you.”
“Kinda fond of that myself.”  Steve laid Tony on his back on the broad mattress, hands gentle.  “I’d like to have you first… if that’s okay?”
It wasn’t that Tony didn’t want to be open with Steve… but he kept seeing tabloid headlines and splashy listicles in his head.  Tony didn’t care what they said about him, but worrying about Steve’s reputation kept him from reaching out, most days.
He walked over and Steve felt just a tad guilty at how hastily he handed his baby over, but he knew Juliana was in good hands. Happy had taken care of Tony for years, especially during his… er, tumultuous bachelorhood, and even Steve could admit that his husband was occasionally more demanding than even a newborn.
The day after Pepper and Happy babysat Juliana, Pepper found them in Steve’s studio. Steve was busy with a charcoal drawing of Julia that he wanted to give to Gail, while Tony was reclined on the couch with Julia on his chest. He was on his phone and was near dozing. Steve hoped he would fall asleep. Tony’s sleeping habits had been bad enough before the baby came and Julia’s erratic schedule and colic weren’t helping curb the genius’s belief that sleep was something he could out-stubborn, so Steve wanted them both to get as much sleep as they could.
Immediately, all three bots wheeled back, claws clicking and beeping in low volume. Butterfingers had dropped the edge of the blanket in his claws and kept waving his arm.
“It’s not that, though I look good in purple so hush your mouth, Metal Man,” Clint said, flapping at hand at Tony’s face, who pushed it away. “I tend to notice what people are wearing and what they’re
Bruce reached over for a few colorful pieces and waved them over Juliana’s head. She looked at them transfixed. At least Bruce stopped trying to give her away.
“She found it delicious! Another!” Thor boomed, a controlled one though, in consideration for infant ears.
[Image 1: A selfie taken by Tony with Julia and Steve on the limo on their way to the hotel. Steve is kissing Julia’s cheek and Tony is beaming at the camera.]
“First app you check when you wake up in the morning?” Bruce asked, their designated questioner for the game. He made a face. “For those of us who are not as attached to their phones as Tony and Clint, maybe we can also call it: first thing you ask JARVIS in the morning?”
Steve rubbed his fingers against the window before him, resisting the urge to hunker down on the window seat with his thick, warm blanket. He reminded himself that he was inside, in the tower, warm and well-fed, and that his lungs were in no danger of suddenly seizing up.
Steve secretly thought Rhodey was enjoying it, for a myriad of reasons. For one thing, Rhodey had both Tony and Julia mostly to himself. Steve knew how much the Colonel missed his best friend and vice versa and they’d never been shy about expressing their affection for one another. But now that Tony was a father and that Rhodey was named godfather, he wanted time to get to know the baby too. Second, Rhodey liked needling and annoying Tony. Case in point: according to the billionaire’s rants, the photos looked terrible because Rhodey was not ‘catching the light’ or something and kept getting his arm in the way.
“My friend, it is very obvious,” Thor said, chuckling greatly and standing up to bring his plate to the sink.
Tony strung the cute green bottle around Steve’s neck and then gently pressed the end against his daughter’s waiting mouth. She took it and slowly settled, letting Steve show her off again to their enraptured audience, blinking slowly.
“But she’ll have pictures of it, and of us celebrating with her.” Steve shrugged. “Part of it is a change in scenery really. She’s still growing but she soaks things up like a sponge and we want her to be exposed to these things. We rarely have reason to take her out as it is, what with paparazzi always around.” He smiled when Clint tossed Bruce the Heihei toy which made Julia more determined to get to him. “She’ll have a lot of years to spend here at the tower, but we’re not really sure if next year we’ll have time to take her out and who knows if maybe she won’t even like it and we’ll make up a different tradition.”
“Her tears are very unsettling,” Thor added in agreement. “I find most children’s tears to be the case, but hers are most troubling to hear.”
When one was married to a billionaire, things like laundry and folding clothes were taken care of by a staff – and no, Phil wasn’t their housekeeper, or JARVIS, or Pepper, though all three of them vetoed the tower’s
“It was a surprise! And, I mean, it seemed like such a waste to put just one photo in that tube, not to mention it was a waste of poster paper and ink!”
“Our comrades have returned safe and hale.” Thor clapped his large hands. He lifted Julia out of the playpen and let her crawl to them.
Tony nodded, happy to have gotten his way, as always. “Pep and Happy are coming too, which is awesome. Rhodey won’t be available, because the Air Force can be such horse puckies. We got Steve’s VA boyfriend and Jane, Darcy and Erik will be picked up from the airpo– oops.”
“Hey! / Natasha’s smaller!” Clint and Tony glared at Bucky, but the former immediately turned to the latter, hissing, “Tony, the hell?”
Steve chuckled a little wetly and a lot overwhelmed. He could see a peek of dark hair on the little head resting against Gail’s chest and he was so excited. But he and Tony had talked about this and Tony already had his phone in hand. He put away the bouquet on a nearby vase. He had to resist reaching for the bundle in Gail’s arms, because once he did, he wasn’t letting go.
Steve slid his plate of bacon closer. Tony was quick to be snippy when tired. He then answered, “I usually ask about the weather. Tony checks the stock market.”
And they looked cute together, with their matching curly brown hair, which always made Steve reach for his phone or his sketchbook.
Steve managed to put away the last of the shirts. He slid the drawer closed and turned to Tony. “So, if we want to know what Pepper is going to do to our baby, I’ve got to be the one to ask her.”
Steve groaned. “Tony don’t say that in front of the baby, and don’t call it banging. We’re married.”
Tony laid her down on the bed to let Steve put her onesie on. He grabbed his phone and hit speed dial.
“Aside from the fact that I had already seen her through the hundreds of photos and videos on Sir’s phone, I can see her perfectly well. Thank you, Captain,” JARVIS answered primly, but Tony could almost hear the appreciation in his English voice.
“I want to!” Peter said, far too enthusiastically. “If– if you’re free, I mean? And if you think you can handle a room full of crazies, superheroes, spies, scientists–”
“Julia is going to grow up with superheroes for aunts, uncles and godparents,” he said. “She’s going to know me and Tony as her fathers, but also Captain America and Iron Man. Same goes with the Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Agent Agent,” Phil smiled wrly at that, “And even the entirety of Asgard. We’re going to have to figure out how we’re going to introduce her to the Other Guy though, but you and him, you’re both going to be part of her life growing up.”
“Me too,” Rhodey said and he definitely looked a bit more relaxed compared to when he arrived. He turned to the couch. “Come here, you. Stop pouting. You look so pathetic.”
Clint had only one hearing aid on, wincing at every scream, and he looked like he wanted to cry himself. Bucky was gritting his teeth and stabbing his fork so hard he was liable to break the plate, maybe even the countertop. Natasha kept drumming her fingers on the table. Phil had more control and looked unbothered, but Steve had noticed he had been on the same page on his paperwork for near twenty minutes now.
“But your kid and my kid are one and the same.” That made a smile appear on Steve’s face. That was a good thought, a good thing, the best thing, to have a child with the love of his life.
The sound of repulsors had never sounded sweeter, nor did the sound of metal whizzing through the air when shield and electricity collided, saving Peter.
Bucky held her in his arms on instinct, swiftly switching her to his flesh and blood arm instead of the cool metal one. Steve could remember how stiff and scared Bucky was the first time Steve made him carry her, protesting that his metal arm was cold and could hurt her or pinch her. Now it was like second nature.
“I get that from your and Steve's old man sensibilities,” Tony rolled his eyes and pointed at Clint. “But I can’t believe you have the nerve to look at people’s clothes when you’re decked out in purple.”
Tony had a really, really sweet tooth. It was one of Pepper and Rhodey’s tried-and-true methods to get Tony to sit still or for suitors to butter him up and win his favor. Steve had been steering it into healthier stuff the past months, especially as it was bad enough that the other occupants of the Tower were awful enablers (see: Clint, Thor, Bucky, Darcy, and surprisingly Phil).
“Your third month picture with Julia for her baby book,” Steve said. “We know you’re not much for posing, so we took a few candids and chose the best one.”
And honestly, he liked the energy this event had compared to all those stiff galas and dinners he and Tony had to attend for Stark Industries. People here were friendly and passionate and so excitable. Plus, he didn’t have to wear a suit, unlike some of the announcers and the reporters. He was comfortable in a dark blue t-shirt with Captain America’s shield on it, and a really spiffy and comfortable black jean jacket with jeans and boots.
Tony met his eye and then glanced away. “I just invited your best friend. Why you getting so sappy? Jeez.” The fingers of one hand wrapped around Steve’s wrist. “…Love you too.”
Steve read the messages. “Yeah, she said she had to help a friend and she’ll be back in two weeks.” He let out a whistle. “That’s a long while.”
Bucky took her on automatic, never one to resist carrying his godchild. He cradled her with his flesh and blood arm and rubbed at his face with the other. He looked down at Juliana.
“There we go.” Tony strapped the diaper on securely and looked at the options he had pulled out. “Okay, baby girl, what do you want to wear today?” He held up the onesies, one was yellow with a drawing of an acute angle and the words ‘ACUTE BABY,’ and the second was blue with the Tardis POLICE BOX sign and windows on the chest.
“Shit! Shit!” He ran off, but a ball of electricity hit the ground in front of him, sending him stumbling back hard.
Once he saw it, Tony grinned, wobbly and sweet. “I told you so. Told you Hap and Pep are using our kid for a trial run.” Pepper rolled her eyes at that, smiling.
There was a thud and Tony skidded in from the hall on socked feet, wide-eyed. “What is it? I’m here. JARVIS called. What happened? What’d she do?”
Steve perked up, the question almost tripping over his tongue, but after almost a year of beating around the bush, two years of dating, and then two years of being married to him, Steve was practically an expert on Tony-speak. Tony kept fiddling with the contraption, but by the way he was moving, he was obviously tinkering with it just for something to do.
“Hush, hush.” Tony rubbed DUM-E’s arm and Butterfingers’ left hydraulic cylinder. “And where did you get that, U? What’s up with that?” He raised an eyebrow at the camera U was pointing right at his face.
Peter had done most of his shopping and was helping Wade pick gifts from some of the esports players on his team. They were ambling down the block to a museum Wade thought seemed interesting.
Steve had a feeling this was all Clint’s fault. He was the only one who would even dare bring a Teen Vogue magazine into the Tower and leave it on the coffee table in the common area living room in full view of the other residents of the Tower who, despite not interested in toting around that kind of reading material, would certainly still flip through it when they saw it - those gossipy birds.
Thor caught the hammer before it could hit Jane and then let his arm flop down, sending the hammer thudding against the carpet.
[Image 1: It’s a high angle photo – most likely taken by JARVIS – showing everyone gathered in the living room, bundled up in warm sweaters and blankets with various snacks. Julia, Tony and Steve are in the middle couch. Julia is dressed in a red sweater, mittens, and a pompom hat. Tony and Steve are kissing over her head. Bucky is on the floor, holding up a candy cane to Julia and making a face at Steve and Tony. Clint is beside Bucky, holding up a sign that says ‘Happy 6th Month Juliana!!!
For all he was old and straightforward as hell, Dr. Pius was sneaky and worked swiftly. Before Tony could blink and while Steve was cuddling Juliana, he started on the shots.
Phil nodded and there was that small quirk to his lips that said he definitely didn’t mind. He waved a hand over his should and left them to it.
“What?” Tony squeezed his middle and fluttered his eyelashes a Steve coquettishly. “This is the twenty-first century, darling. Flirting isn’t all just physical anymore. It can even start online. Imagine that.”
“And she’s got Mr. Stark’s brown curls, how coincidental,” Dr. Pius said, stroking the baby’s head. “Seems a perfect combination of you two.”
“Such an ungrateful brat,” Da said as he stood up. “Just for that, your Pops and I are going. Come along, honey bunch, we still have all of the Plaka to see and all those kitschy tourist shops and artisan shops you love looking through.” He scoffed, but looked far too fondly at Pops.
Steve ducked his head, flushing a little. “Thanks, Phil.” He smiled. “And I can’t believe Julia’s almost four months old. It’s like she came home to us only yesterday.”
The door to the restaurant let out a tell-talte ring as it was pushed open, and a familiar form walked in, peering around until he spotted Peter near the window.
Pre-serum Steve had a strong intuition, something that was still present post-serum, especially when coupled with his heightened senses. And honestly, when applied to his devious, mischievous, trouble-making husband, well… he had learned to always,
Suddenly, there was an odd noise and all three of them looked down at Julia, who was wide-eyed in surprise, fingers curled up near her cheeks.
Peter was in the living room of Stark Tower that afternoon, arm and back wrapped up from minor electrical burns, when JARVIS announced that he had a visitor. He looked up from the second web shooter he had been fixing in the taller kitchen tables. Hunching over on the shorter tables put a bit of strain in his back and shoulder and he really wanted to recover as soon as possible.
(A lot of people thought Tony or Steve would be squeamish about it, but it was so much different when you had a child on the way, ya know?)
“Hey! Hey! Baby in the room. Let’s keep any magical levitating items out of the way,” Tony said from the loveseat close to Julia’s playpen.
“You’ll get your turn, DUM-E, U. Don’t jostle the baby,” JARVIS said. Tony knew his AI could just easily communicate to them through the network, but it was also most likely a way to show Steve and Tony that he was on the job.
“Yeah, make sure she gets some,” Steve said. “But she likes being held so if you put her on your stomach or chest, she’s less likely to complain.”
She was more than Tony’s family. She had also become Steve’s. And god knew she’d do anything for Julia too.
Coming from a superhero family, Peter was taught to do two things whenever there was screaming: run away and hide or run away and seek help. But considering the fact that some guy ran right out of the museum just a few feet away and was literally running towards Peter and Wade, all those instructions were kind of moot.
“Whatzit?” Bucky groaned, hair in disarray and a scowl on his face. “It’s way too effing early, punk. Whatchu want?”
Tony had sent out invitations to everyone who wanted to celebrate Juliana’s first Christmas and New Year together, and Jane and Darcy had RSVP-ed enthusiastically to spending the holidays at the Stark Tower with the new addition to the family. Jane and Thor took a detour to London for some personal time, but Darcy had arrived in town a few hours after the Quinjet took the others away and had gallantly volunteered for Clint-sitting duty after finding out all his other playmates had gone. Tony had strongly protested. He didn’t want his Tower blowing up, and those two certainly caused enough trouble worth ten people. But Steve had pushed Tony to leave them alone. A distracted Hawkeye was better than a miserable Hawkeye.
Darcy was suddenly standing on the couch, wide-eyed and arms waving madly. “I taught her something! Oh my god! I have imparted knowledge! I take it back!
“Okay.” Bruce skipped a few questions. They all agreed to skip the cliché relationship ones. “Oh, this one: First mobile phone and first person you ever called?”
And just to make it clear to everyone – to Tony that his gesture was appreciated and to Bucky that the gesture was genuine – Steve invited Bucky to be part of Juliana’s photo book during breakfast the next day, where it was just Steve, who was feeding Juliana; Tony, who was half-awake over his plate of pancakes; and Bucky, who had his own plate and was watching Juliana demolish her first bottle of the day.
“One, because I have learned my lesson in questioning anything Pepper does, ever, in her life, in my life, and with my own company. If Pepper wants to do something, she’ll do it. She does it to my life, to my company, and now apparently she’ll do it to my baby too.”
Da’s head popped up from the couch where he had been reclining with Pops, but a large hand grabbed his head and pulled him down.
It took Steve a while to figure out what he meant. To be fair though, he was making a mental note to ask their paediatrician, Dr. Pius, if maybe Juliana was teething.
Tony grabbed his arm. “Hey, hey, hey! Don’t open that now! I was real careful wrapping it up and I might have confetti in there, you never know!”
Tony tossed a few keycards on the table. “Or we could ignore all that and go for Julia’s first Thanksgiving Parade!” He waved his hands in the air, excited as he talked. Julia waved her hands, making grabby motions too.
[Image 2: It is Julia’s first Christmas and the Avengers’ first Christmas photo with the baby. They are arranged in front of the tree and their massive wall of stockings, all of them wearing Santa hats. On the floor – Phil sitting cross-legged, Bruce smiling shyly, Clint and Bucky leaning close to one another, and Darcy making peace signs. Seated behind them – Natasha and Pepper cheeks together and smiling, Tony with Julia perched on his shoulders, and Jane with a hand on Darcy’s shoulder. Standing at the back – Rhodey and Happy waving at the camera, Steve beaming and holding onto Julia’s hands, and Thor leaning down so he could be close to Jane. DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers are in the background, claws up, and JARVIS is the one who took the photo.
Bruce, who had been quietly plowing through his meal amidst all the chatter, looked up, wide-eyed. “Um… uh…”
Thor had stood up, wide-eyed and already sparking a little at the tips of his hair from excitement. “Truly? You have invited Lady Jane, Lady Darcy, and Erik?”
“Good.” Steve grinned. “Now, you need to get downstairs, clean up your workshop, and figure out how you want the bots to look and how JARVIS is going to be there. I’m going to look for a matching onesie for Julia. We can take the picture tomorrow and hang it up in the nursery for everyone to see in time for Julia’s first month.” He pressed a kiss to Tony’s lips and then patted him on the ass. “Go on.”
One of the things Tony and Steve had talked and fought about long and hard was on who their child was going to be genetically related to. Tony insisted Steve was the better sperm donor, because heee-lloooo? Peak of human perfection, enhanced abilities, accelerated healing factor; enough said. Steve, on the other hand, thought Tony should be the donor, mainly because he didn’t know what the serum could do to their baby.
There were beeps and tire squeals all around as DUM-E, U and Butterfingers immediately reared up and wheeled their way. Before Tony could warn them though, the three stopped a good distance away. DUM-E started going around in circles, like a dog chasing its tail. U was waving a video camera in his claw (where did he get that?). Butterfingers was waving his arm up and down vigorously. They were so excited.
Steve flipped through the first one. It contained mission briefings over the past few months, recruitment files, and training details.
“Tony, I don’t want to spend the next few months with this weird tension,” Steve argued. “And maybe they’d have ideas for their photos. We won’t get away with just taking candids of everyone. Honestly, Natasha might probably pick or plan her photo anyway.”
Steve waved his phone. “Gail really can’t make it. Turns out she has an emergency and has to leave for Augsburg,” his brow furrowed, “Wherever that is.”
Peter thought of protesting, but Wade looked firm so he nodded, leading him down the hall. He sighed in relief when the TV was off and found his parents were gone.
(And they were trying to keep Thor distracted. Jane and Darcy couldn’t make the trip to New York this week and Thor had been feeling down in the dumps.)
“I find, Captain Rogers, that children are usually so much stronger than their parents.” Dr. Pius laid the syringes and band-aids down the table in a line. Tony was a little amused to see they were purple with yellow stars on them.
All of her conditions were doable, though Tony had to be consistently told off on splurging on everything his baby’s mama could want, and Steve had to hold back from punching the doctor that reminded them that they weren’t allowed into the delivery room.
Steve rolled his eyes, “For your information, the first phone I ever got was from SHIELD before Tony gave me a Starkphone, and the first person I ever called was Phil.” He grinned. “The first text message I ever got was from Tony though.” He turned to Tony. “I still have it.”
“Julia’s two months old. It’s time for her shots,” Steve said. Clint made a face. “We’re not looking forward to it either, least of all for her.”
“If you’re not busy,” Steve said. He set about scooping some chicken and curry for Tony. God knew his husband wasn’t going to do it himself what with how busy he was flirting with Bruce.
“You can feel it, can’t you?” Steve asked, looking up at his husband from where he was on the floor playing with Juliana. He was going back to SHIELD tomorrow and he was a ball of mixed emotions right now.
They sat there feeling a little contemplative and nostalgic, and Steve looked at his and Tony’s pictures side-by-side.
“You were adorable though,” Tony said, leaning against Steve. He waved a hand and JARVIS, ever dependable and intuitive, brought up a photo of tiny Steve with his Ma. It was one of Steve’s few and most cherished photos. Steve didn’t really like anybody looking at those, but he didn’t mind if it was Tony.
Steve had finally convinced Tony to allow the bots to come up to the common room and play with Julia for a few minutes. Only one at a time though and always with either Tony or Steve to watch after them. Today it was Butterfingers’ turn. Julia was in the mood to throw stuff around and the bot was studiously wheeling around picking up the toys Julia was throwing out of her playpen and handing them back to her. She screeched at each toy returned, obviously enjoying herself.
“Oh, he’s probably done something, like always, but that’s not why I was calling. I was looking at the calendar on Tony’s phone and noticed you had an appointment with Julia. I was just wondering what that was for.”
(Director Nick Fury gave them really beautiful high-grade baby monitors, which was… kind of to be expected from the man, really. Tony immediately broke them down to check for bugs, to which Steve didn’t really protest. In comparison, Agent Hill gave them a lovely, stress-free baby bathtub.)
“Oh, hey, that’s almost like mine,” Clint exclaimed. “I usually check my Joke of the Day app or Random Fact of the Day.”
Steve wiped some spilled milk from Juliana’s chin as he spoke. “You know that monthly photo book we’ve been making for Julia? We want you to take a photo with her for her third month.”
“That’s a new development. Hopefully, she doesn’t feel the need to start throwing things,” Tony commented. “Jay, calendar that: First time Julia tossed her bottle after being done with it.”
“To be fair, Tony, Juliana’s probably just making sounds and doesn’t actually understand the concept of awe.” Bruce sighed. “Come on, Thor. We still have to make lunch. Hopefully the pasta didn’t overboil.”
“Steve, what the hell are you talking about?” Tony asked, acquiescing to the kiss, if a bit shakily.
“I had to,” Tony protested. “How else was he going to get out of the evil clutches of the Air Force?”
“I would rather spend my days with you, my darling child,” Thor said, cradling her in his arms. As if in reply, Julia let out a raspberry which made the god of thunder chuckle in amusement. “And indeed, we should not be saddened. Tis the season of joy and you make every day so much brighter.”
“There we go, my love,” Tony said. He stroked her head and curly brown hair. “Your favorite blanket, your favorite bottle, your favorite jammies, your mobile, and your Mama, with your Daddies just down the hall.”
Tony had tried to explain the baby to the bots a few months ago. JARVIS obviously knew what was up. He was the one who compiled all sorts of information on adoption, surrogacy, agencies, laws specifically for gay parents, etc. for Tony and Steve the moment they decided they really, really wanted a child of their own. So Tony knew JARVIS probably imparted the knowledge (a.k.a. data) to the other bots sometime along the way. But Tony still felt the need to explain it to them and to JARVIS. More than just his attachment to and affection for his creations, Tony felt he needed to say it out loud too, so that it would also really sink into him that he, Tony Stark-Rogers, and his husband of two years, Steve Stark-Rogers, were going to have a baby.
Before Tony could protest or let the cloud over his head grow larger, Steve handed her over. Tony immediately held Juliana to his chest, mindful of the arc reactor under his shirt. Juliana immediately nuzzled against him, crying against his neck.
Tony wiped away the crumbs from his beard. “Two months ago I got the bots ready. Last month, Pepper got everything ready. It’s your turn, muffin. Go and figure out what you want with the other nonagenarian.”
find out that they all cried and they would tease Tony so, so much more than Steve and that was just a big no-no.
He probably would be less annoyed if his parents didn’t look like they were enjoying themselves so much as they (not really) hid in the restaurant just across the hotel where Peter and the other interns were staying. They were even wearing matching outfits for god’s sake – matching rose gold tinted sunglasses, matching open-toed sandals, and matching white linen beach shirts with red and blue flowers – red for Da and blue for Pops, of course, because they were both ridiculous about their colors even when out of their uniform). Pops was wearing dark cargo shorts while Da, ever dramatic, was in long, black, flowy harem pants.
Steve strapped Juliana deftly in the car seat and Tony checked it over a few times. Ever since it sunk into Tony that he and Steve were going to be parents – which was the first time Tony touched Gail’s baby bump – Tony started designing baby gear, sparking a whole baby line for Stark Industries. The Board thought he was crazy, which was nothing new, but when Tony let it leak to the public to get their reactions, demands started skyrocketing for Iron Man and Captain America approved baby stuff that they finally agreed to give it a try.
DUM-E clicked his claws and U waved the camera. Tony patted them on the strut distractedly, answering in automatic.
Darcy slapped him on the head. “Don’t be mean. And when Thor gets depressed, it’s like trying to hug a jellyfish, squishy but sends my hair standing.” She turned to Steve. “And second point, Cap, you and Iron Dad aren’t planning on inducting junior-ette into the family business?”
The check-up was fairly routine. They took off Juliana’s cute onesie, leaving her in just her diapers, and Dr. Axel measured her height and weight and the circumference of her head. He took her temperature and checked her ears and eyes. Juliana seemed fine with it, letting herself be moved about as she watched her hands and Dr. Pius’ bright, bald head. Or maybe that was just Tony.
It was like Peter was watching in slow motion as the robber ran past their hiding space, still firing his gauntlet. A ball of electricity exploded close to the wall he and Wade were hiding at.
(And had to endure everyone’s dirty looks at having pestered them all only to make a different decision. At least Bruce didn’t mind. He filed the paperwork away, saying they might need it when the desire for another kid came calling.)
“Here, we go.” Steve smiled at Tony and gave him one last kiss before turning to the baby in his arms. He pulled away the edge of the soft, fuzzy blanket, and revealed their newest guest to the three attentive, now-quiet bots.
isn’t around.” She ignored Clint’s shout of indignation and smiled at Julia, held the baby over her head, and started making airplane noises. Julia giggled with delight and waved her arms and legs.
Tony tilted his head towards her. “Are you going to cry? You know I don’t do well when you cry, even if you’re being sappy and saying mushy, lovely stuff. If you cry, I’m going to cry, then Julia’s going to wake up and cry. It’s not going to be good for Steve’s stress levels.”
Peter ignored Wade, who didn’t seem to be following after him. At least someone he cared about was safe.
Steve himself didn’t have a lot of photographs or mementos, at least, not a lot of personal ones. And no, the museum collections dedicated to him didn’t count. His few pictures and personal and private effects were kept by the army and then scrounged up by Howard and then Tony himself. But he liked pictures. They were a form of art, which Steve appreciated. And while he wasn’t into taking pictures of himself – selfies as Tony kept telling him – he liked group pictures – groufies, and seriously, these nicknames were sometimes really weird. He especially liked the ones with the team, and he really, really liked random ones, the candid shots that captured real moments. He much preferred pictures of Tony than himself though, and now with a baby,
Phil groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I am going to make some calls.” He glared at the Tony. “And I’m going to call Pepper first.”
“Jay, take a shot of that smile and send it to the bot nannies, my phone, Steve’s phone, Gail, Pepper, Rhodes,” Tony waved a hand, “Hell, send it to everyone. They need to see how adorable my baby is.”
“I know, and I love them and they’re great. They’re just…” he sighed. “They can be embarrassing sometimes.”
“Where are you taking her?” Tony asked. “And while you may be her fairy godmother, you are not allowed to kidnap my baby.”
Tony poured copious amounts of strong black coffee into a large mug, clasping it to steady his shaking hands, enjoying the feeling of warmth in his seemingly cold body. Natasha reached up to touch his forehead, but Stark quickly batted her hands away, before she, or anyone, could brush against his clammy skin. She gave him a look of suspicion but did not pursue the idea. Steve was staring at him searchingly, Clint glanced him up and down, face lacking its relaxed grin.
“You are ill. Please rely on us. Just for a couple of days. Just until you are well. You won’t be a burden. Let us look after you,” Clint said rationally.
“The reactor core is working well sir, air thrusters have no issues, you should consider oiling around the-“
Slowly changing. Bruce. Tony was suffocating in panic now. Another change. The tall towering figure of Thor. The holograms’ mouths were moving but no sound seemed to reach Tony’s ears. It was Thor, people could hear him three blocks away. They had had the noise complaints. Another shift. Steve. Tony was sinking lower and lower into the black, cold, darkness. A cool hand reached down to him, placing itself on his forehead. A disjointed voice called to him, cutting through the silence that enveloped him.
“Steve can I go now? Just undo these. You can do that. Give me my freedom. Liberate me. I won’t burden you. I’ll take my pills, I’ll sleep. I’ll even lay off my coffee. Just get me out of here. I am going stir crazy.”
“Yuh-huh, I’ll… I’ll get right on that. Top of my list,” replied Tony, barely listening as he fiddled with wires and casing on his workbench.
Tony flashed his winning smile, used to avoid jail sentences and getting him out of Senate committee meetings. But Steve did not relent, and Tony sulked for the rest of his hospital stay.
Tony opened his mouth only to close it, bearing a striking resemblance to a goldfish. Steve’s voice got stricter, more demanding.
Steve had moved closer, too close. Tony could feel the heat radiating off of his body (had the soldier serum turned him into a radiator?), making him uncomfortable, warm and left him feverish. Feeling flushed he made a break for his sanctuary.
Coffee had been fuelling him for 49 and a half hours straight. He always seemed to come up with the best new models when exhausted. He turned at the click of heels on his stone floor. With a sag of his shoulders, he twisted bracing himself for her disappointing glare.
A sharp prodding jarred Tony awake. Dummy was jabbing between his ribs, creating a rather unpleasant churning sensation in Tony’s stomach.
The words came out slurred but the message got across. His wardrobe door opened, revealing his suitcase suit. He put it on, shattered the window with his Repulsor, and took a few unsteady steps before taking flight. He had no clue where he was going, all he knew was that he wanted to get as far away as he could from the pity and the rage and the people who cared about him… Oh god why was he leaving? Was it really such a foreign concept that people actually cared? He landed atop of the Statue of Liberty, sitting on the peak of her torch. He was still clutching his bottle, cradling it in his arms. He began taking small sips, trying to calm his nerves.
Tony would not be ill. He refused to be. It only interferes. Being ill once was enough but Stark had been forced to suffer through it three times. He did not care for the feeling at all.
Tony was lying in his bed, pills on his side table with a glass of iced water, in the comfort of his room. He still felt like ice and fire all at once. A gentle tap on his bedroom door announced the return of Steve. Steve had stuck to him like glue, forcing three meals a day at him. This was incredibly out of routine for Tony, who barely got three meals a week. However he was just grateful that his stomach was allowing him to keep all his food down. This time Steve was laden with a jug of iced water and a bowl of something creamy and red-orange in colour. Soup?
Tony couldn’t think of anything to say, not to Steve. Just blankness. Like every file had been deleted from his hard drive. All he could do was nod. Everyone stared at him. He pulled a hopefully defiant face.
“For approximately four hours and thirty-five minutes, sir. Steve attempted to check on you nine times, Banner tried four times, Thor came down twice, Clint attempted twice but on the second attempt had to drag Natasha upstairs to stop her breaking through the walls.”
The world was moving around him. He needed to make it down to his workshop. He couldn’t pass out here. Not on the sofa, not in the living room. Too public, he would just take up space, be in the way. He could hear Jarvis talking but couldn’t make out the words. He was sinking. Down into darkness. Isolated. He felt so cold. He laughed with bitterness at how reminiscent of his childhood this felt. Sensations were slipping away from him, slipping fast.
Steve chuckled, rolling on the condom and maneuvering into position. He added lube to his erection and dragged Tony’s hips closer to him. “You ready?”
Bruce gave him a stern look. “Tony, I thought by now you’d realize you can come to me if you’re feeling sick?”
“Stop staring and do something,” Tony said, and he winced at the state of his voice. For his part, Steve looked incredibly pleased at the sound.
“Wouldn’t want to keep you waiting,” he murmured, before flipping Tony onto his stomach. Steve’s hands gripped his hips before sliding down and grasping at his ass. He kneaded at the flesh for a moment before grasping the delicate lace and peeling it down.
, lay hidden by his words, and Tony knew Bruce was doing this on purpose but he wasn’t falling for it this time.
“Let us take care of you,” Natasha said. “Just let go.” Then she leaned in to capture his lips, in such a sweet, loving kiss. She tasted like apples and Tony sobbed at the tenderness. She ended the kiss to press his forehead against his. “Let go.”
“Good.” He took the hand, twining their fingers together, thumb against wrist, and felt Tony’s pulse against his.
Tony barked out a short laugh. “No, I’m not. But this did have the nice consequence of you showing up at my door.” At that, something warm suffused within him. Ah, hell, Bucky was right.
And he’d imagine taking those hands, holding them in his own, kissing the hardened tips of the fingers. He’d imagine those hands undressing Steve eagerly, sliding down his abdomen, unzipping his pants and pulling out his hard cock. Stroking him, as Tony would lean in and whisper in his ear about how much he wanted him.
Tony sighed. “Okay. Steve. Please don’t punch me.” And then Tony lifted himself to his tiptoes and kissed him.
Later that night, Dummy showed him the video of Steve he had been working on. He leaned in his chair, watching as the image of Steve hummed along to a tune in his head while he cooked breakfast. All the robots had crowded around him. JARVIS was silent.
“Always so desperate for it,” Steve groaned, his fingers clenching tightly in Tony’s hair. “I should’ve done this when I first met you. You would’ve done it happily, too, wouldn’t you? You’re that much a slut.”
Dummy was looking at him expectantly and Tony couldn’t help it. He patted his strut. “I know, buddy, I know this is your way of being nice to me. But you and me are going to have a stern talk about boundaries. And you two,” he said in a louder voice, glancing at Butterfingers and You, who were beginning to whine, “we are going to have a lovely chat about the evils of peer pressure, you understand me?” He surveyed the room once more and winced when he found a pile of printed photos of Steve on another table. “Okay, you guys are going to need to clean all this up and—”
“It’s what happens when you’re head of R&D and have to engineer new Avengers tech in your spare time. Now if you don’t mind—”
The robot let out a series of beeping noises that sounded vaguely like a whine and strangely humanlike in its emotion.
“Yes, dear,” Steve said, bending down to kiss him sweetly. He ran his fingers through Tony’s soft locks and Tony felt he could almost purr at the sensation.
She strode over to her water bottle and towel, drying off the sweat on her forehead. “If you’re not going to give me a challenge, then there’s no point to this.”
“Nah, Iron Patriot can handle it.” Tony couldn’t help but smirk at the flat pronunciation of ‘Iron Patriot’ – Rhodey was still annoyed over the name change. “Talk to you soon.”
It was a very sweet kiss. A kiss that made Steve ached to turn it into something deeper and headier, but he kept it light. He figured there would be other times for those kinds of kisses. It only lasted a few moments and when Steve pulled back, he saw Tony’s eyes were closed, his lashes fanning his cheeks. He slowly opened his eyes and mumbled, “That wasn’t a punch.”
It was that visual, of being fucked over a table while everyone looked on in shock, that did it for Tony. He gasped, clutching at the sheets, and shuddered, rubbing his cock down as much as he could with Steve still holding him. He collapsed with a final weak moan, no strength left to hold himself up. Steve continued to fuck into him, but just as he was being to feel sore, Steve bit down on his shoulder as he filled Tony with his come.
After touring America and seeing her changes, Tony invited him and the rest of the team to live in the tower. For being someone who claimed to work alone, Stark was eager to continue the Avengers Initiative. Steve was skeptical, but so far is working brilliantly. These strong personalities, after working out their kinks and outside of the influence of Loki’s scepter, managed to fit perfectly on the field and off (well, mostly). Even Tony, who Steve was at first unimpressed (and disappointed with if he was being honest), turned out not to be a complete asshole. All of his bravado disappeared the more time he spent with him, especially with Tony sleep-deprived and fresh off an engineering binge.
Dummy made a whining noise before turning the camera around and focusing it on his siblings. Butterfingers was mopping the floor where it was oil stained and You was bopping along to AC/DC. He whined again.
Steve pressed at one palm and Tony winced. “That doesn’t look fine.” Into the comm, he said, “Widow, bring the quinjet closer. Iron Man is injured.”
“We know, Hulk. You were just trying to help. And now, why don’t you let Dr. Banner out so he could help?”
As far as contemporary technology goes, JARVIS was one of the most useful. Of course Tony was careful in explaining, when he first introduced Steve to his AI, that JARVIS was the most advanced of his kind and not everyone had an AI in their homes. From the beginning JARVIS had been considerate and accommodating, helping Steve at every possible moment. And Steve couldn’t help but marvel at Tony’s genius for creating something so extraordinary.
Ten days later, Robert Plant’s shouting and Jimmy Page’s fast strumming shocked him out of sleep. “Are you fucking kidding me?” he muttered, not even bothering with sandals this time. He ignored his neighbors’ loud curses as his fist pounded on the door. When no one answered, he twisted the doorknob and found it unlocked. He entered the apartment.
“Ga! Boo!” Julia waved her fists. Gail blew one too, and Julia erupted into giggles. She turned to Tony, an expectant look on her face. Tony blew one right on her cheek.
Butterfingers suddenly perked up and slowly, almost comically wheeled forward inch by inch until his claws caught on the end of Juliana’s blanket by her tiny,
“Anyway,” Phil waved a hand, “As agreed, you’ll be doing regular hours for a few weeks in a consultant and trainer’s capacity. I took the liberty of pulling a few of the open cases we have so you can review them with fresh eyes, and I have the stats of some of the new recruits you’ll be overseeing once you come back, just a few things to get back into the loop.”
“Yes, my darling breadstick, because, and here comes point number three,” Tony held up three fingers, “Pepper is more likely to tell you the truth than tell me, because three point one, you’re Captain America. Three point two, you’re Steven Rogers. And three point three, you cannot lie to save yourself, you really can’t, peppermint.”
“Come on. It's okay, my love. It’s just a shot,” Tony said. “Sometimes things can hurt and… and it’s okay if you cry about it.”
“You’re so smart, zvonochek,” Bucky said, rolling over to his front and pillowing his head in his arms. He let Julia grab a finger. “Now baby, say Bucky!”
As they hit the two-month mark, Tony’s life with his husband and their baby girl could be described in one word: blissful.
Thor nodded attentively. “Oh, I see. But I have always wondered at such medical methods. I would think Midgardian parents would rather not inflict pain on their offspring or on themselves for that manner.”
“And I think it appropriate for Anthony to show restraint,” Thor added. “We would not want your offspring spouting such foul words.”
The first one was the one of the Colonel and Julia, which was fine, but Steve’s eyes widened at the second photo.
“H-Hi.” Peter waved awkwardly. “I’ve been such a big fan ever since I heard that you use the proceeds of your wins to set up CEGA and Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children, and when you won the E-League two years ago against Ajax.”
Tony ignored him. “You blush and stutter and then you fold faster than Clint when faced in front of anything bite-sized and edible or Thor when faced with Pop Tarts and Pop Rocks candy, which we all know is as fast as hell. All of which culminates to the point that Pepper wouldn’t want to worry
“Sure.” Tony was stretched out on the couch, busy with his tablet. He didn’t even look up, probably hadn’t even heard him.
Tony reached under the couch and pulled out a box. He reached in and threw a handful of paper confetti in the air.
Rhodey just rolled his eyes and hauled the genius up with a grin, before wrapping him in a bear hug. For all his pretending, Tony hugged him back just as fiercely.
“Next time – though god forbid there would be a next time – I would appreciate a text or a call. I was really worried, you know.”
Two days later and the happening in Greece was still on the news. Peter was relieved that the mess was so sudden and surprising that there weren’t any cameras around to catch him in action – though he had a feeling Da, JARVIS, and SHIELD might have also had something to do about that. Only the intervention of Iron Man and Captain America made the news.
“U probably just wanted to capture the moment,” Steve said chuckled, watching them fondly as he cradled the bundle to his chest and did that cute side-to-side rocking motion.
Bucky scooped her up, kissing her cheeks until she was shrieking with laughter. “Zvonochek, when you grow up, I’m going to teach you the fine art of baking. It’s all about technique, ya know? An’ good instincts an’ good taste…”
“Petey-pie, we know this is your trip. We signed the parental consent, not to mention paid for everybody’s trip–”
Tony shrugged again. “Nah. I mean, seriously, they probably know. They’re just wondering about the order and probably planning their shoot. I say we not mention a thing and make them squirm.”
[Image: In the middle is Juliana, dozing on her bassinet placed on a two-foot tall stand. She’s wearing a onesie that had colorful gears, gauges, and wires drawn on it.

Dr. Pius said, frowning. “I have heard thousands of babies cry, but hers is quite intensely saddening.”
“I do have a concern though,” Phil spoke up, and Steve immediately straightened. “Nothing serious, Steve. Don’t worry.” He pulled out two folders among the few he had on hand. “I’ve been meaning to give these to you, actually. I guess now’s a good time.”
[Image 3: Natasha smiling at the camera as she sat on the sofa with a mug of tea. Clint has his head on her lap, crossing his eyes and sticking his tongue out.]
Gail broke out laughing, while Tony scrambled onto the couch, looking incredibly giddy himself and cheering them on.
New York City was at its best and brightest during the Christmas season. Steve had always loved it, even back in the old days despite how much his health usually suffered because of the cold weather and the lack of hearty things to eat. Those were the times Steve’s Ma really had to tighten her belt, always trying to make sure Steve was as well-fed and warm as possible and scrambling for medicine whenever he couldn’t avoid getting the chills.
Pops perked up. “Ooh, that’ll be exciting.” He finished the rest of his coffee. “A walk through the oldest neighborhood in Athens will no doubt be so inspiring. Did you bring my–”
Steve watched them all, warm and amused. It was times like these when the ever-present ice in his veins seemed to thaw almost completely. He remembered once again that for all there were things to miss and be saddened about, there were also so many more things to be grateful for.
Steve let Tony and Julia play for a while, pleased as punch whenever the three of them were together.
Tony looked at the photo and a smile bloomed on his face, warm and content. “Yeah, it’s… it’s a beauty. You have good taste as always, Miss Potts.”
“Have fun, you two.” Pops waved a hand. A silver car stopped just in front, Da at the wheel, Pops got in and they immediately left.
Wednesday rolled around and Happy walked in at the middle of their Avengers-sized breakfast with Juliana in the midst of her Avengers-sized tantrum.
That was Steve’s cue. One of the things he and Tony had talked about regarding adopting a newborn was the mutual understanding that babies cried and even if they both hated it and loved her more than anything else in the world, sometimes it really wasn’t their fault. Hearing Bruce and Clint explain probably helped, but it was definitely time to bundle his husband away. A sleepy Tony was a good thing though. It made him more agreeable to Juliana being with Pepper and Happy for the day if he was going to be sleeping through most of it.
“Thank you, Thor,” Steve said. “And Tony and I still need to give your mother a thank you gift. Julia needs to be years older before we’ll even think of taking her anywhere, but you know your mother and your people are welcome here if they can make the trip.”
Juliana finally finished her bottle, letting the nipple pop out of her mouth. She waved her fists demandingly.
Wade Wilson was nineteen years old and made a name for himself as an e-sports player. Under the moniker Deadpool, he became well-known for his specialty in death match games and for famously defeating former E-League champion Ajax two years ago during his debut as a professional e-sports player. Stark E-Games Division immediately snapped him up as one of their sponsored pro e-sports players. Since he was still set to enter college, their offer also came with a spot as one of Stark Industries Scholars.
Steve made a mental note to remind Bucky never to have weapons on him when he was playing with Julia. He knew Bucky was careful, but there was nothing wrong with reminding him. He then made a hand motion towards Clint, who handed the baby over. The archer then grabbed the metal-armed supersoldier and dragged him off to the kitchen.
“Yep.” Tony took a swig of coffee. He looked at Steve’s confused face. “Cheesecake, you’re a hell of a lot smarter than the blond hair clichés.”
Tony wasn’t even fazed. “Oops. Well at least now you have your excuse.” He waved his hands in shooing motions. “Now, chop, chop, porkchop, go and have the bots take that armor off.” He paused. “But since you’re going
“I would have thought you’d rather have Juliana’s first Thanksgiving here at the tower. She won’t exactly remember any of it,” Natasha commented quietly to Steve. They watched as Bruce tried to talk his way out of the trip, but Tony had picked Julia up and was waving the baby at him. Julia thought it was all a fun game. Thor was also vocal about getting to watch the Parade in person.
“So you’re wearing nothing under there?” Tony asked, walking over and peering at the armor as if he could see through them. At the back of his mind, Steve wondered how he even knew what Tony’s perving-on-Rhodey face was.
“Aww, don’t mind the birdie, Iron Pot,” Darcy commented, just as Julia reached her. “He’s just being prissy and jealous because a certain
Juliana paused from slobbering all over her new toy and regarded Bucky with a gummy smile. She raised a hand towards him, making grabbing motions.
Tony was silent, one hand holding his tablet with a white-knuckled grip. His eyes were wide and so disbelieving, as if any second Steve was going to take it back and laugh at him.
“Nah, it’s fine. Happy will be here.” Steve snapped his fingers. “Oh, and Gail’s coming for dinner, by the way. Hopefully. Maybe.” He winced.
Despite only just giving birth, Gail looked like a vision. Her long, dark hair tumbled about her shoulders and face. She looked tired, but she was glowing and smiling widely as she cradled a bundle to her chest.
“Are you going by Mom, Mama, or Mommy?” Steve asked, twitching a little when he noticed a tiny hand and even tinier fingers moving. Beside him, Tony seemed to be just as twitchy and transfixed.
As Juliana’s third month dawned, Steve and Tony were relieved that she started sleeping just a little longer through the night. It was still a bit touch and go on just what time Juliana wanted to sleep, but she slept somewhere between five and seven hours, which was certainly a lot more than her parents usually got considering Tony’s habit of not-sleeping and Steve not needing as much sleep. They were slowly trying to get her into a set sleep schedule, and while they weren’t always successful, they were trying.
Steve smiled, reaching a hand up to secure the flailing Juliana. He turned to Phil. “Thanks for helping us out, Phil.”
“Oh, she and Bruce went to get pizza and takeout,” Steve said, grabbing his phone. “I should tell them to get more.”
Julia drank her milk slowly, blue eyes blinking slowly before latching on to the mobile over her head.
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know. We’ll think of something. Now, come on. You’re a mess and you need a shower, dinner, a movie, and then bed.”
Wade laughed. “I can imagine having superhero parents constantly hovering over you is definitely cause for talk.”
Steve was awed at the gesture. Everybody had been so supportive when he and Tony started dating all the way to when they got married. Steve didn’t really think that would change now that they have a kid, but displays like these from the people he considered his family couldn’t help reminding him that he had a lot to be thankful for.
Ned grabbed Peter in a headlock. “That is so cool, man! All those all-nighters paid off! And you were so worried about it.”
Darcy turned to Steve, ruby red lips pouting. “Okay, first of all, you know Thunderbae’s going to freak that he and Gail managed to miss each other… for the gajillionth time.”
“And you?” Clint asked Steve. He paused as Tony started snickering in the background. “Nah, never mind. I know what it is.”
Steve smiled, reaching out to pat each of their claws. “This is Juliana, and she’s going to be your new baby sister.”
[Image 1: Gail is beaming at the camera with baby Juliana in her arms, her eyes open and mouth wide in a yawn.]
“We have an appointment on Wednesday with a very important person,” Tony declared. “And by we, I mean Julia, and by appointment, I mean babysitting, and by VIP, I mean Pepper.”
Julia cooed at the view of the trees and the sky overhead, hands and feet waving and drooling a little. She was in a white dress with flowers embroidered on the bottom and yellow socks with a matching yellow flower headband. She was so adorable and Steve didn’t even bother stopping Tony from taking pictures of her. They were gifts from Sam Wilson, a nice guy from the VA Steve met a few weeks ago.
[Image 4: Bucky is in the kitchen, wearing a black apron with the words ‘This Is A Manly Apron, For A Manly Man, Doing Manly Things, With Manly Food.’ Phil is in the background, waving a pair of tongs and wearing a blue apron with the words ‘The Grillfather’ on it.]
Wade’s blue eyes crinkled, obviously grinning under his facemask. Wade had an accident when he was a kid that took his parents and most of his body. He was scarred all over and usually wore face masks, gloves, long sleeves, and hoodies to hide himself. Like right now he had on a thin, long-sleeved shirt, a beanie, gloves, and a facemask despite the heat.
Later that night, Tony finally got his groove back and expressed his appreciation for his husband’s idea in very creative, sweaty, wonderful ways.
They arrived at the kitchen where everybody was gathered. Bruce was on the table with his tea mug and a plate full of food, scribbling something on a notepad. Phil was talking to Natasha with SHIELD folders scattered in front of them. Bucky and Clint were bickering good-naturedly, while Thor was demolishing a huge bowl – pot, really – of cereal and a plate piled high with bagels.
Wade shook his head, looking more amused than anything. “It’s fine. I’m just glad to see you’re okay, even though I had to ask Miss Potts for an update.”
As the conversation seemed to be dissolving into some awkward silence and staring between their son and this rather interesting young gamer, Tony stepped up.
“Nuh-uh, no way.” Wade sidestepped him. “I can see the bandage around your arm and the ones peeking out from your shirt collar. I’ve got this.” He smiled under his glasses and mask. “Kitchen? I bought dessert.” He stepped forward.
“See you later, boss,” Happy called out, baby and bag on hand and Steve felt his heart drop down to his knees. But he trusted Pepper and Happy and he knew Juliana was in safe hands.
Tony made a kissy face at him. “Are you free from Monday to Wednesday to spend a few days with the most adorable person in the world? And the cutest, most gorgeous baby in the world? And Steve?”
“HA!” Bucky exclaimed instead and stopped at that. And honestly, only Steve, Thor and him had room to talk regarding height in the team and Natasha would probably kill them if they said something unflattering.
JARVIS had dimmed the lights a little in deference to brand new, sensitive eyes, but Tony had a crystal clear view of every detail of his daughter. She was tiny, so tiny, with the smallest hands and feet. There was a tuft of dark hair on her head and she had the chubbiest cheeks and roundest little tummy. She had been sleeping since the moment they left the hospital, but now she was stirring awake, and Tony was absolutely transfixed as she blinked her eyes open slowly, looking up at them with dark blue eyes.
Steve had browsed through thousands and thousands of monthly baby photos. Most parents took pictures of the babies and added cute little captions on what milestones they had achieved over the past month or some cute little fact about them. They were all so adorable and while Steve wanted to make one for Juliana, it was kind of redundant and common. Also Tony, so pleased with just about every single thing his daughter did, had already made ‘JJ Stark-Rogers’ Calendar of Awesomeness,’ where he had JARVIS jot down almost every single milestone, reaction, and trivia about their daughter. Steve had made a habit of it too, asking JARVIS to take a picture or take note whenever Steve noticed something so compelling about his baby, never mind that his baby usually just slept, pooped, ate or stared at them, rinse and repeat.
It was a low-risk mission, so technically there wasn’t much to worry about. But Steve couldn’t help feeling antsy, and all three of them, Bucky moreso, had bluntly told Steve to stop calling every hour.
Julia made a face and pursed her lips, letting out a raspberry. Her eyes lit up and she turned to Steve with a huge laugh.
“Remember what we talked about?” Steve asked, not even the least bit awkward at talking to the bots as if they were real. “Juliana is just a baby and she’s still really small and really fragile. So you guys can’t touch her or carry her yet.”
Iron Man in armor sans helmet and a casually-dressed yet shield-toting Captain America landed in front of Peter in a defensive cover.
“Juliana’s growing up fast,” Phil commented, soft in that way he was only when around Julia and the Avengers. “And parenthood suits you… both of you.”
“Will we be seeing the photo you picked?” Phil asked. Bruce approached him, attempting to hand over Juliana, but the agent ignored him. Natasha immediately shook her head when he turned to her.
SHIELD received a tipoff about shady activity in Norilsk, Russia and decided the information was sound enough to warrant sending out a team. It required undercover work and fluency in Russian, which was why Bucky and Natasha went up to bat. Phil went along as their handler since he had pretty passable Russian and was the only SHIELD agent Bucky willingly worked with.
Tony made a face despite the grin obviously tugging at his lips. “It’s why he’s always so careful with his stupid phone even though I told him JARVIS saves everything and can transfer stuff to the new one.”
Da placed a hand on Pops’ shoulder. “And here you thought our honeymoon was going to be villain free, snookums.”
After what happened in Greece, Peter had been spirited away by his parents and SHIELD, so he wasn’t able to say goodbye to Wade and all the other scholars, and then he spent all of yesterday in recovery. He woke up this morning to a ton of Wade’s texts and had actually been thinking about what to say in between soldering his new web shooter.
Their peace and quiet was broken when a proximity alert appeared on the TV, sending everyone into motion. Clint was crouching on nimble feet in an instant, a squirming Juliana held protectively to his chest. Natasha was already heading for the windows, gun in hand, and Thor and Bruce came barreling in from the kitchen with messy aprons.
Steve chuckled. “So as scary as it is and as much as we say no, Tony and I know we’re not going to stop her from doing anything she wants.”
days and his bots, though loved and cherished, were still cold machines. (As in literal, machine, steel kind of cold, okay? Because nothing in this world would convince Tony that his bots had no personality or warmth, and that was that!)
“Come here, you.” Steve leaned down and swooped his daughter in his arms, peppering kisses all over her chubby cheeks. She screeched and giggled wildly.
“My turn to what?” he asked. Steve wiped Juliana’s chin with a bib. Oh, but they had a leaky baby in their hands.
Clint ran a hand through her curly locks. “Juju-bean is the most adorable baby in the world. I mean, I’ve seen a few babies and I guess all babies are probably adorable by default, but she is something else. She’s like adorableness times infinity.”
“Still. Everyone should now,” Tony said haughtily. He laid Juliana down on Steve’s tummy. “Here you go, my love. Go wrestle your Pops into submission. Go! Go!”
“Ooh yeah. Nobody wants that.” Tony winced. “Okay, so Happy gets the baby by lunch, then maybe we can get Thor to babysit her for dinner. That’ll keep his mind off this.” He gave Julia a little jiggle. “Here that, baby girl? You have to make sure you’re all cute for Uncle Thor so we don’t get his sad eyes. They’re deadlier than your baby blues when you cry.”
, and, as Tony mentioned, he and Pepper had made enough noise that he would sue anybody who tried to get close enough to try. Steve had never been a fan of making grand announcements or press releases, but he knew he couldn’t just leave it all to Tony. So he had also made it clear that he Strongly Disapproved of children being tailed by the media, especially his own.
Steve paused when he noticed that the door to the playroom was open. Ever since Julia came into their lives, the Avengers and most of their family and friends usually took the trip to the playroom to see her or hang out in her room. Many a time their friends, or even Steve and Tony themselves, would just sit on the rocking chair with or without Julia in the room.
As if agreeing with him, Julia waved her arms and feet in the air. Bucky had to rock her gently to soothe her. Tony made a mental note to have JARVIS upload some more of Juliana’s pictures into Thor’s phone so he had a lot to show the Asgardians.
Peter sighed, rubbing his forehead. “Da, we’ve been texting and calling every night since I left. You said you were both going on a trip, but you couldn’t even tell me you guys were
Thor had been the last to meet Juliana, already three weeks since she was born before a strike of lightning revealed the Asgardian on the landing pad at the Tower balcony. Thankfully, Pepper had taken Julia to the nursery or else the baby would have startled badly at the flash of light.
Steve snorted. “They would if they didn’t know I was in love with a man, which is impossible. Everybody knows I’m in love with only one person.”
“I have not yet had the pleasure of attending a Midgardian ceremony,” Thor said. “But the first nuptials I have ever witnessed were between Ancora, one of my Mother's trusted knights, and Illora, her childhood sweetheart. The celebration lasted five moons. I got most drunk.” He added proudly.
The door slid open just as War Machine flew in, landing in the middle of the living room with a thump.
“Yep,” Tony said, grinning. “And it’s so weird that you’re the only one who hasn’t met her in person yet, Point Break. Like, she was pregnant for a few months and then she gave birth… it’s either you’re out of the freaking planet or you’re at New Mexico or Gail’s got her own thing.”
“We got Gail to thank for all that,” Tony said. “And whoever knocked her up, I guess, but I prefer thinking it’s all Gail.”
“People wear either too much stuff or not enough, too colorful or too, what do you call it, emo,” Bucky explained.
And honestly, Steve would say it was excessive, but he and Tony actually had a lot of fun making those emails.
Steve nodded. “And honestly, Tony really wanted to take Bruce out. So I thought I’d let him set up.”
Bucky jolted up, plucking a gun from thin air and pointing it at the window. “Whozit? Whazit? I’ll shoo’em.”
Bruce was surprisingly a lot calmer than they expected. He had admitted that Juliana’s cry was really quite disconcerting, but he wasn’t unbothered mainly because the scientific part of his mind understood that babies cried all the time. And since she was already crying, the Other Guy would get antsier leaving her without seeing her calm down.
Thor roared – a controlled roar, mindful of little ears –and immediately swooped Tony up in an embrace and shaking him.
“Oh, but she will, and no one will stop her,” Tony scoffed. He raised two fingers. “Two, I have caused her enough pain, headaches, and stress over the past years, so honestly, if Pepper needs my baby to… I don’t know, unwind or something, then I can’t really contest that.”
“I’m doing okay, thought I’d say hi,” Wade spoke through the face mask. His bright blue eyes were smiling behind his glasses. “And to thank you both again for all your help with the sponsorship and the scholarship.”
But it was true. JARVIS talked to their baby sometimes, and Julia heard his voice a lot, especially when she was with Tony. JARVIS also talked to Juliana whenever she had those crying episodes and Steve was too hoarse to keep reading to her and Tony kind of wanted to cry himself. Tony called those Juliana’s crazy time. Bruce and all the paediatricians in the world called it colic. Steve just wanted Tony to stop calling their baby crazy.
“You still on that kid-friendly cursing kick?” Darcy asked Tony, grinning as she watched Juliana crawl towards her. She clapped her hands, coaxing Julia closer.
“More like a PowerPoint presentation, complete with graphs,” Happy shrugged, rocking Juliana along with it. She was blessedly soothed now though, as per Reason #34.
“They’d be impressed,” Natasha spoke up, staring at the photo. She tilted her head to the side. “I didn’t know Rhodey looked like that under the suit.”
“Blueberry and blackberry pie with crumble on top.” Bucky grinned proudly. “So you better leave some space for that.”
“I was on a mission at the time in Ireland,” Natasha shared. “There was a couple getting married close to the hotel I was staying at. The bride was redheaded, easy to pretend I was a cousin.” She smirked. “I may have swiped a few bottles from the open bar. Helped me get through the mission.”
child was finally here, finally home. This child was going to grow up surrounded by heroes and robots and… and a lot of bad things Tony wasn’t going to think about right now. But good things! Yes, a lot of good things! Think of the good things!
“You do all the growing you need to do, baby girl,” Tony said, making kissy faces at Juliana as he changed her diapers. Part of fatherhood and marriage was compromise, especially with diaper changes. “Even though I’m wondering how the hell this much stuff came out of a small thing like you.”
Tony followed his little family to the elevator, his heart and stomach warming at the sight of them. His other family was left in the workshop, but he had JARVIS keeping them all connected, so that was enough. Besides, Steve was right. They could have the bots come up when Juliana was ready.
Steve watched them, transfixed at his best friend and his daughter.  He was broken from his musing when Natasha elbowed him gently. She gave him a small smile and wiggled the phone she sneakily had in one hand.
“Oh, my love.” Tony held her close. He racked his brains. He wasn’t sure how to go about soothing his baby, but he knew how to soothe Steve when he was having bad days and nightmares, so maybe that could work.
“He’s planned it all out, Bruce, and you know he won’t stop nagging.” Steve smiled. “And I agree with Tony anyway.”
Tony was torn between being amused and indignant that didn’t even have time to think of a retort before Dr. Pius moved on, rubbing Juliana’s chubby baby legs with the wipes.
“What?” Tony grinned. He used to be embarrassed when Steve stared at him and their daughter in that way, but now he was too used to it. He was sure he looked at Steve and Juliana the same way.
Steve frowned, sitting down beside him on the bed. “What are you talking about? I can so… I mean, people shouldn’t lie, but–”
Tony scoffed, affecting an air of incredulity. Yet Steve could see the shake in his shoulders. “Brothers? Um, cupcake, honey bunch, husband of mine, we only have one child, unless you’re hiding some tyke from me. And while I lived the fast and furious lifestyle in my youth, I have been intensely lucky enough not to sire any offspring.” He waved a hand at Steve. “Unless you’re referring to Barton and Barnes in all their childishness, then okay, yeah, we can call them Julia’s brothers.”
Steve smiled and agreed at everything he heard. “Yeah, I think that would be really nice. Wade seems like a good apple. And we should really thank Stark E-Games Division for helping a lot of these at-risk young people.” He shrugged. “I don’t know a lot about gaming, but maybe we could help them out with more of their projects.”
Phil and Natasha greeted them good morning, with Natasha taking time to press a kiss to Julia’s chubby cheek. She smiled indulgently when Julia sighed at her.
“Pepper? Pepper, it’s Steve.” Steve glared again at Tony, who was pushing at Steve’s legs and rearranging them to who knows what.
“She’s fine for now, Thor,” Steve hastily said. “Her tummy won’t like it if she drinks more. Don’t forget to burp her.”
“DUM-E, don’t get too excited, okay?” Tony said, leading them slowly towards the couch. He ignored Steve’s amused huff. “We talked about this. You’re the oldest, so you need to set a good example for U and Butterfingers.”
Steve thought about that. It was a pretty good idea, some mementos for their child when they were older and it was also something of a family project for him, Tony, and their baby. “That sounds like a good idea,” he said. “It’ll be fun.”
Steve shook his head and Tony felt a little saddened to hear that. While Gail, the birth mother, was delightful, amazing, and still very much a part of their lives and the baby’s, she was a busy woman.
Steve chuckled. “We’ll all love it and Julia will love it whenever you’ll get the picture taken, Darcy. Don’t worry about it.”
Steve handed Tony a cloth and turned back to Bucky. “Anyway, I still need to feed Tony and get him into the shower and a suit for his meeting.” He ignored Tony’s outraged noises. “You go play with your goddaughter. She has her milk, and her blanket and toys are in the living room. Go.” Steve shooed him off.
[Image 4: Tony is lying sideways across the table, head propped on a fist. He is wearing sunglasses, a tight black crop top that hid the arc reactor but showed off his abs, and the metal jetboots of the suit. An Iron Man helmet is placed strategically over the crotch area. It’s signed ‘With love, Tony,’ with a red kiss mark. Tony’s lips in the photo looked like a matching shade.]
“Like hell I will.” MJ scoffed. She had her phone out and trained at them. “I’ll get a hundred more followers after this.”
The birth mother, Gail, had supplied them with more than few bottles of breast milk ready in the fridge and freezer. Gail produced a lot of milk and while Tony wanted to stockpile, both Steve and Gail had patiently told him there were too many babies out there who needed breast milk, so they also donated a few.
“Pete said the same thing. It was actually like, one of the first things he said he fixed with the new console,” Ned commented, ever supportive, as Peter flushed redder.
“I love Juju-bean and all, but I do not envy you guys,” Clint said. “I mean, she’s going to cry, like a lot. Whenever she cries, it feels like something inside me shrivels up and dies.”
“Juliana, baby, Julia, how could you do this?” Tony whined. “How could you betray me like this, my love?”
“Petey, Wade’s being sponsored by Stark E-Games and he's a Stark Industries Scholar so he’ll actually be around
Juliana brought her fingers to her mouth and Tony chuckled. He noticed Dr. Pius giving him a considering look.
“They have been informed of your arrival, Sir, and that you and the Captain have brought a delicate package with you. They’re excited to see you both, and I have warned them to be careful.”
Steve sighed. He didn’t know what he expected. “Our daughter is not going to pummel foes or curse them out,” he said.
Peter’s gaze dropped and he groaned just as Wade exclaimed, “Oh, Mister Stark-Rogers, your pants… er… split…”
“I think it’s hilarious,” the archer said, only to yelp when Mjolnir suddenly shot off its spot hanging from the Christmas tree and flew past Clint, bringing his legs up in the nick of time lest they be dragged right off him. “Hey!”
Steve let them have a bit of privacy and handed Julia over to Bruce, ignoring the man opening his mouth in an attempt to decline. He and Tony had talked about it and they both agreed on how important it was for Bruce to bond with the baby. Hell, they both knew it was important for the baby to bond with
Peter grabbed his watch. Another thing about coming from a superhero family, and also having a tech genius for a father, you always had options on hand. He pressed a button for an SOS call, which would most likely go to his parents since they were in the same country, and then tugged at the watch face until it unraveled, revealing the web shooter he had been designing for weeks.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest with a huff. “Pep, just a reminder, my baby is barely two months old and far too young to be put in heels or taught how to take over the world.”
“Tony, you know how busy Pepper is. We can go out, but you don’t have to force her of all people to babysit. We can ask Phil or Nat instead, even Bucky.” He looked up in thought. “Or we can take her with us, but I really don’t want the paparazzi getting a picture of her.”
Tony moved to a spot away from the bright windows, and kept his hand against his baby’s neck, thumb rubbing against a shoulder. Then he rocked slowly to and fro, murmuring gently.
“Rogers-override- six-zero-alpha-nine-three-one.” Steve crossed his arms over his chest. “JARVIS, show me the photos Tony printed out for Colonel Rhodes.”
“Man of Iron, you are a friend like no other,” Thor boomed. “I shall call my Lady Jane. Then I will be back with much haste and we shall partake in this movie of the sea, its shape changing demigods, and singing crustaceans for your offspring.” He smacked a kiss on Tony’s cheek. “Thank you.”
Clint was rarely rendered speechless and flushed. Everybody laughed. He punched Bucky on the arm, but Bucky just kissed his shoulder with a grin.
“Everybody decent?” Tony called out as they slowly shuffled in. “I mean, I’ve seen worse and I’ve been seen at my worst so pretty much nothing can surprise me but, you know, I just thought I’d ask to be polite.”
“Everything's okay, baby,” Steve said, face buried in her hair and holding onto her fist. Tony grabbed the other flailing one and rubbed it.
Steve explained. “Gail heard Tony over the phone when he was cursing his engineers and she didn’t take it lightly, ripped him a new one. He’s trying to be more… creative and family-friendly.”
Christmas was always bittersweet, and there were so many other people that Steve would miss, moments he would never get back, nightmares that would probably never stop, maybes and what ifs that would always run through his mind. But the world had also been kind to him – new friends gained and old ones returned, once-in-a-lifetime (twice in his case) experiences compared to most people, a husband and a child to share his life with and shower with all the love he had inside him.
Bruce had gotten over his hang ups of carrying Julia easily enough, pretty much because of Tony’s pushiness and Steve’s knack for handing Julia over to Bruce at a time when his hands were free. But his one-on-one interactions with the infant could be counted in one hand.
Steve was shaking and he had to hold on to Tony’s hand to stop it. He had a small bouquet of flowers in his other hand with a card for Gail. The others would come in and bring in more presents for her later once she was resting and had settled nicely into her private room.
“Ah, ah, ah, Juju-bean. No grabby the ears,” Clint said, taking her hands away from the hearing aids. “Uncle Clint needs that to hear your beautiful screams.”
She was letting her little tongue out and her gaze, unable to focus yet, passed over the three bots peering at her.
Tony pointed to the blue diaper bag he and Steve had painstakingly packed the night before – more of Steve really, because Tony mostly played with the baby. “We brought all her favorites, her blanket, pacifier, pillow, bottle. And we’ll have Pepper and JARVIS on the phone, sometimes she likes their voices more than ours.” He pouted.
“You’re telling me,” Tony grumbled.  “I planned it to the last detail, and what do you people do? Thor and Jane suddenly decide on a romantic getaway and you’re only available this weekend and won’t be able to spend Christmas here. You people suck.”
“They all did. Miss Hauer cried.” Phil’s lip twitched. “Having a child together was the final straw. She was so happy for you two. Oh, and she said thank you for the cheese rolls you sent. They were her favorite.”
“Sure. It’ll be nice, memories for all of us.” Steve smiled, leaning down to kiss Tony gently. He tasted a little like coffee, sugar, and the sandwich Steve had to force him to eat, but his mouth was warm and sweet and Steve loved him. He leaned back and Tony was a little flushed and a lot happy. “But I don’t want it to be about milestones and… and not just random memories though.”
On the sixth day of their trip, their last day before they go back to New York tomorrow, the entire thing went sour.
Steve noticed the mischief in Tony’s eyes, and kissed his cheek, shushing him. Tony huffed and pouted.
At the corner of his eye, Steve noticed Natasha’s cheek twitch, so slight that Steve wouldn’t have noticed it if his eyesight wasn’t so sharp.
Steve managed to press the Call button on Pepper’s name, before tossing it farther up the bed. He pinned Tony between his legs, but Tony was wiggling around in a way that made Steve suddenly realize this was a bad idea. It seemed Tony had the same thought, because he grinned widely, deliberately slid down Steve’s body and rolled his hips just so.
“Oh, did the agents get the Thank You cards Tony and I sent for all the presents?” Steve asked, reading through the files on hand. “Sitwell? Klein? Hill? Fury?”
“No, you can’t see the cameras in our room. Let us get her to sleep first, okay?” Tony answered. “Jay, bring up the baby pics and videos from my phone. They can watch that for now.”
Clint burst out laughing which made Julia blow another raspberry and start giggling. She kept blowing raspberries, drooling everywhere, and laughing at herself in amusement. A fist was waving at Steve, as if trying to get his attention, which she already had.
“She’s having a good day today,” Steve said proudly. He held up Juliana and she cooed at the doctor. Even Dr. Axel melted at those curly hair and blue eyes.
“Good job! Yeah, you tell him!” Tony cheer-whispered. “Tell him to stop brooding and pay attention to you!”
Tony scoffed and turned away. This was their kid’s doctor, yeah, but he didn’t really feel comfortable having other people witness such a private moment.
“We’re glad you stayed a while,” Steve said, reaching out to take Juliana. She let out a displeased gurgle but was soothed when Steve bounced her gently.
“Not everything,” Steve said. “They can go up one at a time.” He cooed at Juliana. “Oh no, my darling. Calm down. We’ll probably need to burp you or change you. And then get you to bed.”
Clint raised a hand, grinning lazily. “I’m in. I’m not turning down an all-expenses paid hotel by Tony Stark.”
Steve moved, sinking down gently and gracefully onto the couch. He arranged the bundle against his chest, tucking blankets into place. Tony turned back to the bots and gave them a stern look.
(Steve was being especially patient with it. Once Julia settled into a sleep schedule, he could much more easily convince Tony to do the same.)
“Oh, definitely,” Tony said, checking his watch. “We’ve got some corporate sponsored gamers coming in to try, and you can either join them or go before them, whichever you guys wa–”
“Even though that is cute, I say to you…” Darcy let out a raspberry. “Jane and I had such good ideas too and Thor was gonna be part of it and you were gonna love it, I tell you! Love it! It was going to be epic!”
