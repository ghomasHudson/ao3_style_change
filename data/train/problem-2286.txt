John looked up slowly, his eyes filled with tears. He couldn’t remember when he had started crying but he knew it had begun in frustration and ended in fear
Sherlock searched through the different shows, until he got to Alvin. He pressed play, and then picked up the science research paper he had procured, as he was not stooping so low as to sit and watch chipmunks talk and get into trouble.
The eldest Holmes was right in his prediction, and the four of them were on their way back to the house, within the hour, all satisfied with the confessions they had got, knowing the case would be solid, and they would be convicted.
Telling himself it was only in his head, and that he had never injured himself in the first place, let alone nearly kissed John, Sherlock cleaned up the remainder of the broken cup and made his way to his bedroom. Sherlock then changed into his nightwear and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, dreaming about the situation that had just occurred.
Whilst everyone ate dinner, Greg, Mycroft and Molly chose to ignore the presence of Sherlock’s hand on John’s thigh. When Sherlock had first put his hand there, John had flinched a little bit but soon settled, despite the pinkness of his cheeks. They ate and chatted, and Rosie was happily telling the group about the inactive volcano she had seen earlier in the day. Everything finally seemed to be fine, in John’s eyes, but of course, that didn’t last for as long as he’d hoped.
After their meal, which Sherlock had been acting strange all the way through (which John shrugged off as he was thinking about their recent case), the pair left Angelo’s and began their walk to the park. On their way there, Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist, as was usual when they were walking, and pulled him close. The cold November air bit at John’s cheeks but he was warm with happiness, the smile present on his face.
"They are all mine, Papa!", Rosie grinned, causing John to chuckle. And as hard as he tried, Sherlock couldn't bring himself to scowl.
In the third week post-Eurus, Mycroft was doing better. He could get to mid-afternoon without wanting to be sick and he found himself smiling every time Greg text him a silly message, as he did half-hourly, no matter what he was doing, just to try and get a reaction out of the ice man who, unbeknownst to Greg, was slowly melting thanks to his healing. On the Wednesday, Mycroft was surprised by Greg, when he left his office. After the first week, Greg had begun appearing at his house, rather than his office, and his trying day meant that Greg had been a welcome surprise.
“It’s my house. I own it. You’re renting it off me. You lot should get out. I don’t want to see this queer display anymore. It’s disgusting.”, Oliver snorted, looking disgusted.
“Yes. It was very productive, Rosie. I hear you showed Auntie Molly all of your plant knowledge.”, Sherlock told the young girl, who was now climbing up his legs so she could sit on his lap.
As much as Sherlock protested about being made to sit and watch Harry Potter, he actually got into it. Over the next few weeks, Sherlock began to read the books to Rosie, at bed time, despite her being able to read them by herself. And he even insisted on everyone taking the Pottermore quiz, to determine which house they were all in. Sherlock got Ravenclaw (which he was pleased about). John got Gryffindor (which Sherlock seemed to think was obvious). And Rosie got Slytherin. They were only short a Hufflepuff to make the complete set, however, Sherlock suspected Molly would be a Hufflepuff.
“Well, that’s as good as it’s going to get.”, Greg chuckled, as John rolled his eyes (but he was smiling) and Sherlock and Rosie began talking quietly to each other. Mycroft was sat in the same chair he had been sat in the night before, typing ferociously on his laptop and sighing once in a while.
"That's it! Well done, Rosie!", Sherlock exclaimed, placing a kiss to the little girl’s head of curls.
"Sherlock is my brother, John. Whilst he was away, for those two years, he asked me to keep an eye on you. He even risked his undercover mission and life to meet me in Berlin, where I had a picture of you for him, upon his request. Your daughter already calls him Papa. She knows, and she isn't even two years old yet, so why are you two so oblivious to it?"
Sherlock had not felt that kind of attraction in a very long time. From the moment John Watson walked into the lab at St Barts, Sherlock knew he was in trouble. John Watson was just his type. Slightly smaller. Military. And not afraid of running head-first into danger. Things went so well, in the beginning, apart from John’s constant girlfriends. Although, Sherlock managed to chase them all away rather quickly. It was obvious to everyone, but John, how Sherlock felt. John’s insistence that he wasn’t gay always echoed around Sherlock’s mind. It was in the quieter moments in 221B, where John would be sat quietly, with the paper or his laptop, and Sherlock would be in his Mind Palace. However, Sherlock wasn’t in his Mind Palace half as much as John thought he was. He was often day-dreaming about what would happen if he just plucked up the courage to kiss John. The outcomes in his head varied, from John storming out and never coming back, to John reciprocating his feelings and the kiss and them living happily ever after.
"Rosie.", John replied simply, causing Sherlock to let out a long sigh and to bury his face in his hands.
John then made the mistake of looking up at Sherlock and nearly crumbled. Sherlock was looking at him in a way that made his knees go weak. John was glad Sherlock was holding him up, as he feared he might have fallen if he wasn’t.
“You have been able to speak six languages, practically your whole life, Rosie. Do not, for one second, think you should stop doing because other people are making fun out of you for it.”, Sherlock said.
Rosie pulled away, bringing her hand up to Sherlock's face, wiping away a tear, saying, "I’ll do what Dada does, Papa. It’s ok. All better now."
The pair then left Lestrade to go home to their daughter and sort out their small holiday in Edinburgh. They sat in the living room of 221B, with Molly, searching for hotels and babysitters as Rosie sat on the floor, playing quietly with her toys and muttering to herself.
John had always had an inclination that if Sherlock were to ever to get into a romantic relationship, then it would be with a man. John wasn't homophobic. He'd be a bit hypocritical if he was, due to him swinging both ways. He didn't get the nickname 'Three Continents Watson', when he was in the army, for no reason. He'd even been in a steady relationship with James Sholto, before his accident. John hadn't wanted to end that relationship, either. It had been James who had pulled the plug on it, as he wanted to protect John from all of the hate he was getting. However, thinking Sherlock would be with a man was one thing. Seeing him smile, laugh, and even hold hands with someone was another thing. John had come to terms with the fact, years ago, when Sherlock had jumped and left him behind, that his romantic feelings towards his best friend would never be reciprocated. And, by the time Sherlock came back, it was too late. John had Mary, whom he loved so much. She was his rock.
"Thank you for your help, John. I know I am awful to you, sometimes, but I appreciate your help when your expertise on a topic are superior to my own."
“Of course, John. There is a car outside waiting for us.”, Mycroft smiled a little, as though he had anticipated John’s pleas. Nodding, John ran upstairs and got a warmer jacket, so Sherlock could have his coat back, whilst Greg got some shoes and a jacket. They were out of the house really quickly and on their way.
“They wouldn’t let me in because I’m not family. I tried to pull rank, but it didn’t work.”, Greg told him, standing up.
When they pulled away, panting and both blushing, John rested his forehead to Sherlock’s and sighed a happy sigh.
“Greg… Third building across, with the green machinery outside.”, Daniel informed him, with a small smile, before going off to talk to one of his superiors about the plan.
"Rosie. Pick something and watch it. I am not going to keep changing what is on, so you can watch this."
After the hell of Eurus had died down, and Sherlock had explained everything to Molly, gaining an understanding from her, John and Rosie moved into Baker Street, with John not being able to afford the mortgage on his house in the suburbs and that, without Mary, the house feeling empty. Baker Street had been brought back to its former glory, after the explosion, thanks to Mycroft's hired team, who had been a massive help. However, until John moved back in, Sherlock didn't feel fully safe. The flood gates had opened when it came to Sherlock's emotions and feelings, but every time he looked at John, he felt something that he couldn't put into words. It felt like he was flying and falling all at the same time, and he knew that he would do anything for both John and Rosie.
Inside the house, the boys were hard at work, coming up with a plan that would be then passed on to the local police force so that the quartet had back-up when it came to the interrogation and arrest of the pair that had committed such an awful crime.
John smiled too, brushing the curls from Sherlock's forehead with his spare hand, before placing a small kiss to his temple and letting his friend rest.
“You’re okay. There is a slight wheeze to your breathing, but that will be because of the cold.”, John explained. Sherlock just gave him a small nod in reply, before wrapping his sheet around himself again.
“This is all my fault. Oliver would have never been able to hurt you, or Rosie, or Molly, if it wasn’t for me. It’s my fault.”, Sherlock spluttered.
“Hazel? Mix of brown and green.”, Rosie beamed, knowing she was right. Sherlock felt tears pricking his eyes and he realised he couldn’t love her more.
John got up to make a pot of tea, leaving the others in the sitting room. As he put the kettle on to boil, Mycroft entered the kitchen, and lingered by the door to the stairs.
“It isn’t your fault… Rosie. Now, I’m not angry, sweetheart, but what else did they say?”, Sherlock asked his daughter.
“Well, I shall have to talk to my husband about it, but I am sure that would be amazing. Thank you.”, Sherlock replied.
John followed Sherlock, and the way Sherlock slotted his hand into John's, they're fingers laced together, did not go unnoticed by Molly. She liked to think that she was more observant than Sherlock gave her credit for.
“I’m sure it can’t be much longer now, Sherlock.”, John tried to reassure his friend. The space they were in was only a little bigger than an aeroplane toilet, and it had been a long time that they had been stuck in there.
“That’s settled then. Why don’t we tell the Browns and the get back to the house… Molly text and asked what we were doing about food. I said take-out tonight so she said she’ll take Rosie shopping whilst we’re out tomorrow and cook for us for the rest of the time we’re here.”, Lestrade announced.
"Rosie, you have to put your wellies on, if you want to go to the park. It has been raining non-stop for the past 8 days, so it will be muddy.", John replied, getting annoyed.
“Well, I disagree, Greg… You did plenty. I don’t know anyone else who would sit awake for three nights in a row, just to make sure I slept.”
“Well, I’ve booked us on a ghost tour. Mainly to listen to you debunk it all afterwards.”, John smirked at him.
“Thank you, John… I, well… Thank you.”, Sherlock told him, pulling away slightly, to look at John’s face.
John popped out for some milk and other bits, once again, leaving Sherlock with Rosie. She was bouncing up and down on his lap, staring at his face, looking confused.
“Oh, and what did she say?”, John asked, making to stay away from Sherlock, as they had planned upstairs.
Sherlock was cautious when it came to be mentioning anything about Mary. He didn’t want to upset John or himself. And he didn’t want Rosie to associate the mention of her Mother with tears. Sherlock realised that Mary had left him the perfect family and had been happy doing so. The gratitude and love that Sherlock felt for Mary, as a result of this, was huge. She had died saving his life. She had died because he was, once again, being too smart and should have left it, but he didn’t. He had caused her death and, yet, she had been happy to leave so much to him. She had left the care of her husband and her daughter to him. Why? Sherlock couldn’t quite fathom what Mary had seen in him to spark all of the things Mary had thought about him. Or, maybe, she knew he loved her husband. Sherlock was always terrified of that. When he had come back, he had expected to pick up with John where they had left off, and jump straight back into running around London with him and maybe even exploring the feelings he had begun to feel for his best friend. Then he’d returned and it really wasn’t the case at all. John had found the love of his life. He was going to propose. It was serious. Sherlock really wanted to hate Mary but he just couldn’t bring himself to. She had healed his best friend when he had caused pain and, for that, he couldn’t have been more grateful. Plus, she was too nice not to like. That is, of course, until she shot him. Although, even then, he fully understood why Mary had done what she had done. The same way he fully understood why she had run away instead of asking for help when Ajay had been chasing after her. The protection of another life, when Rosie had come along, had changed the priorities of the trio, made up of the Watsons and the younger Holmes boy. She became the most important thing and all of their actions had consequences on that little girl’s life. The biggest being that Sherlock had not shut his big mouth, meaning that the little girl he held so dear no longer had a mother. It resonated in his mind, every time he looked at the little girl and guilt overcame him every time he heard her call him ‘Papa’. It was atrocious the feeling that he didn’t deserve the title. And everything that happened with Eurus made it worse. Rosie had nearly lost her Father too. And that was also because of him. John had forgiven him. How, he had no idea, but he felt that a small getaway to Edinburgh would clear his head a little. He had always loved that city as a boy and he loved the complex simplicity of it.
"Ah... Brother Mine. I was wondering when you'd eventually wake up.", Mycroft smirked, before taking another sip of his tea.
Two years passed, and Rosie had started primary school. Molly had given birth to a gorgeous baby boy, which she had named Scott Hamish Hooper. He was a gorgeous little thing, who John, Sherlock, Greg and Mycroft were all Godfathers of. Mycroft had seemed to take the small child under his wing, babysitting him when everyone was busy with a case, and he was just doing paperwork in his office. He would leave Anthea to pick up some extra paperwork, or he would simply have Scott in the office with him.
“In the garden. It looks as though Rosie is sharing her botanical knowledge with her favourite Auntie.”, Mycroft said, causing them all to look out of the kitchen window and watch as Rosie pointed at plants before talking animatedly at her Auntie.
“We didn’t leave her alone until bedtime. Mycroft was being particularly over-protective, which I should have thought more of but didn’t. He made sure that there was always at least one of us with her at all times. It should have rung alarm bells.”, Greg rambled.
“My fault again, I presume?”, Sherlock asked, finally turning to face John, and crossing his arms across his chest.
“That would be perfect.”, he smiled, before placing a kiss in the same place he had earlier and joining his daughter in the living room.
That morning, he had woken up to an empty flat. The night before, he and John had an argument, and Sherlock was petrified as to their future friendship. Sherlock didn’t need to ask to know that John had taken off, when he had stormed out of the flat, to the flat of his latest girlfriend. Sherlock had simply huffed, plonked himself onto the sofa and not moved until the Lestrade had text him the next morning.
“Ah, Daniel… Which building is it?”, Greg asked his fellow police officer, going into DCI mode without really realising it.
"You're too good at this now, Rosie. We'll have to come up with something else.", Sherlock smiled down at her.
“Yes. And, you are?”, he asked, confused to find someone in his office, let alone sat at his desk like the office was theirs rather than his.
“I’d like to go home.” Sebastian said, the cockiness that he had previously shown being nowhere in sight.
"Yep. Dad hasn't been bothered about them but Pa doesn't like them. And neither does Uncle Myc. It is soooooo funny. Uncle Greg finds it hilarious.", Rosie replied, with a smile.
"I can't, Sherlock... If I let you hold me then I'll have to kiss you. And then all of this will have been for nothing. You haven't been eating. You have started smoking again. Christ, Sherlock, you leaned over the desk in Greg's office the other day and I could see the vertebrae of your back through your suit jacket. Please. I love you but you need to look after yourself.", John said, before the tears began to fall and John ran out of the flat, leaving Sherlock alone, with his own tears.
"Neither did he until he met my brother.", Sherlock chuckled to himself, wanting to see the shock on John's face when he realised.
"I don't condone it, John. I don't, at all, but something does need done. Now, I think that having Sherlock on the case will be enough. There is no reason to involve Rosie. And, believe me, I have had some VERY strong words with my husband, and he is currently two days into a month's sentence of sleeping on the couch.", Greg replied, trying to calm John a little.
"Holy shit... So, you need our help?", John questioned, in shock, a little, from what he had just heard.
Sherlock, one day (about two weeks after John had come back to Baker Street), found himself with a dilemma. Greg Lestrade had called with one of the best cases he'd seen in a while, but John had taken a part time job at the surgery, and Sherlock was looking after Rosie. Molly, herself, was working, and Mrs Hudson was staying with her sister, so it left Sherlock with no choice. He strapped Rosie to his back, in the new carrier he had bought, with it being easier than pushing her around in a pram all the time and set off towards the crime scene dropping John a text.
When Greg came into Baker Street, with a grave look and his face ashen, John immediately knew that there was something very wrong. Greg, however exasperated by a case, would never look as he did.
John stood and hugged his daughter close. “Go on… Bed. We’ll talk more in the morning.” Rosie didn’t say anything. She simply picked up her bag off the floor and made her way upstairs to bed.
"Dada! Papa!", Rosie squealed, launching herself at the men, who caught her together, still looking extremely confused.
Case of the century, John! Definitely a 12 out of 10... Have Rosie with me - will leave her with an officer while I work - SH
Sherlock sighed and got up off the floor, so he could sit next to John. He sat on the bench and took a deep breath, before beginning to explain.
The service was as quiet as the first had been. Rosie, along with John and Mycroft, had given a eulogy and then she had played the violin (something her Pa had begun to teach her when she was just four years old). Everyone then piled into 221 Baker Street, which was now John’s solely (after it had been left to both him and Sherlock upon Mrs Hudson’s death a few years prior), where they ate sandwiches and exchanged stories about the great consulting detective.
Sherlock looked straight into John’s eyes, like he was trying to read what was going on in John’s head. His other hand then came up to rest on John’s cheek.
“We’re going on holiday, Rosie. Me, you, Papa and Auntie Molly. Uncle Greg will be there too. And Uncle Myc might even come.”, John told the toddler.
A few hours later, Sherlock began to come round properly, after having passed out and then been knocked out by the medication he was given.
“They, er, call me a freak because I am smarter than they are. They caught me, at lunch, reading a book I’d borrowed off Uncle Mycroft, about Aristotle and the classics. They said I was weird because I could understand the Greek.”
“Hello, little Sherlock… Now, let grandad tell you a story all about grandpa, who you’re named after. It all started with a lot of pink…”
“We can stop by the surgery for when you finish as well. Meet you and then we can walk home together. Then I can sort Rosie out whilst you get some well-deserved sleep.”
"I know. But Papa and Uncle Mycroft don't like them, so it means they won't steal them. Daddy likes them but he always asks if he can share.", Rosie explained. Molly smiled. She picked sweets she liked, but sweets that she knew Sherlock and Mycroft didn't like, so they wouldn't eat them all before she got a chance to have any. That kid was smart.
“It’s so strange… I’ve been in this situation before but not when there has been so much at stake.”, Sherlock said to John.
"You know why I refuse to play Cluedo with you Sherlock. I'm not putting myself through that again, thank you very much. Anyway... If you're bored, why don't you go and buy that milk that you said you were buying yesterday?"
“Look, I know Sherlock asked you to keep an eye on me, but I also know you well enough to know that you don’t do anything you don’t want to. I just want to know… Why?”, Mycroft asked. Over the years, having helped each other out when dealing with Sherlock, the two me had got to know each other so intimately that, in the end, Greg had known Mycroft better than he’d known himself, and vice versa.
Edward Rudy Lestrade-Holmes was 4 years old, and had just started primary school, when people began to bully him for things he didn't understand. One boy made the rest of the class laugh at him for having two dads and he didn't understand why. Growing up, Eddie had been surrounded by more homosexual couples than heterosexual ones. His Uncle Sherlock and Uncle John had always been together and his cousins, Rosie and Oliver, had never seemed to be bothered that they had two dads. It wasn't that Eddie was upset that he had two dads. In fact, he loved it. After all, his Dad was a high-ranking police officer and his Papa practically was the British government. His older sister, Morwenna Jessica Lestrade-Holmes, had never mentioned anything about being bullied for having two dads, though. So, Eddie got really upset. His Papa had seen it in his face.
"Mmm.", Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes, which set Greg and John off again. It's safe to say, they didn't get much done on the case for a good half an hour after that.
"That's where you're wrong, John. Because I may not know about the actual universe but you are my universe, and I know everything I need to about you.", Sherlock replied.
The drive to Cornwall was a long one, but well worth it. John and Sherlock shared the driving, whilst Rosie sat in the back seat, watching a film on her I-pad and staring out of the window whenever something she deemed pretty was in view. Being 6, nearly 7, Rosie was getting to an age where she was becoming more independent.
"You took your time... It seems that your child has developed a skill in arguing and manipulation. God, she is Mary's daughter.", Sherlock said.
John didn’t reply. And Sherlock didn’t say anything else. They simply sat on the bench swing, wrapped around each other. If asked, neither man could say how long they sat there for but that didn’t matter.
"You're not really that dense, John. I have loved you since I laid eyes on you. But then you went around insisting we weren't gay and that we weren't a couple. And when I came back, you had Mary. I watched on and didn't say a word because I knew you were happy."
Sherlock stood next to his daughter, so he could be seen, and said, “Hi Instagram live.”, before scuttling off to find his scarf.
“Don’t be daft, John. Come and get ready. We’ve shared a bed and we both sleep topless… I don’t mind.”, Sherlock told him, pulling his purple shirt (John’s favourite) onto his shoulders, before fastening his trousers and belt before beginning to button up his shirt.
Danny came over tonight. We watched TV for a bit and then ordered and Indian, when Dad came home. Thankful that Dad likes him. Goodnight came when Danny left at around half ten, on his motorbike. I spoke to Dad for a while longer and then we both went to bed.
Once the boys arrived home, it was all go on the dinner front. Molly had made a lasagne, from scratch, whilst Rosie napped, so John had insisted he make the salad and cook the garlic bread to go with it.
Sherlock showed up, with Rosie settled nicely in her pram, at exactly the moment he finished with his last patient. John smiled and made his way over to them, placing a kiss to Rosie’s forehead and stealing a kiss from Sherlock’s lips (which caused the detective to blush profusely). They then made their way home and, as promised, Sherlock placed a kiss on John’s forehead, once he had changed into his pyjamas and took care of Rosie whilst John went to bed. 5 hours later, when Sherlock joined him, John didn’t even stir. He slept straight through to the next day, when he was woken by soft kisses peppering his neck, just the way he liked.
“The day started alright. We went to the Capital and walked around a bit. Of course, people began to notice. I mean, she is known, what with her mediocre acting career, and I am the Prince. People know who we are. We started getting a lot of attention. Then the press showed up. As you know, the press aren’t allowed to be involved in the ceremony, as they just cause issues. Irene then decided that it would be a good time to kiss me. So, she kissed me, in front of all of the flashing cameras. I was in shock. I didn’t kiss her back. I simply stood there, rock solid and unmoving. She then dragged me into a shop, where they weren’t allowed to follow and tried to kiss me again. Except, I refused her. I couldn’t quite believe she had stooped so low. We got into a pretty heated argument, where she ended up pulling a whip from one of the displays and started to hit me with it. She was so angry, John. There was fire in her eyes and she was shouting. And I was scared. I have never been scared of anything like that before. I thought she was going to kill me. Of course, being in public, there were people standing around us with their phones out, until a woman pulled her off me, shouting at everyone for not making sense. She was so angry, John. Irene, that is. This other woman was angry too, but helped me up and asked if I was okay. I nodded and told her I was fine. And then my security team managed to get through the crowd and carried me off into one of the cars.
Mycroft Holmes was far from what he would consider as a 'nice' person, especially in a professional capacity, but his staff knew otherwise. They received thoughtful, personal gifts on their birthdays and at christmas and you would have to be blind not to see the genuine affection the man held for his younger brother. The 'Ice Man' facade scared the living daylights out of those who didn't really know him. He was a stern man, when he wanted to be, but that was so he could get results. Quickly.
“Actually, Oliver… You don’t own this house. Not anymore. I bought four off your Father, this being one of them, or did you forget that your Father sold me most of his estate, after what you did, not only to my little brother, but also to your wife. Now, I suggest you get out of MY house and if you come within 50 miles of my family ever again then, so God help me, you will not know what has hit you.”, Mycroft spat at the man, making him scoff and stand there for a second, before finally giving in and leaving the house.
“You love it, really.”, Greg chuckled, before stealing a quick kiss from his partner’s lips, once again causing him to blush wildly which made Sherlock smirk at him.
Mycroft had been working for MI6 for a long time before they moved out of River House. That, however, didn't stop pompous pricks, who thought they knew everything, from trying to undermine him. That never went well for the other person. And Mycroft didn't even need to try in those situations.
When Morwenna had been 3 years old, Mycroft had been needed at the palace. However, Greg was working and the Watson-Holmes pair were off on a private case (with Rosie and Oliver being left in the care of their godmother, Martha Hudson), which meant Mycroft had to take his daughter to the palace with him, leaving her in the capable hands of Anthea whilst he attended to business. It did not go to plan, however, as Morwenna had kicked up a fuss. Luckily, the Queen did not mind speaking to Mycroft as his daughter napped across his lap. In fact, the Queen fell in love with the little girl, which is why the Lestrade-Holmes children were often invited to go and play with the Cambridge children.
"That's true.", John said, throwing Sherlock a wink, which caused him to blush wildly, before clearing his throat. John loved the effect he had on his husband, still, after the many years. He found it adorable that Sherlock still acted like an innocent virgin. John, and a lot of other people too, knew Sherlock was far from that now.
“You will one day, Rosie. Don’t you worry… Anyway, your Papa said that you can recognise some flowers. Are there any here that you know?”, Molly asked, which distracted Rosie and Molly found that she was learning things from the young girl. Despite being so young, Rosie was able to toddle around the garden easily, chewing Molly’s ear off by reeling off the names of certain flowers in English AND Latin.
"No, Rosie. I am not so easily swayed by your cuteness as your Godmother is. You must remember... I don't do sentimentality, which is why you probably like your Aunt Molly more than you like me, but then so does everyone else, so there is no change there.", Sherlock stated, rather matter-of-factly.
"She loves you, you know, Sherlock. Last time I brought her round, she was all smiley, remember? As soon as I got her home, she went hysterical, shouting at me to bring her back. She was clean. She wasn't hungry or thirsty. She wasn't even in pain. The only valid reason is that she missed you.", John explained, stroking Rosie's hair, who had now snuggled into Sherlock's shoulder and fallen asleep.
“Mr Smith, you need to think very carefully about you say next, as we were both there to witness you pulling the knife. Not only have you been the one who has made the most impact in this case, with you leading Dickinson, you have also blatantly lied to us. We know you were the ones doing small jobs. We have you on CCTV. We know that you are the one who convinced Dickinson to approach a 14-year-old girl in Horsforth, as you have been positively identified. Also, we know you’re lying because Perry Dickinson told me everything, from start to finish. Now, if you want to continue claiming innocence, then I suggest you make yourself scarce. We have some very good contacts on Prosecution.”, Greg told the man.
“Okay, temperature first…”, John said. He moved the curls from Sherlock’s ear and placed the end of the thermometer into Sherlock’s ear hole.
“You don’t need to worry, Sherlock. It’s just me.”, John told him, as they walked up past the castle, hand in hand.
John remained in the kitchen and Rosie and Sherlock were upstairs, so it gave Molly a chance to show the other two the picture she had quickly snapped that morning, and they told her about how John had rejected an attractive blonde’s advances and then had proceeded to go straight to Sherlock’s side.
“You know, when I was your age, I was bullied for being clever too. In fact, I am still bullied now for it. But I have your Dad, and he believes that I am amazing. Rosie… You are clever. You are smart. You are beautiful. You are kind. You are caring… Promise me you’ll not change just because other, small-minded people, tell you to. You are not a freak, little bee. You are a star, yeah?”, Sherlock said.
Sherlock's lips pulled up at the corners a little, a smile threatening to break. Not one of those smiles he faked though, in front of clients and on cases. A genuine smile reserved for the best, which included his blogger, John Watson.
“I know, Mary. But only if you forgive me. I have taken your man, your daughter… I let you die.”, Sherlock told her.
Ok, but I find out that my daughter has been anywhere near any dead bodies then it will be your murder they are investigating next - JW
“Now, my love, we do damage control, release a statement to the press and then let the Prince have his day with John, on Sunday, as planned. They cannot have their day tomorrow instead. It will be too soon. Things need to settle. And I need to get injunctions in place on the press. That doesn’t mean that they can’t spend the day here, together, however.” Mycroft answered.
"Sherlock? Your phone is ringing.", John shouted from the living room. Sherlock was sat at the kitchen table with his eyes glued to his microscope.
“Sherlock, come on… Just breath and then tell me. What’s happening?”, John asked, knowing full well what was about to happen, but was giving Sherlock his moment, rather than getting over-excited before it had barely begun.
“I will always forgive you, Sherlock. Always.”, Mary smiled. Sherlock smiled in reply, and then looked to Oliver. When he glanced back at the wall, Mary had gone.
"That's Draco Malfoy, Pa. He's cute.", Rosie replied, before blushing, after realising what she had just said.
"Okay... I don't have any painkillers that you can have, so I'm going to have to clean and stitch it, and you're going to have to grit your teeth, okay?", John asked.
“No. You went out last week, drinking and doing god-knows-what, with god-knows-who. You were told you weren’t going out past 11 for two weeks. That was the agreement. Now, seeing as it only happened last week, that time frame is not over yet.”
“I don’t understand it, John. If there is one thing I hate, it is an unpunctual criminal.”, Sherlock complained.
"He's not laughing at you, don't worry. Pa just didn't know that the earth revolved around the sun until he met Dad...", Rosie assured Kitty.
“I never got to come here as a kid, what with us living in the South. We always went to Brighton.”, Sherlock told John, as they began their walk.
“Of course, I’m sure, John. I wouldn’t have said it otherwise, would I?”, Sherlock stated rolling his eyes a little.
John was sat on the sofa, with his laptop, doing some general browsing and checking things in his blog. Sherlock had taken Rosie to bed, after giving her a rather messy bath, and came back downstairs in his pyjamas and blue dressing gown, having got soaked by his daughter who thought it was hilarious to splash him. Finding that the only spare space to sit was next to John, Sherlock stalked over to the sofa and plonked himself down in a lying position, not caring that his feet were now covering John’s laptop.
“She is on anti-depressants because of a miscarriage she suffered a year ago, but she was also taking tramadol. You aren’t supposed to take them together.”
A month after that, the men both fell asleep on the sofa together. They woke up the next morning, curled around each other, with Rosie patting Sherlock on the face. Mrs Hudson had got her up, and left the boys to sleep. She knew that they had been out late on a case (and had found them adorable) so had left them to it. Things seemed to shift, after that. John would squeeze Sherlock’s shoulder as he walked past him, and sit with his arm around the back of his chair, when they were sat in the kitchen, eating.
“Well, people will be given the option of going home. I doubt Sally will stay. She has been practically vibrating with want all week to get back to work. Especially since she got pally with Seb and heard how I had treated him. I put her off a bit.”
Sherlock then picked up the last box with ease, and walked outside, leaving John alone. The rooms that surrounded him were now empty. It seemed a little strange. He'd never seen it so empty. When he had bought it, the previous owners had still lived there, so he had never seen the house without furniture.
"Let's go to bed... It's been a long few days. I just want to lie down and hold you close.", John said, pulling away and standing up.
We didn’t take Rosie trick-or-treating. There was no point. We bought her a load of sweets and chocolate ourselves. We weren’t putting her at risk for the sake of dressing up and knocking on doors.
When they got to the meeting place, just in time, there were only five other people on the tour, what with most of Edinburgh attending Fringe shows. The woman doing the tour was a short, rather plump, blonde University student, who took on the job due to her love of Stephen King novels (all told to John by Sherlock, of course). They started their tour at Greyfairs Kirkyard, in Old Town Edinburgh. The story there was of a small dog, one named Greyfairs Bobby, who guarded the grave of his dead owner for more than 10 years after his owner had died. When the dog eventually died, he was buried in the cemetery also, in a piece of land just inside the gates of the cemetery. The woman told the group of how his bark can still be heard, but they didn’t hear anything that night. They were also told of the ghost of George McKenzie, a barrister who had been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Covenanters (which Sherlock had to explain to John). The tour guide even revealed that she, herself, had been pushed over by the ghost, as many others had, as she was passing his mausoleum. Sherlock scoffed at that, until John gave him his ‘bit not good’ look, and he stopped.
“Tarragon chicken sounds good, Mol, but maybe something simpler tonight? I had a text when I went to loo. I’m needed with Greg and Mycroft. So is John, if he’s feeling up to it. After all, there will be an extra charge on Smith for the attempted murder of John.”, Sherlock told her.
The pair left a little after midnight, which left just John and Sherlock. John was sat in the living room reading the paper, and Sherlock had decided to wash up, which John was all too happy to let him do. Everything was fine until John heard a clutter and the word "Fuck" float through from the kitchen.
“Of course, he did.”, Sherlock said, rolling his eyes, but there wasn’t any malice in it, as there might have been before. The brothers really had turned a corner in their relationship. Sherrinford and the atrocities they faced together had made a bond between them. One that meant they had to stick together, or they would both fall completely apart.
“She is a teenager. It happens.”, Sherlock replied, as his fingers drew lines up and down John’s back, soothingly.
“It would be a miracle if they lasted until we got back to London.”, Greg thought to himself, before turning back to his book and letting the pair be.
“That was beautiful, Sherlock.”, John told him, later that night, after Sherlock had made full advantage of John in a new suit.
Rosie was up first the next morning, as was usual. She climbed out of her bed, in her own room, which Uncle Mycroft had made she sure she had, specially, and made her way out onto the landing. She opened the door, of the room next to her own, to find her Uncles asleep. Her Uncle Greg was lay on his back and her Uncle Mycroft had his head resting on the chest of his partner, their arms wrapped around each other. Just as quietly as she had entered, Rosie left the room and tried the next one. There she found her Auntie Molly, curled up on her side, snuggled deep into her duvet. She left her Auntie Molly, too, before trying the last door, which she knew wasn’t the bathroom, knowing it would be her Fathers room.
Sherlock looked so nervous, which made John look at him questioningly, but Sherlock just shook his head, and then they sat in a comfortable silence. All of a sudden, Sherlock stood up, directly in front of John and began pacing a little.
Sherlock made his way through the crowd of people outside to find his family by the ambulances. Molly was in one with Greg and Rosie was in the other with John. Mycroft was standing outside, so he could see what was going on with his friend and his niece.
On bonfire night, Rosie was taken to a bonfire/ firework display by her Uncles and Aunt, with her new little cousin, who she was thrilled about and never stopped talking about, leaving just John and Sherlock. They were having a date night, with a dinner and then a romantic stroll around St James’ Park. John was excited. It had been a while since it had been just the two of them, even though Rosie was a star and let them have their space when she knew that they wanted it.
“Did she now?”, Sherlock asked, giving Rosie a mock-stern stare, causing her to giggle and for her to hide behind her Auntie Molly with a grin.
"Oh, Eddie... It's because they have a Mummy and Daddy and some people don't think that two men or two women should be together.", his Dad explained, sitting on the sofa next to his Papa, and pulling him onto his knee.
“Well, Sherlock… She certainly has your bluntness, that’s for sure. You really have made an impact on her, haven’t you? To say that she isn’t actually your daughter, that is.”, Oliver commented, smirking.
“Papa. I know cars cannot really fly, but isn’t it a good story?”, Rosie said, as she bobbed up and down on Sherlock’s shoulders. They were walking from the theatre to the tube station and Sherlock had immediately pulled Rosie up onto his shoulders, as he knew she would start whining if she had to walk too far.
John tried to focus on his book but found himself reading the same sentence a hundred times because he couldn’t concentrate. Sherlock was still staring at the space where the man had been stood, no particular emotion showing on his face but he remained silent. Even Sherlock’s breathing seemed to be non-existent, like he was holding his breath.
“And you have every right to feel so. She exploited the situation, Sherlock, because of who you are. Although, I reckon, once Mycroft is done with her, she will no longer be able to find work. And as for her crazy cousin… Well, they have gone against the crown. That in itself is an imprisonable offence.”
“It’s called a fever Sherlock. You need plenty of fluids. Here, drink this.”, John told him, handing him a fresh bottle of water, that had been on the desk.
"So... Dinner with your parents.", John said to Sherlock, as he picked Rosie up from the sofa, who had woken up from her nap.
Inside the building, Rosie was crying, snuggled up to her godmother, who was trying her best not to join on the tears. Rosie had a suspected broken left arm, from what Molly could gather, and a gash to her right cheek.
"Okay, Sherlock, get some kitchen roll whilst I run and get some supplies from my bedroom. Put pressure on that wound... It is deep, and I think I'm going to have to stitch it, but I don't think it'll require A and E if we get it sorted as soon as..."
“Keep it, love. You can take me to dinner instead.”, Mycroft replied sleepily, before they shared a goodnight kiss, and they too went to sleep.
Molly began telling them what she and Rosie had been up to whilst they were out, but Mycroft was distracted by the sight of his partner, through the kitchen window. Due to the August sun, Greg had taken off his suit jacket and tie, unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt and had rolled his sleeves up to his elbows. His silver hair was messy, where he had run his hands through it in frustration, and he had one hand on his hip as he spoke, rather sternly, on the phone to whatever team was helping track the pair of criminals up the country. His shirt was well-fitting and tucked into his trousers. Mycroft smiled a little at the sight, knowing how much the man had helped him after everything that had happened in Sherrinford and at Musgrave. Mycroft never got to Musgrave. He had been kept in Sherrinford, in his sister’s cell. The blood and body of the Governor hadn’t been removed and Mycroft often found himself, in the weeks after, with his head over a toilet if he had let his mind wander and remember the smell. There was something about the smell of death. Once you smell it, you can’t get rid of it for weeks. No matter how much posh soap, anti-bacterial hand gel or times he showered, Mycroft could still smell it. Mycroft knew that Greg had lingered around his office, the next day, because Sherlock had asked him to keep an eye on him. The way that Greg invited himself into Mycroft’s house, on more than one occasion, despite (at the time) being unwelcome, was enough to show Mycroft that Greg was not going to stop. He was not going to stop slipping him sleeping tablets in his drink so he’d sleep. He was not going to stop insisting that Mycroft ate something, as he had begun to lose weight because of missing meals. And he was not going to stop showing how much he cared for him, on his own merit. He had realised, quite early on, that his brother was behind it. However, he also realised that Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade was a man who didn’t do things he was told all of the time and that he only did what he was told when he wanted to.
John leaned in and placed a soft kiss to Sherlock's lips, before resting his forehead against his husband's. "God, I couldn't love you anymore, Sherlock."
"Sherlock. No. You heard her... She wants us to be happy. So... Let's be happy.", John smiled a little, through his tears. Though it had been hard to see his dead wife in front of him, John felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
The pair then chatted about the case until they arrived in Edinburgh, where John got the luggage off the rack as Sherlock carried his daughter off the train and onto the platform, Rosie clinging tightly to his neck and singing nursery rhymes to herself happily. Lestrade and Mycroft weren’t far behind Molly, as they departed the train, Lestrade lacing his fingers through those of his boyfriend’s, causing the British government to look like he was going to crumble a little and flush wildly. Greg noticed this, of course, and leant in and kissed his cheek, just to see his partner squirm just a little bit more. It made John want to take Sherlock’s hand in his and not care about the consequences or what anyone thought, including Sherlock himself, but he found that he just couldn’t. It wasn’t until they were walking up the steps, from the station to where Mycroft had a car waiting for them all that John snapped out of his daze a little, mainly due to the hustle and bustle because the Festival was in full swing and the place was swarming with tourists. John was nervous, knowing that there were only a certain amount of bedrooms in the house that they were staying in and that Mycroft would, no doubt, try and make it so that John and Sherlock had no choice but to share a bed.
Tea was served and, still, Sherlock did not leave John’s side. They sat together on one of the sofas, with Sherlock wrapping his arm around John’s shoulder and pulling him close. He placed a kiss on John's temple and John smiled widely, not being able to hold it in.
The group had been on a holiday to a private island off the coast of Greece, where Rosie loved seeing the sea, and Molly enjoyed the break, as a new mother, where she constantly had help from people who could watch Scott for an hour or so whilst she actually slept. They had returned even closer than they’d ever been, as a unit, than they’d been before.
“Definitely, mate… We’ll have plenty of room as well. Many a time have I been stuck on a stake out, pressed up against Dimmock or Donovan in the dark in a tiny, cupboard-sized room, for hours on end. Let me tell you, Dimmock isn’t as boring as he first appears. He knows some filthy jokes.”, Lestrade told him, chuckling, making John smile a little.
"If you'd have known, then nothing would have been any different. We might have got together not long after Sherrinford, but we didn't, John. And I'm with Eric now. You wouldn't have broken it off with Mary to be with me. You loved her. You can't ask me to do that with Eric."
"Not as much of a drama queen as you, though.", he heard, not bothering to look who had just walked in because he knew who it was.
“Come on, Mol. I think we should get you to the hospital.”, Greg said, as he began to lead her away from the body.
That night, when Sherlock climbed into bed, without John, he felt the loss. He didn’t sleep a wink. And when Rosie came and crawled into bed with him, at around half five the next morning, he wept silently. Sherlock took the car to pick up John from the hospital and made sure to have his hand on the small of John’s back as they left the hospital. He also carried John’s bag for him, which seemed to surprise John a little.
Rosie had been playing the violin, like her Papa, since she was 4 years old. She had mastered Bach and was particularly fond of playing pieces of Tchaikovsky’s ballets. Sherlock had been more than happy to indulge his daughter with all of the music he could find, and they even composed together. When Sherlock and John had finally got married, when Rosie was 10, she had composed and performed the piece for their first dance, much like Sherlock had done for her Mum and Dad.
“So, it’s just a waiting game? How am I supposed to just sit and wait whist my friend and my daughter are out there with that crazed lunatic? He has already put me in hospital before… If he touches one hair on either of their heads then he will wish he never laid eyes on me in the first place.”, Sherlock ranted.
“An féidir leat an salann agus an piobar le do thoil, Scottie?”, Mycroft asked his brother, so Sherlock passed the salt and pepper over, as he’d been asked to, not batting an eyelid that he hadn’t been asked in English.
Half an hour later, Molly woke needing the toilet. She made her way to the bathroom, went to the loo and decided to check in on Rosie on her way back to her room. Molly panicked, initially, when she found Rosie’s empty bed, but noticed that her dressing gown and slippers, which they had unpacked and placed by the chair together, had gone. Molly then made her way to the room where she knew she would find her Goddaughter, and poked her head around the door, which was already slightly ajar. There she found the sweetest sight she had ever seen. The two men were asleep, their legs wrapped together under their blankets, and their hands now resting on the small sleeping form between them. Molly pulled her phone out of her dressing gown pocket and snapped a quick picture to make sure she had photographic evidence when she told Mycroft and Greg. She then left the room and headed downstairs for her first cup of tea of the day.
Unbeknownst to the boys, Greg had witnessed their conversation, from the living room door, and made sure to inform Mycroft as they lay in bed later that night.
"Screw what Billy says, Ed. He's not friends with royalty.", Morwenna told her brother, causing him to giggle and her dads to begin to chuckle a little.
John stood, shocked into silence. "Sherlock, I... I love you. You know I love you. But I had to leave you."
The two men then told the married couple a lie of how they were innocent but being accused of a horrid crime, but they did not divulge the details of that crime, as Sherlock had hoped. He had wanted them to be more elaborate but they had been boring, instead. After a few more minutes, with the criminals being none the wiser, Greg gave the nod and it was all systems go. The house descended into chaos as the two criminals realised what was happening and the Browns ran to get out of the house, as had been instructed, so they were not injured. The back-up had been called, but in the scuffle, Greg had been pinned to the floor by Perry, who had a knife, an inch above his head. Luckily, Mycroft was to hand, as he picked up the heaviest thing in his vicinity (which happened to be vase) and smacked it across the back of the man’s head, knocking him out in the process. Meanwhile, Richard also had a knife and was attacking John. Sherlock was trying to pull the man back, but he was a lot stronger, and flung Sherlock across the room, making his back smash into a wall and for him to get winded. John had quick reflexes, but the skill of the man he was fighting meant the knife was plunged right into his right arm, causing him to scream out in pain. By that time, luckily, the reinforcements were arriving and (due to unconscious Perry), Greg and Mycroft were able to restrain Richard for long enough before the other officers got to him.
"So, not only do I have to sit through this mindless drivel, my husband seems to have a crush on a teenager. Should I be worried, John?", Sherlock asked, trying to cover his annoyance with humour.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, and waited for a moment for Sherlock to wrap his arms around his waist, before he held him close.
He woke up the morning after the case, after having had to have jabs at the hospital because of the Thames being so dirty, to find he felt like someone had stuffed cotton wool up his nose and into his sinuses. He rolled over in bed a groaned, which caused him to start coughing, which led to more groaning and more coughing. He felt like hell. He wrapped himself up in his bed sheet, even though he already had his pyjamas on, and made his way, slowly, to the living room. His legs felt like lead and it felt like there was a baby elephant residing on his chest.
“I, well, I think that I am, no… I know that I am bisexual. And I have been seeing this girl. And she is amazing, and I don’t know. I didn’t want you to think that I am just a lesbian, not that there is anything wrong with that, of course, but I wanted you to know that I am bisexual and that I like boys and girls. Well, it’s like 70% girls and 30% boys, but I didn’t want you to find out from the press, or whatever, because you know what they are like for following me because of you guys and, well, I just, yeah. I am bisexual.”, Rosie babbled, turning bright red.
All the way home, as Rosie hummed to herself happily, Sherlock seemed to be a little dazed. He wasn’t sure how John would take such a request but hoped that he would allow Rosie to audition. After all, an audition didn’t mean that she would definitely get the part, right?
So, you heard that, guys, 5 minutes… Er, what have we got… Can I save the live? Yes. I can do that for you.
“Someone to care for. To be there for. I have you two. Someone to do for. Muddle through for. I have you two.”, Rosie sang happily, as she made her way down the stairs.
"Okay. I won't be long.", John said, before kissing Rosie on the cheek. Instead of leaving straight away, he also kissed Sherlock on the cheek, before taking off down the stairs, leaving Sherlock to wonder what the hell had just happened.
"Ok, so we have a family of three: father, mother and daughter. The last person to see them alive was the daughter's boyfriend. All three victims were tied to their beds, with their faces blown off - it's not pretty."
Rolling his eyes, John muttered to himself, "Always the drama queen.", before running after his taller friend, who (no doubt) had already hailed a cab - which he seemed to be very good at.
For a moment, John froze, debating on whether he should lean forwards and kiss Sherlock. He looked so beautiful in the dim light that the lamp was emitting and John couldn’t help himself. Deciding against kissing Sherlock, due to his vulnerable state, and not wanting to make things awkward, John smiled, and pulled away fully.
"John... I love you with all of my heart, and I know you love me too. But I also know you love Sherlock too. And I want you to know that it is okay. Don't let me hold you back from letting yourself be happy. You belong with him, John. He will look after you and Rosie.
What is the weirdest thing you’ve come home to? There have been many times when I have got in from school, or whatever, and there has been a passed-out client. That seems to happen a lot, but Dad is always on it. Once, when I was about 9, I think, I got home, after a day with my Uncles to find pink powder had been exploded all over the kitchen. Dad was not very happy, at all, and Pa was still washing pink powder out of his hair a week later. It got everywhere. We had to get the kitchen done…
“I’m sorry, Pa. I didn’t mean it. I love you. I am just annoyed.”, Rosie said, into Sherlock’s chest.
A moment later, John's phone began ringing, causing him to sigh. He knew who it was without even having to look at it.
She was scooped up immediately as John and Sherlock began to cry, both hugging her close and kissing her. They laughed a little out of relief, when Sherlock realised Molly was nowhere to be seen.
Before John knew it, he felt Sherlock’s hands on his cheeks, with his lips getting closer to his. John grinned, closing the gap, finally kissing Sherlock. Sherlock seemed to melt into the kiss, as John took the lead. They pulled away, breathless, and John let out a shiver.
Sherlock simply nodded, before pulling his sheet from around his shoulders, and sitting more upright so John had access to his back and front. John carefully lifted the back of Sherlock’s t-shirt and began to examine his lungs. He listened carefully, at different points of his back, before moving to Sherlock’s front. There was a slight rasp, John recognised, when Sherlock was breathing, but there didn’t seem to be any other problems.
“I would like to stay. Not because I think I have a chance with the Prince. But because John Watson is my friend and he needs a friend right now. As does the Prince. As do you all.” Molly announced, with a confidence that John hadn’t seen from her before.
"Come on... I have a friend over! No shagging!", they heard Rosie shout from the kitchen. Sherlock turned bright red, while John simply chuckled.
"I think that is the best idea you've ever had.", Sherlock smiled, before lacing his fingers through John's outstretched hand, and let himself be led into their shared bedroom.
John pulled Sherlock closer, one hand on his cheek, the other resting on his hip, and placed a soft kiss to his lips. Sherlock responded by drooping his arms across John’s shoulders, one hand burying in his hair, as he pulled him as close to him as humanly possible.
"Dad? Can we watch Harry Potter?", Rosie asked John, on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The boys didn't have a case on, and Rosie, who was 6, had finished all of her homework for that week (including a model of an animal cell).
“Come on, love… Mycroft won’t keep us in the dark for much longer. We’ll be okay. We’ll get through it.”, John said, pulling Sherlock onto the sofa, and pulling him in close, so that Sherlock ended up curled in a ball, his head resting on John’s shoulder.
Sherlock then began crying, but not understanding why. "I don't understand. I'm not sad; I'm the complete opposite. I'm overjoyed, so why am I crying?"
Coronavirus wards are resembling battlefields. And I should know. I have witnessed and worked through both.
"Of course, he did it to get one up on his new little boyfriend.", John muttered to himself, smiling slightly, due to it being such a Mycroft thing to do. He should have realised that Mycroft did nothing that didn't get him any personal gain.
“Like I said. I am an interested party. I want you to keep letting him help. However, if he is high, you must refuse him access. Put him in a cell for the night, if you must.”
"They're Rosie's. She picked them when she went shopping with Molly the other day, whilst we were out on the case.", John replied, not looking up from his laptop.
John finished his speech, and sighed, with a smile. He felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He left the front door and locked it, for the last time, before joining Sherlock next to the van.
Sherlock loses John and turns to nicotine to get him through, only to discover everything isn't as it seems...
"I was up until late, Mycroft, as you very well know, trying to console Mother. She still won't see sense, I'm afraid. No matter how many times I tell her you did it to protect us."
They looked at few more places, until they came to their last stop. Niddry Street Vaults, probably one of the most popular sites for paranormal activity in the city, according to their guide. The stories here were far more fascinating to Sherlock at the mention of Burke and Hare, and the possibility of them having stored murder victims down there. Sherlock, ever since he had been young, had been fascinated with the men who killed people and then sold them on for profit to science. It had meant that pathology came on in leaps and bounds. Sherlock was excited to talk to Molly about it. He knew she would love the history side of her incredible job.
“Well, Mummy rang and said something about a carnival, near their house, if we wanted to travel down? She said we can stay the night. Thought Rosie might enjoy it.”
They all ate dinner and then went off on their own to bed or for a walk. Sherlock simply grabbed John’s hand and led him to John’s room, with a smile. John let himself be led, excited by the fact that there were no longer have to sneak around and that he would be able to wake up next to Sherlock the next morning and not have to watch him walk away.
“Please, his brother is on the way and has asked me to stay with him. Please, he’s got no one else. Let me in. Please. I am a high-ranking police officer.” No matter how hard he tried he wasn’t allowed in.
"Okay! Thanks, Uncle Greg. Anyway, I'd better go. One of the girls is kicking off because it's her last year and she hasn't been cast as a lead. She thinks she is all that, but she can't dance for shit and she likes to think she can sing too. Her voice resembles that of a dying cat.", Rosie answered.
Sherlock walked around the girl's bedroom first, noting her open diary, where she had written about the night before. It read:
“Yes, very funny, John…”, Mycroft huffed, but his mouth did curl into a smile just enough for John to know that he secretly liked him.
“Of course, I didn’t, John. She just knows these things.”, Sherlock grinned, picking his daughter up and swinging her around.
“Okay!”, she shouted back, before sighing. She knew her Pa would know something was up with her as soon as she went downstairs, so she pocketed her phone, took a deep breath and then made her way downstairs.
“I’m starting to think that taking her on a ballet day was a bad idea.”, Sherlock muttered to his husband, causing John to chuckle.
“Dad! Say hi to my followers!”, Rosie asked John, as he walked into the kitchen, with his and Sherlock’s tea-cups.
“I was different back then… Nothing mattered as much. You did, of course but I only had you to protect then. Now I have our daughter and she’s in there, with a mad man.”, Sherlock replied, gesturing to the building in exasperation that he felt like a spare part in the proceedings.
“Do you remember when we’d left Musgrave and you’d read this to me. We’d take it in turns to play the Monster and Dr Frankenstein.”, Sherlock asked his brother, either ignoring or not noticing the way Lestrade and John had stopped looking at the books and begun watching the brothers instead.
Sherlock, however, didn’t say anything. He, instead, stood, got his coat on and left the house into the dusk. Greg smiled sympathetically at John but Sherlock leaving had just made John angry, more than anything else. They had been making progress, in his eyes. The open physical signs of affection that had been exchanged between the two, and now, upon the arrival of a handsome stranger, all of that had gone out of the window and Sherlock was acting as though John didn’t exist. Annoyed, John got up too, but headed upstairs, after saying goodnight to Greg, and got into bed. The last time he’d looked at the clock, before falling asleep was half past two in the morning, and there was no sign of Sherlock then, so he wasn’t exactly surprised to find the other side of the bed cold when he’d been woken by his alarm later that morning.
“We went to that shop… We had cans of coke and strawberry bon-bons. It was a nice day too.”, Sherlock carried on. “Anyway… I’ve been remembering more and more ever since, well… You know what.”, Sherlock explained.
“Thought you’d never ask. I’m shattered.”, John smiled, standing and pulling Sherlock up too. After a small peck to Sherlock’s lips, John then laced his fingers through his mad detective’s and led them up the stairs to bed. The pair changed for sleeping and, once John had taken his tablets and had taken his sling off, the pair climbed into bed and snuggled close, sharing one last kiss before falling asleep, both with smiles on their faces.
“Who is that?”, John asked, and it was Greg who answered as Sherlock was just sat there staring after the man who was no longer stood there.
Rosie's bottom lip then began to wobble, in an attempt to get her own way by making a scene, and crying.
"John. When are you, Sherlock and Rosamund free to come for dinner with my parents?", Mycroft asked plainly.
“Well, you didn’t bring your car. We can’t expect you to be walking to the tube station in this weather, can we now?”, Mycroft replied, with a small smile. “Besides… Consider it a thanks for helping me after, well, you know…”
They stood at the school gates, waiting, as they had got there 5 minutes early, and John engaged in a simple conversation with one of the Mum's of a girl from Rosie's class (who was clearly flirting with John but getting nowhere). She was relentless in her efforts, however. So, Sherlock simply, as the woman was talking, wrapped his arm around John's shoulder, and pulled him in closer. John threw Sherlock a questioning look, to get one of 'go with this' in reply. John simply carried on listening to the woman, who was complaining about the homework their children were being given.
Rosie spotted her Fathers first, pointed and waving, which made Molly look over in their direction, smiling. (A smile that grew even bigger when she saw that Sherlock’s arm was wrapped around his blogger’s waist). When they reached the girls, Sherlock pulled his arm away from John, just to place Rosie on his shoulders, before he pulled John back towards him. Molly pushed the empty pram, which was doubling as a luggage trolley, smiling like an idiot. Rosie was loving being so high up because she could see right down the street. A few people recognised Sherlock and John, but didn’t go up to them, due not wanting to disturb the family holiday. After a few minutes of walking, the group stopped to watch a children’s magician, who Rosie seemed to fall in love with. Where John and Molly joined in the fun, laughing at the bad jokes and showing their appreciation of skill, Sherlock stood there rolling his eyes and huffing. John elbowed him in the ribs and gave him a look, so he stopped but still stood with a scowl. After they’d begun to walk again, John spotted a stand, where they were selling tickets to a ghost tour and smiled. Whilst Sherlock went to the toilet, and Molly and Rosie were picking out souvenirs for the child’s Uncle Greg, Uncle Mycroft and Nana Hudson, John bought two tickets for a midnight walk the next day, knowing it would be even more fun to go on a ghost walk with Sherlock debunking everything that was said.
“Does that mean the competition will end? I’ll have to go home too?” John questioned, getting worried again.
"And who is Papa?", John asked. Rosie pointed at Sherlock, who immediately froze, the way he had when John had asked him to be his best man.
“No, don’t let go just yet.” Sherlock pleaded. John nodded, before placing a kiss in Sherlock’s hair and bringing one hand up to stroke at his curls.
However, Mycroft Holmes found all these things to be a welcome distraction from his work. And he was more than grateful, those few years later, when he knew he was going home to a husband who loved and cared for his brother as much as he did. And it didn't hurt that he found his husband a little too hot for public consumption and, with his husband being an officer of the law, he didn't want to commit an act of public indecency, did he? That would never do.
“Sherlock… I love you. Have done ever since you told me my life story. You’re amazing, Sherlock.”, John said, stepping closer to Sherlock, who was stood frozen to the spot.
The paramedic then climbed into the back and allowed both Sherlock and John to stay with Rosie, considering the situation. Rosie was taken to the hospital and both Rosie and Molly were out and on the mend within a week, just in time for them all to travel back to London. Due to the trying time they’d had whilst they were away, Mycroft had chartered a private jet to fly them from Edinburgh to London. Rosie was extremely excited by this and couldn’t stop thanking her Uncle Mycroft for taking her on a plane.
“Do get in, Greg… You’ll get ill.”, Mycroft insisted, before Greg got into the back of the car. He was already soaked through, by the downpour outside, as he had left his umbrella in his car, the day before.
Oh, hi Uncle Greg! He is telling me to wrap it up because they are on their way to pick us up. So, I am going to do that…”
"That's right, Rosie. Well remembered.", Sherlock smiled, the feeling of pride swelling in his chest.
“We are lucky she doesn’t suffer with travel sickness. It would have been a nightmare, if she did.” Sherlock replied, not removing his eyes from the road in front of him.
“What sort of question is that? Come here, you daft git…”, John smiled, pulling Sherlock’s arm towards him, so that he could reach to kiss him, properly this time. Sherlock smiled into the kiss, which was soft and sweet, and he revelled at the taste of John’s lips, something he had dreamed about for years.
One day, Rosie was sat at the kitchen table, with her best friend Kitty (which was short for Kathryn). They were working on a joint science project about the planets for physics, so, already, Sherlock was staying well away from them, knowing that John would only mock him for his lack of knowledge about the universe.
Mycroft Lestrade-Holmes was very good at putting the fear of God into people, especially if the situation involved his husband or children. He was a very powerful man and would not hesitate, for one second, to pull rank when he needed to.
“Well, he is just happy. Leave him be.”, John replied, as he plonked into his chair, not even bothering to remove his coat. He knew he would have to be leaving again with the hour, to cover a shift at the surgery, so he didn’t see the point.
Sherlock saw the smile that didn't quite reach John's eyes and nodded. "Of course. Take as long as you need."
“Okay, love. See you later.”, John said, before placing a kiss to Rosie’s cheek, and a chaste kiss to Sherlock’s lips, before Sherlock took Rosie’s hand and they set off to dance.
After the 'Sherrinford situation', as John Watson had poetically named it, Mycroft Holmes found himself finding comfort in the little things that Greg did to show him he wasn't only there for his younger brother. The small gifts the found themselves in Mycroft's offices in Whitehall and the Diogenes club - the cactus, the solar-powered nodding dog that was wearing a deer stalker, and even a novelty dinosaur pen holder (which Mycroft had immediately put in the place his bog-standard one). The way that Greg would just show up at his house, unannounced, with a bottle of Mycroft's favourite whiskey, despite it being extremely expensive. And the way that, whenever they saw each other, whether in a personal or professional capacity, Greg would squeeze his shoulder, or his arm, or even (on one more memorable occasion, in a meeting with the superintendent) wrap his arm around the back of the chair Mycroft was sat in.
“Yes, Greg… It’s perfect. There aren’t any windows so they won’t see us from outside when they arrive. There are also secret alcoves to hide in, behind the bookcases, if they decide they need to do a search when they arrive. It’s also close enough to the living room to be able to hear what’s going on. And, as you said… We have plenty in here to keep us occupied.”, Sherlock agreed.
"Well, he is smart, kind, and he loves me. He is good with Rosie. He gets on with Mycroft and Greg. He is just, well, he is perfect, really.", Sherlock replied.
Once it was on, and he was satisfied that Rosie was going to sit nicely, on his lap, and watch it, he turned his attentions back to the research paper.
Mycroft glanced over at his brother and his flat-mate and nudged his partner’s foot, that was on top of his, to get his attention. Greg looked up at Mycroft, with a questioning look, before Mycroft gestured over to the sofa with his head, where Greg looked to find Sherlock practically lay across John. Greg looked back at Mycroft and smiled, knowing that he was going to lose £20. They weren’t going to last until after Christmas.
“Obviously.”, Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes, just to get an elbow in his ribs from his husband.
To anyone watching, they had the perfect family unit, but to many looked like John and Sherlock were a couple. Lestrade watched on from a distance with a smile, needing to talk to Sherlock, but not wanting to disturb their family moment. Lestrade, instead, turned away and called his partner to tell him all about it. But, knowing Mycroft, he probably already knew.
The group left in the kitchen fell back into their normal rhythm, with Greg offering to do the washing up, leaving Molly to call an early night, saying it was her turn for bath and bed duty with Rosie, despite her looking after her during the day. That left Sherlock and John to sit quietly in the living room, the pair taking up the armchairs by the window.
“Now, now, my Rose… Don’t go telling people that I am nice. I have a reputation to uphold.”, Mycroft joked, smiling at his niece.
“Look, gentlemen… I know this isn’t easy, but you can put in a complaint to the board, if you deem it necessary.”, Mrs Laniston said.
"If you don't mind, Sherlock, I am trying to do something here, and you pacing and huffing is seriously starting to piss me off.", John told him.
"Please, Unc Lock.", she pleaded, pulling her cutest face, that always won over her Godmother, Molly.
They travelled to Sherlock’s parent’s house, and made the most of the carnival, with John winning a stuffed pirate, for Sherlock, and Sherlock winning a goldfish, for Rosie, which was named Bob, and would be travelling back to London with them. John was so unbelievably grateful for Sherlock and it was that day, at the carnival, that John took out a ring box, got down on one knee, and asked Sherlock to marry him. The detective cried – actually cried – tears of joy as he accepted, and the pair celebrated whilst Sherlock’s parents looked after Rosie.
“You had just lost your wife, John and had been left to look after a small child alone. And you’re you, John. I have done terrible things to you, that you have forgiven me for, and I will always forgive you.”, Sherlock explained.
As they were singing, Oliver, who had disappeared long before Molly had come around from slumber to find herself where she was, with Rosie hurt, and crying over her, came into the room. Molly pulled the little girl right into her chest and Rosie clung on for dear life.
"A motorbike drove at you. Purposely, it seems. Mycroft has it all under control, though. Rosie is fine. A little shaken, but she isn't hurt.", John replied.
John taped up the last box, that was to go back to Baker Street, and sighed. He was excited to get back to Baker Street, and begin a new era with his best friend, but the house he was stood in held many memories. It had been his home with Mary and she was everywhere in the house. Each room held something else that John remembered fondly about his wife. And, equally, every room held memories he'd rather forget.
“I know… I don’t know why. I feel like it will hit me all at once. Right now, it feels like he’s going to come flouncing out of your room, clad in his pyjamas and blue dressing gown, and plonk himself in his armchair.”
Once the girl had finished, she picked up the piece of paper, and presented it to her Fathers proudly.
"There is a lot of dancing in this show, so once I've learned to choreography, would you help me?", Rosie questioned.
Well, happy wedding day to me. Sherlock and I were supposed to be getting married this month, but with the restrictions, we decided to wait until we could have everyone there. So, it looks as though we’ll be getting married in 2025, at this rate. Mycroft is working his arse off, trying to whip the government into shape. I just hope they start listening to him soon.
“Just call me Sherlock, Harry. And yes. Today has been a weird one. I just want to thank you, again, for helping me.”
"I kept thinking... What if? I had dreams that I'd failed again. That you had lost Rosie. That we had lost her. That it was Rosie who was lay there, lifeless, and slashed to bits, not that poor little soul. I mean, 5, John. She was 5. In 5 years of life, what could a child possibly have done to deserve something like that? She was only 5.", Sherlock babbled, letting his thoughts out, as John just sat and listened to him.
“I am sent to bid you come into dinner.”, Oliver said, with a fake smile, the quote from Much Ado About Nothing (one of Sherlock’s favourite Shakespeare plays during his uni days) not going unnoticed by the detective.
Sherlock Holmes, being used to not sleeping as much as John anyway, was still babbling about this and that as he followed John up the stairs to their flat.
"Thank you, John, but she really is a smart child, anyway. She just needed that extra little bit of encouragement. Now, Rosie... How about we show Dada what we learnt today, huh?", Sherlock asked the young girl.
“I broke up with her because I realised that if continue to ignore how we feel about each other then we’re not going to get anywhere.”
Once they got to the station, the four men were treated like royalty. Mycroft was treated like a God with the Superintendent scurrying around him and practically yapping at his ankles like a chihuahua. Once they got to a conference room, a team was briefed, and Sherlock came to life. Telling them, along with his brother and Lestrade, what to expect and what was going to happen. They were to be stationed 10 streets away. When they heard from the boys that the pair had arrived, they would then move in closer, until it was time to pounce. They had been warned that they had been armed and that they would most likely still be armed. John sat and watched how Sherlock demanded attention just by being there. He smiled. He knew that he wasn’t needed in all of this. He knew that he was just there because that’s where he always was. By Sherlock’s side as he ran around being brilliant. A female officer had tried flirting with him, commenting on how much she loved his blog, making sure to mention how heroic she thought he was. Greg was talking to a group of four officers at the time, and Sherlock was staring straight at the woman, not glaring, but definitely watching her. He smiled a little, however, when her face fell and John moved away from her, and sat next to Sherlock, wrapping his arm around the back of his chair, brushing his hand across his back as he did so. It did not go unnoticed by the other two, although they gave each other a look after that they’d discuss it later, as they were in the middle of a huge triple-murder investigation and that exact moment was not the time for Mycroft to pull out his ‘I told you so’ card which Greg always found a little bit too hot for public consumption.
"So, you didn't think that the universe was important but you remembered by favourite crisps and what size jumper I wore, long before we were even best friends?", John asked, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's shoulders while the taller man's wrapped around the ex-soldier's waist.
“Right. That is that sorted then. I will be able to fund it, with it being police business.”, Lestrade said.
“What are you doing here? I don’t like you.”, Rosie said, still frowning at the man, her arms crossed. No one knew how to react.
They walked in a comfortable silence, until they got to the roundabout, before they looped back, and walked down the side, where the shops were.
Sherlock pressed play and Mary appeared on the screen, smiling. A tear ran down John's face at the sight of her and he clung onto Sherlock's hand a little tighter.
“I know. But I also knew that if he thought Dickinson had cracked then he would tell us everything. Dickinson has already told officers that he is sorry and that he has done it. It won’t be as difficult to get a full confession out of him.”, Greg told him.
The next few moments seemed to happen in slow motion. They were stood at a crossing, waiting for the green man to show, when a motor bike veered off the road, straight into Sherlock, nearly dragging Rosie with him. Luckily, he had managed to push her out of the way. Knowing she was only a street away from the surgery, she ran as fast as she could, as tears streamed down her face.
“I told you to be careful… Being plunged into the icy waters of the Thames will do this to you, Sherlock.”, John said.
“We just don’t know how she died.”, Greg told Sherlock, as he looked around the room, they had found the body in.
They then got changed into their night clothes and snuggled down into the duvet and fell asleep peacefully, without having to worry about Rosie or Molly or a case. They could just enjoy each other.
"Yes.", Sherlock replied, as he began to pack his experiment away. He knew the rules. No experiments when Rosie was awake. That left him the times, at night, when Rosie was in bed and the times, during the day, when Rosie was napping.
When they got back to the house, John was confused to find the lights on downstairs, with it being extremely late, and going on for two in the morning.
"Rosie, I am not arguing with you... You are going to watch what you asked to watch, which was Peppa Pig. You can't keep changing your mind."
“Is now the time to mention that both Mycroft and I are fluent in French too?”, Greg said, glaring at Oliver.
“I didn’t find you. I dreamed that I didn’t get there in time and you drowned… I watched it happen, John. I lost you too. Rosie lost you too. I failed. Again. I failed to save another Watson.”, Sherlock blurted out, talking quickly and trying to control his breathing.
The three of them tucked into a breakfast of eggs and bacon with toast, accompanied by a glass juice each (and some pain killers for John). Once they had finished, Rosie toddled off to find her Auntie Molly, leaving the boys to themselves for a moment.
Sherlock was not there he got back, but John wasn’t expecting him to be. Due to the nature of the case, John knew very little about it. In fact, he wasn’t really needed at all. He sat for around half an hour, looking at the TV in the corner of the room, which was switched on, but he wasn’t really watching it. He then got a phone call.
“I was just saying how Greg seems to be more chipper now he and Mycroft are living together. It was bad enough when they first got together. Now they are living together, it is insufferable.”
anniversary of my dads getting married! So exciting. I am going to stay with my Uncle Myc and Uncle Greg later, so they can celebrate properly because, let’s face it, I don’t want to hear that.”
“That’s true. And, whilst there aren’t any little ears listening in, I wanted to tell you all something. So, I’ve decided that I want a baby and I have been undergoing IVF with a sperm donor. When I told you, Sherlock, that I’d been having a bad day, when you called, it is because I had been informed that it hadn’t worked. But I wanted to make sure… This time it did and I’m 9 weeks pregnant.”, Molly smiled.
“Thanks.”, John said, his hand finding Sherlock’s, as it had done earlier, before they followed the intruder into their family to the table.
“She’s heard and seen worse. And it isn’t me that she’s heard and seen it from, Sherlock.”, John replied.
Her eyebrows still knitted, Rosie began to say, “The Earth is part of a solar system which resides in the galaxy called the Milky Way. We’re the third planet from the sun. I haven’t learned all of the names yet but I know that Mercury is the closest to the sun, and that it’s smaller than the Earth.”
John rolled his eyes and chuckled a little at Sherlock’s dramatics. “You’ll be fine in a few days. You’ve just got to ride it out. I’ll pop out in a bit and pick up some stuff that will help. I’ll get you drinking honey and lemon and you will be eating simple things like soup. I’ll just go and get my thermometer so I can check your temperature.”
"And my brother suggested his niece... How familial of him. Well, you can tell him, Greg, it isn't happening.", Sherlock spat.
“Ladies and gentlemen… As you may now know, an issue arose today. It has been dealt with and Irene Adler will no longer be a member of the competition. It is now time for you all to decide whether you would like to stay here until the week is over, or whether you go home. As you have probably gathered, the Prince has made his choice already. That doesn’t mean that you are not welcome here, however. I would like you all to step forward, now, and tell us your decision. Sebastian… We will start with you.” the Queen announced.
"Why not... Thai, Chinese or Italian?", Sherlock replied, before John got up off the sofa, to grab a handful of menus and his phone.
“Really, really.”, Sherlock replied, before pulling John down into a soft kiss that quickly escalated into more as John moved so that he was now straddling Sherlock.
"Sherlock... Stay with me. Please. Come on. Sherlock!", John urged, but Sherlock slipped into unconsciousness.
"But you promised me you wouldn't. Are you back on the drugs too?", John asked, folding his arms, looking angry.
Greg broke down, ushering the pair inside, as Sherlock and John clung to each other, also beginning to cry.
"Sarah, call an ambulance? Take me to him, Rosie.", John ordered, before following his daughter, in a jog, to where Sherlock was splayed out on the floor, groaning and bleeding out.
"Give Rosie my love. And both be her parents. Sherlock, be her Father. Look after my little girl for me, please. Be there for them both because I can't. Remember me. I love you all.
What was I looking at? My Dad and Pa are having a moment. Would show you but, you know… Some things have to stay private. Anyway… Keep an eye on my story for any pictures, throughout the day. It was lovely talking to you all. Have a great #johnlockday, for those mega-fans that celebrate it, and I’ll talk to you soon. Bye!”
"Thank you, Rosie.", Sherlock smiled, amazed at how erudite the little girl was, with being only 21 months old.
John Watson was annoyed. Massively so. Sherlock had decided to give dating a try and had become an item with a lab technician, who worked at the University of London. John tried to be happy. He really did. But couldn't find himself to be. Rosie, although she seemed irritated at first, had taken to Eric. She even went to the park with him and Sherlock, when John had taken an extra shift at the surgery, due to them being short-staffed.
On one particular day, John had graciously offered his services at the surgery, due to them being short-staffed, so that left Sherlock with Rosie, as Mrs Hudson was away and Molly was working but was due to finish around lunch time.
Molly Hooper had accepted, a long time ago, that Sherlock Holmes was never going to see her in the same way she saw him. His beautiful eyes that seemed to change colour and twist into patterns, with his sharp cheek bones, masses of curly hair, and gorgeous cupid-bow lips. She knew she had to move on. She had tried online dating, which had been an absolute disaster (especially that one date where she had to text her friend, Meena, an SOS). Online dating was definitely not for her. She had tried the whole spinster life too, doing what she wanted, when she wanted, and not caring. However, she did care, which was a problem.
“Well, I thought we could have a family breakfast in bed. You’re still not 100% John and won’t be for a while yet, and Rosie was all too willing to help out.”, Sherlock replied, climbing on the bed next to John, before helping Rosie up too.
As they came up to the gates, John pulled Sherlock to the side and said, “Behave, Sherlock.” John placed a quick kiss to Sherlock’s lips, before grabbing his hand and pulling him into the school grounds. Rosie was there, sitting in her classroom. John and Sherlock had opted for an early appointment, with a teacher, meaning that they could speak to her and then take Rosie home, so they didn’t have to go back and forth between the school and home.
Rosie looked over to where her Uncle had appeared in the garden, with the strange man she had met at dinner, and frowned.
"Claire is in on it. She monitors me. She would have known if I had told you. I wasn't allowed to tell anyone. You will die, Sherlock. They will kill you. I'd rather have you in my life a little bit than not at all. I tried that once. It didn't exactly go very well.", John explained, more calmly than thought he'd manage to.
“It’s alright, love. I know he doesn’t pose a threat. I trust you.”, John told him, as he sat up properly, so he was upright on the blanket.
“I’m surprised you remember that, Sherlock. You seemed to have got rid of your teenage years.”, Mycroft said, a little shock present in his voice.
"Well then, in that case... The game is on.", Sherlock stated before beginning to bound down the stairs, his coat billowing out behind him.
“We met at Uni. I was doing Chemistry, obviously, and he was studying marine biology. He didn’t make fun of me like everyone else did, and found my quirks fascinating, rather than irritating. We were friends at first until, one night, after being in the labs until late, he kissed me. We were together for a year and a half… Things changed, though. He got some new friends and started doing drugs. I took them too, to keep him happy and with me. I think I thought that he would leave me if I didn’t do what he was. He then got in trouble with the police, and Mycroft stepped in. I had always known that Mycroft didn’t like him, but he never said anything until then. In the two weeks I didn’t see him, he got married to a childhood friend. His mother had been involved, it would seem, as she wanted him to clean his act up. The drugs were already there, so I turned to them as comfort. The last time I saw Oli… Well, things didn’t go well. He’d started hitting me after a year and I’d let it happen because I was in love with him. The last time I saw him, I confronted him. He was married, by that time, so I knew I’d nothing else left to lose. He beat me so hard that I had to be operated on. I never saw him again.”, Sherlock explained.
It’s just been announced. We’ll be into a third lockdown from the start of January. And it looks as though it will take us through to March. Not looking forwards to this.
"Of course. I wouldn't miss it for the world.", he smiled, jumping up from his chair and pulling his coat on, over his jumper.
“Brother Mine, John, my love… They’re being held near Scottish Parliament. Well, near Arthur’s Seat, really. There is a team on their way there now.”, Mycroft informed them.
The rain battered at his office windows, as Greg tried to concentrate on his final report of the day, before he could go home. Home wasn’t an exciting place. It was a small two bedroom flat, where he lived alone, apart from the mould that reared his head, every once in a while, in the corner of his living room ceiling. It was a Friday. The weather wasn’t going to get any better, over the weekend, so his plan to go for a run was out of the question. That meant he was stuck inside his flat all day for two whole days, trying to fight the mind-numbing boredom with a book, or a film, or a TV series he had been too busy to watch when it has first aired. He thought, for a moment, about asking John to the pub, but then remembered that John, Sherlock and Rosie were visiting Sherlock’s parents for the weekend, at their cottage. They wanted to make the most of having another little girl in the family. John and Sherlock weren’t a couple, but Greg could see that it would only be a matter of time before they would be. After all, after the issues on Sherrinford, John had moved back into Baker Street, with his daughter, and the crime-fighting duo went back to doing what they did best – chasing criminals through the streets of London. Sherlock had asked him to keep an eye on his brother for him, and he had, but not to the extent that he had liked to, due to having to work so much.
Sherlock had broken the news, that they had found Victor, to Victor's parents. It was the hardest thing he had ever done - even harder than leaving John behind for two years whilst he tracked down and put a stop to Moriarty's criminal network. John had been there for him, that day. He didn't say anything. He didn't need to. He was just there. Sherlock was more than grateful for his support. Things had been that way ever since John had broken down in front of Sherlock. In that moment, John needed him, and as Sherlock pulled him close, he knew that their support for each other ran deep.
"I’m clever. That’s why, Dada.", she beamed, a cheeky grin showing a hint of Mary's sarcastic nature.
When Mycroft arrived, Greg was sat on the floor, against the wall, opposite the door to ICU, waiting.
After Sherinnford, when John had moved back into Baker Street with Rosie, John thought that things would, maybe, progress and that they would end up in a relationship of sorts. That didn't happen, however.
“What about the whole Moriarty and bomb situation?”, John asked him, knowing that keeping Sherlock talking was the best thing to do, so that he didn’t storm into the building and make the situation worse.
Mycroft immediately aided his brother towards the injured man just as the paramedics were tending to John.
“I’m sure the gentlemen know that, dear… No need for your bad language. We always knew that it’d only be a matter of time before he was back in prison. He has already served a two-year sentence for assault, you see… And, well… My Janie was in love and nothing we, or anyone else, said could have stopped her from marrying that man. If we hadn’t have agreed, they’d have eloped anyway and we preferred to keep them close, if there was nothing to stop them, so we could keep an eye on them.”, Mrs Brown explained.
“Stop the press, people. We have a corker… Sherlock Holmes has called Greg Lestrade a genius.”, John commented, chuckling, causing Greg to also chuckle and for the Holmes boys to smile a little.
John smiled at the text, before turning his attention to the TV, his eyes drifting every couple of minutes to check on Sherlock.
“I believe we call that One – all, Sherlock.”, Greg chuckled, making both John and Mycroft blush even deeper as Sherlock joined in his chuckling.
Things were all fine. Until Eurus. John was his rock throughout it all and Sherlock only felt like he could face it all because of his presence. When he had told Mycroft that John was family, he meant it. John Watson was his everything. Mycroft had known of his brother’s feelings towards the ex-army doctor, but hadn’t quite realised the full extent of it until he had seen John Watson’s small smile, as Sherlock barked that he was family, to him. It was then that Mycroft Holmes knew that John Watson felt the same way. And that made him feel even worse, for having kept so much from Sherlock for so long.
“I’m not stupid, Sherlock. I can see it is hurting you more than you are letting on. Anyone would be affected by it. You’re allowed to not be okay, you know.”
John picked up his little girl and carried her down the stairs, where he found Sherlock fully clothed and sat reading that morning’s paper, drinking a coffee.
Anyhow, all was calm. The time came for Rosie to be picked up from school and John was surprised when Sherlock got his coat on and joined him on the school run. Usually, Sherlock only joined John on a Tuesday and Thursday, if he wasn't occupied with a case. And it was a Wednesday. Sherlock didn't bring it up, however, so John didn't either. They simply walked together, in a comfortable silence, the twenty minutes that it took to get to Rosie's primary school.
However important his work was to him, Mycroft Holmes, in more recent years, found his attention being divided. A certain divorced, silver-haired Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard had caught his eye years before, when said officer was still married. The way that Greg Lestrade had dropped everything and had cared, unconditionally, for his brother made Mycroft's heart skip a beat. Mycroft had only ever dreamed of finding someone who cared for his brother as nearly as much as he did himself. And Greg had proven that after only the second time of meeting the young consulting detective. He stayed by his hospital bed, along with Mycroft, having felt something that meant he couldn't bring himself to walk away from the young drug addict. And Greg admired, greatly, how much Mycroft did and cared for his younger brother and was only too eager to help. Greg hated seeing Sherlock throw away his talent and beautiful mind. And it helped that Greg found Mycroft's presence and company a little too nice. Not that he would have ever admitted that to the eldest Holmes at the the time, however.
"Papa is happy now, Dada. Don’t you worry. He’s not crying no – I mean any- more.", Rosie explained to her father, John noticing how much her speech had come along after leaving her with Sherlock whilst he was working so much.
John then left the room and made his way up the stairs to grab his stuff. He came back down with a digital thermometer and his stethoscope around his neck.
“I know, sweetheart, so am I. I’m sorry. Please don’t worry. Dada and Papa and Uncle Greg and Uncle Mycroft will come and save us. They always do.”, Molly said aloud, more as a comfort to herself than Rosie, who saw her Dads and Uncles as superheroes.
“Really, Greg. It’s nothing. I mean, it’s the least I can do. Just sorry I couldn’t help more by being on the post-mortems. Rosie is an angel and I’m happy to look after her.”, she smiled.
Does he currently have a case on? He doesn’t as he doesn’t take cases around anniversaries and birthdays, so he is there for them… He did finish one two days ago, I think, which will probably be up on Dad’s blog soon. Hey, Dad?”
“At least 10 minutes. If they think we’re onto them, they’ll expect to be ambushed within the first five minutes upon their arrival. We have to let them think they’ve won and then jump out at them when they least expect it.”, Sherlock said.
"Fine. I'll put them on.", Rosie huffed, rolling her eyes. She certainly had become her Papa's daughter, in the way she was a drama queen.
Sherlock was a little mortified, at first, when Rosie said she was auditioning for the lead role in her school production. It's not that he wasn't proud of her but he knew that, if she did get it, then he would have to go and watch her in whatever drivel she was performing in. He had never liked musical theatre, which was why Mycroft ended up being dragged to the theatre with their parents, whenever they came to London to catch a show. However, for the sake of his goddaughter, he was willing to put his thoughts about musical theatre to one side to support her. It didn't mean he had to like it, though.
"Oh, Sherlock...", John sighed, before lacing his fingers through Sherlock's curls, pulling him into a soft kiss. Sherlock reciprocated gladly, happy to forget the horrid thoughts and dreams. He let John take the lead, letting himself get lost in the kiss, as his thoughts melted away until all he could think was 'John'.
The week, by all accounts, was a success, even if there were a few touch and go moments between the brothers. However, each had their partner to pull them away or rein them in a little, when needed. Rosie loved spending the week with her Grandparents and Uncle Greg, who was already her favourite Uncle. Rosie went up by millions of miles, in her love for him, it seemed. Greg had been a star, armed with a bucket and spade, and dressed in his long swimming trunks and an old t-shirt, as they played on the beach. One more memorable moment, which had been caught on camera, was when Greg and Rosie had buried Mycroft’s feet whilst he slept in the sun. Sherlock was never going to let him forget it, that’s for sure. And a copy of that picture, where Mycroft was still asleep, buried under the sand, and Rosie was stood next to him, with her spade, and a massive grin on her face, found itself a space on Greg’s office desk at the Yard.
“I promise, Rosie, that I will not grill your girlfriend, if it means your Dad gets his dream of meeting his future daughter-in-law.”
"I'm so sorry, John... She died because of me and now I'm taking you and Rosie away from her...", Sherlock sputtered.
Ten years later, when Rosie had got married and had given birth to a gorgeous son, which she named after her Pa, John held his grandson close, and smiled.
Sherlock just nodded in reply, still putting pressure on his wound, as he has been previously ordered to by the army doctor. John got to work, taking Sherlock's hand in his, and pulling away the bloody kitchen roll, before getting some anti-sceptic and cleaning the wound. Sherlock hissed in pain, but made no verbal complaint, as he would have done previously. John cleaned up the wound and then immediately started stitching it.
“No, Molly… You just saved my little girl’s life. And he was trying to kill you and your unborn child. It was self-defence.”, Sherlock told her, rubbing her back soothingly.
“I’ve not finished, Dada. Alkali metals: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Alkaline earth metals: beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. I’m finished now, Dada. You can clap if you like.”, Rosie grinned.
"Okay, Rosie... Pick which sweets you would like, sweetheart.", Molly said to her goddaughter. They were out food shopping, as Sherlock and John were off on a case and Mrs Hudson was visiting her sister.
"That's a good point. I mean, there is evidence that the daughter was raped, as well. I got the results just before I came up here.", Greg added.
“Tu m’as beaucoup manqué, mon amour. J’aurais aimé que nous ne soyons jamais séparés.”, Oliver said, staring at Sherlock longingly.
"You have eyes, John. Even you can see that it is, indeed, what I am doing.", Sherlock replied, before taking another drag.
Her engagement with Tom was the longest relationship she had been in since her university days, and she was all too glad when it was over. Tom was beyond nice. His parents were lovely, and he had a dog that they walked at weekends, before stopping off for a pub lunch. It was nice. But it wasn't Molly. The only thing she missed about him was the sex. He might have been quite boring but, my God, she could never have said that he wasn't good in bed. He was a sex fiend.
John didn’t realise how difficult it would be to get his family, their belongings and the dog into the car, especially when his daughter was extremely excited to be staying by the sea for a week, and his husband was grumbling because they were going to be staying with the rest of the Holmes clan, which included Mycroft and his now-husband, Greg. John was looking forward to a week away from the city and a week of free childcare, if he had the chance. Greg was also looking forward to it because he loved spending time with his niece and his in-laws. Mycroft had a similar outlook to the holiday as his younger brother. He was dreading being under the same roof as his meddling mother for a week. He knew the question of grandchildren was likely to come up again, and that Violet would ask when Mycroft and Greg would be adding another Holmes to the family line.
The two men then pulled away from each other and climbed into the front of the van. Sherlock took the driver's side, as John slid himself into the passenger seat.
"This case, John, it's... I can't even begin to describe how sick these bastards are.", Greg sighed, sitting on the sofa, burying his head in his hands.
It was nearing four o’clock in the afternoon by the time the four men were pulling up outside the house, in the hire car. On the way back, Sherlock had pestered his older brother (and had then used blackmail by threatening to show Greg his baby photos) so that he was on a promise that he could drive the car the next day. John was glad of this as it meant he would be able to ride in the front, something he had not done for years, properly, due to his constant jumping in and out of the back of taxis.
From that day on, they were the first port of call for each other, for anything Sherlock related. Greg had thrown Sherlock in a cell, on more than one occasion, and Mycroft would be the one to bail him out. He’d turn up in his suit, despite the early hours (sometimes) and then take his brother home to his house. When Sherlock had been forced into rehab by his older brother, one hot, summer night, Mycroft showed up at the Yard, to tell Greg. That was the first time Greg saw Mycroft cry. Greg shut the door to his office, making sure the blinds were shut on all of the windows, looking in, and then held the elder Holmes as he sobbed. Things were never quite the same after that. The rest, they say, is history.
“He is my ex-boyfriend, John.”, Sherlock said, with a shaky breath, examining John’s face for his reaction.
"Oh, John...", Sherlock sighed, moving towards John, to pull him into his arms. However, John took a step back.
He climbed up the stairs and took one last look around the top floor of the house. He smiled as he reached Rosie's room, remembering the day that he, Mary and Sherlock had spent painting and putting together furniture. The arguments had been monumental. Yet, so had the laughs. He remembered that day fondly. He then made his peace with the upstairs of the house and descended the stairs again, taking one last round of the rooms downstairs, before ending up back in the living room for the last time.
“Yes. It was fun. I like the garden.”, she told him, bringing her hedgehog into her chest and laying her head on her Papa’s chest.
“I’m due my annual leave. In fact, I haven’t had it for six years, so my bosses are practically begging me to take the time off. I could come up to Edinburgh with you and look after Rosie. I mean, she knows me so it’s better than getting someone she doesn’t know. And it means some poor student, looking for an extra bit of cash, doesn’t have to go through the scrutiny of having Sherlock break down their life bit by bit.”, Molly suggested.
“Rosie adores Mycroft and you know it, Sherlock. And he adores her too. There is nothing to worry about.”
The pair left the house not even five minutes after and began to walk towards the castle. Due to the crowds, Sherlock found himself reaching for John, once they got closer, wrapping his arm around his waist and pulling him close, but also making sure to not hurt John’s arm in the process. John smiled massively at the gesture and didn’t move away or make a fuss.
If anyone noticed the way that their touches lingered, or that their lips seemed particularly swollen, they didn’t say anything. However, Greg did think it was about time those two sorted themselves out and grinned at the thought that only those two would finally get it together whilst on a stake-out.
“She really did that? Well done, Rosie… I am so proud.”, Sherlock said, picking Rosie up and spinning her around.
Rosie took up her usual position on one end of the sofa, whilst Sherlock and John sat next to her. John pulled the blanket down off the back and threw it over them all, before they settled down and watched the film.
Once John put his medical supplies away, he got his coat and shoes on, and even borrowed Sherlock’s scarf, before venturing out to the shops, promising Sherlock he wouldn’t be gone long. He picked up some chicken soup, some honey and lemon, some throat lozenges and a bottle of cough syrup, before making his way home.
"John. You stay with Sherlock and get him seen to. I'll take Rosie and make sure she is safe. Keep me updated.", Mycroft said. John simply nodded, and clung to Sherlock, as he watched his daughter climb into the back of the car with the man, still distraught. John knew she'd be safe with Mycroft, which meant he could focus on worrying about Sherlock.
Two years after Mary's passing, John and Rosie had moved into Baker Street and everything seemed well. That is, until, one day, the post came. John opened it to reveal a DVD and knew, immediately, who it was from.
“Yes… We’re getting there with it. She had a slight problem with the pronunciation of some of them. They confused her for ages. She has even read that animal book to me today. I helped, of course, but she managed pretty well without much prompting.”, Sherlock explained.
“This will be resumed at the earliest convenience.”, Sherlock said quickly, before running into action, leaving John to pull himself together for a moment, before joining the case once again, with a smile on his face.
“It did hurt a bit. I’m okay, though. No permanent damage. And I made sure that security got that woman’s details.”
Rolling his eyes, with a smile, Greg then placed a kiss to Rosie’s cheek, which caused her to giggle with excitement, a sight that made even Oliver smile.
Their perfect, little family had been through so much. In that moment, and for many moments after, they were together, and they were safe. And as for their future… Well. They can fight anything. They’re the Baker Street Boys. And, after all, whatever the future throws at them, it is what it is.
“You always have been good at characters, Mycroft. You used to do the local vet, Mr Chinnery… Except you used to pretend that he blew up animals. You kept me entertained for hours with that when Mummy was teaching and Dad was doing whatever office job he had at the time.”, Sherlock recalled.
John was often out on cases, with Sherlock, so he called upon the help of Molly and Mrs Hudson, to babysit when he knew they were going to be home late. Both women didn't object, of course, because Rosie was a dream to look after but John hated leaving her all the same. Often, if Molly was working, Mrs Hudson would have Rosie during the day and then Molly would take over. Sometimes, even if John was not chasing Sherlock around the streets of London, Molly would often visit Baker Street when John was there with Rosie.
“You know what he’s like… It could be anything.”, John replied, biting the inside of his cheeks to try and stop himself from laughing.
“Please stay with him, Gregory. I’ll be with you shortly.”, Mycroft replied, before hanging up and leaving Greg stood on the corridor. Greg tried to get into to ICU to be with Sherlock but was not allowed due to him not being immediate family.
"Billy made everyone laugh at me because I have two dads, Papa, and I don't understand why.", he admitted.
“Sherlock? We’ll get them back. We have to get them back… Please. Look at me.”, John said, still crying and cupping Sherlock’s cheeks, looking him in the eyes. His beautiful eyes were scared and full of fear.
"Well, thank you for the apology. It's just... You know, for a highly intelligent man, you can be thick sometimes. Sure, you know a vast amount about science and history and the happenings of the world, but if you don't treat people with respect, Sherlock, all of that other stuff means nothing. I love you, Sherlock... You're my best friend, and I wouldn't change you for the world. I just, sometimes, wish you'd think before doing things that are going to affect others."
“What about the in-laws? Will they be able to act normal enough for them to think they’re home and dry?”, John asked.
"Thank you, John. I love you too. Unconditionally.", Sherlock replied, allowing the corners of his mouth to betray him and show a small smile.
"Sherlock... Don't you think that after the year we have had, as a family, that this needs to occur?"
“I’ll go, John. Someone needs to stay with Rosie. Plus, it’ll be heaving. It’s the Edinburgh Fringe. It’ll be crawling with tourists.”
As John lay in bed that night, after a nice family dinner out, he couldn't help but think about the way Sherlock had come to his rescue.
"Sherlock, can I ask you something?", John asked, when it was just the two of them once evening, after Rosie had gone to bed.
As they got closer, the person turned around, tears streaming down their face, their hair strewn and covered in gashes and bruises that had already begun forming. It was Molly.
Sherlock observed the simplicity of the entry, but noted that when the boyfriend left, the family were still alive, and that there were no clashes with the father and the boyfriend not getting on. Sherlock looked around the rest of the rooms of the house, noting how the phone lines had been cut, and how there were three mobile phones smashed to pieces in the kitchen bin. This was no ordinary murder, as any idiot could see, but what Sherlock could also see was that the murderer was not known to the area or the family - perhaps working on a tip off of some kind.
John smiled a little at Sherlock’s reply, before taking himself off upstairs to get the things he needed for a shower, whilst Rosie listened as Sherlock began to pick up where he’d left off on the book they were reading: The Hobbit. He even did all of the voices. Rosie loved it when her Dada got involved too and he read in as Bilbo whilst her Papa read the dragon Smaug.
“Your eyes tell the truth, Papa. Your face says one thing but your eyes say another. Dada is the same. I know this because I can see it, Papa.”, Rosie explained.
“I’m always right, dear… It’s how this works.”, Mycroft smiled, before pecking his partner’s lips and heading upstairs to put his laptop away safely.
"Can we play our Shakespeare game whilst we walk?", Rosie asked, as Sherlock shut the front door behind them.
Sherlock was getting irritable, by the sixth hour. They had traced a smuggling ring to a group of warehouses, down by the Thames, and were waiting on any movement. Sherlock had figured out that they were likely to move that night, and there was him, John and Greg and his team, all spaced around the complex, waiting for something to happen.
“Indeed.”, Mycroft said, looking a little forlorn at the mention of Sherrinford and Eurus. Greg must have noticed as he didn’t say anything, but he put his hand on Mycroft’s thigh and gave it a squeeze before leaving it there for the rest of the fairly short drive. After the short conversation, everyone seemed to drift into their own little worlds.
John listened to Sherlock’s story, crying as he did so, due to how much pain Sherlock must have been in, mentally, physically and emotionally.
“Fish and chips?”, Sherlock asked, gesturing at a small fish shop, on the corner of the road they’d just crossed.
“Please tell me again, Gregory, dear, why coming away with my little brother was a good idea…”, Mycroft groaned to his boyfriend.
Not going to lie, guys... Breeders kinda inspired this one. For those of you who don't know it's a comedy/drama that was co-created by Martin Freeman. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. It's phenomenal. It's now on my 'Can't Sleep? Watch this...' list... Anyway... Yeah. Enjoy!
“I have something to tell you.”, she said, not looking up from where she had fixed her gaze at her hands in her lap.
“Can we sing our song?”, Rosie asked Molly, which surprised her a little. It had been something that Molly used to do when Rosie was very small – sing to her.
Sherlock bought me a new watch for Valentines Day. It is engraved. On the back it says, “It is what it is”. I love it. He also bought some flowers. He has become a little soppy old man. I think the staying in doors has got to him in more ways than he might have thought.
Molly put her phone away and got on with some work, quietly. About half an hour later, a certain Army doctor appeared.
“It’s not your fault, John. I just… I don’t know. Today has been strange.” Sherlock replied, holding on tighter.
She was sat against the wall, not too far away, her knees pulled up to her chest casually. She was wearing what she always did. Her jeans. Her grey top. Her blazer. Her white trainers.
“Wow, Rosie… You are a little star. That’s brilliant! Why don’t you go and show Uncle Mycroft and Uncle Greg? I think they’re in the kitchen with Auntie Molly.”, John beamed, as Sherlock grinned so widely his face starred to hurt.
Sherlock and Rosie were still talking to each other in hushed tones, as John finally entered the flat to put away the milk in the fridge.
Oooo, this is good one from KrisAliteron. Shag, Marry, Avoid… Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy… Well, we all know I am the biggest simp for Draco Malfoy, so I would definitely marry him. I would probably say I’d shag Harry, because he is the chosen one and it would be cool to brag about, which means I would have to kill Ron, which is sad. I like Ron…”
Due to Sherlock opting to take Rosie to a matinee performance, it was still light outside, and Rosie had to rush to get her ballet things, once they were back home, as she still had her ballet class that evening.
“It is just that, well, Rosie told us all about your trip to the theatre this afternoon, and well, I know that they are doing auditions for a new batch of urchin children, in two weeks. I can get all of the information for you, if you think that is something that Rosie would love? She is fully capable. She can sing. And she can certainly dance well enough.”
“Of course, he will, darling. Everything will be okay.”, Sherlock said, trying to convince himself at the same time.
So, as you all know, we are now in a national lockdown. Rosie, of course, is too young to fully understand what is going on but understands that we have to stay inside. Mycroft has been kind enough to set up a food delivery for us, so we don’t even need to go out shopping. Sherlock, of course, is sulking. He doesn’t like the fact that the amount of police has been limited on crime scenes and that he isn’t getting a look in. Luckily, I have some masks, from my doctor days, so we wear them when we go out. Hoping it becomes mandatory for everyone to be wearing them soon.
That night, it felt weird as Sherlock led John into his room, after putting Rosie to bed upstairs. Sherlock sat down on the edge of his bed, pulled John down onto his lap and nuzzled his face into John’s neck, making John smile.
“Well, that sounds ominous. What’s wrong?”, her Dad asked, trying to be light-hearted about the situation. Sherlock, however, sat, watching his daughter, with worry. She was never like this. Her body language was all wrong and she looked as though she was ready to burst into tears.
Oliver sat at the table, directly opposite Sherlock, which did not go unnoticed by John, but he\ didn’t say anything. It was Greg’s turn for Rosie mealtime patrol, as was agreed prior to the trip to give both Molly and the Baker Street Boys a break once in a while.
The walk to the school was 20 minutes and, with it being a clear night, was actually rather enjoyable. It was enjoyable for John, at least. Usually, at pick up time, when they would make the walk together, Sherlock would hold John’s hand, their fingers laced together, or Sherlock would wrap an arm around John’s shoulder, pulling him close. That didn’t happen. Sherlock was in a strop.
"Then it is Rosie who saved my life, it seems...", Sherlock replied. "I'm tired...", he added, closing his eyes again.
“We fully understand, Mrs Brown. Now, may we look around, in order to find the best place to stake out?”, Mycroft asked.
Sherlock had been too angry with the man to speak and was using all of his will power to stop himself from reaching over the desk and nutting the man who had hurt John Watson. Mycroft kept his poker face but made a mental note to tell Greg, in explicit detail, how attractive he was when he was in charge of a situation. By that time, due to the long amount of time, John was sat with a cup of coffee, sipping at it and trying to keep his arm comfortable. John appreciated how good Greg was at his job and was grateful it was not just Sherlock in that room with Smith, as he was sure that Smith would be having his face rearranged.
The sight he found upon entry to the flat was not on he had ever expected to see. For one, Rosie was asleep, which he even found difficult to achieve. Sherlock was sat on the sofa, slumped slighty, snoring quietly, with a certain Molly Hooper, also asleep, sat next to him, curled up into his side, with her head resting on his shoulder. Rosie was lay across both of her godparents, with her head on Molly's lap and her legs splayed across Sherlock's lap. Not wanting to spoil the quiet, John just stood in the doorway, watching the tranquillity, and smiled. He even took a picture and sent it to Lestrade, for good measure. The good thing about sending it to Lestrade meant that Mycroft would also see it. Ever since Lestrade's promise to keep an eye on Mycroft, after Eurus, to Sherlock, the two men seemed to never be out of each other's company. And, although they didn't tell anyone, even John had noticed them holding hands under the table at a dinner at the Holmes', which had been attended by John, Rosie, Molly and Sherlock, as well as Lestrade and Mycroft.
“She didn’t hurt you, did she? When she was hitting you? I can’t believe that people just stood around and watched her do it. Thank God for that one woman who stopped it.”
“Of course, my dear. We shall be glad to have you for as long as you’ll oblige us with your company.” the Queen replied, with a smile.
"Give us a minute... We had an argument about wellies.", John told him, placing a kiss to Sherlock's brow, before getting himself and their daughter ready to leave.
The four of them walked a little further, until Rosie began falling asleep on Sherlock’s shoulders, slumping so that she was using the top of her Papa’s head as a pillow. Sherlock carefully brought Rosie down and placed the young girl in her pram, and the three agreed to take her back to the house, where she could nap peacefully.
“I trust that these children have been dealt with accordingly.”, Sherlock said, sternly, immediately glad that John had dragged him along, so that he had heard this news first-hand.
“Awww… You two. You’re going to make me cry. Anyway, I will leave you to it. All my love to both of you and I’d better see you on Sunday.”
A week before John and Rosie were due to move back in, Sherlock woke up to find Mycroft in his living room, already drinking a cup of tea, which Sherlock figured had come from Mrs Hudson.
When they had finished eating, they began walking again, until they found themselves opposite the tower, once more. The lights had been put on, and the tower was lit up like a Christmas tree. John looked at up at it, smiling. He turned his head to find Sherlock looking at him.
John made himself a cup of coffee, needing the caffeine to wake him up a little and then sat in his chair, enjoying the peace and quiet, which rarely ever graced the rooms of 221B Baker Street. After around 20 minutes, Rosie began to stir, so John quietly picked her up off her godparents and wrote them a note, to say he'd gone home and took Rosie with him, leaving it on the coffee table in front of the sleeping pair. John was able to leave 221B without too much fuss from his daughter, due to her still being fairly sleepy, and made his way home (despite being tired) with a huge smile on his face.
"As ever, John, your ability to point out the obvious astounds me.", Sherlock replied, just as his phone seemed to become more persistent and it seemed that whoever was ringing was not going to give up.
Upon arriving, it was all systems go. Mycroft and John stood in the viewing space, just off the interview room of Richard Smith, as he bullshitted about how it had all been Perry and how he was a victim of circumstance as he was easily manipulated. Mycroft watched with a perfect poker face, which John figured he would need in his line of work, but John found himself getting extremely annoyed. Sherlock, after about 40 minutes, brought up the fact that John had been stabbed and Smith, once again, tried to claim innocence and say that John was the one who had pulled the knife on him, and he had accidentally stabbed him whilst trying to tackle it off him.
“What? Who was it?” John asked. Sherlock didn’t reply. He simply just showed the name on his phone to John, who gasped, his eyes wide, as he dove to get his own phone.“Harriet Watson! You have some explaining to do, this time.” John shouted down the phone, with a huge grin.
Someone clearing their throat, however, caused them to pull apart and look up to find Mycroft and Oliver.
"But that's stupid. Rosie and Ollie have two dads. It doesn't mean that we have less love or care because we don't have a Mummy.", Eddie replied.
“Yeah… Bed sounds good.”, Sherlock replied, before placing his hand in John’s, letting it linger for a moment longer than was deemed normal, before pulling his hand away and heading out of the living room and up the stairs. Sighing, John shook his head to himself, before picking up his laptop and following Sherlock to their bedroom.
“If you stop looking at me like a lost puppy, John, then I will consider it, but I will be picking the baby-sitter. I’m not leaving my daughter with just anyone.”, Sherlock answered.
“Don’t worry, John… I know your arm is uncomfortable, but this won’t take much longer. I’d say 20 minutes, at the most.”, Mycroft smiled.
“So, you’ve said… I think you need to apologise to your Dad too, now, don’t you?”, Sherlock asked, as Rosie sat up. She nodded a little before climbing off his lap and going to stand in front of John, who was sat in his armchair.
Molly dominated the conversation, making everyone laugh with stories of children that she taught and the antics they got up to. One story in particular, about a little girl called Rosie, made them laugh. Rosie was a character. She was as good as gold but bossy and was only 6. She walked around with an air of authority and never got bullied and was friends with everyone, especially those who were not confident.
“In that case, I’ll make sure they can have her. Although, due to the new development in our relationship, they will be probably all too eager to let us go on a ‘date’ of sorts.”, Sherlock also smirked, before leaning over and capturing John’s lips softly. John moaned soft in content, before he pulled away and the pair began to get ready for the day.
"So... You two are as thick as thieves. Did anything interesting happen whilst I was away?", John asked.
John stood at the top of the sand dunes and smiled, as his breathed in the sea air. He loved the smell of the sea. The small town they were in, on the west coast of Northern England, was adorable. It was near Blackpool, which was famous for its Illuminations, but far enough away to be separate, and a little quieter. Sherlock had taken the case due to it being an interesting one. John had encouraged it, in the hope that the case would be solved quickly, and they could make a small holiday out of it. With it being September, all the children had gone back to school, but the weather was still warm enough to enjoy the sea front. John was slightly upset that they’d have to leave Rosie in London, under the care of her Uncle Mycroft, so she could attend school, as he knew she would love it.
Dinner then passed by seemingly alright, and there were no more incidents from Oliver, who was whisked away from the table as soon as he had finished eating and taken to the office by Mycroft.
“Well the woman, Margaret Brown, was an actress so we have no issues there. The only problem we have is the father-in-law, Ken… He should be alright with it, but he is appalled by what has happened and does not want anything to do with Richard. However, the pair never really did see eye to eye, so I’m hoping that his reluctance to talk to Richard will stay in the bounds of their normal relationship. After all, it’s Richard that raped the poor girl. We got the DNA results on the way up here.”, Mycroft explained.
"Please, John. I just need to be close to you, in every possible way. I can't stand the thought of ever being apart from you right now. Rosie is safe, with Molly, so we have the flat to ourselves.", Sherlock explained a little, looking into John's eyes. John saw the raw emotion there and nearly cried.
Two days later, Sherlock was in the kitchen, and Rosie was colouring, sat on the floor in between the armchairs, whilst John updated his blog.
“Dad! That’s gross. I’m 17. You don’t need to give me a top-up on the birds and the bees, thank you very much.”, Rosie squealed, turning bright red.
“They are Richard Smith and Perry Dickinson. Both ex-convicts, as I said. They weren’t associated with each other, though, until after they both served their time. They are currently working their way through the North of England, doing small jobs to get them by. We think it’s them who are doing them, anyway. We got a tip off. Someone who was in prison with Dickinson. He told them they had been given this job, and he decided to actually report it.”, Lestrade informed them.
"You mean to say that Mycroft Holmes was willing to put our daughter at risk?! Greg... How could you even condone that?", John asked, extreme anger flooding through his body.
“Already going on a date and it hasn’t been 24 hours… Took me ages to get him to realise I was flirting.”, Greg said.
Will I sing again? Well, I am currently in the middle of rehearsals for a play at my drama academy, which I am looking forwards to, but there is no singing in it, unfortunately. I don’t know. I might do a video and post it, if that is something you guys want to see…
“She would be proud of you both, Harry. After all, if it wasn’t for you intervening, I could have been really hurt. And none of this would have happened if I had been. Everyone would have been sent home and that would have been that.”
"That is an eye, Rosie. We use them to see. We have two eyes. They send the image we are seeing to our brain where it translates it so we know what we are looking at."
"No, I won't. I know, Sherlock. I know what you're thinking, and you need to stop.", John told the detective.
I know. And John is too blind to see it. Must have been to do with his latest missus. John missed a date last week. Completely forgot about it, in fact, because he was running around with Sherlock -GL
Unbeknownst to the pair, John had witnessed the whole exchange between his daughter and his best friend, and knew that he was falling for Sherlock, hard. Before Sherlock went away for two years, John always thought that there could have been something, but then he met Mary and he fell in love with her, but he would always love Sherlock too. Other girlfriends had seen it. Everyone had, in fact, but John insisted upon their friendship being completely platonic, anytime it was mentioned. Now, after everything they had been through in the previous year and a half, John felt like the luckiest man alive. For starters, Sherlock had forgiven him when John had beaten him to a pulp, something that John still felt extremely guilty about. He'd also not judged him for talking to that other woman, which turned out to be his sister, behind Mary's back. Sherlock had gone through hell to get John back, and he had still supported him, donning the phrase 'it is what it is'. This, now, was perfect. He was back at Baker Street, and his best friend, whom he loved with every part of him, was as besotted with his child as he was. John knew that Sherlock and Mary got on like a house on fire, even going on cases together and leaving John to look after Rosie. In a way, that made it even harder for John, knowing he could have had with Sherlock what he had with Mary, but that it was too late. John had blamed Sherlock for Mary's death, Mary had taken a bullet for him, knowing that John would pick Sherlock over her, if he was made to choose, and it was easier to blame Sherlock than himself. He regretted it. Of course, he did. Sherlock had forgiven him so easily, and it showed John that Sherlock cared for him greatly, even if he had gone through pain, loneliness and mourning whilst trying to bring John back to him. John, at the time, hadn't even considered the possibility of Sherlock mourning, but it was obvious, really. Sherlock and Mary had become friends, and she had offered up her life so that he would live. Having someone do that for you couldn't be easy to come to terms with, after all. It showed true friendship and love for a person, because she was willing to do that for Sherlock.
“Very true… Only way to cope.”, Lestrade grinned, a slight sadness in his eyes. Of course, John had seen atrocities like you wouldn’t believe whilst in the army. He barely stopped to think about some of the things Lestrade had dealt with in his time on the force. Things like that change a man, which John knew all too well and he knew Lestrade had seen things that he would never forget, just as he had.
"Sherlock... You'd better see this.", John called through to their shared bedroom. It hadn't been long since they had, finally, admitted their feelings for one another, and it had been going really well. John didn't want the arrival of the new disc to put a spanner in the works.
John ran to his room, grabbed his supplies, and quickly made his way back to the kitchen, to sort out the mess that Sherlock's hand was in.
After an hour, or so, of comfortable silence, with John finishing his online shopping, and Sherlock slipping into his mind palace, Sherlock's phone lit up, with a phone call from Lestrade. John didn't need to hear the conversation to know that Sherlock was being offered a case, due to the look on Sherlock's face. As soon as he got off the phone, Sherlock ran to get his coat, scarf and gloves.
The house was gorgeous and even had a garden that Rosie could run around safely in. The little girl was so excited to see so much grass next to the house, what with her only usually being able to run around on the rare occasion that her Dad and Papa took her to the park, or sometimes her Auntie Molly and even, on one more memorable occasion, her Uncle Mycroft (who had even let her share an ice cream and feed the ducks and squirrels). Despite being so young, Rosie was definitely intellectually advanced in years. She could read simple words. And could chat your ear off if you weren’t too careful, usually about what she could see, or what she’d had for dinner, or who she had spent the day with whilst her Fathers were racing around London solving crimes.
We had a semi-normal day, today. We took Rosie to the park, where she ran around for hours, and had an ice cream and then came home. It was nice. Luckily, Sherlock hasn’t got any long-term illnesses after having corona, but he does seem to get breathless quicker now. He gave up smoking again, luckily, as well. He had to when he had corona because he couldn’t face smoking on top of not being able to breathe anyway. So, in a way, some good has come out of him having it.
"Why would I be mad? I was going to ask if you'd adopt Rosie, anyway. I mean, so we could co-parent. She has already lost her mum, and she needs someone if anything happens to me. It makes sense for it to be you.", John explained.
“Well, I think it’s safe to say, Sherlock. You’re a better man than I ever could be. It’s one of the reasons I love you.”, John smiled.
"You saved my little girl's life, Sherlock. Our little girl's life. She told me that you pushed her out of the way.", John replied.
“Yours change colour, Rosie. When you’re feeling sad or unhappy, they look greener. And when you’re happy and smiley, they look browner. But most of the time they look hazel coloured.”, Sherlock told her.
“Okay, love.”, Sherlock said, with a small smile. He loved how affectionate his partner when he was tired. He knew, however, how irritable he could also be, so it was best to stay on his good side, when he was feeling that way.
Working 12 hour shifts in a hospital, in full PPE, is not something I ever thought I would have to do again. It’s so hard. And people are breaking the rules constantly and I feel like screaming at them. The people on the wards I am working on are so ill. They are dying. It is heart-breaking. I just hope this will be all sorted soon. Everyone is getting bored of it, but it doesn’t mean we can slack off. I am just hoping I don’t get it and take it home. I don’t want Rosie to get this. Or Sherlock. I have seen him nearly dying in a hospital bed too many times already. I don’t want to see it again.
“I love you too, Sherlock. This week won’t be so bad, you know. And you can always go for a walk if it gets too much, either on your own, or I’ll come with you. It’s not like we are going to be short of people to look after Rosie for an hour or so.”
"Well, I promised you Angelo's before my last case, and we haven't been yet, so we're going tonight.", Sherlock replied.
Sherlock pulled back slightly, before pulling John up with him, allowing the shorter man to straddle his lap. John felt Sherlock's arms wrap themselves across his back tightly and let himself let out a sigh of content. Sherlock wasn't an overly affectionate person. John knew that better than anyone else. So, when his partner allowed him in, John clung to every second of it. Sherlock buried his face into John's neck once again, placing light kisses just above the man's collar.
Pacing. He was pacing from the kitchen, right past John, to his chair, and back again. It was doing John's head in. Sherlock had just finished a case, a little over two hours before, and was already huffing and complaining because he didn't have another. John was trying to do some online shopping, in light that he had very little clothing, due to Sherlock using it in his experiments to test different materials. Sherlock huffed, as he passed John, and that was the final straw.
Mycroft and Greg sat in the front of the car, watching as John sat in the back, scowling to himself. Greg felt bad. He knew that Mycroft knew what he was doing but, at that moment, it seemed to be doing more harm than good. John had already been through so much but, and this pain was unnecessary. John wasn’t stupid. Greg knew that. And he knew that he would be making assumptions as to who Oliver was and would probably be right in those assumptions.  It was clear that Sherlock and Oliver had history. That issue, however, was put to one side in Greg’s mind as the car stopped, a few streets away from the house of the Brown’s, and they got out to walk the rest of the way. As they walked, Mycroft laced his fingers through his, and Greg felt guilty. Not because he didn’t enjoy it, but because he knew that John would see and that it would make him feel worse.
“I know, Sherlock. Now, come on, or we’ll be late…”, John urged, practically pushing Sherlock out of the door, as he shoved his coat and arms into his arms.
John then sat there with a grin, until he heard the door go, about 20 minutes later. Sherlock entered the room with his usual grace and gave John a smile.
"My Baker Street Boys... If you have received this, then it has been a while. And, knowing you two, I knew you'd both be back in Baker Street, together, where you both belong. I just wanted to say... I know. And it's okay. If you haven't already, you both need to admit your feelings for each other.
Sherlock didn’t reply. He simply helped himself to his experiments and set up on the work bench in the corner. He then began his work, in silence, with his back turned to Molly. Molly watched him for a moment, as he looked through a microscope. She was worried about him. Despite her own feelings towards him, which she knew would never be requited, she knew that John meant a lot to Sherlock. The fact that he was brooding in the corner of her lab, way before the body for the case he was on was due to come in, wasn’t good. She knew Sherlock. He was heartbroken.
“I’m afraid I realised all too late, my love.”, Sherlock told him, bringing their joint hands to his mouth and kissing the back of John’s lightly.
“I love you too.”, Sherlock grinned, before kissing John softly and then pulling away to watch his daughter’s chest move up and down, so he knew she was definitely breathing.
"I am going to try, John. I can't promise it'll happen straight away, but I can try. And, erm... You're a good man too, John.", Sherlock smiled, a rare, genuine smile, and John knew that was all he was going to get, in means  of Sherlock acknowledging their friendship, but he also knew that saying those words was a huge deal for Sherlock. And, for that, John couldn't be anymore grateful.
“She told us that you had a bed picnic for breakfast because Papa wanted to impress and kiss Dada again.”, Greg smiled.
That left John sat in his armchair, feeling empty and full at the same time, as tears rolled down his face. They had wasted years by not confessing to each other and John felt like he had now missed his chance with Sherlock. He just hoped he hadn't.
“No. That’s okay. She starts secondary school in September, anyhow. And she is going to somewhere that specialises in gifted children. My brother set up a fund for her, so she could go, for her fifth birthday.”, Sherlock replied.
“Okay… So, John. My John Watson. A few years ago, on this day, I thought I was going to lose you. I’d had two years, on the run, away from you. I’d just got you back and then I thought I was going to lose you again. I think Mary had always known. I wanted to hate her, but couldn’t, and we became friends. Our love for you meant we found a friendship and platonic love for each other. I shot a man to save her. Well, I must admit my motives were slightly more selfish because I knew that I’d be saving you and the unborn Rosie by doing so. Then, everything happened in a flash… Rosie was born. And she grew so quickly. We lost Mary. I wanted to die. But you saved me again, despite really wanting to at the time. Then Eurus… Hell. Once again. The one constant, for years now, John, had been you. Just you. People come and go; people who want to hurt us, or you, or me, or all of us. You’re always there. I know things have been crazy and will always be crazy, but it is what it is, yeah? And what it is, is ours. Always. And forever. Me and you together. The Detective and His Blogger. So, John Hamish Watson, will you marry me?”, Sherlock asked, getting down on one knee and producing a ring.
"Hmm...", Sherlock simply hummed, before placing a kiss to his partner's cheek and sitting in his armchair.
"Oh, so you didn't stop and think, for a second, that burning half of my wardrobe would be an inconvenience to me?", John near-shouted. Before Sherlock replied, he carried on, "Of course you didn't, Sherlock, because I'm not important. If you inconvenience those around you, it doesn't matter. As long as what you're doing doesn't impact you in any way."
“Well, she has a broken arm. A gash on her face, which won’t need stitches. And, she has two broken fingers, on the same side as her broken arm. And three suspected cracked ribs.”, John told Sherlock.
“Really? Let’s see then…”, Sherlock grinned, putting his daughter down, so she could lead them to where she had been writing at the coffee table in the living room.
“Yes… I love you, John. I have for a long time.”, Sherlock admitted, bowing his head slightly, expecting to be shot down or friend zoned.
On John’s part, he seemed to be slightly reluctant to be near Sherlock at first, still annoyed slightly for Sherlock running away at the sight of the mystery man. That soon changed though as John realised how much Sherlock had been there for him, through this ordeal. Also due to the fact that he nearly left Sherlock on his own. He thought he was going to die, in fact. But, luckily, the wound wasn’t as deep as he’d thought. The shit hit the fan, once again, however, when the pair got back to the house and found Oliver sat in the living room, drinking a cup of tea. Sherlock immediately pulled his hand away from John and left the room, leaving John stood there, in pain and discomfort (not just because of his arm). He gave the man a tight-lipped smile and left the room too. He went upstairs to find Sherlock sat on the bed, staring at the wall.
“Greg? Why are you out here?”, Mycroft asked. He was wearing a three-piece black suit, with a bow tie. It was clear that he had just left something important to be with his brother.
When he re-entered the kitchen, Molly had finished talking and Mycroft was recalling some story, or other, and Greg smiled at John, who realised that the smile meant he had some good news, and that Molly had been right.
“Uncle Greg and Uncle Mycroft are here?” Rosie asked, with excitement in her eyes. She loved both men, but loved spending time with her Uncle Greg, who took every opportunity to spoil her.
"No, Rosie. You'll ruin them. You either put your wellies on or we don't go to the park at all.", John told her.
“You do?” Sherlock asked, pulling away, his eyes damp from the tears he had finally let out whilst in John’s embrace.
When John re-entered the flat, Sherlock was still lay on the sofa, with the blanket from the back of his chair wrapped around him too. John could barely see anything of Sherlock. He could just see his mop of curls poking out from the blanket mound, as he dozed. The image made John smile a little. Sherlock looked calm in his sleep. It was rare that Sherlock ever looked so serene. John put the shopping away, before making sure there was an extra bottle of water for Sherlock, on the coffee table, for when he woke up. He then sat and put the TV on, quietly, as his friend slept soundly. He felt glad that he was there, in order to look after Sherlock. His job as a GP finally coming in handy, to deal with post-case issues. He did know one thing, however. He knew that Sherlock wouldn’t be as keen to go near any icy water for a while and that he would learn his lesson. It was the first time John had ever seen Sherlock with so much as a sniffle, and he knew Sherlock was not happy about being ill.
“About 2 hours, little bee. You have a nap, if you want. Or Daddy can help you put another film on.”
"Then you need to put your wellies on. Are you going to put them on without kicking off, or are we going to sit inside all day?", John asked his daughter.
“I think I am going to take her to the park today. Feed the ducks. It’ll be nice to get a bit of fresh air.”
“If he realised that we were there, he will now be making this into a race.” Sherlock told John, as he adjusted the driver’s seat again, as it was his turn to drive for a bit.
“Well, I love you too.”, John smiled, causing Sherlock’s head to snap up, and for him to stare at John in shock.
"I know... That's what I said.", John chuckled, as he came into the kitchen, to make another cup of tea.
“Mycroft, please. Right, I need to get this seen to.”, Greg nodded and then was left alone on the corridor whilst the eldest Holmes went to see how his brother was.
“We have to go down to the Yard today… Something about the case. Molly has the day off and has agreed to have Rosie. She’ll be here in half an hour, so if you want to get ready, I’ll feed and clothe Rosie while you sort yourself out.”
"Rosie has been able to recite the whole of the periodic table since she was 3. A bit of homework doesn't do her any harm, right, love?", Sherlock smiled.
“Well, I had to do something. People were just standing there letting it happen. I couldn’t do that. Especially when it was my potential future in-law that it was happening to. Is he okay?”
Greg looked as though he was about to hit him square in the nose, and Rosie had taken refuge with her Fathers and her Auntie Molly (who was stood protectively in front of the men and young girl despite her being pregnant).
“Oh, Molly… Of course, I haven’t. You’re both still alive.”, Oliver smirked, coming further into the light, to reveal the wrench in his hand.
"I didn't even know Shrek was a musical...", Greg said, as he picked up the report he had been working on, before Rosie had rang.
The day that John moved back into Baker Street was the probably the best day Sherlock had experienced in a while. Sherlock helped John unpack the few boxes he had, and kept Rosie entertained with a game of knee bouncing and tickling whilst John sorted his and Rosie's clothes into the wardrobe of his old room.
“Yes, I rather enjoyed that. It certainly beat writing essay after essay for school.”, Mycroft said.
“So, we need to be in the house today, preferably, to see where we can hide. We expect that they’ll arrive sometime on Thursday afternoon, so that gives us the rest of today to scope out where we hide in the house, and a day to get to know the local force and get them up to speed with what is going on here.”, Lestrade said.
The first time they met was directly after Sherlock had turned up to a crime scene. Sherlock was off his tits on drugs (which drugs, Greg didn’t know, but he was sky high). He was on a case where a woman had died of hypothermia in a sauna and it was baffling everyone. That is until Sherlock Holmes appeared and told him what had happened and how. It didn’t make sense but made total sense at the same time. It was when he got back to his office that he found Mycroft Holmes sat at his desk, his back poker straight, with an unreadable expression on his face.
"Sounds awesome. Well, you can count me in for two tickets. I'll happily drag Uncle Myc to watch you with me.", Greg answered, grinning.
"Papa? Papa is sad? Why are you crying, Papa?", Rosie asked, as Sherlock hadn't realised he was crying again.
It had only been three days since they had decided to go to Scotland, in pursuit of the criminals, and they were on their way, by train, to Manchester, where they were going to spend one night, to minimise the travel time for Rosie, with her being young and easily inclined to become restless. They stayed over in the Midland hotel, taking up three suites, all expenses paid for by Mycroft, once again. Sherlock and John had one suite with Rosie, who slept in a travel cot and the boys had to share a bed. Neither of them fussed, but neither commented, either, when they’d found themselves wrapped around each other the next morning. John had found, on the train from Piccadilly station in Manchester to Edinburgh Waverley, that Sherlock’s thigh was pressed up against his, as Rosie freely went from her Dada’s to her Papa’s lap. Molly was sat with her nose in a romance novel of some kind, which made John feel sad for her, once again, because she was lonely. This was her first holiday in six years and she was using it to look after the child she would never have. Time was getting on and Molly wasn’t getting any younger and it was as though she had given up on all chance at love for herself, what with everything she has gone through. Moriarty. Tom. Sherlock. The hell she was put through, emotionally, with Eurus, without her knowing what was going to happen. It seemed, to John, that she had taken all of the hurt she felt and had turned it into love, pouring her heart and soul into her new little family. John was more than grateful for her presence when it came to looking after Rosie and he loved having her around as a person. Molly was a welcome female influence on Rosie’s life and John wanted that for his daughter. He wanted her to have a woman who she could talk to, when she was older, about the stuff that girls don’t want to talk to her Dad about, let alone her Papa. John could just imagine the hell that would ensue if Rosie ever asked her Papa where babies came from. It made him chuckle a little.
For the first few weeks, John barely slept. He sat, staring at Sherlock’s violin, like he was willing it to play. Sherlock always used to play for him when he couldn’t sleep. He visited Sherlock’s grave once a week, and would spend anything up to four hours, stood talking to him. John always used to make fun of his husband for continuing to talk when John wasn’t there. Now that Sherlock was really gone, John could see the appeal.
When they entered the drawing room, which was usually filled with light-hearted chatter and sounds of tea cups being lifted to lips before being placed back into saucers, they were hit with a wall of intense silence. The King, Queen and Prime Minister were stood waiting. John gave Sherlock’s hand another squeeze, before attempting to pull his hand away, which made Sherlock hold on even tighter. So, John simply held onto him and stood by his side.
"I said he is attractive now, Sherlock. He is well into adulthood now. And don't you worry, love. I have eyes only for you.", John smiled, placing a kiss to Sherlock's cheek, which seemed to calm him down a little bit.
"Very funny.", Mycroft dead-panned. "I wanted to arrange an appropriate time for you and John, and of course Rosamund, to come for dinner, with Mummy and Father."
John did his shift at the surgery. He drank his coffee, before he left the flat, and stopped off at the corner shop on his way to work and picked up some energy drinks. He knew they were not good for him but, in that moment, he found he couldn’t care less. His patients got away with not being snapped at too much. One particular patient, however, who had consulted Doctor Google before arriving for their appointment was put in their place, with John’s sarcasm being at his finest. It was his second to last appointment of the day and he just wanted to get home to his partner, child and bed. But mainly his bed.
"You have a point.", John replied, also chuckling, whilst patting Sherlock's back lightly. "I'm sure Rosie will introduce to it, anyway, Sherlock."
"Of course, I can. I would love to.", Sherlock smiled, feeling his heart swell that he had been asked for help on something that meant so much to Rosie.
