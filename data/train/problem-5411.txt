Dean seemed to be very pleased.
When he got outside, he recognized two things. He was much more drunk than he thought. The fresh air cleared his mind a little bit, but he still noticed how he staggered. He also discovered Cas immediately.
"And now Dean's gone. " Cas laughed joylessly.
"Yes. The hay must be in the shed before the rain."
“Sounds fantastic!” Dean yawned.
“No, just read it. I am sure you will understand the reason why I gave it to you.” She replied.
Cas knew he should have been embarrassed because his voice sounded so incredibly needy, but he didn’t care.
"What happened? I can tell you what was happening. I have to work all summer at this fucking ranch to pay off the damage while you have a nice summer. " The thought of that really aggravated him.
„Yes it did!“ the Alpha reassured him.
All Dean was able to do when he lifted the t-shirt was to pray.
"A few weeks ago, when we were sitting on the couch together and I wanted to cuddle up to you, I didn't get the impression that. . . " Dean couldn't keep looking Cas in the eye. So he closed them, tears still running down his cheeks.
He reached for a pillow and shoved it under Cas's ass.
“I am fine thanks, but I am here to ask if you need anything”
Cas almost cried now. His eyes sparkled angrily, his hands were clenched to fists as if he wanted to hit Dean.
With a sigh, he opened the front door. There stood Balthazar.
Sam smiled at him.
"I thought so. I assume there are. . . things in your bag that Sam will need. " He inquired.
"Dean Winchester, this is none of your business. I can screw whoever I want. "
“It is possible, Dean and you know it. It’s possible if you are true mates.” Sam explained calmly.
The prospect of Cas going home with him seemed to calm the Alpha at least a little. His aggressive posture eased a bit and he let himself be dragged away from the other Alpha.
"He didn't exactly say that you are a child, did he?" Charlie interjected.
"Dean! How are you? Sam told me you had. . . "
Fuck! How many tears could be in one single man?
The Omega didn’t bother to answer the question. They both knew it was true.
“Move…”
This was all Gabriel’s fault.
Dean was getting ready for the party and disappeared from their dorm as quickly as possible. The party at the frathouse was just the right thing for tonight. He'd get wasted and disappear upstairs with some beta. That would distract him. Yeah, that's what he'd do.
Oh God, it should be completely impossible for him to be as turned on as he is since he just came a minute ago. Because of this, Cas wasn't prepared for the orgasm that suddenly rushed through him with full force when Dean's hole started to contract rhythmically.
They then tried to find a halfway comfortable position to relax in.
He knew they wouldn’t last long.
"That means that I can get him the tattoo but it won't come back on his soulmates body. It also means that his soulmate probably won't see his new tattoo because it's on a rather delicate place. But it also means that this person is still his soulmate. With or without the tattoo. The mark is only a sign, not the real magic. "
"I see. "  Cas said and somehow he seemed to be upset. "You probably don't need to. I'm sure there are enough people who'd be happy to help you out."
Dean winked at Cas to ease the atmosphere.
"There's only one cure for dust allergy? Are you serious?"
Cas sighed in frustration, putting his pen away. He was currently sitting at his desk, trying to get some work done.
Oh God! Shit!
But when Dean took his cock in his hands and licked the precome from the head all these thoughts disappeared immediately.
"Alpha, please take me, take me…"
Cas nodded, got the little package and handed it to Dean. Okay, he could do this. He was able to act like a normal person for a few minutes longer.
"Yes, I will, but first I have to remove off my Scentblockers. Otherwise, he won't let me in either. "
"I hope you're right, Ellen!" Cas stated with a sigh.
The kiss became more and more possessive and Cas had the feeling to go mad if Dean didn’t fuck him already.
„Cas, Meg told me that you... that you are in love with me. Is it true?" he asked and looked at him.
“Nah, I’ll call you Cas. Castiel is such a mouth full.”
"Oh, "Cas gasped and blushed. " You heard us. "
Dean couldn't suppress a loud moan.
Dean could only stare at him.
“Cas?”
Dean ran his hand through his hair and looked down to his feet.
Dean started to get impatient after a few seconds.
Dean told the story again and one of the officers wrote everything down.
„Yeah Baby, tell me what you want.“
“His soulmate removed the tattoo and he is so sad, desperate even.”
It was three days later. Dean was in his room and tormented himself with his homework for his writing class. However, the headline for the essay drove him mad.
“What?” Dean’s eyes grew wide. Oh God! Dean would never let this happen. It was barbaric.
Cas wanted to answer that Dean had the same effect on him, but he wasn’t able to form a coherent sentence so he just smashed their lips together. It was like a firework exploded inside of him. Even though this sounded like a cheap romance novel, Cas wasn’t able to describe the rush of emotions that raged inside him when her lips finally touched in another way. With a deep moan, Dean opened his mouth to deepen the kiss. When Cas started to grind against Deans groin, the other man gasped helplessly.
Cas smiled at him. He knew the unpleasant feeling of being helplessly at the mercy of his own biology.
Cas all but yelled at him. The Omega was even more adorable when he was angry.
“No, Castiel. I am sorry. I'm sorry I didn't seem to know my son well enough. Anyone who sees you two fit together perfectly…And I'm so relieved that the universe chose you for Dean.”
“I just cut myself with the knife. It’s nothing…”
Cas was completely overwhelmed by the possibility He always knew that he liked men, and as he grew older, he also realized that he not only prefered men but Alphas. Of course, it was clear to him that he would never have his own children or that he never would be able to bond with another Alpha.  But what if he was wrong? What if he could possibly have at least the bonding?
Dean smirked at Cas’ disbelieving facial expression.
Cas voice was sounding so debauched, he looked so beautiful with his red swollen lips and his hungry eyes and fuck, he smelled so good… and Dean felt his knot passing the rim and suddenly he was locked and an orgasm washed over him with full force. Dean had never experienced something like that.
"Oh god, boys. You're really crazy. "Benny laughed.
Castiel stared at Mr Winchester in shock. Oh, my God! Dammit! Dean's father knew!
Charlie took a deep breath and looked him straight in the eyes.
When he came into the living room, he saw Jo lying there on the couch. She must have fallen asleep in front of the TV.
The trip back to her apartment was mostly silent. It wasn't until they arrived in their living room and Cas sat down at the couch with a groan, that Dean started the conversation Cas had been afraid of for the last hour.
"I think you're not the only one who wonders what’s going on with Dean Winchester. I have seen him at many parties. Most of the time he was sitting in a corner making out, or he disappeared in one of the upper rooms with his squeeze. "
“Is there anything I can do against it?” Dean asked quietly.
"What? Dean..."
"Whatever you say," Charlie answered. Dean knew she wasn't convinced.
So finally, we will have our first meeting between the two Alphas  ^.^
Oh yes, now he remembered. He went into an unexpected heat. It was really bad. He didn’t want to call the Omega Service. He knew how Dean felt seeing someone else touching Cas. And of course, he understood. Would someone else touch Dean… He didn’t want to finish the thought. And then it hit him like a hammer. Fuck!
Cas face was a mixture of disbelief, wonder and finally realization. For Dean, his facial expression was like a confession.
When Cas started to grind against Deans groin, he gasped helplessly.
"I... I've never. . . I mean. . . " Embarrassed Dean cleared his throat.
“STOP! Are you insane? Why for fuck's sake should I be interested in you? You are nothing more than a cocky jerk with an exaggerated libido.”
„You mean a mating bite?“ Cas asked.
Everything in Dean rebelled against the touch He didn't want her to touch him. Not like this. He had decided not to tell Mr Novak that they were soulmates right now, but that didn't mean he would cheat on him.
"Dean! What the hell is this? "
“Dean! Sometimes you are really an idiot. You always were everything to me. From the first moment on. Even if my biology wanted a fucking knot my soul knew you were the one and only for me. You are all I ever wanted.”
Fuck! It would be very rude to refuse now.
And I really hope you will like this chapter! Please tell me!   ^.^
"Mr Winchester. It's not the injuries from that accident that are making me worry, it are your blood values. Your liver values are very elevated. Thank God the liver is an organ that is able to regenerate but only up to a certain point. So, unfortunately, I have to tell you that there is no way you can go on taking Relevium. We found the pills in your jacket pocket when we looked for your name and any contact numbers." Dr Crowley explained.
"We're not soulmates. I... I've never had the luck to meet my soulmate. "Mr Novak looked at his hands.
A knock on the door prevented him from throwing his mobile on the wall.
“Ahh”
Castiel Novak would be their lodger for the next six month. Ever since John had the car accident and was enchained to a wheelchair they needed extra money to pay their bills. The last lodger was a nice guy called Benny. Dean liked him. But he met his soulmate Andrea and they decided to live together. So the Winchesters had to take in someone new. Castiel Novak was the substitute for Mrs Miller until the end of the semester. Mrs Miller was an English teacher at the Oak High School but she got pregnant. So Mr Novak wasn’t only their new lodger, he would also be Deans new English teacher. Yeah! Who wanted to even see a teacher after school let alone live with him under one roof? Fuck his life! The last six months before he went to college would be terrible. But of course, he knew that his parents had no other choice. They needed the money.
"I'm not really hungry, but thanks, Dean. "
„Ahh… Dean…Fuck“
Dean shrugged.
The girl nodded and started taking dishes out of the cupboard. She knew exactly where the plates and cutlery were. It was clear that she was here often. Fuck! Cas didn’t like the thought at all. Of course, he knew how stupid this was. What did he expect? That Dean would change his mind about Omegas so easy. Obviously, he knew they were true mates and just didn't want him. It was clear that the Alpha liked Jo the way he smiled at her.
Oh, God. The situation was almost grotesque. Cas’ knot was literally stuck in Dean, while his own hand was still pressed tightly around Dean's knot, covered in Dean's spunk. Their mixed scents filled the whole damn barn.
"Yes, he did. Don't you want to show them, honey? " She said enthusiastically. Castiel sensed how proud she was. Maybe she was even relieved that her son got the mark.
“Dean! Fuck! I… I love you too! I love you!” Cas answered though he knew he didn’t have to say it loud because Dean was able to feel it through the bond.
„Where. Is. He?“
So Cas had to man up and get over it. The sooner the better. And Balthazar was the right person for this. Cas had told Balthazar the truth. Of course, he had. And Balthazar had been okay with it. He never got tired of telling Cas how hot he was and that did wonder to Castiel's self-esteem. And the sex was good. Castiel had felt really great this morning. At least until this conversation.
Cas all but run upstairs without even asking which room belonged to the youngest Winchester. Gripping the white bag with shaky hands he searched for the right room.
“I think you scent bonded with your roommate,” Sam said.
Cas cleared his throat.
"Hey, you're starting to think too much again," Dean said. The boy seemed to feel what was going on with Cas. "Listen Cas, maybe I should be freaking out because I am attracted to an Alpha, but...but somehow I'm amazingly okay with the situation. And even if I don't have the faintest idea what this is between us with all the knotting and scenting, I don't care. This feels right. We can figure out the details later. Right now all I know is that it feels good to be with you and that I would like to see where this takes us. At least...if you want that too." Dean looked Cas straight in the eye. His look was honest and also a little vulnerable, like he was afraid that Cas would turn him down.
He sighed deeply.
The problem was Dean's damn loyalty to his friends. Jody and Castiel were very sure that Dick Roman's son and the whole gang had something to do with the fires.
Sorry for not updating such a long time. I wasn't feeling the Alpha/Alpha vibe. ^.^ But now I am all back in. So, I really hope you like it.
“Dean?” He asked trying to sound innocent.
“Sure. That’s the impression I had too when you were literally begging me to bite you. Fuck! I would have nearly done it!”
He tried to get up, but Mary held him back.
"Would you like a piece of Dean's birthday pie, too?" Mary Winchester jolted him out of his thoughts. Damn! He shouldn't have stopped to watch Dean.
“Dean knew you would react like this. That’s the reason why he left. He wants you to be happy with your true mate and he thinks you never would give it a try if he is still around.”
Ah, Dean now understood why Gabriel said he had no chance. He had not expected that much rejection. Cas was playing hard to get.
"Not bad. He's still trying to convince everyone that his son should take the suppressants, though. He almost freaked out when I told him that you and Cas bought a house with the settlement money. "
When the secretary left his classroom Cas realized that he was not only disappointed that Dean wouldn’t be in his class, he was also angry. He wanted to get to know the boy. With a deep sigh, he decided to think about it later and start to prepare for his classes.
"Cas, what's wrong? You smell so sad. I'm so sorry if I did anything. . . "
<3     <3     <3     <3     <3     <3      <3     <3     <3      <3     <3     <3      <3     <3     <3      <3     <3     <3      <3
Both of them were panting loud now. Cas dragged Dean onto the bed and quickly pulled the bottle of lube from the nightstand.
Dean’s eyes went wide.
Maybe he should try to have a neutral conversation at first. Castiel starts to put his stuff away, ignoring him as much as possible. Okay, this was not the right way. He had to play with open cards.
Cas's heart pounded like crazy in his chest. He didn't . . . ?
He managed to push Cas to the bed.
It wasn't Charlie. It was Cas!
“Oh God! Cassi! I didn’t know you had it in you! Such a bad boy! I am proud of you! Dean, you seem to be a good influence!”
"But you didn't. Thanks to you, I'm still here. I don't know how you got back to the ranch so fast, but you saved my life without a doubt, Dean," Cas said squeezing Dean's hand.
“I love you too, Dean.” Cas snuggled deeper into Dean’s arms. “And I can’t believe you are mine now. My gorgeous beautiful Alpha!”
"I think she’s doing fine. She just thinks she is too round to leave the sofa. The baby could come any minute now. Tobias has to leave as soon as she calls of course," Jody explained.
“I am clean. I got tested a year ago and there was no one in the meantime. But…” Cas eyes grew wide.
“Then my tongue would run over your balls.”
“Only because you are fucking numb. Jesus Christ, Cas! Please! We need to try this. Do you really think I could become happy without trying to fix this? I need you!”
Sorry, this update took such a long time. I hope you like this chapter anyway  ^.^
The shook hands but Dean recognized immediately that they didn't like each other.
“Yeah, I feel the same. Do you… do you think this is working?”
"Cas!"
“I love seeing you in my clothes,” Dean confessed.
He took a deep breath to calm down a bit, which unfortunately didn't help at all.
Dean didn't even want to imagine how much that must have hurt his friend. He only knew that it drove him crazy to hear Cas' moaning at the moment. However, not only because he was jealous, but also because it was impossible not to imagine what the two men were doing, how blown Cas pupils had to be, how hard his nipples, how flushed his cheeks...
Lisa looked at him in surprise and disappointment.
"You're so tight, baby." Dean moaned not knowing how long he could last.
No feelings!
“Dean, I don’t want you to suffer. I am feeling fine at the moment. I am sorry for assuming you would leave me but I can’t undo it. But I will not let you suffer all your life because of me."
Both of them were breathing heavy now. Dean was grinding against the Omegas ass while he jerked his cock. It was amazing.
What the hell was he gonna write? It was almost funny. He should write about Soulmates. The first part wasn't a problem. He described the historical and scientific facts known about the phenomenon. The problem was the second part, which was about his personal experience or his opinion. And there was the crux of the matter. He had actually finished the whole essay, but the second part was too personal. Mrs Johnson would know right away who he was writing about. So he had to rewrite it. But he didn't know how. He only knew he had to change it.
Cas nodded his head in disbelieve.
Of course, he couldn't spot any of Cas moods. The blockers prevented this well enough, but the smell of lemongrass and Ocean was always slightly in the air. It drove Dean crazy.
"Would you please stop this nonsense? Do you really think you had the slightest chance of raping me? Dean, I'm one of the few male Omegas in this country. The first thing my parents taught me when I presented was self-defense and believe me I am very well able to defend myself. You didn't do anything I didn't want you to and when I said stop, you stopped right away. So everything is fine! But this isn't about me or you. This is about your brother. He is the seventh male Omega in the United States.  I think we're only 35 worldwide. You should take me with you. Your father did the right thing not to let the Male Omega Care organization into your home, but your brother needs support now. He wouldn't let you or your father in his room, believe me. "
"Stop it, Cas!" Dean said all of a sudden.
„Oh my god! What happened? Did you remove it?“
“You won’t lose me, Dean. I promise,” Cas murmured.
“Fuck, I am so sorry. C’me here.” Cas hugged him and it felt so good. Maybe it was just Cas being so close, maybe it was because Cas T-shirt still smelled a little bit like him, but it was more bearable this way.
The Omega beneath him was arching his back at the same time when he also fell over the edge. His inner walls were clenching to milk even the last drop of Deans release. And it was so fucking hot!
Dean was a bit surprised hearing the news.
When Dean woke up to what it there was light outside. He had no idea what time it was, though. His cell phone was on the nightstand, but there was no chance to reach it without moving a little bit away from Cas. But he wouldn’t leave Cas’ embrace for all the tea in China! Besides, time wasn't important right now. He snuggled himself even closer to Cas and inhaled the irresistible scent of the Omega. They were mates now! Dean didn’t remember everything exactly but he remembered the fact that Cas was his. This was all he ever wanted. To be Cas mate. To be all the Omega needed and wanted.
Dean couldn’t stifle an unhappy laugh.
Dean lifted his head and looked into Cas eyes.
Charlie hugged him and let out a deep sigh.
Immediately, Dean slipped out of his boxers.
“Oh, I think I have an idea, Dean. And I love you too, my gorgeous beautiful stubborn Alpha!”
Oh God! Finally! Finally, he was allowed to taste this warm and soft lips.
"Benny, if Dean doesn't want to. . . "
So Sam gave in eventually. That happened more than a year ago.
“I didn’t want you to suffer like I had to¸ Dean. I did it all for you! Do you think it was easy for me? The pills were for me because I couldn’t stand the pain of losing your mother. But I decided to give them to you, even if I knew that the pain would never end without them.”
“Cas, I…” Dean whimpered helplessly.
"You can't promise that. Nobody can,” Dean replied and snuggled even closer to the other Alpha.
Cas: I know Meg. And you are probably right. I just overreacted. I should let you sleep now.
Agonizingly slowly Dean added a third finger and thrust them in and out, scissoring and stretching him while his mouth sucked and licked, sending shivers along Castiel’s spine.
In the last few weeks, Cas often wasn't home in the evening. He came home late or he didn't come home at all. Dean told himself he didn't mind. His best friend deserved to be happy. Of course he did. But if Dean was completely honest with himself, he had to admit that he didn't like this new order of things.
“You can’t be serious. I don’t want to work on a farm for the whole summer. I can work at Bobby's garage and pay the money back. Novak’s farm is right in the middle of nowhere. I wouldn’t even be able to hang out with my friends during the summer.” he complained further.
Startled, Cas looked at the girl who had joined him. She was pretty. Big blue eyes, brown hair and the scent of an unmated alpha. In another life, he would have been attracted to her.
Oh! Oohh!
”God, Dean. You don’t know what you are doing to me,“ Cas whispered. His eyes were nearly black now.
“No, you won’t! Cas, I …I won’t tell anyone. Of course, it will affect my reputation, when I have to admit to Gabe, that I can’t seduce you, but I’ll get over it.”
"Dad, it's a long story. "
"I'm so sorry Charlie. . . " Dean said and squeezed her harder, the crumbled essay still in one hand.
"That's good. I see a problem, though. "
No! Please no!! Soulmate tattoos didn't just disappear. Not even when the soulmate died. In this case, at best, it began to fade. This had to mean his soulmate was removing it right now. Oh, God!
Without waiting for an answer Mr Winchester tapped him on the shoulders, took his jacket and disappeared.
After a few moments, Sam came back and handed the note to Cas. Dean knew his brother had read it on his way down. He saw it in Sam’s eyes, saw the pitty.
Oh, no! Certainly not, because Dean had no intention of telling his English teacher that he was his soulmate.
He entered the room and… there he was.
"You say that like it's a bad thing, Mum. Besides, it's not true. Dean reads at least as much as I do."
Mary opened the door with enthusiasm.
"Dean, you have to blow out the candles and make a wish. " Sam said.
Oh god! He wanted Cas so much. He had never felt like this before.
This was the moment he realized he was so in love with Dean Winchester. It wasn’t just a crush. This was love. Maybe this shouldn’t have been a surprise because Dean was his True Mate, but right now he didn’t only know he loved the Alpha, he was feeling all this love rushing through him with full force. It was terrifying and so beautiful…
The only problem was that his inner alpha wasn't on board with the whole idea. He was able to smell Cas scent anywhere in their dorm, despite the scent blockers.
“Fuck, Dean. Yes! Come in my mouth. Imagine me kneeling in front of you, looking up at you, your dick deep in my mouth... Fuck Dean! I’m…Dean! Ahh….”
"No, but I know he meant it. What do you expect me to do? To beg him to leave his wife? I have no right to do that. Besides, I don't think he'd do it anyway. "
Instead, he took a shower. Then he put on his pyjama pants and a t-shirt and lay down on Dean's former bed. Cas had no idea how much time had passed when someone finally knocked on the door, but by then it was already completely dark outside.
This was amazing but he needed more.
"But I would never. . . "
“No, you won’t! Cas, I …I won’t tell anyone. Of course, it will affect my reputation, when I have to admit to Gabe, that I can’t seduce you, but I’ll get over it. I’d never do it with an omega… Never.”
“Please take a seat, Mr Novak. Do you want some coffee? You look like you would need it.”
The only way to break a scent bond was distance. So he tried to avoid Dean wherever he could. It almost seemed like Dean was doing the same thing because Cas never met him.
The weekend and also the whole next week remained uneventful, at least as far as Dick Roman and his gang were concerned. Dean was just glad there were fire alarms in the house. He wouldn't be able to close his eyes at night for one minute otherwise. It made him anxious to wait for Dick to make a move. He could sense that Cas felt the same.
"Mr Winchester, were your parents true mates?"
What the hell?
Dean knelt next to him and watched each of his movements with hungry eyes. After a while, he added a second finger and grabbed Cas cock with his other hand. Then he slowly took him into his mouth and sucked.
“He packed his things and left Lawrence. I… I don’t know where he is right now.”
"Hello, Jody! We're very well, thank you. It couldn't be better," Dean said and he was beaming.
“No, I…I think I felt it through the bond… Do… do you feel anything, Dean?”
John smiled at her. “Thank’s Ellen. It’s Mary’s recipe. She was a great cook. ” John replied warmly.
Sam had not even presented yet. Dean and his father suspected that Sam would become a beta.
Cas voice sounded friendly, but everyone could still feel that he was still annoyed by the presence of the Omega girl. Of course, it wasn't fair, because it wasn’t her fault. John Winchester was the one to blame.
"Now make a wish. "  His mother ordered with a smile.
“Okay, let’s do it!” Dean said.
„Cas, I love you. You have to believe me. Please,“ Dean begged.
"Oh no, little Omega! You can’t, because you are mi ... you are my roommate and... "
Heat was rushing through his veins, pooling low in his stomach. Dean for sure was no blushing virgin, but no other partner had ever made him feel like this, like he was about to lose control.
“Oh John, Dean was right. This is really the best Lasagne I ever had.” Ellen stated after a while.
"I know you don't want to be involved in Omega things, Dean. You can wait here. It won’t take long."
So he did. She really smelled nice. Dean inhaled deeper.
“I know this must sound weird to you, but like I said earlier, I’m not allowed to tell you any details. Mr Winchesters brother will arrive soon. Maybe he will tell you more.”
They all had to laugh. Happily, they sat down at the table and started their Thanksgiving dinner. One of hopefully many more.
How did he feel? The numbness in his true mate's soul still hurt, but somehow he felt a bit better. Maybe it was because he had some rest.
Dean had really saved him and stayed with him all this time? A delightful warm feeling rushed through Cas. He looked at the other Alpha and reached out to him. Dean laced their fingers together and smiled at him.
"Okay, Winchester. I've finished my breakfast earlier for you. I hope it's really important. " She greeted him breathlessly.
The doctor left the room and a few minutes later Rowena entered the room with a spray can in her hand.
She burned his bloody clothes and gave him some important tips. She wasn't a shifter herself, but her own grandfather was. From him, she also knew how to shift without getting caught.
Passionately, he returned the kiss and run his fingertips over the skin on Cas‘ back. Dean loved how smooth Cas‘ skin was.
No, he is not a Beta! Dean wanted to shout out loud, but he remembered he promised to keep Cas’ secret.
"Tomorrow morning. We're in no particular hurry. " Dean answered.
“Please, Alpha… knot me!” And this was it for Dean. Even if he wanted to prepare Cas more properly, even if he didn’t want to rush their first time together as Alpha and Omega, there was no chance for him to hold back now. Cas saw it in his face when he licked his lips and lined up his rock hard cock. Then he pushed inside with one rush. There was no time for Cas to adjust because the Alpha moved immediately, but Cas loved it, loved the feeling of being filled by his Alpha, loved the way Dean barely was able to control himself.
Jesus fucking Christ. This was so hot. Cas was coming to the imagination of sucking him off.  Images of his soulmate naked on his bed, pumping his cock while white stripes of come splatter across his belly and chest flashed up in Deans head. And that’s what sent him over the edge as well.
Cas was getting angrier with every minute.
Dean was in rut! His eyes were red! Fuck! This was the reason why all this happened! This was the reason why the Alpha acted so possessive at the party and why he wanted Cas to be his. It was all just biology. Nothing more. Only an Alpha that wanted to breed and mate the next Omega because he was in rut. Tears were forming in Castiel's eyes. He was such a stupid idiot. What did he think? That Dean Winchester was falling in love with him? Oh God. He was so pathetic and stupid and it fucking hurt. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
It would be best to act as normal as possible.
They heard a choking noise from Gabe. “Fuck guys, get a room. This sweet sappy love posturing is disgusting!”
(See the end of the chapter for
„You look so cute when you are angry.“ He giggled.
"Jo! Oh, God, it’s so good to see you!" He heard Dean saying.
"Coffee, please. "
Dean sat down on his bed, brushing a hand through his hair, hesitating before answering.
So the rancher really thought he was dating someone. Dean shook his head.
“Yes I am yours, you fucking stupid stubborn idiot. I always was!”
Dean had no patience for his Dad’s stupid small talk. Even though he could imagine John Winchester's excuse, he wanted to hear it from his father in person.
“I did experiment with girls but I never went the whole way and I never did anything with boys. So yes, you are my first.”
"Mr Winchester, I'm sorry, I didn't mean. . . " Cas sensed he was blushing.
"I knew I can rely on you little Cousin. After all, you bring me fifty bucks. But still, the bet is not won. You have to stay strong until Thanksgiving. "Gabriel replied.
Thank you so much for your support! You really make my days.
Cas shrugged his shoulders. Meanwhile, he had put Sam's breakfast on the tray.
"Yeah, Castiel Novak."
"What. . . I don't understand. I'm a Beta. Betas don't have true mates. Listen, if you're trying to play tricks on me… Ah… I see. Where is the hidden camera?"
"I'm doing the grocery shopping. . . "
“Your mother thought we would need some time alone,” Cas explained.
But it was her last message that broke his heart, even if he felt like a prick because Cas deserved to be happy.
“Mr Novak please calm down. I am not allowed to tell you any details but he is not about to die.”
The door was opened and a very pretty young girl entered the room.
Sadly he nodded.
"That's right. " Dean replied. "Sounds exciting. But I wanted to try something new this year. "
Mr Novak looked at Dean curiously and reached out his hand to greet him. And there Dean saw it. The tattoo on Mr Novak’s hand. Two white spread wings. Fuck!
The next morning Dean helped to take care of the animals after breakfast and then he drove into town. He was terribly nervous. Even though Dick Roman never set fire to a farm during the day before, that didn't mean he wouldn't try it this time. Fuck! He had asked Bobby if he could bring the spare part, but his foster dad had too much to do in the garage. And Dean couldn't tell him the truth because he had promised Jody he would not tell the story to anybody.
“Oh yes…fuck, please, I need…” Dean gasped nearly out of his mind.
He managed to turn around a bit and so he could take a look at the one who held him like an octopus. It was none other than Dean! Damn it! How did Dean get into his bed and why the hell were Cas scent glands no longer covered with the blockers? At that moment he felt Dean's tongue. In his sleep, he licked Cas glands. Oh Jesus fucking Christ! Dean must have licked off the blockers. Dean squeezed even closer and pressed himself against the back of the Omega. Cas could now clearly feel Dean’s hard cock. Oh, God, how would he ever get away from this? Dean's licking slowly turned into sucking and Cas could do nothing against the rising arousal that was spreading in him. Dean started rubbing his lower body against Cas's ass.
Sam looked at him in horror.
While he went inside the house he considered what Crowley had told him. So Castiel Novak was gay and quite young. Perhaps there really was an advantage to be gained from this. Even if Dean wasn’t interested in male Alphas at all, the rancher didn’t know that. Maybe Crowley's suggestion wasn't so stupid after all.
When Cas woke up it was already six in the morning. He knew that Dean was gone even before he looked at the other side of the bed. Of course, the Alpha was gone. Cas wasn’t able to stifle an unhappy laugh. Dean’s side of the bed was empty and cold. Deans scent was not very strong, so Cas was sure he left hours ago.
It was terrible. He couldn't even kiss her. Not to mention doing more.
Dean felt his cheeks heat up even more. He hated being the centre of attention, especially in emotional matters. But one look at Cas calmed him down.
***Dean***
“Are you okay, Dean,” Cas asked with a sympathetic look.
The red-haired women appeared immediately.
Actually, Castiel was thinking about going to work without breakfast that day. He knew it was Dean's eighteenth birthday and that the situation between him and the Winchesters was more than tense, he thought it would be better this way. Maybe if Dean got his soulmate tattoo today the situation would calm down a bit. Mary Winchester would see that Dean wasn't his soulmate, and everything would be fine. Maybe then she wouldn't face him with so much suppressed anger. However, if Cas was honest with himself, he had to admit that he didn't like the idea that Dean should have another soulmate. That he didn’t like it was not the right expression, it really hurt him physically to think about it. Though it was ridiculous, of course. Dean Winchester was eighteen and a student. Even though he wasn't his student, it was still not right to think of him in such a way. He could only hope that the next five months would pass quickly. Maybe it would be a good thing Dean came home tonight with a soulmate tattoo. A tattoo that had nothing to do with wings, especially white wings.
He cleared his throat and started to finish the meal.
The rest of the ride was more pleasant than Dean had thought. Cas turned on the music and they discussed their favourite songs for the whole two hours. It was amazing how quickly time passed.
They all welcomed him as well. Cas didn't know if he should give Dean his present right away, but the decision was taken when Mary took the small package from his hands and put it on the sideboard where she already placed the other gifts.
“Good morning Mr Winchester. How are you feeling?” He wanted to know.
"I am really sorry…” John said again. He was obviously feeling uncomfortable. "No problem, Mr Wincheter. It's not like I don't believe soulmates. I just think there are other ways to be happy as well. "
She squealed cheerfully and embraced him.
…I just want you to be mine, Cas thought. Fuck! Why wasn’t he able to say it out loud? He met his Ture Mate for fucks sake. Shouldn’t this be so much easier?
"Okay, let's go. My mood is ruined anyway," she said.
"Oh, that's just my homework. We have to write an essay about soulmates. The personal part is. . . . It's too personal. Not exactly the subject I want to write about right now. " Dean showed her the headline and then he threw crumpled paper into the bucket under his desk.
"Yes, I was in Lawrence today. I was at the same tattoo shop where you were. I had no photo of the tattoo so I hoped the lady there would remember your tattoo. And thank God she did. She said she was wondering when I was gonna show up. "
But then Dean’s hands were roaming over Cas body. It was disastrous. The Alphas hands found their way under Castiel’s sleeping shirt touching his chest and playing with his nipples. When Deans' teeth scratched over the scent glands, biting down a bit but not hard enough to break the skin, Cas nearly lost it. It was shocking how much the Omega wanted Dean to bite until he would draw blood, how much he wanted the Alpha to mate him. Cas wasn’t able to stifle the moan that escaped his throat.
Dean blushed.
If Dean had been a normal person, he wouldn't have been so reluctant to get married. Lisa was very pretty, surely he could have learned to like her or even to love her. But he wasn't a normal person. He might have been able to cover up the matter of his second gender in public, but how would he be able to hide his scent glands during their wedding night, and how on earth could he explain that he had to leave the shared bedroom in the middle of the night to go into the woods three times a year?
“It’s fine, Mr Winchester. I would…”
Thank you for all your sweet comments so far. ^.^
But before he could react, Dean got up and touched Castiels cheeks. He looked at Cas so tenderly it almost hurt.
„No! Of course not! But…I might have reminded him that I am a very rare male Omega. And …maybe I asked him if he was aware of the fact that I had to inform the Male Omega Center that I would be homeless…”
"Hey. I am Hannah. I've never seen you at one of these parties. "
Maybe kindness was the key to make Cas smile again. But it seemed that Dean's happiness would only make the rancher angrier.  Cas noisily pushed his chair back and stood up. Without another word, he left the kitchen. Okay? This would be an interesting day.
“What? Cas are you crazy! Of course not! I want to live with you.”
“Yes, yes my love. I feel it.” Cas whispered climbing on top of Dean and kissing him with all the love he felt.
“I didn’t pay enough attention, though. But… I think the name starts with >R<”
Then he pushed the other Alpha into the living room to the couch. There wouldn't have been enough time to go upstairs to the bedroom. Cas wanted Balthazar right away, without having time to think. Even before they arrived at the couch, they were both naked and Cas had trouble not coming before they even got started.
Finally, he packed his clothes and most of his belongings. He went into the bedroom again and kissed Cas for the last time.
“Come on, Cas. You know there will be times when you have to call the Omega Service. And it will break Dean’s heart again because every time he will be reminded that he definitely is not enough, because he has NO FUCKING KNOT! I’m sorry to be so brutal, but this is the truth. This is not only about you. It’s also about Dean. You are making it harder for him to forget you if you try to find him. Did you ever think about that? And what about your true mate. What if he smells you again or if you smell him. There is no way to win this game, Cas. In the end, there will always be someone hurt.”
After what felt like eternity Dean was finally fully seated.
"I know the question is very personal, but when did you lose your true mate?"
“Sorry, Mr Wincheste, but did I get this right. You were together with an Omega and you broke up?”
"No." was all he said. He didn't even think to give out any details. It was none of Cas business what he did in his spare time.
"Oh, I am sure Dean will not like that you are here with an Alpha. Does he know that she is only a good friend?" his Cousin wanted to know.
Dean had to fight very hard against the desire to hug the rancher. Everything in him was screaming to comfort the other man.
D: Would you look after Cas. He is in heat and the Service Alpha will be back soon. He has a key but I would feel better if Cas wouldn’t be alone.
"Cas, I can't. We're in a hospital. You're hurt and the doctor could come any minute. I can't just bite you now!" Dean said and looked at him skeptically.
"Um. . . "
"No! I don't want this! Now that we've finally found each other, I don't want to wait another four months. Dad, please!" Dean begged.
Meg gave Balthazar Castiel's number and two days later they had their first date. Castiel intended to bring Balthazar home if he liked him. Cas was really not a blushing virgin, but he wasn't actually the type for one night stands either.
"I know I don't deserve him, Meg. But I am not stupid enough to tell him that he could do so much better and I would be very grateful if you wouldn't tell him either," Dean replied watching Cas from afar.
„Oh God, you have no idea how much I love you, Cas. I always will. And therefore I have to let you go. You deserve to be happy even if happy means being without me.” Dean whispered into the Omega’s ear.
"You're just in time. I made my famous cheeseburgers!"
It took an eternity for Dean to control his breath.
Mr Novak was his soulmate! Okay, the guy was incredibly hot, but he was his fucking teacher. How would that work? Besides, they were here in their kitchen with Dean's parents and his little brother. He couldn't possibly show his own tattoo here. Oh, sweet Jesus! Could it have been worse?
Surprised Cas looked at him.
Dean blushed even deeper.
„What do you mean?“
“You know my cousin?” Castiel groaned.
Dean opened the door and took a deep breath. The sight was breathtaking.
But even if he wanted nothing more than to take everything Cas was willing to give, he was scared to death at the thought. This wouldn’t be a normal hook up. It would be so much more. He knew he would end up mated to this gorgeous Omega. But this was the problem.
"Oh, you will want, Dean-o. My cousin is exactly your type."
***Dean***
“No! Dean, I want to see your face!”
“… therefore you married her so she was able to become…”
“That’s what I thought. Dean is no one who rapes other people. But it won't be easy to convince this fact to him. He seemed very much of the opinion that he was the biggest creep on earth. " Gabriel explained.
"Good morning, Dean!" Lisa, the pretty secretary welcomed him with a radiant smile, just like every morning. She was a single parent Beta. Dean had already met her son Ben. He was a good boy.
„You should come with us. We don’t want to disappoint Dean Mr Handsome Winchester.“ Charlie giggled and places a kiss on his cheek, again the Omega didn’t know what she was talking about.
Was it weird that the other boy’s refusal turned him on even more? Of course, it was! But Dean couldn’t help it. The more his roommate resisted, the more Dean wanted him. He could still convince himself that this was only because of the bet with Gabe, but he knew the truth.
Dean laughed out loud. This was such a Cas thing to say. Cas and his terrible obsession with Stephen King movies.
“There are no risks for the partner in full rejection, but there are…”
"How can it be that you two are not true mates?" Sam shook his head in disbelieve.
Dean nearly jumped from his seat because of the noise she made.
Cas looked at his hands. Fuck! Maybe Dean never wanted them to bond in the first place. After all, the boy was only nineteen. Maybe it was too soon? Maybe Dean didn't really want Cas' bite in the first place? Maybe…
He was still asleep and looked so peaceful. One last time Dean touched his cheeks and then he grabbed his belongings and went to the Impala without turning back.
But when he left his room he saw that Cas wasn't alone. His friend was pushed against the wall by another man. The two were making out passionately and when Dean heard Cas moaning, he suddenly became aware of two things. For one, the sound went straight to Dean's cock. Jesus, he was hard in a millisecond. And the second thing he realized was that maybe for the very first time in his life, he felt something like jealousy. Fuck!
Dean stopped with any intentions he had towards Cas immediately after he found out about Cas’ second gender. At least that's how he tried to make it look like.  No seductive looks, no shirtless moments, no sexual innuendoes.
"All the better. I'm convinced those friends just got you into this mess. And now you're even protecting them. Dean, I really don't know what to do with you. I know you're a good kid, but this action could have easily put you in jail. Did you think just for one moment about me, Bobby or your brother? If Mr Novak hadn't been kind enough to give you a second chance, it would look really bad for you."
"Why" Sam wanted to know.
"Is everything all right, Dean?" His mum wanted to know.
"You have a feeling? Dean, where are you?" she wanted to know.
"Too many clothes" was all the Alpha mumbled.
“Fuck the party, Cas. I have been waiting long enough. I want to be with you. I need you. Please don’t send me away tonight.” Dean begged.
“He was very angry at first. Wanted to dispel me from the dorms. But then he made up his mind and decided to give us one of the couple rooms.”
: Castiel Novak
Dean laughed out loud.
Damn, the image of Cas' fingers inside of him was devastating.
Dean rose from his bed and the girl came closer.
A few hours later, he sat down on an armchair exhausted from all the hard work and took a few sips of an ice-cold beer. He had been working all day. Now he was tired and hungry, but above all, he felt sweaty. So he decided to take a quick shower and prepare himself something to eat afterwards. He'd settle for sandwiches. It was hot and he didn't feel like turning on the stove. If Dean would be here, maybe he'd suggest barbecuing. Oh Jesus! He did it again. It couldn’t be so hard not to think about the boy for one evening, could it?
"I'm gonna have to drive into town to get a spare part but I don't want to leave Cas alone," Dean revealed. "I am not sure if it would be a good idea. Maybe they are just waiting for me to leave the farm to go on with their plan?"
„Cas, please. If you ever cared for me just a little bit, then let me try. Please!”
To make his statement even clearer, the alpha leaned down, slowly tracing Castiel’s scent gland with his tongue.
"Hello, my name is Castiel Novak. I got a call because I'm Dean Winchester's emergency contact. "
Hanna smiled knowingly and glanced at Dean.
“I don’t understand….”
" Dean explained.
Cas didn't answer and looked at his shoes.
He shouldn’t have cared about the stupid tractor. He never should have let Cas alone on the ranch.
Dean knew her from his English class. It all started quite promisingly. They flirted for a while and he bought her a few drinks. But when she bent over to kiss him, everything inside of him screamed NO!
Balthazar didn't seem to notice his strange mood.  Cas had hardly closed the door behind him when the other man pushed him against the wall and kissed him with passion. Just as if he really hadn't had sex for a whole month and waited for that moment. Castiel knew it wasn't like that. Balthazar always had many flings.
Castiel smiled at the young woman. "Thank you very much. If everyone here is as friendly and helpful as you are, I think I'll be fine. "
Cas could only stare at Dean. How could he forget his feelings for the Alpha? All the love he felt for his mate suddenly washed through him. His green alert eyes, those incredibly soft lips, that damn hot body, every single freckle… Cas loved everything. The way Dean looked at him sheepishly and ran a hand through his hair after putting the tray down at the end of the bed. It was almost too much. This perfect man who had given literally everything for him, who always put the ones he loved first, who looked at Cas in awe right now, should belong to him? Cas knew he didn't deserve it, but he was so grateful that destiny decided Dean Winchester should be his true mate. So incredibly fucking grateful!
No, no, no. Please. Nooo!
Certainly not! Castiel turned around to enter the secretary's office again, but…
And the worst thing about it was that he still wanted to. Fuck!
“But... why didn’t you bond with me?” Cas asked sounding a little helpless.
“I don’t know. It’s about my new roommate…“
Cas's tiredness was forgotten. Was Dean crazy? How could he dare to keep this information from him? Cas felt anger boil up in him.
Wow, Dean never heard his mother speaking so rude with anyone let alone a lodger. But there had never been a time he loved her more! His mother was an amazing woman and she was fighting for the things she believed in. He took his plate and cup and carried both to the sink.
“He is gone! He left me because of the heat delirium, didn’t he? It’s all my fault. It’s my….it’s my fucking fault. I pushed away the one person I love more than anything else because I couldn’t control my stupid body. He must hate me.”
My other friends are somewhere here but I don’t see them.”
„Okay! Jo, you should go home now, Sam return to your room. Cas and Dean, I suggest you do this mating thing in Deans old room, and I need a few hours of sleep. This night was exhausting!” John ordered and they all followed his lead. Dean was glad his father had torn him out of his deep thoughts. There was no point in dealing with the worst already. He would have plenty of time for that when it really came to that.
Cas wouldn't let him go even though Dean had regained his balance.
As Cas carefully opened the door, a thick cloud of Omegascent hit him. He almost had to cough. Sam was sitting on a completely rumpled bed, undressed except for his pyjama pants. It was obvious that the situation was embarrassing for the young Omega. Cas immediately remembered his terrible experience with his first heat.
"The left side of the wardrobe is yours. I occupied the desk at the window. I hope this is okay. "Dean explained.
“Please!” he begged and turned his head so Cas had even more access to his scent glands.
Of course, Mr Winchester was right. And if Dean was willing to take the risk of ending up unhappy, he might have to take the risk of living with Dean's life being destroyed. It would make him feel guilty his whole life, yet somehow he owed it to Dean.
Grinning, Gabriel shook her hand.
Half an hour later he was laying in his bed, freshly showered and already in his pyjamas, cursing that he wasn't able to just switch off his brain. Suddenly he heard a soft knock on the door.
96 messages! Oh my god!
Encouraged by the reaction of his soulmate, Cas mouth wandered deeper and sucked on the soft flesh of the younger’s tummy. Dean's legs opened by themselves. The sight was exhilarating. Dean was laying below him, his eyes closed, his cheeks red, his mouth slightly opened and swollen from their kisses, his dick was hard and leaked precum while little moans escaped his lovers' troat. Oh God! Dean was so beautiful like this! On the inside of Dean's right thigh, Cas discovered the Soulmate tattoo. Dean got a new one, too. Warmth spread in Cas's chest. He gently stroke his fingertips over the two white wings, then he kissed the tattoo. Dean's breath came intermittently.
Was it even legal to put an alpha and an omega together in a room?
“Only if he didn’t take his pills for two or more days. In that case, it would be possible that the Omega was able to smell him even if he didn’t realize. He would have gotten into heat a few days later.”
It's Sunday and I finished another chapter. Yeah! ^.^
“Then I would suck you off, Dean. Oh God! I want your dick in my mouth. I want to taste you.”
Dean laughed.
Dean would have no choice but to take care of the problem on his own. But now that he knew his soulmate wanted him too, he had at least enough to think about.
“You are so beautiful.” Dean wasn’t able to resist touching Cas face.
Wow! So Dean had not only left, he had moved out. Cas wondered why it hurt him so much. After all, he was about to do the same thing.  It was just the logical consequence.
Gabe was laughing when he went away. Yeah, very funny, thank you very much!
"Yes we are, but Dean still doesn't seem to want me. So there's still hope for you, Jo. "  Cas voice was soft.
At some point, he realized that Cas came too but Dean was too focused on all the emotions that were rushing through him with full force.
Oh God! This guy was adorable!
Cas stammer just made him more and more angry.
Sam took a deep breath.
Of course, Dean had touched him like this before but it was so different this time, so much more intense.
Without paying attention to the shocked face of his son, John led the Omega into the house directly to the bathroom. When Cas came out a few minutes later, Dean nearly blacked out. Oh my god! The Omega smelled so good. It was physically almost impossible for him to suppress a groan. Cas's eyes also widened. Probably he was able to read Dean's reaction from his scent. But not only the Omega, also his father smelled the attraction and looked surprised from one man to the other.
The doctor went back to the door and opened it.
"My god, Dean! Please tell me you didn't remove the tattoo." Terrified, she looked at him.
“I don’t understand why this is important, Doctor.”
This was so hot! Jesus!
Cas's head fell back on the mattress as he moaned loudly.
„Let me have a look.“ Cas checked Dean’s finger.
"Could you get some milk for the calf?" Cas asked with a broken voice. Dean nodded and went into the house immediately. He didn't hurry because he knew Cas needed a few moments alone.
“By the way, we are really grateful that you two were able to figure this out. Jo told me everything. A full rejection state isn’t very funny.” Ellen said to Dean and Cas.
„Hey, Charlie“
“Good, Castiel. Welcome to the family. I must confess, at first I wasn't exactly pleased by the fact that you were Dean's soulmate. I had imagined it differently. I thought Dean was gonna settle down with a pretty girl and get me some grandchildren. I would never have thought that one of my sons could have a male soulmate.”
Charlie didn't answer, his phone rang instead. He answered it with a deep sigh.
“Hey! I forgot it's the first weekend of the month. Time passed so quickly.” Cas said.
“What did you do? Did you threaten him with anything?“
To be honest that was enough. Everyone else on the campus looked at him like he hanged the moon.
“Apparently not. Maybe you should consult your beloved books about everything, or google. I'm sure there's some scientific article about it. Whatever. If this Dean is really your true mate, a real bond between you would also be possible. You'd be fucking stupid to just throw that away. “ Balthazar said.
"You mentioned you didn't want to have anything to do with Omegas. But how does this even work with a Beta? You can't knot a Beta." Cas thought aloud.
"Dean, no!" Charlie looked at him in shock.
I know you probably thought that I would never go on with this but after the Supernatural finale, I had to go on. ^^ So yeah, blame it on the Supernatural writers, or the Spanish translators. Whatever, here we go.
“Thank God, it’s not you. I was so sure you…”
When the Alpha got out of the bathroom dressed only in his boxer shorts and with damp hair, Cas felt the longing very clearly. He quickly slipped past Dean into the bathroom. Under no circumstances did he want the alpha to recognize his arousal and get the wrong idea because although Cas body did react to the beautiful man in front of him, his soul was still numb. Even if there was this new tingling sensation in his chest.
"That's all right, Jody. Nothing will happen during the day, I am sure. Thank you for coming right away," Cas thanked her with a gentle smile.
„Dean! Please…“ Cas pushed his hips against Deans harder now.
He came so hard, he nearly blacked out. He could only hope that the two men in the next room were too busy with themselves to hear him. He was sure that he had moaned Cas' name. But he was too exhausted to care right now.
The Alpha was aware that despite his considerable experience with Betas and even some Alphas, he never wanted anyone so much.
She was thinking about Dorothee and now Cas remembered that she hugged him several times. Fuck! How could he not recognize?
A moan escaped his lips. Oh, fuck. His damn knot would never shrink if Dean went on like this and eventually the carcass people would arrive and his knot would still be stuck in Dean and… Fuck! This situation was so beyond anything he had ever experienced.
At first, he didn’t know what happened and why his roommate suddenly tensed and quickly pulled away, as if he had burned himself.
What? No! Dean felt the panic rise in his chest. He didn’t want Cas to think that anything that happened between them was about the bet.
Meg: “Hey, you all right? It’s in the middle of the night here.”
"And what do you think Mr Novak?" Dean’s Dad asked.
"What do you mean?"
He was taking suppressants. He shouldn't feel any inner omega at all. Damn it!
"Listen, I don't have the time to explain it to you now. I'm going to pick Cas up from the hospital," Dean said.
"Yes, especially not me. "  Cas said.
Cas sighed. Or maybe Dean was exactly how the omega had thought.
„All I could think about all night was you. To be honest, I haven't been able to think of anything else for the last four months... „
"Dean. . . " Suddenly Cas's body seemed to lose all its tension. Tears ran down his cheeks.
"Fucking hell, Dean. Stop this nonsense. Just a few minutes ago you were annoyed that I had sex with a man and all the time since my confession you have been avoiding me. You were uncomfortable seeing me in my underwear or just a towel after a shower. You couldn't touch me, you. . . " Cas yelled desperately.
The way to the cemetery took Dean nearly an hour.  He knew it was a bit childish and even pathetic to visit his mother’s grave in the middle of the night. But it was not the first time he tried to talk to her in that way. Of course, he was aware of the fact that dead people weren’t supposed to answer, but somehow he always felt better when he told her everything. So, no, this wasn’t the first time. In fact, he always came here when something big happened in his life. Like when Dad tried to change his life or when he was accepted into his dream college or the day when Jo’s dad died and left Ellen and her behind. Jo was only six years old and Dean knew how it felt to lose a parent. Jo was like a little sister to him and he felt so sorry for her.
"I'm sorry you seem to have someone like me as your true mate, Cas. I know you deserve someone better. Not someone. . . like me. A male whore. . . Gabriel told me that you would never. . . "
“Problem?”
Cas couldn't hear the nurse answering. He was far too busy dragging Dean into his hospital bed and kissing him senseless.
"Don't forget that there will be dinner soon and you have to finish packing, Dean. " Ellen exhorted him.
"Dean! Dean! You are here!"
Quickly he hugged and kissed her on the cheek and then he was on his way back to the farm again.
"But seriously. Are you okay, Dean?"
"No, I am not asleep. Come in. "
"Listen, our parents were true mates. Our mother died in a fire when I was less than a year old. Our father was working that night. Dean saved me, but our mother died. He watched our father break down because of the loss. All those years until Dad got a handle on himself again, Dean was my surrogate father. He made sure that there was food on the table, that I had clean clothes, that I did my homework and that I went to bed at a reasonable time.
Dean sighed.
"Okay," Dean nodded.
Dean could only nod. He was too focused on the burning strange feeling. It hurt but somehow it was good as well. The thought that Cas was really inside of him nearly made him shoot his load, though. Fuck, Cas was inside of him!
"Well, he wouldn't be so wrong, Dean. " Charlie said unkindly.
Cas didn't understand what Dean was getting at. That was exactly what he had done. He had bitten Dean.
“Because he thinks you met your true mate and he didn’t want to be in the way.”
„I should head home. I’m sitting in a park like a creep. You should go to sleep as well. Good night bitch.“
Undecided whether he should just sit in the Winchesters' living room or not, he stood in the hallway.
Jo got Sam's laptop from the living room and Dean's brother went straight to work.
Dean could only stare at Cas.
Fuck! This was true. Still, imagining Cas with another Alpha hurt like hell.
"I see. You probably don't need to. I'm sure there are enough people who'd be happy to help you out." Cas knew that Dean would hear that he was upset in his voice but thank God he wouldn’t smell how unhappy the thought made him. The only thing that made it a little bit better was the fact that he wouldn't spend his rut with an Omega… but stop! This wasn’t possible, was it?
“Tell me if I am hurting you,” Dean demanded.
“I am … not okay, but better.” Dean answered.
“Please think, Cas. This was no regular heat. Dean said it was much too early and you went into heat delirium very fast. There is only one explanation.”
In a good mood, he stopped at the parking lot in front of the school building and went directly to the cafeteria to look for Charlie.
The fact that Cas didn't show up for dinner that evening didn't make it any better. Dean's mood was accordingly bad.
Meg: I know and I will be grateful forever, Cas. But please remember that you promised me to tell me if it gets too much or if you meet your soulmate. We can easily get a divorce. I don’t want you to suffer because I want to be a part of the US Archeologie Team. You are my best friend and I don’t want you to get hurt!”
Dean wasn’t able to stifle an unhappy laugh.
With a small wavering smile, Jody looked to her best friend.
„No, of course not! I rarely see him any more.“ Mary's voice was desperate now.
“I know that’s not part of your job but could you be so nice to get us some coffee?”
"Morning, Lisa!" He took the steaming coffee she offered him.
„Yeah, that fits with my deductions. At first, he seemed more flirty but now he is only looking at you the whole time.“ Charlie said.
"Who's cute?" Ellen asked when she entered the dining room holding the turkey in her hands. Bobby followed her with the bowls full of potatoes. Cas and Jo were carrying the beer and the pie.
That was okay. Fortunately, John Winchester didn’t care which first or second gender his children had.
D: Please, Charlie. I need to know he is okay.
And anyway. Dean was not only too young for Mr Novak, the man was definitely too old for him! What should they have in common? Probably the teacher was right if he thought he wanted an equal partner. Dean had never spoken more than a few sentences to the man, but of course, this could never have gone well, even if the teacher hadn't been married. It was good that Dean had taken that step! He knew that it was shockingly radical but it was the right thing to do in this situation. In a few months, Mr Novak would disappear from his life and they would probably never see each other again. He swallowed the panic that grew inside him at that thought.
Suddenly the memory of the last time Cas was in his room filled his brain. The kiss and the confessions. Everything seemed so far away now. Suddenly Dean felt his eyes burn. He stared at his fingers and tried to concentrate. But no matter how hard he tried he wasn’t able to hold the tears back. Quiet they made their way down his cheeks. Fuck! This was more than embarrassing. It was ridiculous. He was ridiculous. Dean felt Cas sit down next to him on the bed.
When Castiel woke up the next morning, the first thing he noticed was how exorbitant hot it was in the room. He tried to wipe off the comforter, but something was holding them in place. Cas opened his eyes. It was still quite dark in their dorm since the curtains were closed, but it was already light outside. The room still smelled like alcohol. Slowly the memories of last night came back. The frat party and Dean's strange behaviour, Cas jealousy because of the pretty Beta girl next to Dean and how he wasn’t able to turn his gaze away from the couple.
"I knew this would happen. Still. . . Mathilda already belonged to my father. I was there when she was born. . ." Castiel's voice broke and Dean wasn't sure if he would start crying. Not that he was one of those guys who thought that strong Alphas shouldn't cry. That was bullshit. Dean just wasn't very good at dealing with feelings. Not with his own, not with anyone else's.
Dean loved it. He wanted to take Cas apart, he wanted the other man to moan his name. He wanted Cas to make those beautiful sounds only because of him and not because of Balthazar. He wanted Cas to be his.
„No! Please, Dad, tell me that this isn’t true. Please!“
“Don’t Charlie me! I am dead serious! You talk to the man or I will. It’s your choice.”
"What?"
Dean needed a few moments to collect himself. Otherwise, he would have spilled the whole load immediately.
“Good evening, Mr Winchester,” Cas said.
„Cas! Fuck! What…“ The Alpha growled surprised.
Dean went downstairs into the kitchen. His father was still asleep, so he filled a plate for Sam, Cas and himself.
Despite all the stress, he also tried to spend time with his soulmate. And more than once the phone was involved. Cas granted Dean the celebration with his friends. Of course, he did. Even though he wished for nothing more than to finally hold him in his arms but he knew he shouldn’t be impatient. Even though it was hard for him. But he would survive this last night. Cas decided to get a beer and some popcorn from the kitchen and make himself comfortable in front of his laptop watching Netflix. When he entered the kitchen, Mr Winchester was sitting at the kitchen table.
Dean couldn't suppress a loud moan.
"You gotta learn to trust him, Dean." she hissed.
What? Did she want to come with him? The idea of taking Lisa with him was nearly absurd. He wanted to be alone with Cas!
Castiel hated the guy from the very bottom of his heart. He was the most arrogant alpha he'd ever met.
When the five minutes were over he returned to Sams door and knocked again.
“Okay, that’s an option.”
"I don't understand the problem. We could just start harvesting early. Then we'll have plenty of time till the weather changes." Dean countered.
"Are you feeling better, Mr Novak?" Charlie wanted to know. She looked concerned.
It hurt like a motherfucker. But somehow it distracted him from the numb feeling in his chest.
"This, however, is an interesting turn of events. " He said.
His conscience hung heavy as his mind recollected his actions clearly.
Dean tried to concentrate on his conversation with Lisa. She was really nice and she was interested. Dean knew he could have her right now, but … he wasn’t interested. For the first time in his life, he wasn’t interested in a hookup. That was a bad sign, a really very bad sign.
"Morning gorgeous!” He gave Cas a radiant smile.
He was straight, for Christ's sake! At least that's what he'd been thinking all his life. But he hasn't been so sure in the last few weeks. He didn't know why he suddenly saw Cas with different eyes, but he recognized that his heart started beating faster when Cas walked through the apartment dressed in only a towel after he had a shower. And Dean suddenly had trouble not touching Cas all the time.
”Fuck,“ he cried.
But of course, he had been cheering too early, because when he looked up, he saw Bela approaching.
Benny grinned at him.
“Knot me… please knot me…!”
The first thing Cas felt when he woke up was that he was incredibly thirsty. It was almost as if he had run through the desert for days without water. The bed next to him was empty, so Dean must have gotten up by now. Somehow he had lost his bearings. He couldn't even say what day it was. Slowly he got up and made his way to the kitchen. Oh, God, he really needed a shower. He felt sweaty and sticky. Besides, he was sore in the most impossible places. But first things first.
“Come in!”
„I know you are afraid. But everything will be okay, Dean. I promise.“
Cas rolled his eyes annoyed.
„I love you… God, Dean, I love you so much,“ Cas whispered.
The Omega let out a shaky breath.
Dean couldn't do anything against the pain that suddenly grew in his chest. Why the hell was his soulmate married? Fuck! Of all the people in the world, he had to have a soulmate who didn't want him. If this hadn’t been so sad, he would have laughed.
The next morning started with bright sunshine and Dean couldn't imagine that it would rain in the afternoon. But he knew that weather changes could happen very quickly. In the morning they mucked out the stable and cared for the animals. The little calf was already running around in the small box, but his mother was still not doing very well. Cas, therefore, decided to feed it himself. Together they started to feed the animal with a feeding bottle. Dean was surprised Cas even owned something like this. It turned out that the poor little creature was very thirsty. Probably the mother was just too weak to produce milk. Thank God Cas had thought of feeding the poor calf.
When Dean bottomed out, he stopped moving because he knew Cas would need some time to adjust.
"By the way. Why did you do that today?" Cas asked as they were almost at their destination.
***Cas***
"As you've heard, I haven’t much time. So what do you want?"
Oh God, how long had he waited to hear those words and now? Now they felt completely wrong. Why would Dean suddenly fall in love with him? That didn’t make any sense at all. Dean wasn't into men.
The kitchen was empty, so it had to be a weekday, and Dean was already at work. He looked at the kitchen clock. 7:15.
"No.... it's still you," Dean confessed without looking at him and a warm feeling spread in Cas' chest.
Dean shrugged, which turned out to be a mistake. Oh god! Was there any part of his body that didn't hurt?
Meg: “Come on, Cas. There is no way anyone could ever hate you.”
„Oh Cassie, you are in love with him, aren’t you?”
At first, he dismissed the whole thing by thinking that he didn't want to raise Cas' hopes unnecessarily and that they had to find their way back to their old relationship. But that wasn't true.
Wantonly she drove her hand under his T-shirt and touched his belly.
“Are you saying you didn't miss me at all?" The other Alpha wanted to know a mischievous grin on his lips.
"Exactly!" Sam replied visibly satisfied.
"And he hasn’t tried to seduce you? I can’t believe that. You have to be exactly his type. Dark hair, blue eyes, a beta. Exactly what he usually wants. "
Wow! Still impressive. Two days in a rut. Poor Cas!
„Dean, I...“
"Then what the hell is it about?" Cas wanted to know.
„Yes, yes. Dean is all right. It’s just… Shit, Cas how much do you remember?“
“This has to work, Cas. If someone deserves to be happy it’s my brother. I believe…”
“You okay, Dean?” Benny asked when he came back, a bowl of chips in his hands.
„I want you so bad, Dean. You have no idea...“ Cas said while he sucked Deans' neck.
“About forty million people are living in California,” Cas said calmly.
This breathtaking man should be his True Mate? Cas somehow couldn't believe it. Cas knew Dean had already noticed him. Slowly the Alpha turned to him and looked straight into his eyes. Suddenly Cas didn't know what to say anymore. How could you convince your roommate that you were meant to be together?
"Oh. . . okay. . . " was all John said.
Dean entered the room and put the tray on the desk.
“Ahm … Dean isn’t… he changed classes…”
He knew he was being stupid. That was the very life he had led before his relationship with Lisa, visiting clubs or bars, drinking alcohol and having too many one-night-stands. Why would he mind if Cas wanted to live like this?
"Would it become mouldy or what's the problem?" He asked.
“Oh, God, you have no idea how much I want you, Cas. I've had to think of your seductive mouth all the way up here. Fuck Cas! I don't know if I will be able to wait till after dinner to get into your pants.” Balthazar whispered between hot kisses.
Suddenly it seemed a thousand times harder to breathe. There were so many questions in his head right now. Dean was an Alpha? Dean was an Alpha! Dean was his Alpha! Cas was one hundred percent sure.
Maybe Balthazar was the solution. Maybe that's what Cas needed right now. One night with hot sex, not thinking about Dean. Cas decided to just jump at the chance. Determined, he returned Balthazar's kisses with all the accumulated passion that burned inside him.
„Yes.“ Was everyone's quick answer.
“Yeah… there… there is some kind of tickling inside of me. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s like a fading anaesthetic syringe after the dentist.” Dean tried to explain.
"I think when we're alone, you should call me Cas. Mr Novak is a little formal, don't you think?"
„Are you planning to watch the whole two seasons in one night?“
"Good morning", Dean said and didn't dare to look Cas in the eye.
"The honour is all mine, Mr Winchester. I'm glad for Sam you didn't call the Omega Health Care Service. I have to admit, I don't associate good memories with the service. "
“Oh, I think it was more than okay, wasn’t it? I think I have to ask Dean what he is saying about his new English Teacher.”
Cas nodded. Okay, if Dean said it wasn't Castiel's fault, then he believed the other man.
“Have fun then, Winchester. You will have a tough time with it.”
Fuck! Dean knew it was crazy, but at this moment he wanted the other man to just bite him, even if this wouldn’t work, even if it wouldn’t form a bond between them.
"Dean, you can't even look me in the eye anymore. You're avoiding to touch me. It seems... it feels like we're just roommates or acquaintances and no longer best friends. I'm. . . I'm not even sure if you really want to be my friend anymore", Cas said, and his voice sounded so desperate that it almost broke Dean's heart.
“I should start,” Dean said and Cas was very grateful.
Meg: Yes, all women need their beauty sleep. Good night, Clarence.
“Oh fuck! Dean, I am so sorry… Cas didn’t find the note. He thought you rejected him…”
“Mine,” the Alpha growled. And then he bit Cas.
"Nothing has changed, Cas. I'm still not interested in men. But I am interested in
Castiel nodded understandingly. He could imagine how difficult their financial situation was. Of course, he knew that this was the reason why they rented the room.
Okay, so here we go    ^.^
The only alpha Cas had to deal with that day was Charlie, who was by no means interested in Cas. She was interested in alphas, female alphas, especially Dorothee Baum. So it was impossible that ...
But Cas had no idea why she did it and why the heck did Dean care? Was this some Alpha territory thing?
There are also certain things in the bag. I'm sure you'll know what to do with them. I'll also put a large bottle of water next to your bed. Please don’t forget to drink from time to time. Dean is shopping right now. I’ll bring you something to eat later. Okay?"
It took them some time to get back from their heights. Dean managed to roll behind him so they were able to spoon.
"The others and I are wondering if you. . . if you told- "
***Cas***
It was nice to see Dean happy for a change. After all the terrible things that had happened in his life, he deserved all the happiness in the world.
Suddenly it was Dean who pushed into him with all his force, not Balthazar. Fuck! Fuck!
Dean looked at him in shock. Of course, the Alpha didn't expect such an emotional outburst, but Cas didn't care.
Completely upset, Cas got up from the bed.
Cas' voice sounded desperate.
"The animals will survive when they get their food half an hour later today. But I won't survive if I don't feel you naked above me right now. The last few nights without you have been hell," Cas replied with a rough voice.
"Put your luggage in the lobby. The boys will bring it upstairs later. I've prepared breakfast for all of us. Please follow me. I will show you the house afterwards. At first, you have to meet my family."
"What if your soulmate is younger and you haven't met him yet? What if he gets his tattoo right now at this moment, but you are already married? "Mary wanted to know.
"Winchester! You behave as if I had invaded your territory, but if you haven’t smelled it yet. Castiel is a beta. Alphas don’t fight for betas. "
"But I don't want to move in with her. The idea of living with her fills me with fear, not joy," Dean replied.
Bobby's speech was hurting Dean. He didn't want to disappoint the man he looked up to.
„Yeah Baby, tell me what you want.“
“So, would you like to start, or should I…” Cas asked shy.
"What are you saying?" Cas wanted to know though he could imagine what Mr Winchester was getting at.
What was that? Why was it so important to her that he would read the essay? Maybe it was something for College or some extra work she had written for his English Literatur class. On the other hand, she didn’t want him to correct it… This was strange. But even if he was curious he had to finish his work at first. So he put the red portfolio in his bag so he wouldn't forget it. Then he got back to work. Whatever Mrs Bradbury thought was so important, it had to wait.
But now Dean was very worried. His father had arranged a marriage with Miss Lisa Braden. Dean had already seen Miss Lisa at some dances and even talked to her a few times. In fact, he found her very charming. He didn't love her though. How could he? He barely knew her. Dean found it unfair that John Winchester was allowed to marry the woman he loved and Dean couldn’t. But his father told him it had to be. Due to some bad harvests and especially due to bad investments, the family was almost penniless. The Winchesters had a good, respectable name, and Captain Dick Roman, Lisa's uncle, who was also her guardian, had become rich as a captain in the war, but had no significant name. So the connection between Miss Lisa and Dean would benefit both sides and that was all that mattered.
When he arrived at the frathouse there was already a lot going on.
"Mr Novak, I... I am so sorry, I didn't. . . "
“Don't tell me that you don't know who he is. After all, you just screamed his name when you came.” Balthazar explained grinning.
„Cas…“
Soulmates, curse or blessing?
“Please just answer my questions.”
"I don't think you'd do anything to endanger me or my farm. But you could put yourself in danger by trying to figure something out on your own. Jody thinks my farm will be burning next."
“Dean…” Her voice was gentle now. “So why do you leave him?”
“Stop! Please wait a minute!” he shouted in panic.
"Are you finally done! Nice! Then let's make one thing straight. This is our common dorm. I don’t wanna smell any happy alpha scent when I come home. If you want to screw around you have to go somewhere else. "
Dean never wanted to end up like his father. Completely broken because of the loss of his mate. When Dean’s mother died, his father basically died too. He never wanted to be emotionally attached to anyone like that. Never!
“Do you mind showing me?” She asked.
He just wanted to check how deep the cut was when Castiel stormed into the kitchen.
“Both” Dean answered.
Without looking at Cas, he stood up, put his dishes away and left the kitchen. Cas suddenly knew that if he let Dean go now, he'd lose him. And he wouldn't survive losing Dean. He couldn't lose Dean. Cas wanted to spend the rest of his life with the boy, wake up next to him every morning, even though he wasn't his true mate. It didn't matter. Dean was his true love even without the bond.
“Oh Jesus! Mr Novak, you look terrible. Are you ill?”
"We should be focusing on you right now, though. I suggest you take a shower while I cover your bed. You'll see how nice the new sheets I brought are.
Cas was only too happy to obey. Grinning, he lay down next to the younger man again.  But the grin immediately vanished when Dean grazed his lubed fingertips over the rim of his hole.
“Cas, I won’t last. Please…I want…I need…”
„Cas! You can’t be serious! I knew my brother would have a freak out after finding his true mate, but he will come to terms. I am sure he will. I know he loves you…”
"Oh, my God! And I thought I was the blushing virgin in this scenario."  Cas cried in surprise.
“You really think you sacrificed yourself for me, don’t you?”
“I wasn't planning on doing that, kid. I didn't expect you to leave Cas and go to school in New York or whatever. But I'm glad you'll at least take classes here," she said and hugged him.
Sam laughed.
Fuck! Fuck! Cas prayed that the ground would open and swallow him.
“Hello, this Donna Hanscum from the Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz. Am I talking to Castiel Novak.?
"You know why. Dean's a Beta, just like you. Betas don't have true mates."
"Stop it, Charlie. There will never be anything between Dean and me. I have no desire for a one night stand and Dean Winchester does not seem to be capable of more. "
Although he knew that she meant well, it hurt. Tears made their way down his cheeks once more. But he knew Meg was right. How long did he want to keep this up? He had to move on! Dean was straight and in love with Lisa and he never would be interested in Cas like that!
So let's go on:
“A little bit better. I cut my finger and… and we think that Cas felt it through the bond.” Dean smiled at Cas. A little hopeful smile. And when Cas smiled back Deans face light up even more. And Cas didn’t know exactly what he was feeling but somehow it felt nice to see Dean smile like that. He could get used to it.
„Morning, boys, Mr Winchester, nice to meet you.“ He said.
"Do you mind telling me what's going on?" Cas hadn't closed Dean's door and now Mr Winchester was sitting right in front of the room in his wheelchair looking at them curiously and also expectantly.
“I would touch you everywhere. I would play with your nipples while I kiss your neck and your shoulders. Then my mouth would follow my fingers to your nipples. I would tease them with my tongue and my teeth.”
Castiel sat down on the free chair next to Sam.
“Please…” Cas was panting very hard now. “Please!”
“Fuck, Cas! Don’t stop! I love you! I love you so much!” The Alpha cried.
Fuck! Now he had to wait even longer! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
"I'm sorry, but my decision has been made. I want to give him more.time . . If you say anything, I'll just deny it. There are no matching tattoos to prove it.”
It was obvious that they both were close already.
The Omega all but run into their bedroom and opened their wardrobe. All of Dean’s clothes were missing. He headed to the living room. Most of Dean’s books his Classic Rock CD’s and some of his DVD’s were gone too.
When he entered the kitchen the next morning, Cas sat at the kitchen table and read the newspaper. A cup of coffee in one hand and an empty plate in front of him.
„Please don’t ever leave me again!” Cas plead.
"You're sorry? Why? What exactly are you sorry for, Dean? That you don't want me although we're probably True Mates? That you're flirting with a Beta girl right in front of me? That you'd rather fuck half the campus than get involved with an Omega? Tell me. . .What exactly are you sorry for!"
“I should start,” Dean.
"Morning, Jo. I don't know where he is. When I woke up, he was gone. " Cas was surprised how calm he was.
The men greeted each other friendly and soon they ate Mary’s wonderful pancakes.
Charlie locked their arms and urged him towards the party.
Cas nodded. Of course, he understood. Finally, everything made sense. He'd have to talk to Dean. Preferably, as soon as the alpha came back from the grocery shopping.
The doctor cleared his throat.
The idea that the Omega was now on its way to buy sex toys for Sammy was weird… He didn’t know how to name it. Strange? Embarrassing?
He would have to break up with Lisa. It wasn't fair to her. Just now he realized why she was always so upset when it came to Cas. Of course she felt that Cas was more important to Dean, even if he never said it. Lisa wasn't stupid!
Castiel believed Dean didn't even know about the whole thing and that he was innocent, but Dean had also proven that he would bear the consequences for his friends if necessary.
"Oh Jesus! Boys! Can't you keep your hands off each other for five minutes?" she scolded them with a frustrated sigh.
„Fuck! I don’t know what to do.“ Cas groaned.
His heart skipped a beat. He looked adorable.
“Mary! This is none of our business!” John interrupted her.
Dean arched his back and moaned.
Ellen's eyes became soft.
On alert, Cas and Dean looked at Mr Winchester.
Oh my God! The nurse on the phone told him that Dean wouldn’t die but maybe he was badly injured, maybe he lost his ability to see or he became paraplegic. In this case, he would fight even harder. Dean wouldn’t want to be a burden, but…
His? His Omega? Where the fuck did this thought come from? But to be honest this was what he wanted right now. He wanted the Omega to be his! All consequences included.
>Cas would never sleep with someone like you.<  Of course, he wouldn’t. Dean must look like a man slut to him, just a horny stupid Alpha that wanted to knot everything that wasn’t able to run away in time. And maybe he was.
"He didn't. Gabriel told me. Dean later told me he harassed you. Now, of course, he's not only afraid to face you again, but also that any alpha could just do the same with Sam. "
Dean could only nod.
Dean felt totally exhausted when he entered the house. All he wanted was to sleep, but after a hot shower, he was refreshed enough to prepare dinner. He opted for Spaghetti Bolognese. It was easy to cook and he didn't have the strength to make something more elaborate. He hoped Cas liked Italian cuisine.
Cas looked embarrassed and …hurt. Why the fuck did he look hurt?
Dean lay down on his bed and rested his cell-phone between his ear and shoulder. He was so hard now. Quickly he removed his pyjamas and grabbed his painfully hard dick. A moan escaped his throat when he pumped his length.
"Jesus, I never thought you'd be so inhibited. Don't tell me you never use sex toys during your rut. "
What did he want him to understand? Cas didn't get it. He tried to wrap his head around all the information to put it together and...
"Mom told me today that Mr Novak never planned to reject his soulmate. He didn't tell me the details because she promised him not to tell anybody, but she was sure he wants to be with his soulmate. Damn it! What am I supposed to do now?"
"How is he?"
“What an absurd thought. Like I could ever regret being with you. You're everything I want, everything I'll ever need. And I never want to be separated from you again. Not one night. “
He just kissed her on the cheek, got his jacket and said goodbye to the others. Then he hurried to his car. He would deal with his relationship mess another time. Now he had to take care of Cas.
“It’s a good thing he is sleeping now. The last two days have certainly been exhausting for him." The Doctor stated.
Dean came one step closer.
"We didn't just buy it with the money from Dad. Cas also had some savings. How will Dad react when he finds out we're getting married?" said Dean.
Cas didn’t believe she was right. When he had presented as an omega, he really couldn’t save himself from offers of horny Alphas. Everyone wanted to try a male Omega. It had taken some time before he realized that this was not about himself but only about the rarity of his second gender. But he couldn’t imagine that he would get much attention as a beta.
Suddenly John's eyes fell on Mr Novak's hands.
„What? What the fuck are you talking about, Sam? It’s not possible to scent bond without having sex.“
Dean Winchester never knotted someone! Never! Fuck! This shouldn’t make Cas so lightheaded and happy. It really shouldn’t. But it did! Fuck, did this made him happy?
It was good to hug her. It was also good that she knew about this fucking shitstory so he didn't have to pretend with her. And he was more than relieved that she wasn't mad at him anymore.
"No, of course not! But when you mentioned he was in California, I thought he was in Santa Cruz. We've wanted to come here together for a long time. We even talked about moving here, because I was offered a job at the local college."
Oh God, yes! Dean was his Alpha! Cas felt it. The bond! Jesus fucking Christ, it worked! He could feel Dean's presence quite clearly. So the Alpha couldn't be far away. And the Alpha was. . . happy.
“I’m just glad he didn’t do the same to you.”
That's when the door opened and Dean came in with a big tray in his hands.
“Dean! Listen. If you bite Cas your soul will always reach out for him, but if... if this doesn’t work the answer will always be just numbness.  This will be much worse than to lose a true mate.”
Cas looked at the gorgeous Alpha on top of him. He was so beautiful it hurt. His skin was flushed and his cock was rock hard, his knot was already forming. Oh God, Cas wanted him so bad.
"Good! Please don't shut me out anymore, Cas. I want to be a part of everything that concerns your life. It... otherwise, it feels like you don't trust me," Dean stated honestly, avoiding looking at Cas.
Cas was completely confused. Why again this Alpha-attitude and why on earth did Cas feel guilty? He needed all his willpower not to go to Dean and calm him down. What the heck...?
“When did you plan on telling me, before or after we slept together and I accidentally bit you?”
When he felt Dean’s knot forming he started to panic for a moment, because… How the fucking hell should it fit into him.  Dean seemed to notice his thoughts because he tried to move away a little bit so his knot wouldn’t be locked inside the Omega. But Cas embraced Deans hips with his legs and pushed him even closer. Maybe this was the only time he would be together with Dean like this and he wanted everything.
his wasn’t fair. What had Castiel done to the world to deserve this?
Fuck! This shouldn't be so hot. But sweet Jesus it was.
The Alpha growled satisfied.
Strange, Dean wondered.
„You could leave College and never see him again. It will take a few years to get over him, but if there is no real bond you could make it.”
“No I can’t remember the name of the pills,” Cas said after he took one sip of the hot liquid.
Cas was talking to the vet for a long time. The cow had survived, but she was very weak. Dean didn't really know much about such things, but even he could tell that her chances to survive weren't exactly good. She had lost too much blood. Poor animal! And poor calf. It was possible that it would lose its mother right at the beginning of its life.
"But that's not possible. Only true mates can sense when their partner is in danger. We are not true mates. I bit you, we would know if..."
"Yeah, yeah, I want that, too," Cas said quickly to wipe the anxious look off Dean's face. He was rewarded with a bright smile that made butterflies swirl around in his stomach. Shit, he was so fucked!
So he grabbed another beer from Charlie's kitchen and went back to the living room. Actually, Charlie had promised to invite just a few friends, but the living room was stuffed with people. He didn't even know them all. Although he knew most of them at least from sight. But to be honest, Dean didn't care. He wasn’t  in the mood to party anyway. Maybe it was a good thing there were so many people at the party because it was easier to go unnoticed in the crowd. He could hardly muster the nerve for small talk at the moment. Not to mention any kind of conversation with Charlie.
He didn't even bother to wipe away the tears which were still running down his cheeks. He must have looked like a picture of misery.
But his roommate was suddenly everywhere and Dean had no chance to ignore him.
Dean laughed and put the tray between them. Only now did Cas realize how hungry he was. Together they ate and talked about everything and anything. About their dreams, about what they plan after college. Both found that they automatically included each other in their future life. They laughed at stories Dean told about Gabriel and Cas learned that Jo was really just a little sister to Dean. The surprise in Dean's eyes when Cas told him that Jo was in love with him was almost funny. And so it was past noon when they finally took the shower. It was amazing to openly look at Dean’s naked body and to see that the Alpha did the same visa versa. They kissed under the spray and their hands roomed curious over their bodies. Cas wasn’t able to tell where he began and where Dean ended. There wasn’t enough time to do much more than to jerk each other off, because Sam knocked on the door.
“We should have our breakfast now, so we can take this shower as soon as possible.” The Omega suggested.
***Cas***
"I know. My brother has always been stubborn as hell. But I'm sure this fact is not new to you."
He just didn't understand what was going on. Dean Winchester never missed an opportunity to get laid. Especially not with a hot woman like Cassie Andrews.
But after a few seconds, Cas started to get impatient again.
"I can literally feel you freaking out," the boy said. "And to be honest, I should be the one freaking out. I was never attracted to another Alpha or any male at all. So this is very new to me. At least you knew you were gay."
"Yeah, she installed security cameras all over the farm. She hopes to catch the perpetrators in the act," Cas explained.
So after dinner, they got ready for bed and Cas realized that his full rejection state had nothing to do with the fact that he wouldn’t be attracted to Dean any more. On the contrary!
"I suggest you call your father. He should have a lot to tell you. You can also prepare him that we have to make a report to the police. The allocation of Relevium to children is strictly forbidden."
Oh yes! Definitely! Castiel agreed in his mind. The thought of having sex with Dean made his heart beat faster, but the thought of having sex with Dean while he was able to feel all of Dean's emotions through the bond was breathtaking.
“You mean… you never… I am your first…?” Cas knew he was babbling but Jesus Christ! The thought that his soulmate never slept with anyone filled him with so much joy.
Without paying attention to the shocked face of his son, John led the Omega into the house directly to the bathroom.
He felt his heart beating incredibly fast, his palms were sweating and his cock was suddenly very interested. Damn! This wasn't the right time to get aroused. They had to take care of the poor motherless calf. And Cas was his boss and he was an Alpha. An Alpha with a boyfriend!
Sorry for the late update, but this week was so busy! I hope you enjoy the next part ^^
She smelled nice. Maybe Crowley was right and it was only because the scent of the pins was synthetic. When she was in front of him she bent her head to one side so he had better access to smell her.
This was all he never wanted. Fucking feelings! But on the other hand, it felt so unbelievably good and right to hold Cas like this. Like he was his.
Mr Novak smiled politely at him. Oh, God, this was his soulmate.
Her name was Cassie, she was beautiful and a beta.
Cas was about to reach for the tray when Jo asked, "Are you together?"
Boyfriend - he loved the sound of that.
Oh, God, it was pathetic. He was pathetic!
“You should wish me luck.”
"Dean was in a car accident. I was still registered as his emergency contact. The nurse wasn't allowed to give me any details, but apparently, he's not in any danger of his life. He is really in Santa Cruz, Charlie. I knew it. "
“Jesus Christ, Cas. Do that again,” Dean demanded breathlessly and Cass chuckled.
This was the moment when something broke in Dean when he knew he wouldn’t be around when the Alpha would be back to continue his Service.
Hell, Dean was only five when Mum died! Of course, Dad’s fate had a big influence on Dean. And now he is afraid he is gonna end up like Dad. He's so afraid of loving someone that he tries to prevent it. Of course, a true mate must scare him to death."
Although the house was already crowded with people, Cas saw Dean immediately. It was as if they were both the opposite poles of a magnet. He stood in a corner and talked to a pretty black-haired beta girl. She flirted with him shamelessly. An inexplicable but all the more violent anger rose in Cas. It was crazy, but he had to take all his willpower not to pull Dean away from her. His inner omega screamed.
After Cas brought the salad to Sam, he decided not to go downstairs again. He wasn’t hungry anymore and he really had no desire to watch Dean flirt with Jo.
“That’s good news. When can we go there? I want our life together to start as soon as possible.”
"Of course, Cas. What do you need? What can I do?"
***Dean***
Dean let out the breath he was holding in. Thank God! At least Sam wouldn’t suffer.
It seemed like a miracle to Cas, but Meg was right. Nothing changed after the confession incident. At least at first Cas thought so. Dean treated Cas like he did before. The only difference was that Dean had more time for him again, since Lisa and he had really broken up. And Cas really enjoyed it but after a few weeks, he noticed that there were changes in Dean's behaviour. Even if they were very subtle.
Smiling, Jody followed her friend into the kitchen. There they met Dean and Cas, making out in front often he fridge. Ellen cleared her throat in indignation.
And Dean fucking Winchester knew, no he expected that everyone loved him.
He felt Cas inhaling sharply. Jesus! If this wasn’t a turn on!
"I don't think so. "  Ellen replied. "You're a male omega. He wouldn't dare. Imagine the negative publicity.I can see the headlines:
“Yeah, isn’t it!”
: Dean Winchester
Cas went straight to work to change the bed, then he filled the water bottle and finally put the bag in the middle of the bed.
When he opened the door to their room, a strong smell of alpha hit him like a hammer. He could barely breathe at first. Shit!
There his mother was already waiting for him with a serious face.
Talking to her was easy. While their conversation, they must have gotten closer, because without Cas noticing, her face was suddenly only a few inches away, and when she suddenly closed the gap between them and Cas felt the pressure of her lips on his, it took him by surprise. How did that happen?
"Dean, your brother will be disappointed..."
"Mr Novak. Glad you’re here. I'm sorry I'm a bit late, but my morning routine takes a little longer since the accident.
Completely upset, Cas got up from the bed. Suddenly all the anger he felt earlier was there again. He longed to punch Dean in his much too pretty face.
Cas moaned. “Yes, yes I am yours!”
The doctor nodded again, obviously pleased with that answer.
„Okay, let’s do it,“ Cas said.
“Yeah, of course. And the tooth fairy does exist.”
„Does he feel it too?“ Dean wanted to know after a while.
“How dare you? You called a service! You are such a fucking stubborn asshole! I hate you! I hate you, Dean Winchester! I hate you so much!”
Then Dean started to kiss Cas' neck and licked over the place where a mating bite would be placed. For some time he just sucked on it and Cas felt that certain regions of his body would be interested in more. How the hell did he get so turned on when Dean was just sucking on his neck? It was crazy!
Shouldn't that be clear if you met your true mate? Damn it! Why did Dean have to make everything so complicated?
“Dean, Cas wanted to get his scent glands removed in a surgery just to be with you.”
Rowena nodded her head and left the room to search for the doctor.
"Okay, let's not talk about it anymore. I suggest you pack up the most important things for the first week at the ranch. I assume you'll take the Impala to drive out, won’t you?" he inquired.
„You wanna know what I think?“ Sam asked after Dean finished.
Dean stared at him with wide eyes, the fear obvious in them.
"I know it was a mistake, Charlie!" he said crunched.
Yeah, maybe Cas was right. Why should Dick Roman care if he would be hurt in the fire or not?
It took a while until both of them were able to catch their breath again. They lay on the couch side by side for quite a while, both still squeezing their knots. It felt so good to feel the other Alpha beside him again, to smell his satisfied scent. Dean was about to burst of happiness. This was the moment when he realized that this wasn’t only a crush, this man was the one for him; he wasn’t only in love with Cas, he was the love of his life! Fucking shit! This was serious, at least for him. But Dean decided to let the thought mature in peace. At the moment he was too giddy to think straight, let alone to talk about serious stuff like this.
>Christ! I need some fresh air< he thought and crossed the room towards the terrace, leaving a completely surprised Bela behind.
Dean giggled at Cas’ impatience but he obliged and started to thrust in and out hitting the other man’s prostate with each drive.
With the plate in one hand and the coffee in the other, he sat down in front of Cas.
Dean looked at him with a frown.
"Fuck! Why don't we learn these things at school? " Dean cursed.
“Come in!” Dean said. He tried not to be too loud because Cas was still asleep.
Dean just nodded. Of course, he was aware that it was unusual for a gentleman to deny help dressing, but Dean had no choice. The scent glands at his neck and wrists would have revealed that he was not only a man but that he also had a second gender. Sir Dean Winchester, son of Lord John and Lady Mary Winchester, was an Omega. Wasn't that wonderful? It was not! Quite the opposite. It was horrible. His mother had been frantic when he presented as an Omega at the age of fourteen. Of course, the true nature of his condition was kept secret from the servants. It was claimed during his first heat that he had scarlet fever. No man in his right mind would have dared to come close to him. So he was taken by night and fog to the abandoned north wing of the estate and his grandmother Deanna came to help him. It turned out she was an Omega as well.
“Okay. Do you want to send for an Omega you know?”
While Cas shook her hand, he noticed two things. First of all, Jo was a beta and incredibly pretty, so she was Dean's type. And number two: she was definitely in love with Dean. Jesus Christ! When he started to be jealous of all the pretty betas around Dean, he had a lot to do.
Although Dean had a hard time saying goodbye to his brother, he was happy to be on the campus again.
Fuck! It hurt so bad. He didn’t want this lawyer to be what Cas always wanted. He could barely stand the thought that this man would be able to give Cas everything he needed. It wouldn’t be necessary to call the Omega Service ever again…
"Good morning Dean", Cas replied.
"What would be the point? He's married and thinks I'm still a child. " Dean said and shrugged.
Cas wasn’t able to hear the last part of the sentence because a sudden pain rushed through him. He knew that something happened to Dean. So he just left Sams room and ran downstairs.
"Lisa, you know you don't have to make coffee for me. I'm not your boss. "
But of course, he would help Dean any way he could. After all, he hoped that in the end, they would stay friends.
Sam read through the article again.
“Oh no, Gabe! Don’t blame your caries on us! I am sure your teeth will be ruined by the tons of sweets you eat on a daily basis.” Cas disagreed.
"Dean, it's not about me. But not only would Mr Novak lose his job, but he could also get into serious trouble if someone finds out he has an affair with a student. "  Mr Winchester explained.
When Cas came back to the hospital about three hours later, he was at least shaved, showered and had something to eat. However, he was still tired as hell. The nurse at the information desk recognized him right away.
”Oh God, Dean!“ the other Alpha cried.
"Yes, I do. My father always told me that it is stupid to like the animals, that they are only meant to produce milk or to be slaughtered. But I was never able to see it like this. They are like family to me, even if this sounds weird." Cas explained.
"You're sorry? Why? What exactly are you sorry for, Dean? That you don't want me although we're probably True Mates? That you're flirting with a Beta girl right in front of me? That you'd rather fuck half the campus than get involved with an Omega? Tell me. . . .What exactly are you sorry for!"
Sorry for the late update but I was on vacation. ^.^
“Sam, go upstairs to Dean’s old room. There must be a note… Where did you put it, Dean?” John said.
At the very back of his heart there was still this little voice screaming desperately and unwilling to admit that there would be no future together with his soulmate. Never! No matter how much he wished for it. He resolutely suppressed that annoying voice. He did the right thing! After all, he didn't want Mr Novak to ever figure it out. Dean didn't want the sorry and compassionate way his soulmate would surely look at him. He didn't need his pity! And he didn't need a soulmate! Dean Winchester was able to live alone. Thank you very much! To be perfectly honest, he always thought he would be alone. There would be One Night Stands but no relationships? No!’+
"Oh fuck! I totally forgot. Shit! That would be more than embarrassing," Dean moaned and laughed at the same time. And for some reason, Cas had to laugh too. The whole situation was so absurd, it was really weird.
"I know, but sometimes it still seems like a miracle that Cas wants to be with me. "
"You didn't reject him because you didn't want him, but because you want more. Am I right?"
Meg: “ So bad, huh?”
"It's the same problem, isn't it?" she asked gently.
„Oh my god. This pie is amazing, Mrs Winchester. No wonder it’s Dean’s favourite.”
Mary Winchester smiled at him.
He nodded and ran his hand over his face. Slowly he got up and escorted the Service Alpha to the door. Then he went to the kitchen to prepare a sandwich and a glass of water for the sleeping Omega and put both on Cas‘ nightstand.
This time Cas didn’t tease him. He grabbed the lube bottle and coated a big amount of the oily liquid on his cock. Then he lined up his cock and slowly started to push in.
"Of course. Don't be afraid to call immediately if something seems suspicious to you," Jody replied.
“Cas, that’s not fair, you know that is not the case. It was hard for him to let you go. That’s the reason why I told him about Balthazar when we thought he could be the one…”
"Of course, alphas are not fighting for betas. That would be ridiculous. Please excuse us, Hannah. I think I'd rather bring Dean home. He just drank too much. "
“Which room?” Cas wanted to know.
That Dean wasn't here to get Cas, spoke volumes. Cas was lucky if his best friend wanted to talk to him at all.
"Yes, that would probably be best. You have to understand. . . after what he did to you, he would never dare to ask. . . “
“Yes, water would be great. Thank you, Mrs Winchester.”
Dean couldn't take it anymore. It was just too much. Cas Scent was no longer sad, but desperate. With quick steps, Dean crossed the room and took Cas in his arms. He would never admit it, but his eyes were also suspiciously burning as he felt Cas relaxing in his arms while inhaling his Scent.
„Hey pal, you look like you could use a drink. Hard day?”
„Ahh… Dean…Fuck“
"Ahem. . . yes. . . . thank you. " Cas replied. Of course, it was a lie. He didn't feel any better. Okay, he wasn't feeling sick anymore, but he felt so empty inside and even next to all these people he felt alone.
"I'm sorry, but I think it would be better if Mr Novak goes upstairs now. "
"Son, Cas inner Omega thinks he is no longer needed and. . . "
"More or less, yeah," Dean said.
When Dean was falling over the edge a few moments later, Cas felt it as well. The sensation of Deans orgasm together with the love confession set him over the edge too. It was only a little handjob but the feeling was so intense. Both men were still shaking when they managed to breathe normally again.
„You... you still want me?“
Without even letting Cas go for a moment, Dean pushed him back to bed so he fell on to it. But Dean didn’t join him at first. He stood in front of him and slowly opened the buttons of his shirt.
Dean had to swallow a big lump. Wow. He hadn’t expected such an outburst.
“Yes, Dean you did. You made it very clear that you are not interested in more than a friendship," Cas snapped.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean-o! All betas on campus are breathing out a sigh of relief that you're back. "He said with a wink.
Charlie was talking herself into a rage. Her face was red and her eyes sparkled.
"I love you too. Oh God, I love you so much," he whispered when they had to separate to breathe. “And of course that's not gonna change even if we're not true mates, Dean."
„Hello, Dean.“ Oh, she called him Dean on his birthday and not sweetheart. Did she know? Fuck! She would kill him!
„Cas… if you want to leave… I’m not sure if I...your true mate… the lawyer…I can’t…”
“Like I would have been waiting until tomorrow.” Dean chuckled quietly and put his head on Cas's chest. Even before the older man could respond Dean had fallen asleep.  With a comfortable sight, Castiel spread the blanket over them. He couldn't believe he was allowed to fall asleep like this every night from now on. Fate had meant it really well with him, and he would take every effort to make Dean see it the same way.
Okay, enough with the negative thoughts.
“I love you too, Dean. I love you so much.”
With a loud moan, Dean pushed his knot inside and came. He was crying Cas name again and again and Jesus fucking Christ! This was so intense!
"Damn Cas. We have to feed the animals," Dean lamented.
They stared at each other the anger obvious in their gazes.
„You know exactly what I mean, Dad! Why did you have to destroy my life?”
"Maybe he doesn’t want to get involved with his roommate. That could eventually lead to unwanted complications. "
There was a pause behind the door and Cas knew that Sam was coming closer to smell if he really was an Omega. After a few moments, Castiel heard the key turning around.
Dean wondered if Cas would be top or bottom and instantly he knew that he would allow his friend to do anything to him at the moment if Cas was with him instead. He would let the other man fuck him without hesitation. Jesus, where did this thought come from?
“No, thank you. I think I can drive.” Cas replied relieved to go home.
But when Cas looked at the Alpha’s eyes he saw it.
"I don't remember everything exactly. Weird, I'm not hungry at all. Shouldn’t I be hungry after two days, Doc? "
“Yes, sir,“ Dean answered quietly.
“And as for moving out, we'll be gone in a few days, Ellen," he added, addressing Ellen.
„What…?“
“Mrs Harvelle I…”
"Rovena will draw blood from you. As soon as I get the results, I'll let you know. Ah. . . and maybe you and your mate should get dressed. There are two policemen waiting to talk to you. I've been able to put them off for the last two days, but they're getting a little impatient. Oh, and your brother's waiting outside the door as well. "
“Dean, I never planned to destroy…”
"Dean Winchester! You know I love you, but sometimes  you are the most obnoxious and  stupid person I know and I can't bear to even look at you right now!"
When Cas arrived at the party, he was very nervous. He had arranged to meet Charlie a few blocks away so he wouldn’t have to enter the house alone. Now he saw her standing at the corner, waving at him.
Dean didn't answer. He kept looking straight ahead at the road. His hands clasped tightly to the steering wheel.
Hastily both slipped out of their T-shirts and pants so that they could lie down on the bed dressed only in their underwear.
"I don't know what happened to you, Dean, but please believe me when I tell you it gets better... Ben's father is an Alpha. I was just six months pregnant when he met his true mate and left me right there. It took me three years to be ready to go on another date. I know it's a long time, but whatever it is, it gets better. "
"Cas, please … get inside of me…" Dean begged.
It took some time until the euphoria slowly ebbed away and his breathing calmed down again. The first feeling that went through him afterwards was disappointment and frustration that the bond didn't take. Even though Cas knew this was unlikely from the start, there was nothing he could do about the fact that his disappointment almost physically hurt him. He never should have listened to his brother's stupid gossip and got his hopes up. True mates! This was bullshit. The reason he was always able to smell Dean's scent had nothing to do with true mates. There must be some other logical explanation. What was really bad, though, was the fact that Cas had slept with his employee. Fuck! Dean was a teenager for fuck's sake. Jesus! What was he thinking?
Castiel nodded in agreement. Why not? He certainly didn’t feel well watching his roommate flirting.
Cas sighed deeply, closed his suitcase and kissed her on the cheek.
After all, he worked his sentence here while the others had a nice summer and Cas was more than sure that Dean's so-called friends were at least as much to blame for the fire in his shed than Dean.
Slowly Dean guided his finger inside. The sensation was insane. Cas always loved to bottom and to be prepared but this was a completely new level. His heart was pounding fast and all the air was leaving his lungs so he had to gasp.
“No, I am a real Beta, Dean. I always felt like a Beta.”
"…spring. I asked Cas last weekend and he said yes. Can you believe it?"
To be honest, Dean wasn’t. He was afraid, terrified even. Afraid of what he would feel after the mating. But this was the only way. There was no going back now.
“Yes,” A sob escaped his throat.
He didn’t wait for an answer.
Afterwards, Dean headed to the bathroom to bring a first aid box. They cleaned up their wounds with antiseptics and bandaged them. It was good to have something to do to distract him.
Cas and Sam always came first. And this fact wouldn't change now, even if it broke Dean's heart.
“Come on, they're all just romantic fairy tales,” Cas replied in frustration.
A moan escaped his throat and he tilted his head back, baring his neck. He was really surprised that his inner Alpha was so on board with the idea of being scented by another Alpha.
„Jo, stop it…“ John interrupted her.
I hope you enjoy it!
“Oh, fuck, fuck," Castiel cursed.
Here is another chapter. I hope you enjoy it...^.^
***Dean***
Thank you all so much for your nice comments. They mean the world to me ^-^
"I'm afraid to tell you that it will take about two weeks until we're halfway back in control of your hormone levels."
“Oh my God, Cas! That’s insane and you know it. A few million people must live there. How are you ever gonna find him?“
Dean could only stare after him.
Fuck!
“Harder, harder! Please, Cas…” the other man cried and Dean could only agree.
“Come on, kid. Don’t fuck with me. I don’t want a true mate! No one should want one. Having a true mate will only hurt you in the end.“ Dean responded.
Castiel opened the door to his new room trying to balance the moving box and his bag in one hand.
When he felt tears prick in his eyes he paid his bill and left.
I can't believe it's over! Thank you all so much. Your comments cheered me up all the time! It was amazing! <3   <3   <3
„You! I want you. Dean, please… I need you“
And then as if he gave up fighting it, Dean pushed Cas against the wall with a deep growl.  Hungry he pressed himself close to the Omega. Fuck! Cas was already harder than he could ever remember. Slick was slowly dripping down his tights.
When his mother entered the kitchen with the new lodger, Dean's heart almost stopped.
„What?“
Whatever! He had more important things to do now than to think about the colour scheme for Omega-shops.
"You can't just say things like that. You're driving me crazy..."
"I was in Lawrence and. . . "
"I'm going home today right after lunch," Dean said without wishing him a good morning.
Cas had to laugh.
"I'm afraid that's not possible. At night, the cut grass absorbs too much moisture. We'll have to wait until at least noon to start. The hay has to be dry."
“Shhht. I am here and I won’t leave you.” The Omega reassured him and kissed the tips of his fingers.
"Dean, you have to tell him. Mr Novak looks so sad. . . "
Sam left and Dean tried to wake up Cas. Like always it wasn’t easy. It was adorable how grumpy the Omega was at first, but the Coffee and the Donuts lightened up his mood immediately.
"Dean, I... "
"You're not seriously telling me you've never knotted anyone, Dean?" Cas's expression was surprised, almost shocked.
“You are sure about this Dean, aren’t you?” The Omega asked one last time.
Did the alpha really think he could seduce Cas with that? WTF? Did shit like that work normally?
Then Dean pulled his jeans and boxer briefs down.
Okay, he might have lied about his second gender a little bit. Male omegas were extremely rare and Cas was sick of being a curiosity.
Castiel squeezed his hand. He could imagine how terrifying it must have been for Dean to think that he had lost someone in a fire again.
“Hey, Dad! It's two pm.”
“Oh God, we can only hope, but for now it is something, isn’t it?”
"Oh yes, I love his wife's salad. How is she, by the way?" Ellen wanted to know.
***Cas***
"You gotta be kidding me. Christ, Dean. We are so stupid. Bite me now, please bite me now!" Cas said.
"You're not trying hard enough, kid. I swear I love you, but I'll light a candle in the next church when you finally live on your own again!" Ellen shook her head and got a beer for Jody from the fridge.
Dean punched Sam's upper arm!
"I know, but I have to try. "
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, I just wanted to prevent…” his father tried to explain.
“Would… would you touch yourself, Dean? I want… I want to listen to you while….”
“I’d never do it with an omega… Never.” Dean quickly promised.
Alpha arousal?
“I won’t take the ….”
On the fourth day, Dr Crowley frowned when he looked at him.
Dean had picked Charlie up in the morning and together they drove to Lawrence. Rowena didn't seem very surprised to see Dean again so soon.
Fuck! He was so screwed!
Dean stopped with any intentions he had towards Cas immediately after he found out about Cas’ second gender. No seductive looks, no shirtless moments, no sexual innuendoes. Cas felt as if he suddenly had a completely new roommate. Dean started to be a real gentleman, polite, courteous but also reserved. With all his will Cas tried to persuade himself that this was a good change. But no matter what it didn’t work. He wasn’t sure why, but somehow he always felt hurt, when Dean flirted with someone else than him.
Cas rushed into the house and Dean stayed with the calf to feed it in the meantime. Luckily, at least the little motherless creature was doing fine.
“Fuck me! Now! Please, I need you to fuck me!“ He ordered impatient.
"Jesus Dean! Fuck!" he cursed.
“Yeah, of course. He is in one of my engineering courses. Gabriel told me that you need to get laid badly.”
This felt so good and Cas' moans made it so much better.
Dean had no idea how he was going to survive this anymore. Cas was so fucking reserved and polite. It was unbearable.  At least that's how Dean felt. But his soulmate didn't even try to kiss him once. To be honest, Dean felt more like he was partially avoiding him. Although, of course, that wasn't true. They often sat together in the living room and talked or watched a movie. Or they planned the move to Pontiac together. All in all, Dean had, of course, no reason to complain. They must have been together at least two hours a day. Never alone, though.
Cas wasn’t able to answer. His own orgasm was crashing through his whole body like a storm. Without being touched his cock spilled white stripes on his belly and chest.
"No, listen. This isn't about you two. It's about Dean's little brother Sam. "
". . . but your thoughts are with your soulmate. I know Dean and I understand. When are you planning on talking to him, Dean? It's Friday today. You know I said I would give you time until Sunday, then I'll take care of it. "
The burger tasted incredibly good and Castiel recognized that he was hungry. However, he still couldn't get himself to eat the second one. Dean didn't seem to have much appetite either. Shouldn’t a young man his age be hungry like a wolf? Charlie and Sam, on the other side, ate like horses. They were nearly fighting over the salad and the fries.
John giggled.
"Wow," Dean said when both of them were able to breathe again. "If I'd known it would be like this with an Alpha, I'd have tried this sooner. Fucking hell, Cas. I never came this hard before."
"And you will do your job more than carefully for all the trouble you've caused the poor rancher. Do you understand me, boy?" Dean hadn't even noticed Bobby had come into the kitchen, too. His adoptive father glared at him harshly.
"No." Cas answered sadly.
Finally, Dean slipped out of his boxers.
Cas felt the fear slowly creeping up on him. Something was so wrong.
And now the time had come for him to realize that the little voice was right. He wasn't good enough for Cas. Somewhere out there was Castiel’s true mate. Dean was not allowed to stand in the way of the Omega’s happiness. He had no right to put his own needs above Cas's.
“No, there's no school tomorrow.” John was smiling at him. “I have to say that I am proud of you and Dean. I am aware that it wasn’t easy to follow my order during the last four months.”
But the bathroom was also empty. He frowned in confusion. If only he could remember something. But his brain was still refusing service. So he put the coffee maker on and took a shower afterwards.
“Charlie, please tell me where he is. I have to talk to him. Oh God. I’m such an idiot. I didn’t want him to call the Omega Service. If I wouldn’t have been so stubborn I wouldn’t have ended in a heat delirium. It’s all my fault. I…”
Charlie smiled at him. Dean was sure she knew what was spinning around in his head. She always did.
“Wouldn’t it be better to talk to Cas. It will be a shock for him when his mind is clear again and he realizes…”
"I... I don't think you're a male whore. I…“
The Alpha was looking at him with heavy, half-lidded eyes full of desire.
"Wow, is your heat over yet? That was quicker than expected. " Cas said.
Dean let go of Cas cock and started to lick between his butt cheeks. He spread them with relish and drove his tongue around the rim of the hole. Oh, God, this would be his end. There was a rush in his ears, his heart was beating so fast.
"No, it’s okay, thanks, Donna. "Dean said and waved her goodbye.
When Cas thrust a second finger inside, Dean was already squirming. Then Cas found the special point inside of Dean that had him see stars.
The air was heavy with their combined scents, Dean's own mixed with campfire and chocolate, and Dean found it harder and harder to think. All he knew was that Cas wasn't close enough and that he was wearing way too many clothes. And fuck...this was all happening way too slow. He had to feel Cas’ naked skin on his own like yesterday. Eager, he reached for the other man's wet T-shirt and pulled him closer to finally kiss him. Cas instantly sank against him and buried his hands in Dean's hair, immediately returning the kiss.
The doctor raised an eyebrow because of Deans outburst, but he didn’t care. The thought of touching another Omega than Cas made him feel sick.
Cas sighed. So, their conversation would have to wait.
”No one asked you to suddenly lick my scent glands.”
Cas lifted his head to look at the other Alpha.
Dean gave him a quick look. Cas was a virgin? He was a virgin! Dean didn't understand why this new information made him so happy, but he felt a warm feeling spreading in his chest.
"If everyone's here, we can celebrate Dean's birthday. "
Dean reached for Cas's T-shirt and pulled him closer. Then Cas felt Dean's lips on his and it was so good to finally be allowed to kiss his soulmate. Wantonly he pushed Dean even closer to himself and opened his lips with a moan to let Dean in. Dean's tongue ravished his mouth hungrily until they were both gasping and panting.
He'd manage the situation somehow. The most important thing was that he didn't completely lose Dean.
Dean’s eyes rolled back in his head and his back arched as he came, spilling his release all over himself. A moment later his pleasure was intensified as he felt Cas' knot expanding inside of him, locking them together, creating a pleasant pressure against his prostate, prolonging his orgasm. Just when he thought the pleasure would recede, he felt Cas' seed filling him up, making him feel more sated than he could ever recall being.
“You know my cousin?” Castiel groaned.
Before he knew what was happening, Cas manhandled him onto one of the hay bales and kneeled between his legs.
Of course he knew that his disappearance would raise questions, but he would simply claim that the fact of having to find a new roommate had upset him. Even if Cas had not been hopelessly in love with Dean, the news would certainly have shocked him. So he had a right to just sneak off and be mad at Dean. So he tiptoed out of the house and drove away in his car.
Why would Dean say something like that?
Dean's dad smiled faintly.
On Friday morning of the following week, Dean noticed that the tractor was broken. Damn it! He had just fixed the stupid vehicle! It occurred to him briefly that someone might have sabotaged it. When he looked into the engine to see if he would be able to fix it, the suspicion increased. Fuck! Dean went looking for Cas. He found him in the stable with the calf.
This guy had the most amazing blue eyes Dean had ever seen.
“Fuck, I’m… fuuuck!” Castiel cried and this was it for Dean.
“I don’t think we need a condom. Except you think you are not clean.” Dean said, biting his lips.
Dean had never seen Gabriel so surprised and somehow ... shocked at the same time.
“Yeah, but he married someone else.”
Cas felt Deans knot swelling inside of him.
“I missed you so much… Cas, I…” Castiel felt him shaking. Fuck! Was Dean crying?
I hope you'll enjoy  ^.^
"I know but there is nothing I can or want to do against it. I found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with," Dean replied not letting Cas out of his sight.
“No, Gabe. I don’t need your money. I got everything I ever wished and more.”
"Do you feel like coming to Lawrence with me tomorrow?"
"Oh, we're going through Dickens now. Right now we're dealing with the bad guys. Today, for example, we will take a closer look at Uriah Heep," Cas explained.
“But Mom, he is married…” Dean whispered. A cold shiver ran down his spine.
"Wha ... Dean what the fuck are you talking about. I did not ... "
Cas knew that the connection between them was strong, but still, this shouldn't be possible. They might be in love, but they weren't true mates after all. Maybe the other Alpha just suspected that Cas was in danger? Everyone had assumed that Dick would strike at some point. Dean shook his head.
Every sense was focused on the Omega in front of him. There was no turning back.
“Wow, you are really determined.”
Cas immediately washed off the blockers on his neck and swallowed the little yellow pill to remove the blocker entirely. When Cas came out a few minutes later, they already worked, because… Oh my god! Dean’s smell was divine. How should he survive this without begging the Alpha to take him right then and there? Dean’s eyes also widened. Did he smell how attracted Cas was to his scent? Fuck! Probably Mr Winchester smelled it too because he looked surprised from one man to the other.
Once the packing was finished, Dean slumped lazily across his bed. Shortly after, the doorbell rang. Dean knew immediately that it had to be one of his friends when Ellen sounded pissed when she called him to come down.
“Cas….” Dean asked a bit louder.
"I won't," Dean promised knowing it was true.
“Cas…”
"Are you sure you want to do this?" Cas asked again.
Not really paying attention to his surroundings, Dean nearly stumbled over a bucket as he entered the small bunk to help Cas feed the calf. Thankfully Cas was able to prevent him from falling. Fuck! That was embarrassing. Dean felt like he was a stereotypical Omega in most romantic movies, protected by the arms of a strong Alpha. But he was no damsel in distress for fuck’s sake. He was an Alpha himself. But why the hell were his knees so weak now? And why did it seem like this intoxicating scent came from Cas? This was impossible! Alphas weren't able to smell other alphas.
"What's this alpha shit? Stop acting like you own me. I can do what I want and with whom I want!"
"I have something to eat for you. "
The first time on this unfortunate morning Cas saw the Alpha smiling. And a little bit of hope was shown on his face.
When Cas woke up and opened his eyes, he noticed several things at once. One: wow, he was still alive! This was both gratifying and surprising. Two: he was in a hospital. Three: his leg hurt terribly and his head was throbbing like crazy. And last but not least: Dean was sitting next to him on an uncomfortable-looking chair. The other Alpha was sleeping. He must have been completely exhausted if it was possible for him to fall asleep in this awkward position.
"I don't know. I'm busy and he has to see Dr Shurley anyway, since my mother's death. . . . . "
Charlie opened the door. She hadn't spoken a word to him since the party, although he had apologized to her a hundred times. But who could blame her? It was a dick move to leave his own party.
Dean didn't answer. He kept looking straight ahead at the road. His hands clasped tightly to the steering wheel.
“I know after your break-up with Lisa...“
“Oh my God! Is he injured? How bad is it? My flight goes in three hours. I…”
Unfortunately, the next day it turned out that it wasn’t that easy. Of course, it wasn’t. Why did he even think about this possibility for one second?
***Dean***
Dean: Need to show you something!
"Yes, thank you very much." Cas answered and sat down at the table. Even though Mr Winchester was in a wheelchair, he took care of cooking and other household chores. Castiel thought it was admirable that he didn’t give up.
“You should go to sleep now. Thank God you won’t remember anything tomorrow.” Cas said, shoving him to his bed.
Dean didn't get to finish the sentence.
“Nobody says we have to wait till after dinner…” Cas answered with a husky voice.
Expectantly, the Omega looked at Dean.
“Mr Winchester I am worried. I am not sure if it’s because of the pills or something else but your hormonal level is disastrous. I am sorry but we need to act. We need to provoke a rut.”
With a last longing look at Dean, Cas left the room and Dean was alone again.
"Police Department, Jody Miles speaking. What can I do for you?" she answered the call.
She greeted him with a knowing smile.
“What do you mean by that?" Cas frowned.
Gabe was already in the room.
"We didn't deliberately set the barn on fire, Bobby. It was an accident. " Dean defended himself.
The doctor explained.
Dean nodded and climbed on the bed.
“Baby, you look so beautiful like this, falling completely apart…I could do this all night.”
"We'll see that later," Dean answered.
“Come in!” The younger Omega said and Cas entered the room. He knew the room should smell of Omega arousal because it was obvious Sam was in the middle of a wave, but he still smelled nothing.
Cas couldn’t believe it! What was going on? Why did Charlie mark him with her Alpha scent and why for heaven’s sake was Dean behaving so pissed?
Dean's dad smiled faintly.
"Aww, Dean! That's almost cute. " The Beta teased him.
"That's right. But it’s j because he's scared, though. " Sam tried to explain.
Relieved, Dean stopped.
„Ahh… Castiel…Fuck“
"I can't understand why you're not attending to English literature this year, Dean. It sounds exciting. "
„Didn’t you recognize Deans reaction when we had our first breakfast together, his pained look? And now he is avoiding him as much as possible. Nearly every day he is at Charlie's. He even changed his English class. He loved English literature. Now he attends Englisch writing.“
So, here comes the smut. But I am sorry this isn't over yet. Dean wouldn't be Dean without a little freak out after sex. And of course, we need Castiel's point of view!    ^-^
"Don't stop! Please don't stop!" Dean groaned and kept rocking his hips back and forth. Within moments Dean's breath hitched and he spilt over Castiel’s hand again.
Dean clung to him like never wanted to let go again.
Cas tried to smile back.
"Dean wait!" he yelled.
"Cas' brothers bought us a caravan to attach to the back of Cas' truck. We'll live there. This way I don't have to drive there every day to look after the animals and we can start rebuilding the stables and eventually the house. Thank God all the animals survived the fire because Cas saved the calf and all the others were in the pasture, so far enough away. So the first thing we need is the stables for the colder season and also for sick animals or when a cow gets a calf," Dean explained.
They were at Charlie's birthday party when Lisa announced the happy news. Everyone cheered and was happy for the couple. For Cas, it was like a punch in his stomach. It was like all the air was sucked out of his lungs. He wanted to leave as soon as possible. Unnoticed by the others, he sneaked away. It was a miracle that no one noticed him, but everyone was so busy with Dean and Lisa's news. So, fortunately, no one paid any attention to him.
“Problems to fall asleep?" Dean's dad wanted to know. “Maybe a little. I just wanted to grab a beer and some popcorn and watch a few episodes of Doctor Who. It's not very late yet and there's no school tomorrow.”
“I love you Cas! I love you so much!” Dean cried out and then he was spilling inside of Cas.
Fuck! Dean supposed he should feel repulsed by or worried about the other Alpha's plan, but holy shit was he on board with the idea. Just the thought of what Cas was going to do with the cream made it difficult for Dean to breathe. Jesus!
"Dean, if you want, I can help you finding a new roommate. . . " Cas suggested
“You guys going to the party tonight?” Ash asked them.
Cas grinned at him, coating one finger with a considerable amount of hand cream, then started to rub at his hole.
"The honour is all mine, Mr Winchester. I'm glad for Sam you didn't call the Omega Health Care Service. I have to admit, I don't associate good memories with the service. "
"Jo, this is Cas. He is here to help Sammy because he is an Omega himself. "
“Cas…”
"Bullshit! Dean won’t mind." Sam said enthusiastically.  Cas liked Sam. The boy reminded him a lot of himself when he was younger. In the short time since Cas lived at the Winchester house, Sam was the only one he had talked to for longer. John Winchester also spoke to him more often, but it was just small talk. Cas was able to talk to Sam about literature. And although he was only fourteen years old, he already had an incredible understanding of literature.
Fuck! The view was breathtaking. Dean has always been well built but now with a knot that was about to form… Jesus fucking Christ!. Cas could have had all this for years if John Winchester hadn't messed with them. Dean moved a little bit away from Cas.
"Could you set the table, Jo?" he asked her.
"You must try one slice, Mr Novak! This is Dean's favourite pie. " Sam tried to convince him.
Mary answered for her son.
"Yes, I think I should go. Ellen's already mad at me. Take care, man. " They both climbed out of the car.
"Mr Winchester, there are no alternatives to Relevium."
"Oh, God no! Please tell me this isn't true, Meg," Castiel begged in shock.
Fuck! He hated his father even more at that moment. What did he put him into? Dean didn't want to take the suppressants anymore. He wanted to be an Alpha. But there was no way he would involve Cas. The Omega was tied to another Alpha. So he had no choice but to consider the Alpha Service.
DEAN FUCKING WINCHESTER WAS WINKING AT HIM!
“He is in heat… it’s so bad and strong and it is too early…the… the Servicealpha thinks it’s triggered by… by his true mate. And… and I think he is right.”
Dean knew he was getting a little bit tipsy. Maybe he should take it a little slower. But on the other hand, it was his birthday party. No one would expect him to stay sober.
Dean would allow Cas to fuck him? Oh God, yes, he would. At the thought of Cas being inside of him, he nearly dropped over the edge. But he didn't want it to be over so soon. He wanted to fantasize to Cas wonderful sounds even longer, even if the excited grunts of the other man were disturbing. Dean just managed to dismiss them.
This was the worst thing that ever happened to him. He would end like his father, a broken alcoholic.
He'd never lost his temper and knotted anyone before!
“You already planned everything, didn’t you?”
When Cas was at the hospital nine hours later, he was completely exhausted. The worries about Dean paired with the last weeks and the stress of the flight had cost him all his strength. Now he stood in front of the information desk in the entrance hall of the hospital and was terribly nervous. He cleared his throat.
