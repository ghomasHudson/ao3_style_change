All the breath in his lungs is stolen away, as his chest squeezes so tightly that he sways to the wall in order to steady himself. There's a sharp pain running up and down his left hand that makes him double over. He overestimates his strength because he does not realize that he can no longer hold up his body anymore. He cries out as he stumbles to the floor. He hears Peter shouting for him and at F.R.I.D.A.Y but his mouth doesn't respond to his command of "Open up so I can tell Peter not to worry".  His tongue is too heavy and he can feel himself fading. His last thought is of Peter, who he knows will never recover from seeing him like this.
"Can I ask a question?" Peter asks, and Tony glances at him, watching the way he twists his hands together nervously. Sometimes, he swears that he sees so much of Steve in Peter, from that churlish sense of humor to that tenacious sense of justice. Sometimes, he lets himself think of how much Steve would like Peter.
"It's okay" the man whispers and Tony doesn't say anything as his friend helps him put on the watch.
"Look at you" she whispers, taking in his features, her eyes skating across his face free of acne now that he's free of puberty. He's wearing contacts, since his glasses are too bothersome at times, and his curls are so long, it reaches his forehead. He's not handsome like Stark men are supposed to be, but he's pretty like a Carbonell.
"I loved you!" Tony yells, his eyes frantic behind his glasses while Steve bodily flinches. Because of course Tony would use such a word to hurt him. Of course he would use the one word they never had spoken aloud to each other, as a weapon.
He doesn't tell Peter this though. He doesn't announce that he had once shared intimacy with Steve because their relationship had never been public.
Tony, who had given his driver the night off, had decided to walk back to his hotel. A mistake he will never make again. He had been ambushed, by that sad pleading voice, the one that made him stop, even when F.R.I.D.A.Y  begged him to leave.
"I made cookies" she tells him and Tony jolts when he realizes that she's talking to him. "Chocolate chip" she adds and Tony nods. Because he has no idea as to why she's telling him this.
It was his grandfather's watch, his mother's father he means. The only thing he had to pass down to his daughter, a man who had no other riches to offer his headstrong daughter who left Italy determined to 'make it'. When she arrived on American soil, she made sure to shed any hints of her Italian accent and went to work for one of the largest companies in the country, where she met one of the richest men in the world. The rest as they say, is history. She always carried her father's pocket watch, claiming that it was her lucky charm.
Steve is running. Since he last saw the news and got on a plane to New York, Steve has been running. He's sprinting down the hospital hallway, dodging people as he weaves around the mayhem so that he can make it to room 101.  The adrenaline and the fear urges him on until he's made it to the room. He skids to a stop when he sees a young boy crying into the shoulder of Pepper whose face is red as her blouse, who glares at him when their eyes meet. Rhodey who is talking to Happy, frowns as the other man looks at him with a murderous expression on his face.
"Congratulations" he says instead and Tony tenses but covers it up by sipping his juice.
"Love ya kid" Rhodey says and his lips twitch as they board the opening elevator and Tony's spine stiffen as that pretty teenager, the one with red hair, too dark to be fiery, that reminds him of spilt wine and pouring blood, steps out into the hall, her eyes wide when she sees him. She's openly gaping at Rhodey and Carol, who don't hide their amusement, even cheekily waving at her before the doors close.
When a passerbyer stares at them too long, Natasha is the one who pulls them apart.
"You've been quiet" Peter says after a minute of staring at each other. Tony's trying to pinpoint the exact second he saw Peter move from just this good but kind of naive kid who needed all the help he could get or else he would die (And Tony had enough blood on his hands and did not need this kid joining the party), to a capable young man who he would gladly take a bullet for.
He flips off Dr. Snobby and blushes up a storm when he nearly trips  in his haste to get away.
Steve hasn't seen him in four months and now that he has, he stays far away, just so he can look at him. He's gain back the weight he lost, there aren't any dark bags under his eyes anymore and his left hand has stopped shaking. He's wearing his hair lighter though, and he notices that he has it paired with  thin framed glasses. "You gonna keep staring at me?" He asks as he looks away from the night's sky and Steve feels the smile tugging at his lips.
He can feel another migraine nipping at his skull.
"Don't say that" Steve says, his voice taunt and hoarse. "I have never once regretted our time. I've always cherished every moment that we had together" he confesses before pulling away. They don't say anything for awhile,  and when he sees red hair blowing in the wind, he knows their time is up.
"Not tonight" Tony sighs and grips onto the glass tighter. When he moves to run for the third time, Steve stops him, with a light grasp of the wrist.
"Hello Antonio" Wanda speaks up and she's looking at him now. Tony nods as the Russian glances at him from the corner of his eyes.
He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, doesn't create anything in the lab, instead he just sits in his room and stares out at the city beneath them.
"Did he call? " Tony asks and freezes when a knock echoes in the dim light of the rising sun. His wide eyes turn accusingly at Jarvis.
Steve loves school. He doesn't get why others must hate it so much. "It's because you're a nerd" Clint says without any malicious intent as they meet him and his sister at the gates. Natasha slaps him behind his head and smiles sweetly at Bruce who totters up to their little group. Bucky and Sam are laughing at Clint, shoulder to shoulder. With the two of them, half of the time, he doesn't know if they hate or love each other. There's a large group of people gathered at the gates, hoping to get a glimpse at the elusive Stark who as it is announced, would be joining their school. Steve, who had wished and prayed for their last semester of school to be quiet, had been sorely disappointed.
Steven.G. Rogers is a fool.
Before everything, Tony used to like being around people, hell he thrived on the company of others.
Pity feels heavy.
Who is frowning at him.
"But I never did" is pressed into his clothes and Tony nods.
Instead he tells him "It was just a feeling. A thought that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her".
Tony laughs as he shifts his legs so that they are resting on the bed behind Steve and he opens his eyes to see that they're almost eye level for once.
That’s the Stark in him.
"I'm sorry" she mumbles and Tony just raises his hand to her shoulder. She looks like she's just discovered that her puppy has just died.
"I think it's a nice statement, don't you?" Tony states as he sips on his orange juice, smacking his lips loudly at the bored look on his father's face. "The sociopath of a Stark, who couldn't shed a tear at his mother's funeral finally decides to join the rest of plebeian society, in a move that stinked of desperation on his family's part to make the boy seem more human" Tony reads from memory, courtesy of an online blog he read, once it had came out that Anthony Edward Stark would attend his last semester of high school in a local school.
"A few months, give or take" Tony replies and the man frowns, almost as if he is expecting something sharper from the smaller man.
"Business?" The man asks as Tony takes out the ear bud from his right ear.
"It's in our blood. A curse from generation to generation that makes sure that no one can remain in love with a Stark" his father had hissed at him, on the night that his father always observed, a sort of mourning for the great Captain that had fallen, on the night when Tony had bothered to check on the old drunk.
"Yeti?" Clint asks, since he had placed his hearing aids back on.
"Will you ever call?" He asks, and Tony glances over his shoulder. "I... Tell me you'll call" he whispers, his eyes suddenly glittering in the dim lights. The Captain reaches out but stops before his fingers can touch his wrist. He pulls away, and twists his hands together in an effort to keep them busy.
"Good morning, sir" is the first thing he hears as he slips out of his dreamless slumber. The first thing he sees? It's his family butler, Jarvis as he stands dutifully at the foot of his bed, with a silver platter of breakfast.
"I don't know. Maybe Bruce" he says with a cheeky shrug. He yelps as Steve stands, carrying all of Tony's weight with him, as Tony clutches at sturdy shoulders and wraps his legs tighter around that trim waist. "Asshole" Tony hisses when he feels the laughter vibrating through the man. He freezes when plump lips presses a light kiss on his sensitive neck.
The boy scribbles something on his own yellow note and slides it across to Tony.
And because he is a fucking idiot, the first thing he says is "Why didn't you cry for your mother?"
He goes to walk away, when that voice pipes up again.
"Yeah well, Vision has been feeding us" he says and he rolls his eyes as the man beams at him. Fucking beams. Who the fuck beams?
"Don't stop fighting" Carol tells him and she presses a kiss to his forehead as they pull away from each other.
"Time to go" she says and they follow after her, sliding back into the shadows as they came.
He looks so small, Steve thinks. He looks so vulnerable, hooked up to so many noisy machines, eyes closed and hands clasped on his stomach. He's lost the weight that he had gained, and the stress had taken it's toll on his face. He's jaunt in a way that makes Steve ache. He sits down on the chair next to his bed, the ugly orange plastic creaks with his weight and the force in which he had thrown his body. He takes a long exhale as he watches him. He watches the dainty way his long eyelashes flutter like butterfly wings as his eyes keep moving behind closed eyelids. He's dreaming, Steve realizes and he smooths the little furrow his forehead. It makes Tony whine a little. His skin is clammy with sweat and the scent of coconut has all but disappeared under the hospital's smells. "I wrote you another letter" Steve says to the empty room, though he addresses Tony. He lays the lilac envelope in the Bible that he knows once belonged to Maria, that Pepper must have brought from home.
Rhodey calls bullshit. Pepper threatens to slice their balls off and even offers to help him hide the bodies.
"Sit down, kiddo" Tony tells him and Peter squints at him, before dramatically taking his seat again.
No one ever does.
He hasn't seen or heard him pray aloud and Steve is ashamed to admit that once, he had thought that a man who immersed himself in so much science would certainly have no interest in something like God.
Tony is nineteen and he's making his way to the library. His roommate, Peter fucking Quill had all but sexiled him from the room with the sock on their door. He has no other choice but to go to his usual spot in the library. He's making his way to his usual table when he spots Dr. Snobby as he's nicknamed him in his head.
"Promise me" she rasps and when he opens his eyes, she's staring at him. "Promise me that you won't turn into a Stark" she says and his eyes widen. He knows his father is outside, listening to their conversation. He wonders what kind of face he's making at this. "I want you to be happy, my sweet boy. I want you to live your life as you please, love who you want. So don't try to be someone you're not. Don't let yourself be turned into something that is as rotten as a Stark" she cries and he tries to soothe her, but her body shakes with her own desperation. He wipes her eyes with his handkerchief, the one she gave him when he was twelve, because as she said, that was the age of adulthood and a gentleman always had a handkerchief on him. She wetly laughs at the panic on his face and pats his cheek.
[Once a Stark, always a Stark]
So when the day slowly ticks down to 1, he has to build up the courage in order to go outside. He takes a hot shower that stains his skin pink and ignores the mirror on his way back to his bedroom. He picks out a pair of black jeans and a blue t-shirt under a grey hoodie for his adventure into the real world.
Almost like he's hoping to see that stupid beard of his, that somehow makes him more approachable, softer in the sense that even if you take a good look at him, you dare not think he resembles Captain Patriotism.
Tony jolts when fingers caress his forearm, and when he looks back at Steve, his breath catches in a ruined chest. Since they have started this thing [Tony refuses to label it because he has this fear that once he uses the B word, that it will splinter at the seams], he isn't stiff with tension.
He thinks back to what Pepper had once told him, "He's the closest that humanity has gotten at perfection, but even the great Captain is flawed"
He wants to promise that he will at least try, but the words remain stuck under his tongue, too heavy to utter, too fake to be true, so he remains silent and nods again.
He doesn't say anything to that. Instead he thanks Wanda and deeming this enough interaction for the day, he runs back to the protection of his apartment.
Tony Stark is not a people person. Once when his mother tried, in an effort to get him to make friends, he shouted at her "I don't know how to people!" Fortunately that didn't stop her and so he somehow managed to get Pepper, Carol and Rhodey to like him. However outside of the three, he doesn't people. So when blondie- Steve his mind reminds him, pushed an apology unto him and a promise for an impending friendship, Tony Stark panicked. And a panicked Tony often calls for the Goddess that is Pepper. "Tony!  I'm in class" Pepper hisses when the call connects with a click. "Tony!" She calls when he doesn't answer.
No one, not even the team knew. Maybe they suspected, but they had never announced to anyone else that they had been seeing each other. Ruefully, Tony thinks, it had been just another secret they both shared.
"We had help" Vision says and he can see the tension rising between them. Vision may have not told them the full story, but they know that when he chose to be with Wanda, it had caused a huge rift  between the three of them.
"W-I've been busy too" the Captain says with a sad twist of the lips and a nervous laugh. Tony turns his entire body to the still chuckling man and the movement makes the Captain freeze, robbing him of all noise.
"I'm offering you cookies, Antonio," Wanda says when she realizes that Tony doesn't exactly understand what she's trying to tell him. Tony's eyes widen and he coughs when his dry throat nearly chokes down his words. He wants to reject her offer but her eyes stop him.
"Why don't you go over and say hi?" Carol encourages and Tony scoffs as he slumps down on the Lazy Boy, his hand already cradled with a glass of red wine.
Even though they have seen him hold it in his hands, especially on the rough days when they can't save everyone.
"Booo" Clint shouts and Steve laughs as Scott kicks him to shut him up. He winks at Scott who shows him a thumbs up in return. When he gets to the library, the new librarian nods at him, and Steve resists the urge to blush as the pretty woman smiles at him. He manages to snag the best table in the library, next to the last row of books, and sets to work.
"I'll try but he always makes it so hard" he mutters and she huffs at the whine he releases when she runs her hand through his hair. He slumps over her bed, gently laying his head near her lap. "I love you" he whispers, his burning face pressed against the cool sheets, hands clutching against the fabric.
He sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose.
He ignored the boy's chuckling as he uses his spit to rub off the crude drawing, before stuffing all of his shit into his bag.
Anthony Stark is the first to look away, a frown on his lips as he turns his back on them and Steve feels like an idiot. His mother is right. He stands on his feet, ignoring the shouts from his friends as he uses his toned legs, a result of being football Captain, and runs after the retreating boy. He was stupid to assume....the thought "
"The red is a nice touch, isn't it?" Jarvis smugly asks and Tony nods, as he wolfs down his eggs.
Tony knew then that such a future dissolved into smoke. That there would be no future for them anymore.
"It's okay" is whispered into his temple and he doesn't even realize that it's his butler holding him. "Oh sir" he sobs and Tony remains still in Jarvis' arms until the beeping stops.
Even now he had desperately hoped that they would come together once more, that they would bridge the gap between them and create something new, something stronger. But as the days passed, Steve knows that Tony is too far away from him.
"Morning" he mumbles and she snorts at him over the phone. He can hear her secretary whispering in the background in a panicked tone, telling her “Ms. Potts, please. You can not keep Mr. Smalls waiting in the conference room”.
"Why?" It reads.
"Been having dreams" he tells him and flinches when blue eyes rove over his face. He hasn't shaved for a month now, his skin isn't its usual healthy olive tone and he has black circles under his eyes.
"We got you wine, you uppity asshole" Rhodey had said when Tony frowned at the Budweiser.
"He wishes" Bucky jokes and frowns when Sam hurries away.
It's raining, but the pitter patter escapes him.
Her head, now devoid of all hair, is wrapped with a bright red turban with golden stitches, her colors as she loved to joke. Beside her bed, is a large machine that constantly beeps, a reminder that she's still alive. He watches his father, stretched and broken, as he whispers to her, holding her hands like a glass of his most favorite scotch. His lips wobbles as she smiles up at him, her once blue eyes dulled grey with sickness.
"I'm staring at you because you have a penis drawn on your cheek" is written on the next note and Tony makes a loud garbled noise that causes numerous heads to swivel towards his direction. He grabs his phone from the table and uses the screen to look at his cheek. When he sees said penis, he inwardly screams.
"Wow so this is school" Tony says sarcastically to himself and he looks at the melee of people gathered at the gates. In a move that he totally didn't copy from Princess Mia of Genovia, he had Jarvis park some blocks away from the school. Jarvis had looked out from the Benz and frowned, though he didn't stop him. He hitches his bag higher and saunters past the giggling girls who don't even realize that the same person they are waiting for, had walked past them.
"Is it true?" Natasha asks and he turns angry eyes on her. He's furious, rightfully so, as he stares them down for their misplaced audacity.
"I want you to tell me the truth!" He hisses and Tony violently tugs away his hand.
He had been waiting for Steve to confront him again.
It's ten minutes into his essay, when a soft voice captures his attention.
That is what makes him move, which prompts him to gently place his hand over the man's chest, right over his heart. They both still at the contact, as that too thin of a hand, that built as much as it destroyed, remained on the hard planes of a chest that heaved at the warmth from that calloused palm. When Tony goes to remove his hand, the man places his both hands on his. Tony's weak body shudders and the man doesn't say anything. He only squeezes his hand a little before letting go.  "You'll be okay" Tony says as he steps away. The man sniffs and nods, but they both know that's as much as a goodbye they'll get. Tony watches him once more before turning away, and then with wobbly legs walks off.
Steve's body freezes as brown meet blue and the burning hatred fades in the background at the hidden grief he sees there.
"Miss Potts" Vision says as he appears next to Steve. Pepper, shakes her head as the boy continues to fall apart in her arms. Steve watches as she looks away from them, when Natasha approaches.
"You found yourself" Tony says and the man blinks at him. He looks away again as the man's entire face softens.
Yet, despite that, throughout the time spent together, he has seen him with the necklace, eyes closed as though he's offering up a word to the heavens. "There were problems" he starts and Steve feels his body move towards him. He gingerly sits on the other side of Tony who moves a little away from him.
"Nope" Tony says and Carol pats Rhodey's arm when his back tenses. Unlike before, Tony hardly speaks anymore. He's withdrawn and wary in a way that leaves Rhodey angry, not at his brother but at the unfairness of the world.
He feels so overwhelmed with like for this man, that Tony makes his decision. Steve jerks as he slips the necklace around his neck, as the cold silver touched his skin. "For protection" he tells him and Steve sets wide eyes on him.
A head thumps against the book shelf and Steve watches as it trembles under the action. "Okay, okay. It fucking sucks" the boy admits and Steve's eyebrows pinch in what Sam calls his 'Eyebrows of doom'. He hates profanity and for this faceless boy to desecrate the sanctity of the library, he would rein down hell.
"I would say you're a bad liar" he quips and Steve tries not to flinch at the word. Tony leans back on the balcony, watching the party with a sort of detachment that lingers.
And Tony like always, searched for familiarity in a world that had been crumbling around him.
"Me too" he replies and without hesitation, he steps outside and into the welcoming arms of the thunderstorm.
He looks away when Steve uses the napkin to soak up the tears that refused to fall.
"I'm going to eat yoghurt " he says and she groans at him as she drums her fingers on her table. She only does that when she is agitated.
Even when he's caught, the boy has no shame. He doesn't even look away. He continues to stare. Tony feels heat crawl up his cheeks at the attention and when a smug brow is raised in his direction, his frown deepens. He buries his head in his book, but the other boy won't stop looking. His patience finally runs out and he scribbles out "Stop staring at me, creep" on a pink Post It note. He flings it at the boy who just reads it and smirks. Ugh.
"It's not worth it" He says and she frowns. She shoots Steve one last glare before allowing Tony to escort her away from the blonde. "It's never worth it" He whispers to himself and she inches closer to him, offering him a silent comfort that brings back air to his lungs. He smiles at her, more genuine than the last before kissing her cheek as they disappear down the hall.
He moves to leave again, when something catches his eye. The necklace that always remain hidden in Tony's bedside drawer next to a weathered Bible and crystal rosary, is in his clasped hands.
So he sought Pepper.
"When I was younger, I hated you" Tony confesses and Steve sharply inhales at the words. "Couldn't for the life of me, understand why Howard loved you, a man he blarily knew, when he couldn't even stand to remain three minutes in the presence of his son. I hated myself, because I could never live up to you, and hated the man who made Howard happy like his family never could. In my childish folly, it was easier to blame you for turning him into such a cold man and when I got older, I hated you again. Because I realized he was the problem, and only you could be the solution, that only you deserved his love, like not even Mom or me could. But when I met you, even when we were dicks to each other-" Tony pauses with a wistful shake of the head that makes Steve fucking flinch.
He's going to fucking kill Peter Quill.
He says nothing and when he looks up, Steve chokes on the anger in those sad eyes. "Fuck you" Anthony snarls and stalks away, his tiny body shaking as he left.
He swears under his breath and rushes to the door, only to come face to face with Happy.
He's found again, two months later.
Bucky had laughed so hard, he snorted soda up his nose and had to hide his face on Sam's shoulder as they laughed at him. They're seated outside for lunch, under their tree, when Steve forgets about that one essay he has yet to finish. "I'm off to the library" he says, picking up his bag and avoids the fry to his head.
It's almost as cold as that dirty Siberian floor, laying in a casket of decimated metal, aching with broken ribs and a shattered heart.
The one who looks like a Russian MMA fighter, the fucking nightmare of nightmares, says one day in the hall:
He hates how his hands start to shakes, hates how he has to shove them in the pockets of his dress pants, hates the pull in his stomach, quesy with anticipation and rattled with nerves.
"It's been awhile" the man says, because he's not Steve to Tony anymore. Maybe, a dark voice hisses, he never was.
Steve understands it well, can see the grief hidden behind those eyes of his that he adores and he always wishes that he can reassure him, to comfort him, but he's never been good with that sort of thing. (Neither is Tony)
He knows it.
He sits down without looking at the other boy, takes out his books and starts making notes for one of his mid terms, when his neck prickles. He's being watched. He looks up to see Dr. Snobby looking at him.
"I know you don't want to hear it, but I am sorry you know" Steve says and Tony stops packing so he can look at him.
Another part of Tony, the one that suspiciously sounds like Howard, snarls at him and tells him that Steve will never let go of that hold he has, because of guilt.
"Not cool" Darcy says with so much disgust and turns away. She's the only one to run after Stark.
"Yeah" he confirms and he listens to her as she tells him about her day so far, Mr. Smalls be damned.
Steve finally sees him outside of their crappy TV and the breathless feeling is back.
He can see blonde and silver shifting in the darkness when the other man rubs at his eyes.
He becomes a Stark, so that Tony can survive. "I think this is the last time you will ever see me, sweetheart" he whispers as he stands. He leans down and closes his eyes as he kisses his forehead. He hopes that all the love that he has for this beautiful man can be poured into this one kiss because he knows that this will be the last time he has the chance to this. He swears that his love for this man, who gave his everything for a world that doesn't deserve his dedication, a man who he never once admitted that owned his heart, will not hurt him again. He pulls away and takes one last look at him through watery eyes. "Till we meet again, Shellhead" he whispers and leaves before he can destroy him further.
He can hear the wind howling outside, can see how the lights flicker over head, how the door bells chimes at the way the door is slammed from the forceful gale, can feel the cold inching closer to his skin.
Now, Tony muses, he can see more Steve than the Captain. He can almost see the man his father idolized so much. That, is what eases the bitterness away a little.
"Thank you" Steve whispers and Tony nods, wishing that days like these can last forever.
Almost as though she read his thoughts, his mother shoots him the most disappointed stare she could muster. Before he could apologize, she stalks out the room, leaving Steve with an embarrassed, blotchy face.
Whew, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
Tony catches movement in the corner of his eyes, and refuses to flinch as he steps out of the shadows.
Like Tony's death would be unevitable, something sad but never tragic.
It leaves him empty.
"Maybe we were doomed from the start" he mutters and Steve shakes his head.
"I know" he replies and listens to the noises coming from outside his apartment.
"I realized why Howard and Aunt Peg loved you so much. You have this power that draws people to you, that demands loyalty, that makes it easy for men to follow you into war just because you asked them to. You were always a brilliant leader but more than that, you have always been a better man. Someone so kind, so selfless, someone so true to his own morals, who never faltered, never in the face of righteousness" he says and reaches out to Steve who doesn't look like he's breathing. "So when I asked you if you knew" Tony whispers and Steve recoils, pulling away so quickly his elbow hits the edge of the table and his coffee spills into the surface, brown sticky substance staining the wood.
He doesn't know how they got to the point that Parker is now doing his homework in his lab, or why everytime he looks at the child, that he feels this sort of fierce protectiveness over him, that makes him just want to swaddle this little boy in a blanket and feed him soup. He stops working as the thought filters through the calculations and he has to sit down. "What the fuck" he whispers and Peter's head whips towards his direction so fast, he feels sorry for the boy's neck.
― Shannon L. Alder
"I'm so sorry" Steve stammers out and Tony smiles, something half as broken as he is.
Um. The fuck.
"I loved you but it wasn't enough. I wasn't enough to make you stay. I was never enough to make you trust me! " he shouts and Steve's shoulders hunches as his eyes rapidly blink in an effort to keep the tears from spilling. Tony feels the fight drain from him when he sees how much damage his anger has caused and he steadies himself before he crumbles. "Sometimes I would watch you, in our meetings, when you didn't think anyone would see you, I would watch how you would sit on the sideline and look inside, like you couldn't allow yourself to be a part of our team. Like you refused to be happy with us" he says and he lets Steve  clutch at his jacket. "On the really bad days, you would get this look in your eye, and I knew that you were seeing Barnes and Aunt Peg, maybe even Howard, and I knew even when we got together that I would never stand where they stood. And when I tried to talk to you about it, you would shut me down or avoid the topic altogether and I let you. Because I knew you were grieving and I trusted you to make it back to me" he confesses and Steve quietly presses his face on Tony's chest. "And yet it only got worse, we got worse. When Barnes was found, it was like some part of you survived that plane crash and I knew I lost you forever. Because you were so ready to burn the world that had taken Barnes away from you. Even if it meant fighting me. Even if it meant lying" Tony says  as Steve silently sobs. He had always been a quiet crier. "Then came Ultron and it was like you couldn't even look at me. And I trusted you again. Because you were right and we should never had played God. So I let you go and prayed that you would somehow forgive me" he whispers and pulls his hand away.
"It's St. Anthony" the other man tells him and Steve arches an eyebrow at him, though he doesn't step over the threshold.
He feels the ugliness claw at his throat, urging him to sneer or deride the man before him, but he shoves it down at the way the man lowers his head, as if he's waiting for the words to cut at his supple skin and that makes Tony swallow. "You?" He asks and the man is surprised again when the bitterness doesn't come.
Tony is returning from his session when he meets up with the deadly Russian and Wanda in the elevator. She's clinging to the man's tampered waist as he smiles at something she's mumbling from where she has her face smashed into his chest. The Russian looks at him from the moment the doors open and when Tony steps inside. He moves to the far corner, and stares at the doors when they close.
It leaves Steve more numb than he's ever felt. He had thought foolishly that they would rebuild (because isn't that what Tony once told him, he is so famous for?) what they once had, but when Tony announced his engagement to Pepper, he showed Steve that there is no forgiveness to be shared any more between them.
"It's Italian?" She asks and he nods, shifting his weight on his right leg, his pants dragging against the floor. She opens her mouth to say something, when a door is yanked open. Music drifts into the air, and Tony freezes. It's Sinatra. Tony can feel his hand spasm as a voice in his mind ticks off all there is to know about the track. The blonde, the stiff one (not the one he dubbed Hawkass) who lives with the Russian nightmare steps out into the hall with a bag of trash in his hand. His face lights up as he sees Wanda, and as though he didn't notice Tony (he didn't) he looks around until his icy gaze meets his own blank stare.
"How did you know Ms. Potts is it for you?" He asks and Tony hums a little under his breath.
Dr. Gooding is a tall, lean man with a nice face. He's good looking for a man in his fifties and he's saying that as an older man himself. He has sharp cheekbones that can probably cut steel and blue eyes that remind him of the Captain's. He's wearing a suit without a jacket or tie, and he's holding his usual journal when Tony sits down in his office. "You have bags under your eyes" Dr. Gooding says as he studies him under his lights. Tony keeps staring at the plastic plant in the corner. "Have you been sleeping?" He asks and Tony shakes his head.
"Tony gave it to me" Steve says and he doesn't hold back the chuckle as Sam sends him the most incredible "Oh Shit" faces he's ever seen.
It's his source of strength in trying times and today he needs the familiar weight to anchor him. He cradles the pendant in his large hands and finishes up his prayer just in time to  hear Sam enter the small hotel room. "You're staring at it again" Sam says as he crosses over to him, handing him a bottle of water to ease the discomfort of the sweltering heat. "Whose was it? Your mother's or your father's?" he dares to ask as he sits down on the bed opposite from his, gulping down water from his own bottle. Steve smiles as he tucks the necklace back into his pocket.
Tony looks at him, really looks at him for the first time that night, and the man's hand begin to shake, his Adam's apple bobs as those eyes, the colour of that which gives life, the damp Earth that buries those in its grasp, the colour of his Ma's favourite sweater, the one that belonged to his Pa, that smelled of his faded cologne, the colour that stained the pages of his sketchpad and his fingers, those eyes that had showed him, exactly how deep the hurt could lie within a person's soul, the colour of a man who died under his fists every night.
He can tell that her happiness is precious.
Almost as cold as those eyes who faced down at him, mocking him with its resignation as the shield beared down on him with an unforgiving justice.
"I could not for the life of me, understand how you could lie to me for so many months. How you could pretend for so long even when you laid down with me on those shitty nights, when you pressed your forehead against mine just to make the trembling stop, when we cried together about dead mothers, when I opened up to you about Howard and his asshole tendencies, even when I confessed to you, whispering in those tender silences about how much I missed him even when I hated him, even after all of that, even when we promised never to hurt each again and still look me in the eye, like my pain was never a priority.... it destroyed me" he whispers, and by the time he's finishes, his own cheeks are soaking wet. Steve is crying too, his eyes downcast, focused on his lap.
Yeah, he's petty like that.
His hair is short this time, the temples riddled with grey and his entire lower face has been taken hostage by his facial hair. He's wearing one of
Even when his father ruthlessly liked to remind him that they paid Jarvis to be there, that he didn't ever truly cared, that it had been his job.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony finds himself on the rooftop again. He's sitting near the ledge, staring at the murky night, at the lights that never leave, the town that never sleeps, at the people who never stopped walking around, like ants in a busy colony. Always moving forward without any time to just stop. His dreams were too vivid again, he could hear the screaming, could feel the blood filling his mouth until he choked, could feel glass digging into his palms and the way his flesh gave way to the metal lodged in his chest, could see those eyes, staring out at him, begging him not to save him, but to "Live, Tony"
"I have an idea" Tony says, elbows pressed against the marble. "Why?" He asks and Steve smiles at him. Steve wants to lean in now and bury his face in those brown locks of his. For awhile now the scent of coconuts have been the cause of half of his unillicted reactions. Instead, he leans over the balcony and fiddles with his cufflinks.
"It doesn't work. I'm not....It never helps" he confesses and Pepper doesn't say anything. He listens to her breathe for a minute, listens to the sound of paper rustling and a finger tapping away at the desk, and it grounds him.
Steve frowns as the buzz dies down by lunch time. Anthony Stark's arrival is anti-climatic as people gossips.
Steve doesn't say anything. Instead the Captain comes out, a stoic expression that hides away Steve from the world... From Tony.
He simply nods and she claps. The Russian is enchanted with her enthusiasm but he seems distrustful of Tony. He's wary when they get off the elevator and when they follow her to her apartment. He clearly doesn't want to leave Wanda alone with Tony. She smiles encouragingly at him when she opens her door and she shouts when they meet Hawkass munching down on what seems to be the last of said chocolate chip cookies.
"Hey Steve" Wanda speaks up when she can feel how uncomfortable he is getting as the hulking blonde stares at him. Steve's head snaps to her and his eyes soften when he smiles at her. She pushes him down the hall, her hand on his back gently and he finally takes the hint. He glances at them once before he leaves, and she can see how life returns to Antonio's frozen body. "It was nice to meet you" she tells him and Antonio nods as he disappears into his apartment, the man once again gone into hiding. She decides not to go back into her own apartment and steps into Steve's. Bucky is laying on the couch, Natasha laying limp on his body, her head pressed against his chest, right over his heart, Sam is sitting on one of the stools agruing with Scott and Clint is perched near the kitchen eating cereal. He perks up when she steps inside, signing at her "You look happy" the man signs with a giddy smile. They all love it when she's happy.
"And if I said I was enjoying the view?" He asks and Tony just snorts into his orange juice.
He could still hear the boy's laughter as he ran out of the library.
Anthony Edward Stark is beautiful in person.
"There will be people in the school to take care of any threats" his father says apropos of nothing. Tony nods and his father moves slowly towards him. Tony tenses as his father places a silver pocket watch on the bed, and Tony pushes away the gasp he feels in his chest. The rose engraved at the back mocks him, and the loss feels acidic in his mouth. "She would have wanted you to have it" his father says, looking everywhere but at him.
He watches the way Peter nods like he understands, but Tony knows for a fact that he doesn't, not yet anyway and he stands. He stretches a little and reaches out to ruffle the kid's hair. "Don't worry about it so much. Come on lets get lunch" he says and walks away.
To pick at the wounds until they started to bleed again.
He doesn't want to talk and the man who's trying but failing to make himself smaller, seems to pick up on this.
He's wearing glasses now, as he blankly stares at the proposals on the uneven table that rocks every time he moves.
"I don't understand why he had to choose this school" Scott moans and groans as he joins them in their walk into the school.
"He does not need you here right now" Rhodey says as he crosses his arms over his chest. He's standing tall and proud like an unmoving Sentinel, ready to guard Tony from them.
The music manages to drown out the world.
The first time Steve meets Anthony Edward Stark, it goes like this:
"What do you want me to say?" Tony ask, his mouth twisting in a snarl.
"That's good" Tony says and looks at his watch. He has five more minutes before Pepper calls to find out exactly where he is. He closes the folder and under Steve's gaze, he makes the decision to run again.
"That's much better. But that's not what I called you about. It's about Dr. Gooding. He says you missed your appointment again" she says and Tony leans against the counter after he puts on the coffee maker.
Said speech had been delivered in the snidest tone he had ever heard from another human being besides Howard.
"You got laid, kitten?" Bucky asks without raising his head and he laughs when she shows him her middle finger.
So to see the fondness in those blue eyes directed at him, to see how the tenderness manages to smooth out the graphite-like expression that seem to keep others at an arms length, always takes his breath away.
Steve is a man who carries the bodies of his loved ones every where he goes, and so his own body has always been taunt.
"I already ordered" the man says and Tony nods. "You look better" he adds and greets the waitress with a smile that makes her flush, as she places his cup on the table. Tony pushes his papers back into his folder, listening vaguely as the girl flirts with him for a few minutes before walking off with an extra sway of her hips.
The loud chatter dies as all eyes swing from Steve to Anthony, one too embarrassed to say anything, and the other who remained so still, they are afraid he had stopped breathing.
"Hey Rhodey" the voice whispers and Steve looks down at his paper. The delicate openness in that tone feels intimate in the same way Jane and Thor speaks to each other. It feels sacrilegious to listen in, and embarrassing if you get caught. "No, I'm fine" the boy breathes out and even though he can't see the boy's face, he knows he's lying.
"We all grieve differently, Stevie" Bucky pipes up and Sam nods,as they shift closer to him.
Meanwhile Tony remains passive and almost at ease without the noise. "I liked it" he finishes with a boyish smile.
"Hey" he says and she smiles shyly at him. She's prettier when she smiles, he thinks as her eyes shine with happiness.
The first time Steve sees Anthony Edward Stark, it's on television.
"Oh, they're the best" Hawkass pipes up and he whines when the Russian kicks him on the butt to shut him up.
. He cautiously walks to the bookshelf and listens as the boy whispers "I don't know Rhodey, I can't do this. Maybe I should have stayed the Sociopath Stark and remained in isolation".
"I see that" the man says and sips on his coffee, hissing when it burns his tongue. Tony nearly cracks, nearly laughs at the giant dork but manages to look away at the right moment. He sees the way Natasha and Sam smirk at him, the way the three converse without words, the blantant display of a shared trust that makes Tony burn and ache.
"Boys" Natasha says though she smiles at Bruce who returns the gesture. Steve pulls Bucky in for a one armed hug, as his best friend frowns at Sam's disappearing back.
Tony breathes out the anger and shakes at the loss of its heat.
Fuck.
He doesn't relax, because if he only loosens the hold he has on his control, Tony knows he will shatter.
They're left alone together, the silence deafening and cold, as she studies him. When her eyes stray at the dull gold band on his finger, pity clouds her eyes. "Hi" she whispers, and there's bit of an accent in her throaty voice. She tucks a stray strand of hair behind her ear and gazes at him shyly. "My name's Wanda" she adds and he thinks that if he was alive, he would have appreciated the mysterious aura that this girl carries around her, almost like magic.
"About what?" Dr. Gooding asks even though he damn well knows what about. Tony frowns at him but the man doesn't cower under his faze.
It reminds him of the only man who loved him enough not to hurt him. The only one who cared about Tony, who existed behind the Stark, the boy who could never be good enough for a father who chased after dead heroes and a mother who could never be strong enough to choose the son over the husband. The man who looked after the sweet child and who made sure that at least one person on Earth could say that they truly loved Tony Stark.
Even in the throes of his newfound atheism, his Catholic upbringing continues to haunt him.
Yet as he's moving to stand, an ugly laugh, one rattled with so much sorrow, stops him and leaves him breathless. His mind panics as flashbacks of asthma attacks plagues his mind but he manages to
"Are you...okay?" Peter asks, and Tony's eyebrows furrow at the way it's said, like he's talking to a scared calf, and not a forty (Shut up Rhodey) something year old man who built and superheroes in a suit of armor. Tony sits down on the stool, and looks at this little bean who is already on his feet, skittish and twitching as though he's ready to haul Tony to the hospital just from saying the word Fuck.
"They'll like you" Carol tells him and Tony glances at her from the corner of his eyes, his left hand trembling on his lap. "They just dont know you" she adds as Elsa starts to sing. Tony doesn't say anything, he just turns his head.
"I know" he replies and the Captain nods at him.
In the years he's met the Captain, he's only seen that smile once at a time. Usually, those lips are pressed together in a firm, grim line that is used to display his irritation to the world. That jaw had always been clenched, jutting out with the need to pummel and destroy.
"I believe you were very Anna-ish if I do say so myself, sir" Jarvis says with a straight face as Tony gobbles down his toast. Tony snorts and watches as a few flecks of bread sprays across his lap. Jarvis frowns.
"You'll figure it out because you're Howie's son" his mother says and he winces. "I know that you two don't get along but don't give up on him. Don't hate him, okay?" She adds and Tony looks down at her hands. "Tony" she whispers and Tony nods.
"Hello to you too" Pepper says and he lays down on the pillow, rubbing away the sleep from his eyes. The cotton feels nice against his skin.
"About Stephen" he whispers and Dr. Gooding just nods. "I dreamt of the first time we spoke to each other" he says as he glances at the plant again. He can see a tiny spider dancing along it's plastic veins.
"Yeah. I uh, I did" he confirms and Tony nods as he takes a gulp of his own luke warm coffee.
"H-how have you been?" The Captain asks and Tony hums. He's never once heard him falter, but now, seeing him dressed in a black pair of jeans, with a white t-shirt partially hidden by a plaid shirt and brown jacket, with a beard clinging to his face, his hair longer than he's ever seen, the ends almost curling to the base of his ears, he can certainly see why his Aunt Peg had fallen in love with this man.
Just a little.
But all of that is a lie though. Steve laughs and covers his eyes, as he feels the wetness of a wrong he committed escape his soul. How did he, of all people, who always canvased for justice, be so ignorant and cruel to a kid who just lost his mother?
"Yeah" Tony says and adds a sigh. The man, squirms a little in his seat as exasperated eyes fall on him. He turns and sees Natasha sipping on some awful green tea, listening to Sam as he chattered away, some tables away from them. "Do you want something?" Tony asks and when he turns, he takes notice of the fading flush on the other man's face.
After he nursed a broken heart and helped Rhodey with his physical therapy, he reached out to Pepper again. And once more, after they rebuilt the scattered remains of their relationship, she took her place beside him.
"That's good" he says when no one says anything. The Russian is glaring at the floor with intense eyes and a rigid pose. He looks like he's going to murder the carpet.
The desire to fight had always been burning, the grief and loneliness pushed to the background where it couldn't reach anyone.
Sitting in a quiet corner of a desolate cafe, sipping on a cup of coffee with his mother's favourite song in his ears.
He's on the phone again, ignoring the people who's staring at him, talking animatedly with the other person on the line. He's biting down on his plump, lower lip, nodding at something the person is saying when he looks up, their eyes meeting across the crowded courtyard.
"And who is going to protect you?" Steve asks, his voice thick with an emotion that Tony refuses to decode.  He leans forward and Steve arches an eyebrow as Tony kisses his nose before pulling away.
Steve nods and looks out at the splashes of pink that paints the setting horizon.
He always knew his pain was as cheap as you could get.
"I wanted to see you" the other man admits and Tony doesn't say anything. "I needed to see you" he adds and takes off the baseball cap from his head. Tony nearly smiles at the way the man splutters as hair falls over his face in a mess.
"Well that went better than expected" Sam says as the three of them join him. He's the only one to break the silence, watching as their leader wiped away the clinging wetness from his cheeks.
"Thanks" Tony says and Steve laughs.  The sound is so dry and brittle, that is almost makes him wince.
Can feel those eyes watching him from where he's standing, waiting for Tony to make the first move.
"Are you happy?" Steve asks and Tony humms a little under his breath.
Shit, he's here already.
A year ago, this Steve only existed in seconds at a time.
"Antonio" he says and tilts his head back so that he can look at him in the eyes. The smile he receives is so bright, his fingers tremble, because it's been a long time since he's illicted such a reaction from someone, and the tiny part that had always coveted the company of humans, that loved people just for the sake of loving them, preens at that smile. He looks away, when blue becomes too probing and misses the way those eyes flicker with sadness. He stands with a forced ease, and awkwardly smiles at Steve, who is comfortable now with openly staring at him in a way that it seems like he's trying to understand him. Too bad, only a select few get a chance, he thinks to himself while he nods at Steve before walking away.
"I am. She makes me happy" Tony confesses. Ever since the paparazzi had managed to capture a picture of Tony kissing Pepper, he's been expecting this.
"Take care of yourself" Tony says, because he needs to leave. These few minutes are enough.
"A year" the man says when the shock wears off. Tony nods but doesn't say anything. "Saw your presentation" he adds when the silence becomes too much for him.
Apparently he walked into the school undetected and when it was time to introduce himself to his class, he looked at his classmates and announced "I hate people".
Thick arms wrap around his waist, and calloused hands stroke down his back, offering up a place for Tony to hide.
And how is he supposed to NOT?
Tony had been home schooled by his mother and the plethora of the 'best' tutors could hire since he was a babe. After the one attempt of public education had gone wrong years ago, his mother decided to educate him on her own. Now that she- Tony rips his toast into his mouth and cuts the thought off. "Stark men don't cry" His father blandly replies but he doesn't quite manage to cover up the twitching of his left eye at the admonition.
"How do we recover from this?" he pleads but Steve doesn't have any answers for him and doesn't offer any promises either. Tony, when he finally has regained the last of his strength, he manages to wipe his face. As he gets up, Steve's shoulders are shaking now.
"It was fun when it lasted" he bids him as he walks towards a tight frown on such a beautiful face, concern and anger wound in those fierce eyes.
"Oh there is Stark" someone says and Steve sits up.
"Yes" is all he can say as she continues to decimate him with her glare. She doesn't even look at Natasha or Vision as she walks away, her heels clicking on the floor as she goes.
However, before she could reply, a loud incessant beeping erupts into the silence and his head shoots upwards. A scream bubbles in his throat as his mother is looking at him with the sweetest smile on her face. Hands grab at his shoulders as he's pulled away from the bed, as the nurses and doctor rush into the room to save her, but they all know she's gone to a place far from their reach.
All the soft emotions disappears from his face, only for a harsh desolate coldness to remain. Tony watches as his father gets up, kisses his wife on the forehead and leaves. No words shared, no comfort offered to each other as his father breezes by him. "He'll come around" his mother says for the millionth time, though this time sounds like the last.
"Antonio" he rasps and she flinches a little when he answers. It's probably the first time he's acknowledged one of his neighbours enough to speak, so it's the first time any of them has heard his voice.
“Hanna, I will be there in five minutes. Tell him to wait” Pepper says with steel in her voice and poor Hanna squeaks out a ‘Yes ma’am’ before running out of her office. Tony is amused as ever as he rolls on his back.
"What if I don't how to?" He asks and his mother shakes her head at him.
"I heard" Tony mutters and finishes his breakfast. Jarvis on cue takes the empty platter from Tony and with an effortless bow of the head to Howard, he leaves. Tony dusts off his lap and looks at his father.
He had a good day yesterday considering that he's spoken to people, but just as the day ends and another begins, he knows it's going to be horrible.
"His name" she says and Natasha is now sitting in Bucky's lap, her eyes narrowed. "Antonio" she breathes and murmurs flood the apartment at the revelation.
"Should I call security?" She asks and he huffs as he lays his hand on the small of her back.
"Nice" Tony says and the corner of Jarvis' lips turn upwards in a half smile.
If Tony is quiet enough, he can hear the ugly screech of metal. He jerks out of the memory and ignores the way those blue eyes widen with worry.
"I'm glad" the man sighs and blows on his coffee. The sight curls his toes and dries his throat. The other man smiles at him when he's caught. "Saw you on the news the other day" he throws out and Tony listens to the rain a little.
Warning: There is swearing ahead.
Yet it didn't last.
"I meant coffee" Tony says and the man flushes in embarassment. He watches with a sort of detachment as red spills over his ears, watches as the few freckles are brought to life by the colour.
His mind is too cramped, his skin feels too tight, like its stretched too thin over fragile bones, that if he makes a sudden move, he'll burst at the seams. He wants another drink, but he's trying to cut back, especially after last week when he nearly drowned in his own shower after he passed out. He pinches at his nose, hoping to relieve the building pressure at his forehead, when he feels someone staring at him. "That doesn't help, you know" a deep voice says and he glances at the blonde he nicknamed the Captain in his mind, joins him on the ledge.
Tony watches the tears that cling to fair eyelashes, feels the sorrow that seeps into every pore of the man sitting before him and feels his heart beat for him.
RIP shitty elevator carpet, Tony thinks and has to fight the sudden urge to make the sign of the cross.
He's scruffier now. Older too. The beard makes Tony's fingers itch, makes him want to do something foolish like reach out and touch his face. Instead, he taps the table with his pen.
"You never did" Tony repeats and Steve wraps his left arm around his shoulder, while he uses his right hand to delicately cradle the back of his head.
"I'll go" he breathes out and she sighs again. This time, it's out of relief.
"Do you want me to order something for you?" She asks and Tony finally pushes himself out of bed.
She's beautiful, even when the disease has robbed her of vitality. She's the brightest thing in the room, like a dying star bursting into the endless darkness of infinite space, demanding for all to gaze at its dangerous beauty. She wheezes and when her gaze lands on him, he flinches. "Come here my sweet boy" she calls out to him and he watches as his father retreats into himself.
