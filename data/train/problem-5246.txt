Vanko glanced back to Tony then back to Barnes. Bucky had a gun in hand ready, pointing it towards Vanko. It was impressive to Tony that the man could still look threatening with only one arm.
“Hello,” he muttered, though rose to his feet nonetheless. His hand extended out towards Tony but he wasn’t sure what black substance was on the man’s hands, so Tony avoided the pleasantries and just smirked. He drew his hand back, unperturbed. “My name is Ivan Vanko. I… My father was a former partner to Howard.” Tony tucked the name away for later research.
Natasha shrugged, glancing between Steve and Bucky both. “I’ll take honesty over lies any day.” Steve took that as a queue to walk away. The strange energy. The bizarre looks. Steve didn’t want to get in between it.
The CEO closed out of his video message board, grinding his teeth together as he walked through his mansion. “
“Three months.” Tony blinked, Rhodey’s eyes focused on him so fast that Tony hardly had time to notice. “Give me three months and I’ll take over as second hand.” The CEO shook with the amount of force behind his friend’s words. Rhodey didn’t often speak in this tone, especially around Tony.
She grabbed his arm quickly. “Not here.” She murmured before taking them to his office, shutting the door and telling JARVIS to keep everyone else out.
Setting his blow torch down Tony gave his full attention. “Deciding to skip Manhattan? But I thought we were getting along so well.” Tony had no doubt that Barnes had told Roger’s the moment that he’d gotten back. Wouldn’t that have been a conversation to be a fly on the wall. How freaked had Roger’s been? Tony would pay millions just a for a photo of his face. “Doesn’t matter I suppose, that should be a message to the other gangs of Manhattan. Don’t mess with the Merchant.” There was a smirk going across Tony’s face as he went back to his current project.
“The Irish Mob isn’t something to sniff at. I don’t want to risk them hurting you. I have to go back to base tomorrow morning, but I’ll stop back by again before I head out.” Rhodey glanced back at Tony, his eyes like steel when he caught the CEO’s eyes. “Don’t do anything too brash while I’m gone. I promise that I’ll help you with this Tony.”
Now Steve wasn’t quite sure where he stood. His base back in Brooklyn had been compromised by the police, and there was no doubt that they were searching all of Brooklyn for him. The Captain was well known but didn’t hold a face, most of the members didn’t. Bucky, The Winter Soldier, was practically a ghost. Natasha, The Black Widow, a tale to keep children in bed during the night. Clint, Hawkeye, a legend that ran deep in the underbelly of New York for being known as the man that didn’t miss.
“Who’s after you?” Tony saw that Loki picked up speed suddenly. “Did you hijack a car?” The heavy breathing was his only answer. He could only assume that Loki’s phone was clutched in his fist and he was too paranoid to bring it up to his ear again. So instead Tony worked on opening up the streets for him. “If you can hear me, and are just ignoring me get here as soon as possible. The security will stem off whoever’s after you.”
The piano stopped, and from the pizza that was sitting out on the table, Tony could only guess why the man was here at all. Obie seemed to narrow his eyes at Tony for a moment before sighing. “Sunglasses weren’t meant for use indoors, Tony.”
The CEO grinned slightly. “Thank you, Obie. I can always count on you.” The man smiled at that and looked away. Tony allowed his chest to release the odd tension that was there. With that Obie got to his feet, walking around the piano to sit down close to Tony. There were at least a good three or four feet between them, but Tony still felt like his hair was standing on end.
Tony sighed, rubbing his hand against his chest and feeling for the hard casing of the reactor underneath his palm. “What did you tell them?” His voice was rough and obviously weak from disuse. Tony almost forgot that he was practically screaming at Bruce to get off of his floor earlier that morning.
“I see. Well, I can look into adult ballet classes if you want, or you could find a studio if you want to practice on your own. You don’t have to avoid something that you like just because you work for me.” Steve swore he saw the hair of a smile, but there wasn’t much else that gave away from Natasha physically.
Peter seemed to be embarrassed about the fact as his ears started to turn red. His eyes fell from Steve’s instantly. “Don’t have a family. Not anymore.” Those green orbs found blue once more when he spoke again, “I was cleaning up what I’d already done. I just fried one of the circuit board at a place I was staying in. The place is probably burning up as we speak.” Steve felt part of his mouth fall open at the kid’s confession. “No need to worry though sir. I’ll attend confession on Sunday.”
Tony could agree that whole heartedly, Obie gave off weird vibes when you were alone with him for too long.
That last part was practically yelled into Tony’s speakers, but it was muted for the most part by Loki’s teeth.
Taking a seat on the edge of his desk Tony scowled at the both of them. They didn’t take a seat, they remained standing. With the revelation now obvious Steve let go of his easy shield, scowling at Tony with blue piercing eyes. (Hadn’t already mentioned how he doesn’t like scowls?) “Alright, fine. I’m close to the Merchant, but to get anything done in this town I must be close to the man who holds the cards. I give him guns he protects me. It’s a give and take relationship.”
Steve stacked up some of his papers into a neater pile. It would have to wait. “Peter, are you sure that it’s a good idea?” The young boy nodded, curling his fingers together and into small fists. It was as if Peter were trying to curl his fingers around the hem of the shirt but thought better of it. “Well… I uh… Peter, I’ll talk it over with Bucky and maybe we will see what we can do.” That seemed to be all that Peter really need because without a second thought Peter nodded and took off back out the door.
Peter’s eyes shifted to someone who’d entered the room. His eyes seemed trusting to whomever it was. Steve glanced himself and smiled at the red head. Natasha took a seat next to Steve and stared at Peter for a second. “Don’t sell out your life yet, Peter. We want to help you. Forget what you think you know about normal Mob’s. Our group, our family is different. We don’t sell drugs, or pilfer guns around. We stop things like that. Something that the Merchant can’t offer you, and something Osborn likely can’t offer in Queens.” She held out a hand to Peter with a shockingly kind smirk. “Give us a shot at least. I promise that we have your best interest at heart.”
Tony shrugged, keeping his mouth shut until they were driving back towards the tower. Obadiah didn’t have codes to get into the tower quite yet. Tony didn’t think that it was even on his to do list in his workshop. “Trying to get me to do a live demo in Afghanistan for some of the brass up there. Board is trying too, but I’ve told both to shove it.” Bruce rolled his eyes at Tony’s antics but didn’t comment further.
Steve shook his head, “No clue, he’s supposed to text me when he reaches rendezvous point.” Sitwell seemed unsatisfied, but Steve didn’t care. He was too worried about the Merchant arriving with an army simply for the fact that they now knew his identity.
“Probably a mix like us by now, but yeah. Their head is still Italian from what Nat says.” Anything that Natasha found was probably reliable if Steve was going to be honest. The woman was too terrifying to lie to. “You knew their head before the war, right? I thought you’d mentioned him once or twice.”
“Steve?” the blonde in question turned around. Peter stood in the doorway of his office and it was rather obvious that he felt too awkward to walk in unannounced, unlike the rest of Steve’s crew.
“Without talking to the Merchant?” Tony twirled around quickly and glared at Barnes. It was the first thing he’d said in this conversation, and Tony could tell that Roger’s hadn’t wanted to say anything about it. He had his face in one of his hands now.
Tony didn’t keep up with his once close friend and slowly they were both corrupted to hate the other. Though Tony wouldn’t say that he held any anger towards the younger Hammer, just animosity. In short.
When the first soldier reached him Tony nearly wept when he noticed that it was Rhodey who seemed almost close to tears himself. “Next time, you’re riding with me.” Then Tony was hugged, hugged harder than he’d ever been in his life.
Steve grabbed his best friend’s hands and held them out in front of him. “Buck, you need to stay calm. What happened with Stark? Did the Merchant show up?”
He’d made men fall to their knees and beg for mercy. Tony knew how to bride and flirt his way out of a situation and back fire it on them before they realized what had happened. He was the chaos that no one could control. The swipe of a few keys and Tony had control of the grid. A few calls and all important political figures were his lives to control.
Closing up and storing away the bags Steve wandered away from the small table to where he’d seen a figure slip in. “Romanov, what did you hear?” From the shadows, a skinny, red-headed woman emerged. Her eyes scanned over Steve before she started talking.
Tony handles a few issues that seem to pop up in Manhattan. Meanwhile, Steve goes off to visit with an old friend... Or is he?
“I’m afraid that I don’t remember. I’ll have the records checked, but if there is a way that I can contact you if I find them.” Tony trailed off when Roger’s held out a card. Taking it Tony noted how, bland, boring it looked.
“What’s up?” Pepper’s voice broke through Tony’s thoughts and he glanced at his PA. She seemed to be worried but relieved at the same time. Tony could only guess what was going through her head right now.
“No one was alive, Mr. Stark. They were all dead, and I was afraid I was going to be next but I didn’t die… I didn’t. Though I had tough luck with all of my family dying around me.” Peter’s voice seemed quieter. “I… I want justice for my friend, Harry, Mr. Stark. Steve is kind, and I’m grateful for what he’d provided for me thus far, but… He wouldn’t go to the lengths that you would. He doesn’t want to kill anyone unless they’re a threat to the family.”
“Third bag today. I was wondering why Sam was asking where the duct tape was at. Howard not as friendly as you remember?”
“I’ve already told Obadiah that I can’t leave for personal reasons. If they want a live demonstration then they can put up with one of our other salesmen. They don’t need me specifically.” Scowls. Tony hated scowls. His finger twitched, he stopped himself. No. No. Stop that.
“Weakness. You aren’t the man that everyone says that you are. Course he wouldn’t really know that, would he? Bloke probably came from over the river, those Brooklyn and Queens folk don’t know how things are run in these parts.” Tony nodded.
Everyone flinched when the Merchant fired a bullet up towards the ceiling. Steve heard the soft thud of a bullet hitting metal but didn’t flinch when the Merchant came closer towards him. “I don’t fear anything, Captain. I am as close as it comes to a god here.” Steve doubted that. No one was considered that, not for people like him and the Merchant. They were expendable when the time was right. When it was there time people didn’t hesitate to throw the old into the garbage and roll on with the new blood.
Before the left Thor made a growling noise at them, curling his hands into fists. “Do not touch me again.” He warned, but they were already out the door before Thor could speak again.
“You could say that,” Peter stated, glancing back to Steve. The mob boss hadn’t seemed to hear them. Far too lost. “What happened with Stark… two days ago. Do you think that he’ll call Steve? He admitted to being close with the Merchant to you both.”
“We should have run them out when we had the chance,” Loki muttered, relaxing back into his chair with a sigh. Tony agreed.
J.A.R.V.I.S., bless his circuit board heart, kept the room as dark as he could with the sun shining in through the window. He practically minimizes any sound within the room, turning off fans when they became too much, and turning them on for a small bit of time to keep up air flow. Tony knew for a fact that J was his greatest and best creation.
Steve nodded again. “Howard. Nice guy if you got around the fact that when I first met him I was about ten, and he’d offered me a scotch while pointing a gun at a still warm dead body.” Meeting Howard when he did was a complete accident. The leader of their family was going over to Manhattan to discuss with Howard about a trading deal. He’d brought Steve along to pacify Howard, hoping that he wouldn’t get too violent. That went out the door quickly, but regardless it seemed to work. Howard liked Steve, in a son sort of way that seemed odd.
He’d been showing this missile off just yesterday… Was it yesterday? Tony looked up at the faces around him, and the pure rage that went through him made Tony want to rip all of their heads off. He didn’t cooperate with terrorists. “No.” The man’s face fell. Yinsen tensed at Tony’s reply, but no one moved.
“You made a truce with him?! With the IRISH MOB?!?! Are you nuts Tony?” Obie’s voice carried throughout the house, making Tony push back into his couch with a sigh. Rhodey and Pepper were also present, but that didn’t matter to Obie as he ripped Tony open with his words. “Tony, they’ll take over Manhattan. The Italian Mob and the Irish Mob don’t get along for a reason. We always are going after the territory of the other. It wasn’t until your father that they kept their pasty white a$$#$ in Brooklyn.” Tony took a sip of his scotch though it didn’t do much to make him feel better.
Maria. Innocent and loving Maria. Tony loved her dearly. He still had a piece of her jewelry in his nightstand that he pulled out once in a while to remanence.
Tony was slightly shocked at how silent Barnes was being about this. He figured that he would be trying to offer some spelling of his name, or offering some other name to search but he was quiet. Quiet as the winter night. He shivered at the thought. “Could we possibly work something out should you not find the file? I would appreciate some sort of compromise.” Tony looked to Barnes and Rogers. They both seemed out of their depth, but Tony just stared at them. They hadn’t even made it to his office yet.
Tony stared for a while at the man that he considered as close as family. “I’m alright Bruce.” The CEO gave a small grin to him, though Tony could tell that Bruce wasn’t convinced. Instead, the doctor walked in further and took a seat next to him on the workbench. They sat there together in silence for what felt like hours, but Bruce didn’t allow it to fester.
Vanko wasn’t going to be happy. After a little bit, Tony allowed his eyes to harden, glaring lightly at the man before him, bringing himself back up to full height. Vanko didn’t seem perturbed and went back to the bar, downing another shot of vodka, still with the gun trained for Tony. “The Merchant, is he all that powerful?”
“How long till Barnes is back?” Steve turned around to look at Sitwell. His back was ramrod straight, almost too military like.
” JARVIS’ automated voice followed Tony when he walked over to his personal bar, pouring himself a good amount of scotch. A television screen lit up across the room.
Now, Steve was back inside. Natasha watched them speak… Mostly Steve talk. Tony seemed to be watching Steve with careful and calculating eyes. It was almost fascinating how much Stark seemed to take in with just observation alone.
“I don’t doubt that you meant the best for the family, Obie. I know that you care about the family. It’s why I keep you around.” With that Tony rose to his feet, rubbing at his temples. His thoughts were all muddled. He needed to lie down. “I’m going back up, Obie. Hit the lights on your way out.”
His hands shook only a little as he stepped away from Vanko. From his coat, Vanko pulled out a gun with a silencer on the end of the barrel. He cursed his luck this week and put down the projections. “I don’t keep those files here,” Tony whispered, looking from the gun to Vanko and back. If Tony knew how fast that Vanko shot he might rick grabbing for his own handgun, but didn’t he just say to himself in the elevator that he wasn’t going to shoot anyone today?
Peter didn’t talk much when Steve had sat down across from him. His head chin was resting on his knees, seemingly lost in thought. Steve looked over at the boy. Peter, from what Steve could tell, was intelligent. He seemed to factor in everything all at the same time and strived to be the smartest in the room. Steve only knew this as Peter seemed to ask all the right questions to get the knowledge that he was seeking. “Want to talk about where you’re originally from?” Steve long ago thought that he was good with kids. They seemed to like him well enough, and he didn’t mind speaking with them. Kids were innocent and often were harmless.
“Do you think I don’t know that Obie? Roger’s didn’t give me much of a choice. He held Bruce and Loki captive and he took my gun. I wasn’t in the best place to be fighting back demands. Besides, I still hold Manhattan. This is my city, he won’t walk out of line, not while I’m-”
While Vanko was looking away though Tony pulled out a gun from his jacket and pointed it at the Russian himself. The sudden movement drew Vanko’s eyes back to him, but Tony didn’t hesitate. He pulled the trigger, sending the bullet into the man’s wrist. Tony nearly smiled at the sound of a cracking bone from this range. The man didn’t cry out in pain, but he did grunt.
Tony simply grinned. “Might have run into a new mob in town. They don’t exactly understand territories but worry not, I haven’t shot a single er…” Tony grimaced, “Well I shot the ceiling, so I haven’t shot anyone.” There was a soft sigh from Bruce but it had the telltale signs of relief.
There was a lot of flashes when Tony first walked in. Those weren’t what stopped Tony in his tracks. In front of him, standing like he owned the ground underneath his feet, stood Steve Rogers. Military uniform and Bucky Barnes in tandem wearing his own uniform. Both were staring at him as if he were a piece of meat that was theirs for the taking. Tony stared them down, hackles rising as they seemed to almost grin at seeing him walk in. “Tony, press conference is over here.” Obie’s voice felt like it was coming in through water. Tony didn’t remember moving but he was at a podium the next thing that he knew.
“I see that your greetings are about as similar as my own. Though I thought that with your self-righteous act back in Brooklyn that you would have thrown all of those away.” The man, whose face Steve couldn’t see, was pointing to the guns that everyone was holding. “Old habits. I’ve heard that they die young.” The man practically growled the last bit as guns shot out from the goons’ coats, all trained back on Steve’s family. The man held nothing. Arrogant.
Tony grinned even more darkly before throwing the shirt over his chest and walking back over to the desk to get started on the machine that would help him escape from this Hellhole.
Tony stared at the contraption that was lodged in his chest, connected to the car battery. “What is this? What have you done to me?” Tony growled, his Merchant voice showing through his demeanor.
“Sorry sir, but I just thought you’d like to know that the gang you were talking about… They crossed over into Manhattan. Loki’s keeping an eye on them, but he seemed nervous when he saw who they were.” Tony’s brow creased at that. It was difficult to get the foreign man nervous, Tony knew first hand. It took a lot to get Loki to even agree to join them, much less allow Tony to be the one in charge of what he was doing. For a gang to make Loki nervous was rattling enough.
Someday he was going to make them pay for disturbing his quiet time that he had to himself when he was in his office.
” The phone line disconnected. Tony’s heart was starting to race when the silence was filled with the dial tone. Standing up from his chair Tony quickly raced to where he kept his spar suit and called up some of his other family members. “I don’t care, Logan, just get there.” He growled into the phone, pushing up his tie in time to curse at the fact that he’d gotten a finger stuck in the knot somehow. “Call Wilson, tell him to bring all the guns. Yes, I’m being serious. This is Loki! He doesn’t hang up on me unless he’s in trouble or actually pissed off with me… Just get there.”
He shook his head. “I’m afraid that I have several of my secretaries looking for this file. If I can’t find it I’m afraid that you’ll be out of luck.” He noticed Steve bite his lip, though Tony didn’t make a show that he noticed, nor did he acknowledge the light tremor deep in his gut at the sight.
Yinsen didn’t call him by his name. “TO-Y!” His eyes flashed open. Tony was holding on to the hands of Bruce, who had his hands clenched into Tony’s shirt. He stared between them, looking back and forth between Bruce and their hands. “Tony…” The gentleness of the words caught Tony’s attention. Bruce seemed sad. “This is real Tony, you aren’t in Afghanistan.” Tony’s grip became harder. “I promise, Tony. You’re home.” They released one another, and Tony glanced around. The lab was the same, though their chairs were toppled over now. Bruce must have grabbed him to keep him from falling. Tony rubbed at his chest. It hurt, and it felt hard to breathe. “Loki’s supposed to be coming by later. There were some people doing small business on the docks, wanted your input about what to do about them.”
He shook his head. That wasn’t something that he needed to look into. He was young when he graduated from MIT. He was young when his father was taken from him. He was young when he’d killed his first man with his father’s handgun. There wasn’t anything wrong with being young. The door behind him opened, and Tony wondered when he’d turned towards the windows at all.
“I wouldn’t touch that. It’s the only thing keeping your heart from being ripped apart.” Tony glanced around to find the source and took note of the older gentlemen that emerged from the darkness. He looked nice, his demeanor. Tony thought he was a good judge of character, he trusted his judgment on this. He was bald, had thin glasses on his face, wore what Tony would presume was once a suit.
Tony was drunk when they happened so he couldn’t recall the names, but in his haze, he could remember that they were important to some other gang in Manhattan. It was to keep his family safe. They were necessary… So why did he wake up in sweat at the vague memory of their scared faces? The blood splattering over the concrete. The final screams of two dying men. Tony didn’t know why.
“Didn’t expect you here.” Tony stated, “Shouldn’t you be… stalking?” Loki sighed, putting down his latte and taking off the glasses. His hard stare was enough to make Tony regret his joking nature to the raven-haired man. There was a good-sized bruise forming over the man’s face. It was partially hidden due to the concealer that Loki had likely swiped from Tony’s bathroom.
Early? Possibly... Because I've been writing this without much complication. Also, Panic! At the Disco is oddly good music to listen to while writing and editing.
Tony wanted to spit in his smug face. Barnes was grinning at Tony from ear to ear. His hands were out in front of him, not bound per Roger’s request, but he was told to keep them where Roger’s could see them.
Slowly Tony got to his feet, shuffling quietly to where he kept his darkest shades, grumbled mutely to himself before walking to the stairs. Tony could only assume that Obie was just a few floors down. Jarvis told Tony when to stop and slowly opened the door to the floor. There was quiet piano music playing, but Tony felt like it was heavy metal with how jarring it was to his eardrums. “Obie, there better be a good reason as to why you’re here.”
It wasn’t uncommon for Tony to wonder if it would be more enjoyable if some of his family were here with him. Watching a movie with him like a real family. All of them laughing over the jokes on screen, someone being made fun of for crying when the protagonist ‘dies’ close to the end of the movie.
It was quiet that morning. Tony sipped on a cup of coffee waiting, just waiting for the illusion to drop, for it all to come crashing down and to have it be revealed as the cave once more. For Yinsen’s minimal cooking efforts to waft their small area. A joke. Some snark. Anything to indicate that what Tony was doing wasn’t actually real. “Tony?” He turned and saw Bruce walk in, his hair messed up from his sleep and he rubbed tiredly at his eyes. “It’s six in the morning, were you in your lab all night?” Tony glanced at the contents of his lab. Nothing was complete on any of the tables except for a couple of coffee mugs that still had the stains from the previous contents.
At least they were until Tony’s other phone started to go off. The CEO groaned, having JARVIS pull up the caller I.D and scowling. “Obie this better be important.” He growled, scooting away from the workbench to glare at the screen.
The man grinned and started speaking. Saying Tony’s name, his legacy, what they wanted him to do. “They want you to build that.” Yinsen handed the photo to Tony, the Jericho burning its image into Tony’s mind.
Sitwell left then, pack behind him. Next up was Peter. The teen was packing away his minimal supplies, and Steve made a mental note to go out with him to get some materials that really belonged to him. “How’s packing?”
Tony’s thought process finally caught up with him. “Son of a b&$^@.” He snapped the file shut with anger, curling it in his fist before releasing. “He walked in without my knowledge of who he was.” Pepper seemed to shift uncomfortably from side to side, waiting. On soft feet, Tony walked around his desk to pull up his private server. There he typed in all the search codes that would take him to the file. The Irish Mob file.
They made several turns, and Tony was still 99% sure of where they were simply by the sounds alone. Nearly to the port. Warehouse district.
Bucky went still. His relationship with his father wasn’t strained, that was true. Bucky hadn’t had it as bad as Steve did, his father stuck around. Bucky’s dad wasn’t a man of many emotions, but he didn’t get angry with Bucky often. He taught Bucky a lot of what he knew. How to fish, hunt, fight, even taught him to cook should the need arise. “No, he sure didn’t.” He answered, gulping down some of the bile that was starting to rise in his throat.
With a small smile gracing his face Steve walked over to the woman. She sat on a windowsill of the warehouse. Her body was small enough to fit there without much effort or strain. Her knees were pulled up to her chest, and she clasped her hands together. Steve leaned against the wall to face her. “With how silently you walk I can’t say that I’m really all that shocked.” She nodded, “What brought this on?”
“Tony. Always good to see you in good spirits.” Bruce’s gentle voice was almost like music to the CEO’s ears. The other had been away from the states for over three months and it was too long for Tony to be away from his science brother. Behind Bruce followed Obadiah, sunglasses spread over his face and an easy grin over his lips. Tony directed Bruce away from his right-hand man towards his Audi. Bruce didn’t seem to question Tony’s sudden hurriedness towards the car, though he did raise a brow when Tony ignored Obie’s voice and shut the door behind them. “Fight with Obie again?”
There was a curdling feeling in Steve’s stomach at the thought of Peter meeting up with such a dangerous man, but he didn’t plan to leave him alone with Tony. He would never put Peter in harm's way like that. But Steve only got to wonder what it was that the boy wanted to possibly talk with the Merchant of Death about.
Tony coughed up more of the water as Yinsen patted his back to expel more of the water from his lungs. He really hated terrorists. “You finally agreed?” Yinsen asked, finally sitting back and staring at Tony. The CEO nodded but didn’t stop scowling.
Steve glanced at the kid. He wondered what Peter enjoyed doing. Roger’s could only guess that the kid felt supremely bored and out of it. Everyone around him was a lot older besides the twins, but even they were closer to upper classmen than freshmen. Steve opened his mouth but shut it just as fast when Clint slammed through the doorway.
“I make the best. No one else in the firearms industry can match up to what I can make. I get offers from the military left and right for the guns that I could provide them. I’m not that worried about my significance to the Merchant.” Both men seemed to stiffen up more at his statement. Tony wondered what they had been expecting. He could guess that they were hoping that Tony would become worried with his place in the family, as the supplier. But they didn’t know Manhattan like Tony did. They didn’t know who was the strongest.
“Say what you will, anyone that sees you and doesn’t make some sort of move to try and bed you would be an insult. To you and all of America.” Tony shrugged before sitting down, propping his feet up on his desk without much of a care.
Please note that I'll be going back to earlier chapters and removing or adding to them. When I update the next chapter I'll list it at the beginning where all the changes happened that way you know where to look and keep caught up with the chaos that is coming to this story :)
The docks weren’t Tony’s favorite. Trades happened there, along with other unmentionable activities, but he was called there early that morning before he could drink his coffee. Rough hands rubbed over his eyes and a grimace was the first thing that formed on his face when met with his docks manager. “Found him like this last night. Bullet, in and out, and his eyes wide open.” The docks manager pointed a few feet away from where a man and some of Tony’s men were sitting. They seemed to be overlooking the docks. As if they were friends catching up before work. Tony ignored them.
“Laufeyson is an informant for the Italian Mob.” Steve turned away from the view of Manhattan to look back at Natasha. Her fiery red hair was tame in the shadows of the warehouse. Her eyes seemed darker than they had been in Brooklyn, almost more paranoid. Steve wished that he knew how to help her feel more at ease, but there was a lot that he himself didn’t know how to handle. The Merchant knew their hideout, they were probably being watched even worse now, and he didn’t know the man real name… Just who his supplier was. Steve sighed, shrugging his shoulders as a means to allow her to be closer.
Tony shook his head, “I think you forget that I am my own best client. Suppose I was curious what it was like off American soil.” Steve narrowed his eyes but did well to keep his fists from clenching. When Tony had been announced to have been found Steve had thought that it was his perfect opportunity. Tony would be vulnerable, disoriented, not have time to contact anyone. He would have the upper hand and convince Tony that he had more power in Manhattan than Tony realized and make a truce to keep from the bloodshed. But instead what Steve found was a broken man… A broken man that had only been looking for a reason to fall off the edge.
Once they pulled into the private garage of the tower Tony walked into the building with Loki not too far behind. What Tony saw next was surprising. In front of him, in his lobby, was Steve Rogers and James Barnes. The CEO had stopped in the doorway and had his hands behind his back. He sent a sign to Loki before walking in with a grin on his face. “Captain! I wasn’t expecting you.”
Bucky sighed, “The Merchant and Stark are hard to read. They might be good family friends. Howard, Tony’s father, was the boss before the Merchant. I’m a little shocked that Tony didn’t take over the mob himself… But perhaps Tony didn’t want to or felt he wouldn’t be able to with the company. It was hard on Howard to keep both going without the family getting hurt. It’s something that my father and Howard disagreed about a lot.” Peter nodded.
“The h$%^ I can’t!” Tony barked, standing abruptly. “Tell Hogan to get the car ready, I’ll be needed a ride home then I have a few things to handle before I go after I friend, Grant Roger’s.”
He noticed the strain that seemed to come off of the right-hand man. “Why is Steve out here now?” Peter wanted to slap his hand over his mouth, he hadn’t meant to ask that but Bucky seemed amused enough.
“Mister Osborne is the reason that my best friend died.” Tony’s eyes found the kid’s then, his eyes hard. There was that starting gleam in the kid’s eye, the kind that Tony knew too well. “His son. Harry… We grew up together, practically brother’s. But then… Mr. Osborne did something to him, made him get really violent and he lashed out one day at the school. Sent him home, Harry wasn’t seen for another week. Then that turned into two then three. I tried to visit from time to time but no one would let me in, even though I frequented the place a lot.” Peter scratched the top of his head absentmindedly, too caught up in his tale, “When they announced Harry’s death in the paper I was shocked. I called Mr. Osborne but he just told me that Harry got really sick and just died. When I asked what sickness, it was, he wouldn’t tell me. Said it would just, ‘make me paranoid’. I don’t think I had much of a right not to be paranoid. So, I went to the business building, investigated myself. Harry told me that he’d been over at Oscorp the day before he acted out. I thought I would start there.” By this point, the wringing hands were starting to push up the sleeves of Peter’s jacket. He presented his left arm up towards Tony, who only glanced at it. “When I went in there, no one spoke to me. I walked past some security, but they seemed like they were in a daze. And when I got to the bio floor… It was like a bloodbath had occurred.” This grabbed Tony’s attention. For once The Merchant was silent. “I walked into, tried to see if anyone was alive that I could call to get help for, but before I could do that I wa-was bitten by this spider.” Peter pulled a small jar from his jacket and put it down on the table. A dead spider laid inside.
‘I like the colors, Jarvis,’ the child spoke, tilting his head to the side as he gazed up at the piece.
‘The sacrifices you’ve made. I assume you fought in the latest war, Afghanistan? I think it’s easy to forget what you guys do for all of us back home, so thank you,’ Tony reached over to clap Steve’s knee.
‘Are you implying we’ll do this again?’ Tony asked, bewildered as he slumped back against the cushions, unsure if he was hurt or amused by the whole situation. Did he even want to see Steve again?
Still watching Steve, Tony could see that his want to help was genuine. The man wore his heart on his sleeve, which made Tony wonder if he was desperate to find something wrong with him. JARVIS might not have been able to find out information about him when he was younger, but maybe that was a clerical error, or he’d just been a very quiet teen.
Pepper pulled back, waiting until he looked up. Her eyes were filled with furious tears, and he reached up to wipe them away.
It hadn’t felt like this before, granted, he was usually the one that did most of the seducing when it came to women, the one expected to top. With guys he could go either way, but when he bottomed it was never like this, not this teasing with fire, lingering and drawn out, exploring every inch of Tony’s neck to find the sensitive spots, and then exploiting them until he was writhing with pleasure.
‘I feel like this story is just a way to entice women, you know how they all like a tragic love story, chicks eat that stuff up.’
Looking at him for a moment, trying to work out if he was lying or if she was going to get in trouble, she finally reached into her draw for a post-it, writing the address down. Her hand shook as he took it, and he winked at her, dropping his sunglasses back down as he left the gallery.
It’d been a while since he’d been kissed like this, unhurried, languid, each moment stretching into the next. Usually, it was a precursor to the actual sex, a warmup, becoming acquainted with each other’s body, but Steve was breathing him in between kisses, hands stroking through Tony’s hair like he couldn’t quite believe he was here.
‘You’re safe here, Tony, I’m here. I won’t let anything hurt you,’ Steve promised. Tony felt a weight on his chest, a hand covering his scar. Instead of flinching away from it, he managed to muster the strength to bring his own hand up and flop it on top of Steve’s, nestling closer with his head before allowing himself to sleep.
‘Apparently, they’re not.’ Tony bit down on his lip, refusing to think of how he’d rushed out of Steve’s apartment a few days ago. Steve hadn’t stopped him, just as he promised, hadn’t even moved in regard to Tony’s reaction.
‘Alright, Tony,’ Steve whispered, tugging a blanket out from behind the couch, a fluffy black thing that he drew around Tony’s shoulders, hesitantly draping his arm on the back of the couch behind Tony’s head. They didn’t say anything more for a few minutes, watching the steam from the mugs curl into the air, listening to the pattering against the windows.
Kisses melted from one into another, leaving them both breathless and panting, Tony’s body warming from both the kisses and Steve’s proximity. Steve pulled away with a gasp, darkened blue eyes gazing down at him in wonderment, making Tony squirm under the scrutiny. Usually, he lived for the spotlight, craved the attention, but there was something different about Steve. He could see through all the bluster, saw Tony for who he really was, and it left him feeling vulnerable, something he hadn’t felt since Stane.
‘My soulmate, yup. My eternal ever living bullshitting soulmate,’ Tony growled, kicking the edge of the desk. It was fitting really, his soulmate had to be immortal, not originally his, but the first reincarnation of his soul. Did he even matter, was he just an extension of the ones who came before him?
‘Soulmates, the thing you’ve been looking for and won’t admit to yourself. Our soulmates have been affected by the same magic, or science, or whatever it was they gave us,’ Steve said dismissively, like the how wasn’t important.
‘Uh huh, so strong that I sleep about and don’t make any real connections, strong enough that I hide in my workshop creating things and avoiding board members,’ Tony spat, crossing his arms over his chest, clicking Rhodey’s pen again.
‘Trust me, it wasn’t a compliment.’ Tony held Steve still as he tried to pull away. ‘Have you ever considered that you can be so self-sacrificing that you become self-centered? You’re acting in what you think are my best interests because you’re sacrificing yourself for the cause, for what you believe to be my greater good. You haven’t asked me what I wanted.’
‘JARVIS,’ Tony answered, vaguely pointed at the direction of the ceiling with the bottle of wine. ‘Red okay?’
‘Anyway, that’s enough about me, who are you, Steve Rogers?’ Tony turned the tables, genuine curiosity in his voice now. Who was this man who made secrets tumble from his lips like this?
Toying with the idea of lying, Tony put the bottle on the kitchen counter, stretching up on his toes to reach into the kitchen cupboard for some glasses. This was usually where his male dates would press along his back, the bottle of wine forgotten about as they made out, but Steve didn’t move.
‘Baby,’ Steve breathed, moaning and pressing forward when Tony reached down and took over, feeling the length and girth of Steve in his hand, glad they hadn’t had sex yet. He would need a lot of preparation to take him.
‘I am, Mr Stark, but a gentleman still has eyes,’ Steve drawled, gently biting the side of Tony’s knee as he slid his hands beneath Tony’s ass, gripping hard and then moaning low under his breath at the give of Tony’s flesh.
There were times in life where you could just look at an object and know it was treasured, the worn fur of a child’s favorite teddy bear, the imprint on a person’s finger where their wedding ring sat… looking inside the box, Tony could immediately tell these items were precious. Peeling back a brown paper bag, Tony could see letters nestled inside, carefully wrapped with twine, and he placed them carefully on the mattress, before picking up a small photo album.
‘You’ve been hurt…much more than I realized. God, Tony, I wish I’d found you sooner, that I could’ve protected you from all those who-’
This didn’t feel like anything like that, this felt stronger, an ache that burrowed deep and hooked its claws into the delicate flesh of his organs, tugging with every heartbeat.
‘No, he’s not!’ Tony threw the pen against the wall, panting as he stared down at it. ‘I’m not, I’m not the soulmate, I’m just a collection of past selves, it’s the original one he loved, I’m just a copycat, a pale imitation-’
‘Tony that was like over two hundred years ago, there wouldn’t be any paper copies of secrets from back then, anything
‘Happened six times so far, and in only one of those reincarnations did we stay together to the end of their natural life. The others, it was too much for them, we came together for a brief moment, drawn together as soulmates are and then…I let them go again.’ Steve’s fingers twitched in the air, like he was imagining the loss all over again.
Taking a gulp of his wine that was probably meant to be savored, Tony reached out to place it on the coffee table, mirroring Steve’s position on the couch.
Steve heard him padding towards the kitchen and he turned to look, his gaze going to the scar on Tony’s chest peeping out from the ridiculously big T-shirt. The coffee mug he’d been holding thudded back to the counter ominously, Steve’s eyes narrowing the longer he stared at it.
‘Yup, Tony Stark in the flesh,’ he smiled, leaning against her desk with a hand. The gallery wasn’t any different to any he’d been in before, gleaming hardwood floors, brilliant white walls that served as the perfect contrast to the colorful pieces of art. He spied a few patrons moving around with leaflets in hand, a few nudging elbows with each other and staring at him.
Opening his eyes, he smiled as he watched Tony’s fingers clench open and shut, searching for Steve across the mattress even in sleep.
‘I can see it, the way you light up when you talk to JARVIS, the way you just spoke about DUM-E, you’re an inventor, Tony,’ Steve said firmly.
‘So, you’re showing me a really old painting that looks like me?’ Tony asked, confused. He had an eerie sense about this, a tingling that tore its way up his spine, leaving a lingering coldness, a sense of déjà vu.
‘It all sounds like fairytales, doesn’t it? spooky stories to scare children, occult science, the supernatural, I didn’t believe it either. But that wasn’t how they spun it to us in the army, we were losing the war, and we wanted to win.’ Steve stretched his legs out, resting the back of his hands on his knees, staring at his loosely curled fingers.
Tony could feel the heat in his face as he walked on the sidewalk, people parting around him as he jammed his hands into his pockets, gaze on the ground.
‘Still, the threat was clear, and I do not doubt Miss Potts’ ability to dismantle me if she put her mind to it.’
Steve’s place was a mess, which surprised Tony, considering his military background. It was a loft in Brookyln, not a place he often frequented, but he found it endearing how Steve became flustered, picking up hoodies from the back of his slate grey L shaped couch, throwing them all towards the kitchen part of the open plan loft. Tony checked in with JARVIS before he toed his shoes off near the door, padding across the plush carpet towards a sketch book.
‘Go sit on the couch, Tony, I’ll be there in a minute,’ Steve said curtly, turning his back to Tony, fiddling with the spoon in the other mug.
What was bothering him was the lack of information about Steve Rogers from when he was younger. His birth certificate checked out, born on Independence Day, zodiac sign Cancer, blood type O, but it was as if nothing existed from a few years ago, no indication of college, schools.
His breaths that had been coming in lustful pants took on a different edge, panic beginning to settle in, threading through the lust and splintering it, his mind spinning from the lurch of one emotion to another.
He only gave the art piece a cursory glance, wanting to experience it instead through the child’s eyes, yearning to find out more about him. Steve needed to reassure himself that this small boy was okay, that he was happy in life.
‘I don’t think so? I mean, I saw you when you first arrived with your friend. I think we might have made eye contact.’ Steve’s voice rumbled, rolling over Tony in a caress. Raising his champagne glass to his mouth, Steve wet his lips with the bubbly liquid, capturing Tony’s attention, wishing he could reach up and kiss the droplets from his bottom lip.
Unable to sit any longer, Steve got to his feet, blending into the crowd as he inched his way closer, knowing he shouldn’t influence any part of the child’s life, but desperate for any scrap of information about him.
‘I’m not doing this right if you’re still thinking,’ Steve murmured over his lips, scattering whatever Tony had just been thinking about, his mind filled only with Steve.
‘Sir likes to play with words, I am called Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, or JARVIS as an acronym,’ JARVIS answered.
‘Yeah, something about a curse, or a punishment or something, it’s a fairy tale,’ Tony said dismissively, before realizing he was insulting the painter, and that Steve was said painter. ‘This is your piece, isn’t it? Your inspiration I’m being dismissive of…’
‘I’ve always hid behind…well, me,’ Tony said, wrapping his arms around himself, ‘or what people thought of me, the Tony Stark persona. I’ve been hurt, watched my father destroy my mother because of their soulmate bond, betrayed by someone I thought…’ Tony’s throat seized.
Disconcerted he moved, instinctively heading towards Happy before he realized the feeling wasn’t ominous. Demanding yes, but not malicious. The feeling chased him as he moved over to the canvases, spotlights beneath each piece illuminating them. He caught Pepper’s gaze as he walked, watching her laugh with a group of people.
‘Tony?’ Steve gasped out, his hair unstyled and flopping over his forehead, fingers smudged with what looked like charcoal. ‘What are you…what’s wrong, are you hurt-’
He wondered if Tony felt the inexplicable urge Steve carried with him, the sense of missing a part of himself, the itch of feeling something was not quite right.
Tony did as he was meant to, the part he’d been assigned. He posed for photos with those that asked, signed autographs, listened to people gush about his company, and listened just as patiently to those who accused him of not knowing what Stane was doing. That he somehow had known about the weapons being sold under the table, that he’d faked his stay in hospital.
He held the hand of an adult, not his father, Steve had spent countless years studying the features of a human face, and he could see nothing that suggested a familial link between the two. It was possible the child took after his mother, but Steve could see by the way he held the adult’s hand, the polite detached way in which he answered, that this wasn’t his father.
‘Jesus,’ Steve reached out like he wanted to touch Tony, like he wanted to reassure himself that he was okay.
‘The painting was meant to bring you over here, my personality was meant to win you over,’ Steve teased back.
‘Tony, if you want privacy then why not meet at your lab?’ Rhodey whispered down at him, interrupting the guilt that was gnawing away.
‘Why do I keep getting all the shitty parts out of life? Why couldn’t I get the soulmate everyone else gets?’
‘I always wanted one you know, as much as I pretended I didn’t. I love Pepper and Rhodey, like, I would murder for them type of love, but I wanted…I wanted the romance, someone that understood me.’ Tony stared down at the edges of his toes peeping out from the fabric pooling at his feet, knowing how pathetic he looked, how wretched he sounded.
‘You’re immortal. You’re one of those…those,’ Tony couldn’t find the words. ‘Why are you telling me this?’
‘As you can see, I know next to nothing about art,’ he gestured up at the piece. ‘I’m here to help the charity auction, and I was looking for something for my friend, which was why I was laughing, not at this piece, this piece is terrifying,’ Tony rambled.
Steve felt his hand lift, wanting to reassure Tony, but he let it fall to his side, knowing there was nothing he could do. The kindest thing he could do was walk away from Tony, protecting him from the entangled heartache waiting for him in the future.
‘Not in the slightest. Like I was trying to say earlier, I have cared about every version of you, tried to do my best to care for you, even from a distance, but you’re different Tony.’
‘Because you’ve not been to any events in the past month and I’m sick of making excuses for you,’ Pepper hissed out through her clenched teeth smile. Gliding forward, she nodded greetings to the other guests, still dragging Tony behind her in a waft of expensive perfume and a rustling silk dress.
‘It’s fine,’ Tony cut him off. He wouldn’t be the first person who misunderstood, who thought Tony never cared about anything, just throwing his money at problems, too arrogant to roll his sleeves up and help others.
“He didn’t just die before we met,” Tony says, voice flat and smooth despite the harsh alcohol that should burn his throat, “Did I mention that before?” he laughs humourlessly, “He died before I was
Until one drink is three, and Tony’s three drinks are six and Steve’s not feeling much of anything from Bucky because he’s drunk and Tony’s drunk and beautiful.
Tony had never minded Steve in the workshop, though. Not for that one weird week a month, or at any other time. He was quiet when he was in Tony’s space. Tony always continued to talk to himself and to Jarvis, and sometimes Steve spoke up or spent some time tidying after Tony and the bots. There had never been any alpha posturing in the lab. They saved that for when it mattered. When the team was around. The lab had always been their safe space. Tony’s safe space. Until it wasn’t.
He had very different feelings for each of the super-soldiers he lived with, but in the end, it was the same result. He’d give either of them
Big, bright eyes stare up at Tony through dark lashes as Steve does his best to draw unimaginable pleasure from his body.
“No,” Tony said, “I never showed anyone,” he says and then grins, “My father lost his mind over the ink,” Tony says, “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he laughs, “When I came home that summer from boarding, you know, my parents were all excited, couldn’t wait to see it, all that family stuff, coming of age, whatever,” he shakes his head, “I thought my mother was going to faint,” he tell Steve, “Jarvis was sure it was fake for a solid year before he realized,” he sighed like the memory was happy though, and Steve thinks that for Tony that sounds about right.
Steve smiled, shaking his head, “Of course you’ve got a number for that,” he said fondly, “Do you have anything I can use in Bucky’s hair?” he asked seriously.
But then Tony’s eyes flicker open with a pained sound, and Steve realises that was exactly was he has been doing.
“Tony,” Steve said, “you need sleep, too” he reminded, gently, “I know you’re going to the lab…” he trailed off.
Even knowing this about himself, Steve doesn’t want to drop it. He doesn’t want to stop thinking about Tony’s soulmate. He doesn’t really want to think about his own. Not in any way that matters. Not in any way that does anyone any good because he’s instead thinking about Tony.
Steve didn’t bother to answer, and that should have tipped Tony off somehow, but those thoughts somehow fell and clattered dully in the back of his head and his brain hyper focused on
As if in response to Tony’s mental musings, Bucky scrambled into the bed and laid down on the far side, a good four feet between him and Steve.
, and guilt washes over him. Besides, Natasha was talking about a different form of jealousy anyway.
“He died before we met,” Tony said with a shrug, casual, “I imagine he was a better man for it,” he said with a wink and a sultry smile.
When Steve and Tony start arguing, the whole team is suddenly alight with nervous energy, and it only makes Steve more pissed with Tony.
One of those pesky twenty-first century cultural shifts that Steve just couldn’t wrap his head around.
Bucky wasn’t actually asking. That was the thing. Tony was sure that the fact Bucky didn’t come right out and ask was the only reason Tony said yes.
He dreams of Tony waking up. He dreams of their wedding. He dreams of Tony dying. He dreams of the stench of the hospital even on the nights he’s on Bucky’s couch and not in the armchair beside Tony.
When the other man saw Steve shift, he immediately hid his flesh hand behind his back. It looked like he had it near his mouth, and Steve wondered if he had another popsicle stick. He was pretty sure he’d taken both.
“You’re all about the meaninglessness of soulmarks,” Steve says, “I figured if you could, you’d have looked mine up to make a point,” he says.
“Aw man,” Sam had said, “I wish I could help more, but uh,” he scratched the back of his neck, “I don’t think he likes me enough anymore,” he chuckled, self-deprecating.
“I want to,” Tony said, and his answer was immediate, like he’s been thinking about it a long time. Steve supposes he must be. He did say he thought he’d be a worse man had he had his soulmate.
Steve hadn’t reacted poorly to Tony’s proximity either. Tony had taken that as permission and stepped closer. Steve had
Temporary like sobriety. Temporary like laughter. Like seasons. Like the sun. Like the city lights reflecting in Steve’s eyes.
It wasn’t Steve who had made the noise, he noticed a second later, when Jarvis popped up a message on his screen.
It’s not real when Tony’s hands grasp Steve’s tiny fucking waist. It’s not real when he pulls Steve into his lap and the other man comes willingly.
. But he knew they would never work. They were both alphas. So, Tony always tried so hard to keep himself in line, and for the most part it worked.
And when Tony is awake enough to be coherent? He takes Steve’s breath again, lost on a gasping laugh.
Even more painful was meeting Sam and feeling that bond with him too. It was a bond that Steve the Alpha could not make of course, and he used that as a comfort when he saw Bucky standing on that bridge and not knowing who he was.
Bucky glared again and didn’t comment further. He finished his smoothie and left Clint standing there instead.
Steve doesn’t have the words, but it’s okay because Tony keeps talking and Steve keeps listening, “I tried to make it about me. Why wouldn’t I? It’s not like I had a soulmate to consider in it all,” he says flatly, “But then I sat down to design the damn thing and here we are,” he says this last part with a small smile, and it gives Steve the confidence to speak next.
like he can barely breathe for how Tony’s scent, dark, rich, warm, had begun the slow deadly process of replacing blood and oxygen in his body.
He’s timidly afraid of Bruce, and depending on the day, he either tries to shield Steve from him, or tries to hide behind the smaller man. He extends a friendly and casual confidence around Clint, and he even talks to Jarvis like a person who is part of the team.
Steve found it hard to believe someone as down to earth and kind as Tony was most of the time, could seriously believe such things about soulmates.
Steve looked over his shoulder at Tony, concerned, confused, seeking guidance Tony wasn’t sure he was giving when he said,
Sugar sweet with every shallow breath Tony drags in. Spicy, sharp, and clean peppermint in his lungs.
He’d come to Bucky about a week afterwards and introduced him to sign language. Bucky was slow, and didn’t
He’s too set on his task, and the whole thing is so undeniably Steve that it’s what makes Tony come undone.
He traps Tony inside him with his legs around Tony’s hips, bares his throat to Tony in apparent submission, but he pulls Tony’s hair with a too tight grip as if to remind Tony whose body he’s inside of.
“Don’t be,” he said, “You look like you slept, I feel like a slept, and Steve didn’t leave me at ass o’clock in the morning to go running,” he gave a pointed look at Steve, who put down his book and smiled.
Bucky shook his head, made a horrible choked off whimper and rasped, “Stevie?” in that small, scared voice of his.
When Tony followed orders without fighting him, Steve saw it as pity. When Tony fought him, questioned him, or ignored him, Steve saw it as a challenge.
Tony does end up staring at Steve the majority of the time he’s there, but Steve’s too busy with the bots and his insistent tidying to notice. Steve’s scent was getting everywhere, touching things in every corner of the space and Tony shouldn’t be as pleased as he is at that, but he is.
Tony’s not looking at Barnes. He’s got his eye on the sky-blue shirt peeking out from under the pillow.
Reality had changed to something good. To something beautiful. To something Steve could never experience without Tony.
At least Steve hadn’t left right away, on that first occasion. No, Steve had stayed for a few good weeks of bickering before be left and spent a few good months with Natasha in DC and when they got back, for once Tony had actually thought Steve might have had something to over-compensate for, but he didn’t say anything because Sam was a useful ally even if Steve had brought him home from a park.
He had known there was a pattern since he got the serum. It had been fine. He hadn’t regretted his decision to have his designation changed. Not really. It was all in his head, the feeling he had gotten of being weaker than normal, getting overwhelmed by scents, wanting to be alone and in some small, dark place that was ten degrees hotter than the air outside. All in his head.
The more Steve sees of Tony’s tattoo over the week, the more he thinks about it. One of the things that Steve has noted about Tony’s tattoo that really prove it a memorial more than a disrespect, is that it isn’t actually a cover-up tattoo the way he had thought.
Its different for Steve because he thinks that if he had made better choices, if he made it home after the war, he would have found his soulmate. A missed connection is still a connection nonetheless.
No one else seems to want to talk about it. Or, if they do, they have no interest in talking about Steve’s temporary omega status with the alpha who fights with him every time they’re in the field together.
, because Sam had told him he couldn’t live off plant-based-protein powder, which was all Hydra had told him he could consume, and that he was to obtain it often if he was ever unable to return to his handler.
He wonders for a few days if that is only because of how dull and lifeless Tony looks in a hospital bed. If it’s just the contrast that makes him brighter in that memory.
“You spoiled the surprise, that’s not like you,” Tony whispers, concern lining his already hallow face.
“Yeah, you have,” Tony mumbles to himself, then looks up sharply, “It’s all over the internet,” he says, then winks a second late.
Tony sits at the table, Steve abandons his place in the coffee que and sits next to him. Brings his bare feet up on the chair with him, rests a slightly flushed cheek to his knees and closes his eyes.
Steve crawls out of bed past ten, and he’s dressed in fleece pants and a too big sweatshirt waiting for the coffee to finish brewing. The sweatshirt is alpha-Steve sized and familiar, it’s more of a dress on his slight frame now.
Steve can’t tell what kind of bird it is, not with the way the reactor has become the centerpiece in place of the bird’s head and upper body, but he isn’t sure he needs to know in order to understand. The body language is enough, the great bird looks strong and powerful, proud, yet at the same time the wings curve in slightly, like this bird of prey is readying to strike when it is not. Steve knows this because there is already something clutched in the bird’s deadly talons. Maybe, Steve thinks, they bird is protecting something.
Sam and Natasha were still his least favourites. Natasha tried to… tried to sympathize in this strange silent way that he didn’t like it. She reminded him of Hydra, of pain and hurt and obedience and violence and death trapped behind the thin curtain of his flesh.
Steve leans up to capture Tony’s lips, and when they pull away, Tony hovering above Steve, their bodies connected, Tony rests his forehead to Steve’s and breathes raggedly.
Pepper doesn’t say anything when she see’s it a few days later, but she hugs him extra tight and Steve pretends he doesn’t notice.
Let Tony slot himself into the space between Steve’s spread thighs and rut their clothed cocks together until he makes them both cum.
Tony looks away then, takes his turn in the decon shower, and yet Steve see’s nothing but the image of Tony’s torso, like the image is burned into his eyelids for the 3 minutes that Tony hoses down.
In the answering silence of Steve’s shock, Tony adds softer, “So I kind of have to, you know?” and his voice is far away and distant, “Think it’s all meaningless, that is,” and his smile is nothing but a fragile and cracked mask, “Wouldn’t want to assign that more meaning than it’s worth and all,” he huffs shaking his head.
With Sam, he’d started out trying for the same easy and teasing relationship that Bucky had formed with Tony and that he had always had with Steve. He even tried a few different nicknames with varying degrees of no success.
Over the backs of his hands, on his knuckles. A white line split against his jaw. A tangle of white over his knees. A burn on his wrist.
Tony feels eyes on them in a way Steve is too out of it to understand. Even still, he only pays attention to Barnes. Nat and Sam too, though they are secondary to Steve’s true bonded pack.
He thought maybe he should have been jealous, but he wasn’t. Bucky was a mess of thoughts and feelings, sex falling incredibly low on the list of his priorities and then Steve was making even more noises, ones that sounded a little less pained than before and how could Bucky be jealous when someone was making Steve feel that good? When Steve had given himself over to someone
“Open up, baby doll,” Tony had said, voice teasing. Tony’s voice was often teasing. He had many names for Bucky.
He listened as Bucky’s breathing slowed to match more closely with Steve, signifying that Bucky was actually asleep this time.
Tony’s fingers sliped on the zip of Steve’s suit though, and Steve… Steve should have stopped him. Should have checked in.
Clint actually helped in that department, having been the first besides Tony and Steve to realize Bucky was
Not when Steve had feinted a moment later even though he had just shaken unconsciousness off to yell at Tony.
Steve came back, small, smiling, wearing big, grandpa tortoiseshell glasses and smelling like peppermint.
Autopilot kicks on. Steve showers. Eats. Lays motionless on Bucky’s couch, and when the other man has finally left Steve alone, the box reappears to sit on Steve’s chest.
“Hey,” Tony replied, completely alert, which Bucky found odd, since Tony lived off caffeine and he assumed Tony was one of those people who didn’t function without it, “I’m wearing pants, so that’s a good sign,” he said, “but I can’t help notice there’s an extra super-soldier in my bed,” he said with a grin at Bucky.
, but how the hell was he supposed to throw that kind of trust back into the face of a man who was weary of Sam Wilson of all people? It was impossible, it was a level of cruel Tony firmly believed he could never be capable of. Still, he tried little things, just to see if maybe Bucky would prefer a more independent-but-still-trusting kind of friendship in place of the completely-dependent-I-trust-you-with-my-life level that they were at.
“Hmm? Oh, yeah, hang on,” he said, then began rifling through the cupboard. The bathroom was big enough to have a cupboard. It was crazy. The bathtub was just a small swimming pool, really.
On those nights, especially if Tony was smoking something a little more earthy than tobacco, they might talk about it.
The navy of the mask that covers Steve’s identity and scent brings out the gold in Steve’s hair and the blue of his eyes.
When Steve meets Sharon, she asks if they can do this the normal way, instead of immediately shoving her mark into his face and Steve appreciated it more than he can say really.
Steve was familiar. He was an obvious friend when Bucky knew nothing about what was happening. Bringing him to the tower, Bucky had been nearly delirious with fear and confusion, the only thing he understood was that Steve was there and in time, that he wasn’t being hurt.
Tony had to keep telling him, that Sam hadn’t known. He hadn’t known that Bucky had received all his nutrition through an IV or feeding tube for sixty years.
Now, Steve can tell the way his coffee scent smells just a little bit bitter with sorrow. Bittersweet, actually.
Tony supposes that he knew in that moment that Steve would be gone in the morning. Following the pull of his pack all over the globe, never stopping until he had his beta in his arms.
Natasha tells Steve that Tony is jealous, and Steve tries hard not to like the way that sounds, but then he recalls Tony’s own soulmate who is
him that Tony was safe, but rather it was Bucky eavesdropping on the couple while Bucky was still half convinced that he was a prisoner.
Sure, Tony had instincts that made him attracted to a certain type of man, and sure, Tony was controlling and cold and distant and had next to no pleasant social skills of his own and he had to piggy-back off of Pepper (and then Steve) like alpha’s usually did around people he couldn’t boss around. And sure, Tony was a natural protector and sure, he went into rut sometimes, but it didn’t matter much to him.
He especially kept his eyes from getting stuck on the inky black of the soulmark resting over her heart and on full display to the jet. Something that was even more taboo in Steve’s day than a woman stripping down to her bra and panties in a room full of men.
It cuts deep in his chest, tears him up inside. Turns his blood to ice in his veins. Burns him at the same time.
He has a momentary spike of fear, of panic, when he feels the weakness in his arms and legs, when he has to squint to make out the people in the room. Recalls being sick and weak and
When Steve woke up in 2011, finding that their kind of love was no longer a crime, he gave himself time to mourn Bucky all over again. Mourn what could have been. Still, Steve had long ago come to terms with the reality that if they had made it through the war, their relationship would have to end soon there after, when Steve married Peggy, and Bucky found his own wife.
. There is a certain high that comes from knowing something the Black Widow couldn’t figure out, but it’s short lived at best.
Steve’s soulmate remains a blurry face and no name in his mind, despite Sharon, despite everything else. He thinks it sort of has to be that way, less his brain make the jump and turn that unseen face into Tony’s.
Steve’s own heart pounds wildly in his chest, nearly deafening. Still, he can see the numbers on the screen, lit up a hopeful green.
Steve still felt his fingers itch to touch, to trace. The lines of Tony’s tattoo, the line of the soulmark he could still see but not in any way that could mean something between them. He balled his hands into fists instead. Tony’s own fingers traced though, almost subconsciously Tony’s thumb ran over the length of his soulmark as they spoke.
He lights up, and hands it to Steve before he’s identified the smokes origin. It’s answer enough that Tony hands it to Steve though, since he doesn’t bother sharing tobacco with him.
Tony sits up though, swings his legs around like he’s going to stand up and walk away without getting the final say, but he just reaches for his whiskey that he had been sipping at a leisure pace and then downs it.
Because Steve can’t say he won’t deserve it if his would-be husband hates him for this, but Tony certainly doesn’t deserve to be like
Tony was pretty good at interpreting non-verbal Bucky, he had a lot of practise with different pitched noises and context with the bots, but he… he had no idea what Bucky was trying to say now.
Bittersweet like hearing beautiful words that only belonged in this reality and knowing that it was ending.
It is so perfectly traditional, unlike the ones Steve has seen around the twenty-first century. Just like Steve’s mothers. It’s so perfectly traditional but for the arc-reactor blue diamond that sits inside the heart. The metal, when Steve’s shaking fingers make first contact, is familiar.
The next time they are both staying in the tower, Tony catches Steve as he’s sketching by the little gas stove pit they have up here, the setting sun cooling the air rapidly now as autumn creeps up on them.
“Shh,” Steve tried to soothe again, “You’re not in trouble, I promise,” he said, and put his book down slowly, telegraphing the movement.
Bucky gave up, pulled his knees to his chest and shrugged, because that’s all he could do. Nod, shake, shrug.
Tony laid there a while, listening to two sets of breathing, Steve’s slower than Bucky’s but both even and deep.
“Never again,” Tony hums, “Never again,” he kisses Steve once more, before settling back against the pillow, closing his eyes.
Steve does smell stressed though, and there’s a tightness in his body that Tony can recognize even though he’s lost a hundred pounds of muscle. The tension slowly seeps out of him as he cleans up though, as it often does, the neat freak.
“Me too,” Steve said, and for some reason he felt his cheeks heat when Tony looked at him and smiled.
Tony used his balled up and soiled top to wipe away the slime from the arc reactor, causing the dim blue to brighten considerably in the dark of the quinjet, but it also drew Steve’s eye to the light’s origin, despite the social decorum that said not to look at your topless teammate.
Steve can’t help but let his words get ahead of him again with the heat of Tony’s naked skin beside him, radiating warm enough that Steve thinks he can feel it through his own layers of canvas and Kevlar, “He must have been a good man,” Steve says softly, quiet between them.
Goes on when they did nothing but fight. When Steve over-compensated. When Steve left. When Steve came back.
He should have told them more about Bucky and what to expect. If he had, he would have saved everyone this headache.
He looked like an alpha, he acted like an alpha, and he almost smelled like one too, unless you had the heightened senses of an alpha or omega.
He scraps his teeth against Steve’s jaw instead, kisses the scar that lives there now, in this temporary body.
That’s how he found himself outside Steve and Tony’s room last night, stuck deep in that part of himself he wanted nothing more than to hide, and just needing his… his friends. His friends who cared for him.
The obligation that is keeping Steve in Tony’s workshop is obvious though. Tony just tries his best to keep the awkwardness a little less palpable.
Tony still continued to treat Sam and Nat like they belonged to Steve and getting too close might have meant something.
Moved to sit on the counter top because he couldn’t keep looking up at Tony or he might never have left.
That was apparently the wrong thing to do, Bucky flinched and screwed up his face, expecting contact.
“Not productive,” he replied. They always took up the same seat at the back of the place and people-watched, which was what they did now. “I can’t figure out how to
Bypassing the complement to his boyfriend, Steve was taken aback. Both by the revelation and by Bucky’s apparent peace with it.
It brings the burning in his shoulder to the very forefront of his brain and Steve couldn’t have ignored it, couldn’t have stopped the agony and suffering from flooding through his pack bond even if he had wanted to. He doesn’t want to stop it though.
Steve’s been numb, barely alive for months now. A shell of a man. Still, he feels even colder. Ever further from this reality and Tony is wheeled away for testing. Gone for hours at a time. Dr. Cho and Bruce sparing Steve the occasional smile with a frazzled edge and sleepless eyes.
He didn’t get to, unfortunately. He had a therapist appointment that day, and then he was going for smoothies with Clint, mostly to give Tony and Steve some time alone.
“You’re lying to him,” Tony spat at Fury when Steve failed to open his mouth to speak in the wake of the revelation. Of hearing Fury tell him his soulmate was alive and likely born here in the twenty-first century.
Two alphas on the same team? Not ideal. After all, that had been why Tony Stark was not recommended for the Avengers; because Captain America was a better leader, Iron Man an invaluable asset, but two alphas that close together was just unheard of.
A lot of what Tony had been doing was scientific. A lot of it was because it was Captain America. Most of it was because Tony wants Steve to be
It feels incredible, and Steve always heard about this moment, and it’s not magical in a way that science and chemicals can explain the way it burns so fucking good. No, Steve knows it’s all in his head when it happens, just notions of fairy tales and romance films but it does nothing to stop the way his breath hitches slightly, audible between them.
Steve didn’t mind that Bucky was like that, though. It made helping him easier in a way because he didn’t get embarrassed when Steve had to do things for him, not like other people expected him too, at least. Bucky did get frustrated sometimes, but he didn’t deny when he needed help and when he was struggling with things, and that… that made a world of difference.
Steve didn’t ask Tony to leave either, on account for that look and the way Tony’s hands where clenched in fists under the table.
If Tony’s hand finds the omega’s ankle a few moments later… well, that’s probably a much bigger gesture than it appears.
later. A full nine and a half hours later and with Steve’s hand in his hair, gently petting him, twirling his figure through the soft strands.
When Steve feels those work-hardened fingertips on his skin though, he finds the hardness there is the softest of all the pain Tony carries.
If you read last chapter and saw that it said (November 2015) that is incorrect! I meant to take it out but I didn't notice. That was just me playing around with the timeline in anticipation for part 2 and doesn't much matter to this fic at all.
The mask is similar to the Winter Soldier, and Tony tells himself that it’s because it’s practical and not anything to do with trying to make positive associations for Barnes.
Tony laughs softly then, “Oh how the tables have turned,” he says, and looks at Steve this time with a smile that makes Steve’s breath catch. Tony sits up now, faces Steve who mirrors his movement and sits up far less relaxed than Tony who has his elbows on his knees, leaning forward, leaning in.
He wants to burn himself on the taste of Steve, thinks it might be possible if he tastes as sharp as he smells.
He was getting tired of keeping it to himself though. It’s not like Steve had cared. He had enough reason to hate Tony no matter what Tony had tried to do to fix things.
Bucky had… thought Steve was being tortured by the things coming out of his mouth through their bedroom door.
The most amazing thing was that an hour later, Bucky’s eyes were closed and he was dozing lightly on the couch. No guns, not even sitting up fully.
Shout out to the lovely person who I once did the above mentioned disgusting sex acts with. A true inspiration to us all and an absolute delight to... well yeah.
, 1991. He started digging right away just six months after the Battle of New York when Steve had come to him with another possible tip that Loki had left them. Then he’d read them all a second time when the rescue mission to the Siberian Hydra bunker didn’t go exactly to plan and Bucky was in the wind. So, Tony knew better than anyone what to expect in terms of Bucky’s trauma and PTSD. What they got was both so much worse, and significantly better then either he or Steve could have imagined.
That behaviour resembles the kind of jealousy that Steve feels guilty over wanting, so he crushes it down and pretends he believes the lies and excuses.
Tony wakes to the scent of coffee wafting from a steaming mug on the floor, and peppermint on the sheets.
Tony had instead snapped back at Steve, harsh enough to make him flinch. Told him to go to the gym, work off whatever was wrong and stay the hell away from the team if he was going to be so grumpy.
Watched Steve stick an ice-cube down the back of Barnes’s shirt and get tossed over the shoulder of the Winter Soldier and spun around until he couldn’t walk straight laughing the whole time.
an alpha, though. Tony knew Steve was an alpha, but sometimes Steve had done things like say... bring home a beta he found in a park in DC, and Tony would forget. Find himself
Tony, as it was, had been standing at the mouth of the alcove that was home to the couch, his bed, Steve’s nest. The old, lumpy hunk of scent. His and Steve’s. Mostly Tony’s now, as Steve’s shirt had lost most of the omega sweetness.
Steve had no desire to start a relationship with Bucky, both because he was head over heels for Tony, but also, because Bucky was so, so vulnerable right now and the thought of
Steve really doesn’t know why he’s so interested in the fact that Tony has seen his mark. He’s not upset about it exactly. He just doesn’t like that Howard would share something like that. Howard was a different man in those days though.
Steve had always been able to smell Tony—and it’s a warm scent, a good scent. He’s never picked up on the more subtle changes though, only the dramatic ones like anger, rut, fear, and pain.
“Shield’s been vetting all the people who have been claiming it’s them,” Steve says to Tony later that night on the balcony. It’s still far too cold to be enjoyable, hence why they find themselves alone, “Said they’d call if anything comes up,” he tells him.
It is impossible for Steve to miss that fact, because he knows that Tony is the only other living person besides Barnes who’s seen the photograph he was wearing it in.
This is entirely smut. The whole thing. Just sub Steve and dom Tony going at it okay? Bucky's not even in this chapter. He went out.
Steve was the same bright, beautiful, stubborn, righteous, thrilling man that Tony’s been in love with for a year.
Since they’ve become friends, and Steve would say pretty good friends at that, he’s rationalized why Tony might have done it, since his idea of a man who would ruin and distort something so sacred didn’t exactly match up with the kind of man Tony was once you got passed his media personality. When you found the friend, and hero beneath it all.
In another reality Steve had believed the worst of the damage had come from years working with his hands.
He really isn’t that tiny. Four or five inches shorter than Tony, and long limbed despite his height.
It’s not the first time Tony has woken up alone when there was someone in his bed the night before. He’s sure it won’t be the last.
“You look like you managed alright,” Clint pointed out. In fact, he had pointed it out the moment he saw Bucky.
That was not something Steve’s 1940’s sensibilities knew how to handle, not after seeing mutilated soulmarks of same-sex bondpairs in concentration camps throughout the war.
He had felt anger at himself for wanting to be a real omega even though being an alpha was a gift, the whole world said.
A part of him felt he shouldn’t trust so easily, not after Hydra… but the reality was, Hydra never broke his trust. That wasn’t an issue he had, though he had plenty of others. He could and still did, trust Hydra to be exactly the way they showed him that they were. He trusted Hydra and his handler’s to be cruel, sure, but it was still trust, both earned and conditioned.
When Fury broke the news, Steve gets a hint of that wise expression that goes with that know-it-all attitude.
“Aw, man,” Clint hissed, “I’m sorry, I thought you were just the tall, dark and brooding type,” he scrubbed a hand through his hair, “Shit,” he cursed.
He watches from a screen in the desolate compound as the Stark Industries logo is re-installed to the New York tower.
He took a breath, felt air reach deep in his lungs, air that was filled with concern and confusion and fear from Nat and Sam.
“Baby, you look like shit,” Tony mumbles, barely able to sit up, voice raspy and rough from six months of silence and feeding tubes and oxygens masks.
She has a brown paper bag with her. Steve opens his mouth to tell her he’s not hungry, and he’d really like a little more time with Tony alone, thanks, but there is something in the way she holds the bag. It’s crumpled, fraying and nearly torn. She holds it with a white-knuckled grip.
This last mission has ended, yet for the first time since the first Battle against Loki, the team don’t all immediately scatter again.
It isn’t new. He’s spent forty minutes scrubbing himself clean of Tony before. It is not the first time, but this time he has bruises that don’t wash away and he thinks that maybe this time it’s worse.
“Woah,” he shouted, covering his eyes, “that’s a lot more naked super-soldier than I’m used to seeing,” he said, “by a solid sixty-four percent,” he added, peaking at Steve who was shirtless.
“He’ll just come back,” Steve says, voice dull. Killian has been coming back for Tony for too damn long.
He remembers Tony asking Steve what might happen if he didn’t like his soulmate. He remembers laughing it off completely. Now, he’s not sure that Tony was wrong about that point.
Steve knew he was still stuck and old fashioned in some ways, but he liked to think he was up to date in this kind of thinking. He had always advocated openly for marriage outside of soulbonds, so he really didn’t think much about it.
Tony is in and out of consciousness for a few days, and every time he blinks open his eyes, he turns to his left, murmuring Steve’s name. And every time Steve’s breath catches and stutters along with his heart like he’s nineteen years old and the windows were drafty.
And lets words fall from his lips when he’s alone in his room, in his bed. Words that should be damning, but instead feel the opposite.
He liked Steve and Tony, but he didn’t feel the same way towards the rest of Steve’s team. They were far too weary of him at first… and then came the pity.
The irritability and getting overwhelmed by scent had normally been fine too. It was never a problem until the Avengers had started living together.
Bucky just shrugged, “I’m more focused on learning how to digest solid food,” he said, “I can figure out sex later,” he said.
A moment passes before Tony speaks again, “It was supposed to be… Ruined,” he mumbles no longer smiling, “When I saw it, I wanted it
It’s not the first time Steve’s wasted all the hot water in the shower trying to drown his mistakes. He’s sure it won’t be the last.
“With not gettin’ it up?” he asked and at Steve’s nod, agreed, “Yeah, ain’t like I got anywhere to stick it,” he said, crudely.
“I knew as soon as I saw it,” Tony admits on a resigned sigh, “Soulmates are funny like that, Steve,” he says and looks at Steve with a little grin.
“It can’t be fate to die before you were even born,” Steve rejects, but there isn’t vehemence in his voice the way he wants there to be.
Bucky had been steadily improving in a lot of areas. Personal hygiene and vocabulary being the two largest. He had been going to therapy for a few months now, but sleep… that wasn’t something he had mastered yet.
Steve has the distinct memory of having the thought: what’s the point of this alpha body if he doesn’t use it?
“I dunno,” Bucky replied, “I don’t even think I can get it up an’more,” he said, more interested in his popsicle then in the revelation, “If I could, I might have more sympathy, he’s nice on the eyes,” he added with a smirk, “He’s good for you”.
Tony groans, “No, you’re not aloud to make jokes while my dick is in you, Steve,” Tony says tightly with the effort of staying still, “Hurts my ego”.
“Bucky, don’t be crass,” he reprimanded, and Bucky apologized with a grin and a bowed head. Steve rolled his eyes, “you were never a fan of sticking it anywhere, regardless,” Steve said with an eyeroll.
Had given Steve his heart, gave Steve his body on a nightly bases, would probably give Bucky Steve if the man ever asked, but… that’s not what Bucky was asking for now. That’s not what Bucky was requesting that Tony should be able to say ‘no’ to, and so of course, Tony said yes.
Tony must fall asleep because he wakes to voices and the distinct understanding that he should not be where he is right now.
Tony couldn’t bring himself to do it. Not because he was optimistic, no. He was just far too in love with Steve to say the words.
“To me,” Tony nods, ignoring the real question, “But you think it means something,” he says decisively like he’s chosen to agree to disagree about it and move on.
Tags are getting adding as I go, so be aware of that please! Always good to check in case something gets added later you weren't expecting.
Not when the same pale yellow haze that had knocked out Steve in the first place returned to encase Steve’s unconscious form, hiding him from view for way too long.
Then again, Tony’s tattoo caused qualm with a lot of people born in this century too, despite how famous he is. How famous he is
Bucky had a pinched expression, the kind he wore when he wanted to talk but couldn’t get the words out.
“That’s different, Tony,” Steve scoffs, “It’s a tattoo”. Though it was arguably more revealing about Tony’s soulmate than the mark would have been.
Steve smells so good right now, Tony thinks when he lets his own eyes slip shut. Pre-heat, cuddly, sleepy and soft. It’s the version of Steve that started it all.
“So, who’s your girl?” Clint had asked, motioning to the pile of guns Bucky was in the process of cleaning.
It doesn’t matter if Tony doesn’t remember him as long as he opens his eyes and looks at Steve one last time.
Steve can’t make out what it was, that soulmark. He knows where it is though, and he knows Tony knows that too. It is in an identical placement to Steve’s own, follows a similar gentle slope on his pectoral.
Wasn’t that what brought that normality to a screeching halt in the first place? When Tony forgot about Steve being an alpha and fell head over heals in love?
Instead, sometimes Steve said Bucky fell asleep on the couch in the afternoons, sucking on his fingers and looking
Tony snorts, “You’re telling me?” he laughs and that’s it. They don’t talk anymore about it, yet Steve can’t stop thinking about it.
“C’mere,” Steve said, holding out a hand. Bucky took it in his metal hand, still with his flesh hand at his mouth.
He looks warm, alive, solid, and real in a way that Tony’s imagination could never fully have grasped.
He falls perfectly in line with the team when he’s not wrapped around Steve like an over-grown koala. Barnes and Sam bicker like brothers, and Barnes is protective of Nat like a little sister, correcting her fighting stance in the gym the day after he arrives and somehow he didn’t lose his life.
Most people think Tony is incapable of companiable silence, but Steve finds there’s few people he would enjoy silence with than with Tony.
He thought maybe Tony had gotten the tattoo in order to protect his soulmate since the Starks were so famous and already Tony would have had been held ransom twice before he turned fifteen and got his mark. He also wondered if Tony might have had to deal with people claiming to be his soulmate just to get something from him, the way some other beautiful celebrities do these days.
Steve would never forgive him if it happened, Tony knows. Steve is too devoted to fighting to ever let something like that get in the way.
“Yeah, Steve’s here, princess,” Tony assured, “You want me to wake him up?” He asked, honestly surprised the blonde hadn’t woken already at the sound of Bucky’s voice. Steve was used to Tony talking to Jarvis at night, but he had something of a sixth sense when it came to Bucky in distress.
At first, he’d thought it was Steve, and instinctively reached over to run a soothing hand down his boyfriends back, which was often enough to chase away the beginnings of a nightmare.
Bucky looked quizzically at Clint, “Yes?” he replied. It was obviously over between Steve and Bucky, and he more than approved of Tony. “Tony and Steve are great together,” Bucky added.
but when Tony was deepthroating his own popsicle, dressed in a sharp three-piece suit and then kissing the life out of Steve, is was decidedly
He feels bad. That she had to do that. Had to have this conversation about her friend at the mans bedside instead of the relative safety of her office, where they could have both sat and Steve would pretend he wasn’t about to hear the worst news of his life while she handed him a cup of tea.
And Steve… Steve took everything he could, basked in it in a way he knew he couldn’t bask in the morning afterglow.
He watches sunlight reflect off Steve’s hair as the sun sets over the city one evening while the team are all out on the roof and wonders if he looks better like this, or in the twinkling city lights. He’s not sure he could ever decide.
“Hey man, you look dead on your feet,” he’d said one day, noticing the bags under Bucky’s eyes. Bucky replied with a grunt.
SHIELD or no SHIELD, the Avengers are still earth’s mightiest heroes, and as they had come to find, that title included fighting off the otherworldly ex-girlfriends of their team members.
Steve smiles a sad, broken smile that Tony’s never seen before and gets up, but he doesn’t leave. He goes over to the pile of junk in the corner and finds the ball that always ends up there and tosses it for U.
Steve went back to his attack on Bucky’s hair, this time combing something through it that had the tangles falling apart in his hands.
But it had been obvious to anyone familiar with true pack dynamics what Bucky had been to Steve. What Sam and Nat were becoming to Steve even though he was an Alpha and he shouldn’t have been able to form these kinds of connections on his own.
What made an omega? Friendliness and duel reproduction? The ability to conceive, impregnate, make fast friends? Build a pack?
Bucky let his jaw fall open, too used to following orders to disobey when he was already feeling horrible. Tony pressed the icicle to his tongue.
, he doesn’t expect it. Expectation is a terrible thing, but then again, so is hope. Maybe he should be trying harder to squash that down too.
‘I can’t help it, I overthink everything,’ he gasped as Steve finally lowered his hips into the cradle of Tony’s. He could feel the outline of Steve in his sweatpants, he could feel he was just as hard and just as wanting as he was.
‘Fuck me, you’re huge,’ Tony told him, giving a squeeze, waking up a little at the feeling of power, the control he had over Steve. His soulmate dropped his forehead into the crook of Tony’s neck and shoulder, his muscles beginning to shudder. ‘I can’t wait to ride you, feel this inside me, spreading me open,’ Tony whispered, speeding up his hand, rubbing his thumb over Steve’s slit, teasing him.
Instead, he shuffled over to the next painting, trying not to smile as Steve followed him. This piece exuded loneliness, heartache. He couldn’t explain why, no part of him understood the tortured soul in the art piece, the feelings a painter spilled onto his canvas. But Tony could with this. The figure was rendered with agonizing detail, the broad muscles of his back, brown hair curling at his nape, and every mole, every imperfection rendered in beautiful detail. You couldn’t see the subject’s face, but that didn’t matter.
A tentative hand skimmed across his skin where his t-shirt and sweatpants met, and Tony moaned at the electric feel of it, grinding up into Steve’s cock to let him know how
‘If you love someone, you let them go,’ Steve told him, sliding down the wall so he could sit at the foot of it, elbows on his knees as he stared at the space between them. He looked so sad, so dejected that something stirred in Tony’s withered husk of a heart, the need to make his feel better.
‘Fucking hell, Tony,’ Steve groaned, sucking the tip of Tony’s cock into his mouth, flicking his tongue over the slit, lapping up the precome as his thumb continued to tease.
‘You’re right. I’ve given you every opportunity to walk away, and I’ll always respect your choice to walk away if that’s what you want, but you came back,’ Steve said in wonderment.
‘In times of war, governments can do desperate things to ensure their victory,’ Steve told him in a monotone voice. ‘Soldiers, we…we’re taught to follow orders without question. We believe in the cause, the greater good. When I fought for my country, I believed I was doing the right thing, fighting for our independence.’
‘I saw you once, as a kid you came to a gallery where they were displaying my…’ Steve trailed off, gaze going upstairs.
‘Which you’ve taken it upon yourself to decorate with polka dots I see. Honestly Tones, why do you do this to me?’
‘Sorry, I was thinking about something else,’ Tony said smoothly, turning to look at the person who had spoken to him.
‘You’re wondering why I’m taking this slow.’ Steve propped his elbow on the couch so he could rest his head in his hand, turning to look at Tony, his free hand cupping the side of his face.
‘Yeah, I guess you are,’ Steve said, his voice hollow. ‘Anyway, that’s me. I used to be a soldier and I guess… I wanted to do something else for a while, I wanted to create things rather than…’ Steve trailed off.
‘Now that I’ve brought your piece, are you free for the evening?’ Tony turned back to Steve, hoping he was portraying the right amount of interest. There was a fine line between appearing eager and desperate, and Tony felt like he was closer to the latter, wanting to feel this man’s arms around him, only a little bit apprehensive about how intense his feelings were.
‘Fabulous,’ Tony muttered under his breath, readjusting his tie, carefully picking his way around the broken glass littering the sidewalk to the doorway. The smell assaulted Tony’s nose first, and he immediately backed out of the hall with a wrinkled nose, before he felt awful and forced himself back inside. This was part of the reason he was working so hard on the arc reactor project, renewable, sustainable energy for all.
He felt wrong footed, suddenly unsure of the situation. Downplaying the anxiety, Tony filled up two glasses, offering one to Steve, shivering when the man deliberately let the pads of his fingers stroke across his knuckles.
‘I can’t imagine that. Your soulmate walking away from you. I’m sorry, on behalf of all my other selves.’ He was sorry, he might not remember it, may or may not be the same person born again, Tony really wasn’t sure how it worked, but it hurt, it hurt thinking about Steve being heartbroken.
Tony wasn’t afraid of heights, but he found the way you could still see downstairs from the bedroom mezzanine level disconcerting, so he tore his gaze away, looking at the huge king size bed, the freshly laundered crisp black sheets.
Tony needed information, he needed data. Emotions were tangled, snarled things and he didn’t even know where to begin in sorting out how he felt about all of this.
Steve gave him a look then, a gaze so heartachingly tender that it made Tony’s palms sweat from the pounding of his heart.
‘Yeah,’ Tony forced out, focusing on the heat of Steve’s palm covering the mass of gnarled flesh, the way he felt safe rather than threatened. ‘He died trying to use the tech he stole.’ Tony whimpered as Steve stroked the tips of his fingertips over the groove in his sternum, the tenderness, his own vulnerability mingling with his desire from a few seconds ago, a potent mix that made him feel almost drunk as he gazed up at blue eyes.
He once again wondered why they hadn’t dated. She was beautiful, intelligent, would probably be better at running Stark Industries, and she knew him, understood all his quirks and the like. There lay the problem. She knew him too well, if that were such a thing, she and Rhodey both. They were family, the few people he could say he loved unconditionally. He wasn’t going to jeopardize that with either of them.
‘Steve Rogers,’ the magnificent man answered, taking his hand to shake, his grip firm, careful with his strength.
‘No past self of you has ever understood my pain, or apologized for it. That’s a unique Tony Stark thing.’
‘Wait, wait Tony!’ Steve called, jogging after him. ‘I’m sorry, I was being a jerk, not understanding-’
Steve moved around Tony cautiously, careful not to touch as he tugged the sheet off, bundling it in his arms and holding it close to his chest. He didn’t obstruct Tony’s path, didn’t try to explain in anyway, he hunched back against the brick of his bedroom wall, trying to appear as small and unthreatening as possible.
He floated between the two states of being, wakefulness and slumber, his limbs heavy and sated, his mind syrupy. Squeezing his eyes shut against the sweat stinging them, he tried to pry his eyelids open, the blurry images of Steve hovering over him coming into focus. His hand was gliding up and down his own cock as he looked down at Tony, and in the depths of the fog in his mind, Tony had the stray thought that he should be reciprocating. He liked giving head after all, could think of nothing else but having Steve on his tongue, but all he could do was watch lazily while Steve worked his cock, his cheeks tarnished with lust, eyelids heavy as he gazed down at Tony stretched before him.
and it doesn’t work, then you still have Rhodey and me, JARVIS, the company. We are your constants, Tony that isn’t going to change.’
‘Tony, what your parents had…that wasn’t right. Soulmates…it’s meant to be a wonderful, beautiful bond-’
Steve wouldn’t let him rush the kiss, held him still with one of his massive hands, but Tony didn’t feel threatened, or put off by it, meeting the slick, warm tongue with an enthusiastic moan, shifting onto Steve’s lap and twisting his fingers into blond hair, aching to get closer. When they broke away for air, Steve held him close with both hands, dropping his forehead down to Tony’s as they both panted for breath, their created air mingling together.
Sensual lips parted in a smile, revealing perfectly white teeth. He was amused by Tony’s chattering, the skin at the corner of those gorgeous blue eyes crinkling as he looked down.
Jarvis called him, his gaze down at the watch on his wrist, unease evident in his posture. They were late for something, and this made him anxious. Tony didn’t move at first, his shoulders lifting to his ears, hiding from the inevitable. Whoever it was summoning them, neither of them wanted to go.
‘No! It’s not fine, I’m judging you based on….’ Steve broke off, frustrated with himself. ‘I’m sorry, I misunderstood, and I stuck my foot in it. Please, Tony, come with me, let me explain.’ He reached his hand out to Tony, who looked down at it, distrustful.
‘Nothing much to report I’m afraid. I was born in New York, lived here for most of my life and I’ve been a soldier for a lot of it too.’
‘No, it’s because you’re scared of commitment, of getting hurt again,’ Pepper corrected, bringing her arms around his waist and holding him.
‘One hour Tony, go and be polite for one hour and then meet me back here. I’ll made a bid for something on your behalf,’ Pepper shooed him away with her hand.
Tony flicked up his sunglasses so he could look at the art gallery sign, the word Eterno curling around in crimson letters against a black background. Taking a deep breath, he tried to steady his nerves, berating himself for being a coward. He hadn’t done this before. He had asked men and women out for drinks, sometimes dinner in the hopes that it would result in sex, but he’d never asked someone out on a date with the pretense of getting to know them better.
‘I don’t know much about you I’d rather hear about you from you, rather than listening to what the rest of the world says,’ Steve said, reaching down to place his glass on the floor, turning so his feet now rested on the couch, his body facing Tony’s.
‘Well, Rogers, nice to know you won’t stop me from running out of your life, kind of breaking the whole image I have of you being a romantic.’
‘The…stories about what…mythical beings who live forever, suffering because their soulmates reincarnate or something? Tones, those are just stories, fairytales we tell kids.’
He looked over his shoulder, helpless to the craving want smoldering in his chest, needing to see Tony one last time and know he was happy before he walked away. Tony turned at the exact same moment, and Steve saw the flash of gorgeous brown eyes, a replica of the eyes the first reincarnation of his love had, the same honey-soaked teak which sparkled with curiosity, and Steve knew that later they would burn with determination and creativity, knew deep in the marrow of his bones that this was the person Tony would turn out to be.
‘I haven’t been called that in a while,’ Tony said with a bitter laugh, reaching out for his wine glass.
Whatever Steve had been expecting to see behind his door at one in the morning, it wasn’t Tony, shivering from the cold and wet. He’d been wandering outside the front of Steve’s building for over an hour in the rain, ignoring alarms from JARVIS about how this would affect his health, how he was going to call Happy and then Rhodey. It was his threat to call Pepper that finally gave him the courage to go up and knock on Steve’s door.
‘Good, saves me from ripping him apart,’ Steve spat. ‘I almost lost you before I found you. I’m not losing you again,’ he swore, the breath of his promise rippling across Tony’s skin, saturating it with his pledge.
, Tony.’ The words ripped out of Steve, like he couldn’t hold them back anymore. ‘I don’t want to lie, my soul, my heart feels at ease when I’m near you, just like yours is when you’re with me, that’s the nature of our bond, but I want to know you.’
‘But Pepper why!’ Tony whined as she dug her nails into the tender skin at the crook of his elbow, warning him as another couple drifted past. They both plastered identical smiles on their faces, and he murmured a pleasant ‘good evening’ like Pepper had made him practice over and over to stamp his sarcasm out.
‘But…’ Tony let the album fall to the bed, rooting through the box, movie stubs from before he was born, metal dog tags from when Steve was a soldier, a belt buckle with wonky letters spelling out Steve, another set of military tags with the words,
His mind was assaulted by the memories of his mother trying to stifle her tears while Tony watched on through the crack in the bedroom door, Stane standing above him with a grin as he plunged the knife into his chest, leaving him for dead.
He may not look it, dressed in an expensive suit, living high in a tower, but he did care about the plight of his fellow man. His charity events weren’t just for show and recognition, his mother had set up a charity foundation to try and find some comfort in her life, and Tony had cared for it after her death. Shaking the thoughts away, he searched for Steve, thinking about how he was almost too good to be true, the perfect boyfriend to bring home to meet the parents. Courteous and polite, served in the military, was a successful artist, volunteered at the shelter. Definitely boyfriend material.
‘And I feel for the dude I do, but Tones, that isn’t up to you to fix. You have one life. Live it the way you want to.’
Steve waited until the fretful tossing and turning stopped, Tony’s breathing becoming slow and measured once again. Shifting in the bed, Steve looked down at his sleeping soulmate who even unconscious was frowning, mouth moving as if he was still thinking, trying to form sentences. None of the others had done that, and Steve found it adorable.
What was he doing here? He’d gone willingly into a stranger’s loft, without anyone. Even JARVIS wouldn’t be able to alert someone fast enough to stop him getting murdered.
‘But he’s been waiting for years, has watched his soulmate walk away from him over and over.’ For some reason, that was what Tony kept picturing, the fragile hope Steve must have carried in his chest, year after year only for it to wither and crumble into dust.
‘Alright, Tony, I’ll take care of the details regarding the purchase of this piece. Let me just go tell Happy you’re ready to-’
When a lull in the conversation happened, Tony made his excuses with a charming smile and headed back to the bar, discreetly trying to check his watch as he went. Flagging down the bartender he ordered a scotch, turning so his back rested against the counter, making himself seem approachable and not hiding hunched over at the bar like he really didn’t want to be there.
‘I don’t know anything about art!’ Tony pleaded, looking around in abashed horror at everything around him.
Steve prying in his personal, intimate life made him uncomfortable, and he felt the need to drag the night back to something he was used to.
‘JARVIS, find out everything you can about Steve Rogers. I want to know where he works, his service record, everything about him.’
‘Not always. They might meet up, but that doesn’t mean soulmates always stay together, or that they want to be with that person.’
Tony wasn’t sure what he was doing here, what he wanted out of this meeting, but he hadn’t been able to settle since meeting Rhodey, his and Pepper’s words chasing his steps as he walked the streets of New York. The outcomes and possibilities of speaking to Steve filling his head, the what ifs plastering the inside of his brain, making it was impossible to think of anything else.
Turning to look over his shoulder, Tony saw Steve leaning against the doorframe, his broad shoulders nearly filling the whole space.
Steve’s weight didn’t make him uncomfortable, instead he felt grounded, secure, safe. He could feel himself drifting off to sleep, warm and content, not even stirring when he felt Steve wipe his stomach clean, when he felt the blanket covering him, Steve rearranging them so Tony was laying on his chest, an arm tucking him close.
‘Tony,’ Steve coaxed. ‘I know you don’t know me, but I promise you I’m not going to hurt you, I swear I would never let anything happen to you. Is JARVIS on your phone?’
‘When was the meeting with the UN again, was it this Wednesday? We need to get moving if we’re going to have anything to-’
‘If you love someone you let them go…but if they come back, they’re yours,’ Steve finished the quote, turning his hand so he could pick up Tony’s, lifting it to his mouth and kissing the knuckles.
Taking it, he allowed Steve to walk him through the apartment and over to the staircase, twisted wrought iron bars forming rails. He followed Steve up the stairs, turning his head away from the perfect view of his ass to look over the floor of the apartment one more time before Steve stopped, gesturing around.
Steve met him in the kiss, hands cradling the back of his head, deepening it. None of the slow tentative stuff from before, Steve’s tongue slipped into his mouth with ease as he tipped Tony back towards the couch, boxing him in with his elbows and knees. Tony wriggled beneath him, wanting to feel Steve’s weight on top of him, wanting to be smothered by him.
Fear grew in Tony’s stomach, crushing his organs and making it hard to breathe, his gaze fixed on the words
‘You don’t know that I’m going to call you. You’re really going to walk out that door? Miss out on spending a night with Tony Stark?’
‘Steve…please…’ Tony begged not sure what he was asking for, crying when Steve stopped and moved away.
‘No, I was nearly done anyway.’ He waited as Tony shrugged him off, nabbing one of the volunteers. He pulled his business card from his pocket, scribbling Pepper’s number on the back and handing it to him. ‘What was that for?’ Steve asked.
‘Pick something you like, it’s going to end up on your walls after all! No! Pick something for Rhodey! he said his office needed sprucing up!’
‘What’s going on?’ Rhodey asked, sitting on the edge of his desk beside Tony, his gaze trailing over his body, lingering on the scar hidden behind his shirt. Rhodey encircled Tony’s wrist with his hand, worried eyes peering down at him.
‘You’re cute when you ramble.’ Steve looked down at him, interrupting his apology. ‘Yes, it’s a fairy tale. Longing for something, the tortured immortal soul forced to never find their true love.’
‘Alright, let’s try logic then,’ she huffed. ‘You don’t have enough data, you don’t even know if this Steve is your soulmate, you’re acting on a hunch-’
‘Tony,’ Steve choked out, leaning forward so they could kiss, filthy and uncoordinated, Steve gasping into his mouth the closer he got to orgasm.
JARVIS had given him the name for the gallery in New York that Steve owned, the art pieces he had sold over the years, but it was when JARVIS dug further that the discrepancies began. There was no record of a Steve Rogers serving in the military, that wasn’t what made Tony uneasy, he knew all about the secret branches and the soldiers working underneath them. He could hack The Pentagon to find out that information, but Tony didn’t want Rhodey kicking his ass.
‘My unit was offered what you would now call an experimental drug, I suppose. A way to make us stronger, faster, resilient to injuries so we could win the war.’
‘See that there, your stubbornness, that’s all Tony Stark,’ Steve told him with a chuckle, leaning back on his couch.
Steve shut him up with a kiss, cupping the side of Tony’s jaw with his calloused hand, infinitely tender despite his strength.
Tony was gone, hurtling towards his orgasm, barely able to warn Steve about what was happening before he was coming down his throat.
‘Unfortunately, money makes the world go around. Me giving money to these guys means it could help more homeless people, expand to other shelters, get more food. That’s going to be more use than me helping and creating a PA nightmare for them all,’ Tony snapped, storming out.
‘Yeah, I mean, I’m not sure if you wanted to see me again, but I thought if I showed up I might be able to persuade you out on a date with my good looks alone, get to know you better. I mean that’s what you wanted right?’ He was hiding under his usual bullshit bluster, and he knew Steve knew it too, which made him even more uncomfortable.
‘If you love someone you let them go,’ Steve quoted, resting his hand on top of Tony’s, printing his fingertips in charcoal smudges on Tony’s skin.
Six lifetimes Steve had loved his soul mate, the other half of his soul, and it was only now at Tony’s seventh reincarnation that he had met him as a child.
‘There’s something upstairs I want to show you,’ Steve said when Tony picked up a photo frame with a picture of Steve and another man with startling blue eyes and messy brown hair. Placing the photo down, Tony looked over his shoulder, taking in Steve’s relaxed posture, the offered hand.
‘I…I don’t know,’ Tony said honestly, aware they were drawing attention. Ramming his hands in his pockets, he dropped his gaze, feeling the stares of everyone around them. ‘Look, I’ll be straight with you. I don’t do this, have never done anything like this. I fully expected the other night to be a onetime type of thing, but…’
‘Steve…what are these photos?’ Tony asked, tapping one with his middle finger, the one which was black and white, grainy, Steve just about visible.
‘Hey, hey, come back to me, honey,’ Steve whispered, stretching down to kiss his cheekbone. ‘I see you, Tony Stark, someone who is nervous, but willing to try, even after he’s been hurt. Someone I can see myself falling in love with.’
‘I can’t stop thinking about you. I trust my gut with things, it’s how I’ve survived in business, avoided some undesirable people-’
Steve’s movements were peculiar, almost awkward, like he hadn’t done this in a while, and Tony couldn’t believe that. A gorgeous man like this couldn’t be wanting for a sexual partner. In a way, the inexperience fanned the flames of Tony’s lust higher, the idea that he had this man all to himself, that perhaps he’d been waiting for Tony, and suddenly he needed to get closer.
‘Get yourself dry, okay? Here, take these and get changed, bathroom is through there,’ Steve pointed down the corridor leading off the cloakroom, towards a door that Tony hadn’t noticed before. Stubbornly, Tony refused, waiting for Steve to leave before he stripped down to his boxers, leaving his clothes in a sodden heap beside the front door, taking twisted satisfaction in the way they puddled water all over the floor.
Rocking back and forth on his heels for a moment, he ran his tongue over his teeth before pushing his way into the building and turning on the charm at the first person he saw.
‘Hey, it’s okay, you’re alright,’ Steve reassured him before taking away his hand, giving Tony his space.
Shaken from his internal thoughts, Tony looked up at the painting he was stood beside, black tendrils reaching out from what looked like a screen, or a phone, dragging the human in the foreground backwards into its depths, other tortured souls caught in its netting.
he mouthed when he straightened up, like he couldn’t believe what he was seeing, joy sparking in his blue eyes. Emotion clogged the back of Tony’s throat, and he put his sunglasses in his suit pocket awkwardly, unsure how to handle being the focus of such attention.
This was a clever mind game. Nothing more, Steve had gotten him all worked up with the promise of being laid. and now he was making Tony work for it, some sort of power trip that he got off from.
‘Yeah, you’re literally my polar opposite, I can’t survive without my phone,’ Tony laughed, stretching himself out, his limbs loose from the effects of the wine they’d nearly finished. It was late now, or very early depending on which way you looked at it, and while Tony was used to being awake at haphazard hours, Steve probably needed to go home and sleep.
