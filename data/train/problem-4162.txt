Castiel’s shoulders slump. Holy shit, he thinks to himself.
, Cas’,” Dean huffs.
“Those jerks are beating on that kid,” Dean says quickly. “We should do something about it.”
When Dean turns to walk home, there’s a wide smile on his face and a light spring in his step.
“What the hell?” he whispers to himself. This
They look at one another, smiling endlessly like they don’t have anywhere else to be. Like they shouldn’t be running from this place as fast as they can. Castiel doesn’t care. He stands there, looking at Dean, his thoughts swimming with everything he could have. Everything he wants. And all he would have to do is cross the distance between them and -
“Micahel doesn’t let me on this side of town,” Castiel says lowly. “We should go back.”
They visit the home of Olivia Lowry - or, at least, what used to be her home. They find her on the kitchen floor, her throat slashed and ripped apart. Her intestines hang out of her stomach and her small mouth hangs open in a silent scream. For a moment, her face shifts, and Castiel swears he can see the blooming colors of hell stretch across her features. Blue, purple, yellow, red —
“I’m sorry,” Dean says after a moment of silence. “For making you do that. Especially since we were wrong. About Naomi. She wasn’t the one killing the angels.”
“I’m going to kill you,” he says quietly. “And you won’t touch the girl.”
That's what I want now
He waits. He sits and he waits, staring out the window, watching as the car carrying the Novaks’ father drives away. Moments later, Dean hears sirens blare down the normally-quiet street, growing in volume. Moments later, an ambulance pulls up to the Novak house and two EMTs quickly pull out a stretcher from the back. Dean doesn’t even breathe or wait for Sam to speak; he explodes out of his chair and races out the door. He charges across the lawn as they disappear inside the house and quickly re-emerge outside with a small body on a stretcher. Dean’s stomach sinks. He stares, rooted in place until Castiel is hurrying outside with his coat loosely trailing behind him
“You boys are good kids,” Jodi murmurs. “It looks like everyone made a tough decision today.”
Sometimes, Castiel will sit outside by the makeshift graves. Even in late February, Castiel can already see the effects of Dean’s grace buried in the soil. The grass is greener, thicker, and lusher. When Castiel pushes his hands through the soil, it’s rich and full of nutrients. Dean joins him outside as Castiel lets the dirt slide between his fingers, admiring the way the thick, brown color looks against his skin.
“It wasn’t
He has to find Dean.
“Castiel, I knew your brother would be there,” Dean says slowly. “And I knew that he was planning on breaking the Seal. We gave you the choice to leave so that we could deal with the threat ourselves. But you failed to neutralize the threat. And now another Seal is broken, and we’re a whole ‘nother step towards the Devil spreading his apocalyptic
Castiel frowns. “I see. Did she say anything about these demons the night she escaped?”
Dean watches in disbelief as Castiel silently takes his brother’s hand and begins walking towards the door. Their father glares at them both, arms folded, leaving Dean in the middle of the yard.
Jo brings him back to his car, ordering him to sit in the back seat as she prepares him to die. Dying doesn’t frighten Castiel. Perhaps not as much as it should. But hell does. Hurting other souls in hell, feeling the scorch of his essence turning into an endless plume of black smoke - that frightens him. He stands in front of her as she places her hand on the side of his head, closing her eyes in deep focus.
Dean idly plays with the paper on the table; the words to the ritual. For a moment, he says nothing. Then, he takes a deep, steady breath. Tense, building silence.
On autopilot, Dean dives forward, grabbing Gabriel harshly by his waist and pulling him back against Dean’s body. Dean hits the pavement hard, just out of the way of the car that comes to a screeching halt. He barely feels the searing pain of the pavement digging into his arm or the bloody rivets scratching up his skin. Gabriel whimpers, but the boy doesn’t cry. Carefully, Dean lets him go just as Castiel reaches them. His face flushed, Castiel inspects his brother for any cuts or bruises as the car pulls up to the house. Dean stumbles to his feet, grateful when Gabriel seems to be fine - just shaken. Castiel tries to chastise him for playing in the road, but he’s too shaken to be angry - he pulls his brother into a weak hug instead as Dean tries to brush himself off.
“We like to call him Bobby,” Dean says with a grin. “Bobby” gives him a dirty look which quickly silences Dean. Castiel wipes a hand down his face, unable to stop staring at the two of them. Logically, he knows that Dean could not possibly have been the only angel in existence. But there’s still something unsettling about the fact that two of them are standing in his hotel room - like the existence of angels were something so ordinary, it need not be announced.
“Hey, man.”
“Whattya think about getting out of here, Sam?” Dean asks him suddenly. At night, Dean and Sam lay in their respective beds right after shutting off the light. He hears Sam rustle beneath the covers before turning to face his brother from across the room.
Castiel nods, disturbingly calm. He even
“Oh, um, hey dad.”
“Like I told you before,” she says, “People get stuck here. They get stuck...and they just don’t know what the hell to do with themselves. Castiel is a good kid. Someone like you being his friend is the best thing that’s ever happened to him. If he stuck up for you today, he’ll keep doing it. I don’t think he’d ever let anyone hurt you, or ever let anyone who would hurt you go unpunished.”
Jo shakes her head. “You think there’s nothing left?” she whispers. “You don’t know what
“With Robert and most of the Samuel loyalists gone, there aren’t many extremists left to chase. But it’s working. I...I’m doing good, Dean.”
- thank you, both of you, for letting me bounce ideas off of you in the server. It has meant a lot to me and I appreciate you both tolerating my screaming so often (not to mention, uncertified helped me make
Sam shakes his head. “Dean, I told you, I can take care of myself.”
“I’m guessing you do not
“It’s cool,” Dean assures him, a little shaken. He glances behind his shoulder. He’s grateful to be away from that guy, though he’s not sure what he’s supposed to be doing now. He’d feel bad just leaving Castiel out here and going home.
“But it’s so quiet,” Castiel points out. “There’s nothing here.”
you have in mind.”
Flanking the man, Balthazar raises his crowbar in a quick flash of movement. Without turning around, the man catches it just as the metal is about to connect with his head. He rips it easily from Balthazar’s hand and whirls around to face him. The man raises two fingers and places them onto Balthazar’s forehead. In seconds, Balthazar’s eyes roll back into his head as the man -- the creature --  gently lowers him to the ground.
show up at school later that day. Exhausted, with a distant, dazed look in his eye, Dean spots Castiel stumbling into the school through the crowded halls just before the sixth-period bell rings. He feels lighter at the sight of him, though the absence in Castiel’s eyes haunts Dean as nothing else can. At the end of the day, when Dean has a headache from listening to the teachers talk in school, he hurries down the hallway to meet up with his friend by the doors. As the students clear out, a familiar sight catches Dean’s eye; the notorious bullies, Dick, Az, and Arry, shoving a kid Dean shares science with up against the lockers. Some kid named Benny with a quiet, kind, strange sense of humor that has always made Dean chuckle under his breath.
. May I take your hands?”
“Well. You did your job.”
“Yes, don’t burn dinner. But I’ll help.”
CONGRESS TO FINALIZE BAN ON ALL PUBLIC GATHERINGS GREATER THAN FIVE
Castiel can’t remember the last time he’s driven into the city this late. With Dean leaned back against the seat, Castiel keeps glancing over towards the passenger side, caught between wanting to ask him questions that are surely nothing short of blasphemous. But there is nothing about Dean that Castiel would have ever imagined when he pictures angels - messengers of God, carriers of the Lord’s word…
“He’s gone.”
Castiel - the older Castiel - blinks in surprise. “Jo?” he whispers. “She’s here? Where?!”
“I couldn’t kill my brother Samuel,” Dean says quietly. “And the consequences of me dying would be...astronomical. To let him kill me like that is selfish. Heaven would fall into disarray.”
“Robert,” Dean warns. “
Dean shakes his head. “No. Anyone can learn to read music and practice and be good at an instrument. You have a gift. You...you can match what you hear to what’s on that piano like it’s
Benny gives Dean a small smile. “I have to get home. You should let her take a look at you, Dean.”
Dean can feel the tension leave his body when Sam rolls his eyes and does as he's told - something he seldom does. Dean just wants this conversation to end already. He quickly changes the topic and begins asking his father about the garage, and soon, Castiel is forgotten as quickly as he had been brought up.
Castiel simply shakes his head. “You have nothing to be sorry for. Thank you, Dean. For everything. I will...remember you fondly.”
. They lie and they twist and they take what isn’t meant to be theirs. He turns away from her, stumbling out of the trap to brace his hands down on the rickety table. The oxygen in the room feels thinner, lighter, and Castiel can’t seem to take it all in.
“Well. Then at least we have a place to start, don’t we?”
Jo looks around. “Good question,” she murmurs. “But that’s something for me to know, and for you to find out. I didn’t hurt anybody if that’s what you’re thinking.”
Sam doesn’t know what to say. Not at first. He’s quiet as Dean tries to read his expression, knowing that this would take Sam time to process it all.
As he works on securing the rocks half-in the ground, he hears the patter of rain above him, but no longer feels it pelting against his skin. Glancing behind him, he sees Dean holding an umbrella above Castiel’s head to shield him from the rain, getting Dean wet in the process.
“I enjoyed talking with you so much, I lost track of where we were going,” Castiel says seriously.
As it turns out, just because his future self believes him, doesn’t mean he trusts him. He keeps him handcuffed to the bed as he gathers his things and hurries out the door, much to Castiel’s dismay.
Before Castiel and Balthazar can say another word, Dean disappears with the faint sound of wings flapping in the quiet room. Balthazar blinks at Castiel, speechless as he throws down the iron rod he’d been holding.
“Well, you’ll have to give it back to him tomorrow,” his dad points out. "Not now, though. We need to get the rest of this inside, Let’s go - I don’t want you two catching more of a chill than you already have. We’ve still got four more boxes to unload.”
“Should I even ask how this happened?”
Castiel nods as a frantic look falls over his eyes. He stares at the piano, biting his lip as his fingers settle over the weathered keys.
you do to me if I dare to bruise your pride?”
“I will,” he mutters. And with that, Balthazar leaves to begin warding the house. Castiel watches him go quietly, trying to keep back the pang of worry in his gut.
His future self scoffs, sitting back down on the chair with an amused stare. He dips a hand into his pocket and takes out a bottle of pills, pouring three into his hand before swallowing them dry. After a moment, he shakes his head, raking his teeth across his lower lip as he gazes out the window, refusing to look at him.
“Leave him alone!” Benny snaps. That makes the three boys laugh. Dean tries to pull away from Dick’s grip to no avail. Rearing back, Dick punches Dean in the mouth, sending his head rocking back. Blood spills into his mouth as a biting pain shoots up his jaw, numbing his entire face. Despite himself, Dean spits the mouthful of blood right into the boy’s face with a short laugh.
Suffocation is nothing. He’d gladly take suffocation, the pulsing, pressing panic of the lack of oxygen in his lungs over the agonizing fire. Over the festering wounds. The carving, slicing, howling pain of a white-hot blade. He knocks his palm up against the lid, grateful when it breaks under the force as he claws his way out with his free hand. Warm, earthy soil falls away as he drags himself out of the hole in the ground and climbs shakily to his feet.  Soon, he is standing again. There is no pain. No fire. No waiting for the inevitable burst of dizzying agony.
Dean sucks in a sharp breath. He feels his stomach tighten at the name of his friend. Three months Castiel’s been gone. Two weeks since the police stopped looking, saying that if he wants to come home, he will. Three months of Dean crying himself to sleep almost every night.
“They’re a bunch of white-trash assholes,” she growls under her breath. The vulgar language surprises Dean. He can’t help but laugh as she gives him a small smile. When his face is mostly clean, she sets the cloth down and begins carefully bandaging his wounds.
Castiel blinks. “I knew you were of high ranking, but I had no idea you were so important.” Dean hums but says nothing more.
Castiel shakes his head. “No. I’m almost done.”
Castiel swallows thickly, feeling the color drain from his face. He quickly places his glass down on the table, covering his face with his hands as he slowly shakes his head.
Castiel blinks, shaking his head. His eyes are dazed and unfocused, as though he’s only half-present in the real world.
Dean makes a soft noise in response, but he doesn’t stop. He’s
Dean doesn’t answer. He slices the blade across Lucifer’s throat, ripping an agonized howl from deep in Castiel’s chest as he watches his brother die. Dropping to his knees, Castiel watches as blood and wispy tendrils of light pour from the wound. With a shaking hand, Dean takes a vile from his pocket and collects the wispy, white matter from the air, and murmurs something under his breath. Again. And again. And again.
Dean pulls a book from the inside of his jacket and tosses it to Balthazar.
Dean sighs and folds his arms. He feels bad - he knows Sam is nervous to start. At thirteen years old, the kid takes school way more seriously than he ever has, and it never exactly made his younger brother popular with the other kids. Sam had come home on more than one occasion with a black eye when they were still changing schools every few months. Scrawny and timid, he was a popular target for bullies.
- Your endless, uncurbed enthusiasm both in the comments and in the server have never, ever failed to make my day. Seriously. It means SO MUCH to hear your kind words so often. This fic has so much life because of your kindness, and I appreciate that endlessly.
“Yes, I heard you, but what do you — “
“You left your mark on me when you pulled me from hell,” Castiel groans as Dean forces his head back. Dean’s free hand flicks the angel blade across his throat, pressing it to his exposed skin. Blood beads up from the wound, making Castiel whimper in pain. “Part of you is...a part of me. You can’t deny that.”
Dean laughs. Castiel’s face heats up, already embarrassed and wishing he hadn’t asked.
“See?” Castiel says. He’s smiling, and Dean is, too.
Balthazar?” he asks quickly. “Don’t tell me you feathered weirdos are gonna be placing bounties on
Castiel swallows thickly. A hunt would distract him from...whatever this is. Keep his thoughts from fixating on images of angels and hellfire and everything else he so desperately wishes weren’t real. And, considering this was an actual,
But Castiel had received no answer. Pocketing his phone, Castiel lays back on the bed, giving himself a few moments to shut his eyes before he begins tracking down whatever had caused the gruesome death of Luke Wallace, a local man who’d been found with a throat full of razor blades.
“Gabriel... is my tether to this house. He is the reason I have not left yet. I can’t...I can’t just abandon him. He needs me. I am...afraid of what may become of him if I were to leave so soon. Our father...is not a good man. I play at the bar at nights because the money is good, but the things they say to me — “
. Here is a place he could picture Castiel; alone, peaceful, and content. Dean imagines that Castiel would wander amongst the meadow for hours, fingers trailing across the wildflowers pushing up from the earthy soil in an entire rainbow of color. He’d tilt up his head and feel the breeze of the windmill on his face. He’d smile - Dean could picture that now - that peaceful, gentle smile Dean so rarely got to see. This is a place Castiel would be at peace in life, and at last, in death.
“breach a den of iniquity” if it meant receiving the answers they were looking for. A part of Castiel wants to know how Dean is so familiar with the location and gender of clubs like this - another is too bewildered to even try to broach the subject.
“What about school?” Sam asks quietly. “And my friends?”
“Did you like that?” he asks quietly. Dean’s wide, wordless smile is answer enough. Castiel laughs nervously as Dean gives him a playful shove, as though to say
When Castiel finally reaches Balthazar’s house, he finds that the door is unlocked. He calls out his name, again and again with no response. Shattered glass litters the floor, and several pieces of furniture are lay overturned and shoved hastily out of place. Castiel runs his fingers across the coffee table, now laying on its side. A thick trail of dust clings to the pads of his fingers; the house had been abandoned for some time.
isn’t lost on him. All at once, he’s reminded that this angel - named Dean, no less - isn’t like the angels he’d imagined.
A boring town. A boring life. At the age of sixteen, Dean Winchester could hardly call it
Castiel’s face flushes. He seems unable to accept the compliment as though makes him uncomfortable. His eyes cast down to the dirty carpet. But even over his blush, he’s smiling.
he thinks to himself.
Without another word, Dean strides out the door and out of the house, yelling to his dad that he was going next door.
Castiel is happy. Purely, wonderfully happy. He wishes he could show Dean and Balthazar this —
Usually, he sleeps. Every day, he wakes up to find Dean wrestling with the stove, getting slightly better each time. He even manages to boil pasta without it foaming over or turning the noodles into mush. Soon, Castiel stops waking up to the smell of burning plastic altogether and Dean’s cooking becomes almost edible. In Balthazar’s small, black box, Dean’s grace remains safely tucked away, and Dean doesn’t touch it or even mention that it’s there.
Castiel thinks to himself. He looks at Dean miserably, suddenly uncomfortable seeing his own reflection in Dean’s eyes. He wants to crawl out of his skin and leave it to rot. No one was ever supposed to mention her name. The fact that she has appeared at the church with Dean and Anna was bad enough. No one was ever supposed to
he thinks to himself, sending out a desperate, silent prayer as the sun begins dipping low behind the trees.
Balthazar makes a sweeping gesture with his arms, implying he wants Dean out of the house
“You speak as though you are just as affected by this as I am,” Castiel says slowly.
“Castiel.” A voice Castiel only faintly recognizes sounds from somewhere beside him. He turns, spotting a man half-concealed behind a tree. At first glance, he doesn’t recognize him - but as Castiel draws closer, he realizes that he’s looking at Garth. He immediately recognizes the angel from the strip club - and the one that had interrupted him and Dean in the backseat of the car. He flushes at the memory, trying to shake it off as he hesitantly approaches the angel.
He stands there, staring at it uselessly, watching its pages unfold in slow, empty listlessness, unfurling empty words as useless as the day Castiel first held the book in his hands.
Castiel takes a large, grateful gulp from the glass, finishing it in seconds. He sets it hastily back on the table with a low sigh.
Castiel bites his lip. Frustrated, Dean scowls at him before turning away and marching up to the other boys. He’s grown really, really sick of sitting by; it was time to
He helps Castiel to bed, shedding his jeans and shirt until he’s comfortably curled into the mattress. Dean slides into bed with him - that had been something they’d been doing, too. Sleeping together, quite literally, if not in the colloquial sense of the term. Dean holds Castiel close to his chest as he weeps into his pillow, missing his brother, missing Balthazar, and wishing his mother was still here. Eventually, Castiel cries himself to sleep.
The case is in the town over, only about a twenty-minute drive away. He wonders, vaguely, if this has anything to do with the angel killings Dean had mentioned the night before. Pamela's eyes had
and never think he was any less beautiful.
Jo scoffs. “I’m an angel, you dumbass. I can do a lot of things. And I think it’s time you get a little perspective.”
“Where is she being held?”
like this.
Castiel sighs. “Yes, but...you were still young, weren’t you?”
“I’m thinking about how I have spent my entire life hating myself for the mistakes my father made,” Castiel says, glancing up at Dean.
Castiel nods, but his gaze is fixated on the necklace in his palms. He cradles it in his hands like it’s a piece of valuable treasure, a diamond lost to his touch. It glimmers in the sunlight peeking through the airy clouds. Since they had stepped outside, Castiel hadn’t stopped looking at it. His black hair, almost too long, falls over his forehead and Castiel absently reaches up to brush is aside.
All at once, he remembers that Robert and Dean had very nearly razed an entire town just to keep a Seal from breaking. But Jo wouldn’t...would she?
Castiel knows he isn’t strong enough to deal with it all.
Castiel shakes his head, suddenly appearing crestfallen. His shoulders visibly slump, making him look smaller than he already is.
“I wanted to, um...let you know that I’m leaving. With Sam. Maybe for...for good. We’re taking a road trip and we aren’t sure when we’re gonna be back...or if we’re gonna be back at all.”
“I think you’re being dramatic.”
“Yeah, and I wish he would have done it sooner so that I could have killed him myself and been done with it.”
I bet that Dean angel told you that you’d get a chance to kill me. That way, you could tell yourself that this was just like any other hunt. You do what the angels want, you get to kill me. Rid the world of one less demon, right?”
Castiel says nothing. She’s lying. She must be lying - that’s what demons do. Castiel doesn’t know if the idea of his father in heaven comforts him or enrages him or makes him want to drop to his knees and weep. But that’s the point; he’d spilled all his deepest secrets to her in hell and she loved every little bit of it. Used it to twist him, to
Sometimes, Dean comes home from the garage late, tired and dirty, with just enough in him to choke down a sandwich and shower before collapsing into bed. Sometimes he'd come home early and hope Castiel wanted to hang out. Most days, he'd walk to the garage with Castiel in tow. On the days his father wasn't working, Castiel would linger and simply watch Dean work, hardly speaking a word as to not distract Dean from his task. Dean didn't mind, so long as Castiel's warm breath didn't brush against his neck when he was particularly curious about something Dean was working on. It distracted him. But, Dean is grateful for the other's company when he has it.
“Yeah, well, we start on Monday, Dean,” Sam points out with a roll of his eyes. “It’s not like we can just avoid it.”
Castiel smiles a little. Sitting on the floor with his trenchcoat pooled in his lap, he seems so small. So unlike the boy who pulled a knife on a group of bullies months ago.
“And now you’re in trouble” Castiel continues slowly. “For hiding her in a…”
Pulling into the parking lot of the hospital building, Castiel flashes his fake FBI badge at the desk assistants (if there’s one thing Balthazar has always been good at, it’s forging fake IDs and other forms of false government identification) and hurries down the blank, white halls. He stops a woman as she’s hurrying in the opposite direction.
“My name is Dean Winchester,” he says gruffly. Out of the corner of his eye, Sam smiles. “And I’m reporting an incident next door…”
Dean not to stop, never to stop as he leaks and trembles against his tongue. But then, Dean takes Castiel’s thighs and spreads them wider before taking him completely down to the base, and Castiel
to look around and see a mostly naked man or a group of eager women receiving lap dances at their tables. It’s that, of all the things to see in the club, his eyes are glued to Dean. It's wanting without understanding what it is that he wants.
“Oh. Oh, right, uh…”
“Dean —” he whispers. Dean seems to have forgotten Castiel was there at all.
Stunned silence befalls Castiel. He watches the man, eyes wide and unblinking, as he turns back to face Castiel with folded arms.
“You just don’t think you deserve to be saved, do you?” he murmurs. Castiel flinches but says nothing. His silence speaks louder than any confession he could make here and now.
“Why would it be? It’s just a bed.”
Balthazar sighs. “I don’t. But I almost fell in love with the girl once upon a time. Figure I fucked her over enough that I owe her this much.”
He shakes it away. His stomach lurches like he might vomit, but he keeps it at bay. He tries to
“Dean, I am sixteen years old. I am not the only person in high school who has never kissed someone.”
The gated border isn’t large. Castiel is able to circle the perimeter in just under twenty minutes on foot, keeping a wide distance as he inspects the gate for any signs of weakness in the security. But whoever is running the camp holds a tight leash. Even as Castiel ducks behind a thicket of trees at the edge of the woods surrounding the perimeter, he has to work quickly to avoid small masses of patrol units both inside and outside the tall gate, manned by gunmen every fifteen feet. By the time he circles back around the entrance, he’s inspected the place as close as he can manage with no sign that he’ll be able to slip in unnoticed.
“Dean, what is this? What’s happening?”
Castiel shrugs absently. “Like father, like son, I suppose.”
been going far, far too fast for the speed limit of the normally-quiet street.
Dean winces. “Oops. Not what I wanted to do. I, uh...how are you?” he asks, as though this were a friendly social call.
Clearing his throat, Dean takes a step closer to the bed. “We’re here about the witch, actually,” Dean says shortly. “The one you’ve been tracking. You find anything on it yet?”
But Lucifer isn’t here and the room feels empty without him. His presence is a gaping wound in the still silence that is nearly impossible to ignore. Castiel takes out his phone again, rereading the message his brother had sent him for the tenth time that day: ‘Revelation 3:3.’
“Yeah,” Dean mumbles. “Um — I think your brother dropped this the other day. I wanted to, uh, give it back.”
“You’re making a dangerous choice, Castiel,” Dean says slowly. “And killing this witch will be harder than you think. Believe me. But if this is your choice...then it’s your choice. Kill the witch. Don’t let the Seal break.”
Castiel smiles at him but says nothing more. Not that Dean is surprised. Castiel and his secrets -- it’s something Dean isn’t sure he’d ever get used to. He watches as Castiel’s eye droop with heavy sleep, and just like that, he seems years younger; a child, rather than the mysterious teenager who walks off into the night to play the piano for old men in strange, seedy bars. It makes Dean’s chest ache. All at once, he feels a protective urge wash over him that he hadn’t felt before.
“Cas, that’s the best damn thing you’ve ever told me.”
“And Balthazar…?”
“A Seal? A Seal of what?”
Male strip club. Honestly, it’s probably better cover anyway.” Dean pushes himself off the edge of the counter, checking his pockets as Castiel makes a noise he’s relieved Balthazar isn’t nearby to hear.
“You don’t know the half of it,” she mutters. “But it doesn’t matter. I’ll make sure you get into heaven. Do you trust me?”
Castiel raises a hand, shaking his head. “No. I have to go. He’ll...take it out on Gabriel if I don’t.” At his side, Gabriel tugs on his coat with a whimper. His wide eyes fill with fear as he looks up at his older brother. Softly, the boy’s lower lip begins to tremble. He looks more afraid of their father’s anger than he was being hit by the car.
Castiel nods, his eyes wide and dazed as he tries to understand where to start. “Yes. Pour me some too, please.”
“You did the right thing too, Dean,” Castiel reminds him quietly. “You let Samuel go. He doesn’t hate you for what you did. He forgives you, even if you two are not as close as you once were.”
“Thought this might be a little easier for ya,” Dean tells him, staring out over the water. Castiel looks up at him in wonder, blinking in slow surprise.
“But I did find a case - a man, stabbed between the ribs by some unknown assailant in a black hood. There were eyewitnesses, but they claim the man was on fire as he died. And the assailant disappeared. No one was able to identify his face. Sounds like something up your alley.”
With a heavy overcoat draped over his shoulders, John stops just in front of the couch and peers at the two with a raised eyebrow. He’s due for a shave — Dean knows that his father’s lack of hygiene typically indicates that he’s been busy. Or drinking more than usual.
“Apologies. Well, can I offer one of you two handsome gentlemen a dance? Perhaps together even if it’s, ah, not a date tonight?”
“You,” Castiel growls. “You knew! You
Castiel put Balthazar on the task of researching anything he could about the Seals. But all that he’d found had confirmed what Dean had told Castiel - there were six-hundred and sixty-six. Ritualistic slaughter, certain spells that had to be conducted in various parts of the world. And only sixty-six had to be broken for the Devil to walk the earth. It had done nothing to ease Castiel’s nerves.
But as much as he can tell that Dean wants to return - to protect Jo - he knows it will be better if he doesn’t.
Dean nods in thought, not looking at the other as he sips at his drink. “I figured. What we’re looking at is the Rising of the Witnesses, Castiel. It’s a Seal.”
“My dad chewed me out for that,” Dean admits. “And...for the first time in my life, I snapped right back at him. Felt pretty good, to be honest.”
“It’s beautiful,” Dean says quietly. “Old...but beautiful.”
“Anyway,” Dean continues. “There’s this club downtown. Most beautiful human girls I have
“Cas.”
Dean doesn’t answer right away. He chews on his lower lip instead, studying his little brother carefully from across the room.
Castiel swallows thickly. Dean’s eyes bore into his own with a startling intensity. Meeting his eyes always makes Castiel shiver involuntarily, like he’s staring into something far more vast and cosmic than himself. Dean had saved his life several times now - had raised him from hell. Castiel can’t begin to make sense of the
“Gonna brainwash himself. I know. Trust me. Come on - the exit to your heaven is here. We don’t have much time.”
"Did you hear Dean play the piano earlier, Gabriel?" Castiel asks softly. He stands up from his spot on the bench, moving to lift Gabriel into his arms. The little boy nods, glancing over at Dean before leaning his head down to rest against his older brother's shoulder.
Dean shoves his hands into his pockets. “She’s an angel. Sort of. An angel without her grace. She fell from heaven willingly many years ago and has been on earth ever since.”
“What I did was not difficult,” Castiel says shortly. “I would do it again if they hurt — “
Balthazar’s irritated face swims into view. With a groan, Castiel rubs his eyes and tries to blink himself awake. “How long was I asleep for?” he mumbles.
Castiel.”
“Yeah, yeah, it’s fine, Cas’,” he says quickly. Castiel tilts his head, puzzled at Dean’s quick response. Dean feels guilt settle into his stomach, but he shoves it aside.
And he will. And with time, he will believe it more.
Dean doesn’t notice until almost ten minutes later, still cloaked in the shadows of the streetlights, that he’s reached Oak street - the street that takes him to the bad part of town. He remembers Castiel thrusting his arm out in front of Dean when they’d strayed too far down this end of town - but now, Castiel is marching forward, not once halting his stride. He seems to know exactly where to go and how to get there. Feeling increasingly uneasy, Dean rationalizes that following Castiel
Dean disagrees. But he doesn’t tell his father that.
Dean sighs. “Um...fine, I think. I don’t know. He doesn’t talk about stuff at home and spends a lot of time at my place. His family is…”
“I mean it, Dean,” he says hoarsely. It comes out harsher than he wants it to. The two lock eyes again and Castiel stiffens where he sits, memories of the night before flooding back through his vision. How warm Dean had felt. How vulnerable.
“I’m going to play, now.”
“Unexpected?” Dean asks. “Yeah. Figures. Humans love to wave the Bible around and harp on and on about what they think God wants. ‘Don’t be gay, don’t be yadda, yadda, yadda...I can’t keep up anymore. Truth is, we angels barely understand what God wants most of the time.”
Castiel gives her a low glare. God above, he knows better than to let her taunting get under his skin. She wants this. She wants to see him become the monster he’s always been underneath. But he didn’t come here to prove a point - he came here for information and a chance to rid the world of her forever. One less demon; that’s the ultimate goal, isn’t it? He isn’t particularly partial to angels or what they do - but maybe, if there is still something to believe in, keeping angels alive is a noble enough cause.
“Next time you watch James and me have sex, you’re welcome to join in,” he grunts. Castiel can’t tell if he’s being serious or not. “He’d like that, I’m sure. I dare even say he’s begun to like me.”
“I’ve never once believed I fully understood what God wants,” Castiel says quietly. “I...would have liked to. It would make me...feel more at peace, I believe.”
“Cas,” Benny says quietly. “S’good to see ya.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re drunk and you’re gonna regret this tomorrow.”
That’s definitely Castiel’s voice. Dean had been right - Castiel was here for his job. A job that, apparently, requires sneaking out of the house at midnight to a shady bar.
But the look fades before Castiel can dawn on it any further.
“So I’ve heard,” Castiel murmurs. Dean brushes his knuckles against Castiel’s hand, making him twitch. The small movement could have been an accident, but Castiel knows that it isn’t. Dean nods once towards Garth.
“Your brother,” she spits out. Her voice curls into an ugly, low growl as blood spurts from her mouth and splatters across Castiel’s face. “Your

he wants to scream.
Dean sighs, rolling his eyes as he opens a can of Coke. He hands one to Castiel as he flops down on his bed.
“That’s just the tire. Sometimes cars need new ones when they go flat. Maybe I can show you how to change a tire next time you and your brother stop by.”
, my beta, my biggest cheerleader, and a wonderful friend. This fic would not be possible without you and your time and effort is something I can't thank you for enough.
for him to do without specifying what he meant. And Castiel hasn’t thought of anything but the confrontation since then.
Castiel stands without further prompting. He puts one, numb foot in front of the other as they walk back towards the car. Castiel has to drive because Dean doesn’t know how, and so he does. He drives and he doesn't say a single word. Neither does Dean. Both of them know that there is nothing left to say now that everything has gone according to a plan neither one of them wanted to acknowledge until it stared them right in the face.
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean grunts. “Time to go.”
Thank you to everyone who's been keeping up with this so far. We're nearing the end, and I'm super excited for the next few chapters.
Bewildered, Dean shakes his head.
In the downpour coating the hazy earth in a layer of mist, Castiel Novak watches the new residents unload their moving boxes out of the truck and through the door of the quiet house. The two boys, one older than the other by at least three or four years, hurry back and forth between their house and the truck with their father, trying to escape the rain. Perched atop a high tree, Castiel remains almost entirely unaffected by the chilly summer rain. The translucent clouds provide comfort - a cool blanket guarding his little hideaway against the rest of the world.
“Yeah. We know that everything can die - even God - but even still, this is...this is new to us. New and, quite frankly, terrifying. Garth is scouting out some of the other states across a thousand-mile radius to try and gather any other intel but...we think we might know who it is.”
physically strong enough to do so. But you need to find somebody else. I’m not the man you think I am.”
After dinner, Dean turns on one of his records while Sam pages through his comic books. He tries not to think about the conversation at dinner, and he doesn’t bring it up with Sam. Truthfully, he doesn’t know how to feel about Castiel potentially being one of the “queer types” - it doesn’t really matter that much, does it? Dean doesn’t know and he decides he won’t care, despite the nagging, pressing feeling in his chest that doesn’t go away, even with his face buried in a magazine. He’s so distracted, he doesn’t hear the sound drifting through their open window from outside; not at first. But Sam does. He frowns as he slides off the bed, edging towards the window near Dean’s side of the room.
It dawns on Dean that his dad never really talked to Castiel in the months that they’d been hanging out, despite his comments about Dean’s friend being ‘queer’ when Castiel wasn’t around.
If there was one, good thing about this apple pie life, it's that he finally has a space for his record player. Dean eagerly takes out the player, unloading it straight to their room before anything else. His prized stacks of records would rest against the blank wall; Elvis, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Supertramp, and even The Beatles all made it into Dean’s collection.
Castiel wakes up in a haze the next day. He feels groggy and hungover, half-convinced the events of last night were some kind of insane dream. He barely remembers crawling into bed and falling asleep. Balthazar must have taken off his shoes. Gratitude wells up in his chest when he spots a glass of water and Alka seltzer on the bedside table. He drinks it eagerly as his stomach rolls, grateful for the Alka seltzer to calm the nausea in his gut.
Placing the book back on the table, Castiel gives Balthazar a slow nod.
” he growls against his ear
“Wait, you’ve drunk
Sam shrugs again, not looking at Dean. He sits cross-legged on the floor as he begins unloading his clothes from his suitcase to fold them.
“Jesus, Cas’ you scared me. Anyway... that’s kinda the point,” Dean reminds him. “You’re not supposed to kiss people you don’t like.”
Dean nods with a huff of a laugh. “I dunno - you think I’d have a shot with her?”
The two look at each other again. Castiel desperately tries to read Dean’s steely expression. He swears there’s a look of regret in his eyes - remorse, even. But it’s gone before Castiel can catch it.
Castiel shrugs. He seems to barely hear Dean. Finally, he tucks the necklace into his jacket pocket, keeping his hand placed over it once it is hidden away.
“Yeah, but it’s nice,” Sam points out. “It’s a house. We never lived in a house before. Not since mom.”
“Gabriel. Let’s go.”
“Dude, you’re gonna be freaking famous one day,” Dean breathes. “Make sure you remember me when you’ve got like, fifty record deals, yeah?”
“We...copulated, so to speak. And then the vampires hunting me down found him when I left and ripped him limb-from-limb. He had been waiting for me to come back.”
“I’m not what you think I am, Castiel,” Dean says quietly. He sits on the edge of the bed, his hands in his lap as he gazes out the dingy motel window.
she howls, her stringy, blonde hair spilling past her shoulders and over her bloody face. She’s smaller than him, but her strength is unmatched. Balthazar is helpless to escape her grip, just as Castiel had fallen helpless to Benny Lafitte in the bathroom. Balthazar gapes at her, mouth open, mumbling incoherent apologies under his breath as tears form in his eyes. “YOU LEFT US! YOU LEFT US AND WE SUFFERED!”
All eyes are on her as her voice cuts off. She tilts her head, as though straining to listen. Castiel draws in a sharp breath. Dean. He had been expecting a far more...commanding name. A name fit for a demon or perhaps even a god - not a human. Pamela lets out a low laugh, speaking to this “Dean” that only she can see and hear.
It hits Dean like a sucker punch straight to the gut; this is Castiel’s father. Rooted in place, Dean looks between the two of them, feeling as though he’s about to witness something terrible. The wind picks up, stirring their hair. He expects their father to be relieved he didn’t nearly kill his six-year-old son - but instead, his beady eyes flash bright with rage.
“Sorry.”
Dean reluctantly agrees. Without another word, they turn, scurrying back the way they came without looking behind them. After five minutes of speed-walking, the boys slow their pace again.
He doesn’t answer. Breathing hard, he glares at her as her words sink heavily into his gut. She isn’t wrong. He knows that she isn’t wrong. But it doesn’t make him hate her any less.

and it’s like you’re a freaking...I don’t know. You’re like...light, I think. It’s all...blending together, but it’s all separate, too? I don’t even know what the hell I’m saying.” Dean laughs breathlessly as he fumbles to slide Castiel’s shirt over his head. “You’re just...you’re beautiful, man.”
“Cas’...Castiel…” Dean breathes. Rigid and unmoving, Castiel stares at the small drips of blood on the floor, completely silent. Ragged, uneven breaths heave out of his chest. Dean squeezes his shoulder, willing Castiel to relax. The touch seems to calm him ever so slightly; bit by bit, the muscles in his body seem to unclench, and his breathing grows softer. Dean’s heart pounds in his chest as he stares at him in awe.
The place has changed since the last time Castiel was here. The pond is stagnant and nearly dry, the thickets of dried weeds choking the small dock that juts out several feet into the sludgy water where he and Lucifer used to sit and look for salamanders beneath the rocks. Overgrown grass and piles of rubbish are strewn across the lawn and over the dirt driveway that trails up the hill and to what remains of Castiel and Lucifer’s childhood home. Obscured by the rise of the hill, Castiel knows that the old barn lies on the other side of the property behind what’s left of the house.
Castiel’s heartbeat through the fabric of his coat. The brush of his skin, imaginary as it is. Dean swallows thickly.
Scrambling to his feet, he forces his gaze away from his brother’s dead body. He follows his gaze up towards the sky as he runs out into the field, and all at once, Castiel freezes in place as great orbs of flame begin rocketing down from the clouds. The wind stirs across the early evening, hissing through the grass and making the barn doors creak and groan against the rising gale. Castiel stares in horrified awe as dozens upon dozens of magnificent balls of fire spill down from the sky, filling the horizon with brilliant light.
Lucifer turns over more stones as their mother turns to hurry back into the house, her skirts stirring through the grass. He watches her go, aching to reach out to her - to call out her name and tell her how much he misses her; to tell her how sorry he is that he couldn’t protect her and how much he still misses her. How much he knows that she was hurting in this house, too.
“Castiel — “
“You aren’t real,” Dean sighs. “I know what this is. I don’t want it.”
Just as he’s about to drift off into a fitful sleep, he hears something soft collide against his window, jolting him awake. He rubs the back of his head, staring at the closed curtains until something else taps against it. Dean pulls back the curtains and jerks the window open, shivering when the cool air hits his bare chest. He glances down at a figure looming below his window in the dark, flashlight in-hand.
Castiel shakes his head. “I don’t understand why. Why would he do this? I know my brother...I’ve known him my entire life. He isn’t an evil man, Dean. I haven’t spoken to him in...at least a year. I...you may not understand this, but he’s my brother. I can’t allow myself to believe that he is...evil.”
Dean blinks at him. It takes a moment before he understands what Castiel means.
"Sam - "
Castiel often said.
She raises a hand and suddenly, Castiel can’t breathe. His vision flickers; white, red, and black. With his brother’s name on his lips, Castiel slips out of consciousness as footsteps thunder into the room in a burst of white.
Castiel smiles. “I think I can try, too.”
“Yes,” he agrees, a bit reluctantly. “Perhaps, if Dean joins us, you can show him your favorite kind.”
Sam hardly believes him when he tells him about Castiel at dinner time. Having almost no dishes, they eat take-out on paper plates at the small, wooden table. The light above them flickers, and as Dean talks, their father grumbles something about getting it replaced. When Dean mentions Castiel's strange way of talking, John looks up with a quirk of his eyebrow.
Dean doesn't want to think about it. But he isn't sure he has much of a choice. Castiel is in danger, one way or another. And though Dean barely understands it himself, the house across the lawn with its red shutters and plain, wooden doors leaves him feeling sick. Stuffed. Trapped, even though the house isn't his own.
“I suppose you’re right.”
Or, maybe, he’s always just been too afraid to. He tries not to think about it as he drifts off to sleep.
NATIONAL GUARD TO AIR RAID FOUR HOTSPOTS ALONG THE PACIFIC.
“But what about you?”
But it hits him all at once:
Wait. I’m rambling on and on about girls. You’re... gay, aren’t you? That whole thing that Naomi was…
He feels sick as he blinks in disbelief at the headlines, each one more horrifying than the next. Castiel throws the newspaper aside, unable to look at it any longer, and hurries back to his car.
If Dean himself feels trapped, suffocated by this small town and its small opportunities, he can only imagine how a genius like Castiel must feel. A quiet, silent genius on the piano, who plays at night when the sun goes down on an old instrument that’s out of tune. Spinning melodies out of the very air itself, making music like a seasoned artist. A fiercely kind boy with a heart of dark, looming secrets. Someone who Dean would go to the ends of the earth to protect, should he be given permission to do so.
Dean doesn't say anything at all. A hard lump forms in his throat as he sits beside Sam on his bed, putting an arm around his brother's shoulders. Sam cries into Dean's shoulders with quiet, hitching sobs. All Dean can do is give Sam a shoulder for him to cry on; a rock in his brother's endless, stormy sea. Dean's ribs ache from when he'd been shoved against the wooden table, and his body feels unsteady as the moving tide. He feels weak. Like he can’t possibly bear the burden of both of their fear. Dean's fear of disobedience. Sam's fear of his own, desperate ache to live a life of his own. It’s only then that Dean sees the bruise on Sam’s chin. Their father had hit him before Dean had a chance to stop it before he had come home.
“Dad, it isn’t like that,” he argues weakly, swallowing his bite past the thick lump in his throat. John scoffs, clearly not convinced.
“I’m gonna be honest,” Dean grunts. “I’ve seen this happen in porn and, uh, that’s about it.”
A Bible verse. Could that be some kind of sign? A message indicating Lucifer is in danger? He climbs out of bed, grabbing his Bible and quickly flipping to the indicated passage and reading it silently to himself. A chill creeps into his spine as the words seem to blur together on the page.
Looking on, he watches as they travel, farther and farther, catching in the wind and riding in the breeze. Taking Castiel as far as the wind will allow, allowing him to be part of the earth that he loved so much, it killed him. Maybe it’s unfair to offer the earth something as
He wonders if they'd be kind. Already envious of how well the family seems to get along with one another, Castiel leans forward in the tree, trying to pick up on their voices through the sound of the heavy rain. Instinctively, his hand closes around the small, silver music-note pendant hanging loosely around his neck.
Graffiti lines the buildings - or, rather, what’s left of them. Much like the parking lot, the buildings are missing pieces. Roofs are cracked, windows smashed, or missing altogether. Some houses are completely gone, reduced to a pile of rubble. He jogs across the lot, coming to a halt at the sidewalk as he looks down the length of the cracked road where mountains of trash line the streets. As he draws closer, the smell of rot and filth makes Castiel cover his mouth in an attempt to suppress a gag. Castiel keeps his hand on his belt where his gun is tucked safely in his holster, his eyes trace the endless lines of graffiti sprawled across the sides of cars, abandoned trucks, and broken-down houses. At the end of the street, a single word scrawled across the front of a warehouse in dripping red letters makes Castiel freeze.
John raises his hand sharply. “This isn’t about you, Dean. This is about your brother learning respect for his family. All that school crap is great and all until he doesn’t have a house anymore to do his school work in. It’s about time you two learned to prioritize what’s right.”
Dean opens his mouth to say something. But before he can, a rumble fills Castiel’s ears. The ground around them begins to shake as Dean’s face drops, crestfallen. Leaping to his feet, Castiel watches as the tide begins to dramatically retreat, the water rushing back out to the sea in a looming swell out on the water.
“You’re going to get your ass to bed.
Dean nods once and begins searching through the house to gather the ingredients for the spell, leaving Castiel and Balthazar to stand on-guard. Almost immediately, the woman who’d pinned Balthazar reappears. She shoves Balthazar hard, sending him flying against the far kitchen wall as Castiel begins lining the room with salt. He grabs Balthazar, dragging him into the living room as the house begins to shake. The salt on the ground shifts and slides, breaking the line and allowing her to move through.
“I’m sorry — “
a big deal. But it does nothing to ease the tension building in Dean’s chest.
“Can we get this over with?” Castiel murmurs. Pamela only laughs.
“Aiding Dean is what happened to me,” he says under his breath. “I’m a wanted criminal. They got to me right after we found out Robert was killing the angels. I barely escaped. Jo told me you were here.”
“This is a real low-level excuse for ‘torture’
What's with him? Dean thinks to himself.
“No, I was sent here —”
He says this slowly, thoughtfully, even. Never once taking his eyes off of Castiel. Castiel passes a thick swallow past his throat.
“That’s what I thought,” Dean breathes, gritting his teeth in anger. “Sam...we don’t need Dad. All he’s ever done...is hurt us. I know he...he’s tried. And I ain’t saying that he...he’s done
So he had been led along. Castiel’s fingers twitch by his sides. “I am going to kill you, Dean,” Castiel whispers. “Perhaps not today, but — “
Dean nods, kisses the inside of his thigh, and keeps going. Within minutes, Castiel finds himself relaxing fully, no longer able to think about anything but the gentle pull of Dean’s tongue over the head of his cock and the sweet, deep prod of his fingers. Between soft gasps and murmurs of praise, Castiel instructs him to scissor his fingers and swipe them around; to keep it slow and when to go faster. He could come just like this - and part of him almost lets himself. But Castiel knows what he wants. He wants
For once, Dean seems dazed. He nods slowly, folding his arms over his chest. The chilly air stirs his hair as Castiel moves to lean against the car beside him.
. I can see your true face. You are -- “
Dean shakes his head quickly. Castiel is amazed at how quickly Dean can regain his composure, as though he didn’t just come across Castiel’s hand for the first time in his existence less than a minute before.
“He cared about us at one point,” Castiel protests. “That’s the whole reason he did this to himself - he cared too much.”
Castiel inside, Dean waits until Castiel disappears inside the side door before quietly following in close pursuit. He waits for a full minute before Dean carefully pulls open the door and peers inside.
“Look, Castiel. I’ll be nice: the demons
Startled by the touch, Castiel bites down on the hot skin of Dean’s throat, pulling a whine from deep in Dean's chest. As Castiel eagerly sucks a red mark below Dean’s ear, Dean’s hips jerk and shake, unable to find a rhythm as a series of low, desperate noises slip past their lips. Dean clings to his shoulder, digging fingers into the handprint, and Castiel can hardly breathe. Maybe the reaction he feels to the handprint is purely psychological, maybe it’s physical, but Castiel doesn’t care. He doesn’t know which noises are his and which ones are Dean’s, only that the two are grinding and rocking with quick, desperate jerks of their hips as Dean clings tighter and tighter to the mark on Castiel’s shoulder. His palm splays across the mark in perfect alignment, and for a long moment, Dean grows quiet as he clings to him before quickly spilling across Castiel’s fingers with a low groan.
nowhere, too. You fell, didn’t you? Welcome to life on Earth. There’s nothing left to celebrate.”
. Dean won’t listen to me. He’s giving up on the world. On us.”
Blinking, Castiel sits beside him, placing an unsteady hand on his shoulder.
“That’s...that’s great, Lucifer,” Castiel says once he’s close enough to look at it. Lucifer can’t be any older than nine or ten - of course, he isn't. This day is real; Castiel
in his groin, spreading warm coils of pleasure up through his stomach. Almost without thinking, he grinds his hips up against Dean’s, feeling those familiar twinges of pleasure shoot through his body at the brush of the intimate contact.
“You should have done this long ago. Kill me, if you must. But do not forget that you started this, brother. I only wanted to be left alone.”
He’d found her, and it only took an hour or so of digging for the right information. An hour spent that would prevent the heavenly decimation of thousands. The thought makes Castiel sick to his stomach. He carefully steps through the door, grateful that it doesn’t creak, and grips his gun tightly in his hand.
Then, the smell hits him: something is burning downstairs. Before his eyes, a torrent of memory associated with the death and destruction that only fire can bring flashes across his vision. The smell rattles the sound of screams in his ears: his father’s. His mother’s.
“You call yourself an angel,” he says slowly. “And yet you burned out that poor woman’s eyes.”
“No. I know I’m not,” Dean says quickly. He points a finger at Castiel. “Man of the Lord. Castiel Emmanuel Novak. Memorized the whole damn Bible by the time you were five. But...never truly felt God’s presence. You searched for it. You looked, and you looked...but you just...couldn’t...find him. Now, you aren’t all wrong - my Father has been gone...for quite a while. But that made you ask questions. Didn’t it? The wrong kinds of questions.”
Nobody followed him - leaving his heaven must have taken him off the radar. Relieved, Castiel peers around his surroundings, realizing that he’s ended up on a small beach with a large, rocky cliff at his back. He’s never been to the beach before - he’d only ever seen it on TV before his father banned television from the house for good. The smell of the salt and the sand is oddly peaceful as he steps forward, away from the cliff, and towards a figure of a man sitting by the shore only several yards away.
"Whoa!" a voice calls out. "Are you alright, man?"
“Good. We will see you next week, then.”
Dean’s throat tightens. He shakes his head, clenches his jaw, and takes the top off of the urn with a shaking hand. Tossing it aside, he holds out the container, as though offering Castiel this place. Wishing he could
do? We steal pills, we smoke, we kill people we screw around with because we can’t possibly think of another way to save them?”
“Dean?” Castiel asks softly. “Are you okay?” He places a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Soft, concerned eyes wandering his face, yearning for an explanation that Dean can’t give.
“Cas’. Wait.”
The two stop where they had been walking, looking around nervously. There’s a thrill in Dean’s eye; the opportunity to explore. To be in danger. To get into places he shouldn’t be. To solve a mystery, even. But Castiel’s arm holds him in place. The kid is scrawny; Dean could easily push past him. But the authority Castiel commands with the simple gesture holds Dean rooted in place better than any muscled strength could.
Dean rubs his hands down his face. With a jolt, Castiel realizes that “every angel hating her guts” doesn’t extend to him.
“Very cool,” Castiel agrees. “I love you.”
“We’ll leave you to it alone. Come back once she talks.”
With a soft
, Dean pulls off his cock with wide eyes. A small trail of saliva connects his tongue to the tip of his swollen head, and Castiel nearly comes just at the sight of it. “Cas — can I? I wanna...inside you.”
“I need answers,” he whispers hoarsely at the book. At God. At anybody who will listen to his weak, useless prayers. “Please. I need…” He presses the cover of the book to his forehead as a silent sob wracks his body, shaking him to the core. “Please.
Without another word, he storms back over to where she’s bound, pulls her lower eyelid down, and shoves the palmful of salt into her eye. She screams again and Castiel stumbles back, watching the salt run down her face with deep-seated satisfaction. That would be enough to hurt a human - badly. The part of him that reminds him that her vessel might still be alive is soft and quiet in the back of his head. He shoves it aside.
When their father isn’t home, the Winchester brothers pack as much as they can fit into the trunk. Dean tells Sam he needs to make a stop before they leave for good. He pulls the car up in front of Benny’s house and quickly climbs out, hurrying up to the front porch to ring the doorbell with an antsy jitter in his fingers. They hadn’t spent any time together outside of school since the day Dean’s father caught them on the bed, and until now, Dean had mostly been avoiding Benny whenever he got the chance.
Dean presses his lips together, feeling the weight of the question hang heavy in the air between them. God, Benny is so easy to talk to. So, so easy. He likes him -- likes him a lot. He always had. He could be happy with Benny -- or, at least, as happy as two boys could be together in a town like this. In a
“Did he?”
Castiel nods once. “It’s, uh...it’s nice to meet you, Alfie.”
“No, I wouldn’t have,” he says lowly. “Despite what you might think, you didn’t deserve to be in hell. I was actually
“Hey,” Dean hushes him gently. He gives him a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I stayed ‘cause I wanted to. Hell, I stayed ‘cause I needed to. You...you made all this mess worth it, alright? Can I just...can I just make you feel good?”
"Come get him then, Dean. If that's even your real name." Her voice is smooth and unphased. Sharp and measured as the day she'd thrown him onto the rack in hell.
When Castiel realizes that he’s standing on his own two feet, the first thing he registers is that he’s warm. Very warm, like he’s standing out in the sunshine on a summer day. And when Castiel opens his eyes, he realizes that’s exactly what he’s doing.
And the Bible didn't mention us,
Dean rolls his eyes. He doesn’t turn it off, but he does lower the volume to listen to what Sam was saying. He points outside, and after a moment, Dean hears it, too; the faint sound of an out-of-tune piano. He flips the record off quickly, scrambling onto his own bed by the window to listen to the sound. Gentle, expertly played, yet tragically out of tune on a run-down piano, the sound is undeniably familiar as it wafts softly through the house next door. It’s enough to make Dean stop and listen with rapt attention. Just like when Dean listened to Castiel play before, he can hear the lyrics in his head, clear as day, as though somebody was singing right along with the melody drifting in a gentle pool of chords and rhythm in the night;
“I would not approach them if I were you, Dean,” a voice behind him says quietly. A heavy hand lands on his shoulder, and Dean nearly jumps a foot in the air. Startled, he whirls around to face Castiel’s steely, blue eyes, heavy with sleeplessness.
“Cas’,” he says gently. “Let’s go before we get in trouble.”
“What are you thinking about?” Dean asks him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s on both of us.”
“Did dad hit you again this week?” he asks quietly.
“Hey, you’ll be a mechanic in no time,” Dean assures him. That seems to please Gabriel.
“Michael and my father will be expecting me for dinner. I do not want to upset them.”
Lost in his own thoughts, he jumps when the sound of fluttering wings fills the room and Dean is suddenly standing at the foot of his bed with another man beside him. He scrambles to catch his laptop from tumbling off his lap and onto the floor, hurriedly placing it back down onto the mattress as he glares at Dean. He looks sheepish when he realizes how badly he’d startled the other.
“Did you know your Daddy isn’t actually in hell?” she asks. “I don’t remember if I told you that or not.” He freezes in front of the table, wordless and stiff as he waits for her to continue. He isn’t looking at her, but he can
Castiel doesn’t answer. The puzzled expression doesn’t leave his face. But, he seems to silently agree with Dean after a long moment of thought. He pushes himself up from where he’d been sitting on the floor and moves to sit on Dean’s bed.
“That’ll sting for a little bit. But you probably won’t need stitches. And it won’t get infected.”
“Will you at least answer some of my questions?” he whispers. “If you...if you were truly hoping this would end differently, will you at least
Dean draws his hand back slowly. “What do you mean…?”
he thinks to himself. A place he used to find comfort in long ago - and a place he hasn’t visited in far, far too long. He brings the car to a halt, makes a u-turn, and screeches ahead towards the nearest exit where the Trinity Church of Michael sits near the corner of a long stretch of hazy road.
“So what’s your plan, then?” Castiel asks quietly. “What is your end goal? Keep sleeping around, keep taking drugs? Keep up appearances until you eventually all just...die?”
Balthazar snorts. Dumbfounded, Castiel blinks at him speechlessly.
“He does that a lot,” Dean grunts.
“Y’know what that part’s called?” Dean asks. Gabriel shakes his head.
That’s a gift.”
in. Castiel isn’t sure he has faith in Dean...or heaven.
A lanky, blonde woman seems to connect all the victims; she was friends with the victim who’d been boiled alive at the party and served as the babysitter for the family. He’s seen her before - hell, he’d questioned her yesterday. She spends time hanging around the textile warehouse near the end of the road. He thanks the couple and leaves quickly, sliding back into his car and making his way toward the site. It’s a stretch - but it’s the best lead he has. When he reaches the warehouse, foreboding and eerily quiet in the hazy morning fog, he catches a figure hurrying in through the back door, concealed by a black cloak.
at him like he’s beholding something entirely too beautiful to put into words.
Sam bares his teeth. “You’re being a jerk,” he hisses at their father. Dean springs into action, spinning around to face his father when he takes a long, heavy stride towards Sam. But it’s not enough; John grabs Dean’s arm and shoves him aside, causing Dean to stumble against the table with a muffled grunt. He jerks his hand forward and grabs Sam by the shirt in a hard grip. Immediately, Dean watches as his brother’s lingering threads of anger give way to pure, unfiltered fear.
when he finally manages to stumble back to his feet.
“Jo!” he calls out. “Jo, I...I understand, okay? I understand.” He runs his fingers through his hair, grimacing as he calls out her name again and again. “I’m sorry. I was a coward. I want this - I want to do this. Please, Jo.”
The older Castiel makes a choked noise in the back of his throat. “No. I didn’t.”
that hadn’t been a dream, he realizes with a jolt - cleaning his gun. He turns his head towards him when Castiel finally comes to.
“He’s finally learning to cook,” Castiel points out. “I think by next month, I might be able to eat his food without gagging.”
“I was wrong to give up on you in the first place,” Castiel says quietly. “I won’t do it again.”
He gives Dean a heavy stare. Castiel can feel his pulse in his throat, hammering away as though struck to life by a bolt of lightning above.
Castiel sputters. “If
angry is a relief for Dean.
“So what, you were just gonna leave me? You thought so little of your own damn life, Cas? Really?”
Castiel shakes his head vehemently.
Castiel places his hand on the piano. Dean watches him, wordless. He only nods. A long moment of silence falls between them with only the soft ticking of the clock on the wall to account for any noise.
to feel weak, he’s not supposed to. Not now.
Castiel frowns. “Ready for what…?”
with pure, unbridled rage. He points the knife at Dick who tumbles back, looking at the other three. Without another word, the boys turn and run, Az clutching his hand as a trail of blood drips from his hand and onto the floor. Dean wrenches himself from Benny’s grip, grabbing Castiel just before he moves to chase after them.
...that I’ll go to heaven?”
"I'm sleepy," he mumbles. As if to emphasize his point, he flaps the blanket behind him, ushering a soft chuckle from his older brother.
Enough light to see if you’re walking out at night - which, apparently, Castiel Novak intends to do.
“This is a song I’ve been writing myself,” Castiel says softly. He pulls up a piece of paper riddled with inky scribblings that Dean can’t make out. He squints at it, trying to decipher any meaning from the drawings on the page. He can’t play music himself - but he remembers his mother, sitting down with him and showing him what notes correspond with keys on a piano long ago. But this is different; this doesn’t look like any sheet of music that Dean has ever seen before.
“Everything will be lost, Castiel,” she whispers. “
The statement is simple and about as close to commitment as Castiel has ever come.
“He always did talk too much,” Dean grunts, pulling the blade out and hastily wiping it on his jacket. He side-eyes Castiel, now too stunned for words.
“They won’t stop coming,” Balthazar heaves. “Watch out!”
Castiel wakes with a start, realizing he’s in his hotel bed once again. He blinks away the dream as he gains his bearings, unsettled that he’d dream about that memory now, of all times. He’d had the dream over and over again throughout the course of his life, but —
Dean nods. “I wanted to say something to you, anyway.” Quiet, Dean moves to sit beside him, still gazing over the clear water. Castiel looks around them, suddenly realizing that he knows this place.
Glancing around, Dean leans in close, ensuring nobody else can hear him speak. “Angel radio’s gone silent - they’ve stopped looking for me, at least for now. We can head out if you want to. I just might have to lay low for a couple of days until their patrol regroups again.”
