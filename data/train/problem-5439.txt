Ed’s voice crackled through the receiver. “Go past the panic room, to your second left through the passage. Now, that leads to a door with a quincunx painted on it.”
Angel removed the condom and stood up from the bed, and Dean wasn’t sure if he should stay. He moved to get up as well, but Angel signed ‘no’, and pressed lightly on Dean’s chest, before leaving the room. He returned a minute later, with a warm washcloth, and cleaned Dean up, then dropped it on the bedside cabinet, got back into bed, and pulled Dean into his strong arms.
Dean laughed in relief, and hugged him back as he caught his breath.
“Sorry to break up the mood here,” he said, waving his hand in a way he hoped conveyed his apology. “We’ll wait for Loki to join us, my friend.”
“I can’t play right now. I need you to go back to sleep, 'k?” Dean felt bad about not being able to give his companion any attention, but Colonel obediently went back to his bed, laid down and closed his eyes.
“Okay.” Armed with an angel blade - both for protection, and to destroy the sigils - Crowley headed off to undertake his task, with Ash following closely behind.
“Yes,” Sam replied, shooting a questioning look at Samandriel, who nodded in confirmation.
“Don’t worry about Castiel,” Sam interrupted his thoughts. “His name will be kept out of the reports, like he was never even there.”
An idea for a way to escape suddenly came to Dean then; he just hoped Crowley would work out what he was doing. “Maybe it's about time you just backed off, you hellspawn,” he goaded.
He found himself being maneuvered on to the step on the floor, which it actually turned out, was a kind of podium.
Well, as long as he got paid, who was he to judge? It wasn’t like he didn’t make his living pretending to be other people, was it?
“The look on your face was very funny,” Cas said, obviously feeling very pleased with himself, before adding: “wait there.” He ducked back inside, leaving Dean in a state of anticipation for the evening ahead.
“Can I speak to him?” Eileen asked then.
“Eileen!” Dean interrupted. He was not about to start discussing his sex life with her, no matter how supportive she was.
Ash turned to Crowley and gave him a dopey grin.
he couldn't see an immediate solution to the current sleeping arrangements, but he wasn't sure how much longer it would be before his back started really protesting.
“Oh, wow,” Jo said, evidently not quite believing she’d been successful at saving Dean.
Dean shook his head frantically. “No way. It’s too far.”
Almost as soon as he was up the following morning - after putting the coffee machine on first, of course - Dean messaged Eileen. As he didn’t want her to get suspicious about his sudden interest in sign language, it took him a few minutes to get the message right, but eventually he was satisfied with it, and pressed send.
Dean couldn’t bear the thought of Chuck evading justice, and from the disappointed look on Cas’s face, neither could he. Unfortunately, there wasn’t anything he could do, other than wait for him to be found and ensure he kept Cas safe. Obviously Chuck didn’t have a clue that Cas was here with Dean, but just in case he did, Dean was going to be extra careful.
“Sorry, man, almost done,” Dean said, transferring the washcloth to Angel’s back and washing the poor abused skin there as carefully as he could. He hoped that Angel would do this for himself next time, but that wasn’t likely if he continued to find the whole experience so traumatic.
This was becoming increasingly bizarre, and now Dean really was worried that they were going to keep him prisoner in this room, and had lured him in there with a shiny toy. “Hey! Where’s my limo?” he shouted after them in frustration and fear.
He went off to the kitchen and found the scissors, waiting a few seconds to give Angel time to finish his business, and when he got back he carefully cut through the plastic and removed it.
As the figures approached them, they suddenly shrunk and took on the form of human males, and thankfully the dreadful noise ceased.
“Mr. MacLeod,” Balthazar started. “I hope I am not breaching protocol, but I am so very humbled to stand in your presence. I have studied your deals extensively. Though I am an angel, I very much admire your philosophy; your demon code.”
“You can pet him if you like; he won’t bite,” Dean chuckled.
As it got lighter outside, Angel stirred in Dean’s arms. He hadn’t slept right through, but he’d still gotten more sleep than Dean. Dean ruffled Angel’s hair, and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips. “Mornin’, Angel.”
Dean rushed back into the kitchen, finished pouring Angel's coffee, and brought it back through to him along with the sugar and a spoon. "I'm sorry, I didn't know Eileen was coming. But don't worry; it'll all be okay, I promise."
“Jo is going to open it,” Samandriel said, excitedly.
An awkward silence descended as they appraised each other, and Dean searched for a way to break the ice. An idea struck him then; one that would get them moving, and give his admirer an interesting view. Dropping to the floor once more, and sticking his ass up in the air, he began rooting around under the sofa for the shoes he knew were in here somewhere.
But what if Cas said yes to Claire because Dean didn’t ask him to stay? Maybe he was waiting for Dean to give him a clue.
After resting for a moment or two, in the hopes that Castiel would feel stronger, Dean led them across the last tile, and onto the ground on the other side. “Alright, Ed, we're across. Now what?”
Angel was still coming, and Dean dug his heels into his buttocks. “Yeah, Angel. That’s it… get it all out.”
This train of thought got Dean thinking about Sam again. Was there any way Dean could subtly bring up the subject of missing persons without raising suspicion? Or even maybe if any other people had been found with wings. Without using the word 'other', obviously.
Coincidentally, at that exact moment a call from Sam came through on Dean's computer. Dean pressed the call answer button, and Sam's face appeared on the screen. "Hiya, Sammy."
He flung himself onto the sofa, not even bothering to look at the view. He'd used his income from
“She’s not a fan,” Dean shouted after them. “She’s a canary.”
“I won’t, and nothing you say will make me,” Crowley argued.
On the afternoon of the second day, Sam called to say he would be there in half an hour. Dean could sense he had something important to tell them, from the tone of his voice, but he didn’t say anything to Angel about that. There was no point in agitating him prematurely, was there?
“Come on, come on!”  Dean turned around to the rest of the cast, and gestured for them to come to the front of the stage for their share of the applause. They stayed where they were though, looking at him uncertainly. He realised he’d been a selfish prick, always hogging the limelight, but that was all going to change, starting today. Or maybe tomorrow.
“Don’t do that, man. No one knows he’s here.”
Samandriel switched on his angel radio, and put it to his ear. “I believe the word translates as fang,” he informed them after a few moments.
-Ash grinning at the camera and giving a thumbs up.
Cas laughed - and
“We need to work out where he is; it can’t be too far away,” Dean said, looking from one face to another. “I guess you checked the church?”
"I should check your leg," Dean said, trying to distract himself from Angel's strikingly blue eyes.
Angel stared at him for a second, then laid his head on Dean’s chest as a sob escaped him.
As they rounded the corner, they bumped into Blue Eyes, and one of the others... Samandriel?
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean said, turning his attention to Angel’s feet. Unlike the rest of the body parts he had washed, which were mostly smeared with a superficial layer of dirt, his feet were filthy. Dean couldn’t tell if they hadn’t been washed for a long time, or if he’d walked through something nasty, not that it made any difference to what he needed to do, though. Knowing that it would make his task easier, Dean knelt down on the floor, in front of Angel once again, then thoroughly but carefully, washed and dried his feet.
With obvious reluctance, Crowley said the detested line. “Even when I lose, I win, with these great deals.”
“It’s gonna be a long drive; about twelve hours. But, sure. We’ll be there tomorrow.”
With a few stops for coffee, snacks, and bathroom breaks, the day wore on. Dean found it mildly frustrating that Angel wouldn’t get himself a coffee without being prompted, despite telling him he could, but he just hoped that eventually it would sink in. It would be good to see him go to the kitchen on his own and return with a drink in his hand.
“Last time I did one of these gigs, they shoved me in the back of a Toyota,” Dean continued, giving the ‘angel’ a searching look.
“We took a walk last night, past the church, and Chuck came outside. And Angel freaked… it’s him, Eileen. He’s the fucker who hurt Angel.”
The next game they played was
Angel switched it on, and flinched a little, before getting to work on his stubble. Dean waited patiently as Angel shaved, and a few minutes later he was clean shaven, and even hotter than before.
Dean suddenly realized where they were. It was the convention they were supposed to be at, like... three days ago? He had to hand it to Ed and Harry for bringing them out here, of all places; it was both sneaky, and awesome of them.
Crowley stopped and glared at her. “You think you could do better,
“Just relax, Emmanuel. Do what you know deep down is the right thing.”
Angel immediately set up a punishing pace, fucking into him enthusiastically. Dean could hear his own moans getting louder and louder, and when Angel hit his prostate he practically wailed.
“Yeah, exactly.”
Dean Winchester’s voice spoke again. “Got him. Listen to me. This is Dean Winchester. I play the hunter Dean Smith on
Dean saw the resolve settle on Angel's face, saw the moment he let the guilt go. Then he moaned as Angel shoved him firmly into the shower wall, licked a stripe up Dean's neck, and sucked at that spot just under the bolt of his jaw that always made Dean weak in the knees.
“Hi, Dean. I’m doing good, and you?”
Back in his realm and feeling victorious, he had a sudden bad feeling when one of his men approached. “I have just received word that Dean Winchester and his friends have escaped custody.”
Dean examined the angel radio model more closely, and found it extremely well put together. “This thing is real-looking,” he complimented as Blue Eyes and Samandriel headed for the door.
Dean didn’t realise that Angel had opened the bottle of lube, until he felt a wet finger circling and probing at his entrance. He loved the tender way Angel ever so carefully worked the tip of his finger in, then began to slowly fuck him with it, going a little deeper each time he pushed it back in.
She sat down next to Angel, and turned to look directly at him. “Hello, Angel,” she said, signing as she spoke. “I won’t speak once we start the lesson. It’s a better way for you to learn.”
Crowley hit her on the arm to try to shut her up, but it was too late. Dean had obviously heard the entire exchange.
Almost as soon as Dean pressed send, the computer started buzzing with an incoming call. He gave Cas a quick peck on the lips, then clicked on the call answer button. The concerned, and somewhat sceptical face of a light brown-haired man, who looked a couple of years older than Cas, appeared on the screen.
When the food was finished, and Dean had put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher, he got Angel to sit on the sofa so that he could check his injuries. He started with the leg wound, unwinding the bandage carefully, but was surprised to find that it was healing much faster than he would have expected.
he thought, as a persistent knocking began filtering through to his brain.
When Angel returned, Dean told him that he could have as much coffee as he wanted, even showing him how to make more once the pot was empty. Whether he would actually do that remained to be seen, but he hoped that some gentle coaxing would help.
Sam was utterly shocked when his brother shouted at a small group of fans before rushing out of the convention. He wasn’t always the most professional of people, but that was not like him at all. To say he was concerned about his brother’s mental state was an understatement.
Angel raised a quizzical brow at him, and Dean felt it was time to put all his cards on the table.
“Why is winning so important to you?” Cas asked, picking at the label on his bottle.
Dean had to try to reach him, somehow. “Cas, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, but if you're in there and you can hear me, you don't have to do this,” he pleaded.
“I’ll have to go to my chief of police, and tell her what I found. I’m gonna say I got an anonymous tip-off, and thought I should check it out first. I’ll get an ass kicking for going in alone, but I don’t think she’ll go any further than that. Jody’s good people; she’ll understand.”
It was at least five minutes before they encountered anyone else, and Dean felt the moment Angel tensed up with worry about his wings. Dean didn’t say anything, but he ran his thumb over the back of Angel’s hand comfortingly, as a man who appeared to be in his forties rushed past them without a glance in their direction.
"You're gonna arrest him, right? Throw the fucking book at him, and if he accidentally falls on his way to the cells, who cares? Right?"
Dean clapped his hands, decisively. “Let’s blast him with a spell that’ll slow him down, and one that will block him from hitting us with a counter-spell. And while you're at it, why don't you toss that at them, Killer?”
The MC hadn’t quite finished yet; he had one last important message before leaving the stage. “Don't forget to buy a
It suddenly struck Sam that the angels didn’t have any idea that he and Dean were really brothers. The fact that they looked nothing like each other had been ideal when they’d auditioned for unrelated roles on the same TV show, and this had allowed them to get away with playing those characters for years. Without giving anything away, he really needed to find out if his brother was okay though; that those scary little creatures hadn’t seriously injured him, or god forbid, something worse.
The woman continued with her frankly tedious explanation, “Captured our females for his own demented purposes-“
Dean avoided looking at Angel's face, knowing that he wouldn't be able to get this finished if he saw how much pain he was in, but he noted every gasp and grunt Angel let out.
“Yes, I found him.” Dean continued, undeterred. “I think he escaped from somewhere… He’s so scared, he can’t even talk. I can’t even touch him.”
When he opened his eyes he caught Dean watching him, and Dean suddenly felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights. He couldn’t look away, and they stared at each other for far longer than would be considered normal. The guy’s gaze was piercing, and once again Dean felt like he was looking into his soul.
Dean kissed the top of his head, and he lifted it enough to look into his eyes.
“Holy fuck… that was awesome,” Dean croaked out.
Sam’s expression was utterly horrified; he obviously didn’t believe a word Dean had said.
___________
It was also nice to know that in this society where almost everything was computerised, creating art was still something only a human could do. Smiling at the thought, Dean began plucking the guitar strings and humming softly to himself.
Dean was about to respond, but was stopped from doing so by the sound of Cas’s voice.
Dean just needed to get through the rest of this crappy job, then go home and crawl inside a bottle. He went back to his table and resumed signing the autographs, but his heart was no longer in it. He found himself writing them almost mechanically, not bothering to even look at the people he was signing them for. What was the point if he was just a joke?
With the greatest reluctance, Dean said, “No, you know what? I'd like to skip that. I got this gig in Van Nuys in about...” he checked his watch.
A young boy, about eleven years old, stared at Dean, clearly enraptured. “How did you know what to do?” he asked.
Crowley switched on his angel radio then, and spoke directly to Dean. “Dean, we're gonna test it.”
To demonstrate the truth of his words, Cas easily broke whatever it was that Dean had been bound with, and took his hands in his. “I love you, too,” he said, and Dean’s stomach was suddenly filled with butterflies.
"We can play it again tomorrow, okay?" Dean promised when he saw the look of disappointment on Angel's face.
Almost as if Castiel had read Dean’s mind, he waved his hand over the area, and the wetness was gone.
Samandriel grimaced. “We are missing the fruit from the tree of life, so we have had to find a substitute ingredient. But we are confident that in Beth’s capable hands it will be fine.”
Dean needed no explanation of who or what was ‘everywhere’. In fact, he could see hundreds of those creepy little changelings appearing from behind every rock, tree and building, and advancing towards them. “Come on, let's go!”
Disregarding her message as irrelevant, Dean spoke over her, saying to his fellow cast members, “Listen.”
Angel stared at the pen and paper for what felt like forever, and Dean could see from his expression that the thought was making him anxious. For some reason, it seemed he was scared to touch them, but eventually, he picked up the pen and began to write.
Laying out the board and pieces didn’t take long, and armed with his mug of coffee, Dean soon had it all ready. He just needed everyone else to wake up now… not that Cas slept, but he wasn’t here right now so…
“I really would like to get my hands on him,” Gabriel growled, and Claire looked up from where she was playing with Colonel.
“Yes, and I’m calling in for backup right now. We stay here until they get here, okay?” Sam whispered back, barely audible.
Dean let go of Blue Eyes as slowly as possible, with a sigh, and a grudging, “Yeah... Uh, huh. Okay, you guys have been great. You really have.”
Dean’s heart stopped. Of course he knew that Angel wasn’t going anywhere any time soon, but that simple gesture meant the world to him. However, he’d made a promise to himself, and he had to get a grip and get back to the task at hand. Making burgers was safe, and what he needed more than anything right now.
Crowley scowled at him and snatched the picture from his hand, silently writing on it before handing it back, now bearing his signature.
“You can’t call him, anyway. He hasn’t got a computer,” Dean laughed, putting on a brave face to conceal how scared he really was.
Since their return to earth, Dean had started regularly hearing stories of people who had encountered monsters, and strangely, the writer of
"Video game… I mean," he added, hoping that Angel hadn't picked up on the unintentional innuendo.
” Dean was close, and he could feel Angel was too.
Angel blinked at the sudden brightness of the light, and Dean apologised. “Sorry it’s so harsh, but I couldn’t see anymore.”
Claire walked over to them, declaring, “You’re not going without me.”
“You said he doesn’t speak. I just heard him.”
Dean did as he was told, feeling the liquid as it cooled his throat. “What happened?” he asked, croakily.
He pressed send, and waited for what seemed like an eternity, but was actually more like thirty seconds. When the reply came, Dean practically jumped out of his seat, and he read it eagerly.
Unlike his fellow actors, who had no idea that Crowley was a real demon who had stopped feeling the baddie vibe and had instead turned to acting, the angels must know what he really was. They would be able to see his true face, after all.
Dean thought disparagingly, turning back to her as she opened her mouth and made the strangest noise; one that sounded like static, and made his ears ring.
He meant it, too; he’d never wanted to hurt someone as much as he did the person who’d caused Angel such suffering.
Angel reached down and pulled up the leg of his pants, until the bandage was fully revealed. Dean unwound it, and wasn't surprised at all to see that the cut was completely healed. At this rate of healing, maybe leaving the stitches in any longer would be a bad idea; Dean was concerned that this would make removing them more difficult.
. Dean realised he was panicking, and he attempted to calm himself down. It didn’t help when the elevator stopped on the next floor down and his neighbor Kevin Tran got in.
“Cas, why were you okay with me calling you Angel? After all you went through, I don’t understand why that name didn’t traumatise you.”
-Castiel smiting a room full of demons
“It’s very hard sometimes, but also extremely rewarding,” Cas agreed. “And I’m lucky enough to have a great network of friends who are willing to help with childcare.”
Dean got a tray from the kitchen, and on it he placed a needle threaded with some silk thread Benny had given him, the sterile wipes and tape, a bandage, a lighter, a brand new pair of latex gloves, and the scissors he’d used earlier.
“Unbelievable,” Sam accused, with his arms crossed in defiance.
“Open the portal back to earth,” he commanded for the final time. He greatly preferred acting as a profession; it was much less hazardous to his health, and there were far less evil entities trying to destroy him.
As he went through the door, he heard her say to his dad, “Well, he's outside.”
Dean was overjoyed at this news. He’d been devastated at their refusal to believe his story, so the fact that they’d come around was too awesome for words. Briefly wondering what had brought about this change of heart, he rushed to the welcome room to greet them.
Angel beamed at Dean, as if this was the greatest idea he’d ever heard, then began eagerly scrolling through the hundreds of offerings. Dean tried to occupy himself with his computer, rather than just sit there watching what Angel was choosing. He found a website devoted to guitars and strings, and he attempted to focus on that. He did glance sneakily at the screen every now and then, however, and saw that Angel favoured comedies and science fiction/fantasy.
Staring at him with barely disguised lust, Blue Eyes said, “Dean, welcome to Heaven.”
Angel also finger spelled his name, and just as when Dean asked him to write his name, his answer was ‘Angel’. Dean was starting to wonder if the guy didn’t actually know what his real name was. Maybe he should ask him outright if he remembered who he was, but he probably shouldn’t while Eileen was here. He had a feeling that question might provoke an unhappy reaction.
Dean didn’t want to be parted from Castiel, but there was no way he could stay in Heaven; it was for angels, not the likes of him. Plus he had a life, down on earth, which… okay, wasn’t always perfect, but with Castiel by his side, it could be great. Dean needed to let him know that, and remembering that he’d prayed to Castiel before, he decided to try it again.
Dean watched as Sam put his hand in his pocket, and began tapping his fingers rhythmically against the side of his computer. Eileen had helped Sam devise a way to alert the police station if an officer was in danger, using good old-fashioned morse code. Sam didn’t need to speak, or even take the computer out of his pocket, thus reducing the risk of attracting the attention of the bad guys.
Instead of feeling informed, Dean was even more confused. Why was his mysterious guest refusing to speak, and only writing in a made-up language? And did this mean that Angel was actually his name, or had he written that because Dean called him Angel?
“Man, that’s messed up. Now I know why you described it as ‘a situation’.” Benny shot him a sympathetic look.
Angel being able to put on his own shirts made things easier in that regard, for Dean, but it created a different problem altogether; wearing clothes that fit him properly made him more attractive… if that was even possible. They hugged him in all the right places, accentuating the muscles that were now becoming more defined, what with the exercises, and him eating more regularly than he’d obviously been used to.
By the time Angel showed his face in the kitchen, Dean was dressed and making coffee. Angel signed ‘hello’, accepted the offered cup, and took a sip.
playing. Fucking TNT.
-Sam running his hand through his hair, while researching
“That’s your name, huh?” Dean said, picking the paper up and examining it closely. “Good job, buddy.” It told him nothing, but maybe he could scan it and search the internet for clues later.
It seemed Dean was going to have to give Angel very specific instructions on what he was allowed to do, if he didn’t want him staying in one place out of fear. That was a pretty sobering thought, but he was pleased to see that Angel had poured himself another cup of coffee.
“I'm just a glorified extra, Jo. I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm gonna die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.”
Before Dean could respond, Sam walked away, rushing to catch up with Crowley, Bobby, and Jo.
“Dean, what are you doing? What are you doing?” Sam shouted, in horror.
“Hey, you missed a spot,” he said, placing his hands on Angel’s shoulders and turning him around.
“Heaven,” Dean replied proudly, as Jo promptly fell over, and lay on the floor looking disoriented.
“I said ‘doesn’t really speak’. He does say the occasional word. Anyway, can you come here?”
Before they could get moving, however, Crowley saw the tip of an angel blade appear through the centre of Balthazar’s chest, as a blinding light poured from his mouth and eyes.
“You guys came,” he gushed. “Who wants the grand tour?”
“He didn’t stop at attaching wings to his victims either; he injected them with something too. Something he calls grace.” Sam sighed, and shook his head sadly.
“Look at that. Would you look at that?” Bobby said, gazing at them in wonder. “They look like little children.”
Sam hugged him back, and Dean was astonished to discover that Angel had come over and was putting his arms around them both too.
“Sir, I have raised the Divinity Den,” Samandriel said, evidently not wanting to dwell on his lost comrades.
“I don't like this. I don't like this at all,” Ash said, clutching at the back of Sam’s jacket.
The feeling of being held in Cas’s strong arms while they flew over the city was incredible, and Dean was so wrapped up in it that he missed Cas bypassing their building, and instead landing them in the alleyway where they’d first met.
“Both of you, shut up,” Loki’s man growled, trying to pull them apart.
Even as he stepped into the portal, Dean still couldn’t quite believe it. Maybe he was having a brain aneurysm... and that was his last thought as he was engulfed in brightness, before he suddenly found himself trembling violently in the middle of a children’s playground.
Making a move for the door was exhausting, but he made it. Standing outside in the rain, he knew he had to get further away, but how?
“What do they call you?” Dean had asked, leaning into him, and brushing his lips over his ear as he spoke.
Dean seemed to be making a habit of waking up on the floor with his head feeling like he’d been hit with a rock. Only this time it wasn’t alcohol induced; he had actually been hit with a rock. And... something was licking him.
Dean pulled Cas into his arms, and kissed the top of his head. "I'm gonna tell them before they see you, 'k? And I'm sure they won't care about them."
I swear to god, if you’ve hurt him-”
He spotted them sitting at a table under an awning signing autographs - Bobby eating his way through a bag of chips at the same time - and he pushed through the meagre crowd to get to them.
Cas rolled his eyes at that. “Oh, for heaven’s sake. Are you going to ask me on a date, or are you going to continue beating around the bush until we run out of time?”
Dean was still musing on these questions when he was finished dressing and ready to face what this day would throw at him… hopefully. Coming back out feeling refreshed, he found Angel in the kitchen exactly where he’d left him.
Feeling it was best to leave Angel be for the moment, Dean went back into the kitchen, and began to cook, every once in a while poking his head out to check on him, and at one point bringing him a glass of orange juice, which he swallowed in one go. He sat quite still, wings folded close to his back, his good arm resting on his leg, and his chin in his hand. Dean could almost believe he was content, with the way he was looking out at the city
With the help of Ash, Crowley had destroyed every angel banishing sigil in Heaven, and now they had split up, he was walking through one of the many hallways in search of anything else he might be able to do to help. He knew he had a reputation for being sarcastic and grumpy, but he did care about his friends, and the angels too... especially Balthazar, who had really grown on him. He found he couldn’t bear the thought of something bad happening to any of them.
“Motherfucker!” Dean shouted. “That Chuck’s a devious sonovabitch. No one’s gonna look for someone who isn’t missing, are they?”
As Dean turned around to show Cas, he couldn’t believe his eyes… Cas was wearing an identical t-shirt under his opened up blue shirt.
was Cas the violent criminal? Dean didn’t want to even consider that possibility, and yet… how did Jimmy die, anyway? Dean realised that he'd never actually been told.
A commotion from Ed, on the other end of the angel radio, was followed by an incantation, then everything went blurry as time was reset.
Samandriel gestured in the direction of the Divinity Den. “Yes, we are back to full power.”
Embarrassed, Dean waved away Gabriel’s thanks and ended the call, then sent a message containing his address. He would need to warn them about Cas’s wings before they saw him, but rather than upset them before their long journey, he would intercept them before they got to the apartment. He just hoped they wouldn’t freak out and reject Cas. It wouldn’t be long before he found out either way.
Dean knocked him down, and his weapon flew across the floor. “Get his blade! Get the blade!” He urged, as Crowley lunged forward and grabbed it.
he still thought this was a set, didn’t he?
Angel responded by moving his arm around, wiggling his fingers, and clenching and unclenching his fist.
The message was to the point and a little cheeky, and Dean hoped Eileen would see it as nothing more than that and respond in kind. Instead of receiving a message in reply, however, it took about twenty seconds before a call came through from Eileen. He’d hoped to avoid this, partly because Angel could come out of the bedroom at any moment and he did not want Eileen to see him, and partly because she was so good at reading people’s expressions, she would almost certainly realise immediately that he was lying.
Eileen then produced a sheet of paper and a pen, asking Angel, “Are there any specific words you want me to teach you? Words that would help you communicate with Dean while you’re living here?”
Dean wasn’t a coward, but he couldn’t help flinching a little. “I don't know how to read it,” he replied, trying not to panic.
“Jo, you never forgot a line! You never missed a mark!” Dean countered.
Once the drone had delivered the order to the collection hatch outside Dean’s apartment, he stopped work for the day and brought the shopping inside to put away. Angel moved away from the window and hovered by the kitchen door, until Dean turned and smiled at him. “You wanna make yourself useful?”
Angel stared at him for a few moments, obviously thinking about the question, and how he might be able to answer. Finally, he opened the fridge and took out the eggs and bacon, and reached for a pan from the cupboard.
Angel immediately broke off the kiss and gasped loudly, arching his back and flaring his wings even wider.
“If you wrap yourself in the towel, you can take your underwear off and throw it in there,” Dean pointed at the laundry basket. “There are clean boxers and pants in the drawers in the bedroom, and I’ll fix you up with a shirt when I’m finished in here.”
“Angel.” Dean’s own voice was suddenly scratchy, and he couldn’t control the tremor in it, as a tear slipped down his face.
As they continued onto the next letter, Dean asked the question that had been on his mind since his first encounter with Loki. “Ed, why do you think Loki wants the Book of the Damned so much? He probably can’t even read it, right?”
The MC had been watching on in silent awe, but he suddenly seemed to have found his voice once more. “True love! Yes! Wow! Come on! They're here for you, folks. Come on!”
that grace thing was hot - Dean took his hand and they set off in the direction of the Hunter Hub.
“You look good together, brother. I hope it all works out, and you find the piece of shit who did this to Angel.”
There was a mixture of emotions as they made their way back to the portal room, and as the shimmering light appeared and grew in front of them. Dean didn’t know what the future held, especially for Cas and Hannah - would they become human, or would they still be angels? If so, were they able to go back to Heaven? It sure would be interesting finding out.
Dean wanted to kill Loki so badly; if he could only get close enough to get his hands on him.
We accidentally traded angel radios the other day when we bumped into each other.”
Crowley as Fergus MacLeod
“That’s great, and thanks again, man. See you tomorrow.”
“Your courage, and teamwork, and friendship through adversity… In fact, all you see around you has been taken from the lessons garnered from the historical documents,” Castiel finished.
Dean's words of thanks died in his throat as he noticed how Angel flinched at his touch.
“Well, you don’t know if he’s even still with Chuck then, do you?” he interrupted again. “And if he is, that’s all the more reason to get Cas away from there. Sammy, we’ve gotta save him.” His puppy dog eyes weren’t as practised as Sam’s, but he gave them a try anyway, before walking closer to the screen, and examining the map carefully. There was an area that looked promising, and Dean was going, with or without Sam. He pointed at a group of empty warehouses near the river.
“You're not gonna die there, Ash.” Dean’s sympathy was disappearing faster than Crowley’s, with all of Ash’s complaining.
They did as Dean instructed; then, after he’d grabbed a box of tissues and passed it around, he seated himself in the chair, and began talking. “This is what I know, based on Cas’s police statement.”
“Anything?” Dean wanted clarification before he did something he couldn’t take back.
Angel nodded, and patted Colonel on the head, in a comforting manner, as if the dog didn’t like the light either. It was utterly captivating, and Dean wished there was some way to keep hold of the image forever.
It had hardly been long at all since they last saw each other, but
“You’ve gotten all nice and cosy with each other, but you’ve only known Castiel’s name for two days? Something about this doesn’t feel right,
He still didn’t say a word, just half laid/half sat there, whimpering slightly. As the inside of the car was already pretty wet now, Dean thought he might as well get in and sit, too, until they were ready to go up to the apartment. It wasn’t like he could make it any worse, was it? Dean was mindful of how obviously terrified Angel was, so when he sat down, he made sure to give him as much space as he possibly could.
Dean knew that Gabriel wasn’t trying to make him feel bad about Cas’s decision to stay with him, but he couldn’t help feeling a pang of guilt, nevertheless. “I promise, I’m gonna do everything I can to keep the three of you in touch with each other.”
. Absolutely not.
“You’re so full of shit,” Jo shouted at him as she jumped up from the chair. She might be small, but she was feisty as hell; you did not want to get on the wrong side of her.
Later that same day, Dean received another message from Gabriel to tell him that they were on their way. They would stop overnight at a motel, and arrive in the early afternoon. When Dean told Cas the news, Cas kissed him hard, pushed him up against the wall, and showed him just how much he appreciated what he'd done for him. Obviously, Dean hadn't done it for any reason other than caring about Cas, but damn… it was nice to have his efforts appreciated.
Dinner was ready, and Dean dished it up then brought it through to the living room. "Food's ready," he said, as he put the plates on the table.
Angel stared at him wide-eyed for a second, before an amused grin spread across his face and he let out a laugh. It was deep and throaty, and the suddenness of it was so unexpected that Dean was momentarily startled. But
"How about that game? The other one I was gonna show you?" Dean hoped that Angel would appreciate the subject change.
“I should have these done in two days… three, maximum,” Benny said, as Dean handed him the shirts. “The coat will take a while longer. That sound okay?”
“All right! Yeah, let's hear it for the badass hunters of
Dean found he was suddenly terrified, as icy cold tendrils of fear ran down his spine. “You really don’t want to test me,
Backstage, in the poor excuse for a green room, the atmosphere was becoming ever more fraught with tension, as the noise from the auditorium filtered through to them. Crowley half-heartedly applied makeup to his nose, Bobby attempted to entertain himself with a puzzle book he’d found, and Sam hovered anxiously by the door that led to the stage.
Samandriel uttered an incantation over one of the bowls, and the previously blank TV screen came to life. On it they could see Dean, and he appeared to be fighting off a green, scaly creature that looked like a...
Castiel re-emerged from the medical quarters then, imparting more knowledge, “And the human vessel fabrication chamber is coming along nicely.”
To say Dean was intrigued by the guy was the biggest understatement of his life, and he both wanted to get to the bottom of this mystery, and get his hands on the fucker who’d damaged Angel so bad that he hardly reacted to pain. It had to be really severe for him to cry out.
“Whatever,” Jo huffed. “The one with the deserted town and the psychic powers.”
He hadn't intended on being late, and the fans were more important than them anyway.
Dean was up before Cas - another bad nightmare had given them both a poor night’s sleep - but despite the tiredness, there was something he wanted to do before Cas awoke. He’d mentioned ‘the rest of my family’ in his statement, and Dean was going to try his hardest to find them.
“Just keep shaking it off. It gets better.” Dean said, noting how different the reactions of Sam, Crowley, and Jo were from Bobby’s, who was gazing around at their surroundings in wonder.
Thank god Dean needed to finish preparing the meal; the longer he stood there watching Angel, the more he felt like a creeper. Turning his attention back to his cooking, he tried to think about anything other than the man in his living room… and failed.
“Did Dean come through here?” he asked.
“You wanna help me make some food?” Dean asked, signing the word ‘food’, before heading towards the kitchen.
“I have a feeling it’s not a coincidence at all,” Cas replied. “Claire and Jack are best friends, and I believe that he wanted a bee themed party because she talks about bees a lot.”
Dean opened his eyes as wide as he was able, and took a couple of deep breaths of the fresh air that was coming through the door. The air in the conservatory was stale, and reeked of booze.
“he wanted to turn Cas into an angel. Man, that piece of shit was so fucked up… sorry, Claire. He thought he was god, and he hurt Cas. Tortured him. Locked him away, made him speak some bullshit angel language, messed with his memories.”
Dean turned back and saw that Crowley was still having enormous trouble walking. Surely his equilibrium would be restored soon? “This is Castiel,” he explained, “he’s their leader.”
Just as Dean was about to call Jo on her angel radio, to tell her that they were leaving, the door opened and she came through. It was a surprise to see that Hannah wasn’t with her, though. “Hey, Jo, where’s Hannah? I thought you two were joined at the... everything.”
"Yeah, us too," Gabriel said, nudging Claire for a response. "This is Claire, my niece."
“Can’t wait to try this,” he said, taking his seat as Angel sat opposite him, and handed Dean a knife and fork.
“No? You want me to tell her what happened?”
not ready to make their entrance. Shaking his head ‘no’ and gesturing frantically with his hands, he mouthed, ‘stretch it out’. Ash hesitantly turned back to the baying crowd, feeling a rising desperation.
“Put your arms through the sleeves,” Dean coaxed, waiting while Angel did just that, mesmerised by the way his wings shifted as he moved his arms.
He got out a baking sheet for later, as well as a large bowl which he placed the ground beef in, along with some seasonings. Adding the onion once Angel had finished chopping it, he then asked,
Cas nodded and stepped a little closer as he swayed to the beat of the music. “I think you might be right.”
Blue Eyes looked down at Dean, just as he lifted his gaze up to meet his, and his intentions towards Dean were written all over his face. Dean was about to ask if he wanted to ditch the others and get out of there, when they heard a fierce and commanding voice suddenly reverberating around the room. “I see fear. That is expected.”
The final sign Eileen showed them was ‘hello’, then she took her leave, saying, “I’ll leave this sheet here. It will be a good way to memorise the letters until you’ve mastered them.”
“Jesus.” Dean panted as he tried to get his breath back. “Have you got any idea how hot that is?”
Angel found his lips again, kissing him as if he couldn’t get enough of the taste and the feel of them. Dean hooked his leg over Angel’s thighs, and he fell asleep like that, sated and content.
“I know what you're thinking,” Dean persisted. “But I can prove it. They gave me this.” He took out his angel radio, showing it to them triumphantly, as proof of his sincerity.
I couldn't find a way of putting Cas's note to Gabriel into the story, so eyesofatragedy67 suggested that I put it here as a note. Dean was right; it was explicit, and extremely blunt:
By the time he was done, Angel had a decent sized wardrobe picked out; the shirts and flannels he'd picked out, three pairs of slacks and one pair of jeans, two pairs of pyjamas, and enough underwear and socks to last him a few weeks. Dean also insisted he get some shoes, too, and a pair of slippers. This was slightly more complicated than it was with the clothes, as the sizing had to be more accurate, but Dean used his trusty tape measure to work out Angel’s shoe size. He could have used his computer to gauge this, but there was something more human… more caring… about using an old-fashioned way of measuring. Plus, it gave Dean a few moments of closeness with Angel, without it being sexually charged.
After a few minutes Dean realised that Angel hadn't chosen any shirts, and he was pretty sure he knew why. Gently taking the remote control from him, he started to explain about Benny, in a way that hopefully wouldn’t cause Angel concern.
Claire moved to take the paper from him, but he grimaced and snatched it out of her reach. “It’s not... you don’t need to read this.”
Once Angel had gone off to bed, and Dean was alone, he retrieved the piece of paper containing Angel's strange writing, and began scouring the internet, hoping to find a match. It didn't take long before he came across the made-up language of Enochian, and some additional research revealed that the word Angel had written was, in fact, Angel.
Dean picked Cas up at his apartment at exactly 7 pm, after sitting nervously outside in his Baby for over twenty minutes until it was time for him to knock. Cas opened the door, and Dean was surprised to see that he was wearing the bee costume again.
“Beth,” Samandriel whispered in awe.
Softly humming to himself as he worked, Dean shaped the burgers, and peeled and sliced the potatoes. He was about to start cooking when he heard a sound from the kitchen doorway; he looked up to find Angel standing watching him, clutching the shirt in his hand. He was wearing the pants and socks - and presumably the boxers, too - but obviously pulling on the shirt by himself was too hard. He did have a broken arm, after all.
“Do you know what your name is?”
“I don't know!”
“Yes, more than okay. Thank you.” Dean hugged his sister-in-law. “Did you tell him who you are?”
Dean was happy to see that each day Angel made progress with his confidence and independence. Watching him go off to the kitchen unprompted, to grab a coffee, or something to eat was a huge step in the right direction. Dean didn’t remark on it, though; he didn’t want to say anything that might make Angel self conscious, and risk any kind of setback.
“Sir. Sir? I'm sorry to wake you, sir, but your presence is requested in the Hunter Hub.”
“Yeah, Sam, you got me,” Dean’s voice finally came through, loud and clear.
How in hell had this gone so wrong?
A part of Dean thought about completely letting go and just enjoying the ride, but there was something he wanted to do. He slipped his hand inside Angel's pyjama pants, and wrapped his hand around his cock.
As Angel wasn’t awake yet, and the apartment was still and quiet, Dean took the opportunity to catch up on reading his emails. He was still going through them when Angel appeared about twenty minutes later, looking crumpled and still half asleep, and utterly adorable. Dean had to stop himself from crossing the room and straightening him out. Maybe in this instance it was just as well he didn’t like being touched.
Dean took in a deep breath once they were outside, and Angel did the same. Dean smiled at him again and squeezed his hand, then they set off on their walk. They weren’t going anywhere in particular; it was just a pleasant moonlit stroll.
Dean was pulled back and carried away by more hands than he could count, before being laid out on the ground by his captors. They were leaning over him and speaking to each other, though he couldn’t understand a word. He understood the intent though, as everything went dark when one of them picked up a rock and hit him on the head.
Oh, yeah, the more help they could get, the better. As they waited for further instruction - Castiel leaning heavily on the door frame - Dean heard an unfamiliar voice greet Ed through the angel radio,
“Hey, get a room, guys, okay? Hey, Jo,” Ash said then, as Hannah did something incredible with her wings.
Eileen stared wide-eyed in shock, obviously as surprised at this realisation as Dean was. “Chuck? Quiet, god-fearing Chuck…?”
, which was pretty ironic really when Dean thought about it. For all of them, their lives had been about as far from ordinary as you could get, and yet here they were going around a board to get married, have children, go to college and get a job.
The face of ‘Loki’ appeared like an apparition in front of them, in a cloud of green smoke - like the Wizard of Oz, but with better special effects - and Dean was struck by how good his makeup was; his face was blue and looked like there were real icicles growing out of his skin, and his eyes were red. He was seriously fugly… Tom Hiddleston he most certainly was not. Dean peered at the ‘god’ over the top of his sunglasses, and gave him a smile.
Anyway, this was not the right time for thinking about aesthetics; it was time for action. He had to get ‘angel guy’ to his apartment before they were seen and arrested. It was obvious the man needed help, not to be treated like some kind of criminal... to be interrogated, or worse. Dean wasn’t generally one for breaking the law, but his gut instinct was telling him to protect the guy from further hurt.
Dean thanked every deity in existence for the heavy rain that was keeping most people off the streets. Angel’s wings opened out behind him, and Dean felt it was lucky that they weren’t any bigger, because if they had been they would surely be dragging on the ground. He regretted not having put his coat over Angel - to cover the wings and keep him from freezing, but at this point it would be easier to just carry on toward their destination.
“Dean, where are you going?” Blue Eyes inquired, obviously not wanting him to leave.
They ate once again at the table in the living room, and once again, Angel went for the food like he might not get any more in the foreseeable future. Dean was both fascinated and appalled by what this revealed about Angel; he seemed to like whatever food he was given, but… he would guess that either food had been deliberately withheld from him, or he had not been fed regularly because of neglect. Both of those scenarios were horrible to contemplate.
Cas’s statement had rocked Dean to his core. Although he had suspected the physical and emotional abuse, discovering the awful truth was almost more painful than he could bear. Chuck taking advantage of an emotionally vulnerable man, and pretending to offer him comfort, all while plotting his abduction… Dean was full of rage at the very thought of it. All that time Cas was held against his will - being tortured - nearly two years! No wonder he was so broken when Dean found him.
Angel not wearing a shirt wasn’t the only thing that was different; Dean belatedly became aware that Angel’s breathing wasn’t distressed at all, and his eyes were wide open.
“Tell him! Explain!” Loki thundered.
Sam stared at Angel again, taking in everything about his appearance, until eventually slapping his hands on his thighs decisively, before getting to his feet.
He wanted Cas to fuck him, but he also didn't want him to stop doing…
Jack beamed at her as he took the gift. “Thanks Claire. D’you wanna come and play?”
As he walked along the sidewalk, looking forward to getting back to his boyfriend, someone bumped into him, knocking the box he was carrying out of his arms.
Dean’s stomach - or was it his heart - did a kind of flip flop at the gesture. It was only a greeting, and yet it meant so much more to him.
“Benny is really a good guy… the best. I told him about you, and your wings, and he won’t say anything to anyone. You can trust him, and if you can’t do that… trust me.”
“Okay?” Dean huffed. “It’s awesome. I, we… can’t thank you enough.”
Angel cupped Dean’s face with his hands, and leaned down for another breathtaking kiss; all teeth and tongues, and moans of pleasure. Then he lifted Dean’s legs until they were in the perfect position, and… finally Dean felt the head of his cock pressing against his rim.
He put one hand on Dean's chest, and trailed his fingers across it, before leaning down and planting a soft kiss just above his nipple. Dean gasped, as Angel began to kiss every part of him he could reach; his neck, collarbones, nipples, abdomen, ribs… Angel worshipped each spot with his mouth. Dean tried not to squirm, but the sensations made that very hard.
“Ed?”
She held the gift she was clutching in her hand out to him, saying: “Happy bee-day Jack. I got you a squishy bee.”
Angel shook his head.
Dean felt a wave of sadness at the thought of Cas’s family looking for him, and being lied to about his whereabouts. Maybe it was Chuck who’d given them the runaround; Dean found himself suddenly seething with anger at the very thought. Thankfully, he had something more important to focus on though, like how to prove that it was Castiel, and that he wasn’t trying to cause Gabriel more grief. A photograph?
did he look hot. The jeans fit perfectly, and he stood holding his arms out by his sides as if to say ‘how do I look’.
After all the gifts had been exchanged, they’d spent the rest of the evening watching Christmas movies and arguing about which one was the best. Sam was adamant it was
In response, the crowd went wild, screaming and hollering, with the voice of one particularly enthusiastic fan carrying above the others, shouting, “We love you, Dean."
They all followed him, travelling across a remarkably familiar looking landscape to the earth they’d left behind, and hoped to see again very soon,
Eileen started to make a fake gagging noise, but stopped as a look of wonder crossed her face. “You spoke,” she said to Angel, before turning to Dean. “He spoke?”
Dean slowly got to his feet, and yelled at the creature, hoping this would scare it off. Unfortunately, it wasn’t scared - instead it charged at him, so-o-o... not friendly then - and the yelling had made Dean’s head hurt even more. He put his hand to his temple, in the vain hope that this action would stop the pain, but of course, it didn’t. The dragon ran at him again and breathed fire - which thankfully missed him - and as it did so, he became aware of voices chanting from somewhere above him. Looking up, he saw a whole bunch of his attackers, standing on the edge of a cliff, jumping up and down and waving their arms in the air, as they repeated one word over and over; “Lupir. Lupir.”
“Oh, God. We're not gonna make it!” Ash wailed, as Sam made an unintelligible sound of frustration.
Gabriel shook his head sadly, as Claire burst into tears.
“You’ve been watching the show?” Jo asked.
Dean located the door, and was about to turn the handle, when Ed spoke again.
The smile that Sam had assumed was permanent, slipped from Samandriel’s face. “Oh, no, sir, we will not get them back.”
Angel glared at him and pursed his lips together, in a clear indication that he was not pleased with that suggestion.
Sam’s eyes widened, as he said, “No big deal? Are you crazy? We have to get out of here.”
Dean had to put a stop to this nonsense, right now. He slammed his hands on the table and shouted, “There's no such thing as ghosts, or ghouls. No goddamn EMF meters, no supernatural. You got it?”
When Crowley and Balthazar reached the garrison, they were greeted with an unpleasant sight. The constant flickering of the remaining angels’ vessels suggested to Crowley that they were experiencing the same problem as Balthazar. A number of them had fallen to the floor, and Crowley could see the light going out in their eyes, as if their grace was draining out of them as Heaven powered down. It was only a matter of time before it was too late for them... and Balthazar too.
That was a shitty thing to say, and Dean knew it was totally not true. They were a happy family, who enjoyed spending time together, weren’t they? Despite wanting to believe this, that nagging little voice was there again, telling him that these asshats were correct.
Angel certainly seemed to like it anyway, and he alternated between closing his eyes to soak in the music, and staring intensely at Dean, watching his hands move over the strings with a practiced ease.
"Eileen, can I talk with you in the kitchen?" he said, steering her towards the doorway. For once, she appeared to be speechless, and allowed herself to be manoeuvred into the other room.
Dean couldn't just leave him here, not knowing if he was hurt, so he crouched down and spoke softly. "Mind if I take a look at you? Make sure you're not injured?"
Cas nodded, as Dean rolled him onto his back, and straddled his hips.
“Ash, Ash, maybe you're the plucky comic relief. You ever think about that?” Jo took him by the arm and held him back.
Balthazar handed him a machine, saying, “Mr. MacLeod? Here is your EMF meter. I have programmed it to point you toward the location of the Hand of God. Good luck on your mission, sir.”
“Awesome. You’ll let us know when you’ve got him?”
“The show must go on,” Dean replied, knowing that Crowley would never be able to resist that barefaced attempt at manipulation.
Dean realised that Angel was looking him over in exactly the same way, and Dean laughed, before pulling him out of the bedroom, and towards the bathroom.
Maybe they could play some games later, Dean mused. He would pull a few up on his screen and see which ones Angel liked.
Dean had to stop himself from running around the store like a wild man, but he made sure not to pause except to pick up what he required. Glue, sterile wipes, tape, and a six pack of beer. Not many people drank beer these days, what with most drugs being legal, but Dean was old school. He liked the occasional beer or two, rock music, and classic cars; hell, he remembered when Baby still ran on gas.
. Dean thought his heart might have stopped. He’d only taken off his coat, and yet Cas might as well be naked right now. Dean could see the lines of his muscles moving beneath the suit jacket as Cas held out his arms to demonstrate that he’d done what Dean had asked.
As if hit with a lightning bolt of revelation, Dean metaphorically facepalmed himself. Obviously, her dad must have been Jimmy; it wasn’t that hard to work out, was it?
“They're coming!” Jo shouted again.
Dean moved the screen so Gabriel could see both of them, before replying. “So, Cas doesn’t really speak. Like I said, he’s been through an ordeal, and he’s-”
Whatever it was, Dean just knew it was the start of something
Looking at the clock, Dean was startled to see that it was already almost nine thirty… there was no time for a cooked breakfast either. Dean knew just what to make though, and he went into the kitchen, grabbed what he needed and got to work. When it was ready, he brought the plates into the living room, then went back for the coffee.
Dean realised that Eileen had spoken at the same time, saying, "He has wings!”
“Bye. Be back soon!” he explained.
Angel didn’t seem convinced, but he started scrolling through the clothes anyway, using the remote control Dean handed him. Each time he paused on an item, Dean put it in the basket. There was no need to measure the guy, because Dean had spent more time than he probably should have looking at him, and his body.
This convention had been a mixture of both high points and low, Sam mused to himself, but the fans were having fun. Especially the ones surrounding Dean’s spot on his own at the far end of the table, while he entertained them with some ridiculous story, no doubt. Observing them for a few moments, Sam had to admit that Dean’s popularity with the fans was undeniable.
Angel looked at Dean expectantly, obviously hoping that he’d done well. Dean picked the paper off the table and smiled, even though he was more confused than ever. Angel seemed to understand everything Dean said to him, but yet he neither spoke nor wrote English, except when he was in the middle of a nightmare.
Once they were inside the apartment, Dean hoped Angel would become calmer. But it became clear that seeing Chuck had triggered a panic attack, and all Dean could do was to get Angel onto the bed and hold him.
Dean really wasn’t sure whether he wanted that to happen or not. Angel had suffered enough, and coming face to face with his torturer again would surely be horribly traumatic for him. But on the other hand, how the hell would he be caught otherwise? It’s not like the police were looking for anyone - they didn’t even know a crime had been committed - and even if they were, Angel couldn’t tell them anything. Not until he’d learned a hell of a lot more ASL, anyway.
“Come on, come on. The
“Smith, Smith, Smith, Smith… Dean Winchester! Yeah! All right!”
They might have stayed like that for hours if they weren’t suddenly jolted out of their staring match by the sound of a jet of steam escaping the coffee machine.
“This is for your body,” he said, watching as Angel looked closely at the bottle before opening it and pouring some on his hands.
Although he never knew what reaction he would get from the guy, Dean was shocked to see the frightened look that spread across Angel’s face.
It was curious, but Dean could swear that in these moments, Angel practically glowed. A blue light seemed to emanate from him, making him appear even more beautiful… more ethereal. Dean was certain that Angel’s eyes were getting bluer too. How that was even possible, he had no idea, but they were without doubt a different colour than they had been when Dean found him.
Dean told himself, as he turned the shower on, and let the water heat up. "Now I'm gonna show you that there's nothing to be scared of. I'll get in the shower with you, but I'm gonna keep all my clothes on, okay?"
he was too close to stop now. Pushing back against Cas’s skillful digits, and then forward into the tight warmth of his other hand, he felt that moment approaching. With a sincere appreciation of the fact that Cas had thought to cover the sofa with a shirt, he came, trembling and gasping.
That was the first time Dean had heard Cas swear, and he really liked it. He wanted to hear it again.
What he wanted to do was forget about the food, take Angel into his arms, and give him a thorough demonstration of how much he desired him. But he couldn’t do that… Angel was so vulnerable, and Dean couldn’t be sure that if Angel went with it, it would be for the right reason. Consent was too important to Dean to brush aside so recklessly, so no… it was way too soon for anything like that.
the sound was even better than his chuckle - and there was a mischievous twinkle in his eye when he said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t bring my Prezi presentation with me.”
Gesturing to everything around them for emphasis, he continued, “Sam, Come on. Do you guys want to do that? Anybody? C'mon, think about it. Look at where we are. We're in Heaven. Crowley, this is the role of a lifetime. You guys want to leave?”
“Hey, hey… you don’t have to do that. If you really wanted to, I’d be totally on board… you know that. But I can tell you’re not in it for the right reason.”
“What the hell’re you talking about?” Dean asked, turning to come face to face with the thing. “Oh, fuck.”
Dean had a feeling that that mouth was going to become a feature in his nighttime fantasies from now on.
“Another rift?” Dean asked, sounding hopeful.
Dean pulled himself into a sitting position, only to discover that someone was hammering nails into his head. Probably the same person who glued his eyes shut. He lifted his hand to his head and held it for a few moments; a futile gesture. The truth was, it hadn't been a great night, and nothing was going to get rid of this headache.
“It’s perfectly safe,” Dean said, gesturing for him to go ahead.
They, at least, would be professional, and carry on without him.
Once things had settled down, Dean saw Claire peering at Colonel on his bed in the corner.
Angel shook his head frantically, and Dean realised that he needed to show as much determination as possible, without spooking him.
Castiel lifted Dean’s shirt, and panting heavily, Dean lost himself to the glorious sensations of Castiel working his way across and down his chest. It started off gentle and sweet, with little nibbles and licks, and sweet open-mouthed kisses, but it increasingly felt frantic... desperate, even. He ground hard against Dean, and his hands and mouth began to feel like they were trying to touch everywhere all at once.
Eventually, Dean heard a door open and close, then footsteps, and finally Chuck was bending down and smiling at him.
Dean had no idea how he’d gotten roped into helping out at Jack’s birthday party, (something about Sam being on call and Eileen needing another adult there) but here he was, at Sam and Eileen’s on a Sunday afternoon, instead of sitting on his couch watching TV with a cold beer like he did every other Sunday.
This day had been full of twists and turns, but none were as unexpected as a passionate tryst with his favorite angel.
The truth was, Dean didn't actually need to work at all. Some years ago he'd made a sizeable amount of money from a couple of mega hits he'd written, and he had more than enough to support himself comfortably for the rest of his life. He enjoyed the process too much to give it up though; picking out a tune then writing the lyrics, and working on them until it sounded right. It gave him great satisfaction to know that he'd created something that would give him - and hopefully others - pleasure.
His mom obviously wanted more information than that, however. “Well... Wait. Ed, where are you going with all that stuff?”
He could see Loki transforming back into his true form once more, but Sam and Crowley had their backs to the ugly blue bastard, and were pinning Dean’s arms to his side. Nodding in Loki’s direction, he tried again. “He's gonna try to kill all of us!”
Angel responded by kissing Dean as if he needed his breath to sustain him. Dean pulled him closer, revelling in the feeling of that firm body pressed against his, as Angel removed his hand from their cocks and rinsed it under the water.
Taking hold of Dean’s hand, Angel got to his feet painstakingly slowly, then let go and stood still, as if he was waiting for further instruction.
Dean couldn’t act on the reaction Cas’s display of power had caused here, but he could show him how impressed he was with it. He took hold of Cas’s hand once again and drew him closer, then closed the distance between them for a brief, tender kiss. He would save the passion for when they were alone.
Sam’s hope the previous day, that Dean’s meltdown might just be a blip, seemed to be proving overly optimistic. He, Crowley, Bobby, Jo, and even Ash had turned up for this store opening as arranged, but Dean was a no-show... again.
In the buildup to Christmas, Dean had enjoyed decorating the bunker and buying gifts for his loved ones, and on Christmas Day, he and Eileen had cooked up a feast. There were lots of veggies for Sam, and even Cas had eaten some of the food for once. Watching Sam and Eileen was like watching one of those chick flicks that Dean knew nothing about, but he wasn’t going to complain.
This question earned him an emphatic shake of the head.
“We’ve circulated a picture of him… issued an APB. We’ll get him; I promise you.”
TV TRAILER: "
Dean picked up the pieces of biodegradable plastic, and brought them over to Angel. After removing the trench coat and putting it to one side once more, it took a few moments of sorting out to get him in the right position, then Dean gently placed one half of the cast under the arm, before manipulating the broken bone into the correct position in order for it to set properly.
“I found him in an alleyway, hurt, bleeding… I think-”
The screen in the auditorium faded to black, and Ash, who was MC for the opening event of day one of the
“I see,” Cas replied, not appearing to ‘see’ at all. “Will you explain how this works while we wait?”
The man continued talking, “You are our last hope.” Geeks like this, who were role playing their parts and wanted Dean to join in, weren’t normally this pushy, but this guy really wasn’t giving up.
Once the convention was over, and Sam was back home and showered, he tried calling Dean. Predictably, he got no answer and was about to try again when his phone rang. The name Crowley flashed on the screen.
“You've seen stuntmen; that’s why they’re only shown from a distance. Our demon knife is toughened plastic; it wouldn’t cut through jelly. And Sam... Sam doesn’t get WiFi wherever he goes. It's just a screensaver.” Dean looked over to his fellow cast members, and saw faces wracked with guilt. “It's all fake. Just like me.” The pain Dean felt telling Castiel this, was matched only by the hurt in Castiel’s eyes. He looked like he’d been dealt a more painful blow than if he’d found out that god was really a manipulative monster, making everyone suffer because he had nothing better to do.
Dean returned the box to where it rested once more, and put the paper with the strange writing in one of the kitchen drawers underneath the clean dish cloths, then turned to his next task of placing a shopping order. After getting comfortable on the sofa, he took his computer from his pocket and said “shop” to pull up the correct page, then began choosing the items he wanted. Saying the names of the products, like ‘bread’ and ‘bacon’ showed Dean a range of options to choose from, and for the next half an hour or so, he was engrossed in his virtual shopping trip.
Chuck was standing next to a long table full of nasty looking implements, and he smiled as they came into the room.
Castiel tilted his head and shot Dean a puzzled look. “I don’t understand that reference. But I believe that Fergus is right; together we can defeat Loki.”
Angel tilted his head and gazed at him as if trying to decipher what he meant, before doing as Dean suggested. He turned away from Dean when he reached under the towel to remove his boxer shorts, while Dean hoped that he would be left alone in the bathroom soon, so that he could remove the wet clothes from his own body.
Dean wasn’t generally a hugger, but
Gabriel called his brother’s name too, but Cas showed no reaction to either of them, and Dean’s heart sunk. They were too late…
“Archangels,” Cas said from beside him. “Chuck made them stronger.”
Of course it turned out that Cas didn’t know the rules of this game either, so Dean went through them as quickly as possible, hoping that Cas wouldn’t quite get it, and that this time he would finally beat Sam. But… of course Cas won that too.
"We can leave it for now, okay?" Dean said apologetically. "Tomorrow's good."
They would be going for a meal first, then maybe move on to a club for some dancing and hopefully a lot more flirting.
“How can we thank you, Dean? You... you have saved us,” Blue Eyes said, pulling Dean into a hug.
“You what?”
‘Eileen is answering the door’, he signed, and Dean looked over to see her waiting by the door, presumably for Sam.
Dean could tell that Gabriel was the kind of guy who preferred to be lighthearted and jokey - he’d even said as much when they were outside - but despite the smile on his face at seeing his long-lost brother, he couldn’t stop his lip from trembling as the tears started falling. The smile morphed into something else, and his features seemed to be battling between sorrow and joy.
“Samandriel, are you able to translate what they’re saying,” Bobby asked.
The limo was parked by the curb, waiting… and thank fuck, because Dean was ready to get the hell out of there and go home.
“Just don't.”
“Oh, God! I knew it, I knew it! I knew this was gonna kill me!” Ash continued, as he and Jo caught up with the rest of them. Dean handed him the box, then grabbed him by the arm and pushed him through the rift.
Dean moved closer to Angel, and waited patiently for Sam to explain.
Once everyone had gone through except Crowley and Dean, Crowley tried hanging back, making a great show of gesturing for Dean to go next.
If Loki had had his way, he would have stayed in Heaven and personally made sure Castiel never got out of that chair again. Those angels needed to be gotten rid of for good. He wasn’t sure how easy it would have been to get out of there once Heaven completely powered down though, so he had to leave before he’d finished the job.
The glowing light coming from Angel became so bright that Dean could barely see, but he could make out a huge shadow of his wings on the ceiling and walls.
Dean fondled Castiel’s balls, feeling the way they began to draw up into his body. He wasn’t going to last much longer, but just to help push him over the edge, he slipped his hand around Castiel’s backside and ran his finger around his rim.
In that moment the outside door swung open and Dean Winchester strolled in without a care in the world, wearing sunglasses, and radiating his trademark charm. “Hoo! I'm here,” he said, spreading his arms wide in greeting. In a clear attempt to appear jovial and playful, he laughed before saying, “Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?”
Castiel gazed at Dean, and he must have seen something in his expression that convinced him of Crowley’s trustworthiness. Dean was still perplexed about why the angels hadn’t caught on to Crowley not having a demon face, but he certainly wasn’t going to question it.
The ‘hunters’ were clearly not as pleased with the proceedings as Dean’s new angel friends were; other than Bobby, they were all staring open-mouthed in shock.
“Hey, Benny. How are ya?” Dean greeted him.
Sam stared into his eyes, saying. “You know, it's one thing to treat us this way. It's another thing to do it to your fans.”
“Where'd they go? Back inside?” Ash asked as they all looked towards the now unoccupied space.
Cas had worked in a finger alongside his tongue, and together they were doing incredible things to his prostate. When Cas reached around and gripped his cock, Dean laid his head down on the sofa and groaned.
The entire shindig seemed to be bee themed, with desserts decorated with honeycombs and games like ‘pin the stinger on the bee’ and hunt the bee (which was basically an Easter egg hunt, but with bee shaped treats), and the birthday cake was in the shape of a bee.
They ate the rest of the meal in comfortable silence, and once it was finished and Dean had cleared the table - Angel tried to do it, but Dean insisted - Dean switched his screen on, and pulled up the shopping page he wanted, with the command ‘clothes… men’.
When the door cam buzzed, Dean was surprised to see Eileen waiting to be let in along with Sam, especially as she had only been there that morning. Dean could only assume that Sam asked her to accompany him for moral support, given her already-established connection with Angel.
Once he was under the spray, Dean found himself indulging in a little fantasy session, with his angel in the leading role. Taking his cock in his hand, he began to stroke, while conjuring a vivid image of Angel stretching out his wings and running his feathers over Dean's heated skin.
“Call me when you’re close, ‘k?”
did that mean he had wings? Dean really wanted to find out; he just hoped he would get to see him again.
Dean waited until they stepped out, then shook Gabriel's hand warmly. "Thanks for coming. Cas is so damn excited."
“Okay, I’ll let her in.”
Dean continued with his verbal assault. “You're starting to act like you did in season five, episode ten, you scene-stealing hack.”
“Oh my god,” Sam said, as they were swallowed by a blinding white light.
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean said, patting the seat next to him. “I’ve got something to show you.”
“Wow. Must be some sort of place of worship,” Crowley remarked.
Angel looked up and nodded, and as Dean came over to sit next to him he held out his arm for him to examine.
“We can bring you back, Dean,” Ed said, excitedly. “It won’t be the same location, but it will be on earth.”
Angel nodded back, then ever so slowly started to slide Dean’s pyjama pants down, until his cock was freed. He took hold of it and dipped his head down, and for one moment Dean thought he was going to examine it the way he did everything else for the first time. But he didn’t; instead he opened his mouth and took in as much of it as he could, wrapping his lips around the shaft.
“Hey, wait a minute, guys. If the dragon is gone, why are they still yelling "Lupir"?”
‘No’.
After being sucked into what felt like a vacuum, and swirled around until he didn’t even know which way was up, Sam and his companions came out into a bright white room, shaking uncontrollably. There was no sign of Bobby - he’d only gone and missed this experience - but from the other side of the closed door, he could hear sounds of movement and... something else, and it appeared to be getting closer.
Sam kissed the top of her head, then they made their way out of the apartment, and down to Sam’s vehicle. It was a horrible, douchey excuse for a car, but Dean was still feeling like shit, so for once he was in no mood to complain.
TITLE: “Not Natural”
No time to think about that either, Dean thought, as he went back to the bathroom once more, picked the wet clothes from the floor and brought them through to the tiny utility room. He stuck them straight into the washing machine, then went back and got the rest of the laundry, added that to the machine also, along with the laundry detergent, then switched it on.
Sam answered in the negative, before voicing his concerns for his brother’s well-being. “I mean it. I mean it, Crowley. I've never seen him lose it like that. Not to a fan. I mean, it was just weird.”
since it was filmed in 2010. Yeah! Alright...” He hoped his enthusiasm would rub off on the crowd, who were beginning to grow restless.
He was about to sit down on the toilet lid when one of them started talking, and it was just as loud.
Coughing, Dean said sarcastically, “Thanks for the heads-up, Ed!” Castiel was quiet, but the smoke had made his hair stick up at all angles. “You okay?”
Benny huffed a laugh, and grinned. "I gotta say, brother, I thought you were gonna ask me to hide him. This will be much easier, so sure… count me in."
He shook Angel’s hand, then signed ‘goodbye’, telling Dean with a bashful shrug, “I kinda learned a few signs,” before leaving with the bundle of clothes under his arm.
This revelation felt significant somehow; that it would help him to understand Angel more, and maybe even assist with his recovery. As he watched the frankly adorable interaction between Angel and Colonel, Dean had another, equally important revelation - that Angel stared at him just as much, if not more, but this was not for the same reason at all.
Well, yeah, that was true, but this was a fucking adventure, and he wanted them along for the ride. “You guys want to go home?” he asked. “You say the word, we'll go home. Pay our bills, feed our fish, fall asleep in front of the TV, and miss out on all this.”
My name is Castiel Novak, and I’m with the man I love. Dean Winchester.
When they were all inside, they huddled together, smiling at Dean in a slightly unsettling way; giving off the strangest vibe, as if smiling was completely new to them.
“Did you get a description? A name?” Dean interrupted.
“We pretended,” he started, willing Castiel not to hate him. “We lied.”
“Get in line,” Dean said, as an idea came to him. “Actually, could you sit with Angel while I-”
While getting to know each other intimately, Dean discovered that Angel’s wings were extremely sensitive, and he really loved it if Dean ran his hands over them when he was about to come. This gave him the most intense orgasms, that would rip through him, leaving him exhausted but definitely satisfied.
“Hey. You wanna take this to the shower?” Dean breathed out in between kisses, as he held onto Angel’s ass, and ground their naked groins together.
“That's it. It's time to go!” Jo said angrily, as she jumped to her feet.
“It’s Eileen. I forgot.”
He rushed over to his friend helplessly as his lifeless body fell to the ground, his wings burning into the floor and walls. Tears welled in Crowley’s eyes as he dropped to his knees and gently cradled Balthazar’s body. He felt a sorrow and a rage he was entirely unfamiliar with. “Balthazar, I shall avenge you. No one in the history of torture's been tortured with torture like the torture he’ll be tortured with!”
“Everything okay, Dean? W-where are you?” Gabriel asked.
“It helps,” Crowley said to Sam in a mocking tone.
As if some kind of cosmic phone operator had heard him, one phone started ringing, then another, until they were practically deafened from the noise.
Ed was full of purpose. He was off to meet up with Harry and Corbett, to get the portal open for Dean and the rest of the hunters, and get them safely back to earth.
“So, why tell me all of a sudden?” Sam asked, sullenly.
Jo had by now picked herself off the floor, and wasn’t looking too well. Dean decided to ignore her predicament, and continue with the introductions.
“Please, Dean.” The man’s voice was fucking weird and deep as hell, but Dean figured it sounded distorted because of this damned hangover.
Angel took the proffered hand shyly, and as they shook hands, Benny said, “Good to meet you, fella.”
Tuesday, November 7, 2045     8:17 AM
-Dean searches newspapers and the internet, and is unable to find anything nefarious, no reported crimes, no missing persons.
“I said I don't know!” Dean shouted.
He felt a tiny twinge of regret when he heard the young man lamenting that, “I haven’t even gotten to the relevant conundrum.” Dean knew he could get to them later, for now he wanted to seize the moment, before it vanished for good.
“I know all that. I want the details… times… places.”
Dean would have been quite happy to continue giving him a show, but when he spotted one half of the previously elusive footwear he shifted his position. Oddly, the other shoe didn’t appear to be with this one.
“PB and J,” Dean explained, picking up one half of his sandwich and taking a bite.
“There he goes,” observed Bobby, deadpan, as Sam, Dean and Jo chased after their distraught colleague.
A warm smile spread across Castiel’s face, and he extended his hand to Crowley, before turning to Sam. “Samuel Wesson,” he said, as the name was repeated in awed whispers by the other angels.
“I thought of some words that would be useful.” Dean sat down again, and faced Eileen. “Coffee, obviously. And also food, shower, clothes…”
“Castiel Novak. That’s your name,” Sam said, softly. “Castiel.”
Angel put it on his chest, neck, and arms, then rubbed it in and rinsed it away, then repeated the action with his legs and feet, and his groin. Dean noticed Angel reaching into his boxers and averted his gaze, giving him a moment of privacy before turning back to find him finished. It seemed he wasn’t going to even try washing his back or wings though, and Dean realised he was going to have to take control.
“Here are my demands,” Loki continued.
Signing ‘yes’, Angel nodded. ‘Chuck hurt me’.
Dean had no doubt that it had caused Angel pain; the way he had tensed and let out little whimpers told him as much. But, as had been the case when Dean had first tended the wounds, he was clearly controlling himself.
Cas returned a couple of minutes later, and Dean found himself staring dumbly for a completely different reason. He looked mouthwatering in a pair of dark wash jeans, and a simple blue shirt that fitted in all the right places.
As always, Angel ate like he was half-starved, only pausing when Dean complimented his pancakes. Dean watched fondly, only vaguely aware that he was staring.
The second time Dean woke up, his head felt even worse - if that was possible - and he was shaking uncontrollably. He was desperately hoping that what had happened with Chuck had been a dream - or more accurately, a nightmare - but the grim expressions on the faces of Sam, Eileen, Gabriel, and Claire told him that it had been all too real.
Dean crossed the room to take his seat, turning to the rest of the cast with a, “Guys?”
Dean’s heart broke a little for the man in front of him in that moment, and yes… he was a man, not an angel, he could see that clearly now. There were visible surgery scars where the wings were attached to his back, and the wings were very obviously artificial. They were white and had a sleek shine to them and were speckled with faint blue spots, and at first glance they could be mistaken for the real thing. Dean was going to have to touch them if he was going to get this shirt on Angel, but he would try to keep the touch to a minimum; he certainly wouldn’t run his hands through the feathers like he wanted to, he would never violate his trust in that way.
Walking towards the next building, however, something felt different. There was a flicker of movement near the entrance, and Dean swore he could hear muffled noises somewhere inside. Of course, it might not be Chuck; it could be other criminal activity, like a drug deal, or gun-running. But Dean was ninety nine percent certain they’d found the right place.
“You met a guy?” Eileen raised an eyebrow and her expression changed to one of amusement.
was Dean pleased to see him. Paying no attention to the laughter, he rushed over and pulled him into a hug. “Castiel! You did it. Come here.”
“Let's go,” Dean urged everyone, waiting as Jo and Ash went to find a good lookout point.
Angel did as Dean suggested, and once he was out of sight Dean banged his forehead lightly on the door frame.
Deciding to broach the subject anyway, Dean asked uncertainly, “Do… do you wanna wash your wings? Can you even reach them?”
“That’s only half a car, mounted on the back of a trailer.”
Dean hadn’t been wrong about it lasting less time; within twenty minutes it was all over, and Cas came out as the winner, after correctly accusing Professor Plum, in the study, with the knife.
As soon as they’d finished they cleared the table, then Angel went back over to the sofa. Dean cast his gaze around the room to check that it was fit for Eileen’s visit. It was acceptable, he decided, but he would need to give the place a good cleaning later. The water stain on the sofa still needed fixing, and he knew without checking that the bathroom was a disaster.
He could feel the rage boiling up inside him, and it was getting harder to control with every passing moment. He needed to get Angel home and safe, and then he would return to kill the bastard.
Dean thought, as he went over to them, wearing one of his best smiles.
The shouts of, “We want the cast,” had now reached fever pitch, so it was just as well that the stage crew guy picked that moment to signal to Ash that he could at last start announcing the cast.
Angel took Dean’s cock in his hand once more, and started stroking it in time with his thrusts. Dean could feel that familiar tightening in his groin, and he knew he wasn’t going to last much longer. He wanted Angel to come with him though, and he wondered if touching his wings would get him there sooner. He reached his hands out and ran them along the feathers, causing Angel to gasp and flinch slightly. He tried to fold them against his back, and Dean wondered if he felt ashamed of them. He needed to tell him how amazing they were.
“Hi Cas, good to finally meet you. Sam told me about you… meteorologist, right?”
Sam rolled his eyes, then began walking, with Dean and Gabriel falling into step behind him. They stalked slowly around the side of the first building, stopping occasionally to check that no one was watching their approach. When they reached the entrance, they crept inside, and Dean turned on his flashlight, sweeping it around the huge empty space. Nothing… zip… nada. They definitely weren’t there.
“I thought it was about time you got your own clothes,” he explained. "Mine don’t fit you too well, and I'm sure you would prefer your own style anyway.”
Naturally, things hadn’t gone to plan. First, Dean had become trapped in the other world and attacked by monsters, then Castiel had been captured by Loki and tortured for the god’s amusement. Castiel had been overjoyed to see Dean safely back in Heaven, but the bizarre story Dean had told about the historical documents not being true had been extremely upsetting. He found it difficult to know what to believe, and as Castiel assisted Dean on his quest to retrieve the samulet, he found himself falling silent as he attempted to process all that had happened between them.
Finally, what she was saying registered with Dean, and he responded excitedly, “They want me back? You want me back?”
That's what he needed; a reminder of how pathetic he was.
Taking up the washcloth he hadn’t yet given to Angel, Dean put some of the body wash on it, then proceeded to wash the wings as quickly, but thoroughly, as possible. Angel made a kind of whimpering sound, and Dean could feel him trembling; he’d forgotten how sensitive Angel’s wings obviously were.
It seemed that Cas had made the decision for him anyway, and instead of slowing down, he added another finger and sped up his movements.
Dean wanted to make some kind of comment about their disheveled appearance, but… they were too adorable. Plus, he was really happy for Sam. He was still going to wipe the floor with him, though.
Angel signed ‘hello’, and Benny nodded, holding his hand out to Angel.
Angel nodded, and Dean switched on the rings to heat the pans, adding a few slices of bacon to one, and pouring some rounds of batter into the other. He walked Angel through cooking the first batch of pancakes, including how to tell when they were ready to be flipped over, then handed the spatula to him.
After that they played another game that was a favourite of Dean's - Dagon's Dragons. It was set in a fantasy world, with villagers having to free the dragons from the clutches of the evil Dagon, and was also a lot of fun.
, out of the frying pan, into the fire.
“I’m fuck, huh? What else am I?”
“Yes.”
Ignoring Dean as if he hadn’t spoken, Naomi issued a chilling instruction to Cas. “Emmanuel, you're ready. Kill him.”
“Fucking…
‘No’, signed Angel, shaking his head.
The angels laughed in unison, as if that was the most ridiculous question they’d ever heard. Castiel explained, “I don't believe there is an angel here who does not.”
Dean stared after her, then turned to look at Angel. “Well… what are we gonna do now?”
Dean grabbed what he needed to make PB and J’s for them both, humming as he worked, to distract him from any further unangelic thoughts. When they were ready Angel was still in the bathroom, so he used those few minutes to clean the living room. He decided to leave the bedroom alone for the moment; he didn’t want to be in the middle of cleaning it when Angel walked in.
"You want to teach someone? Who?” Eileen had that look on her face that said ‘don’t mess with me’, and Dean felt both intimidated and impressed.
The guy gave him a look of pain - or was it sadness - and Dean’s laughter didn’t seem to be helping the situation any.
“So then, how do you know?” Sam peered curiously at Angel, as if that might reveal the information he sought.
“Okay. Let’s go,” Dean said, impatiently.
they were going to die! He closed his eyes as they plummeted to their death, but before they hit the dumpster, he felt Cas’s wings unfolding - without releasing the almost death grip he had on him with his arms - as something began pulling them upwards.
). However, they were all wrong, because Dean knew that the best Christmas movie was
The guy’s face fell, and he didn’t look happy at all.
“Just don’t make it too early, okay? Cas still has nightmares.” Dean’s comment brought a frown to Gabriel’s face, but he didn’t remark on it.
“I am Castiel,” he confirmed. “On behalf of us all, I wish to thank you, from the deepest place in our hearts.”
When Sam and the rest of the cast - minus Dean, obviously - had arrived back in Heaven through the rift, they were greeted by Inias and Samandriel. Inias had taken the Hand of God straight to the Divinity Den, while Samandriel had hurriedly led them to a room they hadn’t seen before. Oddly, it looked exactly like one of those always gaudily decorated, dingy motels they frequently stayed in on the show. On the table were spell books, bowls containing different ingredients, and a small TV that looked like it was made in the 1950s.
“Mm hmmm,” Dean said distractedly, sipping his Coke and trying to keep up with the woman, both literally and figuratively. “Okay, I got the picture. Do you have angel radios, or do you want me to wing this?”
Dean brought the radio to his mouth. “Castiel, meet us in the Hunter Hub.” When there was no reply, he tried again, with a frantic desperation. “Castiel... Castiel! Balthazar!” Still nothing. “Why can't we reach them?” he asked Samandriel.
Taking out the samulet, he held it up to show Castiel, who nodded in acknowledgment.
Unfortunately for him, the young man was not getting the hint. “Right, but... 'Cause we were wondering what technique you used. Did you use any other parts-”
"I'll show you a different game after dinner." Dean waved his fork, face colouring as the words came out of his mouth.
The voice of one Ed’s friends rang out behind him, saying, “he did it again.”
“I mean, this is unreal,” Sam said in exasperation as he gestured in the direction of the stage. “They’re gonna start eating each other out there.”
Castiel seemed unable to contain his merriment, and he pulled out of the hug, chuckling. “Only half a car, mounted on the back of a trailer. A very clever deception indeed.” He and the rest of the angels laughed raucously again, and Dean smiled fondly at him.
“No, no. You’re sleeping in there,” Dean waved towards the bedroom, “and I’m gonna make myself comfortable in here.”
“Oh, yes, sir. He's a very bad man indeed. He has tortured some of us, sent others to alternate worlds, never to be seen again,” she explained as she turned him around and got him walking once more in the right direction. Godammit, this place was huge.
“Emmanuel, there you are. I’ve missed you,” Chuck said, smarmily. “I know you don’t want Dean to suffer, so I’m offering you a swap. You come back to where you’re supposed to be, and Dean doesn’t get hurt any more than he already has.”
The look on Angel’s face indicated that Dean had said something wrong, and it took him a few moments to catch on to what it was.
“The sequence for the tiles is L. E. G. N. A,” Ed informed them, and Dean took a moment to realise that that was ‘Angel’ spelled backwards. Dean was unable to read Enochian, so it was up to Castiel to indicate the path they needed to take through the tiles. Dean stepped gingerly onto the first one, and when it stayed firm under their feet, they moved carefully onto the next.
Dean noticed that Eileen looked somewhat disappointed with his response. His sister-in-law had always cared about his well-being, and wanted him to be happy.
“What’s your name?” Dean asked the woman, as he stifled a yawn.
“Puny god,” Dean muttered under his breath, as Sam, Crowley, Bobby and Ash jumped up and down, punched the air, and cheered in celebration.
Dean wondered if the determined way Castiel was moving against him, and using his hands and mouth to explore as if he couldn’t get enough of the feel and taste of him, was because Castiel figured they probably didn’t have much time before they were interrupted. Or maybe it was that over the last few days, he’d fantasised about this as much as Dean had. Either way, it felt good... really good.
“Do you remember anything about who you are?”
“Sir, I am Samandriel,” the other previously silent guy then spoke up. “I would like to explain the history between our kind and the god Loki in greater detail.”
When the burgers were all made - with no further interruptions - Dean put two in a pan and got Angel to get plates, buns, and salad, while he vacuum packed the rest before sticking them in the freezer. By the time they sat down to eat, he was really hungry, and from the enthusiastic way Angel tore into his burger, he was too.
Jo, however, was backing away, with a look of sheer panic on her face. “I mean, I can't. I can supervise...” she babbled.
he really wasn’t playing fair.
That didn’t sound good. As Dean wondered what the hell they were going to do, Ed’s voice coming through the angel radio prompted Dean to lift it to his mouth and talk to the young man.
When it arrived on his floor, Dean was faced with Gabriel, who was noticeably shorter than Cas, and a teenage girl with golden hair in braids, and a scowl on her face that said 'don't mess with me'.
Sam and Crowley finally realized what was happening, and accepted that Dean had been telling the truth, releasing him with sheepish expressions on their faces.
He’d taken a clear plastic bag from his coat pocket, and he put it down carefully on the table, though Dean couldn’t see what it contained. “I knew that Chuck was going to visit one of the homeless shelters, so I waited until he left, then went inside his residence behind the church. What I found was chilling; he’s definitely our man.”
