"I know," he exhales deeply, stung. "You're Captain America. In the end, you'll always be Captain America."
"Is it?"
"So tell me," Steve says, fondness etched into every pore on his face, giving Tony a familiar look. Giving him space to talk, to speak, to air his grievances and be heard.
"Tony."
"I don't know how to give you a percentage of me. I've tried — I have. I just don't know how; even though I should, I really should, after all these years, but I don't. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, for me to step one single toe out of your proverbial line in the sand, and for this whole thing to be over."
"Good."
"Have you? How great. Maybe you should've come home, then. I've been here, all this time, you know?"
Brilliant blue eyes flash with pain. "I wish—"
is still so new to all of this, you know? And when Wanda left— let's just say it was hard."
So Tony parties, ordering FRIDAY to keep Pepper, Rhodey, and any of the Avengers away from the tower, to redirect all of his calls — if there are any, which he doubts —, and to cancel every single one of his appointments. The last thing he wants is to see a familiar face, at the moment.
That's the moment Steve pounces. Unsurprisingly, Tony is not ready for it.
Tony has lived too long without them. Without him.
Honestly, it doesn't seem worth it.
"Yes, he showed up, like, three months ago."
"I still do what, Steve? You think there's something to go back to?"
Tony has enough self-awareness to know what that would mean.
Steve blinks. "Wait, Bruce is with you?"
But there's something he needs to know, first.
He can deal with having them around.
Steve studies him; blue eyes sharp. "Were you hoping to avoid me forever?"
are the one who doesn't get to use your public persona to avoid dealing with your emotions, Tony."
It's easy, though.
Tony gives in — like he always knew he would.
"Rogers."
"If I still what? Tony questions, dares. He takes a deep breath, and another. "God, you have no idea how it has been…"
Yet, even though he understands that it's inevitable, that there will come a time where he will have nowhere to hide and no choice but to pay for the endless shits he's done, Tony is protesting, struggling, trying to postpone it as best as he knows how.
they've arrived. Of course he knows. He doesn't leave his workshop, and he certainly doesn't show his face or allows any of them to access his private space, but he knows the second they land on the Avengers Compound — watches from a screen as they step out of the Quinjet and make their way inside.
"You don't have to," Steve soothes with a tortured expression. His whole face is twisted in a pained frown. "I feel it too. Tony, I get it."
Tony's living in the moment. Or rather, the travesty that the present has become.
Which simply means that the party can never be over.
"Well, can you? Do you think you can love me? Despite all this shit?" Tony asks, desperately. He needs to know, even if the answer crushes him, even if it will tear his heart open once again, right there, in his sparkling clean kitchen, where the stains of blood won't ever come off. He swallows. "Can you love me naked?"
Steve grabs his forearm, but doesn't tighten his grip or pull him closer. Just touches him.
There a pause, where time seems to stop and the world holds its collective breath, waiting for an answer, a decision, a change in the tone of the conversation. It's heavy, but
Tony shakes his head, sighing. The proximity is doing things to his head, messing with his mind, turning his breathing cycle into a mess. He doesn't need to hear the rest of the sentence to understand what's being said.
"I needed to do this. I needed to."
Fuck him. Fuck them. Tony never needed anyone, and it's about time that he reminded himself of that.
That's what he tells himself, over and over, for three days straight, until his coffee beans run out and he has to face the outside world to fetch more.
At some point, someone shoves a cigar into his mouth — already lit and burning — and Tony has only to take one deep drag to remind himself how much he missed it — the smoke, the heat, the smell, the comforting gesture of closing his eyes and feeling his senses being clouded by wood and Cognac. It's exquisite, perfect. Not even in the same category of the pathetic nicotines patches be tried in the past — for Pepper, for his work, for Iron Man, for the Avengers, for being better, and nicer, and a team-worker.
"Yes." Steve nods, serious. No evasion, no plays.
"You know it is."
so glorious.
With having Steve around.
. Not happening."
"It's been three days," Steve says from his place leaning against the doorway, and Tony sort of hates himself for being able to read in between the lines, for hearing that voice and instantly cataloging the hundreds of nuances of it. It's like no time has passed, and he despises it.
Which is why the party is still going strong, occupying the entirety of his penthouse — the penthouse of an otherwise empty tower. The Stark Tower. The Avengers Tower. The building that he had once sold — perhaps thinking that he wouldn't need it anymore. The decision had been foolish, idiotic, but that was the pattern with him, the M.O he couldn't help but adhere to, so, in a way, it was still on brand, much like the illegal rave happening on his property.
He can.
"This just hurts too much, Steve," Tony admits, and his voice breaks and hitches and cracks and his chest feels so tight that it might as well explode at any given moment. "This hurts in ways I can't explain."
"And Peter! God, Steve, Peter is eighteen. Eighteen! He wants to save the world, and work with the police, and be a scientist."
An act of freedom, of comfort. Something like putting on an old shirt or a favorite pair of shoes — it fits, it's shaped and modeled according to his body, and, best of all, it requires no conscious thought or decision-making process on his part.
easy to fall back into his old habits.
The pain, the sadness, the frustration, the loneliness, the anguish — it's all there, threatening to erupt from his chest with the slightest nudge in the right direction.
"Tony, I—" Steve tries to interrupts, but now that he's started, Tony is on a roll, and he can't stop. Couldn't stop even if he tried.
"Don't say that." Steve shakes his head, closing his eyes. "I know precisely who you are — all bits included.
The rule is simple: If the booze keeps on coming, the music keeps on blasting from every corner of the rooms, and the women keep draping themselves all over him, constantly fighting for his attention, then he can pretend the outside world does not exist and that this is all there is to know.
Tony can't. The tears are falling down, and he's breaking. "I'm such a fucking mess, Steve. I hate you. I hate you so goddamn much."
"I have an idea of how hard—"
It's insane. Steve is strong, and steady, and willing to listen patiently about whatever Tony wants to speak of, and Tony didn't know how badly he needed that until it's offered to him and his hands shake. Suddenly, he needs to say it, to let Steve know the mess he left behind.
"I'm not suited to be a leader," he admits, whispering the words, as though that might make them any less painful. "I get caught up with my work, and sometimes I'll stay up for days on end in my workshop coming up with new stuff, and that's what I do. But since you— well, since you left, it's been chaos. Natasha, Vision, Bruce, Peter — God, Peter — they all look at me for guidance, for orders... Everything. You have no idea how much added pressure that's been for me."
Missed him? Tony's missed Steve like a severed limb, like half of his very soul had been taken from him and dragged away into some mysterious corner of the earth without his consent. There's not a strong enough word to describe how Tony felt — feels — every day with Steve's absence.
"You left me."
Their eyes meet, and it's fire. "There's not a line. There's never been a line," Steve promises, tilting his chin up so their lips rub together. Slowly, so slowly. "I'm still here, aren't I? Stop pushing me away just because you can't handle the idea that maybe someone does love you, unconditionally. That I'll still be here no matter what."
And he tries. Tries to step forward and hold his coffee like a lifeline and side-step Steve so he can get out of the kitchen and go back to his workshop, where there's math, and sense, and most importantly, no Steve.
"Since I was the one who had to deal with all the crap you left behind, Capsicle, I think I know exactly what it was about."
"I could be persuaded." Tony hears his voice, feels his mouth moving, but doesn't remember deciding to say that, or to put the cigar away on his bedside table, or to unbuckle his belt and smirk lazily at the naked body supporting several lines of blow.
And it works. It works, 'cause Tony is, deep down inside, a horrible human being — despite his many attempts at evening his miserable odds — and the darkness clings to him, recognizing a familiar face when it sees one.
“Not super per se, just a really sturdy vibrator. And Steve doesn't even like it, so you can have it.”
Once the Soldiers were safely out of the Avengers' custody, they no longer needed to stay in Vienna. T'challa promised them that he'd do everything in his power to make sure the Accords situation went in their favor. Everyone headed out to the Quinjet.
There were twelve tac team members, fully suited and ready for a mission. Their team took up the left three tables in the front two rows, but two members were standing in the front of the room in conversation. The Avengers weren't provided with the tac team's personnel information as it was considered top secret, but they assumed that the grizzly, older man at the front was their leader.
During the apprehension of Zemo, the team had found in his possession a red book with a black star on it. The entire thing was in Russian, so Natasha volunteered to read it and was still doing so when the jet landed.
Steve hesitated. He reminded himself of the big picture: that keeping the team together and protecting Bucky and Wanda were more important than making sure this dickhead got his comeuppance in a timely manner. He turned to go back to his assigned seat but didn't get to take even a step before-
Tony was one step ahead of him. He commanded the attention of the room, something he was very good at. “Sergeant Barnes is
Steve huffed like he was somehow the one who should feel put out. After a quick kiss on Bucky's lips, though, he did start moving again. In a few seconds, Bucky was cumming inside of him, and Steve returned to lying on Bucky.
Bucky fiddled with the new bracelet on his metal left wrist as he stared at Wanda. “Yeah,” he agreed hesitantly. “It's worth a try. And I trust her.”
“I could have every last one of you hanged for treason for not alerting your country to the presence of the goddamn Winter Soldier!”
Steve squirmed uncomfortably in his seat. He glanced quickly at Natasha before looking back at Tony. “Don't you think this is a private conversation?”
Tony stayed with Wanda and Bucky at the bottom of the ramp until Steve was out of sight, then he covered his mouth to muffle a snicker. “You two should be ashamed of yourselves!” he lectured as loudly and sternly as he could. He muffled another snicker. “This has been really hard on him!”
Even Steve laughed at that one. The party was broken up by a knock at the door. Steve hustled to answer it.
“Mr. Stark!”
“Alright. I wanted to wait because I think it's a little soon, but here goes. The best case scenario for us long term, like in the distant-distant future, is if the three of us were to eventually become a 'throuple.' It's like a couple, but with three people.”
The bathroom door opened, and Bucky walked through it naked. “What's wrong?” He must have sensed the anxiety in Steve's voice.
“Mm-hm,” Clint agreed. “I'm sure you were
Steve shrugged. “I don't wear out. And Tony comes when I
“There's an emergency,” Steve explained calmly, despite the urgent situation. “Our intel suggests that the Winter Soldiers are faking being controlled.”
Tony speculated, “What's the kill rate on that, about one-point-five per second?”
Clint looked around, feigning confusion. He'd noticed what they'd done, too, and he wasn't gonna have it. He pointed at himself. “Me? You think
“That's smart,” Clint said apathetically.
“A little quicker next time, FRIDAY,” Tony instructed, annoyed at the intrusion.
“Yeah.” Bucky pulled out his new Avengers cell phone and was just about to do what Tony asked when the three of them started to head back into the Quinjet. He dropped the phone, lunged forward, and caught Natasha by the forearm that was attached to the Winter Soldier manual. “
“Everybody get down!” his son could be heard shouting off-screen.
That got Steve's attention. “It
“Tony, you can't run those. We're not even supposed to know the guy's name. If the- Hey!”
“Let go,” Steve said.
Steve got his kiss then. It was odd but thrilling having Tony's lips on his and Bucky's lips on the side of his neck. Threesomes had never held his interest, but then, he associated them with casual sex. He loved both Tony and Bucky deep down into his bones. For the first time, he was really looking forward to the threesomes their future relationship promised.
“You will have to excuse us if we aren't comfortable relying on your government's word that a previous Hydra agent, willing or not, is safe to be amongst our civilian populations. We must send our own investigators.”
“They're awful long for friendship bracelets,” Natasha pointed out, noticing that a single bracelet had to be wrapped around the wrist several times. “What do they say?”
Steve started to turn to see, but Tony stilled him with a hand on his hip. Tony was crouching behind him, holding his phone maybe a foot from his butt. “What
Without breaking eye contact, he leaned down and planted a kiss right in the crease where Steve's left upper thigh met his groin. Another jump. He massaged Steve's prostate with his fingers, letting the very tip of his thumb tease his stretched hole. He kissed Steve again, this time at the base of his penis. He started trailing little kisses up the side of the shaft until he felt something wet on his cheek. He wiped the fluid off his cheek with his metal index finger. He tore his gaze away from Steve's face just long enough to glance at the pearly bead: precum, naturally. He re-established eye contact, then put that metal finger in his mouth and sucked the liquid off of it.
“Why?” Tony asked. “I told you I wouldn't be. And I knew you needed this. The way I figure, you two are gonna screw each other's brains out for a couple of months before the three of us can settle into a more equitable schedule.” He leaned forward to kiss Steve, but Bucky's metal hand was suddenly covering Steve's mouth. Tony looked at Bucky, who was staring him down. Tony didn't care. He called Bucky's bluff and leaned in anyway, kissing the back of Bucky's knuckle right over Steve's lips. “Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you can stand down, alright? We're supposed to be a throuple here.”
Steve pushed. “You pulled me from the river. Why?”
my personality. It's the rest of me you love. I mean it, though. We're not talking about some guy you met in a bar, alright? It's
with a
“Oh good, you know who I am. That means you know why I'm here.” At Tony's bidding, another piece of custom tech slithered into and over the man's mouth and nose. It wasn't suffocating him, just silencing him. Tony didn't care what the man might have to say. He leaned over the helpless man and reveled in the fear on his face. “Revenge just isn't as satisfying when your victim doesn't understand what's going on, wouldn't you agree, Commander?”
“Activating the Bucky Protocol.”
Bucky frowned and slowly sat up. “You want to have sex
Now that that was handled, and he had a better understanding of the people he was dealing with, Steve took a good look at how their seats were arranged. The fourth member of their team that was in the front row, on the other side of T'Challa in the position of importance closest to the center of the room, was Clint. Behind him was Tony, as far as he could get from Steve. Next to Tony was Vision, then Sam and Rhodey at the table behind him. The look on their faces showed that they'd figured it out, too.
When he showed them the book, Natasha joined him to summarize the content of the book. She returned to her seat immediately after.
“Tony, that's not fair.”
“Poly
“Yes, thank you,” the Commander repeated insincerely. “Don't forget the book.” He held his hand out to receive the Winter Soldier manual.
Tony's face lit up in a smile. “That's adorable.”
Steve's goal was to get Bucky inside, where he'd be safe and sound for the first time in over seventy years. The last thing he wanted to risk after everything that had happened was for Bucky to get scared off. “I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be.” Oh, Bucky so wanted to bolt; it was written all over his face. Steve preferred not to have to chase him down and tackle him, but he was willing to do so if needed. “But you're lying.”
“No, you won't,” Agent Ross said.
The outburst was worse this time, with a few “Wow”s and one, “Who
He objected when Tony told him that President Ellis wanted to sensationalize his return from being a prisoner of war, throw him a parade, pin a medal on him, and give him a medical discharge from the army. The parade posed a problem for Bucky. He'd been keeping a low profile for decades. Being the center of attention was a distant memory for him. He was also somewhat concerned that having his location over several hours scheduled and advertised weeks or months in advance would make him an easy target for anyone who wanted him dead.
Sam sighed dramatically. “Alright, but we better not go to jail for this!” He put down the pen and paper and rejoined his team.
“Once a-” Tony scoffed. “That's a lot! How come I don't know about this?!”
“Great,” Tony said. “He offered to shove his metal arm up my ass. You know how I love foreplay.”
“The UN doesn't want to pick a fight with us any more than we want to pick a fight with them,” Natasha pointed out. “I don't know that they'll accept Tony's idea, but they'll hear him out.”
wants this.”
am not an Avenger.” T'Challa suddenly cracked the Commander upside the head with the heavy iron phallus, then watched as the large man fell unconscious to the floor.
Natasha looked at Steve, not remotely embarrassed at the subject matter. “That's it, right? Every now and then you just need a...” she paused to phrase it delicately, “taste.” Despite her effort, Steve blushed and broke eye contact. “You hide it from Tony because you don't want to remind him that he can't satisfy you.”
Finally, there they were, large as life. They were sitting at Tony's table, and Tony had opened up the part of Bucky's arm that would have been his deltoid so he could inspect how it interfaced with his biological shoulder. He was poking around with some kind of tool.
Bucky smiled smugly. He patted Steve on the back. “Good job, Steve.”
Still nothing. The entire planet got to hear Bucky say, “That's too bad; Steve loves a dick in his ass.”
,” he pointed out, frustrated. “It's been three years. When the hell do you use it?”
And today? Well, the international news broadcast that he really enjoys receiving anal sex and that the serum has rendered his muscles so strong that it's unsafe for him to do so. Maybe life was telling him it was time to shed his hangups. He couldn't see himself telling Jimmy Kimmel or Conan O'Brien in front of a live studio audience the details of the time he 'almost broke [Tony's] dick off,' as Tony had so eloquently put it. But these were his closest friends. If there was going to be a place to start, it was with these people. “You wanna go there? Fine. No, Clint, I wasn't
"No, sweetheart, no. I thought you were."
It could've gone worse. Tony could certainly imagine.
Tony looked at Steve who just shrugged. "I think I'm good."
"I like your tie." Came a voice from below. Yes, Peter was there too.
"Is that so?" The elevator door opened and Tony pulled the kid out of it into his lab. He had already made sure to hide or keep out of a three year old's reach anything and everything dangerous.
There was a quick reply with two red heart emojis. Tony texted back to him.
"Yes. Story?" The hopeful brown eyes bored into him.
Tony visited Steve's home that day to surprise both of the boys only to find Steve crying.
, to make him want Tony as much as Tony wanted him. And he was ready to do whatever it took.
"I'm not." Whoever claimed that Tony was suave was probably pulling their hair out because Tony shook his head so heartily that Steve had to suppress a grin.
Tony smiled. "Not you, bud. I meant JARVIS."
Steve pulled out a mason jar from a cabinet. "Even a mason jar filled with raisin?" He raised his brow.
Steve turned and Tony thought 'fuck it' and jumped in, splashing Steve in the process. Peter laughed loudly, thinking he victoriously was devious. When Tony resurfaced, he splashed Steve some more, who tried to shield himself with his arms. Peter, finding joy in it, joined along, albeit with adorably small splashes as his arms couldn't quite reach the water from over the floaties and the tube around him.
"Still a three year old?"
Another couple of minutes passed when he heard a small voice coming from Steve.
Update next week. xx
He remembered Steve's smile, where else would he find something as mesmerizing. He's pretty sure Steve himself does not fully knew the power he possessed. He had Tony completely transfixed, all by doing a small and innocent act.
Tony was yet to find a flaw on that guy.
Steve was still standing at a distance, awkwardly. Tony looked at him. "What time is it?"
"What has gotten into? How dare you use the pure, innocent child for your own personal gain. I am repulsed and appalled."
"What can I say, I was really pretty as a teenager." Tony said, prideful. Half mocking and half actual pride.
"Stay put." Tony told Peter and got the plates, cups, and utensils out, setting them. "Syrup?"
"JARVIS, am I forgetting anything?"
"Daddy, which one?" Peter kicked his feet.
Tony looked at Peter and ruffled his hair. "Attaboy."
"I believe Mr Rogers said something about a bottle of warm milk, sir."
"What do we say, Petey?" Steve interrupted.
Tony had then realized. He knew where Steve was coming from.
Steve snorted at that and stepped up to Tony and bent down to kiss him firmly on the lips. He pulled back and whispered over his lips, "I'll thank you later."
But Tony had thought their relationship was solid after that. Tony bit back on his gifts with outrageous numbers on the receipts, and Steve seemed pleased by that. But now he was doubting that strategy.
"I'm not a sleepy head." Peter defended himself.
"Alright." Tony leaned down to kiss him again. "Rain check."
Steve, after a few seconds, sighed deeply. "Of course we are, honey."
Tony hated this.
"Fifteen seconds should do it, sir."
Tony got out of the car while Steve still stared out in confusion, and ran across to Steve's door, opening it for the man, who kind of jumped at the sudden movement on his side. Very confused.
While they had later talked about it, Tony telling Steve how he bought things for people he cares about,
"We have a line of people wanting to make money, Peps. Screw this guy and call the next one on the top of the list and arrange a meeting for after I come back. And didn't I tell you to take a few days off? Disobeying your boss's orders is not held cherishable in anyone's eyes."
He had a massive truck full of toys, clothes, and shoes be delivered to them. Every child got their things according to their own size and their own liking, Tony made sure of it. No one was to have something that didn't fit them, like some hand-me-down. These were brand new things. Tony never mentioned the price of any of it, always shrugged it off whenever questions about his charity donations came up. This all wasn't for him, it was for the kids.
When he woke up, not knowing for how long he had slept, he looked around. There was something weird in the room, something different, his dazed mind still a slave to the affects of sleep couldn't pinpoint. He grumbled sleepily and rolled over onto his stomach, stretching his arm across his massive bed.
"Steve?" To say Tony hated seeing Steve sad was an understatement.
"No, this needs to be talked about. Tony, you know I'm not rich. Far from it, actually. Hell, I'm a single father renting out a shitty apartment. What if you get tired of not receiving as much as you give and just call quits? What is it that you, Tony Stark, want from a below-ordinary guy like me? I just can't get it."
Surely, ten minutes later, Tony's eye widened. "That's him!"
When he came out, Steve wasn't in the room. Peter was still sleeping, the sheets tucking him in. He walked out the room, keeping the door open. He heard some noise from the kitchen and went there. Sure enough, there Steve was measuring the flour.
"A hyphen is a small mark that joins two words together. So his name is Dum with an E. Dum-E."
"Did I tell you that you look ravishing all wet yet?"
Tony brought him in for a kiss. He kissed his cheek, nose, eye lids and the lips again. "You are a gorgeous man. The most irresistible. The most stunning. The most beautiful man I have ever laid eyes on."
"Well, you have an awesome taste in clothing. The best, I must say."
"Loud and clear, sir."
"Until she did. Ten months after, she did. She was a part of us and she was gone. And I couldn't have her back. And I see her everyday. In Peter. The brown hair, the brown eyes, the way he smiles. Every day."
"Do I get to know the recipe?" Tony raised his eye brow, teasingly.
"I'm Steve." The other answered, shaking Tony's hand. A firm shake, Tony liked that. So Steve it is.
He placed Tony on the bed, climbed in with him and Tony kissed Steve slowly. "You sure about this, sweetheart? You're absolutely sure?"
They were safe together. They were happy together.
"Of course not! I thought we were going fine." The strained, small voice absolutely killed Tony.
One of the worst things he did was to ask Pepper for help, if he was honest. At first Pepper had seemed to be repulsed by his method of approach, albeit he would agree that it was rather foul play. But along the week, Pepper had taken over getting him to dress up for Saturday, just as Tony's initial request. He cursed the moment he made it.
Steve grinned at Tony and kissed him again. "Sit. Breakfast time." Completely ignoring Tony's words.
The dinner was amazing. The sauce was incredible, Tony could kiss Steve's hands for making it. And he would. The compliments did not cease throughout dinner and Steve was proud of it. Peter mentioned how his uncle Bucky loved his daddy's pasta too.
"You'll have two. You can pick the flavor."
"Sir, there is a call for you."
Steve stopped crying and pulled away, wiping his face. "Sorry about that-"
Tony pressed a light kiss on the crown of Steve's head and kept his lips pressed there.
Steve patted his pocket where his wallet was instinctively when Tony spoke up. "Well, Peter, we were just deciding if you'd be up for some ice cream."
Tony knew he was selling himself out, big time, but he just couldn't seem to stop himself. Restraint did not exist anymore for him, it seemed.
Tony fell back on his butt, right in front of Steve, sighing deeply. He looked around. "Where's Peter?"
"Then why are you lying?" Tony tilted his head, his face nothing but concerned. "C'mon, honey, you're scaring me. You gotta let me know what's wrong."
There might be some new work from me very soon so if you are interested, stay tuned.
"Tony? What is it?"
"Now show me what you got."
Tony took out the money from his wallet, was more than what one pretzel would cost, but he didn't care. He gave the money and took his snack. He heard the guy order one and he turned around to looked at him, pretzel in mouth, putting his wallet back. Which was definitely, definitely a bad idea.
"A hundred?" Peter looked at him wide eyes filled with awe.
Peter looked at Tony standing not far away and nodded. "Alright, sweetheart. Daddy loves you, alright? And I'll try to be back as soon as I can. I promise."
"May I kiss you? 'Cause I really want to."
"I'm sure of it. I mean who can resist me."
Tony then proceeded by kissing Steve's neck as the other man walked as quickly as he could without bumping Tony into anything or tripping. Once they reached their room, Tony pushed the door close with his hand, never moving his lips away from Steve's skin.
Tony's eyebrows raised and his gazed flashed up the Steven, whose eyes widen as he glanced at Tony then back at the child. This time in a scolding manner. Tony chewed hastily.
"I make some mean pancakes."
The coffee was done and he poured himself a cup full of it, drinking almost instantly, not minding the burn.
Steve chuckled and got further away. "Stop. I'm disgusting."
Tony understood just fine and he coaxed Steve into it. "C'mon. I gave you my word. It's no a problem for me. Tell him, Peter."
"I know. But I want our first time to be perfect. It won't be if you have any doubts."
Tony's expressions softened. "Steve, this isn't that. I don't want all this back from you. I am doing this because I want to. I want to give it to you, I want you to enjoy yourself. I'm not doing this and expecting things in return, I'm doing this because I can and I simply want to. I want you to be happy and have a good time."
"Look, Tony, Mr. Samberg wanted it like this. And you need to make up for what you did at his party two months ago. Just do it. It would take only an hour."
"Well look who's talking." Tony found his voice. He was very sure to watch the blush creep through Steve's pale skin.
So Tony sat back on his chair, watching Peter treat Dum-E like a pet dog, throwing the ball Tony had kept there for him, and Dum-E happily obliging. He had to stop Peter from climbing the bot a few times, Dum-E had to grab the child from the back of his shirt and lifting him away and to the floor after Tony's order of 'no climbing'. Good bot.
"Can you make me one?"
The elevator started moving and soon enough the doors opened. Pepper pulled Tony to his room and pushed him into the bathroom. "Get clean, now. I'm taking your clothes to wear out."
"There are a million things I don't need to see but this isn't one of them. Do I like seeing you like this? It's breaking me. Do I not want to be here? Absolutely wrong. I'm your boyfriend, I love you. And I'm not gonna leave until you're alright."
"Yes, I am very sure. Peter is fine with me. And I've got JARVIS to help me. Tell 'im, J."
He felt Steve adjust his own hand to have his fingers wrap around Tony's, adding a soft pressure. "I am. I definitely am. I'm also sorry for doubting you earlier."
"We'll arrange another movie night where you don't walk out."
"Will you help me dress up for next Saturday?" Tony yelled after Pepper.
"That should be me." Tony had said when he texted Steve so the latter could get his number. Steve had seemed hesitant while taking out his phone at first, patting the pocket with a tense smile on his face. Peter had thankfully gained Tony's attention at that point, asking the man about the next time he'll meet him, because apparently he had somewhat won the kid's heart.
"Yes, please."
"You're really not gonna tell me where we're going?"
"Play the movie, JARVIS."
"Often enough." Tony made a mental note of that as Steve sat beside his son and told JARVIS to pause the movie. "Petey, I have to go to work." He saw Peter's face becoming sad. "I know it's really unfair because it was our night, right? But I promise I'll make it up to you later. Okay, honey? Will you be okay staying here with Tony?"
"Mhmm." Tony nodded.
"Buck told me I should've played dead."
Soon dessert was brought over. Thanks to Peter clearly stating Steve having a sweet tooth, Tony made sure not to listen to his denials. And he was glad that he didn't because Steve ended up eating it all up, despite his previous refusal.
Tony huffed out a laugh. "Yeah, well. I saw you too. Kinda hard to miss a guy with beauty like that."
"Tony-"
"I'm a hundred percent certain, Steve. And it's no problem for me. I'm sure you probably figured that out already." He mumbled the last bit Peter wouldn't understand.
"You just... You just seemed...baby," Tony cupped Steve's face. He caused that miserable look on there. Had he just kept his stupid mouth shut. "Darling, I don't want to break up. You're the best thing to ever happen to me, why on earth would I want you to leave?"
The blush flooded Steve face as he tried to control his wide smile. "I love you too."
"A story, huh?"
"She didn't even get to see Peter turn one."
"How often does this happen exactly?" Tony followed Steve to where Peter was still watching the movie.
"That's where I step in. These are to die for."
He knew he should've kept the gifts going. He knew it. Maybe Steve was testing him? Seems absurd to think about it but maybe it is so. No, Steve wasn't that kind of a person.
Peter nodded and with a mouth full shouted, "Please play, JARVIS!" Just like he'd seen Tony do it a few times but his father's words about being kind not alien to him. JARVIS listened silently and the movie started.
Happy gave a nod of acknowledgment and the car started moving.
"Your blood pressure seems to be normal, sir. Although your heart is beating faster than regular. Should I sugge-?"
looked at it. All soft and pretty. The tint of pink always there, the pale neck stretching down that he just loved to kiss every chance he got. He saw the blue eyes,
"You'd've loved her. And she would've loved you."
But Tony didn't let that bring his spirits down. He was willing to woo Steve, that's right,
"I can see that, J. Thank you for the insight." He looked at Steve and mouthed a sorry. Steve just shook his head, with an amused face. Tony looked at Peter and sighed. "You figured out what you wanna watch, Petey?"
"You wore a dress?" Peter asked, all curious and innocent. God, this kid was too adorable for his own good.
"That kid of yours really loves his movies, doesn't he?"
Peter nodded like before and Tony opened the book to the first page. Peter rolled to be snuggled into Tony and who was he to say anything against that. Tony made sure to secure the other end and the foot of the bed with pillows, to guard Peter from rolling over while sleeping, before he pulled him into his arms and started reading slowly and in a very hushed voice.
Tony had introduced them both to JARVIS a few dates ago so it was much more calming than the last time. Peter wouldn't stop bawling when he couldn't join a face to the loud voice seeming to come from nowhere. Steve had profusely apologized to Tony and JARVIS, which they both considered unnecessary. Although he didn't get who or what JARVIS was, Peter had grown familiar to the voice, enough to not get scared every time the AI spoke.
"Tony." Steve said firmly this time. "That is literally, without a doubt in mind or heart, definitely the biggest thing you can possibly say to me." When Tony opened his mouth to argue, Steve spoke. "The biggest. I mean it, darling. The biggest."
"Everything okay, boss?" He heard Happy ask.
"Oh, sweetheart, I'm nothing compared to you." He kissed Steve's neck, and what a beautiful neck it was. "Let me show you."
"Welcome back, sir. How were the kids?" Came a British accent. JARVIS was his AI. The closest thing Tony had to a family. Closer than what even Pepper was to him.
"See? I've got J and I know enough myself." No, he did not. "So don't worry and get to your asshole of a boss who doesn't have any compulsion of being rational."
"No sudden movements, Dum-E." Tony warned.
One thing about Peter was that he loved staying over when Steve had long shifts and Bucky wasn't able to babysit him. With Steve's permission, he decided to take the kid to his lab and have him meet someone really special to Tony. Though the man would never outright claim it to be so.
Steve squinted. “Your plan is... polygamy?”
“You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.” Bucky's voice was flat, but his face betrayed his emotional state. He looked at Steve as he spoke to him but didn't meet his eyes.
Before T'Challa could answer, the apparent tac team leader responded in a thick Russian accent. “Oh that's not just any metal, that's
smart,” Steve argued. “Those Winter Soldiers are incredibly dangerous. If even one of them gets away, that can have severe and lasting political or economic consequences for the entire planet. At the very least, we should be on site ready to assist if things go sideways. Suit up, guys. If we hurry, we can catch up to them.”
“Mr. Stark has stocked the bottom drawer of Mr. Barnes' right nightstand with a variety of personal lubricants.”
Bucky's expression was unreadable, but Steve's jaw dropped as if he'd been hurt. He seemed like he was about to say something.
Without diplomacy, Tony asked, “Who do I yell at for sending a Sokovian spy to my house?”
“You think I haven't already taken care of that?”
Bucky was surprised; Steve was not. Steve had received a similar, though larger, backpay check shortly after he woke up from the ice.
Ross started in on them right away. “What is this I hear that none of you have responded to the Sokovia Accords yet? You were expected to-” He stopped suddenly when his eyes landed on Bucky. All the blood drained from his face. He sputtered for a second before being able to actually form words. “This is outrageous! Have you all lost your goddamn minds?!” he exclaimed. “The Winter Soldier is a massive threat to national security and you just let him in the same room as the Secretary of State.”
touch Steve again, I will be back. And all the armies on the planet won't be able to save you.”
Steve and Tony lingered by the door while the drone showed Bucky around and explained the suite's high-tech automated features. “Do you really think you need to wear your suit?” Steve asked.
“I cannot pretend that they have not made mistakes in those four years. Unfortunately, some grievous and public mistakes have found them in a precarious situation. It is no secret that they need to regain the trust of the international community if they wish to continue their quest to rid the world of the scourge known as HYDRA. I have sat here and watched you take advantage of this situation.
Bucky loved to tease Steve. He had been waiting for his irritation to flare before giving him what he wanted, sliding inside him easily and fully while Steve was distracted by his own complaint. Normally-silent Steve groaned like a man taking his first sip of icy water after trekking a hundred miles through the desert. His eyelids fluttered nearly closed and his eyes lost focus, but he kept them fixed on Bucky's face.
The Commander still had that shitty smile on his face, but he did move on. “Mr. Barton, would you care to tell us what you know?”
“Huh?” Bucky asked sleepily.
“I was going to say 'acquired taste.'”
Vision came up to the door and just phased his face through to see what was going on. When he emerged, he said, “The tactical team and all four security guards are on the floor. They appear to be dead. The Winter Soldiers are just standing at the front of the chamber, unarmed. None of the politicians appear to be injured.”
“Jesus H. Christ,” Clint exclaimed over his breakfast, mirroring everyone's feelings about the situation.
Eventually, Steve took Bucky's hand and placed it over his own cock, silently encouraging him help him finish this. Bucky picked up what he'd attempted to do when they first started. He stroked Steve along to Steve's slow pace. He quickened when Steve did. Finally, Steve stopped moving abruptly as he cummed over Bucky's belly and hand.
“You should be grateful to Steve. I personally wouldn't lose any sleep from killing you in your hospital bed. Steve? Well, he'd be upset with me if you turned up with a convenient case of the deads. That's why all I gave you was naloxone. It's not going to harm you, just negate your morphine for about ninety minutes.” Which was why he added it to both IV bags: to make it last. “You deserved the skull fracture T'challa gave you, and you deserve to feel it.”
Steve stepped aside and opened the door wide to allow him through. “Come in.” He closed the door behind Agent Ross and told him, “Tony just got to sleep, though, so we've been trying to keep it down.”
It was just force of habit that made him quip, “Only if I ask nicely,” with a wink. He was pleased at the spattering of laughs he earned until he got a look at Steve, mouth agape in a sadly betrayed expression. “Shit,” he muttered, realizing he fucked up. “I'm kidding. I take it back. Where are you getting this?”
He added another pump of the lube to his fingers and leaned down, reaching his hand under Steve. He had just started massaging the oil over Steve's tight hole when he caught Steve watching him. It was arousing but odd. Patchy as some of his memories were, they all showed Steve lying back, eyes closed, feeling what Bucky did to him instead of watching him do it.
“I'm afraid I cannot grant you access to this room at this time,” the security guard repeated.
“I know, I just... I can't feel you inside me anymore.”
Tony cupped the side of Steve's face delicately. He said, “I know,” with a smile, then left.
“A week ago, you would not have dared to treat them so poorly. But today, you know that the Avengers are not at liberty to defend themselves from your discourtesy. To do so would put their very freedom at risk. But I'm afraid you've been so focused on sexually harassing Captain Rogers that you've overlooked something very important.”
As cute as Bucky thought that was, his dick didn't agree. “Steve. My dick is not your ass-pacifier.”
“BECAUSE I'LL LOSE,” Tony snapped.
got Bucky back; he couldn't lose him to a witch hunt now.
Bucky also understood that this was all going to happen quickly in order to be done on time. Full of new information and plenty of anxiety, Bucky went off with Steve so they could read the updated Sokovia Accords like everyone else.
“Hm?”
No one argued, and Tony took that to mean he should go ahead.
He took a look at the medical setup. His IV line was connected to two sources: a bag of saline and a analgesia machine with morphine locked inside. The bag of saline was nearly empty, and there was a fresh bag next to it for the oncoming nurse to easily hook up. How fortuitous for Tony. He removed a pre-filled syringe from the bag he carried and injected some of its contents into the running bag of saline and the rest of it into the fresh bag. He disposed of it in the sharps container.
Steve laughed. “Thanks?”
Tony looked between Wanda and Bucky. “Are you wearing matching bracelets?”
Bucky shook his head again, desperately. “You don't understand. As long as anyone knows those words, I'm not safe, and no one is safe
It was morning.
Ross was white as a sheet: paler even than when he'd first seen Bucky. He may or may not have lacked faith in the Avengers' ability to protect him, but he definitely lacked confidence in their desire to do so.
Everyone was quiet while that sank in. Even though half the team was for signing the Accords, everyone was on the same page about Bucky: they may not know him, but they knew what he'd been through, and they wanted to see him continue to get better and finally have the chance to live his life. What to do, what to do?
Tony looked at Steve, then just behind him at Bucky, then back at Steve. He smiled knowingly. “Feel better?” he asked.
“Where were we?” Tony looked around the room. “Ah, yes. Everyone was going to read my version of the Accords; we'll fine-tune it after dinner. Dismissed.” As everybody got up to leave – for real this time – Tony kept Steve and Bucky back.
Tony smiled sadly at his fiancé. “You'd have married him, if you could have. Correct me if I'm wrong, which, you know, I'm not.” Tony gave Steve the chance to argue, then continued. “You had something of a life together in the thirties and forties, but at the time, you weren't really allowed. Then he died, then you died, then you woke up and he was still dead. Then two years ago you find out he's not dead, but his mind wasn't right. And now his mind is healing and he finally remembers he loves you, and you could even marry him if you want to, and... I'm all that's left standing in your way.”
Bucky stared miserably at nothing. Steve's heart broke. He closed the distance between them, put his arms around Bucky, and just held him for the first time since 1944. Bucky hid his face in Steve's neck and breathed in his scent. It took about a minute but Bucky eventually relaxed into the hug, sighing. Steve tried not to dwell on what Tony must have been thinking.
Suddenly, there was noise and fire and screaming and the camera was on the floor shooting a patch of carpet. Movement was visible in the form of wisps of smoke, falling debris, and scattering feet. It was clear that there had been an explosion.
Steve let his murderous gaze linger for just a moment longer on the Commander before meeting T'Challa's eye. T'Challa nodded slightly, and Steve found that he trusted him to do as he said. Steve decided to give T'Challa a chance. He backed up slowly, then stood there a few feet away with his arms crossed and his eyes fixed on the Commander.
Tony's whole body flinched, a deliberate exaggeration of shock, no doubt. He looked around the room dramatically as if he were expecting an audience to share in his surprise. “You
Steve and Tony thanked him and led the way to the four empty tables on the right. They noticed that their seating had been unnecessarily assigned, with little name cards at each chair. They were tempted to just sit wherever they wanted, but they seemed to telepathically come to the conclusion that it wasn't worth making waves over a seating chart.
T'Challa had wanted to interrogate him, but the Avengers had a better plan. Wanda Maximoff was languishing inside the compound bored to tears; might as well give her something to do, like read this asshole's mind. They had texted her when they came up with the plan, and she and Bucky passed Sam and Clint on the landing pad.
“I know.” Bucky kissed Steve on the cheek. “I missed you, too.” He felt like Steve was calming, so he loosened his grip on Steve's arms. He continued to hold Steve tightly, but not to restrain him.
Steve didn't suffer from insomnia; he just didn't get tired as quickly as normal people and slept a full night every third night. This was Steve's night to sleep. Tony said he'd be alright by himself without Steve's help, and Steve and Bucky fell asleep in Bucky's bed together.
Everybody's mood was softened when the President started defending Bucky. Bucky's jaw dropped. He had assumed that pretty much every authority figure on the planet would have it out for him.
Bucky stood so quickly from his chair that it was violently flung into the wall behind him, cracking the smart glass and silencing the room. He stared down Secretary Ross, clenching and unclenching his metal fist at his side and breathing heavily through his nose. His menacing body language was somewhat undermined by his Captain America pajama set and the feminine side braid that Natasha had done for him.
Bucky's jaw dropped. “What? I don't want to hurt you.”
,” T'Challa added.
Steve, Bucky, and Tony followed the drone to a room Steve had previously believed to be empty. The room's décor didn't have a lot of personality, but it did have several large digital picture frames, all of which apparently rotated different pictures of Steve. There was one poster-sized group picture of the Howling Commandos above the headboard.
“This isn't your call. Let me remind you: you're Captain
Also like everyone else, they managed to agree that Tony had covered the concerns they'd expressed and that this document should be sent to the UN for review.
She narrowed her eyes at him doubtfully.
him to.”
Steve scowled at Tony. “Not at
Natasha used her most intimidating expression to look at Bucky, her arm, and Bucky again. When he reluctantly released her, she said, “We have to go back to Vienna. We have the bomber, intel, and evidence that we have to turn over.”
Bucky sighed. “The most elite death squad: more kills than anyone in the HYDRA history, and that was before the serum. They speak thirty languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize... they can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.”
Natasha asked, “How long has it been since you deloused your mustache?”
The Quinjet landed just as Steve received a text from Tony saying that he was leaving Vienna and would be home in a few hours. Everyone headed past Bucky, who was waiting expectantly for Steve, and into the compound.
my idea;
“Wasn't there something else?” Tony nudged.
“First point. I was saying yesterday that we need to be put in check. I still firmly believe that. The Sokovia Accords would do that. I also still believe that if we don't work with the UN, this,” he gestured to the Sokovia Accords, “is going to be done
Wanda shrugged. “I'd survive.” She sipped from a coffee cup, leaning back in her chair.
Steve looked sympathetic. “We don't know yet, but Wanda'll get it out of him. Just give her a minute.”
After about one minute, Wanda came back out of the jet. “He wants to know where you and the other Winter Soldiers were kept in Siberia,” she said. She glanced at Tony.
Steve has a big heart, and there's room enough for both of us, I think.”
Tony choked, absolutely horrified that he had just aired that on the international news. “
They both looked toward the ceiling while listening to FRIDAY's unexpected interjection. Then they looked at each other, confused, surprised, and a little disturbed by FRIDAY invading their privacy. They got over it quickly.
“Yeah, hold on.” There were some distant noises and voices before Bucky spoke again. “Alright, you're on speaker phone.”
Tony had one more thing to say before he left Steve and Bucky alone, but struggled to find the right way to say it. “Hon?”
Even though it was mostly Steve's effort, Bucky felt pretty self-satisfied with how much more time they spent having sex than those frantic twelve seconds. “How long was
Steve had hoped this was coming. At first, he leaned gently into the kiss. Three and a half years of dating a non-enhanced person had trained him the hard way to be very careful. But Tony and Bucky felt, tasted, and smelled exactly nothing alike. Despite the metal arm and long hair, the kiss was classic Bucky. It unearthed decades-old emotions and memories and reminded him that Bucky didn't need to be handled with kid gloves.
Vision phased through the exterior wall and landed on the carpet. He had an update. “Captain, the tactical team has returned with the Winter Soldiers.”
“Hey, Ross, my buddy Matt wants to talk to you for a second,” he announced obnoxiously. He tossed his phone carelessly onto the conference table, and before Ross could ask who the fuck 'his buddy Matt' was, out of the phone popped a ½ scale 3D hologram of the President of the United States, Matthew Ellis.
“Your fiancé got us lube?” Bucky asked with a laugh. Bucky escaped Steve's hold and leaned over to open the drawer. He pulled a handful of small, brightly colored plastic tubes from the drawer and set them on the bed next to Steve. He pulled out a second handful and a third. He marveled at the oversized collection threatening to spill onto the floor. “Your fiancé got us
Steve shrugged and planted more kisses down Bucky's shin. What he wanted was to explore and memorize every inch of Bucky's body. He had him memorized by 1944, but surely he's picked up some new marks. He trailed his lips methodically over Bucky's skin, kissing and licking every mark he came across, old and new. He moved down to the foot, up the back and side of the leg, up his flank and torso, then to the hand and back.
Bucky looked at his bracelet and mentally kicked himself for drawing attention to it. “Wanda called them 'friendship bracelets.'”
“Things,'” Tony repeated to Natasha, sounding just a little bitter. “I'm known for two things – genius inventions and having a high sex drive – and I fell in love with a man who can't even say the phrase, 'sex toy.'” He turned to Steve. “What do you care? It's not like you use it.”
He wore a disguise that included a high-tech facial prosthesis, a fair-colored wig, scrubs, and a lab coat. His lab coat bore a forged badge that identified him as the hospital employee his research suggested would be least likely to be recognized or stopped.
Well, Tony had an answer for that. “Which brings me to my third point. I spent much of yesterday and last night drafting a counter-proposal to the Sokovia Accords. I've uploaded it onto your personal screens for reading. I think it's both reasonable and efficient for both sides and addresses key issues.
Suddenly, the screen went dark with a loud mechanical
Steve snuggled in closer to Bucky, his breath hot on the side of Bucky's neck. “I'm not ready to be done. I love how you feel inside me.”
cuddling with Bucky.”
Bucky felt so close, but he patiently waited for Steve to start riding him again so he could finish, as well... except Steve didn't start riding him again. Steve curled up and lay on top of Bucky as if he were going to go to sleep then and there with Bucky's hard cock inside of him. “Steve?” Bucky asked.
Natasha began reading it out loud, “Steve loves a-
Rhodey was dumbfounded. “Wait. You're saying that the tac team is leading all five Winter Soldiers into the United Nations assembly room, where they will be unrestrained and alone with the UN and the eleven idiots who thought this was a good idea?”
The man, who may or may not have spoken English, stared at him in horror.
Secretary Ross walked into the room without so much as knocking.
Steve smiled at Tony being classic Tony. “Tony will take any vaguely sexual threat as flirting. And just for the record, he's insatiable, adventurous, and completely shameless, so he'd probably actually like that.”
It would have been well within Steve's skill set to single-handedly disarm both guards and kick the door in, but he decided against it. Damn Accords. “Everyone in that room is in danger,” Steve insisted.
“Don't be like that.”
“Well, our new housemate is a mentally unstable super-soldier with a robot arm, and I'm the frail, non-enhanced human that's sleeping with his boyfriend. Yeah, I'm gonna wear the suit for a while.”
getting blamed for this?” Rhodey asked, annoyed.
, remember?” He continued to shout to be heard as he gestured to the politicians and bureaucrats in the room. “They don't want us to 'interfere' without authorization.”
Steve and Tony were curled up together on one of the sofas watching a popular TV series that had been on Steve's list for a while. Steve had been watching it most of the night while Vision patrolled the facility, monitoring for the tac team's return. Tony had joined Steve a couple hours before dawn.
, alright? Not Captain
King T'Challa stopped him with a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Please, Captain. Allow me to handle this.”
King T'Chaka of Wakanda was giving quite the inspirational speech when the unthinkable happened. “When a stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we, in Wakanda, were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria were part of a good will mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for working with the international community in this initiative. Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.”
“There was a bomb in a van that was parked on the street across from the building. Wakanda's King T'Chaka is the only confirmed fatality from the blast so far,” Natasha explained. “We were just told that there's surveillance footage of the bomber putting the bomb in the van early this morning. We're about to get a look at it.”
Back before the serum, he'd be able to do a bit more from this position. He had been short enough to ride Bucky and reach Bucky's chest with his mouth at the same time. Now that he was even taller than Bucky, he had to curl up on himself just to kiss Bucky on the lips. Bucky's chest would have to settle for Steve's hand or wait until they were done.
By all means: kiss him, cuddle him, lie next to him and just watch him sleep. Sew your hand to his because if he decides to fall off another train, he's gonna have to take you with him. I promise you my feelings are not going to be hurt, and I refuse to be jealous of a guy who's spent seventy years enslaved to the most evil organization in modern history.”
Everyone stopped abruptly. They kept their eyes on the Soldiers but paid attention to Sam. Was there a trap that he'd spotted that everyone else had missed?
There was a noise from the back of the Quinjet. Everyone turned to look for the source and saw King T'Challa standing there wearing black body armor and holding a catlike helmet and a large suitcase. He eyed all three of them with suspicion. “I'm interrupting something.”
Vision said, “I suspect if you ask nicely, Sergeant Barnes could actually improve the state of national security.”
Sam answered for him, “About sixty-six years.”
Steve covered the lower half of his face with his hands. His eyes were glued to the screen like passersby unable to avert their gazes from a gruesome accident. Tony activated his phone so that he could use the software on there to manually override the screen instead of relying on FRIDAY. He may have been literally the best hacker on the planet, but his fingers could only press buttons so fast.
.” Bucky could hardly believe it when Steve actually started grinding against him. It was undignified, especially for someone like Steve. He was determined to put a stop to it. He put his arms around Steve, but instead of what Steve wanted, he grabbed Steve's wrists and forcefully pinned Steve's arms to his chest. Bucky held him tightly as Steve squirmed in frustration.
Steve turned around to face Tony. “As I was saying, if the UN finds out-”
Tony scowled, but he pressed a few buttons and stuck his phone in his pocket. “Fine.”
Winter Soldiers?”
“I'll let you go when you calm down. Now just... take a deep breath.”
Steve gave T'Challa a respectful nod.
Wanda smiled.
“Yeah, and the UN supplied the king. How are
Steve laughed at the old pet name. He found the strength to keep walking. “How are you doing? You look a lot better.”
Footage-Tony continued the conversation: “No shit. He broke three of my fingers and a few toys before I invented a-”
“Romanoff...” Tony warned.
“This is going to sound weird, but hear me out.”
Tony's phone beeped. “Oh, look at that. Got two whole, two partial... and a palm print! If this guy put his grubby mitts all over any crime scene in the world, I'll know about it in the next few days.”
Bucky squinted at Tony, not trying even a little to hide the judgment.
issue within the purview of the United Nations. They've tasked their own experts with this mission, and those experts, who have decades of training and experience, have determined you guys to be unnecessary to said mission.
The representative paused in thought. “That is a good explanation.”
“Buck, is Wanda with you? We have an update on the situation here.”
Steve laid his head backwards on Bucky's shoulder. “I missed you,” he admitted. “I was so worried.”
“Hey, Steve.”
Natasha put her phone away and joined Tony in the cockpit. “Seeing as Steve's not mad, I do have a question: what'd you invent?”
The issue taken care of, the Avengers settled in for the evening. Steve knew Tony had been up all last night, so after a quick bite to eat, Steve took Tony by the hand into the suite's master bedroom. After they were both washed up and Tony was sound asleep, Steve threw on a tank top and sleep pants and joined the rest of the team relaxing in the living area. The team looked up at him and smiled in unison when he emerged from the master bedroom. It was a little creepy. He assumed they were trying to be extra nice because of the shit day they knew he'd had.
“That is enough, Commander,” T'Challa interjected while the Avengers stared the man down. “You forget they are here to assist you in apprehending five dangerous individuals. Listen to their intel, and then we can all go while you stay behind as late as you like formulating your plan. It has been a
“And that plan involves me cuddling with Bucky?”
“Any port in a storm?”
“He's not a threat to national security,” Steve insisted, sounding offended.
Bucky's face had been nearly blank since he'd arrived, but now it fell in sorrow. His lip quivered. He didn't cry, but he looked like he could. “Alright,” he said.
Ellis crossed his arms. “Tony tells me you’ve invited yourself into the Avengers compound, disregarded protocol, and are currently disrespecting one of our last veterans from World Word II: the American who survived the longest as a prisoner of war.”
Despite the behavior of the tac team members, Clint was able to make the Avengers smile. T'Challa, while he appreciated what Clint was doing, wanted to turn in for the night and moved things along. “Captain Rogers, would you please present your intel to the room so we can be done?”
Clint finished, “You wouldn't like him when he's angry.”
Vision pointed out, “In our defense, that commando supplied the dildo.”
After accepting the kiss, Tony realized how late it had gotten and started wrapping up what he was doing. “We've been bonding.”
“Yeah, you don't want to make him angry.” Clint added.
He stepped into the Iron Man suit that showed up, flew out the window, and headed to catch up to Steve and the rest of the team.
They were nearly to the compound, anyway, so they landed to refuel and interrogate Bucky about Zemo. Sam and Clint went to raid the kitchen for the trip back to Vienna; everyone else stayed on the Quinjet.
“It was
Bucky knew Steve was being far too loud. He hadn't even grazed his prostate when he slid inside him. This was not going to last long for either of them; after seven decades and the way Steve moaned in his face, Bucky was in no more of an enduring state than Steve was. Bucky pulled back, adjusted the angle of his hips, and pushed back in. He was rewarded with a softer, higher-pitched, breathy sigh when he brushed Steve's prostate.
“By the way,” Tony remembered to mention, “I invited the King of Wakanda to join us until we caught the bomber.”
“Does Steve hurt you?” she shouted.
Their contact informed them, “I will be waiting just outside to show you to your suite after the briefing.”
“Oh yeah?” Sam asked. “What's that?” He'd picked up on the attitude, too, it seemed.
The UN appointed Ruth Bat Seraph, a female ex-Mossad agent, and Shang-Chi, a male Kung Fu expert who was the son and adversary of a notorious Chinese war criminal.
“He doesn't need a play-by-play,” Steve interrupted, embarrassed by the details and not wanting anyone else to know.
The Avengers all looked at the journalist as she held out a thin stack of photos. Rhodey took them from her and brought them to Tony.
of his friends would kick his ass. But today, Steve was determined to take the high road, which meant placing the book in that bigoted prick's hand. He took the two steps necessary and handed him the book.
“He's right,” Agent Ross agreed. “The details are moot because they just left for Siberia without you. They said they didn't trust you guys to have their backs.”
“That's a matter for UN security,” the guard said, indicating himself and his coworker.
Tony swiped something on his phone, and suddenly Bucky was on the screens in the room: his SSR facesheet, personal history, even parts of his Hydra Winter Soldier file. “You might recall Sergeant Barnes showing up yesterday. We all know his history. From what I can tell, he's feeling a lot more himself since escaping Hydra two years ago. Now, everyone in this room understands that the things Hydra forced him to do are not his fault. The politicians and bureaucrats in the UN?” Tony shook his head. “The way the Accords are written, they could send a squad of JSOC guys to the compound to string him up for his Hydra days, and we would have no legal recourse. And to be honest, I don't trust them not to do that.”
“You lasted twelve seconds from penetration to orgasm,” FRIDAY announced.
“Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva was found dead a couple hours ago in a Berlin hotel room. The police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes. Facial recognition identified the fake doctor as Colonel Helmut Zemo. Sokovian intelligence. Zemo ran EKO Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.” There were three different images of Colonel Zemo; it was the man in their midst.
“I don't complain!” Steve protested.
“Yeah. Sure.” Tony headed to the pilot's chair to look busy.
Bucky laughed smugly. He pulled his fingers out of Steve, enjoying how Steve involuntarily bucked his hips at the loss. Seems Steve didn't learn any patience in the last seventy years. He crawled up Steve's body to ensure they were aligned. Bucky folded Steve's right leg out of the way, giving his own left knee space under Steve's thigh to find a little leverage. Steve seemed determined to maintain eye contact, and Bucky was happy to oblige.
“I guess I don't have to share him, after all. LOL”
When they arrived at the doors to the room, they were stopped by two uniformed security guards. “I'm afraid you do not have authorization to access this room at this time,” one of them said.
Tony's eyebrows shot up nearly to his hairline. “Two and a half. Really.” He grinned at Steve. “Good for you,” he said sincerely.
Bucky understood that the parade was, unfortunately, part of the quid pro quo. The president didn't need to get so personally involved, he didn't have to pull any strings or call in any favors, nor did he have to publicly support him. In return for his help, the president hoped to create a celebrity status for Bucky, then use that status to boost the number of votes he would get during this year's November election.
There was a knock on the door. Tony called out to him from the hallway. Steve was about to respond that he'd be there in just a minute, then get up and get dressed. Bucky beat him to the punch. He invited Tony in without letting go of Steve.
,” Steve scolded.
Once it was hard and slick enough, Steve went from kneeling between Bucky's thighs to straddling his hips. He leaned down as if he were going to kiss Bucky's lips, but he stopped short. They shared the air an inch apart, breaths merging in hot little anticipatory gasps. Steve braced his right hand on the headboard and pushed back slightly until he felt the head of Bucky's penis against his underside. He shifted slightly so that it was lined up properly, then pushed back the rest of the way so that Bucky was fully inside of him.
Later that day, Tony held a press conference to introduce the new members of the Avengers. The UN had selected their two appointees quickly, and Tony thought that would be a good a time as any to add three other people he'd had his eye on.
“It feels like you're about to cum.”
“No, he hasn't said so, no,” Tony agreed. “The idea of non-monogamy as anything other than 'cheating' is new to him, conflicts with what he's understood all his life to be proper social order. He feels guilty for loving both of us. But Steve's nothing if not adaptable, and he has an incentive to adapt, doesn't he? All he's wanted since 1944 is to have you back in his life, but if you'll notice, he hasn't smiled once since you arrived. You know why? It's because he believes he's going to have to lose one of us to keep the other. It's Sophie's choice. You, and only you, have the power to save him from having to make that choice.”
Tony reentered the room and caught Bucky before he got out. “You're gonna wanna see this; trust me.” He winked at Bucky and walked up to the table to the right of Steve.
“It's
The team exchanged harsh looks and hushed words briefly before coming to the consensus that they didn't want
Natasha cocked her head. “Oh, I was,” she admitted with a shameless shrug. Then she looked behind him. “Tony, what are you doing?”
A few emotions rapidly made their way across Steve's face. First confusion, then surprise, then indignation. “Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you're....” Steve trailed off, unable to finish the sentence as Tony was shaking his head. “So it turns out
Tony would have to buy or make something very nice for Clint. He looked at Steve to see his reaction. Steve was
“Who were they?” Steve asked.
Natasha interjected again. “I just have a quick, unrelated question. How long can you hold your breath?”
Steve readily accepted Bucky's answer because he felt the same way. He went back to kissing Bucky. He must have been kissing Bucky a bit too enthusiastically, because Bucky ended up backpedaling a bit as they both fumbled to undo each other's pants. Steve had to follow in order to maintain the kiss. He resembled a hungry kitten chasing a half-empty can of tuna around the kitchen floor.
“Hm?”
Natasha gave him a small nod: a promise not to do anything that would make their situation with the UN worse. She turned to T'Challa, whose assigned seat was to her left, and placed it on the table in front of him. “Tell me, Your Highness, in your experience as a member of the United Nations, are metal dildos standard party favors for tac team briefings?”
Steve narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “You're being very rational about this.”
“Well I-” Bucky pulled back suddenly. “Shit. I don't have any lube.”
Tony looked surprised. “The
With Steve's eyes on him, Bucky found it impossible to look away. He massaged the lube into Steve's hole in little circles, increasing the pressure in tiny increments until his finger slid into Steve to the first knuckle. Bucky loved how Steve went from gnawing on his lower lip to licking his lips and clutching the bedspread. He picked up the pace. He moved his finger in a growing circle until he had space for another, then moved them the same way until he could add a third. He pushed them in until he could tell he'd found the prostate by the way Steve's whole body twitched, his grip on the bedspread tightened, and his dick jumped.
“Exactly how long have you people been
Tony smiled that big, fake smile he created for business dealings. “We would be honored for you to join us, Your Highness.”
Tony addressed Bucky directly. “I'm
That's okay, because Bucky had his back, as always. “Yeah, he feels about two and a half hours better.”
“Tony, I'm not-”
They lingered near the bedroom door in silence for a few minutes before Tony said, “I have some things I need to get done. Stay with Barnes. Show him around, help him get settled in... order him some food. He's probably exhausted; I figure he'll eat and then sleep. The Accords can wait until tomorrow.”
“Thank you for your most thorough report, Captain,” T'Challa said, knowing that none of the tac team members would show him any respect.
Since the Winter Soldiers were unarmed and outnumbered – and lacked the element of surprise – the Avengers made quick work of them. The were all in custody and no longer resisting within sixty seconds. One of the UN's other tactical teams showed up with heavy duty restraints and containment vehicles to transfer them to some maximum security prison in the middle of the ocean.
Steve was about to point out that he and Tony kept plenty in their room, but before he could say so, FRIDAY announced to them:
“Bet this metal arm comes in handy, though,” Bucky speculated.
us, whether we like it or not.”
shutting-down noise. Steve and Tony looked toward the back of the room where the projector was installed. The cable leading to the projector was sliced clean through. A couple feet away, embedded in the wall, was a solitary arrow. Steve and Tony looked at Clint, who had his bow in his hands.
T'Challa knew where Tony was going with this. “As King of Wakanda, it was my country's people who were killed in Nigeria,” he pointed out. “Given that, my words carry more weight than those of most other UN members on the issue of the Sokovia Accords. Allow me to join you in the hunt for this man. I can see to it that your counter-proposal is given strong consideration.”
Their contact finished showing them around, accepted a hefty tip from Tony, and left them alone. As soon as the door closed behind him, just about everybody rounded on Steve and demanded to know if he was okay.
“They've informed the UN of their decision. The UN is monitoring your aircraft and all the exits from this suite. Apparently, something is obstructing their attempts to monitor what you're doing in here, not that you guys would know anything about
“It was Steve,” Tony said obnoxiously, pointing at Steve as if he were a five-year-old tattle-tale.
Bucky smiled like a predator that had cornered its prey.
Steve sighed contentedly. He licked his lips. After a moment to adjust, he started moving. He established a rhythm and rode Bucky slowly. The twelve-second fiasco had been borne of frantic desperation. But this? The need this time was to experience Bucky fully and for as long as he could manage.
the brains of this operation? I fight
“If you're so concerned, why are you antagonizing him?” Rhodey asked. He didn't expect a response.
Bucky smiled, and this time it reached his eyes. “Hey, punk.”
“Whatever for?” Tony asked with mock confusion. The team snickered.
Tony wanted to apologize, but he also didn't really wanna fuck with Steve when he was in that mood. Then again, maybe apologizing would help his mood. “Honey?” he tried tentatively.
“He's not going to hurt you, Tony.”
Steve reached over, picked out the medium-sized clear bottle he recognized, and put it in Bucky's hand. “This one,” he said.
Steve shook his head, feeling a wave of panic. He
Tony sputtered. “Not the same,” he argued. “That was for science. More to the point, if this guy is brazen enough to do what he did to Captain America in a room full of Avengers, what might he do to literally anyone else?”
“Two: you shouldn't bring these matters up in front of the suspected abuser. It's not safe. Abusers are irrational and violent. You might think that would make for an instant viral video, but anyone in the vicinity could be in danger, including yourself. No more questions, thank you.”
Steve helped, wriggling out of them while scooting back to the middle of the bed to make sure he was properly centered. He slipped off his briefs and tossed them to the far side of the bed while Bucky stripped off his own pants and underwear as quickly as he could. He noticed they were both already fully erect. He thought that didn't bode well for how long either of them would last, but he didn't really care about it since his priority at the moment was having Bucky inside of him as soon as possible.
“This is the
Tony just shook his head and dismissed their attention with a short wave of his hand, his rational mind prevailing over what everyone expected would be an emotional response. “Better bring it inside,” Tony told Steve and Bucky. “Last thing we need is some looky-loo with a drone or helicopter leaking this to the press.”
“No, I get it. It's not like it's personal. It takes someone enhanced to do what you like, and I'm not enhanced, ergo...”
“It's okay, Buck. Tony and I couldn't stand each other at first. Tony's...”
. They can't stop you from leaving, but they'll know if you do, and I can assure you the Accords situation won't go your way if you interfere.
Steve had no idea how to handle this situation. “You're not... I dunno... upset?”
“The code words?” Bucky repeated. “They volunteered for this shit, Steve. They never used the code words.”
“Vision's okay.”
Natasha answered before Steve could. “It's a top-off.”
Tony walked over to the window and opened it. “Hey FRIDAY, activate the Bucky Protocol.”
Wanda and Bucky headed back into the compound, passing Sam and Clint once again, only this time the men were carrying a large cooler each. Once they were alone, Wanda turned to Bucky. “So about these words....”
Steve felt better. “Nothing,” he answered. He kissed Bucky when he got back to the bed. “Everything's perfect.” Steve took his turn in the bathroom and returned to see Bucky curled up under the covers. Steve wasn't particularly tired, but he got into bed with Bucky, anyway. He wrapped his arms around Bucky and was bombarded by two strong feelings.
“-or if one thing leads to another-”
“You don't know that. We're in the UN headquarters. They could be watching or listening to us right now.”
“I would be, by conventional social standards. But I can't be that thing, Steve, that stops you when you're two feet from the happiness that's been just out of reach for nearly a century. I don't want to cause you any more grief than my personality naturally does.”
Ross looked surprised. “Mr. President.”
Bucky was content to let Steve lead, as he was wont to do in most areas of their lives. That's not to say that Bucky had nothing to do. He spent much of their time together feeling Steve's muscles work under his hands as Steve writhed on top of him. A few times, he hooked his arms around Steve's shoulders, pulled himself up to meet Steve's body, and let Steve bear his weight as they kissed.
“Yes?” Tony repeated, hopes up. “We can try this?”
All seven of them headed inside to see what was going on. For some reason, they were still using the same room they'd been in during the blast, and it was a mess. All the windows were just gone, and there was broken glass all over the floor. Prince T'Challa – or, King T'Challa now, was staring at a spot of blood staining the carpet. Techs were combing through the room to collect evidence before anything could be cleaned up. A screen had been lowered in order to broadcast the surveillance image that had been discovered.
He peeked at his teammates from the corner of his eye. Tony was leaning forward like he wanted to stand, but Vision had a hand on his shoulder. Everyone was looking at him. They knew that look in his eye, and he recognized theirs: the “we came here to keep the peace, but now we have to watch Steve mow down a dozen elite United Nations commandos” look. It was a new look, but he could tell. He cracked his neck to the left. He cracked his neck to the right. Someone shouted, “Steve, no!” but it fell on deaf ears as he turned back around, stood toe-to-toe with the tac team's Commander, and got in his face.
“You can go back to your seat now,
“Bucky?” he called out.
“Not wrong, no. Something's just... a thing.” Tony told them that he and President Ellis have a plan to ensure that Bucky would be able to move forward with his life without legal issues related to the Winter Soldier hanging over his head.
At first Steve could only think that he
“Or I can
“Just dusting for fingerprints,” Tony said.
Around dawn, Steve walked into the lab in sleep pants and bed head. “Hey, guys. FRIDAY says you've been down here for hours. Couldn't sleep?” Steve leaned over Tony for a kiss.
Bucky scowled at the use of his Hydra moniker. “My name is Bucky,” he huffed.
Tony agreed, “Yeah, not with a UN representative hanging around.”
“It was
“Can we all agree to have this read by dinner so we can finalize a draft
Steve fake-smiled at Rhodey. “Tony's had real bad insomnia since New York. You of all people should understand that. I do what I can to help.”
The surprise had little to do with them both being men. Archaeologists had discovered love letters between Steve and Bucky from World War II. While Steve was initially hesitant, he gave his blessing for them to be published after Bucky had reemerged as the Winter Soldier and went on the run. It was important to him that people see Bucky for who he really was: American hero, loving man, victim. Tony... well, his very long string of lovers had a few men peppered in there. If anything, people were surprised that Tony was getting married at all, regardless of to whom.
“If you want him, why don't you fight for him?”
Bucky agreed to both requests. He sat at the table while Tony inspected his arm and chatted with him for a few hours. Bucky found that Tony had some very irritating qualities and some actually endearing qualities. He was surprised that Steve would marry someone as shamelessly crude as Tony could be. On the other hand, he took Bucky's attitude in stride when Bucky felt like being a little shit. That would be important in their future relationship.
“Sergeant Barnes, Mr. Stark requests that you join him in his laboratory.” FRIDAY guided Bucky to the lab.
Steve blushed adorably. “Please don't.”
“You know, it's rude to show up at someone's house without calling first,” Wanda pointed out.
Bucky shook his head. “No, you have to burn that. And if that Zemo guy knows the words, he has to die!”
Tony shook his head. He stuffed the sexcapades photo in his pocket and handed the rest of the stack to Rhodey to give back to the reporter. “Look, I appreciate the concern. Domestic violence is a serious problem and should be called out. I just have two comments on the matter.
Bucky reached between them and began to stroke Steve along to Steve's rhythm. Steve stopped him with a gentle hand over his, though, breathlessly explaining that he didn't want to finish too soon. Bucky understood and agreed; he moved his hands to Steve's body, all over Steve's body, whatever he could reach.
Tony nodded. “We understand and accept. Sergeant Barnes is eager to clear his name. However, for the safety of everyone involved, including Sergeant Barnes, until such time as he is cleared, all interviews must be held at the Avengers compound under the supervision of the team. We are prepared to provide transportation and accommodations for anyone you'd like to send.”
He had a point. Steve and Bucky had had plenty of sex in the thirties and forties, but after some light experimentation, they both decided that hands got the job done just fine without the aftertaste. “Yeah, well... thanks to the serum, there are limits to what Tony and I can do together.”
But then he waited. He waited, and he waited. What was probably only five seconds felt like five hours. Bucky was right: seventy-two years was long enough. Another five seconds of this torture, and Steve was sure he'd die of not having Bucky. “Bucky, if you don't get on with it, I swear to-”
Tony stood, screwing shut a specimen container with a swab inside. “Touch DNA,” he explained.
Tony imagined what the UN's response would be to T'Challa getting injured or killed in their company. “Your Highness, I don't think-”
Tony looked at Natasha, then again at Steve. “It's just
“That's
Steve broke the kiss when he felt Bucky's hands pawing at his fly. He was starting to feel short of breath. “Wait.” He took Bucky's hands in his own and looked him in the eye. “Are you sure about this?” Bucky had only been back for three days, his mind patched up for merely a few hours. “You don't need more time?”
, and it looks like there isn't space on the docket until Wednesday.” In front of five Winter Soldiers and the UN's entire chamber, he actually grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and started to write. He turned to the UN member cowering behind the table he was standing on. “Hey man, how do you spell Habeus Corpus?”
"What?" Steve's question brought him out of his trance, as he realized he had been silently staring at Steve.
"Like a family?"
Steve's seemed to have realized something as he pulled back. "Oh. You saw that."
"Asleep?"
"You say that now." Tony said, mouth full of bacon.
"I would rather you didn't in front of my kid." Steve had a giant grin on his face.
"You seem to like it." Steve whispered, pulling his lips back by only a fraction.
After a while, they abandoned the pool and dried themselves off with the towels, wrapping them around their waists. They went inside and Steve picked up Peter's sleeping body up as Tony guided his to their bedroom.
"What is it, Tony?" Steve asked, curiously.
They stayed in the pool, splashing around, exchanging Peter, playing peek-a-boo with him by emerging from under water every now and then. They even left peter on his own, swimming by really, really close, just to give Peter the illusion that he's doing good on his own.
"Good luck finding a new babysitter." Pepper cheerfully said. Tony hung up the phone and shoved it in his pocket.
They mixed the ingredients according to a recipe Steve already knew. After a huge mess made, when the batter was mixed, Steve poured it into a cake pan and it went into the heated oven.
"You can come out whenever you feel scared, okay, darling? No need to be ashamed. Okay?" Steve asked, a small frown never leaving his face. Tony noticed but didn't comment on it.
"I thought your assistant was a guy."
He rolled out of bed, landing with a thump on the floor, sheets still tangled around his sleepy figure. "I'm up, Pep. Don't worry."
"And I have you with me."
"And I thought I had missed you until I saw you in the park again. Believe me, I thanked all the gods and stars that existed when you agreed to meet me again."
Peter looked at his dad, who just shook his head at Tony. "No one's getting a hundred scoops. You can't eat that much, you'll get sick. Do you wanna get sick?"
Tony chuckled. "Yeah, I had to make up for something I did for a guy and of all the places one could possibly think of, this is what happened." He then answered Peter, who, bless him, was still looking confused having not received his answer. "A business partner is someone you do business with. Kinda like who you work with."
Upon reaching the park, he thought of something that he hadn't thought of in the entirety of last week. Him and Steve had not decided where in this huge fucking park to meet. That was the genius in him.
"Bed. Now." Tony mumbled against Steve's lips, breathing in quickly before continuing the kiss.
Tony looked at Steve. "You coming in any time soon?"
After looking at the menu, Tony didn't miss the way Steve's eyes bulged out or the way he surreptitiously gulped.
"Then I would've known about it, seeing as I am your assistant." Tony frowned at that. "Now, the clock is ticking and you need to shower and change and get your hair in order. It looks like a tragedy."
"Wait till he sees Elastic Girl." Steve brought Peter's back to the sofa's backrest. Then he placed Peter's tiny plate with a tiny slice of pizza on it on his lap. He then dropped a slice each from the box that was on the table onto two plates, handing one to Tony and keeping one for himself.
Peter's face lit up like the sky on fourth of July. "Really?"
He scrolled a bit, not knowing anything but the hair color was a bit of a hindrance.
Peter's eyes swam over all the familiar covers before they landed on the Finding Nemo poster and exclaimed, "Nemo! Nemo!"
Tony took off his suit and changed into the T-shirt and trouser he had in the lab. "Have someone collect the suit later, JARVIS."
"Would you like one?" A guy came beside him and a kid's voice followed his.
Steve was silent for a few seconds. "Sorry for giving you a fright like that."
"I made him."
They sat down at a table by the window, Peter beside Steve and Tony right across from him. Peter started licking the treat all over, getting on his mouth than in it. Steve didn't seem to care much about the mess. "It's no use." He said, but he did cover Peter's shirt with a napkin by tucking it in his collar.
Steve looked at lost of words. "Tony- I didn't know it was gonna be here..."
Peter turned with a frown and looked at the movies list.
Pepper grabbed his arm again, this time to actually drag him back.
"Fuck the movie. Lets go to the bed." Steve laughed and got up and on the floor. Tony stood on the sofa, bringing their lips together again. Steve hummed and grabbed Tony under his thighs as the other man jumped and wrapped his legs around Steve's waist. Steve only managed a slight stumble before walking his way to Tony's bedroom. He did bump into the wall beside the door while entering, hitting Tony's back, making him groan.
"I was just gonna go say 'hi'." He innocently said.
"Hello?" Steve sounded hesitant.
"After Peter."
"I'm good too, thanks." Steve was just so painfully courteous. It was
He collected his phone and wallet and exited the room, ignoring Pepper in the living room and headed straight for the elevator.
Steve smirked at him and when Tony turned to walk to the bathroom, he tapped his butt, making Tony yelp. Tony raised a finger to say something but changed his mind and just spoke the truth. "I really like you." And then continued along the way.
"What if I said there was something really important I was ignoring just to go to this park?"
"Look, Pepper, I know what I did was wrong and I shut it down as soon as I opened and I feel guilty about it. I really do. Believe me."
"You little..." Tony got up and went to Peter, grabbing him and picking him up over his shoulder, Peter shrieking and laughing and squirming.
They saw the sun get lower in the sky and around evening Steve decided it was time to wake Peter up.
"I can't stop crying. I'm trying. But I can't. You don't need to see me like this."
Tony giggled lightly, running his fingers through Steve's wet hair. "I love you."
"I do apologize, Ms Potts, but I could not have stopped sir. I am programmed to obey his commands."
Steven then shifted on his feet and Tony was reminded that his presence only two feet away.
"You staying the night?" Tony asked during the movie, take away boxes littering the coffee table in front of them, Peter sitting between them.
"Yeah." Tony whispered. "We're away enough from the city. No light pollution here. Just the clear, beautiful night sky." When Steve didn't say anything, Tony continued. "Wanna stargaze?"
Tony bit his lip, stopping himself from smiling a bit too widely. "I meant, the pancakes."
Steve gently pushed until Tony was laying on the sofa with him on top of him, their lips never parting. Steve used his hands to support himself but Tony pulled him all the way down. Steve let out a huff and a laugh when he landed on Tony.
He made his way to the counter where he had a bottle. Of what, he didn't remember nor did he care.
"We'll get you a bandage on the way out. Would you want SpongeBob or My Little Pony?"
Sometime around the whole week, Tony was busy in his workshop. Inventing was what he did. He was in the process of perfecting the new software he had been working on when JARVIS interrupted.
"Five thirty."
"Just don't do it again." She turned around and left for the elevator.
"Yeah, daddy. You love ice cream."
"Okay, so he had a little boy. Brown hair. Does that help?"
"We weren't ever together but she was my best friend. Y'know?" No, Tony didn't know but he wasn't self-centered enough to say that. "She was all I had. Apart from Bucky."
"That is exactly why you're the more beautiful one." Steve's smile ever so shy. "You think the blond-blue eyes combo could be beaten by something?"
He walked for a while when a voice caught his attention. And what a beautiful voice it was.
"Please do." Tony answered. Steve leaned in to kiss him on the lips, soft and sweet.
Tony's jaw dropped and he could not believe his ears. "You," he pointed an accusing finger at him. "You play really dirty. Really dirty. And in front of a three year old. Your
"Can't I just shake a few hands, get a few pictures, kiss a few babies and be out of there within half an hour?" He asked, mostly just to piss Pepper. He gulped down his cup of coffee. God, that's good stuff.
"Not a problem. And I didn't bring you here to worry. So why don't you relax and think of what flavor you're gonna get." Tony had a warm smile on his face. "Have you decided that yet, Peter?"
"You sound like Bucky."
Tony snorted lightly. "You think that's gonna stop me." He made exaggerated kissy faces and got closer to Steve.
"Well if my words mean anything, you're doing an amazing job with him. I hope you know that."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay?!" Just seemed to shut Steve up. "Steve. I have wanted to since the moment I laid eyes on you. You are a walking Greek god, why would I not want to?"
"It's not fucked up." Tony gave him a confused look. "Your brain. It's not fucked." Tony blinked at him, words lost to him. He felt like he had never learned how to talk, ever. "It's actually really beautiful."
"Anything else? Anything else I said-"
Peter shook his head, remorseful. "No."
Surprisingly, and also not so, a blush crept on Steve's face. "I've actually... Not... Since Peter..."
"Tony, I have some leftovers from yesterday-"
"Lucky him." That got a chuckle out of Steve. "So... Uh, the movie?"
He felt Steve's hand placed on his back, just there, not pulling him. Just there. Just holding him. Just touching.
"Mhmm. You want some?"
"Not really. We could cook anything."
If he only knew.
Tony made a strangled noise and took in a deep breath. He cleared his throat and stepped back. "Unpack. We gotta unpack. So we can get everything started."
There were pictures taken, of course. He didn't have to fake a million-dollar-smile for them either. He smiled brightly for the camera with the kids, them smiling big enough to blind a person. And that's what Tony loved. These kids might not have a lot to smile about, but if a subtraction from his bank account was going to help be a cause of it then so be it. Not that he was counting every dollar he had. It would take years. And he's got other things to do.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve pulled away looking at Tony. "Okay, seriously. Is something wrong?"
He's done this many times over and over again. He's got this.
Pepper was an amazing PA. The best. Tony was willing to bet his entire company on the fact. He's pretty sure she was his mother in the previous life, getting him up for school and pestering him about homework and dishes. He didn't know where he would be if not for her. Remembering his indescribably messy twenties, no one stuck around the way she did. And he was really, really thankful. He wasn't the best at showing his feelings, but he was glad Pepper could see right through him, and knew exactly how he felt, should his words help her understand or not. She always knew. Above all, she was a terrific friend.
"If I can't get back in time." He looked back at Tony who nodded. "You can finish your movie but promise me you won't give Tony any trouble."
"Fortunately, no. Otherwise we would've met before. I don't think I could forget meeting you."
"Hi!" He waved his chubby little hand at Tony who waved back with an enormous smile.
"You told me that I was all that meant to you." Steve said softly, holding Ton's hand.
"I would suggest closing the file if you're done, sir, but I would be happy to place an order for a shrine to be made as well."
They made their way to the kitchen and Tony opened up the fridge. Steve looked in and whistled. "That thing's loaded."
"I..." Steve stopped to think, looking all over the table, obviously still overwhelmed. "I don't know where to start, if I'm honest."
Before Tony could get a word in, the kid had already moved his gaze to The Incredibles poster. "Incredles! Dad, Incredles is here!", he pointed eagerly at the poster.
"Nothing's bothering me."
was playing inside his head.
"It's better now than it was in the beginning. Bucky got me a better job, well it pays better so. He was there through everything, he knew how hard it all was for me. He had my back."
Steve smiled at Tony and all Tony could do was stare at him. He was pretty sure his eyes were showing exactly what he was feeling, and hoped to whatever celestial being listening in on them to make sure Steve didn't find him a creep.
Every other sound seemed to be blocked from Tony's ears. His eyes went out of focus. He was pretty sure his brain exploded too. Like that one scene from the animated movie Peter loved to watched about the birds. Storks, was it? Anyway, when he blinked and found Steve still sitting there, he guessed his previous assumption was wrong.
Tony didn't have anything to say but he opened his mouth to let something out of it. Nothing did. Except a squeak.
Peter stared at the movie posters before going to Steve and climbing onto his lap, with Steve's help, and brought his mouth to Steve's ear who leaned in. The toddler cupped his mouth so only his father could hear, although he hadn't quite mastered the art of whispering as of yet. But Tony wasn't going to comment on that.
"It was work." Steve shrugged, absentmindedly rubbing Peter's back.
"Am I?" Steve whispered back.
Peter nodded and Steve took a deep breath. "Are you sure, Tony? I mean, this place is- hell, this entire area is-"
"I have picked out what you'll wear. It's pressed and hanging and waiting for you. I just need to get it out of your closet. I am always prepared. It's why you hired me."
Steve smiled widely and bent down to squat in front of Peter. "They do match! Oh, you're such a clever boy, aren't you?" He ruffled his son's brown hair.
I really enjoyed getting back to writing and then choosing these guys to write about. They were really fun to play around with.
He pulled his phone, and typed out for JARVIS to find about all the people that had their children in the daycare. A few seconds later, he got the whole lists of names.
Having to see Steve like that had been terrifying and Tony was not at all a fan of that, in any way. That moment he
"I know. And I'm so glad for that." The kiss was continued and Tony just did not want to let Steve go. Never.
"And I know we haven't known each other very long. But I want to change that. I want to know you. And little Peter. And that nameless uncle you guys keep bringing up. And I want to show you that even after such a little time, I don't find myself thinking that this might not have a future. That is completely up to you, by the way. What I want is to make sure you know that I know that you're not someone after my name or money or fame or any of that bullshit. I know that. Which is exactly why we are even here in the first place. And Pepper seems to like you."
"I suppose." Steve said, trying to not show his displeasure at the thought of the cost he was expecting. "We'll see."
Steve looked down to see Tony already looking up at him, a small, delicate smile on his face, his eyes shining. "It's so..."
Tony's phone started to ring and he groaned. When he made no move to leave the pool, Steve told him to do so. Grumbling, he went out of the pool and grabbed his phone. Looking at the caller, he mumbled, "I told her to take time off." He turned to the boys in the pool. "I'll be right back."
"And I know this might scare you off, I don't want it to, and I hope it doesn't, but I am..." Steve sighed deeply, steadying himself and his voice that had begin to quiver. His solid gaze never wavering from Tony's, not even for a moment. "I might love you."
He saw Steve move his gaze from his eyes to his lips, his breath caught in his throat. Steve swallowed. Before Steve made a move to exit the car, Tony had to do something.
"It's nothi-"
"Hmm." Tony nodded. "That's why you thought this was the perfect time to deal with whatever you're dealing with?"
Tony's eyes bore into Steve's, the blue eyes shining even in the night. The stars were doing wonders on the golden boy, light brilliantly glistening the man all over, the twilight reflecting on his pale skin and golden hair.
Steve had nodded, smile never leaving his face. "Yes. I see that, honey. You wanna watch it?"
Before Steve could interject, Tony continued. "I got your work to give you the well earned weekend break, without pay cuts. We have everything we will need in the trunk. Petey here helped me pack, didn't you?" Peter proudly nodded, making Steve ease out a small smile. "And if we need anything else, or if you feel like we forgot something of yours, we'll call Happy and he'll get it here. No problem, whatsoever. So... This was the surprise. So..." Tony indicated that he was finished and was awaiting Steve's response.
He cupped Tony's face and brought him closer for a firm kiss.
"Thanks a bunch, J. You're a life saver."
"Honey, what's wrong?"
The two adults swam around, kissing more than occasionally, splashing each other like kids.
Peter, from his back, yelled. "No!"
He heard Steve snort. "Basically."
He looked at Peter who was sleeping with lips parted, turned on his side, hands clutching the sheets. Then he looked at Steve, who was exactly the same. Lips parted, body turned to his side, both facing Tony. Peter's brunette hair and brown eyes would misguide people but his actions and small habits and expressions were so akin with Steve's, to a point it was scary. But Tony found himself loving it.
"Yeah, I see. I see." Tony ruffled the kid's hair. "Hungry for some pancakes?" Peter nodded eagerly. He turned to Steve. "How're we looking, Steve?"
"Then why were you so tense since you got here?"
"Fine. I won't." Steve shrugged.
Tony didn't really know how to explain it but the man had never seen something so beautiful. Someone so beautiful.
"Can we go to the pool?"
Tony couldn't do anything but groan as he sat inside his car. "You just had to act like my mum in front of him, huh? He heard you, I'm pretty sure."
"Steve! Hey."
"Oh, no, just a little programming. No big deal."
They drove for a while more in silence, except for the occasional babbling coming from the toddler. Tony took a turn and stopped a few miles into the road. Steve looked at him confused. "Where are we and why are we here?"
"Yeah, but... I thought- I thought... y'know... it's good to see you." Steve as a stuttering mess and a tint of blush spreading over his cheeks was a sight for sore eyes.
"You really love me?" Steve asked.
"So I've heard." Tony smiled, moving Peter's leg, slowly, and then sat up.
Once the magic word was spoken, Tony grabbed Peter's hand and kissed it too. Then pretended to almost bite it. Peter squealed and pulled his hand back.
"Then why would you-"
He jerked up with the support of his hands, looking at the other side of the bed, with wide eyes. He could hear sirens ringing in his head because where the fuck is Peter?
"Of course, you are, darling. Who else would be?"
"That guy and the kitchen, I swear to god." Tony grumbled. He rolled over, now wanting coffee, because if Steve was up and in the kitchen, coffee was already freshly brewed. He made his way there, after putting on a pair of boxers, and saw Steve by the stove, in nothing but his boxer shorts, back turned to him. Tony leaned against the wall, just admiring the view.
"Who will I meet?" Peter asked for the twentieth time.
"Bucky."
"I'm not-"
Tony tossed the ball at the same distance as Peter did, who squealed and ran after it.
"I was. I was scared but then I wasn't."
"That's right! Aren't you the smartest one!" Tony nudged Peter's cheek with this knuckle, who seemed really happy with himself and picked up the slice to take a bite.
"Of course she did."
"Eat your pizza, second smartest one." Steve shoved Tony's shoulders.
"Uh huh. He always knows everything. And he's always right."
Tony chuckled. "Like I said, no biggie. And you can call me whenever you want to, y'know? For whatever."
It seemed like Tony was not the only one who's nerves were getting to him. "He got anymore questions about business? I got plenty of answers." Tony joked. Which seemed to have worked because Steve let out a chuckle, turning around, probably to keep an eye on his kid. The tension on his shoulder had let go a bit.
Peter turned to look at Tony and the innocent and confused look on his face had Tony rambling about each flavor while pointing at them.
"...I brought another one?" Tony said, more like testing his statement to be enough to be believed or not.
"Tony, I swear to god, you better be getting ready!" She knocked the door some more. Tony decided that him and his bed just weren't meant to be. Or maybe it was just the timing of life, yeah, something like that.
He stinks of fight and he doesn’t want to take that home to Tony so he sticks it out till the police from a neighboring town make it to theirs and it’s filling out a report which is backed up by multiple witnesses. He was ganged up on, and they got what they deserved.
“Well we’ve already established that Mr. Edwards. How did she start it is the question,” the principal coaxes.
“If he won’t say anything he gets suspension for the next week. That’s the policy.”
The doctors ask him about it too whenever he takes him to the clinic. Words are thrown behind his back. Words like slow and retard. In the near future they’ll have better terms for it. And the part that knows they mean more well than ill is the reason he doesn’t bash someone’s head in for the comments.
It’s not that cutting he thinks, but it does have the lady fiddling with the sleeves of her sweater and stammering out an apology- for what, even she doesn’t know.
“Hey! Hey O'Sherin, I'm talking to you.”
In his own timeline, Tony got the scar from falling off a tree one summer he’d spent at school after his parents failed to come get him.
The one on his knee is a skateboarding accident at seven. He doesn’t quite take to bicycles but somehow skateboarding is what works. Tony'd come back that evening bleeding from his knees and palms and Steve had patched him up right there in the kitchen, kissing each knee after he was done.
“It was Christy.”
“I want to-- I don’t mind Steve, I really don’t… I want to take care of you.”
It would be disconcerting if Steve didn’t enjoy it so much. Not just that, it’s good for Tony.
And Steve well...he’s at loss of what to say.
with. He’s Steve’s.
“The way I heard it, your girl started it. Tony simply finished it. Fuck off.”
“Were you jealous?”
“You’re sad.” Tony sniffles into his shirt.
Tony is slow to speak.
“Tony.” He points to himself and says it over and over again. The floodgates finally open because once he starts talking he can’t seem to keep quiet. The worker, Sheila, exhales in relief.
Tony is 15 when Steve gets called in by the school.
“I didn’t like them.” He has his knees drawn up in the seat with his face resting in between them and Steve has to strain to hear him.
“The women. At the beach.” It comes out through gritted teeth. “I didn’t like the way they were looking at you.”
“Tony,” he says standing behind his seat in the principal’s office. “Do you have anything to say for yourself?”
Tony’s bottom lip wobbles and Steve pulls him into his lap. At eight, Tony’s shorter than every boy in his class and one or two girls, barely reaching Steve’s neck when sitting in his lap. The townsfolk offer advice(one person swears by bovine milk, the other by protein, and yet another by cycling), the entire shiftless bunch of them with nothing to do but twiddle their thumbs and poke their noses in other people’s business.
Steve’s changed. Not just outwardly. He’s sported a beard for the past few decades. The serum that kept him perpetually young in another lifetime seems to have met its match with time travel. There’s only so much a human body can take, super powered or not. He’s still not aging at a normal pace, but some days he does wake up to new lines on his face and a grey hair or two.
He seeks comfort only once.
If it’s a fight they want, it’s a fight they’ll get.
“Well then. I promise I won't be sad anymore, how about that Tones? And thank you for noticing Tony. You’re very intuitive.” He finishes and holds the boy closer to his chest.
Steve gave that cute blush of his when Tony had tried to explain how he was raised to believe gifts were a way to the heart. Sure, he had heavily sugar-coated it but it had worked. The fact that it took an hour long discussion is peripheral and history.
Steve then pressed his lips to Tony's, firmly. Yet it was sweet. Everything Steve ever does, Tony would label it sweet.
"Well, here you have a real live one!" Tony patted Dum-E's surface. "Go on, he's friendly, and incredibly useless."
Tony's face fell. "C'mon, Steve. I bring you out on a date and you're not even gonna eat?"
"Peter, you remember Tony?" Steve asked, making Peter look up from the ball he held in his small hands. "Say 'hi', baby."
Once he was clean, he looked at his reflection. He didn't require a shave, he thought. He checked his breath and brushed his teeth just to be on the safe side. Thinking he was good to go, he exited the bathroom.
Tony shifted his body closer, and pressed in deeply and he felt Steve let out a deep breath through his nose, never breaking their contact. When they parted, Tony rested their foreheads together as they both tried to gather their breathing.
Steve moved smoothly from the stove to the side to grab the plate and gave Tony the view of the pan that had the delicious smelling bacon sizzling on it. Steve picked the pieces up and put them on the plate and lowered the flame intensity of the other stove that had a waiting pan on top of it. Since when did Tony have so many pans, he would never know.
The silence in the room was nerve-wrecking. Tony's mind blanked out, if you ask him. It was completely quiet in there, yet Tony felt like every cell in his body was screaming. He felt his body quiver, or was it just his chest? He didn't know.
"Steve, sweetheart, breathe." Tony interjected Steve's nervous rant, making the other stop. "You know, I know your kid is your first priority, right?" When Steve didn't say anything, Tony continued. "Well you should know that. Okay? Peter comes first, it's a given fact. I was thinking about Saturday, around seven. But if that doesn't suit you, we can reschedule. It's no biggie."
"I'll look after him." And honestly, he did not know what overcame him when he had said that. He had never looked after a child,
"Bye." Peter waved his hand, just like before and Tony did so too.
"I'm not crying." Steve shook his head.
The robot obeyed the command as Tony took Peter to the elevator and up to his floor. When the doors opened, he walked to his living room where Steve was already sitting on the sofa, shoes and jacket already discarded. Peter was placed down on his own feet before he ran to his father.
"Except the employee's."
"You don't have to fret about it, I mean it. And you weren't stuck up. You are a great company, Steve. Really great. I'm glad you agreed to come and stayed despite your reluctance."
Next week, he thought. Saturday. Same time.
With the bowl on Tony's lap and them sharing it throughout the movie, occasionally kissing, Peter totally focused on the movie, the next hour and a half passed by quickly.
Tony had called Steve over for a dinner and a movie in the tower. Peter was tagging along, apparently the kid was thoroughly animated to meet Tony again, or so Steve had voiced.
tough.
"People. Right. People. Well, yeah, I mean people are mostly wrong. They're - wait, what are they wrong about?"
Tony would buy Peter something, like that one time he was to meet them at that park again and on his way there he had bought a toy car. It had a remote to control it, looked like a model for a really posh car, something Tony would own, and it was blue. How could he have not bought it? And Peter had expressed his love for it by hopping up and down and hugging Tony furiously and repeating his thanks.
He had a chance.
"Next time start off with that, JARVIS. Let me hear him."
"You need help?"
. Let alone a toddler who needs constant attention. But Steve looked so lost, so vulnerable, and Tony did not like it one bit.
"I uh... I thought I lost the kid." He simply stated.
"It's Dum E. With a hyphen."
That was the thing. Before Steve, Tony was demanding and rough, without any meaning to such actions. Now with these soft, chaste kisses he didn't find himself complaining.
"You are thirty seven. You don't really classify as a youngster."
"Summer Santa makes me sound old. Doesn't it make me sound old?"
Time was approaching and soon enough the redhead was going to march into his lab and pull him out to get him ready. He wished he would've invented an invisible ray, he could really put that into great use right now.
The night went by, with Steve gradually forgetting about his previous disfavor for the amount of food ordered. Tony noticed Steve try everything, albeit it was due to the consistent persuasion. But Steve felt more relaxed. Very easy. He would joke, and laugh, and tease. That smirk on his face while the teasing made Tony's stomach turn.
The scar is a sign. More likely a warning. The universe conveying its message and Steve gets it, loud and clear:
“I thought only girls got mood swings at puberty.” He gets a glare in return. Tony chucks wet sand at his chest and stalks back to their hotel room.
It’s the one thing his Tony never got to say to him, and it plays over and over again in his mind.
manner.
Tony curls up to him after, content. He’s drowsy, his beautiful boy can barely keep his eyes open where they flutter against Steve’s chest and Steve gathers him tight and close in the night and doesn’t let go.
“And how were they looking at me?” He goes for a laugh like it’s one big joke.
Airports and highways are out of the question so the one vacation Steve takes them on is in a neighboring town.
“How?” And it’s back to silence again. The principal flails his hand around in a
“He’ll speak when he has something to say.” He says, leaving no room for argument.
A squeaky “Steve” had been his only warning before Tony’s swept away by a current too strong for his little body.
It’s that time of the year when autumn blends into winter. Colby takes his dick out which does it’s best to shrivel against the frosty night air in Colby’s warm palm, his eyes twinkling with the stars.
Cab Calloway is on, Steve turns up the volume; the only glance he spares back is to check on Tony and keeps on driving, fingers happily tapping away at the steering wheel.
