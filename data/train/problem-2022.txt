Sherlock knew the moment a shamefaced Jeremy skulked down the stairs that there was no mistake. It was the same person he had seen on the CCTV footage. (Jeremy was also currently reading The Scarlet Letter, a rugby player and a voracious consumer of Weetabix. Sherlock mentally swatted at those useless deductions, catching them like flies and stuffing them in a mental folder.)
The door bell rang. Mrs Hudson was on the case immediately. I could hear her talking to women, one about thirty, the other about 41 or 42. It was a formal visit, so perhaps they were clients.
Why do they need to fuck so continuously, John wonders as he lays in his bed, eyes raw and arms wrapped tightly around his chest after a round of particularly vicious dreams. The ceiling above him seems to be weakening. They could come crashing through any moment.
At that time I had grown quite unhinged – depression maybe, post traumatic stress definitely, and wasn’t able to fight him like he wanted me to fight him. He had just lost his daughter and was in terrible pain, but all I could do was stare at him and think how much I loved him, and how ill-equipped I was to deal with his tragedy.
Sounds, flavours and touches rise like a storm and engulf Sherlock at a ferocious pace. He tries to wade through all the new information, gathering it up by the armfuls as John’s arms wind right around him and their bodies can get no closer. Only then does Sherlock understand that it makes no difference how much he knows about the organic structure of saliva or the anatomy of the tongue and it’s place in the digestive process – facts have no place here. All this warmth and tenderness and pleasure cannot be quantified or measured against anything because there isn’t anything like it.
John stood to attention. “Yes. Albion and I both care for Sherlock.”
"Well, sort of, but mostly people who you have to represent have really bad energy. I mean, I just couldn't handle all these people who just deliberately break the law."
“Because I always called him Lestrade. I never knew his name was Greg and by the time I was told, it was too late. Anyway, I think he secretly likes me calling him different names.”
“So you’re gay?”
A lot of people came to visit me after my first month. Mrs Hudson came first. She wore one of her going-out dresses and brought me a copy of the Guardian and a  bag of Bassett’s jelly babies. I’ve never professed a particular predilection to either, so it was a nice surprise.
We had been friends for such a long time that it would have been difficult for us not to be a functional couple. I think it is fair to say that in one way or another we had always been in love but circumstances had kept us apart, and that had been for the best. I say that obviously with the luxury of hindsight.
Ah, Antonio. Sherlock is still for a moment as he rides a few lovely waves of the Summer, the first piece he was able to play through without error. When it passes, he drums his fingers impatiently on the armrests and wonders if Ademar can squeeze him in tonight. Figuratively and literally.
Sherlock says nothing but answers with a little self-satisfied smirk.
“How?” There’s a small slice of alarm in John’s voice.
Sherlock puts his nose in the air and speaks in his most haughty voice. “At this stage Lestrade, I wouldn’t even read it if I saw it on the front page of the paper,” although that’s not strictly true. “You’re going to have to provide me with more details – preferably fascinating ones – if you’d like my assistance. Otherwise, I am certain that even your stumbling troupe could sort it out.” He looks back down at his toes and wriggles them a little. They really do look like tiny scraps of a glorious night sky.
Sherlock goes through the findings and explains each one. "Dressed up, new fleece, girl from the suburbs who travelled to the city. London girls don't wear those shoes, that kind of fleece. Small traces of powder on her fingers means she's been handling baggies of the drug, grease on her fingertips and small traces of salt and grease on her lips and specks of potato on her back molars means she had chips. Her septum is unmarked so even though there is the faintest ring of powder around her right nostril, she hasn't used it more than a couple of times. She doesn't smoke but her jacket smells of smoke, so she's been with a smoker. Maybe the murderer? Doubtful, because there's no ash in here and no recent cigarette butts. Her teeth are very even and straight but her jaw is relatively narrow - chances are she's just had braces removed. Teenagers don't choose braces - their parents do. Her t-shirt's been ironed, her jeans are freshly washed. Teenagers don't iron t- shirts. Their mothers do though. How did she get here? The shoes are new but there's ample markings on the sole, so she's not driven or got a lift - she got a train or maybe a bus from a station quite some distance from her home: she walked."
“It gets better. Although obviously it gets a lot worse first. Shut up. So the Prince went to university and graduated very well and then thought he’d do some post graduate work, partly because he had no idea what to do but mostly because he had a terrible crush on another post grad student from his college.”
John’s inconsistent reasoning made Sherlock a little aggressive, angry like he always gets when he knows there are some facts available but he can’t quite get his hands on them.
On the reverse side, a typed description has been taped: BEECHERS ROAD 17 MARCH 1975 SHOE BELONGING TO MARIAH BEST. NOT TO BE RELEASED
“John is entirely right,” he declares and everyone gasps softly. “I should at least consider it. And now I have. Yes, inspector, take me to the latest crime scene and let’s see if I can help you.”
Albion had been crying consistently all night for about three months. There was no cure, nothing other than cosmetic remedies that lasted an hour or so. We tried them all anyway because you never know: lavender oil, warm baths, a strict routine, a lax routine, no routine, loose bed clothes, swaddling, gentle patting, being rocked to sleep in our bed, being rocked to sleep in his crib – all to no avail. Come night time, Albion was disappointed in everything.
John fires back. He’s very relieved.
"I just don't - you are absolutely amazing. How could you have possibly - there is no way you could have seen anything that - Jesus!" John shakes his head again and smiles before looking up to him. "How on earth did you know I was going here?"
We were calculating the length of the wound alongside the height of each suspect when Mike Stamford ambled in.
“Oh, looky looky!” one of them calls. “It’s Ryan Stamfuck out with his fat dad!”
My children are splendid.
Over in Baker Street, everything appears to have gone back to normal. John and Sherlock investigate difficult crimes,  they provide their findings to Inspector Lestrade, and the Scotland Yard closes another case.  Their modus operandum hasn’t changed much at all, except John has a toddler now, and her care and welfare is the primary consideration of what they do, and how they do it.
She looked briefly at me, and briefly at John, and a little longer at Albion.
Mummy gave me her warmest, kindest smile, the one I get only when I’ve been exceptionally impressive. “And just look at this little sweetheart. He couldn’t be better cared for.”
It turned out to be a simple equation.
Sherlock’s eyes are glazed with adoring wonder as he shifts so the buttons can be loosened easily. “You’ve thought about my chest?”
The second wind blast forth. I still hadn’t reconciled how so much gas could fit in such a tiny body.
astute, and unfailingly brilliant deduction.
“I’ve got the tools,” Greg says ever so casually from the front seat.
"It's a crime scene and I don't want it contaminated," Anderson calls after him.
For he built a carpeted perch for Molly’s dimwit cat.
John falls over back first and smiles at Sherlock who lands right on top of him.
He didn’t hear Eurus approach, and startled when he felt her take his hand.
Sherlock looks up quickly. “Do you? Why?”
“Mouth,” John says instantly. He’s had hundreds of blowjobs but never  anticipated one as desperately as this. He moans loudly for Sherlock and Mrs Hudson, about to mount the stairs with a tray of cake and tea, makes a dear little face and retreats gracefully to her flat.
It took him but days to compile a substantial file on John, a file so complete that it provided a copy of his therapist's notes through to details from the somewhat inept surgeon who repaired John's shoulder, right through the address and phone number of the vendor from whom John's mother bought his uniform when he started high school.
It was like a spear through my ribs. I am ordinarily very adept at masking my feelings and reactions, but that question cut so deeply that I felt the blood drain from my face. My bloodless brother had once again gone, quite literally, to the heart of the matter.
"Good morning Mrs Hudson. Most fortuitous that you should drop in now. This is Doctor Watson. He's going to move in to help me with the rent."
I waited until Saturday morning, when I had Albion to myself. I dressed him in one of his John Watson outfits because it was a special occasion, and also because he looked delightful in a striped t-shirt. I enjoyed  putting a t-shirt on him and fastening the tiny snaps on his shoulders. His little arms are like dough when I thread them through the sleeves.
he moves too quickly, a hook amongst
"Alright. Gimme."
“You have a history of drug use, and Albion’s mother has a criminal record for possession. They flagged you both when he was born.“
a) two other people also getting high in the same house saw us doing that, and
“I’m starving!” John Watson declared. Albion was resting on his shoulders, thinking about whose hair he might grab next. “Let’s go somewhere to celebrate!”
For he will lie if I ask him especially.
Ah, Schubert.
After the police officers left, Sherlock wondered through the strange old fake graves and made his way back to the shore, where he sat alone and wept again.
She also wanted me to eat stew for breakfast, which was a task beyond my physical capabilities. I like to start the day with hot liquids (tea) and move on to something small and starchy (toast, although I am partial to a small bowl of oats and brown sugar sometimes) about thirty minutes after tea.
I explained to the Judge how I went to the hospital and was bullied into the birthing room, saw my little lovebug fresh from the womb and instantly fell in love.
“Sorry?”
and some blended, no shape or reason.
"The Small Mammal Autoclave Unit." John's face is bright, his eyes glitter. "Teaching a cat Morse code!"
"A kilo of snow. Tonight. I'll be waiting for you in at 114 Bridge Road in Shepherd's Bush. You know it?"
Lestrade looked at me like he does when I explain the most basic, most obvious elements of a crime to him – wanting to believe, but not quite able to understand. I broke it down into easily digested, bite-sized pieces.
Small noises echoed through out the large warehouse. Rats thrive in places like this and quite often generations of rat relatives (and their nests) can be observed in corners, along the skirting boards and probably in the containers themselves. I assumed John was navigating a path through the rodents, looking for the light switches.
“Yep.”
“Possibly. But there’s a lot of money at stake. I think, if there’s fight, it would be about the final division of funds.”
“Yes. Although that detail will be lost on most people because you and I are not similar visually.”
“Manslaughter at best. Would have been common assault if the victim were sober. There’s been an altercation for sure, but nothing serious. He’s got a broken nose so it looks a lot more savage than it actually is.”
It doesn’t stop him trying.
"Detective Inspector. How lovely to see you."
John’s friendly, if somewhat detached bravado disintegrated rapidly when Sherlock made some gentle inquiries.
“I was compiling a book of complex mathematical theory,” Mummy seethed. “It is an extremely important book, and a great honour to have been asked by the faculty at Trinity College to record my theories.” Mummy is savage but maintains an elegant poise. “I hired two nannies, still breast fed her, and my husband – Eurus’s father – and her brothers, were there at all times.”
The hospital recorded me as the baby’s father, and Adrienne Portelli (whoever she was) as his mother.
“You don’t like tomatoes?” John’s surprised.  He didn’t know.
Sourced from angels who harvest
“I don’t know,” Sherlock answers, and he really doesn’t. He holds his hand out in front of him and wonders what it is like, to have some one take your hand and hold it. Why do people do that? What’s the point?
Lestrade looks impressed, Sherlock is delighted. A conductor of light with a gun! He's about to say something when a blast of chiming music echoes from the end of the house.
There would be lots of poems over the ensuing years, all of which John kept in his little folder, and all of which he’d read again and again, but none he loved so much as the as the one he got later that day.
Everything indeed - she has ordered in an inexplicable selection of lamb curry, Chinese dumplings, garlic bread, pad thai and chicken kiev.
I set about filling the kettle and making tea while wondering if John would like me to yell while we sexed. I’d seen that once on the internet – a man whose criminal activities I had been investigating posted videos of himself and his expensively reconstructed partner having sex. They both yelled, like one might if they were trying to carry on a conversation with the other in a room on the other side of the house. It was interesting and preposterous.
Albion’s first act of brilliance was, at eight days old, to stare, transfixed, at the rather dated, quasi-Victorian wallpaper in my flat. I knew his sight was still very limited, but I knew too that the thing he could see most clearly was distinct contrasting patterns (my wallpaper is a black fleur de lys on a beige background).
His life, his story, his pictures, his song,
In the taxi home, Sherlock stares out the window, enjoying the electric buzz of John's thoughts.
“You do understand that you are handing over your rights as a parent to John Watson? That you will have no claim or rights over Albion at all, and that these orders are unlikely to be overturned by a judge?”
“I always wondered how you met,” John said thoughtfully. “And his name is Greg.”
I would be lying to say it was easy, because it wasn’t, but it wasn’t hard either, and many times it was incredibly good fun.
“Yeah. I used to use drugs. I don’t any more.”
Sherlock has taken John to not the most salubrious, but certainly one of the best Italian eateries in London. The owner could not be happier to see him and comes out from the kitchen with his arms flung open.
“What kind of basic aspects?”
Lestrade's office, speaking with outstretched emphatic hands, as if he might reach out and drag Lestrade through his most recent deductions.
She answers the door, walking without a cane now, and says nothing, waiting to hear what might have happened.
“Shut up. So Greg, can I borrow your tools to build Toby a cat thing?”
“So you are both committed to his parenting. I wish every child I met was cared for so lovingly. My congratulations to you both.”
"I asked that idiot Stamford a year ago if he knew anybody who might want to share the flat with me. He's been keeping you a secret all this time. I'm going to poison him slowly."
John shrugs nervously, hesitant to share egregious information. "When I was in the middle east, I met a CIA agent who was heading investigations into the heroin trade. It was a big deal" –
"I can't imagine that had any impact on you."
“I didn’t know you had any views on this story, or on cats.”
I had never felt so lonely.
“Straight boy pain. Don’t worry, we all get it at least once.”
“It’s too painful,” she says in voice John recognises, the voice of a patient who has lived in chronic pain for decades. “I can’t -  I just can’t bear to have the photo replace my memories of her. They’re all packed up, under the bed.”
The notion made me bilious. “I can’t eat stew for breakfast. It goes against the grain of my cultural identity.”
While Mike stabbed me, Molly held Albion, resplendent in his first band aid (it had Pooh Bear on it). She spoke to me about her latest boyfriend whose name is either Francis, Phillip, Felix or Peter, but I was thinking simultaneously about my son’s safety in Molly’s arms and about a student John Watson learning to take blood with Mike Stamford twenty years ago. A Young Watson would have had the same laugh and the same smile but his hair would have been brighter and his trust would have been in tact and his heart unblemished in those early days.
“Can you get them to give me some morphine?”
“For all of us,” John smiled. “My main objective was to use it as a soap. And it smells nice. If it relaxes you, well, there’s a bonus.”
No good. It needs to have hair like me.
I could fit my thumb over his entire shoulder. He had collar bones, elbows and wrists. There were even little armpits. It had never occurred to me that armpits could be so small. When I’d fully absorbed that he had armpits, I carefully unfolded his fingers and put my pinkie in his palm and watched, open mouthed, as he closed his own threads of fingers around mine.
"Name?" the nurse asks wearily.
He shook his head. “I had to go, Sherlock, or else I’d be in prison too. I would have killed him. I wanted to kill him.”
Anya settled in very quickly. She was incredibly efficient and held curious views on a range of topics.
“Ninja of the unwanted? What?”
Rhonda bats him again. There's only one cure for that, Captain. Let's have some food.
“So you think the handwriting is by two different people?” Sally was taking photos on her phone and quickly punching in brief notes.
“Then the Woodsman went looking for a boar, which is a fairly fearsome kind of pig thing, but you don’t have to be frightened because there aren’t any boars in London and if there was, and it came here, Mrs Hudson would hit it with a broom and if it still got upstairs,  I’d kill it and you’d be safe.
“Oh, for Christ’s sake. Blue. Turquoise. Indigo. What difference does it make?”
I addressed the room at large. “Am I having a bath party?”
It wasn’t until he had devised and discarded a dozen jumping scenarios that he realised the problem: John associates the hospital with my death. He needs to associate it with my life, and more importantly, his place in my life. Our life.
”Yes. I’m intense,” I agreed.  (I actually had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress syndrome but that bored me to the point of a coma. I hated talking about it.)
So, after months of badgering, he went for drinks at the pub on Friday night with everyone else. He and Shona left only when they were three parts wankered, slurring both of them and touching hands and arms for longer and longer, both enjoying the safe, promising parts of flirting, leaning in on each other's personal space, making leering, slightly inappropriate suggestions, smiling with dilated pupils and holding the gaze too long in case either was unsure of the other's drunken intentions.
The matter was heard in a large room like a boardroom. Adrienne sat opposite us; Mycroft a few seats down at the end of the table. He was, he insisted, allowed to attend. My astute baby cried quite emphatically when the hearing started, and calmed only when John Watson took him and patted his back.
“They’re – actually, forget it.” He wound his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. This could put him to sleep sometimes; other times it put John to sleep and Sherlock would lay in the dark, listening to John’s breath.
"Actually, one of you might be able to help me...I've got a cat that I need to re-home. Do any of
"I'm just so tired of everything," he tells her.
I loved how my baby felt on my shoulder, a tiny soft parcel that weighed about the same as three apples.
Michelle is on time and, John thinks, surprisingly pretty in a pink jumper. She's always neat, Michelle, neat and tidy and blemish free. She looks a little unreal to John. Her hair shines naturally, her skin is clear, her smile is wide and shows straight rows of even teeth, but there's no quirk, and therefore no challenge. John likes her a lot because she doesn't attract him one iota.
"You didn't even kill it."
“She sounds particularly troubled to me, Sherlock, and I want to be certain that she is not in any danger, or in need of medical assistance.”
London is wheezing and groaning in the early morning. There are a few hardy souls starting their busy days and a few diehards still grasping at the remnants of the night before.
“Well, you guys investigate things. I thought maybe you might know about a child who has disappeared, or maybe something happened in the flat and you can, you know, have ways of finding out what happened so maybe I can, I don’t know, go to sleep without hearing this kid.”
“Why would I need bricks?”
Greg can’t come. He is listed to give evidence in court in a manslaughter prosecution, which interests Sherlock enormously until Greg explains it was a driving matter.
All of John Watson’s muscles grew quite tense. “WHAT?” What the hell is a Woodsman?”
“Is there anything I can do?”
They sit with her for some time, watching as she weeps.
His climax starts as a speck out on the horizon that comes towards him at a glacial pace, swelling gradually and then bearing down on him like the heaviest clouds. He draws his knees up but still the hand is still slow, so slow as the tiny vessels contract and squeeze inside him and he looks to Sherlock who is watching with adoring eyes and fuck, oh fuck, he tips his face back as he's caught in the extraordinary storm that Sherlock has conjured. It's relentless and lights up along every nerve ending, he feels like he will come for hours. When the lights start to die he looks up at Sherlock smiling; his heart splits and he falls so deeply in love he is certain he will never find his way out.
He kills four young people, all drug users, all tattooed with a phone number. Where are we with the phone intercepts, incidentally?"
Billy is regarding Sherlock with great compassion.
"Lie down," Sherlock says and his voice is beautiful, liquid and warm like butter and sugar when they meet over heat and turn to caramel. John settles in the soft fabrics, his lips parted slightly, closing his eyes at the thought of Sherlock's good hand setting him to rights.
Organised as ever, he's laid out the few items he'll carry with him: one hundred and twenty pounds in notes, his GMC card in one back pocket and his Army warrant in the other, his gun, disengaged for the time being and tucked down the back of his trousers.
“You want to ask her about the army, I expect.”
And every day, while John Watson walked farther and farther away, our case got colder.
The Doctor assumed his calm, military face. “He’s dressed like John because he has great dress sense.”
“Where did you meet Mr Holmes?”
She makes some brief notes in her notebook, using her smallest handwriting and the most cryptic shorthand she can manage. John watches briefly and gives up when he realises he won't be reading his notes upside down again.
"Ah. Then I'll need a suture trolley," John says to no one in particular.
And there'd be some shade and soft sand somewhere.
“I bought them. These are our flowers.”
That night at dinner, Sherlock waxes lyrical about his sister to his parents. He tells the story of the daring girl pirate who allowed he and Redbeard to join her fantastic boat, and how Mycroft was made walk the plank three times before she decided to spare him.
“What?”
Oceans go on forever.
"What are you two doing down there?"
“Will you be coming back?”
“It’s deceptive,” he called from the kitchen where he was making tea. “It seems like litres but in reality it’s only about a  teaspoons’ worth.”
“He was a late bloomer.”
John clasped the wandering hand and laughed. “Yeah, you being romantic. Chance would be a fine thing.”
"I work for my thelf."
It's been a long time since any thing so pretty has been in his life. He takes a photo of it on his phone, and then another. While he's staring at the photo, and feeling keenly the lack of any colour in his life, and understanding that at this rate, things are going to continue being black and white, it occurs to him what he actually wants and how achieving that is really very simple.
She looks at it along time before starting tentatively on the left drumstick.
Albion was pleased to see we’d lightened up and joined in the laughter.
“He moved in pretty much the next day,” Sherlock remembers. “But he went on a case with me first.”
A few days later Sherlock is beaming at his laptop, his face illuminated by the glow of the screen.
"He's with me, Detective Donovan. If you have a problem with that, take it up with Detective Inspector Lestrade who invited me here."
The real test, though, was to see if Albion was prepared to use it.
The London squirrels want to feature
Sherlock waited patiently for romance to blossom. He had no idea how to start a relationship but had complete faith in John doing that because John knows those kinds of things. He can plaster broken limbs, fix loose hinges and conceal small lethal pieces of metal in his trousers. John, Sherlock was certain,  would surely know how to initiate the first kiss and get them underway to a lifetime of cosy late night cuddling, blissful comforting oral sex and occasional frottage in the shower.  Sherlock could wait.
John knew it was intended as light hearted, an in-joke for them both, but its affect was serious.
“We could both be the pussycat. You could be a bob cat.”
Good work! I'll collect it tomorrow afternoon.
"Personnel. It's near accounts!"
“Me?” John laughs. “I can hold my own with a bloody squirrel.”
Living with a very strict and efficient nanny enabled us to settle into a routine. Albion and I had breakfast together and after I finished files for the day, we’d take a walk together. I liked the exercise out in the heart of London, and Albion liked being held close under my coat. I would stop when ever I found something brightly coloured that he might enjoy looking at, and for any animals, because I wanted him to know as soon as possible that we are just one animal amongst a whole range of species. When we got home he’d have a bath, taste the water, then slurp one last bottle before bed.
“You can’t stop coming here, John. I hate that I’ve made a place that’s so much a part of our lives into somewhere you dread. So I’m changing it. You won’t think of this place as the place where I died anymore. In future whenever you see or think of St Barts you’ll remember it as the place your idiot flat mate brought you to tell you that he loves you.”
He likes the sensation very much.
He also sat through his first violin recital, when I played Mozart’s variations of Ah Vous, Dirais-je, Maman for him while he lay in his cot. John Watson correctly identified this as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
There's the hand coming down to strike the throat of the only person who has treated John with understanding in the long, empty months since he's come home.
“I liked your poem,” John says into his mug.
"So you were going to commit some serious self harm?"
John shrugs his shoulders as he  leans over one of the boxes, searching through the files which will be the 25th, 26th and 27th that he will read.
“That doesn’t mean they don’t need to know.  What? It’s actually extremely interesting.” He is unblinking, earnest, utterly guileless and for a second John is filled with crippling, protective love.
"They all had this nine-digit number tattooed on their left arm?"
Male or female?
Sherlock is less impressed.
She discusses the little household with Mrs Turner.
Because my life is never normal and never just one thing at a time, our new relationship was the least of our problems when I woke up a few hours later. John was leaning over me, one finger pressed to his lips to keep me quiet. It was raining very heavily and there were noises in the kitchen.
"And I thought it was a pity."
To alleviate the stress, John creates scenarios where he treats the wounds himself. He imagines making a poultice, cleaning the grit from each stripe of shattered skin, preparing bandages and devising a plan for pain management so that the wounds would heal quickly and with minimum discomfort.
so it is important that I keep my John fed.
So Mummy stayed an extra two weeks, and spent as much time every day as she could with Eurus, who already was blooming like an open meadow of early spring flowers. It was extraordinary to watch, and the young mother felt deep regret and guilt that she had not grasped the extent of Eurus gifts, and failed to nurse them properly. She tortured herself, thinking how she might redress her oversight.
“Show you how to do it,” said the nurse, who was apparently too tired to even use complete sentences. He adjusted my baby in my arms and demonstrated how to hold the bottle correctly so that my boy drank faux milk and not air.
"A group of us go down to the pub on Friday nights. You should come! Do you like a drink?"
“Happily ever after. Obviously.”
I was in agony. The wound was being drained, I was being given huge doses of antibiotics that were making me nauseous but I was being treated on the hospital’s Drug Addict Pain Management guidelines, which mean analgesics every six hours and nothing more. I was probably withdrawing  somewhat too.
John tries again. “They were interesting things to say.”
anyone found her purse?"
That night as I buttoned Albion in to his loungewear, I thought about Mrs Hudson assuring me that I would be a good father, and her unshakable faith that John Watson would return. Logically I could dissect that view, but emotionally it had made me so happy, that someone thought I could parent adequately and that John would come home. Those happy thoughts ensured I slept quite soundly until 2.37am, when Albion roared at me for sleeping while he was hungry.
"Explain what?" Sherlock is about to launch in to a tirade of petulance but the Detective Inspector is immobile.
“I wouldn’t rule it out.”
The stranger distils the most pertinent aspects of his current dilemma into as few words as possible. "I'm in a hurry,"
We had never come close,  John Watson and I, to sorting out what we actually were.
"Yeah, I read about that."
"On my bed? Seriously?"
(Obviously the last part of that statement was directed at Albion, who was happy to drool on either.)
The crib was fun. I had to put that together myself. I love those slips of paper with directions that tell you how to put all the pieces together. I set it next to the couch so we could sleep side by side.
“No. I appreciate that you’re curious but I’d rather not talk about it now.” Sherlock hates withholding, hates denying John such important intelligence and scrapes around his ever sorry heart for compensation. “Maybe another time when it’s more of a memory.”
All police hate this request. Sometimes a body shouldn’t be seen.
Then he feels John’s hands, flat and covered in cool cream, gently smoothing over the scars, stroking the welts as if he could, if he were careful, make them disappear.
"I'm not worked up. I just don't get it."
“Is this a story?”
Sherlock continues to pester John about his speech for the entire two months leading up to their wedding. When he is not pestering John, he pesters every single person who is invited to the wedding, all of whom have been instructed expressly not to assist him.
“Caroline! Lovely to see you. I see you’ve met Sherlock.”
“Why?”
“He’s just walking me through some very basic aspects of gay relationships that I would know if I had relationships like everyone else. We’re not breaking any laws and I’m not being defiled.”
“Every hospital notifies social services if they think the child might be at risk. Two drug using parents are a fairly standard reason for a flagging.”
“Not even I can work that out. So we’re having a story. The Colony of Cats.”
He is standing in the blissfully quiet kitchen, taking mouthfuls of coffee while he checks his itemized list. A few minutes ago he spoke to Michelle at reception and told her some plausible story about having a virus.
“Where am I?” Eurus asks.
It seemed there were things I loved about John that I couldn’t see or hear. Secret things.
John tried to conjure an image of a bobcat but with no success. “Are they as cool as jaguars?”
Greg can see a myriad of problems sprouting like weeds on the day before him, but here’s Mycroft, dressed impeccably, and privately thrilled that his timing on this morning is so precise.
“Oh! So the Prince liked to deduce things. Did he want to become a consulting detective?”
“Is she a qualified nanny?”
Mycroft bought my parents twice. They were monumentally disappointed in me, as they had been as far back as I can remember, and were also determined to assure me that they were entirely forgiving of me, and at great personal cost.
“No. But who does, before they actually have one? In any case, friends and my brother have ably supported me. And there’s a wealth of information on the internet. And Albion is exceptional but no different from any other human, in that he needs to be fed and rested and kept clean. Also, he is extraordinarily gifted in communication. Just a couple of days ago he stared quite meaningfully at Doctor Watson’s breakfast to indicate to us that he was ready to eat solid foods. Some adults are unable to make their wishes so clear.”
“Neither do we,” John answers.
The front door slams, which means the warlock and his woman are home and the thumping is likely to start any minute. Rhonda rushes into the laundry hamper and this startles the mouse, who flies off the bed and runs with remarkable speed to the skirting board.
While John wandered around in the near dark, Lestrade pulled out a pocket torch and threw a small white beam over the first row of containers.
Case closed. Now John can focus on the poem.
Sherlock shakes his head. "Everybody see things. That just don't pay attention. I observe everything. There's a difference. Do you want to go to the hospital and steal the cat back?"
“Yes, she did. You know what kids are like, they’ll come with you when you answer the door. She  - Julia, I mean, - was only there for a couple of minutes, just long enough to tell me my husband and she were having an affair, and he was moving in with her.” Mrs Best sighs and shrugs. “She more or less forced his hand, and he left not long after that.”
"Detective Inspector. It's perfectly alright. He's with me."
For his masculinity is there in his broad shoulders.
“You couldn’t have texted this, Detective Inspector?”
The secret Watson smile, the one he reserves for Albion and me, surfaced. “I like dogs. Wish we had room for one here.”
“You know John, I think we could be very happy.”
John laughs softly. "Yes, actually I am." He takes Sherlock's left hand, studies the palm with its blood crusted bark right across the centre and rubs it tenderly with the print of his thumb. "You won't be using this hand to get me off because it's grazed from your fall tonight. I should have put gauze on that. Sorry. This hand though," and he kisses the centre of Sherlock's right palm. "looks more than capable."
In any case neither Amarita nor her mostly wordless mate bothered replacing the plates. There were just so many other things.
Mycroft, as always, is one step ahead of the investigation.
“True. Well, I don’t know, wait until I get home and I’ll see if I can talk him around.”
"Yes."
Molly makes absent chit chat with Sherlock, but takes special note of the way he looks at John.
A hot flare of affection bursts in his belly when he opens it, for Sherlock has not only inspected the slim anthology, he’s added a new poem:
“I beg your pardon,” Mummy said stiffly.
A polite, satisfied crunching sound is all that is heard from Mycroft’s corner.
John was silent. He knew this part very well.
He moves over the bed on his knees, opens the flip top lid with his teeth and squeezes heavy cool puddles of hair conditioner over John’s cock and belly.
"Mrs Hudson! Once again you have improved the quality of my life immeasurably. I can't thank you enough."
All around him is grey and opaque with no signal that it will get any better. Quite suddenly he decides he just doesn't want to do any of it any more and there is not one good reason why he has to.
And what is awful
“What am I going to do with balloons?”
John is visiting a nice town house in Brent's Cross. It could be perfect, because the second bedroom is at the back of the house on the ground floor and looks out on to the garden. Out here no one would hear him screaming.
“Oh, yes. Definitely your poof.”
He stares down each boy for a few satisfying seconds, lets his steel gaze fall on the ringleader and watches the boy’s reaction before he lets him have it.
“Oh. Well, in the morning, John or I change him and he has breakfast with us. He likes a bottle and more recently, stewed plums. Then he has a bath and I dress him. He has a nanny, who lives downstairs, and she cares for him during the day and I generally work on cases, so I can visit whenever I want. When he’s a little older I will probably be out more, but only on weekdays. We have lunch together. The nanny finishes at four in the afternoon, and then we have a walk. Albion likes the park and is particularly keen to see birds and dogs.  Sometimes I show him leaves and recently have been explaining photosynthesis to him. We have dinner when we return home. As I explained, he’s just started on solid foods. The nanny has made him some custards and bought some bottled foods but I’m not sure if he’ll eat the bottled food yet.”
Sherlock puts the phone on speaker and the three of them huddle around. The person who answers has a voice webbed with contempt and phlegm.
“We read your  name in the police file. I know you gave a statement, but there are a few things we hoped to clarify “ -
"Is that a mobile phone?" John asks.
"Hello," he says to the gathered crowd but there is no response.
separate from him
We laughed again. I didn’t know if I should undo his flies, or mine, or what to do, so I left it for the time being and enjoyed the access he allowed me to his chest.
“First class honours in Natural Science and I did some post graduate research in pharmacology.”
“No idea. They showed Lestrade when he was trying to track down the mother.  He confiscated the phone and deleted it.”
“Oh! Hello! Why are you here?” John has finished work and is surprised to see Sherlock waiting for him.
“Thank you. Now, I have to ask you one more important question.”
“Oo,” Albion said. He was quite impressed to see the purple fish swinging, so John tapped it again.
He looks around the strange room with the cheap furniture. Another person, also who's name John doesn't know, asks if he's okay. Yes, he assures them, I'm fine.
I ran my hands over the veins in his arms, looking for the rage. He responded by drawing me a little closer, inviting me into his warmth and mouth, bumping his body against me as he loosened my clothes.
Molly
I’d hope Lestrade’s failure to keep up would mark the end of the day’s lunacy, but I’m never so lucky. On the plus side, I noted John Watson was brimming with baby confidence.
That evening, John and Sherlock pore over the file once again. Rosie is asleep in John’s old bed in the Big’s Girl’s room.
When we got home, I sent John down stairs to collect Albion, who no doubt had slept through our absence, making sure he was in optimum condition to cry loud and aimlessly until sunrise.
John looks around him, still unsmiling under the darkening sky. The cold is imposing as he steps forward and wraps his arms around Sherlock tightly with no words, and when Sherlock carefully returns the embrace John lifts his face and kisses him deeply, and with great feeling.
"Is he a friend of yours?"
It seems they're in short supply.
Later that evening, I got a text from the Detective Inspector, telling me that he’d dropped by to give me a postcard sent to him by Two Hemispheres Watson. Apparently my mesmerising son distracted him from his task completely.  I’m happy to say the card was from Singapore, where the wandering doctor had visited Changi Prison. That would have had huge significance for John. Once again I wished I could have been there in the humidity with him. It would be fascinating to hear his impressions.
“Yeah, but …well, I knew what she was. After she shot you the first time, I knew everything, even without knowing, if that makes sense.”
She makes that little half snigger again. "Well, I know he loves skin diseases, so I keep a look out for him. One of these has particularly corroded fingernails."
“Nail what to the door of the Town Hall? A big sign that says Holmes and Watson are boyfriends?”
“Very well. We’ve just started.”
Only one way to find out.
Lestrade hates this part, when Sherlock works it out and then flies out the door.
"Every day."
He shakes his head. “No. Not really in the mood. I might go for a walk, I think.”
“Sorry, I’m nearly ready! I just have to try and get Toby settled - he’s never like this!” she wailed when she answered the door.
Sherlock dusts his Prada trousers with careful hands. "Executions," he says crisply. "Simple, effective executions."
“Well, based on the scant details Ms Bannister supplied, I’ve put aside 12 for you because they’re female children. A couple of those could also be parental abductions.” Sherlock sighs, and wanders over to Rosie, who has another puzzle to put together. “People are such liars, aren’t they Watson?”
“No. It’s a letter asking me to contribute to some alumnae fund.”
Mycroft wants more details on the client. “So will you and my brother chase the ghost?”
focused, and turns left onto the main road.
"I don't want them to pay me. It smacks of corruption and gives lie to the possibility that evidence can be uncovered for money. Any defence barrister with the brains God gave a goat would then be able to provide reasonable doubt on any case I was involved in."
“Oh Christ,” Sherlock says over and over in hot breaths.
“Yes, of course there’s National Bee Unit. Bees are an intrinsically important part of the food chain and ecology. The Bee Unit did an enormous amount of research centred around insecticides so the Prince did some very basic analysis work.”
Albion wore a very attractive and warm one piece jump suit. There were trains on the arms. I’d added a hat and little knitted shoes that actually looked like socks. I didn’t have any mittens for him, but I did have an excellent sleeping bag that zipped up and made him look exactly like cricket larvae.
Scotland Yard gave the story to the press a couple of days after the body was recovered. They hoped someone might come forward but no one did.
Sherlock makes a note of that too.
“Yes. Tired.”
My mother rolled her eyes, mouthed HE WAS JEALOUS at me in a very theatrical way and then set about leaning over my father so she could snatch Albion back.
It falls on John like a slammed door, and in his darkness he reaches over to Sherlock, and kisses him long and deeply.
Albion got a clean bill of health and Doctor Watson signed the blue form with a flourish. That should have been the end of the visit but Ms Powers was determined to make sure that today would not be a complete waste of time.
There was nothing, apparently, that seemed difficult for her. She was curious, asked excellent questions and showed no fear of any topic. She absorbed information the way the ocean might take a ship.
John, whose longest relationship clocks in at just under eight months, has slept on a total of seven floors in four different countries. Five, if you include Wales.
John grips the uninjured side of Sherlock's face with his right hand and moves it a few inches away from his mouth. Sherlock freezes at the interruption; cold terror floods his belly, the horrible thought that he's misjudged once again and done entirely the wrong thing to his guest.
“No. The street was empty.”
“I hired you a nanny so you’d have expert care at your disposal whenever you needed to attend any case. It would have taken you just a few minutes to drop Albion in with Anya.”
"Bye Bob." Sherlock, never one for sedatives, is already out the door. Bob watches the handsome navy suit disappear into the crowds.
Still nothing.
Sherlock has wrapped the cutlery in little napkins, which he also stole from Mrs Hudson. English gentlemen both, they set the napkins awkwardly over their laps.
“What are you reading?”
They kiss over and over, coddled by London in each direction.
For a moment he can barely answer. "Afghanistan. How could you possibly know that?"
I had to nip this in the bud immediately.
"Wait, she's a spy?"
John, the evidence suggested, actually wasn’t inclined to love Sherlock, at least not in the manner Sherlock desired.
all because he thinks of me
“Of course,” the child replies. “Are we having a talk or some affection?”
“No one cares,” John hisses at him.
I’m here and have no clients. Come on over.
Jenny looks around to Sherlock, who is apparently absorbed in his experiment.
The waiting room is full of tired, unwell people. They are not John's problem at this moment, although he feels like he's on a bit of a roll now and would very much like to check each and everyone, to be certain that there are no cases that should be rushed through triage.
Clean.
John nods and answers best he can, his smile stretched and false, everything inside of him cold and dead.
For he holds it carefully everyday.
"Well, I rather ..." but Sherlock thinks the better of it. Billy, though, can hear the pain in Sherlock’s voice.
My limited expectations were useful. We both turned out to be much greater idiots than we realised when it came to having sex.
It grates John. He lays awake in bed at night, reliving Mary, reliving Moriarty, reliving all the people who have tried to wrench he and Sherlock apart.
I love you too.
“The child’s fallen, is unconscious, and Julia has panicked like any normal person would. Unfortunately, rather than try and get help, she has thought only of herself and concealed the child as quickly as possible. She’s brought her here, and probably thought she could keep her hidden until she woke up. I’d wager she checked her a couple of times, and then realised she was dead – and that she had got away with it.”
Some of the gang members had been arrested. Some, I deduced, had already fled the country, and one was currently being pursued around London.
“If you have called me to try yet again to extract information about John’s speech, you’re wasting your time,” Mycroft sniffs.
"Exactly, He breaks the bottle somewhere else, and is armed with it when he gets here.
He is living in the sex house. Charlotte and the Warlock never stop. John hears furniture thumping and rattling in the unmistakable rhythm & wails of copulation in the morning, in the evening, in the middle of the day on Saturdays when he just wants to do his washing, at night when he is watching videos of soldiers coming home to their teary families and hysterical dogs on You Tube, in the middle of the night when he might be having a small stretch of purposeful sleep unaffected by nightmares.
Sherlock is hyperactive. He bounces in the car, narrowly missing John twice with his flaying hands, stretches his long lean torso around to yell at Greg as closely as he can.
John Watson, first in his class in anatomy for two years running, has realised his life has come to a complete standstill. He's walking back to the tube after therapy, pondering the insurmountable wall he seems wedged up against these days. His leg hurts, his hand shudders uncontrollably, he can't sleep unless the light is on, he never has a night of unbroken sleep, he can't adjust to civilian life, he is bored to the core. It's going to be like this forever.
“What did you do before you had babies?”
He liked order, he liked neatness, he liked neutral colours. He liked to think that he would share something with a partner, that they would meet on gradient where their tastes and interests intersected. Shona was in someone else's graph.
And of course Molly came.
The change in John's body is instant; his muscles tense, he sits up on his elbow, his face turned away in shame.
There’s bread and wine and the bouillabaisse is rich and tasty. They talk about the ailments John’s seen today and a case Sherlock has been reading about, one that he thinks John should join him on tomorrow.
John, Albion and I faced her, and John extended his hand. “Thank you. For everything. I wish you all the best with – well, with the next babies.”
“He has supper at about eight, and then sleeps for a couple of hours, then he likes to cry for most of the night.”
I took 23 photos, all of him.
“The definition of bisexuality has been corroded in popular usage to be synonymous with promiscuity and unfaithfulness, but that is ignorant and preposterous. I can’t fathom why people assume that choosing from a mixed pool of potential partners automatically causes infidelity when bisexual people are no less committed to lasting relationships than heterosexual or homosexual people.”
For he chased away the cold in me.
“Well, Ted does make the best chips. He uses olive oil to fry them, which accounts the extraordinary flavour.  His father was Greek, of course, and a great cook. I think the quality of the chips is also enhanced by the fact they’re hand cut and not mass produced” –
It’s incredibly alluring, his simmering rage.
“What he said,” Adrienne confirmed.
He was still wide awake in the same bundled position at four forty-three the next morning. He had concluded nothing more except that he loved John, was pained by this love and wanted more than anything to remain John’s best friend as long as he could, before he was usurped by the next dangerous woman who would drive John to despair as easily as Mary had.
2. John was privately comfortable with his bisexuality and had acted on it.
When Rosie returns, she is cranky and in need of a nap. John has read twenty four files, and put three on the possible pile. They tell tragic stories, and have made him very vulnerable to any threat to Rosie’s happiness and wellbeing. Sherlock watches as John cooes and soothes the grumpy child as best he can, taking her to what used to be his room but is now called the big girl’s room. She is asleep before John gets to the stairs.
“We can always do this another time,” Ademar reassures. “Go to your case, and come and see me tomorrow.”
What kind of dog is John Watson?
“You’re okay with that? You don’t – you’re not worried you might want to keep one?”
“Did you get it looked at by a doctor?”
He turns to sneer at the wall - which will get it come uppence one day - and is blown clear across the room.
For he can apply a poultice.
“Because his mother and father went there and he was too bigger idiot to break out on his own. So he went to Cambridge and continued the patterns he had established as child – no friends and being an insufferable swot who got all his assignments in on time. No wonder all the kids hated him.”
“Yes,” says Eurus. “My intelligence is matched by my capacity to love and be loved, and my empathy. I get frustrated when I feel unloved. Are you going to show me a home movie?”
“No. I am painfully aware of that, and frankly still hurt. But I figured you wanted me to read them, and the recipients were willing to let me keep them, either out of pity or kindness.”
“Well. Teenagers love storming off in sulks and slamming doors. They like it even better when they can stamp up stairs and then slam the door. It annoys their parents more and makes more noise.”
Good excuse, Sherlock notes.
One Wednesday evening John had come home from work but didn’t fossick in the kitchen and didn’t lean over Sherlock’s shoulder to see why he had twenty eight feathers laid out in order of size on the table. Instead John rushed into the shower and washed with haste under very hot water before bounding up the stairs to don his best trousers and neatest shirt.
“Consulting?” little Sherlock asks his brother. “How does he mean ‘consulting’? Aren’t all doctors consulted?”
John skips the rest of phone notes and flicks deeper into the file, where he finds the original transcripts of statements and interviews. The child’s father, Robert Best (possibly estranged from the mother) is first, then his mistress, Julia, then the child’s mother, Corinne Best.
“USELESS? Excuse me?”
We both laughed, this time because we were both so pathetic. John apologized again.
"What? Got what?"
John shudders inwardly. “How did you get away?”
I can’t tell you anything more about those visits because I deleted them as soon as they left.
Greg is astonished by the case, and the way it fits in with the client’s dreams.
"Why would I say so if I wasn't? Would you like to live here?"
“Why?”
Eurus, who is happier than she had ever known, agrees immediately.
Greg takes charge. “Thank you for seeing us, Mrs Best.  My name is Greg Lestrade, and this is Sherlock Homes and Dr John Watson. I’m sorry that we don’t have any news,  but like the police liaison said, we do revisit cold cases, and we want to see if there is anything you can tell us that might help us as we review this case.”
He had a series of faces to relay different emotions and requirements. A tiny, pouting lip meant he was genuinely sad and wanted me to hold him while simultaneously pacing the floor and telling him something interesting. A small frown met he was about to wail because he wanted his pants changed immediately. Raising his little fists meant he was frustrated and about to cry because I wasn’t holding him and providing him with comforting body warmth. Closed eyes and a still face meant he had just drunk another two hundred millilitres of formula and wanted to sleep, preferably in my arms while I reclined.
He slips out alone and starts walking towards the tape where Sergeant Donovan is still standing.
“Oh Sherlock! Now where did you get that?”
"What garbage. I bet some cow-eyed double-speak therapist told you that."
Adrienne refused point blank to feed our son. This created an enormous stand-off between Adrienne, the midwife and the extremely tired nurse who had been present at the birth. The midwife wanted Adrienne to breastfeed, the nurse said it didn’t matter and that no one should be forced to do anything they didn’t want to. Adrienne swore at them, made a impolite gesture with one finger  before pulling the sheet over head and sighing loudly when the discussion extended beyond thirty seconds.
A familiar yellow light on a lumbering black cab is heading towards them; John stretches out his arm and whistles loudly and distinctly.
“Expecting what? Soft pubic hair or sex?”
For his pasta is al dente always.
"I suppose I should encourage you to talk it over with your therapist. Although you've not seen them in the last few months."
Rosie is carefully eating a small bowl of porridge with a bright blue plastic spoon. She hears their voices, and the familiarity they share is comforting. She likes porridge, and she likes the way Sherlock makes it. The day is starting on a happy note for her.
All the electrical whirring noises my thinking generates had been reduced to a tiny buzz at that stage and I felt very calm.
John is closing the last stitch. It's a lot to take in, so instead he steps back to observe his handiwork and for a tiny second is thrilled with the neatness and speed of his work. He's missed all it so much. "I just have to dress this."
“Don’t,” he cautions himself. “Do something practical. Wash dishes. Do a load of laundry.”
John looks down at his notes. He hasn’t admitted it yet, but he believes her.
“Tomorrow,” John Watson said again. “We’ll talk about post cards tomorrow.“
"What else?" Lestrade says, but Sherlock's already off.
“Well, invite them along. I’m about to get Mycroft to make sure we can get entry to the site.”
He wants to answer I don't, I was just on my way to commit suicide and he got hit by a scooter in front of me, but instead John shrugs his shoulders. The world's changed a lot in the last couple of hours and he's still surging with adrenaline.
“I intend to. Thank you, Judge.”
“Precisely. When our man doesn’t hear from the victim, he’s going to start looking for him.” Sherlock kneels down again and searches through the dead man’s coat. “Mobile – oh, look at that. Five messages already.” Sherlock reads them in a singsong voice. “ ‘U OK mate’, ‘call me asap’ ‘call me you twat’ – there’s your manslaughter suspect. Start with hospitals closest to here, because that’s where he’ll be looking. And while some of you are arresting him, the rest of you can start going through all those containers. Look for the ones with the most locks and fixtures, maybe even container s within containers, because that’s where the money will be.”
On this dull Tuesday morning a very glamorous older woman holding a box from a local patisserie, accompanied by an unbelievable wild-haired older man who clutched a mobile phone, stood at their front door.
“Are you afraid? First Redbeard, then Dr Watson, now perhaps your son all being taken from you?”
I admired his spirit. I wished more than once that Three Pairs of Brogues Watson could meet him.
"It's only for a while, and then you'll be in a fantastic hospital where you can walk wherever you want and everyone will love you." She's not convinced and miaows louder. Out of here NOW, Captain!
After I watched all the Toby videos I asked her to play them all again because I knew that would make her happy, and I wish fervently that Molly will always be happy.
The midwife looked at me suspiciously. She worked two jobs and was caring for an elderly parent.
She turned and smiled stiffly. “Captain John.”
John Watson is possibly the one person in the world who isn’t at all frightened of Mycroft, and I think this explains why Mycroft likes John.
Something was wrong. I had a painful sickness that stretched from my gullet to my pubic bone. My skin was hot and damp, my hands shook, the lining of my mouth was dry as paper. It would be hours before I realised that for the first time in my life, I had been literally scared rigid.
It wasn't her cold beauty that, in certain lights, became a soft, heart breaking prettiness. It wasn't that she threatened to do him twice without mercy because frankly people had offered before and he's not all that interested. His prerequisites for anyone who wants to do him twice with or without mercy are very specific and at this point in history have not been matched in their entirety by anyone.
Eurus is silent. This is all news to her. She watches, in the next scene, Mycroft and Sherlock at the big velvet couch, each waiting to have their first cuddle with their new baby sister. “They look very happy to see me, “ Eurus says, “They – “ and then she goes quiet, as little Sherlock, who had been stepping foot to foot in his excitement, sits up still and straight on the couch in grave expectation, his little arms extended as Papa carefully places the baby in his arms and on his lap. Mycroft is close by and assists. The little boy looks closely at his baby sister, looks up to Uncle Rudy and can be seen to say, she’s beautiful, and looks down to again in unadulterated wonder. Rudy moves the camera in a little closer and captures Sherlock carefully kissing the baby’s forehead, who then opens her eyes and looks at him. Sherlock’s response is pure and heartfelt, and he looks to Mycroft and then his father, and then to Rudy, clearly thrilled at this first recognition.
The patient is interested to see where this is going, gives him the smallest of his most natural
No I work. Can you come this afternoon.
Ms Powers watched us both with a sour face. I deduced that she was annoyed at having been sent on a wild goose chase.
That’s John Watson! The Woodsman! I mouthed at Albion.
Neither of us knew how to respond. It was too shocking. The more we thought about it, the more ludicrous it seemed.
Sherlock wanted John’s full attention. He fidgeted a little, rolled over one way, rolled over the other and then pushed himself into John’s arms.
A few weeks earlier he had mentioned to Mike Stamford that he would like a flatmate. Because Mike likes to help, and because he likes crosswords, Sherlock sought to make the quest challenging and a little sad by adding that no one would want to live with him. It was a waste of human endeavour because Mike hadn't come up with anyone. Sherlock was pretty certain that he didn't even try.
John watches him closely. He doesn’t need Sherlock’s skills of observation to see that Greg is smitten. Perhaps an outing like this could be the perfect opportunity to advance a happy coupling.
"Well, I'm not surprised. It's fascinating."
“Do I have to pick a side?” Sherlock wonders.
While he was in the bathroom he figured he may as well have a shower too. While he showered he wondered exactly how much water his hair would hold when it was soaking wet and how he might accurately measure that. He marked that interesting inquiry with a mental post it note and then wondered how many people are injured in bathrooms each year, and what the most common injury might be. He concluded that taps would be the main culprit while conceding that most people would automatically assume glass.
John smiles. “Can I assume you believe in ghosts?”
But it isn't. His misery seems to be rising, a horrible cold current of ill will and black skies and a promise that nothing will ever be good again.
“Oh, you’d be surprised. Shut up and listen. The Prince loved puzzles and loved working things out. His mother, who had been a very talented mathematician before she was lumbered with babies, taught him to do sums at a very early age, and taught him how to find the answer by eliminating the false.”
“I collected them over the last couple of days, all except the swan.” He holds up a long elegant feather the exact shade as shaved ice. “Professor Cowan gave me that one last week. He had some spare swallow feathers too, but I was actually able to get a couple of them myself. Have you ever seen a swallow’s nest, John? They’re an engineering marvel, considering they’re made almost wholly with their beaks.”
"Car's downstairs."
John, who once revived a dead man in an emergency room by instigating a desperate median sternotomy and throwing warm water over his still heart, is deteriorating rapidly.
John turns his face calmly and nods. "I'll have you in and out of there in 75 minutes." And he smiles. The stranger stares.
"I was, yes."
Molly
“It’s just so strange,” Jenny continues. “I feel like now I know her. The flat just feels so different now.”
“I only ask because you’ve never been in a live-in type relationship and I’ve been worried that it might be a bit strange for you.”
“Did the doctor tell you?” Eurus asks, eyes still fixed to the screen.
"Okay, maybe you can't practice medicine but you can still do meaningful work." John scoffs in his heart. "Doing what?"
The pain was gone. Sherlock showed no obvious after effects of his illness. He was, he was certain, more healthy than he had ever been. John Watson made good on his commitment – Sherlock really was the happiest gay man in London.
For the first time Sherlock smiles naturally as he stares into his tea. “Yes. He’s very handsome. His features are very even, and they all denote intelligence – high wide forehead, ears set above the line of his eye brows, thick eye brows too, very clear eyes, wide mouth, strong nose, and fair hair. And he’s in very good condition – broad chest, strong legs.”
The rest of the autopsy reveals a perfectly healthy child. There are no more indications of harm.
Perhaps in hindsight I bought too many baby things. I had no idea what I was doing, and reasoned that it was better to have eight bottles and four blankets with matching pillows than being snowed in some bleak night with a freezing hungry baby and have nothing.
John crept into the rumpled bed beside her, under the thin sheets and moved over towards the warmth of her skin to slip his arms around her ribs and to his surprise he felt peppery little tears spring to his eyes because he has not understood, until he felt this close embrace against his naked skin, how horribly alone he is every hour of the day. The wretchedness of his life is suddenly unavoidable. He wants comfort, and now is willing to do just about anything or anyone to have it even for a few harshly lit minutes.
The dog is led around the yard, but finds nothing. Sherlock suggests that perhaps she is buried under the concrete slab that is now parking for two or three cars, but John consults the plans and sees the slab was put in place in 1969.
A short time later Sherlock is still on his knees, pressing soft kisses against the deflating penis and rubbing his lips gently on the foreskin. John combs the thick curls with his fingers and smiles with great contentment. He feels handsome, admired, immersed in love, all these things separately and tangled at once.
Sherlock takes a couple of shy steps towards him, perhaps summoning his nerve. "Make yourself at home," he suggests and John watches him carefully, nods just once so very slightly. Sherlock pushes him up against the wall and kisses him hard and gracelessly.
Corinne welcomes the party into her little flat. It is clean, scrupulously clean, and neat. Sherlock immediately smells cleaning agents and air freshener and soap. John can see only one closed door – probably the bedroom, which leads to a bathroom.
John gives him simple instructions. Put your arms up, that ‘s right. Lay still. I’m not going to hurt you.
“But don’t get frightened. The Woodsman had a very good heart, and once they got to the woods he told the Snow White to run away, because he knew there were some little people – dwarves is the archaic medical term for their condition – who lived in a cottage on the other side of the woods.
“Well, maybe she told her that she was going to see daddy.,” Greg suggests as he locks the car. “That would have calmed her down.”
“No, no,” said Mycroft, ever the public servant. “The public have a right to expect that their taxes fund a competent agency that will ensure child safety is a top priority.”
They asked if I wanted to attend the birth, which was a stupid question. Of course I didn’t want to. One of the nurses glared at me and said “Aren’t you the father?”  and I said “Probably not.” Then she glared at me as if I was the world’s worse liar (which is wrong – I am a GREAT liar) so I went in reluctantly.
“What did you imagine?”
“No it isn’t. If you were any kind of doctor you would have seen I was in pain, made a pass at me and not taken Bosomy Rose to the hear Vivaldi. Incidentally, did you do that to annoy me?”
“I want to go here,” John says to the taxi driver, leaning in the window and showing him Ademar Silver’s business card.
"And you gather all your clues just by looking at things?"
They grow in Eden.
Sally keeps her lips pressed tight until she’s regained her composure and can speak civilly. “How did he die?”
“What about the girlfriend? Julia?” Sherlock asks.
I'm a cripple. I'm broken. I wanted to die.
He  holds  Sherlock's  shoulder  for  balance  when he's  finishes,  gently squeezing the  thick muscles there.
As Sherlock is wheeled away John calls out to him with true concern. "I'm just out here!"
I scooped Albion up and headed to my front door, to see Mrs Hudson, unsmiling, bringing the two women to me.
“The day after he came home from hospital.”
“Are you serious?”
Sherlock looks up, his face on the edge of a smile he is trying very hard to suppress. "Really?"
“Will you sit on my lap?”
“I have a baby.”
Sherlock looks up sharply. “Mitral stenosis?”
“I might,” although it was as plain as the noses on our faces that John Watson was desperate to talk military things with Anya. “Does she come today?”
“Yes I’m going and yes I know about Rugby.”
“Oh! Oh my God! He’s the living of you! Marina, come and see Sherlock’s baby!”
Our second attempt at congress was only a little more successful than the first. We used the shower this time, which was actually quite uncomfortable but very funny because it was so inelegant. Our height difference didn’t assist matters, but John Watson insisted that the best part of having sex with some one you love is that it’s with someone you love, and even if you’re being blinded by shower spray and certain you’re both about to slip over and break your back.
"You have to be a Libra." Colin is leaning over towards him, hands clasped together tightly. He smells like oats.
It's not such a bad thing. I should have done it months ago.
For I like my doctors clean shaven.
Of the finest silk so that I may be visited with Watson pleasure.
“No. Although I have to say, I think we’re maybe making a bit better now.”
Years of an ever warm unmade bed
"No, I'm very pleased with everything. Thank you."
“Approximately?”
It is a source of grief to me that Molly harbours hopes that I may some day turn out to be normal and court her in an appropriate fashion. Of course I am more likely to grow sentimental before that happens but I don’t know how to tell her that so I kept the visit focused largely on the indolent Toby.
It stands still, in Putney, with all its ugly secrets.
John’s eyes became quite bright. “Seriously?”
“Okay?” John asks.
was waiting, hysterical with hatred and pointing a gun at us both.
Two down, three to go.
Sherlock waits.
Lestrade saw how worried I was. “Don’t let it upset you. Just be prepared. You’re a great parent. No one doubts that.”
"No, I made certain he fried." Sherlock is twisting the key to the door of his flat and opens it wide, ushering John in ahead of him.
It wasn't any of that. It wasn't just her femininity or her power or her connections or the huge vault of knowledge about every carnal or depraved or pathetic or unlawful sexual activity that would no doubt would outshine his in practice if not in theory.
“You’re going to have to choose your cases more carefully now, at least for a couple of years.”
I made my indignant face but it was ruined when John Watson softly held my face still in his hands. He does that these days when he wants me to listen closely to his orders. It is very effective. John comes in loud and clear when he holds my face.
“Analyse them? Are you a dietician?”
He’s the only person who can.
“We’re down at the park with Albion. We’d have to bring him if we came. Yeah, not sure. Is it safe? Okay. Can you hang on? I’ll just ask Sherlock.” John held the phone away from his mouth. “Lestrade wants us to come and have a look at the containers.”
There is no pink to compare.
“What? What have you found?”
all tilting in a field the same colour as his embrace.
“Unusual perhaps, but not weird. No one would be remotely surprised if the roles were reversed and it was a man who wouldn’t bother with a child he fathered.”
Inspiration can come from the strangest things. Observe:
John texts Greg, Sherlock texts Mycroft.
(Eddie told me that I should become more sentimental. I told him there was more chance that I would produce a Constable in occupational therapy.)
But it’s not working.
“No!” The thought is appalling. “No, but thanks for the thoughtfulness. Doctor Watson and I are just good friends.”
No aspect of that news made me feel good about myself. I was glad Albion would never know of his father’s shameful past.
Sherlock grunts some more. The hanger keeps getting caught in the fridge's mechanics and his phone remains tantalisingly out of reach.
Lestrade and John have the same unformed question. “But …how?”
My John is perfectly proportioned.
John nods. “The brain just keeps bleeding and even if you treat it immediately, chances are the damage is already done, so the victim falls into a coma pretty quickly. This fella fell hard. I can smell alcohol on him – you say it’s connected?” he asks Sherlock.
"I don't reckon, I know."
it's fresh killer was disturbed
It’s rather like unlocking chains and feeling the relief as limbs move with ease again. “Yes, I think I am.”
Mrs Hudson leans over a little to get a closer look. “What beautiful colour! It really suits you. What it’s called?”
“Tell me about an average day in your household.”
He sees a taxi in the distant mottled lights of the High Street, does some brief calculations as to how much money he has left and raises his arm.
Neither John nor I are partial to emotional, heartfelt conversations, no matter how necessary they might be. Because of this, we both wondered privately exactly what was going to become of us. When we first met five years ago, we worked on cases together, and in between cases, John doctored at a local clinic.
"I think you're the only person I'm going to miss, and you're not even a person."
The import case was not particularly stimulating – I’d give it  6.3 on my how-interesting-is that-crime scale – but I was impressed by the sheer size of the operation. It involved three separate criminal gangs who had joined forces and rented warehouse space near the docklands area to store and distribute their product.
In her statement, she recounted that she had driven her boss to the airport early that morning in his car, and then drove straight her office in Putney, where she parked that car. She was there all day.
Recover. John wonders idly what exactly he would be recovering. The man who he was before he went to war, maybe: drinks at the pubs with mates on Thursday night, a good run every morning, watching international test matches on Saturday afternoon with a beer, sleeping the whole night through in the dark. An optimistic man who found life interesting because he knew something big was coming. That man seems uninformed and so far away as to be irretrievable. John wondered if there was anything he could do to bring him back.
"Do you think?"
John fastens the bandage.
He arrives home that night with a vast bunch of varicoloured roses and finds Sherlock in the kitchen, cooking dinner.
Lestrade's team are not quite so generous. None of them like Sherlock, and all resent that he might happy. They waste time trying to find out the real nature of his relationship with the gentle doctor.
“Lay on your back for me,” John whispers.
Sherlock and John are permitted to watch the autopsy.
At home, Sherlock is once more looking at John’s socks, idly pressing a finger to his lips and planting a little kiss on each pair.
John, who's starting to rather like this odd ball, moves across the room to grab the lamp with the long extender neck so he can illuminate the wound. His white coat and jacket catch a little on the trolley.
It is a far more interesting case than Sherlock expected. CCTV footage allowed him to deduce the suspect is a public school boy, and this was enforced by the latest victim’s recollections. Sherlock and John were able to view CCTV footage from previous robberies on Lestrade’s ipad and before it was finished, Sherlock was hailing a cab with John scrambling to keep up.
"Isn't he pitiful?" Mycroft leans in to kiss her too, gently nudging Sherlock out of the spotlight.
There's the police, rushing towards the sound of a gun, Lestrade at the front, terrified that Sherlock has been shot.
Sherlock’s eyes spark briefly. "Why?"
“Yes,” I told him in my special love voice, “It’s all very well for you to be snivelling but I’m the one actually dealing with it from this side, Mr Uber Guts.”
“Dr Watson, was it?” Ms Powers refused to be waylaid by the terrifying doctor. “We need to be certain that Albion is healthy. Could you confirm that?”
“No,” I told him, “But I probably should change him, so if you need to check…”
“Oh Sherlock,” she kept saying while she dabbed her eyes.
Nothing.
"Lay down. Get comfortable."
“Yes. Well, poem is probably too generous a description but I attempted to express sentiment in a form of verse.”  Sherlock stands tall, hands behind his back, bracing himself for disdain or mocking.
"What did you do to the cat? Did you kill it?"
It is perfectly feasible, and the cause of immeasurable sadness to me, that I might never see him again.
When they walk out side the sun has split the clouds and they can feel the tiny warm rays on their faces. John waits until they've locked the gate behind them and stands still.
But it wasn’t that either. John looked down, his lips pressed so tight they hurt.
“Are you feeling better?”
Mycroft, of course, recognises it too.  He looks to Rosie, who smiles at him, and says “Client!”
He shrugged. “Sure. Some people collect postcards. Can I have a look at your baby?”
“You’re not listening.” It’s exhausting, all this feeling stuff. Sherlock resigns himself to risking everything because John as a source of pain is not acceptable. He wants to exonerate him and set them both free. He stares out the window where nothing is lovely and speaks softly. “I mean it literally. If you want to kill the man who gave me straight boy pain, you’d have to kill yourself.”
Mrs Hudson, who I have always maintained is the back bone of this country, was able to find two clean teapots and ensured we all had tea and biscuits. (There were Jaffa Cakes in my cupboard. I had no idea. Anya must have put them there.)
"I've got post traumatic stress syndrome. I have really bad nightmares. I cry out, I have - I can't sleep in the dark."
“Technically yes, but in practice, no, they’re not. They’re young thugs who no one is taking the time to correct. I’m helping them” –
“Ah, well. We all have our crosses to bear. Do you want to know anything more about my final drug fiesta?”
Mike rests his hand on his son’s shoulder. “Sherlock texted me during the week to tell me there were enough seats.”
Most of his communications were relayed via some form of anguish, so it was a pleasant surprise when he communicated to me in an entirely different way.
"So is that blonde doctor bloke The Freak's boyfriend?" Donovan's arms are folded across her chest, her feet crossed at the ankles. She's leaning on the door jam.
It is then that John hears his own pain.
“Nice try,” Lestrade smirks. “This might be the only time I know something you don’t, so get stuffed.”
For he made me livable.
“Yes, we’re talking about you, young man! You’ve been such a good boy, haven’t you?”
So the transition from flat mates to lovers was seamless.
"Who do you work for?"
There are two noted exceptions to the packing - his computer (which will fit on top of the smaller box) and the Sig, which obviously he will need on Saturday night.
"You need stitches," he says firmly.
“Don’t be ridiculous. You were arrested in a crack house. You’re lucky to be getting some aspirin.”
There I could get high as much as I liked, and to what ever extent I liked. I took full advantage of those exciting opportunities.
Sherlock, too, liked John being a prison doctor because he worked only three days a week, which allowed Sherlock opportunity to bask in the glory of Watson light for four days a week. Also, Sherlock knew quite a lot of John’s patients, and in many cases one or both of them had been responsible for the patients being in prison.
John does what he's told, no idea what's happening until Sherlock starts unfastening his jeans.
“They might have done shit investigations, but the coppers certainly win some points for staying in touch,” he remarks.
Sherlock can see there are some things he has to unpack here. He goes back to the John Room in his mind palace while he bites carefully at a slice of pizza, looking for the anchovy because a burst of salt is a great accompaniment to thinking:
John is sorting through the thick dark curls, stretching them gently and watching them spring back into place. “Yes. Or as little as you want. I intend to make sure that you are not only the most pain-free but also the most content gay man in London. Are you measuring my ear with your tongue?”
Sherlock wants to kiss the man who planned to make him feel so good.
"Great." He turns to the Rhonda who sits in the hamper with her back turned to him resolutely. "Thanks for that."
"Pew. Pew. Pew."
It was Lestrade.
I have some excellent news! @ancientreader has written a sequel to this story, and it is phenomenal. I am very, very hopeful that she will post it, because it is fabulous piece of writing, and  it provides a very happy ending for another character in this story.
“And have you been playing with your son?”
“Court order. Infant son. No more crack houses for at least sixteen years.”
"Afghanithtan or Iraq?"
John’s face is still. “I don’t know what to say to that, except I can’t see how having a pelican corpse is supposed to honour that.”
I couldn’t. I heard the instructions, and understood what he wanted me to do, but my arms wouldn’t budge.
Sherlock bit his lip and focused on the problem at hand.
“I know he wasn’t,” she says immediately. “Robert was many things, but he would not, did not, hurt Mariah.”
My fears were groundless.
A short time later she calls out to Sherlock with a melodic voice. "Hoo hoo! Are you around Sherlock? I've made you some scones!"
Sherlock watches John as he prepares breakfast, chats idly about teeth and stacks the used
"Well, he’s doctoring down at Wormwood now, isn’t he? You know what the prison grapevine's like. Me and the boys were talking about it just the other week. I thought, as did some of the lads, that you and the doctor were special friends."
Finally, he wanted to do it where he'd be found quickly, but not by children, not in anyone's private space, not anywhere the ghost of a suicide would cause distress. A church, a cemetery, somewhere quiet and empty. And in London. He loves London. The thought of dying right on its heart was comforting.
"Our mother." Sherlock is snarling directly at Mycroft.
“I don’t know for sure. I think her first murders were in California. She has to serve sentences there first, then in Nevada, Texas and Illinois. They definitely have the death penalty in Texas, but I doubt she’ll ever finish her sentence in California. She’s facing two consecutive forty year sentences.”
Mycroft turned out to be one hundred per cent right about the nanny and made insufferable, smug faces me at every available opportunity for weeks. I hate him when he’s right, but also really do love my brother when he uses his powers for good and not evil.
“You’re going to love this one.”
He is a tiger with monstrous paws.
He wants to leave the job but has no idea where to go or what he should do. He longs to bark orders at nurses, make urgent decisions about blood loss, stent split arteries and monitor lung capacities but it seems all he is good for now is to work for another pharmaceutical company
The little dog, who has sat near Mrs Best and watched as John changed the bandage, has now trotted over to Sherlock and sniffed around Rosie. She watches cautiously from the safety of his lap, and Sherlock, without realising it, gently pats her back.
I missed the social services ladies’ reaction because my attention was captured by John Watson and Albion, completely oblivious, gently tapping foreheads with each other. Albion thought this was delightful and laughed every time John leaned in.
"Okay," John says when they're all gone, "You can have a good scratch."
I raise that trivial point to give context to the abject fear I felt when the Mesdames Powers and Briggs came into my flat. My heart was pounding and  thin drools of sweat ran down my spine. It was a terror that I still can’t describe adequately.
“Doctor Watson is now Albion’s legal parent. You are not. Do you understand?”
He lies there quite still, and his first thought is that the wall must have got in first. Plaster dust settles around him and shards of glass glitter all through the carpet. When his hearing has settled and he can tell that he is not wounded or even slightly hurt, he feels a delicious flash of excitement spark in every vein.
“No, but sometimes I help Sherlock with his.”
Sense of humour
“I think so, but he was in Bordeaux at the time. He came back later that day. To be honest, there wasn’t much to suspect. She simply disappeared. Police assumed she was taken in a car,  but no one knew. There was some theory that she might have wandered off and was taken somewhere from else.”
There wasn’t much time. I had to tell him EVERYTHING.
John, who once extracted a bullet from a screaming man with only one scalpel, some broken
He did visit me at the hospital.
“What was her name?”
“Ademar fucking Silver,” he reads, editing it to suit his mood. “Ademar Silver and his fucking silver coloured business card, brainwashing my Sherlock. Oh, Really. Really.”
Sherlock’s face softens and he gives Ryan one of his rare, genuine smiles.
“He needs his own room. Actually he doesn’t, but we do. One of us is going to end up in a wheelchair if we keep screwing on the floor.”
For his smile is devastatingly handsome.
“Hello my darling,” Mycroft said sweetly as he leaned over me while Albion slurped.
“That’s what everyone said but the Prince paid no attention and planned to become a very smart pirate who could solve anything. Alas, the education system let him down badly and he ended up having to go to Cambridge and study Chemistry, which was a pity in a lot of ways because he had no idea what to do if he couldn’t be a pirate.”
I held the box up to show the social services ladies. “He’s got toys!”
John rolls his eyes. “I’m not trying to teach you to suck eggs. I’m just saying that even though there isn’t a deranged serial killer committing an endless stream of locked room murders, this one is still serious. You should at least consider looking at it.”
John nods. Sherlock tears his eyes away from his toenails.  “Depends. Exegesis, please.”
I couldn’t move and my reluctance to comply aggravated him further. He took a step towards me and Albion started his low grade wail, no doubt distressed by how tightly I held him. I wondered if I could get to the door, and tried desperately to calculate how far I’d have to run. My brain helpfully provided simultaneous memories of John Watson telling me how frequently he’d attended village homes that had been bombed, how frequently he’d rolled over a fatally wounded adult victim on their back, only to find a dead child helplessly and inadequately sheltered underneath.
“Where was I when I had the fantasy, where did I kiss you, or where did I locate the fantasy?”
Sherlock looks up expectantly.
Ademar reads the papers. He knows all about Holmes and Watson going on cases. “Did he help?”
I nearly said heterosexuality.
People tell you that they’re worried as a kind of gift, a compliment, but I can’t see the point. Worrying about me (or anything) wasn’t going to improve my health (or anything else). I had no idea to say. People don’t like to be told not to worry so I changed the subject.
"He's my friend, Mycroft. Now piss off. It's dinner time."
“Well, if you never came back, I would have. But – well, you like babies. You…”
John has to steel himself to look at her. It's hard. She's so young, slight and pretty with a mane of wild shiny curls that fan across her back, dressed in tight jeans and pink sneakers and a floppy fleece top. Amongst a number of small deep scratches on her neck there's two irregular crimson wounds coated in bright clotted blood that has spilt to form a generous glossy pool around her face and a gruesome bib across her fleece.
It was dark and cold when they packed up the empty containers. They stood up to leave, John extending a hand to help Sherlock to his feet.
John shakes his heads, laughing a little.
Sherlock leans in to Jeremy and places a large steady hand on his narrow shoulder. “The pain’s awful, isn’t it? You thought that buying Tom a gift might make him like you more. It’s an easy mistake to make. Don’t be embarrassed. It happens to all us all, at least once.” He waits until Jeremy looks up. “Think of it as a rite of passage. You’re going to be fine.”
It is a horrible process. Molly and John are both there, but Sherlock stands back slightly. He wishes this wasn’t happening.
They obviously thought I was the worst kind of moron.
“Make sure he can see the toys,” Lestrade added.
“So then what happened?”
"All four of them. In the neighbour's wall. With two mallets. And a blood soaked towel."
“Okay?”
His voice is the colour of syrup as it pours over hot pudding.
But Sherlock sits up suddenly. "Stand up," he says to John. "No, don't say anything , just stand up."
“No. I’m going to start pestering him as soon as you’re gone. But don’t think I don’t appreciate your good intentions.” He pulls at John’s jacket to bring his face in for one last kiss.
"Just finished here, doctor," the nurse says as she hands John a thin file. "Patient has been hit by a scooter, has a bad cut on his head and says he has chest pains."
“Because she’s his mother and she might be in some kind of peril.”
“So, this fantasy … does it work for you? Is it good?”
"You're hilarious. Your phone. Here. Let me."
A few days later they were walking home from Barts, where Sherlock had looked over a corpse for Lestrade and correctly deduced the victim had died as a result of self-deliverance and not suffocation at someone else’s hand.
Because I like unbuttoning shirts. Because I can watch you when you're getting me off and you'll remind me that we're doing something wanton and impulsive , half dressed and half naked.
"So what exactly are you doing tonight?"
John looks down and see's Sherlock is reading his GMC card. He pats his back pocket, looks at the card again.
“Well,” said Mycroft. “The happy family.”
“Sherlock and I discussed that last night. We wondered if perhaps the husband had threatened to go back to his wife, or if maybe he wanted custody of the little girl. We don’t know.”
“You can do anything you want with it, except show it to me. Or read it to me, unless one of m’tutors has been murdered in extraordinary circumstances and they require my assistance.”
Eleven Jumpers Watson wrote to her from Reunion, a volcanic island that belongs to France but is situated in the Indian Ocean on the east coast of Africa. The post card showed a picture of the great gull that, according to the little blurb on the back, is the symbol of the island.
John can her the frustration in her voice. It’s palpable, too convincing to be  invented.
pings the response.
One case dated back to 1970 – a thirty eight year old man  found in his bedsit with a bludgeoned head. They’d never recovered the weapon; forensic reports seemed to indicated a cricket bat. The crime scene photos showed him fully dressed, laying face down beside his miserable single bed that was neatly made. The witness statements were scarce, just a couple of colleagues who were able to provide scant details – that he worked at the post office and liked to go to the cinema.
Molly had been around and left a huge bunch of yellow flowers in a the largest specimen jar she could find (the jars that are used for livers, potions of limbs large tumerous growths. I felt better just seeing that jar. Comforted.).
forceps, a local anaesthetic and a tank of oxygen, has wandered the streets of London for nearly six hours. He has crossed the suicide bridge over Archway Road, pausing briefly to look through the wire at the City and at the streams of traffic below, struggled through the Saturday crowds of Camden, sat on the edge of a seat on the 34 bus, walked alongside Hyde Park and over to Bayswater Road, through to Marble Arch and along the tailbone of Oxford Street.
“Thank God you’re back,” Sherlock sighs when he walks though the door, eyes all over him, deducing every millimeter. Why has he been to Boots? Lubricants? Massage oil? “Did you think about me today?”
against the light he brings.
Their contentment is interrupted when the doorbell rings. John and Sherlock say nothing, for they are well used to clients, and no longer need to declare the specific descriptors of a client’s ring.
For a while there, I wondered if I loved him because I couldn’t deduce why I loved him. Then I wondered if this is what dull people meant when they sang songs about their paramour casting a spell on them.
For his shirts are a blend of silk and cotton.
“I don’t remember. Possibly.”
John stands tall and confident, staring straight into Sherlock’s eyes as he lays his hands on his shoulders. “Thank you. I know what you mean. I don’t like it either. I want it to be like it was, and it seems like we can’t do that.”
“No.” He reached out for my arm and pulled it over his chest, locked it into place with his hands.
Her youngest son stands before her now, smiling delightedly at her for noticing his pyjamas, bending in to kiss her pale slightly papery cheek. She wears Cabochard, like she has always done, and the deep, wantonly intelligent scent comforts him immediately.
John smears some jam on a muffin. “I suppose this could all turn into nothing too. I mean, we have the Dream Lady’s claims, but it could all be a big coincidence.”
Sherlock closes that file in his mind palace. A few others lay scattered around the floor and snag his attention.
Sherlock reaches up to adjust the angle of the light again. Lestrade moves to fix the beam in the right position.
(Multiple wounds to the face, throat and heart are personal. The killer is stabbing at something quite specific and with a lot of misdirected passion. People who are stabbed in pub brawls, or when robbed by strangers, have one or two wounds. Multiple wounds are nearly always inflicted by someone close - the closer to the face with the knife, the closer to the heart of the killer, who lashes out at what they see everyday: face, throat, chest, arms. There are exceptions, of course, but they are usually the result of a serious mental illness. )
"You'd need to obstruct your breathing, darling. Pooling alone won't knock you out unless you have secondary respiratory issues. You're still too healthy. If you need to be unconscious, why don't you just get someone to knock you out?"
"Are your getting married then?" Mrs Turner asks nicely.
“Well, according to his chart, Albion is entirely healthy, and we can’t find any evidence that she was using while she pregnant. She was certainly fraternising with three known junkies, but each of them swore blind that she wasn’t using while she was pregnant.”
The bullet had literally blasted the flesh of his shoulder apart, and although it was entirely healed, I could see each tiny speck of scar left by the sutures. There were twenty-seven. I memorized the placement of each one.
“This is my – our son, Albion.”
“Seriously? There’s a National Bee Unit?”
o	Bird??
"I'm going to have to give you a shot of penicillin, and I think you should have a tetanus shot too."
“Hello. I’m Detective Lestrade from Scotland Yard. I’m an old friend of Sherlock’s, just dropped in for a visit.”
I was in rehab/recovery/mental health treatment for nearly five months. When I first got there I was still too sick to hate it, and by the time I recovered fully from my infected bullet wound I was too disorientated, and too emotionally unstable, to have serious objections to being locked up. Also, they had bread and butter pudding for dessert at least two nights a week and frankly I would saw off my right arm for a good bread and butter pudding sometimes.
Sherlock lifted his face and stilled as if his bones had set in concrete. He stared right through John as the loveliness washed out the door and into the deep gutter that runs along Baker Street.
"Right," but his voice is already a little off centre, his thoughts skewed as the maddening rhythm builds and everything under his skin turns to hot liquid.
For his smile is the last thing I want to see on this earth.
There are twelve patients currently in the Hospice. Julia is in ward 303, a quiet room at the back of the hospital reserved for patients with pulmonary illnesses. She is asleep when they enter the room, an old lady in a non-descript nightgown, grey hair dull and untidy, her face sunken under the weight of deep lines and sallow for want of a deep breath.
I use this tedious story to illustrate the fact that a lot of seemingly untrue things actually happen to me, which is why Mycroft, more often than not, will give me the benefit of the doubt.
He is all of these things every day for me.
He is confident in his stride but a tiny bit anxious. He wants John to see him at his best but knows he has few allies here.
His sadness is the leeched grey of a faded photograph.
“Well, a passable alibi.”
Since that night of special deductions, Sherlock decided he only had to exercise his remarkable self control and one day John would come to him, spinning around to point with an outstretched arm to proclaim it was always him, Sherlock Holmes.
would recognise my John by touch:
Don’t tell me truth isn’t stranger than fiction.
Rosie is excited by this addition to her collection Mycroft is helping her amass, and opens the bag for her father to peek in. She is, Sherlock and John have discussed, the only three year old in the Northern hemisphere and possibly in the history of humanity to have a collection of pencils sorted by their density.
Still Eurus is silent.
"Yes. Categorically. I can't compete with that. I actually don't want to compete with that. Why do you have a human head in the fridge? Is it someone you know?"
“I loathe surprises. You know that. Tell me what’s in your speech.”
Sherlock observed silently and deduced it was a lot not good.
Sherlock lifts his chin, defiant, waiting for the tedious angry rebuke. but John's delighted.
Rosie loves Sally. Such a pretty lady, and so clever. She continues her breakfast with enthusiasm.
“It’s important data. You never know when we might be trapped in a dark basement and the only method available to me to identify you will be to measure your ear with my mouth.”
“Well, it’s certainly not mine.”
"114 Bridge Road Shepherd's Bush," he says without a second thought.
“You know Sherlock, I think you have the longest feet of any person I have ever known. And I’ve seen a lot of feet.”
“I don’t understand why you two can agree on something as controversial as dummies yet can’t bond over your military experiences. Would you like the orange fish or the blue fish?”
Life is full of disappointments. Sherlock had been certain that an explosion could only be the start of something big, that something or someone sinister was sending him a barely disguised message that he was on notice, and that the game, the real game, was on.
I had a career in medicine. John's hand spasms and he presses it still between his knees. "No. I have injuries. I can't practice at the moment."
“One thousand, four hundred and sixty eight days to get to this point.”
Sherlock would have argued more vehemently had he not wanted to see the lungs, bladder and take a small sample of the spleen too.
“People do. Mr Holmes and Doctor Watson, did either or both of you offer Adrienne money to have Albion?
They watch the hearse pull slowly into the traffic and a black car carrying Mrs Best follow.
John is wandering around Marylebone Street, trying to put some shape to these revelations. It’s a waste of time, because the cause of his unhappiness is not Sherlock’s new identity, but that he, John, was not a factor in his discovery of that.
“He’s been punched in the face, then fallen backwards and fractured his skull. That a potentially fatal injury – am I right, Doctor Watson?”
"So these are text book killings. There's no sexual element, no power element, no torture - just straight out stabbings performed with a generic, untraceable weapon, designed to bring death relatively quickly."
“So she’s provided a good alibi for the money.”
"Did you find it too distressing?" For these days, poor John is constantly looking for someone to whom he can connect, someone, anyone who understands what it is like to find your self in a world where everything seems to have become too hurtful to manage.
"I'm teaching third and fourth year pathology. All bright young things, just like we were. I hate 'em. I heard you were in some foreign country being shot at. How'd that work out?"
“Neither am I,” Jenny answers. “I don’t believe in ghosts at all, I think it’s all garbage. But I don’t know what else to call it.”
“It appears only three people she knew are suspects. That would be her mother – who we know didn’t do it, her father – who may have, and Julia, who might be able to prove that.”
“We’ve each opened a door to the other.”
“Why do we have to find her?”
“What should I do?”
Sherlock’s heart sinks.
That actually says a lot more about John than it does about me, but I’ll explain that later.
Rhonda is assisting. She started by politely batting his arm. When this had no effect, she stood up on her hind legs, steadied herself with one paw against his against his elbow and reached up to bat his face.
"I'm a medical doctor." John looks past her and can see Paul, the courier, chatting up one of the office temps in the background.
“Yes!” John kept beaming, waiting for Sherlock to disagree and explain too precisely why dating Fiona was a bad idea.
“Adrienne, are you prepared to rescind your rights as Albion’s parent to Doctor Watson?”
Albion burped again. He had no interest in this topic at all and found us both ridiculous.  I gave Mycroft a cloth to protect his suit from any little puddles of vomit that might arise.
Also, he is disarmingly attractive.
So Eurus settles into her new life with ease and great happiness.
They retire early that night. There’s a slow fire starting in their relationship, they can both feel it. Sherlock is more demonstrative and John, never chatty in bed, finds himself talkative and eager to be an active participant in Sherlock’s loving displays.

“Well, if you stayed in hospital as the doctors recommended and rested as you were instructed, you’d be completely recovered now.”
“Don’t be fwightened,” he told his sister when he explained boars. “If there’s a boar and it comes here, Mrs Hudson will hit with her bwoom. If she misses, Daddy and other Daddy will kill it before it can get us.”
Mr Wridge, as he was known to all his staff, demolished the glass house out the back,  re-built the pagoda and totally remodelled the interiors of the main house. The amended building now contained offices, a reception room and two meeting rooms for prospective clients and suppliers.
John draws Sherlock closer, slipping his hand around his waist and turning him slightly so his face is brightened by the moon.
“Yes, but more than that. We’ve opened up a new room. We’ve added something to the friendship.” It’s forming in his mind as he rests his face one John’s chest, a picture of the passageway that reaches between John and himself, a small private connection that is now marked indelibly with the heavy clear sound of John’s heart.
“Hello sugarchops.” I said this solely for John Watson’s benefit, who choked a little on his tea as he guffawed.
My parents stood side by side, getting ready to stare at me like they did when I was sent home from school for burning down one of the science labs, which had been an accident. (And it was for the best. The science labs were hopelessly dated, and losing one provided a very handsome insurance payment that meant that all four junior labs were rebuilt and updated. I waited six years for a thank you and got nothing.)
“You are so clever!” He hugs her tight and hoists her up to face level.
That next morning, Sherlock makes Rosie her porridge, and John boils eggs. There is a pot of tea already on the table,  and across the room the plans and maps lay where they left them last night. Sherlock chatters with Rosie about nursery school, and what she might do today. John gives Sherlock an egg, and squeezes his shoulder for the warmest, smallest second.
All John needs is white coat and a bit of gumption.
“Funnily enough John, I didn’t either. Now I can’t imagine life without him.”
“You are so lucky to have a sister!” Victor tells Sherlock as the bandits sits cross legged and eat their sandwiches.
Sherlock’s every muscle tenses as John lifts his t-shirt, tugging it carefully until the long damaged back is exposed entirely. The terror comes back and Sherlock hates himself, his scars and his history. He wishes he could present John with something cleaner, something pleasant and inviting.
Greg is here because he trusts John’s judgment, and more importantly, he has to sign for the files in the registry. Also, Sherlock will probably solve a couple and that means a better Key Performance Indicator.
There's Sherlock, pushed up against the wall, hands flat on either side, facing a taller, thick set man who tears Sherlock's scarf from his throat and tosses it to the ground.
Adrienne was looking out the window. She didn’t find me very interesting at all. “For honour and stuff.”
“Of course. Don’t drop him.”
The fathers were close to defeat. The nanny stepped in.
They feel very familiar with one another and very comfortable.
It should have been strange, to be suddenly co-parenting with a man I had loved secretly for almost five years, but John Watson fitted into our little family very quickly, mostly, I think, because there had been an empty space with his name on it for so long.
For his biceps bulge.
Not long after Sherlock was bundled off to join his brother at school, Papa's thinking became even more intense and more expansive to the extent that he had difficulty actually expressing it in any kind of reasonable sentence. Eventually, for the sake of his health, he reduced all his communications to one word. Consequently he rarely goes out because no one outside his immediate family has a clue what he's on about.
“Perfectly. I have cold files to work on. In any case, Anya brings Albion in to check on me frequently, so I never get the chance to get into any serious trouble.”
“Good morning!” I said to Albion, who smiled and made some vowels for me. We were delighted to see each other. “Have you been assisting Doctor Watson with raspberries?”
Sherlock, meanwhile, is knocking on Ademar Silver’s door.  It turns out that Straight Boy Pain is a horrible affliction, and Sherlock has decided he would like to be cured.
Sherlock is intensely curious. He puts John at the centre stage of his thoughts, luxuriating in the slow strokes of Ademar’s fist, flinching instinctively as Ademar’s thick fingers slowly slip behind his scrotum and stroke the dense muscles of his perineum.
He seems to know what’s inside and takes the oversized foam container that is sitting on her doorstep.
“No, of course not. I made that up on the spur of the moment.”
Lestrade observes but it doesn't help him and he holds both bemused hands in front of him. "What?"
“Of course not. I’m going to home school him.”
molly
John laughs gently as he paints wide amber stripes of iodine over the cut. "Yes." Just saying that makes him happier than he's been in months.
The thought had never occurred to me. “My brother arranged it.”
John reaches over and closes his fingers over Sherlock’s palm. It looks nice. John’s hand is dry and warm. He folds his own fingers down over John’s and memorises each cuticle while he calculates how many days it’s taken to get to this small but critical point.
"I suppose it is. How did you know about the cat?"
"How could you - what things can you see that tell you that I played Rugby?"
He stops before John and holds him place with one hand on his face.
I have no idea what happened after that; I woke up in hospital. It wasn’t as serious as the first time she shot me but it was more painful.
For he is a prime number.
"Sherlock Holmeth," he says with a tiny splatter of blood. "I have cheth pains."
Mycroft gave me an unpleasant look. “Improvement in the human condition is always possible, my treasured sibling. You of all people should know that.”
“Yes.”
“It’s like a hymn. A sort of , well,  Ave, Ave, Ave Maria – over and over.”
“It’s just chemistry, really, isn’t it? A portion of a powdered grain, some form of fat to dampen it, an egg to bind it, sugar to flavour it, a form of soda to make it expand under heat – cooking is just chemistry.”
I was inexplicably annoyed. “Why, has there been a new shipment of opiates?”
I didn’t even bother answering, just scowled at him.
“Now, I haven’t seen any toys. What kind of toys do you have for Albion?”
"Hang on! Who's this?" She turns to John. "Who are you? Did he follow you home?"
Sherlock puts his tongue back and twists his mouth as if he's considering the suggestion.
“He’s bigger than I remember.”
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll fix it. What do we know about the mother?”
The shoe – a brown Clarks Gro-Rite with a now tarnished buckle – is in a large paper bag.
from temple to earlobe.
Two people changed that for us in the space of eighteen hours.
“No.” John answers instantly, his body calm but his eyes filling with wild panic. “No. I can’t. Can’t Molly help – what about Mike” -
"Cool!"
And John stills.
John doesn’t quite get it.
At this stage though, Albion pretty much disliked anything except eating and sleeping. He took it as a personal slight when I bathed him, and acted like I was trying to disembowel him when I changed his nappy.
“Jesus – so there’s a mother out there somewhere needing medical attention?”
“I – I don’t know what I’m trying to say. But there is quiche. And peas. And brownies, and I made a thermos of tea too.”
I also learnt that babies being born is not one of the most attractive ways in which the human condition makes itself known.
Rosie loves Mycroft. He makes time to visit as frequently as he can, and is there now, cross legged on one side of the little table, facing Rosie, as they carefully address a large wooden puzzle that will – soon – depict a dog carrying a bunch of flowers.
The he closes the drawer and turns out the light as he leaves.
"No. I just wanted to tell you that you're the best thing that ever happened to me."
“Idiots.”
“This is not how this conversation is supposed to go. I’m trying to think of something romantic like that bird might do and you’re being obtuse.”
Mycroft started dealing forms around. “Sign here. Sign here.”
He is a kestrel, wings flat against the east wind.
That night Sherlock is consulted on the case of the not exactly suicides. He meets the killer cabbie face to face and humours him for a while, pretending that he too will swallow the fatal pill. He listens to the cabbie's dreary brags and woeful excuse of an aneurysm as he texts Lestrade under the table.
“Well, he comes around most morning and never sets a time. This afternoon he said he’d be here tomorrow at 8am.”
Likes the violin
I wondered if John liked the idea of re-attempting fatherhood, but he can be very prickly about topics close to his heart. We were getting on so nicely I decided to let it pass.
Albion, exhausted by a day of hair pulling and legal procedures, once more slept soundly.  I was having happy (and deluded, it would transpire) thoughts that he was starting to sleep the entire night through.
Sherlock reads the entirely inadequate autopsy reports, scoffs at the scabby crime scene descriptions and snorts at the assessment of the evidence left at the crime scenes.
He's crossed the road and about to walk through the park - there might be squirrels, and squirrels always make you feel better - when he spies a soft plump man sitting on a bench in amongst the trees. Other people are walking along the path or chatting in pairs on other benches, enjoying the watery Spring sunshine.
We all erupted in a cheer, and he started howling at me for turning him in to a performing seal.
She was wearing a navy blue suit (Valentino, I’m certain) and expensive Sergio Rossi boots. Her hair was cut neatly and styled softly over her face and was filled with caramel highlights. I wondered if perhaps she had been to Saks and made use of the stylists they have there.
There have been so many deliberate attempts on my life,  and so many times when I have almost been accidentally killed, that I stopped keeping count years ago.
“Of course,” Rudy tells her. “And you know what else? You will be living not ten miles from the Caran D’ache  factory. Caran D’ache, as you know, make some of the finest pens and pencils in the world. One of your first lessons, which you will take with your brothers, will be at that very factory. If you are all very good, Mummy and Papa have said that you may each choose a new tin of pencils.”
“I’m scared for my son,” I said as smoothly as I could while Mike handed him back over.
“It’s turning out rather well, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, I don’t usually wear one. I’ve been travelling and it was just easy not to shave every day.”
“I was out of my tree for three weeks,” I explained. “I was smoking heroin and ended up sharing it with a woman I met there. We had sex, I believe, three times but I can’t remember it all. That’s the whole story of my brush with he- with her.”
It's so foolhardy, so frightening that it makes him smile, hand lying calmly on his thigh, fingers tapping softly while the cutting pain in his leg melts.
Sherlock’s heart is heaving. He is excited and nervous and wide eyed at the prospect of some thing completely new, his mouth watering in preparation for their first kiss.
“You must learn. You will find yourself nourished by both the good food and the privilege of having good food.”
“Did you like the bloke next door?” I’m ashamed to say I felt a temporary pang of jealousy of the Watsons’ neighbour and possibly the junior Watson’s cat.
“Squirrels are the ninja of the unwanted, John. Look at them! They make no sound, they can cram grams of vegetable matter in their mouths and they move so fast that it can be difficult to see them sometimes.”
Although he came to me sturdy
“What are you looking at?” John said, leaning in to kiss the little well-sucked fist.
"Have you ever seen a phone box that wasn't vandalised."
Mycroft held the roaring Albion and followed me to the kitchen where I had bottles sterilising. The new uncle eyed my bottle sterilising equipment with a clinical eye.
John shakes his head. "I hardly know him."
Everyone looks at him, Mariah lying in the centre.
“Great. I’ll book the tickets this afternoon.”
And as another afterthought
One of my greatest fears is boredom. More than a few hours of not having a case can drive me to unadulterated madness. Now I can watch my son actually grow. Every single second imprints another piece of information on his rapidly expanding brain.
He's their boss. He's killing his employees.
“Quite right, “ says Mycroft as he gently guides Rosie’s little hand to the right place so she can place the next piece of the puzzle.
“Actually it is. I understand now why you go on dates, because the sexual satisfaction is nice.”
“He’s very beautiful.” Mycroft was smiling sincerely, which I’d not seen him do since August, 1983. “He looks a lot like you.”
"So what I'm saying, basically, is that every dealer expects their foot soldiers to rip them off a bit. Ten quid here, five quid there - it doesn't matter. Probably wouldn't even notice it, actually."
“Yes. Albion.”
"So you'd come home at holidays?"
Now, it seems, John is keeping the poems, and in a very respectful way. It’s strange and rather thrilling. Sherlock files this interesting development to ponder and dissect later. He has a more pressing inquiry now.
Mostly, though, I was treated by Eddie, who didn’t want to cure me of anything. He liked talking with me, and wanted to know why I felt I couldn’t love people properly.
We turned out to be the cliff at the end of each other’s road.
"OW!" says Sherlock.
effort to deter people up to no good, the owner has installed a makeshift lighting system that illuminated the entire factory frontage and the rear exit. This allows some light through the building and mostly assists people up to no good to carry on illicit activity without too much strain on their eyesight.
The sound of a siren brings him back to the cold black streets of London and he remembers that Sherlock, dangerous uncharted territory that he is, has stormed off unarmed  to confront a murderer.
“Yes, my little butterball, I know you’re there. Doctor Watson and I aren’t ignoring you. It’s just easier to talk to each other because we can, you know, actually speak.”
He stops in the shadows and carefully removes his gun.
Although obviously their relationship does not go unnoticed by friends and family.
I started to believe that John would never come home because he’s thorough, and because he likes setting people’s world to right.
There isn’t much to add, so Sherlock spends their happy silence watching their clasped hands and congratulating himself, for his original deductions were actually correct.
Sherlock hands Lestrade the phone and smiles down to John, who still crouches over the corpse. “You want to get some breakfast? There’s a fantastic builder’s caff about fifteen minutes’ walk from here.
A tall girl with beautiful eyes, a kind smile and a bright brown ponytail walks past them.. She nods with shy courtesy at John and makes her way to Sherlock, who is looking at some new petrie dishes. They're a little wider than the old ones, and have slightly raised edges to stop spillage.
“It’s not anywhere special” –
Sherlock hopes he is being amazing.
Sherlock sails in to full blown diva. "I don't know! Maybe they don't generate enough business. Maybe they don't make enough money. Maybe - oh!" Sherlock's stills mid flight as the probable cause emerges from the shadows and he swings around in a full circle. "That's it!"
"I was supposed to be dead by now."
“We’ve tracked her passport. We don’t know exactly what she’s doing there.”
“I want to know who gave you straight boy pain. Was it that professor with the feathers?”
It's the kindest thing anyone has said to John in years and he smiles broadly, dipping his face in appreciation.
“Yeah! It’ll be great. Tell you what, I’ll buy the beer if you can make him wear a scarf.”
b)	how John stopped and glanced at the cover of a magazine that featured a woman holding a kitten.
All she has is an identical chain of events every night when she goes to sleep, that culminate in a largely identical dream that wakes her up at 2.57am.
John looks out at the deepening sky and the ripe edge of orange where the sun was sinking.
For he wakes some nights screaming.
I remember too that we went back to Mrs Best, just a little while after Dad and I moved into Baker Street, and there were photos everywhere of a pretty little girl.
"You saved him?"
“Why?”
For he is carbon.
***Warning flags for homophobic language***
It is their habit, their most happy joint activity if circumstance allows: when a client calls, Mycroft provides respite for John and Sherlock, and makes sure Rosie isn’t exposed to distressing requests, or indeed distressed clients. He has her bundled up, kissed by daddy and ready for a trip to WH Smith by the time Mrs Hudson has brought the client to the door.
Everyone stood there gawping.
“He’s a gay man,” Sherlock says casually, looking out the window at a couple walking three Airedale terriers. Three Airedales! Some people make their own problems. But they are lovely, what with those square snouts and walking along on tiptoes. “Apparently it happens to all gay men. And probably gay women, although obviously I don’t have the data for that.”
So it was a difficult time for Sherlock, whose every impression made such a deep impact on his luminous, sensitive psyche: he saw his older brother the preferred confidant for Rudy, he saw his younger sister admired for the exceptional creature she was, and the focus of his parents’ attention. He saw his best friend killed, and only months later was sent to school.
Best of all, Albion had started to smile when he saw me standing at his cot, holding my violin.
"John, I know it's not what you want but you have start building some kind of structure in your life if you want to recover."
It's someone birthday. It's always someone's birthday, there's always cake. John sits in the tea room with everyone else, marvelling at how easy they are with each other, envying their ability to live like this and find happiness in the quiet and predictable.
For he sleeps naked.
Rosie smiles but looks immediately to her table and chairs.  John looks around for breakfast plates, or any evidence that Sherlock may have eaten. There’s nothing, so he unpacks Rosie at her table with some blocks, two puzzles and other toddler equipment, and sets about making Sherlock some boiled eggs with toast.
“For the love of God,” he says to each of them, “Why is it so hard to get a body exhumed? I only want to look at the trachea. I won’t touch anything else and you can put it back almost immediately. I’ll even do it at the graveside.”
“It’s special, this,” John stutters, his open hand moving back and forth between them. “It’s  - we have something good. We should do something.”
“John, I have a fabulous idea.”
"Oh, you're good at this." And Sherlock sits up, really intrigued.
I deduced Lestrade had a friend in Social Services, which would be highly likely, given he dealt with them whenever he oversaw a homicide involving a child. On that basis I had to accept his information was sound.
“John Watson, “ I repeated.
“But then Ollie was born and it didn’t matter. I kept fooling myself that everything would be fine if I could just hold out for a year. I just couldn’t imagine it would turn out as bad as it did.”
Eurus turns around and buries her face in her mother’s neck. “Yes!” The two Holmes women sit together for a long time in the dark, an accidental wound now diagnosed, assessed and dressed. It is already healing.
“I have babies for people.”
He is a crab, scuttling along the floors of noisy seas.
"What? On the ground again?"
“Sometimes. Sometimes I’m in my uniform, sometimes I’m in my scrubs.”
"So who consults you?"
o	Buy cat cage
For he is faithful.
"The police consult me about certain crimes, yes. But they're not my only client. Sometimes private citizens will come to me with cases and if they're interesting, I'll take them."
I deduced that his world-wide trek had nothing to do with being sick of everything and everything to do with sickness from losing an adored child who he never really actually had.
Years of dishes stacked in the sink
Sherlock doesn't blink. "I've got a human head in the fridge and I can fit most of toes in the tap in the bathtub."
“You’re right, of course.”
luminous and not an idiot because he knows who to shoot and he gives wonderful head but we'd probably have to negotiate some things. Also, he has dog tags and who would have considered how attractive that could be? He shouldn't be killing himself because he is kind and invaluable and could actually be very happy here. I would be very happy to have him here and the cat wouldn't be hurt.
This was intensely painful for him. He paused for a second and picked some fluff from the rug while he gathered his nerve to tell the truth. “I was going to kill him. When I left you at the hospital that day that’s what I planned to do. I knew where he was. I was intending to kill him just to get Ollie back.” He paused again and bit his lip, then leaned over to touch Albion’s hand, watching the little fingers closed around his thumb.
John, it transpires, was correct, and Lestrade forbids Sherlock to do anything before he can get there with a youth liaison officer.
Which is also intensely painful.
Our first sexual encounter hadn’t been particularly satisfying . It came at a bad time in both our lives and culminated in his then-wife shooting me. Again. It was hardly the stuff of great romance, and certainly not what I thought John and deserved.
“Well, sit up and we will.”
"I am," Sherlock is a little out of breath. "And what exactly are you doing here, Mycroft?"
“A drug lord who I doubled-crossed in the crack house wants to kill me.”
Shirts have to be tailored.
The first guest came in and nodded at Ms Briggs. I’m not sure I have ever been so glad to see anyone.
What kind of sea creature is John Watson?
“They’re absolutely splendid,” he says.
They just never stop. John wonders if they have a clinical problem.
I couldn’t stop staring at the starry ceiling. “It’s brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.”
John looks at the hot tea in his mug. "She meant well. She thought she was treating me properly."
The shoe has been wiped clean, so if there were any fingerprints, they’ve long since gone.
"Because the police ask him to?"
up London on those few hottest days
John can’t talk. Sherlock rushes over and reads over his shoulder.:
He was hard at work, writing up some notes about an itchy patient with an allergic reaction, when a courier delivered an envelope to the front desk.
“I do beg your pardon,” Sherlock says, in his most courteous voice. “We thought you were asleep.”
“What?”
least on the surface.
“Which makes me the pussycat and that’s definitely not on.” John is helping himself to another slice of quiche.
“Well, it was, but it turned out to be less about seeing if I was romantic, and more about telling you things that I thought you should know. And then it turned into a thing for us, and it was – well, fun. And you liked it.”
“I’ll get straight to the point. Albion hasn’t had his birth certificate issued because you haven’t submitted the paperwork.”
We had a lot to discuss.
John dampens his fingertip on his tongue and turns the final page. “Fiction.”
The trick, I think, is learning that you have to make your own happiness, and you make happiness to fit your life and circumstances. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, some bursts of happiness will appear out of the blue. I trying to instill this my boy as gently as I can, and it is something that I think is resonating with him.
Papa Watson was clearly wearing the pants in this family. “No. No home schooling. He needs to meet other children. And you mightn’t always be available to home school him. In any case, he has to get a birth certificate. He’s due to be vaccinated soon, and besides that, what if we want to travel? He’ll need a birth certificate to get a passport.”
That bothered me enormously. What should get better? Did he want me to wear a nurse’s uniform? Should I make more noise?
Jenny laughs. “You know, I don’t believe in this sort of stuff.”
Jeremy shakes his head. “I do English, Art and History. Tom’s good at Maths.”
“That’s a generous gift.”
Ruminate
"Bye Rhonda. I'm glad it all worked out for you."
We were plagued by unexpected levels of fear. We didn’t know how to start kissing one another. I was uncertain if it was permissible to start unbuttoning his shirt. We both worried that we would wake the baby so we retired the couch, which was too small, and we ended up rolling onto the floor, which was too hard.
“You can’t delete Charles Dickens and Aldous Huxley!” John was dismayed.
“You’re teary with happiness? Misery? Sentiment? Indigestion?”
“Well, eat it up so you’ll grow big and strong like me!”
“Have you thought about a name?”
John would remember the next few minutes for the rest of his life, the first time he saw Sherlock Holmes in action, as if someone clicked on him and downloaded an entire file that by rights should have taken weeks to compile.
“He’s spoken to her sister.”
The older lady is gracious. I would love a cup of tea and I know my husband would too. Both with milk and sugar, please."
I wore a navy suit that toned nicely against his sleeping bag.
“He is indeed,” Sherlock confirms with a practiced smile. “Please come up.” Her thin high heels make sharp little taps as they climb the old stairs.
This, I was certain, was where they would take him from me.
John watches as Sherlock licks crumbs from his lips. "Obviously."
He needs sugar and fat and salt.
John and Sherlock, neither of whom have ever had anyone in their life quite like the other, don't keep track of how long they have been in a relationship. After a couple of months each finds it hard to remember when they weren't a couple.
Sherlock feels the intention and softens his stance, leans his face a little closer. "What?"
“Oh! I suppose – well, yes, in London?”
New dress from Whistles, marked down because of that tiny mark on the neckline. Wearing jewellery she borrowed from her flat mate. Used to have four piercings in each ear, now has only one – new job, or looking for a professional mate. Applied her lipstick on the way over. Chain shop lipstick. Barry M, they use those heavy pigments. Quite flattering. Didn’t use a mirror. Wearing an odd perfume that smells something like Miss Balmain but more recent. Powdery, violets – maybe L’Instant Magic? It was a gift – she wouldn’t choose that kind of perfume for herself. Carrying a bottle of water and a magazine. Obviously travelled a great distance. What is she doing here?
"Sherlock, I can't let you call him." Lestrade swipes his hand over his thick hair. One of his cuffs is unbuttoned and John can see the edge of a nicotine patch.
"I got him up to two hundred and eighty pounds! That's your share. He's also said we can have the car to pick up my stuff. Who are you talking to?"
He must not undertake any ogling of or interference with John.
John nods silently, a little surprised, a little relieved.
“Mycroft, Sherlock’s suffered enough. The whole thing was traumatic and quite unexpected. Shut up. If you must drag him through the bleeding obvious and make him feel worse than he already does, perhaps wait for a few days, yeah?”
"How was that for you?"
“No. Well, yes.” John smiles with clear eyes and holds Sherlock’s gaze. “I do, but  - they’re true. I mean, they read like you’re being truthful. They sound true. And – well, we don’t talk like that, do we?” John takes a sip. “They make me feel very …. important. I mean, important in your eyes. ”
He picks the thickest and sits back down. It concerns the disappearance of Mariah Best, a four year old who seemingly vanished in Enfield on Easter Thursday in 1975. He flicks through the first few pages and reads notes of telephone calls to Corinne Best, the child’s mother, as recently as 2001.
Each cubicle has hastily scrawled name in fixed to the metal frames in a perspex holder: Walker, Singh, O'Donnell, Brackett, Canturi, Ahmed and then a blank one. John looks moves the curtain carefully, sees an old woman sleeping and moves on. The names continue - Porter, Bureau, Higgins, Davies and another blank one.
“Yes.” And then she looked down at her phone again.
In 1968, it was now owned by descendents who’d been kicked off the civil list. They hated the place and resented its upkeep, so it was sold to a South African entrepreneur who hoped to import fine wines from France, Italy and California for discerning London diners.
She nods. “Yes, of course. I’ve spoken to lots of people about Mariah.”
John turns to Lestrade and offers his hand. "John Watson," he says politely.
“Really? Sherlock! Fancy you with a baby. Well, bring him in so I can get a good look.”
Sherlock helps until his eggs are ready. While he eats, Mrs Hudson drops by. “Hello John! Hello, Rosie!”
It was very interesting. He drank nearly twenty millilitres without even bothering to open his eyes. Then he yelled at me for giving him wind, and the nurse came back and showed me how to burp him.
“Fiona? The Governor’s personal assistant?”
“Are you naked?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It all comes so naturally. "I'm a doctor," John says calmly, leaning over the stranger and gently trying to keep him still. "You're going to be fine. I just want to check your face."
“Ah. Right.” John made a half-hearted effort to wring some water from my hair. “You know, I think the world’s water crisis could be solved if we utilised your head a little more effectively.”
"Do you want to stay the night?"
"Hello mate," John says quietly as he strokes the soft coat. She's grown thicker and softer, signs that she's getting good food and regular brushing. He feels the collar - it's handmade from scraps of liberty fabric and her name tag has been hand forged.
I had the bottle ready and Albion was shrieking at me to hurry up.
And then it comes back to him. I'm here, in my life, in my only suit, working in some office in High Barnet, managing the monthly sales lists of a pharmaceutical company.
“Mrs Hudson agrees with me,” said Mycroft.
Later, as Eurus sleeps,  Uncle Rudy gathers her garish drawings and posts them to a former client in Switzerland with a long letter, outlining his fears.
"Of course. All those people can't be wrong."
I thought it was polite to have a guess. “Roast spatchcock, asparagus and boiled new potatoes pureed to a cream with olive oil?”
They were interrupted by a tall man in very loose jeans and an especially vibrant lime coloured shirt who extended his long bony hand to John. It was not pleasant to touch.
"I can see that, but who is he?"
Sherlock smacks his lips. "With Mycroft's assistant."
John smiles at the temporary lisp. It's rather endearing. "Right. No ambulanth. But I need to get you to the hospital."
