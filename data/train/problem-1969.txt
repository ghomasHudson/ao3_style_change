Sherlock would like to argue, really, but he feels weak as a kitten, plus John has his determined face on, so he just lets himself be led back to bed, and all but tucked into the sheets.
The room is large and cosy and very obviously Mr. Musgrave’s study. Books and maps litter every surface, and the walls are covered in untidy bookshelves.
Emma shrugs. “Sure. Just don’t trip over any cables.”
“Fine,” Sherlock growls and takes a step back to let John get off the counter to grab his mobile from the kitchen table.
Sherlock opens his eyes again and smiles at John. "Home?"
There’s no finesse involved when he unceremoniously unzips John’s trousers and frees John’s cock. It’s hot and hard in his hand and Sherlock keeps his eyes on John as he leans down and licks a long stripe up the length of it.
“But we were all sort of fond of her by that point,” Sally jumps in, grimacing. “So we released her into the wild in Regent’s Park.”
“Yes,” Sherlock affirms with a nod.
“I know what it is,” Sherlock says quietly.
Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner move on to John, who’s whipping cream with the air of somebody who’s done little else in his life. “You’re not going to over-whip that, are you?” Mrs Turner asks with a glance back at Sherlock.
“You think it’s just you?” John pants against Sherlock’s lips between sips of increasingly feral kisses. “Fuck, I think of you every fucking second of every day. Baking, working, walking, going to sleep.”
John sounds horrible. He sounds like he's in pain, actual physical pain. Sherlock is out of his chair and in his coat and shoes in two minutes flat. "I'll be there in 20 minutes."
Sherlock looks up to meet Mycroft’s eyes and discovers that his brother is smiling, just a hint of it around his mouth, but still genuinely smiling. “If you want me to stop treating you like a junkie, it’s time to stop acting like one. You were right to be wary of emotional entanglements after you came out of rehab, but as you just pointed out, you are no longer that person. You need to stop punishing yourself for a decision you needed to make to stay alive.”
The cool night air bites at his fingers and toes. He can hear faint music, and the light from the hall filters out into the garden. The wedding party is still in full swing, but Sherlock is done. He’s done enough. If he has to endure one more second, the pain in his chest will consume him entirely and leave a heap of ashes behind.
“I know, and if he’d pulled it off, I would name him star baker right now,” Donovan says, turning to Moran. “But do you honestly like it? Does it taste good?”
John laughs, and Sherlock feels it down to his toes. He doesn’t remember the last time he made someone laugh. Deliberately. With him, not at him.
Sherlock looks out of the window again to escape the scrutiny of her gaze. “What do you mean?”
“I’m sure Mrs. Higgins won’t mind,” Sherlock says, adding, “Just milk, no sugar.”
There’s a commotion and Mrs Hudson bursts into the room. “Oh my god, John, are you alright?” she cries, engulfing him in a hug before he can so much as say hello.
The night progresses, with lots of beer and wine and talk about cats and half an hour of the doctors around the table - John, Mike and Molly - giving Neela tips about specialising, which puts the other half of the table nearly to sleep, except Sherlock, who has nothing whatsoever to add but loves every second of John reminiscing about his early days as a junior doctor at Bart’s in London.
“And now our three finalists are fighting it out for the metaphorical crown. Who will be named Britain’s greatest home baker?”
“Gotten you drunk, probably,” Sherlock answers, still grinning. It’s a good look on him, this playful joy, and John is proud that he’s the one who put it there.
Sherlock smiles at him a bit wistfully. “Good night, John.”
Her room is very small and nearly featureless. Her bed is neatly made, there’s a pot of porridge moulding on the stove. “No relatives?” John asks quietly.
“He kissed me,” John confesses, looking down at his sandwich so he won’t have to see Billy’s expression.
Sherlock
“If you asked me to make one for telly, then I’d go for the pumpkin spice I made for the first challenge. But the one I love to eat the most, when I don’t want to impress anyone? Chocolate sponge, strawberry jam, chocolate icing with chocolate M+M decoration.” She grins when the table breaks into friendly chuckles. “My mum makes it every year on my birthday.”
“Oh my god, the pig’s heart.” Sherlock makes a disgusted face. “By Wednesday it was always a bit dodgy.”
Sherlock grins at him, pleased as always by the compliment, and almost gleeful at the new puzzle. “Let’s open it.”
. It always surprises him, the fierceness of his want, and every night, he bites down on it, tells himself
Had some ideas,then remembered a few things brought up talking to a friend. Then went back to thinking,since I've thrown the ideas out and no one's used them,why don't I?
I'll try to be more timely with the next chapter
With it being 11:30, Mycroft had to check and see what his brother was up to, and if he was going to try and overstay his welcome.
"These I have had for a bit long regardless,after today they will need to be seen to and refit or-"
They both rushed inside and Sherlock switched a light on, sharp, squinting contrast for both.
John finished his sandwich quietly. He smirked with an amused jealousy. Sherlock could finish off the last...what may have been two full glasses like the one before him left of wine,still moved and talked gracefully,was able to work on a sip of another drink, and still had the mind to talk and move looking better than so many will tonight. John included himself in the ones that will be looking less later on. What plans could he possibly have that he meant?
Hmmm,I couldn't get the bus to a Starbucks,so I'm sitting on a bench outside of a bakery where I had cupcakes and the last of thier coffee
"What do you work as,since you know I'm a doctor? Marty didn't tell me"
He stopped at what Sherlock was pointing at. It looked like a smeared,whitish,cloudy base with an artfully splashed bit of blood. The blood looked like a tree, and the background was harder to see clearly until a large dumpster was moved out from in front of it.
"I've heard talks of something like that here in London, but I don't keep up with blogs. My work keeps me so busy, I don't keep up with the many people I've played with that try to make a get rich quick blog."
John replaced his hands where Sherlock had them,and soon, Sherlock was going through a pants pocket.
John quickly had so much cleaned up,put away,set aside correctly to repair later when he finally had to start the coffee.
A few years later, a big fight had John, Sherlock,and Moriarty finding ways to fight 2 to 1 in an underground room to free hostages with bombs attached to them far away.
"That would be nice John. I can see the cycle too well, many parents live small lives, with small circles of friends just like them. Making sure thier children get good grades and everything else that can be shown off, but never really been allowed to learn. Kids rebel and try to branch away,but only tied to what they know and no realistic idea on how to learn without being punished. Everyone still goes on with small lives and narrow understanding, only to get into thier own children for trying what they were never allowed to really dare themselves when younger"
"How so?" John asked
"Show is the main point. I will come after you, then it explains here and here"Sherlock pointed to several printed pages of paper."This Edwardo Gutierrez will step in the ring and dash towards you trying this" he pointed at another page " as a pummel move,which will not be hard to get out of the way of. I run between both of you here and here " he touched his toes to more paperwork. "Giving you the drive, and I will be busy fighting him and interacting with the cameras while you get the drive in one of the main computers over the cameras and hit the small sequence of numbers,letters, and symbols you will have memorized. Then everything will be worldwide, Lestrade and Mycroft will be waiting behind the cameras here and here with handcuffs, paperwork,a recorder, and the wife that exposed all of this will be safely talking to all 3 of them on a cell phone connected to the intercom of the building."
John was flustered. Yes, Sherlock was right in a way,but damn he WAS right.
"Whatever you're doing, I just found stairs going up. Come with me, we'll look for anything electronic and metal AFTER this storm blows through. Maybe there's a dry area up there," John said, looking back at Sherlock.
Sherlock peeked outside of the wall looking up and over, then his head and eyes seemed to follow a trail down and over as he smiled. Completely wet on the side facing outside, and lightning highlighting him and his grin.
"Tsk Tsk Tsk" a familiar voice came from near the stairs. "Your so close Johnny,but you don't really know how to look at the details around before you blunder do you?"
The bottoms were drawstring, which worked because John had to roll the legs up to be reasonable.
Sherlock held a hand to his chest, keeping an unsteady John from lifting and easily looking towards him.
He soon saw nothing but color,then darkness as both shirts were lifted up and over his head. When the button up hung on his wrists,John just rolled the shirts until Sherlock's wrists were tightly bound together.
"For once, I'm up before you, but I guess having everything scheduled for me for work has me waking up and doing everything at certain times"John said,yawning and holding his cup out. "I made coffee, because it's much better than what I've been drinking while camped out"
" This hasn't even begun proper yet. I called a cab earlier that should be here in a few minutes. But you know how London traffic is,......and this is not a popular stop,.....so it may take a little longer." John hissed.
Marty,who worked hematology at John's work, thought this would be a good way to get his cousin out of the house and more familiar with the higher class of London.
John ran to the kitchen to get Rosie.
He took the last bus that was working the route from the hospital to the stop near his home at 221B,but the ice had most transport either stopped or definitely rerouting past all of the wrecks and roadwork that had to be done because of the layers of snow and ice that had built up.
John blushes violently and mutters something unintelligible under his breath, holding up his newspaper to hide his face.
“It’s your head that’s spinning, not the room,” John says, obviously amused, looking at Sherlock with that small, warm, affectionate smile John seems to have invented for Sherlock.
“Oh, John, it's so
“I was thinking apple and poppy seed; my gran has a recipe for something similar. You?”
Sent: 5:24 am
“Like everywhere else in the world, cold, small, and not especially clean.”
The woman smiles. “Well done. But no need for formality. My people call me Ya’ra, you can address me as such if you wish.”
Sherlock would have given a lot to have been there.
He doesn’t feel sober, though. He feels slightly punch-drunk with a soft, heart-tugging joy and a tingling want under his skin for John’s hands all over him, and it’s as exhilarating as it is scary. He keeps telling himself it’s just for another few weeks, and then it will be over, there’s no reason to be alarmed. But as he glances over at John, who’s getting hugged by Molly a bit too tightly if the pained smile on his face is anything to go by, he knows he’s kidding himself.
Sherlock comes back to Baker Street after 69 days, and John is still there.
They both sit up and look at each other. John’s a spectacle of depravity, and Sherlock is sure that he doesn’t look any better.
“Collapsed cake doesn’t sound good at all, isn’t it mushy?” Molly adds.
When they finally turn off the road, they behold their new home for the foreseeable future. Musgrave Manor is a large, ancient-looking mansion near the sea, with grounds that still hint at their former glory as a landscaped park, but which time has turned from formal elegance to enchanted forest.
“You know, sometimes it’s the journey that matters, not the destination.”
Mycroft understands people. He knows how to play with their insecurities and their weaknesses, knows how to build them up and tear them down, knows
Press nights are tedious. After parties are hell. Especially when you’re being shepherded from VIP guest to journalist to benefactor by an over enthusiastic press lady.
"Why would I want another flatmate?" Sherlock asks, and he hopes the dismissive tone will convince Molly to drop it.
Sherlock rushes towards the bed and gently presses him back into his pillow. “Tell me what you want and I’ll get it for you.”
Sherlock curses loudly, glad he’s alone in the attic he’s chosen to keep an eye on two mid-level thugs who might have information on some of Moriarty’s higher-ranking thugs.
John opens it and reads.
“That was a very unfortunate turn of events. We didn’t actually plan on you being there. But it worked out rather well.”
“Absolutely the only filling I will accept for a doughnut.”
“Why?” Sherlock asks, carefully neutral.
“They’re really good,” John agrees. He crouches back down before him, looking at Sherlock with concerned affection. “It’s alright to be scared, Sherlock.”
John shrugs and looks into the oven. “They smell good, but I think I’ll head right to bed. It was a long night.”
But Sherlock doesn’t necessarily view John’s absence as a bad thing at first, because he sees getting John back as an easily winnable challenge. So he decides to make his coming back from the dead both funny and memorable and plays a prank on John.
John grips his aching hard cock, watching Sherlock watch him with hungry eyes, and it only takes a few short strokes and he’s coming, and Sherlock thrusts up a few times and then still and shakes apart beneath John.
“Um... next contestant, please.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock admits into the darkness, not looking at John.
John laughs. “I’m starving for real now. Come on, let’s finish the pasties.”
John turns around on the bottom step. “Yes?”
John distributes slices of cake and everybody grabs a fork and starts eating. John hands Sherlock a plate with a small private smile that makes Sherlock wish they were still… whatever they were, because he very much wants to drag John into the loo and taste that smile. Their fingers brush when Sherlock takes the cake from John and their eyes meet, and Sherlock can tell that they’re thinking about the same thing just now. Then John hastily looks away and Sherlock sits down to eat his cake.
It’s Sherlock, and John finally realises what’s happening: Air raid.
“I don’t think they wanted you two dead, but they were certainly prepared to take that risk,” Lestrade answers thoughtfully.
John swallows hard against the lump in his throat and looks out of the window. “Just, can we not talk about this anymore?”
He huffs a humourless laugh. “That’s exactly how I feel.”
“You said this is your great-grandmother?” John asks, feeling nauseous.
So, this is the point where you get an actual recipe for an actual cake that actually exists.
John gets up out of bed and pulls on his dad’s jumper, checking he’s still got the chain with the watch around his neck. He considers whether there’s anything else he can’t stand to lose, and decides this has to do because Sherlock bursts into his room and grabs his hand. “Come on!”
John huffs a laugh, and it’s closer to the real thing than the smile was. “No. But the aftermath. Hospital. Physio. You know.” He gestures vaguely at his own head and shrugs. “Head stuff.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Easy. Observation. You do it all the time, too, you just don’t realise it. It’s our job as actors to behave like other people, and observing them, trying to understand how people who have certain characteristics act, helps us be better actors.”
Sherlock kissed him.
And if Sherlock sometimes, in the early hours of the morning, when the night’s coldest and the strings of his violin won’t calm the noise in his mind, if he sometimes at this time thinks of that moment when John’s breath hitched, well, nobody needs to know.
When he emerges from the little washroom down the hall, he can finally take in his surroundings. The hallway is dark but clean and several doors lead into sick rooms very much like the one Sherlock is currently sound  asleep in. He opens several doors before he pokes his head into the doctor’s small office. She smiles at him and points to a chair. As John opens the door more fully, he realises the doctor isn’t alone.
The entire two floors are dedicated to the waves of people who came to Temera. From stone-age spearheads to bronze coins, Roman helmets, an  oil painting of the remains of a slave ship that sunk off the coast. A Bible from 1555, a half-crown from Cromwell's days. Letters and photographs from 1918.
See you in a few
The first is dark chocolate with a raspberry jam filling and a thick chocolate ganache icing. It’s very good, and Sherlock thinks it’s probably Irene’s.
“What! How!” John’s on his feet in surprise, but he quickly sits down again as his ribs protest.
“I see your point, but I don’t agree,” John says.
leave.”
Lestrade gets up, and the doctor and John also rise. “Do me a favour and stay out of the Forest for now?” he asks John, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “You did very well, by the way. You’ve got a lot of nerve.”
“This is getting better and better,” John grumbles under his breath, drawing Sherlock’s arm over his shoulders and taking much of Sherlock’s weight.
Rewind.
“What are you baking? It smells amazing.” Mr Chatterjee puts down his mug and looks around curiously.
Early the next day, his mobile rings, which is rare these days, since Lestrade doesn’t talk to him, all his clients think he’s still dead, and he has – temporarily, he hopes – lost his blogger.
“What now?” John asks, hating that his voice sounds so unsteady.
Traffic decreases, and pedestrians are few and far between when he finally allows himself to acknowledge where he ended up.
But then John comes back and Sherlock smiles. “Knew you couldn’t stay away.”
“Kind of,” John admits.
Sherlock shrugs again. “We’ve met. We’re in the same business.”
“A little after 2 am,” John says, gently disentangling himself from Sherlock’s grasp. “I’ll get you a glass of water.”
Sherlock presses his lips together and looks down at his hands again.
“Bollocks,” he mutters, gets up onto his knees and starts groping around the ground for his friend.
They enter the house through the back entrance, careful as always that nobody sees them, and find Billy in his room, making himself a cup of tea. His second-in-command, Ginger, is also there, sitting on Billy’s bed. She’s playing with one of Billy’s knives and looks bored when they enter, her wings beating lazily.
It takes a moment for him to determine where he is. Slowly, the room comes into focus, and he sags back to the bed with relief. Baker Street. He’s in his room, his own bed, for the first time since he shot Magnussen in the head. How long ago was this? Days, weeks? He can’t tell right now, and it’s a little frightening; normally he is perfectly oriented in space and time. But he has no idea what time it is, or what day, or month, or even year. It was Christmas when he shot Magnussen, today could be New Year’s Day, for all he knows.
It’s Tuesday, and he’s oddly dissatisfied with life in general. He shouldn’t be. The first episode aired yesterday. He watched it, and he’s satisfied with his baking performance. It led to his brother’s calls escalating to daily instead of three times a week, and to the deduction that Mycroft must be out of the country, since he has yet to appear unannounced in Sherlock’s kitchen. It also led to the predicted surge of popularity for both his and Irene’s YouTube channels, with his having a slight edge because he won. His hits have quadrupled and his subscribers have doubled. He could quit today, and this entire exercise would have already served most of its purpose.
Nothing further to add this week, I’m afraid. Next week will get more interesting again with the baking, I promise, with the recipe for John’s winning Topfenstrudel, among other things.
Before he can stop himself, Sherlock leans in and mutters, “Anderson, too much flour and he’s overworked the batter. Mike is over-whipping the cream even as we speak, Janine’s sponge is under-baked and will sag in the middle, Mary forgot the vanilla extract she wanted to put in.”
He could hear John taking it someplace nearby,but with the stove close by,he just sat cross legged in front of it.
"No need to worry, I took care of that too. The storage room the solidified cryptocurrency was kept was broken into not by breaking past the high level lock that cost too much." Sherlock smiled and looked at John staring into the small fire before continueing. " It made the clients believe they had more security than they did. Looking closely at the pictures Lestrade sent, the  hinges on the end of the door were too clean. I wrote a text that the door had been taken apart and set aside without needing to touch the lock. I asked to see any pictures or anything studied around the doorknob on the other side, but with the snow and so much powered out, I don't want to get my hopes up too high for when we can find a phone signal again."
The Sussex estate has been kept pristine,and away from the ever cluttering overgrowth of most places because it has been able to be kept under old rules written by his parents.
I know this needs to be seriously edited. I wanted to do a blackmail case where someone would try to alter Sherlock's mind to drive fear into him,but I wasn't sure who to use but Irene trying to train Kate. It was tempting to add a chapter in the here again tale by DEE_Laundry,but after ohlooktheresabee brought in an Omega verse chapter, I thought to simply go in a 3rd direction. Hope it's not a complete disaster
"There is value to be found in such endeavors. Security is made better,and different arrangements can be made otherwise. We're here because this client went from very wealthy to loosing everything. Or so it seems. He may actually have worry,or he may just be another one who follows your blog" he said with a smile.
Since Sherlock had a bad case of this happen to both ears, he would be uncomfortable and probably should not go to the upstairs room until things looked better.
She was too much like John for restrictions she saw no need for to do any good, whether John would agree to it or not.
"We don't have jurisdiction anywhere near Lundy and with the texts not directly stating where different details might be, I cannot even look to send or direct other investigators based on what can only be explained as here say," Lestrade calmly stated, looking down in frustration.
Sherlock was now curled up on one side.
So, Sherlock thought,someone wins a lifetime of earnings,then later goes out and attacks different men? Makes no sense,until he looked over at someone who's armor did not quite move with them like it should. Seemed to have much thinner,padded legs to go up to a bulked out chest, and Sherlock tried to creep closer to where this person was pacing between both tents. He was looked at strangely by the oddly dressed men before he looked up, straightened up.
Here's a picture of a scene in 16
"Take my coat off so I don't get sick? Don't think it usually works that....this IS nice in here" Sherlock rubbed his hands together and held them in front of the heat source.
Out darted a black fox with a white tipped tail.
Well,this went much longer and got much kinkier than I thought,but sticking with some meanings of the prompt and doing good and making connections beyond and not considering yourself. Well, when Sherlock wants to do good and not think of himself, being a tease comes easy. John's less afraid to admit to any downfalls (see to his bff)  but being ok with being attracted to a man when he hasn't his whole life would be a huge change for a guy and bring out insecurities.(aside from homophobia, there's a lot suddenly seen as not known) I know I'll have to re edit the crap out of this, because I wrote it while being asked to help out with a video game I've never played before and don't have an account on. But I keep getting asked to help because I point out the obvious and all I ever do on my phone is delete emails and order more books 😊
Of course Sherlock was using it,and seemed glad to see him, but jittery. He had no one with much maturity or understanding to talk to,and she would give calm, smiling looks and still show she wasn't listening to him at all. This, and no cases at all!
Being a big girl and all.
Sherlock started wakening, and stared into John's clear
"I didn't know you had swimming shorts,but-"
What paperwork? Why are they meeting Katy at a courthouse?
He soon came to a bush. He smiled and walked around it. There likely wouldn't be any messages patterns carved anywhere like the case. Not so close to 221B,and not with all of the ice on everything.
Your need for some structure
Apparently this baby was a she, and she spent the night upstairs with John.
" No don't" John put his plate on the table, and was seeing to Sherlock's plate as it was starting to tip on the arm of his chair. John got the plate on the table,(he ended up finding and digging the silverware out of the chair at a much later time) and held Sherlock's head and shoulder in his hands. " Don't pass out like that! What else do you need!?"
"Show me what exactly? Because I didn't have to leave that crowd so soon" Sherlock mumbled, keeping his eyes away and his head pointed downward.
"It isn't your fault, I've made due before, I can again"
Later on, John had also seemed to live there. He seemed to take the stairs most evenings to sleep wherever they led to.
They were on a cab home after the police had everyone, the rest there were cleared to go home or to their hotels, and Sherlock told and made sure it was written down where the missing people must be kept at.
John walked over to the shower, and turned it on adjusting the temp.
Lianne looked out over the front dashboard of her cockpit as the chopper hovered, then turned and looked at the scene from the pilot side.
Hope I didn't end this on too dark of a note. We all know how the boys feel about each other, even if the line between respect and denial is nearly invisible. Hopefully I respected that as well.
"But there's never a body found,not in any of the cases" Lestrade said,"that's why I called you two, the DNA found on each of the scenes traces back to missing persons cases,but there is never a body. The last scene had samples from two different people!"
John was soon off, and they made a few of these landings (with Sherlock catching up afterwards) before hitting a solid, or at least solidly gravel bottom.
When has Sherlock not been known to get to a direct point?  He got up,threw away his trash, and got back to work.
He was able to help him get dressed,stiff shoulders and everything, and was back in the kitchen to turn the omelette over before lowering the temp and running upstairs to get dressed for work himself.
"*Yawn* Morning. Coffee with sugars?" Sherlock said, stumbling behind and wrapping his arms around John.
She took a bite,chewed,swallowed, and added "how can you make much with a blog when you're already a doctor 'so to speak'" she said with a smirk.
Sherlock hung his coat and scarf up before plopping down on his chair while John made sure the door was locked before putting up his coat and gloves,then turning on the kitchen light and starting some tea.
Sherlock met them at the front door and looked down at Rosie as he walked.
"Hmm hmm,you can't sneak up on me with this flooring, even if I wasn't testing my senses. But it is nice. And if you don't have your jacket,will you take mine?" Sherlock said.
"Oh good! As usual you have things taken care of and found the best suit to wear, while....if they didn't already know me before,they would think I'm a slob next to you." John hung up his coat and bags."Shouldn't be a long rinse,then we'll be on our way". Turning towards the stairs, John turned into Sherlock's chest with his arms propped against the wall, Sherlock cornering him in.
"We have five minutes left, and even with the wind, the pilots are punctual."
Nothing beyond hugging or light kissing for at least 3 more months, and if Sherlock was back to himself.
John tapped on Sherlock's small, hidden ear piece to verify that he still heard static and tapping on his end. He then held onto Sherlock's hand and looked at him, keeping his voice calm. He was not the one he was worried about keeping safe."I know, we went over it enough times, but I'll be crawling and keeping watch hidden among noisy ventilation in an overlooking air shaft. You will be taking orders and keeping your mobile well hidden and on recording even getting past employee check points! I won't be there with you if you're caught or attacked! I know you slicked the curls away for now, but you should have me by your side for this," he whispered, then drew a few, calming breaths and squeezed on Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock sat at the dining room table he was guided to for questioning.
Many fans liked the idea of seeing behind the scenes,but many details were understandably left offline.
By morning,John had woke up and headed downstairs to see Sherlock already up and pacing.
"Patients with allergies often have to rely on other things to use for lube, I'm almost out and know what to use. With you slouched over that way, I can start with the tea. It could use a quick warm up in the microwave"
John looked at the darkness that had dripped down the back of the cabinet door. Oh yes, when Sherlock got the karo syrup...then he focused further back at the one in thought.
On the ride home,John kept asking how Sherlock seemed to know what was going on before meeting the couple. Sherlock started taking his shirt off in the cab and mentioned between human greed,lust, and the illusion of most marriages, it's not that far of a reach.
Looking at the couch behind him, he saw the nightclothes Sherlock had found for him,
He made tea, hearing the shower running as well as the thunder rumbling. The latter, stirring old instincts and nerves.
He started to relax when he heard the front door being unlocked and John walk in,off from his work.
"So let me get this straight" John said to Lestrade.
The hacker leader had built up a set of beliefs he drew others into following, bettering, and defending in several ways like one would think of a cult leader. In truth, the 'leader' was clumsy and a bit of a coward. Pulling and trying to threaten Sherlock with a knife he did not know how to use well himself(the way he moved with it! Horrible form!).
Well,after stripyjumpers had a good cuddle story, I might as well end this with something cute,so we'll see how it goes!
"You are here,with Watson upstairs and away from further danger because you can't and don't just forget. You learn from it and keep going where you are very needed." Sherlock mumbled and drew back to where he could look John in the face.
"How much do you value your trousers?"John asked directly,but looking forward and away from Sherlock.
He turned and crept over to lean against the wall beside John.
John kept him in place on the ground, thoroughly frisking him before rolling him over on his back for further hands on searching.
John looked at the sandwich with wide eyes, and stopped his jaw from dropping. He saw bits of the pink mix that still had some white swirls (did Sherlock mix ketchup and mayonnaise before putting it on the sandwich?), and several layers of pickles on both sides of the ham lunch meat between the bread slices.
Sherlock was soon texting as John let the mix simmer on a covered pan.
"The Woman was nice to battle wits with,but she knew about you. Janine, like other cases which required reaching far, was too easy to work with, and was barely worth the challenge. You are not a means to an end,and if you ever feel like I am falling back to those tendencies,you can end this and still have my respect"
A shoe with the son's DNA was found,but was given to the parents as the only part of thier son they could have. The rest was bits of ash in evidence.
"I need back up and eyes, and a bullet will travel through where you'll be. No one expects to be shot from the ceiling, so you'll be safe!" Sherlock said with an odd grin, and a distant look as his leg started tapping.
Sherlock rose up and kept looking downwards. He soon rolled off the bed and looked at John,crouched by the side of the bed.
Trying to start earlier today since I'm not getting out in this latest freeze.
Normal details usually taken for granted had to be temporary reset to insure the healing. John's work now involved letting Lestrade and everyone know when it would be safe to call and see to not having casework help for a bit.
He smiled at detective Gary Williams as he swiped through paperwork on the tablet screen he carried, walking to the steps Sherlock was currently standing on.
John looking up and smiling at him,then running a hand through Sherlock's hair. Even ran a finger through the cum on his chest and licked it off his fingers.
New bodies were now being found every Tuesday with sand from various deserts in other countries stuffed down thier throats.
When the consistency looked about right, he found one of his clean measuring bowls,and a metal spoon that was drying.
" They hardly get to know me before thier gone" John said, resting his head into Sherlock's shoulder"they care about the title of Dr,they like the stories I tell them about my life". He leaned back and looked up at Sherlock. " They like the blog,the cases,they LOVE you,but I'm just a means to thier ends now it seems". Leaning back into Sherlock's chest, he quietly mumbled," I don't see it as a competition anymore, I just see it as..... maybe I can settle for one night stands now. They don't want me".
An x ray showed an implant in his thigh.
The honey was opened, then a small amount was poured directly into Sherlock's cup of tea before a spoon was dug out of the drawer by the sink to stir it with.
He stood in place, but then felt around him and felt where the wind had stopped nearby him. He walked closer to the stillness, and felt like he was getting closer to a warmth.
Score one for a second of privacy John thought,as he went to his bag and started changing as well.
John had done the emailing, phone calls, and set up the time he had told Sherlock last night.
"What is he doing?"
never far from the sound
It was thought the man had lost his child,then his wife when his company had crashed.
At first, Sherlock and John were happy not to be hurt in the blast,strange as it seemed. Over time,they noticed they never aged, and any injuries,past or present,healed themselves up.
Looking over the links,he saw even if he could cut the chain,the pin would be pulled when the chains loosened and he didn't think anyone,if they survived, would be the same after an explosion to the back of the head.
"I didn't know how long it would take you to find me back here, fortunately,I have a portable stove here, so get in and get your coat off before you catch something" John said.
He didn't suck hard (John was too close,and it wouldn't take much for final closure IF he wanted), but moved his tounge over where John was leaking salty. Then moved his tastebuds along the base at the very bottom of John's cock while trying to breathe calmly through his nose.
Then saw the ears by the skull head and had a suspicion.
He could not take full responsibility for this however. Odd and backwards as it seemed, having someone to answer to really helped him prioritize his thoughts.
John opened his eyes and looked up at Sherlock, "Is this one of the islands without a phone signal? If it is, then we can't use GPS to get around."
"I doubt that John, but I may not be able to join you for breakfast until I really get a few theories worked out to properly induce" Sherlock said as he was pulling slacks on and carefully zipping.(any type of underwear he found too bulky and clung too much to wear with most of his bottoms,so he rarely packed any)
He curled into Sherlock, gripping tighter. It was still very dark out,and quite late.
Sherlock's thoughts were going through his mind, again and again for any nuance, something already did not fit.
I know,less can be more, but when the ideas flood,and life KEEPS getting in the way...
Ok,I got this e done very early,but it turned out so cheesy and mush! Hopefully I didn't do wrong by any characters,and I'll take any crit and suggestions for it! Let me know what you think, even if this is too mushy! I played with the abstract idea of handle but then threw in an obvious in the beginning just in case anyone got fussy and nitpicky,but if you don't like it, tell me and I can cut that bit out without disrupting the tale.
"Makes sense,it would be quite a decent down payment for this"
It gave him nothing that he deeply needed, was parched for.
He then hung his towel up and went to the bedroom.
He could see right by the gripped blanket the end of a red patch that was starting to darken.
Then he still held Sherlock down as he moved his legs,grabbed Sherlock's jacket, and shoved him into the other wall.
"His cyber security is still sub-par. I was able to look into the helicopters they have on staff and see what's available on my mobile alone! Mycroft must be itching for a holiday at one of his houses. He might still think I don't know about all of them! He kept the key to the Lundy house wrapped in the paper wrapping around the fern at his desk. He might be setting us up because that was too easy, but there is a storm coming that would hinder anyone who might try to follow us. I wonder if he encrypts his messages in the same code he used when we were children, or if he uses another predictable randomising pattern like he does for his computer files? This is so exciting!" Sherlock rattled off at a hard to follow pace, holding his mobile in one hand and clenching his fists.
" Yes,among other things. It also makes sense that many medicines come from a posion. Snakes have always been lovely for people to keep around,as long as they know how to respect them" Sherlock said, looking and smiling at John.
"Later on, I'll have to use the bellows to keep the stove going" John said,"but for now? take your shirt off and....while your hands and arms are around me,go ahead and get mine. Direct heat can work best for now"
How could he feel bad about daydreaming about watching the man who had saved his and other's lives? Raising a daughter with?
He got up,got both coffee's and took them back to the bar. John soon followed to get away from the death glares the couple were giving each other.
Yes, everything he wanted and more. He should have seen the trap there.
Yes,what I describe actually exists in London to those who haven't heard. See where reaserch can take you?
"It will be alright, just stay here and don't wait on me. I'm going up to get Mistress."
He hung his coat,then expensive suit and all,flopped on the couch.
John will be home at 11, then they were set to meet Katy at the local courthouse,then then they are to meet up with what army mates could be gathered by Sholto at a high end restaurant/bar.
"Adjust yourself John! You're not making it easier for either of us! Although with your past experiences,and the fact that you can do anything at all right now...No!" Sherlock hissed, shaking his head.
"About time someone got here, keep watch here in case they come back,but I feel they won't. If she's kept on the run,she won't have time to bother with too much trouble. At least not anything that couldn't be kept small. Here's the phone I was given. " Sherlock said, recognizing the pilot as one of the MET staff he saw at times,but never got to know well."Everything recorded in a long sound file. She knows better than to try too much now,her and her pet, even if they didn't know they were recorded. Stretch your legs and let's get back to London John!" Sherlock said, giving the cell to Lestrade,who had ridden along before jumping a few times and walking towards the helicopter.
"So,the changes bring libedo?"
John sighed, Sherlock had been fussing at himself since they got back,but seeing him so frustrated over the life of a child? He smiled. Sherlock was never heartless, despite what many think,but he did have his group of Irregulars that helped him,and he was very attached to Rosie.(Who was still staying with Molly until tomorrow)
"That will be done John," Sherlock said with a grin. "I was able to text a pilot to have us picked up from the roof on the office building next to Mycroft's. Used Mycroft's word coding and even kept outgoing address concealed so it still looks 'hidden.'" He curled the first two fingers of each hand sarcastically. "The way the government is known to. No reason anyone will look into it, we have 45 minutes to get there and get picked up on the roof. I've already called a cab here, so get the bags and head outside. Will not be long!"
A well accepted type of known  lie
After reading chapter 7 from the ohlooktheresabee's prompt, this type of chapter ended up writing itself. It is based more on the metaphorical interpretation that velvet is comfortable, and once in it, someone would love to stay in it and not change,but it still fits the prompt. What Sherlock mentions about the title being in literature and strategic is true,let google be your guide
Oh yes,what are they up to now?
Ok,back to very basic ideas and little time, let's see where the boys take us now!
He moved his foot and clenched his fist. Of course! The way she was talking, showing,instructing Kate how to manipulate people.
Sherlock drank the rest of his tea before setting the cup down and staring at John wide eyed.
All spouses with serious injuries. All soon spoke up in thier countries about the lack of solid support in seeking help with the abuse.
It was no use really. If Sherlock said he wanted anything more binding than John's help with the rent, help with the cases. He already had one marriage he watched go down,he didn't know how he would keep together if this did as well.
Unfortunately,one of those things involved killing,then incinerating the body of the teenager that found what was assumed to be hidden for years.
"Can you sit up?" Irene nudged Sherlock,who now could feel that he was sitting on a floor, with his back against a wall. He opened his eyes and was almost startles.
He never said,and Sherlock never mentioned. John washed, rinsed, and jerked off in the shower at those times, and Sherlock always lowered his head when he heard. It wasn't worth it it seemed. John always left the shower and spent the time in a much more level headspace until he went upstairs to bed. John could never want to be anything but a friend, consulting partner, or upstairs flat mate to someone who...he felt the silver ring he had  in his left mini pocket in his full sized pants pocket.
He calls himself all sorts of names in his head. Stupid, selfish, weak.
“We’re planning a heist, obviously,” John says, deadpan, and Sherlock bites down on a laugh.
But then John turns and looks at him and there’s a faint smile on his face, wistful and sad, and something inside Sherlock goes,
“Thank you.”
Surprised, Sherlock watches him a bit more closely. Moriarty is the name associated with a rather famous food blog called The Consultant Baker. It specialises on reviewing bakeries and restaurants, and posting pretentious recipes that all supposedly answer questions from readers, but never actually do. He always thought that Moriarty was a myth, that the blog was run by several people, because Moriarty is never in any of the food porn pictures he posts on Instagram. Apparently, though, there’s an actual man, and from the looks of it, he’s exactly as much of an ass as Sherlock always thought he was.
Sherlock is still very close, hands on John’s shoulders.
Harry shrugs and looks out at the slow-moving traffic. “She didn’t want him to. She always said he was the one who had the brains to be anything, do anything. She said he’d finally be the one to get out of the fucking council estate.” Harry snorts a humorless laugh. “Well. He got out all right.” She shrugs, and when she speaks again, Sherlock can hear the sadness in her voice, “She died when he was sitting his GCSEs. Hit us all pretty hard, but he was devastated. Dad sold off every moveable piece of the bakery and let the lease lapse. It’s a fucking Tesco now.” There are tears in her eyes, and she wipes at them angrily. “Fucking hell.”
Without letting him think about it too much, he opens John’s blog on his phone, and hates himself a little for the thrill that goes through him when he sees a new entry.
John opens his eyes and looks at him. His eyes are red-rimmed and feverish. He frowns and raises a slightly shaky hand to rub the space between his eyes. “I don’t know. Which is funny, because I’ve been preparing for this since Mary buggered off to Morocco, and I’ve got nothing. The thing is, I can’t even just tell Rosie all the ways she’s like Mary, because I’ve got no idea what she was really like, and what was just an act. Hell, I’m pretty sure she wasn’t even blonde. And anyway, Rosie’s already much more like you than she was ever going to be like Mary, and thank Christ for that.”
“This is riveting telly,” John remarks as he looks around the room of bakers, lounging around, waiting for their dough to prove.
“Shall we get down to business, then?” Janine asks, checking her watch. “You’re paying me by the hour, after all, and I do have other clients.”
"He's worried about you. He would never say so, of course, but he is," Molly says, having followed his gaze.
“Remember the mouse, Molly?” John says, taking a sip of his beer and shifting so Mary, who’s leaning against him on the sofa, isn’t poking her elbow into his ribs.
The judges move from station to station. The pies are mostly competently made, but with one glance, Sherlock already knows that only Irene’s, Moriarty’s and his stand out. Irene’s is textbook perfect, brown, flaky crust, not a soggy bottom in sight. Her filling smells perfect as well, and the judges are thrilled.
John grins. “I’m never bored.”
Sherlock takes John all the way home this time. It’s still raining cats and dogs when they reach London, and John gives Sherlock directions to the block of flats his bedsit is in.
“Sherlock!”
John shrugs. “Let him.” He looks steadily at Sherlock, and Sherlock feels this entirely unfair warmth in his stomach. “We know the truth.”
John smiles back, and this time he seems to be actually here, in this kitchen at 2 am. “You know. Nightmares. Psychosomatic limps. All that shit. The things psychologists charge you a lot of money for talking about it.”
John hums and makes a ‘go ahead’ sort of motion with his right hand.
Order your own coffee. - SH
Warm hands frame his face. Sherlock is leaning in, holding John’s head in his hands. “John.” His voice is warm and soft and very close. “Breathe.”
Sent: 5:49 am
“You like him, don’t you,” Irene states quietly, having followed his gaze to John. “I thought you were just shagging, but you like him.” She looks at him and shakes her head, and her tone softens even more. “You poor sod, you’re completely besotted.”
“Yes.”
Mycroft turns to Sherlock, and there’s an unpleasantly superior smile playing around Mycroft’s smug face. “This development certainly explains a lot.”
“You kept it classic, but with a twist, good showing,” Moran adds.
“Bakers, you have two hours. On your mark, get set, bake.”
They’re wedged into a table of their favourite pub, just around the corner from the theatre, where the owner knows their names and turns a blind eye to the occasional cigarette. John’s sitting between Mary and Molly, and Sally and Dimmock, their carpenter/sound designer/driver, on the opposite side.
John frowns, confused. What the hell was that?
“You look like you’ve done this once or twice before,” Mrs Turner remarks, sounding fondly amused.
“I’d really rather not talk about it.”
“Would you go back if you had the chance?” Sarah asks.
Finally, John relents and nods. “Yeah, all right.”
“Mrs. Hudson, how long have you been here? On Dera, I mean.”
John lifts his head and smiles a smile he doesn’t mean. “I’m going to shower. Want some dinner?”
John rolls his eyes and reaches for the hand mixer again. “So. Eggs into the butter-sugar-mix. Add one at a time, or all of them at the same time, I think it doesn’t make that much of a difference. And by the way, if you have a really large tin, add more flour and an additional egg, because you don’t want the cake to be too flat.”
John walks over to Sherlock and wraps his arms around him from behind, wrapping them both in the sheet. Sherlock’s skin is cold under the thin robe, and John wonders how long he’s been up and whether he slept at all.
“Daddy! Daddy!”
John has no idea what Sherlock’s talking about, but he grins anyway, because he knows that Sherlock just solved the case, and in a moment, they’ll be out of the door, with the baby monitor safely with Mrs Hudson, and they’ll run into the darkness once more, and when the killer is caught, they’ll go home. Together.
Then Sherlock turned towards Lestrade, " Keep an eye out for any boats rented towards Lundy for the next few days."
"That I am,though the medical part of this operation is currently at his work. I could help you with anything else, because trust me, it takes a lot to surprise me now." Sherlock said,then turned, unlocked the door, and stepped inside.
Here's jumpers tale
" They weren't always " John said,while trying to get small angles and such just right before dabbling a bit of soft sealant on Sherlock's ears,both real and artificial. " They were very motivated by emotion and even got very violent before finding a calmer path in more fact and logic based ways. Well,most did, but THAT'S more explanation than we have time for" he said as he finished the final steps on both ears.
Later on, many familiar faces were stopping by and there were talks of something being solved. Even John was coming by, and he was getting into Sherlock about going out and solving cases without so much as a coat or decent shoes on.
"Before we had 221B, I had not moved in for long before you showed up,as we had agreed. Mrs. Hudson wanted to help me out, as I had helped her out before. You know this,so " Sherlock gave John a scrunched up look and peered through slit eyes. " What is it? Why are you wearing that look?".
"No,I got a call that said a ride sent from Mycroft is waiting to take us to the local police station here, and to bring you"
"How do you even know what will fit me if the other outfit was in the wrong size?" Sherlock asked, looking down at his outfit.
Of course Lestrade and John were talking with thier backs turned to him. Sherlock seemed to turn his head away and back to talking with those two whenever Anderson looked to check that he wasn't being seen.
Getting the necklace from Poplock was harder. He moved more, and was almost awake easier,but Rosie was big and knew how to be careful.
"No need to hide it, that should help with pain or swelling."John said, pointing to the medicine with the knife. He then put the knife down,rinsed a few eggs, and cracked then into a bowl.
This could go in several directions, and there is a lot to play with! Martin pulled it off very well, but I'm not sure how well John would feel about running around with big,bulky hobbit feet 😋
This was the living room window that overlooked Baker Street, but right now he couldn't really see through the latest layer of ice that covered everything.
"Hello again!" John cheerfully told the driver as he got in behind Sherlock.
"I thought this would go better because it was in a different setting" John said before slumping himself in his chair.
"How are those two getting home?" Anderson asked,pointing at a now empty space where Sherlock I John had been walking away.
Sherlock felt tired,then slouched as she walked away. He could not find the energy to stand up,or sit straight, and was soon out.
Febuary is almost over,so let it leave in fluff and daydreams.
He had the photograph that was included. On the back it said " No trace of help,or he'll wish I had killed him. Whose the damsel now Johnny?".
John sighs and rubs a hand over his face, wondering how many times they have to have this conversation. “Of course you can handle it. But it is my problem, since you’re my friend and I care about you. Also, I’m your doctor and lack of sleep is severely unhealthy. Lie down on the couch. Doctor’s orders.”
He answers, which he normally wouldn’t, thinking it might be John.
I WANNA SEE THIS SO BAD
“Well, if I spill the sugar, nobody fucking bleeds out,” John snaps. He rubs a hand over his face and sighs. “Sorry. I…” he looks at Sherlock and away again, and Sherlock knows he pushed too far. The flirty, bantering mood between them is gone, and the man standing in Sherlock’s kitchen is essentially a stranger, the carefully hidden side of John Watson Sherlock suspects very few people ever get to see.
“Oh, there was nothing wrong with my childhood as such, I suppose,” Sherlock says with a shrug. “My parents were nice, my home was comfortable. I just disliked being a child, generally. Constantly being told to eat, sleep, get dressed, wash, comb your hair, do your homework, don’t do this, don’t do that, and nobody takes you seriously in an intellectual discussion.”
“Shove over,” Sherlock says, from very close by.
Sherlock smiles at nothing in particular, glad that the social contract in public transport forbids eye contact. He checks his emails and sees that the Bake Off producers have sent them the information for next week's theme. “Hidden”. The technical challenge is filled and unfilled doughnuts, and the showstopper is hidden design cakes.
“Are you worried?”
“Don’t bother, I’ll tell him,” John says, clamping a hand over Sherlock’s mouth to keep Molly from hearing him giggle.
, something soft and serious. “You have the best laugh,” John says quietly. “You should laugh more often.”
It’s early morning when he wakes up. He washes and changes, then goes downstairs to have breakfast before he rushes out of the door to see whether Sherlock’s awake.
John laughs. “I didn’t know your channel was this action-packed.”
Indeed, when they approach one of the men guarding the city gates, he takes one look at them and frowns. “What’re you two supposed to be?”
“Of course. You and me against the world, just like it used to be,” John says, but Sherlock can hear the doubt there, the uncertainty, the lie.
John swallows around the lump in his throat and looks out of the window again. “I’ll never forgive you for any of this. You lied to me for two years. Every time you saw me, you lied. Every word of comfort, all lies.”
John sticks a knife into the potatoes he’s boiling to see whether they’re cooked. Apparently they are, so he goes to the sink and pours out the hot water and replaces it with cold water from the tap. He comes back with the pot and starts peeling. “So you’re using this space for your videos and your jam-making?”
“But that’s completely unfair.”
John does as she says, helping her lift Sherlock to undress him. Sherlock starts retching again the minute he’s upright, and John quickly grabs a bucket from under the bed for Sherlock to dry-heave into it. He looks absolutely miserable when he’s done and John helps him lie back down again. He gently runs a hand through Sherlock’s messy, sweat-damp hair. “You can sleep in a moment, the doctor is just checking your shoulder.”
Sherlock’s lips twitch in spite of himself. “If you’re trying to find out whether I’m single or not, you’re not being subtle about it.”
“This isn’t remotely funny,” John mutters. “Not even a little bit.”
She fixes him with the same appraising look he knows his own face is showing.
The kiss deepens, opens, and John feels it down to his toes, this thing between them finally out in the open, and his entire body tingles with a lovely, low-humming arousal that’s not urgent but not sedate either.
Sherlock sets down his box and goes to work. He tests the ovens, the draft, the distance to the next exit, the temperature of fridge and freezer units. Then he quickly weighs oven quality and temperature fluctuations and finally picks the workstation furthest from the tent entrance.
“I’m not an amateur,” Sherlock answers.
“Well, that was interesting,” Sherlock finally says. “I’m knackered, though.”
“Among other things. Well enough to read a recipe book, anyway.”
“I wasn’t going to go into the statistics of lift-related deaths with you,” Sherlock answers, aware that he sounds more than a little defensive.
“Well, the Norman French…” Sherlock starts, but Mrs Hudson interrupts him. “See what you started?” she says to Mrs Turner. “We’re a baking show, not a linguistics programme. We will never settle this debate. Now John,” she continues, turning her back to Sherlock and Mrs Turner. “Tell me what you’re baking.”
Their room is dark when he comes in, and he almost misses the outline of Sherlock’s form under the covers of his bed. He’s got his back turned to John, and if it were anyone other than Sherlock, John would assume he’s asleep, but since Sherlock rarely sleeps, it seems most unlikely.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says. “See?” He rounds on Sally, who has followed him into the green room and is glaring at him in a way John is very familiar with from countless reactions to Sherlock from cast and crew alike. It’s the
I’m sorry. -SH
He smiles at her gratefully and returns gentle pressure on her hand. “I think that’s probably for the best right now.”
“Sherlock, as for you,” Moran continues, and a hush falls over the tent once more, “I don’t think anyone has to tell you that you’re a spectacular baker. You’re the baker I was looking forward to most every week, you always came up with something interesting. I think it was clear you’d make it to the final in the first episode, so I don’t think anyone will be surprised that you’re in the final.”
“What?” he asks, but Sherlock doesn't answer, he just points.
John shakes his head. “Sure, that’s the way you prepare food. But that’s not what food
John waves him off and takes a sip of tea. “Does it matter? I’m sure you had your reasons.”
But what Molly is offering him, he realises, is an alternative. A career, a life away from the expectations and the limitations of the family and the society and the country at war he left behind.
John is next, and the judges are dismissive of his savoury scones, but when they all taste his poppy seed danish, silence falls.
He gets up and makes his way down to the kitchen for a glass of water. Maybe he’ll see what teas they’ve got.
"What do you think you're doing?" Sherlock demands, setting the pot of tea he just made down on John’s bedside table.
He’s surprised when the other boy’s lips twitch ever so slightly, like he’s trying not to smile. “I’m dissecting this rabbit,” he says, gesturing at the cadaver. “Now, if you don’t mind,” he adds, turning back around to continue his work.
Silence, Sherlock notices, is an odd thing. He never noticed how silence can be active, the absence of specific sounds. Like loneliness, as opposed to being alone. Being alone never bothered Sherlock, he considered it to be natural, restful, a state of being. Loneliness, however, is an active absence.
When Sherlock picked John up this morning around six, he didn’t look like he’d slept at all. He fell asleep in the car and slept all the way through to Bath.
So he just gets up and walks away.
Sent: 4:10 am
It’s still pitch dark when John opens his eyes. Sherlock is sitting on his bed, staring at him. He groans and turns around, trying to pull his blanket over himself more firmly.
“I just pointed out that my hands are bigger, after you asked me a question. I started absolutely nothing. And you realise I’m going to have to edit this out, meaning more work for me, so please just stick to the baking.”
Sherlock doesn’t even meet his gaze, he’s just staring at the floor as if it holds the answer to everything.
“Any of what?” John asks, keeping his tone carefully neutral and academic. “Sex?”
Sherlock’s eyes snap open and he looks at John intently. “He’s coming back.”
Sherlock exchanges a look with both Molly and John and they all do their best to hide their smirks.
Instead he bakes another cake, and this time he watches it collapse in the oven, and when he tastes it, he wonders how something so imperfect can be so good.
Molly is next. Her eclairs are perfect, crunchy and fluffy and her pastry cream is light and lemony. The judges love the dark chocolate icing.
Irene holds out John’s cane. “Found this hanging from the oven door.”
“What does that have to do with anything?” Sherlock snaps, irritated at how everything always seems to lead back to this.
John smiles and turns around to bury his face in the folds of Sherlock’s coat. “What would I do without you,” he mutters against Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock looks away from John, because that smile does things to Sherlock he doesn’t want to think about.
Fortunately, most of the time, John is exceptionally careful with Sherlock’s heart.
John reaches out his hand and grabs Sherlock’s in the dark without opening his eyes. “I would.” John squeezes his fingers tightly, then lets go. “You’re a wonderful baker. I would consider it a very sound investment.”
Wrapped in his dad’s jumper, he settles into bed. He should feel lonely and abandoned and adrift, but in actual fact he feels relieved and free.
“That’s sort of the point,” John answers, and the amusement is in his voice as well now.
“Last night. Tried to blackmail me into paying him more, threatened he’d quit. I told him to go ahead. He did,” Mrs Hudson answers, and John is once more struck by the disparity of her. Little old lady on the outside, pure steel on the inside.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock says, getting up and throwing clothes at John’s head. “We’re leaving. Now.”
“He won the mini-Bake Off, stop complaining,” John says, reaching for his wine glass.
“The little French place, with the chocolate thingies.”
He thought that at least Sherlock remembers their time together fondly, even if it wasn’t meaningful the way it was for John. Well, now he knows.
Sherlock’s stomach rumbles and just like that, the tension dissipates. John smiles at him fondly and slides the plate over. “Want to share?”
“Terribly unprofessional,” he agrees, and when their eyes meet, John feels warm all over, and he wonders whether Sherlock is thinking what he’s thinking, about how they’re alone in the theatre, and in the old days Sherlock would have already pushed him up against the kitchen counter and would have already had his pants down and his head…
“This is deeply unhealthy, I hope you know that.”
“He said that too. But the Fey’a helped us, Mrs Hudson, they’re not dangerous.”
The front door of Speedy’s opens and John steps into the kitchen a few moments later. He smiles at Sherlock, obviously in a good mood. “Hey. What are you up to, you look like you were miles away.”
Sherlock draws back to look at John, who gazes back at him, deceptively calm, but Sherlock can feel the tension in his body. He snorts. “Are you actually worried that I’ll say no?”
Irene turns off the camera, and John makes his way over to Sherlock. He’s holding something behind his back. “I’ve got something else for you,” he says quietly.
One, Mycroft, again.
It’s long after midnight when John is finally declared fit to leave. He feels like he’s been run over by a bus, still drowsy from the drugs that were used by whoever kidnapped him to knock him out, and his lungs hurt from the smoke inhalation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sounds nice. We’ll let you get on with it.”
It alarms him now. It alarms him that he knows John’s work schedule. It alarms him that he recognises John’s handwriting from his gran’s recipe book. John’s walk, his smell, his humming while he bakes, the way he favours his left leg, the way he clenches and unclenches his hand to hide the tremors, it’s all deeply familiar now.
They linger in the Pantheon. It's just before closing and most tourists are gone for the day. The ancient silence of the place makes something deep within Sherlock sing, like a plucked violin string, a peace he never thought he could achieve.
“Small family surgeries? Sniffles and strep and old ladies with UTIs?”
John never drinks because he’s mortally afraid of becoming an alcoholic. He joined the Army because he couldn’t help either his father or his sister and hated watching them destroy themselves. He almost certainly tried to kill himself at least once, after he figured out he couldn’t operate anymore. He still dreams of Afghanistan, and a lot of these dreams aren’t bad. He loves and hates the work in the clinic about equally. He dated Sarah because he thought he should, not because he actually wanted to. Sherlock’s not the first man he touched, but he’s the first man he really
John grins wickedly. “Careful what you wish for.”
But then Donovan says, “You know, these are perfect and all, but I can’t see how these make you nostalgic for anything. Nostalgia is supposed to make you think of your grandma’s kitchen, or Christmas mornings, but this is just a very good dessert I would get in a high-class restaurant. This isn’t what the show is, Jim. So I give you full marks for technical, but I’m afraid this isn’t at all on topic.”
He flags down a cab, and helps John get Harry into it, then watches as John gets in as well. Their eyes meet as Sherlock gently closes the door behind them, and Sherlock can’t even begin to identify the emotions squeezing at his heart, bittersweet and rich like the best kind of chocolate.
“Let’s see,” Sherlock muses, and John knows what will follow now. Sherlock will put their killer together like a three-dimensional puzzle, and John only hopes he will be intrigued enough to listen before he kills Sherlock. Obviously, that is Sherlock’s plan. Keep the killer talking until backup arrives.
Please, John, let us pretend that we’re adult men and refrain from using meaningless punctuation marks to poorly mimic human emotion. -SH
John lifts the corner of his mouth in a half-smile and takes a sip of his tea. He closes his eyes for a moment and just breathes, then he shrugs and looks at Sherlock again. “Me neither. The questions they ask. What was it like, getting shot? Well, it fucking hurts, that’s what it’s like.” John rubs at his shoulder, right over his scar, with a deeply frustrated gesture.
, instead he just shrugs. “Of course.”
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea and takes a deep breath. Then he decides to speak honestly and directly to his brother for maybe the first time since the onset of his adolescence. “Mycroft, I think it’s past time that I acknowledge that I put you through hell. And I am sorry. I’m sorry for the lies, for stealing money from you, for making you watch me nearly kill myself. But you need to see me for who I am now, not the junkie I was. I’ve been clean for six years, Mycroft. And I put in the work. I pulled myself together, built a business, made a life for myself.” He looks at Mycroft, meets his eyes, wills his brother for once in his life to actually
“I love the glaze, what is it?” Lestrade asks, taking another bite of his pie.
Three options.
Sherlock sets down the water, thermometer and medicine on John’s nightstand and goes to empty out the waste paper basket into the loo. He cleans it out a bit and brings it back with him.
“Are you actually going to drag him into court?”
“So, Sherlock, how do you feel about winning?”
“Why?”
“Sit back down,” Sherlock snaps. “If he has anything to say to me you’re not supposed to hear, he’s welcome to come back when he’s actually invited.”
Different variables, different data set entirely.
“Really? Is that why you’re talking about finding pieces of rotting meat he left in your fridge in the tone people talk about their first dates?”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says. “Stake out the museum? I’m assuming they’ll try to rob it without Kitty now.”
They return the way they came, Sherlock finding his way unerringly. Apparently while John was stumbling after Mr Lestrade in an exhausted daze, Sherlock was paying very close attention, because he leads them straight to the gate they used last night to get into the city. The watchmen pay no attention to them as they walk out of the city gates, and soon they’ve left the city behind. It’s a sunny day, a breeze is blowing from the sea, and John feels invigorated by the sun and the fresh air.
Voices. Glass shattering.
John grins ruefully. “I think I need to delete the entire thread. Maybe the entire blog.”
The other contestants and the finalists’ guests start arriving. Molly’s fiance is hovering in the background, looking uncomfortable, but Irene scoops him up and soon he’s chatting away with the other bakers. Anderson, Dimmock and Black Forest Gateau are standing awkwardly together. Sherlock barely remembers them, and it brings starkly into relief how much has happened in the last few weeks. They seem to be from another lifetime, another him.
the most.”
Irene has the judges raving with her walnut and cheddar scones and her Vienna swirls, which are technically perfect and look gorgeous.
“My point, young man,” she says, mock-glaring at him over her reading glasses,” is that I know something about Sachertorte. In Austria, the jam in the middle variant is more popular, and I have to say that I agree. The jam in the middle makes a rather dull chocolate cake spark. So my vote goes to John.”
“Let me see.” Harry all but elbows John out of the way, nearly lurching from her chair. John grimaces and hands her a slice of cake.
Sherlock is glad that what he’s doing is complicated. He feels truly challenged for the first time since he’s been here.
John watches him, following his gestures and his words with rapt attention. “Your point?” he asks when Sherlock’s done.
“Admittedly, the telecommunication situation was unfortunate,” Sherlock concedes. “I would like to point out, though, that we nearly suffocated in the bank vault.”
watching the building.
It’s night. He’s sitting with his back to a giant, ancient oak, hands and feet tied in front of him, ropes around his torso fixing him to the tree. Every breath rubs his bruised ribs against tree bark or rope. It’s, true to British understatement, unpleasant. Actually, it’s agonising.
Abruptly, Sherlock stands. “I can’t do this. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock’s by the window, playing the violin, wearing a silk dressing gown and nothing else. He’s playing something achingly beautiful and sweet, and John smiles, because he spent many early mornings like this, listening to Sherlock play, and he realises now that Sherlock was trying to say something through the music he wasn’t ready to say in words. You make me happy, the music says. I’m letting you see me like this, naked and vulnerable and baring my heart to you, are you listening?
“Please, I barely have a trust fund. My brother sits on it like a vulture waiting for a fresh corpse.”
Irene is working steadily, slicing apples. Moriarty is painting leaves cut out of pastry with red and green food colouring, and Sherlock rolls his eyes. Many of the bakers are making their filling now, pastry resting in the fridge. Some are nervous, some seem confident, and some are having fun, exchanging small smiles and a word or two. John is crushing walnuts, using a dish towel and a rolling pin instead of the KitchenAid right next to his elbow, which would give him a more even consistency. He’s humming contentedly under his breath, and his station smells heavily of cinnamon. His workstation is also a mess, and he is covered in flour, in short he looks exactly like the kind of amateur Sherlock thought he would meet here. Sherlock turns away, already bored.
John shrugs, half embarrassed, half defiant. “I saw it on YouTube. There’s this chap who’s got a baking channel. Bit of a posh git, but he’s got some good ideas about baking.”
The back door opens, and suddenly John is there, standing in the kitchen and staring at Sherlock, who’s sitting at the table with a cup of tea in the dark.
Mr Chatterjee smiles. “I would love that.”
“What?” John sounds genuinely surprised at the question.
There's also a lot of bakeries in Vienna. Like, on every second corner. Many of them are chains, but they’ve got good stuff. And there’s plenty of coffee houses where they make their own cakes. So do yourself a favour: If you’re in Vienna, skip the Starbuck’s ;-)
“Should be okay now,” John says, opening his eyes to look at Sherlock. “Thanks for taking Rosie.”
“Another one from your world?” Lestrade asks, having watched the interaction.
Sherlock looks up at him, at his fond smile and the laugh lines around his eyes, at the soft blue jumper and the way it’s going to feel under his hands. “You said something about the loo?”
“Sherlock Holmes, John Watson,” Sherlock says, pointing first at himself and then at John. “We’re looking into your friend’s death.”
“I would have taken that bullet for her if I’d had the chance,” Sherlock says.
“None of his victims will come back to life if we don’t bargain with him.”
“He’s not my young man, mother. He’s not as young as all that, for starters, and he’s not mine, anyhow,” Sherlock grates out between gritted teeth.
“I should have helped her with the lights, not left it to fucking Mike.”
Sherlock looks at John, who’s fallen silent, like whatever he wanted to say seems stupid now.
He’s a few steps from the window when he hears voices.
John doesn’t say anything for a long time. Then he puts his hand over Sherlock’s on his skin. “Would you do it, if it were the other way around?”
The Gate.
“How long?” John asks, and curses himself for an idiot for not seeing the signs sooner. Sherlock is restless, pale, with a crackling, manic energy about him that’s never a good sign. John had put it down to understimulation - they haven’t had many cases since they came back from Devonshire - but he realises now that it’s sleep-deprivation.
“Lya, stick to the point,” the Midnight Queen chides her gently.
Sherlock is quiet for so long that John's sure he won't answer. When the answer comes it's so quiet John barely hears. “My father.”
There’s nothing to say to that, because John isn’t entirely sure how to put into words how difficult it was to forgive Sherlock, and how easy. Essentially, Sherlock did what he did to save lives. There’s no way to spin what Mary did as anything other than purely selfish panic.
Resolutely, he walks past the car.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Could I trouble you for a cigarette?”
“Just how many layers of clothes are you wearing?” Sherlock demands impatiently, shoving John’s jumper aside to get to skin only to be met with a t-shirt and a vest.
He doesn’t make a move to get out of the car. He doesn’t even really seem to have heard Sherlock.
For a moment, Sherlock is quiet. Then he sighs and stops writing. “Truth be told, John, I don’t know.” He gestures at the equations. “This is a waste of time. Understanding the physics of it is important, but it won’t get us anywhere.”
“Ridiculous, it has to be north,” Sherlock scoffs.
“No,” is what he finally says after what feels like an eternity of silence. “I’m… I don’t want that. Clean break, we agreed.”
And just like that, Sherlock knows what he was missing. Crunch. Texture. He nods silently to himself and thinks of how he can get a bit of crunch. And then it occurs to him. Filo pastry instead of shortcrust or puff pastry.
Sherlock shrugs and keeps walking. “I’ll know when I find it.”
“Likewise,” Sherlock says and wishes that John Watson’s attractiveness were in any way diminished by him being sweaty, covered in flour and wearing an ugly apron.
“Mind your own business,” Sherlock snaps, not taking his eyes off John’s retreating form. “Not much,” he adds grudgingly.
Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner chuckle, and John calls over, “Oi! What do you mean for once? I always make excellent life decisions.”
“Stay here.” Sherlock nods at a nearby tree, and John hides himself behind it.
“I don’t know, dear, and I can’t say that anyone’s ever told me anything of the sort, and my family was from that village originally,” she begins. “But then again, the only one who ever told stories in my family about that time was my great-grandmother, and she was just a wee child when they came through.” She smiles wistfully. “I still have a picture of her with her father. Do you want to see it?”
“You need me to get out of here so you can reset?” Sherlock guesses, and John gives him a slightly embarrassed nod.
Between beating his eggs and melting his chocolate and sieving in just a little flour, he looks around the room. The hosts are going from station to station again, and pretty much everything is going as he anticipated it. The Black Forest Gateau woman is completely overwhelmed. Anderson is neglecting his cake to comfort her. The carrot cake woman - whose name, he gleans, is Janine - looks undeservingly confident.
he thinks as he looks into John’s eyes, so full of love, and finally, finally
Sherlock leaves with the two Watch members, and John follows Molly to Sherlock’s lab area.
He’s unpleasantly surprised when he finds both his brother and John in the kitchen, having a rather serious staring competition.
Sherlock goes first because he's serving his creme brulee souffle with a caramel ice cream.
Irene looks directly into the camera. “These are both good cakes, but Sherlock’s is less sweet, and I like that better, so I vote for Sherlock’s cake.”
“Well, win some, lose some.”
John raises his head and gives Sherlock a fond smile. “I wondered where Sherlock comes from. It’s a highly unusual name. But then again, you are a highly unusual person.”
“Right.”
Finally John is standing in front of him, near enough to talk to, near enough to touch.
Sherlock parks the car at a bus stop, and John gets out, grabs his duffle, hesitates with his hand on the car door. "Thank you," he finally says.
“You didn’t,” Sherlock says, not looking up from his microscope, tone steady and deeply sure. “You never do. Go back to sleep.”
Sherlock, by contrast, gets a letter almost every day, many of them in ever-changing code, and John gets the impression Sherlock enjoys the code-breaking more than the actual content of the letters.
Sherlock bites at John’s neck, and John’s hands grab Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock moans when John’s fingers brush along the hem of his pants, and he thrusts against John mindlessly, seeking heat, seeking friction.
Sherlock has been gone from 221B Baker Street for 68 days when he wakes up from a drug-induced catatonia in a dingy hotel room somewhere in Eastern Europe.
“Go back to sleep,” John says gently. “I’ll get her if she needs anything.”
It must be sexual frustration. Maybe he needs to make the time and mental space to take care of his bodily needs better.
The young actor who played Sherlock’s lover is hovering beside him, trying to catch his attention. John knows, from Sherlock, that the kid has a bit of a crush on Sherlock, and that Sherlock has so far been unable to quash it even though he’s been as unpleasantly blunt to the kid as he possibly can. Even if Sherlock hadn’t told John any of that, the besotted expression on the kid’s face would be enough to clue him in. He feels a bit sorry for the boy; on the other hand, he needs to learn boundaries, otherwise he’ll get his heart broken constantly in this profession. Just because somebody kisses you passionately on stage doesn’t mean they’re in love with you. Character bleed is a nasty habit you can’t break young actors out of soon enough, at least in John’s humble opinion.
“Don’t mind if I do,” Billy says and drags the other chair over to their oven.
“Why not?”
“The war,” John answers. “He was a soldier who didn’t come home. One of many where we came from.”
Yes. -SH
“When they opened the gate for the last time, for the people from the village, did they really take half their food?”
John smiles. Sherlock has mastered the art of rolling his eyes with his voice.
John huffs a laugh."Didn't expect you to.” He drains his beer and sets it down. “I’m going for a walk.” He looks at Sherlock with a slightly embarrassed smile. “Care to join me?”
The next one has to be better. It can’t get worse.
“What happened?” John asks compassionately.
He rolls over to his side and enjoys the cool sheets against his skin for a moment. It’s August, and the days are endless and hot, and he enjoys these mornings for the cool, fresh air as much as for the quiet.
He walks towards his car when he notices John sitting at the bus stop across the road.
John belatedly remembers that Sherlock hasn’t met Mary yet. “Mary Morstan, lighting design. Sherlock Holmes, our newest cast member.”
Oh my god, you two. Get a room.
His mother has booked the suite on the top floor, as always. When he walks in, the party is already in full swing. People dressed to the nines are milling about, eating canapés and drinking punch or champagne. Sherlock knows exactly none of them, but then again, he pays hardly any attention to them, because from the second he’s handed his coat to an attending waiter, he’s scanning the crowd for John.
He leans in again, and she meets him halfway. This time it’s a proper kiss. Her lips are dry and a little chapped. She smells like something flowery and the lye soap from the clinic. It’s nice.
He separates the eggs and smiles into the camera. “Never got the hang of the thing where the chefs crack the eggs with one hand.” He looks at Sherlock. “Can you do that?”
Order me some coffee
Sherlock turns to John, grinning gleefully. “Come on, where’s your sense of adventure?”
Sherlock snorts but makes himself comfortable on John’s bed, not protesting, and that says a lot about how tired Sherlock must be. John lies back down again, accommodating himself around Sherlock’s sprawling limbs. It should be cramped, but Sherlock somehow fits himself into all the spaces John doesn’t need, and John pulls the blankets around both of them, too comfortable to complain about Sherlock waking him up and then taking up half of his bed. Truth be told, he likes it, even though he would never admit it. He’s not supposed to like sharing a bed, he knows they’re too old for this. But Sherlock doesn’t give a toss about what he’s supposed to do, and John is inclined to think that Sherlock has a point.
"Yes?"
“Sherlock.”
John smiles wistfully. “I suppose you could say that. She had a small bakery, and my mum and dad were working a lot, so my sister and I spent a lot of time in the back room of her bakery, helping out. I was cutting out biscuits and making scones in primary school.”
John is pretty sure Ya’ra is the Feyara word for mother, and he’s somewhat surprised that the Fey’a ruler would allow them to address her so informally.
It’s quiet in the wings, and warm, and dark. Mike’s calling sound cues, and Molly and John are preparing for the scene change, but they’re consummate professionals and barely make a sound. Their black clothing and soft-soled sneakers make them seem like moving shadows, benevolent theatre elves.
John’s cookie dough needs to rest, so he says something about getting them dinner, and Sherlock nods absently as he squeezes the lemon juice into the poppy seeds, then makes careful notes of how many grams of poppy seeds he added.
“Apparently. How did they find one on Earth, though?” John asks.
Then he turns and walks away, and this time Sherlock lets him go.
John’s shoulders tense up a bit again, but relax when Sherlock rubs his palms over them ever so slightly. “I don’t know that I have, completely, it still hurts sometimes.” John turns around and looks at Sherlock, and the expression on his face is both fond and sad. “I guess I just remembered that there’s a part of me that’s not a doctor, and not a soldier, and not broken.”
7:04 pm.
“Morning,” Molly greets him. “Did Dr. Sholto send you to get me?” she asks nervously. Molly hates days like this, when there’s so many people and they can’t really help all that much.
It also gives you too much time to think.
They come in periodically and beat him.
The judges all taste, and for a moment, they’re silent, stretching a dramatic pause.
The sitting room is populated with ten or so members of that network, and Sherlock is standing in the middle of the room, pacing between them, checking what they’re doing. He’s in pyjamas and a dressing gown, and his hair's a mess, probably because he’s running his hands through it constantly; in short he’s in full mad-professor mode. Each of them has a clipboard with a questionnaire on it, and each is holding a pencil and filling it out.
Sherlock doesn’t answer for so long that John almost thinks he won’t. Then he wordlessly reaches into his trouser pocket and withdraws a much-folded letter. He hands it to John almost absently.
He imagined waiting for John under the Falls themselves, but getting to the Falls in the dark would probably kill them both, he decides when he gets there about eight hours before midnight. So he hides himself in the woods near the ascent to the Falls and decides this will have to do.
This has been an excruciatingly long run. Six weeks of overcrowded dressing rooms, dirty dishes overflowing the tiny kitchen sink, beautiful polyester costumes reeking of sweat.
John eats his porridge and looks out of the window. It’s a lovely, sunny, warm day, and he can’t wait to go outside. “What’s there to do here?”
“Of course it makes a difference,” John says, wearily rubbing a hand over his face. “Intent always makes a difference.”
He’s explaining the chemistry of it while the mixer turns the cream into curd. He turns the mixer off and looks into the camera again. “So, Rule One. Always, always whip cream by hand. It’s nearly impossible to over-whip it when you do it by hand. Rule Two: If you’ve already curdled your cream, don’t throw it away.”
She gives him a thumbs-up. “Great. Now let’s see, I want to get a bit more for Glen, so he has a choice of what he’s going to use. Why did you decide to enter the Great British Bake Off?”
So he asks into the darkness, “What do you think happened to Kitty?”
There’s a sharp, piercing sound of sirens giving the all-clear, and slowly, everybody rises to their feet. John’s very aware that Sherlock’s still gripping his shoulders, and he too seems to suddenly notice it, because he lets John go and gets up, seeming a little embarrassed.
John affects Sherlock like nobody else ever has (or very likely will). John makes him feel, John makes him care, John makes him
“Why?” John asks, and Sherlock admires the way his voice is so completely calm, so very expressionless. His eyes are still trained on his computer screen, and he’s pointedly not looking over at Sherlock, like he wants to give him privacy.
But John was happy with Sherlock. Before. Usually he had some boring girlfriend on the side, but they were little more than cover stories John told himself, and sometimes a good shag. All the things that
John nods, and silence falls again.
At lunch - cheese sandwiches - John doesn’t see Sherlock, so he goes into the library, a large, rather stuffy room, with shelves somewhat untidily stacked with books, some of them obvious schoolbooks, other volumes more ancient and leather bound in locked glass cases.
He drops his eyes and looks at his hands, heart beating like he just played an especially energetic game of rugby. “I honestly don't know.”
“Coffee, John?” Lestrade offers, carefully neutral, but he looks amused.
The next day over dinner, John’s still parsing what Billy told them about the gate, and the Fey’a.
Start again.
Sherlock helps himself to a cucumber sandwich and a scone, and silently scoffs at the poor quality of both.
“Lovely presentation,” Lestrade says as Sherlock puts his cake down. It’s topped with chocolate-glazed raspberries, drizzled with dark and white chocolate and small chocolate shavings.
“I wonder,” she says, in that way she has, where she sounds cool and detached but is actually angry. “Why did you come after me, if you don’t think I’ll stay?”
When the door closes behind her, Sherlock makes a lunge for the package. John gets up as well and they both stare at the package for a few seconds. It’s not large, wrapped in brown paper, the name
Five inches.
“To the Gate, obviously.”
John apparently doesn’t really expect an answer, he turns to his workstation and starts unpacking.
“No.”
“Good,” Sherlock says. “I wanted to show you something I thought you might appreciate.”
Sherlock doesn’t stir.
“Yes.”
“Now me, now me,” Adriana says, grinning.
“Thinks he’s better than us, the arrogant sod,” a man gripes, loudly enough for Sherlock to hear.
Silence falls, again, as they stare at each other in wordless emotion, and Sherlock slowly but surely begins to panic. What to say, it can’t be this difficult, what to say.
“You do that.”
Sherlock shrugs. He doesn’t actually care, five random people’s opinion on the nuances between two very similar recipes won’t lose him a second of sleep. What he won’t admit even under torture is that the entire thing, from the challenge to filming John bake, to John filming him while baking, to this judging thing, was the most fun he’s had in literally years, and probably ever while completely stone-cold sober.
John grabs his coat sleeve to stop him from going, and Sherlock turns around, looking at him questioningly.
He all but flees into the kitchen and fixes himself a cup of coffee, then drinks it without really tasting it.
“Yes, well, I never thought I’d see someone on a baking show wear chef whites unironically, so there you go,” John says in a deceptively neutral tone, but there’s an underlying steel in his voice that is, frankly speaking, hot.
“Okay, thanks, Sherlock, I guess.”
Experiment. Now you.- SH
John nods. “Well, the powidl is a classic, the others are sort of my twist.”
John cracks his neck from side to side and yawns. He’s almost asleep on his feet. It’s Thursday, and it’s been a rough few days. He came down to the basement for some of Molly’s grain coffee, and saw Sherlock sitting bent over his microscope. So he sat down in the only other chair in the room, the one near the door, the one John always sits in when he waits for Sherlock to be done so they can go home. He leans his head back against the wall and enjoys the quiet for a few moments.
If only he’d come home. Sherlock doesn’t expect it to be like it was before. But maybe, if John comes home, they’ll be friends again. It’ll be enough. It’ll have to be enough.
But first, he pops a breath mint into his mouth and doesn’t allow himself to question why.
Sherlock laughs and the sound echoes around his empty kitchen. Something curls tightly behind Sherlock’s breastbone.
“You realise I can’t shut up and say something at the same time, right?” Sherlock snaps, both a little irritated and a lot hopeful because John’s giving him that look, that
“I’ll do nothing of the sort, thanks a bunch,” the killer says, still grinning. “You’re not going to shoot me, and even if you did, I doubt you could hit a cow if it stood still right in front of you, never mind a moving target in the dark.”
“Well, it doesn’t really matter all that much, since I’m bound for the Army anyway, you know, family tradition and all,” John concedes.
Sherlock can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t keep his eyes open, he’s drowning in sensation, John’s voice, his breath in Sherlock’s ear, his hand on Sherlock. Sherlock moans and John swallows the sound with his lips, kissing Sherlock like he’s dying, like they’re both dying, and Sherlock’s entire being is reduced to one thought:
What he doesn’t remember is that John drags him out of the pool, presses his lips to Sherlock’s to get him to breathe, and massages his heart for about a minute before cardiovascular activity recommences.
John gets up and throws another blanket over Sherlock. “You’ll get pneumonia,” he says, not expecting to get an answer.
Sherlock nods, once, and he knows that this is his cue to leave, but somehow, he can’t bring himself to walk away.
“You could just walk away,” Sherlock points out when it’s clear that John won’t elaborate.
“Rosie’s asleep?” he asks, letting her go.
Nothing happens for two days. John tries to focus on his clinic work, but he’s worried about Kitty and distracted by the news about the gate, and finally Sarah corners him.
Mrs Turner is enjoying the moment, though, and is taking her sweet time. “Well, I love Sachertorte. I lived in Vienna for two years after culinary school, and I worked in this charming Cafe in the first district, a smoke-filled hole in the wall with cheap coffee and good cake. Our regulars were nearly all students, who’d stretch out a coffee to last them the afternoon, and who chain-smoked while waving around Mao’s Red Book and talking about a revolution.”
Sherlock snorts. “Thank you, but I’m fully confident in my ability to out-bake you, I don’t need to resort to sabotage.”
John smiles into his glass of water. “I’m going to re-read the autopsy reports, maybe I’ve missed something.”
Sherlock closes his eyes and summons the entirety of his remaining patience. “All right. I will let you go to work, I will even go with you, if you can manage to get to the loo and back without assistance.”
John swallows hard around the lump in his throat, relieved that they’re finally, finally having this conversation, and he has a chance to say what’s been weighing on him for six years. “No. No, you were right to take that role. But if you’d taken five minutes, if you’d sat me down and said, look, I need to do this, this is the chance of a lifetime, I would have bloody understood, and I might not have gone six years questioning whether you ever really cared about me at all.”
Sherlock laughs, and the sound reverberates in the empty auditorium. John looks out at the sleeping theatre, and then back at Sherlock and reminds himself that Sherlock is right. The audience will return. His crew will return. Theatre will return. And until it does, he’s loved and needed and that’s so much more than just enough.
@thescienceofbaking
Weren’t you?
Sherlock looks at John critically. “Bad night?”
“That’s sort of his job, he is your agent after all,” John says, leaning over to read the email. His entire body goes still, and Sherlock tenses up for the inevitable explosion.
"Conjecture or experience?" John asks. He gestures at the bartender for a half-pint, and Sherlock is both glad for the company and frustrated that this company has limits.
Sent: 6:08 am
“That I should stop covering up my insecurities by yelling at my DSM. Completely destroyed my authority with the cast, but it was actually pretty constructive advice in the long run,” Lestrade says with a grin, and everybody laughs.
“What do you think it's pointing to?” John asks, following the direction the lodestone's indicating.
“Thank you.”
The oven is cold; he doesn’t feel like baking. For once, his mind isn’t quieted by the process at all, and he can’t spend a minute longer in the kitchen with twelve perfect mince pies mocking him from the counter.
Sherlock texts Lestrade.
Lestrade looks from Sherlock to John, fixing them both with his most forbidding glare. “I mean it. I know you think the Gate has reopened, but it was destroyed. You saw that with your own eyes.  And even the Fey'a don't know how to open a new one.”
John does his best to shrug while moving as few muscles as possible. “We knew it would happen sooner or later.” His voice is rough and hoarse, and Sherlock helps him to drink a bit more water.
Just out of curiosity, Sherlock, where did you see that recipe book? At John Watson’s flat maybe? From his bed?
John tries to process the entirety of the letter, and finally settles on, “The fire was small?”
me with the truth?”
He’s standing on the other side of the crowded room and is surrounded by his usual gaggle of rich theatre patrons, press and admiring fans.
John blinks, once. Takes a breath. And another. And another.
he gathers his strength, and takes a deep breath. The darkness actually makes it easier. “I’m not sure I want to go back,” John says, rapidly, just to get it out as quickly as possible.
"Anyway, it was a lovely christening, though why Mary chose me for godfather is anyone's guess."
“We can’t bargain with him, Sherlock,” John says pre-emptively.
snogging the life out of John.
Sherlock exchanges a quick glance with John, whose fingers have tightened around his tea cup, and subtly shakes his head.
There are too many emotions choking Sherlock’s throat to name. His own grief for Mary is so complicated that it would take days to unravel. There’s guilt there, and pure, ice-cold hatred, and love, too, because she was Rosie’s mum, wasn’t she, and there’s a sort of kinship he felt with her. But he also knows that the extremely tentative equilibrium they’d reached after she shot him would never have lasted, that something had to give or something would break. Well, something gave, and something broke anyway. The one thing they had both agreed should not break. John. So in a way, he feels like he and Mary both failed John, deeply and profoundly.
, of making him sleep. Nobody’s ever done this to Sherlock, and Sherlock’s never
John Watson again, commenting from the wings of his mind palace. He waves the intrusion away, like swatting at a fly, but then his eyes land on the Bake Off ticket, and suddenly he knows what to do.
Sherlock shakes his head. “Raisins and poppy seeds don’t go together.”
“You sound confident.”
It’s two in the morning when Sherlock finally stumbles in, literally tripping over the doorstep into the room.
“Why the leg?”
Sherlock trails off mid-sentence, and John prompts him quietly, “Keep talking. You were saying, about the man with the moustache?”
Stop flirting, you two, you’re in public. It’s bad enough in the tent.
“What about you?” John asks, proud of himself for how steady his voice sounds when all he wants to do is step closer and rest his chin on Sherlock’s shoulder, nothing more, really, just touch him in any small way, tuck the sleeve of the dressing gown he’s wearing over his dress pants and still-crisp shirt. John sometimes wonders how Sherlock manages to always look like he just changed, when John mostly looks like he was just hugged by an overly-affectionate gorilla with sticky fingers.
John grins unrepentantly. “You deserved it for being an incurable smartarse.”
“So, Molly,” Mrs Turner asks, watching as Molly carefully slides her savoury pie into the oven, “what do you think is the most important quality a good baker should possess?”
“I suppose that's a good thing?” Sarah asks.
I’d pay good money to see that.
Sherlock stops next to him, and together, they watch the rain in silence for a while.
“Congratulations on the win, Sherlock.”
Sherlock moans and bucks up against John, already hard and desperate and wanting. “Touch me,” he whispers. “Please.”
Adrianna laughs, and pats his arm affectionately. “I’ll go get tea. Want some?”
Around lunchtime, John tries to get him to eat something. Sherlock ignores him in favour of his violin, until the music gives him a headache and John gives him paracetamol and he falls asleep on the couch. When he wakes up the second time, John has made some more tea, and neither of them mentions the night before again.
John would probably say yes, Sherlock knows he’s not remotely ready for that.
Not that the silence is awkward, precisely. But it does feel heavy. Like words need to be said that Sherlock doesn’t necessarily have. John’s watching him in between shoving chips into his mouth, an adrenaline reaction, no doubt, the body asserting its aliveness by demanding sustenance. He remembers that dinner after John shot the cabbie, how they couldn’t stop grinning at each other, how John shovelled down fried noodles like he’d never see food again, and huffs a little soundless laugh at the memory.
The challenge was boring, or would have been if it hadn’t been for the time constraint. Trifle isn’t something he usually makes, but baking a sponge, making custard, doing something interesting with fruit and stacking it all up in two hours was, well, not challenging, exactly, but it absorbed enough of his attention to make the time pass quickly. Molly won, with a well-balanced combination of berries and a delicious chocolate sponge. But the judges have made it clear that it’s going to be close tomorrow, because all of their trifles were well done.
Sherlock shrugs. “I made one yesterday. While you were at your boring job.”
He takes out the butter and places it into the freezer to get it nice and cold.
He grabs Sherlock’s coat lapels and spins him around, walking him back until they’re tumbling onto John’s too-narrow bed.
Then, softly, ever so lightly, he presses his lips to Sherlock’s.
Sherlock tries out several answers.
And the Gate. It’s an ever-present drumming in his ears, behind his eyes, vibrating between the very bones of his skull.
“How did you…”
“Interesting, that one, isn’t he,” Irene muses, following Sherlock’s eyes to John. “Surprising depth, for all that he looks so entirely harmless. I wonder what he’s like in bed.”
John stares at him in disbelief. “The Gate? Why? For what?”
Sherlock smiles tightly and nods. Two days. Two days to figure out what to say.
“That you’d make a mistake.”
“I need to go,” John says in a voice Sherlock barely recognises. “My sister. She had an accident.”
Sherlock wishes there was some way to refute John’s logic, but there isn’t, really, given that right now all that’s holding him up, or more precisely dragging him up the stairs one at the time, is in fact John Watson’s tiny frame.
“And are you having fun?” Mrs Hudson asks, winking at him.
And then Sherlock notices that John is standing under a sprig of mistletoe Mrs Hudson has taped to the doorframe.
Today they end up in the market square, where a band of Fey'a artists have set up a makeshift stage and are juggling and performing songs for an appreciative crowd of city-dwellers, both human and Fey'a.
Sherlock shrugs and eyes his sandwich suspiciously before he tastes it. He’s surprised that it’s not half bad. “He’s a food blogger. What can he do? My best guess is that he’ll bitch about us on Twitter.”
John looks at him sideways and smiles. “Good luck with your bake, Sherlock,” he says gently and moves back to his workstation.
“First of all,” John mutters into Sherlock’s shirt, snaking an arm around him. “There’s such a thing as the Internet, and there’s such a thing as aeroplanes. With a reliable DSM around I can actually take time off now, so I can come visit you, and you can come visit me. Secondly,” John looks up and grins, “I’ve waited around for you for six years. What’s eight months to that?”
But he can’t very well ask John not to get married and then not provide a better reason for it than,
John nods, obviously embarrassed, and he gives Sherlock a half-smile. “Good. Second degree tea burns aren’t fun.”
“But the company is better,” John adds, pointedly not looking at Sherlock.
Sherlock closes his eyes, but not before giving John a deeply suspicious glare.
“I wanted to,” Sherlock says, and he still sounds like somebody poured acid down his throat. He feels like it, too. “I wanted to.”
“Fine.” Sherlock schools his features into something resembling thoughtful nostalgia. “I liked baking as a child with my nanny, and after getting a Master’s in chemistry, I began studying the chemical process behind baking. When I discovered that people know next to nothing about the chemical reactions behind the simplest of recipes, I started my YouTube channel.” He turns to Emma. “Is that enough?”
But then he locks eyes with John, and John says, very slowly, very gently, “Sherlock. Let me go.” There’s no fear in his voice or his eyes, no submission, no danger.
“Your YouTube channel is all science, no stories, you’re a bit of the other extreme. No wonder you hated each other on sight,” John says with a grin, then he adds, “Well, that, and he’s clearly a wanker.”
“I’ll send you the link.”
The doctor fetches needle, thread and fresh bandages and something yellowish that looks like antiseptics. “Some Fey’a medicines have funny side effects for humans, so I’m taking their ointment off, also this will heal more neatly if I stitch it up. I won’t lie, this will hurt,” she says gently to Sherlock.
“Try for a little less cheer, maybe?” John says, wincing at Sherlock’s cheerful tone.
Their mission goes spectacularly wrong. They knew who he was and what he was doing. Somebody tipped them off.
“Gladly,” Sherlock says, still leaning seemingly casually against the door, but effectively blocking Billy from running away. “Turn out your pockets, then, and prove me wrong.”
John looks down at the ground, apparently a bit embarrassed. “I’m looking for my cane,” he says, and there’s something in his voice that dares Sherlock to mock him.
@bakinglover212
John holds out the phone. “Read for yourself.”
Later, after Sherlock all but pounced on John as he came out of the loo, after a playful wrestling match that turned into passionate snogging that turned into Sherlock fucking John from behind with John’s filthy, wanton moans muffled into Sherlock’s pillow, after John fell asleep, fucked out and spent and relaxed, Sherlock shrugs into his dressing gown and goes downstairs on shaky legs and bare feet. He retrieves the recipe book and sits in his dimly lit kitchen, leafing through the recipes. Sachertorte with jam in the middle - completely unnecessary - the Linzertorte recipe from John’s first showstopper. Vague about jam and flour, but the spice blend is in there, and with precise quantities for once. Sherlock memorises the exact recipe and stores it in the vast recesses of his mind palace, then starts turning the pages again.
Emma laughs. “No. Worth a try, though. So, two last questions, then we should have enough material. First, who’s going to win, and who’s going to be in the final three?”
“Oh, Johnny boy,” Jim sing-songs. “You’re lucky I’m in a playful mood. Otherwise I’d just torture you until you’d tell me where the lodestone is.”
John is looking at him, the dim lamplight making him look like a sepia version of himself, all drained of colour, something soft and unfathomable in his eyes, and Sherlock’s smile fades because he doesn’t know what John is thinking about right now, what he sees when he looks at Sherlock like that, and he wants to know, he
John snorts. “Oh God, yes. Some things never change.”
Sherlock decides to ignore that statement and starts packing up his workstation until Irene gets the hint and leaves, but not before throwing him a knowing smirk.
Sent: 6:14 am
“Why on earth would I want to go on television with ten idiot home bakers who are probably overwhelmed by a simple yeast dough?”
Sherlock is about to doze off when they get a text from Mycroft.
Sherlock says, tone carefully neutral, “And you want to take it?”
“This is a surprise, I must say,” Mycroft says after they’ve been led, silently of course, into the guest room of the Diogenes Club. Sherlock hasn’t been here in years, and it’s still as pompously over-ostentatious as he remembers, but he does understand the need for absolute silence for a mind like Mycroft’s.
Irene is flirting with him. And not subtly. Sherlock thinks he will have to have the talk with her soon. Right now he’s just trying to react as little as possible, because the tension elevates the performance.
“I don’t know, Sherlock.”
“It’s fine,” he repeats the answer he gave Harriet. “The swelling has gone down.”
“Twenty,” Billy answers confidently.
“Hey. Wake up.” Gentle hands, gentle voice.
“Too salty,” John says as he bites into his pasty after finishing one of Sherlock’s. “And the cream cheese is all wrong, the consistency isn’t supposed to be like this.”
Sherlock’s been gone from Baker Street for 82 days when he wakes up in a small inn in Reichenbach, Switzerland, with a naked John Watson plastered to the entire left side of his body.
Sherlock grumbles something  under his breath about Hippocratic oaths and doing no harm, but he unbuttons his shirt and lets John take a look at the gash in his shoulder.
You can serve it warm with custard, or cold with icing sugar on top. This is one of THE Viennese classics, together with apple strudel, and you can get this anywhere, pretty much. With varying degrees of raisins ;-)
John rubs a hand over his face and yawns. “I need to get some sleep.”
John checks his compass and shakes his head.
“Dark chocolate has entirely different properties than white chocolate,” Sherlock says automatically, before he’s even made a conscious decision to speak. “White chocolate has a higher fat content and less starch. You probably used too much cream, and you didn’t properly refrigerate it. Also, the white chocolate chips you used were of inferior quality. It’s always a mistake to not try things at home before you do them in competition.”
“You two’s all right,” he says, then turns to go.
John holds Sherlock’s eyes until he’s convinced Sherlock is serious. At least for now. “Okay.”
“I never lied about how I feel about you. Or Rosie,” she says quietly, looking down at her hands. “Can you say the same?”
Deeper and deeper into the woods they go, the fog slowing them down considerably.
Slowly, Sherlock becomes aware of what exactly he is doing. He becomes aware of his body, of the stiffness of his limbs, that he’s thirsty, and freezing. He places the photo back where he found it, between the well-worn pages, and carefully closes the book. He drinks a glass of water and goes back to bed, trying to ignore the warmth in his chest and the smile that tucks into the corner of his mouth.
Sebastian shakes his head.
“Forgive me if this is a tactless question, but how did they die?” John asks.
“Come back to my room,” John pants into Sherlock’s mouth.
“Odd how?” John tries for casual and is pretty sure he fails, especially since he’s also pretty sure he’s blushing.
The crew mill between them and get a few reaction quotes, and then they’re all asked to assemble before the judges to hear who’s won and who’s out.
Hour eight, and still no sign of the cake.
And he has even less desire to meet someone he will hate instinctively for
John flings the phone back down.
"No more or less than most people, I'd imagine," Sherlock notes.
Sherlock looks at the cigarette and silently thinks to himself that John makes a good point. But putting out the cigarette would prove John right, and Sherlock hates it when people tell him what to do.
Maybe two :-)
At some point, John joins him in the sitting room. He sits in his chair and listens to Sherlock, just being there, like he was there in Sofia and Kiev, in Malta and Nice and Beijing and Dubai and Serbia.
Sherlock looks up at John and raises a questioning eyebrow. “What’s funny?”
John yawns and tilts the computer screen a bit so he can lie down and still see Sherlock.
Sherlock’s sitting at a small table, palms pressed to the surface of the wooden tabletop. The killer’s sitting on the other side. He’s tall and almost too lean, hard muscles standing out against his reed-thin form, attesting to a wiry strength. He’s wearing very modern British looking work boots and, incongruously, Fey’a-style leggings and long tunics. He’s also got a nasty smile and a gun trained at Sherlock.
“It had no Wi-Fi and no phone reception. When I found you there you were ready to chew the bark off the nearby trees,” John says, gesturing at his head to indicate Sherlock’s deteriorated mental state.
Mrs Turner draws her hand back with exaggerated care and grins at him. “We’ll just leave you to it, shall we?”
He shuts his mouth and spends the rest of the hour staring out of the window.
notice, because I was high out of my mind. If it weren’t for our crackpot dealer, you would be dead.”
But when John reaches him, he doesn’t hesitate; he takes the cigarette Sherlock was just about to guide to his mouth out of his hand, throws it away, then fists his hands into Sherlock’s coat and pulls him in for a kiss, hard and demanding, and Sherlock doesn’t know what’s going on, but he definitely likes it.
Irene grins and holds up her phone. “Smile, Sherlock.”
Suddenly, the entire circle seems to be spinning. John loses his footing and falls to his knees, disoriented and nauseous, the pressure in his ears almost unbearable. He screams, “Sherlock!” as he presses his hands over his ears.
“We’re going to have to assume so,” Sherlock answers, stopping in front of the oven. He opens the door and stabs the fire viciously with the poker Ginger gave John last night. “Damn Jim, I’ve spent years cultivating a relationship with them, and he just… pays them better!”
He has work to do.
“That’s not what I’m hearing,” Irene quips.
“And who knows what might come of it.”
And now there’s Mary, and she isn’t a cover story. She’s the one John goes home to. She provides both the cover and the substance. She saved John, the way Sherlock had done. Saved him from his loneliness and his depression.
John shrugs. “I’m starving.” He sees Sherlock’s hesitation and holds up a hand. “No pressure, I just thought... “ he makes a helpless gesture. “Look, we’ve…I don’t know, we haven’t really had a chance to just, you know, talk?”
It’s not a question, but Sherlock answers it anyway.  “No.”
“She certainly wasn’t surprised.”
“You don’t actually expect me to comment on that, do you?” Sherlock says, and fervently hopes that the camera doesn’t pick up on the heat he can feel rising in his cheeks.
He smells it on the stairs. Sugar, butter, flour. Baking powder. Vanilla. Someone is baking scones.
Sherlock laughs and twines their hands together. “My pleasure.”
he adds silently,
Sherlock doesn’t look over at her. “You did ask.”
“Precisely,” Sherlock says. “And I intend to hold you to that.”
“Yes, of course I want you to come back with me,” Sherlock says, and he hates himself for the barely hidden desperation in his voice. “Come on, John, adventure, you and me against the world, just like it used to be. We can have this again, we can have our lives back again.”
Molly tapes down the edges of the bandages. She turns and looks over her shoulder at Sherlock, who's given up all pretence and is hovering outside the door, looking in through the glass. "Should I let him in before he gnaws his way through the door?"
There’s a bit of an awkward shuffle with the menu, ordering, and then the waitress leaves them alone with Sherlock’s cooling coffee, and Sherlock has no idea what to say.
As it turns out, John’s hands, his mouth, his breath against Sherlock’s skin, are like conductors for silence, because when John touches him, Sherlock’s mind goes still.
Baker Street is never quiet. Even at 2 am.
Sherlock is the last contestant in the tent. He waited until everyone else was gone and packed up his things as quickly as possible, eager to leave this battlefield of a day behind him.
Sherlock rolls to his side to face John and props his head on his elbow to look at John, naked and tousled and sweaty, the light from the lone bedside lamp picking out the gold in the fine hairs on his arms and legs. He looks good enough to eat like this, and even though Sherlock has already tasted his fill, he’s still hungry.
@thescienceofbaking
Silence descends. Sherlock watches him. John watches back. The only light in the stairwell comes from the open sitting room door.
He argued with Mycroft for days.
Sherlock snorts. “As if you’d let me forget.”
Sergeant Donovan steps out from the shadow of the half-collapsed barn, aiming a nasty-looking crossbow at the killer. “Hands over your head, if you please.”
“Nothing,” Sherlock answers, even though he isn’t entirely sure that’s true, because he would never have invited John into his kitchen if they weren’t… whatever they are. Temporary sex mates? Aquaintances who fuck? Bakers with benefits?
Then he starts the test.
John glares at him over the rim of the glass. “Sherlock, you’re the last person on earth who should lecture anyone on temperance,” he says, a little more sharply than entirely warranted, but he immediately deflates again and sighs. “But, as usual, you’re right. I’ve had enough. I’m too old to get roaring drunk, however much I might want to.”
Sherlock shivers a bit at the tone of John’s voice and the sudden nearness of his body. He opens his mouth and John feeds him the bite-sized piece of potato. It’s a perfect mouthful of food, the warm mealiness of the potato turned creamy by the melted butter, the salt a perfect tickling on his tongue. He looks down at John, who’s smiling at him in a way that makes Sherlock’s stomach flutter. John is standing very close, and suddenly the room is very small.
“What? Where are we going?”
@hyperfixatedbaker
“All this flattery will go to my head,” John remarks dryly, and Mrs Hudson laughs.
That first time was pure instinct, shooting the cabbie before Sherlock could take that pill, John knowing with absolute certainty that Sherlock would take that pill, that he couldn’t not take it, that it was a compulsion, and John stopping this farce the only way he knew how. Of course Sherlock instantly knew, and it changed everything between them, changed the way Sherlock looked at him, made them a team, an ‘us against the world’, a unit.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You’re a competent baker. You’ve done very well so far, so the chances of your bake tomorrow being adequate at least are high. Stop being insecure, you have no reason for it.”
When John Watson is twelve years old, he stumbles into another world. He also meets Sherlock Holmes.
“Still doesn’t count,” John says, but he’s slightly out of breath, and he can’t let go of Sherlock.
John dips a spoon into the nearly black jam, and spreads a bit on his scone. He takes a bite and chews thoughtfully. “Blueberries, obviously. Something else, I can’t quite put my finger on it.”
“Try the jam,” Sherlock says, pushing the jar over to John.
“Why didn’t you?” John asks, walking a bit closer to Sherlock.
When John gets to the rehearsal room, Sherlock is already there. He’s an early riser, or rather, John remembers, a non-sleeper, and he loves being the first in the room.
“I could ask you the same,” Sherlock points out and sits next to John on the steps.
She picks up first ring. “John. I’m on my fucking way. What the hell happened?”
“What?” John asks, the pain in his ribs making him a little snappish.
“Sherlock,” John says, and there’s something in his voice that’s almost… gentle, almost… like it was before, like so often when he’d say Sherlock’s name and it was almost an endearment. Sherlock’s eyes snap to John’s, and John says, quietly, “And how would that have been better?”
The answering huff of air means John’s torn between being annoyed and amused, and Sherlock knows he’s won. It feels good, winning over John. It always feels good, getting this self-sufficient, upright, sober, serious man to concede something to mad, delinquent, messy Sherlock.
“This is beneath you, Sherlock. The venue is small, the pay is bad, and you’ve already done the part. I thought we agreed that you’d only take parts that are artistically challenging to you. If you’re not challenged, you get bored, and that’s when you indulge in unhealthy behaviour. And I thought we agreed six years ago that you were better off not getting emotionally entangled. It draws your focus, Sherlock.”
“Guys, time for the judging,” Emma the contestant wrangler calls from the tent entrance, and the three of them hastily put out their cigarettes and go back in.
John takes a bite and cocks his head. “It’s good. Did you use my gran’s Fladen recipe as an inspiration?”
Silence falls, then Donovan says, “I have to say, that’s your best bake yet. And that’s saying something. Last week I felt your bake was good, but it wasn’t anything special at all, nothing that told me anything about you as a person. But this? This makes me think I got to know you a bit better.”
That’s true enough, Sherlock has to admit it. He’s had colleagues who have done shows with everything from stomach flu to broken bones to kidney stones. He himself has worked through pneumonia, a broken wrist, and the worst of cocaine withdrawal. Generally, in theatre, you work if you’re not a) dead, b) currently in labour or c) too ill to stand up.  Unless you have an understudy, which John very much does. "Carol can call the show."
"Yes. Are you taking a cab tomorrow or going by tube? Because if you're taking a cab we could share."
He takes out his phone and opens his text program. He enters Billy Wiggins’ number and thinks about what he wants.
“Phone Mummy, she worries,” Mycroft says in lieu of goodbye, and walks out of Sherlock’s flat.
Sherlock nods again, an acknowledgement of the thanks and a dismissal of its necessity at the same time. “I’ll help you get her into a cab.”
“So far you don’t disappoint, Sherlock,” Moran adds, and Sherlock smiles in what he hopes is a genuine way and hopefully not expressing what he’s thinking, which is,
“Bad idea,” John says from behind him and Sherlock starts violently, turning around, cursing the remainders of the drugs in his system still clouding his senses so much that he didn’t hear John approaching. John is leaning in the open bathroom door, clad in pajamas and an ancient robe. Some of his things are still in his room upstairs, Sherlock deduces, he hasn’t had time over the last few days to move everything back to the house. So Sherlock hasn’t been gone for long.
“So you’re working yourself to exhaustion to, what, save Mrs Hudson money?” Sherlock asks, his tone suggesting that he thinks John is an idiot.
Sherlock hands John one of the stones, and if their fingers brush for longer than they have to, neither of them mentions it.
“No,” Sherlock all but growls, hating Lestrade a bit for breaking their comfortable bubble. “Lestrade just wants to alert the entire neighbourhood to our presence.”
“Don’t mind if I do.” John takes a sip of the tea with a smile that says he’s buying exactly none of Sherlock’s bollocks. “Just the way I like it. What a coincidence,” he says, smiling into his mug.
“Well, you needn’t worry, because he’s getting married, all right?” Sherlock snaps, even though he knows he’s playing right into Mycroft’s hands by getting emotional. “He’s getting married, so you won’t have to worry about him ruining my career or pulling my focus or anything of the sort, because he’s gone, and he won’t come back, and I can’t even blame him, because I did exactly what you wanted me to. I broke his heart, and now I can’t even make it up to him, because he’s getting fucking married. But as long as I’m one step closer to winning that bloody Tony, who bloody cares.”
Sherlock laughs, and John swings and serves. Again. The pumpkin shatters very satisfyingly.
What? -SH
Sherlock shrugs, and doesn’t tell John everything he deduced about John’s relationship with his sister. Judging from the phone she gifted him with, and the comments she leaves on his blog, she’s a drunk who’s getting a divorce, who loves John and resents him about equally, whose relationship to John is close but contentious, as it would be between addict and sober sibling. He doesn’t tell John how right he is, because he and Mycroft used to be the addict and the sober sibling, and in a way they very much still are.
and he’s one hundred percent sure that whatever else John has to say right now, he doesn’t want to hear it.
“This week’s theme: Tea time! The first challenge is a classic: Victoria Sponge.”
@thesienceofbaking
“What an arsehole!” Sally’s outraged, and the entire table nods along.
“It’s mine.” He hesitates when Mrs Hudson frowns a bit. “My nanny used to make sticky toffee pudding. She was the only one who could cook - or bake for that matter - in my family.”
Mrs Hudson groans. “Please, no scone-skon debate. It never leads anywhere.”
to take it. And I want you to understand that it was
She busies herself smoothing over Sherlock’s bed-cover, straightening his blanket. “Odd to see him this still, isn’t it?”
“Oh, God, yes.” John sighs. “You think we could make some?”
“Sherlock? Do you understand a word I’m saying?” John asks, and Sherlock can feel his face move with the words, can feel the vibrations of John’s voice.
Sherlock stops so abruptly John almost runs into him. He turns around and faces John. “I’m pretty sure we’re not in Devonshire any more.”
Sherlock shrugs, because he is, and he feels slightly guilty about it, but he also knows that John doesn’t really mind.
“I figured,” John says, taking the phone from Sherlock and dropping it carelessly on the floor. He’s clearly lost all interest in the game, and that’s fine by Sherlock.
“I am well aware how many people are dead, but my point remains. Hope was of limited intelligence, therefore a minor pawn, so catching him, while satisfying, doesn’t get us anywhere with regard to Jim,” Sherlock says, tone still academic but slightly impatient now.
John.
No answer.
John darts forward and Sherlock tumbles right into him. John grabs his arms and holds him steady, and for a moment, they stay like this, John holding on to Sherlock’s arms, Sherlock clutching the plate with his scones and the jam in a death grip. John’s hands are strong and steady. He smells good, of sugar and sweat and a hint of his aftershave. There must be a word, he thinks, for the exact shade of blue of John Watson’s eyes. He’s got surprisingly fine lashes. There’s flour on his nose, and a bit of Sherlock’s strawberry jam has gotten on his shirt.
“Why do you think?” Sherlock snaps. “Why do you think I endure this boring, hellish nightmare of a show? Do you know how much time we spend actually baking on this baking show? I did the calculations. It’s less than a third. The challenges are asinine, the judging is entirely random, and the waiting around for the cameras and crew and judges and hosts is excruciating. So why do you think I put myself through this?”
John fists a shaking hand in Sherlock’s lapels and pulls him in, then stops him talking by pressing their lips together. It’s hard and fast and fierce. “I’m not,” he pants against Sherlock, “leaving without you. Ever.”
“This isn’t a game,” John says, holding eye contact with Sherlock but gesturing at the dead body on the slab between them.
“John. It’s Christmas dinner. It’s not a root canal,” Sherlock says, more amused than angry. “Though I see your point. Dental surgery might be preferable.” Sherlock pauses for effect. “Well. Maybe not surgery. But a standard filling, perhaps.”
“The variance of tea preference is so low that the chances of ours overlapping are relatively high. Statistically speaking,” Sherlock observes dryly.
It still bleeds like crazy.
“All right,” Sherlock whispers, and lets John manhandle him into his room, lets him pull off his coat and scarf and shoes, lets John push him on the bed. He grabs at John’s arm, tries to pull him down with him, but John moves out of range, then out of sight, then out of the room.
Sherlock takes a breath and John knows he’s about to interrupt, so he holds up a hand and Sherlock’s mouth snaps closed again, making John snort in amusement. “People like me don’t become doctors, Sherlock. People from North London with dead fathers who can’t afford University don’t become doctors. Especially if the public school they stumbled into out of sheer dumb luck was closed due to the war and they had to spend years billeted somewhere where a proper education wasn’t to be had. Any chance I had went up in smoke during the Blitz.”
“None of that, or we’ll be late,” Sherlock says with a laugh, moving away.
Sherlock thinks and doesn’t say.
“You can never tell, John,” Mrs Hudson answers, still looking at Sherlock’s pale face. “When our ancestors came here, many of the Fey’a weren’t thrilled. Some of them believe that there are too many humans here as it is. Here in the city we live relatively peacefully together, because the Fey’a who moved to the city are the ones with the least problems with humans. But the ones in the Forest, well, many of them don’t care for us at all. I wouldn't put it past some of them to ensure that the Gate was definitely closed.”
To get her to leave him alone, he starts a blog he never writes in. He walks around the city like a ghost.
I’ve missed you so much
“Congratulations on getting your bakery,” John says quietly.
Sherlock admits silently.
Sherlock shrugs again and decides not to answer, because he doesn’t want to lie, but he doesn’t want to talk about John Watson either, who, among other things, definitely qualifies as ‘interesting’.
“Molly?”
Sherlock snorts. "I have no desire to meet new people, Molly. I can barely stand most people I already know."
John.
Sherlock curses inwardly and turns to Mrs Hudson. “What is it, Mrs Hudson?”
“Wow.” Adriana seems genuinely impressed. Irene’s amused, and Seb is glaring at his shoes.
Mike greets him with a good-natured pat on the back. “You’re the first person here who’s managed to talk to him for more than five minutes without punching him in the face. How did you manage?”
“You mean the Fey'a removed the crystal powering the Gate and somebody stole a crystal to re-open it?”
Sherlock suddenly finds himself grinning at his brother, and he feels an old weight he wasn’t even aware of anymore lifted from his shoulders as Mycroft grins back. “Much better.”
John’s lips are on his before the door is even fully closed behind them. He’s peeling Sherlock’s coat off and kissing him with a single-minded intensity that makes Sherlock’s knees weak. John’s lips are cold and his hands are cold, but Sherlock minds neither as he struggles to get John out of as many clothes as quickly as he can.
John opens his mouth to say something, then closes it again when he realises that Sherlock is right. There’s nothing more to say. 221B is home, and that room upstairs is his. It’s where he belongs.
Mrs Hudson sits down at the table and starts eating as well. “It’s amazing how quickly you learned Feyara, Sherlock,” she says, gesturing at the newspaper.
“Sherlock,” the doctor says, turning his head so he’s looking at her out of bleary eyes. “Do you know where you are?”
“Star Baker is wide open this week,” Mrs Turner enthuses into the camera.
John huffs out a laugh, and nods. “Well, that’s most likely true. So I’m not going to worry about it and get myself a cup of tea. See you around.”
Sherlock’s a bit disappointed, but his head is swimming and his eyes won’t focus properly.
“Wow. Didn’t think he even remembered, sometimes, the way he talks on telly.” She sighs, looking at her cigarette, watching the embers eat at it. “‘course it was easier for him. He liked it. I didn’t. But I was expected to help, because I was the girl. He wanted to, and gran doted on him so much because of it. Little Johnny, so helpful, so clever, such a good boy.” There’s bitterness in her voice, but affection, too.
“Shut up and tell me.”
“Mine’s even worse,” Irene says with a self-deprecating grin. “Store-bought sponge, strawberries, jelly. Five minutes to deliciousness. My parents can’t bake for shit, so that was my birthday cake until I was sixteen and made my own.”
The paramedics are reassuringly brisk and professional. They’ve got Mary on a stretcher and are wheeling her out in no time, and John stumbles after them in a trance. There’s a short discussion where it turns out he can’t ride in the ambulance with her, but he can follow in a cab.
By mutual if silent consent, they’ve been walking aimlessly around the city, and now along the river. The enormity of Kitty’s revelations hasn’t even begun to register, and John feels utterly unequipped to deal with any of it.
John huffs a small laugh, and Sherlock smiles smugly. Mission accomplished.
“Well deserved, Sherlock.”
John shifts a little and Sherlock unceremoniously crawls into John’s bed and arranges himself next to John so his entire side is pressed against John’s front and John’s head is resting near Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock shrugs and closes the fridge. “Apparently he thinks it’s giving him an advantage. Stupid, really. It-” Sherlock falls silent as footsteps crunch on the gravel path outside the tent.
Something hurts. Something that is sitting between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.
“Wiggins,” Sherlock says grimly, and they’re off again.
But the part of him that was never good at saying no to just one more hit is stronger, so he gets up and drops to his knees before John’s chair, and kisses him, at the same time as he’s fiddling with the belt of John’s jeans. “One more day won’t make a difference,” Sherlock mutters against John’s lips. “And I’ve got plenty more underwear for you to borrow.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Either that, or time passes more quickly here than on Earth. Both are equally possible or impossible.”
“There were snipers, three of them. They would have killed you,” Sherlock says when what he really means is
Sherlock rolls his eyes as he reads through what must be a thousand words of vitriol directed mostly at the BBC for “turning a baking competition into a badly veiled popularity contest, and allowing contestants to hog the spotlight without any consideration of talent and quality of bakes”.
John looks sceptically at the greenish powder. “Have you tested this?”
Moriarty is next, glaring at Sherlock, openly hostile as usual. Sherlock ignores him and starts unpacking at his workstation.
“It’s bread week, everyone!”
“Around noon.”
I’m not slagging off your gran’s recipe book. It’s quite brilliant. Even though her Sachertorte recipe is extremely questionable.
A like, but not a comment. Just for a tiny moment, Sherlock allows himself to wonder what that might mean. Then he shakes himself out of it.
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s fine.”
It’s just getting light, and John wakes up to empty sheets and violin music. He feels achingly nostalgic for a moment, and then remembers where he is, and the nostalgia melts into a glowing, immediate happiness. The room reeks of sex, and John feels utterly disgusting, but he stretches happily, body thrumming with satisfaction.
“What?” Sherlock asks. He takes an apple from the fridge and almost runs into John, who’s standing behind him with a piece of potato. It’s still hot, the steam rising from the piece. John has put a wedge of butter and a bit of salt on it, and the butter is slowly melting into the potato.
Sherlock snorts into his coffee. "No, they didn't."
He can’t stay on the landing forever. But five minutes more won’t hurt anyone. So he sits down on the steps and closes his eyes and lets the music tug at that space in his chest.
“Nice?” John raises his eyebrows and smirks, leaning in to mutter, “The noises you made sounded a hell of a lot better than nice.”
“Half of the customary four hours have already elapsed, let’s check on progress.”
“Say what you’re thinking,” John says, even more gently. “Unfiltered. Please.”
“The bakes for the show,” Sherlock answers.
“I know,” John mutters, pressing a feather-soft kiss against Sherlock’s brow. "Try not to think about it too much, though. Trick I learned when I was deployed. Try to keep your attention here and now. Makes it easier."
“And was he right?” Irene asks.
“In a minute,” John pants, voice unsteady with desire, eyes dark, hair mussed from Sherlock’s kneading hands.
Gentle hands push him away, settle on his forehead and his chest, stroke down the side of his face, and that’s nice too, that’s wonderful, in fact, and Sherlock rubs his face against these hands, listens to John mutter, “Bloody paramedics take ages.”
“Once more into the breach, then?” John asks, and his tone is both fondly amused and vaguely sad, making Sherlock painfully aware that this is indeed the last time they’re doing this.
“We ran away,” Kitty says, gazing at the floor, lost in the memory. “He… was always touching, teasing, but that night, he got… he got violent. And I… grabbed one of the fire irons…” She trails off, wiping a tear away. Then she visibly steels herself to go on. “We didn’t stay to check whether he was still alive. We just ran into the woods. We took all the money and the ration books we could find and ran.”
look.
Sherlock can’t sleep. He’s only had half a glass of wine, but he feels it sloshing around in his stomach, in his head, his veins. The bed is deeply uncomfortable and he’s thirsty from the alcohol and the over-spiced pizza.
John kills both their assailants.
It’s ridiculously early when Sherlock steps onto the soundstage that will house the Bake Off final.
John gestures at the handprint and Sherlock smiles as well, and John thinks how different Sherlock is from the man John met so many years ago, who would have thought it the height of weakness to be fondly amused and more than a bit sentimental about a two-year-old’s jammy handprint. “Apricot,” Sherlock muses after a few moments of contemplation, and they both grin.
Sherlock lets out a huff of frustration. Six long weeks, and six weeks of rehearsals before that, and he still hasn’t gotten John Watson to kiss him. He hasn’t been subtle about his interest, either, but John just hasn’t caught on yet.
But somehow what he sees is worse.
They step into the shade of the trees. There’s a well-worn path winding through the forest. They follow it.
On Friday, he packs for the competition with no doubt in his mind that he’s going to win, it’s just a question of getting through the days without crawling out of his skin with boredom.
“You’re both right,” Irene says, getting up. “And speaking of food that makes us feel good: Who wants chocolate?”
but he doesn’t articulate the thought. “No.”
Sherlock hesitates. He wants… well, he wants everything. He wants John to take him apart with his hands and then fuck him until he can’t walk anymore, and he wants John on his hands and knees and begging, and he wants everything in between. Right now, though, he wants John to stay where he is, right on top of Sherlock and grinning down at him, eating him up with his eyes. He wants more kissing, more skin, more heat, more friction.

John swallows hard and unconsciously licks his lips, and Sherlock’s eyes dart to his lips, almost imperceptibly. Then something in his eyes changes, fades, and Sherlock closes the dishwasher with an audible click and nods at the door. “I should go.”
“Why are you tattooing a dead pig?” John asks.
What scares Sherlock is that he’s starting to get used to it. That he’s starting to need it. That he’s starting to rely on it, and that’s just never a good idea.
“What a season it has been. Amazing bakes, not so amazing bakes, drama, tension, maybe even a bit of romance, if you listen to some of the rumours flying around, which we don’t of course.”

Frowning in confusion, Sherlock puts a hand into his coat pocket and pulls out the ancient lodestone he 'borrowed' from Mr. Musgrave's collection. The stone is black and roughly arrow-shaped, and it's vibrating ever so slightly.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Moriarty greets him. He smiles at Sherlock with his lips only, the rest of his face oddly and disconcertingly unaffected by the gesture. “Jim Moriarty. Hi.”
“Hey, you started it.”
"We need to renegotiate several passages," Janine continues, ignoring his pointed silence, and takes a long sip of her coffee. She sighs in pleasure and grins. "Bad pastries, good coffee."
Sherlock sweeps a short gaze over John’s workstation. “Linzer cake.”
John describes the recipe in some detail, and he includes a lot of pictures he obviously didn’t take himself, because he’s in a lot of them.
John flashes him a quick, humourless smile, then continues in a quiet, thoughtful voice, “So did I. But I went anyway. And all the while I was waiting for you to burst through the doors and laugh at us because we fell for your charade. And afterwards, I just kept waiting for you to come for me. I used to compulsively check my phone and my emails for a message from you. ‘In Baghdad. Come if convenient. If inconvenient, come anyway. SH.’” John indicates the quotes with his fingers. “But there was nothing. Total silence. So I started to accept it. And now here you are. And I keep wondering, more than anything, why you didn’t come for me.”
“Yes.” Sherlock gestures at his chemical equipment. “A plant-based poison similar to belladonna. Easy to obtain.”
“Come with us,” their leader, a Fey'a man with a crossbow pointed at them, says in heavily accented English.
John nods gratefully. “Absolutely. Seven at Market Square?”
“Fine, we’ll leave you to it.”
And for a split second, John thinks of that day with relief. Because then it will finally be over, and he won’t have to watch her self-destruct anymore.
Moriarty gives him a raised eyebrow and lets his eyes drop to John’s hand on Sherlock’s sleeve, his smirk taking on a condescending edge, but Sherlock doesn’t have it in him to care, so he lets John pull him along, relegating Moriarty to insignificance again.

Billy pauses for a moment. “And…” he says, prompting John to continue.
Sherlock feels the sudden, unexpected urge to say something funny, to get John’s attention back, to make him smile like that at him. “Could be worse,” he says, and John’s eyes snap to him. “Imagine if any of them actually knew they were talking about gay sex on national television.”
“Our showstopper challenge today has the motto “Roll me Up”.”
to go home,” Sherlock bites back. “Easy to see why, really, nobody's waiting for
Next to him, John whistles. “Nice one. Let me try.”
Sherlock sighs. “Me too.”
“I had a nightmare,” Sherlock says, quietly, almost inaudibly.
“Don’t be ridiculous!” Sherlock shouts, far too loudly for the smallness of the car. “I’m finishing this alone. I’m not getting you killed. I never should have allowed you to come along. This ends now. You’re going back to London and you-”
“All right,” John says, “but after dinner.”
“No, they’re not,” John says, getting up from the tree stump he’s sitting on. “Come on, let’s try to go back to the city. I’m freezing.”
For maybe the very first time in his life, Sherlock would like nothing more than to go back to sleep. But he can’t. Images from his journey into his mind palace flit around behind his eyelids every time he closes his eyes. John kissing him, John yelling at him, John leaving, leaving, leaving.
“Biscuit doughs, pie crust for the mince pies and the savoury, then while they’re resting I’m making the Christmas pudding, then the ice cream for the dessert, then on to the savoury pie.” John grins at her, hands already covered in flour.
“Seems complex, are you sure you can pull this off?”
Sherlock finishes applying the ointment but doesn't let go of John's under-shirt, studying the bruises with the intense attention he usually reserves for unsolvable puzzles - and occasionally John Watson. John feels slightly dizzy and strangely hot, like the temperature in the room has suddenly risen significantly.
John just grunts. He’s numb with exhaustion, he’s cold, hungry and his feet hurt. All he wants now is a hot meal and bed, and they can figure out the rest tomorrow.
He feels slightly ridiculous as he unpacks his ancient suitcase and his hand-me-down clothes and puts them into the beautiful, antique wardrobe. He pulls on his pyjamas and his father’s old jumper. It’s ridiculous, and he’s far too old for it, but it comforts him, and for the first time in a long time, he doesn’t have to feel guilty about acknowledging that he misses his dad. He also fastens the chain with his dad’s pocket watch around his neck. It’s uncomfortable, but this way he won’t leave it behind in case he needs to get out of the house quickly if there’s an air raid. He’s learned the hard way that things you don’t carry with you have a tendency to go up in smoke.
Sherlock bends to pick up another stone and lets his fingers carefully drift over several candidates. Too light. Too heavy. Too thick. Just right. He gets up and flings the stone at the water. Eight. “There’s a lot of wind tonight,” he observes, even though not a leaf is stirring.
“Obviously.”
At the flap, Sherlock kneels down and opens it a tiny bit, peeking into the tent.
“And he told Sherlock, and Sherlock went off to investigate?” John guesses, though, really, it’s not a guess.
