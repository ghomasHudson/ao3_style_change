she'd gotten the House. I smelled her cunt the moment I stepped outside." he said widening his eyes. "She was finger fucking herself under one of the trees you see, no doubt trying to pluck up the nerve to come
“Brother.” He began. “Why didn’t the God punish the Queen? It was a godless thing she did with that Lordling. That Warlord was only acting as any woman would have in her place. And her entire bloodline was destroyed for it. Not to mention the Lordling who died by his own hand. And betrayed our Father. And you tell me our Mother showed no remorse? Paid no price?”
you......” he drifted off. “......you are going to my ticket out of this wretched valley, and on to life of wealth beyond imagining.”
The outer gown was a gorgeous confection of heavy golden brocade that trailed a full four feet on the ground behind him as he walked. Maneuvering it over his shoulders like a vest, Castiel stood like a human mannequin while they pulled and tucked and laced until he was deemed ready. The final effect was truly something to behold. Castiel thought he looked older and altogether otherwordly. And it was strange seeing his body in these clothes. His legs looked very long in the boots that stretched up over his knees, shown off perfectly by the divided skirts of the gown. His waist looked impossibly small hovering between the voluminous sleeves. He turned this way and that, admiring the way…..
"Joh that's a sweet gesture." Castiel said. "But she'll never let you go to perform such a menial task."
“Light see you Joh.” Castiel said amicably, noticing her gaze drifting over him a few times as she took in the sight of him.
“S’true. I tell ya. There’s nothin’ like a Royal seal and a few war stories told over th’bar to get…..”
“If you thought they would get to me faster than I can kill you, you would have done so already.” She said with a cackle.
as he had available streaming into his tattoos. The air of the cave like room was split for a second by an impact like soundless lightning as force erupted from him in all directions. Castiel felt his tattoos light up, then a moment later his skin began to sizzle as his bandages caught fire.
Dee-Ann nods. Carefully he adds another finger and Castiel’s eyes roll back, closing as they do. Calmer now, relaxed and more confident, Dee-Ann starts letting himself explore inside of him. Castiel feels his fingers spreading a bit, curling slightly as they pull in and out of him. His next breath catches on a whimper and Dee-Ann’s other hand strokes calmly over his cock. Soft, rhythmic. The look on Dee-Ann’s face is one of absolute fascination, eyes darting to Castiel’s ever so often; then returning in earnest to his task. Dee-Ann pushes a little deeper. One perfect twist of his hand and lightning strikes Castiel’s spine. Shoots through his stomach and his eyes fly open.
He blinked twice when he heard Chaala’s footsteps approaching. He quieted his breath, removing his hand from his cock. This was the moment. The God would guide him.
He could not stop it. A simpering, shuddering sob slipped from his chest; drawing both Maeghara and Derubeis' attention. Maeghara sighed.
She shook her head as though she were pained with disappointment. "You are a SLAVE Dee-Ann. I bought you with my silver coin. You were there! You saw your mother sell you to me? You are not a child of my blood! You are my property!"
He didn't understand. Maeghara read his mind like always. "We have been on the road for many Godmoons Dee-Ann. We have much business that needs tending. We are in the city now. We must live city lives. My time is now for Trader Business. That is
“I want to know why you can’t look at me? You act as if my touch burns you. You’re never alone with me for more than a few spent breaths. And I want to know why!” Castiel said. Dee-Ann huffed like a horse, bumping his shoulder into Castiel as he walked by. Castiel whirled fast.
He paused to blink a stinging out of his eyes, swallowing back a lump which had sprung up in his throat. “Your life is your own. And you deserve to live it. As long as you’re next to me……that won’t happen.”
“There you are! Do you have any idea what time it is? I’ve been going insane thinking you were caught! Did you find them? Where’ve you been? I haven’t been able to think of anything else? What happened? Did anyone see you?” Tran asked, beginning to help Castiel undress automatically. For his part, Castiel let his arms be lifted, stepping out of his borrowed trousers when instructed; not bothering to respond as Tran continued to chatter away. He could tell Tran had been truly concerned – as much for himself as for Castiel. Back in his own dressing gown, Castiel wrapped himself in his favorite shawl all but collapsed on the nearest chair. The unique combination of excitement, terror and exertion of his night was catching up to him; and he was finding it difficult to keep his eyes open now that he was safe.
The opportunity came a scant few weeks ago. Castiel had ordered a special meal to be prepared for him and sent up to his rooms before dismissing his retinue for the night. Tran had appeared with the salvers and arranged them on the low table in front of the fire with some disdain. It was quite evident that this meal was meant for two. And if he was trying to his displeasure at the prospect of Castiel taking a lover; he was failing.
“Now we must somehow untangle that rats nest you call hair! Aaaiiiieeeee! Let us hope Maghara and Derubeis are in a haggling mood today. Or you’ll never be godbraided before they finished their business.” The man Bisla said, helping him out of the hole on his wobbly legs. His brothers wrapped him in a large soft cloth and pressed the water from his hair with more cloths. After that, all three men sat him on the floor. They seated themselves around him and began to tease at his damp hair. It
looking anywhere by at the fabric as he guided it down. Dee-Ann had already shucked his boots earlier, so all that was left for him to join Castiel in his nakedness was to divest his socks.
“You never came to the fire. I saw you walk by earlier, I thought you might –” the girl Chaala said turning.
Having slept only a little, he was more than reluctant to wake already. His body felt sluggish and he tasted something awful and brackish in his mouth. With a shudder, he realized it was the remnants of Castiel’s seed. The memory of smiling around Castiel’s cock as he convulsed and spent his seed onto Dee-Ann’s more than willing tongue flashed through his mind. Only this time it did not twitch his cock.
It was curious that – as a Body Servant – Tran could leave the Palace but Castiel – a Prince of the Blood – could not.
Slowly the Huge Square structure of the Keep came into view across several courtyards. It was strange seeing the Palace so alive with activity. More Guards than he was used to could be seen patrolling the paths, and everywhere he looked all manner of slaves and Servants were rushing about. Here and there he could even see a few Godspeakers barking orders or walking quickly. It was obvious that something was
“Get off me.” Castiel said harshly, shaking his wrists free. “If that is how you feel, and it’s distressing you so….everything I said last night is still true.” He continued, taking two steps and turning to look over his shoulder at Dee-Ann. “If you want to go?
Maeghara stood wearing a deep frown. "Am I to care what Slaves like and dislike?  Am I not MASTER in this villa?"
His supply of water however, would not last as long as the food. Women died fast without water. He had seen it in the savage East. He would not die like that. He would leave his safe place sometime between newsun and lowsun and refill his flask. It would be safe to do that. The God would keep him hidden.
“I am here God. But I cannot reach you until the snow is melted. I beg you. Send us a way to get through this mountain pass and reach Et-Novakar.”
“What the--” he began outraged but was silent when she reached into her robes with a wicked expression.
“The official story…” he continued, though from the way he said it Castiel could tell just how official he believed it to be. “…was that he was visiting Godhouses all across Mijak to bless the Godstones and spread the Light.”
“Pathetic.” He sneered. “Only the old Crossroad bitch ever suspected anything. I should’ve killed her years ago. Instead I waited for the perfect moment and she managed to trap me on this fucking
The introduction of a certain green eyed character we all know and lust. Not yet though. Ew. He's like......twelve. Ha ha!
Castiel found himself staring at them, and forced his eyes back to a particularly handsome women at the front of the procession, who stepped forward to speak.
“A thousand apologies my Lord, but the Blue one’s hem was torn. It is yet to be mended.” The salve said.
“Bah! The South? You don’t even think that boy!” she said pulling the beads tighter, and he felt several places where the blades kissed his skin.
The look on Derubeis face told Dee-Ann that was a lot of money. To him it sounded like a lot. But Maeghara looked undismayed, counting out the coins and dropping them into the woman’s hand.
“Does this make you happy?” Dee-Ann asked and Castiel – opening his eyes lazily – looked into Dee-Ann’s beautiful beautiful face. There was something thrilling in seeing his green eyes. Very little of the green was visible around the blown out blackness of his pupils, the effect making him look wild and untamed. Like a caged animal. The idea that it was
“The dreams again?” Tran asked seriously, his dark eyes looking concerned. He was the only person in the Palace Castiel trusted enough to have told about his nightmares. Castiel considered brushing off the question with a lie. But it was weighing on him.
Getting off from the wagon, Dee-Ann walked next to Maeghara, reaching for her hand and smiling when she let him take it. Derubeis – still sniveling – joined them next to the wagon a moment later. They walked right up to the Gates of the city.
He’d dressed himself to show his station as one of the Palace Godspeakers, and Castiel wondered who this Truthsayer was that he should so direly wish to impress her.
She even told him about Cowan boys. Dee-Ann listened with rapt attention. He wondered if he had ever met one. For the first time in a long time, he was reminded of how much of this world he did not understand. He did not want to appear foolish in front of the girl Chaala, but he knew he would have much to think about when he was alone.
At the end of some streets stood a Godpost with a Godbowl at its base. Dee-Ann saw a Godspeaker dressed in brown linen and snakeskin empty the offerings from one of the Godbowls into a leather satchel slung over her shoulder. She was very young, her brow bound with a tiny scorpion shell. The slave Ashar bound his head when they passed her, so did Dee-Ann; after Ashar poked him with his elbow.
He felt too hot. Too sensitive. Too everything. Abruptly, he stepped away, prying Tran’s hands off him.
“Gabriel, Desdemonius, Alcan-tur Novakar……I forbid you from using my brush with death as fodder for one of your base little productions.” Castiel was quick to say.
Supple as a snake, she rose to her feet, her god braids swishing over her shoulder as she turned. “Good. Obid?” she said, crossed her arms as Obid rose to meet her.
Castiel learns a touch more about his history than he ever wantrd to know. And an internal suspicion threatens to consume him.
There was no time to ask for a pot of his own. Hot trickles were running down the length of his cock. So he moved away from the tent, hiked up the yellow robe Maeghara had given him and let his own water flow. Obid saw him, shoving the pot she carried to another guard and loping towards him with arms outstretched and teeth bared. He staggered backward, fingers clawed as he fell over his own feet and collapsed to the ground, scrambling backwards like a lizard.
"Yes I am precious!" Dee-Ann said desperately. "I am Dee-Ann. I read. I write. I dance. I wear silk and linen. I am taught by a paid tutor. Your slaves are not taught! "
“We?” Castiel whispered. Then the mask slipped back into place. “Alright. But know this. If you’re staying, I need you to understand all of what that means. I will not live with the sword of your God hanging over my head every step of the way. And I have no intention to go the rest of the way to Et-Haravelle as
The hairless slave put down the items the man Bisla had ordered her to bring, and watched as the other slaves emptied their leather buckets into the hole. They left and returned many times, until the hole was filled almost to the top. They placed four full wooden buckets to one side and withdrew. The man Bisla placed a large cloth beside the hole, and on it placed a brush, a comb and a pale pink jar along with a pile of smaller cloths. He took off its lid. Inside was something soft and slippery, smelling like flowers. Amazed, Dee-Ann stared at the hole full of water. He was ye even more amazed when the man Bisla stripped off his clothes and walked down into it. The water reached up to his waist. Bisla reached out his hand.
Dee-Ann frowned. He had not told the man of Castiel’s powers, only that his lamp-oil soaked bonds had caught fire and burned him. It was not needful for some Village Herb man to know such things.
“Shush doggy.” He said stalking over to Castiel. Castiel looked up at him defiantly. To his surprise, Gord-Ahn chuckled, actually throwing his head back and laughing. “
“I do so love sugar dates. One hardly ever sees them this time of year.” Tran continued smoothly as if Castiel hadn’t spoken at all. Another one of his annoying habits. Clearly Tran was not feeling generous this morning.
“Oh he’s in the garden, observing his daily vigil.” El-Don said pointing out the window with his chin. “He’ll wear his knees out praying for so long without moving.”
It was quite lovely in its own austere way. It was bright blue, a squat little pot on two legs with a small metal knocker fitted to the lid, which had been sealed shut with a thick strip of wax baked hard along with the rest of the pot. With a small sigh, he lifted the knocker and rapped it sharply on The Queen's seal, shattering the little pot to pieces.
Directly into the stone cold glare of his Mother the Queen, staring unblinking at him from her throne with a look that could only be described as murderous.
So yeah. Benny was the familiar face I was hinting at earlier. I noticed re-reading this that there's a hint of chemistry between Dean and Benny. This is unintentional for this story. But waaaaaaaaaay back in the deep dark days of a week ago when I first thought of this, the character that is now Benny was going to be Castiel; and this would've been the first time we met him.
“Granted.” Said the Godspeaker nodding. “Go to the Godpost wayhouse when you are ready to travel. You must wait there until the next Godspeaker caravan departs.”
Tucked beneath his blankets, he held his beautiful blue snake eye amulet, and waited for sleep to claim him. He was not afraid of squabbling Warlords, or of Demons, or of stupid goat Derubeis. Maeghara was here. She would protect him. Maeghara and the God.
“Like what?” Castiel asked, setting down the forkful of meat he was eating. It had turned to ash in his mouth.
“And you all.” Castiel said crossing the room and continuing into the Bathing Chamber beyond, grateful to close the doors behind him. His favorite body servant Tran was already in there, pouring scented oil into the huge raised pool, whispering sacred incantations to heat the water. Steam from the Boilers in the subterranean parts of the Palace – completely forbidden and unknowable to Castiel – heated the water. But Castiel liked his baths scolding. And he knew Tran could use all the practice he could get if he wanted to be ready for his Godspeaker trials come the spring.
spared. But his hair would not be so lucky. Under the premise of speed, he urged the Body Slave who dressed it to opt for something simpler; wincing as it was pulled tight from his face and woven into a tight knot at the back of his head; leaving the rest of his hair to fall heavily down his back. He dressed as quickly as possible, letting Tran lace him into the leather bodice and settling the long cape like sleeves so they fell properly over the leather gauntlets that covered him from wrist to elbow. He waved away the slave who brought jewelry. He wanted nothing but his small Godstone. His entire ensemble was dark leather, all deep browns on the harness and oxblood trousers; save for the sleeves and divided skirts which were flaming scarlet as they fell about his legs and trailed batlike behind him as he swept out of his chambers into the Morning Room where the Godspeaker was waiting.
An endless afternoon spent selecting a flavor for his cake; and selecting a few delicacies from the Provinces had yielded which of the Noble Houses controlled Et-Novakar’s supply of grain. Not to mention which districts, fiefdoms and provinces were the most strategically important in terms of trade routes and foreign relations. Three full days had been lost to trying on the various costumes and ceremonial attire Castiel would have to wear and determining what alterations needed to be made. Castiel had been sure at the end of it his skin turn a ruddy brown color and he’d go bald amidst all the dyes and fabrics and beads and feathers and jewels. But he’d managed to glean which cities were the most important Ports for shipping. Which areas held the most fertile soil and where the most important mines were.
Hello my lovelies! I'm so sorry for the long delay since last time. My man had a little stretch of leave so we got outta the city for a bit amidst all this Covid nonsense. Hope you guys enjoy. I'm sorry if it feels like these traveling chapters aren't really moving the plot forward. I wear there is method to the madness. Ciao for now!
“Go on then tell me.” He sighed. “I believe when last we saw Isaorah he was in the Hareem of the Evil Warlord?”
“Breathe God.” Said the Godspeaker Tulu in a voice like distant thunder. A moment later, the markings inked into her skin began to glow with a the same blue-green light Dee-Ann had seen flare from the stone when the slave lay dying upon it. The glow crawled up the Godspeaker’s arm, painting all her tattoos with the same glow, until it settled in her eyes – stretched wide – and looking without seeing in her head. Her body rippled snakelike and Dee-Ann thought she was about to bring up her food. But when she opened her mouth, the same light shone from within her.
“Richese War band.” She all but spat. “Passed through our hamlet looking for grain and ale. There weren’t no one left who knew how to stop em taking whatever they wanted. Nothing but men and children left to keep the home fires burnin. Every able bodied woman was off fightin Elspeth’s war. She’d disgraced herself on a young Warlord’s husband. Called her banners she did.”
Her eyes widened, and her cheeks went bloodless. But she nodded slowly. “I swear. On my lifeblood I swear to you. I will not harm you.” She whispered, her eyes darting between the tip of the blade and his eyes. “Now please……” she urged.
“It’s vile. Just keeping them watered and fed is making my hair go prematurely gray I tell you. And don’t get me started on security. I’ve had to liaise with the Nerissa’s honor guard. And let me tell you, if you thought her head was swollen with power after that campaign she led in the Peregrine Reach; you were dead wrong. I…..” Gabriel continued, but Castiel wasn’t listening anymore.
“I told you Rubi. Not stupid!” she chuckled. Bending, she patted his cheek again. “For sleeping Dee-ann. It will not harm you. Drink.”
“Oh I know! I’ll go to hell for it of course….But it’ll be nothing compared to the hell they’re have planned for you.” He said stepping forward and looking as if he might falter. Castiel put out his hand and Tran caught it, gripping onto it like a drowning man. His expression turned desperate for a moment, as if he might give himself over to tears. But he seemed to take hold of himself.
Dee-Ann walked into the girl Chaala’s tent. She was not there. But there were several candles lit around the traveling trunk he had seen her use as a desk, so he knew she had probably been called to eat, and would be back soon. Steadying himself with a quick breath he toed off his shoes then removed his tunic and undid the knot of the cord that held his pantaloons around his body. He untied the sash from around his waist. He had tied it around his godbraids the night he had left Maeghara’s villa. Now he used it to secure his food sack under his clothes, tight to his body where no woman could take it from him. Instead of bread and cheese, his food sack now held the amulets and silver bells that had once sang in his godbraided hair, the jewels from his ears and the rings he had worn around his toes, his empty water flask, and the knife he’d stolen from Maeghara’s kitchens. It was everything he owned in this world.
“Good.” She said nodding. She waved the flies away, then pulled from her gold and purple pocket a tiny pottery jar. When she took off its lid, he smelled the ointment inside. Thick and rich and strange. Startling him, she dropped to one knee, and smeared his burning legs with the jars fragrant paste. Her fingers were cool and sure against his sun seared skin. The pain vanished, and he was shocked. He hadn’t known a woman could touch a he-brat and not hurt it. It made him wonder what else he did not know?
.” Castiel looked down at himself despite his clothes. Gord-Ahn’s eyes glittered with wicked amusement. “It would’ve taken a simple cloth merchant from Et-Taklikar a lifetime to earn even
“Our villa’s Chief Slave. You will mind him Dee-Ann. For his word is my word.” She said looking down at him. “If you disobey him, Rubi will have her wish and see you beaten.”
"The Harrowspex true powers lie elsewhere Cassie. Just....trust me. I've seen her do it. She can read your future. And sometimes she can help you change it." Gabriel said earnestly. As if on cue, Misoorayah pulled a piglet carcass from the bucket. it was missing its head and feet, but as she pushed her fingers into the neck cavity, she withdrew a handful of foul smelling organs and guts.
Dee-Ann woke early, as had become his custom. He removed the girl Chaala’s arm from around his waist where she lay curled up next to him, and washed himself in a basin of cold water. After they had agreed to play out the farce that they were fucking, Chaala had insisted that he sleep in her bed. It had been awkward at first, but they soon grew used to it. Their deception had come to include other things. Dee-Ann had grown used to the stares and taunts from other women in the camp as the girl Chaala had taken to boasting of their nighttime pleasures. Several times he had heard them making smirking jabs at her, saying things like:
“And my brain is upside down.” Said Derubeis sour as goat milk. “What a chance to get rid of the brat Mega! Aaaaaiiiiieeeeeee! The God see me in its Eye. The foolish things I do for you.”
The envoys themselves entered next, and they were equally appealing and strange. Walking in pairs their skins were almond brown, and what was visible of their hair was jet black and shining. Their clothing too was strange.
Dee-Ann gripped his face firmly in both hands and dragged their mouths back together again, and all thought left Castiel’s mind…
He looked up at the night sky, where the Godmoon walked with her obedient husband. Four fingers until newsun. That was time enough to reach the wall. Chilly in the Quiet Time, under the God’s severe protection, he headed for the Pinnacle. It was the most central point of the city, and would help him navigate streets he knew from pictures and words, but had ever seen in person.
Behind the stage area, a small army of smaller rooms had been constructed out of free standing screens and intricate room dividers Castiel recognized from when the Palace had been refurbished a few years before. Gabriel led him to a small room at the far end of the “theater”. In the days when this had been a ballroom, it would have acted as a repository for shawls and cloaks and exterior garments. Instead Gabriel had turned it into a neat little bolt hole. Castiel’s first thought was that if Gabriel’s head exploded, this would be the result.
would ride in a carriage like that. Proudly, with Maeghara so that all Et-Banotaj would know he was precious.
Crouched in the shadows beneath the table, the child with no name listened to the Woman and the Man fight.
“Dee-Ann” he said, his tongue stumbling over the strange word, and the strange sing songy way she spoke. “Me name Dee-Ann.”
The Mima saw him looking. “Is something wrong?” he asked. His higher status among the slaves permitted him to be more informal than the others.
. Splitting the light into a thousand thousand colors that flitted and swirled around the enormous room, it is said that the first time this miracle was witnessed, all those in attendance stared until they were blinded by tears. And High Godspeaker Rodmilla had fallen dead right beneath the giant glass sculpture; her soul called home to the Light.
Dee-Ann nodded at the chafed places on his wrists and ankles. “You wear chains not clothes. You run behind camel. Your name far behind you.”
through you as if you are invisible.” He said with a quavering tone. “To watch your life growing small in front of your eyes. A little smaller every day. Until you don’t even see the bars of your cage anymore…..” he continued, his voice trembling.
“And what if some nobleman were to go prematurely blabbing that you have already been betrothed to House Sha-tan to his wife?” Gabriel asked. “Who then sends a raven to the other warlords, who have all sent extravagant gifts and tributes to curry favor? You know how fragile women’s egos are my dove. Wars have been started for less.”
The Reverend Mother smirked. “He is a cautious one Kufu.” She said in a voice that reminded Castiel of a blade on a wetstone. Her words were tinged with the remnants of an accent, but Castiel did not know from where.
“I’m sorry Gabriel. Truly. I did not endeavor purposely to miss our luncheon. My mind has just been…..I’m sorry.” he said, deciding not to reach for an excuse and instead just admit that he’d been thoughtless and wrong. He held up his hand and Tran handed him his own glass of wine. Castiel waggled his eyebrow when he saw Tran had poured himself one as well.
He hadn’t told Gabriel about what had happened when their hands had touched. And he found he didn’t want to. There was something…..precious about it. Precious and beautiful. He didn’t want to sully it with anything so small as words. But he wanted to cherish the memory. Wrap his arms around it and hold it close to his heart.
“His lot are meant to stay within the cordon of the caravans. He is trespassing. I done caught him endangering the life of a Prince I have. Caught him red handed!” Tessa said.
So the Caravan continued. But he did not walk. He ran. He danced. He darted ahead, then back to Maeghara. Sometimes with flowers to give him. Other times just a smile. He felt like a snake that had shed its skin. All scaled and wrinkled. Tattered and torn. Dee-Ann was the new snake with cotton clothes and shoes on his feet. And charms woven through his godbraided hair. Yes, he was a beautiful snake!
“Wait!” Castiel said trying to – impossibly – speak loud enough for Dee-Ann to hear him but also to keep his voice down.
He smiled up at her. Johdilia had never been anyone’s idea of a beauty. She was tall even for a woman which leant her body a certain gangliness no amount of muscle would ever obscure. Her nose had been broken at least twice, and too much time exposed to the elements had added a permanent blush and coarseness to her skin. But she had a nice smile, kind eyes and her plain, open features were etched with her good humor. Her straw colored godbraids – shaved on the sides of her head in the fashion of Archers – had been tied in a club at the base of her neck. Castiel chuckled. Johdilia had never taken to wearing her hair long, and would frequently slice them off with her sword and burn them as an offering.
“When she’s not warring with other nations, she slakes her despicable lust for tears and…even blood on her husbands. She has had seven. All young and healthy. One was only fourteen. None of them have managed to give her an heir. And what she did to them before they were allowed to die? It’s unspeakable. They are a people without honor. And they certainly don’t dwell in the light.”
Don't be mad at me!!!!!! I know we've gotten to know them very well, but remember these two don't actually know each other very well at all. So there's bound to be some friction from time to time. But you know what they say about friction........:D
The woman Bara-bhur had tried several times to make jokes with Dee-Ann about fucking with the girl Chaala, and all the women would laugh and chime in. He said nothing. He was not sure what would happen if he told her the truth. He didn’t even know what the truth was. The girl seemed never to run out of excuses not to be alone with him. And when they were she would always make an excuse to walk away. Finally, he made up his mind to take care of the thing himself.
? I wouldn’t be surprised if Li-Illitur has sent me a row of dead sparrow heads to wear around my neck.” Castiel said wryly.
“Messy as ever I’m afraid.” She said with a smirk that betrayed nothing. “Not like home.” She added, looking out the window almost wistfully. Castiel smiled. It was a curious thing to imagine,
. He was clean! He would never be dirty again! He lived in Maeghara’s villa! It was beautiful. And so was he.
"Half right perhaps. And we shall have to see about the rest." Derubeis answered. "But Mega? Now a tutor as well, and so many clothes. The cost of this investment of yours continues to build. Investments can go sour if they are not completed in their time."
The child crawled out of the shadows and shrugged. The man was always sorry. But sorrow changed nothing, so what did it matter?
He’s still shuddering, lost in the bliss of sheer sensation when Dee-Ann tenses and grunts. And feeling the break in the rhythm of his thrusts, his hips stuttering; Castiel realizes Dee-Ann is
"Offerings swell the Godbowl.  The scorpion stings the woman with...with..." It was no good. He hadn't been reading for so very long. They were too many new words symbols. He couldn't guess the rest.
Hello my lovelies! Sorry for not updating the last two days! Just had a LOT going on. But all's well and all that. This is just a quick little sojourn back into Dee-Ann's POV since I felt like it was a crime how long we haven't checked in with him. There is much more to come, but I thought this would be a good little palette cleanser to switch back after so long being in Castiel's head. Mwah! Hope you guys enjoy!
I am so sorry for the hiatus. But I am back and very excited to get back into this. This is just a little fluffy handshake to say hello and how are ya. I will be updating with a proper chapter soon. I'm going to be sticking with Castiel's POV for just a little bit. But not to worry, we'll be back in Dee-Ann's head soon.
“You don’t like my little garden?” Gord-Ahn asked sweetly affronted, as if Castiel had said the color of his gown didn’t become him. “I think it adds a little element of danger to these soft, fat little lands full of its soft, fat little people.” He continued, his eyes darting around the room as if he could see other people there.
He jutted his chin out defiantly, squaring his shoulders as much as the bindings allowed and flattened his lips into a contemptuous sneer. “So. You know.” He said affecting a bored tone. “I suppose you think that makes you clever.”
"She is a Warlord without a husband." The Queen said. "Your marriage will assure our alliance for all generations to come. My bloodline will intertwine with hers. The Light and the Morningstar will burn bright together."
Castiel stood in horror. It was probably the most awful thing he could imagine. What a horrible life. He sighed, turning away from the poor boy.
He rummaged through the wooden trunk that contained his bazaar clothes. He selected a tunic striped in red and gold.  And pantaloons of soft yellow. He pulled off the white cotton shoes he was wearing and instead reached for his curly toed slippers.
On the other side of the pen, Dee-Ann heard a scuffle. Still chewing, he went to see. One of the slaves had dropped its bowl. Its bread and cheese and corn were in the dirt. Other slaves were stealing them. They would not steal from a bowl. Such slaves would be beaten. But food in the dirt, belonged to whoever took it. The slave who had dropped its bowl screamed, but the others did not retreat. Too soon there was nothing left to be stolen, and the hungry slave sat in a pitiful heap; its eye water mixing with the dirt of the pen.
For the first time in years, Dee-Ann felt again like the nameless he-brat under the kitchen table. He wanted to shout. He wanted to form his hands into claws and slice her flesh. He wanted to hurt her. Kill her. Like he had wanted to kill the Woman. But this was no different. Maeghara was strong. He was weak. Nothing had changed. Maeghara was no different from the Woman.
Already the event had not been without its’ excitements. There had been some fanfare surrounding his entrance…
“An animal when trapped will chew through its own leg to escape and save itself.” She said her voice hissing like snake scales. “But a human would lay in wait and kill the trapper to save his kind. Which one are you?”
“Ah.....dear Wylah.” Gord-Ahn said. “Dear, dear, poor sweet, simpering addlebrained Wylah...” he released a throaty chuckle. “She ventured far into the outer rim. By then I’d scraped my way from the pleasure houses to the Opium dens. I knew the moment I saw her that she was my ticket.” Another chuckle. “...oh yes. Her mind was so easy to bend to my will. A few drops of tincture in her drink, a few nights fucking her bow legged, and a few whispered words on the pillow? And she was
“There are rumors from Godhouses across the Queendom. The Oracles and Auguries are….in a state of great unrest. They are concerned about a nexus…” the voice said, speaking in a full whisper now. “A confluence of events. An intersection of countless delicate decisions beyond which….they cannot see.”
Dee-Ann bristled. This slave did not own him. He was not his dog to be called and commanded. He stayed sitting at the table.
Wincing, breath catching raw in his throat, the man clutched at the table leg and pulled himself to his knees. Then grabbed hold of the table edge panting, whimpering, and staggered upright. There was water in his eyes. He reached out a work knotted hand and touched rough fingertips to the child’s cheek. The water trembled but did not fall. Then the man turned on his heel, and went out into the searing day. Not understanding. Not caring. The child with no name followed.
“But as a slave.” Tran asked desperately. “As property. To be beaten and ordered around and fucked at the mercy of others? To see any hope or dreams of a better life vanish into a red braid? Think of what you are saying. You have no idea what it is like to be a slave in this world. It is true, his life is going to be hard. You saw to that. But at least free he has a chance. He could marry. He could have children…..” Tran broke off, closing his eyes for a moment. “Your way would see his entire family vanish from this world. As if he’d never existed at all.”
The Et-Haravelle Godspeaker sprinkled his circle of sacred sand. It was crimson. The color of golden cockerel blood and sparkled strangely on the stony ground. At the circle’s completion, the sand burst into life; leaping black tongues of night cold flame.
“Then the God…can tell me itself.” Dee-Ann said turning and walking back to the Cook’s tent. He did not look back. But he could feel the woman’s hungry eyes following him as he went.
“You knew? That we would be here? Did your dreams–?” he began but Castiel interrupted him before they were diverted too thoroughly.
"I dare not guess. Several of my Sister Reverend Mothers throughout Mijak felt it as well. They remarked on the timing." The Reverend Mother said.
“Be still Dee-Ann! You also Rubi!” Maeghara roared. The scorpion in her cheek was sleeping now. Her fingers plucked up the Godbones one by one and slipped them into their snakeskin pouch. When it was full she closed her eyes and pressed it to her lips. Derubeis released him, and he sat on the cold ground as Maeghara gave thanks to the God for its teachings in the bones. He had no fear of a beating. Derubeis told Maeghara all the time she should beat him. And she never listened. He knew she never would. Maeghara would never hurt him.
Too hot suddenly, he threw off the thick covers and furs he was under, pulling on the cord that opened his bed curtains and swinging his legs over the edge in one smooth motion. He reached for his slippers where they rested on top of the wooden step ladder, worming his toes into the butter soft leather trimmed in fur before stepping down from his bed and onto the thick carpets strewn over the cold stone floor. He shivered as he moved into the room. After the warmth of his bed the chill of not-quite-morning sliced clean through the spider fine silk of his night dress. Gathering his favorite shawl from the divan set in front of the fire, he draped it around his shoulders with practiced ease; feeling its familiar weight settle over his shoulders and fall about his feet. The poor thing had seen better days. Once upon a time it had been very fine. Thick wool in a luscious shade of blue, its border was shot through with gold thread and trimmed all along its edge with nearly a foot of heavy black fringe. It had originally been gifted to him for his ninth nameday by one of the noble families. It had most likely been intended for lesser public appearances.
Heart still pounding, Dee-Ann sprang to action. He got off his knees. If he was leaving, it had to be now. Hid godbells sang with every step, and Ashar slept light as sadsa froth. He needed to silence them. His first thought was to cut them off. But such an act would anger the God. Pulling the sash from his waist, he tied it like a snake around his godbraids, knotting the sash behind his head. Then he crept from his chamber. He lifted the nearest candle from it's holder and walked down the passage to the kitchen. There he took one of the cook slaves' thin sharp knives. He took five small loaves of bread from the basket, and five small bricks of cheese from the bin by the stove. He took an empty flask from the pile ny the door. All the time he listened for any slave to stir. No one did. No one heard him. Safe again in his chamber, he placed the stolen items on the bed.
“I’ve been sitting in the water garden for an hour, waiting like a fool!” Gabriel said taking another sip. Castiel widened his eyes. If he kept going at this pace, his brother would be quite intoxicated. “Only to hear that apparently you’re
“Surely not. But it’s not every day we see a boy trying to imitate us.” She chuckled. “Aren’t most boys your age more concerned with hair and dresses and pretty combs and painting their faces to impress soldiers like me?”
He gasped as his skin was doused in ice, the memory of rough fingers probing his flesh and putrid breath stinking in his face amidst cruel laughter flashing through his mind like an old wound smarting before a storm. Castiel closed his eyes, wanting to clap his hands over his ears like a child and shake his head.
"Silly monkey! You will remain here! And do as you're told!" Derubeis barked. " it is an important Mission we have been given! We have no need of your stupid, chattering, godlessness on the road!"
“You belong to Maeghara Dee-Ann.” She said when she was finished, slipping the Godbone pouch into her robe as she spoke. Her face was grave, but her eyes were warm. “I will not sell you in Et-Haravelle city.”
“That’s a curious accent. I like it.” she mused passing his stick to her other hand. “Why don’t you have a slave braid?” she asked, still smirking her oily smirk and looking at him as if she was picturing him without his tunic.
“I do not speak of my Mistress.” Obid said. She sounded surly. Dee-Ann thought she wanted to agree with the old Pennkeeper, but did not dare.
“Yes your Lordship.” The boy said turning and scampering out of the room. Castiel shook his head. He’d have to find a way to remind the poor thing that – here in the Palace – such peasant honorifics were no longer appropriate. Still, if nothing else he felt a thimble full of satisfaction at the idea that this uncouth little boy was not suffering on the streets of Et-Novakar anymore. Dragging a camel hair brush through his hair in handfuls, he looked out over the city. He could still see its beauty, for Et-Novakar was undeniably that. But remembering the day he and Tran had ventured beyond the gates, he couldn’t help but think of exotic spiders or the venomous snakes the Godspeakers raised in the Godhouse. Beautiful but also dangerous and somehow….cruel.
He realized he was on the ground, his arms curled over his head and his neck on fire. And blinking against the blindness from being back in the dark; he slowly identified a body lying close to him. It was Gord-Ahn.
Hello my LOVELIES!!!!!!!!! So it's finally here!!!!!! My first ever foray into the world of smut. This chapter is pretty much just dedicated to Castiel and Dee-Ann finally doing the deed. I do hope you guys enjoy! I based this quite closely on my own memories of losing my V-Card, so please forgive me if it's not how you guys thought it would be!
had put there. Castiel thought Dee-Ann might fuck him and then still go. Thought that the gift of his body – of his kisses, his cock and his maiden seed – was not enough to make him stay. Dee-Ann wanted to gather him to him, but knew that he could not. He had taken something from Castiel. Something precious. He had hurt him. And the wound would not heal overnight.
“Light see me little brother…where did you even hear such talk?” Gabriel asked snapping open his silken fan and batting it in front of his face and chest. His brother cut a fine figure where he sat, having draped himself languidly on a silver ottoman set at an angle to the fire. Gabriel wore a saffron gown lined in lake blue, over trousers, boots and an undershirt in the same color. The ensemble was a touch too fine for the daytime, not to mention revealing. Trimmed in fur, the neckline left a sumptuous display of shoulder and chest naked to the eye.
“That I do not know. But rumor has it the Queen has canceled all her engagements for the next three days. And she’s ordered all the fireplaces and torches lit in the Crystal Keep.” Tran continued.
Castiel felt a chill pass over his skin. He felt a dry scratch of unshed tears behind his eyes, but he swallowed them down. Crying over the thing would not make it clean.
To Castiel it seemed exactly like the ridiculous sort of nonsense women concocted to keep men busy. Everyone of any influence knew that the Queen would only marry her children to those Warlords that would bring her the greatest advantage. So what did it matter who sent the finest dresses and baubles and beads to the various princes and princesses of the Blood? But – as Gabriel had explained – there were more than enough courtiers and noblemen who had nothing better to do with their time than to gossip about the Princes of the Blood. There was even talk of noblemen who kept ledgers of how many times he and his brothers had been seen wearing a particular color or cut of gown.
“He has never been.” The Truthsayer said. “But….he has served his purpose well. He was selected because he was certain to fall in love with the Queen, and to take steps protect her at all costs. Why do you think I salted his seed all those years ago?”
“What am I even supposed to do here all night? Castiel this is madness. You’re going to get yourself caught. Or worse….” Tran said with genuine concern.
With a surge of pleasure that made his toes curl, Castiel felt Dee-Ann’s warm and calloused fingers take hold of the base of his cock. He watched Dee-Ann’s face carefully as his fingers slowly move up his length and eventually tease back the soft skin half covering the head; which Castiel could feel was well slicked with his lust.
“Tomorrow.” Castiel said. “I’ll do my music and dance lessons after breakfast. Then you and I can sit down and begin hammering out a few of these details. As long as it takes.”
Maeghara looked around her, at the sun killed plane. “A fist of grain, a cup of water. Night and dawn till my word changes. In twenty high suns we will reach Todorok village and trade for fresh supplies. What we have will last until then.”
He didn't know how long he stood there, touching one cord then the next. He closed his eyes, letting his senses and his instincts feel out each one. Before slicing them off and moving his hands to clasp the next one. Some were long. Some were shorter. Some brought a tear to his eye. While others made him feel giddy and restless.
“Look at his feet!” said the older brother frowning. “The soles are like leather. Does he even need shoes?”
“Well what would you have done in my stead?” Castiel asked still pacing. Gabriel had been waiting for him in his rooms when he returned, but for the moment he was too charged with anger to settle in his seat.
It was just as perfect as the rest of him. Long and thick, with a slight upwards curve  leading up to the meaty head. Castiel licked his lips. He had never done anything like this but he’d read about it enough. And using the desires boiling in his mind, he assumed the rest was a matter of instinct. He didn’t ask permission. They were beyond that now. But as he looked up and locked eyes with him, he could tell Dee-Ann was holding his breath.
Clear green eyes – that would have been large even if they hadn’t been widened in fear - framed by long, thick lashes, set beneath slender, arching brows. His chiseled nose sat between sculpted cheekbones hovering above a square, masculine jaw. He was simply put, the most beautiful man Castiel had ever seen.
Dee-Ann followed wordlessly passed the threshold. Stranded, struck dumb; he could do nothing but stare at the shiny green stone floor and the green walls with images of people and places bound inside golden borders and hung from hooks. He stared at the gold and silver tables covered in carved stone people and animals. At the bowls and bowls of freshly cut flowers. Inside the villa was light as day. There were so many lamps and candles burning.
His brother Bartholomew’s costume – which featured a great plume of peacock feathers sprouting from his right shoulder and cascading into a cape down his back – had garnered particular attention. Most notably when he’d raised his arms and the cape had fanned up behind him to mimic an actual peacock in full pride. Much to Gabriel’s – who had followed immediately after – chagrin. His reception from the cheering crowd had been warm, but slightly diminished after the pomp and showmanship Bartholomew had managed.
“I know what you think about me Castiel. What everyone does. With my silly costumes and my little plays. But I am the
As they stared at one another, Castiel began to suspect that this Dee-Ann would not speak again on his own. He allowed a little more power to saturate his tattoos. In the darkness of the Keep he could barely make out anything of Dee-Ann. There was no wood in any of the hearths, but there were hundreds of lamps suspended from the ceiling and easily twice that many torches in wrought iron sconces on the wall. Allowing more power to saturate his tattoos – making them glow brighter – Castiel raised his arms and sent two perfect bolts of blinding white light arching from his palms. A second later the nearest torch was lit – making Dee-Ann jump in a way that Castiel found satisfying – before the light hopped to the next, and the next; until finally after a few seconds a decent portion of he corner they were standing in was lit.
“Well I have to do something for him. We’ll take him out of that place. We’ll bring him back to the Palace with us. Today. I’m sure there’s a place for him. In the Kitchens. Or in the Keep.” Castiel suggested hopefully.
Castiel grinned. It was true. Ever since Tran had taken him to the workhouse that day, Castiel had made it his mission to purchase as many of the wretches and orphaned children he could find and bring them into the Palace. The only problem with that plan was that he’d had to concoct a workable reason for doing so. He couldn’t well blurt out that he’d snuck out of the Palace with a now dead slave and seen the abysmal conditions they were living under. So instead he had lied and said that it was an unnecessary extravagance maintaining a full retinue of servants for him and his silings who might be put to better work elsewhere in the Palace, when these younger ones could do the same work for less pay.
The stench of decaying flesh. The languid, arrhythmic pulsing of a corpse filled with maggots. The taste of rotten milk mixed with the texture of spoiled fruit. All these elements combined into something he could actually
What he wanted was to scream. He wanted to rage. He wanted to beat his fists against something until it bruised. Until it shattered and bled. He wanted to make something or someone hurt the way he was hurting.
– The ability to draw power directly from the God through the sacred spells and incantations inked directly into the skin of the acolyte to perform the God’s miracles.
These warriors belonged to Haravelle Warlord – Maeghara explained – and those curved blades were scimitars. A scimitar could cut a camel’s head right off its neck.
‘He’s nervous.’ Castiel thought to himself.  Next to him, the Godspeaker nodded at the guards and one of them pushed open the heavy oak door into the small rooms beyond.
into my arms.” He said right next to Castiel’s ear, his breath caressing him. Hot, meaty breath that was far too humid to be human. Castiel felt his skin break out in goose pimples, even as his flesh crawled in concentric waves of revulsion. Something brushed his hair, and Castiel felt a trickle of moisture run down his neck. He wasn’t sweating. It was Gord-Ahn’s breath condensing on his skin.
“Find out. There might be something in there.” Castiel admitted. “It might be a good idea to better acquaint ourselves with the more powerful Noble Houses as well. I can’t imagine the minor houses would be of any particular interest. But those Houses which are influential? Who have active treaties with the Palace? Or whose future is closely aligned with the Crown? There should be some records on that at least?” he said as much as asked. For a second, he bristled. All the knowledge he was looking for would’ve been readily available if he’d been a girl. But a boy’s education barely included anything in the way of history, politics or statecraft. Rather he’d learned culture, art and languages. He knew how to bow and curtsy according to people’s station and make polite conversation on a variety of topics. But nothing that was going to help him in this quest to outwit these people.
“They call it Tiger’s Milk. Sip it slowly. It’s very strong. My mother swore by it as a restorative.”  Tran said taking a sip himself. “It was also my Father’s secret recipe for when we were sick.”
Whoever it was, they were less than twenty feet from where Castiel stood. She wore a cloak of some kind, that reached only to her knees; but the hood was pulled up to hide her face. From the state of her clothes, Castiel could only assume she was one of the peasants from the Gypsy camp. He watched as the figure – who seemed to be muttering to themselves – extended a hand into the Godbowl. His blood boiled. A
Derubeis closed the leather lid and relaced all the box’s many lacings, threading them with the charms and amulets. Her fingers moved swiftly, surely and with consummate skill. Dee-Ann marveled at how she remembered every amulet and charm and its proper position. Maeghara stood quietly, watching with a small smile curving her lips. Just as Derubeis finished, the Godspeaker stepped forward carrying a large scorpion carved from some shiny black stone and banded in strips of bronze. Derubeis stood back.
“Bad way to go.” The woman said. “Came back, after all the fighting and warring and killing were done…..only to find my house burned to the ground. Along with everything else. Left him there they did. Hanging from a tree outside our house. Were left to me to slice the father of my children down and put him in the dirt. Weren’t much left to bury by then. Birds had gotten to him. And the rats. Is a funny thing…..” She trailed off.
Dee-Ann could see her wondering about him. Her gaze kept slipping sideways to stare. But he didn’t say a word. He just stood back so they could pass by.
“Never mind that. I have something for you.” He said. Castiel looked at him oddly. Something in Gabriel’s composure had changed very abruptly. And he didn’t like it. “I was going to give this to you earlier, but then the wind….”
“Mistress.” Obid said, her eyes still squirming with maggot questions as she looked at Dee-Ann drawing near.
“You’re awake.” Castiel said softly. Dee-Ann rolled his eyes. Stupid man. Of course he was awake. His eyes were open. But instead of saying anything, Dee-Ann contented himself with a slow yawn and a waggle of his eyebrows.
“It’s true! Haven’t you ever wondered why suddenly there was a seven year gap between Peliel and Nerissa?” Gabriel asked smartly. “Honestly Cassie. Sometimes I think you have all the cunning of a dead lizard.”
After a few moments in which he felt very tired and disoriented, the world finally stopped spinning and his stomach informed which direction would be down for the duration. Looking about himself, waves of memory washed over him like a stream over smooth rocks. This place, this tree……he’d been here before. His breath caught in his throat as he remembered…..
"This is my word Dee-Ann. Ashar will give me daily reports if you do not listen. And I will be angry. If I hear good reports I will be happy. It pleases me that Dee-Ann should learn reading and writing and to dance. Do you wish to please me?"
Maeghara patted his shoulder. “Rubi is right. The past does not matter. Or the Savage East. Rest your tongue Dee-Ann. We move again.”
“I wanted to have a few words with your Mima. And I thought we could have dinner together.” Gabriel said sweeping a wand of scented oil from Castiel’s private store over his chest and neck.
“The God took her husband. And he was old.” Said Derubeis, before her entire face lit up in horror. “Aaaaaaiiiiieeeee! Mega!” her voice was a shocked whisper. “Surely?! No! She dare not!”
I’m going to halt here, cause this chapter is getting long. This is going to be the last Dean Chapter before the time jump! I know Dee-Ann is coming across like a bit of a narcissist. I promise this isn’t what he’s gonna be like the entire fic. Believe me. There a lot of changes coming. And of course, Dee-Ann and Castiel will meet!!!
What part of his mind was rational and logical, told Castiel that it had all been naught but a bit of rather gruesome; but very well executed theater. The kind of base drek one could expect from foreign peasants seeking to scratch out a living in horrid conditions in the city. And Castiel had no doubt Gabriel had crossed her palm with more than a little gold for the effort.
Get up! Get up! " he said. "Dress yourself! The mistress wishes to see you now the mistress wishes to see you now."
He nodded. The Anvil was the dreaded forever desert one highsun’s ride beyond the village Godpost. He’d never seen it of course. But he knew of many Women and girls lured into it hunting Sand cats who were never seen again. He’d used to wish the Woman would be so foolish.
He may have been mightily put out with his sisters for failing to tell him they were leaving for a hunt with just days before the celebrations were due to begin. But it presented a delicious opportunity to spend some time in his mother’s private offices undisturbed. His mother would have quit the Palace to spend the night in the Godhouse. No doubt Kufu would be there performing his….duties….as well.
“Look at you….” Castiel said straightening up, drawing a tentative hand through the ropes of spilled cum on Dee-Ann’s chest. Castiel grunted as he got his legs under him and stood up, Dee-Ann’s cock feeling out of him with a small pop.
“I was hardly expecting a duel at dawn. And the Keep was supposed to be thoroughly abandoned.” Castiel said. “And besides. Dee-Ann wasn’t interested in harming me.”
“I would if I were you. There’s still a veritable mountain of them you have yet to sample, and all eyes will be on us once the Nobility has arrived. A wardrobe malfunction could be catastrophic.” Gabriel said falling into a whisper of horror. “Besides, it’ll be a good opportunity to try House Sha-Tan’s before they arrive….” He added almost tentatively.
“You’re seriously going to pretend you didn’t feel even the tiniest flutter?” Gabriel asked with a superior knowing sort of an expression. “Down below?” he continued, his voice dropping a full octave. “Not even a little….whisper of a
He’d grown into his length of bone, and after a particularly disastrous summer when his skin had been ravaged by puberty – and he’d been subjected to daily treatments at the hand of his Mima to try and tame the flames that scorched his cheeks and shoulders – his skin had cleared to a milky alabaster untouched by the sun. He drew a camel hair brush through the length of his hair, which seated as he was fell almost to the floor. It kissed the back of his thighs when he stood and remained his pride and joy.
“Yes. But with food and bathing and three times three Godmoons? Then we shall see.” The Trader said, her gaze traveling up and down his body.
” she shrieked bringing up both her arms and folding them around her head as if she was being attacked by a swarm of wasps. She groped blindly for something but only ended up sticking her hand directly into the flame of a candle, which yielded another shriek of pain.
The effect was striking to say the least. With a long golden scepter - as much decoration as needed fir walking in his dangerously elevated shoes - he looked more regal than perhaps he ever had.
"As real as you and I standing here." she said. "But hear me. A word of caution before you decide. I have seen every path. They lead many places. Some of joy. Others to the depths of sorrow. Choose wisely. For you can only choose....once. We tempt the wrath of the old gods and thend new with even this choosing."
“Keep them out!” Castiel all but sobbed as he ran into his chambers. Behind him, he could hear Tran barking orders the guards posted at his door arguing with the small army of people trying to gain access.
“And we’re starving!” said Derubeis. “Get out of the doorway you stupid man! And find us some food at once!”
“You’re brown as a bean!” Castiel chuckled once she set him down, the discs at his ears slapping against his face.
They wore what at first glance appeared to be white cotton dresses. But as they moved, Castiel could see they were trousers of a sort, impossibly wide and gathered at the ankle. On their feet were curved slippers embroidered with bright threads and gold. Covering their chests, they wore embroidered silk tunics that covered them from neck to knees. The tunics were slit up the side to make facilitate walking. Over these they wore a garment that was neither coat, nor cape. Striped fabric in bright hues of red and orange hung loosely off their shoulders and all the way to the floor, but their arms were obscured by great square sleeves that hung almost to their ankles. Around their heads they wore square scarves in similarly bright colors, that had been folded into a triangle with points hanging over each shoulder. Tassels fixed to the each point weighed them down, and atop each of their heads they wore a kind of woven crown. To Castiel it looked like wool thread or possibly some animal hair, coiled and embroidered into thick rope that held the scarves in place. They wore no jewelry, save for curved blades at their waists, but Castiel noticed something strange about their faces. It was their eyes. They had been lined in black paint, as if an artist were sketching an outline. This was most unusual. Et-Novakarian women never painted their faces, unless they were charging into battle.
“Maybe. Maybe not. Spread bitch. You give me a living Daughter nine fat Godmoons from now, or I swear by the Village Godpost I’ll be rid of you onto the Anvil!”
“Are people really talking about me?” Castiel asked a little worried, remembering the way The Queen had stared at him with such malice. He gathered his hair and coiled it above his head to Tran could wash his back and under his arms.
“There must be records of which Godspeakers were assigned to which Warlords and Noble Houses.” Tran suggested.
“I’ve done as much as I can do for him until the thing has run its course. Your God? The one you were just muttering oaths to? It’s in their hands now.” El-Don said straightening his back. His tone was rueful, almost angry. And Dee-Ann frowned.
The message was relatively straightforward, if somewhat unexpected. The Queen wished him to present himself for a portait later.
“Why are you doing this?” he choked, feeling the blade at his throat cut deeper and a hot line of blood spill down over his collar.
He let his gaze slide sideways to the mud brick hovel and it’s leaning kitchen window, where the man thought he could not be seen, dangerously watching the trading. The man who had no name. Just descriptions. Bitch. Slut. Goat lick.
“I begged you to help me escape this place God. And you have listened. Your precious and beautiful slave Dee-Ann is grateful. Tonight when we make camp I will make sacrifice to you. And I swear I will do your bidding.” He whispered to himself placing his hand over his chest where his Scorpion amulet hung against his flesh. He crawled until he was sitting with his back against the back of the carriage so he was not looking at Et-Banotaj anymore. He had no desire to remember that place, or any other place than Et-Novakar.
From her voice he assumed she thought he would understand this, but he did not. “What is that?” he asked scrunching up his face.
He pulled off the yellow shift he was wearing   and quickly dressed.  It did not matter that she or any other slave could see his skin. Naga was a gelding.  With the exception of Obid all the slaves in the Villa were geldings.  It was too dangerous to own a slave that could become pregnant.  Slaves fucked like mad things. And a pregnant slave was a dangerous thing.  They could rise up and  tempt the god to smiting by killing their mistresses. On the same day a slave received their red slave braids they were also gelded by the godspeaker.
“Hmmmmmmmm yes. We’ll get to him.” Gabriel said waggling his painted eyebrows. “But I hope you’ll finally leave off with this nonsense of yours. What if it HAD been a woman? Hmmm? Some brigand with a wicked gleam in her eye and trousers full of plans? What if there had been more than one? You could have been
In the middle of the walls red and black stones, there were impossibly tall and wide gates. There was no way to leave Et-Banotaj city. The gates were closed. And the walls were built without footholds. And there were no trees high enough for him to climb.  Where could he hide until morning?
Novaki.” She cut in. “It is the tongue of our people. We are Novaki. This land is Novak, gift of the God.” She explained. When he looked at her not understanding, she shook her head. “She never taught you that much? Your mother?”
“You god cursed sinning stupid fool!” Dee-Ann growled never ceasing in his struggle. “Why did you do that?! You could have died! Stupid man!”
"Your grandmother fought in the war that made allies of them. When the Western isles and territories were conquered. Surely you must know something." Gabriel urged.
And Dee-Ann knew. It was foolish to expect the God to just keep giving and giving, and never have to pay anything back.
who sounded the war drums and launched landed on our soil unprovoked. For twenty years the war raged. First my Great Grandmother, then my Grandmother eventually beat back the Barbarian Queen, burned your fleet and dashed your forces to the wind.” Castiel said with a hint of pride. He’d had the time to do a lot of research about the Western incursion when he’d learned his mother planned to marry him to Li-Illitur.
She gestured with his stick, and Dee-Ann saw his chance. He snatched it back, free of her grasp; and tucked it into his belt.
“You have brought me this far God. Please see your slave Dee-Ann a little further.” He said softly before continuing closer to the tents.
With a rush of panic, Castiel realized what he was doing. In the dark it would be much harder for them to navigate, and Dee-Ann was still tied to the chair. Castiel grabbed the nearest torch before Gord-Ahn could get to it, brandishing it in front of him like a sword. Less than a minute later, Castiel found himself plunged into near total darkness except for the torch in his hand and the light emanating from his tattoos. Next to him, Dee-Ann had finally managed to free both his hands and had moved on to his feet.
Dee-Ann sighed from his shoulders all the way to his toes. “In the name of the GOD Castiel! I beg you….” He said trailing off. “Do you mean to sharpen your tongue into a dagger the entire way to Et-Haravelle? Do you want to cut me with it every time you speak?”
"Tran?" he asked. Tran pressed his finger to his lips to indicate silence, motioning for Castiel to follow. They hurried to his dressing rooms, where by candlelight Tran helped him dress in black trousers, black shirt and a black tunic. Before coiling his hair in a dark sash and draping his same thick black riding cloak from the other night, over his shoulders.
“Forgive me Godspeaker. This one is not mine to offer.” Maeghara said apologetically. The Godspeaker nodded, and Dee-Ann went to Derubeis. For once she touched him, her fingers taking hold of his shoulder. Dee-Ann felt frightened. Maeghara clapped her hands.
His eyes flicked up at Castiel’s and he nodded. Dee-Ann tugged on the lacings, and with each passing moment, Castiel found himself growing harder, more excited. Finally Dee-Ann’s hands were under his buttocks, taking two handfuls of the fabric and easing them down over Castiel’s thighs and eventually pulling them free. He looked down at Castiel’s completely naked body spread out before him.
Dee-Ann was impressed. That was a true sacrifice. To give the God her own blood. The people of Et-Novakar were strong. They loved the God. He would be one of them. And what must come would come soon enough.
“Well do you know our ways Tulu Godspeaker.” Maeghara said, her small smile growing wider. Dee-Ann wondered if they were friends. If it was possible not to fear and cower in the presence of a Godspeaker. Maeghara must be a very special sort of a person to number among her friends a chosen of the
Stupid woman. “When I was in Et-Haravelle I saw Warriors. They wore breastplates that looked like that one.” He said pointing at the retreating back of the woman.
“All the more reason to focus on something else.” Gabriel said sounding impatient. “Cassie, I don’t actually enjoy playing the part of the nagging big brother. But we do need to start getting serious about your nameday celebration. The days are flying by and there’s still so much we haven’t discussed.”
“No….” Castiel said too fast, his voice barely a whisper as he shook his head fiercely. “It’s nothing.”
He was fairly certain he’d had enough of the Moor’s onerous brand of beauty to last him a lifetime. And if he never saw this valley again it would still be too soon.
“It is damp my Lord. I have just finished sponging it.” The young slave said tentatively as if nervous for having to deliver such news.
“I can tell you, that on the way here, I spotted two full caravans laden with silks, and furs. And pretty beads for your hair. Your mum’ll have no use for all those gifts.” Johdilia began, speaking as if she expected Castiel to be very excited about the things she mentioned. “And I even managed to sneak you a few books from Portstown what I thought you might like. But you can’t tell no one you’ve got them, and you really can’t tell no one you got them from me.”
“But the version I heard, he traveled in an almost straight line to his ancestral home of Et-Nogolor and stayed there for almost five years.” Gabriel explained as if he were delivering a monologue. “Our mother practically had to bodily drag him back to the Capital with promises and sweet words of love. As I heard it she showered him with enough jewels and baubles and love gifts to fill an entire caravan.”
“Travel safely in the God’s Eye Trader Maeghara. I will not ask when you will pass this way again. Such things are not fit for a Village Godspeaker to know.” Said the Godspeaker, dabbing this tip of her robe at a drop of blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.
After pishing, tired and sore from camel riding, he yawned cross legged on the blanket Maeghara gave him; amazed as the traders produced rolls of colored cloth from the pack camels baskets. And turned them into little rooms.
“Just what do you think you’re doing?” she huffed as she clutched a hand to her chest. She alternated between looking at his face, then his cock – half hidden by the tunic but still plainly visible when he moved – and anywhere else in the tent.
“If it is your wish…..if that is your price to save him….I will go. I will leave him and never set eyes on him again. Just let him live. I will never be blind and deaf to your wishes again. Let him
thing!” he said in a low, dangerous voice. “I was a free all my life. I was a man when I was given this
“It was a sloppy casting you did in the Keep.” She said abruptly. “Another moment or two and you would have destroyed yourself. Or worse those around you.”
“Only natural.” Tran said with a knowing smile. “The Light sees you Castiel. It sees you in its growing eye. You’re becoming a man.” He continued. To Castiel’s surprise, he didn’t remove his hand. Rather he expertly played his fingertips around the head of Castiel’s cock making him shiver. More blood rushed to his cock, suddenly very interested in the attention it was getting.
Gabriel chuckled at that, removing his hat and ringing the bell to summon the slave so they could order.
Instead he focused on what he could see here and no in front of him. The Queen’s Road guided Dee-Ann, but being cautious of capture; he did not walk it. Instead he darted along the smaller side streets, twisting and turning like a clever lizard through the city’s alleyways. With every swift, soft footfall, he left the Trader’s District behind him. Left Maeghara and Derubeis, and the stupid monkey Hooli.
"You sharpen your tongue on me boy." she said sounding more amused than offended. "It is only the foolish who dismiss things they don't understand. And while you may be many things, foolish has never been one of them."
