Sherlock flinches then, setting his phone on his lap — he still hasn’t met John’s eyes — and resting his hands under his chin. There’s a ten second pause, then he abruptly stands up, popping the collar of his coat up and heading for the door.
There’s no dramatic talk, or plea —  none of the sort. John simply begins leaving things at Sherlock’s flat, and they compile bit by bit until one day, he stops leaving.
They went swimming together once, but John ended up frustrated with how slow Sherlock was and Sherlock himself found his pride greatly damaged by his natural disadvantage. Mostly, they kept to the stony beach, idle and comfortable.
One particularly memorable one, had them running after yet another serial killer. There had been 3 victims. 3 teenage girls killed within 3 weeks. Each one was killed inside a room, that had been locked from the inside, windows closed. Sherlock scanned the latest crime scene, to which Lestrade had finally called him.
“Is that so? Well, then I guess I'll have to thank them as well.” John concluded, kissing Hamish's forehead in thanks, as did Sherlock. “Go on, open the other ones.”
“Yeah.” John agreed and, after a moment, got up and stretched his hand out for Sherlock to take. The younger man took it.
“I just entered a romantic relationship with John Watson, I think it's save to assume I'm good for one or two surprises.”
“Hey, are you alright? Sherlock?” John asked, concern obvious in his voice and expression and it was too much; much more than he deserved. The tear escaped him before he could stop it and he quickly wiped it off his cheek, hoping John hadn't seen it. “Sherlock?”
And there John had him. Mycroft's eyes softened ever so slightly into the gaze he'd come to know as the Holmes' fondness. “Indeed I do.”
“Hamish, est-ce que tu veux avoir un petit frère ou une petite sœur?” Sherlock asked the boy in a soft voice.
Coming back to find John relatively happy with Mary and being serious about their relationship had been something of a slap in the face for him. In all the time Sherlock had spent growing more and more attached to John and taking memories of him to hold on to sanity, John himself had moved away and replaced him. Sherlock wanted him to be happy, but he felt betrayed nonetheless. It had been all the more surprising when John had approached him just as he had finally accepted that he wouldn't get what he really wanted. Maybe it had taken so long because it just wasn't 'meant to be'. With the trouble that was currently on, maybe it would have been best to not engage in this. They could still stop and go back, make it all right, but Sherlock had to admit that he was much too selfish to let John go again. He would make this work, whatever the cost. He was sick of always ending up alone.
John should have guessed, that when he was going to tell Sherlock he was ready, that Sherlock would be busy analysing his own blood. John smiled.
But the right setting would be needed in order to not make him feel too loaded with rules and cornered by arguments.
The most memorable and hardest thing Moriarty made John say was “Ever questioned him? Never weight his loyalty? Or is he really just a little pet?” John didn't know how Moriarty knew, but he knew where this was going. “Nice touch, this: the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him. I can stop John Watson, too. Stop his heart.”
Sherlock chuckled, apparently having decided John was definitely playing a joke on him. “Alright, what are you then? Some sort of Frankenstein, exchanging your dying body parts? Because I have to tell you, for a human jigsaw puzzle, you look very well balanced.”
“Yes. Whenever have we made it to bed when we weren't already in it?” Holmes leaned his forehead against Watson's, his lips split in a smile so big, it was a rare sight even to his friend.
Sherlock agreed to seeing him each day towards sunset. For weeks they sat and talked, leaning into each other as they watched the sun reach for the water on the horizon. Sherlock would often feel down his tail. Though the touch was one of intrigue, a curiosity, John couldn't help feel affection being sent through him in ripples. He, in return, watched Sherlock's legs move with great fascination. His joints were very delicate, providing fine movements where John's fin was stiff in comparison, not to mention the lacking ability to move individual limbs.
Sherlock watched his face as John seemingly collected his thoughts. His pupils were blown wide. Sherlock thought it incredibly attractive. With the dishevelled hair and faster breathing, John looked to him like pure sex. “Coffee or tea?” he found himself asking.
“I don't do it every time I touch you, I wouldn't expect you to take on that hassle. Honestly, I mostly don't mind you touching me.”
By the end of the day, they had made it over to the Met without any large incidents. Don't ask how, but more than three stabbed corpses hadn't been necessary.
Unfortunately, Mycroft didn't know what had been the cause of all this either, but he informed they were aware, that this was a world-wide affair and, according to him, America had a far worse time; not that there should be a competition to being taken over by the most undead – it was promising to be the same result: death.
“Well, you thought wrong.” Sherlock retorted in his deep voice, stretching out his arm. It was the left one, which he'd bitten the very first time a couple months ago. It hadn't left any scars, which he was glad about. He was sure the same couldn't be said about what he'd done to Sherlock's right arm the night before. Still, the wrist was a very sensitive area, so he didn't want to bite it again, not when requiring such a large amount of blood. Instead, he went for the fleshier forearm again, but a lot more carefully that last time. His eyes fell closed as the warm, iron taste touched his tongue and streamed into his mouth slowly. He occasionally sucked at the wounds to get a momentary rush of it to flood his mouth. He could hear Sherlock's pulse pick up, felt it beneath his lips.
Then, he hears Sherlock stand up and shuffle over to him. A line of warmth lights against the exposed skin of John’s back, and he watches long fingers wrap around the box and place it on the table.
“Yes, love, that was the plan.” Sherlock blinks in what John can only categorize as surprise. “Get dressed.”
The answer’s on the tip of his tongue before the question even fully leaves John’s mouth. He thinks carefully about his word choice. “I was upset that you chose her.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath, tapping his fingers on the screen — he’s not typing anymore, John notices — “I needed air. Too many people.”
Instead of pulling away instantly and yelling, Sherlock sinks back into John. Small hands come to rest on raised sides and he leaves a trail of kisses amongst the wreckage.
Sherlock’s fingers still on his phone, but he doesn’t look up; his face remains an impassive mask, shoulders relaxed. The only thing that briefly gives away his discomfort is the slight twitch in his right eyebrow. “Bored.”
He sighs, clicks off his phone. Sherlock’s eyes are closed, hands under his chin and he’s curled up in a ball on the sofa. John’s hands unconsciously clench and flex as he debates his options.
Sherlock doesn’t hear the door open downstairs, doesn’t hear soft coos from Rosie as John stops briefly by Mrs. Hudson’s flat to check up on her, doesn’t hear the familiar trudge of his steps up the seventeen stairs leading into the sitting room.
“Sherlock, breathe. It’s okay. Shh, you’re okay.” Slowly, Sherlock turns around to face him, avoiding his searching gaze.
“That’s not a normal reaction! To— to attack you like that? To beat you and leave you and not. . .  not think about what had happened? To you?”
John’s face brightens in a gentle smile. “Of course.” He holds out his hand, and the detective grasps it tightly, matching his smile with a tentative one of his own.
When he exits twenty minutes later, Sherlock’s sitting in the middle of the bed, hands steepled below his chin, looking vaguely lost. John takes pity; he crawls in beside him, and his sudden weight on the bed snaps Sherlock back to reality.
There’s not anything that’s prompted the question either; John figures that it’s just something that had been at the back of this mind until now.
John chuckles and takes the mug, letting his fingers linger on Sherlock’s. “Hmm. Yes, uh, fine. You just — you never make tea.”
“I love you too,” Sherlock mumbles in his rumbling baritone and that golden trickle bursts into a fountain and John’s floating.
He’s walking to Tesco, rubbing his hands against the cold when the car pulls up beside him. He glances over, rolls his eyes in exasperation when ‘Anthea’ rolls the window down and smiles at him placatingly.
The way he reacts reminds John of someone coming up for air after being underwater for a very long time. He inhales somewhat violently and jerks forward, launching John’s hand from his knee until he’s sitting upright in his chair. “Oh. John! Hello.”
“Any bribes this time? A warrant to search the flat?” And it strikes John as so hilarious, the impassive way Sherlock speaks about his brother, that all he can do is laugh. Sherlock stares at him for a moment, before his lips twitch in the way that means
The coat billows behind him as he strides down the stairs, the firm closing of the door behind him reverberating throughout the sitting room.
Sherlock has too, he notices; in the way he secretly smiles to himself when he doesn’t think John is looking. (John’s always looking.)
“But I. . .  you. . . I hurt you, that night,” John’s arms fall to his sides as the information sinks in. Sherlock steps away, locks the window. He feels cold, brittle. “Why did you let me hit you, Sherlock? You were— you were—”
A small quirk at the corner of his lips, and his head ducks sheepishly for a moment. “Yes. Well. First time for everything.”
He debates which is worse: letting John see his face, or letting John see his back. He turns around.
John rolls his eyes. “Please. You were coming down from an adrenaline rush of solving a case, preventing someone’s death, performing a waltz of your own composition
He gets a nod more than anything, but it seems cautious, slightly resigned, so he curls an arm around a thin waist and pets at the downy curls under his chin. After a second, he flicks the light off on the bedside table and sinks into the mattress. Sherlock sinks in with him.
Sherlock, John realizes quite suddenly, hasn’t slept in almost — he assumes — four days. His first thought: is he on a case? (why didn’t he ask me?)
There’s blood oozing through the side of Sherlock’s shirt; it’s a startling red against the otherwise pristine white.
He’s been silent too long to form a logical lie, and he curses himself for his stupidity when John tentatively says, “Sherlock?”
John barks out an unnatural laugh, purses his lips in that way that means he’s deeply upset. He moves to the couch robotically, sits down and stares at the fireplace. Sherlock follows him subconsciously, hovering a few feet in front of him. “I’m— so. I’m so sorry, Sherlock,”
It’s almost startling how easily they fall back into their normal routine. Their constant rows, the messes in the kitchen, the way they fly through the streets of London, adrenaline coursing through their veins like a drug — and
) He huffs, unbuttons his shirt, peels it off his body. The wound isn’t horribly deep, but it’s long and jagged.
finally), his shirt is faded and blue, worn in some places from overuse, light eyes glittering with amusement —  and dear
It’s dreadfully hot in the flat, despite it being the middle of January. The radiator has been broken in 221B for almost two days; no one’s been able to come out to fix it due to the copious amounts of snow on the road. So, the three of them have just been forced to. . .  burn, essentially. In winter.
He returns an hour later with two boxes of Chinese food from the restaurant down the road and the smell of salt clinging to his skin.
“Some of them weren’t.” It’s quiet, so quiet that John could ignore it if he wanted to. (Sherlock knows he won’t.)
“Uh— he avoids conversation, seems to flinch more when I’m around him—” He cuts off abruptly at the look on Mycroft’s face of concealed amusement. “Is it just me or are you finding pleasure in this?”
He takes a chance then, a split second to calculate, to consider the signs. John leans his head against the detective’s back, presses his lips to a scar.
“Well, this isn’t a situation that requires a personal doctor.” Later, it will occur to John that Sherlock is stalling. Right now, the simmering anger boils over.
There’s a small trickle of something golden and delicious in John’s chest as he looks up at his detective — his hair is strewn with sleep (god
Sherlock wanted to answer, but he wasn't sure what answer would convince John without being a blatant lie. John spoke again before he could reply. “Sherlock, it looked quite bad. It might need stitches. Do you want another doctor to take a look at it, should we go to the hospital?”
John released a surprised giggle. “It's weird.” But he kissed Sherlock again, leaning into it more, increasing intensity. His breath shuddered with both excitement and uncertainty, his lower body alien, moving and reacting in ways he'd never thought he would experience. Sherlock's hip bumped into his and he flinched as rough fabric chafed against his sensitive new skin. He sent a hand down to brush over his hip bone, a shudder running down his spine at the unexpected sensation. His eyes were following his movements, noting how little hairs rose to stand their pride.
“Why would we wish to see you come to an end? Humans are vicious creatures, killing what they deem threatening. We don't appreciate being attacked, but we're also not as ruthless to blindly let others die. Personally, I find your people curious. You are very inventive.”
“You try to be normal where you're not. You try to make me normal. I thought that's what I wanted, especially after what happened, but it's not who I am. I may be crazy to like Sherlock Holmes, but at least I am myself that way.”
At this, Sherlock frowned at him as if he were a particularly stupid new specimen. As if he wanted to say “have you seen me?!”, but without actually uttering the words.
Sherlock followed his eyes down to John's tail. Only there were no scales. “Did that... hurt?” he asked, looking at John's nude legs; now two separate limbs.
Neither cab nor tube were an option, soaked and muddy as they were, so they walked back to Baker Street. It took them a good long while and when they arrived, Sherlock was first to occupy the shower. John, meanwhile, prepared some tea to warm them up from the inside and Sherlock took his gladly when he left the bathroom to John.
He vaguely felt the mattress dip beside him before a pair of strong hands shook him into consciousness. John yawned heartily before looking up and over at Sherlock. “ Mornin'.” he greeted sleepily. He certainly felt better now than when he'd fallen asleep and Sherlock seemed fine as well. Maybe this was a plan that could actually work out fine.
The spare room had beckoned and he had gone, and it was good that he had too, or else he might have overlooked the dark case. Although the additional sleep may have allowed him to reach the obvious truth more quickly.
“Wozniacki, on the other hand, is also considered highly attractive by many and so would remain the obvious choice for the personal show out of the remaining single female players. Of the female players still playing doubles, Sarah Sawyer would be the obvious choice, but since she’s an ex of yours, that might bring additional complications.”
Sherlock’s match had been one of the earlier ones, the one p.m. match on Louis Armstrong. Perfect timing for both sides of the Atlantic: early afternoon for the Americans, early evening for the French. John’s match, in contrast, had been the third on the Grandstand, delayed slightly by the first match running to five sets, which meant his hadn’t even started by the time Sherlock was cooling down in the showers. Meeting back at the hotel had been the only sensible option. Sherlock wasn’t one known for socialising with other players or associates, and they had no wish to draw any unnecessary attention to themselves by having Sherlock waiting around needlessly. They were known to be friends and doubles partners, as unlikely a pairing as the rest of the world believed them to be, but anything more than that was quite frankly none of anybody else’s business.
Carefully easing out the soft cloth, he used it to carefully wipe over the strings, pleased to see it come away free from dust and rosin residue. Whoever had prepared the instrument for storage had done an excellent job.
“John, there’s something... I should say. I-I’ve meant to say it. I’ve wanted to say it. I’ve just never-”
“Finally Watson manages to hold on there. For the first time in three service games he’s managed to hold serve, forcing Holmes to serve for the match.”
Until this point he had rightly and obviously refused to consciously consider the doctor in a sexual manner. Five days ago the doctor had been nothing more than an abductor, a kidnapper and a potential rapist. Today he was still all of those things, and yet he wasn't, because now he was also a man, a bereaved lover, and a surprisingly easy and interesting companion.
“Mhmm,” he said, glancing to where Sherlock was now beside him, racket bag slung over one shoulder, kit bag slipping down from the other to rest on the floor. “Easy for you to say,” he added with a small smile before turning back to looking down the player’s entrance corridor. The security guards, ushers and cameras were already in place, just waiting for that final walk. “You sure you‘ve got everything? Rackets? T-shirts? Spare ego for when you lose?”
“It’s Holmes to serve and he looks unruffled and collected as he swaps his towel for the tennis balls. He takes his time but the serve is good. Watson returns. Holmes with the forehand and Watson’s return goes into the net.”
So that was an roller coaster closing weekend to this year's US Open. I could write absolutely anything in this story now and it would still be more believable than what actually happened in real life. :D
Tomorrow was the last day. The last full day at least. The day after tomorrow he would walk away, with or without the violin, and he would likely never see the doctor again.
He had been planning on staying here overnight and starting a fire, he remembered. That seemed such a long time ago now.
Because it was obvious the doctor hadn't even managed that much. He was still dressed as he had been those hours earlier, his blankets still neatly folded beside the sofa.
"Know what? That it was written by some distant relative of yours? How could I? I'd pretty much forgotten we even had it. I take it you know of it then? Have a copy yourself?"
"Dubhloch Castle," he said slowly, piecing together what he knew of the events that followed and what had already been said, "the ruin, that was the English?"
place. He had no desire to be reminded once again of the dead man who had had so much - a Stradivarius, really? - even if part of him wanted to know more about the history of the place.
As happy as I inevitably am to have my partner back with full memory of who I am and the past we have shared, this does not mean that I am not without sorrow in having to lose the man I have come to know. It is, perhaps, foolishness; certainly it has been expressed to me as such on many an occasion, but I find it a human reaction that I am more than willing to entertain since so much more has been lost to me.
"About you in specific?" he responded. "Beyond reasonable doubt, within the third month of you rooming here. Of the existence of your people in general, it has been a few years since I became aware of their actuality."
It might have sounded like an arbitrary time, but it wasn’t, although it took a moment for Sherlock to figure it out. Seven days, the doctor had promised him right at the start, when they had sat in those armchairs facing each other as near strangers. Seven days to get to know each other followed by the final decision, the decision that either way came with the promise that the following morning would see him free to leave and return to his life in Cambridge.
Jerking up, he looked around, searching for his companion, but found only still emptiness. He could hear the hiss of water through the old pipes, the gentle hum of the fridge, the soft crackles of a dying fire, but little else. He certainly couldn't hear any sign of shared occupancy.
"Ah," the doctor said with an amused shake to his head. "You have no idea what I'm talking about. So, just a random choice then? Your favourite?"
This was the man he loved. This was the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with; this beautiful, talented, brilliant man, who hid his heart behind a shield of indifference and sharpness.
He breathed in deeply as Sherlock’s voice brought him back, and opening his eyes he found his lover looking back at him, all knowing smile and arched eyebrow.
The doctor gave him an apprising look, but shook his head as he put the vehicle into reverse. "Not this time."
A shiver ran through him at the memory of the words. His fingertips scratched aimlessly at his neck, the steady beat of his pulse drawing his attention. His external carotid artery. The conductor of oxygen rich blood to the brain. The carrier of life and the exact place he had been bitten.
Dates were neatly written across the backs of the photos. 1974 across the first, 1962 across the middle, 1949 across the last, and through them, Sherlock recognised the man Harry had been, grey and middle aged in the first, to a young man surely only a few years older than Sherlock was now in the last. With him stood John Watson, younger and healthier than he looked now, but, fashion aside, near identical in each picture.
Walk or stroll, Sherlock certain had more than enough energy to take the driving position, tipping his head back as he finally sank onto John’s length. He took it slowly at first, almost teasing, rising and falling with a grace and ease that had John almost mesmerised. There was no hurry, no deadline to keep to, nothing but the two of them. A change of angle had Sherlock leaning into him, their foreheads resting, their noses brushing, their mouths pressing together, lips parting, tongues mimicking the movements lower down.
“You’re closer,” Sherlock said his attention already back on the television and whatever game was currently being played.
"Douse the room upstairs of course," he continued. "Harry's room. That's where it has to be. Because that's where it matters. That's where it
"Come on," the doctor said softly, pushing himself to his feet. "Jeep's down there. Let's get you back before the cold really sets in."
Anticipation, the doctor had said earlier, and holding to that the doctor moved slowly, drawing the fabric carefully up and over his erection, then down and under his bum, until he pulled his legs up to get them over his feet. Then the fabric was tossed away and the doctor was
The doctor raised his eyebrows and quirked his lips. “Can’t you deduce it?” he asked, his teasing tone tempered by the small, soft smile that inexplicably spoke of fondness and affection. It was a far cry from the scornful mockery he got when he revealed his 'trick' at university.
“The players shake hands at the net, but it’s the Frenchman and world number three who marches into the semi-finals. John Watson, the Wimbledon Champion, is on his way home.”
It was a joke. It had to be a joke. Ah, there is was, the slight twitch to Sherlock’s lips that confirmed he was jesting.
It was only then that Sherlock realised the irony of his choice. Moving and haunting, yes, but was it really the best tune to be playing on the doctor's dead lover's instrument? It was too late to change though and doing so would be admitted his error in choice, but he darted his eyes in the doctor's direction just to see his reaction. He expected a frozen smile, or a pained acknowledgement, or even the thin lips of anger.
"Systematic desensitisation relies on the identification of an anxiety inducing stimulus hierarchy," Sherlock said as the music once more slowed with the next track.
"Well," John said, sucking in a deep breath, "I've done it now. For good or ill. It is done. No going back now."
Between the foot of two not insignificantly sized would-be mountains, he found himself facing the unenviable question of whether to follow the river and brave the forest, or go high, risking non-existent paths on treacherous terrain but staying in the open.
He left the art in favour of seeing what else there was. Beneath a battered pipe and a Persian slipper that smelt of tobacco, he found a stack of books.
“True,” John said. “True, but, uh, next time could you do me a favour and just tell him to come and talk to me instead.”
"What happened here?" he asked, motioning to the ruined castle as he caught the doctor up. It wasn't the question he most wanted to ask, but it was the one that seemed safest.
He sorted through his clothing, separating out his from what he had borrowed. His repacking lacked the precision neatness of the doctor's original, although he did manage to get it all in his bag. Just. The doctor's estimate of what and how much clothing he would need had been near spot on. It was almost as if he had cleverly planned and engineered this whole endeavour.
"No," the doctor said, offering a drawn smile. "Or at least, not any more" He tapped his fingers. "My mother died when I was very young. I don't really remember her anymore. I had a sister, but she's gone too now. Long time ago. My... father, I haven't seen him in a long time. He has... other children. Another life. We're not close. I suppose that means I have other siblings around somewhere, but-" he trailed off.
Sherlock looked so pleased at that that John couldn’t help but reach out to catch his hand and squeeze it.
He wasn't a coward - he wasn't! - he just needed time and space to himself. There was also a room he still hadn't fully looked through, and very little time left to do so.
“Watson doesn’t question it, just wipes at his forehead and goes to collect the balls for his serve.”
, with a variable degree of success, including what appeared to be the solution for at least one problem Sherlock thought was still only partially resolved.
“That was the second top twenty player Zhi Zhu has taken out of this competition. Can he do the same again, this time against a top ten player?”
His words caught me so unprepared that I could only query his meaning by voicing his name as a question.
“We definitely can’t rule out the all-out attack. Holmes must know what Watson’s weaknesses are, and he’s a player that’s all about precision. He’ll hunt for the cracks in Watson’s armour and slip the knife right in, then he’ll wiggle it about until, bang, he’s pried Watson’s game apart and he’s ready for the kill.
He slipped the pistol back under the pillow. He would have to come up with a better hiding place, if only for his own peace of mind. First, though, he had a doctor to find.
He spun round to look at the doctor himself. There, ring on his right hand; two bands interwoven in a Gaelic pattern; ring finger but not a sovereign ring; no other jewellery; the ring cleaned and cared for; sentiment. There were multiple possible reasons for wearing
"Who?" the doctor started to ask but then stopped, looked towards the ceiling as he sucked in a breath and then shook his head. "Sorry," he said after a moment, "I should have thought-". He stopped again for a moment, an odd, almost pained expression on his face. "Harry," he said finally, his voice quiet. "His name was Harry. Sorry. Excuse me." With that the doctor put down the books he was holding and walked across the room to the front door, then through it and outside, the door closing surprisingly softly behind him.
The second kiss was hotter and deeper, John’s hand sliding to Sherlock’s nape to keep him as close as possible. It was a surprise then when Sherlock caught his hand and gently started to pull away.
The clock chimed the third hour less than ten minutes after they returned. For a moment, Sherlock froze, trapped between action and inaction.
“His partner was at both Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Obviously pregnant. He’s not down to play in Moselle despite it basically being home turf and they do like as many of us Frenchmen there as possible, which means he has better things to do and is expecting to be distracted from the tennis. Due to become a father would easily account for all of that, and obviously the baby came early otherwise he wouldn’t be here stuck on the wrong side of the Atlantic.”
. If you are not aware of how much I ardently respect and admire you, then you are less than half the great detective we both purport you to be. Equally, if you truly believe, regardless of my own inclinations, that your confession be so abhorrent to me that I would both quit this residence, and place your life and reputation in the brutal unfeeling hands of Scotland Yard, then
"Thought I'd get something to read for a bit." He motioned to the kitchen table where he had left all his books scattered.
I was aware of his methods, having had the pleasure of witnessing them first hand on many occasion, but never had I fully considered the extent of the truth he might see in me. Or that he might be aware of others like me. I was, we were, after all, an impossibility.
Unused kit, spare socks, sweatbands still in their original packaging, a very expensive Omega watch - no doubt a sponsor thing.
“Fuck, yeah,” he breathed. “And if you ask why I might find it important that my partner’s mind isn’t being played with by a frankly detestable individual, then I’ll punch you in the face and call you an idiot.”
“It looks like we’re getting ready to start, both players now back at their chairs, going through their final checks. Watson is at the far end in blue and white, while Holmes is in white with blue pin stripes, and it will be Watson to open the serving.”
It was like an epiphany. Seemingly random pieces suddenly slotted together into such a vivid picture that he wondered how the hell he might have missed it in the first place. As it was, it was all he could do not to gasp out loud. That would not have done, as even with as simple a mind as the doctor possessed, even he could not have missed such an obvious expression.
Then his thought train was broken by the doctor chuckling and motioning in his direction. "Sherlock, Adair MacKenzie, an old... friend. Adair, Sherlock."
The ceiling above his head was white and uneven before sloping away to exposed dark wood beams, slightly warped with age. It was a far cry from the plain stone and brick of his college, and further still from the wider urban township he had grown accustomed to.
He was startled when the mouth returned to his opening, tongue lapping at the softened muscle before finally drawing away. A shift on the mattress and then he felt it, the tip of the doctor's erection resting at his entrance.
A lighter brush made him groan and push back against the hand in an attempt to get greater contact. He was rewarded with a quick double press that had him bucking forward with a cry. It was good, so good, and he widened his legs automatically, his cock brushing against the pillow for a dual sensation.
“Yes. Yes, it was. World number three.” John gave a small shrug. “Was only ever a slim chance of winning. Still, he’s an incredible player, even if he has a reputation of being a bit of an arse.”
"In that case, properly means I'm going to touch you." The doctor's gaze held steady with his. "Nothing... inappropriate. The only skin to skin will be my hands," he held them up, flexing the fingers, "to your face and head. Except for our mouths, of course," he amended. "Anything you don't like, tell me. The rest, just trust me, and relax."
But he wasn't, was he? Here he was, in the rain, without a coat, boots unlaced, water dripping down his neck, and he was not, he was not happy.
Inexplicably the doctor's grin only grew. "I'll have to take your word for it," the doctor said. "Although I do recall that he was somewhat overweight. Your mother had hoped he would grow out of it. What's he done now?"
So attack the second serve, force Sherlock into the net, especially on his backhand, and do the unexpected.
Paris, John finally realised. He was seeing the sight of Sherlock in the moments following his loss to Moriarty in the final of Roland Garros. This was the Sherlock who had come so close to lifting the Coupe des Mousquetaires at the French Open only to have it snatched from him. Sitting on his courtside chair, towel clenched in his fist, Sherlock didn’t move, didn’t react, just stared and stared and stared.
Sherlock had never had a friend, a proper friend, but he imagined that this was what it might be like.
“It’s through to the final eight for him, and who knows, maybe even one step closer to the much coveted and dreamt of final.”
"At an impasse, I then returned to considering the other individuals I had identified as being members of the club. It took only another week to adequately confirm to my satisfaction that the other members too shared the Count’s abilities, although not his nightly habits.
Sherlock welcomed the kiss, meeting it half way, relishing in the languid feeling that meant it was more for the sensation than it was for the desire for it to go anywhere.
Twenty minutes in and he considered how much of a mistake this might have been. The going was slow at best, hazardous to his wellbeing at the least, and probably no easier than had he decided to go up the hill front. It was no tame, ordered forest of the likes he was used to. This was wild, tangled woodland.
Still wrapped in his blue dressing gown, Sherlock had a copy of the New York Times spread before him, a partly drunk mug of coffee the only part of the breakfast he had so far helped himself to.
After that he was unsure. Should he dress fully? Trousers, shirt, that sort of thing? But that seemed a little ridiculous considering what was going to happen. Why dress when you were only going to undress again? Yet just wearing pants was a step too far in the opposite direction. He needed something that said ‘here I am, I'm ready’, but not, ‘here I am, leave the money on the dresser’.
It was with weaker legs and a lighter heart that I retook my customary chair and pondered how best to proceed.
He considered what he wanted and the best way of getting it. He considered the doctor and the type of man he was. He considered the pros and cons of the options, the immediate likely future, and the wider circumstances.
Given the permission, Sherlock’s movements were almost cat like as he closed the gap between them, but he stopped before they could touch. Snaking his arm round, he found the knot that held the towel up and undid it with one hand, letting the towel simply fall to the floor. Then tilting his head, he moved closer still until they were merely inches apart. “Get on the bed,” he said. Then he was gone again, moving away, toying with the bottles in his other hand.
Lamiae: 1) From classical myth: a mythical monster (traditionally female) who preyed on human beings and sucked the blood of children.
Three ways he could beat Sherlock and all of them rested on Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock would have to lose, pretty much throwing the match away, which was in no way appealing.
Sherlock considered it. Bach would normally be his go to composer. Sonata No 1 in G minor would be the obvious choice. Air on the G string was another possibility. They were both pieces in the doctor's record collection though and would have been played in the records better than anything he could manage, even with the instrument in his hands.
His eyes fell, his gaze catching on the small piece of metal pressed into the bench, previously obscured by their bodies.
Sherlock acknowledged with another kiss before carefully slipping off, sprawling himself across the rest of the sofa, legs spread, lips curving up into a come-hither look.
“Is that his ring tone?” Clara said, sounding far too excited about it. No doubt she was now imaging Sherlock to be some kind of sexual deviant, the type that went further than just sleeping with other men.
True, the doctor had so far shown no sign of minding where Sherlock looked, but there was always the exception.
Offering a small smile and his hand - because that was what you did - he was taken back when the stranger ignored both, slapping two strong hands onto his shoulders and looking deeply into his eyes.
“Mmm,” Sherlock said, his lips curving into an almost smirk, his hands lowering to John’s head so his long fingers could brush through the fine hair.
you. At some of the things you do or don't do, like not noticing that shops now open on a Sunday, but not actually
"Which left you with a little, quiet but persistent voice at the back of your mind, wondering, always wondering, because if they were right about that, then maybe they were right about all the other things as well. Maybe you are the weirdo they always thought you to be. The loner who doesn't need any friends anyway. The freak they always claimed you were.
“That there is. So let’s talk about Watson in that last set then. He won it, and he won it, if not easily, at least proficiently in the end, but there was a moment of possible concern early on.”
“Because the unofficial story involves the real you, an incredibly beautiful but devious woman, and a very cunning plan. That’s far more scintillating for me than any number of false tales of sexual gymnastics. Come on, you must have had a right old time manipulating the press. You can’t tell me that wasn’t just a little bit enjoyable.”
“And Watson’s managed to consolidate his break. He leads the world number three, Sherlock Holmes, in this first set.”
But that was a lifetime ago. Several lifetimes in fact. Before Harry and Cambridge, before the destruction of two world wars, before an Empire and lodgings in Baker Street, even before Madagascar and those pirates.
John pressed his lips together at the reminder that there had been other people that Sherlock had talked to. Before him. He wasn’t jealous, he was just… no, okay, he was jealous, at least a little bit, but everyone has a past. Even the woman in front of him did. Not everyone was invited into Sherlock Holmes’ personal space though.
Hanging up his towel, he set about making the final adjustments. The throw was the first thing to go, pulled off the bed, folded twice more and tossed into the wardrobe for safe keeping. Next he pulled the duvet from the bed. It made sense. If it stayed it would only get soiled and he had no intention of hiding under it like a Victorian maiden wanting to protect her modesty. If they were going to do this, they were going to do it and he would give the doctor no excuse to mistake exactly who it was he was being intimate with.
“You’re going to have to talk to her sometime,” Greg continued. “You certainly don’t want her phoning Sherlock instead.”
Me. Physically. Physically me? Me. Me? Sex? Was it sex? Was that what he was referring to? Was it sex with me?
The doctor's gaze racked over him, eyes narrowing just briefly, and then he was stepping to the side, pushing the door to but not fully closed behind him.
Fermat’s Last Theorem is the most notorious problem in the history of mathematics. It was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had proof that was too large to fit in the margin. The first successful proof was released in 1994 by British mathematician Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians.
"This was a broch," the doctor said as he led them to the ruin. "A stronghold for those who lived and defended this land. A place of shelter for those under attack. The perfect plot to be able to see for miles, but still easily overlooked by new invaders. More than one ambush was orchestrated from here. More than one massacre as well."
By the time Sherlock switched his ministrations to his second foot, John wasn’t sure he was going to survive the evening. Closing his eyes, he arched into a full length stretch, sinking into the sensations now racing around his body.
“Nothing,” John said, quickly crossed the room to where his lover just, raising onto his toes in order to press a kiss against Sherlock’s lips. “Just remembering how much I love you.”
After all, just look at him. A year ago at this time he had already crashed out of the Open in the first round, had spent the day of his birthday being tossed around a court by a mere child on the Challenger Tour, and the evening of his birthday drowning his sorrows in a bar not even caring enough to try chatting up one of the vaguely attractive female patrons.
“So do I,” Clara confirmed, “and mine don’t include quizzing my other half over why he has female sex noises as his text alert.”
Sherlock’s lips thinned, fingers lowering to his chin but remained steepled. “There’s little to say. Your shoulder is temperamental and tends to cause you physical discomfort. Your unconscious movements in the last hour alone show your muscles to be overly tense with an above average amount of soreness. While this not an unusual occurrence considering our profession and this tournament, the increase in your discomfort is beyond that which I deem acceptable and will only increase after tomorrow’s practice. As you have previously responded well to physical manipulation it follows that you would benefit greatly from one at this stage of the competition.”
Alright. He was alright. He may have been drugged, kidnapped by an old vague acquaintance and brought to the middle of nowhere by someone who apparently wanted him in some way that may or may not be sexual in nature, but so far he was fine. The doctor had not moved to touch him, other than to check his pulse, and had in fact remained rather nonchalant about the whole thing.
The doctor was giving him a choice. It was no accident that both the jeep keys and the key to the only room in the property he had not yet been in had been left in clear view. On top of that, the doctor had also removed himself from the premises on a no doubt extremely flimsy pretence in order to give him the choice.
Of course it was considerably easier for Sherlock to say that than it was to actually do it. Sherlock wasn’t the one who was going to be on the receiving end of Zhi Zhu’s attacks. Then again, as annoying as it could be at times, Sherlock did tend to be right.
So was this just another gamble with weighted odds? Had the doctor left the keys and vacated the property solely because he was betting that Sherlock’s drive to uncover the unknown was stronger than his desire to escape?
“A vampire? Count Dracula? Twilight?” John offered. Sherlock looked back at him, expectant. “Well, they are lousy examples, I give you that, but at least they're cliché.”
The blond's chuckle was silly in its innocence and sweetness. “No. You were... unexpected. You know we can't be together like that, right?”
“Oh, I am not sure we shall need it. Do inquire Dr Watson, when he returns, whether he will require food.”
He wanted to retort, to call nonsense on that story, but somehow he felt he had to believe John. If he could be charmed so easily, no woman would stand a chance but flutter at the presence of this beautiful man. “Am I just a trophy in your collection, then?”
“You can live in water, I cannot.” Sherlock argued, searching the other man for means to survive in the depth of the ocean. Indeed, he could faintly see two slits just behind John's jawbones, like those of a fish.
John pursed his lips briefly. “Yeah, nothing broken, just a little cracked. Will be fine. Let me take a look at that, please.” With his words, John approached him, and while Sherlock knew he only meant well, it felt a little like pushing some boundaries he hadn't been aware of himself.
“Plenty of sunken ships and treasures on the bottom of the sea. Not yours, I'm afraid, but better than nothing, yes?” The way his head was cocked just that bit to the side, the friendly glimmer in his eyes. Sherlock reached out and touched his cheek. John was so handsome in his own way, even though conventional beauty seemed to escape his weathered features. John set down the bag on Sherlock's stomach. It sounded and felt like coins. “I can always swim back there and get more.”
The man smiled, but there was a twinkle in his eye. “You have a strange way of showing gratitude. And what is that tone of voice?”
The night they lay back in their old position: John's back to Sherlock on the small single bed. Nothing happened and John was content.
“What did he mean, John?” Sherlock asked more firmly. He had his arms crossed over his chest – an unusual pose for him and definitely one John didn't like on him.
“I know.” Sherlock said, and indeed he did. John had always been loyal until he felt Sherlock had betrayed him. Even then he had come back.
“Yes, it was.” Sherlock said honestly, fighting his emotions down. He knew John had a way with words. Just not a very good way. Especially when he was angry at himself. “I think you should take some time to calm down. We can discuss this situation if you want, but only if you are thinking reasonably.”
When at last Watson was satisfied Holmes was thoroughly prepared, he retrieved his fingers and let go of the other man's erection, pouring more oil to coat his own. He pressed inside slowly, gently, very conscious of the pain in Holmes' scrunched up face.
They didn't talk about it, didn't even mention it the next day. Everything went like their usual routine. But that day, finally, Sherlock ate something. John felt sickly satisfied to watch him chew on those beans, swallow spoonful after spoonful, until his entire bowl sat empty before him. He was aware that Sherlock's eyes were laid on him, but he couldn't bring himself to meet them. Looking into the cold, analytic stare of his best friend, his only friend, was about the last thing he could deal with right now; he'd rather keep his mind alive and distracted instead of being reminded of what lingered outside.
“No, but you can make one!” Hamish piped in, looking at them with wide, happy eyes, like he wanted them to do that right now so he could have his companion right now.
He hadn't consciously believed them, but still subconsciously secluded himself until he was alone and able to blame everyone else, calling them simple-minded and stupid, not worth his time, while he was just fleeing the mockery and the shaming comments, the hurt these people had caused them.
“I should be much obliged.” With a wicked grin, he let Watson guide him over. The tickets to the theatre were left on the small table as they moved the little distance. They made themselves comfortable, Holmes sliding in between the other man's legs. He caressed Watson's face, stroking his slight, short curls back into a smoother line. A day's work always untangled the stubborn strings, especially at his temples. Watson, knowing Holmes for quite some years, could tell his friend was again thinking much more than feeling, calculating which way to best entertain him this night. A grin split his lips and he drew Holmes' head near, attempting to stop the brainwork with a passionate kiss. Indeed, Holmes moaned in response. After some time of their lips moving, Holmes pushed his tongue forward, drew it along Watson's mouth until he was granted entrance. It was shortly after that he began to move his hips as well, grinding his swelling erection along Watson's own. Their breaths became ragged. “We
Sherlock looked down at where his hand was pressing against his stab wound, his white shirt soaking up the blood, making it look more dramatic than strictly necessary. He shook his head, waving his other hand dismissively. “It's fine. I'll clean it when we get home, bit of dressing. Had worse.”
I'm sorry it took me so long. I'm having weird periods these days, not all of them nice. I do hope you bear with me, though, and that this isn't getting ooc - I'm losing control of these stories lately.
I gathered the rest of my thoughts as he nodded and began his return back into the columns of his papers. “Before the topic is fully dropped however, I wish to thank you.”
They'd spent the following evenings together on the couch, watching telly, cuddled up, until they didn't look at the screen any more.
The brunet shifted closer, his lips right by John's ear as he whispered “because,” his hand skimmed along an angled jaw, then down his throat, taking note of the strong heartbeat fluttering just below the skin, “you fancy me.”
He had just discovered the whereabouts of a long-lost treasure; a great heap of gold coins and jewellery. He had solved the great puzzle of the Musgrave and earned his price. The families of his men would never feel hungry again. He could provide his ageing mother and pay off the debt his brother held over his freedom. For over a century this treasure had been lost and he had found it and he ordered his men to take and he clung to the trees on the shore as he looked out to his only mistress with pride. No man and no woman could ever entice him, not with any promises, as the ocean could with her great fantasy, her depth and her mystery. It was a marriage in which secrets had their rightful place, and yet trust was endless between them.
Mycroft cleared his throat delicately, but it was John who answered. “You would leave behind your family and be stuck with me.” Sherlock was just about to say something, however, John stopped him. “Your family is worth the time, Sherlock. Don't waste your opportunity. After the trouble you went through for your mother? After how your brother cares for you? Is this really how you want to repay your crew? Honour their deaths?”
After engaging in the very basics of kissing, pressing their lips together and messaging each other lightly, Sherlock dove straight for the only other thing he knew, something he'd seen on TV many times. Fortunately, John had lead his tongue away from his tonsils and back into his own mouth, closing his with a fond smile and took it all the steps back down to where they were still exploring.
So the lay, on the too small furniture, embracing the flutter of their hearts in the quiet of their sitting room.
Sherlock sighed, taking a second to think about how to phrase this without it sounding any kind of wrong. “I just sometimes don't feel much like being touched. It's not personal.”
As John approached to hand him a paper towel to clean himself with, Sherlock took a step backwards. “H-how did you do that?!”
“We're not immortal.” John negated. “Our life-span is just stretched out a lot. How long a life-expectancy a vampire has, depends on the age at which they became one. Someone born a vampire will live up to five hundred years. I was turned when I was forty, so almost exactly a hundred years ago. At my age, my total life-expectancy lies at about two hundred and fifty years. The turning, by the way, can be caused either way. It's not the saliva or the blood specifically that induce the turn, it's a poison that is contained in all bodily fluids, which is why one has to be careful in interacting with a human that one does not want to turn. Too much exposure will lead to it. However, the poison is more highly concentrated in the blood, so there is lees blood need for a turn to happen than saliva or... others.” John finished, looking to the side awkwardly.
Sherlock observed John's face. He was giving him the decision. It wasn't about anything other than the wound and he couldn't say how grateful he was if he wanted to. “You do it.”
He spent the night sitting on the kitchen floor, leaning back against a counter in mild frustration.
Dread settled within John. He hadn't expected Sherlock would react so strongly. “Calm down. It's just like I told you, I'm a vampire, we just.. have these.”
John groaned at mention of movement. He felt dizzy and his upper body clearly wasn't ready to bend. He heard a beeping that wasn't his heart beat monitor. Sherlock had turned down the dosage. It started dawning on him what Sherlock was talking about. “Oh, crap..” he sighed, moving to climb out of the bed, hissing at the pain he could feel despite the drugs.
“Oh, you want coffee? Sorry.” John replied, setting to make some coffee for Sherlock as well. He was right, usually they drank coffee in the morning together, but with the prospect of a cold on John's part, the doctor decided to try and kill the thing before it really broke out or, considering the absence of an immune system and that the illness was probably already going strong if the sneezing had begun mere hours after he'd bathed in the cold Thames water, at least keeping it low for as long as possible.
John sat straighter at that, sighing a little as he remembered. “I never bit anyone before, that is still true. I drank the blood of one of my dying mates. As you can probably tell, the bullet had went right through my shoulder, so I didn't have to pull it out. He was already taking his last breaths, I could hear it, so I.. lapped at his open wounds until I had the the balance of a newly turned and just passed out. When I woke up, my wound was already healed, but with my leg and my hand, they sent me home as invalided. God, his face still haunts me.” He had his head hanging, eyes closed to keep the images out. It didn't help. That young soldier was still looking at him like he was seeing ghosts, monsters.
They were taking him with their ambulance. Sherlock hadn't been allowed to drive with them, so he'd promised to follow in a cab.
“No. It felt awkward, however.” He tried moving his lower body and found his legs to be lighter and much easier to use. He kicked Sherlock accidentally. “Apologies.”
John would often move his fingers through the wild curls on Sherlock's head, intrigued by the way he got stuck in the dry knots. The human found that part less pleasing and complained about the pain. He'd long given up running a hand through John's short hair; there was little fun in doing so when it was wet and when it was dry it just stood up in odd angles, looking silly. He briefly wondered how John cut his hair.
Sympathy fell on her face and she patted his hand. “Oh, my boy, I am so sorry. Who would have done that?”
Then, the next day: Boom! It was everywhere. Every news report was all about how the 'Hospital of the Dead' was abandoned by the entire staff and all the patients, walking, limping, stumbling like lifeless beings, overpowering the guarding police forces and running free around the city.
John, hand on the banister, sighed deeply, not ready to stand right in the middle of the storm. “Can we do this tomorrow? I'm tired, I just want to sleep right now.”
He strapped the backpacks around his front and his back, telling Sherlock to take the clothes and food one. It was the lightest – as was Sherlock.
“Aren't we all, in a way?” Sherlock turned his head around. No doubt John was about to be romantic at him now, not that he really minded. “We all fight our own battles and we all carry the scars. You're no lesser man than me because of anything that was in your past or the way your body looks.”
“Romantic.” He rolled into the crevice between John and the back of the sofa, which also shoved John further to the edge of it until he had to get up in order to not fall.
John laid a hand on his shoulder and put down a mug on the table. “Do you want to talk?” His question was very carefully voiced. Sherlock really didn't, but he supposed he would have to sooner or later, so he shrugged.
Now, John did hard not caring for Sherlock on a deeper level. His initial and instant attraction towards the human man played the largest role in this, no doubt. He was a handsome fellow, if odd. But despite the tickle from his stomach through his tail fin, the charming character of “Captain Blackbeard” not only surprised John, it had charmed him. He was not to fawn over the phantom of a merman, he gave retort to John, letting him bring him back to land as if it were the most natural place for them both to be in. And yet he seemed not to be a man to blindly follow a story. There was a sharpness in his eyes, like the blue skies hiding an eternity of truths and secrets. John wanted to know them all and yet he would not ever need to.
“All taken care of. I asked Mrs Hudson to cook for us so I could take care of you.” Sherlock explained, pushing back the duvet to take a look at John's bandages.
John's hand would caress his arm or his side and he would start nudging at the sensitive skin on Sherlock's neck. The younger man would tilt his head away to indicate his allowance of John peppering him with little kisses there. It was a funny feeling every time. Somewhat ticklish, very calming and weirdly hypnotic. And so very intimate. Sherlock couldn't think much when being with John like this. He liked it. It became their routine for both of them to tune down after another day of working/thinking.
They happened to end up on the sofa together by happy coincidence every night, then. Sherlock started eating regularly, taking his meals together with John. Then he'd lay thinking on the sofa until John went to sleep. After a week or so John stopped telling himself it was coincidence. After nine days, he turned around, he couldn't keep showing Sherlock his back, he needed to touch someone, to feel a human being still beside him. The younger man didn't seem to mind. While he'd always been one to feel uncomfortable with anyone touching him, he'd never shown signs of displeasure at John's touch; no comments, no swipes, not even disgusted glances. It made him feel privileged and, god damn him, he needed that right now.
Mrs Hudson didn't flinch at his roundabout way of telling her to keep downstairs and cease her fussing about their rooms. “I shall leave supper by the door then?”
“It's just losing my heart. It's a promise. A hope. I can't do it. And neither should you.” John sounded pained at first, but cold and hard like stone towards the end. He shuffled back, away from Sherlock.
John clicked his tongue and sighed again. He walked into the kitchen and began making tea. It was going to be a while and he needed something for the nerves. Either man's nerves. “I don't know how to tell you. You wouldn't believe me if I said anything.”
When Sherlock woke him in the morning, John decided he'd teach Sherlock a move or two to safely operate the knife, discussing strategies and routines with him to work more efficiently together.
“Nobody gives me orders. At least nobody that need concern you. I haven't come to harm; only to help. After a storm like that last, we always come up to seek out survivors. Fortunate I found you when I did. You seemed out cold, like your men. I had nearly given up hope.”
Personally, Sherlock and John thought it wise to stock up on food for themselves and Mrs. Hudson – when hell breaks loose, people panic and horde up all the supermarkets have to offer; best to take precautions. Although, of course, Sherlock still rarely ate, which, as terrible as it may sound, might act up in their favour for what seemed to be lingering in the shadows ahead of them.
Sherlock wanted to smother John with useless affection for his display of honest concern and his willingness to put Sherlock's needs and wishes before his own ego. “You're not the problem, John.” He had aimed for something that would reassure John on more than one level, giving him reason not to pursue the topic any further, but he had failed very obviously.
The red behind his eyelids darkened, a black shadow stealing the sun from beyond them. He expected a crooked grin, a soft scar and a faint fishy smell when he opened his eyes, but what hung immediately above his face was a bag. Small, but larger than a purse. He turned his head to now find the grin instead, remarkably straight, white teeth at the other end of a muscular arm. A drop of water hit his cheek. “What is this?” he asked softly, finding difficulty in focussing on anything other than the ocean inside another man's eyes. It went against all his believes in rationality, but he couldn't help but find himself enchanted by John. His grin was as out of character as they came and yet it was charming in its own way.
I wish everyone a Merry Christmas! Whether you celebrate with our without a family - may you have a lovely time!
He wished he'd never had reason to doubt John. “I don't blame you. I just want you to know that I don't have a problem with it. Not everyone does. Besides, I'm not a perfect man, either, who am I to judge your scars? I've got my own.”
“And you think you denying me this will keep me on the land? Confined to a city that holds nothing but tedium? One day I may retire, but I don't fear not living til such a time.”
“182 years. They are collections of some of the very first theories on chemistry, physics and biology.” Sherlock answered.
“We'll do it in sessions then. Taking steps. It might take longer that way, but it will get you there, right?” Sherlock suggested hastily.
Later that day, however, on television news, there was a report about how all four had died within five hours; how they had woken up again and attacked the hospital staff until they were caught by the police and locked away, the building set under quarantine. The authorities, however, refused to give any information on what was happening.
“He hit me on the head, I couldn't really do much for a moment. It was a very precise hit.” Sherlock replied, calm as ever.
“Yes, that will be all. You may leave.” With his gaze adrift, he never saw her look of exasperation as she ducked out of the room. He didn't have to. Over the years, he had come to know her well enough to expect it. She was, after all, one of the rare women whose spirit challenges expectation. At times, some would call her impertinent for her quipped replies and unwomanly sarcasm. Perhaps she reminded him a little too much of some of the women in his own familial circles.
John could tell from the way his head swayed, that Sherlock must still have been quite dizzy. John's voice lowered into the tone of a petulant child as he flopped onto his back next to his mad friend. “Don't just go jumping after him, then. You knew he was stronger than you.” Sherlock didn't reply. John turned his head to look over at him. “You could have drowned there.”
After they had eaten in the usual silence, John declared he'd take watch for the night. Sherlock needed to sleep, to catch up on many lost nights and they couldn't be sure this building would stay safe over night.
The pistol felt heavy in his hand as he made his way to the stairs. Part of him was conscious that he had left the desk a mess, but that was no longer his problem.
Lifting his hand, he reached out to press his fingers against the doctor's face, but then his hand was caught, lips pressing against it in a kiss, and then the doctor was back with him, momentarily sucking on the soft skin on his wrist before layering kisses down his arm and onto his chest.
His gaze drifted to the cupboard of records, considering and discarding each mental image, until... yes, maybe, something more modern, more
“It’s Zhi Zhu’s turn to serve, while over at the Arthur Ashe Stadium the second set is about to go to a tie break between Dominika Cibulková and Svetlana Kuznetsova, with the unseeded Cibulková having taken the first set seven games to five. It could be all over there shortly.”
"Don't look at me like that," the doctor said, joining him on the sofa. "It’s not my fault you're too tall. Now, a kiss you said."
They ended up in the pub. It was a warm, cosy offering, all dark wooden beams, comfy armchairs and open fire that was as reassuring as it was stereotypical. The name proclaimed it to be The Cock and Fiddle. No doubt a corruption of something lost to the winds of time, but the hanging sign embraced it enough to at least show a cockerel clutching a violin.
Other music: Vera Lynn, who turned 102 in March this year, is widely known as “the Forces’ Sweetheart”, her musical recordings and performances having been enormously popular during the Second World War.
The fingers paused for a moment but then resumed their pressure. "I know," he heard in the quiet. "Sorry. I should have thought. You need to get up now though. Up you get. Your back will thank you tomorrow."
He frowned, eyes darting between the contracts on the table and the doctor's outstretched hand. The doctor didn't move, just waited, expectedly.
The words sunk into his brain and then he was doing just that, he was moving, flexing his legs to rock back and forth against the hard cock within him. The doctor hips met his with every thrust and the words tumbling from the doctor's mouth washed over him in a wave.
Well, cottage really, he corrected as he finally got a look at it from the outside. White walls, slate roof, despite the utter remoteness it had been kept in top condition.
Relaxed and light of step, John returned to the hotel and pondered what exactly to do next. Sherlock was still out, but having some alone time was not a bad thing.
“Holmes gets the last word with that forehand and he takes the set. It’s now one set a piece and everything to play for.”
Sorting through the LPs, he slid one onto the turn sty, and sank into his armchair to watch the dancing flames and get lost in the centuries of his memories.
"My brother..." he started, was in Hong Kong. His uncle was indisposed. His parents were in the Caribbean. His lectures had been cancelled for a week for reasons he hadn’t bothered to pay attention to. He had no friends to speak off. The people in his halls would hardly miss him. And the only professor that really mattered was on sabbatical until the next term.
"His actually," the doctor replied, a green eight added to the growing central pile. "It was one of his things. He found them funny, for some reason."
“Watson punches the air in celebration, acknowledging the crowd, drawing on their support. He knows that unless he does something stupid then this set is his for the taking, and that would take him one step closer to booking himself that all important ticket into the quarter finals.”
They both looked at the screen as Sherlock executed a beautiful forehand that had no chance of being returned. That was it. That was the end of the match.
It was just that he had never really thought he would ever do it. He had never really thought there would be someone he would actually
"Perplexed still further, I returned to my lodgings to ponder my next move. I was now certain that I had correctly identified the culprit of the crimes, but as to the nature of the gentleman, I was struggling to comprehend. It was then, in an unusual move, that I turned to fiction as well as fact, and eventually, and rather reluctantly, concluded that there may well be more things in heaven and on earth than had been dreamt of in my philosophy.
"So you see," he continued, fully in the grip of despair and misery, "there is nothing you can say that would be worse than that which I have already told myself. Disgusted as you no doubt now are on being made fully aware of the nature and character of the man with whom you share these rooms, on the mutual affection we once enjoyed, I ask only that you not inform the Yard of the true reasons as to the end of our acquaintance."
They shared smiles when the rhythm faltered, shared air as a particular movement sent a gasp from one of their mouths to the other, shared saliva and sweat and skin on skin contact, taking their time, taking each other.
For people in the UK, "Hall of the Mountain King" is, for better or worse, probably better known as the Alton Towers theme.
I have, however, always made a point of treating each man as a separate person, never presuming that just because one liked a particular subject or pastime that the next would also.
Tidying away the last of his things, he took a seat on the edge of the bed, took some deep breathes and then waited. He listened as he heard the water pipes start running again - sink rather than shower this time - then quiet, then more water, sink again – shaving probably - then silence. Then the door opening, closing, footsteps across the kitchen into the main room, silence, footsteps - back towards the kitchen - silence, footsteps, silence, then finally steps towards the stairs, a brief hesitation at the bottom, then firm steps - every other stair - slowed to every stair near the top, then finally... finally... a soft knock on the partially open door.
And then John got to watch as Sherlock reached the pinnacle and soared, muscles contracting, holding, shaking. Sherlock coming. Glorious.
The resulting smile distracted him from the way his voice had cracked over the words. The smile was nothing if not absolutely genuine, broad and warm with a healthy dose of surprised pleasure.
He fell silent. Despite the fact that this was the outcome he had been going for - he had already concluded that the doctor would not relinquish the violin for anything less than the very reason he was here in the first place, and highly likely not even for that - he still felt taken back in surprise that the doctor was so readily agreeing. Truly the doctor must be unaware of the origin of the instrument.
Actually, the bottoms he might have seen before, on the one or two occasions when he had ventured downstairs before the doctor had fully readied himself in the morning, but they had always been accompanied by an oversized jumper, so he hadn't taken particular notice.
John turned his head away, because despite the words, he wasn't. For better or for worse, that boy was gone. And he was gone because of John’s selfishness, because the loneliness and the pain and the grief had become too much. He should have waited, had intended on waiting, for the boy to become a man, for time and life to shape him into a more fully form person, but in the end it had become too much.
The day was overcast, the cloud cover heavy, which blocked out any sight of the sun. It also did little for his mood. It did not take much time to realise that he missed the presence of the other man.
Harry was dead then. Probably. At bare minimum he was long gone, but the most likely possibility was that he was dead. Sentiment. The doctor had described himself as a widower when he had moved to their village - although the true gender of his partner had obviously not been known. Mrs Fenchurch, for one, would not have been nearly as sympathetic towards the young doctor had she known that his lost love was a man not a woman.
The doctor's expression was deceptively mild, but if there was one thing Sherlock had learnt over the week it was that when it came to John Watson, the emphasis should always be on the
Flicking the button out, he edged down the zip, but couldn't bring himself to untangle himself from his underwear. Exposing himself seemed too much, too blatant. Unzipping was enough though, and he took the doctor's hand and sank down onto the rug.
The hand was cool when he took it, then his left hand was entwined with the doctor's right, and his right was around the doctor's shoulder, the doctor's left across his lower back. It was nothing more than a standard hold with some gentle sway, but, other than the kiss, it was the closest they had bodily been.
Tentatively, Sherlock raised his hands, pressing his palms against the skin, tracing the contours, across, around, then down, eyes following to the bulge now distorting the line of the doctor’s trousers.
But before that, as gone as he was though, John could only stop and stare, his palm moving to rest over the beautiful beating heart. Twenty years of not having faded beneath the strong beat. The grief, the pain, the fear, nothing compared to having this again.
The "Scottish Fantasy in E-flat minor, Op. 46", is a composition for violin and orchestra by Max Bruch. It is a four-movement fantasy on Scottish folk melodies. Completed in 1880, it was dedicated to the virtuoso violinist Pablo de Sarasate. The same Sarasate that Doyle had Holmes and Watson see play in The Red-Headed League.
"Yet here I am," John said. "I never could understand your particular attachment to this place, you know. It's just so... sad."
"Look, I know what this looks like, but honestly, I just wanted the chance for you to get to know me. And as strange as you might think it is, I wanted to spend time with you. Because I like you. Because I think you're funny, and incredible, and so much more than you believe yourself to be. But you were never going to notice me. Why would you? So I came up with this quite frankly ridiculous plan, because even if you said no, then I still would have had the seven days."
"I haven't heard that in a long time," the doctor said, his voice soft but still startling in its unexpectedness. "That arrangement at least. It was one of my favourites."
I like to think that this Sherlock had a bit of a crush on Freddie Mercury, even if he had no idea what it was. I also like to think that his parents aren’t idiots, are least not about this sort of thing. They would have noticed. Teenagers are not exactly subtle. Sherlock’s parents strike me as the sort of people who would have taken his sexuality in their stride. They would just want him to be happy and safe. I suspect they tried to talk to him a few times, but he was too oblivious to notice.
John startled him when he laid a hand on Sherlock's knee. He hadn't even heard him enter. Looking the blond man up and down, Sherlock knew John did want to talk. “Well?” he said expectantly.
And then it came, the bang. The first sighting of a couple of undead people in Hastings. And people went mad. After having seen how quickly it had seemed to infect the Central European countries, hysteria broke upon the people, families fleeing up north, supermarkets being cleared off food. They were glad they had stocked enough canned food to last for about two years, which was a lot of food, but who knew how quickly this would be handled, if at all.
Sherlock's breath touched his neck a blink before his lips latched onto it, one of his hands joining John's, travelling there by caressing over his chest and stomach. A warmth was coiling in the lower centre of his abdomen. “So weird.”
“Oh, John, there will be plenty of action for the both of us.” Holmes' grin was met with one very levelled one by Watson. He gave in. “Also, I do have a surprise for you.” Holmes raised his hand, in which he had held, for several hours now, two slips of paper. He held them out in the small distance between their bodies and Watson grasped them, studying them intently.
brilliant! I need to see Lestrade right away, will you be coming, John?” he was already beginning to dash about, a new wave of energy flooding his body.
The report ended with a reporter talking to the camera in what looked to be the city of interest, some people running through the crowds in the background.
Sherlock, struck with confusion and disbelief, found himself unable to reply. The strange man turned on his back, his lower body rising to the surface as he floated beside him, gaze directed at the once more blue sky. “And what do you do with the gold you find? Bury it some place else? I don't understand the concept of piracy very well.
Fact, however, was, that they were chasing Efkan Cetin through London by the end of the day, having just surprised him before he'd managed to kill his fourth victim. Unfortunately, the chase ended with John pulling Sherlock out of the Thames, but he'd informed Greg about their killer swimming downstream so they would be catching him along the way.
John had spent the last of the sun rays, and part of the night, contemplating. It was certainly his first time engaging in social interaction with a human. They did not do this on a regular basis. They saved them, when they could, and that was ever the last you would hear. There was a reason for merpeople to have been but a legend told by drunken sailors.
The arrogance in those words still rang through John's head. It had been only a month after he'd got to know Mycroft Holmes and it was now another two months since. It always shocked him how well he'd settled in with Sherlock within just a few weeks and now he felt like there was nothing more natural. It was true that John had shared many flats and even more beds, but nothing had ever felt as easy as his friendship to Sherlock Holmes. Just their first night together had been a right spectacle, with a rush of Adrenalin that had John feel alive for the first time in a long while. Afghanistan had been nice – a suicide mission, but an adventure nonetheless. He'd planned to die there and he nearly had, only when he'd looked that prospect in the eye, he found his desire for death vanish very effectively. If you were “one of his kind” as Mycroft called them, death meant a part of yourself and, with the feeling of eternity on your shoulder, boredom came quick and was not lifted off your being quite that easily.
“So you keep saying, yes.” At that moment, he was no doubt mulling over all our exchanges, my little remarks and those times where I did not think to take care in my choice of words. “Come to think of it, I have not once heard you compliment a woman's appearance in words not cited from another's mouth!”
John remained smiling and alone in the flat. Probably for the best as Mary was rather ill-disposed towards Sherlock at the moment. Really, John couldn't blame her, though he really thought he should be the one getting the beef.
It was crazy how Sherlock had made John go from depressed, disabled, lonely man to confident, adventurous, employed and committed within three months. That's way more than what he could say of Ella. His therapist had gotten him next to nowhere and he was seriously thinking about quitting therapy. He still wasn't back to who he used to be, but he guessed that he'd never get there again anyway, and it was fine. He was fine right where he was.
Between the blood bubbling out from where his broken rip lay and the noises and the smells, John passed out on the way to the hospital. When he woke up again, he was high on painkillers and Sherlock was in his room. In the middle of the night. That wasn't allowed, right.
“The girl was an athlete with a habit of chewing gum. The killer placed the rope inside her mouth for her to hang on to for as long as she could, so he could escape in the meantime and get an alibi for the time of death.”
“We,” Sherlock had his voice slip from his lips, taking in the strong, muscular torso of a man and the sleek, scaled tail of a fish. An artistic example of one, he would admit, but obscure nonetheless. “We share. My crew, we.. share. With our families, the less wealthy. I never saw adventure in taking more and more fortune without any purpose for it. There is no... temptation in something you already have.”
“I got your usual, hope that's okay- what is this?” John stopped as he entered the flat, irritated by a comfortably cushioned sofa, wine glasses, a bottle of red wine and the TV showing a still of a Doctor Who DVD cover.
There, in the middle of the street, was a group of five people, shooting their way over to a grocery store.
happened in those two years, I just know that it couldn't have been a sunny holiday. You... changed.. So did I. In all my life, after war, after everything, I never felt so betrayed like when you stood there in front of me. And I know why. Because I have never trusted a person like I trusted you.” past tense, not good. “For some very strange, very horrible reason, I felt good about your solitary lifestyle. It made me feel powerful, strong, important. You had let me in. Me. No one else. Not like that. And when you.. you know, I lost that. Now, Mary gave me something similar, but never the same. I wasn't
