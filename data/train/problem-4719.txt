She wasn’t kidding around, and the last thing Tony needed was his only friend in town to be angry with him. Fuck fuck fuck. He took another minute to clear his throat, furtively casting around for any man who could plausibly pass for a man whom Tony would be interested in and —
“Marple! What are you doing? Is that—that’s not your ball,” he finally realized, walking to her while raking his mind for anything in the house that was turquoise blue. Her balls were purple and orange, and Tony always favored red and gold for himself, so what could she possibly have found—
He started to pull out farther with each thrust, until he was almost pulling out all the way every time. Tony’s head tipped back in pleasure, keening needfully with every breath. He was still clutching at the couch cushions, but he grabbed on to the cushions behind him and arched up as far as his position allowed. His body was stretched and full in a way he had never felt before, but he was a drowning man thirsting for more: he still needed
The room was absolutely silent around him, and Steve cleared his throat in discomfort. Finally, to avoid stewing in the pitiful silence, he continued talking. “I haven’t actually done this, before.”
My only lingering frustration with Portugal design choices so far is that whole mess of tearing up the stunning cobblestones in Porto's big square and replacing it all with asphalt. ASPHALT. What were you thinking, assholes?
“They say the Great Chief of Old cast the Last Chief out into the Far East,” Clint continued as if Tony hadn’t spoken. “If you help me find her and return her as the rightful Great Chief, I’ll leave the swamp never to return.”
“Buttered biscuits and baked brie,” Steve added, and Tony just moaned with delight. “And a side of homemade apricot jam.”
“You described your mother as a town gossip,” Dr. Odinson spoke over him, “and your father as neglectful of both yourself and his wife.”
“Sure he’s not just doing it while he’s using you?” she pointed out. “You don’t even know who this Steve Rogers is. He could secretly be married to some poor woman raising his children in Sussex, or a fugitive—or, or a tax attorney! And then what will you do?”
Carefully, Steve picked his way through the workshop in the dark until he stood in the open doorway to Tony’s lab. It was the biggest space in the workshop with a door and a lock. Tony had several work benches in his lab, each of which had been dedicated to some unidentifiable step in the robot and AI developing process with which Steve was only conversationally acquainted. On one of the first occasions Tony had showed Steve his lab and introduced him to Dum-E, Steve had realized that standing in the workshop and trying to make sense of the organized chaos was a window into Tony’s mind. The idea should have been cool at best, or overwhelming, but instead it somehow made Steve feel deeply attached to the discarded scraps of metal and homemade tools that cluttered Tony’s lab on a daily basis.
Rhodey smirked, and pushed the big red button to start the clock. “Ten seconds on manual, Tony—don’t fall!”
Steve was still staring at the chest of fucking blankets that so casually seemed to double as a gun rack when Maria gently touched a hand to his elbow. She didn’t say anything, but she give him a meaningful look and gestured at Tony with her head.
With the hole cleared, he dropped the digger back on the ground and walked back to the truck. He leaned far enough into the truck to reach the cooler, and dug out a bottle of water for himself.
“I am so sorry,” he heard Tony apologizing—why was he apologizing! And she was laughing, what was happening? “He is going to be mortified later.”
“What the hell, did you drop it in a campfire?” Tony muttered mostly to himself, put he peered at it for a minute before going for his computer. Steve fiddled with his phone for a while, distracting himself from the way Tony’s button-up stretched across his strong shoulders and his lean back. If he didn’t know any better, he would have guessed a blacksmith before something as sedentary as engineering. He’d bet himself five quid that ass was to die for.
“Mom’s probably going out to get the eggs for breakfast,” Tony guessed, given the time. Then, out of the blue, he popped up with excitement. “Steve! How’d you feel about making those cinnamon buns of yours?”
“Lieutenant Bruce Banner, stand down,” Fury said in a tone that brooked no arguments. “We uphold peace and we continue the order of New Yorseylvania as we always have. That, is how we will live.”
“Aren’t you worried?” Bucky eventually asked. “What if that woman changed her mind and swung back to pick him up?”
Clint’s ears swiveled forward in his excitement, he clomped onwards with newfound energy, further into the unknown depths of the cave. They traveled slowly but steadily, moving through the darkness even while daylight shone above the surface of the cave. It was not until dusk fell and the sun disappeared into the west that they finally emerged on the other end, and found themselves in a world foreign to anything either of them had ever known. Here, the forests were so tall that they could not see where the tops of the trees ended, and they were so wide that even three grown men could not have reached each other’s hands standing around the trunk. Cold, heavy clouds hung low in the air, billowing out between the enormous evergreens so near the earth that sitting on Clint’s back, Tony could have stretched and caught wisps of the corporeal haze in the palm of his hand.
Steve barely had any pride left between his gritted teeth by the time they climbed the four flights to his flat.
Violet refused to peek out from under Steve’s armpit and her tail was tucked firmly between her legs, so clearly scared that in his guilt, Tony forgot they were on TV.
“No formalities necessary in a hospital, madame,” Tony said as calmly as he could despite his skyrocketing heartbeat. He wanted so badly to help, but privately he had feared that he’d do more harm than good by overwhelming patients. Thankfully, however, his guess had been right, and Agneta’s sudden anxieties over propriety were soothed.
As they did every year on the cold, dark winter night midway between the winter solstice and the vernal equinox, the township’s residents gathered to observe the ritual that determined their shared fate in the coming year. The original settlers built their town around the rock and hewed an altar from where the heart and blessings would forever reach its people. As a symbol of the union between the original Celtic settlers and the American Indians who founded Marham, two tall cedar posts flanked the altar and a willow hoop hung suspended from the ceiling directly over the stone altar. The cedar post was painted red and represented the body of First Man and the tribal ancestors of the American Indian tribe. With the willow hoop, these symbols provided a powerful warding against ill will on the cultures and people who lived in Marham.
He looked right at Tony when he spouted the most sincere, kind-hearted, bullshit known to man—he sounded so earnest, too, that Tony nearly believed him! Jane swooned vicariously, then beamed at Tony with a smile to rival the brightest stars.
“What if I want some endorphins now?” he asked, lowering his voice and arching his back just enough to press into Steve’s waiting palms. “Could I take you in bed instead?”
“You mean, do I know enough about you to know you’re a confident reader who doesn’t need a dog to calm your nerves?” Steve asked with a mischievous little smile.
Steve startled awake to the unusual sound of his phone ringing. Even groggy from sleep he recognized that waking up to the sound of his phone ringing was a bad sign, and he groped for his phone in the hopes of answering before it woke Tony up, too.
Steve caught Coulson and Bucky exchanging looks, but try as he might he couldn’t catch their meaning. He tried squinting at them for answers, but when he was ignored on both counts, he found himself too tired to care. Three weeks without a good night’s sleep made a man care less about the world.
“Hey—hey, I’m here, darling. Look at me?” he urged him with gentle words, “you’re not alone, Steve.”
“What’s the plan, after the movie?” Sharon asked in a blatant change of topic. “Are you finally inviting him over for the night?”
Tony blinked at him at first, but soon whatever energy and hope he’d carried with him seeped away. He couldn’t meet Steve’s eyes anymore, and so he looked anywhere but directly at him, finally just frowning at the floor.
“Oh, man. Listen, I really hope he didn’t wake you up for this,” Channing said with an energetic zest and excitement Steve had lost around ten hours ago. “I’ll make it real quick. I’ve loved Captain America since I was a kid, and I love the depth you’re bringing to the guy. You could’ve just made him a kickass hero or something, but man, he’s lonely, he’s lost everything, and listen, it’s tough looking strong and badass but still vulnerable and hurt, and, fucking bravo, man. You’re awesome.”
“Gentle,” he whispered, but Tony barely heard him. At the first smell of his musk, Tony dared to open his eyes, and seeing the gift presented to him, he
Quickly, he straightened up on his knees behind Tony. He meant to distract himself by getting up and moving them somewhere more comfortable, when his eyes caught on the undisturbed streaks of Steve’s come now drying up on Tony’s ass and lower back.
“One more day and we’re free. How are you celebrating?” Tony asked while Steve finished off the seared chicken.
There was Tony, clear as day, in scuffed sneakers and a travel-worn duffle bag dumped on the floor at his feet.
“Then that’s good enough for me,” Steve said, and he climbed out of the car before Jane thought to say anything else.
Tony returned the glass to him, and wet his lips. Telling Steve wouldn’t solve anything; it wasn’t even that important. Better to tell him later, when they were safe in New York and could laugh about it.
Tony nearly dropped the basket of eggs, and Steve grabbed it out of his hands on instinct when Tony turned to stare at his brother in complete disbelief. “Laura?
Logically, he knew this was the tradeoff for not having any stores nearby. He lived in Manhattan; he had a maid service. He didn’t need any of this.
“I’ll be on the couch if you need anything,” was all Tony said before he turned off the lights and left Steve alone in his bed to stew in his regrets.
“Shouldn’t Q be doing this?” Tony finally asked Bucky. “Half this shit is classified, it’s clearly above my paygrade. What bullshit did Bond do that Q won’t work with him?”
“This brings us to the last question, guys,” Chris said with a little pout, and Tony couldn’t resist pouting back.
“No, I’m not, but if you can’t focus, you’re not the boss of anyone either. So get up, Tony, eat lunch. Be back in two hours.”
“Then let me explain it for you,” Hawley drawled. “You have worked very hard to be here, Mr. Rogers. We are all rather impressed with your progress. I would like to see you make similar efforts in your personal relationships,” she finished, with meaning.
Tony’s laughter quieted with a softly inhaled gasp. “Tomorrow,” he murmured, his voice suddenly deep with interest, “we will finish this when I see you, and that noise you just made, tomorrow.”
From the far back, Steve 2.0 Odinson gave them a wink and a big thumbs up. Steve and Bucky muttered ‘got it’ when they meant ‘suck a bag of dicks’ and marched out of the conference room occupied by the FBI before Hammer changed his mind.
“I thought I just said,” Steve said, still valiantly trying to channel cheerful friendliness despite the irritated and unwelcoming looks he was getting.
“I upgraded my phone last month, but that doesn’t feel new anymore,” Tony hummed to himself thoughtfully, looking over at Steve as if Steve’s expression could remind him of what his answer should be.
“CEO sucks. CEO doesn’t get to do the fun shit,” Tony mumbled petulantly into Steve’s shoulder. “I haven’t gotten down to the lab all week, it’s just meetings and paperwork and checking other people’s shit—and it’s good shit, but it’s not
Tony had released Dummy, but the horse was faithfully trailing him as Tony made his way to back porch. When Tony made it around to the table, Steve’s face was already split in a broad smile.
“Whoa, Steve!” a familiar voice said in alarm, and Steve blinked his eyes open just in time to realize he had been inches from knocking heads with Tony. Tony, who was panting and glistening with sweat in his black tank top and Iron Man inspired workout tights. He might have laughed, because Steve could feel his heart lifting for no reason, but he wasn’t conscious of what was happening until he noticed genuine alarm in Tony’s voice.
Across the bar, the young woman leaned into Tony’s personal space to whisper something in his ear. He looked quite pleased with himself, and angled his face to grin at Bruce and Thor over her shoulder when his good humor transformed into confusion. They watched him lean away from the young woman, shake his head with a polite smile, wave to her friends, and then leave.
Steve scoffed in the middle of nuzzling Violet’s forehead as she tried to hide against his cheek. “What a silly little man he is, Violet, don’t you think?” he cooed at her, only audible thanks to the microphone clipped to his shirt. “He is, isn’t he? I wish I spoke French, it is a beautiful language, but nope, he is a silly, silly goose. I only speak English.”
Tony had driven him to his dorm, and on the doorstep to the building, Steve kissed him for the first time. A warm, chaste peck on the lips, and a smile to light up the darkest night sky.
Steve paced the length of his living room, glaring daggers at his phone and daring it to prove him wrong, that he hadn’t just been stood up. He tried to sit down, he tried to relax and forget it, or even pretend that it wasn’t bothering him so that when (if) Tony did show up, he could appear to have been entirely casual and calm about the entire affair.
Tony grunted from his desk, clearly in the middle of something, but he still humored his little robot. “What do you mean, buddy? You miss Steve?”
“Oh yeah, they’re super fast. Giraffes wouldn’t fight lions unless they had to, they would rather run,” Tony first assured Flora. “But you’re right, Harvey, cheetah’s are the fastest animals on the planet. There are a few birds that are faster, but I personally don’t really think that’s fair, because their bones are hollow and cheetah’s have solid bones.”
Tony glanced into paper bag long enough that Steve knew he was thinking. Eight stacks of fresh twenties still in their wrapping from the bank. A genius like Tony didn’t need more than a second to realize he had 16,000 pounds in his hands.
Steve closed his fist around Tony’s hard cock, stroking it absently in wonder. “God, Tony. You’re so close,” Steve whispered, his earlier inclination to stay in character forgotten. He gathered the copious precome slick over the head of Tony’s cock, then removed his hand to leave Tony’s cock untouched and throbbing with need. Tony watched Steve rub his fingers wet with his precome, and while it clearly wasn’t a replacement for lube, that first touch of Steve’s two fingers breaching him and smearing his own precome deep into his ass drove Tony out of his mind.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, you are fined ten credits for a violation of verbal morality statute 1-1-3.”
“Just because it’s unfair doesn’t mean it’s not also unreasonable,” Tony pointed out. “Besides my books, the longest interaction you’ve had with me has been about three homicides. It’s not exactly the classic recipe for ...well, for anything.”
Left to his own devices, Steve dropped his bag at the foot of the bed and took a moment to take stock of his surroundings. Without Tony’s voice, the room was eerily silent. Even on the rare occasion he took holidays, he had only been to cities—to San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago. This was a silence unlike anything he had experienced, a silence that had his skin crawling and his heart racing. For the first time in his life, Steve couldn’t hear the city—not the distant rumble of passing cars, not the drunks stumbling back home late at night, not the K-9 units barreling through alleyways on late-night sweeps.
Pierce’s smile shone like a diamond, which was to say, it didn’t. “Terrific,” he said, his pleasant voice uncomfortably sharp around his perfect, pearly white teeth. “Regretfully, Captain, I must return to work now, but I assure you, I await your reputable company with great composure.”
“Tell me you’ve got lube, Tony,” Steve moaned into Tony’s skin between sloppy, wet kisses. His spit tickling down the long column of Tony’s neck and left Tony arching into Steve’s firm bulk in a full-bodied shudder.
Tony cleaned himself and his floor up, but even then Steve hadn’t replied to any of his messages. He didn’t have his Read receipts turned on, so Tony couldn’t even see if Steve had seen them in the first place, but it didn’t matter. An hour without checking his phone once?
Everything was still right with the world when Steve arrived at his office. Sharon was dutifully waiting for him with his morning latte, the computer turned on, and his work space tidied and prepared for the day how he most preferred.
Clumsy with sleep and struggling against his own covers, Tony tried his best to roll onto his back and toss the covers away to reveal his nude body to his dream come true. Steve bussed his cheek in an expression of gratitude even though Tony had fallen back into a deeper sleep, and slowly he slipped down the length of Tony’s body until he faced his half-hard cock. He nosed at the coarse hair at the base of Tony’s cock, exhaling warm air and encouraging him to grow harder, faster. Without moving away from Tony’s crotch, Steve reached around with his still-dry fingers to scoop up some of the lube trickling out of Tony’s stretched ass so that he could cup and massage his balls again, rolling them in his hand leisurely and lifting them so as Tony instinctively spread his thighs again, Steve could reintroduce the canister to his hole.
His king! If this was my grandfather’s time, they would all be in the dungeon for their blatant disrespect. Were it not an act of treason, Rhodey would have fed me breakfast by force this morning, I am sure of it. As it happens, he was called away before breakfast, so to spite him I requested his favorite order.”
With every malicious word, Stephanie curled further and further into herself, until it was all she could do to run from his cell, with her head in her hands. She found the dragon, and even though it was still the dead of night, she crawled under the wing of her loyal companion.
Tony was still wiping down the hood after making his final adjustments. She was too beautiful for even one oily little fingerprint. His first carte blanche project, a custom built Aston Martin with one of a kind stealth technology, scrambler, and entirely water-proof. Manual transmission, all the bells and whistles. He called her Lucy, because who could resist falling in love with her?
When by luck one day they were both at the heated indoor pool at the same time, Steve made a point to emerge on the same side where Brock and Sharon were toweling off. He lifted himself out of the water with an effortless grace belied by the swelling muscles of his biceps and shoulders. Hot water coursed down over his body, and the sudden contrast to the cool swimming hall air left him perkier even from a distance.
. He could feel Tony moving around him, whispering words of affection and praise as he worked on releasing Steve from his bonds. It began with the scrape and slide of all candles pushed aside, and the soft sizzle Steve heard as their flames were pinched out. The whole process barely took a minute, Tony was never out of reach, and still Steve found such relief and comfort in Tony’s touch when he returned.
“Sorry, Steve,” Tony was mumbling mindlessly as Steve helped him undress. It almost sounded like he was crying. “So, sorry… didn’t mean to hurt you, I love you, Steve.”
“Home with you,” Steve echoed in agreement. That was where he wanted to be, back home where he could sleep in Tony’s arms and they were safe. Steve would never let all they’d built slip from his hands again without a fight, but for now, all Tony said he had to do was sleep. So he settled in, let go, and let sleep carry him home.
Steve felt so terrible about putting Tony in such financial limbo that he insisted on addressing it immediately. Luckily, Tony had already planned to walk Steve back to Chelsea to be sure he wouldn’t hurt himself going home.
Minutes passed before Steve even tried to pull off his softening cock. Tony’s fingers twitched in Steve’s hair but released him without a fight when Steve tried to get to his feet. With a surge of energy Tony didn’t have to spare, he latched onto Steve’s t-shirt and hauled him in for a kiss. Steve went willingly. At the first scrape of Tony’s teeth, Steve parted his lips and submitted to Tony’s deep, eager kiss until Tony was practically sucking the taste of his own come off Steve’s tongue.
Steve paid for a small bouquet of blush pink peonies, and handed it to Tony. “For you, to remember today,” Steve told him, but Tony didn’t seem all that charmed.
Once they had driven far enough that Steve couldn’t see the house, the stable, or the barn, Howard broke the silence. “If you think my son is some cash cow to take advantage of,” he told Steve matter of factly, “you are sorely mistaken.”
“A little at a time, okay?” then the straw was back against his lips. Tony looked really concerned but Steve wouldn’t break it, but he was very gentle with the straw anyway if it made Tony happy. Tony should always be happy. Why wasn’t he smiling again?
Natasha stepped away from the group and without a thread of fear in her voice, she said, “We’re here for Rumlow.”
With a final push of effort, Tony managed to catch up to Steve and his long stride. “Captain Steven G. Rogers, enhance your calm. Were you not listening to me? Only minutes ago I was swearing that I would not allow—”
“I don’t think this is going to work out,” Tony reported bitterly. “I overshot it big time, he’s a millionaire or something.”
Another one attacks! Bruce,” he added emphatically, pausing for dramatic effect and to shovel more pancakes into his mouth. “Nobody should be that good without—magic, or, or professional training, maybe?”
Tony had no intention of teasing him. With his hands firmly planted on Steve’s abdomen, he rode Steve fast and hard, maintaining his viselike grip of Steve’s thick cock through every tight roll or greedy bounce of his hips. No matter how Steve bucked under him, Tony wouldn’t falter, meeting him thrust for thrust until Steve came with a strangled cry, his hips snapping up and his back arching off the mattress.
When she guessed wrong, Tony simply told her she was incorrect and handed the judge a folded note to identify the correct photograph. While Tony wanted the judge to know it wasn’t a trick question, no-one else needed to know any more private details about his client’s personal life.
Steve didn’t have an answer to her question, but the sentiment was loud and clear, and Steve couldn’t resist smiling back at his friend.
How had this become his life? He had a dream job that he was actively sabotaging, a partner whom he admired and was actively misleading - who had now become a potential romantic interest he was lying to about his damn biology - and even with superhuman speed and strength he was still not fast enough to be ready before Tony came to pick him up. How did Tony even do it? All Steve had managed to do was shower.
Brock grabbed the man by his hair and tossed him aside. “Get a life!” he shouted after him, and, terrified, the young man scurried away.
Steve followed Tony’s lead into the apartment building. Tony unlocked the building’s front door with a retinal scan, and engaged the elevator with his palm print.
“Nothing concrete,” Steve admitted as objectively as he could. “The only good news is that from the remaining crime scene evidence and threatening letters, we have a lot of avenues yet to find the people responsible.”
Tony should have laughed and let it slide… except, in his half-asleep state there was a chance Steve wouldn’t remember this conversation by morning. It wasn’t that they were bad at communication—part of the excitement early on had been talking each other through what they wanted, what turned them on, but at least that Tony had experience with in the past. This was different. Never had Tony been allowed into a situation without practice and full information before. This was the first time he was flying blind, and without a chance to practice. These were embarrassing questions and insecurities that Tony wasn’t proud of, but by chance, he’d caught Steve about to fall asleep. With a little luck, Tony could ask his questions without his fiancé being any wiser to these irrational thoughts he couldn’t shake.
“Tony! Tony, wait,” Steve called after him, and fortunately, Tony turned around. “I just, I didn’t want to make it a big deal. I sparred with someone stronger than me and they bruised my side. It’s a first date, it was supposed to be about you. I didn’t want to make it about me. It won’t happen again.”
“Mr. Rogers,” she said when she noticed him, gesturing for him to join them. “Stark, let me introduce one of my top students and an intern on the case, Steve Rogers.”
Tony sniffed softly to himself, ducking his head to hide his face against Steve’s shoulder. Steve did him the courtesy of pretending not to see him blush.
“Captain Steven Grant Rogers, I am the Chief Director of Police Nicholas Fury,” the Chief said in a raised voice that had Tony stepping aside immediately. “We did not thaw you for a family reunion. You should be grateful Lieutenant Tony Stark did a probe on your relations at all. This is about you and Brock Rumlow. You may otherwise know him as Crossbones.”
“Your trust in me is deeply appreciated, Captain Steve,” Tony said then, glancing across to Steve in the hopes of catching his eyes. This time, Steve was looking back at him, and for a moment Tony lost himself wondering what the Captain was thinking. He looked sad.
“I wasn’t strong enough to do chores when I was little. The other kids… anyway, now it feels wrong,” Steve muttered, grabbing a pear off the platter Clint had carried out. He turned it over in his hands, rubbing its unblemished skin to a shine between his thumbs.
“We don’t have to hurry home, you know,” he said, doing his best to keep his voice calm and gentle. He reached for Tony’s hand to hold in his own. “You haven’t seen your friends in seven years, Tony. Don’t feel like you need to rush back because of me.”
“Because you spent two minutes explaining how Barnes did it,” Natasha reminded him, which Tony elected to ignore without acknowledgement.
They leaned into it like nobody’s business. Happy was a natural at bossing people around and making long-winded and painstakingly detailed demands, which gave Steve the freedom to take the backseat. They bonded over boxing and baseball, and by the time he was on his third glass of Grande Cuvée, Happy confided in Steve that he’d been bewitched by Pepper for over a year.
- he had such thick fingers after all, and technology wasn’t his strongest suit. He had meant to buy it for himself, but autofill had charged it to Tony’s credit card and arranged it to be delivered to Tony’s address while Steve was entirely helpless to stop the transaction from going through.
Eventually, Tony choked on air and stumbled forward with awkward, heavy feet until he could finally get his shaking, eager hands on Steve’s oiled up pecs, his pronounced biceps… and then swept his hands down Steve’s broad frame to curl over the lace around Steve’s narrow hips.
“We should do this more often,” Thor decided as he looked around the inviting space he could barely recognize as his own.
Under the great dome lid he found two plates of succulent lamb and rosemary potatoes. The whole presentation was divine, and the smell even better, and for a moment he even considered leaving Tony out of it and eating both servings himself.
Tony sighed inwardly and tried to resist his initial temper at the conversation they never seemed to resolve.
Steve gave him a curious look, though he shook his head to express his confusion. “What do you mean?”
The night before everything changed, Tony came home dragging his exhausted feet. It was mid-October, and as tired and cold as Tony was, he still felt a tingling thrill of excitement fluttering in his stomach when he stepped off the elevator on
“Fuck me, Steve,” Tony begged, bouncing impatiently on the balls of his feet. “No condom, fuck me, fuck me,
“I like the way you think,” Bucky agreed with a big, self-satisfied grin. Just to be more of an ass, he turned to Steve and innocently asked, “Steve, when was the last time you had Italian sausage? 1938?”
“It is getting kinda late,” Rhodey admitted with a yawn, and he sat up with some difficulty to stretch and force himself awake. “What’re people even doing here? There’s work in the morning,” he muttered, eyeing the thirty or so people still lingering in the bar.
Steve wasn’t as lucky. Bucky chewed him up and spat him out for causing such an unnecessary scare. When he hadn’t answered the bathroom door on Bucky’s first, second, or fifth knock, Bucky feared the worst. Stane was still presumed to be alive somewhere, it wasn’t impossible to think he’d retaliate against the king who now sat on his old throne. Bucky’d immediately sent security out looking for Steve while he took it upon himself to become a human battering ram.
“Slowly,” he finally conceded, though he sounded worried, as if he wasn’t sure it was possible. Steve wanted to assure him that he was fine, that he knew now his trust wasn’t misplaced in Tony, but before he had a chance, he was distracted by one well-slicked finger pressing into him again, smearing lube as far as Tony could reach. He heard another condom wrapper being ripped open.
He left Steve in the best hands he could have found. And if Steve was ever to recover enough to continue fighting, any and every coach under the sun would be lining up to work with him. Tony had done what he could: Steve would not want for anything.
“Of course she is! The curse is being broken today,” Tony glowered, gesturing in the general direction of the main homestead of Chief Talia’s tribe. “She’s binding herself to a Chief of her kin. She’ll give her a child.”
In every case, except for his native Cimbri. From his earliest public appearance beside his mother, Steve expressed no reservations about who he was or where he came from. Now, face to face with a young man who shook like a leaf to speak with him, Steve was only grateful that his accent reflected his working class upbringing. An average, unpolished farmer whom the boy could relate to more easily than any king.
“Been thinking of me?” Tony smirked up at Steve, and even as he blushed, Steve rolled his eyes and huffed in amusement.
With a slow, steady pressure, he rolled his thumb over the full crest of Steve’s ass. Steve moaned shamelessly under him until Tony’s thumbs eased down over the slope of his lower back and found the muscles where his ass connected to his lower back. Immediately, Steve winced and tensed up under him. Tony lessened the pressure at once, but it wasn’t in his nature to abandon a problem once he had discovered it. He continued working over the tense muscles, soothing the pain away with slow, gentle circles until Steve’s soft gusts of wincing pain turned into quiet moaning, and the stress of his body melted away under Tony’s hands.
. The tackiest form of communication, and yet Tony felt it all through his body, fluttering in his poor heart and curling his toes.
,” Tony firmly pointed out. “Not that it’s any of your business, but I get plenty of dates on my own.”
“First thing I could I moved ma out to California. She’s… the cold hurts her bones, you know. She’s doing okay; she’d love to see you,” Bucky couldn’t help but add with a smile. “The kids are with her for now. She thinks we’re on vacation, none of them… at least Maya let me have that. I can’t tell her, not like this.”
that spilled from Steve’s breathless lips. He bodily hauled Tony to his feet and in for a kiss, and just as easily the white noise of the world faded away.
Too casually, to Steve’s ears. He watched through the mirror behind the counter as Bucky frowned at the new development, though he clearly couldn’t resist. He peered into the bag, and took a judicious sniff of the gift-wrapped candle.
“The world doesn’t revolve around you, Tony!” Clint called over his shoulder, but Steve barely heard their conversation. He sat up the moment he recognized Tony’s voice, looking for him.
Steve knew better. Raw, unprocessed human hormones were dangerous, the most addictive substance to their species. What was harvested intravenously—the serotonin, the oxytocin, the prolactin—became ingredients for the most powerful and lucrative sources of pain relief in their world. What was collected directly as expelled fluids—or what they sometimes humorously referred to as harvested
“I met him at a dinner event. I was a model and a student, he was this incredible businessman. I was about to start graduate school; I turned down a full ride to MIT because he worked out of LA, and he didn’t want to be on the East Coast,” she said with a sigh. “Too rainy, he said. And I’d say it was all worth it, until about five months ago when he started to behave differently, unpredictably. That was when I found the bottles.”
“I don’t want to be alone,” he said, opening his eyes again. He didn't know Tony that well, but for indescribable reasons he made Steve feel safe.
“Maybe,” the man said with a nervous laugh. “Interview. Just came from another one in Cambridge; I’m trying to stay in research for now, but I also want to stay in London. Sorry, nervous,” he said with a rueful look, “I got here yesterday, I think I’ve had eighteen cups of coffee in twelve hours and I’m not exactly sure what’s going on anymore. I’m Tony.”
The tension in Steve’s posture faded so quickly he nearly melted off his seat, and before Tony noticed the enormous, goofy grin of relief on his face, he hid his expression again by polishing off the last half of his beer.
“Off the clock. Call me a consultant,” Tony said, a touch calmer. “Steve, whoever this is, he’s escalating and you don’t even know his motives. Eight to ten months between each of the first three victims, now four months between the last two? If he hasn’t crossed state lines yet, it’s only a matter of time. You need me.”
A small smile tugged at the corner of Steve’s lips, but he kept his eyes on his work. His amusement would be more convincing if Clint couldn’t look him in the eyes. Fortunately, Clint got up then to check on the cooking food, throwing the hot dog buns on the grill to warm up while the sausages were finishing.
“He’s worth it, I promise,” Tony said with a quiet, distracted sigh as Sharon brought him a cup of tea. She sat down with her own cup while Tony comfortably perched on her desk. “He’s considerate. He admits when he’s wrong, he works on improving.”
It had only been five or six hours since he had filled the sixth canister, but Tony was young enough to recover quickly. Even after the secondary stretch of Steve’s thick fingers, and Steve pulling Tony’s hole open between his thumbs, Tony still winced and mewled in turns of pain and pleasure as Steve sunk deeper and deeper into his body.
He felt his little devil wriggle affectionately against his arm, and Tony lifted his arm to allow her to squeeze in between his body and his arm for pats and lots of praise - but he also couldn’t stop staring at his hero. The man was too distracted by something on the right side of Tony’s face to notice anyway, so Tony indulged, convincing himself that he could blame it on his fall if the man accused him of ogling him when his only crime was being a good samaritan.
“Why did you even keep coffee in the house when I was little?” Tony complained between one delicious cup of coffee and the next. “You knew it would stunt my growth.”
Tony rolled his eyes and gave Natasha an unimpressed side-eye. Couldn’t she at least wait until his drink arrived?
“Professor Hawley, could we speak?” she asked, speaking as if Steve wasn’t shivering in a cold sweat and Professor Hawley didn’t look like a spooked horse. “It is about the case; I have a concern about the—oh, Steve, do you mind?” she said, finally noticing him. “I’d like to speak with the professor in private.”
There was a brief pause on the other line. “Yes,” Steve said in a cautious tone. “Was that not… did you not like them?”
Distantly, he felt Steve’s frenzied thrusts grow more fervent until Steve no longer held back his power, driving into Tony with enough force to rattle the bed frame until finally, buried deep in Tony's raw, aching ass, Steve filled him with his come. Steve didn't stop fucking him, pumping his come deeper into Tony, soothing the last lingering trace of emptiness within him. High in his afterglow, Tony's grasp of consciousness began to fade, and the last thing he felt before the world turned to blissful sleep was the touch of Steve’s lips brushing against his ear with a whispered promise of love.
One after another, Tony picked his way through every alternative, while asking Steve the same unreasonable questions nobody could answer honestly.
“It’s only six o’clock,” Bucky pointed out, when across from them Sam covered his mic long enough to innocently wonder, “Let me guess, Steve and his magic dick still away for business?”
“I got the city reconnected to the power grid. They have power, they have heat. We already have more water than necessary for washing and for consumption. Resources are well met, and the citizens of Lumine have been… Steve, they are bringing food,” Tony said with a tremble in his voice, but this time he spoke with a smile, moved to tears with relief and gladness. “They will not stop bringing food, and books, and blankets. Families are visiting survivors, but those who have no families are being visited by locals. I want to stay,” Tony told him, before Steve had even had a chance to argue that they retire somewhere to rest and recover before rejoining the recovery efforts in the morning. “The people showed me something I did not know. The locals are making survivors feel less alone. They sit and speak with strangers about their families, their loved ones, and it is helping them. It is the least I can do.”
Tony stared at him in open shock, but he couldn’t seem to move. “What does that mean?” he finally asked, only loud enough to be heard in the silence between them.
Steve snickered and shook his head slowly. “Don't you wish? In fact,” he gladly pointed out, “Ms. Potts was happy to vent about how
“Tony!” he hissed, getting a hand up at the last second to brace their impact before the ledge of the workstation dug into Tony’s back.
Steve grinned, bright enough to warm Tony down to his bones. “Tony, that’s the best idea I’ve heard all day.”
cherished. Already he couldn’t wait for Tony to come back to New York so Steve could show him exactly how happy the surprise had made him.
Sure, Tony was infuriating, stubborn, and borderline compulsive in his spending habits. There was a chance Steve had taken a few too many to the head, or maybe Stockholm’s Syndrome was more endemic than he once thought, but Steve didn’t love Tony despite those flaws - those flaws were part of his charm.
Steve startled on the couch and, for just a moment, wondered if he had heard a voice or if it had been his imagination. With a shrug, he flipped his notebook shut, tucked it under some pillows, then went to go check the door.
“I’ll take my chances.” Tony pushed his shades back into place and skipped up the stairs to the Shake Shack. It had already been a long day, and he deserved a damn milkshake.
“I’ll help you, uncle,” Lila promised even though her rope of dough was only marginally better than Rhodey’s.
Steve was still staring at Tony in awe when he heard the Governor speak up in his deep, soothing voice. “I must concur with the silver class officer,” Pierce intoned with a kindness that struck Steve as scripted. “Steven Rogers, could you perhaps share with us your first impressions of our serene New Yorseylvania, 2164? I only hope the unusual circumstances of your early probation has not interrupted the tranquility you carried with you from the Cryo-Prison system.”
Tony was laughing or possibly crying against Steve’s chest as they stumbled through the scattered mid-morning crowd, and while Steve held him close to his side with one arm, he also turned to wave goodbye to his fellow Hufflepuff as the train rolled by.
“Mr. Rogers’ office,” she greeted politely enough, then sat up with interest. “Hi Louise; sure, I’ll let him know.”
There weren’t many pets like Tony in the crowd, but he could see some. They were easily identified them by the similar robe, buttoned at the back, but none of them were recognizably human, and they weren’t all off-leash like he was.
“Sir, yessir,” Steve growled back, panting softly for catching his breath. He pressed closer eagerly to reach Tony’s lips again, but Tony’s grip of his hair held firm with the faintest distance between them. Steve mewled irritably under his breath, but since he couldn’t reach his prize with his lips, he swept his tongue over Tony’s lips for an obscene, indulgent taste.
“Brock told me all about you,” Sharon told him with a smirk that barely concealed her haughty disdain. “You and your pictures are famous at our club, but he didn’t tell me you’d be here. I guess your pictures aren’t the only things going around.”
As the young man under his hands started to rub off against the blankets in earnest, the rhythmic grinding of his hips better revealed his balls to Steve’s reach. Without letting go of his ass, Steve shifted his attention down further, first caressing Tony’s balls with his lubed fingertips, until his hips stilled enough and pushed back down to press his drawn-up sac into Steve’s waiting palm. Steve pressed back with just as much interest, rolling Tony's balls in his hands and massaging them with increasing pressure until Tony was practically drooling and panting into his pillows. With years of practice under his belt, Steve urged Tony up a little on his knees--just enough to reveal his fully hard cock as it hang heavy between his thighs, leaking from the tip.
Even on his shittiest day, Steve couldn’t look at that ring and imagine himself admitting to Tony that he
, Steve wanted to say, but this wasn’t the time. Even he could not be so selfish to make this moment about his own feelings and pining infatuation. However Steve felt about it, he recognized as a friend that what had happened between Tony and Channing had meant something to Tony, and that he was sad to be without it.
Tony agreed before she got too insistent, and quickly gestured for Steve to follow. He led their way to the kitchen, but rather than lingering and talking to anyone, he told his mom they’d eat in the bedroom, excusing them as quickly as he could.
“Why did you do that, I can’t believe you did—” Tony was sobbing into his shoulder in peals of breathless laughter as they stumbled along towards the exit on four legs that threatened to tangle together with every step. But instead of releasing Tony and letting them walk like grown, adult men, Steve only squeezed Tony closer and snickered shamelessly against his temple while Tony continued to deal with his momentary shock of incredulity.
It took him too long to realize that the vice grip Steve had on him was not to randomly humiliate him in the crowd, but to present him to Tony’s first customer, with his legs held wide apart so his hard, dripping cock curved up defiantly under his robe, inches from the creature’s face.
They were standing in the entryway of Tony’s living room. It was not large, but it was plenty for one, and to the right, there was even a small dining area leading to a kitchen. All of the furniture in the living room, the dining room, and what of the kitchen that Steve could see from the doorway, was a compulsive man’s nostalgic ode to 60’s diners that never existed in the 60’s. Posters set in glossy white frames hung in the living room to commemorate Carl Sagan’s
“Sitwell, I am here to tell you your attitude is tiresome. Frankly, I’m relieved to say I have to let you go,” Steve replied, a fact relayed as plainly and effortlessly as if he had said the sky was blue, the earth was round, or pointed out how Sitwell’s decorative compass pointed due Ego rather than due Class.
There was no escape, not from her. Never from her. He loved her too much. How could he not? She was the perfect lady, devoted and graceful, and kinder than the day was long. On lazy mornings like this, she woke him up by squeezing in close to his side of the bed and wiggling with all her might, waiting until Tony cracked his eyes open.
Steve leaned after him, chasing those sinful lips he’d never before dared to dream he could touch. But Tony pulled back, not far, but enough that Steve couldn’t reach him. It took Steve a moment to recover and realize that his body was getting ahead of his tongue.
For the first time, Steve realized Tony stood in front of him without his armor—unguarded and wildly hopeful.
“I’m so proud of you, Tony,” Steve smiled when he saw that his fingers came away without any traces of bleeding, and he pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s sweaty, panting chest. “You’ll sleep so good for me now, won’t you?”
“Dispatcher: all nearby units, ProtecServe Madison and 57th,” Fury told the weeping man behind the service desk. “Officers, pull yourselves together! There is nothing to fear now. The heinous criminal will be back in the ice and a forgotten memory by the time you’re home to supper with your families.”
- for Tony to simply close his eyes and imagine his Steve. His Steve’s hand skimming over Tony’s inner thigh, his Steve’s strong, dexterous fingers opening Tony up with tender, attentive care of a most devoted lover until Tony was nothing but a sobbing feast to plunder.
The concierge arranged for a cab to take them somewhere well recommended, not that either of them had been there before. All Tony had asked for was a place with good food and a nice view of the city.
“We could just let him get away with it,” Steve offered while peering up at the endless criss-cross of stairs climbing into nowhere.
“No! No blowjobs while driving,” Steve said in his strictest tone of voice, the one that sent rippling sparks of electricity down Tony’s spine and fanned the fire Steve ironically had no intention of addressing in this moment. “No blowjobs, no handjobs, no sex of any kind. Are we clear?”
Steve paused in the act of stirring the frosting, and sure enough, he could just make out the familiar tune of his ringtone. He excused himself quickly to the living room where he’d been staring at all the Stark family photos not that long ago.
They looked at him like he was a stranger off the streets who’d invited himself to a space intended for those special few who knew better.
“Alright, alright, no need to get nasty, Romanov,” Sam muttered, but he folded in a heartbeat. “So what’re you after, man? You wanna know the spots he’s been wanting to try, or just the food he loves so you can get some good reservations?”
“I’m… I am busy today, meetings; I cannot,” Tony mumbled, partly to himself. He turned his body towards Steve and immediately sagged into Steve’s side, nosing into Steve’s throat. Almost any other circumstance, and Steve’s heart would have melted with affection. But Tony hadn’t meant to lean into him, he simply wasn’t able to hold himself up. Steve did his best to temper his concern by wrapping his arms around his husband and nuzzling his hair. A part of him wanted to be frustrated and angry, but Tony so unexpectedly frail made it very easy for Steve to remember what really mattered.
Steve nodded slowly as he processed that information, finding himself surprised that he didn’t have to fake being impressed by someone. “How will you prove that you can write for women?”
With a gasp, Steve arched off the bed and, without thinking, brought his hands up to fist Tony’s hair in his surprise. Tony whimpered around his mouthful at the sudden sting of pain, and immediately let go of Steve’s nipple.
Tony made his way to Steve and wrapped his arms around him with a smile. “You genuinely adore that trinket.”
“I told you to go for the 5s and 6s! You had to go for a 9,” she reminded him, because really, that was essentially the whole argument she’d made yesterday. “Will you see him again?”
“Damn,” Tony breathed softly, moaning quietly to himself. Steve didn’t need to imagine what he looked like, making such a noise, or what he might be doing for himself. He knew exactly what it was, he only had to close his eyes and remember. “Never. Never would’ve guessed that, babe, but fuck that sounds hot. Maybe… maybe someday?”
Before he could think of a diplomatic way to raise the suggestion, however, Tony’s little group was already swarming him with questions.
“Can we not be one of them?” Steve dared to ask, but he’d been so quiet - or maybe caught Tony so off-guard - that Tony picked his head up to look at him. “We’ve already made it past fifty hours. Why not see if we can do this for fifty days?”
His question was rhetorical, but Jane erred on the side of polite manners and shook her head. “No, Tony Stark. Was it exciting, sir?”
“You should hold it from the corner,” a stranger’s voice said from Tony’s other side, and they both turned to see a woman no older than them smiling back. “Hey, sorry,” she said, “couldn’t help but overhear. I ate that last time I was here and I thought the same thing, but it’s really great. It’s easier than you’d expect.”
“You come into my house, and you say ‘who?’” Steve growled into his hair with feigned anger thundering in every word. “We respect Tolkien in this house, you weasel—”
Tony thought he knew what that meant, and whatever it was deserved a frown. It deserved to be ignored, pushed away, and told to fuck off.
Sure it was disgusting, and maybe his sense of smell was more about guesswork than it was five years ago, but at least he was free. At least he was alone. At least he was safe. Between the natural stench of his swamp and the coming storm, he could sleep tonight without worrying whether this would be the night when the Women found him.
“What happened, Tony?” he glowered, circling his arms around Tony and helping guide him to the nearest couch. “Who did this to you? Do we need to—”
“I wish you allowed my security to concern themselves of my safety,” Tony sighed, expressing his frustration more than a rebuttal.
In his new-found spare time, Steve reached out to the small but reliable group of seedy contacts he had. He needed to learn the most efficient way to harvest Tony’s hormones, pheromones, and bodily fluids, but also, perhaps most importantly, where to sell it.
Tony fought back the rising panic and turned to face away from the crowd. The other side of the room was empty, and he tried to ignore the inevitable as long as he could, and focused instead on the familiar touch of Steve’s large paw combing through his hair. He took comfort in knowing he wasn’t abandoned to the other masters or to these strangers like he had feared before. Steve seemed to have learned his lesson and was sticking to his word. Whatever else happened, Tony had to believe Steve needed him, too.
Then, all at once, Tony straightened in his excitement and his face split with a victorious grin. “Got it! You’re in, here,” he said and turned the computer to Steve.
The question must have caught Steve off-guard, because it seemed to leave him stumped, if only for a beat. He reached for his necklace out of habit, worrying the gold band absently between his fingers as he thought about his answer.
“Power!” Steve shouted at such a loud volume that Tony startled into silence. The morality box buzzed as it fined Steve three credits for excessive aggression in the workplace.
Tony tried his best to keep a straight face, but Steve caught a flash of his grin before Tony could hide it behind a mouthful of food.
Steve melted just a little bit, but his smile was as brilliant and warm as sunshine. Tony could feel his own cold, sheltered heart thaw with happiness.
“I’m regretting so many life decisions right now,” Tony said with an exaggerated sigh as he finally pulled up in the right driveway, sliding in next to Steve’s bike.
He shouted Steve’s name in a strangled voice as his second orgasm rocked through him like a freight train, and in the delirious throes of ecstasy, he lost consciousness and blacked out.
“Listen. I don't know what's brought on this midlife crisis or whatever it is you're experiencing right now, but I’ll humor you for twenty seconds. You are one of the sassiest, most ridiculous people I've ever met,” Tony told him in a calm, patient tone that wouldn’t take no for an answer. “Eleven years in telenovelas, Steve. That’s a serious bar of ‘ridiculous’ you’ve surpassed, with flying, face-palming colors.”
Who do you think you are, Sting? That sounds painful, Steve. Fifteen minutes, tops, and you’re not exactly in your prime—”
Steve jumped in before Bucky made a grab for Tony’s face. With a grunt of effort, he shoved Bucky a safer distance from the table. “Mr. Stark, this is the third victim found in seven days. Each of their bodies were posed—”
He could have given chase. He would have caught them, too, and probably rounded up a handful of the thieves. But for what? Instead, he turned to watch them all scatter into the night. They hadn’t laid a hand on anyone but him, they had not attacked or stole anything except the delivery truck of food.
“It really comes across, your relationship works great for the movie,” Carl agreed with a smile of excitement. “We really get this sense of tension and rivalry between them through your reactions.”
? Have you heard of it?” Graham prompted next while Miriam was patting Tony’s knee and saying she was sure he was delightful even if she didn’t like his movie. “Very famous for its dancing; it was a global sensation.”
“You know, I’m staying in a hotel suite,” Tony whispered while he watched Steve pick his way through the debris moving boxes here and there to open up the floor. “It overlooks Central Park. King bed. Turn down service, breakfast—”
Between one heartbeat and the next, Tony felt his lovesick heart give way to cold sweat. He couldn’t afford to fuck this friendship and partnership up, not even for sex with Steve.
Steve’s breath caught in his throat in his shock. It was one thing to have a partner who wanted to know your fantasies, or thought they were a turn on… but someone who would consider bringing it to life?
Tony started slow, fingering himself open while absently stroking his cock, just enough to really enjoy himself as he worked two, then three fingers into his ass. Deliberately, he scissored his fingers at the rim of his hole, stretching himself open until he had to reach back with both hands to really get a display how eager, how ready his ass was for the taking. He turned his head to watch, catching his own eye in his reflection before concentrating on lining up with the slick, waiting dildo.
Then again, nothing looked like it might break if he sat in it either, and for that he was grateful.
Steve concentrated only on the tip, turning the wet, warm suction of his mouth into a precise and dedicated pressure that left Tony sobbing with the need to thrust up into his mouth for more gratification, more friction. Steve anchored Tony’s hips firmly on the couch with one hand, where he massaged the base of Tony’s cock with his lube-slick fingers, even stroking slow, firm lines along the thick vein at the underside of his cock to help stave off the inevitable.
What, what was this—were they pranking him? Was he being punked? Goddamnit, this better not be Punk’d, he was too naked to be on camera.
Wedding bells. Crying and applauding family, children laughing. Clinking glasses demanding they kiss over and over again. The flutter of wings as doves are released in celebration of their love—
Bruce stopped talking when Thor and Tony glanced at him as one, and if he didn’t already regret his words, Tony’s look of alarm and Thor’s guilt really made him wish a hole would open up at his feet and swallow him whole.
Fury’s expression twitched, but he said nothing. Hill, on the other hand, spoke without compunction.
“I have two guest rooms,” Steve chimed in, but it was Pepper who smiled at him first and agreed that that would be a great idea. His lips curled up in a stilted smile in return, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. It wasn’t like he’d said it for her.
Steve lifted his head and started to pay attention once a real concrete plan started to be explained. Nobody had yet explained why a police uniform, and especially one so formal and well made as the one he had been given, was unsuited for Taco Bell.
ngghhhhh that video of cap at the concert with tony’s mom learning how to dance got me fucking pregnant
Tony rolled his eyes and turned his scotch to avoid the giant ice cube. Jane only needed him to grunt and hum at the appropriate times to get this whole lovey-dovey tale out of her system, neither of which required much attention. So Tony played along while mulling over the latest test results. Dum-E was learning, but he struggled with passive observational learning, so if Tony could only—
Steve nudged his forehead against Tony’s with the biggest puppy-dog eyes. “That’s not fair,” he pouted playfully, “I’m not always away.”
No-one was going to take from Steve what he had worked so hard to achieve - not Brock, not Sharon, and certainly not those unscrupulous assholes who didn’t care if he heard them negotiating bets on how long Steve would last at Harvard with and without spreading his legs. He’d show them; he’d show all of them.
Driving off with the van would only show his hand and Steve would be no closer to capturing Scorpius. Instead, he reached into the soft innards of each ‘clock’ and tagged each of the with a tracker.
Steve grimaced and finished the last of his pint. It may have been his fifth or sixth drink, he wasn’t so sure. “Tell them to fuck off,” he told her with a quiet sniff. “Leave me alone.”
His questions were innocent and vague enough, but Tony caught a spark of hopeful curiosity in his expression that made it very clear what (whom) Stephen was thinking about.
When they reluctantly slipped apart for breath, Tony licked his lips and glanced at the clock on the wall. “Patrick?” he wondered, and Steve shook his head.
“It’s old-school sexism,” Steve agreed without beating around the bush. “He thinks women go crazy for jewelry, but men, I don’t know, prefer cars and boats and power tools. But it stayed with me anyway, and I thought it wouldn’t hurt to look… then I learned that there were palaces for sale in the same price range as the rings I was looking at, and
“I was recovering from the concussion and you still made it the best birthday I’ve ever had,” Steve told him with a fond smile. He opened his mouth to continue, but like they had every day that week when he came home with flowers, Steve’s words failed him.
“What—wait, Tony,” Pepper cried, throwing the door open further so she could use her hands to adequately express how frustrating such a last minute request was. “Why! Tony, we’re talking about foreign investors who—”
Howard was the first to leave the house for a meeting out in the City that would keep him all day. Maria volunteered to join him, deciding that she had spent far too many days cooped up on the ranch without other women.
“Tony, see what else you can get from Preston’s computer,” Steve said since the silence spoke of their shared agreement (or lack of alternative plans). “Sam, Buck: first thing tomorrow, get a warrant for GayArrangement’s membership data, then go talk to Preston’s parents. See if you can learn anything about his past relationships. Nat and I’ll visit Preston’s university friends and his roommate again, see if we they’ve got anything to say about past relationships and, I don’t know—money, gifts, fancy clothes —whatever else sugar daddies do.”
“I acknowledge your rational intervention, Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” Fury replied in a way that made it very clear how he felt about being interrupted multiple times. “I will also acknowledge the Captain’s advice when his suggestions are conceivable. Yet this alarmist disquietude is repulsive. The only place to even view firearms designed by any fashion of his imagination is at a museum.”
“Listen, Steve. I know what I said… it’s a lot to accept. If you want to keep this, whatever this is between us strictly to the case, I understand. I mean it,” he added more emphatically, in case Steve hadn’t believed him the first time.
If he stared at the page long enough, the words stopped having meaning and just turned into cock soup. Here a cock, there a cock, everywhere you look there was cock. Having a crisis over cocks was not appropriate for a Tuesday mid-afternoon at the library, not by any stretch of the imagination. All around him students were working on perfectly reasonable activities, like typing up term papers, or making notecards.
Sometimes they met up at Tony’s place, a one-bedroom in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It was smaller and noisier than Steve’s place, but Steve secretly coveted those mornings when he would wake up in Tony’s bed, surrounded by the spicy, clean scent that was so quintessentially Tony. He never felt as lazy or as spoiled as he did those mornings, watching Tony puttering around his kitchen in the nude through the French doors.
There was definitely a part of Steve that wanted to say, ‘you’re looking at her email right now, how hard is it to press
“Alright! Okay, Jesus, they’re special flowers,” Pepper finally conceded loudly before Tony’s insane ramble carried on too long. “Fine, I’ll, I’ll see what I can do. Can you be ready at 6:30?”
Brock’s face fell. Only then did it occur to Steve that this wasn’t going how Brock had planned it, meaning that
“Is it true you modelled?” she eventually asked. Steve couldn’t help but smile at the curiosity in her tone; clearly, she’d been wanting to ask him for a while.
Steve couldn’t move, he couldn’t find his words. For the people of Consone who looked into the sky, they would see their king coming to their defense. They would know they were not alone. Their enemies would never know if five jets followed the king or five hundred, but even alone the king would fight, and vengeance followed in his wake.
“Yes, sir. Yes, of course,” Steve agreed and started to retreat at once. “Thank you, sir—I’ll get it done immediately; today, in fact.”
Steve refused to look at him, hunched in on himself and staring directly ahead over the steering wheel. Then, with a sudden jerk of the wheel, he swerved away from Tony and sped up, but Tony had had enough practice with steer not to be thrown. Dummy was tiring, but Tony urged him on, and god, just another two inches and he could reach the truck bed.
Carol turned and gave Tony the seething look that promised him he’d be thrown over the balcony into the pool in a heartbeat if he didn’t stop. Tony was intelligent enough to take the hint. He shut his mouth, cleared his throat, and smiled down into his cup of coffee.
“Are you making struffoli?” Bucky asked as soon as Steve brought the wrapped up ball out of the fridge.
As if seventeen pounds would change Steve’s answer. As if he hadn’t already adjusted his own weight training to anticipate a partner in his own weight-range.
He turned off the highway, and Tony watched Steve thoughtfully as he maneuver through the narrow roads bordering the national park. It sounded like Steve was struggling to apologize, and since he was distracted enough by the driving, Tony took the time to think about his own feelings. Yes, he was upset, and yes, he felt betrayed these past six weeks, but was it enough to push Steve away before he could explain himself?
“Not really,” Clint agreed, and if he was going to say something else, he was distracted by the dogs collected at Steve’s feet. It must have been easy to spot Steve’s discomfort, so Clint absently promised to take care of them for him as he stepped away, whistling for the dogs’ attention and leading them away with promises of bones.
“Access denied,” the computer cheerfully replied. “Silver class personnel not authorized to review rehabilitation assignations.”
Tony blinked at Carl slowly, because something wasn’t adding up. Either his brain was short circuiting so late in the day, or Carl was not listening. Experience told him the latter was far more likely. Sure, the late afternoon interviews were a little worse after the compounded casual lunch-time and after-lunch drinking, but this was only their first day of promotions. It was only downhill from here.
But instead of reaching to give Tony a hand, Tony watched through the mirror as Steve only repositioned his hand around Tony’s ankle to push his legs further apart until Tony whimpered and sobbed at the stinging tension. Through the mirror, Tony could see how this new position exposed his cock and balls only to better highlight their intentional neglect. Shame burned through him to see the lewd bounce of his hard, leaking cock and his drawn up balls, but he still couldn’t bring himself to look away.
All at once, the fight died in Steve’s chest. Blood drained from his face, and he stared at Tony’s hurt, angry expression in shock.
Steve tried to laugh it off for him. “Yeah, I’m fine, it’s fine. I’d be more worried if I was that horrible woman who made me look bad in front of the professor. But,” he said with a brighter smile and perkier tone. “You’re here now, that’s what matters. How was your summer?”
Tony followed him obediently, but he glanced around him with concern, keeping close to Steve as if trusting that Steve wouldn’t let him get hurt. After all, even on a different planet people understood the value of an investment.
“He must have a great respect for you to be so bold,” Steve whispered in a voice so soft only Tony would hear it. “If you only knew how happy that makes me, mein Schafes.”
Clint coughed and tossed his head, repulsed by the taste of whatever Stephanie was pushing on him. “What—that was liquid shit! Why did you give me—oh, gods, you sure it wasn’t poison?” he asked in the end, a little more seriously.
Steve blinked bleary eyes open at Maria’s barely-concealed rage. He made a questioning sound and picked up the paper to see what she meant.
What was Steve and what was Steve’s belt buckle was increasingly obvious, and Tony reached down between them to cup and squeeze Steve’s erection through his dress pants.
But it wasn’t until the night when Steve sent Sam home early and entered Tony’s room with six canisters that his life fell apart. He had planned to stay with Tony all night, to harvest slowly and see if the impossible was possible.
“I fucking would be,” a voice behind them commented with a huff. A chill ran down Steve’s body from a long-repressed memory he really didn’t need to be reminded of; before he could snap out of it, Tony had whirled around in his seat and snarled at whoever had addressed them.
“The irony is, I couldn’t really run in Atlanta. I don’t know how they got that picture of me, I got maybe a dozen uphill sprints a day and I was done. That’s a five minute window. You see, we don’t have ‘weather’ in LA. Once you’ve lived there too long, you forget what humidity even feels like. And Georgia doesn’t mess around, their humidity is something to fear. Actually, funny story. Uphill sprints are fine for a workout, but it doesn’t clear my mind like running does. So while we were there, I got a membership to this pilates studio. Usually, I could only go to those random mid-afternoon classes when they didn’t need me on set. Except, it turns out those mid-day classes were designed for… well, the more mature demographic. I called it ‘pilates for the elderly and me.’ But there were these three beautiful, fun-loving ladies who’d come to every class; they’d lived in Atlanta their whole lives, known each other since middle school, the Nixon era, something like that. And they, they took me in. They’re my Atlanta family now.”
Tony laughed, an affectionate, giggling laughter that warmed Steve in a way his duvet and quilt never could. “Are the Canadians at least more polite?”
Tony stared at the man in silence for another beat before turning back to his colleagues. “I hate to say it, but up until the public urination, that’s the best plan we’ve got so far.”
“You’re alright, angel,” Tony cooed at her, rubbing her flank and pulling her close to kiss her brow. To hell with Mr. Perfect; impressing fleeting eye-candy wasn’t half as important as reassuring his little girl that she was loved and forgiven. “That’s my good girl, Marple, such a good girl.”
“Brock Rumlow,” Tony read quietly to himself as Fury marched over to his terminal to verify that it was, in fact, saying the same thing that was being projected onto the wall.
“Stay with him!” he shouted back to Tony, gesturing at the old man as he passed him. Steve continued after Rumlow alone, rounding a low, decorative hedge in the shape of tulips Rumlow had dashed through, but that bastard was nowhere to be seen. Steve spun every direction, peering after the man and listening carefully in an effort to find the cadence of his sprinting feet, but Rumlow had well and truly gone up in smoke.
“Condom?” Steve asked as he got to his feet behind Tony. Tony glanced over his shoulder at the question, but his gaze caught on the obscene tent in Steve’s kilt where his cock proudly jutted from his body, lifting the heavy folds of wool.
His mind made, Steve marched the whole way to the campus store. This time the appreciative glances and amazed stares did nothing for him - he barely even noticed anyone looking at him as he pushed his cart down the aisles, filling it with notecards, a tablet, and a laptop computer.
“That’s ten miles of marching and the Army fitness test, on top of weapons assembly, which already—”
“Do you want me to sketch out some of Dum-E’s skills?” Steve asked, already reaching for his tablet to get started.
“Sorry, Steve,” Brock said quietly, and Steve left him his preferred double chocolate muffin on the table for him before he gathered his basket, mumbled a goodbye to the group, and left, completely deflated.
Ever since Tony’s inauguration and their move into the White House, any time Tony returned home later than expected, ‘Tony, is that you?’ was a question of genuine concern, demanding fate to let his husband come home. It wasn’t blatant, and maybe to others he still sounded happy and curious, but to someone who knew Steve so well, the fear was palpable. The fear that one day the answer to ‘Tony, is that you?’ would be an apologetic Secret Service Agent delivering a grateful nation’s condolences.
Steve and Tony looked up in question and found a young man in brown trousers and rainbow suspenders standing in the doorway. The young man visibly steeled himself and walked in to greet them.
,” Tony growled with feeling, smacking the last pillow in his hand harder than necessary before helping Steve sit up again so he could tuck it between Steve’s back and the arm rest.
The brothers stood in the foyer, too shocked to move. Finally, Clint turned to Tony and quietly asked, “You think Reverend Stanley will be addressing the questions to you, or to her?”
“No, Tony, I don’t think—no, I can’t lie like that, Tony. Makes me feel... squirmy? No, I’m, I’m good, it’s not for me.”
When they parted for breath, Steve could still feel Tony mouth against his, his lips curled up in a smile.
“And you know for a fact that something needs to be revealed? He has no right to privacy ...because he’s rich? That’s pretty thin, Stark. Even for you.”
“Where the hell is Q?” Steve snapped at the nearest menial grunt trying to placate him. “He can’t avoid me forever. You,” he said, viciously pointing a finger at the nearest poor soul trying to address the problem nobody seemed to grasp. “Get me Q. There are eight live bombs in the fucking city.”
“What? No, Thor, I do not require a rescue!” Tony whispered into his phone, “why would you say that?”
At least, he didn’t notice until some seconds later, when Steve smoothly changed his hands so Tony was thrusting up into his lubed hand. Then, Steve slid his clean hand under Tony’s lower back and hefted him further up against the couch. The new position eased Tony into a deeper backbend, with his head tipping back off the couch. It became more difficult for Tony to thrust up into Steve’s wet hand, but before he could groan in frustration and voice his demand that Steve continue what he started, Steve bent down to brace one of Tony’s knees over his shoulder before kneeling up on the couch himself, looming over Tony and nearly bending him in half until Tony’s raised knee pushed against his own shoulder.
Steve turned to look at him at that, hesitant but amused. “The P-word,” he whispered in clear surprise.
Watching Tony interacting with the children made Steve’s heart skip a beat, and he didn’t want it to end. Maybe Steve should practice self-restraint and suggest they merge their groups so that he could ask Tony if he ever considered becoming a parent. After all, just because he was good with kids didn’t mean he wanted to be a dad.
“Yes!” the man beside her cried in morbid excitement. “Share with us the gorey insights of living in a sick, decaying pit of suffering and interracial hate.”
Tony opened his mouth to speak, but found he couldn’t decide on what to say. He liked too much of what was so naturally coming together between them, and the more he allowed himself to consider the possibilities of uniting their kingdoms under a shared rule, the more he found he preferred it to the shortcomings present.
Despite the initial competitive flare that Tony had goaded him into, Steve quickly learned to divide his time between trying to throw Tony into the cushioned ring, and choreographing his own new favorite memories.
Steve felt Tony’s smile grow into a quiet laugh against his throat, and he shuddered at the tickle of Tony’s warm breath.
“Incontrovertible. Look it up in the dictionary. Now, listen to me carefully, Jasper,” Steve told him with a cold, quiet professionalism that had even Sharon closing her eyes with a shudder. “I’m firing you because you are incompetent, entitled, and lazy. If you spent half as much energy on your work as you do cheating on your wife, you could have made a decent assistant to someone in the basement. You have thirty minutes to pack up your office. One more word out of you, and Sharon will have armed security escort you off the premises.”
“I believe what Steve is trying to tell you, Tony,” Dr. Odinson said then, “is that he does not know how ‘life,’ as you say, ‘works.’ He is here to learn how. But you, Tony, who have not trusted anyone to get to know you in eight years: Are you willing to make that journey with him?”
“He’s in the after school program, his parents can’t get him so his aunt is usually here, but it seems—I’m sure everything is fine,” Steve quickly decided, clearly avoiding any less than optimistic scenarios. “If you’re already in Brooklyn, you’re welcome to wait at my place, mom’s not far from there.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve exhaled with palpable relief, “I, I won’t let you down. Day or night, Tony. Whatever is available, as soon as possible, schedule it and I will be there.”
Tony pinched his lips together, then in a rush, he said, “I need you to call Danvers and get her to let me into their hotel.”
“Never interrupt a customer again, pet,” Steve growled through his teeth against Tony’s ear. His anger was palpable, and Steve’s disappointment left Tony cold and shivering after such a violent affair. “That is not your place.”
Steve set his jaw to keep all the words he wanted to shout from reaching Tony’s ears. In his lingering silence, he could so clearly see the spark of Tony’s delusional hope fade in his eyes.
Tony’s look of excitement and shock eased further into a warm adoration with every added confession. He took two small steps closer and leaned in farther still on the balls of his feet until they were so close Steve could feel Tony’s breath against his lips.
Brock gazed up at him with a grin, pitying in his amusement. “Steve, what are you talking about? Why would you want to do that?”
It was still the dead of night when Tony stirred awake. He peered around himself with a sleepy frown, only to realize Steve was crawling over him to reach the window.
“Hi, this is Steve Rogers,” Steve was saying before he realized Tony may not remember his name. “We shared, um. We talked over Sno Balls on Monday? Is there any chance I could talk to him? It’ll only take a minute.”
“Steve, darling, I’m telling you, I’ve been dreaming about those buns all week,” he admitted with a small pout and big, pleading eyes he shamelessly batted for full effect. “Please?”
, which he’d worked on for nearly two months and basically was his secret lovechild with Superman. “It’s just my,”
“I have seen you on the television, I believe; your face is quite familiar, though I’m not sure why,” she admitted, to which Brydon, a trained comedian, could only agree.
He and Tony had gotten rooms across the hall from each other again, and they grunted goodbyes as they shuffled into their respective spaces. The smell of a warm meal greeted him as soon as he wandered further into the room, and Steve dropped everything in his hands to rush forward and check what was waiting for him on the cart.
But Steve gave him the same long-suffering and grudgingly amused side-eye he always did, and instead of expressing frustration with Tony’s mixed signals, he gave Tony one of the four hot dogs he ordered and continued his earlier train of thought. “Did you have anything on your plate except our story on Wayne HR?”
game, but not the usual ‘hard to get’ schtick. If he’s still into you, he probably appreciates that.”
His was the fate of a dinghy out in a storm on the great ocean tide, thrown out of his depth and overwhelmed at every new turn. Two fingers scissored and fucked into him while Steve rubbed firm, soothing circles over his perineum with his thumb, and Tony’s entire world narrowed to
It didn’t matter how many times he rearranged his day or re-did the math. It didn’t matter, because he kept coming to the same conclusion.
“You know, a friend of a friend told me about this guy, Justin, he sounded great for you. Why don’t you let me set you up? He’s interested in engineering, too, and he loves to dance—”
The question was so simple, and yet Steve was already squirming. He pulled his blankets to cover his lap, rubbing slow, pacifying circles over his cock with his open palm. “Sometimes,” he admitted in a whisper, choosing his words carefully. Some things weren’t easy to share, even with an encouraging partner. Tony was unusually quiet. In words softer and gentler even than a whisper, Tony urged Steve to tell him more.
She introduced him to the legendary pantry that lived up to its reputation, then left him a hand-written 3x5 index card with the recipe for a red velvet cake.
Steve didn’t know if he should be crawling into Tony’s lap for a hug or if that would be too much joy for him to handle and his tumbling heartbeat would burst out of his ears.
Aside from the dog tags that he never took off, Tony’s prized possession, his most cherished memento, was Steve’s ROTC hoodie. It was enormous, large even on Steve, and Tony happily drowned himself in its soft, warm embrace. The nights were still so cold, and on nights like these, when he wasn’t too tired or drunk to remember, Tony would open the windows to let the cold air in so he could soak in the warmth of Steve’s sweater as he drifted to sleep.
Tony set his jaw and grabbed his keys. “No, Steve. You’re not alone. Come on, you’re coming home with me.”
Steve rose to his feet and clapped a hand over Tony’s mouth to quiet him. When he finally indulged Tony enough to finger his spit-slick hole, Steve’s fingers were well-coated in lube. Distantly it occured to Tony that maybe that’s why Steve had only spread his ass for rimming one-handed, but it didn’t so much matter as one and then two fingers were fucked into his ass. Tony had gone to bed with Cesar the night before, his black special occasion monster dildo, so it didn’t take Steve long before he was fucking three thick fingers into Tony, twisting and stretching his rim until he was satisfied.
It was common decency, and yet Steve’s heart fluttered. What would a cool person say? Damnit, this was high school all over again.
Once Tony’s pants came off, Steve’s MO was always the same. He didn’t waste time, and he dove in with gusto. Usually, Tony would worry if Steve didn’t stroke, slap, squeeze, kiss, or bite his ass at first opportunity, but this time… he understood.
“Thor,” he said finally, waving his hands at them both to interrupt the sudden shouting match between his friends. “Just, just out of, I don’t know, morbid curiosity. Did you ever tell Jane about the fire in your loins?”
Steve grinned against his lips with a hum of delight. “Damn, Tony. So romantic,” he teased, and when Tony snickered quietly, Steve laughed. “Me, too. For the record.”
Thor and Bruce shoved their way into his office so fast it was obvious they had been eavesdropping at the door, and for once, they seemed to agree: they were both
“I think,” Clint finally grunted, breathless and mostly half-alive, “I think I’d preferred the poison.”
“The whole farm? That’s big talk out of you, Rogers,” Tony couldn’t stop himself from saying. Too late it occurred to him that maybe if he wanted more Steve kisses in his near future, maybe he shouldn’t keep insulting him (or farmers) (or Kansas) (or the midwest in general).
“If it doesn’t involve math, eh…” Bruce trailed off with a wishy-washy gesture, doing his best to avoid comparing his friend to the common pigeon. “Just make sure he’s not holding anything sharp when you say it. Or a blowtorch. Or, you know, a bomb.”
Steve stared at him, half pissed, half euphoric with relief. “You’re okay?” he whispered with newfound hope, brushing Tony’s hair from his eyes with a gentle touch to better see his face.
Steve grabbed Sitwell by the throat and lifted him off his feet. Frozen in shock, Tony stared up at the bald man, wide-eyed. He should perhaps have felt alarm or discomfort from Steve’s behavior, but he was in absolute awe. Sitwell wasn’t an underfed man, after all, and Tony found he couldn’t resist glancing at Steve and the way his uniform strained over his lifting arm to contain his power.
It took concerted coordination, but Tony pushed himself to sit up so he could look out the window before turning his attention to Steve. “Are you cold?” Tony asked, puzzled and bordering on concerned. “You’re shiv—wait, did you see something? Something out there?”
Steve wished the floor would open up and swallow him whole, send him down the express lane to hell. He needed to have a talk with Tony, and it needed to happen sooner rather than later.
Tony offered Steve his hand, and Steve couldn’t help but shake it. “I’m Steve, Steve Rogers. What is it you do, Tony?”
“You know, that’s a great question. They do, in a way. The male giraffes use them to fight each other to impress the females.”
Light flooded the intimate little nook from every direction. The A-frame ceiling was built entirely of reclaimed glass, and the large French doors to the balcony allowed sunlight in from the front of the cabin while a large arched window dominated the back wall. There was no other furniture in the loft except for the bed that had been dressed in layered, warm bedding, and cotton flannel sheets.
Steve blinked back at her. He was so wrapped up in feeling sorry for himself he didn’t think that this might bring up hurtful memories of her own. As far as Steve was concerned, he wouldn’t want to be reminded of this morning’s pain two, three, or even fifteen years down the line.
. “And Google said the flowers you’ve been bringing home this week are for apologies. What was I meant to think?”
“Off duty,” Steve said in a clipped tone, cupping Tony’s face with his big hand to block Tony from the creature’s view.
Steve checked his watch and allowed a few seconds to pass so that Tony could get comfortable in his new cocoon. Then, slowly, Steve lifted the covers enough to lean in after him, nuzzling into Tony’s soft hair and up the back of his ear, where, softly, he spoke to him. “Tony?” he murmured under his breath, and with some added concentration, emanated both heat and the faint scent of a crackling log fire, something he had learned was particularly enticing to the repressed but adventurous type.
“How about Sally’s pumpkin pie?“ Laura said in a blatant effort to change the topic. “Who wants some of that?”
In stark contrast to how he’d fucked Tony only seconds earlier, Steve pulled out slowly and with great care. He knelt behind Tony again, spreading his cheeks just enough to see his own handywork. His gentle probing and clinical touch told Tony it wasn’t a part of the sex, but Steve’s need to assure himself that Tony wasn’t hurt or bleeding. It was something Steve always did after a particularly rough scene, and while he hadn’t said it, Tony cherished these wordless, physical check-ins deeply. He stayed in position, relaxed and satisfied while Steve examined his ass with gentle fingers and indulging massages.
“Mellow greetings, Captain Steven G. Rogers and Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” he said with a deferential bow of his head. “How may I add to the serenity of your morning?”
“Not really,” Tony admitted quietly, then turned enough to catch Steve’s eye. “You’re all I need. I don’t need you to make promises to anyone else, just to me.”
“In a manner of speaking,” Steve hedged at first, speaking quietly. Tony wasn’t dumb, and judging by his sudden silence and careful attention, Steve was pretty sure he already understood. Still, it was a question he needed to ask.
With a surly, irritated groan, Tony finally opened his eyes. Steve was crouched on the floor of his room, ducked behind the bed. He frowned to himself in confusion, blinking at Steve for several beats until it sunk in that
All he got at first was a grunt of displeasure, but with enough persistence and shaking, Tony slowly turned to give him a withering look.
“Well, shit. Remind me never to tell Sam anything,” Tony said with a quiet snicker in his voice. “Did I tell you they’re putting me on a diet for MIB? As soon as this is over, I’m supposed to bulk up 30-40 pounds.”
“Thank you, Lila,” Rhodey replied with a smile. They switched positions and while Lila rolled out Rhodey’s failed dough again, Rhodey picked up a knife to start cutting Lila’s mostly okay rope into short circles.
The Captain gave them the power to pull officers as needed to provide Steve backup on his ‘dates’, and also assigned a profiler to their team to step in after Tony left. As much as he hated leaving, Tony could admit that despite his first (and second) (and third) impression, Scott Lang surprised him. He spent thirty minutes reviewing Tony’s notes and another hour poring over the data before arriving at a similar conclusion: they were after an insecure man with a fragile ego. A loner in the crowd, a man who thrived on attention and admiration from his peers without any interest or investments in meaningful social connections. Likely a middle-aged man with a wealthy family whose insecurity stemmed from familial comparisons, such as more successful parents, siblings, or cousins, who used attractive sugar babies as quick means of being envied by his peers.
Among the hopes and dreams Maria shared in her letters, there was always one unwavering constant: her confidence in her son. She had no doubt that Tony would become a remarkable man, a man who would do for the world what his father had done for their people.
Clint all but beamed when he grinned back. “There’s nothing my brother can’t ride. Easily the best of his generation. But, you know, fast forward a couple years, and the idiot sees a manatee on our first trip to Florida,” he added in a slow, accusative drawl, “then, he learns they’re called sea cows…”
“But he’s hot, so does that matter?” Bruce asked, looking from Thor to Tony in his confusion. When they both gave him a weird look, he rolled his eyes and said, “I was drunk, I wasn’t blind.”
“Good! That makes two of us, Tony! Would you please go and do your monologue, do the sketches, then come home so I can fuck
“All of what?” Tony eventually had to interrupt him to ask. He’d never seen Steve so unnerved before, and he really didn’t like it. “Steve, what are you saying?”
“If that motherfucker can't fold you into his bigger picture, he's got serious creative limitations. I know—hey, listen,” he added gently when Steve only pursed his lips in frustration. “I know this means a lot to you. But it takes two to tango, and comedy is weird. Once you find the right people, Steve, it’ll come so easily you won’t even need a script. Give it time.”
“Better?” he whispered against the shell of Tony’s ear. His warm breath gusted over the sensitive skin of his neck, sending shivers down Tony’s spine. Tony had barely nodded in agreement before Steve pushed Tony’s top leg forward to spread his thighs and expose the cleft of his ass.
“Such a drama queen,” Steve observed sagely, and when Tony came around to help him out of the car, Steve perhaps leaned on him more than necessary. The grunt of effort that escaped Tony when he tried to haul most of Steve’s 240 uncooperative pounds to the door was worth it.
His new friend looked up at him with an expression that clearly had no patience for bullshit. “Listen, if a guy like you can’t save your relationship, there ain’t hope for us mere mortals. And if you’re sure this isn’t some homophobic shit,” he clarified emphatically, “what are you waiting for? Steal that bitch back.”
He never had a particular hygiene routine until he and Steve got serious. Whether he did it intentionally or not, Steve got Tony hooked on taking long, warm baths after working in the workshop. Those baths were always improved with Steve’s hands and Steve’s laughter, and if he turned off all the lights and pulled the curtain, Tony could pretend that he was back in their suite at the Commonwealth, nude except for his dog tags and soaking in the tub as he waited for Steve to walk in through the door to join him.
For Rumlow, the museum’s Hall of Violence was a home away from home. The exhibit began with the crudest weapons, tracing mankind’s violent history from barbaric clubs, stone axes, pitchforks, arrowheads, to the Western Colt revolver and the old reliable Thompson made iconic in the days of Al Capone.
Steve glanced Tony’s way through the rearview mirror long enough to make eye contact. He remained silent.
“You don’t call your mother to tell her you got married on a drunken whim, but ‘don’t worry, he’s a great guy’ who insists on keeping it absolutely secret and divorcing you the first chance he gets.”
Tony swallowed hard, nodding uncomfortably in an effort to convince himself that Steve was right. “Yeah,” he agreed, though he clearly didn’t believe it for a second. “Yeah, right. You’re right. You will be fine, I will be fine. I will go there and do what we’ve rehearsed—”
She didn’t seem relaxed enough in his company to lie down, so Tony found another pillow to support her back so she could sit up more comfortably. Then he sat down in a plastic chair provided for visitors, a very clear sign that he had no intention of leaving soon.
He smoothed his lubed hand over his cock in a loose fist, lined himself up, and thrust in with such force Tony lost his breath with a grunt of surprise. There was no waiting, no adjusting, Steve pounded into him without abandon, soon losing himself to the way Tony’s ass and thighs bounced to the same maddening pace of his hips. They had only just started and he desperately tried to control himself, to make it last, but the jiggle and bounce of Tony’s beautifully round, perky ass was too much, he could feel instinct start to take over when Tony reached back and grabbed him by the neck.
Steve took a moment to brace himself. This morning, facing the world had felt impossible, but he’d done it anyway and it hadn’t been half as difficult as he’d imagined.
“What I did never mattered to me, Tony. All I’ve wanted was to find the right partner,” Steve promised. “And honestly? You’ve been worth the wait.”
“Thanks, dad,” Steve said with a grudging smile. Clark had pulled on a pair of Steve’s jeans and a cozy flannel shirt. Even without the glasses he was Steve’s dad again instead of some superhero in the sky, and all at once Steve was struck by how homesick he felt.
“Hey, babe,” Tony said after a beat, still processing what he was seeing. “What, uh. What’re you doing here?”
“It’s bigger than almost every human man’s penis,” Tony said before Arlene voiced the question she clearly wanted to ask (and mortified Mr. Rogers again), “
“I’m more of a short rib and jalapeno guy, actually,” Tony said, then turned to order when it was his turn; Steve wouldn’t let him pay, and instead invited Tony to add a cocktail to the order before adding his own burger, fried pickles, and a Brooklyn gin cocktail.
“Some of them do,” Tony chimed in before Steve had to say anything. “The duck hen is selective, so the drake gets creative. A little rapey. Not just fly-by rapey, but gang-rapey, too. I didn’t tell the kids that,” he quickly promised Steve.
“Doesn’t have to do with the square, I think. At some point, the US government gave England a statue of George Washington as a gift, and they chose to put it here. Except, George Washington had sworn never to step foot on English soil ever again, because he’s extra like that, so when they sent the statue they included a piece of America so that the Washington statue wouldn’t make a liar out of Washington.”
Tony followed him hesitantly, watching as Steve set their bags on the small table. He grinned at the little fire going in the honest to god wood-burning stove that warmed their tree house, then stepped out to take in the view from the balcony. The more he saw, the more Tony watched his smile grow, until with a surge of energy Steve climbed the ladder to the loft to see the bed.
“Then please, tell me how I can get it, or—show me how I can learn,” Steve rushed to say, “please, if it’s books to read or people to talk to, I’ll do anything. Couples therapy, or—”
It could be his first night with Tony, it could be his last. It didn’t matter what it was, but Steve wanted it more than anything. “You’ve worried about me enough, Tony,” he said on their unhurried walk to his bedroom. “Let me show you how grateful a man like me can be.”
“This feels surreal,” Tony whispered with a smile, running blunt nails across Steve’s scalp and neck in absent little patterns. “I must be dreaming.”
Tony chuckled at whatever sorry sight Steve must have made. The sound of his quiet, rumbling laugh warmed Steve somewhere deep inside, and tired as he was he couldn’t stop from smiling in return.
Maria laughed, and took a sharp turn from one road to the next. When Steve recognized the distant outline of the ranch house, he closed his eyes and thanked his lucky stars. Maybe he’d survive this car ride after all.
Steve was sitting on his couch in pajamas with a heating pad tucked behind his lower back for comfort while he read the sports pages he hadn’t had time for that morning. He looked up at Bucky with a question clear in his expression, since Bucky had no reason to walk into his apartment after hours.
Steve thought he heard Tony murmur something above him, his words as intangible and fleeting as those in a forgotten dream. As he finished kneading Steve’s inner thigh, Tony slipped his warm, oiled fingers over Steve’s balls, cradling and squeezing them ever so gently in his hand. There was no sense of urgency or blazing passion to rouse Steve from his dreamlike state, but an intimate caress, a momentary pleasure that anticipated no other action. It soothed away Steve’s tenuous desire, and when Tony let go and let the warm blanket weigh down on him again, Steve closed his eyes with a deep sigh of content.
Tony had no interest in returning to his home after that. Simply being alone disturbed him, and he quietly sat at Steve’s desk the whole afternoon while Steve made his way through the mountain of paperwork that came with such a convoluted case.
Tony didn’t care how long Steve fucked him so long as he never stopped. An eternity passed in heartbeats, and Tony basked in the bone-deep pleasure of Steve’s four slippery fingers pumping and twisting into his body, filling him for what felt both like months and seconds.
“I don’t care if I have to stand on a balcony to drop an anvil over his head, Wile E Coyote style,” Bucky promised, “that asshole hurt my best friend. What has Steve
“I intended to review my pages,” Tony explained, “but memories stole me away to what is arguably your greatest achievement.”
“These arrived for you today,” Howard said and held up two ring boxes. One was large and square, the other round, and more demure. “Why don’t you tell me what’s in here, Steve.”
Without ever knowing her, Tony inherited much from his mother. He inherited her eyes, her reserve. He inherited the many gifts she made for him during her pregnancy, and the countless letters she wrote to him sharing her everyday thoughts and her wish to finally meet him. She wanted most desperately to see the man he would grow to be. The letters she wrote to him were the only glimpse Tony had of the woman his mother had been, of the dreams she had for herself and for him.
She nodded to herself as she processed his list. “Speak up in Hawley’s class, she likes people with an opinion. For Donovan, try to get a seat in the back. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability. And for Levinson, make sure you read the footnotes. That’s where a lot of her test questions come from.”
“Coat room, where yours should be,” Steve said, and with one last, quick peck on Tony’s lips, Steve leaned back to put some distance between them and gently gestured for Tony to give it to him. “I’ll put it away, you should get a drink.”
“Sweetheart, hang on a second—breathe,” Steve said with a quiet laugh, pressing a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s hand. He gave Tony a few seconds to regroup before explaining himself. “Is it so hard to imagine I feel the same? I might not have as much as you, but… my tuition is covered, and I paid my bills. After that, you, our time together, that’s what I want to spend my money on, too. And if you argue with me about my spending,” Steve added when Tony open his mouth again, “then I’ll start arguing with you about yours.”
“Why don’t we see how your rivalry works off screen,” Carl continued suggestively, and Tony inhaled deeply in an effort to look more awake and curious. “We have a game we like to play called Initial Reaction. I will call out these randomly generated initials, and the first one to think of an actor or actress with those initials wins the point. First to seven wins the game.”
Tony pinched his lips together in a tight line of discomfort, but slowly, Steve noticed he breathed more easily. Color slowly returned to his face until he was practically blushing. Whether Tony believed him or Steve’s deliberate tone of voice helped calm him, Tony seemed to have found an even keel again.
“Because he just gave me the lead on Scorpius that Q-branch couldn’t,” Steve replied impatiently. “Make the call. He’s an asset, Buck. I need him in London.”
Steve swallowed slowly and tried to steady himself. There were tears in his eyes, but all he had to do was breathe deeply to keep his cool and stop the tears from falling.
Jane glanced at her superior with palpable concern in her eyes. “What just happened, Lieutenant Tony Stark?”
Tony growled at Bond’s easy flirting. Engaging with him wasn’t worth the headache. “I’m running the remote tracker now,” Tony told him in a tired voice. “Stand by. Confirm current location.”
“Like waxedtreasuretrail81 said,” Steve drawled to Tony’s sudden burst of laughter, “I have no idea what’s going on or what will be happening, but it’s a journey that couldn’t have come at a better time.”
Punching the mute button wasn’t as satisfying as slamming down a receiver, but it was damn close. Bucky stared at him from two feet away, where he waited to reconnect with 002 on a long-range tagging op.
There was a rolling tray with a champagne bottle chilling in a bucket of ice waiting outside his room.
“That wasn’t our stop, it was just the best stop cause you’re such an asshole,” Tony muttered to himself as he pulled out his phone to check how far Charing Cross was from Cecil Court. “Oh, we’re close. Five minutes.”
“You?” Howard said with an unfriendly smirk. “You think your decorative designer plumage makes you qualified for honest labor,
, that’s opening next weekend,” Jimmy Kimmel said as the audience’s enthusiastic applause and cheers slowly quieted down. “I mean, you worked with Gal Gadot, who is, is—”
Tony pouted into Dummy’s cheek, stroking his horse’s velvety muzzle. “I missed you, too, little guy,” he whispered, before gently urging Dummy to back off. The horse snorted unhappily and went unwillingly when Tony pushed him away, but eventually complied and trotted off.
After a long day weeding through the final selection of projects and trying to work out scheduling so he would be able to do all the things he wanted to do - and, more importantly, the things the two women he trusted with his career told him to do - Steve finally made it to LaGuardia. The car was there to pick him up and take him to the arranged hotel, and his agent would follow on the red eye to be there by morning. All he had to do was settle in, maybe say hi to the cast assembled for promotions, and hit the hay. If he wanted to have the energy to suffer through two straight days of press without getting sassy with someone, he needed every hour of rest he could get.
“Wow, hey, easy, big guy,” Tony murmured softly, holding on to Steve’s arms for support and rubbing Steve’s arm gently in a comforting gesture until Steve helped him sit down on the wide couch. “Nothing like that, nothing bad, nothing without consent. Extensive, enthusiastic consent.”
A whisper of wheels and gentle beeps approached Steve from behind, and he turned in time to see Dum-E barreling down at him, top-speed. The robot twirled around him in a blatant display of delight, chirping loudly with every spin.
. I tried to imagine the son a man with that trajectory might raise. And that worked as a foundation for the first time we meet Robert, but now we get to reimagine him as a survivor of what happened to him, as a man with newfound purpose. I really got a chance to develop Iron Man independent of his legacy, and that was exciting to me. I explored him on my terms, and, I just… I loved every minute of it. I hope the fans like it, too.”
Steve reached for the sheets and grabbed on before he lost his composure. He had spent too long thinking about the power of Tony’s thighs, and the way his round, perky ass filled out his jeans. If this was only the beginning of what Tony had planned for them, Steve wasn’t going to last.
Tony cleared his throat and continued his earlier list, “—improper language, chocolate, gasoline, non-educational toys, and anything spicy.”
“Did your dad finally get there?” Steve heard his mom asking through the phone. “What took him so long?”
Soon a team of people with his clothes and his outlined conversation topics filled his suite, and confident in Tony’s health and happiness, it was so easy to focus on the task at hand so he could make it one step closer to being back home.
“Natasha?” Steve said, dumbfounded. “Red and black. Those are her colors, red and black. Why did—what’s this, African Violet? What’s she going to do with purple?”
“I care about you a lot, Steve. And, uh. The idea that you… okay, this is fucking embarrassing, okay, but when you don’t want my money, or you want to pay for us? It’s… it’s stupid, maybe, whatever, but that terrifies me. That’s one less thing I can do for you, or, one less, um. One less way I can be helpful to you.”
Tony stared at him, shocked. This was information he needed! He wanted to ask why—what was so exciting about bottoming, what did Steve like so much about it. He wanted to ask how he was so sure that Tony, who had no experience either way, could give Steve what he so clearly wanted. Suddenly the pressure felt staggering and impossible in an unexpected direction. Worse still, now there were two things Tony felt unprepared for! Two very important duties that nobody else could help him with, no books he could study or tutors who could help him. Not for the first time he toyed with the idea of crowdsourcing the details from actors in adult entertainment or from licensed sex workers, but if word ever got back to Steve about it, Tony would never hear the end of it.
“Tony. He doesn’t hold it against you,” Steve said with the kind of conviction he rarely expressed for near-strangers. “If anything, he’s happy you’re doing better. He said so himself.”
“Pierce Corporation,” Tony whispered in a voice he couldn’t muster. This was so much worse than he could ever have expected. “Steve Rogers, this means—our Governor, he must be in danger, there must be a, a criminal mastermind who has infiltrated his corporation and released the madman Brock Rumlow to do his bidding, our eminent Governor could be a target—”
He drew a hand up the crack of Tony’s ass, scooping the plentiful, excess lube into the palm of his hand. “Easy,” he whispered, rubbing Tony’s lower back gently, encouraging him to relax. “Breathe, sweetheart.”
Soon, every breath Tony could spare slipped away in short, gusting moans. A strong hand pushed against his right thigh, spreading his legs further apart, while another scraped insistent, blunt fingernails down his upper thigh, the first hint of Steve’s desire. Between his rough hands, and the fleeting tickle of the silk robe brushing over his skin, Tony shuddered and groaned into Steve’s mouth, and when Steve wrapped one hand around Tony’s hard cock to stroke him, firm and fast, through his briefs, the contrast of his touch to his tender, languid kisses had Tony’s eyes rolling back with pleasure and whimpering with need.
As often was the case, it was Steve who noticed the change first. In difference to Steve, Tony slept peacefully. If he slept facing Steve, he’d be on his side with his head pillowed on Steve’s chest, one arm thrown over Steve’s middle and the other curled behind Steve’s broad shoulders. When he faced away, he pressed his back flush against Steve’s warm side and loosely hugged Steve’s arm, trapping it close to himself so he could use Steve’s upper arm for a pillow throughout the night. Neither of them rolled or spread out in their sleep; at worst, Tony sometimes nuzzled too much into Steve’s thick bicep and created a gap between their bodies that inevitably woke him from the unexpected chill of his bare back.
Tony hadn’t locked up behind him, so the door easily swung open to give Clint, the actor who played the SHIELD agent known as Hawkeye, an uninterrupted view of the scene taking place in Steve’s trailer.
“You can’t even ask me to give you another chance,” Steve asked, his lip curling up in a smirk of satisfaction as he saw recognition dawn on Tony’s face. “You demand that I give you another chance?”
Steve didn’t need a shower any more than Tony, but he leaned into Tony’s embrace, nuzzling into his shoulder and measuring his breath to echo the steady rise and fall of Tony’s chest. They stood in the warm shower long enough for Steve’s fingers to turn pruney, and in all that time, Tony’s hands never strayed from rubbing firm, soothing patterns over Steve’s back. Steve supposed he had to feel a little better at least when that realization landed with mild disappointment.
“I thought it was something like that,” Steve admitted, and Tony could have basked in his twinkling smile and irrepressible amusement for hours. “I’ve never seen color drain from someone’s face so quickly before in my life.”
Except, he had no voice, and no words adequately meaningful came to mind. Before he knew it, Tony had climbed into the flatbed and gotten on his knees at Steve’s feet. When he leaned in close enough to kiss, Steve neither shied away or grimaced at the sweat and grime.
A blush crept up Tony’s neck and colored his cheeks at such a request, but Tony reminded himself that this was for Steve’s edification. “To call someone by only his first name is a very intimate gesture, Steve Rogers,” Tony said in a whisper, in case someone Tony was not accounting for might overhear. Then, with more care not to alarm Steve, he continued to elaborate on his explanation to be sure Steve understood what he meant. “It is only shared between lovers.
“I love you,” Tony told him with a smile that left Steve swallowing down a knot of emotion. “But Steve, my love, you ate nine and a half pies in less than four minutes! Who could overlook such an absurd number of pies?”
“...rat burgers?” Steve said quietly in his apparent disbelief. “Leticia’s burgers are rat burgers?”
“Stevie, wait a minute,” his ma had said as he told her the most basic details about the case. “Is that the same James Barnes you played with as a kid?”
“This has been a tough case, Steve. You had my back when it mattered, I won’t forget that,” Tony told him in a calm, gentle voice. For once in this whole mess of hope and excitement and insanity that was his partnership and friendship with Steve, he knew precisely what he wanted.
An insistent, metallic rap against his trailer door pulled Steve’s attention away from trying to beat his high score. With a quiet sigh, he pushed himself up to sitting on the couch, removed the large ice-packs padding his swollen knees, then slowly rolled up to his feet. It took some time, but eventually he shuffled far enough so he could open the door and poke his head out.
Tony could neither read minds or allow Steve to simply walk away. He had no choice but to chase after Steve.
“That sounds like a great party,” Jimmy said with an impressed nod, “will the other Avengers be there?”
“I didn’t ask you to buy me a drink, I asked you to have a drink with me,” Steve said, sitting down in a seat where he had a view of the doors. “So what do you do? Besides hosing down strangers in the street.”
“Tuesday has no right being this fucking long,” Tony huffed, but his argument deflated after that. He nuzzled in closer, resting his cheek on Steve’s shoulder.
A laugh burst out of Tony as relief washed over him. “A prototype,” he tried to explain, retrieving the mask to show Steve his newest creation up close. Whether it was his excitement or his answer that had comforted Steve, he looked genuinely interested in learning what Tony had made.
unsaid, again. “It’ll probably be awkward at first, but maybe with time I’ll find the right home for me. Hopefully, I’ll know it when I see it.”
Before them all, Ean and his twelve attendants made their way to the sacred stone where the newly elected Mayor of Marham, Torin Greaves, anxiously waited. Unlike the chief priest, this was the Mayor’s first ritual mating. As the elected leader of the town, the Mayor represented the people and their goodwill, and therefore had the most to prove to their patron goddess. His leadership affected the livelihood and satisfaction of every family in their peaceful township, and in the sacred rite of Imbolg, Brigid judged Marham’s Mayor before all her followers. If the Mayor’s sacrifice failed to impress their patron goddess, a new Mayor would be elected whose virility could satisfy Brigid and ensure her continued blessing upon Marham’s people and climate.
“Speaking of: I miss my Jason Mamoa,” Jane decided, finishing the last of her beer and sliding off her stool. “Let’s get out of here - I’m just gonna run to the ladies room.”
“There’s nothing wrong with the watch,” Steve said. If Clint felt his reply was defensive, he didn’t seem to care; instead, Clint cursed under his breath, and smacked his brother as he marched out of the closet. Tony followed him without taking a look for himself, as if wanting to spare himself the horror.
Without looking at his unfinished text, Tony tossed the phone to the far side of the sofa and turned to Steve with a serious expression. “All yours. Tell me.”
When the bull bucked, Tony led with his thighs and rolled his hips forward, absorbing the shock like a rolling wave. The highest power setting had the bull twisting and throwing Tony so quickly it was all nearly a blur, but Tony rode out the bull with a natural grace to the wild cheering and applause of the crowd.
Tony tossed and turned all night, and finally gave up on sleep around six the next morning. He rolled over and grabbed his phone off his night stand before so much as thinking about facing the world. Among a variety of email notifications and news updates were two sole messages that had come in from Steve around four in the morning.
“Louder, darling,” Tony whispered between breathless kisses when he thought he caught Steve gasping his name. “Don’t hide from me.”
“Thank you, Officer Jane Foster,” Tony replied smoothly despite his anxious, twitching fingers. “After you.”
Tony’s transition from discomfort and pain to overwhelming pleasure happened incredibly fast. He squirmed and whimpered helplessly as his body struggled to give itself time to adjust, but Steve’s grip was merciless. He held Tony firmly in position as he fucked into him hard and fast, pounding into him chasing his own orgasm without any outward concern for Tony’s pleasure.
Tony blinked up at where Sam and Sharon were promising to be together until death do them part in front of all their friends and family.
“Think of your children!” Tony said, but both Natasha and Bucky suddenly turned furious glares at him. “What?” he said quietly, “they always say that on cinematic discs.”
Steve frowned a little at the question and leaned back in the couch to think it over. His plan to be as open as possible about everything but his citizenship had been more plausible in theory; to put the plan into effect, to say these words out loud in front of strangers, it all made his skin crawl now that it mattered most.
, Steve? Brace yourself, baby,” he whispered in a smooth, husky voice that left Steve powerless to resist him. “Soon you might wish I always was away on press tours.”
“Yeah,” Steve replied despite his better judgement, already reaching for his phone to call for a car. “My place?”
With a shake of his head, Tony quietly snorted to himself and leaned back in his own seat. “I am a writer. Not for books,” he clarified, before Steve asked, “I write about tech and anything that runs on an engine for
“You wish you could get rid of me that easily,” Steve answered sincerely instead. “Do your worst, Stark. I’ll be right here, waiting for you.”
“Uncle Steve, they’re looking pretty golden,” Lila said as she scooped up the fried balls in the skimmer. He quickly held up a plate draped with a paper towel so she could get them all on there before they did the next batch.
The only personal touch in the living room was a large, blue tray full of different boxes and items. Some things were immediately recognizable - a set of keys, which seemed anachronistic in this digital future, a fleece blanket with his shield design, and a small note with instructions for how to get in touch with Tony through the apartment’s internal AI in case of various emergencies.
The fact that Tony kept up with them and even offered advancements of his own didn’t seem to affect how they looked down their noses at him. In that first week, they sent him out like a common messenger boy to retrieve a component for a design that some bigwig in Harvard had created.
“Oh,” Tony whispered, audibly taken aback. It took him a moment to continue. “So soon? It’s, um. Can I help?”
Within the hour of Rumlow’s escape, Fury gathered his senior Lieutenants in a private meeting to avoid raising alarm. For his quick thinking and unbecoming fascination with the 21st, Tony was the only silver class personnel invited to stand inside the room while the gold class officers sat around Fury’s meeting table.
“I, I uh,” Tony floundered in a way Steve had never imagined possible. “You weren’t, um. You weren’t supposed to hear that yet.”
Tony shoved the headset on and tried not to let his pride taint his first interaction with the one and only 007.
“Computer, fiber-op Governor Alexander G. Pierce’s office and inform them of our intention to meet with the Governor,” Tony instructed the dashboard computer. “We wish to follow up on yesterday’s incident at the museum.”
Tony reached to soothe his fingers over Steve’s cheeks, cradling his face tenderly to express himself better with sweet, chaste kisses.
“Be well, and be gone,” Fury barked at the nurses, and like frightened sheep, they jumped away and hustled out of the room.
Before Tony could respond, the waitress came around to their table to take their order. Tony ordered a little of everything, heavy on the cheese. There was no point coming to Switzerland if they didn’t indulge in dairy and chocolate, and on Steve’s first trip? Not on Tony’s watch.
“Is it just like you always imagined it?” Bucky wondered with morbid curiosity. “Surrounded by housewives and miscellaneous virgins?”
Tony followed his pull easily, nuzzling into the crook of Steve’s neck, where he took a deep, steady breath. If he wasn’t careful, his feelings for Steve were going to spill right out of him, and he couldn’t afford that. It was just too soon. Steve was really rolling with the punches, but some things needed time, even if he didn't.
“So many rules!” Steve whined in complaint, sitting up effortlessly and nosed at Tony’s jaw playfully. “Do I get to bring you home tonight?”
With a little effort, every step became easier than the last. She usually fell in beside him once Tony found their normal pace, but today his pumpkin muskrat sped up to maintain her two-to-three foot advantage. Tony didn’t think much of it until he reached to pet her and she darted out of reach.
While they were all getting ready to go home, Tony  turned back to the computer and got back to work. Work distracted him well enough that it took him a minute to realize Steve hadn’t left with the others, and he still hovered idly while doing his level best not to look at him.
Tony followed his superiors as they were all taken through to the conference hall where Captain America—Captain Steven Grant Rogers—had been rolled out in a hospital bed. He still shivered violently in the open air, wearing nothing but the heavy cloth covering his eyes. The Captain’s long, slick hair was tied up in a bun on his head, and his beard had been hastily cut in uneven chunks. His long hair and unusual beard was to be expected; cryostasis slowed down prisoners’ heartbeat and natural cell cycles, but even so, slow hair growth over centuries added up.
“Tony, sweetheart,” he heard Steve whispering, and his lips curled up at the heady and endearing combination of Steve’s deep, spicy musk mixed with the cedar and citrus scents he long associated with home. “Your plan worked: Foster is onboard again, I’m free for the night. We can go see your friends.”
For a second, Steve was lost. A show? He slowed his hips again, not sure if Tony was hurt and needed to show him something. They were building to the inevitable release, and as tough as it was to stop, Steve pulled out ever so gently and watched his cock slide out of Tony’s ass with great care to be sure there was no signs of bleeding.
“And it’s no surprise, so many of these are photographs of you in action. Look at this, here you are, doing lunges with the squirrels.”
,” Tony added emphatically with a mischievous grin that definitely caught Steve’s attention. “I was thinking more like, a date? Night out, a drink; maybe a dance? I mean,” he said in the brief second Steve hadn't reacted, rocking back on his heels a little as if he was growing less confident in his plan all of a sudden. “Sure, it’s not Tribeca ...hell, it’s not even Kansas, but you’d be hard pressed to find better people anywhere.”
