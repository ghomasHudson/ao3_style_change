Sherlock looked up at him and nodded slowly. John was always the kindest after he had done something to protect Sherlock's life.
Sherlock took out his phone and turned on the torch app, looking in past the door. “I think I can squeeze in. There's some sort of a box in the way.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Yes, fine. May I call you Alice?”
Sherlock snorted and coughed and spat on John's shirt again, attempting an objection, but the sound of ambulance sirens convinced him otherwise. Dealing with doctors was tiresome (John didn't count, he was John first) and he hated hospitals. He blinked ‘yes’ in Morse code (long short long long, short, short short short) to John whether he noticed it or not and then closed his eyes and sank away.
“Of course he did,” Sherlock muttered. He didn't hate his brother as much as he was eternally annoyed that Mycroft's pointy nose was too often in found in Sherlock's business.
“I see you're doing your exercises,” he commented and ignored the dismal state of the kitchen, sitting down at their desk instead and opening his laptop.
“Take them,” the obviously commanding officer said.
“I can catch a rat,” Sherlock huffed. “And a fish with my bare hands. It's just patience and sleight of hand.”
“No?” John seemed smug (why was he smug, what did he have to be smug about, he was absolutely wrong wrong WRONG, Sherlock liked being misunderstood). “Some people don't care about food is all I'm saying,” John looked at him. No, more than
“Yeah, but I don't want to be the reason your tongue ruptures.”
Sherlock had a mind to get up on the crutches that were thoughtfully left leaning against the wall next to his bed and go over and bash John's head in with one of them. But he didn't, showing considerable self-control. He finished the water, wiggled all of his body parts to take in and calculate the amount of damage and pain, and decided on his next course of action.
A shiver went through Sherlock.
“You had my wallet and I didn't have time to go shopping,” Sherlock pointed out and turned to look at John. He had colour in his face (even with the hospital lights) and his fingers had been warm as he'd taken the jam jar.
“Not by choice,” Sherlock retorted. He didn't enjoy his humanity. It was unnecessary at best and painful at worst.
“No doctor Watson?” she asked with that same humourless smile. “Milk? Sugar?”
There was a silence until Sherlock prompted Lestrade impatiently: “And then? How was he murdered?”
“Video would have been more informative,” Sherlock replied instantly, taking the bejeweled phone. It didn't ask for a PIN, just a
“I see. Well… welcome to my facility!” the doctor said, gesturing at the unassuming buildings.
Sherlock had just been about to ask that, but stayed quiet. “All right, I'll assume the worst. Using the ambient temperature as a guide you'll have about an hour before hypothermia. Up to which rib is the water?”
“Yes,” John replied and after a moment sat up, giving Sherlock a highly suspicious look. “Why?”
“And yet, somehow, you're still the most impossible thing.” John was peering into his face, be-amused.
John followed the arc of the cold pack with his eyes, then turned back to Sherlock. “I have some other questions.”
“E. coli, salmonella, toxoplasmosis,” he said once closer to the collapse, lowering himself on his stomach to spread his weight so as not to cause another cascade.
“This is the man, isn't it?” John said. “The polyphagic one.”
“Yes, and you should leave the crime-solving to me,” Sherlock muttered, annoyed by the smugness.
. Written by hand.”
Sherlock moved forward and crouched by the corpse, using a gloved finger to move aside the collar. There were hand-shaped bruises around the neck, as though someone had stood right in front of the late Arthur Gibson and strangled him in a room full of police. Except no one had been there.
. That trepidation on John's illuminated face belonged to
“Oh,” Alice began, using every fibre of Sherlock's deep voice to her obvious delight. She pulled out the vowel as long as she could until it mixed with the constant thrum of the thunder in Sherlock's ears.
“Do sit down, Mr..?”
,” John defended.
“Damn!” Sherlock slammed his hand on the table and looked around again. Glycerine and potassium permanganate only created fire in temperatures above 21 Celsius. John needed warmth. Now. Sherlock took off his coat and dropped it over John's shoulders. Some of it was still dry. “Look for a Bunsen burner, or matches. Anything. This is like a chemistry lab. There's bound to be something.”
A young woman was standing there, going through a book of samples, but she looked up when Sherlock laid his hand on the counter. First there was the badly hidden cringe when she saw his swollen cheek, and then the ingratiating smile when she noticed John behind him. John had that effect, Sherlock had noticed. When he was alone, people didn't quite know what to make of him, but with John he was automatically slotted in as a part of a couple. It was helpful, and it annoyed John, so it was win-win.
“She was it,” Sherlock said and put the plate down. “That old woman. She's Alice Waite.” Or was she? Perhaps Alice Waite had been someone who'd been taken over as well.
“Aha!” Sherlock said out loud. “Come on, John!”
“Any idea what it could be?” Lestrade pressed, obviously more anxious than usual.
“Time to break and enter,” he said cheerfully as they made their way over to the house. The garden was almost a maze, but some gravel paths still existed, one leading to a more open area in front of the back door. Locked of course. Sherlock knocked. “Oh, did you hear that, I clearly heard someone say come in,” he grinned at John. Plausible deniability and all that.
John licked his lips, looking up at him with a slightly nervous frown. “Fine,” he said somewhat hoarsely. “I'm attracted to you.”
. This is how a partnership worked, apparently, giving and taking, though John mostly took Sherlock's patience and Sherlock gave enormously out of his intellect and time.
“Not talking about those.” John elbowed him. “You should probably take it home. And bring me clean clothes tomorrow.”
“Herbert!” she said again, not able to see Herbert was down on the floor because the chair blocked her view. To Sherlock, who as a rule stayed away from religo-spiritual allusions, she looked demonic, faceless. Darkness was growing out of her in an aura that the lightning couldn't absolve and Sherlock felt that disorientation again, his consciousness going dark at the edges, but he grabbed John's shoulder and squeezed hard.
She was peering around him at John and Lestrade, the latter of which was trying to re-assert his authority. “Please answer him, ma'am.”
“The reason why he kept it, he told me, was because of the pattern. He'd never seen anything like it, and neither have I. I was studying it when Lestrade finally arrived, barely up to date on the case, but once he heard where the piece was from he started looking constipated.”
“Ah...” Molly grabbed a file and flipped through the few pages in it. “Looks like it was logged in at 12:17pm, so about forty-five minutes ago. I- I wasn't here. I was-”
“What- what the hell, Sherlock?”
“John,” he said quietly, making John look up and clamber back onto his feet. The men advanced, most of them just flowing past them with SIS precision. Two of them stopped to guard Sherlock and John until a third one (they were all interchangeable in their gear) approached.
“But?” Sherlock turned his head to look at John's profile.
“Mind PALACE,” Sherlock snapped out of reflex, looking around. They were sat in a booth in an otherwise empty diner. The waitress sat behind the counter, reading a book (An Introduction to Sociolinguistics, 6th edition, Wardhaugh), and everything was washed down with white lights. “For God's sake, John.”
“Contact your doctor? Really?” he said with the intonation of a man who really wants to curse.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, fighting the urge to grab a red pen and correct the grammar of the message. That at least was somewhat interesting, though most likely a drunk girl's panicked misunderstanding of what was going on around her as she woke in an unfamiliar place.
He added starting for the door with or without John.
Sherlock stared up at him from his now prone position on the floor, his previously relaxed face scrunched in distaste. “No, he does not -- and I’d pay you to drop the matter.” he said.
Tom glanced over at John. “Well, I’ll pass that along, no use letting stray rumors get blown out of proportion.” He finally pulled the lid off the food and the bond suddenly spiked again with hunger. Hyperion physically gripped the edge of his mat in an attempt to restrain himself, all the while his tongue flickered out to taste the new strong scent of raw meat on the air, his nostrils flared and pupils dilated at the prospect of a feed. Tom let out a low laugh when John’s stomach growled loudly in false hunger under the assault from Hyperion’s side of the bond. “You’ll be getting lunch soon too, but first we feed the dragon before he drives himself ‘round the twist.”
“Sir-”
“A dinner date?” John said, quiet as Sherlock, a bit of humor in his voice. Sherlock brought his hands to his face and let out a huff. John decided to take that moment to edge a little closer to Sherlock, shuffling across the blanket and moving the dim lantern out of the way. He came to rest next to him.
“I only wish to have a little chat.”
The both of them must have been much sleepier than they had thought. John was awakened by the sound of Sherlock’s alarm going off and for a brief moment he forgot where he was. In their sleep John had slunk down farther on to the log, or Sherlock had pulled him, and had wound up with his chin resting in the fluff of Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock was clinging to John as though John was a large teddy bear, long limbs wrapped around John and holding him to him with his head pillowed against Johns bicep.
Meanwhile in John’s mind he could feel Hyperion growing restless: the dragon, still resting and warm in his pit, knew that something was going on. An alert had gone up all over the Aerie and he was instantly worried for John.
“Sherlock?” John called, curious and a tiny bit worried, “you alright Sherlock?” Suddenly John felt embarrassment, a ragged shame filled bubble that was certainly not his own rising like the blush on a human’s face, and briefly John thought by some insane stretch Sherlock was projecting emotion without touching him, but that was impossible. Then John noticed the tiny tendril of yellow slipped out from under the edge of the door to barely touch him.
“Some months ago my brother disappeared from this aquarium. His attacker was never found but it is assumed that they were… fish-napping, as it were, when he discovered their operations and pursued them.”
“They’re not dead, are they?”
John thought.
“She is my queen!” Sherlock bellowed suddenly, the happiness melting from his face at the accusation. “She has been my daughter, my charge, for the last 23 years, and wants for nothing; do not presume to know a rider’s love after less than a month of knowing a bond,” Sherlock said imperiously, actually rising from his chair and towering over John.
“Dr Watson! Food delivery for Hyperion!” called a man’s voice. Hyperion’s head shot up, the bond instantly flooding with hunger. John was jolted out of the bonding stupor by the sudden single-minded surge of ‘food!’. Hyperion waited impatiently for John to move before he stiffly tucked his legs under himself and rolled his body upright for the first time since he’d laid down the day before.
Sherlock launched himself up to his feet and stumbled a step or two before turning to face John and smacking his hand down onto the rock for stability's sake. “Painted… fiberglass,” he crowed, patting the fake stone a few more times before stopping and looking down at his hand, “or maybe concrete,” he mumbled looking at the reddening palm of his hand from where he’d just slammed it down against the very solid surface with a little too much force.
“Well, er, stressful situations,” he lamely attempted as an excuse, while John slipped his shirt on and followed him with his own robe over his arm. John just huffed a quiet chuckle.
“No, they talk and I reward them for a job well done. Two weeks ago one made a royal mess of the pit while feeding Bell to the point I had to get the cleaners in to rake the sand, he still chattered away while he was doing it, but I gave him nothing in the end.” Sherlock explained.
So nothing in his pockets. Then Sherlock frowned. He'd overlooked something and that annoyed him greatly. “Who admitted him? Quickly.” The last was aimed at Molly who was still sitting down and just looking at him.
“Fine, I take back the idiot,” John huffed and proceeded over to slam a piece of paper on the desk in front of Sherlock. He also brought along a whiff of pub, which made Sherlock glance at his watch. Oh, more time had passed than he'd thought and John had gone to drown his anger at—not his favourite pub, wrong smell—but a pub on the way. There was a name and an address on the piece of paper.
“Grgglg,” Sherlock uttered and made a go on -motion with his hand.
Click.
Sherlock didn't have any idea what he was looking at but it wasn't something he was about to admit. John seemed alarmed. He didn't have such good experiences with strange laboratories.
“Not the killer,” Sherlock remarked over his shoulder to Lestrade and John, ignoring her comment. Face-recognition was unavoidable these days. “You were one of the first to move in, but not the first. Who was the first?” he demanded from the lady, bracing the cane between the door and the door jamb.
The place had gone through a change of employee shifts and was serving the breakfast rush when Lestrade finally made it there. Sherlock had closed his eyes, leaning against the window with his leg stretched out in front of him. The surroundings had melted into white noise, a skill Sherlock had honed to separate himself from the flow of unnecessary information that was ever-present. He was alerted back to himself when he heard John speak.
“I don't think we have that in our selection, I'm sorry.”
“I don't regret my decision,” Sherlock continued. “But you regret your indecision. That isn't my fault.”
“I'd be delighted.” Gibson clasped his hands together and nodded. “Follow me, please. I'll take you right to the heart of the operation. Truth to be told, I've been waiting to show it off to someone who'll understand the importance of my attempts.”
However, it didn't make John's argument make any more sense to Sherlock and he didn't really like John thinking he was that special (even if he was, obviously) because John loaded it with expectations that Sherlock never met. Not because he actively avoided meeting them, but because they originated from the hope that he'd suddenly transform into the idol John had placed on some sort of pedestal. It struck him John viewed him in much the same way as he did the whole of humanity—with a disappointed hope they'd see what they were capable of instead of wallowing in the worst of their nature.
Sherlock rolled up the piece he'd carved off the wall and put it in his pocket along with the magnifier, then grabbed the cane and started out of the room. John didn't take long to follow, though he did his ‘leaving a room’ check (windows, doors, people, lights, sharp objects) and turned off the light and closed the door while Sherlock was already on his way down the stairs.
John moved, slowly (like a glacier, or a tectonic plate), and bent down to kiss Sherlock on the upper lip. Then he pulled away. “Sorry,” he muttered, looking like he'd been caught with the last Jaffa cake while knowing very well that it was always reserved for Sherlock.
“Oh yes, I can show you the mechanics.” Gibson nodded and beamed at him again in a way that made him seem harmless, but nothing removed that determination Sherlock had first witnessed. John stood near the door, repeatedly gathering his hands into fists and releasing them—a preparatory nervous tic Sherlock had seen countless times. It helped John concentrate and stay on top of any mounting stress he might be feeling.
“Set it on the sink,” Sherlock finally said. The door wasn’t even locked and popped open upon testing. Steam and the smell of Sherlock’s soap filled John’s nostrils the moment he stuck his head through the door. He sat the mug on the edge of the sink for him and studiously tried not to look at the shower, not that he could see anything through their curtain but still, Sherlock was very much naked there.
“What has you in such a good mood?” Sherlock asked, as he covered John’s head and ruffled him as well.
Her email use my laptop SH
“Sherlock,” John replied weakly, clinging to his mate’s mind, wanting to wrap himself around Sherlock and hold on forever.
“I-I can’t climb, bum arm, see,” John flailed for an excuse not to get into that saddle, moving his injured arm and hissing as he rotated it too far and too fast and a spike of pain flashed through the shoulder. Bellamy’s head was curled back next to them in an instant. Sherlock bent and grabbed one of John’s legs forcing him to put a foot up,
“There you go, we’ll get you fitting in in no time. Now, this issue with bonding, that needs to be dealt with. Can’t feel too great to you or him, being separated like you’ve been.” Lestrade thumped him lightly on the back again, pulling him back towards Hyperion on still shaky legs. The initial clamour of people around the crate had subsided to just handful of workers around the lone container. As soon as John was close to Hyperion’s outstretched head he reached for him, fighting the urge to just fling himself onto that warm snout, and placed a  hand firmly between the nostrils and rubbed. Hyperion’s golden eyes slitted open, staring lazily at John as he let out a sigh and very subtly pushed into John’s hand. John looked up at Lestrade, a twinge of concern flitting across his heart.
John went upstairs and looked in the windows of the labs, looking for the dark-haired rider in one of them. All he found were a few people in lab coats working with various bits of equipment, running tests, going about their jobs in the hospital. He spotted Mike filling out some paperwork in a broom closet-sized office full of filing cabinets, the small rosy dragon he’d seen in Mike’s picture sitting curled up on a nearby cabinet.
“You are feeling insecure, don’t,” John spoke with his mind, projecting the equivalent of a hug through the light touch.
“No need to apologize, Dr Watson, We’ve seen all sorts of reactions to dragons and to flying here: the fainters, the screamers, the shaky and uncertain, we just handle each one as they come. They’ve got to fly to get to where they’re going eventually.” He said light-heartedly. That did make John feel a bit better.
“You can run if you want. We won’t hold it against you,” she told him quietly.
“Right, sorry.” John said, fumbling for what to say to make Sherlock not look like that anymore. They really should probably talk about it, just get the whole messy thing further out in the open so that if it came up Sherlock didn’t lock down like he’d just done. John knew already that what relationship the two had been in had been abusive at best and he honestly shouldn’t have included the pair in the list at all. The whole striking if Sherlock did something annoying part never ceased to make John’s blood boil when he thought about it, let alone the fact that he’d basically used Sherlock as a sex toy. If there had been any love between the two it seemed it had be entirely one sided and short lived.
John looked up at the smiling Master. “Yeah, Greg?” He said, hesitant. John had assumed Omar was just a particularly informal Master, not that they were all like that. He’d been expecting a stuffy, grey-haired posh man waiting to look down his nose at him at first sight. Yes, this man sported silver hair, but he had the same air as Omar did: a kind welcoming demeanor, hardly as sinister a figure as the title Master conjured in his head.
Once he sat down on the worn in sofa and began to really look at the rest of the room he didn’t stay down long; he felt he should at least tidy the place up, not remove or throw anything out but just neaten the stacks. He glanced upon papers with words like ‘venom’ and ‘corrosion’ or ‘suicide’ and ‘murder’ in them and decided it best not to read into whatever their contents were. Once John had cleaned as much as he could before he began to feel worried about upsetting his flatmate he took up his place on the sofa and relaxed, holding one of the squishy little exercise balls his therapist had given him. Hyperion was resting again on the other end of the bond, his anxiety for the most part gone, now that John was focusing on him and reassuring that he was perfectly fine in this odd new flat.
A swath of little dragons and young people sat to one side, close to where he stood, an older woman standing before them with her own much larger companion at her side. John didn’t see Lestrade immediately and so, after pulling out his mobile to tell him he was there and waiting, contented himself with watching the young riders helping their baby dragons with calisthenics.
I can't thank Nautilicious enough for being my beta.
Sherlock often simply trolled around in wide circles at the top of the tank once he was a fish. John couldn’t begin to guess what went on in his head during the tuna hours of the day. Considering John usually drifted off into space and daydreamed until he bumped into something, goodness knew what the massive brain of the detective got up to. But this time Sherlock actually changed his pattern a bit, he started circling down more in the level John stayed around. He started bumping into John and then Sherlock started actually nudging him like he had on John’s first day as a fish, only now John pushed back. There was no real friction in the pushing, when John nudged back into Sherlock’s side he slipped past him.
“The cabbie had a sponsor,” Sherlock replied, finally taking the small bite that waited on his spoon.
It was during their first class with Jim as the teacher that Sherlock interrupted the lesson in spectacular fashion.
“Bell tells me I must apologize,” John heard Sherlock say nearby. “I did not know…” Sherlock almost sounded like a child being made to say sorry by his mother. Bellamy let out a huffy snort above John and carefully let him go, pushing John away and back towards Sherlock with her knuckles, out of her cool shadow. The limp from Hyperion had returned with a vengeance and without his cane, John hobbled forward.
“Let’s walk John, we-we never walk much. Our feet. We have feet, we can use our feet and go for a walk.” It was at that moment John realized that the bottle of grappa, basically empty save for a miniscule portion in the bottom, was in Sherlock’s other hand, the bottle dragging on the floor as Sherlock shook John’s arm, “John, we should walk together.” Sherlock asserted again, with the same babbling, slurring, voice.
“Sherlock?” he said, now with a worried creasing of his face.
John cared and Sherlock was, for the lack of a better word, obsessed. He was good with obsessed, however. He knew obsessed, he'd been obsessed before.
It wasn't good enough. Sherlock murmured in pain and leaned over, favouring his leg. It was for show, but all shows had a bit of truth.
John was so easy to manipulate. He was like plasticine in Sherlock's hands. His needs and wants were simple like his mind, so easily fulfilled, almost enviable. Sherlock stared at John until John felt the weight of his eyes and looked up, curious.
“But my mesolimbic pathway,” Sherlock tried, tilting his head back. His lymph nodes were fine, but John refused to take his word for it and moved to palpitate under his arms.
In the end it was a cab that took them the thirty odd kilometres to the site and not a helicopter. Sherlock had given some serious thought about calling one when they were caught in a mid-morning rush (one of the downsides of residing mid-London). Their eventual approach to the site (many tedious years later, if one asked Sherlock) was marked by some dog-walkers from the nearby suburbia loitering around the edges of the police perimeter and Lestrade standing in the car lot waiting for them. There was an old priory building on the other side and some nature surrounding it, the target for the now denied dog-walkers.
Sherlock flapped his hand at John, trying to get his attention and make him wake up. “What a treat,” he intoned into his mobile.
“She's not done yet,” Sherlock uttered, staring at the monitor.
“No, but you’ve been completely silent for the last five days. What, did you get lost in that big head of yours?” John said, going back to the kitchen while Sherlock continued stretching.
“The location I used to use is both occupied currently and too cold,” Sherlock said short and sweet, neither divulging where he’d been doing it before or elaborating on how long he’d been at it, judging by some of the positions and levels of flexibility John had witnessed he assumed a longer amount of time than he’d known him.
The full set of claws suddenly were tracing down, scratching over John’s pectorals, clipping a nipple in their path on their way down his belly. Like a snake striking, those fingers darted for his most sensitive bits and found John’s bollocks. Nails dug into the tender flesh of his scrotum and John couldn’t begin to suppress the surprised and pained yelp that escaped his throat even as she tugged his balls in a cage-like grasp. “Maybe something more
“I’m fine,” John said out loud without thinking, Hyperion still heard it because it had to run through his mind before passing his lips, but still his hand went to his mouth fingers pressing to his lips in thought.
“Oh, poor dear,” Molly tutted, gently inspecting the angry red slash.
“How many of those does he get?” John asked curiously, wondering at the contents of the large white pill.
“Yes!” John laid a palm on Sherlock’s shoulder, “Its important to me that you want this”
After floating by a few times trying to read the news, Sherlock darted to John, fin flicking a short message,
“Hang on! Yes, there, sent, alright?” John replied holding the phone out of reach as Sherlock made to grab it out of his hand in his haste. “How do you even know that’s the killer’s number?”
“It’s all fine now though, just you saying things that make me question if you’re mortal like the rest of us now and then,” John said with a chuckle. Sherlock let out a low responding chortle.
“That wasn’t so hard was it?” she said to him, climbing down and moving towards John. “I’m sorry John, but I need to see his other side now, if you could get him to roll over for me?” She gave him a pleading look.
“You,” Sherlock’s mind pressed again. John could almost hear desperate panting behind the words even though there was no way for Sherlock’s voice to be truly out of breath.
“Did you have somewhere you needed to be Sherlock?” John called to him, making Sherlock actually turn to face him finally.
“Yes, to an extent,” Sherlock mumbled shuffling away and reaching for the carton of teabags, sliding them down the counter to John so that he could occupy himself with the task of making the tea again. Sherlock took the lid off their simmering dinner and gave it a perfunctory stir before leaving it again and moving as if to go to his room. John couldn’t stop himself.
They continued their wobbly way back towards their tank, John incredibly thankful that they had passed out close by, until they went through the door and he saw the stairs they had to climb to get to the top of the aquarium. It was slow going up the stairs, and John kept a very tight hold on Sherlock just in case. At the first rough squeeze from John’s arm around his waist keeping him from tripping headlong over the handrail Sherlock let out a low coo and John felt lips in his hair kissing at the top of his head.
John knew he was shouting, but after seeing her like that and Sherlock not seeming to care, it didn’t sit well with him, and the fact that he’d been the one thrown into the saddle very much against his will--he wanted Sherlock to know nothing was okay about the position he’d been put in.
“Well then, you’ve seen the sitting room now.”
“I have a bed.”
John noticed how she looked at Sherlock in a motherly way, looking up at him like Sherlock was a lost boy who’d finally come home with his only excuse being ‘I was off catching tadpoles and suddenly it was night time,’ but she did finally turn to John.
“What stops them from using that information against you?”
“Or maybe you want me to tie your legs down too?”  John ground out, leaning down and nipping at the pale flesh of Sherlock’s arse.
Suddenly a wall of bubbles crashed around them and John was looking up into a massive cast net, the weighted edges of which were quickly falling around them, forming a giant transparent dome like a jellyfish’s bell with Sherlock at its center. The net’s edges abruptly drew inwards and before Sherlock could turn and swim down towards John he was caught and hauled upwards by the sturdy nylon netting. John tried to grab at him, tried to catch the net and pull it back, but the person on the other end was stronger out of the water than John was under it.
John thought, looking up at the blurry shapes of their assailants through the agitation of waves. If all of them were up there--there could be the three that he had seen beyond the glass, there could be more--either way, he was screwed on numbers.
“Not going to be sick,” John replied, only mildly offended that Sherlock would think now would be the time for John to let it happen rather than up in the air when his stomach had tried to live in his throat. But he couldn’t be too offended after all it did sound like there was some amount of concern there. “Just need to wash my face.” John added starting the trudge in the direction Sherlock had pointed in, towards the walls of the Aerie where a few buildings lined the base near the gate.
“Dinner, then?” Sherlock had said, making John’s eyebrows rise. It wasn’t often Sherlock cooked. Not that he couldn’t, he just couldn’t be arsed to. He’d hung up his scarf and coat and strode off towards the kitchen leaving John muzzy and mildly confused in his wake.
“There you go, that’s a good boy,” John murmured quietly, petting the soft scales below a large eye. “Now, roll over, just for me, don’t think about her; I just want to see your belly,” John instructed, still thinking calm thoughts, in case that was actually helping Hyperion in any way. The pupil above him widened slightly as Hyperion relaxed; the hissing and huffing subsided, though his tongue continued to flicker out, bowing in Molly’s direction, scenting her out. John hooked his hand under Hyperion’s jaw, trying to get a handhold so he could tug at him; there was no way he was moving Hyperion’s big head with only one arm available but the motion should get him moving in the right direction. Hyperion cautiously followed, extending his neck, uncurling his tail from around his body, and almost as if in slow motion, rolling back onto his right side, exposing his belly and stretching his limbs out, his left wing rolling open a little behind him to show the whole of his left side.
“No, no, he gets fed at home. The butchers give me his food to keep in the freezer and thaw out through the week. He eats so often and his type have a bit more variation to their diets than the big ones like your Hyperion. No, he just likes to come with me, get out of the house you know,” she said casting a fond glance down at Angus who was curled up in a tight ball next to her shins.
“Y-y-yes,” came a very shaky answer, that broke the silence. “I-I don’t know where I am. I c-can’t move. Oh God, I need Sherlock Holmes, help me!” The woman’s voice on the other end devolved into panicked sobbing before she could say any more. The crying didn’t last long though, John heard her suddenly inhale, trying to hold it in, and then she spoke again "St-stop… Stop crying, read the w-words you-you st-stupid cow.”
Lestrade already had someone on the other end of the phone but he offered John a smile and a thumbs up. John left the Master to his calls.
John stopped struggling the moment he got a good look at the man’s face, long and far too pale with a very faint silvery sheen to his skin, under a wet, curly mop of dark hair. His ice blue eyes were wide, staring down at John as he panted, searching, studying him. It was his neck that made John freeze: there were gills open on both sides of the man’s neck, honest to god gills flexing with every breath. John’s eyes widened.
Sherlock let him go at the slight pull away and there they were again standing near each other, the conversation about Jim forgotten for now. If John didn’t know better he’d almost say he saw a little blushing on Sherlock’s face.
John added the requested ingredients, having taken the time earlier to find the sugar tucked among the beakers in a cabinet next to an empty box of tea. “Well. Best be off,” Mike stopped one last time on his way out the door, looking into the sitting room, “Sherlock, try not to get into trouble again for a while,” he called into the sitting room only to gain a, “hmm,” in response. And with that, the last remotely normal person left, leaving John with a pair of mugs and a strange person in his sitting room, their sitting room. It was Sherlock’s first, technically, going by the sheer amount of clutter.
“I like all of you, you git,” John cut him off before he could go into further observations. “Yes, I do find you handsome too, and yes I’ve looked, kind of hard not to when you spend a portion of your time in the buff every morning and night,” John added, softening the admission a bit more after calling him a git.
“Get the hell off me and maybe I will,” Sherlock panted after another round, his face red.
And then other people appeared, crawling from the other aquarium tanks nearby to stand wobbling against the railing. The agents who had been captured, and several more people emerged, looking around lost and confused.
“I’m sorry, Hyperion, but others need to use the pool too,” John said, rubbing the nearest shoulder he could reach. Hyperion reluctantly rolled back to his belly and dove again, submerging himself entirely and moving towards the deeper end. John could feel the mild petulance across the bond, the dragon trying to prolong getting out.
Sherlock said nothing during the break, just fiddled with his phone like usual. John left him to his thoughts and rounded up the children to return at the usual time they would go back, for lack of anywhere else to go.
And move he did. The moment John gave him the go, he started to rock his hips up, John just kneeling and letting him thrust up into him as he started skating hands over Sherlock’s chest, playing with nipples more sensitive than his own, scrubbing hands down his neck over his gills, leaving light red trails with his nails over Sherlock’s pale pectorals and ribs. Until Sherlock gave a particularly hard buck that managed to hit his prostate just right and John let out a low moan, rocking back to meet the thrusts now to try and hit that again.
John laid his hand on her nose finally. She was warm, but not in the same way as Hyperion, she was a fiery warm, but the feeling didn’t travel up his arm or suffuse his body and mind like when he was in contact with Hyperion. It was that moment John realized he couldn’t begin to know what she was thinking. Hyperion was an open book to him every movement, every little twitch of his face easily readable. Staring into Bellamy’s blue eyes John realized she was about as big of a mystery to him as her rider still was. John had no practice reading dragon body language outside of the bond with Hyperion. Angus had been easy; he was small and his frills helped in reading him like signal flags. Bellamy seemed to like John, if anything she was curious about him, but any other interpretations beyond that would be an absolute stab in the dark.
“Well, frankly yes, Jim is, well, he’s Jim it just seems so…” John couldn’t think of a word to describe how strange that interaction had seemed.
A small part of John really wished he knew what she was telling him because it was very obvious she was talking to him. He got the distinct impression that from the movements she was making she was pushing them together, like Harry had done with her dolls as a kid ‘you two go together now kiss!’ he remembered. John chuckled at that and finally did as Bellamy wanted, he closed the space between them and leaned into Sherlock, wrapping his arms around his thin chest in a hug.
Bellamy landed near Hyperion, with a few strong wing beats she brought her hind legs down and softly set herself down on the grass. John was already thinking of a way to thank her for the kindness of such a painstakingly smooth flight, the take off, flight, and landing had all been the gentlest John had ever experienced and he was immensely grateful for that. Hyperion pushed a boost of positive agreement at that thought,
“John, no,” John heard another voice rasp nearby, Sherlock. He sounded awful and John instantly tried to twist to find him, not caring about the torment being inflicted by Jim’s claws.
like this?’ John failed to see how it could be a bad thing.
“Flying, of course. Don’t be dim John,”
“Wow,” John said dumbly, stopping to stare out the floor to ceiling window. “Look at that.” Even though they were high off the ground, John couldn’t help but draw a little closer to the window to look at the glowing labyrinthine structure sprawling around them. It was no skyscraper, they were still close enough to the ground that John could see the crew teams working down on the field with the dragons, but the tower rose high enough above the walls to see the whole Aerie, if a dragon were to take flight out on the training grounds the occupants of the tower could see it, same went for the pits in the distance, all of which were covered but many were lit from beneath to create lines of giant luminous spots in the dark. John could even see the lit and gleaming structure of the roof of the cafeteria in the distance. A black gloved hand suddenly shot across the view.
John felt that Sherlock might be up to something just before they transformed for the day. For the first time he could remember he woke up and Sherlock was not wrapped around him like a starfish on a rock. He wasn’t left to wonder where he’d gone for long though, since Sherlock appeared at his side, shaking his shoulder and telling him the watch had gone off. And so John simply shrugged off the disappearance as Sherlock being Sherlock and followed him to their tank, sharing their usual morning kisses over discarded clothes before sinking into the water for the day.
Sherlock hummed an assent and went to the chest of drawers against the wall, pulling out a couple of pairs of neatly folded and rolled pyjama bottoms. They undressed the rest of the way in silence, both stripping and each donning a pair of bottoms. They didn’t fit John well, being too long in the legs, but they were soft and comfortable and that was all that really mattered.
“I, er, How?” John stuttered not entirely sure if he should admit to that and wrong-footed by Sherlock’s sudden conclusion. Sherlock grabbed his right hand, pulling it up to his face for inspection, even going so far as to smell him, before John could yank it away.
They would come out of their tank at nine ‘o clock every night, the transformation coming easier and easier for John with each night. Sherlock would help John out of the tank and wait for him to get dressed because he was still always the first one out. At some point along the line Sherlock began helping John dry off, and John helped dry Sherlock’s curly hair.
John prodded the bond at about the same time he said, “Hyperion?”
Next to a row of dumpsters sat an open huge pink rolling suitcase, Bellamy sitting in the small courtyard nearby with her head near the reeking garbage cans. The horrific part wasn’t the open case, it was what lay inside. Inside sat a broken egg, and a baby dragon roughly the size of Angus lay amongst broken pieces shell and yellowish goo. The slime from the egg was everywhere. Thin threads of what looked like blood mixed with clear fluid overflowed the case and spilled across the ground. The hatchling’s long, thin, neck flopped out to lie on the concrete, small-toothed mouth and pale white eyes open. It was still alive. It’s chest was heaving away, body still curled in the remains of egg in the case.
?” Sherlock suddenly snorted a laugh. “Yes, let's.” He continued to giggle, making John’s smile grow while he grabbed more lube for his fingers.
“Look at the size of the case. There was room enough for two eggs with padding. The killer noticed that the case was leaking, opened it up to find one of the eggs was broken, decided to take the other one and leave the ‘bad’ one to rot.” Sherlock said, gesturing at the suitcase as he talked.
“Oi, she just asked a question.” He shuffled towards them and they all scattered back from the door. John braced his good arm on the edge and looked down at the girl sitting on the ground.
Lestrade showed him to the butchers, which he proclaimed was one of the most important parts of the Aerie. The first thing John noticed upon entering the large swinging doors marked with large signs reading ‘No Dragons beyond this point’ was that the building was spotless. When John had imagined a butchery the size that would be needed for a place as gigantic as London Aerie, his mind had conjured a dank smelly place covered in blood and entrails of slaughtered animals, the smell of death featuring prominently in his mental construct.
Thank you so much justaphage and nautilicious for betaing this chapter.
“Never really says much, just shows up and says the war is going well, and disappears again,” John mused, looking up at the large red and gold insignia bearing a sword that decorated the large doors in the area.
“You’ve ridden outside of one of those boxes?” John asked.
“Why would I do that?” Sherlock replied
John helped Sherlock lift the bundle that was the hatchling, Sherlock carrying the bulk of it. They bundled it into the back seat of the black car waiting for them, and John stayed while Sherlock bounded off to grab his coat and the suitcase, zipped closed but still somewhat oozing egg fluid as Sherlock rolled it along.
“Already called, said the boy was on his way.”
Lestrade knew what the gesture meant, Mollisians and their touches. A firm hold like the one Mycroft gave him then was nearly like a human kiss on the lips. There were stories of some of the first human-mollisian contact, and the introduction of a handshake had seemed scandalous to them until they learned that humans didn’t transfer emotions or thoughts or colors through touch like they did. Lestrade knew what a Mollisian handshake felt like -  a barely there, limp, meeting of human skin and soft appendage. This was not it.
Dinner was simple pasta and tomato sauce. He watched a little crap telly for the first time in a long while, not really paying much attention to it as the sun went down and the yellowish glow of street lamps outside glowed through the tall windows. John decided to head to bed not long after, the tv turned off and all the lights out save the dimmer ones in the kitchen just in case his mysteriously absent flatmate showed up at the wee hours of the morning. He yelled down a good night to Mrs Hudson and was met with a croak from Angus and a faint good night from his keeper.
Sally was right, though; John did have to leave Hyperion’s side eventually, that was the point of the bonding: to build a strong bond quickly so that the dragon wouldn’t be alone even if the rider wasn’t right by his side. John looked up at Hyperion’s startled eye. “I do have to go but I’ll come back, you know I will, and we’ve got this,” John said, knocking against his head with a small smile, pushing comfort and calm and safety across the bond to him to emphasize the point. John understood why Hyperion was so distressed. Having Victor die had been so traumatic; he wanted reassurance that his new rider wouldn’t perish as well.
“Huh,” John said, not really having much to add, “Well… I guess I can’t stay mad at you, you didn’t exactly ask for this either, and we’re sort of stuck here till we figure this out.” John absentmindedly put his hand down on Sherlock’s calf, rubbing his shin through the pyjama bottoms.
“Mr Moriarty isn’t going to be happy for the rest of the day now probably,” Mary said, sitting at lunch.
“You don’t mean that,” John said quietly. After all the shouting he felt the need to match the stillness in the flat.
“What’s your name?” John asked.
Once snug in his own warm bed John let himself relax back into the pillows. So much to mull over from the evening. It was late he and should be asleep, but his mind wanted to wander over the various revelations of the evening and his body wanted Sherlock close again. All those little things that had driven John to distraction that had formed his wank fantasies for the past few months had been intended or at least partially intended. The images both real and slightly exaggerated by imagination popped forth. Sherlock in a tiny towel, just barely covering anything. His leather clad backside, the thin covering stretched tight across his arse. The yoga poses, John’s mind’s eye undressed him as he bent into what he’d later learned was a standing straddle pose, legs spread in a wide V as he bent his torso forward and down. Sherlock’s long legs stretched out before him as he leaned back on the bench nearby the first day they were meant to meet with the Masters, looking like a bad boy waiting to meet the school dean.
“Hyperion, this what you are, right?” John asked, and Hyperion opened his eyes and shifted to look. A resounding ‘Yes’ thundered over John’s mind accompanied by joy, joy at John’s interest in learning about him.
The next morning the sound of the door opening and thudding closed followed by the scrape of wheels across the floor woke John. His first thought darted to having overslept and the wheels were Tom and Mary coming to feed Hyperion, but the dragon lay curled and sleeping soundly right next to him, and there had been no accompanying knock or call asking for entry. Whoever this was had just barged on in unannounced.
As he re-entered the flat he saw Sherlock returning a box to a spot hidden under the edge of the sofa.
“John,” Sherlock began quietly, sliding a little closer to him across the seat.
“Don’t apologize, not for this,” John murmured rocking his shivery lover and stroking his arms, thankful to have him mentally back in the flat and talking again.
like you” John’s eyes raked over Sherlock’s riding gear, all tight and form fitting as always. With his knees drawn up to his chin John got a lovely view of the curves of his thighs and calves pressed into tight, two toned leather, patterned as though it was made to make him look even sexier at every angle. John licked his lips and looked away back to the screen.
“No, I haven’t, do you have any pictures of them?” John absentmindedly asked, dragon riders weren’t known for having families as far as he was aware, maybe this one was a rare exception, and in that case he felt sorry for the soon to be widowed mother.
“Oh, he ran off to use the public bath didn’t he?” John caught on quickly. “Well I didn’t want to leave you alone that long. Am I really that shocking?” He asked, slowly shuffling closer to the edge of the fountain to conceal himself against the wall. “Or is it you’ve just never seen a naked human before?” A negative darted across the bond quickly followed by a positive as Hyperion tried to answer the questions. John caught a faint flicker of an image in his mind: man pulling clothes tight, adding to them, cold, no, concealed, loving, friendly, but private. Contact, body warmth in hands, and face, and… feet? Maybe, rarely though.
The world listed disturbingly as John was lifted and put back in the tank again. If anything the clear glass boundaries provided a miniscule modicum of comfort to John’s panicked mind as they along with the bag gave him some sense of a skin. The larger dose of the drug made John feel like he had no skin at all. Forget melting, he felt like he was dissolving; like a strong acid had been injected into him and it was gnawing through his exterior layers. It felt like at any moment he could look down on himself and only see his innards, contained only by a membrane of plastic, before he went blind all together as the last of his skin dissolved away.
“Do you want to hear a case or not?” Sherlock huffed.
“So…” John started again, trying to muster up the right words to ask.
“Kosovo,” Sherlock confirmed, and John could hear the sadness in his voice, didn’t want to hear that level of upset there, “was there for a month, got shot out of the sky over a minefield, his dragon rolled through the field, of course neither of them survived.” Sherlock nudged infinitesimally closer to John, who in turn hugged his waist a little tighter.
“I know what it is, Sherlock,” John replied after a deep breath. “I was in the Army, remember?”
With a gentle mental poke at the bond John checked on Hyperion, who was still sound asleep. He fixed the bed from where the sheets had become tangled earlier and tried to join him in sleep, but instead lay awake wondering what to do about the unusual man downstairs until he finally slipped off.
“I picked the lock,” he whispered as though there were others in the room who could hear his mind’s voice confessing not just John. “If they analyze the back door’s handle they’d find residue from me on it and inside the locking mechanism.”
A sudden gust at the top of the tower got under John’s collar and reminded him of how cold it was outside, the tip of his nose was growing number as were his ears, lovely as the whole scene was, even the little portable heater behind them wasn’t quite enough to combat the frigid weather forever. John was just about to suggest they go back inside, time to go home for the night.
“Then what do you call that thing you were climbing on?” John asked with a huff.
“That’s not the point, Sherlock, its the violation of privacy. I respect yours, you said no touching your room and I haven’t touched it. I expected the same courtesy for my things.” John couldn’t help but feel a little angry at the fact that apparently the ‘no disturbing each other’s rooms’ rule only applied to Sherlock’s things.
“So?” Sherlock replied, voice low.
“It’s the post; the delivery boy always holds the bell a few seconds too long. Mrs Hudson was waiting for something to come from her pen pal in Amsterdam, has been now for the last day or so,” Sherlock said, finally stretching out along the the sofa with a sigh. John stood in the doorway a moment watching Sherlock’s toes flex on the nearby arm. The rider gave another good stretch before settling with one arm still protecting his belly and the other flung dramatically over his eyes.
Mycroft sighed, “Dr Watson will be accompanying you, protect him at all costs he is rather dear to my brother,” he ordered as the rotor blades began to turn, the engine revving and beginning to make the deafening noise that drowned out anything other than shouting. Everyone in the helicopter threw up an 'okay' hand sign as the roaring of the engine and spinning blades grew louder. John watched as Mycroft backed away and they became airborne, the helipad and the Thames dropping away below them and the London skyline appearing, pilots already following Sherlock’s tracking chip and heading south.
“You bribe them,” John said, not sure how he felt about that, rather than Sherlock giving out of kindness to the kids.
“I’m sorry John,” Sherlock repeated sounding so very sincere, cuddling John close as possible. John could feel the fear squirming in Sherlock’s mind. Now that John was safely back at Baker Street the emotions that Sherlock had no doubt been suppressing were starting to show. Fear was one of the many that played across Sherlock’s mind, but it was certainly becoming the most prominent as time passed between them.
“Mmm, yes we do,” Sherlock replied tracing his fingers out and down one of John’s arms to entwine their slick fingers with a bit of a squelch that shouldn’t have been nearly as erotic as it was as he realized the implication.
“Is that all? Not a very critical approach.” Then again, Molly had fancied Moriarty, she was clearly lacking in the critical department. Or she was just desperate.
“I don't think putting both of us at risk of never getting out of the water is a good idea,” John said more quietly, but he moved aside when he had the phone securely in hand.
Sherlock didn't even know where to begin. First of all, he wasn't allowed to do locked room experiments on anyone (except once he locked John up into his room and had received several days' worth of silence in return, which was just as well). Second, he had realised who they were after was most likely a psychopath, which was as tedious as cases could get. And it had been so promising at the start. He was quite put off.
He felt John's eyes on him and turned his head a fraction to look at him. John's face was still obscured by the light shining behind him so Sherlock couldn't see his expression clearly. It made his stomach churn suddenly and he struck across John to turn the light towards the wall. John leaned back to let him but also put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder.
By now Scotland Yard would have frozen her accounts, pulled her customer info, gone through her place, and they'd still have nothing. There would be a place, a project, maybe a renovation in the works, nothing urgent, somewhere she could set up. Sherlock needed to get his hands on the customer list. He made a grabby hand motion at John, who had removed the IV and was standing there, rolling up the rubber tubing.
“And yet evolution hasn't made them the dominant type of people.”
But John ignored his opinion and went to the sofa, patting the crying girl's shoulder awkwardly. “Er, miss..?”
“She took me,” he tried to explain, looking desperate. “She took me again!” he cried. “She did all those things! It wasn't me! You have to stop her! She'll take me again!”
“Cut.” Sherlock pointed at a section of the fence that was shadowed by the building itself and another next to it.
But none of that was really the problem. Lying there Sherlock could only think of two things: 1) he wanted John, 2) he wanted interesting cases. Not necessarily in that order. Or even separately. He had both of those things to a degree, but not to the degree he wanted them. The fact remained that he loved being obsessed and John allowed him that, even when it came to being obsessed with John. Even when it came to being obsessed with cases first.
“Talk about
. Because that'd exonerate
“I'm on my way.” Sherlock had already gained his feet and went to grab his coat. The manuscript and its inscrutable contents could wait. At least a little while. The murder of a murder suspect took precedence.
“John,” he said thickly, forcing co-operation from his tongue. John looked at him, surprised, a furrow between his brows. “I know where.” It was all he could say, but John understood. He stood up straighter, gained that soldier bearing.
John pulled back a bit and squinted at Sherlock's face. “Yeah, you're still thinking,” he muttered. “Never stops, does it?”
It took a few milliseconds longer than usual for Sherlock to understand the words after hearing them; he felt extremely slow and heavy.
“John, the temperature, what is the room temperature here?” Sherlock was hoping he could find potassium permanganate to combine with the glycerine in the hand-sanitiser to create fire. KMnO4 was not a rare compound and was used it water treatment, he thought it was completely plausible he could find some here.
John stood over him, one hand outstretched. Apparently horrified that Sherlock should possess the ability to make fire.
The dulcet tones of a cranky John Watson heralded his arrival some time later. “You are a giant bag of dicks,” he declared. “And an idiot.”
“Yes,” Sherlock affirmed, getting out of bed to grab a fresh suit out of his wardrobe. “Where?”
That was everything to some people. “And others? What do they have to offer?” Sherlock resisted the urge to rub his eyes.
“There's th-” John began, but was interrupted by Sherlock sitting on him. It was not very comfortable wedged between the desk and John (the edge of the desk bit into his side), but Sherlock ignored it, taking delight in John's utterly shocked expression.
The pages following the equations and notes were typed pages with familiar medieval illustrations tacked on. The Voynich manuscript, the very thing Sherlock had struggled to translate, was laid bare. (And he felt briefly bitter towards the doctor for taking away the most interesting case he'd had for a while as well as the mystery of the manuscript.) The binder didn't include the whole manuscript but only a part of it dealing with the particulars of teleportation and time travel. It must have been the source the doctor had followed in his experimentation and perhaps the manuscript provided many such sources for experiments in different disciplines. And these experiments clearly weren't sanctioned by any public group.
A shower, a change of clothes, a reapplication of nicotine patches, a quick sweep through the flat to hide the original of the two books (so Mycroft's men hadn't been there yet), and a back-up mobile later (because not only was the battery empty, but it was now also very likely bugged by Mycroft) he was on the way to Barts. He swung by the pathology lab to see Molly, who looked tired and startled.
The first thing Sherlock did was to go and open the wardrobe, then he ran his hand over all of John's jumpers and cardigans, he rearranged the socks and removed the button-up shirt with the tiny grey gingham pattern that he hated because it distracted his eyes. He picked up a soft and worn cardigan and managed to pull it on (experiment) despite his crutches. Then he approached the bed.
Sherlock stood up too and arrested John's departure by placing his hands on John's shoulders. Perhaps he didn't understand many of the things Sherlock said or did but he did have a singular understanding of Sherlock himself as counter-intuitive as that was. “John,” he said.
“Yes,” Sherlock said after snatching up his mobile. The voice on the other end was slightly gravelly but also affable.
“Yes, let's. Wait here, John.”
While the thought that followed on the heels of those words was vastly intriguing and deserved a lot of study, but not until what needed to be said was said. “Are you even a real doctor? It wouldn't RUPTURE.”
“Will the answer be the same if I ask our esteemed doctor the same?” Mycroft also stood up.
“To the tip.”
“That's all I needed.” Sherlock nodded and settled back down, taking out his mobile to overview the texts Lestrade had sent him about looking for the murderer outside the locked room.
“He got really upset,” Lestrade cut in. “Started shaking and saying he was innocent.” He paused. “He said he hadn't done any of it, that his- his body had been stolen.”
Sherlock picked up a piece of toast and dipped it in some egg yolk before gnawing on the corner of it. “I must find out how to infiltrate this secret society.”
The yellow wall-paper boiled with movement when Sherlock looked at it. Seeing all of it, every wall covered, with no visual distractions, was like a punch to the eyes. Sherlock approached it and laid his hand flat on it, glad he wore gloves. Then he leaned in and sniffed it.
“Why don't you admit you're attracted to me?” Sherlock snapped back, making John grunt and twist so he could glare at Sherlock.
Mycroft turned to look at him with that face that either meant concern or constipation (Sherlock always got those mixed up.) “You're mixing with the wrong crowd,” Mycroft said.
“Stop scaring the help,” John admonished him, quiet now, having braced Sherlock in the crook of his elbow, wiping some of the blood off his chin. “Look, you can go to your mind palace. I'll take care of things here.” He paused and then smiled. “Go and find out how many cars the Stig has taken around the Top Gear test track as of the end of the 18th season. I know you listen in when I watch it, in case you have to tell super cars apart some day. Oh, and tell me the top five and their times when you get back.”
“What do you think of ‘The Visitor’ for a title?” John asked instead, showing his aggressive unimpressed-ness.
“Time travel!” he almost shouted. “What you're doing is MURDER!”
Their return and resettlement at 221B after a disappointing look-around in Gibson's study was only interrupted by Lestrade ringing John and demanding (because he was talking to John and not Sherlock) to know what was going on and who was he going to pin for the murder. Sherlock refused to say anything because it would be admitting he didn't know anything but left John to convey that in a humane way.
“J-John,” Sherlock croaked, reaching towards the light which slowly radiated into a halo around a shape standing in the doorway.
“I have a theory,” Sally Donovan was standing on the other side of the box, looking at Sherlock. This type of interruption was the reason why John was invaluable. He was a social buffer.
“Brilliant,” John cut him off bluntly (rather uncharacteristic of him). “I'm going out.” He gave the back of Sherlock's neck a brush with his thumb and then took his hand away. Sherlock said nothing but he did notice the weight of John's hand disappearing and he was vaguely aware of John leaving the flat after that.
“Yes, and avoiding the question,” Sherlock said. He was staring at John's face, trying to bore into his head with his eyes. Epidermis, dermis, hypodermis, procerus muscle, periosteum, compact bone, endosteum-
“Uh huh,” John nodded, not looking. “How did he force that hand down his throat?” He was looking at the man's face. “His mouth's torn at the corners, I guess that's how. He choked to death because he couldn't swallow it. That's a terrible- a terribly specific way of dying. Choking to death on a severed hand. How did he even come across it?”
It was difficult for him to see the whole of human faces, not because he had prosopagnosia but because he tended to hyperfocus on the minutiae of everything he saw. Micro-expressions became visible, but the macro-entity became blurred. Still pictures were easiest because eventually the flow of information stopped. Even so he enjoyed watching John's face very much, every tiny twitch and thought that crossed his features.
But Sherlock didn't have a way to verify the ideas presented in the text so his translation fervour waned and he ended up sitting back in the chair and staring at the pages with a frown. The information alone wasn't dangerous because very few people had the mental acuity and the resources to study them further. And, perhaps more importantly, the moral stance that permitted human experimentation. The danger was in societies like the Explorers who clearly sought out individuals with the abilities and capabilities required and then provided them with the resources (including the test subjects). And thus they ended with people like Dr Gibson and Miss Price, who were able to take the ideas and expand on them. Or try to. So obviously they would be interested in Sherlock. His growing public figure (unfortunately) and his part in the case against the late Miss Price would've brought him to their attention. If he hadn't already been noticed before.
Lestrade shrugged. He was uncomfortable with the whole thing. He was a solid detective—when it came to ordinary crime. “You keep telling me that the mind is a powerful tool. For or against a person.”
“Ah, yes. Coming out. Your favourite new pastime,” Mycroft needled back, at which Sherlock snorted. Unimaginative.
“You can't grade impossibility, either it is or it isn't,” Sherlock muttered. John wasn't keeping with any known pattern of relationship progress, either, and it bothered Sherlock. He had become accustomed to using John as a gauge for the natural progression of everything.
John had an expression which Sherlock realised with a lurch of his heart was adoration. An expression saying he was looking at something amazing. Sherlock liked it when he could see the proof of that adoration on John's face even if he knew it existed when he couldn't as well. He'd realised that knowledge wasn't always enough, which was a whole other sinkhole to fall into. Knowing was supposed to be better than feeling.
The space behind wasn't big, but it was a room. The disc of light from John's torch was fixed on the far wall as he stood by the hatch. “Careful,” he muttered and helped Sherlock up. “It looks like she did research here. Or something. There's a cabinet in that corner and a door in the other.” He pointed the light at them, one after another.
That was John. More worried about losing a soldier than seeing a ghost. Or whatever people liked to call these energy manifestations that were clearly around, but yet people actively ignored them and denied their existence. The human mind was such a hive of paradoxes. It was fascinating.
Sherlock moved to inspect the crate. The outside was stained with mud and the inside was stained with a few droplets of blood, but it was otherwise in fairly good condition. The wood was darker on the outside, meaning it'd been exposed to sunlight for a relatively long time prior to being used as a body dump. Other than that there was nothing remarkable about it. There was a collection of dust at the bottom with a few larger pieces of dry and brittle paper. So it had been used as a storage container as it was meant.
“It was quite quiet that day, so I heard it over in the office when that man suddenly laughed. He'd been asleep just a few minutes earlier, so I got up to check on him and saw a man in civilian clothing bending over his bed, his back to me. No civilians in the base so I approached them and asked for the man to identify himself. He didn't make any reply and just walked out. I followed, but once I got out of the building I didn't see him anywhere. The layout of the base was very open and it was in the middle of a sunny day, and there was nowhere he could have gone in the few seconds it took for me to get out behind him.”
It was bright enough for Sherlock to first close his eyes and then open them. A lamp was shining into his face. John's reading light. He closed his eyes again but there was no darkness, just the light becoming red through his eyelids.
“John,” he said again, withdrawing back into his own space. John squeezed his knee in response but said nothing. And again it engaged Sherlock's interest. Their differences were vast, both physical and psychological, and sometimes too vast to bridge in any meaningful way. But it had turned out it was enough they shared one thing: a sense of adventure.
“Is future not typically discussed along with commitment?” Sherlock questioned.
“Only if you promise to turn over everything you have regarding the house, the dead man in it, the dead man's hand, and the man killed by said hand.”
not electronically). There was an actual lock on it. “Let's circle around.”
He pulled Sherlock up and acted as a crutch (he was the right size) to get Sherlock to the bathroom and sat him on the toilet seat, starting the water in the bath. He knelt to help the soft cast off Sherlock's foot.
“Yes. Let me watch the security tape.” Sherlock headed out of the room. “Get the corpse to an ME. John, go with the body and find out everything you can.”
. And then it was only an old woman with neurological issues. It was such a let-down, such a disappointment, such a boring reality.
The voice came from the doorway and Sherlock turned slowly to look Miss Price in the eye again. She had a gun, a real one this time, not a taser.
“But you're also routinely unpredictable.”
“I'll get you up tomorrow morning,” he whispered.
“I swear to God, Sherlock, one day I WILL shoot you,” he muttered, standing in the middle of the corridor outside the loo. “What the hell do you want?”
John lifted his head, wearing the question on his face, then blinked. “Oh God, Sherlock. What did you do now?” He got up and walked across the rug (silent, he wore woollen socks when he felt ill) and came to stand in front of Sherlock, looking up at him with a frown. “Your eye's almost swollen shut.”
“Oh, God.” John was cringing. “That- that's horrible.”
“OF COURSE it is,” Sherlock snapped immediately. “Stop trying to psychoanalyse his twisted idea of familial duties and hang up!”
Sherlock had decided on a different course on caring than Mycroft because of John. It was all right, even desirable, to let OTHER people care. It made them predictable. It had made Sherlock's stumble of faith possible in front of the killer's gun. He knew what John was capable of, but more than that, he knew what John was willing to do, and most importantly, he knew for whom John was willing to do almost anything. Because John cared. It was useful and satisfying, and it was something amazing.
“Imagine that.” John yawned (pointedly), but Sherlock wasn't a social animal so it didn't catch. “What's next?”
“Those are synonyms, not elaboration.”
“Of a romance?” John heaved a deep breath and looked at Sherlock as though it came as news to him they were in a romance. “Yeah, it is,” John said then and as the surprise of the question diminished an expression of satisfaction slowly replaced it. “Yeah,” he repeated with more force and grasped Sherlock's elbow, squeezing it. “We're in the honeymoon phase. I hadn't thought of that.”
“Do you need a hand?” John asked the girl, reaching towards her, but that was when she pulled out her mobile. It was also pink and set with rhinestones. A small object on a piece of cord was attached to it, and it seemed to be in the shape of a tiny high-heeled shoe.
John rolled his eyes. “Of course. Makes sense. Yeah. When do you have the time to read all these studies?”
“Let them in,” Sherlock said, wondering why Mrs Hudson hadn't gone to John with this. John was the user interface.
“Fine, then at least let me sleep.”
“Oh, for God's sake,” Sherlock snorted and sat on the bed without being invited to do so. He never got invited to do anything, really, so he'd learned the habit of not waiting for an invitation. “I didn't dose you with anything, I'm just bored. How can you still not see, feel or realise when you've been poisoned or drugged?”
“Agreed?” John was looking at him, serious, but with a little twitch of his lips that showed he knew exactly what Sherlock was thinking and was appreciative of his self-control. “Sherlock?”
“Suspend this,” Sherlock muttered, which made John laugh shortly, tired. “You assumed that because I left this morning it had something to do with the case, which was... not the case.”
“Cannibalism isn't illegal in the UK,” he said to cover up his ambivalent moment.
“Tea?” John asked then and Sherlock found they'd arrived back at 221B again. He was stood in the doorway and facing the sitting room, still wearing his coat. John was already in the kitchen making the tea (so a reply was unnecessary as it was forthcoming anyway). Sherlock slowly took off his coat and proceeded into the sitting room. It was still early-to-mid-morning. The case had been much less of a challenge than Sherlock had expected, which was the whole reason for his current disenchantment with the world.
He got dressed, pausing only to check the news again, then ran back upstairs because John hadn't showed up. It turned out John was still in bed, curled up around his pillow, trying to keep sleeping. Sherlock wasn't going to let that happen. He went to John's closet and pulled out random clothes, throwing them at him.
Molly had ruled severe hypoxia as cause of death, based on oxygen levels in blood, brain tissue and heart tissue. The curious part was that she'd found no obvious signs of what had caused said hypoxia. She hadn't been strangled or drowned which were the usual causes. It was like she had just stopped breathing.
“I have nothing to do with the SIS,” Mycroft sighed. “I don't understand why you keep perpetuating that myth to yourself and the rest of the world.”
The silence stretched as Sherlock absorbed the information. He, though often misunderstood in this particular area, didn't consider the paranormal or supernatural impossible. In fact, that was part of the misunderstanding; he didn't consider anything paranormal or supernatural. Explanations could be found, if one was intelligent enough to admit that the explanation could be something outside the norm.
Sherlock shone the light through the hole. “I'm coming down there,” he said. It wasn't a rational choice. The odds were he would have been better off without getting them both wet in a hole under the ground where there was no guarantee of an exit. It wasn't rational, no, but he could still rationalise it. John was down there. John had no light. John was at risk of hypothermia. It was an impairment of reason that led to cognitive dissonance, but he felt his (their) chances of survival were better together.
“John.” Sherlock hopped onto the bed, making the lump under the covers jump. “ABC Selfstore, they have three locations in London and two of them are 24-hour accessible. Was Molly going to run the hand's fingerprints, or have someone else do it? When?”
This one was still in control. Or thought he was. The execution of the dual murder had been impeccable, and he retained deniability. He hadn't actually killed the girls. Kidnapped and imprisoned, perhaps, but not killed. None of the cases could be tied to him directly. His methods were almost admirable. Using madness to do the work. Indirect, but effective.
“I have no idea what you're talking about,” Sherlock said completely without shame at his attempt at manipulation. It hadn't been a very good attempt, anyway. More of a token. “The hand we found was removed while the person was still alive.”
“If you like, I'll go and take the laptop and you don't have to move an inch,” John continued, voice a little quieter, a little less hopeful. “We really do need to pay the rent, Sherlock. It's due and it's not fair to Mrs Hudson.”
“I nicked it,” Sherlock replied and gave up the lighter.
“It's a better reason than land or oil rights,” Sherlock muttered and headed into the study where Gibson had kept his documents. To be honest he wasn't certain what he was looking for, but he'd know when he saw it. Whether it was multiple personality disorder or… something else, there'd be signs of those separate personalities. Little things.
“This is my case!” Sherlock spat at the pair keeping him from leaving with the shoe once it was found that there was nothing to find but the shoe in the room. John could see that Sherlock was getting frustrated to the point of getting himself in even more trouble, the point where he started spitting every horrific thing he could deduce off of people just because it was the only thing he could do that might get them to let him have his way, if anything to get him to stop talking. Only these were his superiors, or at least one was his superior the other was the husband of his superior and an officer of the law.
“It’s spotless, no dirt, or mud, or blood, it’s like it's been kept in a sealed case. It’s not mint condition new, some kid’s worn it at some point, but otherwise it’s clean,” John said, looking closely at it now for anything else off about the item in his hands, only to have it suddenly plucked away from him by Sherlock.
“Oh, that certainly explains Molly these last few days,” Sherlock mused. At John’s own raised eyebrow he continued, “perkier than usual and overall heightened cheeriness.”
“Is this normal?” John asked finally, done with his food. He looked over to see Sherlock giving him a questioning stare. “Do other Riders do this? Watch the last dragons on Christmas Eve? They’re down there aren’t they?” John clarified, nodding towards the walls where he suspected other riders and keepers might be. Sherlock’s eyes followed John’s nod, looking out at the black maze amongst the twinkling lights.
“You should be fine,” Sally tried to reassure with a joking tone, “he hasn’t killed anyone yet; Victor seemed to have figured out how to deal with him.” When she got no reply after handing John’s phone back she offered a forced chuckle before going quiet. “If you don’t have any problems with the bond tonight you will be meeting with the Masters tomorrow afternoon. Normally you would have long before any of this happened, but circumstances as they are, they decided to meet with you as soon as possible after your bonding.” Sally told John just as Mrs Hudson was returning up the stairs with the tea.
“Feels good,” Sherlock said calmly, an edge of smug I told you so in his voice. Sherlock shook his arms to dislodge John’s hands from their grip John came close to losing the entire lovely feeling from Hyperion when Sherlock let go of him, a frantic small scrabble of
of being in league with the smugglers.
“But at the crime scene…” Sherlock said in a low voice, the thumb and forefinger of one hand pinching a bit of his dressing gown on his knee and worrying it. John was watching every little movement he made now. What little tics had he missed in the last few weeks? He hadn’t really noticed the detective flinching away from anyone.
“John says its alright... Just remember, always ask first. Not all dragons are as easy-going about being climbed on by strangers.” Hyperion shut the eye facing them and slowly rolled his head sideways so that Mary could reach the spot and scratch it without climbing him. John chuckled at the sweetness of the gesture.
“You’re coming with us!” the sharky face growled at him. John continued to fight and struck out, a fist connecting hard with the broad nose in front of him. The man dropped John instantly. Crying out in pain, hands going to his face; the one punch had been enough to bloody the man’s nose.
“Good,” Sherlock replied, the confusion in his face dissipating, he still turned to go to his room however, and John had a long moment in the quiet as he made their tea, Sherlock’s toothrottingly sweet, and his bland with milk, no sugar, to overthink that one word and the fact that Sherlock had gone into his room again. He’d scared him off, maybe. They’d shared a couple of hugs before, the touches had become more frequent, but that one had felt a like a bit more, at least to John. Maybe voicing it so suddenly had spooked him. The sound of the shower running eased those thoughts away marginally.
“Cataloguing, organizing, planning,” he said, once he’d devoured the first biscuit.
“Oh Seb, Christ, oooh!” It was a cold bucket of water to John’s warming blood immediately. There were Moran and Jim, mid-embrace. The surprised sound had been Moran just lifting Jim like he was nothing, Jim’s back against the white tiled wall, pale legs wrapped around Moran’s dark shoulders, ankles crossed behind his neck, and his cock definitely in Moran’s mouth. Moran’s large hands gripped Jim’s arse, one running up to stroke his side, making Jim shiver and arch.
They continued like that for what felt like ages, Bellamy climbing and swooping, performing another loop and even a shallow dive, nothing too intense but infinitely more than John had ever expected to do when they’d started. Eventually John’s arms began to feel sore holding them out for so long, but he didn’t want to drop them and let Hyperion miss anything. Right about that time however an orange flash streaked by to his right, Melinda and Sally. It was like a cold bucket had been dumped over John, he’d completely forgotten about any other riders or other people who might be around, how much of a fool had he just made himself in front of them with all the arm nonsense. He tucked himself inwards immediately.
“Not as such… actually no,” He said, still looking out at the Aerie. “We’re the only ones up on top of anything tonight as far as I’m aware, besides the tower staff, of course.” Sherlock added gently knocking on the roof beside him.
“I believe John will keep him in line. The longer it takes for John to become airborne the longer Sherlock will remain within the limits of the Aerie. Being a disruptive nuisance goes against his interests,” Mycroft replied, smug smile still in place. John saw Sherlock’s mouth twist downwards. If John hadn’t already known there was tension between the brothers it was certainly alive and well within the council chamber, with Sherlock glaring daggers at the GrandMaster above him.
“Class is at 8:30!” chirped the little girl from John’s elbow, stabbing a bit of waffle and accidentally slinging a bit of syrup on the table in her enthusiasm.
“It’s quiet,” Sherlock murmured before John could say anything.
Hyperion brought his muzzle down carefully closer to them, resting his jaw on the floor as he opened his mouth. With Tom’s guidance, John hefted the end up onto his shoulder, smearing the side of his head with a gritty mix of fat, blood, and fine powder. He managed to get his elbow on Hyperion’s lower lip and used his hand to lift the meat off his shoulder and awkwardly beyond the teeth; pressing his face into the hot ivory white of a fang momentarily before freeing his arm from between them and moving away. Hyperion remained still the entire time.
“I’m not as trapped as you think within these walls,” Sherlock replied with a mischievous glint and a mildly unsettling smirk. “Also, I doubt they’d try the same trick twice; whoever this is they’re powerful enough to have global connections and they’re smart enough to stay undercover and only become visible if and when they allow it.” Sherlock added. “And if they are inside an Aerie, this Aerie, as I suspect they are, its only a matter of time before they begin to turn inwards and try to get me to participate from within the walls. If I won’t come out to play--”
The twinge of the change was unwelcome when it came, considering John had been enjoying covertly admiring Sherlock’s arse. Another slightly harder twinge made John curl up on himself. The transformation this time certainly wasn’t ‘call an ambulance I’m having a heart attack’ worthy, but if he’d felt this at home John would certainly be contemplating going to hospital.
he thought, reaching for Sherlock. The detective moved away, swinging his arm out of John’s reach.
“Her affair? Sherlock--”
“Good, that’s good,” John replied, shifting a bit and trying to get a little more comfortable, or at least as comfortable as one could get with a bullet wound, bandages, and sling. He still felt a bit drowsy, and with the recovery time ahead of him he simply let himself doze as the daily bustle of the hospital ward continued around him.
“It’s a bit cold isn’t it? Out here in the open I mean?” John asked, as a couple of the lingering Aerie staff came to help Lestrade coax Hyperion into moving. Hyperion groaned and let out a huffy sigh before lifting his head slowly on his own and curling back on himself into the padded crate. John felt a throb of annoyance from being handled and bothered so much cross the bond, along with a smidge of gratitude at John’s concern for his comfort.
“We’re human again,” John said with a smile, pecking a kiss onto Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock shoved him into a stall and threw a pair of swim shorts over the door. They landed on him. “Sherlock, I can’t wear these,” John said.
The warmth he’d been craving for the last week finally returned full force and it shook him to his toes. Hyperion let out a strong puff of air, blowing the coat off John’s shoulders, and John couldn’t help but grin. The power of that feeling surging all at once into him made his knees weak, much like it had done the first time. With his good arm he tried to grab the dragon’s nose to keep from falling. His grip slid off the great snout and he went down to the sand panting and giggling. His heart felt like it would burst with the overwhelming feeling of glee that flooded over him. Unlike before, where it had been tears born of sadness, his eyes started to water with tears of joy as Hyperion grunted and used his nose to gently push John back into the soft sand. He nosed at John’s belly with care, blowing hot air that smelled faintly like a strange combination of raw and cooked meat over him as John’s giggling died down to labored panting. Hyperion settled his cheek right next to him, that huge golden eye surveying him as he curved his neck around John, chin leaving a ditch in the sand around him.
“Okay, Sherlock, I know you think this is fun, but why are we dealing with a dead child’s shoe?” John asked, getting a sick slightly worried feeling in the pit of his stomach the moment Sherlock mentioned death. “And how do you seem to know so much about Carl?”
“It’s too fragile to fly with me and you can’t fly either. As inconvenient as it is, a car is our only option,” he said, still looking at his phone, dialing another number. “Molly, I’m going to need you ready to care for a premature hatchling; find someone ready to bond. I’ll be there in an hour or two,” another hang up and he pocketed the phone.
“I am clean!” Sherlock asserted, narrowing his eyes at her.
It was in that moment that it clicked and John realized that he was going to have to fly, up in the air, high above the ground. John’s brain went into overdrive. He honestly hadn’t thought about the reality that his life now involved a lot more flying than it had before. John could count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he’d been unwillingly flung skyward by dragon wings. One had brought him to Afghanistan; otherwise he had been grounded since he arrived, running and riding with ground troops and caravans, and never once thinking or wanting to leave the ground.
“What about the woman you remember?” John asked without really thinking.
The area in front of the aquarium in the shadow of the London Eye was still littered with tourists even at night, people hanging around for London’s night life, restaurants, the lights along Thames and the Eye and the bridge and parliament, some waiting for midnight to toll from the clock tower on the opposite bank. Regardless of his stature, walking among them in the nude save for a beach towel did manage to turn some heads to watch him go.
“That’s just Sherlock, he’s always been a disobedient prick. All the potential for a good man wrapped up in genius and a massive ego,” Lestrade replied, driving past said rider and out towards the airfield.
Hyperion shifted, letting John slide off his nose as he made the motion to roll upright. He groaned as he sat up, letting out a long sigh as he managed to get all four feet under him. John felt all the little aches and pains pinging across the bond keenly.
“I didn’t say that,” John protested, “it’s just I haven’t seen you eat anything like a decent meal in a few days. I don’t want you falling ill because you didn’t feed yourself.” Sherlock looked down at him from his reclined position, but said nothing.
Before John knew it there was a knock at the door and he heard the light creak of it opening at the far end of the room.
Sherlock remained quiet for some time after they left, allowing John to finish his lunch. John noticed the detective seemed to have zoned out, fingers not moving on the phone in his hand, spoon stopped with a bite of food resting on his plate.
Sherlock slid right into the water and again John followed even though he could see the silhouettes of the sharks within. John felt a little dim to trust Sherlock so completely so quickly, but hell, when one has been turned into a tuna fish for a day one tends to throw that sort of caution to the wind and accept the fact that one’s only real means of stopping being a daytime tuna fish was to trust the only other man who has also experienced it.
