“I mean, I don’t have a birth certificate. I don’t do my own taxes. I can’t legally be Jack’s guardian.” He looks to his left where Jack is dipping his french fries in mayonnaise like a weirdo and completely missing his mouth when he tries to eat them. Today, Cas dressed him in a bear costume with a headband that has little bear ears on it. Dean hasn’t been the same since he first saw it.
He can’t do it. The army men stopped Sam and the guitar stops Dean. Dean wants to give Jack a normal life so badly, but they don’t know normal. They are so far out of the realm of normal, they’ve been hitchhiking to Damaged Land for 3000 miles. But Jack plays guitar and sings old blues songs when he washes dishes because he knows Dean likes it.
Dean sits in the driver’s seat, and when Cas sits in the passenger seat, his trenchcoat spreads across the aisle into Dean’s space. He can smell Jimmy’s cologne, a scent that never leaves Cas and, since they’ve been spending more time together, never leaves Dean’s head, either.
Okay, so maybe it’s not weird. Because Cas is already weird, so anything he does is normal to him. So to Cas, him wanting to—to do that would be normal. But Dean can’t wrap his head around what world exactly Cas lives in where he thinks—that—would be a normal thing for him and Cas to do. No, normal is watching movies, drinking beer, going to bars and ogling chicks. Nevermind that they never go home with any of them, because Cas has never been interested, and Dean always felt like if Cas wasn’t getting any, it was kind of unfair to him that Dean would.
So what the fuck is Cas thinking, saying that shit? Does he want to make Dean’s head explode? Okay, that’s a little dramatic. Maybe as dramatic as the Narrator passing out when Tyler takes over. But seriously—what the fuck does he want from Dean? Saying something like that, that he wants to—it’s fucked up, is what it is. Is he playing a trick on Dean? Is he purposefully making Dean mad?
“Thank you,” Cas says, even though he clearly doesn’t understand what Dean’s talking about. But he’s looking again. Dean shivers and moves to the bed to take off his boots.
Dean licks his lips, suddenly dry-mouthed. “I wanted to know, um. I just. I wanted to know it wasn’t my fault. Right?”
“What—“ Dean can’t get the words out. He’s been dreaming of this moment for two weeks. It seemed so impossible that he would ever see Cas again. “What happened?”
“No, Cas, wait, I just want—“ He kisses Cas again. He’s hard, but it’s inconsequential, and instead of focusing on himself, he keeps kissing Cas and pushes his hand down Cas’s pants.
“You don’t have to say it.” Cas looks so grateful and happy that it pierces the armour Dean constructed carefully around himself. “I heard your prayer.”
“Okay, great. That’s just what we need.” Dean scrubs a hand over his face. “Where are you? Wanna fly over and we can hash this out?”
“Good night, Dean,” Cas says, almost drowned out by the menu music. He leaves the door open. He swishes down the hallway in the socks he crocheted himself, one thing that Dean couldn’t bear to take away from him, masculinity be damned. If Cas wants to crochet himself and everyone else socks, Dean will just have to wear them, won’t he?
“I want you to know,” Cas says, barely more than a breath, “that I feel, now. Emotions, sometimes fleeting, sometimes unbearable, but they are there. I feel them within me. What you must go through—I can’t imagine.”
“Jeez, you kiss a guy once and he wants to dick you down until sunrise. Just my luck.” He means for it to be a joke, but in that moment he’s not sure what’s real. The haze between reality and fiction has been dissipating for some time now, and Dean’s not sure if he’s even real, if any of it is real. But Cas’s hands on him are burning, and he wants this.
He starts turning tricks again. It’s easier to get money that way, and it’s not like his body is his own, anyway. He finds guys who’ll put their greedy hands on him, kiss him with their sour breath, fuck him until he can’t stand. The first time, he pukes in a dumpster while Sam sleeps in the Impala. The second time, he doesn’t think about the friend. It gets easier and easier.
Claire’s pouring shots for a couple of hunters when Dean takes the opportunity to slip into the supply closet with his phone out. It’s 3pm, late enough that Cas has to be up by now, and if he’s not, Dean’s going to cancel their Netflix account. He doesn’t answer when Dean calls him, which he usually doesn’t because he likes texting more than phone calls, so it’s an opportunity that Dean takes with both hands.
The buildings explode and crumble. Marla and the Narrator hold hands, and the movie ends. Well, at least something has ended tonight. Still, neither of them move. The credits play through, an agonising five minutes of Dean pretending to be really interested in the makeup artist’s assistant’s name, because that kind of thing is important to a movie. All films have their puzzle pieces, and if the makeup artists didn’t have assistants, then the whole thing would be out of whack, probably. The screen goes black, and then the dvd start up screen plays.
But Dean does. The rift is about to close but Dean takes ten seconds to say it. “I love you. You gotta know that. I love you more than anything.”
Cas looks disappointed, but then he nods, his expression evening out. “I’d like that. I like everything you give to me.”
And Dean loves this, loves the way Cas presses in until Dean’s mouth is full  and Cas’s cock teases at his throat. He rolls his hips, pressing in and drawing back, fucking Dean’s face ever so gently. Dean moans, loving it, loving the feel and the heft of him, loving the taste of him, holding onto Cas’s hips with his hands to encourage him to go deeper. He’s always loved this—he used to feel ashamed of how much he wanted it, how easy he would fall to the ground for any biker or closeted yuppie in a back alley, how much his knees would hurt from the gravel and concrete the next day, how much he loved the feeling of being full, of the taste of their come, different every time, how he would encourage them to come on his face just so he could feel something—wanted, maybe. Desired.
He lies down on the bed on his stomach, one hand beneath the pillow on his Colt. The other hand comes up to rest on the mark on his shoulder, and he swears that just for a second he can feel it throb.
“actually, yeah,” dean says, his eyebrows shifting up. he smiles a little at cas before turning back to the tv. his knee is propped up on the space between them, because dean rarely has two feet on the floor when he can help it. cas could reach out and lay his hand on it, feel the rough catch of dean’s jeans, the warmth of his skin and body in them. cas could pull dean’s foot into his lap and touch his bare skin, rub his thumbs into the joint of dean’s ankle. he’d do it slowly, so that dean has time to pull away, so that dean knows how deliberate he would be in wanting that.
Dean touches the shaft of Cas’s cock, running his finger down the length of the vein, and Cas keens openly, shameless for the things he wants. Dean takes Cas’s cock in his hand and guides to his waiting mouth, but stops before he takes Cas in.
dean glances at cas in the mirror as they pull up to “a taste of heaven,” praying that sam lost his vision last night, maybe got cursed, because—
, but it’s nicer than the peeling paint walls and hard as brick mattresses they usually get. the beds are squishy, but not too much so, and dean heaves a sigh already missing his own memory foam mattress at the bunker. the counters aren’t layered in stains, and this motel has a genuine, functional fucking kitchen. it’s not huge, but it’s functional, and that’s more than enough for dean. they have smaller fridges, but there are these little fucking
they fall asleep like that, too tired to get under the covers but too content to care. as long as they have one another, it’s nice enough, warm enough.
him. his stomach fucking hurts, he’s so nervous, so fucking embarrassed that he’s making such a big deal out of this. that makes dean shrink down into himself, makes him want to look away from those glacier eyes and run.
“but we should really get going,” dean continues. cas nods and pushes himself off the bed and starts picking up the clothes that were thrown on the floor the evening before.
“oh, y’know... ” he reaches to wrap his arm back around her waist, pulling her close, all rough and handsy. “
they share one last, sweet kiss before dean lowers himself down onto cas. the stretch is white-hot, but dean likes it, and he forgot how different a real cock feels, how long and hot and drawn out it is when there’s someone else there. fuck, he loves this. cas is pretty fucking big, too, and by the time dean’s fully seated on cas’s hips, his thighs are shaking
dean can feel cas’s fingertips prodding at his entrance, can feel them pushing in, and— the way they stretch him out, make him feel full... dean might fucking pass out. he’s wondering when the
affecting dean like this. he doesn’t understand why he’s thinking like this. he tries to tune back into the movie as indy takes off in the airplane, but… he isn’t really paying attention anymore. dean’s head starts to feel heavy as he watches the screen, and he leans back against the headboard, squeezes his eyes shut for a moment. he starts thinking of past hunts, the wins and the losses. his mind wanders a bit, strays from the serious thoughts to soft hands on his face, in his hair. to cool blue eyes and rosebud lips and a magical touch.
? where are we going with this?” dean has laced his fingers together, and he’s tugging at his index finger, pulling and rubbing at the skin as he looks at cas, not breaking his gaze, not
you, need—” he’s grown desperate, yanking at the dress shirt so hard that one of the buttons pops, and he thinks he might fucking cry, it’s so much, so good.
cas had awoken at around 5:40— dean remembers ‘cause he’d been trying to distract himself by naming as many types of cheese as he could—he had only thought of 16 when cas started to stir. he was trying to think of that one cheese, the one that starts with
the air between sam and dean is thick with an unspoken tension, and dean’s trying so hard so convince himself that he doesn’t know. he
fucking good. his eyes are rolling back, shutting, and his hips are bucking up and into dean. his head falls back, bounces off the wall with a painful
he’s shaking in the cold, looking into blue, light and cool. his eyes are calm when he speaks, voice unwavering.
he sounds croaky, but sam doesn’t say anything, doesn’t react. he dumps the rosemary mixture on the lamia, looks to dean for the next step. dean is reaching towards his jacket pocket to get the lighter, but— he can’t find it, and.. cas
cas is just staring down at dean, watching him suck at his fingers, and with every swipe of dean’s long tongue, cas’s breath seems to catch in his throat. dean isn’t the only one enjoying this, and it’s so,
. he’s pinning him to the wall with his hips and holding him upright with one hand, his other hand between them, slick with spit and so steady that dean whimpers.
“leave them on,” dean croaks, voice already a mess. cas complies, giving dean a chaste kiss before tearing the condom packet open and rolling it on. the lube bottle flips open with a ‘pop’ and dean closes his eyes with a content sigh. cas pauses.
he’s smiling, and then dean’s smiling too, trying to adjust to scoot his hips back a little, shivering when he feels cas, still hard beneath him. he had forgotten, just for a second, what they were doing, but then his stomach is all tied up again, and he’s making a little, broken noise.
the motel bathroom isn’t disgusting, but it’s far from great. there are some indiscernible beige stains on the tile, and he’s scared to look too closely at the shower curtains. he pries himself away from the mirror and leans into the clean part of the wall with a sigh. his chest feels heavy. he shouldn’t have snapped at cas like that, he feels… horrible. he’s been a
something like that. they’re light and practically blend in with his skin tone, but dean thinks they’re perfect. cas’s hair had gotten a little longer as well, his angel mojo not keeping it the same length anymore or whatever. his pretty brown curls almost reach his cheeks now, tumble over his forehead in thin, smooth waves. he’s…. beautiful, a perfect example of angelic. he’d… never noticed these things about him, never seen him look so peaceful without his grace.
“so,” sam clears his throat and dean startles, snapping out of his little trance. he had finished his food before all of them watching cas pick at the tablecloth. “it seems like the lamia has been going to more bars lately—like the one you guys were at.” dean and cas exchange a glance.
cas looks at dean for a second, his eyebrows still furrowed, then nods. he turns his attention to the screen as dean begins to click through netflix. for a moment dean thinks cas is gonna say something, but cas remains silent, staring intently at the screen. dean’s probably thinking into it too much.
the pair stare at each other, frozen in place, forgetting they’re on a time crunch as the reality of what they’re about to do for the
. he’s so tired, but he likes it, likes how out of it he feels. last night wrecked him, crushed his mask to bits, and he— he can’t even think about going through a whole day now, can’t think about living without cas touching him like this.
dean has found himself staring at cas whenever they go out together, noting how his cheeks get pinker within minutes, how giggly he gets. dean can’t remember the last time he saw angel of the lord, stick-up-his-ass castiel break out into a laughter fit. it makes him happy, knowing that castiel is happy. he’s quite enjoying his human form, this time around.
dean stops, whips around with the shirt in his hands and steps towards cas, who seems to shrink back slightly, eyes widening.
back at sam, doesn’t realize he’s reaching to grab at cas’s sleeve until he’s got the fabric between his fingers, until he’s catching one of the threads with his nail.
“you’re so beautiful.” cas’s words almost echo around the motel room, sending a wave of shivers over dean. what the fuck is he supposed to say to that? thanks?? he can feel the blood rising to his face as cas approaches. something about the way dean was standing, waiting, completely bare while cas was fully clothed. watching him…
considers it. it wouldn't be the first time he did that, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last, but… he unlocks the door, yanks it open and cowers from the direct sunlight.
hair unkempt, too long, too messy, tie askew, cheeks flushed. dean lets out a noise that resembled something in between a laugh and a moan and then they were leaning in again.
, he hates to admit he’s wrong normally, but right now…. something’s holding him back. he’s upset with himself and stands there for a second, with parted lips and wide eyes.
to touch cas, to mark him, to— to claim him as his own. he needs it, needs to feel him or he’s gonna start crying, gonna go crazy.
god, she sounds so fake, and cas wants to yank her away by the fucking curls, tell her she can’t talk to dean anymore. he just .. doesnt want her to. he wants her to take her fake compliments and her fake breasts and
sometimes the numbers stick together in his head, they have a few room numbers that they always stick to, just for consistency, but… it can still get confusing. he has to try a few different doors, cursing under his breath each time the key doesn’t fit in the lock. sam usually gets bitchy when he forgets, but--
because of it. his hips are rolling, pressing harder against dean, craving more friction. his body’s screaming for more, and he wants to take it, wants to make dean fucking cry. he’s wanted this for
lamia are relatively easy to kill if you have access to rosemary and a lighter, but if you dont… you need a silver knife, blessed by a priest. dean’s sighing, running through the facts as he gathers up his clothes, unlocks the door and pushes his way out of the bathroom.
dean opens his mouth to say something, but before he can get a single word out— there’s a loud knock on the door. dean jerks away for the second time that morning, tumbling back off of the bed, taking the bedsheets with him. he hits the floor with a hollow thud, letting out a weak little yelp. he just woke up, and already his ass is gonna be bruised. fun.
from human hearts, right? the last one we saw left markings in the victims, but these ones are different,” sam types in his password, opens up his computer to a bunch of different lore sites, turning the laptop so that dean can see the screen from where he’s standing.
behind her, panting, with a furious glint in his eyes. he’s still got the lamia by the head, by her hair, and it’s not anywhere close to dead— a snapped neck just slowed it down a little, made it a little weaker. it’s reaching up at cas, grabbing at his wrist, and… if cas can feel it, he isn’t reacting at all, he has his angry gaze fixed on dean, looking him up and down. he’s making sure he isn’t wounded.
, it didn’t,” dean rushes, talking over the fallen angel, “i just… yeah.” dean internally groans, he hopes he didn’t make anything awkward he doesn’t know if he could handle the stress of figuring out what the fuck he just did with his best friend and the added weight of not being able to talk to him.
cas pulls his fingers out, pauses for a moment as his eyes fall to his hands. his smile falters, and for a second dean wonders if he did something wrong, then— cas is holding his three fingers up in front of dean’s face, and he looks
dean,” his voice is muffled, making dean’s skin buzz, but the nerves in his stomach grow tighter, nicer, “didn’t drag you here just to sit and
—didn’t take anyone last night, which is… a bit odd,” sam’s thinking out loud by the end of his sentence, fingers sliding across his laptop’s trackpad.
it feels like a knife, like the tip of a fucking angel blade, and then there’s a painful prick as his throat and it’s gone. he’s turning to see what the lamia’s fucking doing, to see if there’s any weak points or inconsistencies, any way he can get out of this by himself, but— his observation is interrupted by a full, bone-rattling
he pries his eyes back open, ignoring his body’s futile attempts to get him to stay asleep, to keep his eyes shut for as long as he can possibly manage. his heart nearly falls out of his ass when his eyes adjust. he sees shades of blue, clouded with sleep, with concern. there’s skin and freckles and dean can see individual eyelashes, can see smile lines and pores and—
before dean can grab the lube out of cas’s hands, cas is already squeezing more onto his two outstretched fingers, guiding dean so he’s leaned forward a bit, so that he’s lifted up and cas can reach his hole.
“here.” cas quickly shook his pants off of his ankles so he wouldn’t trip. he scoops dean back up again, dean’s arms flying out to wrap around cas’s neck. cas carefully drops dean on the bed. he laughs a little as soon as his head hits the cushion, tired and obviously worn out.
dean gets a disgustingly greasy egg-and-bacon sandwich, takes a large bite out of it as soon as it’s set down in front of him. he pretends he doesn’t see sam’s disapproving stare, because—who fucking
dean’s head is getting heavy, and he opens his mouth, trying to speak. nothing but a cracky, high-pitched noise comes out. he doesn’t recognize it.
happened with girls. fuck. “after that? man we’d be lucky if i can even sit down.” cas chuckles, relieved that the tension between them earlier has dissolved.
or something. though.. cas would take that over being completely ignored. dean was the one who brought cas here in the first place, he's in no shape to fucking complain. but...
dean didn’t leave his side that night, but— he couldn’t even if he wanted to. he had fallen asleep with his head on dean’s shoulder, and they’d slowly moved so his face was pressed against dean’s chest, arms wound comfortably around his waist. cas was alright, jack had said, that “his human vessel couldn’t take the strain of the fight” or whatever.
only one night in and they fit together perfectly, have already found which way to turn their heads into the kiss, it feels easy, like they’ve been doing this their whole lives. like this was meant to be, since day fucking
he thinks for a second, thinks about how much fun it’s been to go out for drinks with newly-human cas.
, cas wants to yell. he doesn’t know how he’s gonna knock some fucking sense into him, doesn’t want to cross a line, but he-- he can’t think about losing dean, not right now.
. dean winchester, one of the strongest, scariest hunters in the country, is begging for castiel, former angel of the lord. and he sounds
sam continue to scroll on his laptop, looking at the two every so often. but not making any comments or jokes, which is…
then the finger’s pushing in, and he’s practically mewling in response to the intrusion, tears in his eyes because he feels so exposed, so fucking vulnerable. it’s scary because he knows cas doesn’t care, knows cas is just as far gone as he is, knows he

a few moments pass, and dean feels dizzy, like he’s just woken up from a sleepless night. he fucking
he’s rushing out of his car, to where cas is desperately unlocking the motel room, moving inside as fast as he can. dean’s safe now, at least. that’s what matters. but dean’s talking loudly after him, repeating the same question, rambling about how he can’t handle his alcohol, how he needs to slow down the drinking.
he tries to loosen up a bit, but he’s sure the lamia can sense his nerves or something while they walk toward the impala.
. he was definitely not expecting to return to the motel to loud thumps against the wall to his right, to deep groans through the wall. sure, sam had suffered through a lot in the past—dean isn’t unfamiliar with the term “hookup.”
— and props himself up on his elbows to look down at cas. he leans in to press his lips against the ex-angel’s. it tastes a bit like morning breath, dean thinks, a bit like the cocktail cas had last night, but he doesn’t really care. he just.. can’t get over the feeling of it. of this. fuck.
“you know, you’re pretty good looking yourse—” dean’s cocky comment is cut off when cas scoops him up, off the floor, back to the wall. dean is clutching to him, hanging on. cas leans the boy back against the wall, a smirk on his lips.
the voices from inside the bar grow loud and for a second he’s back in heaven, back to being an angel and hearing prayers and feeling nothing.
emotions and getting snapped at for something that wasn’t under his control. dean doesn’t know how to go about an apology.
him with a lamia practically down his pants. but then he thinks about the girl, the way she was looking at him, talking to him like he was hers. that’s never bothered him before, so—
.” he shoots her another little smile— that let’s-get-out-of-here, sex smile— and he feels so… different. he doesn’t feel like himself, which is strange he realises, because hooking up with a random chick at a bar is something he should be used to. even hooking up with monsters doesn’t feel too far from normal, he’s slept with far too many.
fucking boring. he’s been messing with one of the loose threads on the comforter for the past 20 minutes, has been zoning out for a little less than that, and… at first, when he laid back, he was looking at the textured ceiling, trying to see if he could make nay designs out of the bumpy things, but— that got pretty boring, pretty quick.
“i’m going outside.” he leaves his empty glass on the bar, makes a b-line for the front door. there’s people, so many voices, and for a moment he’s reminded of angel radio. he thinks back to the times when the voices became too much, back to when he stole that angel’s grace and was completely overwhelmed by all the talking. he’d become obscenely human—
she keeps talking, and cas tries to focus on his beer, using that as a distraction like he’s dean do too many times to count. there’s that same, human warmth in the pit of his stomach as the alcohol begins to seep in, and soon the beer’s empty, and he’s ordering one of the fancy drinks, one of the ones with an umbrella that looks pretty on the menu. he hopes dean’s gonna pay for that, hopes he doesn’t say anything about it being
fucking slow, and they… act like they always do, work on the case normally. cas is … quiet, though. he contributes, but only in little ways, when he’s needed, when they’ve found that they don’t know what else to do with their evidence. dean’s quiet, too.
“i just…” cas hesitates, hands kneading the fabric of his sweatpants, picking at the fabric. dean’s noticed that cas likes to fiddle with things like this, likes to have something to do with his hands. he looks… adorable. dean stops a little, blinks. what the fuck? he looks—he looks like cas.
“legs,” he hoists dean up again, reaches to yank one of his thighs up, then shoving him back into the wall, hips jutting forward to hold dean up a little more, a little easier. he can’t get enough of the taste of dean, the feeling of his skin on his tongue. he just wants more, more, more.
“we should probably head back to the bar— see what went down, and why the lamia couldn’t feed.” sam started packing up his things and dean glanced over at cas, eyes widening. he was connecting the dots.
he doesn’t really know what to do or how to approach the situation… he’s never been afraid to talk to sam about something like this.
his teeth are chattering just sitting in the driver's seat, curled up a little. fuck. he should go inside, he knows it, but he opens the door and realizes he’s shaking. dean rubs his hands together when the cold air hits him. fuck, he might love the cold and bundling up in more jackets than necessary, but it’s a
sam left a sandwich for him, but he had forgotten about it by the time it had gone cold, and cas was still asleep on him, he— he couldn’t bear to wake him.
he racks his brain for details about this case— sam had been rambling earlier this morning about it. there was greek lettering carved into each of the victims, the same one on the chest of each, and there was a hole in the abdomen beneath the rib cage, leading straight to the heart. at first they had thought it was some sort of ritualistic werewolf— the heart was missing, completely ripped out-- but, after some research on heart-eating creatures, they realized it was a lamia.
a loud crash in the movie snaps him out of his weird little trance, and he almost yelps, jolts a little.
sam’s across the room, talking to a group of weird guys, flashing his badge and trying to see if they saw the girl that was there yesterday. dean’s back hurts, and he’s trying so hard not to focus on
to see him, like he’s an old friend, and when she stops in front of them, lays her eyes on dean, then cas, she frowns.
cas knows what he’s doing, knows how this affects dean, and after last night? dean’s about to keel over. it’s sore, but he feels good, stomach turning and knotting up.
“i don’t need a babysitter, cas,” he’s appreciative for their concern, but— he’s a big boy, he can fend for himself.
he can’t get to the door fucking fast enough, and the moment he gets outside, he heaves a sigh, gulping down the cool air like he’s been holding his breath for an hour. he still hasn’t grown accustomed to his human reactions to things, doesn’t understand anxieties or panic, but now that he
dean snaps his gaze up to meet castiel’s. cas is sitting on the bed, hair slightly ruffled. he’s changed out of his suit and is practically drowning in one of dean’s old ac/dc shirts. where’d he even get that from? doesn’t matter.
, chest heaving with every inhale. he’s pushing on dean’s shoulders with one forearm, a little too high to be his chest, but there’s a subtle pressure on dean’s throat that makes his stomach flip and curl.
a beat passes and dean trips over this thoughts, and— fuck, he shouldn’t have said that, feels like cas thinks he doesn’t want this. cas is probably tired, they just burned a fucking lamia, and—god,
once, dean had run into him after a shower, stood in the middle of the kitchen with no shirt and a bag of chips and—
. he’s reaching down with one hand, yanking cas’s dress shirt from where it’s tucked into his pants, pushing his hand beneath the fabric.
cas’s head tilt in his words. though cas had been on earth for quite a long time as an angel, he had missed out on lots of small details, food being one of them. of course he knew what burgers and pancakes were, dean had made
“you disappeared last night,” she pouts, jutting out her bottom lip like she’s a fucking puppy. cas’s stomach is churning, and just looking at her makes him want to scream. fuck, if he had his grace, she would be pink mist by now.
he was hauling him up and holding him close, practically carrying him down the stairs because— the angel’s legs were so shaky, barely stable enough to keep him upright. but dean wasn’t even thinking about that, needed to make sure his best friend was alive, that he was going to survive, and—
“i…” dean takes a shaky step forward, drops his old clothes on the floor beside the bed. “you… don’t— don’t apologize, cas. i shouldn’t have…. snapped on you like that, i’m.. i’m sorry. i’m just.. tired, and i’m irritable, and--” dean sits down on the bed, his shoulder knocking against castiel’s. “you… you need to stop apologizing for things that aren't your fault, cas.”
he fishes his phone out of his coat pocket, hurriedly pressing the button marked “2”, sighing when he sees sam’s name pop up on the screen, followed by “
,” it’s the first thing he can think of, but she looks like she’s willing to go along with it for a meal.
he feels so small in the motel room all of a sudden, wants the earth to swallow him whole, to cover him and keep him hidden until he feels okay again. but—
: the lamia. she’s beautiful, her hair is the same as it was the night before, curled just enough so that it doesn’t look too big or too small, so it looks perfect. she was wearing blue yesterday, and today she’s wearing pink— something stringy and uncomfortable-looking. some women’s clothes are pretty, but shit like that? he’s 100% sure they would be functional torture devices. hand a guy one of those weird, strappy tank top things? insane. immediately.
. he should have waited longer to ask cas, doesn’t even know if he knows how this whole.. relationship—
more. he’s so fucking strong, and dean watches the way cas’s arms bulge when he tightens his grip, the way his muscles move under his skin. he’s whimpering, mumbling as he braces on cas’s bare chest, his voice bending and cracking as he tries to talk, tries to say
the food arrives quickly and dean drops sam’s burger and fries off at his room. they eat in silence, cas still sitting at the table and dean on the bed. they still don’t mention the incident from this morning.
handle dean being angry at him, not now, not tonight. sam pauses at his motel room, looking at dean with a questioning look on his face. when dean doesn’t say anything else, sam turns to look at cas, eyebrows raised so high he’s surprised they aren’t touching his fucking hairline.
and when cas starts to push in, dean’s head feels so heavy, it might be the alcohol, but all he can concentrate on the stretch. fuck, it feels so
, and— part of him knows that sam is open-minded, knows that he wouldn’t care, but… the part of him that john got to, the ruined, terrified corner of his psyche is yelling at him that
— he’s thrown back to the previous night, to tan hands roaming across his chest, thinks about how good that felt and how horrifically
she literally wants to eat him, wants to drain his body of any and all blood, and—he’s realizing how fucking stupid he’s being, he’s literally pinning a monster to his car this surely can’t end well. dean doesn’t want to be here in front of her and
“i guess getting fucked against a wall doesn’t help with stability,” dean jokes and winces slightly as he stands up. cas is about to speak but dean points a finger at him.
, i-fuck,” dean starts babbling, doesn’t even process half of the things coming out of his mouth as cas slams into him repeatedly, shoving deeper, filling him up. cas pants as he fucks into dean, one hand gripping his thigh tightly and the other on his ass, kneading and pulling and squeezing.
dean’s fingers curl into a tight fist, and he has to stop himself from grabbing her wrist and yanking her hand away. he hates it when people he doesn’t know touch his car, when they act like she’s theirs. plus, she’s probably getting monster juice
dean hurriedly yanks the bottle of lube from him, squeezes it into his hand and then reaches down, sloppily spreads it across cas’s cock, desperate for anything.
cas bottoms out and holds for a few moments, letting dean adjust. dean takes a few gasping breaths, feeling himself get stretched open, head spinning. cas is big, really fucking big, and this is an adjustment for him, but-- he likes it, likes this. he can feel cas deep in his tummy and he wants more, wants it harder. wants to feel bruised from the inside out. fuck the lamia, fuck needing to walk and sprint around tomorrow in a hunt, he needs this.
he catches up when cas gets the motel door open, follows him in too closely, talks too loud and the second the ex-angel hears the door click shut he’s stopping in his tracks.
a moment passes and dean is left breathless, standing completely naked against the wall. his breath catches as cas’s eyes loom over him, examining every inch of him at a painstakingly slow rate. it makes dean’s finger twitch at his sides, wanting to just reach out and pull cas back to him.
, dean? huh?” he pitches around, steps so close to dean that he hopes, if he talks loud enough, dean might actually
. all cas wants to do is help. he’s just trying his best, right? goddamn it. dean can’t even begin to imagine what the guy is going through, having to adjust to being human only to feel emotions more,
“good night, you two?” sam smiles to himself as dean chokes on his water and cas’s eyes widen. yes, sam had his suspicions, but he wasn’t
. his mind is short-circuiting and all he can focus on is cas’s forearm pressing him back further and further into the motel’s wall.
to his jaw, and he’s reeling, dizzy. his eyes are shut and he can feel her winding back for another one, he feels like disappearing because— it looks like he’s getting his ass
“cas?” dean lifts his head up, looks him in the eyes. his chest tightens a little when green meets blue, and he’s... he feels himself shrinking a bit under cas’s stare. the door to the bar opens again and there’s a few words from afar, and this time, dean steps back.
“you okay, dude?” dean asks like he doesn’t smell like that woman, like her disgusting, flowery, fruity perfume.
, okay, um—” there are some scrambling noises, and sam must be getting up, grabbing cas’s keys, “which bar are you at? i'll be there in 5.”
he’s been through a lot, and… it figures, people with trauma tend to have a skewed sense of themselves, but for him— it’s a lot, and it makes him feel almost empty, almost like he isn’t himself anymore. sometimes he thinks he’s a completely different person than he was before. cas used to notice when he was off, used to be able to tap him on the head and make him feel a little better, pump him full of that stupid angelic serotonin shit. but now cas is human, and it’s not his fault that he’s human, bu—
, unzips dean’s pants and dean hurries to step out of them, taking his boxers down with them in one fluent motion.
though dean would never admit it, but he falls asleep much easier when someone else is there, and he’s taken a liking to falling asleep while a movie’s playing on his computer. it’s not the same as company, but… it always helps, at least a little. it gets the job done. he opens his laptop, sets it on the bed and climbs under the covers, shoots cas an awkward grin, trying his best to seem normal. casual.
he says it too loud, but sam’s still walking, and his legs are much longer than theirs. they’re a little bit
but dean just lets out another breathless moan, pushes back into cas’s hands, trying to formulate words, but— failing,
they find a steady rhythm, dean trying his best to bounce, to move as cas bucks up into him. he can feel cas’s fingernails digging into his sides, can feel his hot breath fanning across his collarbone.
for that later, but now he can’t think about it, is bracing himself on the wall and trying to recover from that fucking
, and he still looks like a damn angel. “we gotta, uh — meet sammy for breakfast at 7, so… we should
monster-killing stuff, but he’s not gonna say that. even though he wants to, really wants to wheel on her with a lighter and their makeshift marinade and burn her to the fucking ground but he
to, knows they don't have enough time for that. “my ass hurts.” dean pouts, hugging closer to cas. he chuckles, shakes his head.
“shit— am i squashing you?” dean laughs a bit and rolls off him, hand moving to rub up cas’s chest. cas rolls his eyes and tugs dean back, closer and dean beams. “but yeah,
“god… there’s so many things i wanna do to you,” cas whispers, but dean hears it loud and fucking clear, almost shouts for cas to please,
“i… yeah, man. i’m alright.” it’s not a bad thing that cas cares, not a bad thing that he’s trying to make sure he’s okay, but— he doesn’t know how he’s supposed to
dean pushes the door to his motel room open, groans and flops onto the bed with a little noise, a little grunt. it had been a while since they had an easy lead, and although the case may not be as easy as they thought, sam and dean had decided to splurge a bit. two different motel rooms, one for each of them. cas wasn’t part of the original plan.
, and dean’s eyes are squeezing shut, his hand flying to grip cas’s wrist where it’s holding his thigh. he can’t hold in the noises, can’t even fucking focus on that right now because it’s so good, and cas is slamming into his prostate, sending him wheeling, crying. his cheeks are slick with tears and he thinks he might pass out if cas doesn’t let up, can’t think about anything but cas, cas, cas. his hands, his skin, his
. bar was cool. they played nirvana, i think,” dean manages to get out, cheeks a little flushed. and, damn it, sam couldn’t bring himself to tell them that he knew.
there’s another finger pressing into him, and then a third soon after, and dean’s leaning forward, mouth connecting to the skin of cas’s bare chest, to his collarbones and his neck and his jaw and then his
“cas?” he’s shivering hard, rushing in, and he realizes how small he sounds, and feels a little uncomfortable. he hates his resting voice, clears his throat a little as he rubs his arms up and down, trying to produce some warmth. “the hell are you doing here?”
dean leaves a few bills on the table as they head out, wincing again as he stands up and follows sam at a distance so he can whisper to cas.
he needs to leave, needs to get out of here, needs to get that lamia bitch away from dean and his green eyes and his stupid, perfect face. and his smile—
dean audibly gasps as cas accidentally brushes their hips together, the back of his head colliding with the cracked and chipping walls. he thinks he’s seeing stars, flings his arms around cas’s neck, desperately holding on for support.
cas’s hands fall into place on dean’s hips as dean starts to move, up and down, moaning and moaning and fucking
othey really do look like they’d been through hell last. cas’s hair couldn’t seem to flatten itself and dean’s lips were bruised beyond compare, but matched nicely with the marks on his neck. not to mention he had a fucking limp. dean winchester, feared by angels and demons alike, limping around and wincing with each step he took. it hadn’t been this bad at first, he had just been complaining to complain, but— his lower back hurt like a
dean whips around to look at sam but doesn’t fight back, simply gives him a mere nod. he can still feel the sting in his throat, the smoke making its way down, into his lungs.
“can… can you stand?” cas whispers after a few moments, eyes still trained on deans face. he looks beautiful. completely fucked out, hair pointing in opposite directions, lips and neck bruised purple, cum smeared on his stomach. cas waits, letting dean catch his breath.
he forgets his emotions when cas’s hands get tighter on his waist, when he can feel cas getting hard under him,
“oh my god,” dean hides his face in cas’s chest, heat rushing to his cheeks. “i’m so sorry that i called you dude in the middle of all that, this— this is just…
what was, how much he fucking loved it. he needs to focus on the monster, needs to make sure he’s ready for a fight, but—
hey !! scoot here :D we have been hard at work on this fic for a few weeks now (we have 40 pages of it written up in google docs? help. the finale broke us.), but i'm so happy to finally be sharing it w the world ! we have some lightly confusing, garbled plans for this, but.. this is the most i've written in literal years, and i'm so happy to say i made an amazing friend doing it! this is us rewriting the ending to our liking, being a Little (very) horny to cope with the shit that kripke made us endure, and that's okay ! i hope you can enjoy this ending with us, though it's before 15x18 and all of that s15 shit, i hope you love this as much as i do! i hope that the drip never stops with this story, and i hope we can give it the wrapping up it deserves ! also, as i'm writing this, it's jenmish day.

“sam told me he got a lead on the case…” cas let out the words slowly, as if he were thinking hard about what to say, how to say it. “he doesn’t believe this lamia killing will be too difficult. he’s stocking up on supplies— he said he’d leave some gear for you in his motel room. he also stated we can probably get it ‘over and done with’ in the morning.” cas uses air quotes to quote sam and a ghost of a smile graces dean lips. he loves it when cas does that, it makes him feel all fuzzy, makes him want to let out a big, full-bellied laugh.
“dean.” cas is pushing dean’s shirt up and off his head, discarding it on the floor with a low, vibrating noise. he presses his palm to castiel’s bare stomach, almost cries because it’s been so long since he felt the skin of someone he really cared for. he wants more, wants to feel all of cas, never wants it to fucking stop.
He waits for the beep and pitches his voice lower as he talks. “Cas, baby, hey. I’ve been thinking about you. Can’t stop thinking about you, actually. Can’t stop thinking about getting my hands on you, all over you, putting my mouth on you.” Dean does this every week with a 90 percent success rate of Cas mauling him when he gets home. “Wanna make you moan my name. Wanna make you come in me when I’m riding you and—“
The wedding is two parts disaster and one part the best party Dean has ever thrown. He looks around at the smiling faces of everyone who loves him, keeping in his heart the ones who aren’t there anymore, and he realises. He’s whole now. He’s not broken anymore.
“I’d like that,” Cas says, a smile curving his lips. They’re chapped, as usual, because Cas doesn’t understand basic necessities. Dean wants to kiss them. It makes him ache, this wanting. It rends him in two. “I’m afraid I’m no closer to finding God than I was months ago when I started looking.”
But if Dean heard correctly, also—what the fuck? Is Cas just—curious, maybe? Dean’s heard of that, the bi-curious thing. Maybe—okay, Dean’s going out on a limb here—maybe Cas just wants to experiment. And that’s fine, it’s what guys sometimes do with their friends, or so Dean’s heard. He’s never had a friend until Cas. And Cas doesn’t have any friends other than Dean, Sam and Kevin, and like hell will Dean let Cas experiment with Sam or Kevin—one, because they’re both ugly, and Cas is hot, so he should have someone who is as hot as him. Two, because they are his family, and he doesn’t want his best friend involved with his family, especially when they all live together. And if Dean’s the only friend Cas has to experiment with, shouldn’t that mean that it’s Dean’s job, as Cas’s friend, to let him experiment on—with Dean? That’s what a good friend would do, right?
Dean gives him the address and Cas is there in two seconds. His coat is ripped and there’s a smidge of blood on the bridge of his nose, but he looks the same, seemingly unflappable, understanding, and oblivious.
“I don’t think I know how to protect myself, Cas.” Dean leans back against the motel wall, which is cool through his shirt. “I feel like an open wound.”
“it sounds like purgatory,” cas says. “the lawlessness, the jungle, where humans are free from the constrains of capitalism and societal expectations.”
“Gotta go, love you, bye,” Dean rambles into the phone and hangs up. He opens the door with a sheepish grin in place as Claire tries not to laugh.
“I said, it’s fine,” Dean says, harsher than he meant. When Cas walks past him, their legs brush together, and it sends a frisson of sparks through Dean’s taut body, making the muscles in his stomach clench so tight they hurt. Well, that’s one way to get rock-hard abs. No, not rock-hard, fuck—
The truth is, Dean would burn the world down for his brother, and Sam would save it for Dean. Dean wouldn’t know how to be normal if you paid him to do it.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas says, tears in his eyes. He’s so warm, but he smells of acrid air. It must be the Empty residue. Dean wants to wash him clean. “I’m here, it’s me.”
Okay, it’s not fine. It’s not fine that Cas wants to do that, because it’s weird, okay—Dean’s not some kind of homophobe, so he’s not going to say that two guys going to town on each other is gross. He’s watched that kind of porn and it’s not horrible, although he thinks it’s as unrealistic as lesbian porn to be that into a dick in your ass. Like, things are meant to come out of there, not go in. But since he’s not a homophobe, it’s not gross, because gayness or whatever is pure and good and shouldn’t be tainted by the image of whatever Cas wants to—
“does nick remind you of anyone?” kevin asked. “like, anyone who might take you for granted, or, like, make you do stuff without, you know, returning the favor?”
He cycles through an entire parade of emotions sitting there in the dark. It takes an indeterminable amount of time and energy for him to stand up from the couch. His knees crack, his back hurts, and his muscles will be sore tomorrow, but his mind is clear, now. He knows what he’s going to do.
“He loves you, you know.” Older Cas sighs, and that’s wrong too. “He doesn’t know it yet, but he’s falling in love with you.”
“You were a child, Dean. Nothing that happened to you was your fault.” When Cas says it so simply, Dean believes it. Of course, he was a child. “You did the only thing you knew how to do: protect Sam.”
“God,” Dean says, before he shuts his mouth. Should he be blaspheming this much in front of an angel? Cas has never cared before, but maybe Dean should show a little respect. Another shiver runs through him as he remembers those words.
When they break apart, Cas’s brow furrows as he glances around the room. His gaze lands on the crib and his jaw drops open. “How long was I gone?”
But he gets out. He and Benny get out, and then Cas is there, and then Cas is laying his hands on Dean in a way that’s taking instead of giving. He hits Dean again and again, rattling his teeth loose, breaking his cheekbone, splitting his lip in three places. But the next touch he gives Dean is healing, and it’s like whiplash, it is. It’s beauty in the moment and it’s pain in the being. Dean would take it every time because all he knows is how to take the beatings given to him.
He grabs Dean’s hands and looks up at him, the light turning his eyes to a crystalline blue. “You are many things, Dean Winchester, but you are not, and have never been, weak. Loving doesn’t make you weak. It makes you the strongest, most selfless being in the universe.”
Cas is filling out Dean’s tax form when he looks up with a pen in his mouth and says, “I don’t exist.”
Cas’s moans fill the room just as easily as his cock fills Dean’s mouth, shameless in how he wants. He presses kisses along Dean’s stomach that fill Dean in a different way, his lips soft in counterpoint to his hard cock. He uses one hand to balance, the mattress shifting under his weight, and the other to reach for Dean’s cock, drawing it out of his pants to stroke him to fully hard.
And he thanks a god he doesn’t believe in that she didn’t live through the worst life has to give and that missing her parents hits the depths of her trauma. She had a life, at least, one that was bright and shining, one that was hers. And now she gets a new life with Jody, Donna and Alex, with Cas and Dean, her surrogate family. The family she was always meant to have.
kevin nodded. “yes. he does. but you know what? sometimes what dean wants doesn’t matter. it’s what you want. do you get that?”
“Oh,” Cas says, looking down. “I’m not sure if I can mend it. My powers are weakening more and more.”
He thinks of men’s hands, and how he hasn’t let them touch him since Lee. He thinks of how it didn’t really mean anything with Lee anyway, because you can never get involved with hunters, Dad always said. Except it did, because Lee was Dean’s first, and it meant everything. And as it turns out, Dad was full of shit, because the whole Campbell family line were hunters and he didn’t know a goddamn fucking thing, he didn’t know jack shit about anyone, about his wife or his kids or his fucking
he’s not sure what he’s supposed to be getting from the film dean picked tonight. the homoerotic nature of men sparring shirtless, living together, and and wanting to build a paradise together seems to completely evade dean’s periphery, because cas doubts he would enjoy the film if he knew about it. or at least, he wouldn’t let himself enjoy the film in front of company.
He looks to his left to find Sam fallen asleep at his keyboard. Dean wakes him gently, prises him up from his chair, and deposits him on the other bed. His own bed doesn’t look as inviting as it did four hours ago.
“Cas, Cas, please,” Dean says, as weak as a newborn kitten. Cas kisses the head of Dean’s flaccid cock and tucks him into his pajamas again before shifting off the bed. He sits to the side of it, smiling down at Dean in a way that is so earnest and loving Dean doesn’t know what to do with it. His mouth is slack, there’s come on his face, and his body is boneless, melting into the mattress, once again a puddle of a human being thanks to the angel in front of him.
“We’re out of Budweiser. There’s a new keg in the basement. You know I’m not strong enough to lift those,” she says.
“I want to worship at the temple of your body,” he says, because he just says that shit now, because no matter how far he’s fallen he’s still an absolute freak.
When he drives the knife into Castiel’s heart, he feels fear, real fear, kicked-up dirt and spat-up gravel fear. He had promised himself since the week he spent at that house that he would never be weak again. He was never going to be one of those men that took. Never going to be one of those boys that was taken from. He would be strong, for Sammy, for Dad.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean says, opening his eyes to see Cas’s needy and wanting expression. His eyes are so blue in the lamplight, glassy and big, earnest in ways Dean’s only just beginning to feel comfortable with. “How about I blow you instead? You always like that.”
But Cas wants him. Cas desires him. Whether it’s fucking him into next Tuesday or holding his hand under the table at Dean’s favourite diner, Cas loves Dean so completely it floors him every time.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, his voice a deep rumble that sets Dean’s teeth on edge from how badly he likes hearing it.
Dean shakes his head. “Thanks, Cas. I just—needed to get it out of my head for a minute. Make sure I wasn’t going completely nutso.”
One of Dean’s favourite things to do, now that he can admit he not only wants these things but enjoys them, is to lie around in bed with Cas, either spooning with Cas’s arms around him and his face nestled in the back of Dean’s neck, or lying on him, face in Cas’s chest, feeling the warmth of his body. Right now, it’s a lazy afternoon and Dean is on his back, Cas on his side, their legs entangled like octopi, Cas’s palm cupped around Dean’s face, his own face mashed into Dean’s shoulder. Somehow, Cas can be comfortable no matter what contortions they find themselves in.
“Shut up,” Dean says. He can’t find anything to hold onto. This world is entirely alien to him—no Bobby, Jo or Ellen, and his own face walking around with a bad attitude. And that fucking thigh holster, Christ. Talk about tacky.
Dean laughs, and there are tears in his own eyes, as well. It’s the happiest moment of his life so far, and when Claire and Kaia come to visit that afternoon, Dean gets to tell them the news. Sam comes back from a hunt the next day, and Cas gets to tell him by virtue of being the only one awake at 3 am because Dean had passed out after another round of raucous celebration sex. They have a life together, and it’s good. They’re good.
dean shifts in his seat, drawing his foot close to his body. cas breathes out a sigh of relief at the decision being made for him. “i didn’t love it, i–” dean loses his words. “i just, you know, got through it. did it feel good giving into the animal instinct inside me? sure, yeah, i guess. i love the hunt, you know that. the fight. but it’s whatever,” he finishes, waving his hand. he turns his body to the tv, dropping his foot to the floor.
Cas’s hands are warm when they touch Dean’s shoulders. It was a cold night with the rain, but Cas is warm. He’s a constant source of heat at Dean’s side, too, and his fingers dig into Dean’s muscles with just the right amount of pressure. He sighs and sinks into the mattress as Cas presses into his shoulders, as he moves down Dean’s back, as he fits his thumbs beneath the wings of Dean’s shoulder blades.
Claire is a breath of fresh air in the fetid swamp of Dean’s life, a kickstart heart and a revved-up engine. At 18, she’s more powerful and self-assured than Dean was at 26. She lays her trauma out there for the world to see, and she revels in it, wearing it like armour. Dean doesn’t know how to let the world see him, but the truth of him slips through and she can see who he is, she can pin him like a butterfly to a board, like a body crushed under the front wheels of a Mac truck. She spears him with her ice cold wit and humor, and he loves her for it. And in loving her, he becomes the dad she didn’t have for six years.
Cas takes a look around the room and perches on the desk. There’s no chair, so why the hell there’s a desk is anyone’s guess.
Cas isn’t a slut, though. He slept with one woman, and then she killed him. That’s a pretty high price to pay for a one-night stand. And yeah, maybe Dean was a little harsh on him when he first stayed at the bunker, but the guy was walking around in a t-shirt and bike shorts, and Dean had to set him straight. The man looked ridiculous, and—something else that made Dean feel hot and angry. His thighs were thick as tree trunks, and the shorts clung to every inch of them. He can’t just—do that. There has to be some modicum of decency in the bunker. A dress code, if you will. It’s a guy thing, you wouldn’t get it.
Dean might be drifting to sleep, who’s to say, when Cas lifts one hand and presses it against the burn on Dean’s shoulder. Heat floods through him like a jolt of electricity. He gets really hard really fast and instinctively ruts against the mattress while Cas jerks back like he’d been shocked, too.
After two weeks of pouring non-stop over the lore, he’s asleep at 3 in the afternoon because he hasn’t slept in three days and Sam forced him to. He dreams of hands, hands touching and giving and loving, a mouth like a strawberry, rough and juicy at the same time.
Dean shrugs. “You know I never got along with my dad. Would be nice to get rid of all that shit. Like a new start, you know?”
“I made a deal with the empty—another deal. I said I would give up my grace and become human, so I never come back.” He smiles, sniffs, and pulls Dean in for a kiss.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas says, and he’s so hard, so turned on that pre-come beads at the head of his cock, and Dean waits for it, feeling himself grow harder with the anticipation, until a drop of it hits Dean’s tongue.
Cas’s pupils are blown wide and he gazes at Dean’s mouth while he talks as though he wants to eat Dean alive. “I don’t want to take it easy.”
Cas’s bedroom is across the hall from Dean’s, close. The door is open enough to let the hallway lights shine across him, illuminating the permanent bedhead, the soft creases in his face. The blankets move up and down with his breaths, but as Dean stands in the doorway and blocks the light, Cas sits up. He takes an audible breath, and gingerly peels back the covers on the side of the bed closest to Dean. Dean steps in, his heart hammering as hard as it has been all night, and closes the door behind him.
But Cas had to ruin it, the way he ruins everything. Until two seconds ago, Dean would have happily lived his life in pure bliss, remaining unerringly ignorant of their relationship crossing into borders he’d never traversed with anyone—at least, not a man, or at least not since Lisa. And that thought is a punch in the gut. He couldn’t make it work with Lisa, no matter how hard he tried, so how could he make it work with anyone? Especially C—
He tears the page. He scribbles. He tears the page. He scribbles. The black ink gets all over his hands, marking him. He tears and scribbles and tears and scribbles until the pen runs out of ink, and then he tears the rest of the pages until they’re all torn up into confetti. The room is a mess, and Dean doesn’t feel like cleaning it. In the morning, Sam will look at it, look at Dean, and think his thinking thoughts, but Dean won’t say anything and Sam won’t say anything. There’ll be nothing to say. Dean has issues, and Sam knows this. Dean has always had issues, and he has no way of working through them because he refuses to get help. At least he has the mental clarity to know what his issues are.
“Woah, woah, woah,” Dean says, pushing himself off from the outside wall of the motel. “You didn’t kill anyone, did you?”
Dean shrugs. He’s still lying on his back, so his shoulders go up towards the wall. He closes his eyes against the pounding in his skull. “My back aches, my head aches, and I’m pretty sure I tore something in my knee again.”
Cas nods, his eyes full of wonder as Dean leads him over to the crib where Jack is asleep, sucking on his own thumb. Cas starts crying again, leaning his head on Dean’s shoulder. He can hear the sounds of Claire, Sam and Jody making lunch in the kitchen, and Fleetwood Mac filters through the gap in the door to tangle around their feet. It’s a perfect moment. It’s everything Dean’s ever wanted.
He picks an Epiphone Les Paul, flaming red, 2 pick-up. Dean listens to him practice through the walls of the bunker, sitting on the ground with his back against the wall. Cas sits with him sometimes, shoulder to shoulder, his hands around a mug of coffee that he passes to Dean.
kevin’s point remained unclear, as did the reason why everyone spoke in code and no one said what they really meant.
Castiel is always looking at him, and when he’s not looking at Dean, he’s in Dean’s space. It’s like they’re tethered. Wherever Dean goes, Cas goes with him. Unless he’s got angel business, which happens less and less these days. Sam’s still off in Nebraska or wherever, because even though Dean saw what was going to become of them—that Sam would say yes to the Devil himself—Sam said it was safer to stay away, at least for now.
Dean serves up the burgers on brioche buns with a bed of lettuce and tomato and a slather of corn relish. Cas takes his with a fond smile. “Thank you, love, this is wonderful.”
Dean, laying a square of cheese on each burger in the pan, hums absentmindedly. “Yeah, you do. I can see you.”
It takes him three weeks to get used to the idea of seeing Mom again. He doesn’t tell her about his and Sam’s childhood. He doesn’t tell her about the things they did, they things that were done to them. He doesn’t tell her because he doesn’t have the words to even think it. It’s a jumbled mess in his brain, and he’s still not sure what’s real and what’s not.
Dean coughs and pulls the covers tighter around himself. “Yeah, I get that. I mean, you’re mine too, you know? Ever since hell, I’ve felt this connection. There are a lot of angels, but I got the best one in the garrison.” He’s not sure why he says this. Dean is a lot of things, but he’s not a sharer. He would have rather gone to hell than admit how scared he was about going to hell, but then he did go to hell, and he’s realised there are things a lot worse than being scared.
his eyes shine in the light from the tv as he points out different things he likes about the film, like marla singer’s hair and tyler durden’s stomach muscles, patting his own stomach and saying, “gotta lay off the cheeseburgers, am i right?” like it matters, like it’s important, like he’s ever going to. he would never admit this to sam, and cas feels warm in his chest that dean would say this to him. he’s letting his vulnerability show, his vanity, the part of himself that feels inferior to a man who is paid to have abs and doesn’t have them just as a side effect of his strenuous and physically taxing profession.
Dean’s dressed in his comfy pajamas, but Cas is naked, his favourite state to be in, regardless of where he is or what company they have in the bunker. It’s like now he’s done away with the ill-fitting suit and ugly trenchcoat, he likes the freedom of airing his jiblets in the breeze. He finally relented to wearing underwear around the bunker to save Sam’s sanity, but he usually steals Dean’s leftovers from the laundry basket, because he is, in all things, an absolute freak.
dean freezes. the film continues for a few seconds, and then dean says, in a very small voice, “it’s fine.”
“Yeah, that’s not creepy at all,” Dean mutters. Cas probably hears him, but he doesn’t acknowledge it. He waits patiently, making full eye contact, and Dean is reminded all over again that this is not his friend. This is at best his ally. This is a celestial being of light and energy that rescued him like a damsel in distress. This is someone who died for him. This is someone who threatened to put him back in hell at a time when Dean was so sure it was going to happen anyway, and so terrified. And now he’s offering Dean comfort. “Sure,” Dean says, because who turns down a massage? Cas has nice hands.
Dean drives him to the only music store in 20 miles and they look around. Jack picks up every instrument just to feel it, in love with the smooth wood of every guitar and leather of every bass drum. He tinkles piano keys. He holds up a flute and smells it.
Then he tips his head back as Cas presses forward, and Dean takes him in. Cas’s cock feels good, tastes good, fills Dean’s mouth up so perfectly it’s like they were built for each other. Dean doesn’t believe in soulmates, but he knows that he and Cas fit together in ways he’s never been able to with anyone else, not Cassie or Lisa, not even Benny. It’s no longer complicated with Cas. It just is.
So Dean and Cas hit up bars, drink until the morning, and have a fucking great time, thank you very much. Dean thinks about going home with the bartender, who’s wearing low-rider jeans and has tattoos up her arms, but then he looks at Cas, who’s picking at his burger mournfully.
But when Cas looks at his lips and then up at his eyes, Dean is exactly sure why. The lines coming out of his mouth are pick-up lines. Dean is
Dean wakes up from another dream about hell with a name burned into his brain. Shawn. The guy’s name was Shawn. Old Shawn, who smelled like diesel fuel and Camel cigarettes.
cas thought on that for a minute. “i like amy,” he said. “she’s very self assured. i’m glad she’s taking steps to make her life her own.”
Cas moves over to stand next to him, once again a wall of heat at Dean’s side. He’s solid and real and when Dean puts his forehead on Cas’s shoulder, breathing in the smell of his coat, Cas doesn’t move away. Instead, he produces a handkerchief from nowhere and dabs at Dean’s face.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, sure that he’s blushing under Cas’s scrutiny. “Okay, come and sit on my face. I’m not moving.”
But—Cas is not a man. And that undoes Dean in the worst way. Who are you if the one you are attracted to isn’t anything? He puts his head between his knees and breathes in the must of the bedspread.
Two days later, Dean’s staring down those eyes, but they’re wrong. They’re glassy this time, hazed over, perched above a beard that looks so odd on Cas’s face.
Cas uses his thumb to brush away the mess of his come on Dean’s face, pressing it into Dean’s mouth, and what can Dean do but lick it clean, tease it with his teeth, suck it in. Cas, the freak that he is, leans over to lick Dean’s face and neck clean and kiss him with the mouth that ruins Dean every time.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, looking at his hands. Jimmy’s hands. Not the hands that pulled him from hell. “I didn’t realise. I thought—I shouldn’t have done that.”
He’s still sucking on Cas’s cock, but he’s barely holding on, caught between how good Cas feels and tastes and the way Cas is trying to make him feel so good he dies. He’s under no illusions, though: if Cas didn’t want this even worse than Dean does he wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t rim Dean until he cries before they’ve even had breakfast. He wouldn’t shove Dean full of his fingers and tease a third orgasm of the night out of him. He wouldn’t pepper kisses across every inch of Dean’s body and say embarrassing shit like, “People used to build monuments to the sky in search of something as perfect as your body,” even though Dean’s put on a few pounds because all he does now is lie in bed, have mind-shattering orgasms, and eat cheeseburgers off Cas’s stomach.
Dean’s heart pounds in his throat like a man walking on a tightrope. The city spreads out before his feet, and one misstep could cost him everything.
“No, not this time. Demons got here first. I think they’re doing the same thing I am: looking for God.”
It’s always there, in the back of his mind. He always feels unclean, the way Sam describes it sometimes, but different. Sam has this thing inside him. What happened to Dean is a touch on his skin, a taste in his mouth, and a smell in his nose. The feelings of it are so convoluted in his brain he can’t even hope to unpack them.
Dean loves nothing more than to be pulled around and reminded that Cas can make Dean do whatever he wants, because there’s a freedom in submission, there’s a freedom in letting himself go because his partner wants him to.
Cas says it so casually it stumps Dean for a second. “No, I think I—I think it’s better this way. I already don’t remember so much about my childhood. I want to hold onto the things I have, even if they’re bad.”
Cas tilts his head and Dean can tell he’s trying to figure Dean out, so he shakes his head and steps back. “Don’t read my mind, Cas, it’s weird.”
A sucking noise makes its way into Dean’s consciousness and he opens his eyes to see Cas stepping out of the wall that claimed him. His heart pounds a military tattoo in his chest and he shoots out of bed to pull Cas into his arms. He presses his face into Cas’s shirt and smells him.
that bubbling thoughts are still there. he wonders how long they will be, and what would unleash if he ever got the chance to act on them. they turn to the film he watched the day before with kevin while dean and sam went on a grocery run. kevin made him pay close attention to the part where amy talks about being a cool girl, going so far as to make cas watch it twice, and asking him pointed questions.
Cas kisses Dean’s shoulder sloppily before he throws the covers off them and moves up to the head of the bed. He helps Dean rearrange the pillows so that Dean’s head is elevated, and Cas throws his leg over, positioning himself carefully with his cock poised above Dean’s mouth, holding his body over Dean’s. Even though Dean doesn’t mind being roughed up a little, Cas is still the most patient and gentle man he’s ever been with, except when Dean begs him not to be, his voice cracking under the strain of Cas fucking him so hard he’ll be sore for weeks. He loves that, though, because every time he moves he’s reminded of Cas, reminded that Cas loves him, reminded that Cas wants him in a way no one else ever has.
he doesn’t know what to do with these thoughts, or the others he’s had about dean. they’ve always sat in the back of his mind, bubbling away like a stew for him to feast on in the lonely hours of the night, but now he’s human they’re more incessant than ever. sitting so close to dean on their movie nights, which happen more frequently the longer they go without cases, he can smell dean’s cologne and the lingering traces of sweat on his clothes, because the deancave is the one room without air conditioning, and the sun is unforgiving in summer. cas burns now. he had to rub aloe vera lotion on his shoulders, his skin stinging every time he touched it.
And when Mary dies—it hurts to consider that it was Jack. Jack says, “I understand,” and means it, and Dean is broken. He’s more broken watching his child kneel in the grass in a cemetery, just like the one Dean once knelt in when Sam fell into a hole, than he ever was at 8 years old.
This is how they usually spend their days, and for once in his life, Dean looks forward to every new one, whether Cas is making him see God or making him coffee. It’s a good life that they have together, and everything they went, all the pain and the hurt and the love, has been worth it.
Cas ruts against Dean’s hip, more insistent now, and Dean reaches down to fondle him. Cas’s cock is thick and hard, getting harder under Dean’s hand, but it’s not long until the telltale whine escapes Cas’s throat signalling for more.
“Dean,” Cas says again. He puts his fingers beneath Dean’s chin and brings his head back up so he can breathe properly. “I know. I saw you in hell. I remade you, with all your memories. I know everything.”
Dean kisses him again, just for the hell of it. Cas’s hands roam over his chest, brushing his nipples in a way that makes him moan into Cas’s mouth.
Dean wants to ask him to stay—he wants it so badly his teeth hurt—but he can’t handle the rejection of Cas saying he has somewhere else to be, somewhere that isn’t with Dean. But as he passes, Cas reaches out to grab his hand, the meat of it between his wrist and pinkie finger. Dean stops in his tracks.
Dean’s a bit more awake now, because Cas’s dick elicits a Pavlovian response in him that sets his heart racing and his mind ticking, no matter how much pizza he’s eaten in the last hour. He wants it too, of course he does, but he’s in his forties, his knees are going no matter how much Cas heals him, and getting fucked through the mattress by the steamroller of Cas’s body doesn’t always appeal to him. Sometimes he just wants a quick handjob and a cuddle, so sue him.
“What the fuck—” Dean says, stopping himself from doing anything else. He rolls back to sitting, pulling the corner of the bedspread over his crotch as he looks at Cas. “—was that?”
Dean feels tears prickle at the corners of his eyes. “Even though he said—he said if I didn’t let him, he would take Sammy.”
“You know, we can make it official,” Cas says. He’s still beaming, and Jack’s still eating his french fries. “We could get married.”
Cas nods quickly as though he’s thankful for the excuse, and follows Dean out of the bar. The night is cool and smells of soft rain, the gravel crunching under their feet as they make it over to Baby. Dean waits a beat as he stops.
“Um,” Dean says, before he sits up. He pulls his shirt over his head and tosses it in the direction of his duffel, acutely aware that Cas is standing over him, waiting for him to lie on his stomach. When he does, his heart jackrabbits at full speed, his head pounding from more than pain.
They don’t look at each other. They stand shoulder to shoulder, facing different ways. It almost feels like a goodbye. Dean is rooted to the spot by Cas’s hand on his, this warmth, this connection that only they share. It is as unique as Cas is.
that he’s sure bleeds into both his prayers and his sleep. Every night he prays, and for months and months it’s just him, Benny and the promise of getting out. It’s like a jail sentence with teeth.
content warnings for dean's psychological damage and internalised homophobia. also spoilers for fight club.
Lucifer wears Cas like a knife to the gut. Looking into Cas’s eyes and seeing someone else, someone evil, someone who only knows destruction, is worse than never meeting him at all. Dean entertains the thought, if only for a second, that killing him is worth it. But he can’t. He can’t drive that blade between Cas’s ribs, even if the thing looking at him isn’t Cas. He can’t do it, because losing Cas is worse than anything Lucifer could do to him. Dean is broken in ways that defy description, but it’s mercy, is what it is, to drop his blade and sink to his knees and pray, once again, for Cas to come back.
“Sorry, I—“ Dean’s head hurts. He’s panting and sweaty, and he tweaked his knee. “Sorry, I can’t, I just—“
Dean’s heart hammers hard enough in his chest it’s in danger of giving out. He sits in a silence that until two seconds ago wasn’t loaded. Until two seconds ago, their relationship was normal. It was two guys having fun, watching movies, eating the burgers Dean made for them, drinking beers in the back garden as the afternoon light died and the fireflies rose with the moon. You know, normal, heterosexual, guy stuff.
Dean takes breaths just deep enough to fend off an incoming panic attack. The Narrator looks for Tyler, and tells Marla he’s not here.
privacy from each other. They have to keep the magic alive somehow. He shovels all his papers aside to find the small box, feeling it in his hands as he hurries back to the kitchen.
He sat up straighter when he saw Dean jogging towards the Prius. Castiel rolled the window down and Dean bent to talk to him, arms crossed on the roof, the sides of his open flannel fluttering.
“Dean, why did you drive all the way here in the middle of the night in the middle of a thunderstorm?”
He was on the ninth bed and halfway through the second bag of manure when Dean came out to check on him again. Cas felt like some grimy goblin, crouched and sweating behind the garden beds, dragging around a bag of the worst smelling crap he’d ever had the displeasure to meet. This was probably just how Dean thought of him, anyway. A sack of shit with a sack of shit.
“Wh—“ Castiel looked down. The chicken from earlier was wandering away, apparently disinterested now that it had, indeed, untied his shoe. He looked back up to find the man smirking at him.
Castiel threw him a skeptical sidelong glance; there was too much humor glittering in Dean’s eyes. Braced, Cas reached into the nesting box, wriggling under the fluff of the hen’s body and just waiting for her to snap at the exposed skin of his forearm. What was the point of the gloves if they hardly reached past his wrists?
Castiel sipped it cautiously, the ice smooth and cold against his upper lip. He set it down. It was, frustratingly, the best lemonade he’d ever tasted.
“Grab some bowls, top left behind you. Silverware’s over there.” Dean said, taking the lid off the bowl. There was pasta inside.
But this wasn’t about deals, was it. This wasn’t about chickens, or untied shoes, or blood, sweat, and tears. He was sat here pulling ridiculous strings all because of a pair of steady green eyes that mirrored the vibrant green
“I don’t care how far you torque up the charm. You’re just wasting my goddamn time, and your own. The only way you’re leaving this farm with
Sam draped Cas' rescued trench coat over Eileen's shoulder, breaking away to creep up to Dean's motel room window, ready to bang on it and crow HAPPY NEW YEAR at the top of his voice. Eileen was already giggling when she saw Sam completely lock up, mouth agape. Her stomach tightened.
For the second time that night, Dean found himself nearly winded when Cas braced against the sofa arm and shoved, launching Dean to land against the other arm of the couch. Instead of using the opportunity to escape, however, Cas just swiped the remote from the coffee table and propped his feet up, flipping on the tv. The waking screen bleached the room in a thin, white light. Dean squinted against it.
He glanced towards the bowls drying in the dish drainer as he pulled a beer from the fridge. Damn, and the way Cas always seemed
Cas looked up to find Dean blocking the sunlight. He’d changed into a soft grey henley, clean and dry, and Cas tried not to burn with jealousy.
The slump of Dean’s body across the seat means that his head is the only thing supported, and it has his neck at a bad angle. If Dean's an angry sleeper, he's even worse with a crick in his neck and Cas doesn't love the idea of being stuck in a car with
“Cas!” He called, in as much of a whispered shout as he could manage. It was past eleven, and if they— if
Two, a packed room full of buzzed strangers meant he had to turn on the charm, and he just didn't feel very charming after such a long fucking day. Plus, the collar of his coat wasn't quite high enough to hide the stinging scar angry across the back of his neck, just cutting into the hairline, and he'd be happy to avoid the cheeky improv that curious eyes required. The gash was a souvenir from the hunt, just par for the damn course. Bitch had dragged him across the scrap-laden floor of the workshop and thrown him into a bench before Cas got her beneath the shoulder blades. Dean was still acutely aware of his back and all the ways in which it smarted, so, better he just continue to laze around here on his stomach.
just Dean’s everyday, average breakfast. He loaded a corner of the toast and tried to imagine eating this without feeling bowled over by the sheer bursting flavor of everything.
“She won’t bite, swear on my life.” Dean said. Cas was surprised by the sound the first bit of milk made on the bottom of the pail. It hit with more force than he’d expected, the sound high and tinny. “She might knock it out of your hands, though, if you keep standin’ there teasin’ her like that.”
“You know what?” Dean said, tossing the paper onto the table and leaning back in his chair again. “You’ve convinced me. I’ll negotiate.”
Dean crams up against the driver’s side door, crossing his arms over his chest, leaning his bent knees against the back of the seat between himself and Cas. He’ll worry about bootprints on the leather upholstery when he isn’t so fucking exhausted.
to hear that! You know you can ask for company, Cas, that ain't weakness, that's just basic human needs! If I can drive here in the middle of the night in the middle of a thunderstorm, I can get here any time!”
He rinsed out his mouth, stared at his reflection in the mirror for a long moment, and then turned out the light.
with greenery, bursting with thick and glorious plants that looked full and happy in the sunlight. Beyond the beds he could see a tall white fence, almost missed behind a dense row of corn and sunflowers. An open gateway broke the line of the fence, and beyond that Castiel could see rows and rows of more lush plants, some trained as tall as himself, the dirt beneath them protected by some sort of black plastic. On this side of the fence and among the raised beds there was a half-hidden structure like a shed, and as he ventured closer Castiel realized, with a pang of surprise, that it was a miniature version of the farmhouse. The front door was painted the same faded green, it had the same dark shingles and white shiplap siding, but then stretching off to one side of it was a covered run of yard fenced in by chicken wire. A few chickens were inside the run, gathered around plastic waterers.
, because he was content in who and where he was and completely unburdened by the need to impress or excel.
Castiel let that bounce off of him and drop away unacknowledged. “My grandparents had a farm. They —“
Castiel ran the cold tap and splashed his face and the back of his neck. He used the hand towel to scrape off the dirt and sweat and then just dropped it, crumpled, onto the side of the sink.
Dean only realized he’d closed his eyes when lightning flashed and all he saw were his eyelids. He pulled back.
“Welcome to stop number whatever-this-is on the Winchester Farm Family Fun Tour.” Dean said, and hopped up to swing one leg over the pigpen fence. “My muddy gals.”
He patted the roof of the car and turned away in the direction of the barn. Castiel swallowed hard and rolled up the window. The scent of Dean’s aftershave still lingered.
“Make yourself cozy.” He said, turning to the sink and soaping up all the way to his elbows. He scrubbed extra hard at the yellow residue on his arms. “You want some lemonade?”
of the grandfather clock’s pendulum in some room deeper in the house, and the soft, merry tinkling of the wind chimes on the front porch. One of the ice cubes in Castiel’s lemonade popped.
Castiel squinted upwards. There were several white, fluffy clouds morphing and drifting against the clear blue. Dean was pointing to the biggest one.
Dean turned his head until his lips pressed into Cas' hair. He wasn't alone now, and Dean would never give that phone call a reason to happen again. He closed his eyes and tucked his cheek to the top of Cas' head, the next film starting to a completely inert audience.
The trouble is, nothing short of a fucking catastrophe could pull his eyes away from this. Dean is so beautiful, so calm and easy in his slumber, and he's right
From somewhere behind the fence, the black plastic rustled and then crunched in the distinct pattern of human footsteps.
Castiel swallowed hard and looked down. Christ, he knew what he was, what he’d turned himself into for the sake of a paycheck. He was a horrible, soulless automaton. He was nothing but a front sent in to take the heat and return with the spoils, it was largely a thankless, vapid existence, it was ultimately
He unlocked the door and slipped inside. There were about two feet of front hall before the apartment opened into a small living room, furnished by a grey couch, a scuffed-up coffee table, and a flatscreen tv balanced on top of a unit that they’d frankensteined together using bits from the as-is section at IKEA. The curtains were still wide open, a stuffy grey light filtering in from the LED lamps in the parking lot.
The garage was detached, kitty-corner to the house, with four single garage doors. The second from the right stood open and Castiel pulled into the waiting darkness, tires squeaking on a finished cement floor. There was only one other car in the whole wide expanse of the garage. It sat at the far end, quiet and glinting, a long black vintage thing that Castiel couldn’t identify in the low light. He shut off the Prius and the headlights went dark, and then he couldn’t see the other car at all.
“Awesome.” Dean says in a tone that clearly doesn’t think so, and whips the car around to pull back onto the dark road. They immediately hit a pothole and Sam’s head bumps the ceiling.
Dean's skin was still buzzing, his heart somewhere between his throat and where it was supposed to be. Cas was shifting away, trying to apologize, and how could Dean let him when all the tumblers were falling into place and releasing the lock on the fundamental
Castiel started to creep towards the wayward chicken, lowering his hands to knee-level in what he hoped was an ushering gesture and not an invitation to bite. The chicken cocked its head to look up at him with one beady eye, taking an uncertain step away. He kept pressing forward.
Or, uh, hot. Giving him the power washer sure had been a choice, huh. It certainly hadn’t been necessary to make such a
“Yeah, because I was out here all night dying eggs just to pull your leg.” Dean rolled his eyes, crouching to reach into one of the lower nesting boxes and hold up a dark, coffee-brown egg with little freckles. “Different breeds can lay different colors. The factory farms don’t really go in for
Verbal attacks were just par for the damn course. Castiel had endured them at pretty much every stop and understood it was a threat response and not a true read on his character, so he always let them roll right off. The trouble was, he was still off-balance from the last blow that had, inexplicably, landed, and it meant that this one managed to stab right past his armor and into his soft, fleshy insecurities.
Cas pulled one of the eggs from the apron. There were droppings, bits of chicken-fluff and straw adhered to it.
Cas pocketed the first egg and reached under the next chicken, wary of the way she was watching him. Sure enough, she snapped out and he hissed, yanking his arm back. An angry red pinch throbbed on his arm.
Fun author’s update: I’ve just lost my job. 🙃 Guess that means I have more time to write. If you’d like to buy me a coffee while I process this breakup,
evident in his expression that pushed Castiel over the edge. He got to his feet so abruptly that he half startled
Or for the way he’d chugged that lemonade. He hadn’t even come up for air, or noticed the little bit that spilled past his lips and ran down the stretched line of his neck. Good thing he’d smelled like garbage.
Cas dragged the absolutely rancid bag of heavy manure to the nearest raised bed and lowered his aching body to crouch beside it. When he dug his hand inside, it stirred up another horrible cloud of stench that set him coughing again. The scent was
Dean snorted and started walking off. When Cas didn’t follow, he beckoned him over with an exaggerated arm motion.
somehow coming into contact, so he just bit the bullet and dumped the oats and barley into the trough, receiving a strong nudge to the arm before he could back clear, the bucket clutched to his chest. Dean gave an impressed whistle.
old. You fuckin... pleb shut up. Gimmie that." Dean said, wrenching the remote from Cas' unrelenting grip and then sitting on it. "It's called culture."
Dean froze. Cas didn't linger long, lips breaking from his with a small noise, and then Cas was looking at him, satisfaction falling to concern at Dean's expression.
of a gas stovetop burner. The handles of the empty milk pails clattered against their sides when Dean set them aside.
.” Cas said, pushing himself back to sitting. His heart was still racing. Dean paused in his approach in order to clutch his knees and laugh, and Cas scooped the wrapped sandwich from the grass, as annoyed as he was embarrassed.
He said it in such a throwaway manner, like it was nothing more than cold cereal and not one of the most elaborate breakfasts that Cas had seen in a long time. He looked down at glistening, bright red tomatoes and vibrantly yellow yolks, perfectly crisped bacon and golden-brown hash browns and wondered if this

close, just leaned into each other's spaces. Slowly, Dean wound Cas' tie around his hand, opened into the kiss, and
If you have personal experience with any of the above and I’ve made an egregious mistake in my depiction of their care or environment, please let me know. Dean is a good boy and cares deeply about his farm kids (that includes all of them not just the goats haha goat puns).
God, it was fun to jerk this guy around, finding little ways to mess with Mr. Urban Development at every turn. He’d actually had plenty of time to collect eggs last night but he’d left them on purpose,
“CAS! What’d you fall and break a hip?” Dean called back over his shoulder. Cas hauled the box into his arms and followed out into the yard.
Dean held him for far longer than he’d ever allowed himself before, because obviously, Cas really needed it. Not because Dean fucking missed the hell out of this after weeks of nothing but texts and calls. And definitely not because if it was up to him, in some perfect world, he’d never,
Two large cardboard boxes stood open on the kitchen table. Cas was just tucking one last carton of eggs inside when he heard the sound of tires on gravel. Dean leaned backwards to peer down the hall and out the front screen door.
“That was Ozzy.” He said, and eyed Cas standing there startled. “You act like you’ve never seen a cat before.”
“She’s… beautiful.” Castiel said, and managed not to make it sound like a question. What did you say about someone’s cow?
The car jolted and bumped along the dips and ruts of the road, the headlights reflecting a greasy yellow on the many rows of trees that made up the front of the property. He finally cleared the trees, the farm proper opening up before him — and slammed on the brakes.
Cas watched him — the subtle movements of his back and shoulders, the way his leg stretched forward under Clementine’s body, the soft press of his hair against her side — and felt a stab of jealousy again. He’d never worked anywhere that brought him such contentment as to inspire humming like Dean was, quiet and a little disjointed, like he wasn’t conscious that he was doing it out loud. Or like he just didn’t
He approached the desk and leaned to try to see through the open office door behind it. There was, at least, a light on in there.
Castiel threw the car into park, letting his head fall back against the headrest. The farmhouse loomed before him, all weather-worn shiplap siding and dusty window screens, faded green shutters and a front porch jutting from the house like an underbite.
He let his head fall back against the headrest and shut his eyes, his mouth working in wordless frustration as he listened to the call ring through.
There were two stock pots waiting on the stovetop. Dean shoved all of the pails aside on the counter.
Rolling his head to the side, he regarded the folder lying in the passenger's seat with contempt. For all that it was just a collection of crisp paper print-outs, plot maps, and proposals, it might as well be a loaded gun. He scanned the yard for any signs of angry homeowners looking to get a head start on their outraged shotgun-waving.
“Bad fucking idea.” Dean snaps. “I wake up in the middle of the night and see you out there lurking, I might shoot you between the eyes. You’re staying in the damn car.”
still had the same neighbors living across from him, there were children to think about. But with the heavy rain and the approaching thunder, there was no way he heard Dean out here. He looked down at the keyring still gripped in his hand. There were three keys on it, resting against the bullet keychain. His car, his home, and Cas'.
“i’m gonna see what else i can find on the lamia,” sam looks exhausted when he gets out of the car, running a hand through his hair. “did you wanna order from that burger place we drove by?”

dean’s stomach is still… dirty, and they’re both avoiding it. cas’s legs are shaky, but he gets up, ambles over to the gross motel bathroom and grabs a wad of toilet paper. classy, right? it’s not like motels provide washcloths, this is… the best he can do for now. he comes back and wipes it up, grinning when dean jerks a little. he’s
“so get this. apparently, there’s been two new reports in the past hour, both about 20 miles from here.” he looks worried, a little defeated, “maybe something got in the way of them feeding last night?” he glances at cas for half a second, maybe

he decides on one of the more classic movies, something he watched with sam about a bazillion when they were teenagers. indiana jones: raiders of the lost ark. cas doesn’t bat an eye, and dean wonders if he actually wants to watch the movie, if he’s impartial or just doing it to make dean feel better.

“dean i think—i think… i’m gonna…” cas is a mess. his chest is heaving, some hair sticking to his forehead. dean has no idea how they’re going to look presentable for breakfast.
“cas!” through the thin walls of the motel. he went for a drive after that, and when he got back, mercifully, it was quiet.
for cas because… it was never the right time for something like that. hell, he’d grown up in a household where liking dudes wasn’t even an option; porn magazines and g-strings were practically shoved down his throat, it’s what he was used to. he’d been with so many women over the years and after cas came along he found himself almost sleeping with women
he smiles into the kiss, mouth falling open easily as cas pushes his tongue in. he's eager, but gentle, makes sure to give him time to wake up, to acclimate. dean’s groaning, letting his eyes close, letting himself focus on the feeling. this… this isn’t something they’ve ever done before. they kissed last night,
he stops at that, pats cas on the shoulder, gets up and goes over to his bag to grab his laptop. dean can feels cas’s eyes on him as he sorts through his duffel. dean’s muscles are tensed, waiting,
and dean’s breathless, barely holding on as cas continues to press his mouth against him and slowly shoving him up the wall further, wanting,
and dean rocks back, lets out a loud laugh. cas is still peering up at him, oblivious to the reason behind dean’s little outburst. he’s still learning human phrases, sometimes has trouble understanding the concept of sarcasm, and dean thinks it’s the cutest fucking thing in the world.
“you sure?” cas asks, concern thick in his voice as he pants, neck craning to try and see dean’s face more clearly.
“like those noises,” cas muses, gripping dean’s thighs with surprising strength. god, they’re probably going to bruise, and cas can’t even think about that right now, can’t process the fact that he’s already marked dean, permanently. “aren’t forced, really—” he tips his chin down to look dean in the eyes, to really look at him, “love how you sound,”
dean’s trying to work his hips down onto cas’s hand, squirming and bucking and making little noises. he’s so desperate that cas almost laughs, has to bite back his smile.
, that smile. he doesn’t even question why the lamia hadn’t taken dean, maybe dean found someone else and started ignoring her too. he wants so fucking badly to go home, to be back at the bunker in his room. alone. in the quiet.
cas’s lips are on his neck, sucking, licking, tracing every crevice. dean shivers as cas trails his hands along dean’s chest, keeping him upright against the wall.
, dean’s gonna cry and he doesn’t want to, is desperately trying to pull cas forward, trying to bring him close so that he can just get
to do the same. he swings his legs off the bed, moves to stand up, but— he’s too shaky, can’t get his knees to stay strong and he sways when he pushes himself to his feet, wavers, then— falls, knees giving out completely.
“yeah. the victims are picked up at bars it seems like, and… there isn’t really any consistency with where the bodies were found, one was in the house, another in a car on the side of the road. but they had the same greek character carved into their chest,” sam’s brows are furrowed in concentration, and dean’s only half listening, staring at the wall, trying to look anywhere but cas.
, it’s 3:34 am. dean hadn’t even realized he was out that late, he must have passed out at the bar for a few hours, and he doesn’t even know when exactly he fell asleep. fuck, he’s so tired, he just wants to cave in and lean on cas and let himself sleep, but… he turns away towards the bed and grabs some of his comfortable clothes from his pack. he just wants to
dean and cas are both quiet, a little shaky, but every time sam’s attention turns away from them, cas’s hand is on dean’s shoulder or lower back, rubbing circles and trying to ease the obvious discomfort on his face.
he’s reaching for it, tapping on the screen with closed eyes until it stops. dean falls back onto the bed, heaving a sigh because he—he should be getting dressed right now. an alarm going off means he has a monster to kill. he blinks his eyes open and his breath catches in his throat. cas’s face is smushed into the pillow next to him, one leg hiked up like it had been wrapped around dean for the remainder of the night. his mouth is slightly parted and his stomach is rising and falling steadily. dean feels something rise in his chest as he leans over and kisses cas’s forehead because,
, and dean was scared, so fucking scared one of them was dead, that one of them had to drag a corpse back home. cas was slumped against jack, barely holding himself up and— there was blood streaked down his face—
“um,” dean laughs a little, then blood’s rushing to his face, and he’s trying to talk, stuttering. “i— i think we’re supposed to—uh, meet..” he looks at cas, how fucking
,” dean almost sobs, wriggling around trying to push down harder on cas’s fingers. “cas. ple-e— ease,
dean’s always had a bit of a staring problem with cas, but now that he was human, it was so, so much worse. now that he couldn’t just… magick his clothes to be clean, he wasn’t always in that same outfit. he would lounge around the bunker in loose clothes and shirts that showed his collarbones and,
they aren’t usually this frantic, this sloppy, with their hunts. it’s been a long time since dean’s had to clean up something like this.
cas pulls away, dean chasing after his mouth, a little noise bubbling up from the back of his throat. but cas is leaning away, eyes on deans lips still, noticing how red and swollen they had gotten, glistening with saliva. cas slowly looks up to meet dean’s gaze.
“are we… d-do you… are you sure you want to do this?” dean huffs out in between breaths, gulping for air. because fuck, one minute they were just two guys refusing to talk to each other and the next dean is itching to get his hands down cas’s pants.
cas thinks dean’s shaking, can’t tell what he’s feeling but he— he can’t help it, his gaze flickers down to dean’s mouth. he loves his mouth, loves how it moves, how it looks. cas always has the urge to reach out, to touch his mouth, trace his lips with a fingertip. he didn’t understand that urge, hasn’t understood it since it began. he had always been so attached when he was an angel, but now that he was human… all his senses were heightened, his fingers tingling to reach out and run his fingers over dean’s lips, his neck, to wrap his arms around his waist.
dean obliges, slowly opening his mouth. then there’s fingers on his tongue, filling up his mouth, pushing down on the back of his tongue. he gags just a little bit, but when cas moves to take his fingers out, dean grabs his wrist, pushes his hand further in. the lube is strawberry flavoured, and dean’s found that he likes the taste, likes to lick it off of his toys after he uses them.
he can see sam creeping around the building, likely from somewhere in the shadows, and he’s sure he can hear the rustle of cas’s coat somewhere behind them, but— he doesn’t know how this is gonna go. he could try and grab the lamia, but they’re fast,
that isn’t along the lines of ‘oh, yeah. my drunk best friend hauled my ass back to our motel room last night, and proceeded to fuck my brains out.’ but he
“i’ll have the usual. if they have any interesting looking fries i’ll get those too.” cas nods, clicking a few times on the computer.
she’s just trying to please dean, isn’t imposing her own opinion on him, and— cas swears, for a second, that her eyes glow white. it could’ve been a reflection, could've been a shine from one of the lights in the bar, but they’re so dim that it just … didn’t make sense.
he should open the door, let sam in and hear about the case but— what if sam’s weird about it? about the fact that cas stayed the night. and there’s only one bed in the motel room. and cas is…
. dean turns, then slumps into cas, lets himself relax for the first time that night. he can feel his muscles loosen, feel how sore they are, can feel his feet pressing almost painfully into the ground beneath him.
he snakes a hand around her waist and gives cas a look as they side-step around him, a look that says
they find sam quickly. he’s got his nose buried in his laptop, a cup of black coffee tucked between his hands, hair back in a little ponytail.
into dean. dean lets out a shout in response as cas pulls out again and pounds back into him, finding a steady yet sloppy rhythm, the drinks from earlier not helping. deans moans and grunts are bouncing off the walls, feeling the room with obscene noises and he knows the entire floor can hear but he doesn’t care.
he’s rolling his hips, seeing how it feels when he moves them forward and back, side to side. he manages to lift himself, and when he pushes back down, he’s got his eyes squeezed shut, is letting out a broken little moan because— even though cas prepped him, even though he was stretched out, the fit is still so fucking
he must look sick, must look like he’s thinking too hard because sam’s covering his nose, shooting him a wide-eyed, worried look over the crackle of the flame—
, but he can’t find it in himself to care, is surging forward and kissing castiel hard. it’s messy and dean’s shaking, trembling because cas is still in him, still filling him up.
they’re down on his waist in less than a second, and he’s shoving him back into the wall, lifting him a little this time, smiling because, to cas, he’s so fucking easy to move around even without his grace it’s funny.
cas’s fancy drink is empty now, and his eyes can’t keep up with his mind. he’s a little… tipsy, yet another thing he isn’t used to that comes with being human. fuck, humans are weak.
him, brows furrowed as he studies something on his screen. he looks worried when he does that. dean fucking hates it, hates how personally invested sam gets in every single one of their cases. he understands, people’s lives are at stake, but— when it puts sammy in danger, part of him would prioritize sam.
“what show have you been watching?” dean scoffs, frowning down at his plate. he knows him and sam haven’t had the best history of communication. looking back over the years, dean has realized that a lot of problems could have been sorted out earlier if the two of them had just
“he looks like a fuckin’ bean pole,” dean whispers and cas steps on his foot. they’re too busy squabbling that they don’t even realize sam’s watching them, eyebrows high as they settle down in their seats.
“yeah, uh…” sam sets his bag on the little motel dinner table, pulls out his laptop with a sigh. he hasn’t said anything about the single bed yet, hasn’t even noticed that cas is still curled up on the mattress. right where dean had been. “so, we know lamia have a taste for the blood, like,
fuck, dean didn’t know that cas had called sam, and then they went to leave— cas hadn’t been thinking clearly, just wanted to get out of there. he forgot he called sam, forgot that he panicked and told him dean was seconds from fucking the lamia, and if sam’s acting like this—
“i’m fine!” dean calls from his position on the floor, thrashing around in the bedding and trying to stand up. he only trips twice as he makes his way to the door, being careful to not make eye contact with cas as he crosses the room. they can talk later. dean brings his eye to the peephole and almost yelps when he sees his brother standing on the other side. fuck.
his head is pounding when he rounds the corner into the motel parking lot, and he’s haphazardly parking baby in the first spot he sees open, throwing her into park as carefully as he can before resting his forehead on the wheel. he doesn’t want to get out, feels too heavy to even lift his head. for a second he really debates crawling into the backseat of the car, curling up and sneaking in in the morning, but…
cas is about to protest when a woman slides into the seat next to dean. she flashes him a big smile, lip gloss shining unusually bright beneath the shitty, cheap lights.
is handling humanity the second time around. he had lost his grace in a fight with some of naomi’s soldiers—apparently, they still had
she’s fit, has extra meat in all the right places, and dean can appreciate that. she’s got a pretty face, looks like every other woman at the bar, but dean needs a distraction, needs something to do with his fucking
.” dean pushes himself up a bit, arms shaking slightly. dean positions himself over cas’s cock, and he thinks he’s gonna drool, can feel himself losing his grip on what he’s doing. once he’s lined up, he spares a glance at cas and,
cas’s stare boring into the back of his head, can feel the white-hot anger in the air around him. god, he’s so cute when he’s jealous, but dean—
into the kiss, sending a shudder through both of them. dean continues to pump cas in between sloppy kisses, the pair quickly getting restless. their breathing becomes ragged and the kisses get messier, soon they’re just panting into each other’s mouths as dean jerks cas off while cas meets him in the middle with fast, short thrusts upwards.
sam watches the pair try to remain civil at his comment, has to fight a smile because they’re being so,
, keeps fucking into him as he rides out his orgasm, then, with one last, deep stroke, he’s cumming, letting dean fall limp atop him.
dean lifts his head off the mattress, not bothering to move the rest of his body. cas is back in the trenchcoat, seated at the edge of the motel’s chair, tapping his foot.
“shut up,” dean says, forces his voice to be deep. “d’you find anything on the case?” dean stumbles away from the open door, trying to wipe the exhaustion from his eyes, patting his face to try to wake himself up a bit more. he hears the click of the door shutting, the sound of the lock sliding back into place. it’s instinct, at this point.
when they pull away, dean’s eyelids are drooping, and he looks like he’s passed out, is just waking up.
cas whirls around, and then dean’s back is colliding with the wall, so hard that the wind is knocked out of him.
he tells sam the name of the bar, and then the call’s over, and it’s silent again. so fucking quiet. he can still hear the people inside, but out here…. it’s empty.
dean isn’t sure if cas is asking if he’s alright emotionally or physically because he’s been limping around the whole day, but he makes a noise in reply, tries to nod.
he doesn’t know how long he’s been out, doesn’t remember half of the night, but -- he was sober when he woke up, and that’s enough of a sign. the drive home was short, but tiring, and he almost fell asleep on one of the straight-shot roads, zoned out looking at the dark night ahead.
dean hear him, would make him understand, make him feel what cas felt. the alcohol in his system makes him feel stupid, like these feelings aren’t real, like they’re just… part of the influence.
“hmm?” cas blinks his eyes open-- he hadn’t realized they had fallen closed. they’re close enough that cas could count all of dean’s freckles if he wanted to, it feels like they have all the time in the world.
“duffle bag,” dean gasps, reading cas’s mind and motioning a hand at the duffle lying on the bed. cas sets dean down gently, making sure he can stand okay before walking over to ruffle through the contents of the bag. he pulls off his shirt as he walks back to dean, condom and lube in hand. cas unzips his pants, moves to push them down but dean grabs his wrist.
“sure,” dean mumbles, his mind elsewhere. he climbs out of the drivers seat and cas follows suit, closing the door to the impala quietly. dean gets upset when the doors are closed too hard, too loud. and castiel could
he knows he deserves more than this, at least that’s what he keeps trying to tell himself. he doesn’t understand why dean can’t get that through his thick, perfect fucking head. god, cas clenches his fists at his sides, his phone still on one hand and if he had his grace, if he wasn’t so painfully fucking human—that phone would be dust and the ground would be shaking and he would
“this.... this is okay right?” dean mumbles into cas’s chest. cas felt a twinge of emotion in his core. he had always thought about this, had dreamed about this and still hadn’t processed that dean was here with him. in his arms. it never occurred to him that this could be weird, he had imagined it so much that it always just seemed so
“two beers,” dean grumbles, leaning hard on his elbows on the surface bar, trying to block out the music, the smells, the voices. yeah it was his decision to come here but for once the sound and noises aren’t drowning out his thoughts. he isn’t even sure if cas wants a beer, but— if cas doesn’t drink it then it’s just more for him, right?
he opens his eyes, turns to say something snarky to distract the lamia from hitting him any more, but—
she presses her hand into his chest, trying to press him back against the car but he jolts a little, steps away from the impala. he doesn’t want to be pinned, doesn’t want to be so
but cas runs his fingers over the bruises on dean’s neck, not breaking eye contact, taking a few deep breaths.
the lamia places a hand on his chest, and it feels so… wrong. but he forces his smile to get wider, a little more
then they’re kissing again, but this time it’s more, it’s teeth and tongue and cas thinks he can taste blood, fucking
sam keeps talking, rambling to no one about the case, and dean’s rummaging through his pack, pulling out a new flannel and picking his jeans up from the floor, and walks into the bathroom without saying anything. sam probably won’t even notice he left. he avoids the mirror when he gets in there, strips off his pajama pants and steps into his jeans.
, he doesn’t know if he would be able to hold it for long. he slips his hand into his pocket, feels around for his lighter, and it’s still there. he relaxes, then glances at the lamia, seeing that she’s sizing him up.
“i’m sorry, sweetheart!” he forces a smile, a little chuckle, “must have lost track of time,” it’s hard to think of things to say when he can
cas stirs, face burrowing deep into the pillow as he tries to open his eyes, tries to fight the sunlight. god, it’s so fucking bright out, and it .
doesn’t want her to continue dropping monster juice on baby. it’s been too long a day and dean’s brain can’t seem to think fast enough like it’s done in the past, his quick wit that usually saves him from getting into situations like this seems to be failing him today.
, and dean wants to cry a little bit. he feels warm, comfortable, leaning into cas, holding his waist for support.
he kisses from the end of cas's shoulder towards his neck, breaking off every so often to let out little moans. dean continues to trail upwards, ending at cas’s mouth where they slot their lips together.
her fingers, the once delicate, feminine fingers are now long, black claws, and they’re at his jaw, then at his throat.
sam’s meticulous layout, and cas almost moves some of the papers to make room, but freezes when sam looks at him.
cas halts for half a second before pulling his fingers out, dean’s hole constricting around nothing.
that one bed. dean looks over his shoulder to where cas is to assess the damage. cas is blinking back at him, hair sticking out every which way and dean might be imagining it but fuck there looks like there’s a dean-shaped imprint on the bed where he had been laying next to him.
“hello.” a smile stretches across cas’s face. they look at each other for a moment, blue on green, almost as if they can’t believe the situation they’re in.
“dean?” cas’s voice sounds small and far away from the bed, and dean slumps back onto the floor, wondering if he should even try to get out of this tangle of sheets.
sam’s phone vibrates, and the table practically leaps, all three of them jumping a bit at the noise.
with him—but other than that? dean doesn’t know what went down, how the dominoes toppled. he and sam were tracking down some vamps that night, so he couldn’t be there to
he can hear cas breathing just as hard as the man walks over to him, resting a hand on his shoulder.
dean feels like hell the moment the door swings shut behind him, and he can practically feel how tense cas is behind him. all those years, he was trying to ignore his little
“how about we finish what we started yesterday, yeah?” he’s still shooting her that fake, too-kind smile, “lemme show you my
, it was too much for dean sometimes. he had never really allowed himself to think about cas like that, always pushing it to the back of his mind to deal with later but never opening that jar up again. dean had also never quite allowed himself to think about guys that way in general, is cas even a dude? was a dude? but now that cas is lounging around, looking so
“i-i uh,” dean’s tripping over his words, freezing up and, fuck, he knows he’s gonna blow their cover any minute because— he’s trying to think of something,
they stand like that for a few moments, the cool night breeze ruffling their hair, making dean shudder a bit. cas, surprisingly seems unfazed, has snaked an arm around dean’s waist and his holding him carefully. the door to the bar opens and shuts, people filtering out. a distant chatter fills the air, but— dean doesn’t move away from cas, just presses a little bit closer to him.
that night, a good few hours after sam and dean had returned from their hunt. neither cas nor jack were answering their cells, and—dean was so, so fucking scared that they just… weren’t gonna come back.
cas follows dean out into the parking lot, shuts the motel door behind them with a dejected little grunt.
, a little past the windows, away from where people can see them, and there don’t seem to be any street cams, but— they’re
, dean! and it looks like we had a reason to,” cas sounds upset, dean isn’t used to him acting so… human. so emotional. it’s a bit unusual. “you reek of alcohol. did you drive under the influence?”
the hunter’s reaching to grab at cas’s pants but—cas has beat him to it, has somehow gotten his hand between them, is rubbing his hand in slow, languid motions over dean’s cock.
dean types back, picking up his jacket from its place on the floor and glances at cas, who meets his eyes.
cas learned to do this during his time as an angel because here he was, grinning beneath him with a finger shoved up dean’s ass. do angels finger themselves? had cas—
“i believe so…” cas’s eyebrows are knit together as he worked the information together in his head. “i had been suspicious of that woman last night, but—”
problem, dean?” cas’s arm is pressing at dean’s windpipe, practically fucking crushing it, but there’s a shift in dean’s demeanor, a change that cas is too upset to notice. “i just want you to
“what was that?” cas tries, raising an eyebrow at dean, drinking in the high of seeing dean fall apart under him. he’s got two fingers in him already and cas pushes deeper, gets ready to push another third finger in, but—
, cas—” dean has no clue how cas got so good at this from the short time he was human, knows he hasn’t been with anyone since april. but he doesn’t question it.
“i wanted to apologize. i know you always have everything under control and i.. i didn't mean to come off as an authoritative figure. i always have faith that you know what you’re doing, dean. i hope you know that. i… i’m sorry. i hope you aren’t upset with me.”
, so that just turns into a nod, an apologetic expression. fuck, he’s lost his ability to flirt with women.
cas continues to work his fingers at dean through his jeans, his nails dragging gently up the material of his pants. he loosens his hold on dean, lets him drop into a standing position. he finally,
“are you alright?” dean hadn’t even realized he had his head buried in his hands, and he glances up at cas, blinking hard. the ex-angel has picked up the beer, is holding it in one hand like it’s a bottle of fucking apple juice.
he glances around the bar one last time as he leads the lamia out into the fresh air. sam isn’t inside, dean assumes he’s already hiding somewhere out back.
“leaving. now.” castiel’s reaching forward, grabbing dean by the bicep and starting to walk towards the car. he just wants them to get out, might be going about this the wrong way but he-- he doesn’t know what the fuck else to do! sam’s on his way, and dean was about to get himself killed just because he wanted some ass, and— he just wants to be back, wants to go back to when dean was sleeping this morning. he looked so fucking
“jus’.. put it on the floor,” he says quietly, tugs cas close again, and… he looks so desperate for that, for cas to stay and not leave and he can’t just… leave him. cas rolls his eyes and climbs onto the bed, the mattress dipping where his knees are, throwing him a little off balance. dean just hums and tugs cas down so they’re lying next to each other.
cas doesn’t seem very satisfied with that answer but doesn’t protest when dean leans down to kiss his cheek, still smiling widely. in between kisses dean reaches down and wraps his hands around cas’s cock.
he’s trying to keep calm as to not alert the creature, but— dean’s too distracted, watching the girl speak, enthralled in some story about when she lost her dog or something. he sighs. is dean just… going to keep ignoring him? all fucking day?
“dude, it’s 2 pm. did you… just wake up?” sam steps into the room, his laptop bag hanging haphazardly off of his shoulder, the pockets stuffed with books and papers.
it was a little embarrassing— they never, ever show affection like this. of course, sometimes there’s pats on the back, a little bit of face-holding, but— never like this.
know, right? cas is bouncing his leg up and down under the table, and every so often his knee knocks into dean’s. every time it happens, dean startles, tenses.
at me.” cas is staring at him with those piercing cerulean eyes, is grabbing him gently by the face and making him look forward, look
“okay, yeah,” dean’s brows are furrowed, eyes scanning back and forth trying to process the information as best he can in the state he’s in. “but i thought you were staying at the bunker? keeping an eye on jack—wait, where
far behind, and sam turns to see where they are. is he smiling? he’s fucking smiling, all smug, like he’s just superglued dean’s hand to his beer again, and dean wants to punch him. he said it too loud, and sam must’ve heard him, and he—
as he chases climax, head starting to grow heavy. his moans are getting shorter, louder, hiccupping with each of cas’s thrusts up and dean’s got tears in his eyes, it’s so good. he’s gonna come soon, and cas knows, bracing on his thigh, fucking up into him
“such a shame…” when he speaks, his voice seems to have dropped two octaves, and dean’s head fucking spins. “what should we do, then, baby?”
Cas cast his eye over the long stretch of raised beds. There had to be something like twenty of them, at least twelve feet long and four feet wide apiece. It was a lot of plants.
?” Zachariah said, and Castiel clenched his jaw, dropping his eyes to the footwell. “Castiel, this sunburnt hay-raker is jerking you around. This is not how we do business. You know better than this.”
For too long, there was nothing but the rustle of paper, the quiet hum of the refrigerator, the steady
“Heya, cutie.” He said, and dropped into the pen to pat her pink body. He waved to the other two pigs lounging in the shade of a squat shelter, barely four feet high. They were both enormous, their coarse pink bodies spotted in black like rotund, porky Dalmatians. They had fuzzy ears that were drooped forward over their eyes.
“Didn’t have much time to spruce the place up for visitors.” Dean said, clapping Cas’ shoulder and causing him to sway forward. “I normally gather eggs when I’m tucking the girls in for the night, but certain
Cas feels too big for his own skin. It’s something a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent should be entirely familiar with, but this isn't the feeling of cramming a Chrysler building into a 5-foot-11-inch frame.
The murmur of constant din coming from across the street suddenly gathered into a loud, collective chant of raised voices.
about.” He said, as gentle as the shift of a thumb to reveal something precious in cupped hands. It was like all the butterflies in Cas' chest suddenly exploded outwards, taking his breath with them.
Dean dialed his voicemail box as he dug the Impala keys from his jacket, the familiar metal shape tinkling against the shiny bullet keychain he kept on the ring.
Cas went to plunk down on the padded bench but jumped back in alarm when a shape darted suddenly from underneath it. Dean wasn’t phased at all, he just watched the dark thing run across the yard as he reached for the screen door to go inside.
Besides, if he actually managed to pull this off, it could mean big things for him. Maybe his superiors would finally sit up and pay attention, maybe they’d finally think about paying him more like what he deserves. Maybe he would finally be able to afford something nicer than his shitty one-bedroom apartment with its defunct dishwasher, that one window that won’t close all the way, and the buckling bathroom floor.
He slapped his briefcase closed and set it on the other bed, then stripped down to his boxers and carefully folded his clothes. Through whatever tortures Dean might decide to inflict upon him, he would have to remember — respect, a raise, and relocation could be waiting for him on the other side. Nothing worth having ever came easy, right?
across the chest, sleeves snug around thick biceps, the soft fabric clinging to his sternum dark with sweat.
for her. Two weeks, every day, sunup to sundown. If, at the close of those two weeks, you are A) still here, and B) still want to destroy her, I’ll sign her over.” He gave a loose, magnanimous shrug. “Those are my terms. Take ‘em or leave ‘em.”
There wasn’t much by the way of mud inside the pen, unless it was under the thick layer of straw. There were, however, three pigs. The smallest one came trotting up to where Dean straddled the fence, looking up at him, her flat pink nose twitching.
"Having fun?" Dean said, shaking his head to dislodge the confetti. Cas reached out and brushed the colorful shreds from Dean's hair and shoulders, that bright, boyish humor still dancing in his eyes. Dean knocked his hand away and shifted to sit up at the end of the bed, definitely
He grabbed the damn folder and hauled himself up out of the rental car, the gravel crunching under his shoes. The afternoon sun beat down on him from the bone-dry central Kansas sky, making him squint hard. On the front porch, a small set of wind chimes tinkled gently to itself in the stagnant breeze. Castiel eyed the rampant weeds that spilled from the flower bed beside the porch steps, a ratty mess of tall stems and dense, scrubby vegetation with sporadic flowerheads that poked through the balusters of the porch railing like the faces of curious children.
Clementine shifted on her back legs and Cas was sure he was about to see her foot go right into the bucket, but Dean just moved it out from under her and dumped what he had collected into the other waiting pail, through the cheesecloth. He resettled and kept going, the milk hitting the empty bottom with that high tinny noise again, and he started humming as he worked.
Dean's chest felt tight. He thought back to the way that he found Cas, lying on the couch in the dark. How Cas had grabbed him, how tightly he’d clung to him. Like Matt Damon in that Matthew McConaughey space movie, isolated on a distant planet for years. He had seemed so small. So broken.
"Hey hey hey! Boots on the furniture!" Cas yelled, trying to knock Dean’s legs down as he pulled them up onto the sofa. Dean turned his back and used it to shove against Cas instead.
“Man, you gotta figure out your levels. Last person who looked at me like that had me thinking marriage."
That had been a theme all day, hadn’t it. Dean shouldn’t be finding this jackass cute at all, no matter how small the ways.
He dumped the contents of the folder to study in its entirety, rubbing a finger thoughtfully across his bottom lip as he read. Castiel watched him with unease. The client was reviewing the material, that should count as a step in the right direction. But he could practically
