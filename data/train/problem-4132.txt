Notes: I’m going to stop it there! Not because I like the cliff hanger but because I’m not the greatest at smut and it takes some ‘research’ to write it just right. Ha. Puns. Anyways, when it does happen I’m not going to be picky about ‘tops’ or ‘bottoms’. Personally, I think none of it matters as long as they get the “Dom” and the “Sub” right. For this work of fiction’s purpose, Dean is a ‘sub’ and Cas is a ‘dom’ but who cares right? Hope you liked this edition of Destiel Trash- From your local dumpster! (me)  *I know my notes are WAY too long. I don’t care. >=3 ;3
Castiel’s POV
Confused as to if he should laugh or prepare for attack he sits still. She slaps him on the shoulder. “Damn. You must have had a lot of shit happen to you, relax Winchester. It was a joke.”
“Great, I’ll call it in.”
“I’ve been keeping a close eye, now go home. You’re beginning to bore me.”
“No! We were watching movies and he picked out fucking Brokeback Mountain Sammy. Brokeback Mountain! I can’t watch that! And so I told him it was a gay cowboy movie and he said so because he thought it meant happy and then I told him it was about guys liking guys! And he still didn’t understand and I just explained how gross it was. Because come on Sammy. Let’s face it, it’s gross. But I was gonna watch it anyways because it has Hathaway’s tit’s in there but he left.”
Still shocked at the angels words he sits there taking in what just happened. He looks at the angel for what feels like the first time, often times he would look at him but he never truly
Kicking the door open it jars Sam awake from his post at the door. “Dean?!” “Sammy-It’s okay. Cas is fine. We need to get him to the Impala, I might have to take him to the ER. This looks beyond anything even your stitching and whiskey can fix.” Blinking a few times at the sight of his older brother carrying the angel he nods. “Sure-sure. Do you need help?” “I got it. You get the joy of doing a medical exam. Have fun with that.” Rolling his eyes, Sam leads the way in front, checking corners just in case. When they make out to baby, Cas is asleep in Dean’s arms, head against the plaid covered chest. “Ain’t he a little angel?” “Uh Dean? If he has a concussion he doesn’t need to be asleep.” “I checked inside, he seemed okay, and I didn’t see him hit his head on the way down or anything. When he woke up he said he was human, so maybe his body just gave out to exhaustion?” Shrugging, Sam opens up the back seat, “Here’s hoping. Put him down carefully, try not to jostle his body too much, if he has any broken bones it’ll only hurt him worse in the end.”
Silently unlocking the door, he sneaks in and is shocked to find Sam sitting up with a parent look. “Young man, do you know what time it is?” Rolling his eyes he takes off his dad’s leather jacket, “Sorry, I thought you were asleep, I couldn’t catch any Z’s so I went out for a bit.” Clearing his throat, Sam laughs “Cleary” he says pointing at his neck.
. Masculinity be damned. “You don’t remember?” All the response the angel can muster is a slight head shake. Carefully, Dean runs his calloused hands slowly through the angel’s dark hair, searching for a head wound. No blood, no bumps, but he doesn’t want to remove his hands from the dark hair, it’s so soft. How had he never done this before?
A hunt gone wrong led him to kneeling on the ground crying over the angel’s broken body. No matter how hard he screamed and cried the angel wasn’t coming back. Not this time. Holding the angel’s bloody face in his hands he cries over his best friend’s body.
“A damn hello every now and then would be nice. You Winchesters are all the same.”
coffees she smiles knowingly at the angel.
Feeling this sense of longing he looked around to see if an angel had fallen close to his location causing the feeling. Cas. Cas. Castiel! The words were broken like he was trying to listen to a radio with static. Maybe he was still an angel after all. Please. I need you. Dean. He was now running towards the lights of a gas station, he had to stop very quickly though because he was out of breath. Sam. Sam? Sam was supposed to be finishing the trials to close the gates of hell, it must have went south. Angels. Falling. Dean must need his assistance in healing Sam, he didn’t want Sam to be hurt but there was nothing he could do. Please, please don’t be dead. Dean’s voice stopped, and he began to run again to reach the gas station. Feeling around in his pockets he found a few bills, but no change. There was a payphone outside but somebody was using it, “Hang up the phone.” The very large man turned around and frowned, “Excuse me?” “Hang up the phone now or else.” “Hey man, hold on I have to kick some dude’s ass.” “I’m sorry” I say before pressing his palm to the man’s head. Nothing happened. The larger guy raised his eyebrows, and twisted his arm. Man that hurt, guess he was human. “I uh I’m sorry.” “You will be.” Realizing what was fixing to happen he sprung into fighting mode and blocked the other man’s punch. He punched him in the throat and the man passed out. He hung up the phone and dialed Dean’s cell phone.
“You don’t like coffee?”
“Dammit, if you don’t stop I’m going to make you crawl out of hell. Now there is something I didn’t mention before, when I singed it to ashes it also burned away your grace, so you are now officially human.
angel. Castiel, or Cas, was their friend, but the way Dean talked and looked at him made him think there was something more. Never in his life had he looked at somebody with that much passion, except one. Jessica. Since her, he’d never looked at anybody like that again. Waving a hand in front of his face Dean looks at him with a confused look. “What are you thinking so hard about?” Shaking his head clear he smirks “Nothing, um so did you say we had worked a case here? I think we did actually, sometime after Dad died.” It still hurt Dean to think about their father, but he had grown used to the cold feeling it brought on.
“Good morning Dean.” He said walking into the kitchen. The smell of bacon drifted through the small room.
Cas pulled away playfully and looked at Dean.
After thanking Dean for the ride he got out and made his way to his door thinking about how nice the Winchesters were to him. Still not over that Dean called him Castiel he frowned, wondering what could have changed. He didn’t want Dean to give up on being his friend, but this time he was successful at pushing people away. Anna was in the kitchen awaiting his return, “Hey Cassie, how was school?” “Fine” he mumbled trying to hide his cut up face. “Come here I made your favorite.” On the table were a couple of cheeseburgers made the way he liked them. “What happened? Why are you all cut up?” “It’s nothing. I’m fine.” “No its not. I’m going to your school tomorrow to talk to them about these punk ass kids who keep beating up my little brother. Why do you let them do this to you? I know you know how to fight.” “So? You know I don’t like confrontation. Thanks for the burgers.” “No problem Cassie, so who brought you home?” “Dean, he’s new.” Blushing he finished his burger and left before she could question him about him. Logging onto his computer he ignored the many messages on his Facebook, and logged onto Tumblr instead. It was his safe place and everyone he followed adored him and cared about him, unlike the people in reality. Nobody ever gave him a second glance that wasn’t family except for Dean… Tomorrow he would apologize to him for being so rude and ask him to be friends. Looking online for a potential blog of his he instead found Sam’s. Sam Winchester, Future Lawyer, Book lover. Laughing at the blog he scrolled most of it was reblogged from somebody else but he stopped when he found an entry from a couple of weeks ago.
Dean laughs sarcastically. “Have you seen Sam recently too, or is this just a social call?”
When they’re both finally ready to go Dean is
Pulling back to see the angel’s face he holds it slightly “Yeah-yeah I’m here man, are you okay?” “Is this not invading your personal space? I feel this would usually make you uncomfortable, what happened?” Shit, the poor guy must have a concussion and holding onto him this tightly probably isn’t helping, but he doesn’t want to let go,
“Shut up,” he said jokingly.
The mood quickly changes and she snarls at him
“Bobby’s your dad?”
“Bless his heart that must have been tough on him.”
“Yeah it’s nice when that happens.” Dean then takes his plate and switches it with the angels.
“Oh. Okay. Waffles and bacon, but can I have a water?”
Putting the laptop down, he sits on Dean’s lap and wraps his arms around him. “I’m so sorry Dean, I love it, and it was still a surprise. When is it?”
“He uh, he’s my Dad.”
"No, but I'm telling you now, Dean Winchester you are the most gorgeous man I've ever met. And I've met a lot."
He woke up to the smell of something cooking, groaning he rolled out of the bed. In the kitchen Dean was cooking something a frying pan, “Morning Sammy.” “Morning. Where’s Bobby?” “He said he’d be back around five. Sit down, I made us some breakfast.” Sitting down he looked at his plate, “Since when do you cook?” “Since forever. Eat your veggie omelet.” Trying the egg production his brother made he chewed carefully, surprisingly it was good. “You like it? Mine has bacon and stuff in it, but I knew you would want some veggie stuff in there.” “Yeah it’s good. Thanks.” They ate in silence and when they were done he went to pick up the plates, but Dean stopped him. “I got it. Go unpack.” Nodding he went to his new room and unloaded the few items he had. When he returned Dean was on the couch watching TV. “Bobby working a case?” “Don’t know, I doubt it if he said he’d be back tonight though. I wouldn’t worry about it.” For the next couple of hours he sat on the couch and watched Dr. Sexy with Dean. When his brother started to snore next to him, he pulled the remote from his hands and changed the channel. Nothing good was on so he settled for the news instead, mostly it was about the possibility of war with some foreign country, and he was barely paying attention when the door opened. Bobby came through with a huff, “Hey Sam. Where’s Dean?” At that moment Dean woke with a start, “what is it?” “Son we have a small problem on the school front. We need to talk.” “Alright. What’s up?” “I enrolled you in Sioux Falls High but they said you would have to stay in the eleventh grade because you’re lacking some credits or some bullshit, I don’t remember, but Sam here is going to be there with you and they said he could skip a grade if he wanted to.” Skip a grade? It was true his brother never cared for school but it wasn’t like he was an idiot, most days it was because they were too busy working a case. He however was always making sure Sam did his homework and studied because ‘You don’t throw away a genius.’ As if, he wasn’t a genius, Dean was smarter than him at times especially at hunting. “Sammy” a pair of hands were snapping in his face. “Huh?” “So what do you say? Are you going to skip a grade or not?” “I don’t know or care honestly. School is the furthest thing from my mind right now.” “Son I know you haven’t lived a normal life for the past 13 years but all that is about to change, so that includes school. You’ll like it there, and besides you have another couple of weeks to get comfortable with it.” “Yeah you’re right, Dean?” “Yeah?” “Do you think I should skip a grade?” “Hell yeah you should, that means you won’t have to go to high school any longer than necessary and go to law school like you always wanted.” “Law school?” “Um yeah I’ve been thinking about it.” “Good for you son. Now what do you idjits want to eat?” “Sam?” “Whatever is good with me, although I could go for a salad?” “Dude. No. I was thinking burgers and some pie.” “Sounds like a plan, I’m going on a run, is there anything else you boys need?” “No sir” they both said. Dean reassumed his position on the couch and frowned, “What happened to Dr. Sexy?” “I changed it when you fell asleep. How many hours did you catch last night man?” “Probably two, I couldn’t sleep. Don’t worry about it. I’m all caught up now and I’m taking the remote.” “No you’re not, this documentary is fixing to come on that I wanted to watch.” “Come on man a documentary? Grow some balls.” Bobby smiled at them before slapping them on the head. “Ow! What was that for?” “Stop fighting over the remote like normal kids and watch something you both like. And no porn Dean.” His brother rolled his eyes and sighed “Fine, but what you don’t know what kill you.” “I mean it boy, save that for later. Sam’s too young to be watching that.” “No I’m not? We used to watch the-e” he was cut off by his brother’s hand. “You’re right. I’m too young.” After Bobby left he heard a sigh from Dean, “Man you can’t go spilling family secrets like that. Bobby is not Dad, he has morals and stuff. He cares about our brains being warped and what not.” “Sorry, I wasn’t thinking.” “It’s alright, this is going to take a bit for us to get used to.” Nodding he sat back and let Dean watch his doctor show.
Cas smiles and kisses Dean’s hair. “What about the semen?”
Deans POV
“Wow. You’re really going to make me say it aren’t you?”
“I was trying to carry you to your room, but I’m not as strong as I thought.”
They watch the rest of the movie in silence and awe. When Ennis finds out about Jack’s death, they both cry.
“Yes sir.”
“Here. Did you something out?”
“Yeah, it would have. Damn Moose” he says flipping through the web browser.
“You mean you stole it? Tsk tsk. Now I know why they say to never meet your heroes.” She says laughing at him.
Girl was a professional he had to admit, but he doubted she had the skills to get past their security system.
pick out. No chick flicks.”
He gathered his gear and put it away before heading into the kitchen to see Sam and Cas sitting at the table. Mugs in hand.
Suddenly the red dot on his GPS blinked and disappeared. His phone lit up with a text, “On my way back. Be home soon.”
“Tracking Dean?” she signed.
“It’s okay, and don’t be sorry honey. I know what most people think and it wasn’t anything tragic like that, I just lived in a small town at the time, with nothing better to do. I’m one of the lucky ones who caught it early on, I started drinking when I was only twelve. Luckily my mom caught on and had me in rehab when I was 15. That’s when she called Bobby, blamed the whole thing on him actually. Poor guy, he didn’t even know I existed.”
“Cas?”
Dean’s POV
“Okay, but only if you carry me there.”
“Or we could continue doing this?” the hunter said hopefully winding his arms around the angel to continue the kiss.
After they finish eating they climb into the impala and Dean chuckles, a mischievous smile on his face. “What is it Dean?”
“For one, only crazy people sleep on their back. Two, you don’t need that many pillows, I only grabbed em to be sure.”
“Nothing. Just glad to have everyone under one roof. No apocalypse, no big bad breathing down our necks. Just living the good life.”
“Hello?”
teasing. Sticking his lip out he sighed, and mumbled.
. I think it may be the effect of his missing grace or something. I don’t know, but whatever it is, I don’t like it.”
. Cas frowns at that. “What?” “Sam. I can read your mind. This was all a ruse to get Dean to admitting he likes men. And me...” “No-No I don’t know what you’re talking about. Also, it’s rude to read people’s mind.” Huffing, a very human emotion, Cas is still giving him a bitch face.
“Dean, I’m sorry. I thought that it was prudent to answer Sam’s call, he may have been in trouble.” Once again Cas apologized to his hunter but he waved it off with bitch face and shrug.
This night was different. Instead of dreaming about Cas being taken by the empty, he dreamed of him being burned alive. Just like their mother. Just like Jess.
“He will be when he gets home, he killed the mood and all chances of us not going slow. Now were back to square one.” Cas pouted, teasing was not fun when you were on the receiving end, except Dean
“He is pretty handsome, and so is Ennis, who resembles a certain bowlegged hunter I know.”
“So do you want to go somewhere else? I think there’s a TGI Friday’s somewhere in the next town. They have good burgers but, personally I’m more of a vegetarian myself sometimes. Depends on the mood.”
Cas's POV
He set up the bed and took off his second layers. Grabbing some pajama bottoms he quickly put them before Cas had turned around from snooping.
Take me instead. I’ll do anything.” The shadow disappears along with the little bit of breath Dean has left. “NO!”
After Cas had drifted back to sleep he moved to where he was able to see the ex angel in the backseat, when he saw that he was having a nightmare all he wanted to do was crawl in the back and comfort him, but that would be weird. So instead he nudged him awake and told him it was just a nightmare, he knew that Cas had been dreaming about letting his siblings down, and it hurt him to see Cas blame himself like that. All of it was Metadicks fault, not Cas's, he decided that when the angel woke up he would talk to him about it. Chick flick moment be damned. Satisfied with his decision he tried to close his eyes and rest, in stead he was met with a nightmare of his own. They were back at the church and Sam finished the trials, but the gates didn't close. The only product of that was that his brother was dead lying next to the king of hell who actually looked remorseful. "Squirrel, I'm sorry. I don't know if it's the human juice talking but, I never wanted one of the Winchesters to perish like that. Truly awful. Any chance you can let me go now?" Even more pissed of than he was before he wiped the tears from his eyes and punched the dick in the jaw. "Shut up and bring him back. Now." "I-I can't. I'm human, remember?" Shit. He picked up his brothers body and brought him to the Impala, looking up he saw the angels falling. Cas must have done this. "Cas!" Cas wherever you are, I need you. Sammy's gone, and I just. Please man. Suddenly there was bright flash coming towards him, falling about ten feet in front of him was a broken up angel. Upon closer inspection he saw a tan trench coat and dark hair, "Cas!" Leaving his brothers body behind he ran towards the figure, "Dean, I heard your prayer. Take me to Sam, and I'll do what I can." "You're dying Cas. You'll die if you heal him." "Please Dean, let me do this for you." "No. I can't let you." "Can't or won't?" "Both." Cas was up now and was limping towards his brothers body. "No!" In his stomach he felt a burning pit trying to swallow him, if he lost the angel it surely would. When he reached them it was too late, the angels fingers were already on his brothers head. After he removed his fingers the angel fell to the ground next to the younger Winchester and groaned, "Dean. I'm sorry. I-I love" then he was dead. "No! Dammit Cas, I said don't and what do you do? You do it anyways. Selfish bastard. Can't you see I'm lost without you? I never even got to tell you that I love you. Please come back. Please" he was interrupted by Sam waking up and turning over to spit up blood and spasm. He rushed over to him but he was gone now too. All alone he cried out. He lost his brother and his best friend all in one night. "I love you Cas. I loved you" he held Cas in his arms and sobbed into the trench coat. "Dean?" waking up to the sound of the angels voice he shook away the nightmare. "What?" "You were screaming my name, are you okay?" "Fine Cas, just a bad dream." Daylight was breaking through the trees and adjusted the seat before getting out to stretch. "Why were you screaming my name though?" He shook his head "it's nothing, you can go back to sleep, I'm sorry I woke you up." "Dean. Please tell me." How could he tell him about his dream without revealing his true feelings? What true feelings, Cas was a dude. A fucking angel to be more exact and he did not have feelings for the dude. A hand gripped his shoulder, "Dean, I know when you're lying. Just tell me." "I tell you what why don't you tell me what was making you shake so hard a couple of hours ago and I'll tell you why I yelled out your name. Deal?" "Deal. You go first." "Uh-uh you go first, since you want to know so badly." "It was about the angels falling. They were angry with me, and to be honest I'm angry with myself. I can understand why they would be too. I don't deserve to be alive when my brothers and sisters are out there suffering and I'm here with you talking nonchalantly about dreams as if something horrible hasn't just happened." Wow, he was not expecting that. It made his nightmare seem like a run of the mill underwear case. "Cas, it's not your fault. You have to know that. You thought you were doing the right thing, we all did. Metatron tricked you, that's all. Nothing more, nothing less." "I don't agree but fine. Now tell me why you looked distressed while calling out my name." He sighed, this was going to be hard, maybe he could get away with telling half of it. "Sam had died, and the angels were falling and I prayed to you like I did last time, and you fell right in front of me, you were dying too because of the fall but you insisted on saving Sam and I told you not to but you did anyways and you died. Sam started to cough up blood before dying too and I was all alone and I just. I couldn't accept that you were dead too. So I started to call for you but you just laid there not breathing and then you woke me up." Cas was frowning and looked deep in thought, "It's not untrue, I would have done my best to save Sam but we don't have to worry about that. We're all alive." Nodding he rubbed his face before sitting on the hood of the car, Cas joined him and touched his knee. "Dean, I'm sorry about the dream but was that all?" "Yeah. Sorry for waking you up-." He was interrupted by his phone ringing, "Hello?" "Dean, you've been gone since yesterday afternoon come on already, this motel smells, and we've stayed at some pretty shitty ones in the past but this one sucks. I want to sleep in my own bed." "We're on our way." "Sam?" "Yeah he was calling to check in." "How's he feeling?" "Fine, he just needs sleep and fluids for a couple of weeks, and so do you. You can't go out in the world acting like a toddler unknowing how to act. So when we get home I'm going to show you what to eat and stuff. K?" For the first time in a long time he seen the angels face crack with a small smile, "What?" "You said home, I assume the bunker is my home now too?" "Duh?" Nodding he took the pillow from the front seat and curled up in the front seat to sleep. Cranking the impala he headed to get his brother. Half way there Cas woke up with a start. "Dean. Something is wrong." "What?" "I have this weird feeling in my stomach and my uh sexual organs seem to be wanting attention. I don't understand what is wrong with me?." Looking at Cas he saw that his pants were bunched up and he could see that Cas had a boner. Blushing he looked away, "Uh Cas it's called an erection you get them when you're attracted to something. That must have been some dream huh? As far as the stomach goes, your hungry. We'll stop in a bit and get some grub." "I was dreaming about being in the bunker with you Dean, I don't understand what that has to do with my penis." Cas was dreaming about him when he got the erection, somehow it made him feel good inside and he started to think about how just how big Cas was down there. Feeling his own dick become to get slightly hard he gritted his teeth. Sam. Sam. Sam and Ruby. Sam.Sam. Sam. Whew it was gone. "Um you're just happy is all it's nothing. Best thing to do to get rid of it in a situation like this is think of something you wouldn't want to see." "Oh I get it like mass genocide?" "No not like mass genocide, like for example I think of Sam because that's my brother and well its weird to have a boner when your thinking about your brother." "Oh okay. So I too should think of Sam?" "Whatever works man." He was doing his best to keep his eyes fixed on the road so he wouldn't turn any more red than he already was. "It's not working." "That's because Sam's not your brother, think of Metadouche or something." "I hate him. That should work. Okay." "Just do it, this is awkward to talk about man." "I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable Dean." Still not looking he nodded and continued to think of unattractive things. Baseball. Hairy guys. Vegetables. Salad. Jogging. "I think it worked, you can look at me now Dean." "I was just um paying attention to the road man. You good now?" "Yes, thank you." That was a close call, he thought maybe he would have to show him the real way to get rid of a boner, he wished he could. Dammit man stop thinking about your best friend like that you sicko. What would your father say? Probably would've called me a queer. There was nothing wrong with loving somebody who had saved him countless number of times and always looked at him as if the sun revolved around him, but thankfully he didn't have that problem. Cas was his friend, his buddy, his pal. "Dean what are you thinking so intensely about?" "Uh nothing I was just thinking about the trials. We didn't finish them and now hell was going to be open forever." "Big deal, we'll deal with it. I mean with Kevin's demon bombs we can destroy them easily, don't fret my friend." He nodded and pulled into a burger joint and went through the drive through. "What do you want? A burger?" "I don't know, just get two or whatever you get." "I need two double cheese burgers, two fries, two apple pies, and two sodas." Pulling up he grabbed the bag with food and handed it to Cas before paying. Already the angel was digging through the bag and inspecting his food, "Stop looking at it and eat it." Taking the bag from him he unwrapped a burger and handed it to him, "Start with the burger, just bite it and chew it all before swallowing." "I'm not a baby Dean, I know how humans consume food." "Well it ain't done by staring at it. Eat." Putting the burger in his mouth he attempted to eat all of it at once. "Dude, one bite at a time. Watch." He took a bite of his burger and held it up and said "see?" with a mouth full of food. Cas nodded and took a smaller bite before letting out a groan of approval. "Man this is delicious. Oh." Great now he was going to have that sound in his mind, "Dude, just eat it." "Sorry." When they were done eating Dean stopped at a gas station to pee. "You're gonna have to use the bathroom soon, so go ahead and go while were stopped." Following behind him Cas touched his shoulder, "Wait, I don't know how what do I do? Just go?" "No you can't just go on yourself. That's gross." He really didn't want to show cas how to pee because that would involve him seeing his dick and he knew that would stir questions. He could see it now, "Dean why do you have an erection? Dean is this an often occurrence after peeing? Dean?" Snapping out of his thoughts he sighed "Okay Sam's gonna show you the real way when we get home but right now just undo your pants and sit down with your dick in the toilet. And pee?" He had never had to tell somebody how to pee before much less a fucking angel. "Okay." When heard it was going successfully he sighed in relief, thank god he didn't have go down that road. "Be careful not to zip your dick up when your pulling your pants up man because that shit hurts." "Thank you for the warning." "No problem, hurry up this is awkward enough." They left the gas station and he was anxious to get to Sam so there wouldn't be anymore awkward silences. Finally reaching the hotel he sighed in relief, knocking on Sam's door he waited. "Look who it is. How was the honeymoon?" Rolling his eyes he moved past his brother, "Come on, get your shit were going home." "Already packed. Lets go." "Can you drive? I need to catch some z's." "Yeah I've been asleep practically all day so it should be fine, why didn't you just ask Cas?" "I don't trust him driving my baby." "I see. Too much competition?" "What the hell is wrong with you man?" "Dean, almost dying does something to you. It makes you realize time is precious, and I don't want to waste it seeing you two pine over each other all the time, so if I have to mess with you until you finally do something then so be it." Dammit, what the hell was that supposed to mean? He got in the back and Cas frowned, "Your not driving?" "No, I need some sleep and the bunkers a good couple of hours away. Don't wake me up unless it's an emergency." They both agreed and soon enough he was asleep in the back dreaming about strippers. Except these weren't normal strippers, they were all wearing trenchcoats and had dark short hair. He realized upon closer inspection that it was Cas. Dammit, even in his dream he couldn't escape his feelings. He woke up in his bed and was shocked, "Sammy?!" Walking to the front room he yelled again, "Sammy? What the hell man?" "Don't look at me. Your boyfriend did it. He insisted you would be upset if you woke up and it 'wasn't an emergency' he takes everything so literal. But I didn't tell him no, this is more fun" he said with a smile. His face scrunched into a bitch face as he looked for the angel, "He's asleep on the couch man" Sam said. Walking towards the couch he frowned. He couldn't wake him up just to bitch at him, instead he sighed and sat down on the coffee table. "Dammit man. What the hell is going on with us?" he whispered as he put his head in his hands. Cas began to stir awake and he got up to leave but heard his name being called. "Dean." "Yeah?" "Are you upset that I moved you?" "Uh no man it's fine. Just weird is all." "Weird? Why? You moved me last night and I didn't find it 'weird' at all. Comforting actually." "Nothing, but when I meant only in an emergency I was kidding, you should have just told me we were at the bunker. Just don't next time okay?" Cas frowned and mumbled, "Okay. Sorry." "By the way there are several rooms in the bunker, you don't have to sleep on the couch." "I didn't know I could stay." "Of course your staying, why wouldn't you??" "I don't know. Just a thought." "Yeah well just pick one, Kevins the last one on the right, I'm the first door on the left and Sam is up stairs. So anyone except those are good." "Thanks, goodnight Dean." "Goodnight Cas."
Soon, the angel is shifting and his ass is directly on Dean’s crotch causing welcomed friction. Cas begins to stir above him unknowingly moving his ass against the hunter’s dick.
He had grown fond of the beard the angel had grown, it was weirdly soft and he liked waking up to the feeling of it on his chest. "Are you going to teach him how to shave or should I?" "Why must I shave? I see no problem with facial hair and justice?" They both chuckled, "It's nothing man it's just how the bureau does things, you'll see that soon, so do you want me or Dean to teach you?" The answer was obvious but Sam asked anyways, "If your lessons involve this, then it'd be mighty uncomfortable, I prefer it if Dean continues to teach me. Thank you for your kindness though." Sam nodded and headed back upstairs, "Don't fuck in here! This is a public room!!!" Dean didn't care about public rooms, Kevin was knocked out cold and Sam knew they were bound to mess around down here. "So did you have another lesson planned Mr. Winchester?" Dean smiled a lustful smile and moved towards the angel again, "Oh yeah you are totally calling me that from now on,
“Well Dave, thanks for the drinks.” Dave winks at Dean and slips him his number, it’s discreet and most people wouldn’t have caught it but Sam Winchester
“You can’t go in public wearing pajama pants.”
“Good, how’s your boner?”
Dean laughs but Cas is still crying, and is now trembling with the realization of Dean’s words.
“If you want, we can just wait. I’m not an expert on human relations but doesn’t talking about it ruin the moment?”
“Hmm. It’s good, but I especially like it with the maple syrup.”
“Dean? Are you still there?”
Castiel’s POV:
Dean thought he was gross. Disgusting even. He didn’t understand why? Never in his life had he been concerned about the opposite or the same sex in a romantic or physical way.
“Yes sir. I ate the rest of it.”
“It is not. It never has been. I wish so badly that it was, it would make this so much easier. I didn’t fall and rebel from heaven to be in control, you stupid son of a bitch. I did it to be with
“Why? You think I’m gross. Remember?”
Cas grumbles, “Fine.” Clearly,
about keeping him safe. ‘Look out for Sammy. Sammy. Sammy. Sammy’ but now
After explaining what happened with Cas to Sam and Jack, Dean didn’t mention him again. His thoughts never stopped focusing on the image he had of the angel. Black emptiness had enveloped him and taken him away. Forever.
He grinned. “Technically it’s 8, but Winchesters can run on 4, yes.”
“Who are they?”
Dean stopped the car sort of suddenly. Cas was thrown against the back of the front seat.
Sam’s POV
“What happened? Why do I feel human?” He knew what he really wanted to ask but he kept that in the back of his mind for now.
Sorry this chapter is so short! I'm just trying to figure out college and well you know how it goes. Hope you enjoy it! Thanks for reading it! ~
“Cas? Buddy, you okay?” Sam answers for him “he had a nightmare, I think you died in it. It shook him up pretty bad.” With that he leaves the angel alone with his brother. “I’m going back to bed, I got an early morning. Goodnight.” “Night Sammy.” Cas is sobbing into his chest “Dean I’m sorry I” “Shh. Shh. I’m here.” Much like Sam, Dean is rocking him back and forth. Unlike Sam, Dean is rubbing the angels back and stroking his hair at the same time to comfort him. “How about you sleep in my room tonight? Nothing weird or anything, just one friend helping out another friend, that way if you have another nightmare I’ll be there.” Still shaking the angel nods slightly. Dean takes the angel in his arms and picks him up one last time. He knows that the angel can move better now, but it’s easier. And if he’s being completely honest, he
Avoiding sitting by Castiel again he chose the seat by Bella instead. “Hello love, I was wondering when I would see you again.” He didn’t reply just sat there and watched as she gawked at him, “I was hoping to hear from you last night but no luck. No phone?” Shaking his head he just shrugged, “I was busy.” Bella scoffed and turned to her friends deciding to ignore him. Thank God. Castiel came in and looked at him before turning his head to the side. “Dean? You can sit back here by me, to use your words. I don’t bite.” Shocked he gathered his stuff before following him to the back. After he took his seat Castiel spoke up, “Dean. I’m sorry about being so rude to you before, you’ve been a true friend to me and you can call me whatever you like. I’ve just gotten so good at pushing people away that I don’t realize it when I do it anymore. I’d like it if we could be friends.” “Can I really call you Cas?” “Yes, in fact I like it. Oh I my sister packed this for me and I don’t eat pie normally do you want it?” Pie. How did he ever know he liked pie? “Thanks, I love pie.” “Friends?” “Friends.” At the end of class he decided he would get Cas to have lunch with him and his new friends. “Hey Cas, you should eat lunch with me.” “I don’t know, what about your new friends? They won’t like me, I’m not popular.” “Neither are we. Just a bunch of misfits!” Charlie said beaming at the two of them. “Charlie this is Cas, Cas this is Charlie.” He waved awkwardly at her before agreeing to go eat lunch with them. “Great it’s settled. See you guys then” she said before walking away a mischievous grin playing at her lips. “She’s seems cool.” “Yeah she’s a bit odd at first but I can already tell were going to be great friends.” They walked to their next classes together and agreed that Dean would wait for him outside after class. “Oh hey by the way I seen Sam, he was walking with a very pretty girl.” “Yeah that’s my boy, was she blonde?” “Uh huh. They were holding hands.” He smiled, “her name’s Jessica, I met her yesterday, she seems nice enough. Way out of Sammy’s league though.” “Dean, you realize she’s 14.” “So? I’m 17. Relax. I’m not that much of a perv.” “Sure” Cas said poking at Dean’s side. They laughed before parting ways. Not wanting to go to civics he groaned counting down the minutes until lunch. When the bell rang he rushed out of class to meet his new friend. They walked to the quad together and Cas laughed for an unknown reason. “What?” He then pursued to do his best Dean impersonation in a high gravelly voice he said “Hey do you uh know where the quad is? I’m new and I get really mad when people don’t pay attention to me.” Pretending to be mad he frowned, “I don’t sound like that and I actually hate all the attention.” “I know it was cute though, don’t worry about it.” Playfully he slugged his arm before sliding it around the shorter boy’s shoulder.
, Castiel. There is a difference. Abaddon created them to mindlessly follow her and after her death I had them all slaughtered, it seems I missed the most important one though, the leader, until today. It brought me you, thinking to redeem itself and once again be known in Hell, but I had him killed immediately and you brought here. To my chambers.”
And in the very back of his mind, he hoped that they would come to rescue him. That Dean would come for him.
“Cas, I know, you’d never leave Dean. How do I know? Because every time you two are around each other you stare at each other like all the answers to everyone’s problem lay inside Dean’s eyeballs. Which hell maybe they do, but that’s not the point. You love him, go tell him. I know he feels the same way.” “I was going to say sorry for leaving earlier but you’re right in your assumptions, I do love your brother deeply. I’ve never felt this way before about anybody and I don’t know how to act upon it. And Dean doesn’t love me, how could he after all I’ve done to him?” Sam shakes his head “Dude, how could he not love you? You literally saved his ass more than anybody else, and have never asked for anything in return, I mean you’ve turned down being fucking God practically just a minute ago just to stay on earth with him. If that’s not love, then man, have I been defining it wrong for a long ass time? Love is sacrifice, and you’ve sacrificed more for him than anybody has in the history of the world. And another thing, how many times have you died? How many times has he died? Ever thought that maybe there was a reason you two kept getting brought back? It’s because God wants you two to be together, its destiny. Fate. Whatever you want to call it. Just fucking do it already, so the rest of the world can get on with our lives. I’m tired of all the sexual tension you two have, I mean seriously you can almost touch it. So go tell him.” Cas looks uncomfortable
Cas's pov:
>3< ;]
I uh, I’m a recovering alcoholic. 10 years sober.”
Finally they get to the part where Dean and Crowley were traveling the country together going bar to bar to keep the mark at bay. “Sounds like a good friend, demon or not.”
“No, it’s not what you’re thinking. I just- I took your grace. It was the only way to get you out of there... “
Realizing there was no danger unloaded it and re did the safety. After putting it back in it’s usual spot, he laid down.
“Cas-I. I’m just. I’m sorry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was much better than my time with April.”
Sam must have turned it on because while he liked the band he never listened to it with other people around. It reminded him of his early childhood too much.
Sam walked into the living room and flipped on the TV, an old movie was playing but it was an hour in. He decided to grab some beers out of the fridge and eat some more pizza, he’d run it off in the morning during his morning jog. As he flipped through the channels he landed on an old 80’s movie that was just starting. “You say potato, I say pot-tato,” huh When Harry met Sally was playing and he’d never seen it before. It looked good enough to stare at for a few hours to distract him. It looked like a romantic comedy but he didn’t much care, Dean was too busy to tease him right now anyways. Meg Ryan was in it and he had always liked her in other films he’d seen. These two are totally going to end up together. It’s classic, if not predictable. Oh wait, he’s dating her friend, but I’m sure that won’t stop them; besides there both going to be in NYC. Wait, why are they going separate ways? Jesus this movie was going all over the place. They didn’t even part as friends. That movie they were talking about sounded familiar, Casablanca. He was sure he had at least seen it once. Dammit he was never going to figure out where he had seen it, if he had even seen it. Dad. John Winchester used to hum the tune from the movie all the time, he said he loved it as a kid. Huh, and yet him and Dean had never watched it. Oh well, wait is that Leia? It’s totally Princess Leia from Star Wars. Man had she gotten old, still hot though. Finally they were meeting again, perfect timing too they had both just been dumped. Well sort of. Yes, wait what? Friends? Alright, so it was like Dean and Cas’s story. Ugh. He was happy for them, he was, but he was also extremely jealous. It had been awhile since he had somebody to hold in his arms and make him feel like he belonged again. So they’re going on a date with each other’s best friends, maybe it’ll work out. When it didn’t he wasn’t surprised just exhausted, when would these two finally admit their feelings for each other? Jesus Christ this was just like his brother and the damn angel. Why couldn’t he get an angel of his own?? Course they had all fallen now, and there was no way he would ever trust one besides Castiel anyways. Snap, they just had a fight, but they fixed it just as soon as it happened. Must be nice. Suddenly Harry was comforting Sally, oho so this is how they would end up together. This would not end well. “It had to be you. It had to be you, I wandered around, and finally found, and somebody who- could make me be true…It had to be youu.”  As Frank Sinatra’s melody played through the TV, Sam sighed, great now he would never get this damn song out of his head. Harry and Sally had to be together, he was sure that Harry would make some long romantic speech about Sally. Sure enough there he was saying, “I love that you get cold when it’s 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you’re looking at me like I’m nuts. I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it’s not because I’m lonely, and it’s not because it’s New Year’s Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.”  Damn that was the cheesiest and sweetest thing he had seen, he was turning into a sap. “It had to be you” he hummed as he got up to go towards his room. “Sam? Why are you still awake?” Cas said before looking at the younger Winchester. “Hey, I uh couldn’t sleep so I was watching some TV. Dean still asleep?” The angel nodded and looked at him with sorrow, “Sam, thank you for being so kind. My brothers were never so supportive. Except Gabriel and well he has a habit of fake dying on me.” Gabriel. Stupid bastard. He’d hated him ever since he gave him a million Tuesdays that were unbearable. He knew now that he was trying to teach him a lesson, but this teaching method needed some serious adjustment. “Goodnight Cas, I’m going to go running in the morning, will you make sure Dean doesn’t flip his shit? I just need some alone time every now and then.” The angel nodded and laughed before saying “Sam, there is somebody out there for you as well, you deserve to be happy.” He only chuckled and smiled at the fallen angel. “Thanks buddy.”
Soon Dean is walking with Cas straddling him towards the wall, pressing the angel up against it knowingly. Whispering in his ear “how about now?” before he begins kissing the angels neck. Cas groans and runs his hands down Deans back, clenching at the fabric. Dean begins to lick and nip his way back up to the angel’s ear. “Or now?” Soon Cas is panting, begging Dean to do something.
Dean blushes and squints. “I’m still playing catch up on how you’re out of the pit. Why would Crowley just give away your soul?”
It had been three weeks since Dean had heard anything from his father, and he hadn’t returned any of his many phone calls. Feeling stuck and unsettled he looked over the info he was left on the notepad about the case his dad was last working. There had been five deaths in the last two months in Bastrop down in Louisiana, all said to have their throats ripped out. Immediately his dad knew it was a vampire and packed his stuff, problem is there were a lot of nests in the south, and going alone was more than dangerous. Dialing Bobby’s number he feared the worst, his father was probably dead. “This is Bobby Singer, if you have this number and it’s not an emergency then you better hang up now.” Rolling his eyes he sighed some things never changed. “Bobby, its Dean. I think Dad’s in trouble. He’s been on a vamp hunt for more than three weeks and we haven’t heard from him since he left. I hate to bother you but have you talked to him?” Hearing the other man sigh on the other end he dropped his head, “No, I’ve been working a case in Ohio and I just got back in, but I’ll give his cell a ring and see if he’s alright. Hell he may be drunk in a ditch somewhere. I’ll call you back.” “Alright, thanks Bobby.” “That’s what I’m here for.” After hanging up the phone he decided to clean up the room. When Dad was on a case, and they weren’t given one to work themselves they relaxed and watched TV not worrying about the mess. Most people would have let the maids come in, but they knew better than that. How could you explain a 16 year old having an array of weapons strewn everywhere and a 12 year old reading a lore book? You can’t, so they kept to themselves, only going out when they absolutely needed to. It was early and Sam was still asleep so he cleaned as quietly as he could. Afterwards he looked for something to eat, there was hardly anything left on the small table besides a granola bar. Deciding to save that for Sammy, he dug his wallet out to look at their funds. Inside was a five and a couple of dollar bills. He knew they shouldn’t have ordered pizza last week but he couldn’t say no to Sam’s puppy eyes. It was ten dollars for one pizza and it lasted them the whole day, so all in all it wasn’t that bad of a buy. A knock at the door drew him out of his trance and he pulled his gun out of the back of his pants. Looking at Sam to make sure he was still asleep upon realizing he was, he turned to open the door. Gun ready he opened it a crack before seeing a short lady, “What do you want?” he said discreetly hiding the gun behind the door. “Boy put that gun away. And don’t be too loud about it, I don’t want you waking up Sam over there.” Hiding it in his jacket he opened the door before pushing her outside, “Who the hell are you?” “Dean watch your mouth. I’m a friend of your fathers, name’s Missouri Mosely.” “How do I know you’re telling the truth?” “Why would I lie to you? John Winchester came to me a long time ago and asked me for a favor so here I am.” He didn’t reply instead he prepared himself for a fight. “So what’s the favor?” “I’m here to deliver this.” She held out a pair of keys, upon realizing they were the keys to the impala he snatched them away. “Don’t snatch boy it’s rude. Now I’m sorry to be bringing such bad news, but you’re going to be a good man and I know you’re strong so you look after yourself and Sam in there and don’t be afraid to call me every now and then.” Walking towards the Impala he looked inside and found his dad’s jacket with a note on top.
“Wait. Wait. He
Cas, however has other plans in mind. If Dean wanted to play games, then so did he. “Dean wait.” He turns around, quirking an eyebrow up at his angel. Cas nearly tackles the hunter and lays them down on the hallway floor so that he is sitting on Dean’s stomach. “Cas? As much as I like this position, you’re not exactly light mmf” his sentence is interrupted by Cas grabbing his face and kissing him fiercely.
Taken aback he blinks a few times, that is not what he expected his brother to say. “In denial about what?” “Nothing-just uh don’t hurt Cas, okay?” And with that the younger Winchester is disappearing down the hall. Sammy was right, he needed to stop playing games, he’d been a little upset at the lack of memory the angel had to his confession of love. At the time he was ‘relieved’ but that was only his father talking in the back of his head.
“Most people say thank you, but I expect those kind of grade f manners from you angel lot. I’ll have you brought home soon, tell Dean his bestie says hello.”
After everyone has gone to the restroom they settle back into the Impala on to their next destination. He awaits the inevitable question, he knows his youngest will ask.
Everything was into place now. Sam looked up and smiled at him.
“I had to. It was the only way to get you out.”
*Three months later*
Dean is unresponsive in the doorway, unfamiliar with what to say. His best friend loved him.
Dean stared at him with a weird intensity. His eyes were narrowed and brows furrowed as though he was concentrating hard on what to say.
“I’m going to assume she did all the work, and that’s fine. You didn’t know anything then, but I’ve gotta tell you, whatever you’ve been doing to study the subject keep doing it. It’s definitely helped.”
“Relax, I’m only kidding, do you think I could afford a car like this? No way, I hijacked it from a prep school kid.”
“Cas. Get in bed. You said you were tired.”
“What about your cute friend here, what will it be honey?”
Deciding to use that to his advantage he removes his own boxers and slides their cocks together to create friction. Now he is panting as well, and Cas’s mouth on his neck does not help him contain himself.
Still pouting he shrugged “I don’t know you took it away before I could see, but do you really think that I would be on porn sites now that were together?”
“Dean?”
“It’s a good movie. Besides I think Jack is fixing to tell Ennis to fuck off. About time too, poor Jack.”
“Oh. Okay.” Cas frowned, he didn’t particularly like violent movies and he figured as much that it was due to the title. The movie was sure to include violence, cowboys, sexual encounters, and bloodshed,
Silently he waited in the brightly lit hallway for a flutter of wings, but nothing happened. He had royally screwed things up this time for sure.
“K. Talk to you later.”
Two more knocks. Huffing he gets up and opens the door. “I said go away Dean.”
that the angel had his throat slit before.
“I can give you a hand if you like, all it takes to kill one is the blood of a dead man, it works just like an axe to the head.”
” Why would the King of Hell save him?
“I don’t know for sure. I’ve never had cake. Or pie.”
“Dean” he said in his normal tone.
Chapter Eight: Promises and BBQ’s.
He nods with tears in his eyes “I know, I’m so proud of you boys. You’ve literally been to hell and back, my boy. The righteous man, and now look at you! Shacked up with an angel of the lord. I guess the rumors were true. Aren’t you going to introduce me?”
Babe, he’d never been called that but he liked it.
He pulled some clothes out and handed them to him. “Here. Wear these.”
he could do. Cas had done so many things for him and his brother, which half the time they forgot to say thank you. “You’re right, hey Cas? Thanks for saving our asses again man. Sorry we keep getting you killed and what not. Kind of the Winchester curse.” The angel in his arms rolls his eyes, a very human trait he must have picked up from the boys. “I was kidding, but you’re welcome. I’d do anything to keep you safe.” Noticing Dean’s discomfort at the words he add “You and Sam. Like you said we’re family.” A flicker of pain flashes across Dean’s face but Cas doesn’t catch it because soon he is falling asleep
He stewed on this as he sat on the cold hard floor cutting the phone back on… Sam and Jack would be worried about them, but how was he supposed to explain that Cas had made the ultimate sacrifice?
“Dude. Did you ever think that maybe
“Why am I the idiot?!”
His phone’s ringtone woke him from his light sleep, “Hello?” he barely whispered. “Dean.” Cas. It was so good to hear the other man’s voice he smiled… “Bye” he didn’t hear an answer in reply just the dial tone. “Where are we?” Sam was awake now, “We’re in a hospital. You passed out and I didn’t know if you were gonna make it. You’ll be fine, you just have to take it easy for a couple of weeks.” “The last thing I remember the angels were falling. And you were screaming for Cas.” “Yeah I uh I thought you were going to die. So um yeah.” “Did he get hurt in the fall too?” “He’s human, I talked to him just before you woke up, he’s somewhere in Ohio. I told him to sit tight and wait for me to come get him.” “You’re going to Ohio?” “Yeah. He’s human man. He doesn’t know how to take care of himself.” Sam smirked but said nothing. “I’ll drop you off at the bunker then turn around.” “I can come Dean.” “No, you need to rest in a bed. Not in my baby.” He rolled his eyes, “You’re not going to give up on that will you?” “Nope. And until you’re better we’re taking a siesta, I think we deserve it.” “Seriously?” “Yeah. Why not? Besides were going to have our hands full with Cas being a human and all.” “By us you mean you.” “No I mean whatever. I’m going to get your discharge papers.” Walking out of the room he went to find the nurse, when he returned Sam was up and had removed his IV. “Sir you should really let me do that” he said in a girly high pitched voice. “Thank you kind nurse, but my brother has to go save his boyfriend.” “Okay jokes over. Ha. Ha.” Mumbling under his breath he said “and he’s not my boyfriend.” “That’s because you haven’t told him yet.” “What?” “Nothing. Let’s go. I’m starving.” “No. What did you say?” “Dean. Everyone with eyes can see how you feel about him. Get over it. Now come on.” “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Sam rolled his eyes and led the way out of the room. They discreetly walked out the front door as if his brother hadn’t been admitted there the night before and was walking away from the insurance questions they were bound to ask. He sighed when they finally made it to the Impala, maybe his luck was turning around.
“No. We can just try it out. Come on, let me get ya a pillow.”
Hands are grasping the sheets, and Dean begins to rub Cas through his boxers momentarily before grabbing Cas’s face as he seals their lips together once more. A groan escapes the angel’s mouth and the hunter smiles against the kiss before opening his mouth to tug playfully on the angel’s bottom lip. When he lets go he feels a tongue press its way into his mouth.
Then in the middle of the ditch, he is pressing his lips against the angels. Their soft, just like he expected, his hand caresses his angel's face before pulling away to stare at him again.
All I want is you.
“Cas you awake?” He nodded into Dean’s back “yeah barely.” It was 6 in the morning and neither of them wanted to be up that early if they didn’t need to be. Dean however had woken up with something poking in his back and decided it was time to tell Cas about morning wood. “You have a boner, it woke me up.” Cas was so embarrassed he had no idea, “My apologies.” “Don’t worry about it, I’m going to show you what fixes morning wood” he said as he took off their clothes. He smiled maybe Dean would give him another ‘blowjob’ as he called it earlier. “You going to teach me?” Dean rolled over so he was straddling the angel, “I’m going to do more than that.” He could feel Dean’s hard dick pressing up against his own and he groaned at the friction it was causing. Pressing his lips against the angels he started to grind on him, and wiggling his hips he smiled an evil smile. “You shouldn’t tease me Cas, for future reference. I know what you we’re doing, and it wasn’t nice. Sammy was in the room next to us!” Cas began to laugh “I just wanted to speed things up, I’m sorry I won’t do it-t again. Please just move, touch me, do something.” Shrugging his shoulders Dean began to suck on the angel’s neck as he grinded on him harder than before. ”De-an” he yelled out. “Shh baby, don’t want people to hear now do we?” Fuck he didn’t care if the whole world heard him scream out Dean’s name, this felt better than anything he’d ever experienced. Feeling his skin on the freckled skin of the hunter was more than enough to send him over the edge. Scratching down his back as he was given mark after mark on his neck he raised his hips and began to roll them up to meet Dean’s. Hands left his dark hair and trailed towards his stomach before rubbing him through his boxers. “Fuck Dean.” Dean stopped sucking on his neck and moaned “Damn babe you keep talking like that and I’ll do whatever you want me to.” “Fuck me. Fuck me Dean. Please.” Defiantly he bit down on the scruffy jaw of his angel and smiled, “Careful what you wish for.” Removing the angels boxers he began to stroke his dick, before taking out his own and pushing the two together. He rubbed both of them simultaneously and it was driving Cas crazy to feel Dean’s dick on his. Never had he known that he was so big. The penis had to be at least 9 inches, and decided he wanted to taste it. Rolling Dean over him, he sat in his lap and licked his way down to the throbbing dick. When he looked up Dean had gone silent and was shocked with lust blown eyes, “Cas where the hell did that come fro-“ he didn’t finish his sentence because Cas put as much of the dick in his mouth that he could fit. What he couldn’t fit he stroked with his hand while bobbing his head and scraping his teeth at the sensitive skin. The hunter began to pant above him and his stomach was moving fastly up and down. Relaxing his throat he took more of him in and swallowed while moving his tongue as much as he could without gagging. Hands were working in his hair and made their way to his dick and began to stroke his dick, he was close to cumming and so was Dean based on the panting and moaning he was doing beneath him. Taking his mouth off slowly he licked the tip that was beading out precum, “You still want to take things slow?” Dean couldn’t compose a reply, just a muffled plea and so he began to lick his entire length before sucking on one of the hunters balls. “C-ca-cas!” “Cum for me Dean.” The hunter’s grip on his hair got tighter and he moved his mouth back up so he could take the load he was about to be given. Semen had a very weird taste, but he didn’t mind it. His own dick was fixing to explode from all the action Dean’s hand was giving it but he wanted more. Moving to straddle the hunter again he bucked his hips against the now limp dick before gaining a good rhythm. Dean grabbed his hips and pushed him forward until his dick was in his mouth. His hips fell back to the rhythm and he fucked his boyfriends face as he clung to his hair. Soon he had cum all in his mouth and some had even spilled down his face so he backed out of Dean’s mouth and fell beside him. “Where the fuck did that come from? How did you know how to give a good blow job?” “I just learned from watching you Dean. You’re a very good teacher.” “Hmm. Well that’s not the only thing I’m going to teach you.” He could only imagine what he had in store for them but he didn’t want to find out right now. Curling up next to his hunter again he licked the remaining cum on his neck and face before kissing him. “Is that how you get rid of morning wood Dean?” “One of the ways, yes.” Sighing happily he fell asleep quickly next to his hunter.
Checking into the Royale Inn, Sam squints. “Haven’t we stayed here before?” Dean shrugs before handing the clerk his fake credit card. “Probably who knows, I know we’ve worked a case here before.” Heading to their room, Sam remembers all too clearly. Waking up to find Dean gone, and finding that Dean that gone out with somebody named Dave/Davie. Not that it was any of his business, but it stung that he still hadn’t told him about it. There were multiple times when he found himself asking if his brother was straight, even more so since he had been rescued from hell by a certain good looking
Cas was still snoring heavily beside him, unaware of the chaos that almost occurred. It was funny that he was such a heavy sleeper when Dean was such a light one.
She had moved into the bunker not very long after they had saved the world from ultimate doom. Again. Sam started running every morning with her and she wore his robe from time to time. It all seemed very domestic.
“Yes.”
He says pulling away from his son and wraps the angel up in embrace similar to the one Sam gives. “Thank you for taking care of my boys, welcome to the family.”
Sam knocked on the window pulling him out of his trance and waking Cas up with a jolt.
Opening his mouth to protest at the angel’s sarcasm he stops short, he was right. It was the
Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these broken wings and learn to fly, all your life… You were only waiting on this moment to arise.
He’d never tell Dean that he picked the movie,
“It was. Thank you Dean.”
*Notes* Short add on, sorry it’s not any longer than it is, but college has been so crazy! Thanks for all the views and kudos! I’ll be here in the trash can attempting to do my trig work. Tis all you beauties! 0v0
Holding Gabe in his arms he felt at home, and now Dean and Cas were going to have babies. This was the life he always wanted, of course he never would have guessed it would be in this manner. However, he knew that Gabe was his soulmate, all of his sass and wit was what drew him to Sally in the first place, but after he revealed that it was Gabe, he knew immediately. He knew that they belonged together, nuzzling his neck into Gabe’s he smiled.
Minutes of wiggling and huffing, he finally settled into a position. Turns out he snored, very loudly at that, but it didn’t bother him.
“Let’s go to bed.”
see those gorgeous blue eyes again? You’re the only person who can make me believe in myself. To give me hope, and love. That’s what you’ve given me since you chose me over your siblings. And then you made a deal with the devil. I was so upset but I knew,
The impala was cruising on a dark road. Dean looked at him in the rearview mirror. “Cas?”
, the most handsome man ever.” Cas blushes and unpauses the movie.
much more, but I’m beat.”
“Yeah, I uh didn’t meet him until I was 15, by then it was too late. My mom thought he was crazy but I’ve been able to talk to ghosts since I was three, so I don’t know I’ve always been intrigued by the father who she said was obsessed with ghosts and demons.”
~NOTE: This is my view of what I want to happen after the Mark of Cain has been removed, but I’m annulling the “darkness” that has been unleashed because we don’t really know much about it. This is just a destiel fanfiction of Dean and Cas becoming a family, oh and a of course I’m not going to leave Sam to hang and dry. He will also have a love interest, mainly because I’m tired of the writers not giving him anything, I mean he doesn’t even have a dog? Seriously. Sorry rant over. Enjoy the feels. 
“Okay. Hey? What was that thing anyways?” “Dunno, never could get a name for it, whatever it was, it’s long gone, I think it took Cas’s grace and when it did it exploded or something. There was a huge flash a couple miles back, I seen it through the window by the door.” Nodding Dean carefully lays down the fallen angel carefully. “Huh. Well anything that can bang up an angel that good isn’t something I want to mess with anyways, so good riddance.”
“To bed. Don’t humans need at least 4 hours of sleep?”
But somehow the end of the world put things back into perspective. They had faced this type of battle many times over before. It wasn’t uncommon for one of them or all of them to face a blow that was fatal. Yet, they were always brought back together. Always.
“I’m just freaked out, is all.”
“Young Guns. It’s great, it’s a western about a group of guys”
And there it was. “Sam. You know the answer to that. We stay as long as we need to. We leave when we finish the job that’s that.”
“I love you.” He wanted to say something back to him but he didn’t get the chance because Dean kept going.
“Dean right?” “Yeah, you remembered.” The bartender only smirked, “Hard not to with a face like that, so listen, I was going through a phase back then, you know College and what not, but I’m married now. I have kids. And not to be rude but we don’t really like ‘your’ kind in our town. Okay? So I think it’s best if you leave.” Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing, not only had he been rejected but
“Well then I should get some rest. Goodnight.”
saved you?”
“Nothing! I’m fine by the way thanks for asking.”
and saw it hunched over Castiel’s limp body. “You’re right, it’s my bad. I should’ve paid more attention.” “It’s
Cas kisses his hair lightly, combing his fingers through it before pulling back to look at Dean. “Boyfriend. I like that. Dean is my boyfriend.” Smiling at the word he rubs circles on the freckled cheek, and Dean leans into his touch closing his eyes.
“There wasn’t a lot left… It kind of just floated away.”
I mean don’t get me wrong I get the whole carrying him around and stuff but seriously? How in denial
Placing him down on the loveseat, not so carefully this time he goes back for their food. “Pick something to watch. The remote’s right there.” Castiel scrolls through the selections and finally settles on something called “The Notebook.” Another movie is going off and Dean makes it just in time for the opening credits to pop up. He sets down the food on the coffee table and sits next to the angel. “What’d ya pick?” he says handing him his plate and drink. “Something called The Notebook.”
” Finally he wraps his arms around the angel and Cas snuggles in closer.
“Stay? You keeping saying Stay with me, Stay with me. Why? So I can watch you fall in love with a woman? Have children? I can’t do that. I have to go. Because all I want is you. All of you. Your stupid jokes, and western movies, and unhealthy food. Your weird human traditions. I want to wake up in your bed, to eat your cooking, to see you every minute of every single day until I die. But that’s not what this is about it’s about you. What do you want Dean?”
“Take out?”
“No. Stop.”
Cas looked him over and tilted his head.
“You’ve done enough for me and Sam to last a million lifetimes, I’m going to get some breakfast do you want to come?” The angel is still sleepy and there are hints of bags under his eyes but he nods anyways. “Let’s go.”
"I love you."

Standing at his door is not Dean, but instead is the
“Did you not notice I was gone?”
“Goodnight Cas.”
“Nor do I, silly angel, it’s far too weak to help me return to myself. Here, call it a parting gift. Now WAKE UP.”
“Hmm. Nope. I’m intrigued by this ‘gay’ cowboy movie. I bet you’ll like it, it does have cowboys after all.”
“You-you what?!”
“My time with April was not the best part of being human at all Dean. I actually didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would, I was constantly questioning if I was doing the right thing. It was too awkward.”
, it’s about you not being able to be in control anymore. You
“Alright.”
Embarrassed that he didn’t tell Dean sooner, he looks down. “About that. Dean. I”
I’ve never loved anybody or anything like I love you. It’s why I’ve done everything I have, it was selfish really, it was for my own personal benefit. Saving Sam was for you but also selfish, I knew that if you lost him you’d do whatever you had to do to bring him back. And that means I could have lost you, but over time I grew to love Sam too, although more of a brotherly love. Like how I love Gabriel. I love you, so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Even if it’s not romantically, just being with you is enough. To know you’re safe and alive is all I ever wanted. I know this must be a surprise to you so I’ll get Sam to help me to my room.”
“Let’s go to bed.” Dean got up and brought his angel with him. In one swift motion he was picking Cas up and with a sly grin.
Cas squinted and turned his head, “Don’t you understand? I’m not popular and you so very clearly are. Good bye Dean” he said before walking away. There was something about this guy he couldn’t let go. “Wait” he said trying to catch up but was stopped by a tall guy with ugly features. “Winchester. Don’t bother with that loser Novak. Come on hang out with us. I’m Ralph.” The guy was so obviously popular he decided against it. “No thanks.” “Did you say no?” “I didn’t stutter did I?” The big guy huffed, “You’ll regret it Winchester. Have fun hanging out with a fag.” “Rather hang out with him than a brainless douchebag jock.” “What did you say to me Winchester?” “You must have hearing problems, if I were you I’d get that checked out man.” “Alright that’s it.” Dodging a punch he kicked the dude’s leg out from underneath him, before grabbing his collar, “Nice try. Stay away from me.” After he let go of him the guy ran off. This was going to be a great school year he could already tell. Walking outside he found Benny waving for him to join them at a table. He nodded and gave them a one moment signal. Looking for Sam’s mop of hair in the crowd he finally spotted him talking to a blonde girl. “Sammy.” “Dean it’s Sam. Jessica this is my older brother Dean.” She smiled “Nice to meet you.” “You too. You going to stay here?” Sam nodded and smiled at Jessica, “Alright later, I’ll meet you by the impala.” He made his way back to Benny’s table and sat down. They all greeted him with a warm hey. Charlie was there as promised with a blonde girl sitting beside her and a dude with a mullet next to Benny. “Glad you could make it man, this is Jo” he said pointing to the blonde “and this is Ash” referring to the dude with the mullet. “Hey, I’m Dean.” Charlie patted the seat next to her and he sat down beside her. “So have they tried to recruit you yet?” “Uh yeah some dude named Ralph told me to hang out with him. He seemed like a total dick though.” Jo nodded “Yeah if by dick you mean homophobic asshole then yeah.” “Homophobic? Why do you say that?” “When Charlie and I started dating he harassed us for months and called us the wild things. And he is always messing with that Novak kid even though nobody even knows for sure if he’s gay.” “Wait you mean Cas?” “Yeah Castiel, that’s him. He’s a cool cat but he’s real quiet” Ash said. “Why does he mess with him then?” “Rumor is their related somehow, but still. I feel bad for that poor kid” He nodded, “What’s his story? He seemed nice.” “I knew it! I called it. Benny you owe me 10 bucks.” Benny handed over ten dollars and groaned. “Knew what?” “Oh nothing that you were one of us” Charlie said smiling at him. There was more to the story he was sure of it but at the moment he let it go. “So how long have you two been dating?” “Little over a year.” Jo said grabbing the red head’s hand. “That’s nice. So what’s the deal here? Any bad teachers I should know about?” “There aren’t any bad teachers per se but like I said earlier stay away from the football coach. Dude’s worse than Ralph.” He nodded “Got it. Anything else?” Charlie shook her head, “This school is full of hot chicks, if you’re into that kind of thing.” Blushing he nodded “Come on Char, leave the guy alone. Why you always gotta know if people are gay? Some people are straight you know.” “You’re right Ash, sorry Dean.” “Don’t be. I’m not.” “Not straight?” “No, I’m bisexual.” Feeling relieved he was so comfortable around them he shrugged as if to say what? “I knew it. Welcome to the club. Benny here’s the only straight one so to speak. Ash is ace.” “Um cool? I didn’t realize there was a club though.” “There’s not but that would be cool. I would join even if I am straight.” They all laughed and Charlie nudged him “So you got a hard on for the Novak kid or what?” “Um no? He’s probably straight he just kind of rejected me when I tried to talk to him” “Yeah he’s a little shy but for good reason. He gets beat up a lot.” He frowned he wasn’t going to let anybody hurt him again. “Not anymore, I’m going to help him.” “Good for you, go get your man.” “Oh please not everything is about that. Besides he hates me.” “How could anyone hate you? You’re a total babe.” “Thanks Charlie but you barely know me.” She patted him on the shoulder, “I know enough to know you’re a good guy.” “Thanks?” Smiling she nudged him “You’re welcome.” When the bell signaling lunch was over they all left. He decided that he liked these people and that the school wasn’t half bad, but he still couldn’t get Cas out of his mind. Deciding not to worry about it anymore he focused on his school work for once.
, but had also
Now his suspicions were confirmed, Dean would
” is spoken against his lips as he strokes Cas’s huge dick. Creating a rhythm of kissing, tugging and grinding on one another, soon Dean is also hard.
“Today you are going to learn about the best parts of being human. Number one is sex, but you already know that… Anyways number two is food. Number three is awesome movies which you know as well. Although The Notebook is not the best movie ever. I’ll show you the best movie ever.”
“You’re a mean tease” he says as the angel wraps his arms around the hunter. Kissing his light hair, Cas chuckles “We’ll see about that.”
“It’s not a bad thing man, it’s just I don’t know. Gross. But we can watch it if you really want to, I think it show’s Anne Hathaway’s tits in here somewhere.”
Nails are scratching down his back, digging into skin as he pumps his hand up and down their dicks one last time. A deep and gravelly voice that’s almost a whisper yells out “Dean!” as they cum onto the angel’s stomach. He pulls on his boxers before giving his angel his and lays down next to his angel, laying his head on his chest.
“Yeah I know, but now you’re about a medium or a large at best. So see if they have another one-ah here.” He says holding up the exact same sweater, this time in the angel’s size.
? A mere
“It’s been years but they always had good clothes. Good sturdy clothes that last forever.” They walk around for a bit until Dean finds the men section, immediately walking towards the plaid. Cas however does not follow suit and instead walks towards the sweaters with prints. When the hunter turns around to find the angel gone he panics but then he sees the angel’s dark hair in the
“Keep it. I don’t want it.”
“Dick shot him in the head.”
“Say what?”
Dean sat the bags down, unloaded the groceries, and put away the milk and orange juice. Cas grabbed the eggs and other items out of the fridge, “What do we do first?” he asked and Dean took out a bowl. “You crack the eggs first, but you have to be careful to not get any of the shell in there unless you want the omelet to be crunchy.” The angel laughed at the joke and followed his instruction, cracking the egg perfectly; as he did this Dean chopped up Sammy’s vegetables and set them aside. He turned around and turned the stove top on and pulled out a frying pan from above, he was handed the eggs and he quickly made the perfect cheese and bacon omelet for himself. Later he called to his brother, and made his veggie omelet for him. The younger Winchester looked amused at the sight of the two cooking in the kitchen. “Don’t you two look like an old married couple” Sam said as he smiled setting his plate down and pouring himself some orange juice. “We’re not married, bitch.” Dean said as he sat down and put some distance between him and the angel. “Jerk” Sam said laughing at how quickly and easily embarrassed his brother was. “Hey Cas, did I tell you about that Musical that Dean and I saw on a case?? It was about those Supernatural books that Chuck wrote. And -.” Before Sam could say anything else Dean covered the moose’s mouth with his hand. “I swear I will kill you, your children, and your grandchildren if you say one more word.” He muffled into his hand and pulled the hand away. “Dean, Sam, what are you talking about?? What musical?” “It’s nothing Cas, just forget it. Okay?” “No. Tell me what you guys are talking about. Please?” His giant of a brother just looked at him and smiled while he whispered “Deestiel.” And stuck his tongue out at him like when he was a chubby five year old. “Can it and eat your salad omelet, before I shove it down your throat.” “What is a Deestiel? Is it a person you guys met working a case?” Cas asked questioningly. Okay this time Dean was red from head to toe. “It’s not a person Cas. It’s a uh. Nothing okay?? Drop it, would ya?” Jesus he was not going to let this go, later he would kill Sam for opening this can of worms. “Dean, if you don’t tell me what this is, I’ll just ask Sam about it later when you’re not around.” Holy fucking hell he could just picture Cas asking Sam later about it and his brother going into some weird ass explanation that wasn’t true. “Okay. Come on, I’m not going to watch Sam enjoy the benefit of bringing this up.” He walked into the library and sat down pulling a chair out for the angel. “The musical was about the book series Supernatural, remember the books? Well these kids turned it into a musical and it had you in it as well. And uh they thought we were dating. They called it Destiel, like BradGelina or something. I don’t know, but it was awkward, that whole thing was.” He just giggled beside him, “Why didn’t you just say that? What is the big deal?” This made the rugged hunter blush even harder, “Oh, um nothing is a big deal then. I guess.” Cas stood up and went back into the kitchen chatting with Sam, damn that stupid moose. He could hear his brother laughing and talking about the musical. Fuck this, he thought as he walked to his room. He laid down and put on his headphones. ACDC blared through them so loudly he didn’t hear his bedroom door open. The tall Winchester sat down on his brother’s bed and shook his leg, “Dean, I know why you’re so upset about the musical.” He sighed and took off the headphones, “What the hell is that do you think? That I’m in love with a freaking angel or a man to be more specific? Hell no. That whole experience was just awful. I want to forget it altogether but you won’t let that happen, will you?” ‘I knew it’ Sam thought as he shook his head at his brother, “I wasn’t going to say that, but if you really do love him then you should just tell him. It’s obvious he feels the same way about you man, I mean I know you can’t see how you two look at each other but everybody else does, and we all know that you two are madly in love. You’re just too stupid to realize it.” “Sam, I’ve never loved a man in my whole life, especially an angel why would Cas be any different? Why? Because he raised me from hell, saved me, rebelled for me, fell from heaven and has died countless numbers of times because of me.?! I knew when we we’re fighting after I-I killed that kid because of the mark and he never not once fought back. He said to me, that after everyone else had passed that it would be him that stayed by my side. He was saying that he wanted to spend his life with me. Even after every single thing I had done not only to others but to him… He can’t love me back, there’s no way. I’ve done too much. I-I can’t. Besides I’m not gay, I like women.” He was out of breath after finally letting the truth spill out about how he felt and Sam wasn’t even shocked. “Like I said, everyone who can see knows how you two feel about each other. Dean, do you think that he would do all of those things for you, if he didn’t love you??” Sammy was right but he’d never admit it. *Knock Knock* “Dean? Are you still upset about what happened at the store or is it because of the… Destiel thing” Cas asked peeking into the room. “No, no I’m fine. Sam and I were just talking about a case.” The younger Winchester just looked at him as if to say ‘Seriously dude’? The angel walked into the room and nodded towards the door as if to tell Sam to leave already so he and Dean could talk privately. He stood awkwardly, hovering over Dean. “Look, I know I’ve been kind of moody lately and with the mark I can’t even begin to tell you how sorry I am about what happened. I didn’t mean to hurt you, it wasn’t me. I was just so overthrown by Charlie’s death and the mark told hold of me. I would never hurt you intentionally, and if I had killed you I would have never forgave myself. I don’t know what made me stop, but I’m more than grateful that I did. I just, I’m sorry Cas.” He hadn’t realized he was crying until a tear fell down his cheek, he quickly wiped I away before he saw the grown man crying. “Dean. I never would blame you for those things. You weren’t yourself. I knew that, I know what the real Dean Winchester is like, the Dean that I know is sitting on this bed. We removed the mark and you came back to me. To us. I mean. I knew that the man I fell in love with was still there, and it was even more true when you didn’t kill me, just like I over threw Naomi’s mind control, because true love can overcome anything. Family love that is. I uh don’t mean to make you uncomfortable Dean. I just, uh don’t have a lot of experience in this particular area.” Cas said as he sat on the bed and looked his favorite hunter in those eyes of emerald green. “I knew you wouldn’t hurt me. You never have… I’ve hurt you so many times, some so recklessly and casually. I was so selfish that I didn’t think about you or Sam being affected by it. I can never truly tell you in words how sorry I am and how much you mean to me.” “Do you really mean that? Did you mean what you said about loving me?” “Yes-yes of course I just didn’t know how to say it, because I didn’t think that you would return those feelings. But I love you more than anything and anyone. It’s why I listen to your thoughts all the time, and watch you sleep…” Cas loved him. This beautiful, stubborn, and magnificent celestial being actually loved him. “How could I not love you? I love you. You have done more for me than anybody, including my own family. I’ve loved you for a long time, I just didn’t realize it until after purgatory and after that I was just in denial about being with a man, but I don’t care because you’re perfect and I love you just the way you are. Penis and all.” It was Cas’s turn to blush this time, and it made the hunter smile from ear to ear, he was so cute when he blushed. Before Dean’s brain could catch up with his body he was pulling Cas’s tie to bring his lips closer so that he could feel them against his own. “mmf. Dean.” The angel gasped as he pulled away from his hunter to hold his face. He had to double check to make sure this was real, he knew it was because right as he was pulling Dean’s face closer to his own he heard Sam clearing his throat. “Um guys? As happy as I am that you two finally fessed up to being brokeback together, you forgot to turn the stove off so the sprinklers went off. Just wanted you to know…But uh I’ll clean it up, you two just keep it down I don’t want to be scarred for life.” Cas blushed again and nodded as Dean turned over and hid his face in the pillow and mumbled “Thanks Sammy.”
“Let’s go.” Dean said pulling him towards something in the distance.
“Oh yeah? What about it do you like?”
being human. And if you leave because of that I hate you.”
, falling, dying, rebelling, I just couldn’t
“Well. I promised Eileen I would be in bed hours ago. Goodnight lovebirds.” He clapped him on the shoulder as he passed.
He was well enough now, he thought, to leave and be on his own. The last time he was human he did it, he could do it again. Anything would be better than the hollow feeling he had radiating throughout his body causing him to shake.
Not a chapter, but the rest of the fic. Enjoy!
*Hours Later*
“I don’t understand. I fell asleep so easily earlier and now it couldn’t seem more difficult.”
“Dad can we stay at least a month at this next town?”
“I’m sorry man, it’s just the jeans. Let’s get those off.” He begins unbuttoning Cas’s new jeans and slides them down to reveal Dean’s boxers.
“Come on just let me help. Your cut up pretty bad on your face.” Cas wiped his hand across his face and looked at his hand, he wobbled before almost falling as he fainted. Luckily Dean was there to catch him before he fell and picked him up and put him in the back of the Impala. “Sam will you grab his stuff?” Sam grabbed the books and bag off of the ground and put them in the back. “What happened to him?” “Some asshole beat him up but he fainted when he saw the blood. I’m gonna take him to Bobby’s and patch him up.” When they got to Bobby’s he was glad when he saw that he wasn’t there. He went to the back and picked up the dark haired guy and took him inside on the couch. “Sam will you find a first aid kit? I think he’s going to need stitches.” “Yeah there’s one in my room I’ll go get it.” Going to the kitchen he grabbed some alcohol to clean the wound, carefully he dabbed some on the other man’s face. “Dammit Cas. You’re gonna have to learn to fight back at these assholes. I’ll do what I can but I’m not always going to be around especially since you hate me.” Carefully he stroked the dark hair checking for a head wound, God he had soft hair that felt like feathers. When he didn’t feel anything he reluctantly pulled his hand away so he wouldn’t be creepy. “Dean? Where am I?” “My house. Don’t worry I’ll take you home soon, I know you don’t want to be anywhere near me but you fainted and I wasn’t going to just leave you there. I patched you up, you need some stitches though. I can do it myself but if you’d rather go to the hospital I’ll drive you there.” “I don’t hate you. You just saved my life practically and you think I hate you?” “Well don’t you?” “No, I was just trying to protect you from this right here” he said pointing to himself. “Don’t worry about me, I’m not the one who’s all banged up. Good news is you don’t have any serious wounds.” “Not yet. Anyways.” “You’re not going to and you’re not going to get off that easy, I’m not going anywhere. From now on I’m going to drive you home, and don’t bother telling me no.” “Fine. But be prepared for torment from Alistair and Ralph. They hate me and anybody who hangs out with me.” “So I noticed, but I can take care of them. Don’t worry about it.” “Why do you care so much anyways?” “I uh don’t know” he said as he finished patching him up. “Well whatever the reason, be careful. I won’t have anybody getting hurt because of me, especially not the schools new pretty boy Dean Winchester.” “You think I’m pretty? Wow maybe you do have a head injury.” Blushing, Cas mumbled “shut up.” “Alright you’re all better, come on I’ll drive you home.” “I don’t have to be home right away.” “Oh. Okay. Cool, so why is everybody calling you a fag? What’s that about?” “In the ninth grade they saw me kissing my then boyfriend Balthazar and ever since then they’ve made sure to torment me. Thankfully Balthazar moved so they can’t mess with him anymore but it’s better that way things weren’t working out between us, he only wanted to sleep with me.” Upon realizing that he had reveled too much information he blushed, “Maybe I do have a head injury. I don’t normally tell strangers that much about myself.” “Well that’s because I’m not a stranger, and don’t worry about it.” So Cas was gay or he at least dated men but he still looked leery of being Dean’s friend, so he backed off and got up leaving Castiel on the couch. Grabbing a beer from the fridge and he didn’t bother to ask if the boy on the couch wanted anything. Sam came into the living room and began to introduce himself to Castiel. “Hey you’re awake, I’m Sam, Dean’s brother. I’m glad you’re okay.” “I’m Castiel Novak, but your brother likes to call me Cas, you can call me that too if you like. Pleasure to meet you.” “I’m taking Castiel home if you want to tag along. I may pick up some grub on the way for later.” Castiel frowned “You called me Castiel.” “You told me to.” “I did you’re right. Thank you for your kindness.” “I’m in to tag along, but I need to stop by the library.” “Of course you do.” Loading into the Impala he turned to ask where the other boy lived. “I’ll show you.” After he dropped him off Sam moved up front. “You like him don’t you?” Blushing he shook his head “Shut up.”
All the encounters he had of a romantic or sexual nature had been by following what the other person did. But Dean seemed to be unsure as well.
Cas picked up Dean and turned the TV off, with Dean’s arms wrapped around his neck he took him to their bed. Singing the whole way there he placed him on the bed. When Dean shifted he stroked his hair, “You’re okay baby, and I was just moving us to the bedroom.” “Alright.” With Dean laying his head down on his chest he closed his eyes. Waking up surprised he rubbed his eyes, had he fell asleep? “Morning babe, by the by did you sleep?” “I uh guess so that’s never happened before though. I must be closer to becoming human than I thought.” “Whatever happens we’ll get through it, and I like you sleeping next to me. Also I like using your chest as a pillow and you’re getting kind of pudgy yourself.” “Really? I’ve been working out with Sam every now and again to maintain muscle.” “No not really and I was meaning to ask you about that. You are really sexy you know that? All muscle and tan skin makes a guy go crazy.” “Please, it’s all Jimmy not me.” “Screw Jimmy this is you babe. Jimmy died a long time ago. All of this is Cas.” “You’re right honey.” Pressing kisses to his neck before getting up to get dressed, and man if he wasn’t going to enjoy the view. “You know you’re the one with the ass that doesn’t quit.” Dean started to wiggle his ass and slowly put on his jeans. “Oh Dean, there is something I have to ask you. Gabe brought up the sex of the baby and I told him I would ask you. Do you want a boy or a girl?” “Honestly I haven’t thought about it, I mean either way I’ll be happy.” “I feel the same way. I’ll tell him to surprise us with the gender.” Getting up to get dressed he ruffled through the hunters dresser drawers. “What are you looking for?” “Different clothes to wear. The trench coat and suit is all I own, and it gets a bit uncomfortable sometimes. I thought I could wear your clothes, if you don’t mind that is.” “No of course I don’t mind. Here wear this.” He handed him a sweater with blue print on it. When he put it on it was too big for him but he didn’t mind, then he slipped on some jeans. “You look great in my clothes. Just adorable.” “Thanks, let’s get some breakfast. I want to talk to Gabe about the baby.” Walking to the kitchen to see that Gabe and Sam had already made breakfast. “I made you some bacon and eggs. Dean Specialty.” “Thanks Sammy.” When they were finished eating Cas changed the conversation to the baby. “Dean and I discussed the sex of the baby and we decided that we would be happy either way.” “Great! It’s a girl. Congratulations!” Sam was smiling ear to ear, “Have you thought of any names just yet?” “Um no not really, Cas do you have anything in mind?” “What about Mary? After your mother.” “That’s sweet babe, but Sammy called dibs a long time ago.” “What about Eliza?” “I like that name, we could call her Lizzie.” “Sounds perfect to me” “Alright get a room you two.” “Can it Sammy.” He stood up and took Dean’s hand with him, “We better get going if we want to find a good house.” “Oho baby bro house hunting now? Little Cassie is all grown up.” He rolled his eyes “I’m not much younger than you Gabriel.” Leaving the bunker hand in hand they headed out to look for a house. “Do you have an idea of where we should start?” “No but I trust your judgement Dean, you did look up available houses online right?” “Yeah, and I looked at the school ratings for the neighborhood. We’re only going to look at the ones with the best schools.” “You’re already the best Dad. Eliza is going to have the best Daddies.” The first house they looked at was really nice but Dean didn’t like the kitchen, and he didn’t like the yard. The number one on his wish list for their new home was a nice garden, he would have bees and flowers everywhere. He couldn’t wait. “Dean, you’re right about the kitchen but the bedroom is very big. I don’t really like the yard, I want to have a garden and maybe a pool.” “Yeah I know, I considered that. Then we can have pool parties like a regular run of the mill family.” “That sounds nice honey. Eliza will have a great home.” “Come on we still have another house to look at.” The next house was the first one on the street and a new Victorian two story house. It had a nice and spacious yard due to its location and a pool in the back yard. The roof looked like it could use some work but everything else appeared to be up to shape. “What do you think so far babe?” “I like the yard, it has good soil to have a garden in.” “It has a pool out back too, but we should check out the inside before we write any checks.” “I thought we weren’t going to write a check, Gabe said he would buy it with Balthazar’s money. He left it all at his house where he kept heavens weapons. Very foolish, but lucky for us, no?” “Huh, and yeah guess so.” The front entrance had a coat room that they both liked, the living room was adjacent to it and was quite big. The kitchen and dining room were down the hall and Dean gasped when he saw the kitchen. “I’m sold. This kitchen is awesome.” It had all new appliances and marble countertops with black tile flooring. “This floor looks like the perfect place to fuck.” “It looks awfully uncomfortable Dean.” “We’ll throw down a blanket or something.” “You and you’re crazy fantasies babe.” “You have no idea.” He was starting to get the picture though. “I can already smell the pie’s baking in here, and the burgers grilling out back by the pool.” They left the kitchen to explore the rest of the house and found it had a study, three bedrooms, and two bathrooms. “The bathroom is nice, but it doesn’t compare to the letter’s shower room because that tub is just awesome. The Jacuzzi is nice though.” “I can only imagine the things you have planned for us in there.” “Oho you better be ready for what I have planned for us in this house, because it will be wild ride.” “Besides the bathroom being too small what do you think babe? Do you love it or is it just me?” “I love it.” “Good so do I.” They called Gabe and Sammy with the news telling them to seal the deal. “I want Castiel and Dean Winchester to be the name on the title okay?” He was glad Dean wanted him to have his last name, if it was legal they’d make it official. “Now we have to pick out furniture and the whole works.” “I think it will be fun honey, we get to create a new home and future.” “Yeah we do. We should celebrate.” “Hmm what do you have in mind?” “Burgers, pie, and sex. What else?” “Of course what better way to celebrate?” “My thoughts exactly. Let’s go.” When they got to the bunker Lucky and Harry were curled up on the couch right next Sam and Gabe. Any more couples and they would turn into a group, but now the four of them could double date.
When the light returns Castiel is gone, leaving not a single clue behind.
“Goodbye Dean.”
“I love you Cas. I’m sorry it took so long to tell you.”
" "You shouldn't thank my father for the modern bathroom, I believe it was a German man who invented it and the use of them." Dean began to protest but snapped his mouth shut quickly when the angel began to take off the doctors coat. "This is not as comfortable as my usual attire Sam, how much longer do I need to wear this?" Laughing as his brother runs into the bathroom "Uh not too much longer Cas, you've been a big help. I can't tell you how grateful we are. Especially Dean." "I'm not sure I understand this, but I find that I lack the emotion to care."
“What’s up Sammy?” “So get this, I might have found a way to reverse whatever it is that thing did to Cas. We’ll discuss it more after I do some more research I think Bobby had a few books on it somewhere but they’re in the archives in Sioux Falls. So road trip?” “I don’t think Cas is well enough to leave here on his own, but if you want to take one of the cars and hit the road go ahead. Just be careful and don’t take any cases without me. Okay?” Sam nods “Sure, so uh are you watching
Chapter Three: New Beginnings.
“I am so sorry, I had no idea and I just, uh. My brother and I are probably classified as alcoholics too but it comes and goes with the problems. My dad though, he was a terrible drunk. Thank god he didn’t take it on me, but I think sometimes he took it out on Dean. Of course, he never said so but I’d see the bruises and I’d know deep down.”
Emerald green eyes shine with sadness, “Wait. Don’t go.”
“Edna? Nah, she said I remind her of her grandson. I eat here when I can, it’s kind of a little get away. Not a lot traffic comes through here. I’m amazed they’ve stayed open so long.” Cas hums in agreement, he never knew Dean came here, and he
Sam’s voice knocks him out of his deep thoughts “Yes. I understand I’m going to talk to him now. What did you find in the archives?”
Notes: This may be the last chapter I write for this fic, I haven’t decided yet… But, if you want me to continue it comment and tell me! I hope you’ve enjoyed this fic of ups and downs with all the Dean/Cas feels you could want. Don’t worry I haven’t forgotten about Sammy, if I continue writing there will be a surprise in store!. Love you beanies. –SuperBatLover16
When Dean woke up he was still in Cas’s arms, except now they were in his room at the bunker. “Good morning love, I trust you slept well?” He nodded and pressed his lips against the angel’s neck “mmhm. Sure did.” “Good, um Dean, how often do you have that dream?” The reoccurring nightmare had begun directly after he had the fight with his angel, “Ever since it happened, and I always end up killing you. I hate it, because I-I almost did.” “You didn’t, we’re both alive and better than that we’re together. Right? But I wasn’t talking about that dream, although we should discuss that more later on. I was talking about the one where we are in a suburban home with a baby girl. She-she was beautiful, she had your eyes and the freckles I love so much. I wish I could’ve seen more of it.” “It was the first time, but I do want that. I want to have a home with you, and children. Plural. Sammy can always babysit when we need some alone time.” Oh no, he hoped that he didn’t freak Cas out too much by dropping the family bombshell on him. “Uh Cas? Do you want kids? I’m sorry if I freaked you out.” He could feel the angel sigh beneath him, “No you idiot, of course I want children especially yours. The baby even had my dark hair, she was just beautiful.” Good, he hadn’t freaked him out then, “Sometimes, we have more than one baby, sometimes we have a boy and a girl. The boy usually has Sam’s color of hair, that mud brown color, and your eyes, but on its face it has like a million freckles. They’re always beautiful though. All of them, especially the ones that have your eyes.” The Guinea pigs squeaked giving note that they were hungry. “I should probably feed them.” He frowned at the absence of his boyfriend’s body underneath him, ugh he was becoming soft. “Dean, don’t pout I’ll literally be right back. Besides you need to eat something, your stomach is signaling hunger.” Freakin’ angels. “Ugh fine, but maybe I won’t cook for you this time.” “Uh! Come on!” He ran into the kitchen with the angel on his heels when he felt strong arms wrap around his body, “Got ya.” Hmm “Okay babe, but you have to promise me that we will do this again later.” Pecking kisses along his neck he felt his angel hum in agreement. “Ouch. That’s going to leave a mark you know?” “So? I believe those are your words are they not?” Once again he could feel teeth graze his neck, “You keep that up and I won’t be able to do anything except pin you against that wall right there.” The hot mouth left his neck and instead he felt a hand grab his own. “Later?” “Later.” For breakfast he made pancakes and didn’t protest when his angel tied his pink frilly apron around his waist for him. “Is Sam up yet?” As soon as he said that he heard footsteps come into the kitchen. “Sam should be out in a minute, hi I’m Sally.” The woman standing in his kitchen was tall, like inhuman tall. She had dirty blonde hair that curled down her back with familiar honey eyes to match. Cas had gone still beside him, what the hell was going on around here? Yesterday Sam had said that the girl wasn’t his type and too forward. “Babe, you okay?” “Babe? You two are together? I never thought I’d see the day. I mean we all knew but damn.” “Um, excuse me? Who the hell are you, and what the fuck do you know about me and my boyfriend?!” Dean had already moved in front of the woman and held a gun against her chin. “Start talking. Now.” “Woo Dean-o calm down. Don’t you recognize me??” He heard Cas shift behind him before saying “Gabriel. Why are you in a woman’s vessel?” “GABRIEL?! Fucking GABRIEL! Damn angels. No offense babe.” “None taken, Gabe why the hell are you here and what are you doing with Sam? Answer or you’ll die for the final time, I won’t have you coming in between me and my family.” Now his boyfriend was holding an angel blade against the other angel’s chest. “Guys? What the hell is going on?” “Sammy this Sally isn’t who she says she is? Take a gander at who it is. Guess.” “It’s Gabriel. I know. Big deal?” He took a step back, “Big deal? It is a big deal. This douche bag killed me over and over again and stuck us in TV land that sucked serious ass. And you know? How in the hell are you okay with this?” “Does it really matter? Just drop the angel blade, he’s uh she’s one of the good guys.” “I prefer either one, but Gabe in general is fine.” “Shut your face asshole.” His angel really had picked up a few things from them and he wasn’t having any of his brothers shit and neither was Dean. “Are you like possessed? Come on man!” “No, I am not possessed. I finally found my soul mate. I was supportive of you, now why can’t you just be happy for me?” He sighed heavily before removing his gun and pulling on Cas’s arm to make him drop the blade. “Let’s go babe, we don’t have to stay here and listen to this shit.” “Dean, wait. I don’t have many brothers and sisters left. I want to hear what he has to say.” He sat down with his gun still in hand and pulled his angel next to him, but didn’t allow him to sit on his lap. He wouldn’t let his guard down just yet, he didn’t trust Gabriel and he didn’t want Cas getting hurt along the way. “Start talking, now.” Gabriel moved to stand beside Sam, “Well I’d taken a particular interest in ol’ Sammy here and I didn’t realize until I realize until I saw the way my baby brother looked at you Dean that I felt the same way about Sam here. Somewhere in the midst of my teasing I fell in love with his sarcasm and wit and his body, ugh just fantastic right?” Sam was blushing, and started to speak up “I didn’t figure it out at first, but I knew I recognized those honey eyes from somewhere. When he said his last name was Singer and Sally I mean really? Come on, you cheese ball. I knew something was up so I texted her and when we went out all she ate was desert. But I didn’t get it until he slipped up and asked about you. See I never said your name and yet he asked how Dean was. So I pinned him against a wall and asked who the hell he was and why he had been following me. Except then he was a female still in my mind and uh. Well things happened afterwards and I guess he just felt bad and wanted to tell me. I wasn’t too surprised really, but now it all makes sense. Even though he didn’t rescue me like your angel did he did make me realize something, he made me realize that I deserve to have somebody by my side and that he was that person/angel.” Dean was shocked, his brother was going to date Gabriel. “Okay I just have one question, what happened to your other vessel? I mean I’m supportive of you but why did you lose your other meat suit, we’re you really willing to go that far to get in Sammy’s pants?” Gabriel chuckled, “Uh no, my other vessel had taken one too many blows to the head and so I found a new attractive one that I knew he would find appealing. I’ve always liked my eye color though, so I kept it. She had these pretty blue ones but I thought nah mine are way better. I didn’t know however that Sammy here would be so kind to remember what my eyes looked like. But he did.” “How could anybody forget eyes like those?” God, now he knew what his brother meant by the get a room comment and frowned. Him and Cas we’re way cuter, and they were soul mates. Nothing could ever compare to their love story not even his little bro’s. “Well how touching. Sam’s room is down the hall to the left. Go to it. You’re making me and Cas sick.” “Hey isn’t this weird Cassy? Each of us got a Winchester boy, except I got the XL version. Ha!” What the hell. This family really was 50 shades of weird. “Alright now that we have officially become Southern’s, I’m going to hurl.” “Come on, it’s not that big of a deal. Finish your little breakfast Martha Stuart.” “Nice baby.” Now he knew why they were together, together there sass was way too much for any one person to handle alone. His brother was happy, that’s all that mattered. “Can it Sally.” They left the kitchen and headed to the couch to watch TV. “Cas babe, you alright?” “I’m fine Dean, relieved actually. I thought all of my brothers and sisters we’re dead or hated me. Now I have Gabriel again, growing up he was the one who took care of me most of the time. He protected me against Michael. Balthazar was always nice too but I-I killed him…” “You did what you had to do, don’t dwell on it. He’s here now right?” “Yeah he is, and more importantly you’re here.” “And that’ll never change. I promise.” He pulled Cas into his lap and kissed him passionately, things we’re finally falling into place. Suddenly a wet nose was against his hand and he groaned before pulling away from chapped lips. “Sam, you-r” he was stopped short when he looked down and seen that the nose didn’t belong to Harry. “Uh what the hell? Sam!” His giant of a brother walked up Gabriel in hand, “What?” “Why is there a pit bull in my living room? You’re lucky we have Harry but two dogs? Man, that’s pushing it!” “Her name is Lucky and she’s very good, house trained and all.” Dammit, there was already enough animals in the bunker. “Dean, come on she’s good. Please?” “What-ever. But she better not pee anywhere, and don’t let her on the furniture. K?” They both nodded before taking Lucky out of the kitchen. “Dean don’t let them get to you. Come on, you promised me you would let me chase you later. Well it’s later, and I’m in the mood to chase you.” He groaned, “Not with Sam and Gabriel in the house. It’s weird. I feel like its some weird competition. I mean did you see how many hickies they had?” Fingers were on his neck, “You have one here, here and here. I can give you more if you’d like.” “Or I can give you some for once.” The fingers on his neck tightened and he looked up into crystal blue eyes. “Wait.” Ugh if he waited any longer his dick would break because of the strain the jeans were putting on his already hard cock. The ass that was pressing up against it was removed and his boyfriend left the room. “Cas?” In the kitchen Cas was telling Sam and Gabriel to take a walk for a bit so him and Dean could have the bunker to themselves. Gabriel laughed and agreed but Sam was hesitant. “Do not fuck in my bedroom. Okay? I’ll know if you do. And so help me if you do me and Gabe will fuck in the impala and dean would just love that.” “Deal. Now leave.” Cas re-entered the kitchen and sat on his hunters lap, rubbing his ass on the hard dick. Straddling Dean’s hips he rocked back and forth making the hunter groan. “We’ve been over this, don’t tease. Come on babe please? Just move a little bit. Give me something.” “Be careful what you wish for Dean Winchester.” The angel seductively growled in his ear before biting it, he could tease too. He pulled him back from his ear and kissed him and without asking for entrance pushed his tongue into the other man’s mouth. Their tongues danced as their teeth knocked together a few times out of passion. Needing air he pulled back slowly but as he did he took the angels lip with him. Biting down lightly he grinned when he heard the angel groan. This was going to be so much fun, and he was going to make sure to draw it out nice and slow. Letting go he kissed his way along his angel’s scruffy jawline and was sure to leave marks along the way. He nipped and licked until he reached the collar of his angel’s shirt. He slipped off the plain black shirt he was wearing as he undid Cas’s button up. He loved how toned and tan he was and made sure to show it. When he reached the end he threw the shirt off of the other man’s body and immediately latched on to a nipple. Determined to make Cas come undone he circled his tongue around it before pulling on it with his teeth. “De-an. Dmf.” Hearing the angels hoarse voice he felt accomplished. “Beg for it.” “Please-e.” Man, if this is what he could do with his tongue he couldn’t imagine what the angel would be doing once he started using his dick. He let go of the nipple and licked and sucked his way slowly down until he reached his destination. At this point Cas’s was bent as far as he could go, he picked up his angel and moved to the table. Unbuckling the belt he pulled off the dress pants and pressed his hips down onto the angels and bucked. Hating the restriction the jeans were causing he pulled down his own pants and made his way back up to look in lust filled blue eyes. Sealing their lips together he began to circle his hips feeling the other man’s dick rub against his own. Fuck. So much for teasing, he needed to pay attention to his own dick, and soon. Knowing he could wait a little bit longer he made his way down to Cas’s boxers and mouthed at the dick underneath. Finally he pulled them off and circled his mouth against the throbbing and leaking dick. He didn’t spend too much time down there, only enough to make his angel shake a bit, but he wouldn’t let him cum just yet. He still had plans for them. Once again he picked up his angel and received a moan in reply, “D-d” “Shh I’ve got you, I’ll be in you soon enough angel.” Roughly but also gently he pressed his angel against the wall, pressing his fingers into his mouth he sucked on them before circling them around Cas’s tight hole. Moving one in slowly he bit at the thigh that was beside his face as he pulled it out slowly and put another one in. Creating a rhythm he began to rock back and forth before adding one last finger. Finally he found the other man’s sweet spot and he curled his fingers. “Yeah you like that don’t you babe? You’ll be cumming soon enough, just hold out for a little longer.” Giving his dick a few strokes and rubbing it against the ass that was beneath him he lined up to pound Cas. “Dean” was barely a whisper above him and his moans were starting to become louder and louder. Pushing in the tip he picked up the rhythm from earlier and rocked into his favorite angelic ass. Dean was barely holding on himself and so when he pressed a kiss into his angel’s neck and heard the muffled deep groan he lost it completely and so did his angel. After he just held him there before pulling out and pressing a kiss to his lips again. “Dean that was amazing. I should tease you more often.” “I don’t care what you do as long as you use that same sexed out voice every time. Deal?” His angel grinned at him “Deal.” Kissing one last time before letting Cas down and handing him his underwear. “Here, just in case Lucky decides to return.” “I sent them all away for a while, Sam said something along the lines of ‘Don’t fuck in my bedroom.’ Then they were gone.” “Oh okay good, then we can do what we had discussed earlier.” Pulling up his own underwear he grabbed his angel around the waist before whispering in his ear, “Tag, you’re it.” It was on now and he scurried across the floor before his angel could comprehend what was going on. “Dean?” He laughed as he hid behind a wall waiting for him to catch up. “Dean? I don’t understand what is going on? Are we playing a game?” His giggle gave him away as the angel rounded the corner, he ran away again and laughed the whole way. “Dean? This is childish. Come on.” “It is not. It’s fun, now come on.” “No. I don’t want to play, I like being near you and clearly you want to get as far away from me as possible.” Dammit now Cas was pouting. “Fine we won’t play. Come here.” When the angel reached him he smiled a wicked smile and tapped him on the shoulder “Now, you’re it.” Cas was gone, “No fair, you can’t use your mojo to disappear! It’s against the rules!” Where had he gone to now? He ran discreetly trying to be quiet but he knew he was caught when he felt a strong pair of arms against his waist. Fuck, the game was over. “I said you were it. Now you’re really going to get it.” Sure, he was shaking he was so scared. “Yeah. Okay babe. Do what you want.” “Careful Dean.” He laughed again and felt himself being turned around with a hot mouth pressed up against his own. Cas pushed him down to the floor and sat on his hips, “What are you going to do to me?” Smiling his wicked smile again he leaned down and pulled out a… Guinea pig? “Not what I had in mind babe.” “They’re going to cuddle with you. And you’re going to enjoy it.” The rodent was now sitting on his chest twitching her nose. He had to admit they were kind of cute. She crawled up to his neck and tickled him along the way. “I didn’t know you were ticklish under your chin Dean.” “I’m not, the things harry. It just feels funny.” “Bad funny?” “No, babe not bad funny.” “Good, I knew you would grow to like them in time.” Sure he loved tiny rodents, but at least these were cute and they made Cas happy. “I just didn’t have this in mind when you threw me on the floor. I was thinking of something better and dirtier.” “Guinea pigs are very clean despise what you may think. And I just now understood what you meant.” Removing the rodent he snapped his fingers and they were gone but was instantly replaced by his fingers under Dean’s chin. “Stop it that tickles.” “As you wish.” Now Cas was kissing him where his fingers once were and his tongue was licking up and down his neck. “It still tickles.” He got up and moved his ass against Dean’s hips. “Oof.” Cas pulled on Dean’s hair and smiled his wicked smile again. “Is this what you had in mind?” “Yeah except your ass wasn’t on my stomach.” “Oh, well too bad because I like this seat. It’s comfortable.” Poking at the little fat Dean had he laughed, “I think you ate too much pie yesterday, but that’s okay I like your little pudge.” “I do not have pudge. I am a grown ass man with muscles, not pudge.” “It’s a little pudgy. Don’t worry I need some support when we cuddle.” He poked his lip out, “I don’t have pudge.” “Oh you’re right it’s all steel muscle.” Moving his head down towards Dean’s stomach he began to think that he was going to give him head but instead he felt Cas’s mouth blow a raspberry on his stomach. “You’re so weird babe. Stoop stop-pp. It tickles.” “Well you’re just ticklish everywhere aren’t you baby?” Wiggling his fingers against the chiseled and yet somewhat pudgy stomach he blew another raspberry on the stomach. The bunker door opened with a bang, “I hope you two are done fucking because we’re home!” “We are home? Since when does Gabriel live here? Get up man I have to put some clothes on, I don’t want your brother to see me like this. I still don’t trust him.” Instantly he missed the warmth Cas had provided. Suddenly he had clothes on and he looked up at his angel in surprise, “Did you do that?” “Yes, you said it was making you uncomfortable so I fixed it.” “Oh thanks babe.” He helped him up and smoothed his hair down, “Don’t think that this is over, I plan on finishing the tickling later on.” “Woo tickling? What an interesting way to put it baby bro.” “Sam. Can I talk to you alone?” “Sure.” Pulling on his brother’s arm he walked them to the next room, “What the hell. Gabriel is not living here. Nobody ever discussed this with me, I mean shouldn’t he like ask for my blessing or something?” “Dean we’re not getting married or anything just calm down. I know you two haven’t gotten along that well in the past and hell neither did me and him, but he’s changed. Just trust me okay?” “Fine, just be careful. Okay? One wrong move and he’s out of here. No questions asked.” “Yeah.” When they walked back into the living room Cas and Gabriel were laughing. “Do you remember when Michael made the dolphins and Dad was so sure that the shark would eat them? But he was just so insistent on keeping them. He made them very intelligent too.” “Yes. Dad was so upset because he thought his sharks we’re the best sea animals ever created, and he was proved wrong. That was before Michael turned into heavens perfect solider.” Now they were both frowning. Dean broke the silence, “Reminiscing? Are we?” Cas replied “Yes we were just discussing heaven’s greatest creations.” “Ah, and who invented the mosquito? Great creation. A-plus.” Sam replied sarcastically and Gabriel chuckled, “Hun, their actually necessary. Frogs and spiders eat them. But to answer your question it was Ralph. He quote ‘wanted to torture the humans.’ Yes I know Dean-o he’s a major douche, and we all agree.” “Actually I was going to ask who made the platypus but I agree” he said patting Gabriel on the shoulder. Maybe he wasn’t all bad, he was Cas’s brother after all and Sammy obviously liked him. He had to admit Sam looked happy as he laughed in agreement. “I actually made that. It’s my finest creation ever. Besides of course the Winchesters. Just kidding not my department, I was barely a millennium old when you two were created but I do remember the old man talking about your legacy and well you know the rest.” Sammy looked shocked and baffled, “What possessed you to create a platypus? I mean what do they even do?” “What do they do? Nothing, they’re just unbelievably cute. Nothing else is needed.” Dean was laughing and hard, “So wait you created something just because it’s cute? What an abusive of power, wait Cas did you make Guinea pigs?” Cas blushed “No I wish, I was always in the garrison. Soldiers of Heaven don’t get to create things. However Gabriel was always one of fathers favorites.” “Not as much as Luci. He never shut up about him like ever. But it’s true he adored me.” Sam touched Gabe’s face “How could he not? You are undoubtedly adorable.” “Get. A. Room.” “Dean I sat forever watching you two eye fuck each other across the room before you finally grew balls to tell each other how you feel after 5 years. So you don’t get to tell me to get a room, besides when we came in Cas was on top of you. As if that won’t be burned into my retinas.” He was blushing “Shut it. You guys weren’t supposed to be home. And we never eye fucked. He just has really pretty eyes.” His boyfriend was looking at him with a silly grin “Actually we weren’t screwing around as you put it, I was um actually tickling your brother. He’s very ticklish some places.” Dammit. “Babe. That-is-private.” “Oho private huh? You freak you, I can’t believe shy Cassie here is with an S&M guy like yourself.” “Okay this has gone on long enough, we were playing tag you sickos. Besides we’re not the ones with purple necks are we? You two look like a bunch of hormonal teenagers. Come on babe I’m getting tired of all the sass in this room.” “What else did you create?” “Gabriel helped with the makings of many creatures, the moose for example. That was you Gabe right? Or was that Balthazar?” “Cas, I said lets go. I can’t handle their sassiness any longer.” “Dean wait. I want to catch up with him. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Ugh. Fine.” “Dean don’t pout. We have all the time in the world.” He stuck his tongue out at all three of them, he did not pout. “Actually Balthy and I both made the moose and I can understand why that dick of hell calls my Sammy here Moose. He is awfully tall and a bit hairy.” “I never understood why he calls me that. Moose are dumb and not to brag but I’m not stupid or sheepish.” God he was so full of himself sometimes, puh-lease. Ugh he was tired of this conversation, he went to the kitchen to get a beer. When he returned they were all laughing about the supernatural books. “No the musical is way better, of course you’re not in it, because you’re not the Winchester’s guardian angel like myself but it’s very good. We should all see it sometime.” “Hell no. I only made an exception for you because I wanted you to see what Sam was talking about.” “Please I am the whole reason you two ever confessed your undying love for each other. Without me mentioning the musical you never would have told him how you feel. Now would you?” Sam had a point, but he wasn’t going to tell him that. “Shut up. I would have told him eventually. Besides you never would have dated Gabe if he didn’t possess a female vessel would you? Exactly.” Cas was now gone and Sam looked pissed. Fuck he never should have ran his mouth now they would all be fighting…
“Is the jerky all gone?”
“Hmm?”
“Dammit Dean.” What hell was he thinking about making a deal? They never ended well.
, that you’d come back. Loyal as always. Right by my side looking at me as if I was the northern star. And as selfish as it was I kept you around,
Two months earlier*
He sat there for a few minutes listening to a Beatles song.
“You know he uh passed right?”
“Dean. We don’t have to talk about it, I know it makes you uncomfortable. My feelings haven’t changed but I don’t want to lose you or Sam. So if it’s alright with you, we can just forget I ever said anything, okay?”
