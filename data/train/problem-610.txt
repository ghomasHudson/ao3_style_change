Over the next few weeks the pattern repeated - more conversations were had about what they would allow to happen, how they would like to broach the subject to Greg, if they would consider bringing Greg in as a third more often if the first time went well. Sherlock probed Greg in subtle ways to gauge his interest and, finding his results satisfying, they continued their planning. They talked until they had completely ironed out the details. They were as ready as they could be.
- being able to get close to him. And John’s a patient man. So by the time the universe drops the exact excuse he was looking for into his lap, this desire has been simmering for quite some time.
Greg gives John a somewhat bemused looking smile and says, “It certainly wouldn’t go unappreciated but this is really not necessary...”
John pushes his fingers through the soft curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck as their breathing slow. He smudges a kiss against Sherlock’s temple, and John feels a small answering peck brush against his shoulder.
“I want to see him lose control. He’s a hot blooded man, prone to outbursts. I should know, I’ve been on the receiving end on more than a few of his angry tirades. But he quickly reins himself in before he does anything he’d regret. Cathartic as it might be.”
Their position has multiple benefits, in John's opinion - it frees his hands, gives him access, binds Sherlock’s hands behind him - but it also arouses them both, to see Sherlock putting himself on display for John to use as he wishes.
“If you’re quite done staring,” Sherlock says, gesturing to the door. “I believe you said I could have my way with you.”
At least, not until a case presents them with the opportunity to try out self-defence moves. John’s more excited than he cares to admit at the potential of finally -
John focuses on the arousal that he’s been trying to stave off. He lets himself go, his cock pulsing and spurting as he groans. He presses himself into Sherlock, twitching with endorphins while Sherlock whines around his fingers.
Sherlock, knowing what he needs, angles his head to capture his mouth in a tender kiss. They sigh and hum as their presses of lips go from gentle to passionate to frantic. John can’t handle being still anymore, he needs to move.
“Yeah, ‘oh’.” John grins and kisses him once more. “You can have your way with me but I do need to be able to, I don’t know, do things like work tomorrow and I can’t do that if I’m crippled in the morning.”
The next couple of weeks is a mix of the usual domesticity and Sherlock’s new obsession with getting Greg to join in on their fun. A perfectly quiet afternoon of sipping tea and reading the paper is disrupted when Sherlock asks, “would you like Greg to come in me?”
“Can you handle it, Sherlock? Holding off, not coming until I tell you while I tell Greg to try his best to get you to disobey me? What would make you happier? Breaking the rules, making me punish you and praise Greg right in front of you? Or would you be a good boy for me and control yourself long enough for me to give you permission? Which would be sweeter to you?”
Suddenly, the pressure from both Sherlock’s finger and groin is released and John can breathe again. He realizes that Sherlock has been speaking to him and he forces himself to open his eyes. “What?”
“Add a couple bruises of my own,” John replies with a smile. In one swift move, John pulls Sherlock’s head back to elongate his already long, exposed neck and then he is feasting on the skin on display. Right at the juncture of his neck and shoulder, John worries the skin between his teeth, sucking long and hard. He feels Sherlock move beneath him, rutting upwards to stimulate them both while Sherlock’s freehand clutches at his backside, desperate for release.
He was always gorgeous, always more than a little hazardous but the new muscle makes him seem that little more
But no matter how needy he is, he won't break John's rules about no stimulation for himself - that'd only make John more determined to drag it out longer, stubborn bastard that he is. He's too desperate for that now. He has one fist around the guys cock, covered in his saliva where his lips meet his fingers every time he bobs his head. His other hand has a thumb on the guys perineum, with two fingers buried inside him, moving rapidly over his prostate. He encourages shallow thrusting movements until the guy has his hands in Sherlocks hair, using his grip to anchor Sherlock’s mouth as he fucks his throat. Sherlock actively encourages the guy to choke him, loving that John can hear him moaning and struggling to breathe around the cock in his mouth.
Sherlock’s arousal-deepened voice is stunning but also something about hearing that posh accent swear is disproportionately arousing.
“God, you’d look spectacular, your hands behind your back, his hands in your hair, tuned to his every reaction and every word I say. He’d resist you teasing him, try to thrust, but I’ve forbidden you to let him and you’re so good for me.”
Sherlock’s voice, a weapon in its own right, is devastating when made huskier by arousal. His eyes dart over John, seemingly unable to decide what he wants to look at most.
Then, without anymore hesitation, Sherlock opens his mouth and wraps his lips around the head of Greg’s cock.
“I’m getting no further with what I have here, thanks to the awful photographers the Yard have on staff. Perhaps that might actually help, if you don’t mind, John”
One night while John and Sherlock were cuddling in bed after a very satisfying round of sex, John broached the subject. He cleared his throat, curling his fingers in Sherlock’s hair, and said, “So, Greg’s looking fit these days.”
“You will handle whatever I tell you to handle. Right now, you will handle me getting off, because picturing you on your knees, sucking Greg’s cock just how I tell you, has got me pretty fucking horny.”
John considers that a moment while he tugs Sherlock’s head back to have a taste of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock gasps, squirming against him and seeking friction. John curls his hand around his hip and pushes to roll Sherlock underneath him. Sherlock’s legs come to wrap around him immediately, hips struggling to move.
“No,” John says, pointing a finger in Sherlock’s direction. “You’ve opened your mouth plenty and it is my turn to talk.” Sherlock huffs and closes his mouth, crossing his arms petulantly.
“Such as kissing his gorgeous mouth. Don’t look at me like that, you know how much I love your mouth.” John kisses him to prove it, “ridiculous, pouting lips.” Sherlock seems satisfied and lets him go on. “You keep your face clean shaven but Greg keeps his with a bit of stubble and I think that might be nice.”
As their association - and hesitant friendship - grew, their mutual respect for each other had trumped whatever baser desires they may have had. Even after Greg divorced his cheating wife, Sherlock never made a move. Thoughts of “what if I eventually fuck it up” flitted through his mind every time he considered it. Somewhat unfortunate, but Sherlock could deal. He had The Work, and then John came along and thoroughly occupied his time.
John crawls up and drapes an arm around Sherlocks waist, nosing into the hair at the nape of his neck. Sherlock's voice is a delicious, sated rumble.
… It makes John feel more like they’d be evenly matched if they fought - like John wouldn’t be able to throw him off if Sherlock where to throw him up against something and pin his wrists…
Sherlock sits up and his free hand makes quick work of John’s shirt buttons. His fingers splay across John’s belly, which is pulled taught with the stretch of his body along the floor. He looks at John contemplatively as his palm slides upwards. A glint enters his eye - suddenly the weight is gone from John’s wrists and John’s torso twists up towards Sherlock, wanting contact, wanting to feel Sherlocks skin but he has pulled Johns shirt up his arms before he even has time to process it and its caught around John’s wrists because his cuffs are still buttoned and Sherlock is twisting the fabric and pulling it and -
“What do you think, hmm? Does that sound good? I reckon if we do it right, I can have you both under by the end. Have him sucking me exactly how I want, helping me get you off exactly how I please, while you hold so still for us.”
Sherlock is near tears from pleasure when John finally decides to stop toying with them both and finally asks, "Are you ready, Sherlock? Ready to take my load? Ready to come?"
Sherlock seizes his arms and shoves him toward the stairs. John stumbles upwards, laughing. When they reach the landing, John turns and pulls Sherlock into his arms, walking them backwards into his room. John can’t keep his hands from Sherlock’s skin, can’t resist leaning up to kiss him. Sherlock pulls back, his breathing heavy, and spins John by the shoulders to face his bed before pressing a hand between his shoulder blades. John’s hands move to catch himself on the mattress and Sherlock’s knees hit the floorboards behind him. He doesn’t bother teasing this time - it would seem they were both too keyed up for that. Sherlock’s broad hands pull his cheeks apart and then his tongue is
Both John and Sherlock had noticed Lestrade’s interest in them. It was often subtle, just slight enough that if you were to blink you’d miss it. But there all the same.
“I guess we’ll have to start thinking how to broach this with Greg. Figure out if he’s definitely interested in actually joining us, and not just by the idea of it.”
John is very, very careful not to think about what they’re about to do as they discuss the mechanics. When Sherlock stands before him, shirts slevees rolled to his elbows and ready to begin, John isn’t sure whether to thank his lucky stars or curse them. He doesn’t have time to ponder, because then Sherlock is launching for him. One of Sherlock’s hands clasps John’s left wrist whilst the other exerts pressure on his shoulder and chest, trying to spin him into the wall. Thankfully, while a doctor he did go through Basic Training with the army. His training gives him the perfect opportunity to block the movement and get right up in Sherlock’s face.
"Look at that, look how filthy you are. Dripping in come for me." Sherlock pants, his mouth open and drooling, trying to steady his heart rate. He winces when John pulls his fingers from his hole but the feeling of emptiness is soon soothed when John collects him in his arms. He feels John kiss his temple and whisper against his skin,
Those words from that mouth does John in. He pulls Sherlock’s hips tight against his as one of the strongest orgasms he's had in ages surges like liquid heat from his belly along his spine. He pulls out just before he finishes and works his cock with his hand to stripe Sherlock’s back with the last of his come.
At first, Sherlock was relieved. That meant that while he had a potential card to play with the detective, he knew that Lestrade wouldn’t risk his livelihood on a potential scandal. But, if Sherlock was honest, he had found the detective inspector quite attractive, in return. But in the beginning he didn’t want to be a pity fuck, nor did he want to risk losing his avenue to cases, so he never brought the subject up again.
John slowly, methodically closes the distance between them and bends down so that their faces are level. “I want you to apologize for shouting at Greg today and the countless other times you’ve shouted at him in front of his team. You want to talk about being unprofessional, hmm? You, who goes off like a prima donna whenever someone can’t read your mind?”
because Sherlock’s hand is working on the button of his jeans. John’s raises his hips, desperate, and a grin stretches across Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock is puzzling out bruises and scuff marks, but can’t resolve them in a satisfactory manner to figure out how the suspect managed to escape. He’s at the kitchen table, photographs spread across every inch, when John begins the routine of making tea for both of them - he doesn’t bother asking, anymore. Sherlock will drink it or ignore it, and offering doesn’t give any indication which. He concentrates on pouring and stirring more than usual, to give him something to be feasibly distracted by when he tries to casually bring up the option
He is powerless to move - his hands tied, quite literally - and Sherlock’s knees had his legs just wide enough to keep him slightly off balance.
“And your overdeveloped sense of morality couldn’t possibly let you be attracted to someone you didn’t believe was some kind of white knight on the inside”
John’s spare hand trails across Sherlock’s ribs, playing over skin as it moves down his body. He briefly grips the crest of Sherlocks hip to still their movement, before trailing around to trace what must be maddeningly light touches over Sherlocks balls.
John pulls away long enough to deliver a playful spank and bite the skin where his thigh meets his arse cheek.
And John pushes right into a punishing rhythm, moving one hand to grip Sherlock’s hip to control his rocking. Sherlock tries to match John's movement, but John isn't about to let him - this is about John owning Sherlock.
"That was brilliant." John presses another kiss to the space beneath his ear and asks, "shower? Dinner?"
“Are you ready for your turn?" Sherlock can't say yes fast enough and it makes John chuckle. He leans down to whisper in Sherlock’s ear "You don't come until I say so. You need to be reminded of your place."
He’s escorted from the room and offered a drink as he puts on his shoes. While he’s almost sad it’s over, it’s a memory he’s going to treasure as prime wanking material for a very long time. He knows that, given half a chance, he’d come right back to do this again.
Sherlock is torn. the sooner he gets the man he’s blowing to come, the sooner John will fuck him. But the longer he draws it out, the higher the likelihood that John will cave and fuck him while he’s mid-blowjob. It’s no contest which option prefers, really. If he can prod John’s possessive, jealous side just enough, he might be able to provoke the deliciously primal side of John that Sherlock so greatly enjoys.
“That’s a lot of questions in one go. Can’t do anything at a reasonable pace, can you?” In reality, John was playing for a little bit of time to form a coherent answer- those words had prompted way too many images all in one go.
Greg gasps a little at that, noting the bulge in Sherlocks trousers, but equally, how well he remains on his knees, waiting.
Sherlock isn’t having that though. He seizes Johns wrists and pulls them above his head, stretching John into one long line of arousal before his mouth is on Johns and then
When he’s finally allowed to come, Sherlock takes the first burst into his mouth before pulling off and taking the condom with him, allowing the rest to paint his neck and chest. He hears Sherlock whimper as a stripe lands across his clavicle, and it sounds like relief.
Sherlock settles next to John, an arm thrown over his stomach where he trails his fingers through John’s come.
"Look at you, so wanton, so needy. Your muscles are clenching around my fingers so hard, trying to swallow me. Don't worry, you'll have me," he promises as he fucks Sherlock with his fingers, stretching him to take his cock.
Sherlock's cheeks flame with embarrassment, wanting desperately to say he needs John's fingers and cock as well as his tongue, his own tongue dry with the desire to speak but struggling to do so. He knows full well that John is toying with him by asking. And he also knows that John won't continue until he's made his wishes clear.
If he hadn't just had a rather spectacular orgasm, that would have made him hard all over again. But the night is young. He dragged himself away from Sherlock’s warm, soiled skin. He places one knee on the bed as Sherlock hitches a leg upwards. John allowed himself to press his fingertip against Sherlocks hole, still gaping slightly and with a small line of come dribbling from the centre, taking in the erotic sight for future enjoyment. Having looked his fill, he gently presses the plug in, savouring Sherlock’s gasp as the widest part breaches his surely sensitive rim. They both moan a little when it settles into place.
Greg turns back to Sherlock and nods jerkily, wordlessly. Sherlock deftly undoes his belt and opens his fly, then palms Greg’s burgeoning erection through his pants, urging it to harden further. Greg can’t look away, his mouth agape and mind reeling. He can’t help but wonder-
John doesn’t have to ask twice. There are three fingers now and there is a burning stretch that feels spectacular. John’s erection is positively dripping into the sheets, the foreskin pulled back and the plummy head brushing against the sheets and it is
Sherlock nods, agreeing. “When you’ve let your face go a bit scruffy it does leave a unique sensation behind after kissing me.”
“Oh god,” Greg groans, hands grasping John’s shoulders as he finally lets go. His hips pump and twitch with pleasure as he fills Sherlock’s mouth. Suddenly, Sherlock’s hands are there, grabbing his thighs to hold him still while he suckles down every drop of his release until he’s shivering with oversensitivity. He pulls off with an obscene pop and looks up at the two men over him, licking his lips. He carefully tuck Greg away, before resting his hands on his thighs, where his fingers clench fretfully. He looks up to John, who is smiling down at him.
“It’s good, isn’t it? He’s such a good little cocksucker.” He pets Sherlock’s head again and Sherlock visibly shivers. “Aren’t you Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s hands fly to John’s hips, holding him steady as John struggles to breathe normally. The stretch is
In the interest of science, John allows some of Sherlock’s blow to land on his torso and his back and he allows some of his kicks to hit his legs. He manages to pin Sherlock’s arms above his head, back firmly pressed into the floor and John thinks he’s got him beat. Due to the position John holds him in, his struggling pulls the muscles in his neck taut and Sherlock bares his teeth in effort as he tries to wriggle free.
him, rid his mind of everything that wasn’t John. John took great pride and pleasure at being the only one to give that to Sherlock, in being the only one who could take him apart so completely. In this one aspect of their lives, John was in charge.
At first touch, both Sherlock and Greg groan. Greg shoves his fist in his mouth to quiet himself, but he can’t muffle himself entirely. “
The noises Sherlock is making have started rising in pitch, his jaw falling open as he gasps for air. John rocks up onto his knees to free the arm he’d been using for balance. While his left hand works over their cocks, he presses three fingers from his right against Sherlocks mouth.
Sherlock is sweating now and John becomes distracted watching a bead of perspiration roll down from Sherlock’s hairline to his neck. It proves just enough of a distraction that Sherlock’s able to raise his hips enough to unsettle John and in a second John ends up flat on his back.
“And I’ll bet going to your knees and earning back his good favour is an attractive idea, when he’s been furious with you. I bet part of you has been desperate to keep pushing, to make him snap and pull you back into line.”
Nonsense encouragements fall from Johns mouth. Later, he couldn’t have told you what he said if his life depended upon it. He feels like crying when Sherlock pulls his mouth away. One of his hands leave John’s skin and then there is the tell-tale scrape of the drawer in his bedside table. Because of course he didn’t need to ask where the lube was.
But John’s advantage doesn’t last for long. Sherlock’s fingers slide down John’s ass, ghosting over his hole. John’s distraction allows him to shift backwards and sit up, pulling John’s hips close to his own in his lap. John forgets about proving a point and sets about undoing Sherlock’s straining shirt buttons instead as his hips roll his erection along Sherlock’s. Their kisses turn biting, teeth involved almost as much as tongue. John leaves Sherlock’s shirt on after he reaches the last button, moving to the placket of Sherlock’s trousers. The angle is awkward, leaving little room for his hand between their hips but then John has a delicious handful of Sherlock’s weeping hardness
The thought of being so thoroughly used by two men, at John's behest, makes Sherlock impossibly harder. He groans as John's hand tightens in his hair to emphasize the point.
“When I come, you can come. I want you to feel what you’ve done to me. Are you ready? I’m so close, so ready for you to feel it, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s eyes close briefly, as he seemingly basks in the praise. John cards a hand through his hair, and smiles encouragingly at Greg, nodding his head downwards. Greg dares to do the same, and Sherlock’s eyes open. He smiles up at them, before biting his lip. His knees move restlessly against the carpet, and his fingers are scratching against the fabric of his trousers. Greg looks up to John, who is smiling knowingly.
Sherlock is looking a bit dazed, his bottom lip caught between his teeth as his hips start hesitant, hitching movements against John’s leg. John uses his hold on Sherlock's hair to pull his mouth closer to his own, to breathe his next words across Sherlocks lips.
Sherlock’s mouth is hot, wet, and John can feel his moans vibrating across his fingers as Sherlock’s tongue sweeps over his fingertips. The noises he’s making send shivers of pleasure that course through him. The warm slick of Sherlock’s mouth makes John stroke them faster, driving towards their climax.
Sherlock's legs shake with the effort of keeping himself up when all he wants to do is melt into the bed. His fingers clench tightly into the meat of his cheeks, determined to keep them parted so John can have his way. He practically drools into the duvet, his mouth unable to close due to the noises he makes.
. John smooths his hand down the crown of Sherlock’s head to his neck (pausing briefly at his hickey) before sliding down to Sherlock’s exposed chest to push back the fabric even further.
“Excellent,” John says, leaning in to kiss him once more. After pulling back he says, “let us leave first. Sherlock will look properly abashed,” he gives Sherlock a cheeky grin, “and you can follow once you’ve caught your breath. Meet us downstairs, we’ll get a cab together.”
“I’ve been wanting this too, you know,” Sherlock confesses, letting his lips brush teasingly against John’s hot skin.
Sherlock’s tongue had coaxed the muscle into relaxing so it wasn’t long before a second finger presses in alongside the first. John knew those nimble violinists fingers would be devastating inside him and he internally gloats that he’s right. Then they twist
He releases Sherlock’s hair and he relaxes even further, almost melting into the floor. His dazed eyes stare up at him with pure, unadulterated
He transfers both John’s wrists into one of his large hands before curling the other under John’s chin. John trembles with anticipation, allowing Sherlock to manipulate him in any way he damn well pleases. He noses along his jaw to John’s ear, making him shiver and he deeply inhales John’s scent.
Sherlock tensed. John forced himself not to stay relaxed as Sherlock slowly lifted his cheek off John’s chest. “Yes. He is.” He rested his chin on John’s sternum and narrowed his eyes, trying to suss out what John was really trying to say.
John let a sly grin slowly spread across his face. “Couldn’t make my mind up if I wanted to stay there and keep watching or go over and get involved, to be honest.”
“We both know we wouldn’t proceed without consent. He just needs to want it more than he wants to be a ‘gentleman’.”
erection. With his arms stretched above him and Sherlock’s weight holding him down John feels deliciously tight and warm in his own skin.
John wants to give Sherlock the same treatment, wants to tease him into a desperate frenzy but John is so aroused he can barely see straight. He leans down and licks along that ridiculous cupids bow, which parts and then Sherlock’s tongue, which had been winding John up so thoroughly only moments before, is sliding along John’s own. John seizes a fistful of Sherlock’s hair, tipping his head to the side to expose that sensual stretch of neck. A decadently wanton moan gives John pause.
and his eyes leave John’s to sweep down to John’s mouth. John tries to lean up, tries to close the gap and land the kiss he’d been fantasizing about for
John looks up to Sherlock – of course he’d know what John was thinking. And John would trust Sherlock with his life – has done, in the past. It’s enough for his lust-addled brain, and he reaches between his legs to position Sherlock’s cock into his loosened hole.
Sherlock pulls back and John can see the moment his eyes focus on the undoubtedly livid mark - his lip curls and a growl works its way out of his chest before he swoops down to work a matching bruise into the other side of John’s neck.
Sherlock is right, he is going to ruin him. He will never be the same again. But John doesn’t care one whit about that so long as it ends with an orgasm and Sherlock keeping him. He will never want to be without this.
John can only stare, heart beating in his throat and loins as Sherlock makes him wait for his next move. Sherlock’s eyes lazily travel between the matching bruises on his neck before slowly sliding from his lips to his collarbone. Sherlock takes his free hand and gently places it on his clavicle, grin growing wider at John’s sudden intake of breath.
John’s eyes close automatically, enjoying the shiver of lust that crept down his back. “I want that too. But not here.” When Sherlock opens his mouth to protest, John silences it with a finger to his lips. “We are going to do this the right way or not at all. Which means with proper lube, which I know I have in my room.”
Sherlock’s hand wraps around him and it only takes three strokes before John is seeing stars. His eyes clench so tight as his cock begins to pulse and spurt all over his stomach and Sherlock’s fingers.
Sherlock’s lip quirks, but the pensive expression doesn’t quite leave his face. John presses a kiss into Sherlock’s hair and adds more seriously, “Greg’s a responsible, effective leader. But I think he’s like you - he spends his life trying to keep things under control, and he needs a chance to cede that to someone else. He follows your lead when you’re not winding him up too badly. He’s also a deeply respectful person - he’d never try to upset our working dynamic.”
“Yes, yes I know. How about I start with the the last one. Hmmm?” John pauses, trying to find a way to articulate his complex feelings for the Detective Inspector. “He’s a great man - he’s got a good heart, and he always does what is right.”
Sherlock cries, hips finally slowing as he comes. He rolls his hips, drawing out his own orgasm as he empties himself into John. His groan is low, long, loud, and it makes John’s cock give an overachieving twitch. Finally, when he’s done, John pulls him down to kiss him soundly.
There’s an indignant huff from behind him, but Sherlock stands and starts shoving furniture around to clear space in the living room.
He leans down to brush a kiss at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “You know, your smart mouth always gets you into some
For John, it took a little longer to cotton on. About four months after he moved in to 221B, he and Lestrade were out at the pub watching football when John felt his stare. It seemed a few drinks in and Lestrade was less likely to try and hide his well-buried bisexuality. John, in love with Sherlock and also struggling with his own identity crisis, never made a move. But, he did start noticing things. Glances at Sherlock- at him, when it seemed they weren’t looking. How broad Lestrade’s shoulders were, or the strong line of his jaw. How handsome his pleased grin is. It would have been so easy to experiment, to confirm his sexuality, by giving in to their less-than-sober flirtations. But John wasn’t a total dick. He would never take the chance of hurting Lestrade just to satisfy his own curiosity.
“My interests are,” Sherlock pauses, gathering his thoughts, “scientific. Carnal. Centered mostly on his cock, mouth, and hands.”
Sherlock seems to enjoy that idea. An intrigued purr, a hum, comes from pursed lips as he settles himself more comfortably against John’s side. “And how, pray tell, would you get involved?”
“And it seems that our good detective is clean of all nasty diseases. As are you and I. Which begs the question: do you want him to come in me?”
Greg, trying to shrug off his irritation exhales sharply out of his nose. “Apparently.” He gives Sherlock an angry side-eyed glance. “Nothing out of the ordinary.” Sherlock stares right back but keeps his mouth shut.
“If there’s nothing obvious in the evidence you’ve got, I don’t mind trying out some options with you, if that would help.”
Those words go straight to John's dick, have him twitching with unfettered need. Without further talk, he reaches for the lube that's been staring them down from the nightstand. He lubes up his fingers with haste and slides two fingers into Sherlock's saliva soaked hole. The abrupt burn from the stretch has Sherlock crying out, stuck between the desire to fuck onto John's fingers and pull away from the assault. His internal conflict has him shifting his hips, willing his muscles to accommodate John's fingers.
Without a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock comes. His body goes taut, legs clenching around John’s waist as he tries not to bite down on John’s fingers. John strokes him through it, letting him go once his cock is spent.
John’s body is thrumming, electrified, terrified, thrilled, overwhelmed. His eyes are watering. Even without this, without the threat of Moriarty, the trial, the kidnappings, everything, John knows, and maybe has known since the beginning,
“Greg please I need to talk to you.” John’s eyes are wide with fear and Lestrade opens his mouth to reply, glancing at the detective who’s watching anxiously on the sidewalk. “Please.” John’s pleading and Lestrade snaps at Sherlock.
“I don’t have friends” And John is really going to hit him- “I’ve just got one” and John’s body seems to uncoil a bit when he sees the nervous schoolboy glances Sherlock’s throwing between John and the ground. It’s such a vulnerable look on the detective.
There’s a crack. It’s deafening, it has to be because John can’t hear anything. He’s lost his hearing. Everything is buzzing. There’s a crack, the earth splitting, the heavens breaking, his chest is splintered. Everything is white noise, muddled and indistinct. He’s being blinded, too because he can’t see anything but the bloodied figure in front of him and even that’s fading away, like a fog settling on everything. His words are slurred, he can hardly walk. There’s a pain spreading across his body, it’s like he’s being shot all over again except he feels it in every extremity and every organ.  Everything’s so cloudy and unreal, the only thing he’s sure of is the still-warm skin of Sherlock’s wrist in his grip.
“Seriously, you’re a mess. Go take a shower.” Greg plants a warm kiss on John’s forehead that makes his chest ache.  His smile makes John weak because it’s so big and earnest and lovely and he could cry for the cruelty of it. John smiles back in that moment.
John is fighting the taunts.  Adler knows and she’s baiting him and he’d care more if he had any embarrassment left. He’s confused by the mixed signals Sherlock’s been giving him but he’s always confused by the man. He’s always hard to understand by almost everyone. John refuses to give himself any false pretenses that Sherlock cares for him more than just a best friend because he thinks it could be anything more and he’s wrong….it’s unthinkable. This has to be enough for him.
“Sherlock, listen…”He squeezes his arms between their bodies, hands flat on Sherlock’s chest trying to put some space between them. He swears he can feel the beginnings of an erection against his thigh and it’s making him weak in the knees. He pushes against the detective, hard. He barely gets a couple of centimeters between them before the Alpha is snarling. He grabs ahold of the smaller man’s arms and pins them to his side while latching on to his neck. He’s got the skin above the omega’s gland tight between his teeth. The harsh noise coming from him is clear: Submit.
The mention of Sherlock makes his insides twist painfully. He shivers a bit in Greg’s embrace and he hopes to play it off as anticipation instead of guilt. He gives a petulant grumble
“He’s not using me. We are just friends, not that I have to explain myself to you because this is over.” He pushes the door open, “you can leave now, thank you.”
Growling low in his throat, Sherlock pushes the blond onto his back. He’s able to deepen the kiss, rough and strong. John is scrambling at the smooth chest in front of him; trying to pull him closer in a desperate attempt at more contact all while he sucks at the detective’s bottom lip.
Sherlock sits, only half-studying the barbules of the feather in the lens now. He tries to scent the air for John, and catches only that normal
The tension between the two of them since Sherlock’s return was choking him and over their tired dinner in the den of two-two-one B Sherlock could feel a new dynamic shifting beneath the surface. He couldn’t pick a name for it. If he’d been anyone else he’d pick awkwardness, nerves, or the angst of unrequited love. But he’s not anyone else and all Sherlock knows is that he simultaneously wants to fuck the man in front of him senseless and run away as though nothing has changed: pretend that his best friend, his
“You could have just called Mrs. Hudson for help.” Sherlock tried to keep his voice soft but the words sounded tense in his own ears. It’s bad enough he’d done this John, he didn’t need the man hurting himself on top of it. When John stayed silent, head bowed slightly, he let out a frustrated growl and pulled him toward a chair, forcing the doctor to sit while he went to grab a first aid kit.
The detective straightens in his chair immediately, poised like he’s ready for a fight, “What? Why?”
Those aren’t the kinds of words you can take back because you were caught in a moment of misplaced aggression. Sherlock wouldn’t excuse it just because John was too emotional to be rational at the time.
He’s trying not to show how much it affects him, but he’s never been very good at schooling his facial expressions, and it’s obvious the detective notices when he wraps one of his hands around John’s smaller ones. John doesn’t share the same faith in his abilities, but Sherlock’s tone makes him want to.
“What are you doing out here? Come upstairs. Hurry up. I don’t have all day.” Sherlock dragged John into the foyer, letting go right before bounding up the stairs to the flat.
“How am I supposed to write on the blog? I never go on cases anymore.” He’s seething a bit, he knows, but he’s stir-crazy and frustrated, “Nothing happens to me anymore.”
A knee slips between John’s knee and presses torturously against the erection growing in his jeans. He gasps obscenely and throws his head back, stars smattering his vision when Sherlock grinds against his crotch, frotting like a teenager. John’s grabbing at his silk shirt, trying to pull at buttons and he’s gotten about half way down when he feels pulling at his belt buckle and a rush of cold air hitting his hips.
He slowed as he walked into the den and found John at his laptop with Mycroft draped over his shoulder talking to him about something on the screen. He watched as John smirked at something the older man had said, something Sherlock had missed.
“Mrs. Hudson was worried about you, she implied you be in some amount of…discomfort when you awake. I assumed you’d want to retain some modesty between you and our landlady so I volunteered to assist you.” Sherlock’s shifting a bit nervously in his seat on the edge of John’s bed as he returns to washcloth to the water, “I worked out that you’d prefer me than her to see you like this.” After gesturing vaguely and John’s person, he suddenly becomes very aware of the state he’s in.
“I’ll have to tranq him, you know. If I try to approach him, he’ll go feral and think I’m challenging him.” It’s required for officers to carry tranquilizers along with their firearms because it’s not too uncommon to come across feral alphas that would be too difficult to subdue without serious injury.
“Lose the attitude you little shit. Oi! Donovan, he’s saying whoever took him out too John with them.”
scared. He can’t afford to be scared because being scared meant seeing John as this fragile thing, something the ex-army doctor would protest greatly.
John’s shaking and whimpering a bit in the embrace but he doesn’t look like he’s trying to fight. This could get real messy real fast and Lestrade knows he’s going to need to tread lightly. He’s not dealing with Sherlock much at this point, but an alpha with an omega in heat within his reach. The pheromones in the air don’t have quite the same effect on Lestrade, he’s an alpha that’s been bonded before and he’s got a stronger hold of his instincts. He just needs to snap Sherlock out of it.
Stimulation to the area makes the endocrine gland pool with the hormones. One of nature’s clever invention, it produces a fake heat that doesn’t release in ovum but allows a bond to happen when time is of the essence. Normally it lasts from about six hours to a full day depending on the age of the omega. The older the omega, the longer it lasts and John’s not exactly young, pushing his mid-thirties. His body is desperate to be mated even when he isn’t and if this man triggers the bonding heat, he knows he won’t so much as struggle.
!” A harsh scrape of horsehair on taut strings makes John wince. Sherlock is testily storming around the desk, taking care to place his violin gently in the case. John stares, wondering at the reason for the outburst.  Frustrated hands rake through the riot of dark curls, before being thrown exasperatedly away at his sides. “I’m not
‘Nothing’ is incorrect. He saw grey and white and strange smudgy colors. He didn’t see the pained expression on Sherlock’s face.
Sorry this took so long! I got distracted by some side projects, so keep an eye open for those. Editing will happen when it happens.
bastard” The small laugh in John’s voice betrays his anger and Sherlock’s mouth quirks up in the corners.
“I tell you exactly what occurs on each of my cases. Transcribe them. Post them. I’m sure the drooling masses have missed it.”
“You just like talking about ash” John rolled his eyes but grinned anyway. Sherlock probably doesn’t even realize what he’s doing: trying to comfort John before his procedure. “Show- off”.
unbonded omega scent. So, no signs of a heat creeping up and no illness. John’s always been expressive and, even when he tried, thoroughly unsuccessful in hiding his emotions but the whiplash mood shifts are more Sherlock’s thing than John’s. Maybe it’s just a hormonal phenomenon, or maybe it’s just a new side of John developing.
Ah. This question gets a reaction. Sherlock tightens an arm around John’s waist pulling him in close and Lestrade’s eyes snap up to his rear-view mirror to make eye contact with John.
He could have had it too, if John had let him in last night. Instead he had Lestrade sedate him. The idea that his omega had trusted another alpha has something snarling in the back of his mind. Realizing that John had felt unsafe with Sherlock in his vulnerable state causes something ugly to simmer in his ribcage; a sensation he can’t name but wants gone all the same.
“Of course, Doctor Watson.” The greying man focuses on the task at hand, deft fingers twisting at the dials and lights as though the interruption never happened. “But you know, from where I was sitting it appeared your friend wasn’t bored. He looked nervous.” He’s muttering to John as he pulls out some more equipment. John can hear the clinking as he gets it in place. “During examinations, we keep the room mostly dark so I can use the tools in here more effectively. It lets me see more than most doctors because when the lights dim people seem to have an immediate reaction. They drop their faces, completely unaware of it, usually.” John is silent, listening. He was a surgeon, then a GP. He’s unfamiliar with the environment this ophthalmologist works in.
John loves Sherlock, trusts him so implicitly, like he never thought he could even trust someone. But he doesn’t know how Sherlock feels about him. This makes him so open and vulnerable and there’s a good chance this could end in total heartbreak.
The guilt would be better if there was someone to chase and find and kill but the men responsible are in custody and aren’t coming out anytime soon.
There’s a moment like a movie, when things are just lovely and Greg wishes he could thank God himself for the beauty of his life and his amazing partner. He’s not much for poetry but he swears the angels have given him more than he’s worth, after the stress of his job, the pain of his divorce and the guilt of sending Holmes to his death. And like a movie, it has to end. The credits are rolling and he has to deal with the real world: marked and muddled like the spot high on John’s shoulder. An ugly purple red bruise, an obvious bite mark. It’s not one he’s left, and despite the regular insults he receives on behalf of the world’s only consulting detective he can determine the perpetrator from a single glance: Sherlock Holmes.
“Mycroft?” John’s voice cracked slightly but it was obvious he was trying to hide the fact that he’d been crying.
But how can he do that now? Now that his army doctor can neither see nor observe? John can’t even offer his medical opinions on corpses anymore. He can’t help in the chases and shoot-outs. Even shifting through crime scene photographs and case files are now solo activities.
“Well, I can't see it, can I?!” John’s angry at his shortcomings, his inability to keep up with Sherlock.
He runs a hand over his exhausted face. He thought Jeanette might actually be a long-term thing, or at least a good couple of heats but her obviously archaic way of thinking was too much. John lets out a hysteric laugh at the way she insinuated Sherlock had been mistreating him in some way. Surely there has to be one willing alpha in the greater London area who finds John worth their time-
By the time he made into the living room, Sherlock was already draped across his armchair. “When will you be moving back in, then?”
“It’s amazing Sherlock, this program helps me write and use the internet by speaking to it and it can read things back to me. It’s quite impressive.”
Eventually, everything settles. Breathing patterns are returning to near normal and Sherlock’s orgasms are coming further and further apart. John opens his eyes, he doesn’t even remember closing them, and stares at the gorgeous alpha above him. Sherlock is just barely keeping his head up, energy drained, and John gives him a sloppy, exhausted grin. He musters the energy to lift his head up when he feels a horrible ache on his neck. With a small gasp, he runs his hand along the tender area and feels the painful wound. His hand comes away with flecks of blood; matching the droplets John’s now noticing decorate the corners of Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock noticed the slight tremor of his friend’s hand. He wondered if the limp would return as well.
John voice is quiet and raw. He stares at his hands, covered in blood and gravel, “Where…where are we?”
John can only stare because they’re words he wants, but not what he’d ever expected, to hear. It’s painful to love someone who doesn’t want him but he’d accepted that a while ago, deciding he’d rather have whatever he can get. If he can only have Sherlock as a friend and a flatmate, that’s fine, because it’s better than not having him at all. It’s so tempting to let those words burrow into his heart and fill him with warm hope but John’s pragmatic so he lets out a low disbelieving chuckle.
articulate, “but I’ll always miss the color of your eyes.” John’s trying so hard to let Sherlock in and let all the pain out but it’s hard. His heart feels stiff and underused like relaxing his hand after a death grip on his old life.
Sherlock ignored the protests while his attention shifted to John’s foot. There was a slight gash on the side of the right one where he’d stepped on a sharp chunk of broken mug, and that’s when Sherlock noticed the mismatched socks. Coming in to see the mess on the floor he’d not paid attention to the man’s clothing.
There were the small things that Sherlock is doing that John hardly notices. Crowding John, away from wandering eyes and potential danger, keeping the flat warm, pulling John out to dinner more often but not dragging him out more than necessary…a voice in the back of the most basic parts of Sherlock’s brain is driving him. Sherlock is painstakingly aware of his actions, despite John’s average level of obtuseness. He knows what he’s doing but he can’t stop himself, physically cannot keep his hands from serving John a little more at meals or wrapping John’s scarf just a little tighter around his delicate throat. Although Sherlock himself finds it hard to relax, too keen to protect the small omega from predators, he still had enough time in the day to hate his stupid biology for the distractions.
This story will have 5 chapters, and I'm working on completing and editing the last two chapters while trying to finish Time Waits for No One and The Blind Blogger.
John’s panting against the detective’s throat, wet puffs of air against the pale column of skin. John’s denim-clad legs squeezing the slim hips and he’s mortified at his actions. More than embarrassment is a churning shame. He wished he’d at least had a couple more beers so he could blame it on the alcohol. There’s no way he’ll be able to explain why he’s currently straddling and snogging Sherlock Holmes to his (
Those beautiful blue eyes are so open, dampened with tears, honest. Sherlock is nearly stunned by the display. His lungs have nearly stopped in his chest. John Watson is trusting him so completely, he’s given him his beating bloody heart to have. John has done something no substance or mystery on earth could accomplish: he’s stopped Sherlock Holmes’ mind. He can’t think. He’s stuck on the beautiful creature in front of him.
Sherlock saw John arrive, watched him take the steps across pavement in front of Speedy’s, and take the short steps up to the door. John’s early morning presence was… a surprise because Sherlock had decided it would be days before John spoke to him again after what happened yesterday. It’s also shocking because Sherlock planned that when John did show up on the doorstep again, he would have his bags with him, announcing his return to their flat.
It was only supposed to be a walk. Sherlock just wanted to see the area where the suspect was living; he was looking for some kind of soil to support his theory. John didn’t care that they were only out to look for some dirt (literally), he so rarely got to do something different from his routine he welcomed the excursion.
Opting to stick to nonchalance, John goes for, “Well you know, brush with death, stress, adrenalin…it’s normal. I saw it all the time in the army. A threat from a strange alpha triggered your hormones which in turn triggered mine.” With a shrug of his shoulders he says, “Nothing much to talk about, really.” God he knows how unconvincing he sounds and it's pathetic.
Sherlock feels the small man tense in his lap. He’s rigid beneath his hands but it’s not regret for his actions it’s….embarrassment?  What does he have to be embarrassed about? He’s done what others have failed to do. Sherlock Holmes is undoubtedly, undeniably in
the inspector either I see.” Sherlock has to be happy with just a taste. Whatever he gets… but he’d been away for so long. “I thought maybe I could have fixed everything –“He clears his throat a bit, his airway feels a bit sandpaper-y, “I thought you wanted this too.”
It’s a pitiful sound that has Greg tearing his lips away.  “Hey..” He’s looking, concerned, into John’s face. John doesn’t remember closing his eyes but he suddenly realizing the fervor with which he’s squeezing them shut. He’s afraid Greg knows, somehow, and he’ll see it in his face. He can’t respond, too afraid of what will come out. “John, are you okay?”
The tickling lightness in his chest contracted into a painful vise around his rib cage as the weight of what he had done fell on him. He couldn’t tell Greg, and he wouldn’t. Greg’s had an unfaithful partner once before, and though it didn’t make him cynical, John couldn’t do that to him again.
Before the implications fully hit him, the warmth is gone, backing away and disappearing into the room at the end of the hall with a soft ‘
Okay I wrote this chapter while listening to Wrecking Ball and Sun on Sunday on loop so that's why it's such a hot mess.
John can’t help but feel bad at how he snapped at Sherlock. How could he confuse nervous fidgeting with the detectives bored sulking? He can read Sherlock better than anyone, yet he made such a glaring error. An almost complete stranger was able to point out the differences.
“There was a big one, blond buzz cut and big arms. He was the boss, I think.” John’s knows he’s still out there. He looks towards Sherlock, “He’s the one working for Moriarty. Kept calling him ‘Jim’. Said we were funny to him.”
“Sherlock…” There’s an audible gulp as John tries to steady his voice, “There’s a mass-murderer on the loose.” A particularly wicked nip to the sensitive patch on his neck makes his knees buckles. Sherlock’s strong arms around his waist pull him in closer and tighter and he can barely breathe through the pheromones in the air. “This- ah, this is not the best time.”
Just the sound of Sherlock’s voice grates on John nerves and he can’t tell if it’s the anxiety of the possible outcomes from this appointment or the stress of a smothering partner.
Lestrade waits for Sherlock’s eyes to clear a bit before approaching again. “We’ll get you guys back to Baker Street, but you have to promise to get him checked out, okay?”
“John, even if this doesn’t work, it doesn’t change anything: not how we operate and not the work. Even without sight you still have four perfectly…” Sherlock stumbles for a word as John looks at him, a stormy pout on his face, “
but definitely safe looking) dining table: microscope, notebook, and slides lined up in front of him. Briefly he wonders what the experiment is about and if it has to do with Moriarty.  Judging from the strange feather assortment in front of them man, he’s doubting it’s any more than recreational research. John doesn’t see any dead birds laying around which leaves him to wonder where Sherlock even got the feathers from. If his stomach wasn’t knotted with anxiety, he’d laugh at the mental image of the tall brunet chasing pigeons in the streets to collect samples.
The one on the floor is glaring at John through the blood streaming down his face. John’s about to start firing off warning shots when the blond alpha starts chuckling around his cigarette. He’s laughing at John, the man pointing a gun at him, and he’s confused. Before he can focus Scotty is tackling him, hard, onto the cement ground. The gun goes off, firing a bullet uselessly into a pile of boxes in the corner. The guy drives his fist into his face hard and John tastes blood. The gun skitters away but John doesn’t see where.
“Smell?,” Sherlock growls softly as John tries to put space between them. He pushes himself away a few more centimeters in a very mature huff. “Sherlock, what exactly do I smell like?”
The blond laves the area where he’s broken skin with his tongue and John hisses at the sting, “Funs over then. I better run before Holmes and his dogs get here.” He lowers the omega gently to the ground but John barely notices a thing beyond his swimming mind and thrumming body. The sudden rush of chemicals in his bloodstream is a shock to the system. He feels a hand pat his head a few times, like a dog, and suddenly he’s feeling too cold without another body pressed against his. “Maybe some other time Watson.”
When he turns down Baker Street and sees the ominous black sedan parked along the curb, he hastens to the door of 221 and flies up the steps to his home. Mycroft’s presence unsettles him, particularly because Sherlock knows the power his brother has. The politician could easily take John away from him and there was not much the detective could do without hurting his doctor. His threat during their last exchange could have been a bluff but it wasn’t worth the risk. He doesn’t ever want to risk John again.
John feels like a lovesick teenager being rejected by his crush. He’s well into his thirties and he knows when someone is not interested.
The throbbing between his legs is becoming insistent and when he tries to get some friction against Sherlock’s hips, the brunet pushes his hips down and chuckles. The smug bastard prowls back up towards John’s face for a breathtaking snog. Fingers hooked in the waistband of John’s modest briefs, Sherlock breaks away to look his best friend in the eye.
For a moment a terrifying thought enters John’s mind: if he could have seen he would have been able to differentiate. He can’t even understand the man he loves anymore. Something else he lost because of these fucking eyes. For a moment he’s mad at his own incompetence, his inability to still be Sherlock’s assistant, partner, or friend. He’s dragging the whirlwind detective down.  Then the anger clears. He’s not mad at himself. It’s Sherlock, treating him like a wounded pet. It’s Sherlock handling him like he’s made of spun sugar.
John stared, a bit slack-jawed at the man rambling in front of him. He’s never seen Sherlock so…flustered. It’s a bit unnerving, if comical, really. He’s too shocked to notice that Sherlock’s barrage has trailed off awkwardly and they are both just staring at each other, John shocked and Sherlock wide-eyed and more insecure than John has ever seen him.
Lestrade lets out a pitying sigh and runs the hand not holding John up through his greying hair. “Yeah, yeah, I’ll help you.”
He can’t take it anymore. The two of them won’t survive acting so out of character: John like a delicate piece and Sherlock like a doting caregiver.
Even now, splayed out beneath the older man, hands resting up by his ears, fists gathering the duvet in a vice, they’re equals. The strong fingers in his arse are scissoring at an even pace that betrays the urgency John feels. He doesn’t remember when he started  thrusting his hips back desperately but he lets out a low moan when Greg withdraws. He wonders for a moment, what he must look like, debauched and writhing on the warm bed.  Judging by Greg’s hooded eyes and heaving chest he must look pretty fuckable and he wraps his legs around his waist to pull him in close, the bulging head of his cock brushing John’s sensitive hole.
He grabs Greg’s body wash, a rich minty scent that reminds him of the man he loves in the other room. It foams between his calloused fingers and he needs everything his mind has come to associate with that scent. The smell of home and safety, the things Sherlock could never offer him.
As he watched John dress for bed, and sink onto the pillows, Greg’s mind raced. The presence of Sherlock Holmes ushered self-doubt into his core. Sherlock took control of every crime scene, and every case, and it was more than annoying, but a bruised ego was nothing so long as justice was served.  But now Greg stood to lose something
Not because he needs to mark John, not because John needs an Alpha’s protection, and not because of some other person trying to steal away his amazing-fantastic-brave John. He’s here because he decided to play around with a psychopath and his best friend got caught up in the crossfire.
Just so you're aware A Scandal on Baker Street was only supposed to be one chapter but I wrote it and it was just wayyyyy to long to post as one chapter so I split it into three different parts.
“- doubt, John. I’ve never doubted myself, my senses. Now, I’m doubting, and not just this ‘hound’ but everything –
That savagery is so against Greg’s nature, he’s a fool for thinking his loving boyfriend capable of it. Greg pushes their lips together softly as he trails a hand tauntingly across sensitive pectorals and John’s softening stomach. He skirts around John’s flushed cock and scratches along his inner thigh.
He wants to give in, and it’s an increasing possibility as he feels Sherlock begin to give light licks to his chin and neck, but he remembers everything Sherlock’s said about bonding. Sherlock doesn’t want to bond. He’s made it known on several occasions how cumbersome the entire thing is. How a mate would only get in the way of the Work, his only true passion – and John starts to feel humiliated by his own desperation. If he lets this go any further than flatmate’s, best friends, and then Sherlock will hate him come morning and normal brain function.
and this is all he’s wanted, John warm and solid in his lap, pliant against his lips. Gods, why did he ever wait so long to do this? John’s moaning into his mouth and Sherlock’s mind is screaming at him:
pointed at him. He was in the snipers crosshairs. The anger of someone touching his blogger, of someone threatening what’s his makes his instincts surge. Sherlock is supposed to keep his omega safe. He failed. He needs to prove he can provide. He can be a good mate and he needs the omega to see that.
Silence sits between the two while Mycroft watches his brother shift through his limited emotional database.
The first time they had sex since the accident, it was messy and awkward. John kept missing Sherlock’s mouth and he head butted him a couple times. It was nothing like the fast-paced, adrenaline-spurred, passion they had before. It was gentle and careful and beautiful in its own way.
“You should know why, if you feel for John like you say you do. Give John what he needs instead of what you think he should need.”
Sorry for the confusing alternating POV's but I just want to make sure I address both Sherlock and John's feelings. The next chapter has a bit more action to it.
Throwing the towel behind him, John snuggles up to Sherlock’s side, his head on the lean chest. One hand gropes for his and when he finds it he laces his fingers with the long violinists’, memorizing each crevasse and callous. Neither one of them can quite fall asleep. John squeezes his hand before finally speaking up.
“- I was able to rule out several suspects based on the stiffness of the ash alone. From the color and density of the ash it was obvious it came from a cigar, most likely between five and five an a half inches. Bit outdated, so the suspect was older and most likely male.”
John wants to throw up when he feels teeth scrape against the spot on his neck where the bonding gland is swelling slightly. Heat is flooding his face and he struggles a bit more but he’s weak and in pain and about half this man’s size. He’s at too much of a disadvantage and it’s mortifying to be this helpless. All it would take is a touch more pressure and the hormones will flood his body and send him into a microheat,
He locks the door to his room and pushes his small dresser in front of it for good measure. He strips down to his underwear in an attempt to cool off some. As John lies in bed, and feels the tell-tale wetness in the seat of his pants, he burrows deeper under the covers and dreads the next twenty hours.
He works at the cock in front of him, lithe fingers wrapped around the base while his tongue does cruel things to the delicate frenulum beneath the glossy head. John’s balls are pulled up tight, heavy with semen, and his muscles are twitching erratically. It doesn’t take a consulting detective to know he’s about to come. When he feels himself at the brink, John tries to warn the man, pushing blindly at his shoulder and crying out obscenities but Sherlock is unrelenting and when he massages the sensitive skin around John’s entrance his vision whites out.
“Well good luck with that,” John pulls his arm from the alpha’s grasp and continues his path through the cemetery.
The more comments and kudos the faster I update. This chapter is short but the good news is that the next chapter is already written and it's over twice the length of this one. Might go back to edit, might not. Much too early to tell.
“You look like shit. What the hell did his majesty do to you?” Greg’s tone is so light but John freezes, dropping his keys on the coffee table and pauses. He fears for a moment that Greg can see right through him, see everything he’s done in the last eight hours written on his face. He doesn’t straighten up until he hears Greg laughing, “It’s like he never left, you know? Christ I still don’t know what to think.”
“It’s not like that.” John spits out trying to put some distance between them but his grasp is strong.
Something giddy bubbled in John’s chest, and he choked on a strangled laugh as he slid into a chair. He’d kissed, held,
. Lestrade is why he didn’t grab John the moment he saw him and push him against the door of their flat and let him know just how sorry he was for everything. Lestrade is the reason Sherlock returned to Baker Street alone, without his blogger in tow.
John sighed, before making his way quickly up the steps. “Sherlock, I shouldn’t be staying too long, I just needed to talk to you about something”
He sounded sincere but the look in his eyes told Sherlock his was a power play, a challenge of sorts.
There’s nothing but the sparks of electricity where Sherlock touches him and it’s all John can feel. The nonsense muttering and litany of So Good’s and God’s falling from those cupid bow lips is all he can hear. Tobacco, coffee, and expensive soap are all he can smell. Nothing matters in those moments while he’s tilting and tipping over and spilling all over those clever hands and sweaty stomachs. He’s drowning now he knows it because he can’t pull air into his body.
“Moving in?” John shook his head, it’s impossible to jump from thought to thought the way he does, “No Sherlock, I’m not moving in. I’m here about… well – it’s about yesterday.” His throats going dry with fear.
“No please. Not tonight. Let’s just…not tonight.” John lazily pulls the duvet over them, settling in for sleep and Sherlock mumbles a goodnight into the soft blond hair.
. Finally, they’ve been stripped bare and John addicted to the skin contact, grabbing at the alpha desperately from his perch on the edge of the detective’s bed.
He must be a burden to the detective. John could barely get dressed by himself, although his therapist said that he’ll be more independent in the future once he and Sherlock adjust.
And he’s so close to finally getting a leg over with a gorgeous and tall alpha teacher when Sherlock practically chases her out of the flat without so much as lifting a finger.
He started wrapping gauze around the burn as John tugged his hand away weakly, “Sherlock. It’s barely anything. Leave it alone,” It wasn’t a real attempt to get away from the careful hands but it was enough to make John feel like he’d tried, like he was still fighting.
John just nods and hangs up his coat. He didn’t take a shower at Baker Street, he thought it would look too suspicious and once he’d slept a couple of hours the full weight of the situation slammed into him.  He’d slept with his best friend, the man who betrayed his trust, regularly insults his intelligence, puts him in dangerous situations, and experiments on him for fun. There was a slight crush before the  whole Moriarty debacle, John will be honest. It was small and constantly beating in the back of his mind but a relationship with him…it wouldn’t work.  They complement each other  perfectly but John’s always needed more.
Maybe if he stopped buying the tagless vests, John would be able to feel if his vests were right side out or not. In fact, this was a good opportunity to completely revise the doctor’s wardrobe. Maybe he could create some kind of system so John could match his socks (all those times John mocked his own sock index!). He filed the thought away for later.  For now, he focused on correcting the man’s ensemble.  John batted is hands away after the first button.
Sharp pain at his temple makes him nauseous upon wakening. It’s the only thing he can feel at first but slowly he begins to register the cold seeping through his clothing and a jagged, uneven surface digging into his body. The smell of cigarette smoke and mold make it very clear: This is not Baker Street. He struggles to peel his eyes open when hears voices at the other end of the space. Opening his eyes causes crackles of fresh pain in his skull and he can’t stop the groan that comes out.
“I’ll shoot you before you can move,” John growls at the youngest one, Scotty he thinks, who was pulling his own firearm from his waistband. Cigarette has barely moved from his spot. “I’m going to ask nicely and I’m going to ask once before I start shooting people. Now, please, if you will, tell me where we are.” He’s using the most commanding voice he can muster over the dull ache still throbbing in his head.
“Stay away.” The words are an almost unintelligible snarl and Sherlock’s arms are wrapped possessively around John.
John laughed himself up the stairs and into Sherlock’s and his bedroom, hoping he’s got awhile longer before his detective comes back to him. Awhile longer to just be John, to just be normal.
John was pacing between the television and the coffee table. Restless. Bored. He’s not even really thinking, just trying to expel some excess energy. The television set was buzzing and mumbling in the background while Sherlock sat in his chair, laptop propped on his knees watching his doctor shuffle back and forth.
It wasn’t unheard of for alphas to go for other alphas, but it wasn’t common either. Sherlock didn’t bother himself with many people. In fact, he could only pick three people his majesty has deemed worth his time at all: James Moriarty, Irene Adler, and himself. Two-thirds of that short list are alpha’s, and he could say with absolute certainty that he’d never seen the man react to anyway quite the same way he reacted to The Woman. Sherlock takes pride in being a social deviant, a self-proclaimed sociopath, and he’s never really been common so is it so far a stretch that the detective is gay? He’s got a fertile omega sitting in his flat every night, and he’s as possessive over John as he is his violin or his skull, but he doesn’t jump the blond doctor unless under hormonal stress: could it be that he only goes after other alphas? Not that there is anything wrong with it, he meant what he said that first night: it’s all fine.
The warmth on his back is soothing and he leans back into it. “John. What are you thinking?” One thin arm is wrapped around his waist and another across his chest, long fingers stroking his collarbone. The detective is trailing kisses up his spine.
Being upright suddenly is disorienting and John grabs desperately at Sherlock’s shoulders to steady himself. Sherlock eases towards the door, encouraging John to take a step but his knees suddenly feel like gelatin and he’s falling against the detective’s chest and Sherlock’s hit with the scent of an omega in heat. He spots a small spot of blood on John’s shoulder right where his omega endocrine gland would be. The bastard bit him and at that realization Sherlock feels his chest burn with anger.
“Jesus, John, you okay, mate?” Lestrade is approaching the duo. He freezes several feet from John, his nostrils flaring. John’s only half focusing, trying to articulate something but he’s having difficulties keeping his mind on one stream of thought.
The detective turns from his perch by the window, snapping the curtains shut to keep out prying eyes, to stare at his blogger. The smaller man is tense, still shaking from the fear and adrenalin of the evening.
Sherlock was like a passing cloud in summer, offering temporary relief from the sun and heat but Greg is the breeze, the warm grass, the blue sky. He’s the sun so warm after a cold winter and mushy spring. Things with Sherlock, he can’t let them change anything. He doesn’t want anything else. When he gets up, carefully, and gives his partner a deep but chaste kiss.
A digital female voice came from the computer speakers, “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” and John was grinning wide and chuckling softly while looking in the general direction of Mycroft. Sherlock cleared his throat to announce his presence, John jumped slightly and the smile shrunk considerably. Mycroft’s own smirk disappeared as he acknowledged his brother.
Mycroft can doubt him as much as he likes but Sherlock will be there for John, for everything. He won’t let him down. He loves him and he’ll take care of him for as long as John will have him.
“No. Let me finish.” His voice wasn’t cracking anymore, suddenly confident, he says with an even tone, “I miss the color of your eyes…but I don’t think I ever really appreciated the texture of your skin. Or the way your chest rumbles and vibrates when you talk. Like a bloody cat purring when you’re showing off. I never paid much attention to the smell of just
This was the fat bastard’s strategy. He was winning him over with little gifts and trinkets. He offered to get the man a service dog for God’s sake. It’s obvious his nosy sibling doesn’t think him possible of caring for another human being; no he thinks that he’s still the same volatile junkie he dropped off into rehab, or the same selfish child that made his own Jolly Roger out of Mycroft’s school uniforms.
Sherlock kisses him in return, just a light brush of lips on his forehead, but cannot return the smile. That’s fine. It’s all fine: because John can’t see the slight frown tugging at his lips.
To make the situation considerably worse, he was forcibly scenting John, and judging from the pheromones he’s been pumping out and his erection, the Alpha side of him wasn’t going to stop there. It makes him sick and he practically throws John away from him.
“As tempting as that offer is…” Lestrade rests his hands on John’s hips, not demanding, just feeling the solid body of the blond. He rests his forehead against John’s and looks in those blue eyes like they’re oceans and he hasn’t had a drink in days. His smile is addictive and John hopes he sees it for the rest of his life. “…and it is tempting, doctor Watson, I have to finish up these emails from this past case.  All that time away and Holmes has yet to gather the patience for paperwork.”
“They have to work around the scarring in your right eye from a previous injury obtained in Afghanistan. That’s what caused the first surgery to be so ineffective. It also explains why you started experiencing symptoms of re-detachment in that eye two hours before the other eye. Silicone will be used instead of gas to repair the left eye which initially failed due to the incompetence of the first medical professional we sought.” John tries to give Sherlock a reproaching look. The poor ophthalmologist on call at the A&E had no idea what he was getting into; he did the best he could. And part of it was John’s fault too, he was on so many painkillers he was hardly aware, barely able to tell anyone what he was seeing, or not seeing.
“I’m bleeding?” John thinks and pats himself. He can’t feel much pain anymore. “My ribs?” Sherlock’s hand fly towards his friends torso, lightly feeling for anything over the omega’s shirt. John starts giggling. It’s ticklish and it feels very good. Brow furrowing in concern Sherlock starts helping the small doctor stand.
John almost never went to crime scenes, anymore. He could no long play body guard, or help look for clues, or even inspect a body. Every time Sherlock got a new case, John wondered why Sherlock kept him around.
The pleading tone deflates Sherlock and he knows it’s the John’s nervousness turning him so irritable. It takes the fight right out of him. A Sherlock Holmes that doesn’t fight is a strange thing. With a quick order to find him as soon as John’s finished, he leaves the room with an uncharacteristic amount of cooperation.
Sherlock has his hand wrapped tightly around both of their erections, thrusting hard against the velvet, solid, heat of John. It’s not the most comfortable procedure, without proper lubricant, but between their combined pre-cum and a filthy lick along the palm of his hand he can feel his orgasm building, and he knows John’s getting ever closer as he writhes and gives aborted uncoordinated thrusts against Sherlock.
John wants to say something but he’s gotten so frustratingly close if he could just get his hands on himself- Like Greg can read his mind he releases John’s wrist and starts working his dick as he increases his rhythm to a near violent pace. It’s like a damn has broken and John has to use his newly freed hand to push on the headboard to keep from being thrown up the bed and headfirst into the cheap wood. It’s a passion he’s missed from Greg since work has overloaded them both. The honeymoon of their relationship ending abruptly with the return of a curly haired devil of a detective-
Sherlock’s desperate because John’s eyes will drift to the floor and he’ll frown slightly and sit in utter silence for an irritating span of time. He won’t let him run away so easily, not this time, not now when it’s so imperative that John fights.  Sherlock’s frustrated growl doesn’t so much as make John flinch.
Sometimes John worried that Sherlock would get wrapped up in a really interesting mystery and forget about him and he would be left stranded in this strange land (his own flat was now dangerous to him), hardly able to care for himself. Sometimes John wished that he would.
Sherlock’s mind is blank. There are so many emotions and meanings behind that confession that he’s afraid of running straight into a land mine and ruining the tentative repair in their relationship.
Sherlock bounds into Baker Street, a slight high from the case he’s been on for twenty hours. A simple thing really: wife faked her death and stole a couple million from her husband to run off to the States with her mistress. There was a good bit of undercover work, a break in, and an opportunity to show off in front of Lestrade and the others. It was good.
“Sherlock…” He’s panting so hard it’s embarrassing, “Sherlock…just-”When he feels those slender talented fingers near his entrance his blood feels like its on fire, “Get on with it!”  Sherlock’s got three fingers flexing and curling in the tight passage, and he’s sucking red marks along John’s inner thighs. Had this been any other time, John would have loved the foreplay and teasing but in the desperate, wanton state he’s in now, he’s quickly getting frustrated. He knows Sherlock’s enjoying it that prick.
John’s not completely lost to his hormones; he knows it’s Sherlock that’s pushing him down into the mattress, his spicy scent filling his senses. He’s able to understand the words being muttered to him even though he doesn’t agree and he just wants Sherlock to get on with it because he’s burning with fever. Sherlock’s crawling beneath his legs, his mouth warm on his stomach while he litters it with kisses that do nothing to cool his heated skin.
“I’m sorry about that, Doctor, he’s acts like a bloody child. Most of my physicians end up kicking him out themselves. Please continue.” John’s used to apologizing for Sherlock’s behavior, although Hart seems to have dealt with it far longer than most.
Crooked Nose is holding his bleeding face in his hands, groaning, as John stands up pointing his weapon at the others. From the crack John heard, it’s safe to assume he’s broken the man’s nose. Mustache starts moving towards him but freezes when he sees the gun. Hands up in a placating gesture, he shoots a look to the blond alpha still perched on the crate.
And John is only smiling, watching the manic ranting because the case is back on and Sherlock loves him and he loves Sherlock and he hopes when he wakes up in the morning that this hasn’t been some kind of experimental drug induced dream.
John closes his eyes and see’s the tall figure against the grey sky and the deafening crack and the pale ice-blue eyes empty, sticky with blood–
John lets out a strangled moan, feeling for a moment as though he was being ripped in two.  But the pain subsides in just a few moments, when john feels Sherlock’s warm seed flooding him. Sherlock’s moving his hips in small circles, while simultaneously working John’s swollen and sensitive prick. In less than a minute, John’s drowning in his own orgasm, body shuddering, muscles contracting, a near scream ripping itself from his throat.
Sherlock leans over him, hunched slightly and balancing all his weight on one arm to come face to face with the doctor. Their faces centimeters apart, their panting breaths mixing in the humid, warm atmosphere surrounding them; Sherlock’s free hand is stroking John’s waist and down his thighs, pulling his leg up by the knee to rest on his hip. John wraps his leg around the alpha’s slim figure. Sherlock’s guiding his cock towards John’s wet opening, the swollen head just starting to breach the sensitive rim.
“John.” The doctor lets out a relieved breath at the familiar voice. Sherlock. He sees the detective take a brief pause when he sees him before he runs towards John. Sherlock’s frantically pulling at the knots in the rope, getting Johns feet free by the time Lestrade comes running in and tosses the brunet a small army knife. He slices at the binds at John’s wrists, careful with the bruising surrounding them.
John’s anxiety was never such an issue before. The cases and excitement worked the adrenaline out of his system. He suffered from the occasional nightmare, and some cases hit him harder than others but he had it under control.
Of course Sherlock could always arrange their deaths, accidental or otherwise, without having to get his hands dirty but that’s not what he wants. He wants an outlet for his anger, his frustration. He would rip them apart until the fury subsided and he felt like he could breathe again.
The six murders are the only ones they can definitively link to the same person, but Sherlock suspects there are more. That many hits over the course of only forty-eight hours? Someone’s been busy. Hits? Yes, hits, whoever is doing this is purposefully cleaning out a stock of dealers, pimps, and loan sharks. Snitches most likely, but also people taking skimming the profits.  Before their assault, John and him had reduced the possible rendezvous points to two different locations and it appears they were close by. Their thug got nervous and struck out when he saw them getting to close to their hideaway.
Thank you for being patient and if somehow you've held on all these years to see to the conclusion of this story than you are a spectacular beyond belief.
He’s seen them together and they’re a good match. They’re not perfect, no, Lestrade will never satiate John’s addiction to danger and John will never be as stable as Lestrade craves but theirs is the kind of easy chemistry that overcomes that. What has Sherlock done to them? Lestrade’s not a stranger to unfaithful partners, and John knows that. He’ll be eaten alive by his own transgressions trying to repair things with Lestrade if Sherlock let’s this go any further. John’s so caring and kind…but so is the D.I. and he’s likely to forgive the soldier eventually. They’ll survive this and Sherlock understands there is no happy ending for him, but he’ll take what he can get. He’ll take John, even if it’s only a taste, even if he has to give him back to the D.I. at the end. He’ll always have John by his side, Sherlock is sure, even if it’s nothing more than a friend.
“Shit,” Jumping up, he grabbed his clothes, quickly dressing, and searching for his phone. He’s hoping Greg hasn’t become worried that he’s not home, yet. Once dressed, he spins on Sherlock, and rests a hand on his chest, “Sherlock – “
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “Yes, Lestrade. Keep up. We were investigating a lead together before we were jumped…” He explains like he’s talking to a child.
I already have some idea for another chapter but overall I'm not sure how long this will be. Probably around five chapters at the most.
With the last of the moonlight, John’s sin faded in the morning sun. He moved out of bed carefully, to leave Greg undisturbed in their bed, and got dressed in the dark before heading out the bedroom door, through the living room and into the kitchen to get water boiling.
“I trust you.” Is all he can choke out. John’s terrified, more terrified than he thinks he’s ever been…and he invaded Afghanistan! But the fear fades as Sherlock strips him of his clothes, peeling off button down and practically ripping the trousers from John’s legs. Sherlock takes only a bit more care with his own clothes, the stuck up
Every fibre of his being is saying not to leave the omega alone like this, with these thoughts running in his mind but it’s not his place.  He nods, and leaves him sitting there.
John had kept his eyes closed since the nurse had taken off the bandages. He thought that maybe if he didn’t open his eyes, it wouldn’t be real. Maybe they’d all been lying to him. Maybe this was one of Sherlock’s experiments.
To lose someone by death is painful but everyone dies, eventually. It’s one of the few guarantees we get in life. The pain of losing his best friend was horrid, John cannot deny, but if Greg was to leave him…well that’s entirely different. To lose someone in life is a lasting ache because he’d have to wake up every day and know that they’re out there, somewhere, living, smiling, and dreaming without him. Death is unavoidable, John can begrudge mortality only so much.
“No, god, no. But when it gets bad I won’t be able to control myself. I know I won’t, and if I drop and present in the middle of a bonding heat….well, how many alpha’s do you know could say no to that?” Lestrade’s blushing at the mental image, but he understands the concern. Bonding and consent laws get sticky and John is making his stand very clear as long as he’s still lucid: He doesn’t want to bond. He’s withholding consent. “He doesn’t want this, Greg. I mean, you could imagine Sherlock Holmes having to be domestic? The chemicals coming from my body are manipulating him, forcing him. He’ll resent me if this happens. I don’t want it to happen like this.”
Mycroft’s threats were pushed to the back of his mind as he ran to the bedroom. He slowed as he crossed the threshold. John was curled in the bed, awake but drowsy. Upon closer inspection, Sherlock could see dried tears on his cheeks and his dusty eyelashes were still damp. He obviously had some sort of panic attack.
How did this man know his name? Surely if he knows John’s name then he’ll know he works with Sherlock, and that friendship puts him more danger than anything else.
It wasn’t until he started applying burn cream to the angry red skin that John spoke up, “I don’t need help with everything you know. I’m not useless.”
God, did John want this, but – “This isn’t fair to Greg. He trusts me. We’re happy.” John’s mouth barely formed all these words, his very body fighting what was coming out of him, “I’m sorry about yesterday, but Greg and I will be okay, and you and I
They stand in front of the bathroom mirror because it’s habit for John. It’s preferable for Sherlock because he can see the weary face relax, there in the reflection, underneath his gentle touch.
” Sherlock’s got such a tight hold of his arm and he’s pulled the blond omega so close all he can smell is the detective and he’s so damn angry at him but still he wants to get closer and bury his nose in that warm scent.  “And now this hound, that I saw but couldn’t have possibly been there. How?”
….I won’t move until you say it’s okay. Breathe.” The last thing Sherlock wants to do is hurt the small omega but he’s hoping it’s not too long before he can move because the sensations around the most vulnerable part of his body is nearly overwhelming his discipline.
Shaking himself, John mumbles out, “Oh uh um yes no thanks I think I can make it to the shower downstairs if you could, I mean if you don’t mind…” John looks over at his dressing gown draped over the top of his bureau. Sherlock nods enthusiastically as he rushes to retrieve the item for his friend.  Handing it to the battered omega, he turns to give him some privacy. Sure that Sherlock was facing the other way; John rose slowly from his bed, clutching the sheets to himself. He keeps a moan of pain to himself as straightens up and slips on the gown. When he takes a step forward, a gasp escapes him and Sherlock turns to rush back to his side.
If Sherlock Holmes was a better man, he wouldn’t do this. But he’s not. He can’t pass this up, his only friend, the man he loves in front of him asking him to make him his. He can’t say no that, future be damned.
“No, John” of course John recognized that deep voice.  Sherlock approached the bed and sat on the edge, putting his hand out and brushed John’s cheeks with the back of his fingers. The blond crawled across the bed a bit to put his head on Sherlock’s hip.
So, yes, the ex-army doctor is mortified at the possibility that Sherlock Holmes has been aware of his feelings the entire time, but John’s humiliation is turning to fire in his veins. If the alpha has known this entire time then there’s no doubt he’s been taking advantage of it and sudden paranoia grips him that he’s the butt of some kind of joke.
“Did I say something wrong?” Sherlock’s picking a slide up, preparing it meticulously. He considers giving up on trying to understand John’s mood swing completely.
He’d spend more time on the subject but his mobile is ringing and the screen reading Mycroft Holmes is telling him the following conversation will require all his brain-power.
“No I’m fine, my legs just feel a bit like gelatin. Just help me to the shower; I’ll be fine once I’m under some hot water.” Sherlock offers his arm stiffly, and John takes it leaning heavily against the man. The detective is surprisingly strong and the trip down the stairs and across the hall is easy. John tries not to think of the solid warm body that has his brain screaming
While Lestrade generally trusts Sherlock, this is a dangerous situation. John never explicitly gave consent and he can’t in this state, on top of being injured and kidnapped. He needs to be somewhere safe.
“Hello, Mycroft. To what do we owe the pleasure?” He didn’t bother to hide his annoyance; John wouldn’t chastise him about it anyway.
“I should know better than anyone else how stupid it is to try and restrain a person having a night terror,” Stupid,
him. His baser nature is begging him to give in, bare his throat and arch against the potential mate. It’s hard to ignore the part of him telling him to give Sherlock access to the glands that will release the hormones necessary for bonding heat.
He’s tense, fearful of what this man will do. Legally, if he’s forcibly bonded and raped here in this shithole ruin of a building to this brute working for Moriarty, he can dissolve the bond, press charges and hunt the bastard down. Biologically, he won’t want to.
Sherlock is biting along the doctor’s strong collarbone, “No, Sherlock- no- hhn….no marks” John’s senses are fleeting but he might as well make some attempt to keep what’s going on tonight a secret from his boyfriend.
!” The threat turns into a debauched moan when the brunet takes the head of John’s penis into his mouth. Applying light suction to the swollen glands, he tongues at the slit. The bitter tang explodes across his tongue and Sherlock could swear that sucking off John Watson is all he wants to do for the rest of his life. Sherlock trails the dry pad of a finger along John’s perineum and a smug smile breaks across his face when his blogger lets out a high keening sound, he’s sure Lestrade doesn’t pull sounds like that from the man.
Sherlock knew he wanted to savor this, because yesterday he thought would be his last chance to be so intimate with John, but life is giving him an opportunity (or at least, Sherlock is
“Greg.” John musters all his concentration to utter the name in his most serious tone, the tone that sent underlings to battle and medics to action. It’s Captain Watson beneath Lestrade in that moment and he tries to pull his mind off his throbbing erection to focus on the words coming out of him, “I need you to fuck me, right now.”
“No, uhm, that’s what I came to talk about.” John is shifting uncomfortably as he drops himself onto the sofa, “Yesterday, what happened. Sherlock I’ve,” he gulps, “What we did yesterday we… shouldn’t have done”
The others jump into action, delivering a few good kicks and punches before their leader lets out a short whistle, calling them off.
The first thing John needs to do is talk to Sherlock, make sure he understands that this can’t fester between them. Sherlock left all of them behind, and he must find a way to fit into the life everyone has made for themselves in his absence. There is too much that wasn’t said, before and after, Sherlock’s disappearance and they chose the wrong way to say it. It occurs to him to try and text or call him, but he knows if Sherlock is deep in his mind, he won’t even hear his phone ring.
You guys are only getting this chapter now because I don't want to do my ethnobotany project. I was going to wait a few more days but the need to procrastinate was strong.
Deciding on his actions, John turns off the kettle and heads to the door to grab a coat and slip shoes on. He’s pocketing his keys when he realizes he should leave a note for Lestrade, who should be waking up in a couple hours’ time.
“He’s not obviously.” Sherlock’s gripping the sides of John’s face, trying to get those feverish eyes to look at him. “John, hey, look at me, do you need immediate care? You don’t appear severely injured.”
“Sherlock, if I wanted to post your account of a case word for bloody word then there isn’t much point. They can all go and read yours.” Sherlock is silent in response and John turns on his heel, heading towards the kitchen.
The cloying smell of chlorine is still stuck to his clothing, reminding him of the hell he just barely escaped. John should never have been in that situation and the only reason they’d gotten their hands on his blogger was because he let that man out of his sight. John had left to go to Sarah’s and that was the problem. Didn’t the omega know he was his? And yet he was running out to someone else and that put him in danger.
You would have had this chapter two days ago but the internet went out and well don't even get me started.
Sherlock would watch him when he thought he was alone, sitting in his armchair with his mobile gripped tightly in one hand, the other one drumming impatiently. He looked like he was listening out for something.
“It’s better we confront this now rather than let it fester and harm our dynamic.” The words sound rehearsed and John wonders if Sherlock read that in a book or got in from the television. They’re doing this, having this awkward conversation, because Sherlock feels compelled to. It’s just damage control.
I want to spread out the updates but I'm so impatient so it's a real possibility that I'll update tomorrow.
It’s too slow for John and Greg is just gently pressing by prostate, enough to make the pleasure curl his toes but not overwhelm him. It’s deliberate, because Greg is nothing if not an attentive lover, to make this last longer. Greg is panting, hot and moist against John’s ear and he hears his name mixed with curses slip out occasionally. John’s rocking against those tan hips and making embarrassingly high pitched keening noises as the pressure in his groin builds.
John is thinking about other bruises now, shadows around his wrists, across his hips… The image pulls a wiper from his throat. He moves his arms - he’s not really fighting anymore, he’s relishing how Sherlock’s weight presses into him through his palm, how John can tug and not be able to move.
getting some direct stimulation. He moans aloud, as Sherlock’s wide hand strokes them both. John thrusts his hips, pushing his cock through Sherlock’s fist and feel a surge of pride when Sherlock’s moans match his own. He tightens his grip in Sherlock’s hair and grins in satisfaction when Sherlock’s moan gets just a little bit deeper.
Sherlock had deliberately taken a case that was only barely a six, in order to allow them to play it out how they wanted. Sherlock withheld the solution until they were safely within New Scotland Yard, where the option for semi-privacy would hopefully come into play.
"You like to watch, you like seeing what I'll do for your pleasure. Of course I liked it, I liked knowing that you were watching me swallow down that massive cock, stopping yourself from pushing him away and taking his pleasure as your own.” Sherlock smiles wryly and adds, “and you wanted to, didn't you? You wanted to throw him out and have me suck you instead"
John had definitely been around Sherlock too long. He could read small details and shifts in body language like he never had before. And one of those details was that Lestrade wasn’t just looking appreciatively at them both - he was looking at them both
At first, he struggles. He relishes the feeling of Sherlock forcing him into submission even as he’s biting Sherlock’s lips in an effort to fight back. He tenses his arms and rocks his hips in time with Sherlock’s thrusts in an attempt to somehow knock Sherlock off-balance. He trembles with undisguised pleasure when Sherlock growls at his stubbornness.
And John’s hands are effectively tied, his arms stretched above his head but bent at the elbows, his wrists behind his neck as Sherlock pulls the shirt downwards. John is panting, trying to get enough air but he can’t; not when Sherlock is looking at him like he wants to
One part of the plan doesn’t need much falsification - Sherlock is in an absolute terror of a mood. He’s annoyed by the case, frustrated by how long it has taken to get to the point of making a move on Greg, and has been driven to distraction by the plug John had put in his arse that morning. It’s been moving around inside him
Sherlock cries out at the assault on his body, a flood of sensations pummeling his overstimulated nerves. John’s angle is perfect for stimulating his prostate and his teeth make frequent trips to his shoulders, neck, and back, leaving behind purpling bruises. John's hands roam from his neck to his hair to his hips, to his arse as he spreads Sherlock to watch as his cock slides in and out.
John glances up at Lestrade, whose face is is by now caught between utter bewilderment and restrained arousal. He looks back down to Sherlock.
Greg, still confused, gestures to the space around him and says, “right here is as good as any place. But, are you sure that-”
John turns back to Sherlock. “You see that, Sherlock, Greg’s willing to let the matter go. He’s not unreasonable. Now,” he addresses Greg once more. “Are you sure you don’t want him to make up for being a shit?”
, John has been loving being held down, has relished the feeling of being unable to wriggle away from Sherlock’s whims, but
"God, John, fill me up until I'm overflowing with it - Mark me all over, inside and out. Fucking paint me with your come because I'm yours!"
Sherlock replies, “there is an appeal to that. But if we’re having you calling the shots, I’d just like to know what might occur.” He hits John with a penetrating stare. “Do you want to watch me swallow Greg’s come? Watch it leak out of me?”
"Oh, you do like that don't you?" Sherlock jerkily nods in John's grasp. "Well, let's table that for now, shall we? Because for right now, I want you all to myself. I'm not normally a selfish man but," John grabs Sherlock's arse with his free hand, gripping it tightly, "This arse is mine. And it's my turn with it. Up."
John knows a challenge when he sees one. He lets go of Sherlock and rises so that he, too, can stand. He watches as Sherlock removes the rest of his clothing and
“Right. Behave, then. As I said, he’s a good guy, and I admire him for that. He’s clever - don’t pull that face, compared to regular people he is - and he always conducts himself with this quiet, driven purpose. He’s also very good looking, and he’s got a wicked sense of humor under all that professionalism.”
.” John nods vigorously in understanding. He could feel him moving behind him, bending low and John can see in his mind’s eye what they both looked like.
talk? God, John, can you not see what state I’m in right now? You’re one to talk. Do something, I can’t handle any more goddamned teasing.”
John thinks saltily. He sucks in a deep breath through his nose, silently praying that Sherlock will not look southward. He straightens to his full height and strides around Sherlock to the more open space behind him.
Greg sighs in relief when he’s released from the confines of his clothes. Sherlock’s eyes glance up at him, taking in Greg’s appearance.
but it also lessens the pressure on John’s arms and that’s all the invitation he needs to wriggle free and knock Sherlock’s elbows outwards, bringing Sherlock’s face closer
With that, he tugs on Sherlock's hair to make him move to stand. He pushes Sherlock's face into the mattress and says, "Arse up. Stay."
John fingers tighten on Sherlocks neck and his tone turns a little steely. “Do you want an answer, or not?”
Then, gradually, John relaxes into the tide of lust Sherlock washes over him. He stops wriggling for freedom and focuses on squirming to enhance his own pleasure. He cants his hips up, trying to plant his feet on the ground to give him better leverage. His efforts make Sherlock groan into his mouth before finally coming up for air with a gasp.
“It’ll scare him off. He’s too much inside his own head to let go if given the direct offer. He’ll need some persuading.”
. He hasn’t done this in years, never so eager to have it before Sherlock. But now, having Sherlock hot and hard, inching inside him, John wants to throttle his past self for not insisting upon it sooner.
John loves it when he’s able to render Sherlock almost speechless. His words lacking their usual surgical precision, their standard finesse. It makes John feel powerful, the heady notion that Sherlock is getting off just from John’s words alone and that’s all it takes to get Sherlock in the right headspace to submit to him.
“Very,” Sherlock says with a smile. Without warning, He sweeps John’s feet out from under him with his leg and John goes down. John’s breath leaves him with a groan of “ow” before Sherlock is on him, straddling John’s thighs to try and pin John’s hands above his head.
“Remember John,” Sherlock’s voice breaking through to his foggy brain, “no hiding from me. I want to hear
“I suppose it would be. Given your reaction to high stress situations.” Sherlock continued to eye him and ask, “and how did it make you feel, hmm? Watching Greg and I ‘go at each other?’”
“Oi, lay off, will you! These are good people and they’re doing their best and I won’t have you bad mouthing them just because they don’t live up to your ridiculous standards!”
He shuffles - far more gracefully than should be possible - closer to the desk where Greg is resting.
John places a firm grip on the back of Sherlock’s neck and uses it to pull Sherlock forward until he tips forward out of his chair, onto his knees on the floor.
John tries to entice Sherlock to break his rhythm, to break the rules of the game by smearing his leaking cock along Sherlock's cheek, silently daring him to stop sucking on the cock in his mouth before it's reached its peak. Sherlock desperately wants to reach out with his tongue and please both at the same time but he knows if he does John will make him pay for it.
He knows that his role is to just lay there and moan and play with Sherlock and not to speak. But with the way that sherlock absolutely
John thinks with a slight whine. At Sherlock’s chuckle, it occurs to him that he might have just whined aloud. His whine turned into a groan of pain as Sherlock’s finger pushed down into the skin. He flinches, trying to squirm away from the pain but was stopped when Sherlock’s hips grind down into him, confusing his brain.
“We’ll discuss this further when you haven’t drained all the blood from my brain with all your talk.” John thrusts his hips, dragging his cock along Sherlock’s.
"Did you like that? Making a slut of yourself sucking someone else's cock? You didn't even want him, did you? You'd do anything, anything at all, to prove how much I own you. You are mine." John’s hand twists in Sherlocks hair, just a little. "Did you like him grabbing on you, thinking that he can really have you? He'll never have you like I do"
John tries to control himself, to deny Sherlock for as long as long as possible - but watching Sherlock’s head bob, the sinful stretch of his spine down to his legs spread obscenely wide to give John a perfect view of his ass, tested John self-control to it’s very limits. No man could resist such a sight for too long. John loves watching him, but he also loves reminding him who he belongs to after they play this game.
Sherlock was a flighty creature at the best of times, so John tried to broach the subject carefully. It would likely not even be a full three minutes before Sherlock saw right through him.
When Sherlock’s hole is nice and stretched, John rubs his cock along the crack of his ass, drawing out the anticipation. Sherlock whimpers beneath him.
Oh, and that means John’s done well. It usually takes more than this to get Sherlock this desperate. It's a good thing too, because John needs to fuck him hard enough to bruise. He wants to see the shadows of his fingers and teeth on Sherlock for days afterwards.
is the one in control of Sherlocks body. He can't resist leaning forward to suck more marks across Sherlocks shoulders.
,” Sherlock says with a smirk. He knows what that word does to him, riling John up. His cock gives a hopeful twitch even though it’s just spent. “Tell me what you picture when it comes to me and Greg? Will you have him yourself? Give me to him? Will you use him as a tool, an extension of your hand?”
. John drops his hands and spins around to fist Sherlock’s curls in his hands, pulling him by his hair onto the mattress. He’s progressed from needy into out and out desperate as he straddles Sherlock’s hips, one hand still in Sherlock’s hair, the other on his shoulder.
But John, terrified that Sherlock will feel his persistent interest, manages to push Sherlock back just enough that he can swing his good leg across Sherlock’s chest and flip their positions.
Sherlock is beyond answering. His only reply is a hard suck to the fingers in his mouth as he pushes his hips up against John’s. He’s desperate. John knows he wants to cry out, wants to tell John to bring them both off. He wants permission to come.
The thought of being manhandled by Sherlock makes John embarrassingly hard. He’s desperate to feel those new, hardened muscles pressing into him and trapping him against the wall, floor, bed, he’s not picky. He finds himself trying to come up with a scenario where he can “innocently” entice Sherlock into sparring with him.
Sherlock’s hand tightens in their clasp, John’s words getting to him. “And now you’re going to do,” he swallows thickly, nervously, “what exactly?”
He kisses John’s neck, punctuating his musings with firm kisses. “What about dominating Greg turns you on? What about
John giggles. “Yes, also that.” He brushes a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head and continues. “As for what I have in mind in regards to the two of you, hard to say. There’s a lot I’d like to do.”
at that movement. A fierce expression crosses his face, and he shifts to hold Johns hips still, leaning even closer until he is
Through it all, all Sherlock can do is keen, scream, and moan, pleading with John to fuck him harder, touch him, begging him not to stop but to let him come, wanting John to fill him. John, for his part, lets all kinds of filthy things fall from his mouth. "Take me, all of me", "Who does your body belong to?", “Is that what you need? My cock inside you? My come inside you?", "Fuck, the thought of anyone else having you, never going to happen, this arse is mine".
When John moves into Sherlocks field of vision, his eyes never leave John - they focus on his cock, seeing it drip, picturing it being John that's in his mouth. They occasionally flick upwards to seek eye contact with John, drinking in his obvious arousal, and conveying Sherlocks own.
Sherlock has caught his breath, and a wicked glint enters his eye. "Fetch the plug and I'll wear you all over, all night"
And he dives right in - his tongue barely ghosting around before it's pressing in and licking at Sherlocks twitching rim. Sherlock is chanting John's name into the bed covers, garbled pleas that lost any coherence long ago.
Sherlock may have miscalculated, because that image described in John's aroused, gravelly voice may just do him in then and there.
Of course, Sherlock had known from the minute he showed up to that first crime scene. He had been high as a kite and yet Lestrade had found him attractive, even if his pitying, white-knight personality stayed his hand. Rather than taking advantage of a compromised, young junkie, he chose not to act on his obvious attraction. Not to mention his own personal morals, Sherlock could see that even if his wife cheated he’d be damned if he would stoop to her level - not while they were still technically married, anyways.
From there on, it’s a grapple to try and be the one on top and neither of them pull their punches. Literally.
John, strung out, naked and spread out beneath Sherlock, trembling and silently begging to be touched. Sherlock, fully clothed and devouring him with his eyes, hands, and soon his mouth, hungry in every sense of the word.
It’s John that moves next, gently cards a hand over the crown of Sherlock’s head. "Good boy, look at you, you've done very well. Stay right there while I take care of our guest"
John opens his eyes, barely aware that he had even closed them. Sherlock’s fingers replace his mouth, teasing, barely brushing over his nipple as Sherlock tips his head to blow on the wet skin. When those fingers pinched at the same time as another roll of those sinful hips, John is powerless to stop the high pitched moan the tore out of his throat.
When John comes back to the bedroom he finds Sherlock right where he left him, slumped on his knees in front of the bed, breathing deeply and waiting for John to finish this. He comes up behind him, stroking his hair once more.
“I think it’d be even more attractive if you could do that whilst preserving a little bit of that pride of yours - if you had no choice but to appease him, because you’d been told too”
Greg looks between them, at Johns hand resting on the back of Sherlock’s head, at those lips stretched around him. John’s gaze is on Sherlock, and he’s very clearly aroused. But then he looks up at Greg, and the heat in his gaze doesn’t dissipate. Greg watches, pinned to the desk by that stare, as John steps forward so he has Sherlock between his legs. He leans in and Greg remains hypnotized as John comes closer, until his breath is ghosting over Greg’s mouth. It’s Greg that closes the final inches and brings their lips together.
To that end, he makes the filthiest noises, acting like the cock in his mouth is the best thing he's ever experienced, and generally performs as slutily as he can. He has his hands all over the guy John had chosen for him tonight, grabbing his flesh and slipping fingers inside him like he just can't resist. It'll either get John incredibly aroused or drive him a little nuts with possessiveness - either way, it's a win for them both.
He doesn't waste any time inserting his fingers back into Sherlocks arse, moving his other hand through the come on Sherlock’s back before wrapping it around his cock. "Can you feel that? It's all over you. In you. I'm everywhere. It's practically dripping out of you"
John sputters into his tea, looking agog at Sherlock with liquid dripping from his face. “I beg your pardon?”
“Well, it seemed like the two of you were butting heads, trying to figure out how to move forward. I think I’d be able to handle that for you both. Guide you a little. I think I’d be more than capable of handling both of you, even worked into a froth like that.”
Lightning fast, Sherlock latches onto John’s right nipple, sucking and laving his tongue over it. John’s body clenches automatically, back arching in an attempt to both draw Sherlock closer and shift away from his assault. “Oh
It’s way too much and not nearly enough all at once. Sherlock’s tongue is teasing, sweeping over and around, pressing softly against the centre of the pucker for barely a moment before moving on. Tension coils in Johns stomach. Sherlock is relishing teasing him, refusing to give John enough to satisfy.
“Maybe you’d like to take us both at the same time - have him fuck you while you suck me off? Or maybe he could fuck you while
When Sherlock’s hands come to the globes of his arse, they knead it firmly, gripping his cheeks. John tightens his fists in his bunched up shirt, determined to keep at least that part of him still.
“I’m so close,” he pants against John’s lips. “I need to,” Greg swallows thickly, clenching his eyes closed to try and focus on getting words out. “I want to come.”
“Good,” Sherlock’s low voice purrs. He unclenches his hand and gently removes it. Then he slowly lifts off him and John keens at the loss, feeling suddenly cold. Sherlock soothes the loss with a slide of his hands along John’s naked back. John leans into it, relishing the contact.
“Honestly, Lestrade, it’s one thing to have incompetent team members but to not notice such blatant stupidity practically makes you as bad as them!”
“Have to present it to him slowly, like dipping your toes into a pool. Have to ask him when his desires are right at the surface, when he’s most likely to agree.”
to play with his own. He has to pull away and gasp for breath as delicious vibrations stir him - Sherlock is looking up at them and positively moaning around his mouthful of cock.
Sherlock’s soft cock slips out of him and the sensation of his cooling come dribbling out of John’s just-slightly-more-than-pleasantly-sore hole pulls an exhausted whimper from John.
be revisiting this dynamic, but John’s blood is up and Sherlock needs to be taken down a peg. Besides, if John doesn’t get some real stimulation
Good.” In one swift move, Sherlock rolls them over so John is pressed into the mattress once more. “You’ll never not be able to feel me again.”
John allows Sherlock to move his forearms in front of him to balance himself. He places one hand on Sherlocks neck, his fingers wrapping around the front of his throat. The other guides his cock inside as his hips press forward in an unrelenting, delicious slide.
“So, those moves we did would land blows across the top of the shoulder, collarbones, and upper chest, thus creating some unique bruise patterns. Helpful?”
“You’d like it if I ordered you to service Greg. To have you use your mouth to bring him off, your hands to make him moan and writhe. Would you like to fuck him? Bury your cock inside him? Or  would you prefer it if he took you instead? Do you think he’d enjoy watching me open you up, knowing he could just plunge right in?”
John closes the distance between them and lays his hand gently on Sherlock’s head and says warmly, “go ahead. It’s alright.”
"Greedy little thing, am I not already giving you everything you could possibly want? My full," he licks Sherlock's quivering hole, "undivided', another lick, "attention. What more could you possibly want?"
That penetrating gaze was boring into him, as if Sherlock could pull the thoughts from his head through sheer willpower alone. John had never been cowed by that look before, and he wasn’t going to now.
They’re both breathing like they’ve sprinted 300 metres uphill. John eases sideways, stretching to snag some form of clothing from the floor to clean up with. He thinks it’s his own t-shirt he ends up with - probably better than anything high-maintenance of Sherlock’s. He gently cleans both of their mess from Sherlock’s belly, while Sherlock seems dead to the world. When John settles down next to him, Sherlock curls into him. John adores him like this - relaxed in his affections, not withholding anything.
“Off you go” John encourages him with gentle pressure on his neck, conscious that Sherlock may need a bit of reassurance now the possibility of touching someone that isn’t John is so real.
. His mouth returns, his tongue spiralling in. Then a slick finger is pressing alongside, and that delicious wet muscle is replaced by firm pressure, circling and then pressing
Slowly, John eases Sherlock’s cock inside him until he bottoms out. Their chests heave into each other as they both try not to move or jostle John before he was ready. John’s arms wind themselves around Sherlock’s neck and he buries his face there as well, steadying himself as he waits for his body to relax.
Wanting to stretch out their pleasure a little bit longer, John snatches up Sherlock’s hand in his and pins it next to Sherlock’s head. Sherlock doesn’t put up a fight at the movement but John knows to be cautious; neither of them would give up so easily.
That’s when Sherlock swings a leg over John’s hips so that he’s no longer straddling John’s hips. Frankly, that is the most disappointing event of the evening until
His voice is in John’s ear again, his back pressing him down and contorting him in like a pinned butterfly. “I’ll need both my hands for this.” At Sherlock’s words, John’s cock gives a mighty twitch and he can feel precome well up at his tip. He bites back a needy moan and nods in understanding. “Can I trust you to keep your hands right where I leave them?”
, John? You’ve been so good, don’t act like I’m not giving you everything you could possibly want. You’re exactly where you want to be. You couldn’t bring yourself to move if you tried.”
“Oh god,” John pants, softly, body coiled tight with anticipation. Sherlock makes him wait for it, trailing light kisses across the base of his spine, ghosting his warm breath along his crack. John is growing desperate for something more. Some productive stimulation before Sherlock drives him mad. He wants to move, to wriggle his hips to entice Sherlock to
“John, I can see that you want this.” He trails his free hand down between John’s cheeks, making him jump the little bit he was able. Sherlock rubs a brief circle against his hole and John groans.
And then, after John saw Sherlock and Lestrade stare each other down, he realized Lestrade’s interests weren’t just in him. The rest of the Yarders didn’t seem to notice anything different from any other day, but John did. From the outside, it looked as if Sherlock was giving him a dressing down, berating him for incompetence, and that Lestrade was stewing in anger. But, if you looked just past that, you’d see that once the yelling stopped and they stood their baring their teeth at each other, they were also silently devouring. John could see that Sherlock wanted to push Lestrade against the wall, could see that Lestrade wanted to shove his cock in Sherlock’s mouth and make him shut up. Their eyes couldn’t help but roam over each other, frantically tracing over lips and fluttering pulses.
John’s mouth is intoxicating, and Greg is immediately on the back foot - John is an absolutely filthy kisser and Greg is just along for the ride. Tongue is involved from the beginning, sweeping over Greg’s mouth and
John’s isn’t sure whether inviting more of this is a fantastic idea or an utterly terrible one. John’s breathing hard, trying not to obviously pant into their wallpaper as he tries to get his erection under control. Sherlock releases him and takes a step back and John is both thankful for the space and loathes it.
Greg looks up at John, still very much in shock. John nods encouragingly, his tongue peeking out as his smile turns predatory.
“Look how well you did, Sherlock. You’re so good for us. I’m sure Greg will forgive you now, won’t you, Greg?”
John has a real problem with his inability to keep cool when checking out Sherlock's body. Like, it was definitely a problem before The Fall, but it's worse now.
Sherlock goes momentarily still. “That’s… yes. An intriguing idea. Would you tell me exactly what you wanted me to do?”
"Maybe I'd even hold your wrists behind your back, so the only thing keeping your balance is the way I fuck you - my cock pushing you further onto his."
Sherlock moves against him, his cock rising against John’s thigh. “John,” Sherlock whispers, voice a tad shakey.
His hips rise up halfway off Sherlock only to slide back down to press their pelvises together in a maddening grind. Sherlock’s hands tighten around his hips, not guiding or rushing but enjoying, and John silently hopes that there will be new bruises to add to his collection.
Sherlock’s answering moan makes them all groan, so visceral and provocative. His head bobs faster, the sucking sounds becoming more obscene and it’s all so much.
When John lets go, Sherlock goes boneless beneath him and John flattens his tongue in a broad stripe against the tortured skin before sitting up to view his handiwork. The love bite left behind will be neatly covered by his collar and only John will know how raw and purple it is. Only he would know how it tastes.
John had showered barely an hour ago, but even so. Sherlock’s mouth moves down, slowly, taking a maddening route over John’s skin until his breath is fanning over where John wanted it most desperately.
Those dark blue eyes are wide and stormy, watery with uncertainty. Seeing the shaken man pulls Sherlock back from his feral state. He stalks towards the doctor who is suddenly the only thing he can focus on. The Alpha yelling
Fighting with John wasn’t fun anymore. He rarely argued back and almost never got angry at him. It was not okay.
Watching John blissed out and wanton and used on his mattress beneath him has Sherlock so on edge that a few firm thrusts against his pliant body is enough for him to reach release, spilling semen all over John’s hip and stomach. He knows he’ll pay for it later when John chews him out for it, but for now John just look so perfect covered in Sherlock’s spunk.
John stopped in his tracks and shot a glare in the general direction of the infuriatingly patronizing voice. “I’m bored, Sherlock. You of all people should know what it’s like.”
“I-“ He doesn’t want to leave John here, stiff and pale against the cheap tiles. He straightens up and looks at his hands, confused by their need to reach out and soothe his friend. “I don’t want to leave you here.” John’s head snaps up, a tense ‘what?’ leaving his mouth. Sherlock looks to John, his silver eyes cutting John to the core, fingers twisted in the cloth of his trousers to keep from reaching out to the omega “I want to take care of you.”
