“Uh-huh.” Cas nodded sternly, hands reaching out through the bars to grasp the waist of Dean’s pants, long fingers running along the waistband before sharply tugging him closer. Inches away, he could feel the heat of the other man’s breath ghost across his lips when he spoke. “Know what I think, Dean?”
“Because he believes in my mission.” Cas shrugged, finishing the scotch in his glass and picking up the bottle to pour another.
“Turn over, baby,” he whispered into the skin of Dean’s boneless body. He obeyed, rolling over slowly to lie on his back. Castiel’s breathed hitched when he saw the other man—his cock hard and leaking against his stomach. Dean was obviously embarrassed, lifting a hand to cover himself that Castiel just batted away, smirking, “You like it when I touch your body, don’t you? Like it when I worship you?”
Dean nodded in understand. “And when Lucifer starts acting all sketchy thinking Michael’s gone and killed his favorite henchman, Alastair—”
Gabriel exhaled tiredly. “Don’t let your bitch keep you up much later, we need you clear tomorrow morning.”
“I believe his actual words were, ‘keep that idjit from haulin’ his sorry ass in here’. He swore a bunch when Vic tried to say you knew the guy best.”
Dean tried to swallow down the bile building up in his throat. “I’ll go, uh, see if Vic needs any help.” He stuttered out, stumbling over to the ambulance still idling in the parking lot. This couldn’t have been Cas, no way. It had to be a coincidence or something his Cas couldn’t do this, couldn’t kill those men like that. The voice in his head reminded him unhelpfully that the man he was sleeping with was a dangerous criminal first, lover second.
If it were possible to die from embarrassment, Castiel would have been seriously concerned for Dean, as his entire body succumbed to a series of violent blushes. “M-my, um, my,” his eyes darted to the floor again as he muttered, “my hole,” so quietly it was barely audible.
“More like who.” His grin was cocky again and he leaned in to whisper. “Do this one small favour for me and I’ll give you Alastair.”
“I definitely pictured something a little more Dracula than,” he gestured toward the peaceful suburban street and smiled sheepishly.
“Don’t even think about trying that again.” He snapped, face flushing slightly as his mind brought him back to the interrogation room, to the sound of Cas moaning above him, to the raw feel of his lips after sucking his cock.
The whole time, though, he maintained a firm grip on the man’s body, helping to set a pace that worked for both of them. Dean was quickly working himself into a frenzy of pleasure, from above him, he could hear lewd, desperate, barely human sounds. Eventually, he leaned back so that one hand was resting on Castiel’s stomach while the other clutched the back of the couch. The position must have been even more of a strain for the man’s body but it allowed him to touch more skin and, as Castiel started to suck on Dean’s rim, he felt the tips of fingers touching his neglected cock.
“Hey Cas.” Dean was standing so close he could practically feel the man’s breath on his neck, making him shiver.
It still took a few minutes for Castiel to actually get out of the car, every time he tried one of them would pull the other back in for one more kiss. The second he had actually made it to his room he locked the door and collapsed on his bed before finally pulling out his phone.
“Oh, um, sorry to wake you Dean,” Kevin’s voice crackled out through the receiver, sounding almost panicked.
Dean would be fine—it was better like this. He ran a gentle hand through the man’s hair, watching a sweet unconscious smile pull across his lips.
“No. No. You did not let yourself get caught—you would never do that!” He shouted, taking a step back. “It makes no sense!”
As they approached, she turned, smiling enormously as her eyes raked over Castiel’s body. “Hey there, Clarence.” She drawled, leaning back against the bar and stretching her arms out, showing off her body.
I'm so sorry this took so long to post, so to make it up to you I tried to write a long chapter. Unfortunately, the next chapter will probably also take a little more than a week because of exams!
He cringed; whatever it was that he’d forgotten was probably better left that way. If Sammy had come over last night it was pretty much guaranteed that they’d talked about—well, someone he did not want to be thinking about right now. “Dean it’s,” Sam started, clearly mistaking the look on his face for something else, “I don’t think you’re a bad person.”
“We got two civilians that made it out of the blood bath, as far as we can tell they were abducted and some mystery vigilante took out Alastair’s whole entourage. Rescued ‘em but we ain’t sure why. Don’t think they were the reason this all happened though, think they just got lucky.”
“You think you’re going to stop me from taking what’s mine?” Castiel growled, the shadows on his face making the words sound ever more threatening.
“Lighten up, Cassie! I’m only teasing you. I’m happy you’re screwing detective sexy,” He paused, “I mean, Balthazar owes me like twenty bucks because you were too busy to come by last night.” Gabriel practically sung the words he was so pleased with himself.
? What if this was his only chance and they’d stop talking altogether if he wasn’t good, didn’t know what he was doing?
“Kevin,” Anna said calmly before anyone else had a chance to eschew his request, “and of course you can tell your brother, right Castiel?”
“Would you just shut up for a second?” Dean grabbed his hands, pulling them to his lips and kissing each finger softly. “You deserve my attentions.” Castiel watched the other man kiss both his palms, “My affections,” he pressed a series of kisses down his forearms.
“If he is plotting against you, planning to take over, then you need to strike first. You’ll control his assets entirely. It’s the cleanest way to deal with this situation.”
“My respect,” he said, continuing his assault of kisses. “My admiration,” he punctuated the word by leaning up to kiss Castiel’s neck. Dean then pushed him back into the couch, climbing into his lap. “My devotion,” he pressed kisses up his neck and mouthed at his jawline, slowly grinding their hips together.
“You were so good today. So good for me.” The words were hot on his sweaty skin, making him preen and arch his back. The other man sighed above him, driving his fingers in deeper. “Want to reward you, gorgeous. Never would have escaped without you.”
“You’re doing it again.” Anna ruffled his hair before gathering up her books and making for the door. “Don’t stare at him too long, kiddo. You still have homework to do.”
All it took was a sharp twist of his wrist and Dean was coming all over Cas’ hand, a broken and wordless sob spilling from his lips. The other man continued to stroke him through his orgasm, milking him for everything it was worth. He thrust a few more times before joining Dean, filling him with more of his come. They stayed like that for a minute, just breathing as Cas’ cock softened and slipped free.
It was around four in the morning when the shrill ring of a phone sent him jolting upright, hand reaching for the gun he kept in the nightstand. Still groggy with sleep despite the adrenalin running through his body, Dean took a minute to take in his surroundings and an even longer time to realize that the phone was what woke him. Grumbling to himself about the time, he padded down the hallway to living room, answering a little more aggressively than necessary.
“Cas.” He gasped. “Cas, I, can I—ah—want to kiss you. Please, I—” Cas leaned down to crush their lips together, licking his way inside Dean’s mouth. The kiss was hot and desperate; the way their tongues slid together making Dean shiver and press himself into Cas’ firm, warm body. He let himself go pliant under the other man as he licked and bit and sucked Dean’s lips swollen and raw.
“Okay.” Dean said, surprisingly steadily, nodding when Castiel offered to pour him another drink. “Okay. What’s your mission?”
The way Dean said his name called up that possessiveness again and he found himself panting, “See what I can do for you, baby, when you’re good? See how I can make you feel?” His hand started to move faster but still too slow for Dean to finish. “Do you like being my good boy?”
,” Dean snapped his pencil in two. The music continued to float undaunted through the thin walls of his carrel, the shitty concrete box of an office he’d been given in the library. Though, really, to call it an office was a gross mischaracterization of what amounted to a 4x4 prison cell whose only redeeming feature was the illusion of privacy. The promise of space away from dickhead undergrads and group project meetings and every other kind of obnoxious distraction.
“Maybe we should continue this conversation tomorrow,” Balthazar interjected, mercifully stopping a fight from breaking out, “after everyone’s had a chance to sleep.”
, he was off at KU going to swim meets and frat parties and getting tagged in half naked pictures with inadequate privacy settings! That was the natural order, he was not supposed to come back and get a job ten minutes away!
“You told your brother about me?” Castiel felt his own skin color and he coughed to cover up the sudden awkwardness, not sure why the thought of Dean telling Sam about him made him feel so embarrassed, so excited.
“There’s more blood than there should be,” Dean commented, turning away from the mess and quickly stepping back outside. “Are there—did you find any others?” He asked, distantly worried about how much belonged to Cas.
“I know, gorgeous—you’ll take whatever I give you. But you’ve been so good for me, so perfect, I think you could use a reward. Is this what you want?” Dean nodded minutely and Castiel smiled, “Come here, baby.” He motioned for the man to climb on top of him.
“Yes!” Dean shouted, hips trying desperately to push up into Castiel’s tight fist. But Castiel’s body was too strong, keeping him still.
Castiel lifted his hand from the phone receiver, letting his head flop down into his hands to bury himself away, hiding his disgusting display of emotion. It wasn’t until he felt the soft press of lips against his forehead that he looked up. Green eyes wide with concern hovered an inch from his face. Dean was kneeling on the ground in front of him.
“Yeah, yeah, Cassie. Look, Deano. Michael is one bad son of a bitch and Lucifer makes Mikey look like an angel. I think you probably already knew that.” Gabriel said seriously.
Castiel sat in his car, breathing heavily with his forehead on the steering wheel. He longed for Dean’s comfort, even though he knew he didn’t deserve it. In some ways, he thought, it would have been easier to die. It would have been better if Michael had simply ended his life, liberated him from this guilt.
Only a half hour later, all hope of a peaceful afternoon was lost when a man crouched in front of him, his perfectly proportioned shadow blocking out the sun. “Cat’s Cradle?” The shadow drawled, “I’m more of a Slaughter House Five kinda guy, myself.” Castiel snapped up so fast it felt like his neck might break and oh
Castiel hummed, skimming a hand down to the soft patch of hair above Dean’s thick, hard cock. He laughed breathlessly, wondering if the man had been hard since he fingered himself open—body not even willing to disobey an order while he was asleep. “Want you,” he licked a stripe across the man’s neck, eliciting a shiver. “You were so good, waiting all night to come. You want that now? Want your reward, baby?”
And with that they walked silently and awkwardly toward Dean’s car. Needless to say, driving to the hospital after humiliating himself once again in front of Dean was not what he’d imagined his first time in the Impala.
“Yeah. I guess not.” Dean muttered into his drink, feeling the way Castiel’s eyes were trained on him, boring into him, but he refused to look back up.
“He’s very sick. I was wondering if you could check in on him and perhaps bring him some flowers. He had some trouble last night and I’m afraid he’s feeling a bit—” Castiel swallowed, worry crashing down on him, “like death today.” He finally spat out. “I—I’m terrible worried.”
“Actually, it’s a workspace.” Castiel gestured dismissively to the door. “Kindly leave so I can resume working in it.”
There was a loud scuffling noise, followed by what sounded like yelling and then someone shouting, “Balls!”
"Not yet, baby,” he panted. “Want to make this last. Want it to be so good for you, gorgeous." Castiel ran his fingers tenderly through the other man’s soft hair, stroked a thumb over his kiss swollen lips.
Castiel’s head cocked to the side again and his eyes raked over Dean like he was contemplating. “Do you want to please me, Dean?”
“Oh,” A look of worry crossed the other man’s face. “Be careful,” he said, stepping out of the car and walking around to the driver’s side.
They didn’t talk except for the few directions he gave to guide them to his house. The quiet in the impala felt cold and he half expected Dean to just throw him out of the moving car when got to his house. Instead, the man actually parked the car, pulling all the way into his driveway. Everything was silent for a while longer before Castiel finally couldn’t take it anymore. “I’m sorry about the other day.” He said, staring at where his hands were folded on his lap. “For running away like that.”
Castiel opened his mouth more fully so he could breathe hotly down Dean’s thick length, never quite letting his lips touch the harden flesh. It wasn’t until he felt the head hit the back of his throat that he finally closed his lips, pressing them tightly together and dragging back up to the tip.
“So you make him think Michael is making a statement and you make Mike think Lucifer is the one tryna mess with him.” He paused, thinking. “Then you pretend to kill Gabriel and Anna because they’re close to Michael? I don’t get it.”
Castiel stretched, spreading his body across the small bed and listening to the pop of muscles stiff from sleeping at an awkward angle. From down the hall there were sounds of the tap running followed by a bubbling popping sound he couldn’t quite identify. He was half hard and wondered idly whether he could get a blowjob. It was highly likely that he could but he decided to forgo asking for Dean’s sake. Judging by the orderly state of the apartment, it was a pretty safe bet the man was big on punctuality too.
It didn’t take a detective to see that there’d been some kind of struggle. Blood was everywhere inside, splattered across the walls, pooled on the floor, and—oh god, yeah—covering the small pile of bodies in the center a few feet away from where they were standing. “What happened here?” Benny asked, the first to break their horrified silence.
“And Lucifer knows that, doesn’t he?” Castiel nodded. “Just like I’m sure he knows exactly the type of killer Uriel is.”
“Good.” They smiled at each other again before finally pulling apart. “I should probably go inside.”
Castiel grimaced as he pulled into the large driveway, allowing himself a moment of composure before following the path up to the main entrance. The door was large and ornate and he couldn’t help rolling his eyes every time his fingers wrapped around the pretentious brass knocker. Barely a second passed before the door was creaking open to reveal Uriel’s solemn face, glaring out at him.
His heart sunk when he saw the glow of light under the door and he pushed it open slowly, trying to make as little sound as possible. Inside his eyes immediately landed on the other man, pouring two glasses of whiskey. Those of feelings of suspicion and fear crept up his skin and the voice at the back of his head started shouting, begging, reminding him that Castiel was murderer, a violent criminal. Turn back, call for help, go, go, go! But despite the, frankly, good advice his subconscious was yelling, his feat remained planted in place. After having seen those bodies, the state of Alastair in the hospital, it was more difficult than ever to reconcile the man humming in his kitchen with the brutal killer on wanted posters. Somehow, despite it all, his body seemed drawn to Cas so instead of calling for help, he just stood there like an idiot.
“Uh-huh,” Dean grinned and Castiel bent forward to cover that grin in kisses. They pulled away again, laying back and quietly staring at one another until Dean’s hand came up to tentatively rest on his cheek. Castiel leaned into it, closing his eyes as the man stoked his cheek affectionately. “This is nice.” Dean said. “I wish—I wish it could always be like this.”
Dean was humiliated but too hard to think properly, so he just started rutting against Cas again, biting back desperate moans as he worked himself closer and closer to his own orgasm. The room was silent except for the noises falling from his mouth, and he could feel the hot weight of Cas’s complete attention on his back.
It was probably only a few minutes but it felt like hours as he sat, body tense and nervous, clutching the gun to his chest. When the doorknob started turning, he let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. This was it, all other thoughts stop as his mind focused on the slow turn of the knob, the creaking sound of the door being pushed open. His temples throbbed, hands growing clammy around the cool metal of the gun. Everything was in slow motion as the door finally swung open.
Once everyone was caught up, though, the two of them simply absorbed the conversation more stoic than he’d ever seen them. Anna was cordial but also maintained a distance from the newcomers and Castiel realized that his siblings and friend were doing this purposefully. Don’t get attached to civilians, Chuck’s words suddenly looping through his mind. It was the first rule—never attach yourself to a free man, never drag them into the criminal life.
“Oh, because, I want to see them burn” Gabriel said, in an exaggerated mockery of Castiel’s voice that made Dean snort, “isn’t melodramatic at all.”
“These ones were my favourite too.” He spoke softly, mostly to himself, hand still gently rubbing Dean’s dick. He was starting to get hard again and was thinking about pulling away when Cas said, “It would be too bad if I left with you still mad about last time.” Voice husky and low, “Think I should try to earn your forgiveness.” His fingers pressed harder against Dean’s cock, making him shiver. “What do you think? Would you like that, baby?”
“I can wait!” Dean snapped, looking worriedly at Castiel for a second before laying his head back down. “I can be good,” he mumbled, blush practically audible as he nuzzled against Castiel’s chest.
Cas let out a breath of air, face as stony as ever, and Dean wondered for a moment whether he’d crossed some kind of line. Slowly the man Castiel raised his hand and wrapped his fingers tightly over Dean’s on the gun, using both their hands to set the gun down gently on a shelf.
“I, um.” His eyes darted away, looking anywhere but Dean. “I didn’t want you know that I hadn’t ever,” he waved his hand around vaguely, “before.”
Then he was gone, out with his stupid friend doing god knows what for god knows what reason and leaving Dean alone in an apartment that suddenly felt much too big for one person. To stave off the loneliness he let himself collapse back into bed on Cas’ side and wrapped himself up in the still warm blankets. They smelled like him, like the ocean or a thunderstorm, something powerful and daunting.
“He does.” It was hard to resist smiling as Dean figured out their plan on his own. He was strangely proud of the man, wanted nothing more than to kiss every inch of him.
“A stalemate, yeah. Think about it—make their power base too weak and insecure to keep its lesser members, take-out the big bosses somehow.”
Cas hummed, pleased by Dean’s reaction. “Depending on how well you suck me, I might just spill all my little secrets.” He smirked, catching Dean’s gaze. “And with sinful lips like yours,” he whistled, low and filthy, “I don’t doubt you’ll get every last one me out of me.”
“Ah, sorry man! I totally interrupted you didn’t I?” He stood up, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. Castiel swallowed, Dean was wearing the shortest and reddest pair of swim trunks he’d ever seen, thick muscles practically bulging out of them. “Couldn’t help myself when I saw the book.”
Silence again, this time it set Castiel on edge. “Okay,” Dean yawned, “promise you’ll wake me up before you go.”
The phone cut out before he could say anything else. Castiel sighed, slumping onto the couch and wishing desperately for the day to be over already. The meeting with Michael was most unsettling. If he’d somehow figured out what they were doing—this would be it, he’d die today and nothing would change, everything would have been a waste.
“Dean, I said no!” Castiel snapped, pushing away completely and sitting up straight. He was breathing hard, heart pounding in his chest.
After that things went back to normal. It was unusually hot and, since someone else was definitely working, it seemed safe enough to actually go swimming. The second they were in the water, Charlie started this slowly escalating splash war. Laughing, Castiel climbed onto the small diving board threatening to deliver the splash to end all splashes. He was just at the edge, bouncing slightly when brown hair and tanned skin caught his attention. Sure enough, Dean was talking to Jo.
“I’m not his pet!” Dean growled, clenching his fists at his sides. Castiel gave him a dangerous look and he reluctantly settled.
“Unless we cut out his tongue and gouge his eyes.” Gabriel practically sang, waggling his eyebrows at Dean who in turn gave Castiel a panicked look.
They stared at each other for a moment, his friend’s face full of pity and understanding. “I think you let our friend The Angel escape couple ‘a months back an’ he’s out spying on the big bads for ya’ now.”
Dean kept his head bowed, nodding slightly. That was all the encouragement Castiel needed; he chucked again as he thrust his hips a little closer.
“Even better than I ima-a-gined though, you’re such a—fuck—good boy, take my cock so—ah—perfectly. Look so—yes, fuck—perfect split open, begging for it harder, deeper.” Cas moaned one more time and then Dean’s body was seizing up and he was shouting as he came all over his stomach and the wall. Distantly he heard Cas saying, “Fuck, did you just come?” before crying out a litany of oh fuck and so hot and dean dean dean.
“You think you’re an expert, pretty?” His breath was hot and wet, sending a shiver through Dean’s body. “Think you know something about me?” The grip on his ankle tightened, keeping his legs spread as Cas pulled back enough so there bodies weren’t pressed together anymore. If he hadn’t been terrified, he might have tried to chase the warm weight as it left him. Instead, he just trembled slightly, the room suddenly almost too cold to bear.
His brother scoffed. “For you maybe, but how do any of us know we can trust him? Besides, we already have an inside man. Two is a crowd.”
“I think you still want me to touch you,” as he spoke, one of his hands slipped further down to palm Dean’s erection through the fabric of his pants. “And, I think,” Cas yanked Dean just a little closer, forcing his face to press so far into the bars that Cas could have kissed him if he’d wanted to, “you still want to touch me, too.”
He scrubbed every inch of the apartment until his hands were raw, body actually aching from the strain of it. It was late by the time he finished, sometime around nine—everything should be set, ready for the following day. Dean had called a few hours before to let him know that everything had gone smoothly on his end, and about an hour prior Balthazar had rung to inform him that Anna and Gabriel were considered well and truly dead. It was only a matter of time before his friend would sneak into the hospital and retrieve them and then, tomorrow, the news of their murder would be released.
Castiel was shocked by how well their plan was working. He’d expected to die today, that he’d walked into this house only to find that Michael had known of his plan all along. Never had he imagined that Michael would fall apart so easily, so completely. The man was a disaster.
He sat there like that so a long time, drinking himself into the ground. Eventually he found his way to the phone. It seemed like such a good idea as he collapsed on the floor, pressing his face to the receiver.
He berated himself quietly. Somewhere in the sex and lust and novelty of being with Cas he’d let himself forget what this man really was, what he was capable of doing. He couldn’t believe that he’d taken comfort in him, that he’d wanted to debase himself to please him. He felt like he was going to throw up. Had it really somehow been his fault that Cas had escaped? The worse part about that line of thought wasn’t even that he might have let a criminal escape but that Cas had used him, that all of this was just a game.
Dean ran the length of Castiel’s sides, slipping both hands under his arms and pulling them over his head. The next thing he knew, those warm wet hands were pressing into his back, forcing him to arch it and bring their bodies even closer. “Wanna keep your back like this,” fingertips traced the curve of his spine, making his knees quiver.
“Ever been eaten out?” Dean’s heart nearly stopped and his whole body went rigid. Cas hummed, “Guess not.” Before he had a chance to respond, Dean felt something wet and warm lick a stripe across his hole. This time, he did yelp, body trying to jerk away. Cas laughed, arms circling Dean through the bars to hold him in place while he lapped at his hole.
“Fine, fine.” She yawned, “Look. I don’t know much—his boys haven’t said anything. Something big is going down tonight. The boys are gathering after hours, so his scariness will be here in the flesh. That’s everything.”
“What’s your brother going to do with police chief Bobby?” Balthazar asked, leaning back in his chair.
Blood rushed to Dean’s face and pounded in his ears. His eyes slipped involuntarily to the barely visible bulge in Castiel’s suit pants. “Um,” he said dumbly, his mouth suddenly too dry to speak.
The man actually scoffed at him, face contorting into the most condescending smile he’d ever seen. “Dean,” he breathed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “After fours years chasing me. After four years trying to catch me doing anything even the slightest bit illegal—you never wondered? Never thought that it was all a bit too easy?”
“Cas,” The man sounded worried. “I-I can’t. I have, I have to be at work in twenty min-nutes.” Even as he protested, though, he was moving closer, dropping to the floor between Castiel’s thighs.
With one last aching look at his heavy cock, Dean padded back toward the bed with a cloth to wipe up his come. As he worked to wipe it up, Castiel reached a hand up to run through his short brown hair now damp with sweat. Despite his clear distress, Dean leaned into the touch though he refused to meet Castiel’s gaze. “What’s wrong, gorgeous?” He asked, turning the man to face him
The moment his mouth was free he leaned up to kiss Dean fervently, gasping when the other man sucked the taste of his own release from his tongue. Castiel moaned, his erection brushing against the detective’s thigh. Dean reached his hand between their bodies, wrapping eager fingers around Castiel’s cock.
Dean’s eyes were scrunched shut so tightly he knew he’d see spots the next time he opened them. The sound of Cas’ jerking himself off, the sound of his voice as he moaned and talked was all too much. A steady stream of precome was falling from his cock to the ground, dick twitching and straining, begging for attention. He wanted to scream, the pressure building and building in his body. His legs were trembling, muscles coiling tightly, a heat starting in his stomach and oh god—
Dean was too tired, too boneless to argue. He could feel Castiel’s come starting to run down his leg and all he could think about was going home and collapsing. A part of him worried about leaving Cas alone with Victor, wanted to take him home and protect him, but he shook the thought from his mind. Cas was a bad guy who didn’t care about anyone but himself, didn’t care who he hurt as long as he got what he wanted.
“Don’t be mean, he just wants to impress Dean’s family.” Anna tried to help, but just made him feel more humiliated, ashamed.
“Regardless, taking care of Lucifer will bring you more power and a greater empire. You can use this to reign in any possible defectors.”
“I think they wanted—I think they meant to take Anna but I was causing a scene so they just took me too.”
There was nothing left to do but wait so Castiel made his way over to the couch and collapsed, closing his eyes to the sound of the radio flickering out through tinny speakers. It was a nearly recognizable program, something fairly popular about a family maybe. As the story unfolded, he found himself slipping further and further into unconsciousness. By the time a few programs had cycled through he was nearly asleep, so out of it that he missed the creak of the door opening.
With his hand on Castiel’s shoulders Michael led them out of the kitchen, past Uriel’s scowling face, and toward the drawing room. “I was starting to fear that you’d left me for good.” He said, smiling and shaking his head in disbelief.
“Hey Cas,” he breathed, hovering so far into Castiel’s personal space that for a brief second he thought Dean might be leaning in for a kiss. What a disaster that would have been! Still, he couldn’t help his disappointment when the man simply laid a hand on his back to urge him toward the table. “You guys can sit wherever and then I’ll, uh, I’ll introduce everyone.” He smiled sheepishly at Castiel, who remained professionally distant only nodding curtly to acknowledge that the man had spoken.
“Kick is good. Let’s work on your arms.” It was probably all in his head but the man sounded even rougher than he did, eyes practically smouldering as they raked over Castiel’s body. He was completely pliant as Dean positioned him so that they were standing within an inch of each other. It was too much—Charlie’s words kept looping around in his head, making him dizzy.
The sound of Kevin’s footsteps as he wandered away from the interrogation room was a fucking miracle and for a moment he was so lost in the feeling of relief that he forgot why it
He tossed his phone to the side and closed his eyes, smiling up at the ceiling. “Dean Winchester,” he whispered out loud, letting the name bounce off the walls and fill the empty room with a chorus of
Their eyes locked in the mirror and, without any protest or further instruction, Dean bent over so that his chest was pressed against the cold counter and ass in the air to give Castiel a good view. It was easy to imagine how hard those perky little nipples were getting against the cold granite and, given his unusual sensitivity in that area, Castiel could imagine how much it was increasing his pleasure.
Dean jumped at the force of it and seconds later officers were filing into the room, ready to haul Cas back to his cell.
He laughed, stilling Dean’s movements with the touch of his hand. “You want this?” He asked, punctuating the question by dipping the head of his cock inside and then pulling back out, repeating the motion until Dean was a wreck beneath him.
“Kevin?” Dean laughed, “Kevin Tran is your inside man? Guess that’s why you needed me, kid’s barely even an officer.”
“Okay, Cas.” He mumbled tiredly, eyes slipping closed to indulge in the soft touches. Castiel could have stood there all night petting him, lavishing his body with tender caresses, but this was neither the place nor the time.
“You working for Bobby now?” He teased, trying to lighten the mood and convey how totally, perfectly fine everything was.
He pulled out his phone and started typing, fingers smashing down on the screen way harder than necessary.
Finally, Michael sighed. “You’ve never been very good at telling jokes, have you?” He said, chuckling sadly. “You’re the only one I can trust right now, the only person that I can depend on.”
“Dean. I can’t afford to let anyone question my directions. If you want to be apart of this, then you will obey me wholly. I will not tolerate any less.” His speech was a little heavy handed but he needed to test the other man’s obedience. The thought of such a total submission sent shivers down his spine and he had to fight for control over his expression, not wanting to betray his excitement.
He tapped his pencil on a battered copy of The Crying of Lot 49, breathing deep and slow and steady. This was fine, this would be fine. Every week it was the same: the guy chose a song and then played it for eight hours straight, and every week Dean survived. The noise was a mild inconvenience anyway, a hazard of working in the library—there was no reason to get upset about things you couldn’t change. No reason to get upset about people doing inconsiderate, un-fucking-believably selfish—
Dean huffed, bringing a hand up to run tentatively through Castiel’s hair. “How come you didn’t tell me Gabriel was your brother?”
“Don’t hate the playa.” She grinned, pressing a quick kiss to head before running off and leaving him all alone with—
His fingers continued to move, working the knots and exhaustion out with firm, steady touches. Dean groan inadvertently above him and Castiel smiled lopsidedly, feeling a burst of warmth and affection run through him. This hadn’t been the plan, he hadn’t intended on touching Dean like this, it just happened. He was pretty sure he hadn’t touched anyone like this ever and wasn’t even sure why he started doing it now. It felt good to press firmly along the soles of the other man’s feet, to use his thumbs to make Dean whine.
“I should have turned you in. I should have just come clean about everything and turned you in.” Dean shouted. “Do you even understand the pain you’ve caused? How much your actions have cost the department? Do you?” For some reason, tears were prickling in his eyes and his body trembled under the force of his anger.
“He was a phantom of delight,” he mumbled into Dean’s neck between tender kisses, not even aware of what he was saying until it was said.
Fingers traced the line of his jaw, green eyes searching every inch of his face for something. “Cas,” Dean breathed, frowning with concern. “Who do you think you’re pretending to be?”
Dean didn’t look up until he felt the bed dip. Cas had taken his pants off again and was crawling up the bed toward him, a soft almost affectionate expression on his face. “Okay.” He breathed before leaning forward to capture Dean’s lips in a kiss. The slow slide of tongue was meant to be comforting not arousing, and he let himself melt into it. “Since you were so good, baby,” he spoke the words between kisses, whispering them into Dean’s skin. “So good,” he murmured again and again.
When they got to the bed Cas deposited him on the side without a wet spot and stroked a hand through his hair. “Such a good boy,” he murmured, pressing a soft kiss to the top of his head before walking away down the hall.
“Then one day he just up and starts slashing people bloody? And starts with Alastair Rolston? I mean, Dean, the guy is definitely one of the high ups in the Hell’s Army, it can’t be a coincidence.”
“Your—your cock. Want your big,” he moaned as Castiel fed him another inch, “—ah, your big cock inside me.”
“And that hole.” He groaned, “God it’s so tight, baby. Almost came the second I stuffed my cock inside you.” Dean’s arms hurt from how tightly he was gripping them behind his head, his cock aching painfully between his legs. Behind him, Cas was making the most beautiful sounds and he could picture the head of his cock disappearing in and out of his fist. His teeth dug painfully into his lip as he tried to stop himself from making any sounds.
Standing at the door, he hesitated and pinched the bridge of his nose. One last indulgence, he decided, heading back toward the bedroom. Dean looked so beautiful, features soft and vulnerable. Castiel quickly scribbled out a note, feeling like there was nothing he could say that wouldn’t feel inadequate.
The car settled into a sort of tense, uneasy silence and it was clear that Balthazar was trying to stop himself from saying something. They’d only been driving for ten minutes when Dean finally fell asleep, cheek pressed against the window and warm breath causing condensation to form on the glass. Castiel had to stop himself from sighing. Dean was so beautiful like that—still flushed from earlier, eyelashes splayed over freckled cheeks, lips relaxed and parted. It was nearly impossible to keep his eyes trained on the road, to pull his gaze away from the sweet man resting in the back seat.
“Yeah. You’re gonna love this—we found Alastair tied to a post inside, all bloodied up. Man was barely alive.”
“I just want to look professional. We need these people on our side and they are not likely to aid criminals—”
When he finally glanced up Dean was smiling sheepishly back at him, a soft blush staining freckled cheeks. There was something so hopeful and nervous in his boyish expression, leaving Castiel utterly breathless.
I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who's still reading this! It was only supposed to be a one shot and now it's getting out of control. There will be more plot things in the next chapter!
The next thirty minutes passed in a blur of crying and slurred words as Dean stumbled through the whole story. At the time it felt amazing, finally telling someone the truth—telling Sammy the truth. He told him about the arrest, the escape, their deal, probably a few inappropriate comments about the sex, and finally he talked about their fight. By the end he was so emotionally drained, raw from the crying and the alcohol, that all he wanted to do was collapse.
The house was large and old, sitting just on the edge of town. Michael was definitely one for theatrics and the aesthetics of the house more than lived up to his personality. It even looked about as polished and sinister as the man himself. Windows like gleaming eyes, the play of archway and shadow making it seem almost permanently smug. Not even the perfectly maintained flowerbeds or kindly stone pathway could alter the sinister countenance of the house, or the man.
Taking it as the sign of encouragement that it was, Dean lean forward and pressed their lips together in this slow, tender kiss. Castiel parted his lips for the other man and moaned slightly when their tongues finally slid together. It was an easy kiss, more exploratory than anything that had happened before. Clearly, Dean wanted to learn how to please him, how he liked to be kissed, to be touched. No one had ever tried to do this; no one had ever cared enough to bother.
The word went right to Dean’s dick, now soft in his come soaked underwear. He flushed a little, knowing deep down that he’d go. Something was wrong with him, something truly fucking broken because he couldn’t help himself. The way Cas talked to him, the way he’d just demanded
“O-okay,” the relief must have been visible on his face because the lifeguard let out another laugh, clapping his shoulder. Maybe this was just a lesson after all, he thought, taking a deep breath and plunging into the cool water.
“Then all of a sudden the car stopped and the men got out. There was screaming but we just stayed right there in the car. After a while it was quiet. Then you guys showed up.”
By the time he finally rolled up to Michael’s he felt serene, or perhaps just numb, his emotions firmly tamped down. The house appeared dark, silent, almost like it had been abandoned altogether. There was something about the blackened windows that did sit well with him, launching a small tremor through him. In all the years he’d been coming here, it had never been so quiet.
Dean moved toward the kitchen table, all but collapsing in the chair, eyes still trained on the bag in his hand. Taking a deep breath, he unrolled the top and looked at its contents. It was coffee. Amazing, delicious, beautiful smelling coffee, quite possibly the best thing he’d ever smelled. He sniffed it again to make sure and—oh yeah—that was good.
Castiel closed his eyes, trying not reign in all unnecessary emotions. Knowing Gabriel, any emotional response would only prolong the teasing. He took a deep, steadying breath before pushing forward. “He agreed to the terms, Alastair for the gun. He wants the man first, though.”
Dean tapped his pen impatiently, eyes starring out at nothing. He was trying not to think about what had just happened or, more accurately, was trying not to think about what might happen again. How Castiel might look with his soft, plush lips stretched wide around Dean’s cock, or the kind of filthy things he’d say as he jerked him—
“You don’t know anything about the guy. Give him some credit,” after a moment she added, “and give yourself some, too.”
Castiel smirked, sucking at the base of Dean’s needy prick and eliciting the sweetest little moans and sighs. Unexpectedly, he felt the dull drag of fingers as they weaved through his hair, tugging lightly like a demand to suck harder.
A whimper caught in his throat and he found himself nodding. “Yeah? You want me to do something for you, to make you feel good?” He was leaning in closer to Dean, gently pushing him back and climbing overtop of him until they pressed completely together, mouths inches from each other. “What do you want, gorgeous. Tell me what you need.”
“This is it? This is your big, secret criminal liar?” Dean motioned to house in disbelief, like he was angry it looked so plain.
Being already in a desperate state himself, he didn’t spend much time teasing and after a few seconds lavishing attention on the man’s cock, Castiel tapped his thighs to indicate that he should move further up. “Come on, baby, I can’t lick your hole like this.”
“You just,” the man stumbled, still refusing to look anywhere but the floor, “you looked so good, I—I couldn’t help myself. I’m really sorry.”
there was no reason to do this—but he couldn’t stop. His fingers trembled, taking much longer to undo the zipper and drag Cas’s slacks and underwear down enough to free his erection. It was the first time he’d ever seen a man like this, and the sight made his stomach twist into knots. He licked his lips, letting out a shaky breath as he stared at the flushed head of another man’s cock.
“For what?” Dean mumbled absently as Cas pulled back, eyes lashes fluttering back open to meet the man’s gaze.
He glared and snatched the computer back, facing turning eight shades of red in the process. “I was just reading an article he posted—”
“I think.” Dean murmured against his chest, hot breath puffing out against him. “I think I don’t want to share you.”
Something in the way he spoke seemed to settle the anxiety that’d built up, like the soft admission served to cement their new relationship. The thought made him giddy—Castiel really was his now, wanted this thing between them to work. So he was gonna leave in the middle of the night? This was normal, this could be normal. “Okay,” he said as casually as physically possible, even managing to fake a yawn, “promise you’ll wake me up before you go.”
Thankfully, the man nodded, eyes dark with his own arousal and lips parting eagerly. It was consent enough and Castiel grabbed a fistful of Dean’s hair with his free hand, pulling him onto his length so that those beautiful swollen lips were spread tightly around him. This was almost better than the first time just by virtue of having full use of his hands, being able to grab and push and hold Dean.
“Y-you.” He stuttered out, “Made to plea-ease you, C—ah—as.” Cas groaned, shoving a third finger in without any warning.
“Do you think I’m stupid? I ain’t cuttin’ you out of any investigation. You're comin’ in tomorrow to help but I don’t wanna see your ugly mug ‘round here until then. Got it?”
He opened his mouth to defend himself but gave up before accidentally digging his grave any deeper. On the screen a picture of a wet Dean Winchester in a dark blue speedo smiled back at him, all those miles of smooth, tanned skin making him sigh internally. Anna was right, he
Dean gasped as he came all over his fingers and the wall, laughing breathlessly as the water rinsed it down the drain. It took a few minutes to recover, slumping against the wall for support. Back in the bedroom, he started humming again as he stared contemplatively at the contents of the top drawer of his dresser. The panties, he let out a breath and stared, tracing the edges of their fine fabric with his fingertips.
The clock on the wall read 6:45, so he figured if they could finish this up in about five minutes Dean would still have enough time to get work without being too late. In an effort to finish as fast as possible, he grabbed the sides of the other man’s face and started fucking him in earnest. The head of his cock slammed into Dean’s throat again and again, making him choke and sputter.
They looked at each other for a moment. Silence settled in almost comfortably around them, despite the nervousness sending tremors through Castiel's body. Dean urged him forward, stopping to pull off the loose white tank top he’d been wearing and revealing that lean muscular torso that haunted Castiel’s dreams. He actually had to stop himself from groaning, instead focusing on getting in the water as fast as possible to minimize the time Dean had to consider his own imperfect body.
“Fine.” He hung up, tossing the phone across the room and then closed his eyes like if he couldn’t see what a disaster he was then neither would Sam. At some point in the twenty minutes it took his brother to get there, he’s fallen asleep. So it’s hardly his fault that when warm hands gently started shaking him awake he thought they belonged to someone else. “Cas?” He slurred hopefully, eyes still too bleary to make out the figure in front of him. “Sorry, Cas, ‘m so sorry I said that.”
Before he could say anything, though, Gabriel was talking again. “So, we’re all just happy go lucky about letting a bunch of strangers in on our business?”
Needless to say he was hard in his pants the entire day. Every time he’d move, the silk would shift and slide against his aching dick. In the interrogation room he’d accidentally moaned out loud after sitting down had caused some delicious friction. When it was finally time to leave he barely acknowledge anyone, nearly running two people over in the rush to get home, rip his work clothes off, and touch himself.
Dean swallowed, not sure what to do, not sure how he felt. “C-C-Cas?” He managed to stutter out, betraying his nerves. Cas’ smirked turned into a hungry grin, his eyes looked almost black in the dim light of the room.
“No,” he said, standing up to close the distance between them. “I wanted to deliver it in person. We had a deal, after all.” He smirked, inches away from the other man.
Dean bit his lip and suddenly Castiel was overcome with a possessive rage and he gripped Dean's jaw hard enough to leave a faint impression of fingertips. "What," he growled, "have I told you about keeping those sounds from me? They're mine, Dean. Don't you dare hide them from me." His fingers roughly pulled the man's jaw open, delighting in the lewd moan Dean made, eyes trained on Castiel's, wide and adoring. "Want to hear my baby sing for me."
They stayed like that for minutes or hours, Castiel had lost all track of time and obligation and duty—none of it mattered when Dean was firm and warm against him, a grounding weight that simultaneously made him feel light enough to float away.
Castiel paused, face grimacing in concern for a second before composing himself again. This was obviously information he hadn’t intended to give away. “Dean,” he warned.
“Is it?” He said, yawning sleepily and closing his eyes, sinking further into the comfort Dean brought.
Dean laughed, “You should see my brother’s puppy dog eyes. One look and he can get you to do anything. Bobby is a sucker for it and, ‘sides, I ain’t exactly been all that stable the last few months.”
“Be serious, please.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. “We have limited time to secure Alastair, and I need to make an appearance before Michael this afternoon.”
“Well, doesn’t matter.” He said, cutting off Castiel’s objection. “I’m sure you worked that little bitch of yours all ni—”
They wove through the maze of chairs and tables, heading toward the slender woman bent over the bar. She had long, curly black hair and was wearing nothing but a pair of dark red underwear and matching bra.
“Sam can take him out of town. He can say I was pretty upset about something and just took off on a bender.”
He laughed a strange over-exhausted kind of laugh. “Well, go then.” He smiled, “I’m gonna stay here a bit longer, I think.”
When he chanced a look behind him, he saw Cas sitting on the edge of the bed, watching Dean intently as he jerked himself off slowly. “Fuck you look good, gorgeous.” He called. “Love how hard that cute little prick gets for me.”
Dean moaned, head falling back in pleasure as his hands scrabbled to lace their fingers together. Castiel set a leisurely rhythm, indulging in the sensation of Dean’s dick slipping in and out of his throat. Precome and saliva dribbled down his chin as he sucked, and he groaned at the feeling.
“Baah, ba-AH.” Balthazar imitated some strange amalgam of a sheep and a moan that even made Anna cover her mouth in a laugh. The sight would have aggravated him further, but Balthazar’s face was unusually warm, a taunting smile playing at the corner of his lips. This wasn’t malicious, it was friendly and teasing and the thought was somehow satisfying.
Still, the whole thing made him smile and he found himself ducking his head so that Cas wouldn’t see. The come came off easily and he realized how much better he felt now that he was clean. Well, mostly clean. By the time he looked back up, though, Cas had already slid back into his slacks and was feeling around for his shirt.
There was a small sound, something that might have been a breath of relief, and then one hand was cradling his head securely while the other snaked around his waist. Dean held him like that for a moment, their bodies pressed tightly together. “Yeah,” he breathed, “but I guess it’s a little late for that anyway.”
Today was going to be a good day. In the shower, he rubbed his hands into a soapy lather and trailed them across his body, humming a little at the touch. With his eyes shut it was easy to imagine his fingers were Castiel’s, running teasingly across his torso, brushing against his nipples. It was early enough in the morning to spare a few minutes to do this properly, to build up all the tension in his body before finally grabbing his cock. He gasped as he jerked himself, imitating the other man’s rough, sure strokes.
“First off,” Dean began, clearly trying to shrug off his anger, “if I’m gonna help any of you chuckleheads, you’re gonna have to stop calling a dog.” After a moment, he turned to glared at Balthazar, “Or a lamb, dickbag.”
“I don’t know. Haven’t you had a million fantasies about this?” Heat crawled up his skin so fast he nearly fainted. “Probably something like that.”
All of the words that he wanted to say, his regrets and longings, the fantasies he rarely allowed himself, burned in his throat. This was his last chance to tell Dean everything, to tell him how special he was, how beautiful, but he couldn’t. Instead, he lifted himself up to kiss the man that he loved, softly, slowly. They rocked together, fingers tracing the lines of each other’s bodies as they lost themselves in each other.
Dean was determined now. He hollowed out his cheeks and sucked hard, mouth making obscene slurping and gagging noises the entire time. When he ran the flat of his tongue up and down the thick vein under the head of Cas’ cock, it made him hiss: “Yes, fuck don’t stop, I’m so close. Just like that—
He pinched the bridge of his nose, fuck. “That’s, it’s okay Anna. Just tell me what happened to Balthazar, we’ll figure Uriel out tomorrow?”
“Cas?” Dean hesitated, the last thing he wanted was to annoy the guy into changing his mind and besides he’d been enough of a freakin’ baby for one night, thank you very much. Still, he needed to know if Cas was gonna be there when he woke up. Call it intuition or whatever, but he felt this queasy sick sort of anxiety settling in, like his body was convinced it was going to wake up worried and alone.
Castiel yawned again and pulled away, “They’ll come around.” He was far enough away to look Dean in the eyes but not far enough to leave the warm circle of his arms. This intimacy wasn’t something he should allow but after being away from the man for so many days, after the hollow ache that accompanied their parting, Castiel found himself wanting to cling pathetically to him. “You can kiss me. If you want.” He murmured, leaning in again.
“L-love it when you mark me, love being y-yours.” He blushed, releasing the grip on Castiel’s hair. “Didn’t mean—m’sorry, Cas.”
Dean’s heart pounded in his chest as he struggled to regain basic brain function. He opened and close his mouth uselessly, fumbling for some kind of response. There was a litany of defiant and irritated
“Do you want anything else?” Castiel murmured, circling his hole and messaging his perineum with his thumb.
“Instead you’re going to creep his profile eight times a day and save all the gratuitously nude pictures?”
With a shudder, Dean came. Hot release filling Castiel’s mouth and spilling down his throat. He savoured the salty taste; suckling the man’s oversensitive cock, milking him for every last drop of come. It wasn’t until Dean was completely soft that he let the man slip from his lips.
On the stove a kettle popped and clicked as it boiled. A minute later the whistling started and he watched as Dean filled a percolator with the water.
It just looked so appetizing. Perfect and pink and already half hard from whatever Cas had been doing with himself in the shower. That thought made him flush, his body responding eagerly to images of hot water and soapy hands.
“Exactly.” He said, “I’ll be privy to all future plans concerning Lucifer and likely have influence in Michael’s decisions.”
Hopefully, Castiel would be in a position to encourage Michael to take action and, if everything went according to plan, Meg would warn Lucifer. They kill each other, leaving their criminal empires in disarray like chickens running around without their heads. Through the chaos it wouldn’t be difficult to have the police round up the high profilers still living, giving the rest a choice between imprisonment and living a relatively straight life.
Dean nodded, feeling like he might cry. Cry or explode, he wasn’t sure which. A bead of precome ran down the side of his dick, dripping to the floor. He bit his lip to stop from whimpering as Cas gasped and groaned behind him.
No, he thought firmly, shaking his to clear away this dangerous line of thought. It wouldn’t do to forget that Dean was a liability, a threat to their cause. The potential consequences of his actions were to be acknowledged and provisioned for, it was important that he not fall prey to that man’s—his—his wiles. This was a bad idea and that was a fact that couldn’t be forgotten. Still, the lingering weight of Dean’s lips made his skin feel feverish, mind looping with I trust you Cas and make me yours until he felt dizzy and breathless.
He was doomed—his own best friend had sold him out. Dean wrapped a towel around his shoulders and helped him stand, “Come on, big guy. Let’s go.” He called over his shoulder, “You gonna be okay, Jo?”
“I don’t know, Gabe,” Anna said softly, eyes still trained on the ground. “I think we were pretty lucky.”
“There was no way to weed out the liars. The staff had to be dealt with—especially my closest confidents.”
He kissed his way back down Dean’s neck, making sure to take his time teasing the man’s nipples, biting and sucking them just to hear the beautiful moans it produced. When he finally reached that aching cock, he wrapped his wet lips around the swollen head and suckled gently. His tongue played with the slit then traced the contour, swirling round and round, taking the detective apart.
“That right, baby? You were made for me?” Dean nodded, he could see how much more desperate that made Castiel, he could practically feel how hard the other man was. He pulled his hand out of Dean’s hole to reach around for the rest of the cold come in the panties. He bucked forward, hoping for Cas to touch him but his hand was pulled away too fast.
him—some hotshot fifth-year Medievalist. Worked out of the Center for Medieval Studies, so there was some crossover with English but not enough that they attended the same events. He vaguely remembered the guy gave a talk in the department a few years ago, something about ‘queer apophasis’ in Margery Kempe or some bullshit thing like that. Needless to say, Dean didn’t attend, but he did mock it with his buddies. Medievalists were always trying to do gimmicky shit like that to make their stodgy-ass projects seem relevant.
Friday, Bobby had started assigning cases unrelated to The Angel’s disappearance so today was the day Dean got to put it all behind him. The world was moving on and he was more than happy to let it take him anywhere it wanted. This was possibly the best Monday in his entire life, so great he couldn’t help whistling the entire way through his shower and all the way to the pantry. It was 6:20am and he even had time for a cup of coffee before heading over to the station where Benny was waiting with something new and mundane to occupy their time.
Dean panted, “Yours, Cas, yours!” feeling his orgasm building. His legs trembled violently with pleasure, his body wrecked and pliant.
Behind him, he could hear Castiel’s sharp intake of breath. Encouraged, he pressed himself even closer to the bars so that there was barely any distance between them. There was a long silence and he was just about to turn when he heard Cas moving, kneeling so that he was in direct view of his hole.
“You gonna tell me what’s goin’ on, Dean?” Benny’s voice cut through his all his worrying, sharply tugging him back to reality.
“You had me so worried!” He shouted, pushing his way into the apartment. “Jerk.” He added, shoving Dean slightly on his way to the kitchen.
“Going to find out how much of an expert you are.” He growled into Dean’s neck, nipping at the sensitive skin. “Going to see how well this body,” a hand slowly trailed down his back, then sharply yanked Dean’s underwear below the curve of his ass, “can please me.”
Dean gasped, what had Cas just said? He tried to struggle out free from Castiel but the man was holding him too tightly, and every movement he made only served to drive the fingers in further. Cas was laughing as Dean’s panic increased, “Easy, baby boy. Relax.”
Castiel sat up, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We should shower,” he said as emotionlessly as possible, refusing to meet the other man’s gaze.
Dean closed his eyes and tried to get a grip. He set his phone down on the small, crappy desk and picked Crying Lot back up. For the first time, he wished he’d listened to Sam when the kid went through that yoga-hippie phase and started spouting off all that zen crap about rising above.
“Hello, Dean.” He greeted, forcing all the emotion from his voice—worried that maybe in the light of day his pretty would regret all the fun they had the night before. Curious as to the source of the sounds, Castiel peered over his shoulder, careful to keep their bodies from touching until he had a better read on the other man’s mood.
“Why would I miss some lowlife criminal?” All of the anger he’d repressed for weeks was bubbling up under his skin, making him want to lash out, to scream and yell and hurt the other man.
Much to his dismay, the apartment was dark and quiet when he got there—the clock in the kitchen said 7:01. He sighed, it wouldn’t be long before Dean was home and he could work out some tension. In the mean time, he poured himself a drink and wandered toward the couch. There was a picture frame on the side table he hadn’t noticed before. It a young looking boy with a diploma and graduation cap. The brother? he though, bring the frame closer to his face. Just then there was a rattling at the door.
This was oddly nice; better than anything they’d ever done before. Over the course of their time together, pleasing the beautiful man beneath him had somehow become more arousing than being pleased. It was almost purer like this, more concentrated now that he wasn’t worrying about his own pleasure. He could focus on Dean, on his trembling thighs and the broken whimpers that spilled from his lips.
It was midnight when the plan was finally settled. After everything was decided, there was a long and uncomfortable silence where the weight of the following days finally sunk in. A few minutes passed and then Dean smiled uncomfortably and spoke, “Well,” Dean clapped his hands together, smiling with anxious eyes, “what do you say, you guys ready to die tomorrow?”
“Yes,” he all but whispered. When it looked like Cas had no intention of closing the distance between them, Dean added an even softer, “Please.”
After a good few minutes he gave up and peered inside. Not being able to find it was strange, he always kept the jar in the exact same place and didn’t have a habit of moving things around carelessly. The smell was so strong that it couldn’t have been coming from anywhere other than the pantry but he just couldn’t find—
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose—this was precisely the problem. They had to make it look real enough that the police department and the news reporters would believe it. Which was likely impossible given that—
The sight made that same giddy-happy feeling unfurl inside him and when Dean finally sat, Castiel couldn’t help but twine their fingers together until the table. Despite his subtlety, Anna still saw and winked, nearly causing him to blush. From the corner of his eye, it looked like Dean might explode he was so happy.
It occurred to him then that fluffy towels might be one of the only indulgences the man allowed himself. In the years before meeting, when they’d scrambled to learn the details of each other’s lives, he’d never known Dean’s relationships to last more than the night. Considering how touch starved he seemed, Castiel wondered how long it had been since he’d known genuine affection—a comforting touch that extended beyond the warm towels and sheets he surround himself with.
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face, eyes briefly darting over to Castiel before settling on Sam again. “Look, Sammy, I don’t like this either but they got a point—fact is, we don’t know what Bobby would do.”
Both men sat there panting for a few minutes. Dean was now painfully hard, on the verge of coming. He palmed his erection, whining slightly with the urgency.
“Darling, you’re not serious.” Castiel simply glared, hard and unkind, entreating his friend to behave. They exchanged heated looks for a minute before Balthazar finally sighed and, rolling his eyes, muttered a halfhearted apology.
“You want to taste me, don’t you? Want to wrap that beautiful mouth around my dick and make me sing, huh? Go on, then, open up for me.”
“Relax your throat, baby. I know you can take more of me.” Cas rumbled above him, voice thick and rough now. Dean did as he was told, trying to relax the muscles of his throat. Eventually, he succeeded, and Cas’s dick slid so far in that Dean’s nose pressed right into his pubic hair. He pulled off gasping and choking, tears streaming down his cheeks.
“I hardly think letting me look at some files is the most illegal thing you’ve done in the past twenty-four hours.” The bitchface Sam hit him with was definitely a-game and Dean put his hands up in surrender.
“After you’ve taken control of Lucifer’s empire, you’ll be strong. Your followers will respect you—they will fear you, and no one will be foolish enough to move against you. But if you let Lucifer live, I’m afraid you’ll have backed yourself into a corner without any way to tell the direction of assault.”
“Michael, please. You know I’m right. If you kill Lucifer now, you will seem strong, unshaken. If it is our brother trying to seize power, then you’ll have solved the problem. If it is someone within our ranks, you’ll have foiled their plan and bought us enough time to safely suss them out.” Castiel leaned back in his chair, feeling confident that he had Michael’s interest. “When you’re unsure whether it’s the serpent or the devil who tempts you to madness, is it not best to kill one and thereby eliminate its possibility entirely?”
“A being breathing thoughtful breath, a traveller between life and death;” Castiel kissed along his jaw, “the reason firm, the temperate will, endurance, foresight, strength, and skill—” Dean captured his lips in a kiss, swallowing his words for a moment. “A perfect man, nobly planned, to warn, to comfort, and command; and yet a spirit still, and bright—”
“Something’s happened?” He laughed uneasily, “Got anythin’ else for me or am I supposed ‘ta tell the captain you just got a bad feeling in your gut?”
“No.” He said, setting the food down on two plates and then taking the seat opposite Dean. “I think there’s a lot you don’t know about this guy.”
Sighing, he rolled out of bed and, not wanting to provide any unnecessary temptation for either of them, slipped on a pair of underwear before wandering toward the kitchen. Immediately, he was greeted by a smooth curved back covered in a spattering of freckles that made the muscles look softer, kinder than they would have otherwise. There was only the slightest bit of disappointment upon noticing that Dean was clothed from waste down.
Dean tossed his phone down and leaned back on his chair for a moment, listening as the song ended. For a brief, ecstatic moment there was silence and Dean sent a silent prayer to the universe that it wouldn’t start again.
Of course Castiel was friends with attractive, spontaneous men who just broke into people’s apartments in the middle of the night. He wondered just how well they knew each other, worrying that maybe—well, they were both attractive and it wouldn’t be that much of a stretch to imagine them—
“Think about it, Dean. An operation this scale? He’d be risking the lives of a lot of people if he told you. He’d be risking your life if he brought you into this mess.”
Charlie nodded in agreement, “Cas? I’m going to go let your mom know what happened. You go with Dean, okay?” He just glared at her, the sweet concerned friend act might have fooled everyone else but he knew better. Especially when she leaned in to hug him whispering, “Don’t mess this up.”
Gabriel had designed everything and so, unsurprisingly, there wasn’t an ounce of seriousness or sense in the décor of any room. The stripped wallpaper of the hallway clashed with the green floral carpeting of the living room, offset by the furniture’s vibrant red upholstery, and candy pink drapery. On the opposite side of the entranceway stood the kitchen, with its mint green cabinets and checkered tiles. Castiel rolled his eyes fondly, realizing how silly this must look to Dean.
“Anyone for a drink?” Balthazar smiled politely at Dean, “would the little lamb prefer a cup or a bowl?” Dean snarled but held his tongue as Gabriel snickered and kicked Balthazar away. A moment later he returned with a bottle of whiskey, three cups, and a small bowl.
“Cassie’s always been pretty stiff. Not one for nicknames.” Balthazar slapped him on the back and he let out a huff that only seemed to encourage their laughter.
Everything was fine, that is, until they were climbing the stairs to the fifth floor. A tremor escaped his hand as he knocked, and he looked around desperately to ensure none of his party had seen. They only stood there for a moment before a gigantic man was slowly peeling open the door, looking over them all with weary anticipation.
Castiel took a deep breath, steeling himself—it was time to stop playing house, to purge his emotions and become a solider once more. This vacation from duty, this stolen moment of domestic bliss he’d lived with Dean was over. He needed to face his responsibilities; own up to the role he was deigned to play.
Dean woke up alone and cold in his bed sometime around ten. A sinking feeling ran through him and he sat up to scan the room, but there was no sign of Cas anywhere. He flopped back down and stared up the ceiling. Belatedly, he realized the shower was being turned off and a few seconds later a very naked Castiel came out of the bathroom toweling his wet hair.
He shook his head and ran upstairs, locking himself in his room before collapsing on the ground, officially more mortified than he’d ever been in his life. Part of him wanted to cry and the other part just wanted to disappear altogether.
Cas eased him onto his elbows, taking a minute to run his blunt nails down Dean’s sweaty back. In the mirror he could see the other man biting his lip, looking at him as like a dessert tray. Cas leaned down and kissed the top of his ass, right along the panty line, before reaching up to pull the underwear off.
“Yes.” Castiel was shocked, and searched his friend’s eyes for any sign of humor. For years Balthazar had followed him into anything, fought by his side without reservation, but now his gaze was serious, voice concerned. “Cassie,” he said gently, “you’re in love and I’m worried it’s clouding your judgment. We’ve worked too hard, you’ve worked too hard, to let some man ruin everything.”
“I suppose I’ll be otherwise engaged,” Castiel grinned mischievously, “evaluating the benefits of tightness.”
“Oh hell no!” Gabriel shouted, adamantly shaking his head. “Not happening. Look, you’re already on thin ice with me bucko, I ain’t looking to welcome anyone else I don’t know with open arms.”
Dean’s hands tightened and squeezed Castiel’s fingers uncomfortably hard, but it didn’t even occur to him to chastise the man. The pressure was as enjoyable a pain as the ache in his lips from sliding up and down the man’s thick length.
A few minutes later, he was almost unwillingly drawn out from the bedroom by the smell of bacon. Cas was making breakfast and it smelled amazing. He couldn’t help himself, he loved breakfast, his body was practically conditioned to react well to anything breakfast related. So he pushed his worries about Cas and what they were doing aside, slipped on a pair of underwear and nervously padded down the hall.
The man’s face went blank instantly; body shutting down like it was ridding itself of all emotion. “He was not very cooperative.” Came the monotone reply.
“Okay, baby. You do everything that I tell you and I’ll consider letting you kiss me. How does that sound?”
“It has been months without word—we were starting to wonder where your loyalties lie. Questioning whether it really is the police you’re spending so much time and energy hiding from.” His voice was more irritated than angry, and Castiel felt the relief wash through him. If Michael knew what they’d been planning, Uriel wouldn’t be able to keep it to himself. The man reveled in every one of his failures; there was no way this betrayal would go without comment.
“How does that saying go, little brother? He must have been ‘working like a dog’? Or, wait, is it ‘like a dog in heat’?” Through the phone, he could hear the distinct sound of giggling.
“Whatever.” He twirled the cord around his fingers, thinking about his next move. If Bobby was knocking him off the case, maybe he could just work from home through Kevin. “Okay, brief me. I want to know what the plan is, immediate and long term.”
“Okay.” Dean’s voice was a sturdy timber that filled the room with an overwhelming sense of safety, permitting Castiel to indulge in such tremendous intimacy. “We don’t have to talk,” he said, running his hand through dark brown hair. “I won’t say anything, if that’s what you want. I’ll do anything you want.”
“Uh, hey Cas.” He knew he should be worried. Castiel’s life was on the line here, he was facing down some serious time, but the man looked as relaxed as ever. Something was obviously going on, but Dean couldn’t find it in himself to care. Right now, all he could think about was how good Cas looked lying down like that and how much he wished he could crawl right onto his lap and ride his—
Dean moaned, “Deeper, need it deeper.” Cas laughed, pushing his fingers in as far as they could go and fingering him open almost brutally.
There was a pause, Dean closed his eyes and bit his lips as Castiel continued to work him open. “Could, could you—uh—slow down? Who is this?”
He was so lost thinking of all the ways to please Dean that it took him a minute to realize that the man was standing in front of him, dressed sharply in a sleek black suit. Castiel admired him for a moment, before walking him toward the door. An unreadable expressed passed through green eyes, hand coming up to rub the back of his neck awkwardly as he spoke, “Um, well, I guess, I’ll see you later then.”
“No!” She shouted, even more distressed. “God, Cas, you’re a wanted man. You can’t go anywhere near the hospital!”
“Castiel,” he said like he was testing the way the name felt in his mouth. “Yeah, cool.” There was another sound from behind them, “Alright well, that’s my queue to leave. Can’t wait to hear what you think of the book, Cas.” Dean smiled wolfishly before jogging down to deal with whatever was going on at the other end of the pool.
Anna turned then, pulling Castiel in close enough that she could whisper. “I’m glad you decided to trust him, little brother. You’ve spent far too much time alone.”
“It’ll be fine. Like I said, we have limited time. We don’t have the luxury to wait around another week.”
“Cassie may not seem it,” he gasped, wiping a tear from his eye, “but he really has a flare for the dramatic. Kid’s all gravitas and doom, always was.”
The warmth of Dean’s fingers gently urging their bodies closer pulled him from his thoughts and he found himself pressing their forehead together. They stayed like that, breathing in quiet tandem, sharing air in the impossibly small space left between them.
Dean could feel the blinding build of his orgasm, his whole body shaking, muscles coiling tightly under his too hot skin. It wouldn’t have taken much to have him coming with a cry, but Cas pulled his fingers out abruptly, causing Dean to whimper at the loss and press his ass desperately to the bars, thrusting back on nothing. He tried to move but Cas stopped him, holding him still with his clenching hole on display.
“It makes all difference!” He spat. “This whole thing—everything was a lie! You were just setting me up, using me so you could hide some stolen gun!”
Slowly, he brought his other arm down and wrapped it around the other man’s neck. Dean’s chest was pressed against his, hot despite the chill of the water. By now the panic was really starting to set in—things were going so well and he was definitely about to ruin it. If they kissed it would quickly become apparent that he had no idea what he was doing, sending Dean running in the opposite direction. Castiel wasn’t stupid; he knew Dean’s reputation enough to know the man probably didn’t want to bother with some loser virgin who didn’t even know how to kiss.
“But you still want me to divulge things that I cannot.” He said mournfully, turning his head to look at the ground.
“Always.” Castiel said, grimacing slightly. “Balth. Tell them to call the lobby of Dean’s building, when it’s time.”
The tension had eased a little and when the silence returned it was much more pleasant, almost soothing. His mind wandered to the peculiarity of his actions—of the evidence room, of the stretch of his lips around Dean, how he swallowed the man’s release without a second thought. It was strange, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d willingly pleasured a man like that, since he’d been so willing to give another person so much.
“Your arms should come down like this,” he entwined their fingers and pulled the arm down, letting it land directly on his shoulder before finally letting go to wrap around Castiel’s waist.
And okay now he was pissed. What kind of psycho was Castiel? Shaking with barely contained anger, Dean reached for the door handle, and, surprisingly, it gave way. Guess the guy hadn’t bothered to lock it when he went in—
He looked around—everyone was staring at him, Charlie looking more concerned than he’d ever seen her before. “Sorry,” he mumbled, humiliated by the attention.
“But that isn’t your style, you’ve never done that before. I thought I recognized it though, thought I’d seen it before—something vicious, nearly animalistic in its brutality.”
Dean gripped his cock and Castiel shut his eyes with the pleasure of it. Before his brain could even process what was happening, Dean was positioning himself above Castiel’s dick and slowly pushing the head inside him. As he sunk down on Castiel, he murmured, “You’re so—uh, strong,” he gasped as he bottomed out, “p-powerful” he moaned, rocking his hips slightly, “and good.”
“Uh, well. You’re, I mean, you’re cuffed so,” he gestured vaguely to Castiel’s crotch, unable to meet his eyes. “I don’t know how—where would I even—”
“Goodnight, Dean.” He said, tightening his grip around the other man and wishing desperately that he wouldn’t have to leave him. Not tonight, not ever. This is where he belonged, right here, in this beautiful man’s arms. He fell asleep happy, hoping that everything else in his life would just melt away, that the universe would conspire to allow him this.
“I missed you.” He said with a hopeful smile that Dean didn’t return. Sighing, he added, “And I needed a favor.”
Thoughts of Balthazar, of the impending meeting with Michael, of Anna and Gabriel, flitted through his mind but he did his best to push them aside. There would be plenty of time for worry, Castiel reasoned as he felt the soft press of lips against his hair, but that was for later. Now was for this, a perfect moment—perhaps the most singularly perfect moment of his entire life—and he was going to remember every single detail.
Behind him fabric rustled and a moment later he felt the hot press of Castiel’s cock nudging at his entrance. Dean moaned loudly, relief and excitement and arousal rushing through his body. Every inch of him screaming, finally finally!
“That’s a good boy.” Feeling slightly boneless he slumped forward, and Cas had to steady him to keep him from falling. “Easy, baby. I’m not done with you, yet.” Holding Dean upright with one hand, he pushed the other into the wet panties and wrapped his hand around his oversensitive cock. “Want you to watch yourself taking my cock,” He breathed, fisting Dean until he started to harden again. “Going to watch yourself come untouched. Want you to see how hot you look, gorgeous.”
Dean’s head was foggy, cock rock hard and leaking precome onto the cement floor. Cas was massaging his hole now, teasing him, but there was nothing he could do. When he tried to push back onto Castiel’s finger, the bar stopped him, making him whine in frustration.
Eventually the kissing slowed, and Dean tucked himself into Castiel’s arms, head resting just below the other man’s chin. He felt strangely safe, happier and more sated than he could remember. A small part of him felt worried, ashamed, and scared. A quiet voice telling him he should be afraid, that it was his fault Cas escaped, that he was falling asleep in the arms of known killer. But he didn’t want to think about that now, so he pushed all those thoughts away into some dark corner of his brain and nuzzled in closer to Castiel’s warm skin.
“Going to jerk off. Touch myself in your bed.” Cas’ breath was ragged, voice low and gravel rough. “Only going to let you—uh—listen. Want you to do it,” he moaned lewdly, making Dean’s cock twitch, “silently. Don’t want to hear a—ah—single—ah—sound from you. Understand?”
“Enjoying the presents, I see.” Came a deep rumbling voice from the doorway. Dean’s eyes shot open, hoping to god that he’d just imagined the sound. But there he was, leaning against the doorframe smirking. The man looked good, standing there in a tight white dress-shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, blue tie hanging loose around his neck. The expensive black pants he was wearing hugged tightly around his ass and crotch, emphasizing the bulge of his erection.
He got up uncertainly and walked over to the full-length mirror at the other end of the bedroom, sinking to his knees in front of it. Reflected in the glass was his own flushed face, spit slicked lips shining, small bruises around his torso where Cas had nipped and sucked at the skin. Eyes raked down until they finally landed on the panties. The image made him groan and he shifted around, letting the fabric slide against him.
Gah! I'm sorry if this chapter seems a bit rushed, I wanted to get something up today but I'm ridiculously swamped with school and work things.
They stayed like that for a minute, Dean running a hand through his hair as he cried and shook underneath him. Dean pressed kisses to his tear-stained cheeks, his eyes, nose, forehead, and back down to his lips until Castiel managed to pull himself together enough to stop crying.
They showered quickly; Dean tried to lighten the mood but every smile, every sweet word, only seemed to sour Castiel’s mood further. He knew that he was being unfair and punishing the man he cared about for no reason, but he couldn’t help himself. More than anything, he wished Dean wasn’t there, that he didn’t have the constant reminder of how corrupting his presence was.
There was a tense moment where Michael scanned the dark halls around them for some unseen evil. In that second Castiel’s mind was overloaded with a million regrets, fears, with a warring desire to beg for his life or die with dignity.
Dean hugged his body tightly, feeling suddenly empty. The apartment already felt too quiet, loneliness creeping in around him. He closed his eyes and tried to will the feeling away.
Wait—Cassie? Had that pompous bag of dicks just called his—whatever Cas was—Cassie? Something about that made Dean’s blood boil even more so than the fact the asshole just broke into his apartment at three in the morning. He looked between the two men, eyes narrowing as they took in their familiarity, how casual and comfortable the stranger seemed, the way his short sandy hair framed playful blue eyes. He groaned internally, the man was obviously and unfairly attractive.
“No!” He said quickly then flushed. “No, well, I mean, yes, sort of… but I wanted it to be you.” Dean looked confused, he sighed. “I’m just not experienced, I didn’t want you to,” he looked away again before mumbling, “not like it.”
He bit his lip, trying to ignore the way those big calloused hands felt sliding down his body. “But it should be doing,” Dean shifted, touching so far up his inner thigh that it made Castiel gasp, “this.” He moved the leg out. “Got it?”
But, this was probably the last time they’d ever see each other and he really wanted to know what it would be like to wrap himself up in the man. The coat smelled just like him—chlorine and leather and something else entirely
“What’s the matter, baby? I thought you missed me.” Dean expected Cas to mad but he just looked amused. He thinks I’m playing hard to get, Dean realized, the thought making him even angrier.
“No baby,” Castiel breathed, voice lower and huskier than ever, “no, baby, you were perfect. You are perfect.” His hands came up to feel the hard planes of the man’s stunning body, finding their way from chest to pert little ass, fingers trailing down the crack to tease his loose, wet hole.
“Did you see detective hottie while you were there?” Anna giggled from the lap of some unknown man in the back. Castiel turned red instantly, but before he had a chance to respond, Balthazar pushed Dean forward. All at once the room went silent.
“It really is your lucky day. Managed to wrangle two first class seats in the squad car with Kevin!” Victor beamed at the siblings, who were back to looking like pathetic civilians. Dean tried to force a smile, feeling even sicker now that he was essentially lying to Victor by not arresting the two. A part of him begged and thrashed and screamed for him to say something, anything, but a bigger part knew that talking would mean betraying Cas and he just couldn’t do it.
It was dark and quiet when he got in but for once it didn’t bother him, the urgency of his arousal outweighing the emptiness of the apartment. He ran toward the bedroom, ripping clothing off on the way, not wanting to waste a second more than he had to with undressing. When he finally flopped down onto his bed, he was naked expect for the panties—cool silk sliding across his oversensitive skin.
“I have,” he paused, clearly considering whether or not to tell the truth, then sighed resignedly. “I have an inside man.”
Slowly he started undoing the buttons of Dean’s shirt, letting each one thud back against him before moving on to the next. When the shirt was open he pushed it completely off, then let his fingers skirt across the man’s chest. Barely there touches, brushing against his nipples and stomach, trailing lower and lower until his hands landed on the cool metal of a belt. Castiel sunk to ground between his thighs and slid the leather form around Dean’s waist, setting it neatly beside him on the floor.
