“Since Bart’s and Angelo’s and the serial killing cabbie-yes,” Sherlock finally locked eyes with him again.
“No-that’s not what I meant. I’m fine, physically. I wanted to talk to you,” John took a few steps toward Sherlock, “I-sorry, I’m not sure quite where to begin…”
"She should have been out of her crib months ago," John sighed. "She's outgrown it. I'm going to have to get my own place eventually, you know. Might as well do it now."
Sherlock rolled his eyes in annoyance and started unloading those exact items from the bags and onto the counter top. "Might want to give this to her when you put her to bed," he pushed the fever reducer over to the edge of the counter. Even from his chair, John could clearly see that it was a children's variety. "Or would you like me to do it while you get this infernal woman out of here?"
, I hate those words. If the police haven't sorted her out by the time Rosie is feeling better, Lestrade will call me to solve it anyways."
John’s stomach sank. “I did,” he said slowly. “That’s why I came, but it's not something I want to resort to. And...I have a better idea,” he licked his bottom lip nervously. “I want you to rewrite that song.”
When Sherlock woke, he looked down to see a blushing John Watson in his arms. It was a sight he could certainly get used to but… why was he blushing? Embarrassment from last night perhaps? No… something else. Something Sherlock’s sleep addled mind couldn’t quite pinpoint. Ignoring it for the moment, the detective simply smiled back at the smaller man, “Did you sleep well?” he asked, immediately regretting the stupidity of his question. It seemed like a general nicety to at least ask but considering the events of the night before it was ridiculously idiotic. It was something Sherlock had noticed, since living with John he had begun to take notice of social norms and niceties, despite his usual aversion to them. Curious. When he thought on it, he realized that he did these things just to make John smile. There was something about the warmth and pride John had when he smiled directly at Sherlock that made the detective want to cause the phenomenon as often as he could. Suddenly, he realized he had gone off into his thoughts and John was giggling, yes, giggling in his arms, the soft jolts shaking his torso ever so slightly, “What on earth is so funny?” he asked, perplexed. He hadn’t told a joke, nor made an amusing statement, as far as he was aware he had remained completely silent while he had been lost in thought.
Sherlock was a little stunned at John obvious attempt to make him happy but sacrificing his own happiness yet again.”Why do you keep doing that? Sacrificing your things, your time, your happiness just to protect and help  me?” he whispered.
After a moment of silence and deliberation as to how he could explain this away, Sherlock was stunned when John didn’t ask nor force anything out of him. Of course the doctor would have been able to tell what was there… so why didn’t he ask? Perhaps he didn’t care or didn’t want to know. Unlikely. John cared about him and John knew him… ah, that was it. John knew when Sherlock didn’t want to talk, he wouldn’t. So he was going to leave it until the time was right.  Sherlock relaxed just a little bit, holding the doctor just a little closer before replying in a cracked tone, “Goodnight John”. For some reason he had the overwhelming and unexplainable urge to lean down and press a kiss to his friend’s forehead but he decided against it, right now it was time to sleep. Just like the night before, as soon as they were connected, they both fell into a deep and comfortable sleep.
Sherlock drags out his chair and sits at the table.  Picks up a pen and starts scrawling mindless circles into the nearest sheet of paper at hand.  Black chaos unfurls across the page.  Words bubble up his throat, bilious and foul.  An illness he has nursed for years.  “I can’t.”
The words are shockingly loud in the stale air.  John is startled for an instant before he realizes they came from his mouth.  His hands are moving again of their own accord, fisting in the lapels of Sherlock’s coat.  Sherlock stares at him.  Unblinking, lips parted.
There is something exploratory in this, as if John is determined to learn every line of him, every inch and atom.  Sherlock’s past experience has done nothing to prepare him for this.  He might have been wanted, but never before has he felt
Rosie makes a face, then stabs her fork through a clod of greens and chokes them down.  John rolls his eyes as she gags.
“Oh, right,” says John.  “Lestrade mentioned them.  He and the rest of the Yard are following up on the rest, but so far, all the photographs have been of living people.”
John was still and thoughtful for a moment, but then he felt sick to his stomach. He had some across many sick people in the time he had been helping Sherlock on cases and he had seen a few people like this. That was the problem, people like this weren’t really people at all, they had no regard for human life and would do anything to reach their ends. It was people like this man that terrified John to no end because unlike the unhinged and clinically insane who go on sporadic rampages, these people were calm, collected and organised. That meant that unless John played this right, there was a high chance they were both going to get burned in this encounter. After what felt like an eternity, John nodded and stood slowly, hands raised in a non-threatening gesture, “Alright, alright, I have a few things you can have. I wouldn’t bother expecting anything off of him, unless you fancy a nice pair of dress shoes”  he sighed. Making sure to keep his movements slow and non-threatening, John opened the side table by his bed and rummaged through a few things. His gun was sat there but he knew without a doubt if he drew it, Sherlock would be killed in an instant and that was not going to happen as long as he could prevent it. Keeping himself collected, John pulled out a box which contained a pristine watch, a limited edition rolex that was handed down to him from his grandfather. It was in mint condition and he knew the gunman would have no quarrel in taking it as a prize. Despite his reluctance to part with the item, John placed it on the table. At the end of the day he knew a watch was nothing in comparison to the life of his best friend. As he rummaged, a few items came to the table; silver cufflinks, his phone, a few jewelry items he had received as gifts… All in all there was a at least a grands worth of items. He pulled his laptop in as the robber could clearly see it on the side, then he sighed and stepped back, “That’s all of it” he said, facing the man and standing firm, “Take it and go already”
Without a word, John shook his head and bent down, the next thing he knew, his lips were pressed against Sherlock’s in a firm manner, his mind not even bothering to  catch up with the situation. There was no embarrassment, no shyness, no excessive beating of the heart. No, none of that. There was only certainty. The kiss was brief, a few seconds at most before he pulled back, “Do you have a death wish or something, Sherlock Holmes? Because I don’t think I can constantly keep coming so close to lose the man I love again…” he said fondly, averting his gaze and clearing his throat before pulling himself to his feet and holding out a hand for the man who was staring up at him from the floor, clearly shocked.
The sensations running through Sherlock’s mind and body alike were explosive to say the least, he had never felt anything like this in all of the years he had walked thought this dull plain of existence. Normally the world was full of constant prattle supplied by idiots that were inefficient, lazy and self destructive, not to mention stupid on the best of days. It was maddening. Normally Sherlock found his mind wandering in a million different directions and wielding no results or excitement, now however was a different story. Now, Sherlock was here on John’s lap and all of the world had faded away, it was him and his blogger, things had never felt so perfect. Before his mind dared to wander off again, Sherlock decided to lock it in place and focused back on John’s warm body below him, his lips pressed against his own and the feeling of those strong arms looking him in place, it was enough to draw a variety of small involuntary sounds from his throat. Despite his best efforts, a blush rose on his cheeks and he felt himself get embarrassed for a moment but that quickly faded when he pulled back just a little bit to see the flush on his blogger’s own face. John looked gorgeous to say the least, his lips tinted red from the action, his pupils blown wide, the look on his face in general… a look that made Sherlock feel he was about to be eaten alive. “John…” he breathed, stunned by the sight of his usually composed and neat companion.
John had retreated to his room and pulled on a pyjama set of his own, clambering into bed and feeling nothing but sheer joy after the events of the evening. This could definitely work out. Soon enough he heard Sherlock’s knocn and his voice… odd, usually Sherlock would simply barge into his room. He decided not to over analyse it and called back, “Come in”. When he saw Sherlock step in, A small half-smile rose on his lips and he lifted the bedding beside him, patting the mattress with his free hand, “Come on you”
After a moment, Sherlock nodded and smiled a little, John did always seem to know what was best when it came to dealing with his emotional state and right now, the idea of getting out of the house seemed perfect. “Sounds good. Angelo’s?”
“Why the hell didn’t you go after him you berk?!” Lestrade spat, fuming at Sherlock's apparent lack of ability to give a care in the world about the man who gave so much of himself just to keep him safe.
“I do. But you're not the sort of man who will just sit back and relax for the day, are you?” he asked with a small smirk.
“I did, you haven’t eaten in two days, no point of you collapsing on a case when it can be prevented” John said simply, placing the tray on the edge of the bed.
“Oh… That would be nice, yes.” Sherlock spoke slowly, thinking back to the nights they had spent together and cringing a little bit when he remembered his back. Shaking it off, he smiled and removed himself from John’s lap, “I’ll be there in a few minutes” he stated before heading to his room to get changed. He knew John would most likely see the state of him plenty of times in the future, but he just didn’t want to ruin right now with his past. With that in mind, Sherlock pulled on a pyjama top and matching bottoms before heading to John’s room. When he got there, he went to walk in but paused, relenting to social politeness and knocking instead. “John?” he called.
When Sherlock had marched himself into that bathroom, the last thing he had expected was for John to take control in such a manner, let alone to not simply claim him where he stood. From the past, Sherlock had never experienced anyone capable of restraint and patience. It was clear that John wanted him, the erection jutting up underneath the thin material of his pyjamas was more than enough proof of that, however he was holding himself back and taking everything at a far slower pace than anticipated. In his mind palace, he had predicted that upon his proposition, John would have had a moment of hesitation as always, before taking advantage of the change in Sherlock’s mind and shagging him senseless. Instead, Sherlock now stood with his back against the bedroom wall with John claiming his lips in a gentle yet assured kiss, his warm hands rested on his waist and their bodies pressed together. He was hardly about to complain, it was actually rather pleasant, but it was a little disconcerting. “I thought you wanted sex?” he blurted out, going a little wide eyed when he realized what had tumbled from his mouth.
John followed briskly, grabbing his own coat just in case. The weather had been starting to turn towards the autumn season and he didn’t really fancy getting soaked by another of Britain’s temperamental rainstorms. As they headed out, they shouted their farewells to Mrs.Hudson and Sherlock did his usual miracle of hailing a cab without any difficulty. John never bothered to try anymore, cabbies always seemed to ignore him, Sherlock however had a serious presence and could get people to flock to him at will. At the same time however, if the detective wanted to go unnoticed, he did. He was really a miraculous man, so tall and striking yet when he wanted to be, he could be utterly invisible and blend in with the crowds around him. Suddenly, John realized he was staring just a little and he looked away, taking a brief glance back before the cabbie pulled up. He gave the address and they climbed into the car before they were off. John never expected that a few hours later they would be running for their lives with a scorned drug lord screaming at them in Russian. Turns out, the murders were staged as a suicide but they were all due to a misunderstanding between the two rings regarding turf and dealers. The leader of the Black Plague gang had decided to get creative, leaving the other gang on the floor in a ring as homage to the well known nursery rhyme, ‘Ring around the rosies’. It was morbid to think that for all these years young children sung about the death of the hundreds at the hands of a plague that swept the nation, but that was hardly the concern now. As they bolted through the alleys, Sherlock running ahead, john found himself snapping back to reality and speeding up, only to be stopped as  the detective grabbed his hand and pulled him into a small broken crevice in the alley wall from where a derelict building was falling to ruin. The gap was small and they shuffled in before finding themselves pressed chest to chest, breathing heavily and listening to the sounds in the alley. John could heard him, the Russian, bolting full pelt down the alley as he looked for them. Looking up, John saw Sherlock was not looking at they alley, but at him, panting and smiling.
Smiling wider, Sherlock pulled himself up a little on the bed, “I think I can say the same, usually falling asleep can take me hours but with you I don’t seem to remember drifting off at all.” he said, thoughtfully.
Feeling Sherlock relaxing against him, John felt a smile at the corner of his own lips. It seemed odd, but after those nights they had spent beside each other, it was nice to feel the comforting sensation of Sherlock at his side again. Gently, John tilted his head to the side, resting it atop of Sherlock’s soft curls. Sometimes John found himself wondering how the detective kept his hair so perfect all the time, after all personal hygiene and self-maintenance were hardly his strong point were they? But that didn’t matter right now, all that mattered was how perfect the moment was.
The day dragged on uneventfully as John had expected, Sherlock had come out of hiding eventually and went straight into normal bored-mode. Part of John wanted to talk about what had happened but then again, they didn’t do that, did they? They never talked about anything meaningful unless it somehow related to the case they were on at the time. So why would this be any different? There had been no news on the man who had come into their home, no knocks at the door from Mycroft or his minions to tell them it was safe again, no nothing. John sighed, he wanted to grab his laptop to blog and check his mail but realized very quickly that he didn’t have it anymore. “Sherlock? Can I use your laptop?” he called from his chair in the living room, scanning around for wherever the detective may have left it this time. For a man who had an organized mind palace, he sure as hell never organized anything else in his life. The living room always made it look like they had been raided or something along those lines, paper and books and evidence from the Yard lay littered all over the room and he knew somewhere under one of the precarious piles would be what he was searching for.
"Of course," Sherlock threw him a scathing look-the 'are you stupid?' look that usually had John's blood boiling or his fist flying toward just that infuriating expression.
"You did the shopping?" Now John was sounding a bit stupid, and the client was glancing between them, lost. "What did you get?"
“No, she’s not. She passed away,” Sherlock answered gently, realizing that John had frozen next to him. “When you were very young. And I’d bet she would have done
Sherlock listened to John patiently, watching is expression and posture, searching deeply for any hint of a lie or an exaggeration but to his surprise he found none. He knew he shouldn't be surprised really, this was John after all, but he couldn’t help himself. This seemed like such an unlikely situation for him to ever end up in, let alone with John. He considered each and every thing John had said before he spoke, squeezing John’s hand in a gently manner, “I don’t know how to deal with emotional dilemmas John, you… you understand this. But… I have noticed developments in my connection with you over time, things that I can’t quite explain. I was hoping… considering this revelation that perhaps you could show me how I could love you in return. I think I do… I just don’t know the most appropriate way to show you” he explained, trying his best to choose words carefully.
Taken aback by Sherlock’s question, John drew in a breath but before the nerves could take over, he calmed himself. He knew the detective had an odd way of working but this was different, this was his own uncertainty and disbelief. Over the years, all people had ever done to him was put him down, call him a freak, tell him he was incapable of love and being loved by another. It was all utter bullshit and anyone with a brain knew that, but John knew, after all that time the small comments would have taken root in that brilliant mind and caused unspoken amounts of damage. Sighing, John stepped a little closer himself and took Sherlock’s hand in his, squeezing lightly, “Sherlock, loving a man like you isn’t easy like it is in the movies. You are a pain in the arse, you destroy the kitchen and my things on a regular basis, you piss off criminals that try to kill us at least twice a month, you drive me absolutely crazy but guess what? I can’t live without you. When you left, it was like I died too. You’re back now and I’ve been too quiet with all of this. My biggest regret when I watch you fall that day was that I never had the guts to tell you just how much I love you and when that asshole broke into the flat and I saw the gun to your skull… I felt that regret again. How could I live with myself if I never got the chance to tell you just how special you are to me? Just how much I care? How beautiful and amazing you are? You are my other half, you have been for years. I know you don’t do this sort of thing, I get it, but I just had to show you… I had to say…” He trailed off, eyes falling to the floor as the relief flooded over him, followed by embarrassment at how in depth his admission had become.
“John, I just want you to know, you don’t have to be so careful with me. I appreciate the sentiment but for once, I think it would be best if you simply lead me in the right direction. If I don’t like it, you will be sure to know.” Sherlock decided it was best to point this out now. He had to admit, this careful and considerate side of John was something he indeed found to be endearing in a way, however if it carried on too long he knew  it would become tedious. It was a personal gripe of his, being treated as though he were some fragile child, incapable of grasping the concept of things. It reminded him all too much of how Mycroft had treated him all of his life and he was certainly not going to let anyone else do that to him ever again. “After all, it isn’t as though I have never had any romantic encounters before, be they falsified for a case or real…” he trailed off, remembering the odd few encounters in the back of his mind. Back when Sherlock found himself in a dark place, his mind addled by drugs and his hazy vision making the world a tolerable sight, people had managed to lure him in. The nights had always  been short and a blur but luckily, despite his discrepancies, he had come out of it all clean and clear. Sitting upright, he turned to John and looked over the blonde carefully. Without the influence of various substances, all of this was more terrifying and if he were alone now  in a dingy alley with some stranger, he would be bricking it. This was different though, this wasn’t a fear of dangerous sex under the influence, this was a whole new fear. A fear of opening up to a world intimacy that he had never known. “Kiss me” he said after a moment of internal deliberation.
It was two weeks before they settled the matter and moved John's bed into Sherlock's room and got Rosie her own tiny toddler bed for upstairs. As Sherlock had promised, their new shared quarters weren't as cramped as John thought they would have been. There was enough room for an end table between their beds, a wardrobe and dresser on the opposite wall and Sherlock's lab bench pushed into its own dedicated corner, surrounded by bookshelves.
John and Sherlock had been bumbling through Rosamund’s infanthood since Mary’s death, but John had still been surprised when Sherlock steadfastly insisted that John move back to Baker Street once his old lease was up, "-since you're already here all day, anyways. It would be pointless for you to continue paying rent when you're more than welcome here."
"You'll have plenty of room, I assure you. I know that it doesn't look it with my bed in the middle like that, but once it's pushed against the far wall-"
Even from the street, however, he could hear the violin and it stopped him in his tracks. This song was not like Irene’s song. John heard so much more than the notes and the melancholy tune-he could hear what Sherlock was
Sherlock barreled on, "We've lived together for years now, so there isn't much left to be embarrassed about and I always wear pajamas, although I don't care that you sleep in your pants-"
, John. There's medicine for her fever, as well as vicks to break up the mucus in her chest. The sports drink to keep her well-hydrated just in case she vomits, and an array of easy-on-the-stomach foods. Plus milk, tea and dinner for you, so that you won't have to leave her to go get anything."
John seemed to come to his senses. "Sorry about that. Thought he'd take it anyways. Why don't you see Scotland Yard, ask for DI Lestrade. He's the best on the force."
about sucking your cock, so tell the bloody presses, let the Yard gossip-I don’t care as long as I’ve got
“No,” John cut him off. “Sherlock, I don’t love you because I feel I owe it to you. I love you because you’re an amazing, caring, beautiful,
"You hardly ever need to stay that late," Sherlock stirred his tea and took a sip, then reached for more sugar. "Why don't you just enroll her in one of the regular programs and when you're working late, I'll pick her up myself. There's no use paying an exponential cost when you only work over once a week or so. And Mrs. Hudson would also be willing to pick her up if the need arose, I'm sure of it."
, you know? And besides, what if I wanted to start dating again some day? Would I be expected to tell her 'sorry, don't mind my flatmate, we share a room. You won't mind, yeah?'"
John was acutely aware of Sherlock seated beside him.  The plush sofa cushions sank off-center, pushing the line of Sherlock’s thigh against John’s.  The  sheer energy and warmth of him was making it difficult to focus.
redcap.  Good God, he’d thought John could be the only one.  Mazikeen in general were not rare, but redcaps were.  Hundreds of years ago, people had been more preoccupied with killing redcaps than mating with them.
Even worse is his brain’s complicity.  The sensations evoked by simple, case-related tasks are snatched up and transplanted into fantasies like scraps of cloth woven into an elaborate quilt.
Until the warm, familiar weight of John’s palm settles over one of Sherlock’s hands, making him start.  His eyes fly open and he stares at John, who draws back like he’s been burned.
Not everything was so easily remedied.  Sherlock still carried with him the mark of the Liminal Children, an aura that could be neither defined nor denied.  People sensed something
John doesn’t expect anything to change when he lies down for his first night at 221B Baker Street.  He has a belly full of beef lo mein and egg rolls and the fingers of his right hand are still tense from pulling the trigger.  He killed a serial killer not three hours ago and his flatmate is definitely a bit of a madman.  He doesn’t expect to get any more or any less sleep than usual tonight.
His words dissolved in a yelp as John strode toward him, one arm slung back in preparation for a strike.  Sherlock swept to John’s side and gripped his wrist, arresting his progress with no small effort.
(In their defense, the girls had visited three other such cider stands before finding the victim’s.  Their wits had been significantly duller than the standard of dull Sherlock is used to.)
A child will happily sit and chat about maggots and eyeballs and maggots in eyeballs for several minutes, given the chance.  Adults, on the other hand, tend to look worried when the subject arises.
– but he finds a Cadbury Milk Tray instead, no doubt purchased at the Tesco Express just around the corner.  Quashing a prickle of disappointment, he takes the chocolates back to John.
“Stay alert, John,” Sherlock says.  He stands stock-still, peering through the foliage onto the starlit expanse of the Serpentine.  “Stadtler could arrive any minute.”
John blinks, surprised at being so willingly recruited.  Sherlock supposes that’s fair; he does have a history of running into danger without backup.  Thinking of Peter’s powerful immensity, of where he is likely to be hiding, he adds, “You will stay out of sight unless Peter puts up a struggle.  Then you can help restrain him.”
A woman, as impossible as it seems.  Sherlock Holmes, besotted by a woman.  A clever woman, no doubt, and beautiful besides.  Pity she’s a fucking psychopath.
Mary lied.  She had lied to John from the moment she met him, and would have lied to him for the rest of their lives if she’d had her way.  She could be lying about Sherlock now.  And anyway, it wasn’t as if she knew Sherlock as well as he did.
John cranes his neck to give the man a puzzled look.  His faculties muddled by drink, he defaults to polite incredulity when Sherlock thinks a punch in the mouth would do quite nicely. “Do I know you?”
“Oh, hush, you,” John says, extricating his hand from Sherlock’s to swat his thigh.  “’Mistreatment’ my arse.  My books sell quite well, thank you.”
“Fine,” he said at last.  He waved at the driver through the partition.  Sherlock felt the car tilt as their course back to Baker Street commenced.  He sighed, shoulders slumping.  He had planned to be alone, and instead he’d had Mrs. Hudson, Alexander Grant, and the British government knocking down his door.  He wanted nothing more than to hole up in 221B and simmer through the rest of his high in peace.
John shrugs, halfheartedly accepting the offering of comfort.  “I suppose part of it is, um… the shirt?  How does it…?”
They went to the house in Chiswick and packed John and Rosie’s things.  The rest they sold or donated or binned.  And that was that.
Now, though.  Now a chance is in sight.  John wants Sherlock; perhaps he can love him.  If Sherlock sets his feet right, he might navigate the path to earn John’s love.
John punched a pillow into place and sat in an armchair with a grunt.  Looking at him, Sherlock had the briefest moment of doubt: could his second sight be wrong?
John smiled wearily.  Gone was the brisk, buoyant younger man of minutes ago.  Now, John looked… tired.  Worn thin.  An impulse to close the scant distance between them seized Sherlock – to hold and warm, to feel vitality surging beneath his hands.  His fingers bit into the sofa’s upholstery.
Now, tramping down the pavement beside the boating lake, Sherlock’s rational mind finally catches up with him.  Perhaps he was too hasty.  Perhaps John has every intention of ending it with Elise – a clean break, a new start.  An empty slate for them to write their own story.
(Actually, the barn is the wedding’s one redeeming quality.  As dusk falls and guests begin filing out, John, loose-limbed and grinning from one too many glasses of wine, takes Sherlock’s hand and leads him to the barn. It is dark, quiet, abandoned.  They fumble about until they find a staircase to an upper level, a ladder to a loft.  And then there is a great deal more fumbling, questing hands and bitten-off laughter, whispering huffs as their pulses accelerate, the clink as Sherlock discards John’s belt.  The soft moans, trapped behind John’s teeth, as Sherlock takes him in his mouth with a kind of half-drunk reverence.)
Lestrade scowls and finally concedes, “Fine.  We’ll wait below.  But if one of you gets pitched off the tower, don’t blame me.”
The scar at the center of Sherlock’s chest twinges at the slight, but he forges onward.  “You’ll come with me, of course.”
Sherlock’s voice roared into the space.  “…clearly an alcoholic!  For God’s sake, why are you lot even
John says nothing for a moment, just – watches.  As if committing Sherlock to memory, as if afraid he might vanish.  The thought dislodges a cold stone of clarity, sends it tumbling down to weigh in Sherlock’s gut.
“I’m only contacting you because I know you two will come after me,” Mary interjected.  “I’m not interested in a chase.  This has to end now, Sherlock.  I owe you for crippling what could have been
“Oh!”  Seb looks from the candle on the table to Sherlock and John’s clasped hands, a parody of well-bred mortification.  “Of course.
“No, you just carry bloody harpoons on the Tube and fire guns in the middle of Belgravia!  Of course, how silly of me!  That’s nowhere near as inappropriate as shouting!” John shouts.
Sherlock’s throat threatened to close.  For all they had shared in the past twenty-four hours, he could not squelch the suspicion that John was keeping him at arm’s length.  Ensconced in the quiet haven of Baker Street, John had been able to set aside his reluctance.  But now, out in the open - seeing Sherlock the consulting detective, the addict, the
John stared at the object in his hands, mouth opening and closing.  He cleared his throat, blinked.  “Um.  Thank you.”
John reaches into the shopping bags and draws out a bottle of cabernet.  Walking to Sherlock’s side, he pulls open a drawer and roots around for the corkscrew.  “Think a dry red pairs well with eggy bread?”
Until he wakes, tension taut through his whole body.  He sits up, one hand clenched in the duvet and the other casting about for his nightstand.  For his Sig.
Sherlock twisted and thrashed beneath John, still entangled in the nightmare.  Bracing himself, John reached for his flailing arms.  Their hands slid together, fingers finding spaces between fingers and curling into iron grips.  Sherlock’s eyes flew open and he gasped.
Rosie blinks, looks from her father to Sherlock and back again.  A little furrow forms on her brow.  “Are we going?”
Never before had John so appreciated the command those three words held over a crowd.  People stepped aside, instinctively obeying his command.  A path opened.  Terror gripped John.
A thin bar of light from the street lamps outside fell across Sherlock’s form.  Sherlock was asleep, eyes clenched shut, fingers twisted in the bedclothes, body was as taut as a bowstring.  John took a step cautious step forward and Sherlock flinched, face convulsing as if in pain.
Sherlock tightens his grip on his glass, stung.  He is no stranger to vicious remarks, but his defenses have been crumbling over the past few hours, weakened by a Guinness and two ciders. After the disastrous bath incident, his nose bloomed into a lurid riot of bruises and have since wilted into sour yellow and acid green.  The swelling has mostly gone down, but Sherlock still gets double-takes from strangers.
“Sherlock!”  Meaty hands clamped around his shoulders and dragged him onto the banks of the pond.  Dazed, Sherlock blinked.  His brother stared down at him.  His eyes – usually remote, disapproving – were wild.  The freckles splashed across his nose and cheeks were vivid against his ashen skin.  “Sherlock.  Can you hear me?”
Sherlock clears his throat, his imperious façade crumbling under the onslaught of emotion: amazement, disbelief, overwhelming love.  “Yes, John.  I will.”
of finality and stands.  Sherlock can see his cock pressing at the zip of his jeans, nudging out the denim.  He licks his lips.
“We won’t be far behind,” Lestrade says.  “You two can meet Peter alone, but we’ll be close by in case things go tits up.”
“It’s the truth,” Sherlock said.  “Selkie stories are all the same.  Kidnapping, rape, abuse.  Obviously she got tired of it and killed him.  Tedious.”
After veritable eons (which John later insists was only a total of four hours), the last well-wishers totter out, faces ruddy from drinking.  The staff moves in to begin cleaning.  Lights are switched on, dispelling the dusky romance with their buttery glow.
Mycroft rings off before John can fathom a reply.  He pulls the phone away and stares at the screen until it darkens, mind blank with shock.
1.  The Morcar Museum is named for the Countess of Morcar, who appears in "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle."
“Don’t pout,” John says, exasperated but fond.  He and Sherlock stand at the entryway to the flat, John tugging his jacket on while Rosie dawdles upstairs.  “I have got a
“We have all kinds of delicacies here,” said Eirene, ignoring him.  “Larks drowned in mead.  Fertilized duck eggs.  Viper wine.”
“There you are,” said the woman.  Stripped of the haze, her face was all cut-glass angles and dark, glittering eyes.  A sharp creature’s face, far from human.
Sherlock’s hands are starting to shake.  He presses a thumb to the arch of John’s foot, kneading, soothing.  (Himself or John, he cannot say.) “Children.”  The word sticks in his throat.  “Do you… want them?”
John moves back to 221B, taking the bare minimum from the house he shared with Mary.  He doesn’t think he can bear it, not yet: dealing with the baby’s things.  The half-assembled crib, the changing station, the cupboards stocked with nappies and bottles and tiny clothes.
Sherlock covers John's hand with his own and John smiles, thankful.  "I'm... I'm very lucky I have you.  I don't like to think of who I would be, otherwise."
John tensed, entwined fingers tightening like a vice around each other.  His face became utterly devoid of emotion.  Fury rose in Sherlock as he scrambled for coherency.
John phones Lestrade, adamant that the Yard investigate the crime scene immediately.  He is also adamant that Sherlock not be a part of said investigation.
Sherlock thinks back to the events of the past day.  Twenty minutes after being thrown in the lake, the Yard – summoned when Sherlock phoned – arrived on the scene with an ambulance in tow.  According to them, he had been lying on the shore, sodden and crusted with frost, but fortunately undrowned.  He was promptly whisked to hospital, where he was diagnosed yet again with hypothermia and treated accordingly.  His brain was miraculously unscathed, though the doctors insisted on monitoring him for several hours.  John, having arrived shortly after Sherlock, presided over his care in stony silence.  Only later, cloistered in the privacy of 221B – later being, of course,
McFarlane sighs.  "She's... a little shaken up.  I think she thought she was rid of him for good.  But!"  He injects a forced dose of levity into his tone.  "Bastard's behind bars now, so I suppose we're all rid of him."

come along.  As misfortune would have it, John was long gone by that point, disembarking at Norfolk Wildlife Trust station and getting into a cab bound for the marshes.
They glance at Donovan, sweep their gazes around the room, and exchange a thrilled and embarrassed look.  A rising tide of enthusiasm permeates the room, cresting into cheers as John settles his hands on Elise’s waist and draws her down for a kiss.  The room erupts in drunken whoops and whistles.
Undeterred, Sherlock sets nimble fingers to the buttons of John’s shirt.  It’s ridiculous, really – no man should go to bed in his work clothes.  But John had, because Sherlock had needed him and there was no time to change.  The thought makes Sherlock’s heart stutter.
He drifted past Sherlock without awaiting a reply and swayed over to John’s armchair, sitting heavily.  Across from them, John looked on, ferocity fading into concern.
At last a cab broke through the darkness, careening down the street with a clear intent to pass him by.  Sherlock bolted into the street, waving his free hand and shouting.  The vehicle screeched to a halt and the cabbie emerged, swearing profusely.
“Thank you.”  Sherlock studied her, wary, but Maili’s face betrayed no emotion.  His hands shook as he fiddled with the zip, rifled around inside.  The sleeve of chocolate digestives crinkled as he shoved it aside, searching.  He furrowed his brow.
His focus tripped over a paragraph and for the space of a breath he froze, reading intently.  He looked up to John.  “She worked for Moriarty for at least two years.”
“Sherlock.”  John’s voice was soft, muted by the wood.  Sherlock’s hand twitched toward the doorknob and fell still.  John was muttering.  “…God’s sake…”
“Yes.”  It had been the most obvious hideout.  Lestrade had taken his officers to the dilapidated estate in Dover, enlisting the local police, but had found nothing.  According to Lestrade, the famed Winter Palace is now little more than a broken, rotting husk of plywood boards and chipped paint.  If Peter has any pleasant memories of that place, they aren’t enough to persuade him to hide there.
“Ugh,” Sherlock grimaced.  “Disgusting.  I’ve changed my mind – don’t touch the sweets.  You’re saccharine enough as it is.”
John looks unconvinced, but he only shrugs.  “Right.  Stay behind me.”  He pats the pocket of his coat, where a bulge tells Sherlock he has brought his Sig.  “Got it?”
and John goes, desperate to fill his senses with Sherlock.  The smell of cigarette smoke and chemicals, all overlaid with a scent John has known so long it simply registers as
Sherlock stares at her.  Mrs. Hudson’s returning gaze is muddled, but as she processes his shock, her mouth pulls into a pitying frown.  “Oh, Sherlock.”
“Bit of a stretch, as far as coincidences go,” said John.  “Moriarty’s old partners are coming to London, looking either to confront or join the new one.  You weren’t just getting Sherlock off the hook with the ‘miss me’ video.  You were announcing yourself as the new Moriarty.”  He looked Mycroft in the eye and tilted a smile.  “Weren’t you?”
The following hour is spent in this vein:  Rosie proposes a film or a specific song, and Sherlock (who has seen them more times than he cares to admit), recreates the score from memory, spinning the music through bow and strings into the evening air.  After exhausting the soundtracks of
In the end, it took a full week for all the children to be returned.  All save one:  a girl, four years old, who had been ensorcelled to dance and promptly forgotten when the fairies grew bored of her.  She danced and danced until her little heart gave out.
“Beautiful,” John murmurs, and brackets the stiff jut of Sherlock’s prick with thumb and forefinger.  Eyes adjusting to the gloom, Sherlock glimpses his wicked grin.  “Now, be quiet.  Don’t want us getting caught, do you?”
The answer comes to Sherlock in an instant.  Frankly, he’s embarrassed that the NSY got to it first, but they had a dozen men to do the work, and none, presumably, with head injuries.  It still rankles him.
John stares back with a mortified sort of shock.  He recovers, sets his jaw.  “I—I said I didn’t have to—”
Pieces of a puzzle began to fall into place, filling gaps of a picture yet unseen. John had been taken to Faerie against his will, kept as a prisoner.
Also - Sherlock being sensitive to lactose is partly taken from my fic “Lozenges” and partly inspired by watsonshoneybee’s adorable Tumblr ficlets.
Greg scratches the side of his neck.  “Hickey.  And…” He chokes the words off, because mentioning Sherlock’s wince when he stood will not only traumatize them, but forever blemish their friendship.
:  darting across the surface of the pond, blurringly swift, flew the damselflies.  Hunting, probably – they were vicious predators.  Even the nymphs ate other insects.  Sherlock watched, entranced, pen poised above the blank page of his notebook.  Waiting for one to come close enough to sketch.
Not a large room, mind.  Barely the size of a broom cupboard, it was tucked away far from anything of significance.  Nowhere near the foyer, the galleries, the halls. He didn’t want John to distract from the Work.
“Sherlock?  John?” Lestrade’s voice rises above the conversation, preceding him into the alleyway.  The DI strides in, hands shoved deep in his coat pockets.  His breath trails him in a lazy plume.  “Ah.  Found Marks and Benson, have you?”
The thought needles pain into his heart.  His elation wanes, just for an instant.  His smile falters.
John bit off a curse and groaned, his body convulsing, hips pumping as he spurted on Sherlock’s stomach and chest.  He was glorious - eyes clenched shut, face creased as if treading the line between pleasure and pain.  As his hand slowed, his eyes cracked open.
John puffs up a little, and Sherlock’s heart stutters.  It is wonderful to see him like this: filled with pride, intoxicated by the potency of his own success.  John wears confidence like a finely-tailored suit, but so often he is relegated to the wings of Sherlock’s stage.  He never complains, never competes.  Even now, he is stealing a moment in the spotlight from the case.  Sherlock wishes he could give John more.
“Well.”  Sherlock stands and reaches for Rosie’s hand.  She takes it obediently, sliding out of her chair.  Her expression is stony as she regards Samantha; the other girl averts her gaze.  “While you’re working out how to
Sherlock stares at his feet.  He feels all enthusiasm for the case drain out of him.  “I’m really not.”
He is in hospital.  Beside his bed, a chair sits empty.  Sherlock reaches for the call light.  Pain flowers down his right shoulder, prickles through his arm where it lays braced against his chest.
John saw his frustration – John saw everything.  He tried to help.  Tried to comfort.  Tried to distract Sherlock from the encroaching gloom with tales of his childhood, promises to acquire a kilt, offers of a roll in the heath.  Small, silly platitudes.  Sherlock loved him for them, but the gloom still hovered on the periphery of his mind, threatening to devour him.
Sherlock tries to thrust faster, but he hasn’t got the leverage.  He throws a hand over John’s shoulder, aiming for the rim of the tub, but his shaking hand knocks into one of the burning candles.  The candle topples sideways, hot wax smearing over his hand, and he yelps and twists away. The sudsy porcelain offers no friction and his knee slides, throwing off his center of gravity, and John’s slick fingers grasp and slip as he topples forward to bash his nose against the lip of the tub, just to the left of John’s head.
“I take it your new girlfriend is younger than you,” Sherlock says.  He doesn’t mean for it to sound cutting, but it slices through the air like shards of glass.
John uttered a harsh sound that might have been a laugh.  “You know what, Mycroft?  Fine.  I’ll do whatever I can to help you catch her.  After that…”  He trailed off, the bravado vanishing as he looked to Rosie.  The baby snuffled and turned toward his chest, lips puckered.
He passed Sherlock in the sitting room, ignored in favor of the electric violin which Sherlock hated so much. He was sawing at it furiously, headphones in place and stopping occasionally to jot down notes of the sheet in front of him. With no chance of getting his attention, John dressed for bed and laid down, completely exhausted despite an easy day at work, but unable to doze off. It was not until he heard Sherlock creep into the room near dawn and collapse on his own bed that John finally settled into a fitful state of sleep.
Sherlock closed his eyes and there was a long pause before he answered, “The whole time,” came a whisper, almost in shame.
Sorry for the delays lately, life is a little in the way but I will continue to update this when I can.
When Sherlock turned away, John was confused. However, as the sunlight came to rest on the pale skin of Sherlock’s back, the marks there seemed to shine. He knew they were there, of course he did, he had felt them. What he hadn’t felt was quite how many there were, marks were scattered across that pale porcelain skin in an unruly pattern like chicken scratch. The shock wore away quickly, no anger brewed at the people who had done this as one may expect, no sadness for the suffering the other had been through. Instead, a pain swelled in John’s chest when he realized that Sherlock had dealt with all of this for him… to save him from Moriarty. His heart was nearly still in his chest as he shifted to his knees and rested his forehead on the place between Sherlock’s scarred shoulder blades. Without hesitation, John pressed a kiss to the scar nearest his lips and could do nothing other than whisper against the mark there, “You’re as beautiful as you always have been”.
Usually when Sherlock decided upon sleeping, he would remain asleep for ridiculous amounts of time. He could sleep from anywhere between a minute and two full days, it just depended on the circumstances. For the most part he slept for a few hours at most which was why the sound of John in the kitchen at the crack of dawn woke him with ease. To be honest, any noise seemed to wake him since the incident, perhaps it could be described as his own form of PTSD. He hadn’t told John but he mostly avoided sleep these days due to shear stress. The amount If available cases had dwindled significantly and his interest in experiments had done the same. He actually found, especially when he was alone in the flat, that he was afraid in way to lose his mind into his usual research. Shaking the thought away, Sherlock listened intently to the clattering sounds coming from the kitchen. He could clearly hear the stove and a frying pan judging by the specifically light change it made when it contacted the hob. He could hear the cracking of eggs and the hiss as they made contact with the heat, on top of that there was the smell. John was obviously making toast as the scent wafted pleasantly up the stairs. ‘He never cooks a full breakfast’ Sherlock thought to himself, face betraying his thoughts as his eyebrows knitted together while he listened into his blogger's movements.
“Not by his choice,” says Catherine.  “He was managing his illness really well, actually, before she got to him.  I… I don’t know the extent of it, but I’m sure she manipulated him, maybe even took his medications from him.  It wouldn’t have been a leap for her.”  Her jaw sets, and a strident note cuts into the robotic tone.  “The Peter I remember was kind and brave.  It breaks my heart to hear what he’s come to.”
“Sherlock.”  John draws back, tipping up Sherlock’s chin so they’re looking each other in the eye.  “I know you better than anybody, remember?  And I don’t believe that you were never sad for a victim before.  I think you were better at burying your feelings.  Hiding them from yourself.”
in the center.  Perhaps it’s the oppressive quiet that has descended over the flat.  Baker Street has become many things since John and Rosie moved in to 221B, but
Sherlock leads John down the corridor, ink-dark and bitterly cold.  Concrete walls press in on them, so tight that when they give way, the contrast is startling: they are out in the open, as exposed as prey in an empty field.
The pipette is pressed into his waiting hand a moment later, and Sherlock fits on a plastic tip without taking his focus away from the scope.  Rosie learned the differences between the pipettes ages ago.  Unscrewing the cap of a tube, Sherlock dips in the pipette, draws up the drug, and adds it to the blood cells.  He sits back, rolling out a crick in his neck.
Cloistered away in Bart’s lab, Sherlock turned his attention back to the bomber’s game.  John hovered at his side.  The mazikeen all but vibrated with tense energy, preoccupied with Lucy’s plight and nervous about the ensorcelled woman in the car.
Inside the flat, Sherlock slumps across the room and sinks into his armchair with a sigh.  John hovers, uncertain.  He should leave Sherlock in peace.  He should go back to Mary.
His fingers slip out of Sherlock, leaving him bereft, but his cockhead is there moments later, blunt and insistent.  Sherlock winces as John breaches him.  Despite the shaking in his arms and the sweat beading on his brow, John moves slowly, carefully.  So very carefully.
“Quite,” Sherlock agreed.  “But even then, I doubt Mycroft would lapse and not notice you.  The moment you walked outside, he would have had you.”
The scene changes; he and Mary are standing beside a warehouse on the banks of the Thames, the night oily-black and clinging all around them.  Waves break against the walkway barricade with the rhythmic slosh of gouting arteries.
“Thank Christ,” Lestrade said as he approached.  John ducked under the tape and followed him through the cluster of police.  “He’s completely fucking mad, John.  I told him to leave and he started reciting Shakespeare at me.”
“John, it’s become clear to me that your priorities need to be altered.  You could have fucked me tonight.”  A thought occurs to him.  “You still could.”
There is no real venom behind the words, so John rolls his eyes in weary resignation.  “Right. Don’t work yourself into a snit.” But he continues his ministrations, fingernails gently scraping the scalp in mute reprimand.
A thin man swayed into the doorway of the back room, brows knitted as he rubbed a handkerchief over dusty spectacles.  The smile twitching over his lips was brief and impersonal.  As he spoke, his fingers continued their cyclic task.
“I’m serious.  Haven’t you heard Rosie when she’s in a mood?  And you think giving her a violin to screech with will improve that?”
Lestrade grunts noncommittally and waves at a figure amidst the milling officers and forensics team.  DI Dimmock waves back, eyes alight as they skim past Lestrade to focus on Sherlock and John.  Insinuating himself through the crowd, the DI approaches with hands clasped beseechingly before him.
I choose my words with care.  “My dad told me about you.  My adoptive dad, that is.  Alexander Grant.  I… ever since I can remember, I wanted to meet you.  All orphans do… but then again, I suppose I’m not really an orphan, am I?”  A nervous laugh bubbles out of me.  I will myself not to bolt for the door and tear down the street, put this whole endeavor behind me.  “Dad, well, he never really said so, but I knew it hurt him.  Until he offered to tell me your name.  So, um.”  I gesture to myself, feeling small and silly and insignificant.  A cast-off child.  “Hello.”
The buzzer rings and John opens the door.  They take the lift to the third floor, where Rosie is waiting in the corridor with Sammy and an older woman.  Sammy’s mother, obviously.  Though she can’t be past her mid-thirties, her dark face is lined with the stress of minding two little girls for a day and a night.
There’s a bang like a gunshot as the door between their rooms flies open, bounces off the wall.  There’s a distorted shout and John’s face is suddenly above his own, eyes wide and streaming.  John races past him, throws open the window, and races back.  Seizes Sherlock under the arms and drags him bodily from the room.
“I love you too.”  Another kiss, this one on his lips.  Sherlock melts into it, kissing with as much fervor as his overtaxed mind and body can give. They part, and John says, “Go to sleep, love.”
A hiss and a squeal of brakes announced the approach of the bus.  It rounded a narrow corner and rolled to a stop, sagging low to the ground as the doors swung open.  Sherlock climbed aboard with John in tow.
The joke snags on a fantasy Sherlock has long held, but rarely indulged; it had always felt too familiar, the clinging remnants of a lovely dream, leaving him bereft when he came fully awake.  But John is real and John is holding him and giggling with him and kissing him, and so Sherlock grips John’s shoulders and steers him backward toward their armchairs.  John’s knees buckle as they meet his chair.  He falls into it with a little
The first time John hears it, he is so mired in exhaustion he thinks his imagination is playing tricks on him.
Sherlock turned his head for a better vantage point and stopped as something in his peripheral vision registered as
Perhaps – and this thought made Sherlock’s throat clot – John knew of how such charms were made.  How silly notions like
John’s perusal skated over a row of windows near the top of the tower—and stopped.  Every  muscle and nerve in his body jumped to attention.
“…think we made a mistake.”  John’s voice struck him as if from a distance – slowly, a building wave gathering speed and power.  He gripped the edge of the kitchen table for support.  His mind flew to the tile not five feet away from John.
John props himself up on an elbow and reaches for Sherlock, cupping his hand at the nape of his neck.  Tendrils of inky hair curl around his fingers as he pulls Sherlock into another kiss.
He catches himself staring, sometimes.  It’s impossible not to.  Sherlock is a force of nature: a forest fire, beautiful and unapproachable.  In John’s dreams, he is warm and pliant and
John had pushed and pushed Sherlock until he was at arm’s length, until he was past it, until he was gone altogether.  Off to wreck himself with morphine and cocaine and whatever-bloody-else he could get his hands on.  And when Sherlock needed him – needed John to drag him back from the precipice – John had hit him.  Again.
I begin a feeble protest, but Mrs. Hudson is already tottering toward the front door.  “Coming!”  The door creaks open, admitting a gasping clamor of the city and a pair of voices.
“Oh, you will be.”  John steps closer, edging into Sherlock’s space.  He stops with his face tilted up, the tip of his nose just inches from Sherlock’s chin.  It would be simple, so simple, to duck his head, seal their mouths together.
“I already do,” said Mary.  “Sherlock could be a problem.  Sure, he’s slowly killing himself, but he’s too clever by far to be dismissed.  Loyal to me or not, we can’t let our guard down around him.”
“Beautiful,” he rasps as Sherlock comes down, spent and shaking.  Sherlock has scarcely a moment to be self-conscious –
Sherlock follows him into the bedroom.  John stands before the bed with a smile, sheepish and soft.  Compelled by an instinct he cannot parse, Sherlock climbs onto the bed and folds on his side.  He shoves a hand under the pillow and looks up at John, expectant.
“Oh, hush,” Mrs. Hudson said.  Her tone was light, but the look she shot Sherlock was venomous.  She offered the first cup to Alexander, beaming as he accepted it.  Lurid roses blared across white porcelain, making Sherlock’s eyes smart.  His lip curled.
Even as John nodded, expression remote, Sherlock cursed his stupidity. Time passed differently in Faerie – everyone knew that.  Taken by the Fair Folk, a man might pass a day in Faerie and return to find ten years passed in the human world.  The reverse was just as likely – John might have passed weeks, months, years in Faerie, and come back to find days gone in the human world.  The trade-off was arbitrary, as capricious as the Fair Folk themselves.
He could ask him now, Sherlock thinks – ask John to spend the rest of their lives together.  To become an irrefutable fact, a truth no one can doubt.  He hasn’t got a ring and he hasn’t got a plan, but he thinks John might marry him anyway.  If he asks.
“Oh, my God,” John is saying, over and over and over.  “Oh, God.  Sherlock.  Sherlock, can you hear me?”
Sherlock stared down at him.  The dusty light from the stairwell fell softly across his face, silvering pale skin and pale eyes with the faded touch of a tintype photograph.  Sunlight pouring in from the windows inside the flat haloed his hair with russet and honey.  Shadows hung under his eyes; his face was cut deep by hollows.  He was still far too thin.
“Are you alright?”  The rumble of Alexander’s voice dragged Sherlock back into focus, and he nodded, smiling.  His head felt large and precarious atop his neck, like the crown of a wilting daisy.
John lowered his newspaper and glared at Sherlock over The Times’ account of the dull business in Birmingham – the one with the stockbrokers.  Sherlock had solved that case in a trice, and the entire nation was going barmy for it.  Luckily, he’d passed the glory off on some promising but browbeaten officer. For him, a famous name would be more hindrance than help.
When Sherlock woke, he found himself cradled in a woman’s arms.  Light, airy voices crooned as he blinked, muddled and confused.
John’s brow furrows, not at Sherlock’s patchy knowledge of the British government but at the stammer.  “Is the cold really that bad?”
“Right.”  John’s face tells Sherlock he doesn’t believe him.  He slips his fingers around Sherlock’s arm and leads him up the stairs.  Sherlock can only follow, mute with shock, certain that to speak will be to crush the fragile hope fluttering in his breast.  He doesn’t want John to stop touching him.
Mary Morstan – the Mary of the past, of sweetness and patience and light – did not exist.  She was an illusion.  She had been created to lure John into—what?  Complacency, marriage?  What would a former assassin want with
“I think she loves Rosie,” said John.  “It’s the most fucked-up kind of love a parent can have for their child, but it
“I’m sorry,” he said, after a weighty pause.  “I only want us to be…”  Again, his throat closed.  He couldn’t say it, couldn’t wish for them to be like they had been before.  That had been a lifetime ago.  He tried a different track.  “Rosamund is a lovely name.”
“Yoo-hoo!”  Mrs. Hudson’s greeting was accompanied with a rap on the door.  “I’ve brought toast and ginger ale to settle your tum, Sherlock.”
“I’m sorry if I seem a little… mad,” Catherine says with a wince.  “It’s just… I’ve read your blog.  I’m a tremendous fan of it.”
For all his powerlessness, Lestrade would not be shown up on his home turf.  Sherlock and John arrived at the Council Tower to find a group of the Met’s worst and dimmest awaiting them.  Anderson and Donovan stood at the head of the pack, directing their underlings with snappy glee.
“I would rather you didn’t break yourself with ridiculous marriage traditions.” Sherlock takes John’s hand.  “Come on, John.  Bed.”
“You ‘somewhat’ said something.”  John gave Sherlock a wry look, decided not to bother, and pressed into the embrace.  He had an idea of what silent words Sherlock had breathed into his skin, but he didn’t dare guess.  He wasn’t ready to reciprocate.
One of Shan’s goons lunged at him.  Sherlock retreated into the shadows, neatly side-stepped the oncoming tackle, and whipped out the fire iron.  He found the nearest patch of exposed skin – the side of the goon’s neck – and pressed the flat of the iron there.  Screams reverberated up the iron and through Sherlock’s arm as the goon’s skin sizzled and curled. The damp air was choked with the stench of burning meat.  As his opponent collapsed, Sherlock withdrew the fire iron and brought the butt of John’s Sig down on his head, knocking him out.
John stands and walks back down the corridor leading to Sherlock’s room, but before Sherlock can question him, he hears the bathroom door open and sees light bloom as John flips the switch.  The sound of water splashing from the spout tells him all he needs to know—and oh, there’s that flutter again.
The shrill chime of Sherlock’s mobile interrupts him.  They wait, suspended on a beat of silence.  A second chime sounds, and just like that, the spell is broken.  John ducks his head and takes a step back, mouth flattening into a thin line.  Sherlock’s hand slides into his pocket, relying on reflex.  A good thing, that – his mind is spinning too much to coherently command his body.
?  If you aren’t going to bring me cases, at least make yourself useful and stop offering your unsolicited opinions and start offering cups of tea, or at the very least, some of your herbal soothers.”
Sherlock doesn’t hear what his hair smells like, because John leans forward, dropping the penlight into his lap and reaching for Sherlock.  John’s hands are on his shoulder, in his hair, thumb brushing the arch of his cheekbone.  And then John is drawing him forward and kissing him, mouth sweet and fever-hot.
Above Sherlock, Zhi Zhu stiffened with a gasp.  His hands slackened on the silk scarf and he pitched forward, the bolt from the crossbow protruding from his back.  Sherlock wheezed, each breath a scrape in his throat. With shaking hands, he shoved the Spider’s inert body off of him.  The fairy toppled to the ground. Dead.
“Ye-es,” John sighs, “because Mrs. Hudson caught me texting her and wouldn’t let the bloody matter drop.  Like a dog with a bone.”
John sits back, pain flashing across his face.  His hand slips away from Sherlock’s fist, and Sherlock has scarcely an instant to feel guilt clot in the pit of his belly before his mobile phone trills.  He lifts it from the table, relieved to see Ferguson’s name flashing above a text. “Case.  And it couldn’t have come sooner.”
Sherlock began walking toward the door, but John rushed into his path.  Halting, Sherlock scowled.  “What?”
“Right.”  John heaves himself to his feet.  “S’pose I should.  Bed.” He rubs a crick out of his neck. “’Night.”
“Your book isn’t drivel, John.”  It is suddenly imperative that Sherlock edit his own words, replace them with something finer, sweeter.  Something worthy of John.  “Your, your book is a marvel.  Better than…” He pauses, rummages through his mind for all those writer fellows John keeps blathering about.  “Shakespeare.”
“Oh, love,” John murmurs.  Sherlock’s heart stammers at the endearment.  John’s hands come to rest on his neck, on his back, so strong and sure.  “Oh, love.”
I'm sorry that this chapter is so recap-heavy.  Later chapters will diverge more from BBC Sherlock canon.
Sherlock watched Mycroft exercise enormous control not to roll his eyes.  It was probably the most exercise his brother had done in years.  Clasping his hands in his lap and pursing his lips, Mycroft said, “Never mind your usual trivia.  This is about the Glamour Laws, Sherlock.”
The old woman is, amazingly, Mrs. Hudson.  She’s ancient, but she flits around like a little bird, energetic enough that I don’t worry she’s going to drop dead the moment I turn around.  After ushering me to an armchair, she bustles into the kitchen and sets a kettle to boil.
“Got you!” Catherine says suddenly, chuckling, and Sherlock startles.  “You’re smiling.  I knew you weren’t as cold as the blog makes you out to be.”
“Thanks for that,” John groused, shoving his hands deep in his jacket pockets and leaning against the bus stop bench.  An errant breeze ruffled his silver-blond hair, giving him a charmingly roguish look.  Sherlock’s fingers itched to smooth the strands back into place.
“You don’t have to,” John calls after her, but she’s already gone.  Chuckling, he shakes his head and glances at Rosie.  She is completely immersed in what appears to be a reenactment of the Siege of Leningrad.  Furtively, John leans forward and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.  “Thank you.  It’s a wonderful gift.”
Harry nodded and began to speak, but Anderson cut her off.  “What about other kinds of Fae?  Spriggan?  Goblin?”
I’d said yes, of course.  I love Dad, don’t get me wrong, but I need to do this.  The greatest orphan fulfillment cliché had been offered to me on a platter.  I couldn’t simply ignore it.
He lapsed into silence for a moment, and John found his doctor’s compassion rushing to the fore.  “It was a terrible time for both of you.  Neither of you could be expected to cope.”
Sherlock feels a blush creep up his neck.  Clearing his throat, he stands and strides over to the tree.  He gathers the remaining gifts – one for John, one for himself, and a last one for Rosie – and brings them back to the fireplace.  Wordlessly, he hands John his box and sits.  John quirks a brow and tugs at the ribbon.
