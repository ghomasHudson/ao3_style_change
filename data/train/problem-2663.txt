Dean feels hope bloom in his chest so big and so fast it’s like there’s a balloon in there, so it’s no surprise Cas manages to get words out first. “We’re on it.”
“You can be whatever you want,” Dean answers easily, finishing off his first corn dog and reaching for a second.
He lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, then, with pink cheeks, says, “Thanks, Donna.”
Truthfully, he’s comfortable where he is, but he’s not about to turn Cas down a second time. “Yeah. I’ll uh, use the bathroom to get rid of some of this wine and brush my teeth so I don’t have to get up again.”
his brain implores him, but it’s too late. His mind has already taken a deep-dive into what other things Cas could moan around, smelling every bit as happy and satisfied as he does now, with those big blue eyes shining up at him and...
Dean glances over and sees Cas pull Winchester out front inside his jacket. That monkey is almost as old as Liam and really starting to show its wear, but Dean feels a surge of affection at the sight of him. Dean re-closed some seams that came loose recently, and Winchester’s left eye has been glued on more times than Dean can count, but Liam loves this dirty thing and Dean knows how happy Liam’s going to be when he sees it.
your eyes are blue.” Castiel blinks in confusion and pulls back slightly, momentarily thrown off by the spontaneity of the comment. Dean huffs out an apology around a laugh, his face so red Castiel is genuinely concerned for his well-being. “Hah. What I—I probably shoulda said is thank you, not something that sounded like a god awful pick-up line.”
Dinner is much more laid back than it was at his apartment. Maybe because they aren’t alone anymore, or maybe because Dean wants to have a normal, unemotionally-charged conversation as much as he does. Whatever the reason, they chat idly over their burgers and shakes.
He’s so used to the castle that he barely notices it as he walks through the sitting room and out towards the back. They’re the royal family in the Land of the Hunters, but compared to some of the other castles he’s seen portraits of in the other lands, what they have here isn’t much. The castle is more or less in the shape of an upside down T with the bedrooms down each wing and the common areas smack dab in the middle. From front to back, there’s the formal sitting room, the throne room, the dining room, and the kitchen, all attached in the middle of the castle. The East wing belongs to his parents, and he and Sam share the West wing. The North wing at the back of the castle is for the full-time staff: Ellen, the cook, Bobby and Rufus, the castle security, Jo, the maid, and two bedrooms for guests that are almost always empty. All in all, the castle has less than ten bedrooms.
“That depends on whether or not you’re going to insist on doing the dishes since I did all the cooking,” Cas says smoothly.
“I suppose I’ll have to continue to suffer in silence, then,” Cas says, offering a half-hearted attempt at a joke. “I know I’ve asked you for more than I’ll ever be able to repay already, but can I ask you one more thing?”
he feels. They keep kissing, slow and gentle but down-to-the-soul deep, and when big hands skirt down his sides to push up his shirt, Dean gasps into Castiel’s mouth. Castiel’s hands feel like fire on Dean’s bare skin, and he pushes up into them, into the barely-there pressure until Castiel’s hands feel heavy and
“Nobody in the kingdom has mucked out more stalls here than I have,” Dean tells him proudly. “You’re free to go, you two. And, uh, feel free to hang out whenever, Jesse. But if anything happens to my horse... well, let’s just say you better be able to outrun me
“If Liam’s yours, you wanna raise him here?” Dean asks, almost afraid to bring up what has them sitting here in the first place.
Dean rolls his eyes with a grin. “You think anybody will do anything for me just because you would.” Cas doesn’t even deny it, he just smiles a ‘
His breath catches in his throat when Cas comes out of the kitchen with a glass of wine in each hand, barefoot and wearing his favorite pair of thin grey sleep pants. He can’t even be mad that they're not the Batman pajamas he mentioned earlier, because these are slung low on Cas’s sharp hip bones, hanging on as if by magic, and he knows from experience that they frame his ass just as well. Cas is wearing a plain, deep blue, henley of Dean’s that’s just a little loose on his shoulders, sleeves rolled up just below his elbows, showing off strong forearms and just a hint of a strip of golden skin where his shirt and pants don’t quite meet. Cas didn’t shave today, so his facial hair is filled in a shade thicker than a typical five o’clock shadow, and his hair is standing up in haphazard spikes, telling him Cas spent a lot of time in the office this afternoon.
Oh. He wasn’t expecting that to be the topic of the upcoming conversation. “I try to help as much as I can, but I know the majority of this falls on you.”
So yeah, Cas looks tired, but he looks the good kind of tired. Happy tired, if that’s a thing. Though Dean still wishes Cas’s alpha would let him sleep a little longer.
“If you remind me, I’ll tell you another time when I’m not being chewed on by a baby with great big, innocent-looking eyes,” Dean says, aiming a big smile down at Grace that Grace returns immediately. “But right now, I wanna know what my mom actually said so I know what kind of damage control I gotta do here.”
It’s amazing how fast the kid can move when he wants to. Five minutes later, the blocks are put away and Liam’s standing on a chair, mashing the shit out of the potatoes. Dean makes sure to give him an extra big high-five when he’s done and tells him how proud he is for being a part of the family, and he’s feeling pretty damn good about himself when he’s got everything ready
Donna scrunches her nose up. “Not so much. I’ll be making a few unannounced visits, but don’t you worry your pretty little heads about that. You’ll be fine. In the meantime, if you need anything, you’ve got my number, yeah?”
“Hmmm,” Castiel says, pulling away enough to give Dean a blatant up and down. “You look so spectacular tonight that I’m almost reluctant to undress you.”
“So fucking mutual, you wouldn’t believe it,” he promises. Dean leans in to peck him on the lips again, making an unhappy whine in his throat when he thinks about saying goodbye again tonight. “I don’t wanna let you go,” he admits, kissing him again. “Every damn time. Being with you is so good, Cas. So perfect.” Again, but this time Cas follows his lips, sealing them together for a longer, firmer kiss that he feels all the way down to his toes. “God, Cas, I can’t believe you’re mine.”
Sam grimaces briefly before turning his attention back to Castiel, and Castiel feels the need to clarify. “Just not when I’m working.”
“Show me,” Dean begs him. The coaxing tone to his voice is low but smooth and burning hot, making Castiel’s insides squirm with arousal. “I wanna feel you.”
Cas chuckles, but beneath that, Dean can hear a bell jingling. He looks towards the sound and sees a sleek black cat with white paws and a pink nose trotting over to them.
to feel like shit. I’d be more worried if it didn’t. Shit, my mom died almost thirty years ago and it still hurts so bad sometimes I can’t breathe. It doesn’t make you a failure to feel that about your own kid, Cas. It makes you
Dean tips his head back and laughs so hard that he falls sideways, effectively bringing them shoulder-to-shoulder as Dean continues to shake with laughter. “Do you gotta be the first or is marriage number two okay?”
out of his chest, and he’s so flustered it takes him three solid seconds before he rolls onto his back to look at Cas.
Cas scans the receipt and then looks up at Dean. “This is from the day before we broke up.” Dean nods, feeling breathless for an entirely different reason now. “Why did you keep it all this time? What’s it for?” Dean pulls the wooden box out from behind his back and holds it between them. A flicker of understanding passes over Cas’s features, but it’s promptly replaced with disbelief and confusion. “I don’t understand.”
Cas says it like he’s talking to a four year old, and Dean goes with it to reach over to grab Cas’s hand and tangle their fingers together. “I don’t wanna,” he pouts, yanking Cas a little closer.
Castiel chuckles again. “I think you’re doing just fine. If it wasn’t for the occasional foot-in-mouth moment, I would think I’m out with a droid or something.”
He remembers Cas saying he’s only okay with soft kissing, so he’s about to pull away to ask if they should stop when a bright light shines into his eyes, and he wrenches away from Cas’s mouth with a wet
“What I remember was fun, too. Gonna be awhile before I party that hard again, though,” he chuckles. “I’m not as young as I used to be.”
“Oh really?” Cas asks. “Because I’m actually starting to wonder how the hell we’re going to get away from this wall with your knot up my ass.”
and Dean starts panting, already fighting the urge to roll his hips down to meet each electric thrust of his finger.
It’s been a really long fucking time since he’s had his dick in anybody’s mouth, and the very first hint of wet, warm suction damn near pushes him over the edge. It feels
Cas follows him towards the door where he stops long enough to grab his keys off the little hook next to it, then he locks it behind him and they’re off. When Cas looks like he’s going to get in his car, Dean tells him, “Hey, uh, it’s just like, three minutes that way. I usually walk.”
That actually raises a good point, and as the elevator opens, Dean asks, “Why do you think she didn’t find out who the father was?”
Understanding dawns and lust slams into him like a freight train. No fucking wonder Cas has been telling him he’s in heat over and over, begging him to do something he was already working towards, sounding broken and in agony every time Dean was sucking on his mating gland.
Of all the responses he expected, being outwardly dismissed wasn’t one of them and it renders him speechless all over again.
“Y’know. Romcoms, Hallmark movies, pretty much anything with Katherine Heigl. And even though I never really do it for myself, I’m a hell of a baker.”
He’d hit the fucking roof if there was one. As it is, he jumps about a foot and curses under his breath when he sees it’s just Cesar. And his... boyfriend?
Cas has already flicked on the light and is working on turning the bolt and opening the door, not wanting his mate to feel a second of pain. When he gets the door open, his omega stands in the doorway, absolutely gorgeous and smelling like heaven. Dean’s eyes search his fleetingly for a split second before he launches himself at him and Cas his arms full of a needy, beautiful, delicious smelling omega for the first time in his life.
“And I may have gotten the whole thing on camera,” Sam says, interrupting their moment and reminding Castiel that they’re not alone.
Having found the condom he was looking for, Cas leans back on his knees and rolls it down his length expertly, watching him the whole time and making him feel all kinds of antsy for a good fuck.
“Hey,” Dean says softly, lifting his one arm to give Castiel more space to move into. His arm cradles Castiel’s shoulders at first, but his hand slowly moves up to Castiel’s neck where his fingers start running through the hair on the back of his head. “You’re forgiven, okay? There’s nothing to be sorry for. Come here.”
Dean laughs shallowly, burying his nose in Cas’s hair to try to hide his dopey smile. “That has a real ring to it, you know. But maybe. What is it?”
“You need me to draw you a map to the couch there buddy?” Dean asks, snapping him out of his thoughts.
never miss an episode of Dr. Sexy, have a Taylor Swift playlist, and I’ve read every Nicholas Spark book ever written. I made myself a white picket fence for fuck’s sake.”
“Holy shit!” she exclaims. “I don’t know what the hell would make him leave when he just met you. He’s been looking for you since the day he turned sixteen.”
He hears Dean call his name with a broken cry, and when he comes back down, he realizes his fingers are covered in cum. He opens his eyes to see Dean’s fingers are threaded between his where they’re still wrapped around his cock, and he sees thick white ropes of cum all over both of their hands and the wall in front of him.
“You’re one to talk,” Dean tosses back. “Cas is the one who wakes up at the crack of dawn with him every morning.”
His ass is a little tender from having sex three times in the last twenty-four hours, but not as much as it usually is at this point in his heat from using a fake knot. His muscles are achy and he’s still slick even though he doesn’t feel particularly turned on, but he could function if he had to, which is surprising.
Dean nods and smiles. “Yeah, that’s how I won her over, too. She didn’t go out for a ride today, huh?”
The way Cas’s pink lips curve sinfully at the same time his eyes flash with heat is fucking pornographic, and Dean feels arousal hit him like a punch to the gut. “Oh, I think we both know dreaming about them isn’t what I really wanted,” Cas answers easily. Like it’s no big deal to admit he’s been thinking about Dean’s lips for five fucking years.
Jo’s on the same wave-length, apparently, because she doesn’t shy away from putting Cas right in his place. “I know we’ve only met a few times, but I’ve heard enough from Dean to know not to fall for
“You are,” Castiel agrees, still breathing hard, but beckoning for Dean to come closer. “Why don’t you come up here on my lap again and I’ll show you just how awesome I think you are?”
“I love you.” Saying it now isn’t the same, doesn’t mean the same as it did when they were together and Cas thought it was all they would ever need, but at least he’s allowed to say it for the time being. He can say it with Dean trembling all around him, with Dean nodding and panting, and riding back on his cock like a dream. “I love you, Dean. I love you.”
“So, this is one of my songs. I wrote it after me and Cassie broke up, but I’ve been thinking about it recently, and I, uh—” He stops, shakes his head at himself. “I’m pretty sure you’ll get why when you hear it. I changed a few words and it just... fit.” He starts looping the intro and shoots Cas a cocky grin he doesn’t feel at all. “I’ve never played this one for anybody before, so I guess it’s like a Dean Winchester exclusive.”
Cas nods and pulls Dean back in for another kiss. Dean lets Cas kiss him slow and deep, and once their tongues are sliding together in a gentle caress, Dean swivels his hips to match the rhythm of their tongues. He starts a slow figure eight, up and around and down and up, watching Cas’s eyes all but roll back into his head with his appreciation for each and every one.
“There’s going to be background checks and interviews, Dean. With everybody. With the people we work with, your doctor, your friends, the people you’ve been out on dates with, with
“So you know that it could all blow up in your face then?” Sam checks, walking across the yard to come closer to them.
eyes looking right back at him like Cas has no idea how easy it is to see it, then he doesn’t have a guitar in his hands right now. He barely remembers singing his way through the chorus a second time, so focused on the way it feels like his heart is beating just for Cas, filling faster than he thought was possible, so damn full he wouldn’t be surprised if it exploded right out of his chest.
Liam nods but sniffles, so Dean just keeps rubbing his back. He wishes he was more like Cas, the kind of guy who knew the right thing to say that might help Liam feel better, but all he can do is be here for him. He considers waking Cas up, but Liam seems like he’s calming down and Cas is already the one who gets the least amount of sleep between the two of them, so he doesn’t. Liam’s breaths are soft and rhythmic, and his little body is nice and warm, and it doesn’t take long before his own eyes are struggling to stay open, lulled to sleep from Liam curled up on him and by Cas’s familiar body bracketing his.
“Please excuse my impertinence, Dean, but if I don’t take the chance to say how absolutely stunning you are right now, I’m not sure I would ever forgive myself.” Dean’s lips part in surprise, and his face feels like there’s flames licking at them despite the chill of the water. “In all the kingdoms in all the lands... good grace, Dean, no one can even begin to hold a candle to your beauty.”
Dean rattles off his address as he climbs into the back seat. Cas slides in after him and all it takes is eye contact to have them drifting together, and then he spends the next ten minutes making out with Cas like they’re horny teenagers instead of the grown men that they are. He’s so into it that he doesn’t even realize the car has stopped until a stern-sounding, “Hey!” catches his attention and he tears himself away from Cas’s lips to see they’ve arrived at his house.
“Y-yeah,” Dean replies, though he finds himself oddly breathless by the sensation of Castiel’s body bracketing his so closely from behind. It’s comforting and stimulating at the same time, and he lets his eyes slip closed as he feels his body relax against Castiel’s. He thinks about leaning back entirely... about resting his head on Castiel’s shoulder and letting the larger man take his weight... about how Castiel might wrap his arms around him and nuzzle into his neck...
Cas wrests his mouth away with a sharp gasp and clarity hits him along with the first full breath he’s had in god knows how long.
“I—” His mouth opens and closes as he realizes that’s what he just said. His cheeks warm up now that he’s being put on the spot, but it’s not like he’s gonna lie right to Cas’s face now that it’s come up. “I’ve been thinking about it, yeah.”
A dreamy smile blooms on her face as she straightens up and tucks her hair behind her ear. “Honestly, I think I loved him before I even met him. Logically, I know it sounds ridiculous, but hearing all of the dorky songs he’d sing and his god-awful voice in my head made me fall for him before I even knew what he looked like.” Castiel nods again, knowing exactly how she felt (minus the god-awful voice part). “But as soon as we met and I saw him smile, it was like that ‘loved you before I met you’ feeling amplified times a million, and even now, it just gets bigger and bigger every day.” She finally looks in his direction, and asks, “Didn’t you feel like that before you met Dean?”
A blush blooms on the girl's cheeks, and she giggles even more. She blinks with soft eyes and a bright grin, moving to delicately twirl a strand of her hair around her finger. "My friend dared me to get your phone number. Do you have a phone?"
Dean finally looks up from the steering wheel, and looks at Cas with an expression that could not be discerned. It brushes away quickly, like one of the snowflakes melting on the windshield.
Stores and stalls line the pier, and the grease is tangible in the air, making it smell sweet, tangy, salty, and everything in between. Salt and sugar litter the boardwalk, as does spilled ketchup or cheese sauce.
Bobby's house sat directly on the beach, which was a short walk from where John and Mary moved in years before. He was always an old family friend, he always made sure Sam and Dean were getting fed and babysat whenever John and Mary had gone on dates.
Castiel did not bother him, instead choosing to sit very still and very quiet as to not bother him and his rest. But he was curious, of course, as to why Dean didn’t even make a poor attempt to reach the easily accessible blankets.
"Dean," Castiel says with a worried frown, the kind that furrows his eyebrows. He follows Dean anyway. "Parties are not what you would call 'my scene.'"
Somewhere, as simple as the crash of the waves or the ringing of bells, something tells him that this was going to be the start of something very special. Very, very special.
Dean laughs easily. He did think, distantly, that since Cas showed up, a lot of people seemed to be talking to Dean that were like him. Like Cas, he corrects quickly. As in, they liked other genders. And these people were all very nice. Charlie, for example, was surprisingly pleasant company, and they had only been talking for a few minutes.
Dean was having such a nice dream. He was standing on the pier, his toes dipped in the frigid water while Castiel held his hand and read to him. The words don't process in his head, but he feels so safe. So calm, wrapped up in the warmth of Castiel's arms while he snores softly into his chest.
Castiel jumps, but after a moment he smiles and waves the sparkler around, watching the popping lights follow the movement of his hand. Dean watches the reflection of the sparks in Castiel's eyes and grins. "It's fun, right?"
"Pretty sure even if he believed me, he'd still talk his way through the police," Dean says dryly. "I'm really just hoping he fucks right off."
"No, thank you. Dean brought me a soda," Castiel says pleasantly. He looks up to see a larger firework explode in a dazzle of green and blue.
John shrugs him off and walks into the kitchen, kicking off his shoes as he does so. "Eh. It's not important. I'm not tired anyways. Where's Sam?"
When he was a kid, his Mom used to say how much she loved the ocean. That she loved it so much, she had to move right next to it just so she could tell it that she loved it every day. She told Dean that, you should appreciate what you have, you should never hesitate to say "I love you" to the things that bring you joy. This is known. This is familiar. This is history.
"I can't believe I'm related to that asshole," Sam says angrily as he walks through the door. "He's such a dick!"
The whisper seemed to settle his confusion enough, but Dean still felt a burning in the back of his throat that even alcohol wouldn't soothe. He knows what he wants. He wants Castiel, if for nothing else than to demand answers to the questions the man put in his head.
He can't feel his face or his lips, he realizes out of thin air. It's just like then. Then is now, and now is then, and time is blurring faster than his vision through the heavy smoke of tears that he's trying to swallow back. John screams at him to stop hyperventilating, to take a hit like a man would. Does he, though? The scream sounds distant. His ears feel like they're bleeding, but when Dean checks, his hands come back wet with only his saltine tears.
Castiel hums shortly, his eyebrows creased in a way that makes his expression indiscernible to Dean. "What about you, Dean? What's keeping you in California?"
"Whatever it is—" Sam speaks up, sounding all responsible and mighty. He has a practiced casualty as he speaks. Dean wonders if he already knows. "—it'll be fine, Dean. Just tell me."
"Your dad is dead too, asshat," Eli glares. Dean can hear how hard he's trying to wound him with the words. But the grief Dean has about John hasn't settled in yet; because it came and went just as often as John himself had.
Castiel does. Slow and sweet, with everything Dean needs for the entirety of his life. When he pulls away, his eyes are blue like the deep sea, and how badly Dean wants to keep Castiel in his pocket and remember him forever. He was his ocean.
He looks back at Sam. His baby brother looks so much older than he remembers him to be. He doesn't have the prickle of inexperienced shaving on his chin, because Dean remembers teaching him to shave when Sam turned thirteen and he had done a damn good job at it. He isn't as short as he used to be, he's no longer looking up at Dean for what to do. He surpassed him in height a few centimeters earlier this year, hasn't let Dean hear the end of it, and stopped asking Dean for help on things even earlier than that.
And suddenly Dean has resorted to the old-fashioned techniques of holding jackets. He shows Castiel down to the games, and they both play skeeball, much to Castiel's extreme joy. It really is adorable, how his eyes lit up and how his smiles were full of such timid excitement, as if he were truly happy and didn't know how to quite articulate it.
He guesses that he must have forgotten to layer the coats of sunscreen. Nonetheless, it hurt like a bitch and added to the anger in his chest, like a spring coiling tighter and tighter.
But as he stares back into eyes that are the same shade of green as the earth he fell in love with, and not finding anything else more important than Dean, he understands even more about what it means to be human.
"Because, Sam. I'm tired. I don't want to talk about Dad. Just—Talk about something else. Literally anything else. Talk about shitty cartoons or something."
Dean smiles at him, deciding not to bring up the fact that he's lived here his entire life, and that the seasalt mochas are better and that the pumpkin spice lattes aren't as good as what everyone cracks them up to be, but the black coffee is good and cheap enough to have in the early morning. "You're adorable, Cas."
At some point during the evening, Dean fell asleep with his arm wrapped lazily over Castiel's waist while he used Castiel's shoulder as a pillow.
Castiel looks up at him in surprise. "I don't think it's something worth expressing gratitude. I was only doing what I needed to, Dean."
Emotions took energy. Every tear made him tired. Dean could not be tired, with the life that he has. He needs to be aware of everything, he needs to be awake. Castiel must have understood this in some way or another, because he has a recognized expression on his face and doesn't argue when Dean said he didn't want to sleep.
Dean's head starts going to the worst of places as he sits next to Sam on the couch. Maybe Bobby couldn't keep them safe here like he said he could. It would certainly shift the way the plan was set up, but something tells him that this isn't what it's about. His trust in Bobby's security runs stronger than his doubt in life's plan.
And while Dean waits for something, anything, any kind of cue from Castiel that he hadn't completely screwed up, Castiel simply squints his eyes as if he'd never been apologized to either.
He hasn't talked to Mary for years. Last time being maybe fourteen, when John's drinking was spectacularly out of control and the beatings were even worse— He let out a prayer once John finally had passed out. He prayed to Mary, because the pastor at her funeral not ten years before told him that she had now been an angel.
In fact, he gets the complete opposite of a complaint when Cas surges forward and catches Dean’s lips in a long, satisfying kiss. It stays light with heat just simmering under the surface for several long kisses, and Dean’s happy to keep it like that for now. He loves kissing Cas, loves feeling Cas’s kisses becoming more confident and less mechanical, and he loves the way their lips lineup so perfectly in so many different ways.
John turns around, looking over his shoulder at where Bobby is once more. “I want them out. I don’t care if we need every guard in the kingdom to drag them out, they’re leaving. All except for Dean, and then you lock the door and whatever you do, don’t—”
Castiel thrusts into him once hard, popping past the first ring of muscle and pushing deep inside, instantly overwhelmed with the tight heat engulfing his cock. They make dual sounds of pleasure as he sinks the rest of the way in, and Castiel strokes up Dean’s back soothingly until he relaxes around him.
The three of them try out several different names for ‘dad’ so that they both don’t turn whenever Liam says the word, but it turns out it’s not really necessary. Liam still calls them Dean and Cas most of the time, with the occasional dad thrown in, and amazingly, they just
“As if they’d ever stay up on your tiny frame,” Castiel laughs quietly. “But not to worry, my prince, I’ll have all of the pajamas in the realm sent to us if they’ll make you happy.”
“Is that really necessary to bring up at the dinner table?” Cas asks him, his voice filled with exasperation.
Okay, there is no way Cas meant that to come out as suggestively as it sounded. Dean meant Cas hasn’t seen anything yet because he hasn’t examined him yet, not because... whatever the hell Cas wants him to do on Wednesday. Cas had never even been kissed before Saturday,
Dean laughs a little, moving in even closer so that he can lay his head on Castiel’s shoulder. “Sorry I don’t have some fancy-ass foreign way to say it like you do.”
Once Grace starts to fuss and he has her bottle ready, he settles onto the couch to feed her. Figuring the best chance of peace and quiet is when she’s busy drinking her bottle, he puts his phone on speaker and dials Dean’s number.
“We should do that sometime,” Dean says. “You, me, Baby, and the open road.” Cas nods his head in agreement, and Dean adds, “But I don’t want to do it for this. I don’t want to go to L.A., Cas.”
“Still resting up from how busy we’ve been with that case, but I’m starting to see straight again, so that’s encouraging,” Sam jokes. Cas laughs a little while Dean frowns and starts worrying about his brother, but Sam continues, “The reason I’m calling is because I finally had time to look over the papers you emailed me about the divorce.”
“Don’t,” Sam says, somehow firm but vulnerable at the same time. “I wouldn’t be standing here with everything I have today if it wasn’t for everything you did back then. So if you’re proud of me, well.” Sam shrugs. “You should be twice as proud of yourself because you’re the one who got me here. I love you, man.”
He stops, breathing harder than he should be already, when one finger presses solidly to his lips. “If you keep begging me like that we’re not going to make it out of our boxers,” Cas warns him with a crooked, unbelievably hot smile. “Do you know how arousing it is to hear you begging for me? Knowing you might want me even a fraction as much as I want you?” Cas drags that one big finger down his chin and to his neck, gently wrapping his finger and his thumb around his throat. His cock twitches again and he rubs himself more frantically against Cas, searching blindly for the friction he’s craving.
Dean leans in and rests his forehead against Cas’s, and nobody’s more surprised than him when Dean says, “I’m gonna marry the shit outta you someday.”
Castiel can hardly form words with desire running through his veins like lava, but he manages to say, “It’ll break. We’ll break the c-crib.”
He hates to do it, but he forces himself to look over at Sam and Jess, and regrets his decision immediately. They’re both looking at him with freakily eager smiles on their face, making him feel like some sort of zoo exhibit or something.
Fuck, Cas.” His voice already sounds desperate, and the next sound that comes out of him is a nearly incoherent whine. He fucks into Cas’s fist with gritted teeth, and Cas
He knew Cas was gorgeous, and he figured he’d be like sex on legs if he ever got a chance to see all of him, but he was absolutely not prepared for the treasure trail leading down to the Adonis belt in front of him.
it!” Then he looks at Cas. “Anytime he has a crush on somebody, he comes up with a ridiculous nickname for them.”
“You’re on your own now,” she says, and even though he knew this moment was coming, now that it’s here, everything feels staggeringly real. Donna looks weirdly somber—for her anyway—and there’s no hint of playfulness left in her voice, making it all the more obvious how big of a moment this is. “It was a right pleasure to meet ch’ya both.” She reaches out a hand for them each to shake, which they do, and then she nods once more and says, “You’re darn good people, and I just know the three of yas are gonna be so, so happy.” He feels panic welling up inside of him and tears gathering behind his eyelids, because how can they make Liam happy when they don’t even know what the hell they’re doing?
going to move to frigging Manitoba, he might as well soak up every night of sleep he can get now with Cas next to him before he’s stuck alone and miserable for good like he has been for the last few hours.
and all he can do is clutch onto Castiel for dear life as they start to move as one. He closes his eyes and luxuriates in Cas’s lips soft but still insistent on his own, in the feeling of his muscles rolling where Dean has his fingers digging into his flesh, the subtle scrape of Castiel’s facial hair on his chin and above his upper lip as he kisses him more and more intensely.
“If I had any brains at all, it would’ve been me,” Dean says. Cas smiles so beautifully, Dean can’t resist the urge to free his hands from Cas’s to frame his face instead. He brushes the backs of his fingers down Cas’s cheek, his knuckles rasping gently against Cas’s facial hair as Cas’s eyelids flutter. “You’re gorgeous, Cas.”
“I believe I’m establishing some ground rules.” Cas’s voice is low but playful, and he wishes more than anything that it didn’t turn him on, but god fucking dammit, Cas’s hard body pressed against him from behind really does something for him.
“Tongues touching has to be weird,” Cas blurts, making them both laugh again. “They’re so slippery!”
The first thing he picks up is a greeting card with a family picture on it. A younger blonde girl in the middle, who looked incredibly bored and very teenage. Beside her was an older blonde woman, most likely the mother, and also a man, probably the father, who wore a suit and almost looked like Cas, if Cas looked even more like a stuck-up tax accountant and you were blind as a bat. Greeting cards like these were expensive to make, so whoever the family was obviously made bank.
Castiel has succumbed finally, but all too late, to the heat of the California summer. Stripped of the familiar overcoat, replaced with tan skin under a white tank top. His patient smile remains the same. He looks beautiful, Dean thinks.
He realizes then, watching the last coin fall to its side, that despite his constant need to keep people close, he's always been so lonely.
Just as routine, it isn't what he expected. It isn't layered on faux sympathy, it isn't pity. It's genuity and curiosity and it's proof that Cas cares. It feels wrong to let his guard down like this, and to talk honestly about what was wrong. But it felt owed to Cas, for him to know, if not for personal relief than for clarity to Cas as to why he had a panic attack in the middle of folding laundry. He wants to tell Cas, despite the way his skin pricks up in discomfort at the thought of speaking.
"Ice-cream it is," Sam says, wrapping an arm over her shoulders and holding her hand. He starts walking over to the stall, leaving Dean and Cas to trail behind them.
Dean forces his eyes to the tile table of the kitchen. He feels a burning white tear slowly fall down his cheek. He wonders if this is what heartbreak is.
"What are you talking about?" Dean scoffs, dragging him lightly by his arm. "It's a party! They're rad. The beer, the music, the babes—Well, for you I guess it would be the dudes, but the point still stands."
Castiel huffs a soft laugh and turns to watch Sam and Jess twirl around sparklers. The lights crackle off of the metal sticks and disappear before they hit the sand. "Well, you know I enjoy our conversations. What do you want to know?"
Dean halts the words, letting them screech back on his tongue like a car going too fast. It leaves a burning rubber taste in his mouth, which he passes off with the shake of his head and a grin. "What about you, Cas? What's waiting back for you in Pontiac?"
"Y'know," Sam speaks up quietly. "I had no idea about that. You saving money, I mean. I'm... Thank you. It means a lot to me that you were even going to save a penny."
As memories go, Dean is reminded of the most vivid one. When Mary held him on her hip, and told him why she loved the ocean so much.
Hopefully Sam's scholarships would take a couple of the numbers off the bill, but that would still leave a ridiculous amount of funds for Dean to pay. Realistically he knows that one summer job won't cover it. He'll have to call Bobby, ask him if he can help cover some of the cost...
The interaction, bizarre as it was, ended there. Castiel left and Dean returned to his lifeguard chair, and the day continued like usual while people of all shapes, sizes, and colours stepped onto the sands of the beach.
And then he's fifteen. Black eye, tucked fists, protecting everything while John slams his arms on the door and yelling to be let in. But this time, Dean isn't huddled in a corner, or gasping for breath that isn't there.
(The sand is thinning out. Cas'll be leaving soon, gone indefinitely from his life. He wants to be swallowed up in the bottom of the hourglass, stuck in time where he's held in Castiel's arms, but he can't be.)
Dean glares. "That's not what I mean. I need to ask you another hugeass favour, and it's got nothing to do with me this time."
Castiel gently grabs Dean's wrist. Dean watches his eyebrows furrow in sincerity, and he speaks every word slow and deliberate.
Another desperate cry. Dean moves in his seat, and his chest rises and falls in a panicked way, as if it was not getting air and getting too much air at the same time. His hands grip the side of the seat tightly.
"Cas," Dean starts. "Are you good? I'm— You weren't supposed to see any of that. I swear, I didn't know he was going to show up."
Dean forces himself to look away before the lump in his throat gets more painful. He shakes his head stiffly. "Sam, I'm so sorry," he says, his voice stripped of his usual defensive tone. "Shit. I'm so sorry."
And, most truthfully, because Dean knows that he could live without John— but he doesn't know what he would do without his baby brother.
Dean feels a hand on his knee and his head jerks up, feeling a shiver go through his entire body. Castiel was looking at him with so much concern it was almost tangible, just like the cloth he holds between his fingers. He has a frown and tightly knit eyebrows, and quietly mouths to Dean, asking if he is okay. Or maybe he had spoken the words aloud, but the buzzing in Dean's ears prevented him from hearing Castiel clearly.
this entire fic was completely inspired by a few big brain ideas with friends and one song in particular called Beach Baby by Bon Iver. as I was working on this I created a hearty playlist that encapsulates the vibes of the story, so if you wanna give it a listen to, here you go:-)
His biggest mistake then was expecting a response, and when he didn't get one, he was heartbroken and didn't do it again after that.
"Castiel." Dean tried the name out on his tongue. It sounded pretentious. It felt like a mouthful. He grits it out anyways, because he's heard weirder and it's none of his business. "What do you mean he was right? I thought you were all pro-homo rights."
"The night is young," Dean shrugs as he stops in front of a motel. "You may as well tell somebody. Maybe I've got some bullshit advice for you to follow."
Eli spins back on his feet, blinking wildly at the ground. The smile was off his face now, and Dean felt a sense of satisfaction. But the fire was still raging, still burning and making his fists itch to punch again.
Dean bites back a groan. Of course the town homophobe is Styne's kid. Not that Dean has to worry about it, considering he isn't like any of their targets, but he can't keep defending gay people out on the street. People talk, and that's not what he needs right now.
What did make sense was blue eyes. Which conflicts directly with the thoughts in his head right now, because Cas is what started all of this confusion. Contradiction is something that should make sense in art, like a portrait using stark values of black and white. But Dean's life has never been art, and the thoughts battling in his head just make him want to sleep.
"I'm just saying," Dean continues speaking, because he's already dug himself into a hole. He can feel the tips of his ears go red with embarrassment. "You're a pretty good looking guy. If I was a girl, I'd hit that."
Dean already feels the need to shower from sweating in the heat all day. He yawns, stretching his arms up as he does so, and then returns to the employee room that sits in the parking lot. He hears Jody call out a positive affirmation for his work for the day.
Yes, this was it. Castiel felt so human, but it was in the most lovely and extraordinary way that he had to grin widely just so his joy wouldn’t seep through the scars on his heart and create sunbeams that would surely be seen from space.
"I'll be okay," Dean promises, his voice soft but firm. He turns his head to the right and kisses into Castiel's dark hair. "You've got things waiting for you in Pontiac. When all this is done, there'll be time for us. We'll try again, maybe. If you want."
There was blood splattered on the ground from where Eli had spit through his sobs. Dean's hands shook as he finally let Charlie pull him back. Eli did not get up, instead choosing to shake in the spot on the concrete where he curled up to defend himself.
Castiel stands stiffly in the corner, looking like an object set out of a match. He blinks and then raises a hand to greet Jody, giving an awkward smile. "Hello."
Dean's gaze follows Sam's, but somewhere along the way gets lost, because he's looking at Castiel. He's making friendly conversation with Jess now, both of them smiling politely. The sun is doing that halo thing again, like it was made just to shine on Cas.
Above them, loud whistles continue, beams of light streaking across the sky to disappear in bright explosions and smoke. They glitter and dazzle with the stars, fading and being replaced with new fireworks every moment. The loudness mixed with the serenity of the moment, each cacophony of bombblast stars in the sky resonating in his chest and screaming gratuity—grateful that he didn't give up before, grateful that he kept fighting to have this moment, grateful that he was the one with an arm around Cas, grateful that he can have a night as golden as the large sun bursts of light in the sky. As Dean watches the previous batch of fireworks fizzle out, he gets an idea.
"People might see us," Castiel mentions, and Dean knows that he only said it for Dean's benefit. "Are you sure?"
Dean raises an eyebrow at John, challenging him to argue. The suspense finally drops when John throws himself forward to throw a punch behind Dean.
"That was the most playboy thing I've ever seen," Jody snorts. "How old are you again? You look like a baby and you're getting all the blonde girls on the beach."
Perhaps it was this feeling that Dean craves whenever he feels the need to lean in. The calm after a storm. The careful beating of drums. The ringing of ears. The adrenaline; beautifully disguised as peace.
Dean doesn't warrant it with a response, instead looking over at Bobby. While they had left, Bobby seemed to have remained sitting beside the phone. "Any updates?"
Dean finishes the dishes, puts away the leftovers, and lets Sam convince him to take the guest bedroom with Castiel. Bobby has gone to bed, and Sam takes the couch. The sun falls.
Maybe it was the feeling of what could be longing, the beginning of love when you're too afraid to call it of its name. The gentle scratch of Castiel's stubble as Dean caresses his cheek, the way Castiel's hand lightly traces the edge of Dean's arm—The intimacy of it all, the deep vehement fondness for each other that came so naturally it was as if tattooed on the very inner marrow of their ribs.
He's exhausted. If he were to guess, he probably got less than two hours of sleep. So much of the night was spent staring at the ceiling blankly, wondering. Wondering about what would happen when the sun rose. Wondering about Castiel. Wondering about Dad. Wondering.
Castiel reluctantly looks back, narrowing his eyes at the nickname but stopping for Dean nonetheless.
Dean feels a wasp nest buzzing in his head. A very sudden overwhelming flood of anger and defensiveness, biting and stinging the pain and embarrassment he feels and making everything so much worse.
The idea of "soulmates" disappeared. The right person—HIS person, didn't exist for so long that it caught him off guard to be so... fond of this man in front of him.
But grief comes later. Now, Dean is trying to catalogue every imperfection on Castiel's sleeping face. The blemishes, the worry lines in his forehead that relax when he isn't awake. He smiles softly at the curve of the cupid bow in Castiel's lip. The peppered stubble on his cheeks. The arch of his nose.
Dean also thinks his dad must have been wrong. If these two girls were sinners, then maybe everyone should have a bit of sin in them. What was so sinful about the way people wanted to be in love with their special person anyways?
He knew distantly from the second he saw that note on the fridge that Dad would be back eventually. But he wasn't expecting to be here, standing up to his Dad, when he finally came back. He's stronger now. He'll use the flames he was given to smoke out this asshole, and this time it'll be someone who really deserves it.
Dean immediately backtracks and walks into the alleyway, just in time to see Charlie throw a fist at Eli's already-bruised nose. Dean smirks and shakes his head, the sinister anger showing in flames in his eyes. "You just can't stay out of trouble, can you?"
"I'm sorry that I suck at skeeball," Dean comments as they walk away from the stall. He's wearing a grin, nonetheless. "Maybe I could've gotten you one of those fake rings or something. That's a cool tourist thing, right?"
"How about I walk you?" Dean speaks up. "You asked for a new hotel place right? I can walk you to one, it's not far."
He ducks his head down, his eyes still burning with the red heat of tears. He's exhausted, and he's guilty, so he pulls his hand back despite the itching to keep it over Castiel's hummingbird heart. "I'm sorry, Cas."
"Do they have skeeball, you think?" Castiel asks, looking over at Dean with the most apprehensively hopeful expression.
"Alright, Charlie. You're going to be okay." Dean cleans the wounds off with rubbing alcohol, but Charlie doesn't even flinch. Dean thinks she must be in shock, which he was told was a normal experience. When he had drowned, he felt pretty whammied too.
He expects Cas to say anything, really. He expects him to laugh and tell him that he's batshit, or to give him those sympathetic eyes that everyone else gives him and to say that he's really brave, or maybe to say something completely neutral, like to bring up the cost.
"We should go get ice-cream!" Jess suggests, nudging Sam in the waist. "That would be totally wicked. I hear they have a new recipe this year."
Castiel narrows his eyes but slides out of the bar. He puts down five dollars on the table. "Thank you again."
Dean's heart sinks in his chest. This is the first time he's dreaded hearing Cas's voice. Dean doesn't turn to look over at him, instead watching John as if he's a python ready to launch with its sharp teeth. With Cas behind him, he feels a surge of bravery. "You didn't pay for shit, old man. I'm the one who's been paying the late bills while you were off dicking around with slot machines."
Dean shrugs, the smile not leaving his face. "It's nice to be able to talk to somebody who could have been gone," he explains, but then pauses. "Does that even make sense?"
And while the air has a fuzzy grey haze over it due to the chemicals, Dean can see Castiel clear as day, smiling as he waves the sparkler around. He flicks the lighter off, relishing in the warmth of his chest as he looks at how happy Cas was.
-saving from drowning scene, not serious and nobody is hurt. (dean works as a lifeguard trainee and saves Charlie's life, but she isn't in serious danger and is okay)
Dean sighs tightly, thinking of that damn mason jar. He can tell Cas, though. Cas seems like the type of guy to keep a secret safe. "Yeah. I'm saving up for my smartass brother to go to college. He wants to be a lawyer, or something. My dad refused to pay and then took off; haven't seen him since."
"No." Dean shakes his head quickly. Hospitals were too expensive. "You've done enough. Just— Leave me alone," he shakes, his lips blue from the freezing water. There's a phantom pressure of where Castiel's lips have been.
What he can control is being angry at Cas, because never has Castiel deserved this forest fire rage, and today is not the day to start giving it to him. He will not be angry at Cas. He stands up to leave.
He’s never seen the angel look defensive, but now, Cas was standing up and looking as though he was either about to fight or flee. Sam saw how his shoulders were tense and his eyes carried a blur of hopelessness and fear.
Castiel huffs quietly. Dean's curiosity gets the best of him and he starts rifling through the bag like a little kid going through their Christmas stocking. After going through layers of the same dress shirts and pants, he finally finds items at the bottom that are worth his time.
"I think it's incredibly righteous of you to raise money for Sam," Castiel says. "I've been thinking of it a lot since you told me. I think you may just be the kindest soul I've ever met, in all of California and of Illinois."
It was addicting. Even the gentle clash of teeth made Cas feel alive, like he was just as buzzed as the bees pollinating the flowers outside. Kissing Dean was everything he imagined it to be, like electricity and warmth, like blood and bone, Spring and Winter, sun and rain.
It takes several seconds for his words to sink in, but once they do, Dean frowns. When he pulls away and looks to the side, he sees Gabriel standing there with something in his arms and a shit-eating grin on his face. He feels like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, but he's glad Castiel doesn’t push him away. Although Dean moves enough so that he’s no longer hanging off of Castiel, Castiel winds a protective arm around him that keeps him nice and close.
He doesn’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth, but at the same time, he doesn’t want to do something that’s going to make Cas uncomfortable, either. “You sure?”
He knows even as he’s doing it that he’s making his third unforgivable mistake, but after hearing Dean lay it all out like that, what else could he possibly do besides nod along?
“Everything’s ready over here if you guys want to come eat,” Cas says from the kitchen, his perfect timing saving him from trying to explain that sometimes his way of showing affection is by teasing people. “Liam, can you go wash your hands, please?”
Cas pauses and Dean shakes his head to tell him not to. “I’m good, keep goin’.” Cas looks unsure and pulls out just a little bit in order to press back in more slowly, inching deeper one second at a time until he gets past the worst of it and slides home nice and smooth. Dean’s breath comes out in a strangled-sounding, “Hnnnng,” as Cas bottoms out, finally taking in a nice, soothing breath as he tries to stay relaxed around Cas’s cock inside of him. “Fuck, that’s good.”
to be in the house where it happened, so I moved out. I had a few paid weeks of bereavement from the office, and I used that time to get an apartment. But when my time was up, I was having a hard time going into work. Everybody—they just kept
“I’m sorry I didn’t know you wanted me to stop sooner,” Cas says quietly, and he can tell by the way Cas’s voice sounds that this is something that he’s going to beat himself up over for a while.
“I’m, uh, not actually. A mechanic anymore, I mean. Couldn’t find a job when I moved here. I work in a shop, but I’m just the parts guy.”
Cas turns to Dean, shooting him an amused smile. “A four year old gets it.” Dean can’t help but smile back, at least equally amused by how Liam’s completely owning this woman without even meaning to.
“It really does,” Dean agrees. “Hey, we should spend tomorrow baking for the neighbors. Ellen and Jo, Miss Moseley, Donna.”
Castiel gets a sleeper out of her drawer, and then Dean lays her down gently on the changing table and works on drying her off while Castiel gets a diaper ready. They have her in fresh clothing within minutes, and miraculously, she doesn’t cry the whole time. Castiel picks her up, pops her soother into her mouth, and for the first time in hours, she takes it without immediately spitting it back out.
Cas chuckles quietly, and Dean’s fingers stroke through his hair as he watches Cas clean up the leaked milk from his other breast before he latches on. Cas makes another low sound of bliss and god, maybe this whole thing is fucked up, but watching Cas and seeing him with his eyes closed and his face slackened with pleasure because of something Dean’s body produces is one of the sexiest things he’s ever seen.
Dean rolls his eyes in response but doesn’t get into it anymore right now. They’ll see that he’s happier now with Cas as his friend than he has been in longer than he can remember, he just has to give them time. “How’re you two doing? How was the drive?”
“I would if you really wanted me to,” Cas says softly. “If you’re lonely or have a hard time staying awake—”
No!” Dean barks. He whirls on Cas, pissed off and insulted at the same time. “How dare you put that on me? You think I wanna stay here and try to work this shit out without you, knowing you’re gone because of me?”
him? But Cas also said that Dean’s all he has, and the last fucking thing he needs is for Cas to have gratitude all mixed up and confusing Cas into thinking he has romantic feelings for him when he doesn’t.
on the weekends, and by the time Grace is three months old, most of Dean’s clothes and other belongings he needs to get through day-to-day have migrated over to Cas’s place. When he goes home on the few nights he doesn’t spend with Cas, it doesn’t feel the way it used to. A part of that is because he misses Cas and Grace, but he knows the biggest part is that his house doesn’t smell like what he’s beginning to think of as his family
Dean huffs a laugh. “Is that right? If my surprise involves behaving, I don’t know if I’m gonna like it very much.”
Castiel straightens up from where he was in a crouch picking flowers just to walk over to kiss him, melting his insides like butter from the abundance of tenderness. Something has shifted between them since they made up earlier—since Castiel admitted to the depth of his feelings, maybe—and he can only hope Cas feels the same unshakable knowledge that what started as a forced relationship is now more real than anything he could have predicted.
Charlie stops dead in her tracks, and Dean uses her arm to twirl himself instead, laughing the whole time.
“‘s okay. We’re learning as we go,” Dean says softly. All those hundreds of kisses to his chest and shoulders really seem to have shifted the mood, and while it was undoubtedly hot and fast when Cas had him up against the wall, it’s much more tender and loving now. “I know you were into it, but I don’t think my legs can take the hands and knees thing again yet.”
Dean’s looking back at him. They make eye contact for the first time in what feels like hours, and the fire in Dean’s eyes sends goosebumps down his spine, but this time, it’s not because he’s scared. “You’re mine.”
of going to talk to Cas right now, and he decides to wait it out until Cas comes to find him. He doesn’t even bother turning on the TV, he just lies there in the silence of the house, actively working on keeping his mind blank.
An incredibly dirty flick of his tongue has Dean moaning into his mouth again, and Castiel pulls away to nip at his swollen flesh, then soothes the sting with a slow swipe of his tongue against his lip that has Dean pushing his tongue out of his mouth to meet it. Castiel kisses him deeply, thoroughly, claiming his mouth in a searing kiss that hits him so sharply between his legs that his hips tilt forward mindlessly, unintentionally but
Donna attempts to keep a straight face for a single second before she lets out a surprised bark of laughter. “Well thanks for spellin’ that out for me, sweetie.” She grabs the last remaining plate on the table and serves herself a pancake. She seems to hesitate for a few seconds, then asks, “Do ya happen to have peanut butter I can grab?”
He and Dean are going on a date — their first official date — for Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday, but they’re going out the night before so that they can have a good time without having to worry about work or responsibilities the next day.
“I’m gay,” Dean repeats. “The reason I couldn’t find any women I was interested in is because I’m not interested in women at all. I’m interested in men.”
Dean grins and rubs his hands up Cas’s thick thighs, slowly inching towards his half-hard cock. “Let’s see how you feel about that in a couple of minutes.”
and so it’s one of the best kisses of his life. It seems to go on forever and end way too soon, and then he’s flat on his back again with Dean curled up on his chest, and he has no idea how two grown men like them fit so easily on Dean’s couch, but there’s no doubt that they do.
He owes Cas so much. More than Cas will ever really get. And whenever the snuggly little guy wakes up, he’s gonna take a leap of faith and tell him he’s officially off the hook. He’s gonna tell Cas all he wants is to make Cas as happy as Cas makes him, and he can’t think of a better way to do that than to make Cas stop worrying about that damn secret. He’ll tell Cas how much he means to him, how much he cares about Cas, and that he forgives Cas for whatever he lied about as long as Cas can promise him they can move forward with no more secrets.
this. He hates Dean’s pathetic excuse of a father, he hates that John took away Dean’s childhood and his career choice as an adult, and he hates how hard Dean worked to provide for Sam only to have John take that away too. But maybe more than anything, he hates that there’s not a single thing he can do to make any of it better.
Without letting Cas’s cock fall from his mouth, he moves the hand from Cas’s dick to grab at one of Cas’s hands and tugs it onto his head. The other hand moves there on its own, and Dean hums around Cas’s dick to let him know that’s exactly what he wanted. Cas’s fingers push into the longer hair on top of his head and Dean hums again, hoping if he’s vocal enough, it’ll to encourage Cas to —
Dean leans in and kisses him full on the mouth, holding Cas there with his hands framing his face and their lips pressed firmly together for several seconds before he pulls away just to peck his husband’s full bottom lip consecutively over and over.
Dean tries to hold back the snort of laughter that bubbles up from hearing Cas say both “fuck” and “cop a feel” in the same sentence — two things he’s never heard Cas say before — but it escapes him anyway. To his relief, Cas’s lips quirk, too, and the next thing he knows, they’re both absolutely cracking up. He’s never seen Cas laugh so hard before, and yeah, Dean currently has beer-flavored pubes, but it’s definitely worth it to see the way Cas’s nose scrunches up and his gums show above his teeth.
Castiel shrugs his shoulders, trying not to make it that big of a deal. “I know you haven’t been sleeping well and the pregnancy is starting to wear on your body. I can’t do much to help on my own, and with your sweet tooth, I thought this would help cheer you up.”
Dean’s high starts to wear off as they gather and rinse beer bottles and champagne glasses, load the dishwasher, and toss the noisemakers and anything else that was left out that shouldn’t have been. By the time the living room is habitable again, he feels like he’s going to fall asleep on his feet. He and Cas head into the master bedroom, and Cas tells him to go ahead and use the bathroom first. He brushes his teeth, empties his bladder, and strips down to his boxers to crawl under the covers.
They scent each other, huffing in the other’s scent until they’re both satisfied enough to meet for a series of fast, needy little kisses that leaves Castiel selfishly wanting more when Dean pulls away to scent Grace next. “Hey Gracie girl,” Dean says, kissing her hello and earning a slew of happy-sounding baby babble in the process. “Oh really? My mom told Daddy something embarrassing about me when I wasn’t there, huh?”
“This doesn’t change anything,” Cas says suddenly. Dean only huffs against his skin. It changes fucking everything and he knows Cas knows it. “I’ll still be here with you as often as I can. I’ll come back at every opportunity and miss you every moment we’re apart. I’ll burn with jealousy anytime you touch someone else -”
Cas’s eyes widen and his eyebrows lift like he’s trying to prompt him. “Do you not remember dancing?”
Because his eyes are still trained on Cas trying to assess his expression, he answers distractedly. “Still pretty nervous but Cas got a bunch of kid stuff yesterday and Donna brought over Liam’s stuff, so we’re as prepared as we can be, I guess. We’ll just have to wing it.”
“She really does,” Dean agrees. “She has that great fresh baby scent now that we gave her a bath, too.” He takes in a deep breath of the top of her head as if to prove his point and then aims a smile at Cas. “Alright. Now that she isn’t screaming anymore, how about you let me work my magic and put the kid to sleep while you go take a nap?”
Cas situates Grace in the crook of his arm, fixing her hat and looking every bit like the experienced parent Dean knows Cas isn’t, and it tugs at his heartstrings so much that he blurts, “I want to.” Cas looks up at him questioningly, and Dean explains, “I like babies and I live by myself, so I can drop what I’m doing anytime to give you a hand. Honestly, even if you want me to hold her for a bit so you can catch up on sleep, I’d be happy to do it. Really.”
Cas rubs his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand. “That scares me, too,” he admits. “But it might not happen. Maybe you and me... maybe we’ll get along as well as a couple as we have as roommates.”
Dean keeps shoving forward, more and more of his knot forcing itself inside of him, loosening his rim and making a wet squelching sound with every thrust. Castiel is forced up onto his toes once, twice from the rocking force of Dean’s pounding, and then on the third powerful thrust, Dean’s knot pops inside. The massive, unbelievable pressure inside of him steals his breath, and Castiel is shoved flush to the wall with his arms still stretched over his head as Dean spills deep inside of him with a ragged, broken growl.
Sam rolls his eyes and stands up. "That's what you say right before you embarrass me. I'm going to be late, I gotta go."
Dean inhales deeply and doesn't immediately deny it, despite his mouth opening to do so. He gives sort of a choppy nod. "Yeah. Whatever, though. It's not important or anything. You don't even have to bring it up, I know it's weird."
"The Stynes beat me up. Turns out they didn't like me defending some of the smaller guys roaming around town. They think I'm a homo," Dean scoffs. "I got beat up bad, and by Monroe of all people."
"So, what do you think of California? Dean show you around some more places?" Sam asks him. "It seems like you two hang out all the time."
“But... When I wrote that, I was frustrated. I—I try to manage these feelings in very tight box,” Cas continues. “And sometimes it gets to be too much. I just—I needed—“
He imagines the sight that Castiel implies. The blue-eyed dumbass sitting alone, eating a pizza slice in a dark motel room, probably wearing his full suit and trenchcoat get up, and for some reason Dean imagines that it's completely silent. He probably wouldn't even turn on a television, or a radio, or even a cassette. The thought makes him unbelievably depressed, and he isn't even the one in the daydream.
Revealed through maybe a journal entry in John's possessions after he died that Mary was going to skip town as soon as she gave birth to Sam and abandon them at the hospital, BUT she died during childbirth. Dean feels betrayed by this.
And all of the sudden, Eli just looked like a kid. A terrified kid. The fire extinguishes faster than any flame could, and it just makes his sudden guilt worse.
Dean cycles through a list of how he's been acting lately. "Off" would certainly begin to describe it. It was as if he was looking through the world in a new lense since the bonfire on the beach, and while it had only been two days, he certainly did feel strange. It shouldn't matter, it shouldn't affect how he sees anything, and yet now he sees more shades of grey than he sees of the rainbow.
(But it wasn't the whole picture. It never would be. Dean paints his mother as the innocent idealizations of a young son who loved his mother more than anything in the world, and he knew that he would never really know her. He had known this since she had passed away, which is when John had started to change and say things. Things that...)
Castiel nods firmly. "Yes. I was wondering if you could still give me directions? I know you were probably just headed home."
He picks it up and sets it in Dean's lap, and then sits beside him on the bed. "You can look through the entire thing, if you want to. You won't find anything licentious."
Dean stares at him, blinking with perplexity as he debates whether or not to be offended. Before he can say anything coherent, Sam walks back to the group. Dean scoffs and follows him.
It was lovely, no doubt written from Cas to Dean, but it was heartbreaking. The whole thing was written in such desperation. From the way there isn’t a pause between each letter and the way the paper is indented from the pressure of pen used by the authour.
It hurt to think about, like a painful emptiness in his chest that stuck in a melting pot of the light Castiel currently had, because he was right in front of him, and he wasn't gone yet.
It takes a second of nothing before Dean shakes his head. He pulls the seatbelt over himself, this time with no interruption. “Nah. You’re just fine, Cas. Just fine.”
Castiel was unlike anybody he's ever met. He would show up in the oddest of places, often acting and speaking in the most peculiar and unorthodox of ways. Why was Castiel here? Why did Castiel seem like he always had a greater purpose of simply existing? He was like a puzzle that he couldn't solve; a great big jigsaw puzzle with hundreds of pieces, many of them upside down. Dean imagines that each piece is a different shade of blue, just like the man's eyes.
This wasn't supposed to be a night of self reflection. This was supposed to be a night of drinking, dancing, maybe a clumsy hookup with some beach girl, and more drinking.
"No," Castiel says indecisively, "I was really just going to go back to my motel room and eat dinner."
The sudden relief that floods over Dean in waves is unexpected but he is entirely grateful for it. Instinctively, he surges forward and grabs Castiel by the lapels of his coat, pulling him closer and planting a firm kiss on his lips.
Dean thinks maybe there's a reason why it hasn't sunk in yet. His mind is still waiting for the morning. His mind is still staring at the ceiling in the dark. His mind is still waiting for John to show up.
Things will never be the same after this. But that doesn't matter much now that Castiel is leaving. He has to say it. He needs Cas to know before he goes.
"This is so stupid," Charlie laughs breathlessly. "I'm not a surfer girl, I'm a computer nerd. I work at RadioShack."
Sam comes back from the grocery store to find Dean sobbing loudly over the library table, a pencil held limply in his hand as he poured over a book. Not two, not three, but five bottles of beer were on the table beside him. Sam thinks two of them aren’t even fully empty.
"He's got blue eyes, Mom," Dean murmurs, his eyes struggling to stay open. The mason jar on his desk blurs in his vision. "Blue like the ocean. I'm obsessed with 'em. They're so damn gorgeous. I didn't know guys could be pretty, but Cas is the prettiest thing I've ever seen."
He also knows that Castiel makes good company, and he needed that, he truly did. He knows that Cas is a good guy to go to for problems, and that he would listen and unconsciously make sure Dean knew he was listening, with the famous way he tilted his head to one side and squinted carefully, letting his lips pucker out in consideration.
"I was wondering if you wanted to go to the fair with us," he explains. "Us being Sam, Jess, and well—Me. It would be another tourist spot, but it could be fun."
Sand is still stuck in his toes after rinsing them off with a hose, which he really does hate when he's no longer walking on the particular golden terrain. He sighs and starts walking down the empty road.

Things had blossomed into something new, lately, with a spring view rather than a summer one. Now it feels to Dean as if he doesn't need to be blackout drunk every other night. He's feeling better than he has in a long time—and Charlie was right. He should feel proud. He's learning to let people in, and he knows it, because he can now count on his hand the number of people that he knows would care if he said he needed something.
Choose one, Dean thinks in the back of his head. The corner of his mouth drags up into a bitter smile as he thinks of a list. The fact that he gets hit whenever his dad is home, the fact that he only just turned twenty one and he's paying for the house himself, the fact that he misses his mom sometimes, but only when the house has settled for the night and Sam is asleep. The fact that, deep down, he isn't jealous Sam is going to leave to somewhere better, he's just terrified of being alone.
"I think you two would have gotten along great," Dean says. "Really, I believe that. Mom liked to think before she talked. She was thoughtful and stuff like you were."
Castiel pulls out his wallet and leaves a five dollar bill on the table as Dean stands up. Together they walk out of the diner. Dean makes a mental note of how strange he thinks it is that time seems to shift quicker during the peaceful quiet that occurs after the darkest and most threatening storms.
The honey halo that sits over Castiel's head when the light frames his figure just right. The Ferris wheel; the fair.
"Just take the compliment, Cas," Dean all but pleads, silently begging for the conversation to be over.
Castiel frowns, his eyes set in a deep practiced confusion at this new variable. Dean was not awake, this was a fact. Why was he making noises, especially in the uncharacteristic variety of weakness, in his sleep?
The line stings. Dean is sure that it's meant to. He shakes his head quietly and his eyes glance to the side. "No, I— I wanted to apologize about beating the crap out of you. And I'm sorry about your dad."
Castiel looks over at Sam, nodding. "Dean is a wonderful person, he's very friendly about showing me around the city. I have to say my favourite part about all of it is the environment."
John narrows his eyes. "So you do. Good for you, boy. Is she pretty? I was about your age when I met..."
Dean waves him off and disappears into his bedroom. His bed is more comforting now than ever, and he collapses on it heavily, letting his body weight sink into the mattress. He can clearly see the jar sitting on his desk.
"Our love will just have to be ephemeral," Castiel says, softening his expression into something much more lovely. His blue eyes are full of bittersweet promise; and Dean is caught between thinking he never wants to see it again and wanting to look at Cas for years.
(She told Dean that, you should appreciate what you have, you should never hesitate to say "I love you" to the things that bring you joy.)
It's a question asked in a half-joking tone, but it has Dean thinking nonetheless. It felt good, seeing people looking at him like he was a hero. For all the work that he's done before, he's never been treated like he was anything bigger than sand under a shoe. The contrast, he thought, was one of the nicest things to come out of this job.
Castiel's eyes meet his and his lips quirk upwards in a pleased sort of smile. He was radiant. A sunbeam. No— a moonbeam, like the iridescent pale glow over water, through fogged glass, or through tired eyes. Mysterious, not through kept secrets anda repetitive shifting of eyes, but more so like he was a great painting that had only been sketched out yet, not fully formed in the portrait of his beauty.
"Nothing, huh?" Bobby steps away, letting Dean come into the home. "Because that totally explains why you look like you got run over."
Kissing is a delicate thing. There are feelings—not the emotional kind— that envelope the nerves in the brain. For Dean, he's never felt anything as honest and whole-hearted as Castiel.
"In addition to tourists," Cas speaks up, furrowing his eyebrows and tilting his head. "Why didn't you tell me about the spot on the beach?"
He looks out the window, at the ocean; and through all of his anger, through all of his overwhelming disappointment and crushing guilt, he stops, and he breathes. He sees the waves moving in tandem with each other, and sees the dark midnight blue of the water.
Freakin' weird, and yet Dean can't look away. He pays close attention as Cas almost lets himself smile. The sun melts away at the 'ice' bit of the treat, causing vanilla to drip down his fingers.
He raises his eyebrows once he realizes that the note is written in Enochian, but furrows them with confusion once he realizes that the writing is all... backwards?
This is what it feels like to have somebody to count on, Dean thinks, other than myself. It's a feeling he hasn't had since he was just a kid, so long ago and washed away from tears and built up walls that he had forgotten what it was like. But he's learning again, and he's not quite an old enough dog to be hopeless about it. This boyish man can still relearn tricks, especially with people in his life like Cas and Bobby.
The fire is dangerous. It is violent. It will wipe out everything in its path before he can even blink, fueling by the smallest of mistakes from someone who has done wrong. In this case, that someone is Eli, who is breathing oxygen into it without knowing the consequences.
"You really should leave people alone," the second voice spoke. "Especially when your religious information is falsified. God has no particular bias against homosexuals."
Despite the people around him dancing and shouting with glee, drinking bottle after bottle, Dean feels peaceful. He's happy just waiting for Castiel, sitting in the sand quietly and observing everything.
Castiel looks, for the first time, rather guilty about this. He frowns and attempts to make a full step away from him. "I'm sorry, that isn't what my intentions were. I have to admit that I'm not very good at socializing—My brothers always—Well, it doesn't matter what they said, but they made sure I knew about it too."
"Dean," Cas says behind him. Dean finally turns to really look at him for what seems the first time since he's woken up. He was beautiful as always, crystalline blue eyes and an expression full of a concern that could only come from somebody who actually cares.
Castiel only smirks, just for a second, before his face goes back to being neutral. "What did you come to say?"
"They're heinous little spazzes. Stole my sandwich one time. I totally freaked. Never liked them since."
"I don't know," Dean says with amusement. Castiel looks adorable, really, he did. But in the way that a puppy is adorable, he backtracks quickly. Not like a 'wow he's adorable' or a 'I wanna kiss you' adorable, because he's not gay. He's straight as hell, honest. "People have all kinds of secrets."
The anger in Bobby's eyes quickly is replaced with a roughly created worry. "How are you not dead, boy? You should have shown up after it happened, I would have driven you to the hospital."
Dean blinks several times. He repeats the sentence in his head twice, mouthing the word once, and then looking away. Both. It makes sense, in retrospect. It isn't when you got a burger, you were supposed to either like mustard or ketchup. Nobody expects you to like one and not the other, and nobody faults you for liking none or both. It's a preference, isn't it? Anybody can like both. Dean can like both, too, if he wants.
"My mom always loved the ocean," he says, looking out at the salt sea bubbling and twisting into each and every wave. The last of the sun settles over it, gleaming onto the metal bars of the Ferris Wheel. "She used to tell me that if I ever loved something as much as that, I should say it whenever I could."
"Mama, why do you like the ocean so much?" Dean asks curiously, looking out the kitchen window as the waves fall over each other. He was four years old, and he wanted to understand.
Dean sniffs once and just jerkily nods at him. It was enough to say he was okay, although nonverbal. Shaky, but okay. His head is running a thousand miles a minute, so he sits down on the couch and sighs heavily.
Castiel in of himself is another thing that has solidified in the past week. He's never had anybody make him feel more rightfully himself, moreso, himself in a positive light.
"My son says you're defending the homosexuals," Monroe states, crossing his arms. It only makes sense that it's what they are there for, but the very notion is still ridiculous and Dean has to use every muscle in his body to keep from rolling his eyes.
"It's over thirty-thousand," Dean admits quietly. "And I know it's the most I've ever asked of you, but Bobby, I need your help with this."
Castiel tilts his head to the side and squints his eyes again. Dean is about to make a joke about this, probably saying something along the lines of how he looks like a robotic puppy, but he holds his tongue in sport of not wanting to come off offensive for yet another instance.
Castiel stares at him with such guilt, such hurt. Dean felt a twinge of regret seeing the offense cross his face. He's finally done it. He's hurt the one person who never deserved it. He feels his silver heart crack in the hands of the man in front of him.
"Do you look like somebody who gets to tell me what to do?" John sneers, stumbling towards Dean, his arms swinging at his sides with his drunken stupor. "You think you're a man now? I remember when we brought you home. You're no smaller than you were then."
Castiel has left the trenchcoat at his motel room, and when he was previously bundled up like a nun, he was now wearing proper summer attire. As in, cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt with sunflowers and bumblebees on it that fit him too perfectly to have been found at some tourist shop. Nonetheless, Dean feels his heartbeat speed up, because Castiel looks just as comfortable as he is handsome.
