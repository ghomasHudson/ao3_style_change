“Oh! Right! Um, uh, yes, your highness,” said John, slightly flustered. He had never done this before.
George W. Bush brought out some cookies. “Yeah bro. I agree. John, I think you took too much dank ass weed, yo.”
In response, John grabbed Sherlock’s schlong and kissed him long and hard. Sherlock laughed. “You’re a feisty one! Let me return the favor, my dear boy,” he said as he palmed John’s jeans.
, thought Sherlock. Clinton was infamous for switching positions whenever it was to his advantage, and Sherlock was thankful for that point of criticism. “Well, Levi, thanks for the question. Clearly, the Supreme Court made the only correct decision when they allowed for nationwide gay marriage: or, as I like to call it, marriage. It’s clear from you and your husband that homosexuals can contribute to all marks of society, regardless of their sexual orientation. Love wins.”
A twitch hit Sherlock and manifested straight in his cock. “Yeah Daddy,” he throbbed, unzipping his pants as well.
“You’re a fucking idiot, John. What the hell! You might as well drop out of the election now. I’m quitting,” Corey said.
“John… Just… Just lay low, ok? Don’t let anyone know about your interaction with that Holmes-Sanders guy… You know… You could shit talk him on Twitter, yeah? People would like that a lot.”
The debate ended a few hours later. It was a really rough one for John. He was confronted by Corey, his campaign manager immediately afterwards.
George W. Bush dug underneath the 6th weed plant in the 9th row of his farm and brought up 3 bongs. One of them was purple, one was black, and one was super super small.
“It’s just as Dr. Biden said—when your husband got hard, all the blood from his brain traveled straight to his dick, killing him instantly.”
“What are you—” but before John could finish, Sherlock’s mouth crashed into his. Every bone in John’s body went limp, except for the one in between his legs. But then his brain caught up to his microscopic dick. “Wait, Sherlock!” he said, pushing Sherlock back. “I’m not… I’m not gay.”
At first, it was just the base of his dick that grew stiff as more and more blood rapidly pooled to his groin. Soon, however, John could see his schlong growing stiffer and stiffer, inch by inch by inch by inch by—
“You’re such a drama queen, Daddy,” giggled John. Sherlock’s mouth dropped, as if only to verify his point.
“They’re taking my money!?” cried John in outrage. “Damn those socialist commies! I’m going to sue them!”
“If that’s not all, take a look at what’s blowing up on Twitter now.” He handed an iPad made of pure gold to me, which was open on Mycroft’s Twitter page (which now had more followers than mine).
John pulled out and started to cry. “You’re mean!” he screamed and ran out of Sherlock’s room. He ran outside of Sherlock’s house not even caring that he wasn’t wearing anything and his dong was visible to everyone.
His strong hands quickly started unbuttoning John’s Brioni shirt. “Be careful with the suit jacket!” John said, but was quickly shut up by the pad of Sherlock’s thumb circling his nipple. “Hhhhhhhngh,” moaned John.
Sherlock nodded and got to work while John sat, slowing pulling his dick so all of it could rest on the bed. Seeing Sherlock so engrossed in his task, however, caused John to groan, feeling an erection of his own starting.
“Ugh...I’m not done...come back,” heaved John, as another wave of pleasure overtook his body and his micropenis began guzzling cum like a firehose putting out a burning blaze.
Sherlock laughed. “Unlike you, John, I have no reservations about performing this devious acts.” He stuck his tongue in John’s throat, as if to prove his point, which made taking off Sherlock’s clothes a very challenging task for John.
My name is Sherlock Holmes-Sanders and I’m running for the President of the United States. I am a man of the people. My biggest opponents are Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton. I have had the most unique contributors of any campaign in history, because people love me. Tomorrow is the first mixed-party debate in Portland, but first, today, I must make a rally in Los Angeles.
“That’s over 5 cups of sperm a second, through a tiny opening! Think about it, John. You try to run something that pressurized through a sink, of course the faucet’s gonna blow.”
“Fellow Americans,” said Mycroft, President of the United States, double chin quivering with each vowel. “Thank you for your trust and support—but, to be fair, the competition wasn’t very tough.”
The verdict fell deaf to Sherlock and John’s ears; at this point, Sherlock almost had John’s Burberry briefs off of him and was about to stick his fist in his ass.
“Actually, Senator Holmes-Sanders, I have a plan—” began O’Malley, but immediately stopped under the piercing look Sherlock shot her.
Sherlock tossed the whip and moved John’s dick out of the way, shoving two fingers to John’s pulse point.
On my canvas were the bodies of 27 men, all with tiny, tiny micropenises. Some of them were so small, they were literally just dots. In addition, all the men had Sherlock’s face.
“No, Sherlock. You’re always the dom. But today… You’re going to let Daddy take care of you,” John said, his 17-foot long dick swaying in the air. Because it was so long, the very end ran off the bed and onto the floor and out of the room.
Before Sherlock could cum again—he had gotten hard a second time thinking about Joe Biden—John’s weak, pathetic voice assaulted his ears, shriveling his penis instantly.
“I do,” replied Bill. He took a deep breath. “It all began when I was working an afternoon shift at my part-time job as a lap dancer.” There were some gasps from the jury at this revelation, but Bill paid them no mind. “I was giving a lap dance to Mister John Watson-Trump when, in response to my expert services, he started ejaculating. After he was finished for the third time, he gave me a briefcase full of money, and he and his husband left.
Sherlock sobbed and ran to grab his phone from where he’d left it on the desk, quickly pulling up Joe Biden’s number and hitting call.
“Sherlock...George W. Bush spent all the money we made selling weed on My Little Pony figurines. He said it was his weed originally, so it was his money. What are we going to do?” John started sobbing.
John heard the flashing sounds of cameras. Suddenly, a car skidded up to him and someone pulled him inside.
My name is John Watson-Trump and I’m running for president. I’m a proud republican and billionaire. I’ve been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction for almost all my life. If people who supported me knew about my secret, my life would be ruined. That’s why I visit a doctor every single day. Today is the day I fly over to the site of my next debate, Portland Oregon. I get into my 2,000 meters long private jet and begin to comb my penis. I grab all two centimeters with my right thumb. I moan in relief as I ejaculated 12 pints of sperm. The plane landed and I got off of it with my campaign manager, Corey, following me. I was greeted by a massive crowd of my supporters, all of them wearing my John Watson-Trump For President shirt.
Attached to the tweet was a blurry video, as if it had been taken from security footage, of…exactly what happened 10 minutes ago.
The next day, John and Sherlock stepped into Bush’s greenhouses. “The harvest this year has really been plentiful,” said Bush. Rows and rows of marijuana plants surrounded them on all sides, some so tall they were pressing against the glass ceiling.
“Hey guys chill,” said George W. Bush. “Get some weed and relax.” He threw some weed at them and gave them lighters. “Here, let me show you my bong collection. It’s what I do in my free time, besides painting dogs.”
John found himself turned on too. “Oh, yeah, baby, you’re gonna take it so hard. We’re gonna spend so many hours in 221B(DSM), my favorite sex dungeon. Yeah baby! Yeah!!” he reached out and started shoving his tongue down Sherlock’s throat, pressing kisses down his neck. He unbuttoned Sherlock’s shirt with great enthusiasm and bit his nipples.
There was only one person who I knew I could trust, and that person was George W. Bush. I drove my 1957 Ferrari (which is the most expensive car in the world) to his house. When I got there, I found George W. Bush painting a dog in his backyard.
Shit! John had forgotten that he didn’t clean the comb before brushing his hair. “It’s—it’s milk!” he sputtered, but his reply wasn’t heard over the laughter of the crowd.
“Sherlock, what does this mean?” asked John, who thought the formal thank you of his patronage was unnecessary but was touched by the gesture.
But John had another genius plan--for real, this time. He was already on the phone with his old friend, George W. Bush.
“Oh hell yeah baby,” said John. “It’s been such a long day in the office. I tried for 3 hours to compose the perfect Tweet but got so horny thinking about my secretary down the hall.”
Eren grabbed Levi’s hand and popped his long fingers into his mouth in celebration. Because he couldn’t speak, Levi said, “Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Any other Democratic candidates have anything to add?”
But there was no response from John. His head slumped awkwardly to the left, and his eyes seemed dull, almost lifeless.
But by the time Joe had finished his sentence, Sherlock and John had already left the building, ready to head back to the 221B(DSM) sex dungeon.
John nudged him really fucking hard in the shoulder. “Duuuude. They totally fucking were. Have you heard Brendon’s solo stuff? It’s all about Ryan. I mean think about it, it all makes sense! Brendon was drunk and made out with Ryan, but Ryan didn’t know he was drunk so he confessed his love to Brendon. Then Brendon was like, ‘Woah woah woah man no homo,’ and Ryan was like, ‘Bitch are you fucking kidding me,’ and then they broke up and now they’re sad and only write songs about each other,” John finished, shoving a Hot Pocket into his jeans.
“Now, all we have left is to read his will. ‘First, to my husband Sherlock Holmes-Sanders: I grant you infinite use of all our sex dungeons—though I know, of course, that they won’t be needed, for you’ll never find someone with a dick amazing as me.’”
Thanks to that comment, Sherlock suddenly had a great idea to guarantee his victory. He was going to meet John after the debate, and show him something that would surely... harden his platform.
“Thanks, Levi, honey,” said Eren, necking him. “Eren, stop! You’re embarrassing me in front of all these people…” whispered Levi. “I’m getting kind of horny. But...we have a debate to moderate, idiot.”
Molly Hooper-O’Malley signed her last fan autograph, and placed it in a growing pile of at least three letters. She was a newcomer, pretty late in the game, but she was confident in her environmental platform. Molly was not going to throw away her shot. She was going to her best out there.
for this, you have no idea,” Sherlock moaned. When he was finally done unwinding John’s dick, he reached for their favorite leather whip—only for John to immediately grab it out of his hands.
“Wait! A kiss for my dokidoki,” asked Izuku, very politely. Shouto smiled at the request of his lover, and gently pressed their lips together. He took Izuku’s hand in his as they walked out to enjoy the lunch Izuku had made them both.
Attached was a photo of my penis covered in cum next to a ruler reading 0.5cm. It was intended as a direct message for my doctor, but I accidentally sent the draft instead of the tweet about Sherlock!
John finished counting the last stack of $100 bills. He and Sherlock were in Bush’s living room, surrounded by briefcases full of money they made by selling Bush’s marijuana. “I think that’s it! We really did it, Sherlock! I can’t believe we sold $2 trillion of weed to Google employees while they were at Burning Man! I’m so happy!”
But Sherlock wasn’t listening—he was still too distraught over the loss of a massive co—his husband, his husband’s death.
“Oh yeah I remember now. I think. Ok. I’ll go get to work now. They don’t call me the world’s best, uh, well, I’ll go ahead and start.” Joe put a face mask on backwards and grabbed a scalpel. “You, uh, Shercock, was it? Go ahead and wait outside by the waiting room. I’ll call you in when I’m finished.”
Sherlock took out an old VHS and stuck it into their TV. All three of them got together and started watching the movie.
“Well, I was feeling really horny at work, because I kept on thinking about my secretary’s titties, and how great it would be to grab--”
“That? That looks like a nipple. I don’t think I can suck it… But we could try anal. I’m guessing that you don’t need a condom, not that any would fit.”
shouted the pixelated Sherlock, over and over again to the naked pixelated John, but also to the real John, who was watching the retweets slowly creep into the 3 millions. The video zoomed into John’s penis, and John thought that Twitter might have censored it, but it wasn’t visible anyway.
“Bill Clinton has suddenly developed a micropenis and he says it’s your fault. He’s saying when your dick exploded, you transferred your micropenis to him. Anyway, he’s suing you for $10 trillion. The court date is in a week.”
“100,000 people RSVP’d on Facebook, Senator Sherlock Holmes-Sanders,” he said. “But my assistant Castiel says that even more turned up inside!”
The Doctor reached for some equipment John had never seen before. “It’s a microscope lens for work at the cellular level,” explained Sherlock. The Doctor held it up to John’s crotch and scanned around.
Hello. You may know me as John Watson-Trump, proud Republican and billionaire. It’s been a long journey of self discovery for me but I’m finally ready to share my story. As many of you may know in the 2016 elections, I indeed had a micropenis. I am no longer ashamed to admit it. However, earlier today I lost my micropenis. It exploded when I ejaculated 5 gallons of semen after receiving a lap dance from Bill Clinton. The purpose of this fundraiser is to surgically get me a new penis. The target is $12 trillion because my Doctor has recommended me to the best surgeon who charges $1 trillion per inch, and after discussing it with my husband Sherlock Holmes-Sanders, we decided a 12 inch cock was the best for me. (Even if I would like 20 inches.) It is an important medical expense and the future of our country depends on it.
“Well, thank you again for your services,” said John, who still didn’t have any pants, extending a hand to the man’s. He looked him in the face for the first time. “Oh, hi Bill. I didn’t know you worked here!” John said, turning his handshake into a fist bump.
He looked at me as if I had said I was going to build a wall around America’s land borders. “There have been many crazed candidates in the history of this nation, Trump. But none of them have ever come close to this.” He motioned at, well, the entirety of me.
“Well, I’m going to lunch,” muttered the judge. “The court is dismissed. Mr. Watson-Trump, please be sure to pay the plaintiff the $10 trillion as requested after your husband is done fisting you.”
I sat down and picked up a tan color, beginning to draw a man. Art was therapeutic, this would help. I drew more and more men, painting my canvas with the bodies of at least 27 men. At one point, George W. Bush stopped painting just to look at my paintings.
Sherlock smiled. “And the whole wide world will be not be surprised that John Watson-Trump is on a lifetime supply of Viagra.” He followed John into the penthouse.
John and Sherlock walked into the courthouse together. Upon seeing their arrival, the judge, whose hair was half white and half red, let out a big sigh. “Do you have any respect for the legal system?” he bitingly spat at them, but it was obviously meant rhetorically because he immediately raised his voice to address the crowd. “Settle down everyone. Our defendant is finally here. We shall now begin the legal proceedings for ‘Clinton v. Watson-Trump: Micropenis.’ Are both parties ready?” He turned towards John.
“Yeah! It’s unbelievable, right! 19 inches, what do you have to be worried about!?” asked John rhetorically.
“John had sex with Bill Clinton in a strip club and spread a lot of his seed,” interrupted Sherlock.
Sherlock sensed John’s hesitation. “I know you’re worried about not being able to get it up,” he whispered, “but I do love a good challenge.”
I pressed delete but the damage was already done. I was losing followers by the minute. 6.9 million became 6.5 million, and pretty soon it was down to 4 million. People were posting screenshots of the tweet, the one from Mycroft Holmes-Clinton having the most retweets. My life was ruined.
Sherlock Holmes-Sanders straightened his tie, staring into the mirror of his hotel room. He turned to the right, and turned to the left. Yeah, his good side was the right. Sherlock wasn’t nervous. Nothing made him nervous, except for anti-trust funds—but even then, he was very good at converting that nervous energy into anger. But he felt none of that right now. He was going to win with his wits.
“Um, I think that it’s great that gay marriage is allowed now,” started O’Malley, “but what about the other oppressions queer people—”
Excited to show off his genius plan, John hurried back to Sherlock. “Look, I donated $1 million, so the progress bar has more green on it!” he said, handing his laptop to Sherlock.
Sherlock scoffed. “Oh please, John. I know exactly what you search in the middle of the night. ‘Hot guys naked big cock?’ How about ‘Viagra coupons?’”
Sherlock smirked. “Now, now, John, he’s not the one you want to be fucking. Not that you’re capable of fucking anything with that dick of yours…”
“I’m not allowed to do that dear,” said the man. Sensing John’s disappointment, he added, “but I’ll make sure you don’t need that to get excited tonight…” and doubled his pace of trusting.
“I believe, your honor, that violation of rules results in an automatic loss for the guilty party,” said Mycroft. He had no idea (there was nothing about sex in the courtroom in his textbooks), but he said it confidently, and usually that worked.
“Now, wait a second,” said John. “That was quite the tragic story, but I’m the real tragedy here. While Bill Clinton has 0.5cm, I have nothing. Please donate to my Gofundme at https colon slash slash Gofundme dot com slash John dash Watson dash Trump dash Monstercock dash support dash fund.”
Joe Biden didn’t respond and left the room, his trousers clinging tightly to his 77-year old ass. Sherlock, still aroused from before, immediately bust a nut at the sight.
“I love you and your sexy ass even if you think corporations aren’t people!” exclaimed John Watson-Trump. “We may disagree politically but our love is beyond that.”
“What Mycroft is saying means nothing at all,” interrupted Sherlock. “Did he specify any of his platform whatsoever?”
I lean down to grab my phone and the crusty comb falls off my crotch. I open up Twitter and begin to type out the tweet. I post it and feel triumphant. There’s no taking it back now. Sherlock will never see what’s coming!
, they said you were stable, they promised… I was sitting at your bedside, and your lung…  Well.  I’m not a superstitious man, John, but even a fool knows that twice is a coincidence and three times is a pattern.  So, I.  I stayed away.”
“You’re going to see Harry,” said Sherlock.  “Why?  You made it quite clear you have no interest in associating with her.  Unless…”  He paused, waiting as more clues came to light.  Shadows under John’s eyes: sleepless nights.  Red crescents on his left palm: constant stress, repeatedly curling his hand into a fist.  The empty glass beside his laptop, filmed with the dregs of scotch.  Two fingers: bracing himself.
There is a quality unique to dreams – a languid haze overlaying every detail and action, as sweet and unhurried as honey dripping down the comb.  John wants to reclaim that quality, so he takes his time, ignoring Sherlock’s panting pleas as he bobs his head.  Despite his whining demands, Sherlock keeps still, so John risks prying one hand off his hip to encircle the base of his cock. With spit and precome to smooth the way, John’s hand strokes to make up the lack, and his lazy pace soon has Sherlock begging.
John’s amazement as they stood on the banks of the Thames with Lestrade, Alex Woodbridge’s corpse lying at their feet.  John’s wondering grin, the kind that lit him from within, piling wrinkles at the sides of his mouth and under his
John is staring at him, eyes dark, lips parted.  Their gazes lock and John transforms the sound into a ragged cough, covering his mouth with his closed fist.  “Sorry, sorry.  I’ll just…”
John, who had leaned forward to inspect the stone, dropped his gaze to Rosie.  The baby had awakened silently and was reaching for the stone.  Her little arm flexed, palm outstretched, before she winced and took it back.
John’s fingers spasmed and he swore a second time.  He pressed his hand to his thigh and waited a moment.  When at last he could hold the keys without his hand shaking, he unlocked the door, nudged it open, and picked up the bag.
“Breast milk,” Sherlock supplies.  “If that comes as any surprise to her, she truly hasn’t got a brain.”
“If you see anything to do with this man,” Mycroft said, “or… if you feel unsafe in Mary Watson’s presence—”
“It’s no trouble,” says John.  Only a willfully ignorant man would ignore the true sentiment in those words:
“Yes.”  Sherlock checks the urge to shift from foot to foot.  Shoves his gloved hands into the pockets of his Belstaff, telling himself it’s because of the cold.  “It’s only fair.  I’m a significant part of her life and…”
As John took a moment to compose himself, the familiarity of his old bedroom settled over him like a comforting blanket.  He propped Rosie against his shoulder and reached for the wall, muscle memory guiding his hand to the light switch.  Light flooded the room.  Save for the baby cot, little had changed: his bed was made, his nightstand still stood at its side, and the curtains at the window were closed.  It was as if he had only been gone a day, not three months.
John glanced up and found Sherlock watching him with a sad, soft look.  He stood and swept around his chair, striding into the kitchen.  His teacup and saucer rattled together as he set them in the sink.
“I only ask because she’s clearly mute, and by my judgement, she hasn’t eaten in a few days,” said John.  “You must have known where she kept it.  You’re her brother, after all.”
Thwarted on all sides, Sherlock agrees to leave on the condition that he be allowed to see the body.  Lestrade leads them back to the scene, hastily cordoned off by police tape.  Forensics has taken all the evidence they need and cut Edmund Brown down from his branch.  His corpse lays on a gurney, already stiff with cold.  His skin is fishbelly-pale and his tongue protrudes from between his lips.
“I…”  Sherlock glanced at Maili, back at Eirene.  “I… found something.  Something that wasn’t here before.”
The figure in the Father Christmas costume stands before him.  Black shadows chased by torchlight dance across a wrinkled, wasted face and pool in the deep pits of his eyes.  It’s a mask, sickly and immobile in spite of the rotting turnip-grin, as lifelike as a scrap of burlap.  The Father Christmas’ form is swaddled in the ridiculous coat and boots, gathered close by shadows.  Sherlock’s vision tilts and blurs with every blink.  Difficult to tell if the figure before him is massive or small – a giant or an elf.
Sherlock closes his eyes and surrenders to the kiss.  To the gentle pressure of John’s lips on his, so familiar and still so exhilarating.  To the strength of his arms.  To the scent of him, masked by cologne – citrus and bergamot, and beneath that, a scent Sherlock knows so well, his mind simply translates it to
The thumping at the door stops.  Sherlock tries to open his mouth, to cry out for help.  The hinge of his jaw feels frozen.
His tone sent a shiver down John’s spine.  Hands shaking, he squeezed a generous dollop of lube onto his fingers.  Sherlock’s pleas and his own aching arousal spurred him on, and soon he was stretching Sherlock open with a finger, marveling at the crushing tightness, the heat.  He rubbed Sherlock’s inner thigh with his free hand and dipped down to kiss the hollowed stomach, the ridge of a hipbone, the tip of his cock.  Sherlock jumped at the last with such a cry that John worried he had gone too far, but Sherlock only fell back with a squeak of bedsprings and gasped, “More.”
Sherlock nods, not trusting his voice.  John slicks his fingers.  The first is slow, infinitely cautious, circling the ring of muscle before pressing inside.  Sherlock’s body clamps down, but John waits, stroking his hip.  “Relax, love.  You need to relax.”
Mary propped her elbow on the tabletop and rested her chin on the heel of her hand.  “He’s so… blind.  But if he somehow saw the truth, really
Boredom is terrible in its own right, but it has nothing on the black moods.  If boredom is rending, the black moods are suffocating.  Smothering.  A thick mist settling over him, congealing into a heavy, viscous blanket.  It steals through his pores, through mouth, nose, eyes, ears.  It worms into his brain with deadening black bile.  It clots every sense, rendering him deaf and dumb.  It changes the landscape of his vision into a gray waste.
of finality.  John shoves one hand under his pillow as the other smooths over his belly, drifting lower.  Anticipating.
tangling through the city, polluting every functioning screen with his dead, reptilian eyes, his automaton mouth - Sherlock had flown into the fray like a bolt of lightning, moving too fast, burning too brightly for John to grasp.
A search of said mother and child confirmed Sherlock’s suspicions – there was very little to be found on either one.  ‘Elizabeth Grant’ turned up old articles from 2010, but none of them went beyond a superficial description of the girl:
– the familiar figure stood near an enormous bay window, swarmed by a cluster of police.  John hastened toward him.
(Sherlock tries to start something in the cab, insinuating his fingers under the hem of John’s shirt, splaying his palms against warm skin as he tries to wind his way into John’s lap.  But John won’t have it – his hands encircle Sherlock’s wrists, pleading decorum,
John pulls him down, kisses him with a softness that makes Sherlock’s heart hurt.  It’s horridly unfair that John is the one always caring, always mending.  He has weathered so much pain and loss.
Between the two of them, they divest each other of shirts and trousers and threadbare sweatpants.  Sherlock hadn’t bothered with pants the day before, but he takes pleasure in hooking his thumbs over the band of John’s, tugging them down.  John’s cock is flushed and hard, and it twitches under Sherlock’s scrutiny.  Sherlock skims his fingers from root to tip, feather-light, and John inhales shakily.
As always, please let me know if you spot any mistakes or obvious Americanisms so I can correct them.  Thanks!
Sherlock’s heart thunders in his chest.  He remembers, suddenly, the first time Rosie said his name; how she couldn’t string the syllables together, how the cadence of
“The male presents a pebble to his lady love as part of courtship,” the narrator continues.  “If she accepts him, they will add the pebble to their nest, and the two are mated for life.”
Sherlock paces the room, restless, the residue of terror clinging like a clammy sweat.  He had thought he’d known terror when he saw John laden with Semtex, John kneeling with the muzzle of a gun pressed to the nape of his neck, John buried in a bonfire as the flames climbed high.  He had thought he had only one chink in his armor, one fatal weakness.
“Gosh.  And here I was going to ask if I could sleep in your room from now on.  But if my sordid past really bothers you, I’ll stay in mine.”  John swallows his words.  The offer had sounded much more flippant in his head.  “Um.  That is, if you want me to.”
“Mrs. Hudson, I helped put your late husband in the electric chair.  You won’t have a hint of judgement from
John groaned and kissed him, fevered and deep.  Sherlock clutched at him, winding long fingers through his hair.  John’s cock jerked in his trousers and he broke away to undo his flies.  Sherlock panted, each breath punching an echo out of him, “John, John,
On the far side of the room stood the Mazarin Chair.  The pale stone gleamed from its nest of vines in the splat.  Identical to its sibling at the shop in every aspect, save for—
The Yard packs off Piggy and Cotton Bud without a fuss.  Sherlock knows the routine – knows he is meant to go with them, give a statement – but he lingers, gravitating toward John.  Lestrade and his entourage turn the corner and vanish, voices fading in the chill air.  Sherlock crosses the space to John in three long strides and catches him up in a kiss, fierce and feverish and just shy of bruising.  John makes a small sound of surprise and returns the kiss with enthusiasm, hands winding around Sherlock’s neck, cold fingers twining through his hair.
The look John gave Sherlock was speculative.  Like Sherlock was an automaton masquerading as a man, and John had just seen through the skin to the cold metal beneath.
Lestrade rang off.  Sherlock stared at the blank screen of his mobile, fear and suspicion congealing in the pit of his stomach.
Irene Adler sauntered into the room, clad in nothing but heels and a blood-red slash of lipstick.  Her smile was as sharp as the honed edge of a blade.
Ms. Helens stiffens.  In his peripheral vision, Sherlock sees John tense, jaw clenching as if to bite back a rebuke.  Years’ worth of little deductions flood back to Sherlock like a wave of bile; John’s own family life was tainted by abuse, though he’s never been open about it.  Swallowing past the guilt, Sherlock stares intently at Ms. Helens, awaiting her answer.
John Watson is a very light sleeper.  So, when his dream-lover reaches down to cover one of his hands with theirs – a large hand, fingers long and pale, metacarpals stark beneath the skin – and a deep voice hitches out his name, he wakes with a bitten-off cry, shocked and shaking with his hand fisted around his hard cock.
The woman holding Sherlock raised her voice above the rest, pride honeying her words.  “Do you see his eyes?  Look, they are like shards of silver.  See how finely he is made?”
John smiled, let the expression fall away as the weight of weariness draped over him.  Being plainly exhausted was a better excuse than any other he could concoct.  “Not after this week, I don’t think.  Been a long one.  Probably I’ll just… pass out with the baby monitor for a pillow.”
And then:  John’s hand at his shoulder, the touch so light Sherlock might have mistaken it for the brush of the Belstaff.  His hand lingers, presses, and Sherlock can feel the imprint of his palm mold against the bump of his clavicle, perilously close to the nape of his neck.  Sherlock’s nerves spark like a wire stripped to the core.  He feels John’s fingers pressing through wool, through his silk shirt, down to hot skin.
Sherlock rolls his eyes so far back, he fancies he catches a glimpse of his own brain.  “For God’s sake, John, I’ve explained this a dozen times.  Surely you’ve grasped it by now.”
Sherlock wakes to the first filmy, dawning beams of morning light slanting through his bedroom window.  The black mood has fled, and everything has come back into focus.  As simple as turning the dial on his microscope.  Odd, how such a crushing weight can so swiftly dissipate.
Sherlock says nothing.  It occurs to him, a little absurdly, that he could ask John to marry him now.  He has no ring, no tender words, no notion of dates and times and the myriad details that go into marriage.
“I want to,” Sherlock says quickly.  He forges on before he can second-guess himself, let fear stifle the words.  “I want to be a part of Watson’s life.”
location.  He retrieved John’s Sig from the nightstand beside his bed.  For himself, Sherlock chose a fire iron – medieval, perhaps, but more dignified than a cast-iron skillet.
The Peckham Council Tower was less imposing in the light of day, though Sherlock wondered if that was a fair price to pay for illuminating the disrepair the building suffered.  Stripped of the cloak of night, the pitted gravel around the building was a choked mess of cigarette butts, beer cans, and bits of broken glass.  Plaster curled off the brickwork in patches like flakes of skin sloughing off a leper.
“We need,” John began, then fell silent.  Worked past the lump in his throat.  “We need to name her.”  One of many decisions they hadn’t reached in the month since Magnussen’s demise.  “I thought maybe Cather—”
He slept for two hours. Two most precious hours, when he was solely mine, his safety, his peace given into my hand, his body mine to guard and cherish. I marked his every dream as it crossed his face, the flicker of his eyes beneath closed eyelids, his involuntary movements and murmurs. When he sank deep, no longer dreaming, I dared to smooth his hair from his forehead with a brief, light touch, then to rest my hand - not on his person, for I would not go so far - but on the hem of his sheet as it lay across the arm of the couch.
‘Very well: when did you last use a gun, Holmes? A pocket pistol or a revolver? I shall ensure you practice with mine, and you can take that.’
This is not Poirot’s Orient Express, but the first one, so details will not be the same as in the Agatha Christie book.The menu is from 17th April, 1884.
The case is a genuine 2 year old cold case, solved by microscopic examination of tools Orrock left at the crime scene. He was re-tried for murder on 15.09.84 & hanged.
‘Holmes, we must read this: do look, my dear fellow! It is a new novel by Stevenson, whose ‘Treasure Island’ I so enjoyed. ‘The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’: surely the eponymous protagonists must be friends as we are. I do so love a stirring tale of adventure. You will not refuse to read it with me, will you?’
‘I do little enough,’ he repeated, ‘in face of such need one man can not do enough. But men together may, which is why I am glad you will be with us, old boy. I have the greatest faith in your powers, you know.’
He went to sit beside Havelock Ellis, who, at the end of Tchaikovsky’s lecture, brought him over and introduced him to me, and to Watson. He shook hands cordially with both of us, making some slight comments about the speaker, Tchaikovsky, who also arrived at that moment to join us, and on being told our names, addressed some very flattering comments to me. I was not, alas, as appreciative of the great man’s conversation as I should have been, for I had half an ear at least on Watson and his interlocutor.
‘There is bread, butter, ham and eggs, and I can make shift to cook them myself, of course. Most soldiers can make shift to cook, as well as to sew: I have told you, we must often fettle for ourselves in the army. And for the rest of our time here, we shall either tramp to some hostelry, or you will make do with my cooking. We have cheese, and the aforementioned ham, and a round of beef to cut at, with pickles and cresses and cucumbers. I brought wine, and beer we can have from the farm. We shall do very well on our own, never you fear.’
The Professor’s furniture would really all have been extremely expensive. Doyle is using the ‘Jeune Fille a l’Agneau as a coded reference to Worth’s real like theft of the Gainsborough portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire, but the painting by Greuze does in fact exist.
I gladly took the crumpled sheet from his hand (ladies' tea parties, forsooth!) as I crossed to the fire to refill my pipe from our Persian slipper. I rolled the unwelcome missive into a ball, and dropped it on the flames, using the poker to embed it deep in the coals and ensure it was well alight.
John twists his wrist and pulls Sherlock in until he swears he can feel his tip brush the back of John’s throat.  The thought startles a keening cry from him.  Still John sucks, bobbing his head, twisting his wrist, kneading Sherlock’s arse.  Sparks dance through Sherlock’s nerves, coalescing in a radiant burst low in his groin, heat and pressure building fast.
Huffing a laugh, John draws out almost as slowly as he pushed in.  Sherlock is about to voice a loud complaint when John thrusts in deep.  Sherlock voices
“God, they’re taking their time,” mutters John.  He frowns at the row of call buttons beside the locked door.  If he hadn’t rung the flat moments ago and got a hasty, unfamiliar “Just a mo’!” by way of reply, he might be tempted to ring again.
Rosie appears in the doorway moments later, looking wary.  Probably she suspects John wants her to try the braised beef again.  “Daddy?”
Sherlock spent the next hour or two preparing for the case.  He looked up Goldenrod, learned all he could about the building and expansion of the company.  There was a branch dedicated to acute myeloid leukemia, but no mention of the Grant family among its founders.  No mention because the money intended for it had been stolen.
Sherlock smothers a groan as Lestrade staggers toward them, Molly hanging off his arm like a kite in a dying breeze.  His bleary gaze moves between the two of them; Sherlock can practically hear the gears turning in his mind, sticky with the gin and tequila he and Molly have been quaffing for the past hour and a half.  “What’re you two up to, then?”
John had no Mind Palace.  His memory was less convoluted, more direct.  As far as memory tricks went, he needed a single folder, into which the sheaf of Sherlock’s medical report was tucked.
John’s mind registered these small differences like raindrops hitting a windowpane – a mere patter to the thunderclap of what he saw in Mary’s eyes.  In that flat, dead gaze, John saw the reptilian creature he had only ever chanced to glimpse.  A monster masquerading as human.
A soft sadness settles over John’s features, though they are no less fond than they were seconds ago.  “Seriously, Sherlock.  You’ll try?”
John gives Sherlock a wide berth for the rest of the party.  Orbiting the room, he smiles and chats amicably with anyone who strays into his path.  Sherlock watches, fingers moving mechanically over the strings.  Lestrade and Molly grin and glance at each other, faces pink, as they trade banal remarks with John to the tune of
Two hours pass in this fashion:  Sherlock finds a likely shop and fights through the crowds to claim his bounty.  He collects a set of walkie-talkies to go along with the reindeer for Rosie.  For Mrs. Hudson, he finds a fine bone China teapot decorated with violets and hibiscus flowers.  Nosey or not, the woman makes a bloody good cuppa.
,” said Sherlock, his eyes sweeping the room.  Everything was exactly as he remembered.  Moldering wallpaper, water-stained floorboards, spartan furniture.  Even the stool Sylvius had shot from was present, lying on its side like the bones of a felled creature.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock intones, using every ounce of his willpower to keep his voice steady.  “I’m not an invalid.”
Powerless to resist, Sherlock fell into step behind the fairy.  Now that he could see, he surveyed the area, fear giving way to wonder.  They were in a forest, but this was nothing like the wood he had wandered into with Redbeard.  Everything was brighter, as if the contrast had been turned up.  The surrounding trees curled into cunning shapes: here a throne, there the likeness of a man and woman in a tender embrace.  Birds flitted through the trees, jewel-tone feathers winking in the sunlight.  A damselfly flashed past, each iridescent wing the length of Sherlock’s arm.
Sherlock twists his lips and pokes his oyster with a wary finger, drawing back when the flesh quivers alarmingly.  He wipes his hand on his sweatpants.  “Disgusting.”
John hums in agreement and lifts his drink.  A muscle twitches in his jaw, a lingering tick of anger.  His hand moves under the table to find Sherlock’s, fingers threading together.
As his arms slowly encircled Mary’s waist, John remembered how his life had become livable again – how socializing became tolerable, sex became fun, the very air became breathable.  Mary had given him that.  He owed her.
“Ridiculous,” John chuckles, but he obliges, plying Sherlock’s lips with a deft swipe of his tongue and delving in deep.  Sherlock gasps and feels John’s hands on his waist, turning him, walking him backwards.  The edge of his bed meets the backs of his knees and they buckle, bringing him to a seat on the mattress.  John follows until he’s standing between Sherlock’s thighs.  His hands trail across the expanse of Sherlock’s chest, brushing the edges of his dressing gown.
This news gives me a start.  After my initial research of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes – the bulk done on John’s blog – the two had become inextricably interwoven with 221B Baker Street in my mind, as if there was no other place in the world they could exist.
John trails off and looks helplessly at Sherlock.  Sherlock hesitates, feeling as though he is standing on the edge of a precipice.  His hands are shaking, tea sloshing in its cup.  Sherlock thinks of John’s hands in the hospital in Cornwall, thinks of John’s hands questing over his body as he searched for the cords binding him.  Summoning all his courage, he sets his cup down on the nightstand beside his bed and reaches for John.
Thank you to all who have read and commented on "a vein of frost."  It's been immensely fun to write, and I hope you enjoyed reading it.  A special thanks to those who left comments and kudos; your feedback helped motivate me to complete the story.
“Yes, there…”  Sherlock glances at John, glimpses amused mortification beyond a thin veneer of composure.  “I thought there was a snake in my bed.”
“Yep.”  Rosie grins.  “I threw an ice ball at one of the boys’ heads and they ran away.  Now Sammy and me are best mates.”
“You almost died again,” John says.  “I wish—I wish you wouldn’t.  Die. I…”  He swallows, tries for a wry smile.  “I need you around, you great berk.”
“The killer caught him by surprise,” chimes in Anderson.  Sherlock sees the evidence, watches Edmund Brown’s murder play out in his mind’s eye.  A bruise on the top of his balding head suggests that he was struck from behind – a fierce, downward blow with a blunt instrument, dazing him long enough to get the rope around his neck.  Said rope had already been slung over the tree branch, so it was simply a matter of pulling on the trailing end to hang Brown.
John fumbled the keys out of his pocket, tilting the overstuffed bags of groceries against his chest.  He had only wanted to make one trip from the car, and his stubbornness was repaying him with swift vengeance.  The keys slipped from his fingers and his hand shot out, reflexes poised to catch them mid-tumble – but his arm seized with a grating of damaged nerves.  The keys struck the stoop with a muted clink.
And so, as they pass the river running alongside the Japanese Garden Island, Sherlock is completely unprepared.  A shadowy figure peels away from the trees skirting the riverbank, so massive and hulking he might have masqueraded as a tree himself, and strikes his right shoulder with a mighty swing.  Sherlock falls, the air rushing out of his chest as he hits the ground.  Catherine screams.
Now – pumped to bursting with painkillers and antibiotics and blood transfusions and tubes – John was grateful he’d been unconscious for the whole harrowing ordeal.  He remembered, with a sort of threadbare nausea, watching in stupefied horror as Sherlock plummeted from the rooftop of Bart’s Hospital to break on the pavement below.  Remembered fumbling for a pulse in that limp, still-warm wrist.
Desperation broke through Sherlock’s dazed mind as John shifted, reaching for his arm.  Without thinking – without letting himself think – Sherlock surged forward, seizing the knife by the blade with one hand.  His other hand dove into John’s pocket and closed around something thin, metallic.  Pain bloomed as he pulled the knife aside and wrenched the object from John’s pocket.  Jackknifing his body, Sherlock clamped his knees around John’s torso and threw his weight to the side.  The world spun in a haze of momentum and pain, and after a frantic scramble, Sherlock found himself kneeling above John.  He released the knife and jumped to his feet, bolting toward Moriarty.  He drew back his arm and swung with all his might.
They turn a bend and walk toward the Serpentine without a word between them. The waters are slate gray, reflecting the steely cold of the cloud-shrouded sky above.  Spring is a ways off yet, and skeletal tree branches stretch their fingers out to shadow dead grass and patches of slush.  They stop at a bench and John beckons Sherlock to sit beside him, hands clasped as they stare out across the water.  A bitter breeze whistles through the air and Sherlock crinkles his nose at an unexpected scent:  herbal, fresh.  Familiar. He looks at John, who shoves a hand into his trouser pocket with a sheepish grin.
A convulsion of something like pain crosses John’s face, gone before Sherlock can study it – and then John is clasping Sherlock’s face and pulling him close to kiss him, hard, on the mouth.  Sherlock falls back, dragging John onto the bed with him.  John breaks the kiss to shift his weight, his cock a hard line in his trousers.  Feeling it skirt his thigh, Sherlock grips John’s hips and they realign, finding a tempo and chasing it, rutting against each other almost fully-clothed.
“I doubt there will be any danger at the gala,” said Sherlock.  “If Lady Smallwood is attending, Mycroft will have ensured tight security.”
The Connie Prince game ended in a tie.  Sherlock won the game and lost the puppet, along with eleven other people in her building when it the bomb ripped it apart.  The old woman’s voice festered like a wound in Sherlock’s memory, refusing to be cut out and cauterized.
Sherlock froze.  Then he drew his hand away from Sarah’s grasp, stared into his open palm.  The skin was smooth and soft, without even a hint of pink to attest to the slashes he had borne.  He flexed his fingers, the delicate network of muscle and tendon and bone moving without so much as a nibble of pain.
It should be ridiculous.  Laughable.  They’re grown men, not a pair of blushing teenagers.  But Sherlock can’t muster a laugh; his chest is too tight, tight with dread.  John will step away, embarrassed.  John will laugh and play it off as Mrs. Hudson’s meddling.  John will find a way to proclaim that he isn’t gay.
his feet.  He struggles violently, but the killer is huge, gusting rank, warm breath through the mask into Sherlock’s face as he brings him eye to eye.
Sherlock stares at him, the words dying on his tongue.  He had feared rejection—he had feared pity—he hadn’t known to fear the warmth of John’s hands, the softness in his eyes as he offered everything Sherlock wants in a dark, quiet stairwell. But fear thrums through him, or something very like fear, for it makes his heart race and his body tremble as John’s hand drifts to the pale underside of his wrist and circles it in a strong grip.  His other hand finds Sherlock’s clavicle, his shoulder, and tugs him down.
‘I shall go immediately to Barts, and to my children; I assist Moore Agar today with a case, and after that I must meet Lestrade at the Yard: he has a corpse waiting for me. But I will wait up for you if you wish. I know you will tell me nothing now,’ and he smiled merrily at me, ‘that I may be the more surprised and astonished later, and your praise will mount from my lips to the very skies. Only have a care, Holmes, if I may not accompany you. Truly, Moran is dangerous.’
“Marks of weakness, marks of woe,” I murmured as we wended our way homeward, his purse empty, and my pockets lighter. “I mark in ev’ry face I meet. It is a sad city we live in Watson, is it not?”
‘As ye know, gentlemen, I’m a poor Catholic lad, Dublin born, and bred, unlike me rich friend Mally here. And since me father couldn’t provide for me, I had to do the best I could. An’ that was where me friend Martin came in . . .’
‘He was an historian at University. He comes from an old family, of which he is proud. But I will tell you more of Musgrave when I have told you the story: there is that in it which I cannot reveal without spoiling the dénouement of my tale, and I do not wish to do that. But I beg that when I tell you, you will refrain from any censure of the – other protagonist, in front of Musgrave. And I will tell you why that is later too, when we are more private together. Like many of these affairs, part can be drawn out for public consumption, and part must remain sub rosa.’
'Yes, you may help me to both: I know I must hand over the greater part of this fowl to you. What are you going to take, Mr. Phelps—curried fowl or eggs, or will you help yourself to the savoury before you?'
‘I believe not, he made some mention of a mutual acquaintance you have in common; I cannot recall the name just now. But here he comes, so he may explain himself to you to better effect than I can. Dr Watson, may I introduce to you Professor Moriarty of Kings College London, an admirer of your work in the free wards and among the poor. Professor Moriarty: Dr Watson.’
‘Mr Holmes, I do beg that you will forgive this intrusion so late in the afternoon. I am in need of advice, and your name was given to me as a man who might provide it by an old friend of Sir Robert’s. I am sure you do not know me, but I am . . .’
On this occasion, however, since he had complained, as he rarely did, of pain, I was ready with a thought to soothe it. April was drawing to a close with a tempestuous easterly, and I was not surprised his wounds hurt him. It was bitter chill, a dry, gnawing cold, with flurries of snow in the air.
I opened my own packet with as much care as he, ruffling the paper back to expose a dark grey shagreen case with silver fittings. I knew it was a pipe immediately, but the shape of the case gave me momentary pause for thought . . . ah, an extension, of course. I lifted the lid to reveal, nestled into its crimson velvet lining, a Barling briar pipe, the Dublin bowl silver-fitted like the case. A cloudy amber mouthpiece, a horn mouthpiece, and a fine, albatross-bone extension, all mounted with silver, completed the set. It was a work of art - whatever he said, the gift was princely. Then a thought occurred to me, and I raised the pipe to my nose, and sniffed. As I had thought, it smelt of my own tobacco. I looked a query at him.
Lestrade was silent for a few moments, then ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Yes, I believe we are. And, gentlemen, given what you have told me, I believe it was these criminals who may have arranged Dr Watson's abduction. It fits, as you said yourself, Mr Holmes. It fits.’
‘Yes, yes, that is right, that is comfortable and friendly. Go on,’ he said, ‘read a couple of sentences and then translate, if you would be so good. I love to hear how you switch between the languages with such ease. Your French well-spoken and accented is the most mellifluous of languages.’ I felt him sigh, a long, luxurious, relieved sigh, and relax a little more against me. ‘I do thank you: this is so very kind of you to indulge me, my dear Holmes.’
‘He approached you wishing to discuss Moran, which anyone who knows you well understands is no way into your favour. And I – I did not like his eye. It is cruel.’
‘No, she was a healthy child, robust and full of spirit. She could be a little self-willed, Mr Holmes, but no more so than any other girl, and if she had a fault it was that she was perhaps over-sensitive to slight or rejection. She was a well behaved child, for all her high spirits, fond of her family, and affectionate.’
He embraced me, pulling a face as he did so, for the aroma of the clothes I wore was by no means pleasant – and released me. I snapped my fingers for Sukey, and she came obediently to heel as he handed me the leash. I was at the door when he spoke again.
He sighed, rolled his eyes, and reached for my knife. ‘Here, give me that.’ He cut off the corner he had just bitten into, and handed me the rest. ‘You wanted it: now eat it.’
as a synonym for mariner. I wrote it down with some satisfaction, only to become aware that the Keeper of the library, an erudite fellow with whom I had already had some very pleasant conversation, was standing by my side with the key in his hand. I thanked him for his courtesy in waiting and allowing me to complete my work, explaining the difficulty I had been in.
I was busy. A slew of small cases: minor murders, erring husbands, distraught wives, occupied my May. Watson was busier. He was working earnestly – no man more earnestly - with other concerned physicians, to bring about the successful passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. No-one who walked the streets of London could doubt the shocking state of affairs there: children of both sexes bought and sold into prostitution. One could not pass a street corner in St Giles, or Whitechapel without being accosted by, or on behalf of, some wretched girl or boy with hopeless eyes and a painted smile. Those that we could, those of our little household, Watson and I protected: I daresay half the good doctor’s disposable income went on one charity or another. We found work, Mrs Hudson provided clothing: where we could, we took them out of that poverty which led them into danger. But we could do so little – and they were so young, it being no crime for a grown man to couple with some wretched thirteen year old too young to carry, and too unformed to bear a child. Watson and his peers hoped to raise that limit of illegality to sixteen at least. They felt that although they had little hope of stopping the abuse without some great and permanent change in the attitude of the Government towards the poor in general and girls in particular, the prospect, at least, of a penalty might prove a deterrent.
‘I will do better than that,’ I said, for I hated to see him this miserable, low in spirits, fevered, and beset by his night terrors. He needed diversion, and I would supply it whether he would or no. ‘I shall send old Musgrave a telegram, and propose that we should visit on the morrow: then I can tell you the tale in its setting, and with its protagonist to add verisimilitude to my narrative. Musgrave has a superb library, too. And an even more impressive cellar. Of wines, I mean, not indeed that cellar where the event took place.’
‘Meiklejohn!’ I put the piece of pasty aside untasted. ‘I know of him, and so do my informants. Most will have nothing to do with him: do not raise your hopes there. I thought he was in Dublin, or Scotland. My people know him as a scoundrel: they say better an honest rogue than a policeman corrupted.’
He cut himself off, but I knew what he was going to say: the indignities of his personal torments could not be concealed in so confined an apartment. I had seen the cruel colics that racked him, that sent him post-haste to the privy to moan and sweat and writhe, reappearing ashen and apologetic, wrung out. There was no delicacy about the ill that afflicted him. And if I was fastidious, he, the doctor, was even more so. He had warned me of the dangers of sharing living quarters with him, and he kept himself, and our home, scrupulously clean, though it cost him dearly in labour and laundry and carbolic soap.
I could not but laugh in return, taking the paper back from him, and patting his knee. 'A touch! A distinct touch! You are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law—and there lie the glory and the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations—that's the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor—such would be your respective roles! That's genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser men, our day will surely come.'
‘We must guard each other, for I am not safe with it either, Holmes,’ he said, one morning at breakfast, showing me the box and padlocks. His eyes were haunted. ‘I do not want to put temptation in your way, but I cannot wholly trust myself, and last night I was very sorely tempted by it, after I had given you your dose. I – I am so weary of the ache-ache-ache of this damn shoulder, and the knife of pain that stabs my thigh, that I would willingly exchange my vigilance for intoxication and oblivion.’ He sighed. ‘I feel so damn old, Holmes. I am but thirty, and there are days when I walk like a rheumatic cripple. Halt and maimed, halt and maimed: what hope is there for me? Will I never be well? Will I never be as I was?’
It seemed to me, as I roused, that I had been asleep for some time, for my eyes were sticky and the lids unwilling to open. I knew from the scent of the linen that I lay in my own bed at Baker Street, but had no recollection of how I had arrived there. I put out a questing hand which was immediately taken, and grasped in two warm ones that I knew at once for my Watson’s.
‘I must be away all day, my dear chap. Among other things, I have a complicated resection to undertake – a comminuted fracture that will not heal, so we must have the leg off. I do not think much of the patient’s chances, but I have promised Burns-Gibson that I will assist.’
'I have a little, a very little, money of my own. I will take nothing of James's, nothing. It shall endow a charity, and I will work for my living. If Henry and I are together, however poor, that is all I ask.'
‘Perhaps I am not so very far from him, degenerate that I am,’ I murmured. ‘Watson, I am tired of this case. My throat is sore and my head buzzing: I want to go home. We have found out all there is to find out in Bournemouth; I have been certain of how the poison was administered for some short while now, and if your idiot colleague Stevenson has not found it out by the time we have returned, I shall tell him tomorrow, and be shot of it. For I am sick and tired of everything.’
‘Sheets!’ Watson looked at me. ‘Beds! Mrs Hudson – I am so sorry, so very sorry that you – that poor young Janey should have been put to this. I cannot say how sorry I am. I – I do not – in fact I do not quite know what to say – the effrontery: to insult her, to insult you – in such a way! It is an outrage!
I looked away, wishing that I had never uttered those unfortunate words, but after rearranging my hair a little he went on, ‘I understand that you choose not to indulge in it, but I do not believe that it is by
'No, it is not Moran. Moriarty might think to aim at you because I tender your honour more dearly than my own. Do you think there is anything I would not do to save your reputation? The common bounce, the accusation of sodomy, yes, those were aimed at your honour, your standing in the world. He knows he can hold me at arm's length by threatening those: it is blackmail, of a sort. I would do anything, John, even give you up, to save your name from the smallest blot. But I tender your life more dearly still, John, and I believe it is now your life at which he aims.'
'I should like to go to the baths; we have not been this age,' he said, suddenly, after a silence. He was drowsing where he sat, and I was about to urge him to go up to his room and lie on his bed, that I might treat the leg for him until he dozed off, when a little commotion downstairs alerted us to the imminent arrival of a visitor. We had to separate then, lest we be surprised in an unseemly deshabille, his trouser leg rolled up over his knee, my shirtsleeves rolled up, my hands slick with the unguent I habitually used for his muscle spasms, and both of us with our collars loosened. As it was, we were only just in time to exchange the appearance of indecency (which would have been false) for apparent decency (which was not entirely true) when we heard Mrs Hudson's voice raised - most unusually raised for her - on the stair.
'I thank you for cherishing me,’ he said. 'Where we two are together, there is neither man nor woman, Holmes. We are equals, in this as in all else. Sometimes I will lead, and sometimes you. I am your Captain and your companion soldier both - and you are my Commander as well as my dearest care. There is no shame when we both submit ourselves to each other.’
When I met him I was not surprised that he had been, as Watson said, the butt and sport of cruel schoolboy humour: he was a thin, delicate, nervous young man, and must have been a thin, delicate, nervous young boy. For such a twelve year old to work with great lads two and three years older than he is good for neither party, for the older boys tend to deprecate the academic pretensions of the younger in ways that are both physical and painful, and in a school where the morals are lax - and where, in our public schools, are they not lax? - the younger lads are also often subjected to more private and more serious forms of abuse at their elders' hands: looking at Phelps, I did not doubt that he would have so suffered.
He criticised everything. Everything. My stance was wrong – and he used his own feet to nudge mine into a better position. He ran indoors to beg Mr Hudson for chalk, and then made me place my feet inside the chalk marks. I was in the habit of dropping my shoulder before I fired – and he moved close behind me to change the angle of my arm, placing his arm under mine. ‘Like that, Holmes. Stiffen your wrist a little, you are too loose and easy for accuracy.’
The Count of Monte Cristo: Dumas’ masterpiece. A plot twist in the story becomes a plot twist in SFISYF later on. Watson quotes Samuel Johnson ‘the Great Lexicographer’ on John Donne: the metaphysical poets were deeply unpopular at this point.
Douglas himself, after his acquittal on the grounds of self-defence, I had warned that he might find worse dangers to come than the rigours of the English law, or even than the violence of his enemies from America; telling him that I saw trouble before him, and that he had better be on his guard. I wrote to his wife too, urging her to get him out of England at any cost, for there were forces here more dangerous than any he had escaped. He put me off with slight words: he could look after himself, all would be well. She did not reply to me at all.
‘Holmes, you are truly vile when you are ill: never was a man less patient than you. Retire to your bed, for heaven’s sake, and I shall ask the good woman of this house to bring you a toddy and a bowl of soup.’
‘But will it be acted upon? Mycroft - ’ I placed my hand cautiously on his arm - we were not wont to touch each other, but I wished to comfort him – and he patted my hand with an uncertain air. ‘Surely it will be exceptionally hard to obtain a conviction? Men will not, will surely not destroy each other when they are bound in affection: so who is to know what is done behind closed doors?’
“Audenaz Sydney” and “Charles Wolitz”, both supposed to be London-born, to determine whether they were in fact, as English by birth as they claimed to be, despite their names. For the most part I was working from Paris of course, dealing with the bureaucracies of three countries, and when not in Paris, I was travelling the dusty roads from the capital to Metz and the surrounding area. But it was at a place called Lyons – Lyons-la-Forêt, a little village in Normandy – where I had finally given up on making my laborious and unsteady way back to Le Havre and the boat to England, that my dear Watson found me, in a state, as he said, of the blackest depression.
He leaned over and twitched the paper out of my hand. ‘You strike an outraged attitude very effectively. No, you are not. You are ashamed that I have shocked you and piqued that I have turned your own methods of observation upon you, that is all. I simply see that you are shy with women, and I am sorry for it, and for its cause. And with regard to the case, you are such a pure-minded and innocent fellow that you do not like any talk that you consider gross. But it is no more gross when it is of a woman, than matters pertaining to a man’s desires and needs, Holmes, and if that poor young girl had been better cared for and educated – again, as our friend Carpenter said, we do our women no favours, treating them like delicate plants – perhaps the marital relationship would not have been a horror to her. Although Durham is a villain, and a fiend, and I would knock him down with pleasure for his unkindness and lack of sensitivity if I saw him in the street. I would never treat a woman so, not for anything. I cannot bear to think of what she must have suffered under his hands, the selfish brute.’
‘But I am sure that you can solve this little issue so simply, without even leaving your chair,’ he told me. ‘Lestrade will bring the evidence to you, and if you look at it for him, then that is all I will ask. What do you think of the honey?’
'I took a cab: was fortunate to find one so close to the hospital at that time in the morning. No, not in the least. In fact - '
'I had not thought of that. No, I had not. But whatever he tried, I would still be innocent, Holmes, and you would not see me hang. As I said, I have faith in you. But it will not come to that: I shall be careful, more careful than I have been so far, even. Do not be afraid, we will win this war against our enemies.'
‘Jack Saul,’ I said to that figure, thrusting four half-crowns into the paw outstretched to me. ‘Thank you, boy, and do not spend it on gin: it is for bread, do you hear me, and a pie or two. Jack Saul, what the devil is all this, and where is Dr Watson? And how do you come to be embroiled in our affairs?’
Our visitor smiled gratefully at him, and I suppressed an completely irrational flare of jealousy. He had such an easy, gentle way with women that I felt myself becoming increasingly solemn and reserved almost in reaction. My understanding of the fair sex in all its motivations and methods was not deficient, but I could not be comfortable with women. Due chivalry and courtesy -  those I could summon at will: comfort in their presence and true ease of manner failed me and, I feared, ever would.
But the weather betrayed us, and was cruel, and for many days after that, he could not leave the house. I had, as I said, no more cases, it was too foul without doors even for me, and my mind began to tear itself to pieces for want of active employment. In such a mood, I could neither speak nor rouse myself to action, but only lie supine on the sofa, while my morphia wove its insidious spell. Even so, I was careful to take only enough to dull my mental pain. He may have suspected me, but he did not know, since I took pains to avoid him seeing my eyes, which would have betrayed my state to a medical man. And so we wore away a weary week together, fit neither for company nor for solitude.
First of all, I’d like to thank all of you who have encouraged me with kudos and kind words over the last year: your support has been most welcome. Every notification has meant so much to me.
‘And it was such a death from such a cause. Why, in God’s name, must man suffer from man’s inhumanity? Why must it be so? And why, why, when he does must these vultures of the press, these carrion crows descend to pick over the barely buried flesh? Stead, again, and William O’Brien, and Labouchère – they are all there, making political capital out of the death of a wretched, nearly destitute, young law writer with a child in the workhouse – at least Mrs Butler will make interest for the child, since she considers it within her purview – and all twisting and turning his death to make political capital in their own cause. I cannot bear it.’
‘Forgive me, Mr Holmes,’ replied Lestrade, ‘but I have just this moment managed to persuade my colleague here, Dr Stevenson, to call upon you . . .’
‘Bear as little of your weight on that left ankle as you may, Holmes. It is a matter of thirty steps or so to the cabs, and then we shall not need to walk to the hotel. I have taken the precaution of engaging two ground floor rooms, so you will not have to manage stairs.’
‘Do not forget to ask Jack about beekeepers,’ I reminded him, as he left the room. ‘I should dearly like to see the economy of the hive at work.’
‘So he believed that he had been practised on, and married to a mad girl, without his knowledge? And did you believe so?’ Watson leaned forward, his eyes intent. ‘Was that your understanding of the case?’
We must have slept then. I woke many hours later with a start, grey dawn in the sky spilling cold through the half-drawn curtains. Watson and I were covered snugly with the blue woollen afghan, which we had certainly not drawn over us ourselves as we lay there, and from the look of the fire, banked and purring to itself in the grate, it had been made up by a careful hand since we had slept. I roused him, and we stumbled, sleepy and aching with long lying in our cramped position, to our beds. But before we went our separate ways, Watson folded and smoothed the afghan, and pointed at the fire. ‘Small kindnesses,’ he said, softly. ‘Do you not think so, Holmes?’
‘There. I trust you,’ I told him. ‘I trust you. And now,’ and I released myself for he stood almost as if dazed, made no move to leave me, and I could not bear it any longer, ‘now that we are agreed we are the best of friends again, did you not have a journey to go?’
He was all beautiful as he sat there, unselfconscious in his kindness and strength, the gentle heart of him, and the steel edge. He had stepped into my life, a fragile exhausted wraith of a man, broken – still broken, for his wounds were not of a day’s healing – but strong. He was tender and compassionate, but stern to command. He had taken my citadelled heart by storm, and it had fallen to him without resistance. I loved him. I loved him, I who had never cared for any man save once, and that with only a shadow of what I felt for my Watson. I loved him from that first case we shared together, loved with all that was in me, at once, completely. I loved him so very dearly, and my heart was sore.
‘We do very well here, don’t you find, Holmes?’ he asked me one afternoon. We sat engaged in our separate activities, I in performing Marsh’s test for arsenic on a specimen of stomach tissue from a domestic murder victim, and he in conning over his account book. ‘I cannot think how Mrs Hudson manages to feed us as she does for the amount we pay her. Why, we had fowl last week, and again this. And a surprising quantity of fruit.’
I had just finished reading Mycroft’s letter when Watson arrived home, bounding up the stairs and calling for me.
The diminishing prospect of war had eased Watson’s nerves a little, and after a course of Turkish baths, some interesting cases, and some attention on my part to feeding him a generous diet of music and light reading, the nightmares were retreating, and his health improving again. On several occasions when the dreams had been particularly bad I had rolled myself in an eiderdown and shared his bed, lying back to back with him for the comfort, and the solidity of another human body to reassure him that he was not alone. If I had had to quell my unruly phallus with a little extra cocaine – I discovered that although its excitatory function made my fantasies deliriously sensual, the physical effects rendered achieving a state in which I might have fulfilled them impossible – I considered it a small price to pay for his sleep, and the terrifying pleasure of being able to observe him sleeping. If his dreams were strange, I am sure mine were stranger, but I never gave them voice.
‘Keep walking, Doctor, this is no place to dawdle around: not unless you wish to be relieved of your watch at knife-point.’
She wept, then, and dear Watson drew his chair next to her, and spoke soothingly, telling her how she and her daughter could help and care for their young friend, how with time, and love and patience she might come to her senses again, and that she should call upon us if there were ever anything she wished to bring to our attention. ‘Do not hesitate,’ he said, ‘for Holmes here will be happy to do anything he can for you.’
‘Fleischl! That poor, wretched fellow is injecting himself four and five times a day: he took it to stop the torment of pain he was in, and now he is doubly in pain, from want of the drug, and from that accursed amputation site. There is nothing worse than nerve pain; it is an unending torture: God pity the poor man, for life and his body will not do so. Thank God, Holmes - ’ I felt him shiver. ‘Thank God you never came to that, to take it to that degree. I am glad I wrote, questioning, after our last experience, that we might be advised of its dangers now, before too long had passed. Although I much censure Freud: he should have been swifter to retract his claims that it is a harmless panacea, thus might much evil have been averted. And yet - oh, I am much to blame for this, so much to blame. I thought I was helping you – I, a doctor, sworn to do no harm. I thought it a simple herb, like to our valerian and chamomilla, and the dill that we give to infants to relieve their colics. I thought to give you a little relief from the darkness, and see, I have brought it down upon you tenfold. Forgive me, my dear friend. Forgive me the wrong I have done to you.’
‘That is exactly why we must counter it, and not allow such practices to go unpunished. Leave me for a little, Holmes, and speak to our good Lestrade. And just pass this cloth over your face, and the comb through your hair: you must take care of yourself too, or we shall have you on the sick list before long.’ He handed me the lavender-steeped cloth, unfolding and refolding it to a fresh surface and I wiped it over my face. ‘There, that is better. We must both shave today: although I am in worse case than you. Go into the drawing room now, and leave the door open.’
I ventured to put my arms around him as he stood close to me. I was shy of doing so, but he came willingly into my embrace, and rested there, smiling so warmly, so tenderly, that I – was, I am very much afraid to admit, that I might almost have been about to – it seemed as if it would have been the most natural thing in our joy – my joy at the lifting of my spirits after so many days of depression, his more generous happiness at my joy, to bend a little further . . . to press my lips to his . . . his eyes were so kind: surely, surely he would not reject me out of hand . . .
We stripped and changed, moving around each other with care in the confined space. He washed meticulously all over, as he always did, calling the steward for fresh hot water, and then again for more for me. At length we were in our nightshirts. It was strange, but having to be so close to him, I felt curiously shy, and could not at all look him in the eye. We had shared a room before, but never one so small: his presence, his scent, he himself – filled the room. I wanted – I did not know what I wanted, to kiss and cling, be fond and familiar or to share myself with him, let gentleness turn to lust. Either would have seemed more natural than the brief, brotherly embrace he gave me, before I climbed the ladder and slid myself between smooth, lavender-scented sheets. And long after he was asleep, I lay awake, counting his quiet breaths, listening to them deepen and rumble into a snore until I too succumbed to their rhythm and drifted into dreams.
She tapped again. ‘Mr Holmes, may I come in? I think you would be best advised to see him, Sir. This is the second time he has come round asking for you. I expect it is because you have not replied to the seven messages he sent you.’
‘Mr Holmes, Dr Agar assures me that he will not be in a brain fever: he told me so yesterday. He just requires quiet and good tending for a few days, and that is what we are providing. You had better come out, Sir, because I am sending the Inspector up for you to talk to. I can very well sit with Dr Watson for a few minutes, and if he should wake, I shall call you directly. And the Inspector looks as if he could do with a bite of breakfast, so I am sending Janey with coffee and eggs and bacon for both of you. Now come out, if you please, Sir, and be sensible.’
Above him, John is trying to keep quiet, but his reticence only encourages Sherlock to wring out every stifled gasp and whimper and moan.  He reaches with his free hand to fondle John’s bollocks as he tightens and speeds his strokes.  He draws back, licks spit-slick lips, and looks his fill.  John is slumped in his chair, head thrown back, lower lip caught between his teeth.  His face is scarlet from the muggy heat of the fireplace and the fire they’ve kindled between them.
Sherlock looks around the deserted expanse of Portsmouth Road.  Trees crowd close, the morning sunlight slanting skeletal shadows across the asphalt.  The air is crisp and fresh, the rising birdsong oblivious to Sherlock’s distress. “Where are you?”
“Toby!” Sherlock cried, and raced up the stairs.  He stopped at a level with the dog and cupped its face in his hands.  Toby huffed as Sherlock massaged his floppy jowls.  “Who’s a good boy?”
“Ash,” Sherlock says, or tries to say.  The word emerges a croak.  His throat feels like it’s been rubbed raw with sandpaper.  “The ash.  I’ve…”  He can’t speak anymore – he tries to swallow spit, gags.  Feels the need to vomit again rising.  “I’ve solved it.”
All of these details took a backseat in Sherlock’s mind.  A deduction rose past the others, flying above them like a war banner.  The memory of Eirene kissing his brow had been long since obliterated, but she had left more than the ability to see the world of Faerie – she had given him a second sight.  An instinct for detecting the Fae.
That sense of disquiet prompted Sherlock to take McFarlane’s case. Without giving himself time to question it – time to doubt the sentiment worming through the logic, the data he has only just started to trust – Sherlock purchased two train tickets to Inverness.
He hummed, drumming his fingers on the windowsill, remembering the feeling of sticky, clotting warmth on his palms.  Under his fingernails.  A smile stretched his mouth.
“Come on, up you get,” says John.  Bending forward, he winds one arm under Sherlock’s and around his shoulders, helping him stand.  Sherlock has little choice but to shuffle along, down the corridor and into the bathroom.  The sound of running water does little to sooth his nerves.  “Think you can manage your, er, clothes?  With your hands?”
“Look,” he grits out, “I know you’ve had a bad day, but so have I.  I’d like to be alone right now.”  A patent lie, but Sherlock is the last person John wants to see right now, so it rather drives home the point.
When Mrs. Hudson was finished, she stopped before them, cheeks flushed and eyes bright.  “Oh, Sherlock,” she wobbled, “I am afraid for you, dear.  I know I always say I’m not your housekeeper – I’m
John looked momentarily crestfallen.  He scratched his brow, sighing.  “Don’t see why you have to be so…”
The suggestion that Sherlock would seek the needle makes needles prick behind his eyes.  Blinking, he shakes his head again.  He hasn’t touched morphine or cocaine for years – not since before John and Rosie left the house in Chiswick and moved to Baker Street.  John had made it clear in no uncertain terms what would happen if he found Sherlock high or with drugs in his possession.  Even if Sherlock hadn’t been determined to protect Rosie, he would have known better than to test John’s resolve.
“You won’t get it waving those wild theories about,” Donovan chided.  “Just because you’re trying to impress—”
“What you said, when… when Lucy…”  Even now, the memory stings.  Sherlock presses onward.  “About me. You said I’d always cared, but I… I never let others see.  I might… try to rectify that.”  He waves vaguely.  “Ridiculous, but.  There it is.”
Only one person - a timid, mousy woman named Molly - tried to befriend him.  Small and mumbling, perpetually struggling to force out an invitation to coffee, she was more annoying than anything else.  Even more annoying was that something about her niggled at Sherlock, persistent but always out of reach.  Like a gnat he couldn’t swat.  She reminded him of someone, he was sure, but no matter how much he searched through his Mind Palace, he could never make the connection.  It was infuriating.  Well, no matter.  If he made enough snide remarks, he was certain she would leave him alone eventually.
“Mr. Garrideb is alive, too,” said Mrs. Hudson.  “Missing a few fingers, but like my Frank always said, nobody needs
Though he does not say it, Sherlock feels the same.  He brushes his thumb over the bandage on John's hand, trusting that will convey his thoughts.  They continue down the street until they are swallowed by the cool mists of Inverness.
.  Even the dull, vanilla sex they use as a standby when John is knackered or Sherlock can’t quite get out of his own head has its charms.
More hands, pushing John onto his side and dragging his left arm over his head.  The air was cool against his bare skin.  A chilling swipe, the bite of a needle.  Blessed numbness.  The fractals dancing behind John’s closed eyes gave way to blotting darkness.
“I shouldn’t have left you on your own,” John says through the slim gap.  “I think we’d better get you to bed.  D’you mind if I…?”
Alexander’s reaction was so sudden that it caught Sherlock off-guard.  The man flinched as if slapped, and Sherlock was reminded of his crooked gait as he ascended the stairs.  In a hasty, ungainly movement, he was at the client’s side.
Rosie’s interest in the snake evaporates and she nods, tossing Sherlock a knowing look and racing back out the door.
The door flew open and Sherlock was leaning awkwardly on a crutch in front of him, eyes wide, lips parted on an indrawn breath.  John took a step back and the pain spidered through his side.  His left leg crumpled and he fell, but Sherlock was there, leaning heavily on his crutch and seizing John under the elbow and hauling him upright.  John braced against the wall, panting and sweating.  Sherlock’s hand shook on his elbow.  After several moments, he found his footing and looked up.
Sherlock tenses as John moves his head, mashing his temple against a plush fold in the Belstaff.  “’Til the cab gets here,” he says, sleep-slurred.
A clamor of voices filled his ears and drowned out the first shout.  Beyond that, a beeping and whirring and racket of voices muffled his senses in a fog.  He summoned all his strength to throw the hands off of him, but all he managed was a weary wriggle.  The hands held firm.
“Really!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed.  “Well then, you’ll answer your mobile phone the next time John rings you.  He only tried about a hundred times when little Rosie was born, so you can see why I wondered.”
A sign comes into view and, relieved, Sherlock bolts toward it.  He narrowly avoids knocking a pair of girls flat on their faces, winds around a throng of boys, and dives through a doorway.  Inside, a young, wire-thin woman is sitting at a desk, jotting something down on a notepad.  The name plate in front of her pronounces:
Sherlock thought of the mazikeen up in 221B, of his flat, vacant eyes.  He dismissed the idea immediately. If Hope was suicidal, he wouldn’t waste time making other people kill themselves.
Sherlock turns, entwines his fingers with John’s.  Follows John through the sitting room, down the corridor, into Sherlock’s bedroom.  The door clicks shut behind them.  John looks at him, and
They needn’t have bothered.  After over an hour of suffering public transport to Bray – John having refused to take a cab – Sherlock took one step into the quaint brick home, stared for less than a second, then whirled around and stalked back out.  He narrowly avoided colliding with John, who managed to exchange just enough pleasantries and spin the right excuses to avoid having tea with a pair of scandalous seniors.
Su Lin had been making it that night, before Zhi Zhu arrived.  When the bullets flew, obliterating the pots, the tabletop had been sluiced with tea.  Sticky and sweet in the creases of Sherlock’s bleeding palms.
Sherlock looks almost affronted, as if John’s concession wounds his standing as a known terror.  “I play the violin at night.”
John emerges from the kitchen with his medical kit and an ice pack in hand.  “Right.  Let me take a look at your head.”
The other end of the line was silent; even the perpetual hum of city life seemed to dwindle.  Then: “You can’t know what it’s like.”
John draws back with a grimace.  “That… should not be remotely as sexy as you make it sound, you know.”
Later, when his drug-induced slumber had ebbed for a spell, John asked a nurse for his chart.  The nurse hesitated, eyes darting toward the door to the bustling hallway beyond, and John mustered a smile that had charmed many women and a few men three continents over.
Sherlock and the big man were standing on the curb when John caught up.  The consulting detective had one hand outstretched for a cab.
Sherlock turns his head, finds Rosie standing in the doorway leading to the stairwell.  He cocks his head and she mimics the motion, birdlike, blue eyes inquisitive.
John gave Greg a hard stare, impatient for him to get to the point but unwilling to reveal his hand.  The DI sighed and rubbed the back of his neck.  “I’ve seen him looking at Rosie, and he… he gets this look…”
“That’s funny,” said John.  “You’re funny, aren’t you?  You’re not exactly qualified to lecture me on addiction.”
A moment of silence – a moment of wondering if he had slipped up again – and then John laughed.  “Ta, but no. I’ll sort out the mess I know.”
They lingered in the foyer for a moment, leaning against the wall and sniggering like mischievous schoolboys.  John’s laugh was as weathered and threadbare as a careworn blanket, and high-pitched in a way that should have been maddening but wasn’t.  As Sherlock tipped into laughter after him, he found he liked the two sounds together – threadbare and low rumbling. A strangely agreeable harmony.
“Har har,” Lestrade drawls, slurring a little.  “Don’t be a tit.  Only got the call ‘cause of the other case.”
“I was about six, then.  Peter’s illness started maybe a year later – when he was getting ready to go to uni.  He started having dreams that people were coming into his room at night, putting masks on his face.”  Lowering her gaze, she shakes her head to uproot the nightmare before it can haunt her, too.  “He’d wanted to get away from Father for years.  Mum was gone, and Catherine… she was just like Father.  I don’t know if she was born that way, or if he twisted her into his likeness.”
On a cool, tepid-gray morning in February, Sherlock wakes to the fresh scent of herbs.  Eyes shut, he drags in a breath, savoring the cozy, slightly fusty aroma and all the mental images tethered to it – steam unfurling from an RAMC mug; rain-stippled windows and slate skies beyond the glass; the scrape of damp wool on his nape as he turns up his collar against autumn sleet.  It is the scent of comfort, of warmth, and Sherlock burrows in, waiting for the fog of sleep to reclaim him.
Anderson caught on, far too late, and mumbled a vague non-excuse to cover his retreat.  Donovan was left standing in the alcove.  She darted a glance past Harry, as if contemplating flight.  Then she set her jaw and looked Harry in the eye.
The children who were taken – one-hundred gone, ninety-nine restored – would never be quite the same.  Though none of them knew it, all were touched by an ethereal hand.  All grew and developed qualities that could only be described as
Standing in the center of the room, John turns from his study of the mirror and offers a tentative smile.  Clad in dark trousers and a button-up in royal blue with his hair swept into an artful curve, he cuts a sleek figure.  All he’s missing is his shoes; there’s something oddly intimate about seeing his sock-clad feet, toes curling against the carpet.  Sherlock drags his focus back to John’s face.  Tries to ignore the smooth, jewel-tone sheen of the shirt.
She waves off the two crucial aspects of a marriage proposal like gnats. “Oh, he’ll love whatever you do. He’s in… inflatulated with you!”
Days ago, Sherlock would have scoffed at the notion.  Now, remembering John’s vacant stare, the point of the blade digging into his throat…
They spill through the doorway and into the open air.  Firefighters swarm them, drag them away from the blaze.
The news is not a punching blow nor the bite of a bullet.  It is a knife, sliding into the tender places between ribs in slow increments.  An anticipated attack.  John can’t even find it in himself to be mad, not really.  Perhaps, after watching him fall and watching him bleed out on the operating table, John has become numb.
Ms. Helens nods.  “Yes.  I already gave my statement to the Detective Inspector, but he insisted I see you, too.”
“Right.  John and I are going home.”  Sherlock smolders at John – really, it’s the only verb Greg can fit to the look – and John licks his lips.  “We have better ways to spend our time.”
John on a date with Elise.  John having dinner with her, eyes bright and smile wide as he offers her a bite from his fork and suggests a glass of wine.  John
After all is said and done, though – after Sherlock informs Lestrade about the counterfeiters, he and John spend an interminable, awkward cab ride back to Baker Street, and hobble on numb legs up the stairs to 221B – they need a fair bit more than blankets to chase away the cold.  And the stink of the Thames.
Four years after Mary dies, Sherlock lies in his bed, blinking blearily as John knocks at the door yet again.  When it opens, John is preceded by a tiny, feral blonde girl who races across the room and launches herself onto Sherlock’s bed.
“Rosie’s at Molly’s for the night, so you’ve got the place to yourself.  You can play beautifully or terribly to your heart’s content.”
police,” said Sherlock.  Alexander’s eyes widened a fraction, and Sherlock, delighted, pushed his advantage.  “Your accent is native to London, true, but it has the broader inflections of years in America.  Your accent is hardly noticeable.  Dropping your t’s, dragging your u’s,
“Can’t believe the killer was able to do this so quickly,” Lestrade mutters.  “Forensics places time of death early this morning, long before the shopping center opened.  Couldn’t’ve been more than twelve hours after murdering Brown.”
The pen stills, nib buried in a snarl of black.  The band around Sherlock’s heart tightens further. Threatens to splinter him.  “You don’t know that.”
He reached back into his briefcase and withdrew a second sheaf of papers.  Without looking in John’s direction, he raised the sheaf in offering.  John rolled his eyes, strode forward, and took it.  He scanned the first page, puzzlement fading as understanding dawned.
child,” said the first.  “Humans age quickly, do they not?  He will be grown in a blink and gone in another.  Best to enjoy him while I can.”
“Do you love me?” asks Rosie.  The question snags at Sherlock’s heart like a hook, at once tender and sharp.  He isn’t Rosie’s father but an outsider, a freak transplanted into her life in place of a mother.
Sherlock stares down at the pale expanse of his own skin, the knob of bone and mounds of muscle tucked beneath.  It’s his shoulder.  It’s only his (
John rounded on him, his accusing glare half-masked by a sarcastic smile.  “That’s good.  That’s a good deduction, yeah.”
“The fecal tests should prove my theory,” said Sherlock, “but that will take a few weeks.  Apparently, separating DNA from bloodsicles is a tricky business.  But I’m certain I’m right.  The murderer’s mistake was including the neck of a femur in one of the bloodsicles.  Too short to be bovine.”
Far above Catherine, where Sherlock’s torch painted a beacon, one of the icicles – scored by John’s bullet – comes free with a clean, cold
He listed for a few minutes, sleep held at bay by worry.  Moriarty was Fae.  Moriarty had slipped past Sherlock’s sight, passed himself off as an ordinary human. If Sherlock’s gift had holes in it, what else had slipped through?
“Nevertheless,” Ms. Helens says, “we cannot abide violence at Honeycomb Primary School.  If you can’t apologize, Rosie, I will have no choice but to tell the principal.  Your father will have to come in for a meeting, no matter how busy he is.”
Also - please let me know if you spot any mistakes or typos.  I'm running on fumes right now and the words were starting to swim in front of my eyes, so there's a good chance I missed something.  Thanks!
“It’s only my brother,” said Sherlock.  John turned his glare to the door, looking like a lion on the hunt, readying himself for the kill.  At last he nodded, but the deadly calm did not leave his demeanor as Sherlock went to the door.  He drew back the bolt and turned the knob.  “Mycroft.”
“I told him I wanted to confirm that he had nothing to do with Moriarty’s organization.  He was at Morcar Museum when Lady Smallwood was shot.  That rather effectively removed him from Mycroft’s suspicions.”
John stares back, unblinking.  He’s so, so close.  Raising a hand, he brushes his fingers through Sherlock’s curls.
Sherlock closes the door to the loo and twists the shower lever, surging hot water into the bathtub.  As steam fogs the mirror, he opens the cupboard above the sink.  A squat row of candles stands on one shelf, as orderly as soldiers.  He gathers a handful and places them on the rim of the tub.  The wicks are reluctant to light, damp from the steam, but eventually he has tongues of flame licking a merry line around the rising water. Lastly, he crumbles a bubble bar under the running water, tinting the water purple and filling the loo with a perfume of rosemary and lavender.
, you’re beautiful.  Just…”  He pushed a shaking hand against Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock let himself be pushed, let himself fall onto his back.  John straddled him in a single fluid motion, but there was nothing graceful in the pull of his hand, spit-slicked and squeezing, down the length of his cock.  His free hand found Sherlock’s hip and gripped tightly as he jerked himself.
Lestrade strides out of the milling throng of officers.  A mixture of triumph and sorrow plays across his features as his gaze settles on Sherlock, John, and Rosie.
front, his stomach slotted over John’s hips and his knees a bony tangle with John’s calves.  His hands – bloodied and clean alike – rested under his chin, on John’s chest.
Sherlock continues to stare at the laptop, a plan coalescing before his eyes. Before John, he had thought love was a chemical defect.  But perhaps his perception had been too narrow, his mind too unyielding for the unbiased scope of scientific research.  This is love, he realizes, stripped down to the barest essentials permitted by a cold, unfeeling world.  Natural. Animalistic.
“Mr. Holmes.”  John whirled around to see the big man limping toward them.  His right leg had been terribly injured, judging from his slow, pained gait.  The man stopped, nodded at John in greeting, and turned to Sherlock.  “You called saying we could meet with Mr. Everill again.”
“Right.”  John’s voice – the real John, not the one who had caressed his naked leg, held his hand with such tenderness – carries through the closed door with a sharp note.  “I don’t know if you can hear me, Sherlock, but I’m coming in.”
Mary froze, a chill sinking into the marrow of her bones.   Memories flooded her mind, tinged with a clinging residue of emotions she had thought long-dead.  Emotions she had drowned.  The abandoned house was not quite as abandoned as she had thought; a familiar voice echoed down the hall; a familiar face coalesced in the shadows.
Mrs. Hudson averted her gaze to her hands clasped in her lap.  She plucked at a nonexistent speck of dust on her skirt.  “Well, it’s like I said, isn’t it?  Always dashing about, never stops to rest.  That’s just Sherlock.  And he was busy organizing his brother’s affairs for a time…”
A soft moan dragged Sherlock from his reverie.  Dropping to his knees, he shone the torchlight under the table.  “He’s gone, Su Lin. John is…”
“Your Rose came to John under the guise of Mary Morstan,” said Sherlock.  John looked at him, touched by his haste to defend him.  “She was a nurse at John’s clinic, and she was the first to approach with romantic intentions.”
“You are,” John agrees.  Sherlock scrapes his teeth against the reddened skin and John shudders.  “Y-you really are.
Mrs. Hudson turned to Mycroft, who had taken up a post by the front door to watch the scene with wary contempt.  Clasping the handle of her suitcase in both hands, she mustered a brisk tone that wobbled only a little.  “Well, then.  Let’s be off.”
Sherlock rolled up his sleeve, clenched his hand into a fist, and cinched thumb and middle finger around the arteries of his wrist.  Blue rivers rose along the pockmarked landscape of his forearm.
Numbly, Sherlock carries the glass to the sink and pours its contents down the drain.  He puts the bottle of syrup back in the cupboard – a feat John would be amazed to witness, no doubt.  Then he carries the eggy bread to the bin, steps on the latch to pop open the lid, and tips the plate.  Watches the cold food unfasten and slide off to join the rubbish.
The joke fell flat, a balloon punctured before it could lift off the ground.  Sherlock glanced at John, and the mazikeen lowered his gaze.
Sherlock blinks slowly and shakes his head.  Tries to remember why he thought it was a good idea to drink during a stakeout – something about blending in, he supposes.  The bartender has sharp eyes.  A necessary precaution.  “I’ll be perf… perfeg… I’ll be
“You’ve,” he says, stops.  His voice is a little hoarse.  “You’ve got pine needles in your hair.  It smells—”
Thoughts spinning, John fell into a fitful doze.  His half-slumbering nightmares of Mary stealing Rosie, riding away on a boat as black waters churned and frothed around them.  John tried to swim toward them, but the water was icy and the current strong, submerging him, filling his mouth and lungs.  Every time he broke the surface, gasping, Mary and his child were farther away.
He turns left onto York Bridge and follows the footpath to the Inner Circle.  He passes a few people on the way; most Londoners have retreated from the snowfall, but these intrepid few are out to see the spectacle, bundled up so thickly in coats and scarves and hats and mittens that they are scarcely recognizable as humans.  They pay him no mind, too preoccupied to notice the famous detective in their midst.
After, they lie side-by-side, panting and sweaty and dazed.  John turns so he is flush against Sherlock.  His fingers stroke through the sparse hair on Sherlock’s chest.
“Shit,” John hissed.  He relinquished one bag to the welcome mat, leaning it against the closed door, and bent to retrieve the keys.
the slap of bare feet descending stairs.  The distant creak of hinges as a door is thrown open and the thunderclap
“I had,” he said, mortifying himself with a thin, telling rasp.  He cleared his throat.  “Um.  I was wondering why you hadn’t.  Hadn’t visited me in hospital.”
The weight of the Sig in John’s blood-caked hands.  He raised the gun, vision tunneling as he took aim.  The kick of recoil.  The detonation of the shot.
Lying beside John on the bed, sweaty and panting with the memory of silk under his fingers, Sherlock cannot bring himself to care.
“Oh.”  Frankly, Sherlock hadn’t cared about Lady Smallwood’s dirty laundry when Magnussen threatened to reveal Mary’s secrets.  “You are… very welcome.”
“She didn’t,” said John gently.  “Look, I… I know this is all going to come as a shock, but.  She changed her life.  She changed everything about herself, made herself into a completely different person.”
“Just thinking about what I’d like to see you in tonight.”  John bites the inside of his cheek, but his gaze is direct, a molten brand.  “And what I’d like to take off you.  Later.”
John would not be deterred.  He watched, taut as a bowstring, as the cab sailed toward Baker Street and rolled to a halt.  Sherlock was out of the cab as soon as the locks disengaged, pelting toward the front door of 221.  John paid the fare and followed, finding Sherlock seated on the sofa with John’s laptop perched on his knees.  John crossed to the sofa and sat beside him.
Sherlock stills, the question disarming him as neatly as a riposte.  Raising his gaze from the upholstery, he meets Rosie’s large, blue eyes.  Not a hint of guile lurks in those eyes.  Rosie is occasionally a terror, but she isn’t cruel or manipulative.
The flat in Putney was small but immaculate.  With the floors scrubbed to a fine sheen, the carpets hoovered, and the windows sparkling, every aspect of the flat reflected on its expert homemaker. As they walked through the kitchen, Sherlock swiped a forefinger over the windowsill over the sink.  The pad of his finger came away clean.
“Oh my God,” John croaked.  He rubbed his forehead, blinking hard.  “Oh my God.  How could she… I thought… I thought she loved Rosie, or-or came as close as she could to.  Jesus.”
With that pronouncement – stripped of anger, but with the complete conviction of a God casting down an unworthy supplicant – John left the room.
He gathers the tray, turns – and collides with Sherlock, standing soundless and still behind him.  John flinches, jostling the tray, and one of the teacups wobbles.
John opened his mouth to protest, but Sherlock cut him off with a nod.  “Very well.  I’ll explain everything when we’re back at Baker Street.”
The second reason is that John and Mary were married in the summer. Sherlock keeps that reason hidden away in his Mind Palace, behind the walls of a glass greenhouse.  A golden summer day.
Wincing, Sherlock climbed to his feet and staggered toward the gaping holes in the wall.  A warm breeze fanned across his face, bringing with it the stench of char and gas. Outside, the few remaining streetlamps transformed the clouds of dust into a gauzy shroud.
John shifts from foot to foot, a flush creeping over his face.  “And your cock—your cock is constantly being
.  They had passed the officers and stood before a corpse – male, mid-fifties or early sixties, podgy in his black trousers and button-up.  A loosened tie exposed his throat.
As they left the crime scene, giggling undercut by John’s hissed warnings, they were waylaid by Mycroft.  John watched in stony silence as Sherlock and his brother exchanged barbs, but he could not escape Mycroft’s reptilian stare.
The words are delivered with ease – almost levity – but each one seems to strike Seb like a pellet of buckshot.  He steps back, lips twisting, all pretense at civility gone.
Memories crash over Sherlock.  Another girl, another case.  Searching in vain, growing dread snapping at his heels.  A body left in a skip, as if the person it had once been was no better than garbage.
The sliver widens as the old woman pushes open the door.  Beyond her, a warmly-lit hallway is bisected by a stairwell and the entrance to a ground-floor flat.  My eyes wander to the stairwell, into the darkness above.
When John left the previous evening, Sherlock had retreated to his mind palace and busied himself filing away every conceivable detail he could recall from the kiss.  The warm rush of John’s huffed breathing slotted into place beside the panting exertion of a run through London streets and the quiet sighs Sherlock had caught so long ago, lying utterly still and silent in his bed, straining to hear John in the bedroom above.  The tensing of John’s forearms under Sherlock’s fingers joined the clamp of intertwined fingers they ran from the police.  It had taken hours of meticulous work to sort through all the sensations.
“I know you want to help him,” said Mary.  “That’s the kind of man you are.  You help people.  But if Sherlock doesn’t want you—”
Lestrade shook his head.  “The baby is fine, I promise you.  Well, she’s having a bit of a meltdown, but that’s to be expected.  They’ve had a fright.”
“McFarlane family crest,” Ferguson supplies.  “Confirmed it from Hector McFarlane’s mum, Ella.  Doesn’t get much more solid than this.”
They sit in companionable silence for a spell, watching the miserly Scrooge learn about Tiny Tim’s fate.  Rosie goes very still when The Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come arrives, cloak billowing and face in shadow.  Sherlock crooks an eyebrow at her.  “Are you frightened?”
Sherlock turns his focus back to the microscope, but keeps one ear on the sitting room, where John is gathering Rosie’s coat, hat, and mittens.  His voice is soft and low.  “Arms out, darling.  Yes, like that.”
John lowers the folded duvet and claps one hand to his brow.  “Christ.  Thought she was going to get a traumatizing eyeful for a second.”
Stamford returned to the lab hours later with a man in tow.  Pipette in hand, Sherlock stole a glance out of the corner of his eyes.  And fought not to stare.
Mr. Garrideb gestured to a flat, pale stone nestled in the chair back.  The splat was a framework of mahogany-rendered vines, curving and looping in graceful symmetry.  Cradled in the vines’ embrace, the Mazarin stone resembled a shining egg.
“You know what’s funny?” Mary says with an arid sort of laugh.  She looks at Sherlock then, a ghost of her old, cheeky humor flitting across her face.  “I’m not sorry.  Not for any of it.  Not the people I trod on, the jobs I took…”  Her eyes drift to the center of Sherlock’s chest, where his shirt covers the bullet scar she gave him.  “…I’m not sorry for any of it.”
And it’s completely illogical, it makes no sense at all.  But John’s conviction fuels Sherlock’s, settles the swirling tempest of his thoughts.  He looks around the road again.  Sifts through the irrelevant detritus and unearths the details, the facts.  Brushes them off, holds them up to the light.  A deduction snaps together.
An icy hand gripped John’s heart, squeezing so tight he feared it would burst.  If he failed Sherlock a second time…
Sherlock hesitates, then concedes with a nod.  Between walking with Catherine and returning to Baker Street, the former is preferable by a slim margin.  “Fine.  Let’s… walk.”
They break apart, their breathing ragged in the quiet air.  Sherlock rubs one of John’s cheekbones, memorizing the shape and feel of him.  John’s skin is soft and smooth under the pad of his thumb.  He wraps the sensation with great care and stores it in a safe, secret part of his Mind Palace.
He takes Sherlock’s hands and helps him stand.  The blanket falls to the floor with a whisper.  Feeling shrouded in a dream, Sherlock follows John, fingers entwined, down the corridor to his bedroom.  As they reach the door, John’s footsteps falter for an instant – then he draws Sherlock inside.  At the window, the curtains are drawn back to permit lamplight winking off the snow, all silver and blue.
Pain, sharp and sudden like a blade between his ribs, slitting a gasp from his throat.  He gulped, choked.  A tube was wedged between his teeth and down his trachea.  Blinding light flooded in as he opened his eyes and he clamped them shut, cringing against the intrusion.  Bright halos seared the backs of his eyelids.  Each failed breath dragged in a lungful of panic and
“Yes,” Sherlock says a third time.  It feels like sealing a magical curse, more potent and powerful than any oath he’s ever made.  “Get some rest, John.”
John regretted the words the moment they left his mouth – he sounded like a complete twat.  He sighed and closed his eyes, willing sleep to overtake him.  If he dozed off, Mrs. Hudson might take pity on him and leave.
“It’s not that,” Mrs. Hudson says, sniffling.  “I only just realized.”  She pauses to raise her cup for a shaky sip.
A muscle jerked in John’s jaw, but he didn’t rise to the bait.  “Did you learn anything about Mary?  Anything at all?”
Greg flicks his eyes from Sherlock to John.  Something has changed between them.  The yearning looks are nothing new; Greg is used to the mutual pining, has learned to dismiss it as white noise.  Donovan and Anderson and the others have bets on how long the two have been shagging, but Greg’s never pitched in.  He knows the difference between resignation and anticipation. It’s the bold-inked line between
A feather touch alights on Sherlock’s brow and he fights the urge to peek. “Wait,” John murmurs.  “Just… wait.  What are you thinking of?”
Very late in the night – or very early in the morning – Sherlock woke shivering.  Sweat slicked his skin and he kicked off the duvet.  The touch of the cool air only made him shiver harder, but at least he was no longer being smothered by a clammy weight.
Mrs. Hudson’s smile doesn’t waver.  “Oh, Sherlock.  We know each other too well for all that nonsense, don’t we?  You’ve lived here over ten years.  I should think I deserve a little more honesty than that, yes?”
Shouts fill the clearing.  Police officers pour through the trees, the cacophony of their voices joined by the wail of sirens.  Sherlock barely notices; all he can see is the blood.  Finding he can move, he stumbles to John’s side.
"At least there's that," John concludes, later, as they walk down the street.  His hand is tucked into the crook of Sherlock's braced arm, gentle but tethering.
