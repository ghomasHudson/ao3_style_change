Mycroft sent John a garment bag, a stack of files, and a car. Sherlock sent him so many texts that John made a show of putting his phone in the refrigerator before going upstairs to dress for the evening.
Pompilidae is the family name of the spider wasp. They are solitary and as their nickname suggests, are known for hunting and killing spiders. Do not check out the spider wasp wiki. It is chock-a-block with nightmare fuel.
John breaks the silent exchange of stares with tea and accompanying cakes and inane chat. Milk and sugar, slices and forks; John dutifully small-talks his way through the entire ceremony of playing the good host, and the Holmes brothers cautiously draw nearer each other as the meeting begins.
"Looking back, it must have seemed so crazy to her," John ruminates. Eye contact is a bit beyond him at the moment, but he's sprawled in Sherlock's chair and has the consulting detective nestled in his lap, plus both arms locked firmly 'round Sherlock's waist. With every limb in delicious contact, Sherlock is content to let John's averted gaze seem to be a result of comfort and convenience, instead of a deliberate defensive mechanism.
” John protested, latching on to the one bit of the conversation he felt sure of. “And I’d certainly never cheat on you! Never mind that you’d see it the moment I even
Greg bows out on the grounds that he's already committed himself body and soul by virtue of working as John's head of security, and has nothing left of himself to give. Also he's not sure he can think of anything that will top Dan's loudly declared willingness to stop by the office whenever John needs his cock sucked.
His hands start to itch, as if flakes of dried blood still linger between his fingers. He hasn't said a word, hasn't faltered in his review, but John suddenly interrupts by picking up Sherlock's pen hand and pressing a kiss to each knuckle, slow and solemn. Sherlock stares but John meets his gaze calmly as if he hasn't just displayed a remarkable instance of empathic abilities and open affection - in front of Mycroft, of all people - and sets the detective's hand back down once he's delivered the last kiss.
," Sherlock begs, the word bursting out of him before he can stop himself. Suddenly he wants nothing more in the world than a steady stream of hot water to stand under and the feel of real soap bubbles in his hands. He's already pushing the coverlet back when John stops him.
He'd endured two years of minimal involvement in and sporadic updates on a mission that had the potential to inflict considerable ruin upon his life, both professionally and personally, but that he could not acknowledge even existed. Sherlock had not emerged unscathed by any means, and could not have predicted the way in which John had welcomed him back. He now looked back at his relationship with his brother and wondered how it, too, would prove to have changed.
“Sherlock,  other than my primary care physician, dentist, and optometrist, and  probably for both our sakes my therapist, you are my first choice for  everything. And if you don’t feel like you are my first pick in any area  of my life, I’m just…respecting your choice not to be…that.“ He  resisted the urge to add a not very illustrative hand-wave.
“I lied; I have one more question,” he mumbled into  Sherlock’s shoulder. “If I, um, if I promise to break things off with  Mary, can I move back in?”
This gets a blink and movement from both eyebrows. Her mouth even twitches, like it’s trying to remember how to smile.
“Right, here’s what’s going to happen,” John declares, pulling the glass away when Sherlock turns his head slightly from the next offered sip. “I’m going to give you a very brief update on the past few weeks–
There are a thousand and one ways he wants to answer this offer, but he's completely unprepared. His defenses were destroyed, and the ones he's been building have been guarding himself against hoping too much, presuming too far, and now John has ambushed him with devotion. Sherlock's nose stings in an alarming herald of tears, and to head off both the waterworks and panic, he quips,
Hesitation interrupted the flow, and now he gnaws on his lower lip, staring anxiously at the next blank line. He has one part of John's note to address still, and here his mind is failing him. He doesn't have any experience on which to base deductions, their current situation is unprecented and unexpected and completely out of the realm of abductive reasoning, and he doesn't have enough data with which to do any inducing. The reasonable fall-back plan is to 'follow his heart' and 'trust his gut', but ironically that's what he'd relied on John to provide during that too-brief golden period before Moriarty's mad games. On his own, Sherlock is woefully unequipped, inexperienced, and afraid.
It's a look that makes him want to straighten up, throw his shoulders back, and smooth any wrinkles out of his vest. He settles for gingerly sitting forward from his squashed pillow nest and clearing his throat.
one out, but it had been more on principle than any real hurry. He'd capitulated almost immediately at John's explanation that he wanted to thoroughly enjoy each step they took together, instead of rushing through any part of it.
Sherlock's heart rate is still elevated and there's no hiding the slight sweat still gleaming upon his skin, but he's got his breathing under control at least, and in front of Mycroft is not how he wants to decompress and debrief. He gives John a simple nod and smile, and while it's not entirely convincing, it's good enough for the moment.
A shared look and smile and a small sigh of relief from Sherlock turns into some self-conscious fidgeting on both sides of the sofa. John is stroking the cards with his thumbs and glancing back and forth between them and their author, while said author tries to breathe evenly and occupies himself with shredding the corner of the encyclopedia-turned-writing-desk.
He resolves the issues - his included - over time, collecting information, scheduling awkard conversations, and disbursing generous severance packages. Sherlock offers advice and assistance, which surprises John a great deal, until he finds out that the detective merely wishes to expand his network of potential spies. Apparently domestic workers are goldmines of information and the holder of many keys.
"Didn't think you were," John replies good-naturedly. "But you'll get there eventually, and I was going to get condoms and lube anyway, since I figured we'd get
He squirms a little, not quite embarassed but something very close. He knows - he hopes, he is fairly certain - that the thought is silly and childish and utterly wrong. Insecurities are funny things though, and his heart a vast, fertile wilderness long lain fallow, ripe for poisonous vines to take over if he's not careful.
The feedback loop discovered during their first few kisses is still going strong. When John gives Sherlock anything more than a chaste, closed-mouth peck, there is a one hundred percent chance of Sherlock breaking out into full body goosebumps. Any additional nibbly kisses delivered before the shivers have time to fade triggers a cascade effect eventually resulting in a somewhat embarrassing but delicious loss of control. Sherlock squirms, clutches blindly, and buries his face in John's neck, whines, whimpers needily, and gasps out all the air in his lungs.
I gained access to your phone and made sure of who, what, when, where, and why. I probably shouldn't have risked sending you that text, but I couldn't resist teasing you a bit. Agent Halstead scolded me the whole way to the airport.
“I’ll…call  Pearl Garden, then, and put the kettle on, and I think there’s an  archeology marathon being broadcast. Is it…is it Jenny that you want me  to ring up? Or Julie, was it?”
When John reminds him that they're still confined to the upper storeys, he squawks in outrage and then goes on a rant that begins with logical arguments but rapidly descends into unflattering assessments of his brother's person and personality. He grows so increasingly noisy that John ends up wrestling him onto the couch and quieting him down with an arsenal of shushes (agravating), muffling hands (bitten), consoling kisses (grudgingly accepted), and a few strategic gropes (highly effective).
"Mycroft," John murmurs, and makes no protests as Sherlock leaves his corner. The gun stays ready, however, and John remains standing with his body angled, presenting less of a target to the doorway.
"It seems he dismissed you as a candidate to be used against me fairly quickly," Sherlock continues. "He'd gotten access to Dr. Dunaway's records but Mycroft had already deleted your referral to Dr. Hughes, so Moriarty only knew that you were in my inner circle and had a passing interest in me. That kept you safe, since he wanted to threaten me with as deep a wound as possible, and that meant targeting people with whom I had a reciprocal relationship."
with his mad, frustrating git of an adorable, gorgeous genius. An  iron-clad excuse to touch the untouchable had been tied off with a bow  and plopped into his lap - speaking of less altruistic parts - and he  was just sitting there in his chair like a lump--
DVD Commentary: This chapter borrows more from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Ian Fleming than BBC, as Irene relies more on her talent than her attractiveness, handily outsmarts Sherlock, and is zero percent attracted to him. Originally I'd written this chapter in my usual format, but it turned into this egregiously long and convoluted "Sherlock runs all over and under and through Paris with James Bond and has to outmaneuver MI6 and a rogue agent AND a genius hacker all at the same time while simultaneously listening to 007 flirt with his quartermaster over the comms AND try to maneuver Irene and Kate into bed - preferably at the same time - WHILST ALSO putting the moves on a very confused and conflicted Sherlock himself" crossover, and you can see why I decided to delete all of it and use the more efficient epistolary format to accomplish my goals for this chapter.
Sherlock drew breath to categorically deny this accusation, but deflated in a great, gusty sigh at John's next murmur.
John's eyelids squinch down, hard, like he's fighting off a bright light or sudden headache. Pale hands find their way almost automatically to the man's temples, smoothing back hair too short to need such a gesture, trying to soothe away whatever is hurting him. The contact eases Sherlock too, helps keep new fears from forming over whatever John wishes to confess, and he tentatively curls his hands 'round John's neck to anchor himself.
And I need to thank you for it all too. I am sorry, and I am grateful. Saying 'thank you' isn't anywhere near enough, but it's somewhere to start, and I am going to spend the rest of my life trying to express what it means to me that you were willing to sacrifice so much for my sake. Whatever support I can provide that will help you to recover from your time away is yours for the asking. Whatever I can do or say or be for you to make the rest of your life happy or not-boring or whatever you want it to be, just name it. You were and still are the most important person in my life, and I'm never going to deny it again, in word or deed.
I dearly wanted to insert wordplay about Irene going in "naked" which in spy novel parlance means that an agent operates without any cover story or back-up in place as a wee nod to BBC's "A Scandal in Belgravia", but I couldn't quite figure it out. Alackaday.
Sherlock shrugs uncomfortably, the giggle that was effervescing in his throat disappearing like the bubbles in a cheap sparkling wine.
"Should've written you another card," John mutters, then gives himself a quick shake. He shores himself up, setting his shoulders and firming his jaw, then takes a steadying breath and overturns Sherlock's reality like it's a shoddy balsawood table.
As his wounds continue to heal, more and more dressings are thrown away but not replaced, and Sherlock keeps a pleased tally as the days go by. The regular plasters, gauze squares, and protective films must have been permanently peeled away while he'd been sedated, and now he only has a few silicone sheets taped across the burns on his back.
"Humor me," he says, with a sigh that  seems heavy with years of disappointment. His tone somehow combines a  plea, a command, and a decree that it shall be. "My full name is  Gregory..."
"No," Sherlock replies, casual as he can. And in case it's not convincingly casual enough, adds a question designed to distract John away from pursuing the thought.
Sherlock banishes him from Baker Street before John can storm out on his own. To make up for the lack of a grand exit, John gets just drunk enough to feel like he can blame the alcohol instead of his self control when he smashes the rest of the scotch against some beautiful Italian marble.
John, despite the many ways in which he is ordinary, had proved from the very beginning of their acquaintance to be the perfect complementary component to Sherlock. He provides a sturdy foundation and a blank background, conducts light despite not being luminous himself, is a dull grey whetstone upon which Sherlock can sharpen his mind. How could it have taken them both by such surprise that he would also turn out to be an equally powerful reagent when it came to Sherlock's heart?
He stammers out an apology and attempts to explain how unprepared he was for John's confession, and thus how stunned, how shocked, how staggered. And these are still not very positive words, so he hastily tacks on that it's with
excited for Christmas," Sherlock replies, solemn and serious. He feels breathless but also like shouting for joy at John's spontaneous laugh.
It's ridiculous and painful and stilted and the most beautiful thing Sherlock's ever experienced. John keeps his eyes fixed on his cards for the most part, only glancing up now and then as if to confirm that his audience is still attentive. As if anything could distract Sherlock away from John's words. The voice that's so often and easily switched between charming and commanding now wavers between choked-up emotion and an awkward monotone. The speech is speckled with fierce emphasis on this word and that phrase, and his heart thuds painfully at each instance. Sherlock barely blinks, forgets to breath, drinks in every syllable and sigh like a parched man at an oasis.
"All done?" John's eyes are flicking curiously between the cards and Sherlock's slump back into the pillows.
They're staring at each other, eyebrows quirked and mouths twitching into smiles, and then at some invisible signal they're off the sofa and rushing to gather up shoes and scarves and jackets. They're grinning like children but herding each other with light brushes against the small of a back and happy little pats at shoulders.
Sherlock allows himself to be tucked protectively behind his doctor-physical therapist-bodyguard-boyfriend-
He's maybe made some undignified noise, because the couch shakes with how hard John is trying not to laugh aloud.
, just, um...my reply to your note, is what I should've said." He pauses to make sure Sherlock is breathing properly again, and then shakes his head ruefully.
Downsizing is both more and less complicated than John foresees. Solving crimes doesn't require Savile Row and he's got enough money that he doesn't care if the properties go for less than market value, but he finds himself unexpectedly conflicted that he a) has no idea how many staff he's got maintaining the places for him who may be facing unemployment and b) actually cares about this. He goes back and forth on the emotional sliding scale; feels happy to discover that he cares about what happens to people, realizes he's an arse for not having cared before, congratulates himself for growing up a bit, feels pathetic that he's still needing to take steps towards minimum basic requirements for being a decent human being at his age, and et cetera.
And Sherlock talks. He's famous for his taciturnity among those few who know him and his sulks are the stuff of legend, yet he makes an effort to draw John out, to rile him up, and to make him think. Their conversations are more like arguments than chat, with Sherlock challenging John's ways (or lack) of thinking and also using the man as a sounding board for puzzling out his own tangled thoughts. For all the frowns and curses and shouting, it's more bracing than bruising. John keeps coming back for more with that cocky grin of his, and in between visits, Sherlock finds himself looking around for those sharp blue eyes, somehow always already pinned on him, except when they're absent.
And Sherlock thinks back to how John had wanted to keep him alive, and safe, and healthy from the very beginning of their acquaintance. To protect his reputation, his feelings. To have others acknowledge that he had feelings at all, in fact. To make him happy by
"Only when it comes to things you're naturally good at, or don't give a toss about," she replies, and raises a sardonic eyebrow at him. "And I can tell you do care about that dear silly boy, or I wouldn't be sharing my shortbread biscuits with you. Now, as I said; confidence. No decent person would think any less of you, you know, if you--"
that I'd asked for, I wanted to make sure I said everything I needed to, without getting all worked up and sidetracked, or anything like that."
Priorities taken care of, John's manners reassert themselves, and he turns back to offer Mycroft a chair and a cup of tea. While John puts a tray together in the kitchen, the brothers pick each other over across the coffee table, light eyes darting this way and that, lingering over a wrinkle, sharpening over a fingernail. It's soothing in its own way, the ease with which they settle into this initial sortie even after all this time apart. After a few seconds, however, Sherlock finds himself collecting data merely for the comfort of finding Mycroft as familiar as ever he was, and not because he is searching for ammunition with which to arm himself. This discovery is made palatable by the nearly simultaneous observation that his brother's sharp gaze has softened, and that he seems to be simply enjoying the sight of Sherlock looking quite healthy and whole.
"I'm not sure," Sherlock replies honestly. Will that change too? Will he sink back into old habits, once he's settled back into old haunts?
A couple of months down the road, the now-five person crew actually wins one of the races they enter as a team, and John brings them all to the villa on Hampstead Lane to celebrate by breaking into his liquor cabinet and splashing about in his pool. There's the expected wide-eyed, slack-jawed boggling when they realize
New rule: I mustn't start posting a story until I've actually finished writing it. That will save you at least, dear readers, from some angst-ticipation!
He drags his eyes back up, feeling dazed, feeling high, feeling like he can see everything including the future but there's so much input that he can't make sense of any of it. He's been comprehending all the words perfectly well, but at the moment that the big picture should coalesce, it all scatters into confetti.
The last thing he remembers with any real clarity is how comfortingly warm John is, how lovely to wrap around, like a hot water bottle except filled with grief and guilt. After that it's a jumble of surreal nightmares weaving themselves in and out of the terrifying ordeal of discovering that he's got two older siblings who are smarter than he is. He wonders at his parents for having the courage - or temerity - to conceive him.
It's so simple and obvious, now that John's put it into words. Is this how John feels, when Sherlock explains the observations and reasonings that lead him from the pink hydrangeas behind a Devon property to the buried body of the real estate agent's mistress? Perhaps Sherlock ought to be a bit more gracious when detailing his deductions.
First kisses are, for the most part, short, simple, and unremarkable except for the novelty of holding the inaugural post. Sherlock has time to start up a panic that he'll waste the experience itself in scrambling to collect data points during the minimal time allotted. But John leans in, gently presses his lips to Sherlock's, and stays there. The seconds slowly unspool, and Sherlock finds that he's being given plenty of time to record every sensation and reaction and impression. His pulse calms, he learns by example that one need not hold their breath during a kiss, and he discovers that he rather enjoys the flutter of John's eyelashes against his skin.
In the early stages of recovering his health, Sherlock finds it easy to revel in gratitude and nostalgia. Keeping himself from attempting to see too far into the future and along the many paths of possibility is not too difficult a task, especially when he keeps his short term goals in mind; get well and have A Talk with John. Anxiety is not conducive to any aspect of his health, nor will it keep John amiable. First things first, and he can worry about all the rest when he has the strength to deal with the consequences, whatever they may be.
“John sent that after he moved in with Mary. It was the only message he has sent me since she came back,” Sherlock said, staring at the floor, trying to stop his cheeks from turning pink.
When the glass was finally removed, John patted the wound over with the damp cloth, making sure there was nothing left. The hospital would have been able to stitch the wound together, but the only thing in the flat's first aid kit (the kit that John had bought specifically for Sherlock years ago) had a few strands of sterile tape. It would have to do.
Red and blue lit up the street as the police cars neared. A few people in pyjamas and housecoats had left their houses to see what the noise was about. It was obvious this tiny neighbourhood never saw much action and a few of the spectators pulled their phones out to catch some of the action.
John saw a tiled ceiling with florescent lights. Around him he smelled disinfectant. Beneath him was a hard mattress and on him was a scratchy blanket. When the lights became too bright he closed his eyes and listening to what was happening around him.
Sherlock was still trying to catch his breath as he stared at Lestrade. Slowly he felt himself grow stronger and he managed to sit himself up, leaning against the headboard.
Sherlock had wanted to kiss him for ages and had imagined what their kiss would be like. It was supposed to be romantic and passionate, not drunk and sloppy. This was all wrong but he still wasn't able to pull out of John's grasp. Because he accepted he'd never be able to kiss John Watson and realised he was a married man. That John wasn't gay, as he always insisted. And knowing this would be their only kiss they would share, Sherlock kissed John back and tried to memorize every detail. The bitter taste of beer, the scent of the aftershave he used, the softness of his lips, those soft gentle hands running through his curly hair.
John was adamant to leave the hospital as soon as he awoke. The nurses had to practically tie him down in bed to make him stay so he could properly recover. And when he was able to leave, he immediately went back home to 221B.
“I've wanted to do this for ages,” John admitted as he leaned forward, placing a hand on Shelrock's chest for balance. “Thought about this a lot. Never really though it'd actually happen.” John gave a shy smile as he rolled his hips. Sherlock immediately reacted by pressing his head back into the pillow. That was a sight to see: Sherlock bare and vulnerable in front of him like that. John kept moving against him, kept rolling his hips into Sherlock and watched as his breathing sped up, the way his fingers clenched into the bedsheets. Sherlock had his eyes squeezed closed and breathed heavily through his nose.
“You didn't even let me finish.” John kissed Sherlock's cheek as he ran his fingers through his dark hair. “I only want someone perfect looking after Rosie, too. But if I'm going to work and you're going to go on cases, we need someone to look after Rosie.”
“I got a text from John,” he explained, pulling out his phone and looking at the message. “I think he's in trouble.”
Molly nodded. “The other day I came by with flowers,” she said. “Because... I'm not sure what else you bring to someone who was dead but now isn't. I thought flowers would be safe. And I spoke to Mary, but come to think of it, John never even came to the door.”
Without thinking twice, Sherlock grabbed the paper and stared at it. But they were just gas receipts. Sherlock scowled and crumpled the paper in his hand and let it fall to the floor, not bothering to clean it up.
Mycroft ignored the question, his eyes on John. “What possessed you to take a case the night you planned to propose to him? I take it you didn't propose to him. Waited until the last minute and now there's no longer a last minute to wait for.”
Sherlock started to struggle against her, tossing his head from side to side, trying to loosen her grip. But she held on, intent on finishing what she had started.
but it's an act, isn't it? A bloody act!” John continued on his rant, his voice getting louder and louder.
Someone came through the door. Tall. Dark hair, dark coat. Pale face. The man, the stranger nearly jumped when his eyes locked with John's and he came rushing to his side, grabbing his hand. The man had a look of concern on his face and his eyes were watery.
In the meantime, Sherlock was in the process of thinking up a new way to trick Mary into revealing her plans.
It was past midnight and John had work the next morning (he preferred to shower the night before work and his hair was a bit puffy from the brand of shampoo he used and he smelled of that horribly scented soap he always used). But still he had time for tea.
John was undressing when Sherlock entered his room. There was a certain eagerness to John's movements, but no passion. No love, no caring, just some kind of readiness to get back at Mary. John threw his shirt on the floor and wrapped his arms around Sherlock, kissing him again. Sherlock could feel John's cock through his jeans.
“What's this?” John began to sound frustrated, as if he couldn't figure out why Sherlock couldn't magically see the contents of the envelope.
When he awoke again, he found Sherlock's head in his lap, eyes closed. John raised his awkward and heavy hand and placed it on his cheek. Sherlock's eyes opened and focused on John. “Hey.” John still felt like he had been hit by a truck. In fact, he was starting to feel like he'd been hit by ten trucks: his head throbbed and his chest hurt and his entire body ached.
“Oh! For--!” A sudden rage took over and Sherlock smacked the wall as he turned to face John. “Why? Why is it so important I meet anyone? Why do I need someone else? I don't. I work alone. I'm happy alone. I'm my best self. Alone.” Everyone asked him that question. Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, even Mycroft. It wasn't as if he could just go into the street and find himself a replacement John. Couldn't fall in love with just any old idiot. People were stupid, boring, predictable. And John was all of that and more.
Sherlock opened the box, revealing a golden ring. “And this isn't romantic or even thought out and..” he trailed off, his brow furrowing as he realised he should have taken John up on his offer of waiting until tomorrow. But he was already on one knee with the ring shining in its box. "So.. so John Watson, will you marry me?" The confidence Sherlock usually had about him melted away.
She knew to Sherlock, she was background noise to him. And he always spoke kindly to her when he needed to use the lab or her advice, but when she wasn't needed, she went ignored. She never felt she was a friend of Sherlock's, more like a colleague. And now that John was spending his time with Mary, it looked as though Sherlock was asking Molly to be his John for the time being.
“It. Didn't.” Sherlock had of course wondered what he'd do if he had lost John. There weren't many regrets he had when it came to his lover. Perhaps he could have kissed John sooner rather than wait for his divorce to finalise. Maybe they should have waited to have sex (it was a bit of a disaster). But the point was that he did kiss John and they did have an awkward first sexual encounter and in the end he regretted none of that. The one regret he would have had, was not asking John to marry him sooner.
“Not clever enough it seems,” Mycroft replied while Sherlock stared at his sister in confusion. So many questions were running through his mind, but now wasn't the time to ask them. “It's over, Eurus. Put the gun down. If you shoot John Watson, we'll shoot you.”
Sherlock, who was seated beside him, didn't look all that interested either. To disguise himself, he wore a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and an ill-fitting auburn wig. It made his head feel overheated and itchy.
But Sherlock refused to leave and before he knew it, he was in handcuffs and thrown into the back of the police cruiser. Lestrade had gotten into the driver's seat to drive him off to the station when Sherlock muttered who was responsible for the crime. At first Lestrade thought he was just saying things, but the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. As he drove off, he radioed the other officers and the case was solved by the time he made it to the station. Sherlock had a smug grin on his face and Lestrade stated, “You'd make a good cop.”
“But Eleanor's doing well. Eating a lot and growing like a weed. She's grown so much already. Every day she looks a bit different, a bit older than before.” Eleanor opened her eyes and whimpered. “Are you sure you don't want to hold her?”
Interviews were a nightmare to say the least. Sherlock and John received a number of applications and weeding through them was a lengthy process. They saw an entire range of people. Some weren't qualified enough in Sherlock's eyes. Others were too strict. Some were too nice. Sherlock approved of some, and John approved of others, but they couldn't agree on anyone.
“It really isn't appropriate to bring a baby here,” Lestrade said. “Look, I know I asked you to come, but I didn't realise you'd bring Rosie.” Rosie cooed at the sound of her name. “But I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. This is no place for a baby, I'm sorry.”
John opened a cupboard on the other end of the kitchen and pulled a tea bag from its box and tossed it over to Sherlock. With a bit of aiming, he managed to catch the tea bag right in the mug and frowned as some of the hot water splashed out.
John took the ring from the box and slid it onto his finger. “Yes, yes you idiot of course I'll marry you.”
Mary smiled again. “I do prefer the gun method. It's faster, has less talking. I don't have to do as much work,” she replied. “But this way, your friends at the Yard will have a suspect.” She leaned forward and placed a hand over his mouth and pinched his nose with her other. “Remember that friend of yours? The one that owned the hospital. Didn't he like to kill people this way? Wouldn't he want some kind of revenge? Why wouldn't he just pop in and finish the job he started?”
“Who are you, again?” John asked as he leaned back in his seat, glancing out the large window to see countryside zoom by in a blur.
“How did you find me?” Eurus still had the gun trained on John as she frowned dramatically. “I thought I was being clever.”
Sherlock felt his vision begin to blur and his limbs grew heavy. Even his struggling grew slow and laboured. Mary smiled as she felt his breaths grow shallower and shallower. It would only take a moment now.
“Well, you know, assassins make a generous amount of money for their jobs,” Sherlock replied, trying to find some optimism in John's situation. “So she could be saving up for Eleanor's university education. Maybe she wants a bigger home or nicer things. Perhaps she was planning a nice trip for the both of you.”
Sherlock was gawked at as he walked into the house. Some officers were bent over taking pictures of a corpse that was on the ground while others were dusting for fingerprints or finding evidence. But they all stopped and stared as soon as he walked in.
Lestrade shrugged. “She's clever. Really clever. Don't you think she'd have some people working for her? Have a plan in case she got arrested? Can't see how that'd solve anything or keep John safe.”
“I needed help with the case.” Sherlock sat opposite his brother, sitting up straight, shoulders rolled back.
John took a sip of his drink, then shook his head. “It's safe with me.” Every so often the two would get together and talk about cases. It was obvious John missed the trill of being on cases and Lestrade liked bragging about the cases he had actually solved on his own. Sherlock didn't help out with cases all the often anymore – always said he was busy with something else.
“You don't think I have a chance with her, do you?” Greg asked quietly, voicing the doubts that had been running around his mind for the past while.
A working title for this chapter was "Foxtrots desperately tries to duct tape over what happened in series 4 like what actually happened with Molly" I really, really hated that phone scene (and that episode in general) and in my series 4 fix-it fic, I'm trying to fix whatever went on with Molly. thb I don't think it can be truly fixable, but here's an attempt.
The man looked over his shoulder to see his pursuers had caught up to him. In the cold air their breath could be seen in the glow of a streetlight. The taller man took a few tentative steps forward, holding his hand out.
“Something on your mind?” John placed his hand on the table, inviting Sherlock to hold it. They never went out for dinner at restaurants as fancy as this. Something was up and John already had his suspicions. Sherlock had been acting nervous, fidgeting in his seat, stuttering when he spoke. But John had never expected Sherlock to be the type who wanted to get married. It seemed too traditional and conventional for Sherlock's tastes. Though John couldn't figure out why else this dinner would be for.
Sherlock did his best to ignore the looks and crouched beside the corpse. “I thought it was a quadruple murder,” he said as he gently examined the body. Rosie gurgled and reached out to the body and Sherlock had to hold her grabbing hands back.
Molly bit her lip. “I always thought she was up to something,” she admitted quietly. “It was all a bit odd, don't you think? When you did your thing on the roof, Mary showed up almost immediately. Like there was a plan for it. But I thought that was crazy and it was all just a coincidence and I should have felt happy for John and I was, but I couldn't help but wonder if...” she trailed off.
“Yeah. Yeah and...” John already lost his train of thought and instead just stared at Sherlock. Stared at his pale face, pronounced cheekbones, perfect lips, his curly hair. Soft hair, probably. John wanted to touch it, run his fingers through it. Get his fingers tangled in his hair. “Do you have a girlfriend?” he blurted out suddenly.
Sherlock abruptly got out of bed, tugging at the elastic band of his sweat pants. When he returned, he had the velvet box in his hands. And then he went on one knee. John crawled to the edge of the bed to get a better look at him.
Mary wasn't the only thing on John's mind, Sherlock found. John's posture wasn't relaxed – shoulders raised, holding a high amount of tension. John impatiently cleared his throat, waiting for Sherlock to reveal the contents of the envelope and that put the final piece into the puzzle. John hadn't had sex since the conference. Had been avoiding sex, keeping it away from Mary. Their relationship was on the rocks and John had left his home at midnight to seek the detective's help, leaving Mary and Eleanor oblivious and asleep.
As the kettle heated up, Sherlock picked through their limited selection of cereal and chose the one with the highest sugar content. The previous night, Sherlock had stayed up late working on a case, and worst of all, it was still unsolved.
And just like that, things went back to normal, as if those past few months didn't happen. John was with Mary and Sherlock was with no one.
“I'll see you Monday,” Sherlock replied. Fridays were the worst. It meant two entire days without Rosie or John. That left him plenty of time to work on current cases, but the flat felt so empty when it was just him.
Despite all that, he left the sofa and followed John up to his room. Because they might never have another chance at this. Even if it was for the wrong reasons, Sherlock still wanted to be part of this.
Sherlock scoffed. John didn't actually feel that way. It was a mix of grief and some other emotion he was feeling. Soon enough he'd be back to dating and would find a replacement Mary and move in with her and leave Sherlock behind again.
Joining Greg for coffee had become a habit. Every Monday they went to the same place and ordered the same drinks: for Greg a black coffee and for John, tea with two sugars.
Sherlock didn't even give his brother time to close the door before interrupting him: “I'm not going home. I'm staying here until he wakes.”
Sherlock dropped his search and clicked on the text bubble. It led him to the email. It was short and to the point:
“See you tomorrow, I guess,” John said quietly. The train due to take them home was leaving early the next day. John wasn't looking forward to stuffing down a continental breakfast before racing to the train station.
Sitting in Sherlock's chair with Rosie on her lap, the babysitter smiled. “She was fine. She's always fine,” she replied, running her fingers through Rosie's curly blonde hair. The same curly blonde hair the babysitter had. On the arm of the chair was a red wig, no longer of use.
John made himself comfortable in his old chair, and Sherlock sat across from him. Sherlock kept his eyes on John, taking in every detail he could. Obviously his marriage wasn't working out – why else would be spend his Friday night drinking? There was tension in his shoulders and he clenched his jaw – something important was on his mind, though Sherlock would have been more open to listening if John wasn't intoxicated.
Sherlock stared at the child, taking in what he could. Blonde scratches of hair covered her head, and although he couldn't see her eyes, he knew they were blue. Her delicate nose was John's and her lips were Mary's.
Sherlock looked suddenly pale and he clutched his phone to his chest, not wanting Molly to see the message. Or at least not the entire thing. But explaining it out loud would be so much harder than just letting her see and he handed the phone over.
Sherlock placed the envelope on the cushion beside him and settled his hands in his lap. John stared back at Sherlock, waiting for something. A deduction, maybe. Maybe he'd stand up and point out how very clever he was and deduce what was in that envelope and might as well deduce what John had for breakfast just to show off. But Sherlock didn't move from the sofa. In fact, John wasn't entirely sure if Sherlock was even blinking. It looked as if he had just turned into a statue.
“Sherlock and I are going to go out for some new clothes for Rosie,” John explained as he handed his daughter over to the babysitter. Rosie beamed the moment she was placed in Marcella's arms. “We're only going to be gone a few hours. You have my number in case anything goes wrong. But I doubt anything will go wrong. Rosie's a very good girl and she doesn't get into trouble.”
Sherlock sat on a plastic chair in the hospital's waiting room. A wall clock obnoxiously ticked away and the water cooler hummed as it tried to get the water to a lukewarm temperature.
Over the past few weeks Sherlock had many opportunities to propose. In fact, those opportunities seemed to throw themselves at him. But he never took a single one. At this rate, he'd never propose. "I need to do this. Because, well.. I'm a bit scared. Nervous. Everyone said you'd say yes and marry me. But I need a real answer from you. I need to hear it from you.”
“Shit!” Mary hissed as she released Sherlock from her grip. She removed herself from his chest and searched around the room for a place to hide. If Greg walked in now, there wouldn't be an explanation for her being there. Surely he'd assume some kind of affair was going on, seeing her in his room at this time. But hiding would be no use, would it? Sherlock would know her hiding spot and just reveal her to Greg. It was then her eyes locked on the window.
After a brief explanation of how she died and why she died, John and Mary went to live together with Rosie back in their old flat. John sold the flat when he left it, but Mary was the secret buyer, knowing she'd be able to return soon. The reason for her death was to tie loose ends of her past and faking her death consisted of a rehearsed scene with Vivian using a fake gun and some fake blood.
John grabbed onto his cock and began stroking it as he rode Sherlock. The poor detective was all but squirming beneath John and that was a sight John promised himself he'd never forget.
Sherlock didn't expect to find John at Baker Street at this hour. Surprised, he let his old flatmate in, taking note of his slurred speech and wobbly gait.
“Something wrong?” Lestrade asked, noticing Sherlock's pale face, his heaving shoulders as he breathed.
“As you know, Mary isn't dead,” Sherlock said slowly, as if he were talking to a scared animal that would run away if he spoke too fast.
“Why are you so alone?” John drawled on. “Why don't you just...” As John continued his ramblings, Sherlock began to dial the number of a cab service. Whatever John had on his mind could wait until he was sober. “...because who likes being alone? Who
“Can you hear me?” he demanded. John didn't respond. “Can you hear me?” John's heart monitor steadily beeped. “This is fine, you know. This waiting. Well, not fine, but I'll do it. I'll wait. I'll wait a year if I have to. I'll wait however long it takes because you waited for me.” Sherlock pulled a face. “Well, you didn't really. You moved on and found Mary and I ruined your proposal – that was fun – but in the end you sort of waited. And I'll wait for you. I owe you that much. I
When the conference was over, John stood up and stretched his back. “How's the case coming?” he muttered to Sherlock.
“Why not have your brother watch your flat? See if anyone comes back?” Lestrade asked as he sat on the sofa with Sherlock, watching television. Sherlock stayed curled up against the arm of the sofa, wrapped in his blanket.
John held his cup out to be refilled and Sherlock obliged. The wine was making him feel warm and he knew his cheeks were turning red. Things felt looser and he felt he was able to speak what was on his mind.
John made his way to the door, and Sherlock followed. But before he left, he turned around to face Sherlock and ever so gently placed a hand on the bandages. “Take care of yourself, okay?” he said, carefully rubbing his hand up and down the injured arm. John looked him in the eye. “Okay?”
“There's no where to go, Max,” Sherlock said as the man fought to get his foot and jacket free from the fence. Finally he managed to pull his foot from the fence, but he lost his balance. The jacket ripped from where it had been caught, causing him to fall over. But the man quickly got back on his feet and shoved his hand into his jacket pocket. Still there. It's still there.
“What I'm trying to say is...” John interrupted, but lost his voice. The two stared at each other for a moment, John looking completely serious and Sherlock looking vulnerable. They stared in complete silence because nothing had to be said. What John wanted to say had already been said again and again ages ago. But just to make sure Sherlock really did understand what John meant, he ever so gently reached for Sherlock's hand and Sherlock ever so gently laced his fingers between John's. “Is this okay?”
Marcella let herself into the flat and when she walked into the living room, she saw a perfectly clean flat and in the middle of that living room were Sherlock and John. Rosie was balanced on John's hip and the way the two men stood together made them look like a family. It was touching.
Sherlock assumed he was experiencing sleep paralysis. It was early morning when he was beginning to wake up and he felt something heavy on his chest. Something that squeezed the air out of his lungs. When he opened his eyes, he saw a figure above him, sitting on his chest. It was in shadow as the sun was still rising and a curtain hung at the nearby window, blocking out most of the outside light. But the figure slowly came into focus. Even in the dark, he started to see the figure's fine features, see the shine of her blonde hair, the curve of her cheek. It was unmistakably
Sherlock did his best to ignore John's comments. “We're done here. I'm calling you a cab,” he said as he held the phone to his ear and listened to the boring dial tone.
“How'd he propose?” Greg pointed to the gold band that wrapped itself around John's finger. John grinned and took a moment to admire it.
The case itself had already been solved – Dr Richardson was not an attractive man. No one would want to have an affair with him just based on looks, but he was a very rich man. Rich enough to pay for an affair. Dr Richardson must have thought he was so smart to figure this out. A hotel after all, was the best place to hide an affair: it was out of town, away from family, and the only person who needed to be checked into the room was Richardson himself, not any guests.
John didn't feel any pain when the bullet hit him. There was an uncomfortable pressure in his chest, but no pain. Still, he knew what had happened: the gun was still pointed in his direction and Sherlock's startled expression said it all.
“I'm not mad, you know,” John said, breaking the silence. Sherlock didn't reply and instead thought about how he could defuse John. “I'm really not.” Despite it all, John was smiling. “I should have known better. I should have known you wouldn't stay away from cases.”
John fell to his knees, then fell forward, collapsing on the damp ground. Sherlock struggled to make his legs move, to rush to John's side. Only a few metres stood between them, but it felt like it took hours to reach him.
John leaned over and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock froze from the sudden contact. “It was weird. Really strange, but...” John drifted off to sleep for a few moments before waking himself again. “It...it was the best night of my life.”
Sherlock glared at Mycroft from his spot on the chair. Mycroft knew the answer, he obviously knew the answer and he still wanted to tease it out of his brother. The clock on the wall tick-tocked away, but Sherlock didn't pay attention to how many seconds had gone by. They sat in silence, Sherlock too proud to speak, and Mycroft enjoying the sight of his brother squirming like that. Finally Sherlock grew impatient and broke his silence:
John grabbed the mat, nappy, and a few baby wipes from the carrier and took Eleanor to the bathroom. And just like that, Sherlock was alone again. The baby still fussed and Sherlock could hear her whines from the bathroom and John's gentle voice still trying to comfort her.
“There was something I always wanted to tell you. And I never did because I suppose I was scared. And you had Mary.” Sherlock was losing hope now. The odds of him waking were growing smaller each day. “Now seems like a good time to tell you.” Even with John in this state, Sherlock found it hard to say what he really wanted to. “I love you.” Sherlock paused, waiting for John to wake up. They did in the movies. A love confession fixed everything. “I love you. I've loved you for ages. I have always loved you.”
Somehow, the stranger in the back of the cruiser persuaded Lestrade to let him sleep on the sofa that night. And the following night. And the following months.
“See you later,” he said as he went to the door. Before he left, he paused, his hand resting on the doorknob. “Sherlock...” his voice was suddenly gentle.
Sweaty palms. Beneath the table Sherlock was bouncing his knee with impatience. As each second past, Sherlock was positive his heartbeat went a bit faster. At this rate it'd just explode in his chest and he'd flop over dead on the table.
John sighed through his nose, giving Sherlock that judgemental look he never realised he missed until now. That look where John's brow grew heavier and the bags under his eyes grew darker as he wore an expression of mock-disappointment. Mock-disappointment. Because his eyes gave it all a way. Those dark blue eyes still had some light in them, some degree of caring. Those eyes that held back a smile because that's what Sherlock – his Sherlock – did best: get himself torn up so his doctor would have to mend him. And John didn't mind being his doctor for one moment.
The man ran down the rainy street, hand in his jacket pocket. By now his breathing was heavy and he needed a moment to rest, but he couldn't afford such a luxury. So he kept running down the narrow street of the small neighbourhood. Dogs barked in their yards as he ran by, giving off his position. “Quiet!” he hissed, but that did nothing to stop the barking.
Mycroft stood, straightening his waistcoat. All his life he felt a need to protect his younger brother, but he always seemed to fail. Whether it be school bullies, his addictions, his dangerous work, falling in love or even heartbreak, Mycroft couldn't protect him no matter how hard he tried. “Let me know when you start planning the wedding.”
“It's gonna be a beautiful day.” Lestrade made his way to the window and pulled back the curtains. Seeing the window open, he pushed it shut. “You're gonna catch a cold with that thing open,” he added in, oblivious to Mary's presence. She left no hint that she was even there. Not even the scent of her perfume could be smelled – it looked like she learned from her past experiences. “I was thinking we could go out for a walk. Get some fresh air, and get you out of the flat.”
John had sat straight up in bed when he heard his phone vibrate against the bedside table. That night, he had trouble sleeping. Most nights he had trouble sleeping and the phone was a welcome distraction.
What they had didn't need a name. It didn't need to be in a category of “boyfriends” or “partners” or “lovers.” They were happy together and that was the only thing that mattered.
John placed his hand over Sherlock's. “Something wrong?” he asked. For the entire ride back from the store, Sherlock seemed a bit distant, just as he did when they were leaving the flat.
Sherlock looked up from his book to take in the tired sight of John. Bags under his eyes, a tired frown on his face, messed hair and dishevelled pajamas. Sherlock was tempted to remind John he was perfectly capable to help with Rosie's care, but he knew that'd be turned down.
Sleep paralysis is often described as the inability to move while waking from sleep. Other descriptions include feeling a weight on your chest making it difficult to breathe. Or seeing a monster of sorts in front of you, but not able to move away from it. The hallucination feels real and causes distress to the individual.
John shook his head. “Don't be. It was unfortunate what happened but...” he looked into Sherlock's eyes. “It is what it is.”
John pulled away when the shirt got caught over Sherlock's head and he stood up from the sofa. “Come here,” he muttered as he left that floor and went up the stairs to his old room.
Both Sherlock and John were in bed, surrounded by a number of papers. They were carefully going through each babysitter that showed some potential.
Sherlock explained: the case, John getting shot, how long he had waited for John to wake up, how relieved he was to see John awake and doing well (as well as he could be, all things considered). But John had blanked out for a moment and fell back asleep.
The pub was full, as was expected for a Friday night. The usual patrons huddled around the bar, while the non-regulars occupied the tables that seemed to be placed haphazardly on the floor. Servers weaved around the tables, squeezing themselves through tight spaces while balancing heavy trays on their nimble fingers. It was looked almost like figure skating, at least if would if anyone paid attention to the servers. They only seemed to be noticed when they were arriving with food and drinks.
Molly slowly blinked. “If you're asking me to be a replacement John, I won't do it. I won't go on cases with you and say you're clever and do whatever else John does on cases. I'm not his replacement.”
“And why exactly did you come here?” Mycroft lazily looked over the case files, tossing them to the side with disinterest.
When he opened his eyes again, morning light was trailing in through the window. Rain pit-pattered against the glass. It still felt like he was being held down by an impossibly heavy blanket.
John tried to move, but it felt like his blanket was made of lead. Even moving his fingers took effort and keeping his eyes opened started to feel impossible. So he closed his eyes, just for a second.
“Just wanted to let you know I'm gonna head in early,” John stated, feeling like he had to inform Sherlock of when he was going to sleep. It felt like he was asking a teacher to use the bathroom in public school.
John copied his motion, but instead of heading to the door, he wobbled his way over to Sherlock. “What's wrong with you? Don't you care?” John was so close Sherlock could smell the beer on his breath. “Why don't you care?” Suddenly, John's voice became soft and gentle. “What are you afraid of?”
Molly sat across from him, curling up in a cat-hair-covered armchair, her legs tucked beneath her. She stared at Sherlock, unsure why he decided to invite himself in. Ever since that phone call, Molly had been distant toward Sherlock and the two had never spent time alone together. John was always there to break the ice or ease tensions.
Lestrade thought he couldn't be more helpful when he offered Sherlock a safe place to stay for the time being. But to him it was hard to believe Mary was up to something. John regularly sent Lestrade texts as he did before and noticed no change when Mary returned. Lestrade wasn't doing to say it to Sherlock's face, but he was fairly certain Sherlock was exaggerating the whole thing. After all, Sherlock had a tenancy to be dramatic and while the attack in his room wasn't an exaggeration (he had marks left on his face from the attacker) Lestrade wasn't entirely sure it was Mary herself. It was dark in the room and Sherlock did have a number of enemies and how would Mary be able to sneak out of her house so early in the morning without rousing suspicion? It didn't add up.
John took Eleanor from her carrier and gently placed her in Sherlock's arms, making sure he was supporting her head properly. It took him a moment to figure out how to hold her, how to make her feel safe and secure in his arms without holding her too tight.
John crossed the room to the sofa and hovered over Sherlock. “Be good,” he said as he leaned over to give him a kiss. Then he leaned even further down to kiss Rosie on the top of her head. She seemed more interested in devouring her toy.
The television show ended, only to be replaced by the next episode. A blonde woman was holding a gun at a cowering man who was pleading something. Then, a woman identical to the blonde burst into the room. The man shouted out in surprise. “It's never twins,” Sherlock mused to himself.
A strange man with thick glasses and auburn hair stood behind the door. “Room service,” he stated. In both hands were plastic bags.
“No, it's just that...” John trailed off again. “The house is pretty big...y'know with just Rosie and me. A bit empty. And she's here often enough as is and unless Mrs Hudson was thinking about renting out my old room here...I was just thinking maybe we could...um...move in.”
my car.” Sherlock ignored him. “Couldn't believe I had done that! I tried to break into my own car and probably looked like an idiot in front of everyone.” Sherlock kept his gaze to the ground. Greg kept on rambling, not caring whether or not Sherlock paid any attention to him. What he wanted was to just visit Sherlock, to just let him know he wasn't as alone as he thought. That if he wasn't so stubborn, he could reach out for help and someone would take his hand. Sherlock didn't seem touched by the sudden visit, but Sherlock rarely looked appreciative over anything. “Did I mention I got a cat? Well I'm babysitting a cat. My sister's gonna be out of town for some time and she wanted me to look after it. I'm not much of a cat person, but I don't mind this guy. We keep to ourselves and I like that...”
And of course, the main factor behind the exaggerations and blaming Mary was one emotion everyone feels from time to time: jealousy. Sherlock admitted he loved John and now with Mary back in the picture, it only made sense for Sherlock to feel jealous. It made sense for jealous to cloud his judgement, to make him believe she was up to something sinister when she really wasn't.
“I'm going to ask you to do something. You can say no. But I was wondering if you would be willing to meet Mary – in a public area – to talk. Not about this, but about something else, and see if you could notice anything strange about her. Anything suspicious. If you're willing.”
John took in a deep breath through his nose. “Little things, I guess. Some days I notice she didn't wear her wedding ring. One day she just about lost it when Eleanor started playing with her purse. Said there was something in there she didn't want Eleanor getting at. I thought maybe she had some hard candy in there, something Eleanor could swallow or expensive makeup she could ruin.”
“You've had time to mourn, now it's time to move on. Leave him be. It's not as though he'll get better.”
“But that's what I am to you.” Her voice was heavy as she was finally saying things she had been keeping pent-up for years. She knew how silly she always looked when she had a crush on Sherlock, trying to go after a man who showed no interest in her. Some probably thought her crush was childish, but what she felt was real at the time. She learned over the years that Sherlock might have had feelings for John, not for her and accept that.
Sherlock hid his look of disappointment and pocketed the box as he resumed his chair. When he was seated, he leaned over the bed to place a kiss on John's dry lips. John's heart rate monitor spiked.
“Yes,” Sherlock said again, ready to hire a moving truck on the spot. “Stay as long as you need to.”
Sherlock gazed at her, taking in every feature. Her nose, her lips, her soft skin. Eleanor seemed less interested in Sherlock by the minute and soon drifted off to sleep, the blanket still in her mouth.
The past month had been rough between them. Nearly having sex in a hotel room really put a gap in their relationship. John refused to talk to Sherlock and even text him, ashamed of what he did. That he kissed Sherlock and let things go as far as they had. Sherlock had avoided contact with John, unsure where their friendship stood.
John shrugged. “Well if we're going to...” he cleared his throat, “I'd at least want to do it...right, I guess.”
“Hmm.” To Sherlock, their relationship felt forced. Something had wedged between them, but he wasn't entirely sure what.
The fic didn't get forgotten or anything, I've just been very busy with schoolwork but now that school is done* I should hopefully be updating on a weekly basis again.
John shook his head. “Still don't know where the gun is. I went about her things, trying to find it when I found the envelope.”
John's hotel room was basic. It had a bed, desk, television, radiator and attached bathroom, but none of it was overly thrilling. Beige carpet, beige walls, beige bedsheets. John placed his suitcase on the bed and frowned as it sunk into the mattress.
“It's very okay,” Sherlock replied. The thought of having John and Rosie in the same flat as him made it feel brighter already. “When do you plan on moving in? Getting are your things over here?”
Lights in the nearby houses were being turned on as the commotion continued outside. Police sirens wailed in the distance. Still the man ran as fast as he could, stepping in cold puddles that dampened his shoes. The neighbourhood was a grid so he could find his way out. Just run straight down this street and he'd out. And beyond the neighbourhood was a small park. In the dark it'd be easy enough to find a hiding spot in a tree and the cops would give up the chase.
"Where are you?" John asks, with a sigh, as he swings his legs out of bed and hunts for a pair of pants to put on.
"That includes you, by the way," Mycroft says. "Sherlock's mentally fragile, though he'll deny it, damn pride he has. I trust you John. You're a good person, I know. But I won't allow Sherlock to be hurt. Is that clear?"
Mycroft didn't mention anything about working late, or going anywhere. But when does he? Sherlock's grown accustomed to being alone in the house, often for several nights at a time. Honestly, he prefers it that way. Why Mycroft is around there are rules, when he's alone he has free reign. Not that he sticks to Mycroft's rules anyway, but when he's by himself, at least he doesn't get read the riot act for putting his feet up on the couch. And he isn't subjected to lectures about his school attendance or punctuality or any of that
