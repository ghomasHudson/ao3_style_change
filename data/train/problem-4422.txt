“Bet me.”
Cas lays back on the bed, stretching his body out in a provocative display designed to entice. “I would be fine with that.”
Dean watches every micro-expression to guide his next words. “I hadn’t planned to stay, but…”
Dean waits patiently for him to begin. “I thought that when you found us, you would choose to leave with Sam. That you would leave me.” He finishes so quietly that Dean almost loses the words.
“You?” Cas manages, adrenaline and panic coursing through his veins. Dean nods his head with wicked glee.
“How, Cas? Have you been following me all this time? Did you drug me?” With each question, he pushes forward, until the officer presses back against him. Cas looks up sorrowfully. Benny is behind him now, trying to pull while the officer pushes.
Cas drains his glass and stands. Dean feels his easy flirting skid headlong into confusion and panic. Did he say something wrong? It dawns on him that Cas is still a tabula rasa for him. He doesn’t know enough about him to read his cues. He has to fix this. He can’t let Cas leave. Dean is still reeling as his body turns when his legs are jerked to the side and held open, effectively forcing him to straddle Cas’s legs when he steps between them.
“I know you’re at work, but I wanted to see if we could talk later. I owe you a huge apology and an explanation.”
Cas raps his knuckles against the door of his office, even though it is open. Dean looks up at his tense face like he’s a mirage. They’ve hardly had a minute together in days, and it is unreasonably good to see him. His body immediately sags in relief. “You don’t need to knock, Cas. It’s your house.”
Dean knows that there isn’t any dishonesty in his words because he can feel it. He runs his fingertips over Cas’s jaw, and he is intrigued to find that he feels that, too. A shiver runs down his back as he considers the possibilities of this completed bond. What else can he feel?
Dean huffs out on a shy grin. “You know that I would have chosen you. I never could have stayed away forever.”
Cas slows his pace, quietly enjoying the unfettered pleasure on Dean’s face, watching him come apart within Cas’s reach. If he’s beautiful normally, Dean is worthy of worship like this. Cas can feel his obsession growing, slipping out of his control. He had expected to have to work for weeks to weaken the man’s resolve. Instead, he barely had to breathe against it. It makes him itch to see how far he can push Dean, and how much he’s willing to give.
Under him, Dean closes his eyes and whispers, “Jesus, Cas.”
Cas nods. “Not intentionally, but yeah. I self-destructed.”
“Bossy.”
Cas’s jaw drops. “Judith. That’s amazing, but that piece is too personal. It isn’t for sale.”
Cas watches his face for a moment and then, decision made, tells him to make a left down Broadway. For the next few minutes, Cas navigates. They end up in a narrow parking lot behind an old tenement house. Even under his watchful eye, Dean’s face never slips into judgement, never seems to be uncomfortable with the ramshackle surroundings. “She’ll be safe here,” Cas feels like he has to declare.
Looking over his shoulder, Cas meets his eye with blue flames already burning. “It will be my pleasure,” he teases in a deep rumble.
By the time Dean is through with his recap, Cas is home and laying down in bed with his sketch book. “Mills says hello, by the way.”
“Under fire?” Dean shakes his head vigorously. “No, Cas. You’ve got me all wrong. I’m not condemning you for anything. I admire you, actually.”
Dean swallows around the vise grip of fear. He tries for bravado. “Sounds like someone’s bitter about being cast aside.”
*****
Without waiting for the younger man’s reply, he stalks out of the bathroom. It takes Dean a few moments to catch up.
“What is 911?”
At least Luke sounds amused beneath his reprimand. Wait. Bodies? Castiel struggles to prop himself up on his elbows to survey the expanse of his bed. He recognizes Inias and Hester, but he can’t seem to recall the other two. When the man rolls to his side so his face becomes visible, Castiel smiles, remembering how enthusiastic the dark-haired guard, whatever his name is, had turned out to be. Hester owes him a huge favor for enticing the young man into their play. He tilts his head to the side, considering.
“We’ll talk about that in a minute. We’re just trying to figure out what happened to him. Was he shot?”
“I love you, too, baby,” Cas purrs softly.
“Why not?”
He chuckles in response. “Several, actually. One of the perks of not having to travel conventionally is that I can get to remote and secluded places where others can not.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. That was insensitive of me.”
Cas knows what Dean is going to say, what he has to say. He tried to deny that it was coming, but here it is. This is the moment that ends the best thing he’s ever had in his life.
Cas turns back to Dean, his nostrils flared and seeing red. “I need to talk to you alone.”
“Holy shit,” Dean whispers and wanders into the soaring living area. The wall is all window, glass as far up and over as he can see, so there is nothing at all to disturb the image.
Castiel watches the look of longing on Dean’s face while he stares out the large windows. “Maybe, but I’m going to do it. Will you help me?”
Dean hands it over with a smile and a wink and gets back to Claire’s questions. Smug bastard.
“Yes,” he agrees. “Gods, yes, Dean.”
“Oh shit. Cas, I didn’t know. I-”
He isn’t sure how long he’s been here, how long his freedom has been revoked. The physical symptoms of being separated from Castiel are worse than ever before, and the doctors have definitely noticed. With every new and worsening symptom, they up the dosage of medication. Even in his Thorazine-like haze, he can understand how ridiculous their plan is. Doesn’t the old saying go, ‘The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.’? And he’s the one who’s locked up.
Dean hugs him close and kisses the top of his head. “You’re already forgiven, Cas.”
Dean doesn’t miss that his nickname is not welcome. “Matei will be with us. Just as he was this morning.”
Dean is teasing, but Cas tackles the question in earnest. He tilts his head on the pillow that they are sharing. It shouldn’t be cute, but it makes Dean smile. Cas slides a warm hand to the side of Dean’s face in a tender caress. His eyes close as he leans in. He takes immense comfort in this man’s presence.
“His men did not fight for him?”
He stands and makes his apologies, “I’m sorry to have bothered you.”
“Yes, it would be.” Dean admits as he takes the opportunity to kiss along the length of Cas’s neck while it’s right there in his reach.
Cas lavishes wet kisses all the way down his abdomen while gripping him tightly around the back and hips. It is all Dean can do to keep his hands to himself. He keeps lifting them, only to force them back to his sides. Both of them are fisted in the fabric of his jeans now, which Cas notices as he pops the button open. “Having trouble, sweetheart?”
“You deserved so much better, Castiel. You are an extraordinary young man, and I’m so proud of who you have chosen to become in spite of your circumstances.”
“Seals?” he asks ignorantly, now looking for ways to heighten their response.
Cas runs the towel over his hair to soak up the excess from their afternoon dip while Dean brings in a stack of paper that they had left in the car. Eager to share their found treasure, they sit at the rustic table and huddle together.
“We were in a tent. It’s camping.”
He’s shaking his head, too focused on his delusions to listen to Dean. “You don’t know that. You don’t know what the future holds.”
Scoffing, Dean rolls his eyes. “Why, because I want to be here with you?”
“No, I’m just an average American college student,” Dean denies, trying to look away from his honesty.
Suddenly, what Cas wants to do makes complete sense. He nods and pulls his shirt over his head without another thought. He catches the shiver that runs through Cas as he reveals his skin. Never one to be body shy, Dean flicks his eyes up to hold his after he drops the shirt on the ground, running his hands over himself.  Lazily, he pops the button on his jeans and stalks towards Cas. “How are you going to paint me?”
“You’re in good hands, Cas. If anyone can keep you out of prison, it’s him.”
Dean scoffs. “Fuck no. I learned my lesson the first time. No more open drinks. We ordered bottled beer and then poured it into mugs.”
*****
The man sputters, “Oh, he-he'll be right as rain, I’m sure.”
“Earning respect takes time. It’s a slow process.”
Dean’s brow furrows. “No.”
When they part, Dean is panting, too. His omega mate is trying to devour him with his mouth and hands. He feels the sting of scratches that Cas left during this first orgasm.
His phone rings again and again. Always Cas. Dean’s head is throbbing. Whatever Michael dosed him with makes for a nasty hangover. He hopes that Cas finds him soon. If Michael gets him out of this building, he might never be found.
Dean tilts his head, gob smacked. “This is Cas, Sam. I’ve been telling you about him for months.”
“Butter you up? Is that another of your ridiculous American idioms?”
“This. This is all I want,” Dean whispers as he kisses down Cas’s jaw.
Dean wipes a hand over his mouth and jaw and paces. His eyes dart from one place to another as he wanders.
“You are good student,” Yevgeny brushes off the praise humbly. “It is easy to teach you.”
“Do you remember when we were out here, and you told me about your sexual experience?”
Cas growls when he lets go of Dean this time. He was as lost in that scenario as Dean seemed to be. He’s never had possessive tendencies and definitely not like this. Cas is very pleased that the idea of fucking didn’t make Dean pull away. That was risky, though. Come inflation is not exactly tiptoeing into kinky thoughts. The words had the desired effect, but he needs to get a grip not just on Dean, but on himself as well.
He’s been here at Jimmy’s house for a couple of hours now under the guise of doing the extermination. Jimmy stayed home from work so that he could have access to the house, which is also a ruse. He’s actually using the time to hunt for clues as to why people are watching him. Dean’s fairly sure that it’s because of whatever took Cas away from him, but Jimmy isn’t ready to hear that yet. He’s pushing hard enough with what he is saying. Even though it seems obvious to Dean that Cas’s death was engineered and this identity of Jimmy Novak is completely fake, it’s a stretch for the other man to hear.
Each page holds a revelation. There are photo-realistic portraits, intricate abstracts, elegant cityscapes, and chaotic battle scenes. He tries not to touch, but his fingers are aching to brush over some of them, to partake of their beauty with more than just his eyes. He’s looking directly into Cas’s mind, seeing the way he perceives the world, and it’s utterly enthralling. This man wears a prickly mask on the outside to keep people away, but he doesn’t hide a thing in his art. His thoughts, pain, fears, and dreams are laid out on these pages as truly as if he had shed blood on them, drenched them in his tears. Dean finds himself getting choked up as he turns the pages, unveiling the layers of Castiel.
“It’s obviously something very important in your present?”
Dean didn’t focus on that magical spot for long. He’d just wanted to give Cas a taste. Even when Cas begged for more, Dean told him that it was too much all at once. Considering he’d never felt even a finger in his ass before last night, and Dean has close to a decade of experience, he didn’t push too hard.
He looks horrified when Dean merely nods his agreement and looks away from them both.
“Yes, of course.”
Dean agrees and Chuck turns serious. “Son, are you ready to enter into this eternal commitment?”
Cas and Dean have to work to fit each other into their daily lives, but normal doesn't stay normal for long.
Unzipping the tent quietly to grab the provisions pack, his eyes drift over to Cas. In the dark, there are too many shadows to see clearly, but he can tell he’s still wearing all of his clothes. Those jeans aren’t going to be comfortable to sleep in, but he’s not going to risk waking him up now. He’ll wait until he joins his fretful husband later when he’s fully asleep and won’t wake up as easily.
Cas stretches himself out over Dean, staying up on his elbows and toes to keep his weight off of his boyfriend. Dean smirks and pulls him down to rest on top of his body. His hands wander everywhere he can reach, and he admits, “I like your weight on me, especially when you’re skin is so warm.”
“You try my patience.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s because of the emotional and physical strain you’re put under.”
*****
Cas licks into his mouth, partly to seal their agreement, partly because he can’t help himself. Dean’s sweetness is his own personal brand of heaven, and he’s been starving for it since they parted over a week ago. Feeling Dean’s hands grip him tightly, his mind shifts over to the thought that’s been consuming him for days.
“What are the odds?” he asks, intensity focused entirely on the man in front of him.
“Yes.” Dean rests the phone against his temple, mentally steeling himself for saying the words out loud. “Do you remember me telling you about Cas?”
He’s anxious to get inside of Dean, to revel in his heat. At the same time, watching Dean melt into him with this first touch is addictive. Having Dean in his lap gives him a front row seat to witness his pleasure, his desire, and Cas wants it to go on forever.
If anyone else had said those words to Cas, he would have thought them trite and insincere, and possibly punched them in the face. Looking into Dean’s eyes, though, he can feel his earnestness. Dean is proud of him. Dean loves him and wants what is best for him. It still amazes Cas that anyone cares, let alone the man he’s sharing his life with now. It’s surreal.
Cas flashes his teeth in a dangerous grin. “That would be my preference for all occasions.”
Vozlyublennaya: sweetheart
“The feeling is entirely mutual.”
The creature smiles at him but shakes his head.
“To your cell.”
As he scrubs his skin, he continues his pep talk. He will not destroy his academic career because of this insanity with Cas. He can’t. He’s worked too hard, and he’s too close to the end. Besides, that’s never been his way. He’s never lost himself in relationships; he’s too focused on his future career. This won’t be any different.
Cas laughs out loud. He pulls out and taps Dean’s hip to get him to turn over.
Dean finds out what Cas has been up to, which leads to both touch and untouch(ed).
“You weren’t worried about that. You were concerned that your temper could be problematic.”
“I’m sorry, let’s try again.”
“I’m not embarrassed, Dean, but I am very aware that my choices aren’t conventional. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve come under fire because of them.”
“Jesus, relax. Dean knows I was just playing, right?”
*****
*****
Dean is salivating at the thought. He can only nod curtly while letting his mind race with his favorite fantasies.
“Can we get something to eat first?” Cas asks quietly. The frailty of his voice terrifies Dean. “I’m so hungry.”
Dean blinks slowly, already hazy in his lust. What were they talking about?
Dean doesn’t react until they are safely inside their room. “Novak, huh?”
“Don’t prep. Just take me.” Dean’s shoulders are tense, his grip on the sink white-knuckled.
“So, opposites?”
"Just one when I was a minor Served time in juvie."
Tears are gathering in the corners of his eyes again, but he manages to get the dreaded words out. “Before you say anything, something else happened last night that I have to confess.”
“I went to the police. They can’t help without more evidence, so I tried to gather enough to get them to look into it.”
“Now, we can play games and pretend that we aren’t dying to fuck each other, or...”
Dean can’t help but laugh at his outrage. He takes a few steps back to keep himself out of striking distance. Cas is rolling storm clouds and raging wind. The look in his eyes promises retribution.
“Have you? Done that?”
“Ready, Dean?”
‘Oh, damn,’ Dean thinks. ‘He did not like that comment one little bit.’
In the next sentences, he picks up the impression that the man is a church elder and that Cas is trying to convince him to move the sacred icons to another location. The following exchange shifts again, and he can understand them completely.
Cas’s jaw is set, his eyes blazing, but he doesn’t deny what Dean is saying. Dean knows enough about Cas to know that trying to touch him right now might earn him a black eye. Instead, he drops his own eyes and says, “It hurts, Cas. I want what we had. Will you please forgive me?”
“I can’t believe you bested an Unseelie today,” Cas mentions as Dean feeds him a bite of a pastry. He is reclined on his side, the cushion arranged to make the position comfortable.
“Now, Dean,” Cas’s firm tone belies the smile on his lips.
Dean clears a large spot on an outcropping of rocks and lays a thick layer of blankets and furs on it. Cas, as usual, has thought of every detail. It is almost as cozy as their bed, but the view is much more picturesque. Jutting out over the water, it appears as if they are resting on the lake beneath them, and the entire mountain range stands in front of them. Spectacular, rugged beauty.
With every statement, Bart’s grip tightens on his body. As soon as he brings up Dean’s name, Bart shouts in his native language. He lays himself over Cas’s back, snapping fury and hideous intention in his tone.
Cas watches Dean carefully and decides he can push a little more. Directly into his ear he whispers, “When she returns, you are going to get up and head towards the elevators. I’ll be right behind you. When we get back to our room, I want you naked in my lap while you feed me the rest of our meal. Agreed?”
Dean groans, but it turns into a growl of need. “You tempt me beyond reason, Omega.”
When the period ends, Dean goes into the kitchen for another beer. He hasn’t thought about his stalker throughout the game, so he shouldn’t give in to the temptation to look out the kitchen windows. It will just start the cycle all over again. He should just go back into the living room and watch the commentary until the game begins again. He takes a few steps away and stops. His feet feel like lead. He just can’t make himself continue. He’s calling his traitorous legs all sorts of vicious names, but they will not move forward. Not without checking the windows again. He rolls his eyes and gives in. Whatever. He’s weak. If he looks, then he can see nothing is there and he can go back to watching the game in peace.
“Help me with my wings?”
“Cas,” he corrects. “Normally I don’t pay attention to the clean-cut type. Too much trouble. But-” Cas pops the ‘b’ dramatically. “There’s something about you...”
The next morning, they take the car to the closest place that they can reach by road and then start off on their hike to the GPS coordinates. Dean packed a survival pack because the destination is miles into the forest and who knows what could happen. They head out at first light, anxious to find out what Cas left for them.
To anyone that didn’t know the prince, they would simply look like a small squad of soldiers. That is, until you looked closely. There’s no way that anyone could miss his regal bearing, his arrogant intelligence, or his assumption of obedience, if they paid attention.
“Yes, well, it is Wallachian tradition,” he sniffs haughtily before giving in to laughter.
They will wake up together, cuddled into a tangle. They will give each other sleepy blow jobs and fuck lying on their sides with their eyes still closed. They will get off on just letting their bodies rub together in a hundred different positions.
“Fuck off.”
*****
Dean is Cas’s ideal; masculine and strong with beautiful features. Most importantly, he is kind, wickedly smart, funny, and adventurous. Granted, he knows these things about the 15 year old version of Dean, but he can’t have changed that much, right? That’s another thing; they already have a shared past. He knows, and adores, Dean’s family. They are-
Things are decidedly not looking up. Cas can barely keep his eyes open even after the cups of coffee that Dean has managed to get into him. He finds that he has a newfound respect for the pioneers. Making coffee over a fire is trying at best.
Cas looks back and forth between them and rolls his eyes. “I need to grab some things.”
Without hearing the answer from Lebedev, he sees assent around the room in nodding heads.  “I think that if this group is responsible for even one attack on a bank that carries Solntsevskaya money, it is an attack on the brotherhood and cannot pass.”
Cas and Dean both startle away from each other at her voice, Dean looking sheepish, Cas...not so much. The wolfish leer teases as he chides, “You should have been a little more specific, Meg.”
Such an innocuous question. In any other moment, it would sound caring, concerned. Now, though? It sounds like the threat of danger, imminent and real.
“There are a lot of ways to end that sentence, and none of them are good. Just in case, okay?”
Mills drops her pen. “Mr. Novak, are you really here because you saw Boyar looking at a guy?”
“I am pining for someone. We are at odds with each other right now, but I have no interest in anyone else.”
Cas traces the line of his jaw all the way to his temple. “Yes. Eventually, we’ll be able to fully communicate telepathically.”
Cas shakes his head. “No. I won’t take advantage of you like that.”
Cas matches his breathing to Dean’s, and they stand there caught in the sweet cocoon of their exhales and thumping hearts.
“Why would you do that, Dean? You’ve never stolen a thing in your life. I just don’t understand what’s going on with you.”
Dean slams his head into the pillow, growling his frustration. Cas raises an eyebrow in surprise. This is the first time all day that Dean hasn’t been completely compliant with what Cas asks of him. After some of the things that he’s done to and with him, it’s interesting that this is the point where Dean is losing his composure. Perhaps it’s just that. He’s been so obedient that he just can’t be anymore.
“Not much. Trash-talk, mostly.”
At that moment, their bottle of lube, Dean’s hairbrush, and Cas’s black belt hit the bed one by one, right in Dean’s line of sight. Fuck. Seeing the implements of pain make everything more real, more imminent. Dean sighs and dips his back into a lower arch, trying to tempt Cas to get started.
Hovering over Dean’s body, he kisses him before he lets his weight drop to cover him. Even touching him everywhere from head to feet isn’t quite enough. He needs skin. After a few lush kisses that fill his mind with desires he is anxious to recreate, he rolls off of him.
“Hmm?”
As days go by without any answers, his frustration knows no bounds. His temper is like a spark on a powder keg. Dean can see that the longer he sits helpless, the more damage is being done. Cas is hollowed out, becoming a shell of what he once was.
*****
“Yeah, I found a research room.” Dean grins to see Cas looks up sharply.
Cas wants to kiss his temple, just brush his lips against him sweetly, like they’ve done a hundred times. It stings to remind himself that he can’t. Not now. Having this stolen moment together is going to have to be enough.
“There are more interesting ways I’d like to pin you down, Dean.” Cas promises, and just like that, they are both in a completely different headspace.
And then there’s Balthazar. The man isn’t happy unless he’s the axis upon which all of his friends turn, and he seems to have taken a vested interest in Cas becoming one of his celestial bodies in orbit. Dean keeps a lid on his jealousy because he trusts his husband, and only an insecure person makes problems where there aren’t any. It’s obvious though, that in Dean’s absence, Balthazar had been making some assumptions.
Dean’s out of words. There’s too much space between them. Too many unknowns. He just wants Cas to be touching him, and he doesn’t know how to make that transition. Thankfully, Cas does. He pushes off the door and approaches quickly. He tangles a hand in Dean’s hair, reeling him in. He goes willingly. When their lips finally meet again, Dean’s knees want to give with relief. He huffs out a desperate sound as the feel of Cas’s tongue rubs against his bottom lip, feeling immediately overcome.
Worry etched on his face, Cas smoothes a hand over Dean’s jaw. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
He rolls his hips along the hard line of Cas’s erection, trying to encourage him to take over. It never takes him long to wrest the reins from Dean’s hands, so the quicker he relinquishes them, the quicker they will get to the main event.
*****
But there’s no way Cas could watch him slog through years of being beaten, cursed at, and used for the most grueling labor. There’s not a chance in hell he would allow him to be raped. Not when he can so easily prevent it all.
Cas kisses his forehead, “Of course it does. You’re making yourself vulnerable.”
“Okay. So…talk.”
“It must have been hard to pass up such a lucrative life,” Dean admires. “I doubt the alternatives were easy.”
Dean grins. “I’ll bet you could name ten things, off the top of your head, that Gabe has said to you that are creepier than that.”
“Yes, a terrible shame,” Alex snaps back louder.
Dean gives him a dopey grin. “That was...I don’t have words. I think you melted my brain, Cas.”
“You taste so sweet, Dean. I want more,” Cas pleads, madness at the edges.
Rolling his eyes and backing away with a muttered curse, Dean grabs his clothes from the bed and pulls them on with agitation.
Dean swallows hard and sets his jaw. He can barely get out the words, “I can’t. Not…yet.”
Cas fidgets with his fingers. “Dean, I’ve been a complete ass. I’m the one who should be apologizing. You’re this mystical being whose job it is to protect the natural world, and I’ve been ignoring all signs of it and treating you like any other human so that I didn’t have to think about how different we are.”
“Am I going to have to pour you into the elevator later?”
“Sorry, tell me more.”
Dean’s ire drops in favor of concern. His brow furrows as he listens.
“In what order?”
Enjoy! As always, comments and kudos are marvelous.
“This is a delicate situation.”
As Dean explains their surroundings, Cas can’t help reaching out to make contact with him. As soon as he touches one of Dean’s arms, the rest of them wind around him, stroking and sucking along his skin in an almost loving way. Cas tries to give all of his tentacles equal attention, but it becomes impossible to even recognize which ones he’s already touched when they are all in constant motion.
“Nice,” Dean sneers. “He ropes you into something he knew you didn’t want to do, and then he leaves you there to deal with the fallout. Fucking stand up guy, that one.”
Sweat drips into his eyes, his lungs are sawing as if they’re about to give up trying to pump oxygen back into his depleted cells, and Cas still can’t make himself pull out of Dean’s body. Looking down at the sated mess of a man beneath him fills him with pride and satisfaction. He loves this man enough to make him panic on a regular basis. Tonight, though, he allows his heart and mind to enjoy the pleasure of loving him.
“To prep?”
Cas easily switches over into English, his tone and demeanor transitioning silkily. “I apologize. We forgot something very important. I need to speak to my lieutenant for just a moment and then we’ll be on our way.”
Dean takes a huge bite of a flaky pastry and considers his answer. Cas waits with unending patience.
Dean’s happiness catches like a struck match, the light sparking in his eyes first, and spreading through his body like dry tinder.
“Tell me, Cas.”
“Cas, I have a hundred things to do before-”
“Shut up.” Dean finishes dressing and grabs his shower kit.
Dean shakes his head while Cas cups his erection outside of his loose gym shorts. “But you do now, though, don’t you?”
Without warning, a brutal, intense pain stabs at the back of Dean’s skull, causing him to call out. He curls up on himself, both hands in his hair to try to block the agony.
“Then earn it,” Cas snaps at him.
Dean is overcome. Cas has him in a stranglehold, but it is pure bliss. The heat of Cas’s body sends a wave of flames over his skin. Dean feels a bead of sweat trickle at his temple. He is panting out breathy curses before Cas is fully seated. Nothing has ever felt this good, this right.
“It’s my pleasure, Cas. I’m glad you liked it.”
“You were never my prisoner. I’ve told you this before, Cas. I brought you here because you were so alone and I could feel your pain. I wanted to be your companion.”
Dean clears his throat and turns over, kneeling in between Cas’s splayed legs. “Will you marry me?”
Cas knows by the quiet, unassuming way that Dean walks into their loft, hours earlier than anticipated, that something is wrong. He drops his palette on the table and comes down the stairs at a jog.
Cas holds Dean’s hips and bucks up against him while he strokes them to completion. Dean sighs at the additional friction behind his balls.
Dean tilts his chin up and replies clearly, “I love him.”
“I’ve arrived dressed appropriately on my last two visits. It’s worth a shot. What do I do?”
Dean’s mouth on his hard, impatient cock is his kryptonite, and Cas sucks in a harsh breath at the feeling. He practically whimpers when Dean sucks and licks the head into the tight O of his lips. The pressure and wetness of his mouth are outstanding, greatly surpassing all of his vivid memories.
“What’s wrong?” he asks as Dean pulls his head down for a kiss. Dean tries to put all of his overflowing emotion into the kiss. The urgency of his need must convey, because Cas begins moving again, even while the kiss goes on. This time, Dean moves with him. His hips roll, his hands push and pull, his teeth nip. If he’s going to burst into flames, he wants Cas right there with him.
Under his breath so that even Fae ears can’t eavesdrop, Dean smirks. “Relax. I’m not going to give you trouble. Just talk to me.”
He has enough difficulty trying to understand some humans. An image of Dean flashes to mind. His extreme reliance on pop culture allusions makes their communication a struggle on the best of days.
“Fun?” Still with the commander voice, but he can’t hide his intrigue.
“I should have known that you’d try to handle me with kid gloves,” he grouses. “God forbid fragile Castiel have to deal with hard truths.”
“Not really, no,” he snaps.
Cas nods again. “He deserves a lot better than me.”
Cozied up on Dean’s couch, Cas is having some severely inappropriate thoughts. Actually, they’re memories of the last time he was here. His dick is filling in interest just remembering the things they’ve done to each other on this couch. Or in front of the couch. Or leaning against it. Damn.
Dean turns and smiles just as they pull up to Cas’s building. Well, their building now. When Cas holds the door open for Dean, he strides through and forces himself not to come to a halt by what he sees. The lobby is easily three stories tall, filled with sculptures, lush green plants, and radiant gold fixtures. Even wearing the suit pants and shirt that Cas had picked out for him, he feels under-dressed for such a place.
Thanks for reading!
Dean chuckles deep in his chest. “I said you owe me big, not that you weren’t going to enjoy it.”
Oh, that absolute bastard. Cas glares daggers at the man who grins and winks back.
Gabe does something he’s never dared to do before. He smacks the back of Cas’s neck hard enough to hear above the crowd in the bar. Cas turns to him with his teeth set on edge and violence in his eyes.
Cas huffs out a laugh. “It’s all uncomfortable as hell. This section under the roses is going down to cover my wrist in almost solid black, and there isn’t much muscle to pad it. It’s all bone and tendon-”
Sam takes a few deep breaths to corral his frustration. “So, what did you find out?”
The hair on Castiel’s neck stands on end. The words slither into his ears, unwelcome. “I appreciate your concern, but I must intervene here.”
“What? Why?”
This is exactly what he wants for them both, but the joy is laced with unadulterated pain to glimpse their burgeoning relationship when everything else about them is fractured.
A loud boom comes from inside the building across the street. The building his friends are currently trying to rob. He’d recognize that sound anywhere. It was a shotgun blast, and Gabe and Cole just have small hand guns.
Lifting Cas from the sand, Dean takes his hand and lets him lead them home. Silence between them is filled with peace. Their love for each other fills up every corner of their minds.
“Want to start now?” Dean’s eyes slide hungrily over Cas’s body, innuendo heavy in his voice.
Next chapter:
That’s...unfathomable. Dean’s face registers shock. He can’t wrap his head around a century, let alone millennia. At least it answers the immortality question.
As Cas is backing away, Dean reminds him, “I’m going over to the church to pick up the equipment for the baseball game tomorrow, but I’ll be back before you’re done.”
“My thoughts exactly, but can I see what you painted first?”
Cas gives him a harsh slap on the ass, just to make it bounce, and an unrepentant look. “I have to keep you on your toes somehow.”
Dean’s body leans closer without his knowledge, caught in the images Cas is cultivating. His brow furrows to offset the intense desire. His palm pushes against his erection to displace that ache, too.
“Christ. I am a lucky man.” Cas praises and drops a hand into Dean’s hair to fondle the soft strands.
“I try to abstain when I’m not…” Dean trails off, not wanting to offend the prince.
“I wasn’t trying to get rid of you. You know that. I was only giving you a choice.”
The storeroom is nicer than he would have thought, more of an employee lounge than just dry storage. There is an worn-in leather couch, which Dean eyes for its multiple possibilities. He paces, rubs anxious hands down his face. Damn, he is on edge. It feels like twenty minutes have passed. Where the hell is Cas? He is just starting to tip over into doubt when the door finally opens.
“No. It’s not like that. Cas was worried about this Boyar guy, so he was looking after me.”
“No, this is my personal home.”
Războinic= warrior (Cas's horse)
Cas grits his teeth. “If I say that I saw it happen, then you can do something?”
Cas isn’t in the Council Room. He isn’t in his chambers. He isn’t in the observatory.
Dean isn’t sure what to say to Grigore, if anything at all. He is discomfited by the thought that this man saw him and Cas together in an intimate moment. Dean isn’t sure why he didn’t think through that obvious repercussion of having a relationship with Cas. It seems so obvious now and he can't stop thinking about it. The castle is run by a team of servants. Every part of Castiel’s day is handled by others. Of course people would catch them kissing, and probably worse. That has Dean’s stomach roiling as his face blanches. Everyone in the castle would know, and because of his title, so would the entire country.
Maybe it’s simply because he’s submitting to Dean’s request, but this innocuous act of removing a shirt is suddenly the sexiest thing Dean’s ever seen. Cas drops the shirt in Dean’s lap and leans over for a brief, but blistering, kiss. “Damn,” Dean sighs when Cas stands up again, addled by how well Cas plays him.
Cas pulls back and grabs a box of tissues. Silently they clean up and Dean straightens his clothes. He can still taste the faint hint of vodka from Cas’s mouth, and his brain is starting to seize up on him. He clears his throat, but Cas beats him to the punch.
“Why are you doing this? What do you want?” Castiel pleads as the incredibly strong man carries him over the rocks and towards the water. He can’t really mean to go swimming with a prisoner, can he?
Dean whispers brokenly, “Fuck, Cas. We’re both...”
Dean sighs and rolls his eyes. Cas snatches his jaw and forces him to make eye contact. Low and deep, he warns, “Pokazhi mne uvazheniye!” (Show me respect!)
Dean huffs a laugh. “Well, I’m safe in a way. I’m in a hospital.”
“I want you, Cas. So much,” Dean purrs as he snakes his limbs around Cas’s body. His lips caress Cas’s, begging for entry. The angel relents, having no reason to ever deny Dean. As their mouths tangle together, though, Cas feels that there’s something he’s not catching.
“Not if you value your life, dorogoy.”
Dean runs a finger down the bridge of his nose, and Cas swats him while making a petulant scowl.
“That’s all you, Cas,” Dean reminds him and he is greeted with another loud moan.
Watching Castiel from across the encampment, Dean can’t help but smile. The angel is revered here. The Fae fawn over him, pushing and shoving to jockey for position when he is amongst them. One of the younger Fae, a winged variety, shows off for the angel by turning in haphazard circles in the air.
The shock makes the entire scene surreal, but his eyes fill with matching tears. He’s nodding and pulling Cas up to his feet to wrap him in his arms. “Yes, Cas. One hundred percent, yes.”
Of course he will come back eventually. He wouldn’t have built up so many supplies in a temporary shelter, right? So, it’s up to Cas to keep things running. He needs the heat, and he needs a way to cook, so…fire. Groaning at the throbbing in his fingertips, he pushes himself up to sitting.
“Oh, Castiel,” she huffs in annoyance. “Your piece was spectacular, but just like you, it wouldn’t be appreciated by just anyone. You aren’t trying to reach the average patron. You’re more exotic than that.”
“Ready for what, sweetheart?”
Cas sighs and rubs a hand over his eyes. “I don’t know. Mikhail has not ordered me back yet, but it won’t be longer than a few months.”
“Does this island have a name?” Dean asks as they leave the beach for the edge of the jungle.
The pulsing of Dean’s cock pushes against Cas’s and it’s so kinky and debauched to feel his boyfriend come in his own ass that it pushes Cas over the edge. With both of them taking up so much space, there’s really no place for their come to go but out, and Cas gets a front row seat to see it gush out between thrusts. Watching the thick white come drip down on the bright pink skin of Dean’s abused ass makes Cas twitch with renewed interest.
“Stop. I was wrong. Go in again,” Cas commands on a shaky breath.
Cas doesn’t have to wait long before the questions start. Dean processes things in a predictable, but logical way. He examines something, looks at all of its facets, and then decides where to categorize it. Simple, objective, and so much more effective than the melodrama and deception he’s used to.
Their conversation is cut short when the rest of the royal court arrives with almost deafening fanfare. Dean sits higher on his knees to watch their entrance, over the top and full of drama as usual. The queen is carried by several men, all of them clothed in the sheer fabric given to slaves. A host of musicians play behind them, and the air is filled with small pixies and sprites who are tossing flower petals and leaves to rain upon her.
“That isn’t even possible.”
For her to take the throne after the spectacle her father, Henry VIII, made about having a male heir was brave. For her to keep the throne for 44 years, despite not marrying and being declared illegitimate, was impressive. What she proceeded to do for the country ushered in a new era of peace and prosperity. To date, she is considered one of the country’s most beloved rulers.
He runs his hands through his hair and lets them fall, defeated. “At first, I just thought I was being paranoid. Then, I wanted to get an idea of what he was up to. From there it just snowballed. After the night club, I wanted to keep you out of it to spite him. I didn’t want to get anything from you, including your fear.”
Cas’s anger wilts.  “It’s not preferable, no. But if the choice is between me or you? It should always be me.”
Dean’s hand moves to cover Cas’s. Not to push it away, but to hold it there. Fuck. This inexperienced man is just naturally sexier than anyone Cas has ever known. He keeps talking, hoping to push him to the edge with his words.
Mid-sentence, Castiel catches a look on Dean’s face that steals his attention. He is standing in crisp parade rest, back stiff and jaw tight. The other man already forgotten except for the briefest of courtesies, Cas withdraws, “If you’ll excuse me, boyar?”
Dean takes the stage with trembling hands, his knees loose. The director explains the scene to Dean as if he knows nothing of the play. Of course he does, because no one outside of the troupe and Shakespeare himself know anything about it yet.
With those words in mind, Dean chooses the next bite of food more carefully. He breaks off a nibble of bread and smears it with rich honey. When he approaches Cas’s mouth this time, he waits for his lips to open in acceptance before gently placing the food on his tongue. Cas sighs happily at this new taste, which brings a feeling of contentment to Dean that he wasn’t expecting.
Cas moans at the sucking sensation of Dean’s lips. “Agreed. Everything else can go to hell.”
There are craggy, volcanic-looking rocks off to the right, covered in layers of seaweed, muscles, and barnacles. In front of them, the waves roll in gently. As the sun gets closer to the horizon, the light gets softer, making the water take on a metallic reflectiveness. Gulls hover in the wind, crying to each other as they search for the next bit of food.
Dean narrowed his gaze. “I never thought I’d see the day when I would have to tell you to be more confident.”
Dean chuckles. “Peak mate rights?”
Cas stops spinning it and looks up at him in awe. “You’re amazing.”
Before Dean can respond in any way, those gorgeous lips meet the tip of his erection. The visual chokes a gasp out of him.
He lets himself think about how differently this night could have gone. He fights back the emotional response, but apparently not well enough.
“His issue is with me, so polite introductions are likely all that will actually involve you.”
“Don’t ask stupid questions, Dean. Of course I want you to be completely you.” Cas lets out an exasperated sigh and runs hands through his hair.
The sounds dripping from Cas’s slack mouth are obscene, pleas and keening that Dean’s never heard before. He’s instantly on the edge and has to take a breath to get his body under control.
Cas searches his face and then takes a chaste kiss. “I think it’s going to be a very long time before I get used to being with you again. I still feel like it’s a dream.”
Dean looks down at his hands. After a thoughtful minute, he clears his throat. “Yeah, I will, uh...I’ll be much more careful.”
Dean pouts, but he agrees. As Cas is walking away, he commands, “Stay right here. I’ll be back in two minutes.”
“I have no idea. What did he say?”
With a subtle shift of his hips, Cas is pressed against him, asking for entrance. Dean splays fingers at the nape of his neck and pulls his head down for a kiss; his entire being, mind, and soul opening to Cas in acceptance. He groans at the wonderful breach, the depth and breadth of Cas invading his body. Cas fucks him slowly, murmuring words of appreciation and praise with every stroke.
“All right, let’s rinse you off.”
There’s a long moment of silence before she finally admits, “I just want to get to know her. She’s likely the only chance I have at a grandchild, and I don’t want to miss out on it.”
Dean blushes a deep red. Cas can’t help the rush of desire that floods him at the sight. Whatever his golden boy has rattling around in his brain, it must be good to receive that kind of instant reaction.
When he's done, Dean pushes his cock into the wider hole, and this time it’s much more relaxed. He slips in almost too easily. Cas is right behind him, barely letting Dean get the head in before he’s nudging him out of the way. It works. The pressure is enough to make Dean’s eyes cross, but Cas uses shallow thrusts to wedge himself in deep. When he bottoms out, they both release groans from the spine.
The smug smirk on Cas’s face needs to be wiped away. Immediately. Dean sets his beer down, eyes not leaving Cas for a second. Climbing into his lap, Dean grinds down with a particularly nasty swivel of his hips. “You know what else I take really well?”
Dean scrutinizes Cas’s face. Finding only honesty there, he nods. Ducking his eyes as he swipes away the unfallen tears, he quietly confesses, “Sorry. I just had a really visceral reaction to that one.”
As soon as Cas’s hand is on him, he feels the pressure building quickly. Dean feels dread as he realizes that if things don’t slow down, it will be over in minutes. He tries to back away from the intense sensations, but there is nowhere to go.
“I definitely want to.” The heat in his eyes makes Dean’s heart skip.
They wander down hallways, make a half dozen turns, and finally they are in the cavernous sanctuary. Cas notices several cameras watching every corner. He has seen banks that were less watched. Paranoia, thy name is the church.
Dean does it exactly as he is told, arching into the touch. He licks his lips and locks his gaze with Cas. A little moan puffs out as he makes contact with that sensitive spot beneath the flared head.
Dean crawls forward, forcing Cas to lay back. He hears the ripple of a wave approaching, and takes Cas’s mouth in a claiming kiss just as it breaks over their heads. Through his thin eyelids, he can see the sparking neon churn around them as they try not to let their laughter break the kiss until the water subsides.
“I’m quite content right where I am for the moment,” Dean promises, which is absolutely true until Cas gets a wicked glint in his eye, disentangles himself, and goes down on his knees in front of him.
“Sam, now isn’t really a good time. Could I take a rain check?”
Careful to keep their conversation private, Dean leans in close to him. “I guess I’m confused about your mission here.”
Dean reaches over and pulls Cas in for a kiss. Against his lips, he apologizes. “I didn’t mean to be dismissive. It’s just sometimes hard to accept kindness. I promise to do better.”
“Hmm. Yeah, no sex work in my future, I suppose,” Dean teases and trails a hand over Cas’s torso, eyeing him like a delectable treat. “Although, we would be blistering hot together on camera, wouldn’t we?”
Cas quickly pulls his fingers out of himself and lets go of his leaking cock. He barely gets himself covered with a blanket when Dean appears with another tall man. His nostrils flare, and his gaze snaps to Cas.
He doesn’t want to kick Sam out, but he does subtly try to hurry him along. He yawns, he brushes his teeth. When Sam does leave, he feels a little shitty at how excited he is. It isn’t because he doesn’t want to spend time with him. It’s only because he knows he’s going to spend time with Cas in one of the historical periods that interests him the most.
“No, Amelia. I don’t remember. That’s exactly the problem.”
“Do you remember that guy I pointed out to you on the basketball court at St. Augustine’s?”
“So then, what do you require?” Dean swallows hard, trying not to let him imagination run wild even while his heartbeat feels like it is shaking his bones. Up to this point, there have been none of Castiel’s typical lustful looks, so perhaps his intentions are not leaning the way Dean assumes.
Leaning into the shower wall, Dean takes himself in hand and strokes. Sighs fall from his lips even as frustration builds in their bond. A queasy wrongness crawls over him as it protests him not being with Castiel. He tries to push it aside, rationalize his need to take the edge off so he can finish his work. That’s the thing about soul bonds, though. You can’t reason with them.
Within fifteen minutes, they find chaos. Thankfully, people are still running around or huddled around makeshift fires. The carriages are the center of the maelstrom, both of them on their sides and broken open like gourds. Dean’s eyes are scanning quickly, taking inventory and assessing. Only a small line of bodies cover the ground, mostly men he doesn’t know, but some wearing his colors, too. He swallows around the lump in his throat. Good men perished here, but for what reason?
Samuel stood up straight and looked around the ship. From his vantage point he couldn’t find his brother. Sam pushed his hair out of his face and he stepped toward the first pirate he saw. They were younger looking and was carrying a tray of meats and cheeses. “I’m sorry to bother you. Have you seen my brother anywhere?”
A tear appeared on Sam’s face and he wiped it away with a hard hand swipe. “I think I have feelings for someone. A person we were told that if we were ever seen with…” Sam swallowed and pulled away from the hug. “I think I am a homosexual.” He dropped his head shamefully, afraid to see the look on his brothers face.
Alfie gaped, “You remembered… Of course you did. You have the best memory out of everyone on the ship. Thank you so much Castiel.” Alfie gave Castiel a hug and rushed off to his own cabin where Adam was holed up, being sick.
Sam pressed his lips against Gabriel’s hair, “It’s already started.”
“It’s the least I could do after you saved me and my brother. But, I think you realize that I got it for you more than just because of that reason.” Dean reached his hand out and touched Castiel’s hand that was holding the necklace. He pulled his hand back before anyone saw and he smiled at the captain before walking away.
Dean blushed and smiled, “I promise I will be back for more steering.” Dean glanced at Castiel before turning to his brother and following him to another part of the ship. “What’s going on Sam?” He placed a hand on his brothers shoulder.
Castiel let his fingers run gently down Dean’s shoulder, slow enough that goosebumps appeared on Dean’s skin.
Castiel looked almost bored, “I give respect to those who deserve it, not ones who threaten or think they are better than others.” Castiel narrowed his eyes at Zachariah and whispered harshly, “If I ever hear of you trying to overthrow me again, I will toss you overboard without a second thought. Either you leave this ship now, or you follow the rules I have made and do your job. You have until sunrise to decide.” With that, Castiel turned away from Zachariah and walked over to Dean and Alfie who were talking about the gifts they bought in port.
Dean put on his boots and made his way out of the cabin, making sure to shut the door quietly as to not wake Castiel. It was still dark, but sunrise was close by. Dean nodded at a few of the pirates he walked by as he made his way to Gabriel’s cabin. Dean knocked softly on the door. He was about to peek in when it opened and Sam looked out from the crack. Sam gave his brother a smile and stepped out of the room and shut the door.
He was still waving his arms when he realized they were still near the Sirens and he cursed under his breath. Those men won’t be able to save Dean and his brother. Not unless they know about mythical creatures.
“Of course I do! This… I am not just using you. I feel something for you Gabriel. I haven’t felt this strongly about someone in a long time.”
Today they had defeated God and Jack stole his power. They made it to town and Jack finally told them he wasn’t going back to the bunker with them. He was going to heaven to do what he was meant to, take care of the universe. Jack gave a tight hug to Sam. He then hugged Dean tightly and whispered in his ear, “Take care of him this time around.” Dean looked at him confused before he saw the trenchcoat behind Jack. Dean looked upwards and his eyes widened at the sight of Castiel standing out in the open.
Dean swallowed hard and walked past Jack and up to Cas. He reached up and touched Castiel’s cheek, almost not believing it himself. “Cas… it’s really you?”
Castiel couldn’t help touching the necklace Dean gave him. A fond smile crept on his face and he spotted the elder Winchester walking around the ship chatting with the crew. He heard someone walk up to him and he kept silent, unsure of who was wanting to speak with him.
Sam pulled back from his brother and smiled. “Thank you so much for telling me Dean. I was so scared.”
Supernatural
Dean nodded, understanding what Cas was saying to him. “I think I know what you mean.” So the feelings he has been having since he was young wasn’t disgusting or perverted. It just wasn’t accepted by close-minded people. He felt a weight lift from his shoulders, as if he had been carrying it his whole life. “Thank you for explaining it to me.” He looked into Castiel’s ocean blue eyes and found himself staring at the captain for a long amount of time. The sounds of the crew laughing in the background shook Dean from his reverie and he blinked and looked away from Castiel. He didn’t see Castiel tilt his head to the side with a thoughtful smile on his face.
It was a few hours later that Sam hugged Dean, “I am scared Dean. I don’t want to die.” That was all the seventeen year old murmured into his older brother’s ear.
“Jump!” Dean practically screamed, startling Sam. Both of them kicked off from the ship it seemed like they flew ten feet from the crashing ship. “Swim, hurry. Get to the rocks.” Dean called out over the crashing of the waves.
Dean reached a hand over and placed it on Castiel’s. “I have faith in you, but not in Zachariah.”
They made love to each other the whole night. By 6am they ended up falling asleep, their limbs tangled together as they both held each other and snored.
Just as Sam walked toward Gabriel, the ship swayed hard to the side, causing Sam and Gabriel to ram against the wall of the cabin.
Samuel wasn’t sure how to bring it up to his brother, afraid of being shunned and cast overboard. “Dean… please don’t hate me. I don’t think I could live with myself if you never wanted to be around me.”
“I’m fine Cas. Just… taking it in.” Dean looked at Sam and made a breathy laugh, “Sammy, I think we are finally free.”
When Sam caught sight of his brother he let out a relieved sigh. “Dean, there you are. Hello Castiel, do you mind if I take Dean to talk to him for a moment?”
“I won’t let you die. I will take care of you, don’t worry.” All Dean could do was try and comfort his scared brother - even if he was scared for his life also. “Did I ever tell you about when you were a toddler, mother found you trying to eat flowers and weeds out in the garden?”
Gabriel had looked stunned at what the older brother said and he glanced at his brother. He knew that his Castiel was the calmest and most patient of all the men on the ship, but he was still worried. And added to that, Gabriel was taking a liking to the taller brunette. The way he rolled his eyes at his brother’s back. It made the blond feel funny inside. He shook it off. He sure as hell isn’t supposed to be fond of a damned naval officer. They were the enemy.
The young officer sighed, dreading this exact moment. He and his brother tried to keep it a secret that they knew of magic and practiced it. Magic was highly illegal in most countries, so keeping it silent was the only way to live.
“You have nothing to worry about Dean. We are not your normal type of pirates, as you would say.”
“I wanted you to meet a friend. I think you might be able to help her.”
The pursed lip look he receives in return is becoming more common on Sam’s face lately. “Dean, you heard what she said about the CT Scan. There are abnormalities in your brain and brain stem. Your thyroid is barely functioning. They’re not seeing cell regeneration in your blood.”
Cas is aware of the bite of the needles, knows that it hurts just as much as he anticipated. The context has changed, though. Discomfort is taking a backseat to the scorching fire that Dean is making him feel. He is devouring his mouth, unyielding in his demand for Cas’s attention and participation. Their mouths move together languidly, but with an intensity that makes promises for what will come later.
Cas’s eyes go wide momentarily. Busted. He feels a flush heat his face. Dean has been paying attention to him, to his life. It makes him want to purr in contentment.
The thought of eternity with this man leaves Dean awestruck. He can have this. He can have his sinful voice whispering in his ear as mountains are worn down to foothills. He can watch him smile as new stars are born and die. He can be the companion of someone whose kindness is limitless, whose immense wisdom is tempered with selfless compassion. He can be loved by the man he is already beginning to love, and it will never end.
“In the park, one of the places you can stay is a refurbished Santa Fe caboose.”
“Aren’t you a gorgeous sight,” he rumbles, voice dropping into a guttural register as he’s consumed by lust. Dean relaxes back onto his heels as soon as he hears his voice. To Cas, it appears that he almost melts into position.
Out here in the suburbs to the West of the city, there is only wealth. Dean, being raised on the road for most of his childhood, has a difficult time resolving the contrast. It’s unnecessary vanity that he can’t wrap his head around.
“So, not to be Debby Downer, but what if he can’t?”
“Dean, I haven’t been gone 30 minutes -”
Sam knits his brow. “Dude, it looked really old and expensive. I didn’t want it to get lost or stolen.”
Cas nips along his shoulder as he lets the waves of bliss wash over him. “You’re a menace, Winchester,” he teases with a particularly sharp bite.
They lose themselves in the kiss, the heat from before returning in a rush. Dean guides them back towards his room - their room - oh fuck that sounds wonderful to say. Cas follows him willingly, never letting their mouths disconnect for more than a quick breath.
“So you haven’t seen anything that happens after -”
Dean stands waiting for Castiel to finish shaving. His eyes follow every smooth line of the razor with envy. Melancholy fills him at the thought that he will never have the opportunity to follow that same line with his fingertips. They itch with the need to feel the smooth skin revealed beneath the typical dark stubble. In fact, there are precious few minutes left before the prince will finish dressing and leave for the ball. Dean will never see him again.
“Ideally?” At Dean’s nod he continues, “I want your willing submission to me.”
Castiel stands, gives his brother a curt bow, and leaves the room without another word or glance towards Dean. The guards are called over once he is gone and Dean is manhandled into a chair. They make quick work of the iron bands, and Dean is left lighter, if not baffled at the exchange that led to this new development. It looked like Castiel had negotiated on his behalf at some cost to himself.
One by one, Cas lights the candles and sets them on the table. Dean takes a couple into other rooms so that they can make their way through the apartment.
Until Cas grabs his chin and forces him to look at him. Dean doesn’t see his lover, he sees his Dom.
“Fuck, Cas. You’re going to get me there untouched. I can already feel it coming.”
Dean looks up at Cas, who is lounging on an oversized chair across the room, and makes his way over. Cas takes his hands in his and motions for him to sit.
With a start, Dean shoots upright in bed when he hears the resounding slam of a door. He might be upright, but the rest of him is having a harder time coming back online. He blinks forcefully, clearing his vision while he breathes with intention to steady his adrenaline-punched heart. Once his brain catches up and gives him back his sight, he is more overcome than before.
When he was arrested for the first of many burglary charges at the age of fourteen, he belatedly realized that being sent to juvie would take him away from Claire. His biggest regret in life was not being able to say goodbye to that sweet little girl in pigtails, to explain why he couldn’t be her ‘Cat’ anymore. When he was released almost two years later, he bee-lined back to the Walsh’s to see her. He makes it a point to see her often, and she is the only person in the world he considers family.
Cas has never heard a more honest understanding of playing with kink. “You’re pretty amazing, Dean Winchester.”
“Alright, baby. Let’s begin.” Cas smirks at the huff of breath Dean replies with.
“Liar. I’ve watched you stare at him, envy and hatred in your heart. You couldn’t just do the simple thing I asked of you.”
Dean nods his head. “Do you think I was wrong to break things off?”
“Oh, Dean. I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry.” Cas’s feet move on their own towards him, ready to give Dean comfort. Instead of moving towards him, though, Dean’s body stiffens and he takes a step back. Cas stutters to a halt and he forces his greedy hands in his pockets.
Dean hurries to obey. Sucking Cas’s cock is never, ever a hardship. Dean delights in it and it shows.
Jimmy’s head is pounding, a true migraine if he has ever felt one. Making his apologies, he stands and almost runs out of the cafe, leaving Dean sitting there alone.
Dean moans into his mouth, obviously getting just as much enjoyment out of the kiss. Once he allowed himself the first kiss, the floodgates swung open wide. He can’t seem to find the will to close them again. This feels too good, too much like giving in to everything he has ever been denied because of duty to family or crown. It may be impetuous, but he will worry about consequences later.
Chapter title is from the Bard himself... The Tempest, Act One, scene 2
“I didn’t mean to snap.” Dean blows out a rough exhale. “Have you talked to him lately?”
Cas lets out a moan that sends a shiver through Dean’s body. Cas raises an eyebrow, and Dean stills immediately. His jaw is clenched tight, muscles straining.
The fetid stink of too many bodies mixes with a sharp, metallic tang and sweet, matted-down decay. Somehow, the symmetry of uniform, if not clean, tiles feels out of place down here where chaos reigns. Down the dark, dingy halls. Way down in the depths of earth’s belly. The whoosh of air from the gaping maw heralds the arrival of the train. Shrill, shrieking, screams of brakes tingle along his scalp.
Blinking and shaking his head, Dean finally confesses, “Nothing, I just forgot that you weren’t my…” He swallows hard and looks away.
“Dominance and submission?”
Dean can see the wheels turning behind his eyes. He is weighing options, planning outcomes.  “I can’t help but notice that you are not injured. You took on four men and walked away unscathed. Perhaps you don’t need my protection,” he suggests.
Because Dean is who he is, the compliment is too much to take without deflection. “Aww, Cas. You don’t have to flatter me to get your dick sucked. I’m a sure thing, remember?”
Until it’s overpowered by the stink of unwashed bodies. Nose wrinkling at the intruding stench, Dean cracks open his eyes. Fuck. He should have known that something would get between him and his goal.
“Cas, please.” Dean is desperate to make his reality true. If he believes it strongly enough, he can make it true. Dean is shaking his head, forcing the other man’s words to disappear with his denial.
Dean lets go and cries out, rejoicing, as Cas grinds his groin into him. Every new delicious friction earns well-deserved praise. “Jesus, Cas. How did we survive without this? You’re perfect. I love you so much.”
“Impressive, but you were always going to go Ivy League. It was obvious even to a punk kid like me.”
“Yeah? Local boy?”
Confusion clouds Dean’s face. Cas tugs Dean’s hands gently until he follows and moves closer to Cas again. Cas smooths a hand over his cheek, letting touch reinforce their connection. “You are confusing dominance with aggression.”
“Is he going to be okay?” Jimmy asks quietly.
“Before I answer you, let’s have a drink.”
Gabe fake-gags. “So, real talk. What’s with the touchy-feely?”
Cas’s emphatic whisper causes Dean to shift. Cas rubs his back softly to settle him. Luke catches the tender gesture and raises an eyebrow but refrains from commenting.
“Oh, sweetheart,” Cas soothes with a kiss. “That makes me incredibly happy, but aren’t you getting a little sore? This is your first time and I fucked you hard.”
“Hey, man. You do remember that you’re at a party, right?”
Cas chuckles and grabs his shirt to wipe up the mess. Dean stops him before he can. “No, Cas.”
“Do I really need to go through the names in my rolodex again?”
“I did,” Dean says breathlessly. His cheeks pinking up at the suggestion of his disobedience.
He sees vague shadows moving around in the apartment, but the blinds are thick wood, so silhouettes are impossible to see. A light goes out. He prays to a god he doesn’t really believe in that Dean is not going out again tonight. The building’s front door opens, which catches his eye. Dean appears in the doorway and he looks right at where Cas is standing, across the street and in the shadows. There’s no way he can be seen from here. Dean can’t see him, unless...
“I really do.” Dean confirms with a kiss to his temple.

“Before we get too carried away, let’s do what we came here to do.”
Now that Dean can see again, he appreciates every color a little more. The most vibrant one, the center of Cas’s eyes, catches him like a lure. He can’t look away, even as Cas sits back down and tugs him forward to sit in his lap. The pleased smile on Cas’s face finally snaps him out of it.
Eyes locked on each other, Cas explains. “Touching an angel’s wings is a very intimate action. It is only done in sexual relationships. As those relationships grow, that bond does, too. It becomes a very important part of a couple’s intimacy.”
Cas lets his thumb retreat, pulling on his rim as he goes. Laying the string of beads out, he takes the smallest in his fingers and slicks it up with lube. Rubbing the little bead around Dean’s hole, he asks, “Are you ready for the first one?”
He comes in, shuts the door and locks it before leaning back against it, watching Dean hungrily.
Cas looks like he wants to argue, but not enough to actually do it. Dean brushes a quick kiss to his temple and leaves.
“I can’t promise that he will, but I appreciate the gesture.” Sam turns to Dean, who seems to be staring off in the distance, tired and broken. He gathers his brother up, speaking quietly to him. Before they get a dozen steps away, Dean turns.
Dean feels the warm liquid spread to coat his inner walls just as his cock answers with a thrumming, almost painful, pulsing of its own. Satisfaction floods him. The feeling of come sloshing inside him should probably be gross, but he revels in it. “Yeah, that’s it, Cas. Give it all to me.”

Cas barely hears the splash of him entering the water. “Showoff,” he laughs, much more impressed than he should be by Dean’s peacocking.
He looks down at his traitorous dick, willing it into submission. He gets out of the shower and dries himself off gingerly to avoid re-awakening it. So much for being refreshed for work. If anything, he’s more jittery than he was before. Rubbing a hand over his face, he tries to think logically. He’s worked diligently for six days. As twitchy as he is, he’s not going to get any more done. It makes sense to go find Cas, right? Aware that his logic is highly flawed, he decides that he’s going with it anyway.
