'Was it the person, whom you followed down the rampart, that has occasioned you this alarm?' said Sherlock, endeavouring to conceal his own.
The masses have had enough spectacle from me. I leave it to lessor performers. I may, however, grace it with my presence. SH
John looks. There, in a teeny plastic bag, is a small pin, proudly bearing the words ‘British House’ on the background of (of course) a stylized Union Jack.
The knot of athletes spilled off the bus and headed into the Team GB building, with union jacks and lions stuck up proudly on every flat surface. Bellowing the national anthem, Mike led them into the common room.
“We go now to the high bar, where the medals will be decided. Deng is on to the high bar and hoping for a perfect performance to muscle in on the medal reckoning. It looks very good indeed… he is pleased with that performance, Irene, and the landing is near perfect… but it’s only 14.966 and not good enough! Indeed he is 0.1 behind Lin. David Belyavskiy from Russia approaching the apparatus now…he needs 15.260 on the high bars to overtake Whitlock and secure a medal for Russia. Can he do it?”
While he considered, a sound of many voices in loud merriment burst upon his ear. Sherlock rushed forward, with a hope of obtaining assistance from the people in the woods. The sounds led him towards the moon-light glade he had before noticed; at a little distance from which he stopped, and saw, between the boles of the trees, a small circular level of green turf, surrounded by the woods, on which appeared a group of figures. On drawing nearer, he distinguished these, by their dress, to be peasants, and perceived several cottages scattered round the edge of the woods, which waved loftily over this spot. While he observed, several peasant girls came out of a cottage; music instantly struck up, and the dance began. It was the joyous music of the vintage! the same he had before heard upon the air. His heart, occupied with anxiety for his father, could not feel the contrast, which this cheerful scene offered to his own distress; he stepped hastily forward towards a group of elder peasants, who were seated at the door of a cottage, and, having explained his situation, entreated their assistance. Several of them rose with alacrity, and, offering any service in their power, followed Sherlock, who seemed to move on the wind, as fast as they could towards the road.
“16.316! Look, Sherlock, you got it exactly!” John huffed out a surprised breath. “That was amazing!”
Sherlock frowned. “And are you being…safe?” John garbled out, immediately cursing himself for his awkward phrasing.
John is bent almost in half now, bottom pointed right at Sherlock as his legs tap out behind him. Sherlock is helpless. Stranded by reason. Destitute of logic. Bereft of any capability to do anything other than watch John’s bum bounce in time to the music.
Sherlock retired to his apartment, to think, if in the present state of his mind to think was possible, upon this sudden and overwhelming subject. It was very long, before his spirits were sufficiently composed to permit the reflection, which, when it came, was dark and even terrible. He saw, that Moriarty sought to aggrandise himself in the disposal of Sherlock, and it occurred, that his friend Douglas was the person, for whom he was interested. The prospect of going to Italy was still rendered darker, when he considered the tumultuous situation of that country, then torn by civil commotion, where every petty state was at war with its neighbour, and even every castle liable to the attack of an invader. He considered the vast distance, that was to separate him from John, and, at the recollection of him, every other image vanished from his mind, and every thought was again obscured by grief. He had to be outside; in the cool of the garden perhaps he could find repose.
These excited not only the envy, but the trifling ambition of Monsieur Mycroft, who, since he could not rival the splendour of her festivities, was desirous of being ranked in the number of her most intimate friends. For this purpose he paid her the most obsequious attention, and made a point of being disengaged, whenever he received an invitation from Madame Petitbois, of whom he talked, wherever he went, and derived much self-consequence from impressing a belief on his general acquaintance, that they were on the most familiar footing.
'Well,' rejoined Roberto, 'you may be as merry now, as you please; you was none so jocose the other night, Sebastian, when you was on watch with Launcelot.'
'Ah, sir! at my age I must not expect that!' replied the old man, and he paused: 'I can scarcely wish it,' he resumed, 'for I trust that whenever I die I shall go to heaven, where my poor wife is gone before me. I can sometimes almost fancy I see her of a still moon-light night, walking among these shades she loved so well. Do you believe, monsieur, that we shall be permitted to revisit the earth, after we have quitted the body?'
“What!” spits Mary, clutching her jacket tight around her, leaning into to Sherlock’s personal space. “You’re a psychopath!”
The conversation was interrupted by a violent uproar without, in which the voice of the muleteer was heard above every other sound. John started from his seat, and went to enquire the occasion; but the dispute continued so long afterwards, that Sherlock went himself, and found Michael quarrelling with the hostess, because she had refused to let his mules lie in a little room where he and three of her sons were to pass the night. The place was wretched enough, but there was no other for these people to sleep in; and she refused to let the animals have the same bed-chamber with her children. This was a tender point with the muleteer; his honour was wounded when his mules were treated with disrespect, and he would have received a blow, perhaps, with more meekness. He declared that his beasts were as honest beasts, and as good beasts, as any in the whole province; and that they had a right to be well treated wherever they went. 'They are as harmless as lambs,' said he, 'if people don't affront them. I never knew them behave themselves amiss above once or twice in my life, and then they had good reason for doing so. Once, indeed, they kicked at a boy's leg that lay asleep in the stable, and broke it; but I told them they were naughty, and by St. Anthony! I believe they understood me, for they never did so again.'
“DONOVAN!!” screeched Anderson from down the row. Really, thought John with a sidelong glance at Mike, something ought to be done.
Moriarty's suspicions naturally fell upon the porter, whom he ordered now to attend. Carlo hesitated, and then with slow steps went to seek him. Barnardine, the porter, denied the accusation with a countenance so steady and undaunted, that Moriarty could scarcely believe him guilty, though he knew not how to think him innocent. At length, the man was dismissed from his presence, and, though the real offender, escaped detection.
blue. So clear. In the summertime, you can smell the resin from the pine trees as it rises in the sun.” He paused. “And at Morgiou, you can dive to this cave. You have to dive through a long tunnel,” his fingers mimed flippers, “nearly 200 metres long, and then at the end the cave opens up and it’s above the water level. And people, people twenty-seven thousand years ago painted animals there, John, they painted deer and seals and birds and
“Oh, I’m afraid we can’t, Violet,” John said smoothly. “Sherlock and I need to go to a gymnastics team meeting back at the Village, you know, official wrap-up, now that the competition is over.”
Sherlock renewed enquiries, concerning Mycroft, but Carlo had been employed at the other end of the castle, during the time, that he was removed, and he had heard nothing since, concerning the matter.
To soothe your disordered spirtis, have a lovely view of the village of Bassano del Grappa (home of the brandy!) on the River Brenta, which I imagine to be much like the one where Sherlock visits M. Anderson.
, because the phone, travelling at some speed, struck the bottom of a stiff plastic bag, crumpling the base and sending its contents spilling out in a stream of metallic green to puddle at Sherlock’s feet.
Sinking upon the massy stone ground, and clutching his hair, Sherlock bewailed this latest agony; confined as a prisoner while the castle was besieged, the surrounding mountains infested with hostile parties, who seized every opportunity for plunder.
Monsieur Mycroft returned no answer to Sherlock's letter, who began to hope, that he should be permitted to remain some time longer in retirement, and his mind had now so far recovered its strength, that he had taken up again his books and studies; and his violin.
Gather round for the spooky recitations of how the castle of Musgrovio came to Moriarty's possession.  Plus: a little bit of back story.
Sherlock feels his mouth open, but his mother swoops in before he can get anything out. “Ah! John! Greg! How nice – why don’t we all have lunch?”
Sherlock huffs. His bum cheeks jiggle as John’s stubby fingers gently tap out the rhythm of the song, humming along.
Indignation flashed from the eyes of the cavaliers, who all drew their swords; and Mycroft, terrified at what might ensue, was hastening from the hall, when his husband commanded him to stay; but his further words could not now be distinguished, for the voice of every person rose together. His order, that all the servants should appear, was at length obeyed, and they declared their ignorance of any deceit—a protestation which could not be believed; for it was evident, that, as Moriarty's liquor, and his only, had been poisoned, a deliberate design had been formed against his life, which could not have been carried so far towards its accomplishment, without the connivance of the servant, who had the care of the wine ewers.
Sherlock considered.  Depending on the compromise Motteville was able to make with his creditors; it was possible his father could remain at Bakersfield, which would be best for his spirits and health.  His father’s income, never large, would now be reduced to little indeed.
Bill turns ‘round. There’s John in the queue, team t-shirt on back to front. And Sherlock too, hair all mussed and sticking up at the back, staring up dazedly at the McDonald’s menu.
Sherlock, in his own apartment, considered with intense anxiety all the unjust and tyrannical conduct of Moriarty, the dauntless perseverance of Wilkes, and his own desolate situation, removed from his friends and country. He looked in vain to John, confined by his profession to a distant kingdom, as a protector; but it gave him comfort to know, that there was, at least, one person in the world, who would sympathize in his afflictions, and whose wishes would fly eagerly to release him.
John opened his mouth to say something; it could’ve been a staunch denial of any seriousness about the morning’s kiss, it could’ve been a question of whether Sherlock wanted to do that again. But before he could even begin to decide which he would say his mum’s voice broke through “John, sorry sweetheart, can you come here and help me reach something from the top cupboard?”
“Ah! Darlings!” Sherlock strode into the kitchen dressed in his suit, a wine red shirt on today which was about as festive as Sherlock Watson-Holmes got.
“Eventually, yeah. But she’s spiralling right now, gasping for a drink. I don’t want her to come here and find out I’ve not told her I’m married and all loved up and happy with you. She’d be pissed. And you know siblings. It’s complicated. Can we just… just for a little while, as I test the waters… just keep this on the down low?”
“That will definitely help. Now, sleep.” Sherlock lay him back amongst his dinosaurs and tucked him in with a soft smile “I love you, goodnight.”
“I’ll be back in a minute.” Sherlock whispered. First he went to the corner of their room where the crib lay holding two-month-old Charlie. The boy lay blissfully asleep, sucking his thumb. Sherlock stroked a finger down his cheek then went upstairs to find his other children.
“Oh yes, you wouldn’t have heard of him; he’s boring and doesn’t give anyone any presents.” Sherlock revealed.
“Of course, mum.” John nodded, left the last plate to drain and said “Have we got any plans between now and then?”
Sherlock huffed a laugh “Please, your gifts to me were wonderful and thoughtful and shall keep me entertained. Though, for next year, go one better and just wear the kilt in person.”
John nodded “The… the shooting.” He lifted a hand to grip onto his shoulder, and Sherlock knew he would have phantom pain running through it for the next day or so. The nightmares and memories disturbed John immensely, both physically and mentally.
“Get out, Gavin. I’m going to have sex with my husband.” Sherlock said as he wrapped his arms around John’s back and pulled him down for more.
“Excuse you.” Sherlock’s surprisingly delicate voice spoke over John, who looked down at him in a happy surprise.
He ignored the small gasp of surprise and delight behind him and just breathed in the smell and taste of Sherlock before pulling away.
“Daddy!” Amelia and Ava chorused excitedly and jumped up to hug him. John met them with a big hug, one arm for each of them.
John was sat up in bed in his private room (thank you, Mycroft) watching some crap telly as he tried not to think about missing Christmas day at Baker Street. He loved seeing his kids open their gifts, and sharing food, and singing Christmas songs…
McDonalds is the official restaurant of the Olympics.  And they have an official restaurant at the Olympic Village where the athletes can eat for free.  Cos after years of calorie counting and nutritional planning, you have your event, and what do you do?
“Takes more than one basketballer to make a three-continents,” Bill agrees. “You need a swimmer at least.”
Sherlock gazed on the plane-tree, and then seated himself, for the last time, on the bench under its shade, where he had so often sat with his parents, and where, only a few hours before, he had conversed with John, at the remembrance of whom, a mingled sensation of esteem, tenderness and anxiety rose in his breast. John had declared his love; but Mycroft’s words taunted him; perhaps it was indeed all a romantic fantasy. It would be a cruelty to John to allow him to bind himself to Sherlock; who was so unsuited for the world.
Sherlock paused to consider this recollection, which he lamented, was tinged with terrible superstition given rise from his father’s burnt letters. 'Perhaps,' resumed he, 'perhaps, those strains I heard were sent to comfort,—to encourage me! Never shall I forget those I heard, at this hour, in Languedoc! Perhaps, my father watches over me, at this moment!' Thus passed the hour in watchfulness and solemn thought; but no sounds returned; and, after remaining at the casement, till the light tint of dawn began to edge the mountain-tops and steal upon the night-shade, he reluctantly concluded, that they would not return.
Thus the hours passed in solitude, in silence, and in anxious conjecturing. Being not once disturbed by a message, or a sound, it appeared, that Moriarty had wholly forgotten him, and it gave him some comfort to find, that he could be so unnoticed. Molly did not appear; Sherlock was alarmed for her, to whom in the confusion of the late scene, various accidents might have befallen. Sherlock endeavoured to withdraw his thoughts from the anxiety, that preyed upon them, but they refused controul; he could neither read, or draw, and the tones of the violin were so utterly discordant with the present state of his feelings, that he could not endure them for a moment.
'Yes, you do, sir; you know, that nobody knows any thing about Monsieur Mycroft; and it is plain, therefore, he is gone, the way of the first lady of the castle—nobody ever knew any thing about her.'
Sherlock gave a quick little snort of laughter, surprise flashing across his face before he schooled his features into a more serious expression. “No, no I’m afraid not John. So sad.”
John looks down at his shoes, flashing as he walks along. “I don’t – I want –.” John takes a deep breath.
The attack on Sherlock leaves us all with more unanswered questions.  Why? How? And who was behind it all?  But besides all that, it's the Rhythmic Gymnastics finals.  How will Sarah and Mary perform?  How will Sherlock perform?  And more importantly, after the events of yesterday, will John be in the audience to see?
“Vi, look at what John has given me!” Sieger said, holding up the handful of pins to his wife’s indulgent inspection.
“Look at what John’s given me, Sherlock,” says Sieger, hand full of pins once again. “This one’s from Norway, look.”
John’s teacup rattled as it reunited with its saucer; a quick flare of the nostrils. Annoyance. Reason: unclear.
In about half an hour, he followed to the dressing-room; and Sherlock observed, with horror, his dark countenance and quivering lip, and heard him denounce vengeance on his brother.
“You have to have more, go on, look at those gnocchi, delicious,” needles John at the pasta counter, creating a small spaghetti-and-meatball mountain on his own tray. He looks over sadly at Sherlock’s small helping of a vegetarian fettucine. “Where’s the protein in that?” he demands.
during the presentation.  AND THEN after her 4x100M medley team narrowly missed out on a bronze medal, she gave an interview where she discussed the
Sherlock could not restrain his excitement as he looked over the pine forests of the mountains upon the vast plains, that, enriched with woods, towns, blushing vines, and plantations of almonds, palms, and olives, stretched along, till their various colours melted in distance into one harmonious hue. Through the whole of this glorious scene the majestic Garonne wandered; descending from its source among the Pyrenees, and winding its blue waves towards the Bay of Biscay.
'If I have no right in these estates, sir,' said Sherlock, 'of what service can it be to you, that I should sign any papers, concerning them? If the lands are yours by law, you certainly may possess them, without my interference, or my consent.'
His father, startled by this deduction, came forth with the sad tale. There was a M. Motteville, of Paris, and the chief of Holmes’s personal property was invested in his hands;  a variety of circumstances have concurred to ruin him, and—Sieger Holmes, and consequently his son, was ruined with him. M. Anderson had told Sieger part of this news on his visit, which had now been confirmed.
The Friar led Sherlock from the church into the monastery adjoining the convent; and pressed him to stay on a few days.  Sherlock, who felt no desire to take up residence with Mycroft, had leisure, now that no immediate care pressed upon his attention, to feel the indisposition, which disabled him from immediately travelling.
“Holding up?” John says to Sieger at a convenient break during the rotation, even though it’s redundant; Sieger and Violet both are bouncing almost out of their skins, getting increasingly edgy as the rotation continues.
One asylum, however, would still be open to him France. He thought that he could board in the monastery adjacent to the convent that contained the remains of his late father. Here he could remain in safety and tranquillity, till the term, for which Bakersfield might be let, should expire; or, till the arrangement of M. Motteville's affairs enabled him so far to estimate the remains of his fortune, as to judge whether it would be prudent for Sherlock to reside there.
'No doubt you would,' replied Monsieur Mycroft, with a smile of irony, 'and I shall no doubt consent to this, since I see how necessary tranquillity and retirement are to restore your spirits. I did not think you capable of so much duplicity, brother; when you pleaded this excuse for remaining here, I foolishly believed it to be a just one, nor expected to have found with you so agreeable a companion as this M. Botson—, I forget his name.'
The barge passed on to the grand canal, where Moriarty's mansion was situated. And here, other forms of beauty and of grandeur, such as his imagination had never painted, were unfolded to Sherlock in the palaces of Sansovino and Palladio, as he glided along the waves. The air bore no sounds, but those of sweetness, echoing along each margin of the canal, and from gondolas on its surface, while groups of masks were seen dancing on the moon-light terraces, and seemed almost to realize the romance of fairyland.
As he sat musing, a peal of laughter rose from the terrace, and, on going to the casement, he saw, with inexpressible surprise, two ladies and a young man, dressed in the gala habit of Venice, walking with several gentlemen below. He gazed in an astonishment, till the group passed under his casement; and, one of the strangers looking up, he perceived the features of Signora Livona, with whose manners he had been so much charmed, the day after his arrival at Venice, and who had been there introduced at the table of Moriarty. This discovery gave Sherlock some perplexity - there was something so extraordinary in her being at this castle, circumstanced as it now was, and evidently, by the gaiety of her air, with her own consent, that a very painful deduction arose, concerning her character.
'I had heard strange stories of that chamber before,' said Molly: 'but as it was so near yours, that I would not tell them to you, because they would frighten you. The servants had told me, often and often, that it was haunted, and that was the reason why it was shut up: nay, for that matter, why the whole string of these rooms, here, are shut up. I quaked whenever I went by, and I must say, I did sometimes think I heard odd noises within it. But, as I said, as I was passing along the corridor, and not thinking a word about the matter, or even of the strange voice that the Signors heard the other night, all of a sudden comes a great light, and, looking behind me, there was a tall figure, (I saw it as plainly, as I see you at this moment), a tall figure gliding along (Oh! I cannot describe how!) into the room, that is always shut up, and nobody has the key of it but the Signor, and the door shut directly.'
'Dear sir, you have eat nothing at all! Do try, and take a little bit more. And at Tholouse too I have heard my master talking of you and Mons. Watson to Madame Merveille and Madame Vaison, often and often, in a very ill-natured way, as I thought, telling them what a deal of trouble he had to keep you in order, and what a fatigue and distress it was, and that he believed you would run away with Mons. Watson, if he was not to watch you closely; and that you connived at his coming about the house at night, and—'
'Suffer!' interrupted John, 'suffer for me! O Sherlock—how sweet—how bitter are those words; what comfort, what anguish do they give! But why should we confide the happiness of our whole lives to the will of people, who have no right to interrupt, and, except in giving you to me, have no power to promote it? O Sherlock! venture to trust your own heart, venture to be mine for ever!' His voice trembled, and he fell silent; Sherlock looked upon him in amazement, when John proceeded to propose an immediate marriage, and that at an early hour on the following morning, he should quit Mycroft’s house, and be conducted by John to a neighbouring county, where a friar should await to unite them.
'I wonder, ma'am, why they call this the double chamber?' said Molly, while Sherlock surveyed it in silence and saw that it was lofty and spacious, like the others he had seen, and, like many of them, too, had its walls lined with dark larch-wood. The bed and other furniture was very ancient, and had an air of gloomy grandeur, like all that he had seen in the castle. One of the high casements, which he opened, overlooked a rampart, but the view beyond was hid in darkness.
“Oh, what’s this big one?” Sieger says, and even as Sherlock turns his head down to look at what his aged father has pulled out of the envelope, John knows with a sick feeling of dread what it is.
Adjoining the eastern side of the green-house, looking towards the plains of Languedoc, was a room, which Sherlock called his, and which contained his books, his drawings, his musical instruments, with some favourite birds and plants. Here he usually exercised himself in his studies, cultivated only because they were congenial to his taste, and in which native genius, assisted by the instructions of Monsieur Holmes, made him an early proficient. The windows of this room were particularly pleasant; they descended to the floor, and, opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house, the eye was led between groves of almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and myrtle, to the distant landscape, where the Garonne wandered.
“The last time I heard that song was in the movie Fifty Shades of Grey.  Irene, did you happen to see it at the cinemas?”
Sherlock assured him, that his advice was most precious to him, and that he would never forget it, or cease from endeavouring to profit by it. He felt as if these words were poison; surely to feel nothing was preferable than his present agony.  His father was mistaken; the comforts of the mind were infinite above the doubtful comforts of the heart; which must always be endangered by mortal woes.
The belief that goblets and glassware made on Murano island in Venice would shiver and shatter when poison was poured into them was prevalent in the 16th century, although sadly it is in fact not the case.  It was great for sales though - Venetian glass was extremely expensive. Here is an example from 1580 which you may imagine exploding in Moriarty's hand.
To assist in his thinking he took up his violin and stood by the window. As he was thus employed, he saw, walking on the rampart below, the men, who had so lately arrived at the castle. The sight of strangers surprised him, but still more, of strangers such as these. There was a singularity in their dress, and a certain fierceness in their air, that fixed all Sherlock’s attention. He put down the instrument and withdrew from the casement, while they passed, but soon returned to observe them further.
He withdrew willingly from his presence; but the thought of passing the remainder of the night in a chamber, which the door from the stair-case made liable to the intrusion of any person, now alarmed him more than ever, and he determined to call at Mycroft’s room, and request, that Molly might be permitted to be with him.
“And a lovely way to finish the fifth rotation of this session. The boys from Team GB on the parallel bars for the final rotation as they come up to the apparatus now. And Bill Murray will start… but looking at the team there, does Philip Anderson’s nose look a bit swollen to you Kate?”
'Well, well, enough of this,' said Moriarty, with quickness: 'I will talk more with thee to-morrow.'
“When he passes, each one he passes goes, ‘oooohhh.’”. Sherlock squirms into the single bed as John’s fingers trace patterns back down to his hips, breathing the lyrics into his ear.
“Hello,” he said, as if all the planets and stars are not orbiting him; “I don’t think I’ve actually said congratulations to you in person yet.”
'I have heard Signor Moriarty say,' rejoined Douglas, 'that he never knew but one man who deserved it.'
Sherlock, disgusted with this show of dramatics, was about to withdraw from the corridor, when a message from Moriarty commanded him to do so, and also that the Count, if he was not already gone, should quit the castle immediately. Indignation flashed from Wilkes's eyes, and flushed his cheeks.
Sherlock's mind was refreshed by sleep. On waking in the morning, he looked with surprise on Molly, who sat sleeping in a chair beside the bed, and then endeavoured to recollect himself; but the circumstances of the preceding night were swept from his memory, which seemed to retain no trace of what had passed, and he was still gazing with surprise on Molly, when the latter awoke.
Sherlock, wandering on, came to Holmes's favourite plane-tree, where so often, at this hour, they had sat beneath the shade together, and with his mother so often had conversed in happier times.  ‘No!’ said Sherlock; ‘It is merely a tree; sentiment is a weakness’, and walked towards the house, where he was met by Mrs. Hudson. 'Sherlock,' said she, 'I have been seeking you up and down this half hour, and was afraid some accident had happened to you. How can you like to wander about so in this night air! Do come into the house. Think what my poor master would have said, if he could see you. I am sure, when my dear lady died, no gentleman could take it more to heart than he did, yet you know he seldom shed a tear.'
'Sherlock, O! my Sherlock!' cried he in a tone faltering with impatience, while he turned, and, as John advanced, was alarmed at the expression of his countenance and the eager desperation of his air. 'In tears, Sherlock! I would speak with you,' said he, 'I have much to say; conduct me to where we may converse. But you tremble—you are ill! Let me lead you to a seat.'
It was now twelve o'clock. As he closed the casement, he heard footsteps on the terrace below, and saw imperfectly, through the gloom, several persons advancing, who passed under the casement. He then heard the clink of arms, and, in the next moment, the watch-word; when, recollecting the command he had overheard from Moriarty, and the hour of the night, he understood, that these men were, for the first time, relieving guard in the castle. Having listened till all was again still, Sherlock retired to the bed.
Sherlock looked surprised and embarrassed; the lady, who had lately spoke, astonished, and Monsieur Mycroft, who, though she did not perfectly understand this speech, was very ready to believe himself complimented by it, said smilingly, 'O Signor! you are very gallant; but those, who hear you vindicate the Chevalier's discernment, will suppose that I am the object of it.'
They were all again silent, and the countenance of Moriarty changed. 'This is no illusion of the fancy,' said Douglas, at length breaking the profound silence.—'No,' said Bertolini; 'I heard it myself, now. Yet here is no person in the room but ourselves!'
'Yes, read it, child,' said Monsieur Mycroft, handing over the letter, in a manner less severe than Sherlock had expected, and he had, perhaps, never before obeyed his brother so willingly. In this letter John said little of the interview of the preceding day, but concluded with declaring, that he would accept his dismission from Sherlock only, and with entreating, that he would allow him to wait upon them, on the approaching evening.  Sherlock looked at his brother.
Sherlock, considering that he had no appeal from this will, forbore to dispute his right. 'While my brother lived, sir,' said he, 'my residence here was not improper; but now, that he is no more, I may surely be permitted to depart. My stay cannot benefit you, sir, and will only distress me.'
Mike’s face made its way into John’s vision, next to him, just inside his personal space. John gave three little jumps. “You right, mate?” said Mike softly, just above a whisper. John gestured down to the floor with a quick nod of the head.   Mike took up position opposite him, legs spread wide. As John reached over his right foot, Mike continued, “I know you and Sarah used to…ah.”
“No time for that!” said Sherlock, tossing John’s laptop onto the couch and bounding towards the door. “If we hurry, we can catch them at it.”
Sherlock was recalled from a kind of slumber, into which he had, at length, sunk, by a quick knocking at his chamber door. He started up in terror, for Moriarty and Count Wilkes instantly came to his mind; but, recognizing the voice of Molly, he rose and opened the door.
John grinned at the sparking ocean as Sherlock hopped and cursed behind him, striving to maintain the towel in the dignity-protecting area without falling over in it. “Right, Ok,” he heard Sherlock mutter to himself, as his warm trousers dropped onto John’s heels. John looked up at the sun, face hot, only to start when a hand was placed onto his shoulder. “Can’t balance in the sand,” Sherlock mumbled disconcertingly close to his ear as he shifted very close to John’s body.
Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cottage in the skirts of the woods below, suffering under bodily and mental pain, and meditating deep revenge against Moriarty. His servant, whom he had dispatched for a surgeon to the nearest town, which was, however, at a considerable distance, did not return till the following day, when, his wounds being examined and dressed, the practitioner refused to deliver any positive opinion, concerning the degree of danger attending them; but giving his patient a composing draught and ordering him to be quiet, remained at the cottage to watch the event.
“Ah, well, what they actually say was that your coach was reviewing the scoring sheets with Mary’s coach, hello Miss Hawkins, whilst Mary was practicing her clubs routine. So your coach wasn’t looking at the room, so Mary could have been anywhere. Like out in the hall belting you, for instance.”
Sherlock in Venice!  At the time the novel was written, Venice was a byword for exotic entertainments- the ultimate tourist attraction, a place of festival, freedom, and licentiousness.
'This is an instance of your caprice,' said Moriarty, 'which I ought to have foreseen. Count Wilkes, whose suit you obstinately rejected, so long as it was countenanced by me, you favour, it seems, since you find I have dismissed him.'
John’s brain finally showed signs of life as they jostled around a corner. “Ah, you must be Sherlock Holmes! Good to meet you, finally!” he was nearly shouting to be heard over the crowd. The noise – God, it got into the body and echoed around the hollow spaces inside. You could feel the noise in your bones. Sherlock look pleased – a small smile quirked up the side of his mouth.
As he stood, considering what was further to be done, on a sudden he heard Michael's voice roaring forth most manfully among the cliffs above, till he made their echoes ring. John immediately answered the call, and endeavoured to make his way through the thicket that clothed the steeps, following the direction of the sound. After much struggle over brambles and precipices, he reached Michael, and at length prevailed with him to be silent, and to listen to him. The road was at a considerable distance from the spot where Holmes and Sherlock were; the carriage could not easily return to the entrance of the wood, and, since it would be very fatiguing for Holmes to climb the long and steep road to the place where it now stood, John was anxious to find a more easy ascent, by the way he had himself passed.
'We have been talking over this affair,' said Monsieur Mycroft, 'the chevalier has been telling me, that the late Monsieur Petitbois was the brother of the Countess de Duvarney, his mother. I only wish he had mentioned his relationship to Madame Petitbois before; I certainly should have considered that circumstance as a sufficient introduction to my house.' John bowed, and was going to address Sherlock, but his brother prevented him. 'I have, therefore, consented that you shall receive his visits; and, though I will not bind myself by any promise, or say, that I shall consider him as my brother-in-law, yet I shall permit the association, and shall look forward to any further connection as an event, which may possibly take place in a course of years, provided the chevalier rises in his profession, or any circumstance occurs, which may make it prudent for him to take a husband. But Mons. Watson will observe, and you too, Sherlock, that, till that happens, I positively forbid any thoughts of marrying.'
, it’s a 19.425 and that’s huge, it’s fucking astronomical, no-one will catch him; Sherlock will win the gold medal. The crowd is going nuts; Sherlock’s face on the camera looks stunned, shocked stock-still with Mrs. Hudson sobbing into his shoulder; and John’s face is wet too, but it doesn’t matter because Sieger and Violet and Mycroft all have their arms round him crying joyful tears into his hair and who minds anything when an Olympic gold medal happens to the love of your life?
John feels as if he might rip his face off before the qualifier is over. As Sherlock stared at the camera in the kiss ‘n’ cry, his scores, all four of them, had flashed up on the screen with a ‘6’ next to his name.
“We’re not all so well connected as you, dear. Done with your pudding yet? You are a slowpoke aren’t you? Best get a move on, big day tomorrow, must be early – your Daddy’s
Sherlock took up the sputtering light, and he and Molly crept down the corridor and proceeded through twists and turns to the main gates, in almost total darkness. Voices were now heard, and Sherlock thought he distinguished those of Count Wilkes, and Moriarty. Soon after, he heard steps approaching, and peered cautiously past a pillar on an upper balcony, where they were secreted.  ‘It is the Count, sure enough’ whispered Molly, peering over Sherlock’s head.
'This is poor doings!' said Mrs. Hudson. 'Dear boy! do take some food! I have dressed a pheasant, and a fine one it is. Old Monsieur Barreaux sent it this morning, for I saw him yesterday, and told him you were coming. And I know nobody that seemed more concerned, when he heard the sad news, then he.'
'If every man deserves the title of impertinent, who admires Monsieur Sherlock,' replied Douglas, 'I fear there are a great many impertinents, and I am willing to acknowledge myself one of the number.'
'Come, come,' said Moriarty, 'other business brought me here. I must be trifled with no longer. I have immediate occasion for what I demand—those estates must be given up, without further contention; or I may find a way—'
Judging by the chorus of ‘oof!’s as the bus lurches to a halt, John isn’t the only one who was distracted by the lights. The building looks amazing, all lit up against the trees and the backdrop of Christ the Redeemer at the top of the mountain.
From the steps, they proceeded through a passage, adjoining the vaults, the walls of which were dropping with unwholesome dews, and the vapours, that crept along the ground, made the torch burn so dimly, that Sherlock expected every moment to see it extinguished, and Barnardine could scarcely find his way. As they advanced, these vapours thickened, and Barnardine, believing the torch was expiring, stopped for a moment to trim it. As he then rested against a pair of iron gates, that opened from the passage, Sherlock saw, by uncertain flashes of light, the vaults beyond, and, near him, heaps of earth, that seemed to surround an open grave. Such an object, in such a scene, would, at any time, have disturbed him; but now he was shocked by an instantaneous deduction, that this was the grave of his brother, and that the treacherous Barnardine was leading him to destruction. The obscure and terrible place, to which he had conducted him, seemed to justify the thought; it was a place suited for murder, a receptacle for the dead, where a deed of horror might be committed, and no vestige appear to proclaim it. Sherlock was so overwhelmed with terror, that, for a moment, he was unable to determine what conduct to pursue. He then considered, that it would be vain to attempt an escape from Barnardine, by flight, since the length and the intricacy of the way he had passed would soon enable him to be overtaken by the porter, who was better acquainted with the turnings, and who carried the only light. Sherlock feared equally to irritate him by a disclosure of his suspicions, which a refusal to accompany him further certainly would do; and, since he was already as much in his power as it was possible he could be, if he proceeded, he, at length, determined to suppress, as far as he could, the appearance of apprehension, and to follow silently whither he designed to lead. Pale with horror and anxiety, he now waited till Barnardine had trimmed the torch, and, as his sight glanced again upon the grave, he could not forbear enquiring, for whom it was prepared. Barnardine took his eyes from the torch, and fixed them upon Sherlock’s face without speaking. He repeated the question, but the man moved on; and Sherlock followed to a second flight of steps, having ascended which, a door delivered them into the first court of the castle. As they crossed it, the light shewed the high black walls around them, fringed with long grass and dank weeds, that found a scanty soil among the mouldering stones; the heavy buttresses, with, here and there, between them, a narrow grate, that admitted a freer circulation of air to the court, the massy iron gates, that led to the castle, whose clustering turrets appeared above, and, opposite, the huge towers and arch of the portal itself. In this scene the large, uncouth person of Barnardine, bearing the torch, formed a characteristic figure. This Barnardine was wrapt in a long dark cloak, which scarcely allowed the kind of half-boots, or sandals, that were laced upon his legs, to appear, and shewed only the point of a broad sword, which he usually wore, slung in a belt across his shoulders. On his head was a heavy flat velvet cap, somewhat resembling a turban, in which was a short feather; the visage beneath it shewed strong features, and a countenance furrowed with the lines of cunning and darkened by habitual discontent.
The extent and darkness of these tall woods awakened terrific images in his mind, and he almost expected to see banditti start up from under the trees. At length, the carriages emerged upon a heathy rock, and, soon after, reached the castle gates, where the deep tone of the portal bell, which was struck upon to give notice of their arrival, increased the fearful emotions, that had assailed Sherlock. While they waited till the servant within should come to open the gates, he anxiously surveyed the edifice: but the gloom, that overspread it, allowed him to distinguish little more than a part of its outline, with the massy walls of the ramparts, and to know, that it was vast, ancient and dreary. From the parts he saw, he judged of the heavy strength and extent of the whole. The gateway before him, leading into the courts, was of gigantic size, and was defended by two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where, instead of banners, now waved long grass and wild plants, that had taken root among the mouldering stones, and which seemed to sigh, as the breeze rolled past, over the desolation around them. The towers were united by a thick wall, pierced and embattled also, below which appeared the pointed arch of a huge portcullis, surmounting the gates: from these, the walls of the ramparts extended to other towers, overlooking the precipice, whose shattered outline, appearing on a gleam, that lingered in the west, told of the ravages of war.  Beyond these, all was lost in the obscurity of evening.
'No' replied she, 'never; and lately they have done nothing but talk of the apparition, that has been walking about of a night on the ramparts, and that frightened the sentinels into fits. It came among them like a flash of fire, they say, and they all fell down in a row, till they came to themselves again; and then it was gone, and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls.'
“Irene, this is a battle worthy of the ancient Greeks themselves. After a less difficult routine from Watson on the parallel bars, he’d fallen slightly behind the two leaders, but looked good, comfortably clear of fourth-placed Chinese gymnast Chaopan Lin. But then! The Russian, David Belyavskiy, huge performance on the parallel bars in the fifth rotation. Watson’s final rotation is on the floor, not one of his best apparatuses; it’s Watson, Belyavskiy, Lin and Deng, also from China, all with realistic medal chances.”
“Not sure it was meant to happen like that, actually,” said Mike mildly. John bit his tongue to keep the smirk from his face. “Oh yeah, look, they haven’t done so well,” continued Mike, gesturing to the scoreboard revealing the unfortunate team had scored 5
Sherlock is quite sure, as it happens. He is of course a genius, but that’s hardly necessary in this case, not with John’s horrible teammates constantly droning on about how many women he has had casual intercourse with. He sticks his other toe into the tights and rolls them on.
'A hope of learning something more satisfactory, or more positive, detained me in his company a considerable time, and I renewed the subject repeatedly, but the Italian wrapped himself up in reserve. Think, Sherlock, what I must suffer to see you depart for a foreign country, committed to the power of a man of such doubtful character as is this Moriarty!’
“What do the doctors say? I heard this morning that there wasn’t a break, so that’s good, isn’t it?”
“I did!” Sherlock gestured at his civvies, loose black tracksuit pants and a t-shirt decorated with a design of honeycomb and a bee that hovered above his right nipple. “I didn’t know you actually meant to go in the water!”
Monsieur Mycroft, notwithstanding an apparent reluctance to receive his brother, desired his company. The love of power was his ruling passion, and he knew it would be highly gratified by taking into his house a young orphan, who had no appeal from his decisions, and on whom he could exercise without control the capricious humour of the moment.
“What was that back there? That wasn’t Three Continents Watson, the lover of international volleyballers and badminton players we know and love. Aiming for something closer to home are we?”
'Who are you?' demanded Sherlock, in a tone of mingled terror and outrage, while he still struggled for liberty—'who are you, that have the impudence thus to insult me?'
'Well, they saw her go down among the woods, but night came, and she did not return: ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock came, and no lady! Well, the servants thought to be sure, some accident had befallen her, and they went out to seek her. They searched all night long, but could not find her, or any trace of her; and, from that day to this she has never been heard of.'
On the following day, Moriarty sent a second excuse to Sherlock, who was surprised at the circumstance.  'His conscience tells him the purport of my visit, and he defers it, to avoid an explanation' thought Sherlock.
Sherlock looks down, finally. “You’ll be a public figure when you get back, John. This might be… complicated, post-games.”
“She’s well, Sherlock, well. She’s one of the first soloists now,” said Victor, his voice warming again.
'Moriarty, you are too precipitate,' said the Count, who had listened to this conversation in extreme agitation and impatience;—'Signor Holmes, I entreat your own explanation of this affair!'
'Well—well! I will not argue with you; I see you have exactly your father's disposition; and let me tell you it would have been much happier for him, poor man! if it had been a different one.'
While he thus leaned, Moriarty, followed by two men, appeared, ascending a winding path, cut in the rock below. He stopped upon a cliff, and, pointing to the ramparts, turned to his followers, and talked with much eagerness of gesticulation.—Sherlock perceived, that one of these men was Carlo, the chief servant; the other was in the dress of a peasant, and he alone seemed to be receiving the directions of Moriarty.
Meanwhile, the travellers pursued their journey mostly in silence; with intermittent lectures from Mycroft on the general wrongness of Sherlock’s character, conduct and precepts. At length, these unpleasant sermons were interrupted by the arrival of the travellers at Tholouse; and Sherlock, who had not been there for many years, and had only a very faint recollection of it, was surprised at the ostentatious style exhibited in his brother’s house and furniture; the more so, perhaps, because it was so totally different from the modest elegance, to which he had been accustomed. He followed Monsieur Mycroft through a large hall, where several servants in rich liveries appeared, to a kind of saloon, fitted up with more shew than taste; and Mycroft, complaining of fatigue, ordered supper immediately. 'I am glad to find myself in my own house again,' said he, throwing himself on a large settee, 'and to have my own people about me. I detest travelling; though, indeed, I ought to like it, for what I see abroad always makes me delighted to return to my own chateau. What makes you so silent, brother mine?—What is it that disturbs you now?'
Sherlock was again confused, and again hesitated what to reply; he felt most acutely the difficulty—his isolation did not allow a single relative, or friend, to whom he could turn for even a look, that might support and guide him in the present embarrassing circumstances. Monsieur Mycroft, who was his only relative, and ought to have been this friend, was either occupied by his own amusements, or so resentful of the reluctance his brother had shewn to quit Bakersfield, that he seemed totally to have abandoned Sherlock there.
mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his arch-enemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
Monsieur Mycroft did not perceive the meaning of this too satirical sentence, and he, therefore, escaped any indignation at the barbs his brother had detected. 'O! here comes Signor Moriarty himself,' said he, 'I protest I will tell him all the fine things you have been saying to me.' The Signor, however, passed at this moment into another walk. 'Pray, who is it, that has so much engaged your friend this evening?' asked Monsieur Mycroft, with an air of chagrin, 'I have not seen him once.'
The barge stopped before the portico of a large house, from whence a servant of Moriarty crossed the terrace, and immediately the party disembarked. From the portico they passed a noble hall to a stair-case of marble, which led to a saloon, fitted up in a style of magnificence that surprised Sherlock. The walls and ceilings were adorned with historical and allegorical paintings, in fresco; silver tripods, depending from chains of the same metal, illumined the apartment, the floor of which was covered with Indian mats painted in a variety of colours and devices; the couches and drapery of the lattices were of pale green silk, embroidered and fringed with green and gold. Balcony lattices opened upon the grand canal, whence rose a confusion of voices and of musical instruments, and the breeze that gave freshness to the apartment. Sherlock, considering the gloomy temper of Moriarty, looked upon the splendid furniture of this house with suspicion, and remembered the report of his being a man of broken fortune.
Sherlock no longer opposed him, as John led him into an adjoining parlour; the manner, in which John had named Moriarty, left Sherlock no doubt that John intended to fight a duel, the lethal consequences of which must be prevented. ‘Do not expect, Sherlock’ stormed John, ‘that I can tamely submit to the authority of Moriarty; if I could, I should be unworthy of you!’
The grey of morning had long dawned through his casements, before Sherlock closed his eyes in exhausted slumber; when wearied nature, at length, yielded him a respite from suffering.
'If I ever had disguised them, sir,' said Sherlock, with recollected spirit, 'it would certainly be unnecessary any longer to do so. I had hoped, sir, that you would have spared me any farther necessity of alluding to them; but, since you do not grant this, hear me declare, and for the last time, that your perseverance has deprived you even of the esteem, which I was inclined to believe you merited.'
“Oh, oh, um, sorry,” John jabbers as he backs away from Sherlock’s legs, swinging as he changes his stretching position. Sherlock’s left leg is behind him, bent at the knee as Sherlock grips his foot overhead, forming a perfect arch with his body, still looking up at John with those blue-green eyes.
his face all creased up with joy and shock and he’s done it and Mary and the Irish and the rest of them can all go
'And what is that tapering light you bear?' said Sherlock, 'see how it darts upwards,—and now it vanishes!'
John’s eyes were dark and wild when he looked at Sherlock, who could do naught but nod before John claimed his lips with ferocious passion, mesmerised as John pulled the clothes from his own body then laid Sherlock down upon them, his body quivering as John exposed his skin to the sultry air of the night.  John was marble in the moon-light, the planes of his chest shadowy and strong, the jagged knot on his shoulder visible even in the darkness; Sherlock’s head was thrown back as kisses were laved upon his neck, his back arched as John’s mouth swept over his chest and stomach before pausing over the dark grove between his legs where Sherlock trembled for John’s touch.  Sherlock’s hand explored the soft curve of John’s cheek, his ear, his head; it was as the swelling of a gentle hill against the sharp lines of the elevated peaks of Sherlock’s spread knees.
“His favoured apparatus of course, Kate, but a 15.875 is a really great result for him on that apparatus, setting the bar high and he can go forward to the next rotation with confidence. Watson could be a contender today despite having qualified in eighth place; earned the all-around silver at the 2014 worlds and then placed fifth in 2015 after a fall on the high bar. He’ll need to come out firing today to make his mark in this strong field, but off to a great start.”
Sherlock could not forbear smiling at Molly's ideas of John, and repeated his enquiry, whether he had heard the servants talk of prisoners.
After a league and a half more, passed in darkness, the travellers arrived at Beaujeu, and drove up to the only inn the place afforded; which, though superior to any they had seen since they entered the mountains, was bad enough.
“Equestrienne is the female form of the word, I think you’ll find,” said Sherlock as he stands and departs.
Before they separated for the night, M. Anderson desired to speak with Holmes alone, and they retired to another room, where they remained a considerable time. The subject of this conversation intrigued Sherlock; but, whatever it might be, Holmes, when he returned to the supper-room, seemed much disturbed, and a shade of sorrow sometimes fell upon his features.
'Hopkins,' said the poor girl, 'Hopkins shut me up. When I ran away from the dressing-room door to-day, I went I scarcely knew where, for safety; and, in this gallery, here, I met Hopkins, who hurried me into this chamber, and locked me up to keep me out of harm, as she said. But she was in such a hurry, she hardly spoke ten words, but she told me she would come, and let me out, when all was quiet, and she took away the key with him. Now all these hours are passed, and I have neither seen, or heard a word of her; they have murdered her—I know they have!'
The man hums. “Well, perhaps I can think of something else that may interest you. Won’t you come and be introduced to my parents?”
A turn on the road now allowed a nearer view of the chateau, the chimneys, tipped with light, rising from behind Holmes's favourite oaks, whose foliage partly concealed the lower part of the building. He saw the old housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, coming to open the gate. Redbeard also came running, and barking before him; and when his young master alighted, fawned, and played round him, gasping with joy.
Madame Holmes, reanimated by the cheerfulness and recovery of her husband, was no longer sensible of the indisposition which had lately oppressed her; and, as she sauntered along the wood-walks of this romantic glen, and conversed with him, and with her son, she often looked at them alternately with a degree of tenderness, that filled her eyes with tears. Holmes observed this more than once, and gently reproved her for the emotion; but she could only smile, and clasp his hand, and that of Sherlock. Sieger felt emotion stealing upon himself in a degree that became almost painful; his features assumed a serious air, and he could not forbear secretly sighing—'Perhaps I shall some time look back to these moments, as to the summit of my happiness, with hopeless regret. But let me not misuse them by useless anticipation; let me hope I shall not live to mourn the loss of those who are dearer to me than life.'
John desperately wanted to know; he wanted to ask about what happened in France and why Sherlock left the ballet and who is Victor to him?  But the spell would be broken;
He went to pass on, but in the next moment, the sound of heavy gates of the portal opening was heard, and then the clattering of horses' hoofs in the court, with the confusion of many voices. Sherlock stood for a moment hesitating whether he should follow Moriarty, who, at the sound of the trumpet, had passed through the hall, and saw through the door, that opened beyond a long perspective of arches into the courts, a party of horsemen, whom he judged, as well as the distance would allow, to be the same he had seen depart, a few days before. But he staid not to scrutinize, for, when the trumpet sounded again, the chevaliers rushed out of the cedar room, and men came running into the hall from every quarter of the castle. Sherlock once more hurried for shelter to the hall’s balcony, and thence in pursuit of old Carlo, who he found bearing some fruit and wine for his master.
It was in vain, that Sherlock endeavoured to subdue his emotion, and seek comforts in science. The silence of John afflicted more than it surprised him, since he correctly attributed it to his brother’s meddling. He kept his room, every meeting with Mycroft was a painful torment.
A return of the noise again disturbed him; it seemed to come from that part of the room, which communicated with the private stair-case, and he instantly remembered the odd circumstance of the door having been fastened, during the preceding night, by some unknown hand. His late alarming deduction, concerning its destination, also occurred to him. Sherlock’s heart became faint with terror. Gently drawing aside the curtain, he looked towards the door of the stair-case, but the lamp, that burnt on the hearth, spread so feeble a light through the apartment, that the remote parts of it were lost in shadow. The noise, however, which, he was convinced, came from the door, continued. It seemed like that made by the undrawing of rusty bolts, and often ceased, and was then renewed more gently, as if the hand, that occasioned it, was restrained by a fear of discovery.
The Count's servants having declared, that they would not move him till he revived, Moriarty's stood inactive, Douglas remonstrating, and Sherlock, abusing Wilke’s servants as the densest of fools, bade them bind up his wound if they wished their master to survive the night.
John stares at the back of Bill’s head, willing himself not to smack it, before he follows, ready to do his best for this sponsor shindig. Olympics don’t pay for themselves, he knows. “Look boys, all you have to do is wear the suit, smile, and don’t get pissed before the party starts,” Lestrade had said to them that afternoon. “Except you two. No drinks for you,” he’d amended while glaring at John and Bill; “and make sure you’re back in the village and in bed by 9pm.”
'True, ma'am!' said Molly, with a look of horror, 'yes, it is true, indeed. But they do say,' she added, lowering her voice, 'they do say, that the Signora has been seen, several times since, walking in the woods and about the castle in the night: several of the old servants, who remained here some time after, declare they saw her; and, since then, she has been seen by some of the vassals, who have happened to be in the castle, at night. Carlo, the old steward, could tell such things, they say, if he would.'
“Well, John, amazing footage there of your historic two gold medals from yesterday, how does it feel watching that?”
Monsieur Mycroft's avarice at length yielded to his vanity. Some very splendid entertainments, which Madame Petitbois had given, and the general adulation, which was paid her, made the former more anxious than before to secure an alliance, that would so much exalt him in his own opinion and in that of the world. Mycroft proposed terms for the immediate marriage of his brother, and offered to give Sherlock a dower, provided Madame Petitbois observed equal terms, on the part of her nephew.
'It was no man, lady,' said Launcelot, who stood by, 'but the devil himself, as my comrade says. What man, who does not live in the castle, could get within the walls at midnight? Why, I might just as well pretend to march to Venice, and get among all the Senators, when they are counselling; and I warrant I should have more chance of getting out again alive, than any fellow, that we should catch within the gates after dark. So I think I have proved plainly enough, that this can be nobody that lives out of the castle; and now I will prove, that it can be nobody that lives in the castle—for, if he did—why should he be afraid to be seen? No, I say again, by holy Pope! it was the devil, and Sebastian, there, knows this is not the first time we have seen him.'
Seeing Sherlock’s parents raise their arms in greeting, John goes to return the gesture, only for Violet to delightedly call out ‘Gregory!’
On hearing this, John’s voice and countenance changed to an expression of dark despair. 'Sherlock!' said he, 'this, this moment is the bitterest that is yet come to me. You do not—cannot love me!—It would be impossible for you to reason thus coolly, thus deliberately, if you did. I, I am torn with anguish at the prospect of our separation, and of the evils that may await you in consequence of it; I would encounter any hazards to prevent it—to save you. No! Sherlock, no!—you cannot love me.'
'Yes' replied Roberto; 'but if I had not, what I saw was enough to have frightened the Pope himself.'
in including male RG in international competition (i.e. they want more medals), the FIG doesn't seem keen to do it - you can make up your own minds as to why, but to me, I think of the FIG discussing it very like
Moriarty ordered Sherlock to await him in the cedar parlour, whither he soon followed, and then sternly questioned him on this mysterious affair. Though Sherlock now viewed him with horror, as the murderer of his brother, and scarcely knew what he said in reply to his impatient enquiries, his answers and manner convinced Moriarty, that Sherlock had not taken a voluntary part in the late scheme, and he dismissed Sherlock to question his servants, and discover those, who had been accomplices in it.
“Sherlock,” John says again, rough and drawn out. “D’you want to sit on the couch? Because right now I’d just really, really like to kiss you. If that’s ok with you.” John swallows. “If that’s what you want.”
Sherlock has never been gladder of his parent’s typical dilatory progress through public spaces than he is when John bounces towards him, ruddy and smiling, outside the arena.
'Aye, ma'am, Hopkins said much the same thing of me. Good God! said she, Molly, what is to become of you, if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken Signors?'
'Father Denis!' said Holmes, who had listened to this narrative with patient attention, 'are we near a convent, then?'
The approaching interview with his uncle Anderson he regarded with some degree of hope, for he determined to represent to him the distresses of this situation, and to entreat that he would allow Sherlock to return to France with him and Madame Anderson. Then, suddenly remembering that beloved Bakersfield, his only home, was no longer at his command, his heart trembled anew, and he feared that he had little pity to expect from a man who, like M. Anderson, could dispose of it without deigning to consult with him, and could dismiss an aged and faithful servant, destitute of either support or asylum. But, though it was certain, that he had himself no longer a home in France, and few, very few friends there, he determined to return, if possible, that he might be released from the power of Moriarty, whose particularly oppressive conduct towards himself, and general character as to others, were justly terrible to his imagination.
Meanwhile, Molly did not appear, and Sherlock was surprised, and somewhat alarmed for her, whom, and it was improbable, that she would have failed to come to her apartment, unless something unfortunate had happened.
With a kiss that spoke the anguish of his heart, John seemed to force himself from the spot; he passed hastily up the avenue, and Sherlock, as he moved slowly towards the chateau, heard his distant steps. He listened to the sounds, as they sunk fainter and fainter, till the melancholy stillness of night alone remained; and then hurried to his chamber, to seek silence and solitude.
While Morstan remained concealed in his house, Moriarty was unwilling to attract public observation by the nuptials of Count Wilkes; but this obstacle was, in a few days, overcome by the departure of his criminal visitor, and he then informed Sherlock, that Morstan was to visit some mutual acquaintance; and further that his marriage was to be celebrated on the following morning. To Sherlock’s repeated assurances, that it should not take place, he replied only by a malignant smile; and, telling him that the Count and a priest would be at the house, early in the morning, he advised him to not endanger his friends, by continued opposition. 'I am now going out for the evening,' said he, 'remember, that I shall give your hand to Count Wilkes in the morning.'
“Ah, John, that’s lovely, thank you,” says Mrs. Hudson cheerily, beginning to rummage around in one of the cases.
“Some people who aren’t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others,” continues Sherlock, scrolling rapidly through his phone.
out of the 5 teams so far, briefly meeting John’s eyes. Fortunately, John was saved from having to respond by the entry of the Japanese team on to the floor.
“Hmm, I wonder what John has got in store for us today, hmmm?” says his father idly, finally putting his hat down on the floor. Sherlock himself is, well, perhaps not wholly immune to it - but that’s probably just the excitement of his incipient return to London talking.
Molly stood at the door, in an attitude of hesitation, with the light held up to shew the chamber, but the feeble rays spread through not half of it. 'Why do you hesitate?' said Sherlock, 'let me see whither this room leads.'
When the hour arrived, in which the remains of Holmes were to be taken for ever, he went alone to the chamber to look upon his father’s countenance yet once again; and with his back pressed to the wall of the room; he recalled his father’s advice not to become insensible; he felt its lie and its cruelty.  Caring was not advantageous.
'Oh, you mean THIS picture,' said Sherlock, with returning calmness. 'Well, Molly, here is nothing more to engage my attention; we will go.'
“Mmm,” replies Sieger, “I’ve got quite a few now. Getting them from volunteers and such when we visit an event, you know. Some of the chaps have got loads, hundreds, even,” he said, managing to sound both wistful and somehow disbelieving.
“Well, not all of them will make it back to Blighty, no,” said John, hand scrubbing through his hair again. “I wish I’d been roomed with Mike, he’s got this ‘Master of his own Domain’ thing going until his competition is over, you know? But then Henry would have been with Bill and my God, he’s just too young for that. I mean I know he’s 19 but he just seems about 14, you know? It would have been corruption of a minor, or something….”
It’s a slow, sensual drawl of female vocal and piano – but Sherlock is all male, prowling around the floor ball rolling down his body to be caught between his knees as he writhes on the floor. John crosses his legs and brings one hand up to cover his mouth.
They travelled leisurely; stopping wherever a scene uncommonly grand appeared; frequently alighting to walk to an eminence, whither the mules could not go, from which the prospect opened in greater magnificence; and often sauntering over hillocks covered with lavender, wild thyme, juniper, and tamarisc; and under the shades of woods, between those boles they caught the long mountain-vista, sublime beyond anything that Sherlock had ever imagined.
From the contemplation of this scene, Sherlock's mind proceeded to the apprehension of what he might suffer in it, till the remembrance of John, far, far distant! came to his heart, and softened it into sorrow. A heavy sigh escaped him: but, trying to conceal his emotion, he walked away to one of the high windows, that opened upon the ramparts, below which, spread the woods he had passed in the approach to the castle. But the night-shade sat deeply on the mountains beyond, and their indented outline alone could be faintly traced on the horizon, where a red streak yet glimmered in the west. The valley between was sunk in darkness.
'Yes, but—but she has a terrible wound, and could not come to let me out. They thought her dead, at first, and she has not been rightly herself, till within this hour.'
“And these” Sherlock said, finger underlining at a whole emoji series, “taken as a group, instruct Moran to ensure that I am no longer a problem.”

Sherlock pouts a little, feeling John bristle behind him. “Well, I’m not the one clubbing my team members, although that is perhaps because I have no team members… still, psychopath seems a bit harsh, wouldn’t you say?”
It led Sherlock to the door of a landing-place, that terminated them, but he was unable to follow it farther. Now that he was so near the sought-for certainty, he dreaded to know it, even more than before, and had not fortitude sufficient to speak, or to attempt opening the door.
As they bore closer, he hurried back to his chamber. Sherlock listened anxiously for Molly's step in the corridor, but a pause of total stillness continued, till again the castle seemed to be all tumult and confusion. He heard the echoes of many footsteps, passing to and fro in the halls and avenues below, and then busy tongues were loud on the rampart. Having hurried to his casement, he perceived Moriarty, with some of his officers, leaning on the walls, and pointing from them; while several soldiers were employed at the further end of the rampart about some cannon; and he continued to observe them, careless of the passing time.
“Won’t work on the judges, Watson!” hollered Lestrade. “Or on us, either, nice try though!” seconded Sally Donovan, next to Anthea who didn’t appear to have looked up from her phone at all.
Sherlock now held up the lamp to examine, if the chamber afforded a possibility of an escape. It was a spacious room, whose walls, wainscoted with rough oak, shewed no casement but the grated one, which Sherlock had left, and no other door than that, by which he had entered. The feeble rays of the lamp, however, did not allow him to see at once its full extent; he perceived no furniture, except, indeed, an iron chair, fastened in the centre of the chamber, immediately over which, depending on a chain from the ceiling, hung an iron ring. He gazed upon these with wonder and horror, next observing iron bars below, made for the purpose of confining the feet, and on the arms of the chair were rings of the same metal. As he continued to survey them, he concluded, that they were instruments of torture, and it struck him, that some poor wretch had once been fastened in this chair, and had there been starved to death. He was chilled by the thought; but, what was his agony, when, in the next moment, it occurred to him, that his brother might have been one of these victims, and that he might be the next! An acute pain seized his head, he was scarcely able to hold the lamp, and, looking round for support, was seating himself, unconsciously, in the iron chair itself; but suddenly perceiving where he was, he started from it in horror, and sprung towards a remote end of the room. Here again he looked round for a seat, and perceived only a dark curtain, which, descending from the ceiling to the floor, was drawn along the whole side of the chamber. Ill as he was, the appearance of this curtain struck him, and he paused to gaze upon it, in apprehension.
Twilight had now spread its gloom over every object; the dismal obscurity of his chamber recalled fearful thoughts, but he remembered, that to procure a light he must pass through a great extent of the castle, and, above all, through the halls, where he had already experienced so much horror. Darkness, indeed, in the present state of his spirits, made silence and solitude terrible; it would also prevent the possibility of his finding the way to the turret, and condemn him to remain in suspense, concerning the fate of his brother.
(a fancy ballet name for a solo) from Don Quixote.  Incredible, right?  Rope routines are not performed at Olympic level RG (boo) but here's Rubén Orihuela, the gymnast from yesterday's notes,
While he paused, the figure came opposite to his casement, and was stationary. Everything remained quiet; he had not heard even a foot-fall; and the solemnity of this silence, with the mysterious form he saw, subdued his spirits, so that Sherlock was moving away from the casement, when, on a sudden, he observed the figure start away, and glide down the rampart, after which it was soon lost in the obscurity of night. Sherlock continued to gaze, for some time, on the way it had passed, and then retired within his chamber, musing on this strange circumstance, and scarcely doubting, that he had witnessed a supernatural appearance.
The travellers frequently distinguished troops of soldiers moving at a distance; and they experienced, at the little inns on the road, the scarcity of provision and other inconveniences, which are a part of the consequence of intestine war; but they had never reason to be much alarmed for their immediate safety, and they passed on to Milan with little interruption of any kind, where they staid not to survey the grandeur of the city, or even to view its vast cathedral, which was then building.
John flushed, not so happily this time. “#runbabyrun #shakennotstirred. And then a whole bunch of emojis,” he muttered, tapping the phone against his knee.
“He almost fell there, Kate, not good at all for him, that’s his medal chance gone you would have to think… yes, he scores 14.866, so he is behind Watson and now unlikely to win a medal. His total is 90.230.”
.  Guys, it's the last chapter, and we're back where it all began at the Maracanã Stadium.  Are you ready?
The fire was now lighted; Carlo swept the hearth, placed chairs, wiped the dust from a large marble table that stood near it, and then left the room.  At length, in a tremulous voice, Sherlock said, 'May I ask the motive of this sudden journey?'—After a long pause, he recovered sufficient courage to repeat the question.
John’s trying to simultaneously crane his head up to examine a huge sculptural light fitting and look down at the union jack lit up on the stair treads; it’s hard not to be overawed. There are people everywhere; people in their Team GB uniforms; businesspeople in suits, official lanyards conspicuously displayed; white-jacketed waiters manhandling drinks trays. It all funnels out into a large colonnaded courtyard with a huge TV screen at one end that seems to be playing a mix of enthusiastic slogans and stock footage from tourism UK, as if people have never seen Piccadilly Circus before.
The man shrugs a little. “Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel ... uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.”
'We cannot be in worse hands than at present,' replied Sherlock, unguardedly; 'but besides, if this castle’s residents are all in such a fright, and a fuss; I don't know any thing but the fear of justice, that could make them so!'
“Ah, boys, excellent, I’ve got the coffees, let’s go in now before it starts again,” bustled Violet, huge sunhat flopping as she moves, tray of coffees in hand and a bottle of water tucked under one arm.
When the chimes had tolled another half hour, he once more opened the door, and, perceiving that no person was in the corridor, hastily crossed into a passage, that led along the south side of the castle towards the stair-case, whence he believed he could easily find her way to the turret. Often pausing on the way, listening apprehensively to the murmurs of the wind, and looking fearfully onward into the gloom of the long passages, he, at length, reached the stair-case; but there more perplexity began. Two passages appeared, of which he could not deduce the correct way, and was compelled, at last, to decide by chance. That he entered, opened first into a wide gallery, along which he passed lightly and swiftly; for the lonely aspect of the place awed him, and he started at the echo of her own steps.
Hatefully, some of his confusion must show on his face, because Mike starts making little shooing motions at him.
They had to cross two courts, towards the east wing of the castle, which, adjoining the chapel, was, like it, in ruins: but the silence and gloom of these courts had now little power over Sherlock's mind, occupied as it was, with more mournful ideas; and he scarcely heard the low and dismal hooting of the night-birds, that roosted among the ivyed battlements of the ruin, or perceived the still flittings of the bat, which frequently crossed the way. But, when, having entered the chapel, and passed between the mouldering pillars of the aisles, the bearers stopped at a flight of steps, that led down to a low arched door, and, their comrade having descended to unlock it, he saw imperfectly the gloomy abyss beyond;—saw the corpse of his last relation carried down these steps, and the ruffian-like figure, that stood with a torch at the bottom to receive it—all his fortitude was lost in emotions of inexpressible grief and terror. He lingered so long on the summit of the flight, that the gleam of the torch began to die away on the pillars of the chapel, and the men were almost beyond view. Then, the gloom around him awakening other fears, he descended to the vaults, following the echo of footsteps and the faint ray, that pierced the darkness, till the harsh grating of a distant door, that was opened to receive the corpse, again appalled him.
'It is very odd!' said Bertolini. 'Here is really no stranger in the room. If it is a trick, Signor, you will do well to punish the author of it severely.'
'Count Wilkes,' said Moran, who had hitherto silently observed him, 'dare again to insult my friend, and I will plunge this sword in your body.'
The man made a vague hum of agreement, looking above John’s head at the crowd as it wound through the serpentine barriers, slowly being funnelled out to the stadium floor. “Rings or the High Bar?”
Occupied by melancholy reflections and by anticipations as sad, he did not retire to rest, but leaned thoughtfully on his open casement. The scene before him of woods and mountains, reposing in the moon-light, formed a regretted contrast with the state of his mind; but the lonely murmur of these woods, and the view of this sleeping landscape, gradually soothed his emotions, which found relief in quiet tears.
Moriarty being now certain that these were the bands of the victorious Utaldo, leaned from the carriage window, and hailed their general by waving his cap in the air; which compliment the chief returned by raising his spear, and then letting it down again suddenly, while some of his officers, who were riding at a distance from the troops, came up to the carriage, and hailed Moriarty as an old acquaintance. The captain himself soon after arriving, his bands halted while he conversed with Moriarty, whom he appeared much uneasy to see; and from what he said, Sherlock understood that this was a victorious army, returning into their own principality; while the numerous waggons, that accompanied them, contained the rich spoils of the enemy, their own wounded soldiers, and the prisoners they had taken in battle, who were to be ransomed when the peace, then negotiating between the neighbouring states, should be ratified. The chiefs on the following day were to separate, and each, taking his share of the spoil, was to return with his own band to his castle. This was therefore to be an evening of uncommon and general festivity, in commemoration of the victory they had accomplished together, and of the farewell which the commanders were about to take of each other.
'It is too late,' said Moriarty; 'but since it is so, I am pleased to observe, that you submit to reason and necessity without indulging useless complaint. When you are older you will look back with gratitude to the friends who assisted in rescuing you from the romantic illusions of sentiment, and will perceive, that they are only the snares of childhood, and should be vanquished the moment you escape from the nursery. I have not closed my letter, and you may add a few lines to inform your uncle of your acquiescence. You will soon see him, for it is my intention to take you, with Madame Moriarty, in a few days to Miarenti, and you can then talk over the affair.' So saying, he presented Sherlock with the reverse side of the paper he had been writing on, and Sherlock wrote as follows:
'If you will not release yourself from the slavery of these fears,' said Moriarty, sternly, 'at least forbear to torment others by the mention of them. Conquer such whims, and endeavour to strengthen your mind. No existence is more contemptible than that, which is embittered by fear.' As he said this, his eye glanced upon Mycroft, who coloured highly, but was still silent.  The breakfast party broke up shortly after; Moriarty, went out to examine further into the state of the castle; while Monsieur Mycroft withdrew to his dressing-room.
A gleam of moonlight that fell upon Wilkes's countenance, revealed the strong emotions of his soul; and, glancing on Moriarty discovered the dark resentment, which contrasted his features.
For reasons I cannot adequately explain, Princess Anne is one of my favorite royals.  An Olympian herself, she has a
Molly hastened from the room; and Sherlock prepared for this unexpected flight, as fast as his trembling hands would permit, not perceiving, that any change in his situation could possibly be for the worse. He had scarcely thrown his books and clothes into the travelling trunk, when, receiving a second summons, he went down to his brother’s dressing-room, where he found Moriarty impatiently reproving his husband for delay. He went out, soon after, to give some further orders to his people, and Sherlock then enquired the occasion of this hasty journey; but Mycroft appeared to be as ignorant also, and to undertake the journey with more reluctance.
“And welcome back to the Rio Olympic Arena on this, the climactic day of the artistic gymnastics competition.  You’ll be absolutely bound to the TV screens at home this evening with three gold medals up for grabs, including the competition that’s been made so much of over the build up to these games, the one the audience will be absolutely begging for, and that’s the women’s floor final with the extraordinary Simone Biles.”
'Who told you, that Monsieur Mycroft was dead?' said Moriarty, with an inquisitive eye. Sherlock hesitated, for nobody had told him so, and he did not dare to avow the having seen that spectacle in the portal-chamber, which had compelled him to the belief.
Molly advanced reluctantly. It opened into a suite of spacious and ancient apartments, some of which were hung with tapestry, and others wainscoted with cedar and black larch-wood. What furniture there was, seemed to be almost as old as the rooms, and retained an appearance of grandeur, though covered with dust, and dropping to pieces with the damps, and with age.
“Going behind your coach’s back? Not sure I can support that,” said John, looking over at Sarah as if he was scandalised at the very thought.
He fixed a terrified look upon Molly, who, intending to quiet him, said 'Yes, sir, it was more than a dream, but it is all over now.'
“No offence mate,” said Bill, raising his hands in the air, “just interested in how we’re all growing up, that’s all. Was a bit different back in London village, Sherlock, you see,” Bill continued, John feeling Sherlock stiffen next to him. “Little Three Continents here got around.”
The sun now sunk below the horizon, twilight fell over the landscape, and Sherlock, wrapt in musing silence, continued to watch its features gradually vanishing into obscurity. He remembered many happy evenings, when with Holmes he had observed the shades of twilight steal over a scene as beautiful as this, from the gardens of Bakersfield.  It did not cheer him -  it now seemed to his oppressed mind, that he had taken leave of home, and of John, for ever, and that the countries, which separated them, would never more be re-traced by him. Though he knew, that neither Wilkes's solicitations, nor Moriarty's commands had lawful power to enforce his obedience, he regarded both with a superstitious dread, that they would finally prevail.
“Yes,” says John, caught slightly off guard. “In fact, I’ll be seeing some of the rhythmic gymnastics qualification today if I make it back over there in time.” Connie laughs like John pointing at the Arena, clearly visible from the balcony, was a funny joke.
Fourteen days ago, Sherlock was leaning into his ear and spilling all of John’s secrets to him without having spoken a single word to him before. And in those fourteen days since, John had seen him do miracles again and again, lightning mind contained inside a body of power and grace, a body that John had had his hands and lips and skin on. Miracles.
Sherlock, extremely surprised and shocked, had scarcely power to beg an explanation of these words, and, when he did, his brother absolutely refused to give it, though, by severe looks, and half sentences, he appeared anxious to impress Sherlock with a belief, that he was well informed of some degrading circumstances of his conduct. Conscious innocence could not prevent a blush from stealing over Sherlock's cheek; he started, and looked confusedly under the bold eye of Monsieur Mycroft, who blushed also; but Mycroft’s was the blush of triumph, such as sometimes stains the countenance of a person, congratulating himself on the penetration which had taught him to suspect another, and who loses both pity for the supposed criminal, and indignation of his guilt, in the gratification of his own vanity.
He doubted, listened, raised himself from the floor, and again listened. It was music, and not an illusion of his imagination. After a solemn steady harmony, it paused; then rose again, in mournful sweetness, and then died, in a cadence, that seemed to bear away the listening soul to heaven. Sherlock instantly remembered the music of the preceding night, with the strange circumstances, related by La Voisin, concerning the state of departed spirits. All that Holmes had said, on that subject, now pressed upon his mind, and overwhelmed it. What a change in a few hours! His father, who then could only conjecture, was now made acquainted with truth; was himself become one of the departed!
“Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear! Not in London, there’s all sorts round. Mrs. Turner next door’s got married ones,” she says, dropping her voice to a whisper by the end of the sentence.
“Anderson, don’t talk out loud. You lower the IQ of the whole stadium,” said the plummy voice. John struggled not to snort.
is an extremely swish hotel, if you'd not already assumed. This conversation takes place in this rather special dining space:
'This trifling is insupportable,' said Sherlock; 'prythee, Molly, do not torture my patience any longer.'
“The pressure’s really on with this routine Kate, this was his worst performance in the qualifications and he really seemed to struggle with some of the rope movements, not as defined and crisp as they should have been.  Probably a bit harder for him given he is one of, if not the tallest competitors here at these games, so his length of rope will be longer, requiring sharper, rapid movements to keep the rope tense. Of course the last routine showcased his excellent ball skills and a superb score, he’ll need to at least equal that though to have a shot at the medals here.”
At length, Moriarty, who seemed amused by Sherlock’s tale, dismissed him with this concession—That he would not remove Monsieur Mycroft tonight, but allow him till the next to consider, whether he would resign the settlements, or be imprisoned in the east turret of the castle, 'where he shall find,' Moariarty added, 'a punishment he may not expect.'
As Sherlock drew near the apartment, in which Moriarty sat with his guests, he heard them in earnest and loud dispute, and he paused, listening. In the next, their voices sunk all together; after some moments of fruitless listening, Sherlock then ventured to open the door, and, while Moriarty turned hastily and looked at him, Sherlock delivered his message.
A track of blood appeared along the corridor, leading to it; and on the spot, where the Count and Moriarty had fought, the whole floor was stained. When he reached the apartment, he instantly determined, since the door of the stair-case had been left open, and that Molly was now with him, to explore whither it led,—a circumstance now materially connected with his own safety. Molly accordingly, half curious and half afraid, proposed to descend the stairs; but, on approaching the door, they perceived, that it was already fastened without, and their care was then directed to the securing it on the inside also, by placing against it as much of the heavy furniture of the room, as they could lift. Molly then retired to bed, and Sherlock continued on a chair by the hearth, where some feeble embers remained.
“Oh!” said John. “Was that at the Ballet National de Marseille?” asked John, going for a casual tone. “Sherlock’s told me about his time there”. Victor looked stunned.
The Count, meanwhile, having slowly recovered, the first object he saw, on raising his eyes, was Sherlock, bending over him. Wilkes surveyed him with a look of anguish.
Moriarty paused, and turned half round, but, seeming to recollect himself, he proceeded in a lower tone.
Mike fumbles around the cushions for his tracksuit bottoms. “Sorry,” he says sheepishly. “Anderson managed to pull last night and I don’t want to be anywhere near that. Cheers,” he yawns, reaching for the cup of tea Bill hands him. “Been lucky so far though. He’s been pretty quiet, really.”
Mycroft impatiently interrupted him. 'Unfeeling, cruel boy!' said he, 'and so you would persuade me, that I have no reason to complain; that the Signor is in very flourishing circumstances, that my future prospects promise nothing but comfort, and that my griefs are as fanciful and romantic as your own! Is it the way to console me, to endeavour to persuade me out of my senses and my feelings, because you happen to have no feelings yourself? I thought I was opening my heart to a person, who could sympathize in my distress, but I find, that you can feel for nobody but yourself! You may retire to your chamber.'
“Not telling,” John said, tucking the phone away. Sherlock finally turned from the window to give John a penetrating stare. “No, it’s a secret. Figure it out on your own.”
'It is my will that you remain here,' said Moriarty, laying his hand on the door to go; 'let that suffice you.'
Holmes enquired of Michael the distance to the hamlet he had mentioned, but the man could not with certainty tell; and Sherlock began to fear that he had mistaken the road. Here was no human being to assist, or direct them; and the scene became so obscured in twilight, that Sherlock could not follow the distant perspective of the valley to deduce the presence of a cottage, or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon still marked the west, and this was of some little use to the travellers. Michael seemed endeavouring to keep up his courage by singing; his music, however, was not of a kind to disperse melancholy; he sung, in a sort of chant, one of the most dismal ditties his audience had ever heard, and Holmes at length discovered it to be a vesper-hymn to his favourite saint.
. His projections were shamefully inaccurate. First the Romanian and then the Russian each scoring over 1.5 points over his calculations. His study had been incomplete. The rulebook had been child’s play to understand (curse his mother for looking at his hair) but he’d had insufficient study of the competitor’s routines (Mrs Hudson confiscating his laptop from the ceiling – curse her twice!). At this rate he would be reduced to finding out the score as the judges posted it, like some sort of, of…
'Signor Moriarty,' replied Sherlock. 'I would speak with him;' and Molly, now remembering the order he had given, on the preceding night, respecting Sherlock’s condition, rose, and said she would seek him herself.
'Who was the prisoner?' enquired Sherlock, while his thoughts glanced back to the circumstance of the preceding night.
During his stay at this pleasant villa, Sherlock was thus rendered miserable by the assiduities of Wilkes, together with the cruelly exerted authority of M. Anderson and Moriarty, who, with his brother, seemed now more resolutely determined upon this marriage than they had even appeared to be at Venice. M. Anderson, finding, that both argument and menace were ineffectual in enforcing an immediate conclusion to it, at length relinquished his endeavours, and trusted to the power of Moriarty and to the course of events at Venice. Sherlock, indeed, looked to Venice with hope, for there he would be relieved in some measure from the persecution of Wilkes, who would no longer be an inhabitant of the same house, and from that of Moriarty, whose engagements would not permit him to be continually at home. But amidst the pressure of his own misfortunes, he did not forget those of poor Mrs. Hudson, for whom he pleaded with to Anderson, who promised, in slight and general terms, that she should not be forgotten.
“Yes, you’ll take this one, John,” said Mary, missing John’s side-eye at Sherlock as he obediently took the offered phone.
'What enemy can be coming?' continued his husband. 'Have you entered into the service of the state? Am I to be blocked up here to die?'
'I am not so sure of that,' said Barnardine, propelling Sherlock to the room he had opened: 'Get in here, while I step up.'
In another part of his letter he wrote thus. 'You see my letter is dated on many different days, and, if you look back to the first, you will perceive, that I began to write soon after your departure from France. To write was, indeed, the only employment that withdrew me from my own melancholy, and rendered your absence supportable, or rather, it seemed to destroy absence; for, when I was conversing with you on paper, and telling you every sentiment and affection of my heart, you almost appeared to be present. This employment has been from time to time my chief consolation, and I have deferred sending off my packet, merely for the comfort of prolonging it, though it was certain, that what I had written, was written to no purpose till you received it. Whenever my mind has been more than usually depressed I have come to pour forth its sorrows to you, and have always found consolation; and, when any little occurrence has interested my heart, and given a gleam of joy to my spirits, I have hastened to communicate it to you, and have received reflected satisfaction. Thus, my letter is a kind of picture of my life and of my thoughts for the last month, and thus, though it has been deeply interesting to me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope will, for the same reason, be not indifferent to
“Oh my God, Bill, tell me. Was it that awful?” John looked imploringly at his long-time training partner and roomie from the London Olympic village.
“No no, it’s Tallinn. It’s simply marvellous, you put in your word and then they do it on their end and –“
Sherlock and John continue their investigations.  At least Sherlock does - John's just trying to keep up.
'This was a favourite tree with my dear father,' said he; 'he used to love to sit under its foliage with his family about him, in the fine evenings of summer.'
“Oh, I have some,” Sherlock replied, fishing out an expensive-looking tube from his bag and squeezing some on to his palm.
without apparatus, as well as individual routines with apparatus (two hoops, clubs, and stick).  There are some men that compete with the same apparatus as women, mainly in France and Spain.  The Spanish gymnastics governing body has a division for men in the RG competition where it's dominated by Rubén Orihuela (below +
Another minibus has pulled up behind theirs and starts disgorging more navy and red clad athletes, all adjusting their suits or framing up a photo. “Ready, Captain?” says Bill with a slap on his shoulder. “Let’s go sell us a country and not have any drinks. Or something,” he finishes before starting up the stairs to the entrance.
'Why call me impudent?' said the man, 'I would remove you from this dreary solitude to a merry party below. Do you not know me?'
'What is that?' said Holmes, roused again from thoughtfulness. As his host repeated his last sentence, a groan escaped from Holmes, and then, as if anxious to prevent it from being noticed, he hastily asked La Voisin how long he had lived in this neighbourhood. 'Almost from my childhood, sir,' replied his host.
He distinguished, till a late hour, the distant carousals of Moriarty and his companions—the loud contest, the dissolute laugh and the choral song, that made the halls re-echo. At length, he heard the heavy gates of the castle shut for the night, and those sounds instantly sunk into a silence, which was disturbed only by the whispering steps of persons, passing through the galleries to their remote rooms. Sherlock now judging it to be about the time, when he had heard the music, on the preceding night, and gently opened the casement to watch for its return. The planet he had so particularly noticed, at the recurrence of the music, was not yet risen; but, with superstitious weakness, he kept his eyes fixed on that part of the hemisphere, where it would rise, almost expecting, that, when it appeared, the sounds would return. At length, it came, serenely bright, over the eastern towers of the castle. Every thing, however, remained still; he heard only the solitary step of a sentinel, and the lulling murmur of the woods below, and he again leaned from the casement, and again looked, as if for intelligence, to the planet, which was now risen high above the towers.
“Just a brace?  Dislocated patella, was it?” Sarah nodded.  “Could’ve been worse…” John mused, hand rubbing the back of his neck. “…But this bruising’s pretty intense. Swollen, too. Looks like you’ve gone five rounds with a wall. Must hurt,” he winced sympathetically.
