“I don’t know what you want to hear, Dean,” John replied gruffly, rubbing a hand over his chin as he stared back at Dean, his eyes dark. “I can’t stop people from leaving. This isn't a prison.”
"Got the book," Dean said, holding it up as Cas smiled warmly, scooting over to make room for Dean. Dean sank into bed next to him, making sure they were both comfortable. With the flashlight on, Dean turned to the chapter they left off on and started reading, keeping his voice down enough for only Cas to hear, slowly lulling him to sleep. Dean read for almost an hour, occasionally glancing down at Cas to see those blue eyes watching him, blinking slowly. The last time he glanced at Cas, the angel was finally sleeping. Dean sighed quietly, turning off the flashlight and closing the book. He set them both on the table beside the bed, easing himself off the mattress so he didn't wake Cas.
Dean frowned, turning his head to glare at the angel, but he wasn't even looking at Dean. He was still checking out pants, holding them up to his waist and stretching them out as if he could figure out Dean's size just from doing that. "I liked you better when you hardly talked," Dean grumbled, though they both knew that was a lie. Dean had opened up so much more since Cas started having actual conversations with him. He didn't share his most personal secrets, ones that even Sammy didn't know, but he talked a lot. He told Cas about his mom and how she died. He talked about raising Sammy and how they took care of each other during the apocalypse. He told Cas a lot of things he never thought he'd talk about with another person.
Dean carefully sat their bags of food on the ground next to the rack of suit jackets, giving Cas an odd look. "How is this supposed to help?" he wondered, watching Cas take a red jacket off a hanger to examine the clothing.
"I'm fine, Cas!" Dean promised, trying his best to smile at him, but Charlie pressed her fingers into his arm and he cried out in pain instead.
"D-Dean," Cas breathed, slowly opening his eyes, looking down at Dean's hand on his chest, holding him, grounding him. Cas swallowed, leaning his head back against Dean's chest, feeling his breathing.
“Are you okay?” Cas asked, breaking the comfortable silence. He slid closer to Dean, attaching himself to Dean’s side as his hand rested on Dean’s thigh, just a gentle touch. “You went somewhere else for a moment there.”
,” the voice called, small and quiet. Dean glanced at the man in the suit for a second longer, but he couldn’t not turn around to investigate the weak plea for help. He pivoted on his foot, following the sounds of labored breathing. It took a few seconds of searching each bush and behind a few trees, but soon Dean found her. Kaia was curled up at the base of a large tree, her face bloody and bruised. She had her arms wrapped around herself tight, her eyes closed as she let out a few shaky breaths.
"Goodnight! Stay safe out there!" he called after them, catching the kisses Charlie blew to him. He waited until they were walking up the stairs to Charlie's before closing the door and locking it for the night. With that out of the way, he found his way into the bedroom, quietly changing his pants and not bothering with the shirt. The sun was finally down and it was dark enough for Dean to fall asleep. He crawled into bed next to Cas, trying not to wake him. Once he was under the covers, Cas gravitated towards him until he was pretty much laying on top of Dean, clinging onto his neck as he snored softly in Dean's ear. Oddly enough, Dean didn't mind. It gradually lulled him to sleep.
Dean shook his head, glancing back at the front door, as if Cas would just walk right outside and sit down next to him like Dean hadn't just freaked out and run off half an hour before. "No, there's also my-" he paused, his mind filtering through all the words he could use to describe Castiel. Finally, he settled on, "my friend, Castiel. He has a nephew, Jack, who lives with us too. Just us four."
"Yeah," Dean croaked, watching the ground in front of him as his boots slapped against the sidewalk.
He felt so ashamed, letting Cas comfort him like this after everything he had just said to his dad. He knew he had to say it, but it felt so wrong. Still, he let Cas hold him, his grip tight, but it felt so good. “I’ve got you,” Cas promised, saying it over and over, the soft whisper ghosting over his ear, soothing his racing heart. “It’s all going to be okay.”
Dean snorted, leaning against the doorframe. "Sure, Jack. I don't see why not," he agreed, jumping as someone came up behind him, a strong hand on his shoulder. Suddenly, Cas was next to him in the doorway, inches between them as they looked over Jack the same way John and Mary used to check in on Dean when he was little. They would stand together in the doorway, watching Dean as he tired himself out by babbling about whatever his little head could come up with.
After a fifteen minute walk of John explaining things about the neighborhood, they finally came to a stop in front of a small brick house. John led them up the stairs and they waited on the porch after he knocked a couple times. Dean felt anxious, knowing he was about to see Bobby after ten years of thinking the old man was dead. He was afraid their relationship wouldn't be the same as it used to be, but he knew he was just being stupid. As Dean worried himself into a slight panic attack, the front door creaked open, revealing an older woman with a serious expression set on her face. For a moment, she stared at John, and then her eyes wandered to Dean and Sam, and then Castiel and Jack behind them.
"It was- was really good," Dean stammered, closing his eyes as Cas moved even closer, his hand brushed over Dean's hair. "Spent the morning with the kid before he ditched me for his friends. Then I- uh, I went to Bobby's and told him-" he paused to open his eyes, only met by the sight of Cas' crotch right in front of him, straining against the denim pants. He swallowed, trying to continue with his story. "Um, I told him about us and he said he wants to have dinner with us sometime, get to know you without my dad ruining it for everyone. And then-"
"Breathe with me," Dean instructed, his voice as gently as his lips against Cas' ear, just barely there, ghosting across his skin. "Let me feel your chest rise and fall," he continued, talking Cas through his panic. Cas nodded, matching Dean's breaths, focusing on the feeling of Dean's hands on his chest, his strong fingers pressing into his skin. "That's good, Cas," Dean breathed, planting a kiss against Castiel's neck, a quick gesture, but it worked. Cas leaned back into Dean, taking another deep breath. For awhile, they stayed like that, just like before. Dean continued holding him until he was sure Cas was okay. "You okay?" Dean asked.
Cas shook his head, turning away from Dean for a moment to grab pain medicine. "You're injured and exhausted. You shouldn't be wielding a gun, especially around other people."
Dean stared at his feet as he shook his head, trying to reel in his anger and keep it from hurting anyone but the intended target. “Trust me, the son of a bitch who took him. . . he ain’t gonna be alive much longer.” Dean gave Ellen a stiff smile and pushed his chair in, giving Sam a small wave towards the door. “Give Bobby that message. Stay inside the wall. Everything’s gonna be fine!”
Cas smiled softly, grabbing one end of the deep blue tie to slide it off his neck, holding it in his hands for a moment as he stared at it. Finally, he folded up again, silent as Dean watched his every move. When he held it out to Dean, there was a brief moment of panic in Dean's chest. What was he doing? "Keep it," was all Cas said, taking Dean's hand to force the meaningless piece of fabric into his grip. Dean wasn't sure how to respond, so he didn't. Instead, he took the tie and swallowed hard, glancing at Cas just to be sure.
The next morning, after breakfast, the four of them split ways to get to work. Sam and Dean walked together towards the gate where they first saw this place, meeting up with a small group of people. Dean recognized some of them from the first day, when they ambushed Sam and Jack at the house. John and Bobby were also there, chatting up a storm with the others. When they saw Sam and Dean, they cut their conversation short and waved them over with big smiles.
Cas hesitated, suddenly a little worried about having Dean in his room. He quickly shut down those negative thoughts and straightened his back, trying to look more confident so Dean would stop giving him that worried look. "My room," he answered, gesturing for Dean to follow him. He led the way through the house, down the hallway until he made it to his room and pushed the door open. He was glad he had the motivation to clean today, otherwise this would have been really embarrassing.
“We want to help,” Jo said, dragging Charlie along beside her. Charlie’s head was all clean and bandaged up, but she still had that guilty look on her face. Jo seemed to be more put together, in the same boat as Sam. “We can help look for him.”
Once they were far enough away from the others, Dean let Jo back on her feet so he didn’t fuck up his arm even more than it already was. He groaned in pain as he rolled his shoulder, trying to work the pain out of his muscle. “Charlie’s gonna have to give me some kind of medicine,” he sighed, hoping to keep his arm out of that stupid sling. He couldn’t really do what he wanted to do tonight with that thing on, so it was out of the question.
"Damn, Cas, you never told me you were this much of a freaking genius," Dean Winchester laughed, looking over the answers to the calculus homework as if he even understood them. "You got today's homework in here? I haven't done it yet," he continued, flipping through the pages of Cas' notebook without even asking. Dean never asked for permission. He just took what he wanted, when he wanted, and no one ever told him no. "I think I'll be taking this. Thanks, man." The 'thanks' was pure sarcasm, but Cas didn't say anything. He let Dean take his notebook without objection, eyes staring straight ahead at the white board as Dean walked away to join his friends in the back of the room.
"Well, I can't watch you 24/7," she started, wiggling her eyebrows. "Which means. . . you'll be listening to Castiel's every word for the next few weeks until you're healed." The way she said it, Dean knew she was insinuating a lot more than she was letting on. He gulped, refusing to say anything. "That's right. He's in charge of you. He'll be taking care of you when I'm not around."
Dean rolled his eyes. “I’ve already promised you that, but I’ll do it again,” he conceded, just to make Cas feel better. “I promise to not be reckless.” Cas smiled gratefully and Dean shooed him away with a loving smile. Once he was safely inside with Charlie, Dean started the trek over to the gate to meet up with Sam and Bobby.
"No," Cas answered, and suddenly his fingers grabbed Dean's, intertwining them easily, no resistance from Dean at first, mostly because he was so confused about what was happening. "I think this could help you."
"You're awake!" he observed, a smile lighting up his face as he pawned off the dinner plates into Charlie's arms. "How do you feel?" he asked, rushing to Dean's side to fuss over him, putting a hand on Dean's head, his cheeks, holding his face dramatically as Dean rolled his eyes.
Charlie breathed a small laugh, shaking her head. "Guess you're getting past that honeymoon phase," she teased, and Dean chuckled, thinking about how right she was. Their friendship did have that phase, where everything seemed so perfect and Dean didn't want to mess it up. Yet here he was, screwing up everything. "This is a new environment. You're both adjusting to new things. Just give it time. And Dean?" she continued, giving him a judgy look as he raised an eyebrow to say what? She grinned, patting him on the back. "Just make sure you're communicating. That's the key to a healthy relationship."
Dean snorted, attaching his lips to Cas’ neck in response. Cas let out a sharp breath, hiking Dean’s shirt further up his back to access more skin. “Not right now,” Dean mumbled against Cas’ neck, mouthing at his sensitive spots just to hear Cas’ breath hitch and to feel his fingers dig into the small of Dean’s back. “We hardly ever have alone time like this. I was hoping we could do. . . something else.” Despite the darkness, he just knew his face was red. He hadn’t had sex in over ten years, so yeah, he was a little nervous about it.
“You found that girl?” Bobby asked, keeping his voice down so only the few of them who were there could easily hear.
“Last night, my memories started to return,” she began, fidgeting uncomfortably as she leaned against the side of the house, making a point to avoid looking Dean in the eye. “I remember who took me. I’m not sure how to tell you this, but-” she cut herself off, nervously glancing up at Dean for only a second.
“It’s the job we’re doing,” Sam retorted, still calm, yet there was a firmness in his voice that Dean didn’t hear from him often. “Dean,” Sam said, never tearing his hard gaze from John, as if daring him to say something else. “Let’s go.”
“Yeah, Bobby, of course,” Sam sighed, frustrated. “I just hate this. Every day we don’t do something, dad has the chance to hurt more people. He’s a murderer.”
, Cas,” Dean mumbled into the angel’s mouth, throwing his head back as Cas pulled away, attaching his lips to Dean’s neck instead. Dean blinked a few times, making sure this wasn’t some kind of dream, because it sure as hell didn’t feel real. “Are you sure you want to do this here?” Dean found himself asking, his voice wavering as Cas somehow unhooked the button on Dean’s pants, shoving them as far as they would go past Dean’s thighs.
"I need a favor," Dean requested, nervously shifting on his feet. Jo raised an eyebrow. "I need you to get us out of dinner with our parents tonight."
“Yeah, my best friend,” Jo shared, a small smile lighting up her pretty features. “Kind of like you and Cas. He is your best friend, right?” And of course, if there was any way possible for it to end up being about Cas, that’s right where the conversation would go. Especially when he was trying to avoid it the most.
“Dean, thank god you’re back,” she said, a flash of relief on her face before she went right back to looking completely hysterical. “It’s Charlie. Your dad is trying to arrest her. He’s saying she stole something!”
Claire laughed a little, seeming to relax now that she knew Kaia was safe. "Okay, thank you," she sighed, letting Jo lead her out the door.
"I brought you food," he said, shoving a plate into Dean's lap. "You need to eat before we can go home."
"I'm glad you haven't," Dean answered honestly, still a hot mess underneath Cas, his words barely above a whisper. "Means you're all mine," he said, making Cas blush furiously, even though he was the one who had the upper hand here. "You look so good sucking my cock, Cas. So fucking good," he continued praising him, and Cas felt the heat creeping up his neck, at a loss for words. "You wanna make me come with your mouth, don't you?" he continued, and Cas got the hint, dropping his head back between Dean's legs, teasing his tongue over Dean's head, eliciting a moan from deep in Dean's throat.
“I don’t want you getting hurt,” Cas retorted firmly, wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders tightly. “I thought we were done arguing about this?”
Jo hesitated, still smirking. "Oh, I see," she hummed, her hands settling on her hips. "You're gonna let him fuck your brains out, aren't you?"
"Christ, of course, Dean," John grumbled, and they finally started moving again. Jo apologized profusely the whole time they were walking back and Dean had to keep assuring her it was fine, that he told her to do it, and he knew what he was doing. He even laughed when she told him she'd understand if he didn't want to go on a date with her now. He assured her it would take more than shooting him to piss him off, which made her laugh. Dean knew they'd be fine.
"I know," Dean cut him off, feeling guilty for bringing it up. It was Dean's fault that Cas didn't stay with him. Dean was the one afraid of involving Sam and Jack out of fear of what John would do if he knew they were helping hide Dean's relationship with a dude. "How do you always manage to wake up before Sam anyways?" Dean wondered, trying to sound more light hearted to get the frown off of Cas' face.
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat, glancing over at Cas as his heart dropped into his stomach. He looked terrible, like he was on the edge of death. "Yeah, that's all I want," Dean faltered, meeting Crowley's eyes again. "I just want him to live. John is all yours. I'll deliver him to you myself."
"Cas, I think it's break time," Dean announced, throwing his packet on the bed behind him. Cas was currently working through a word problem, so he ignored Dean for a moment to finish it. Dean, however, didn't appreciate being ignored because he grabbed the paper from Cas' hands, ripping his attention away from the problem. Cas started to object and grab it back, but Dean held it out of Castiel's reach. "Break time, dude," he repeated, tossing the papers next to his own. "I'm starving. It's dinner time."
“Plenty of times,” Dean assured him. “Sam’s accident prone, so I’ve stitched him up more than once. Just trust me.” He carefully took the bandages off Cas’ head and cleaned the fresh blood from the wound with an alcohol soaked towel. Cas winced, his face contorted in pain. “Hey, you’ve got to keep your face relaxed while I have the needle near your brain,” Dean teased, but he was completely serious. Cas didn’t think it was funny and the frown on his lips stayed firmly in place. Dean cleared his throat, prepping the needle by cleaning it as best he could with what little he had. “I’d let you squeeze my hand, but I need both of them,” he sighed. Not to mention, holding his hand would only make Dean more nervous, for whatever reason.
“Dean,” Cas said, breaking the silence as he reached out to wrap a hand around Dean’s upper arm, tugging gently to turn him around. Dean flinched away from the touch, but faced Cas anyways. Cas looked back at him with sad eyes, pity on his face. “Dean, I’m sorry-”
Dean thought about it. He would be doing everyone in that neighborhood a service by keeping the wall up to make sure the monsters stayed out. The cost would be spending eternity in hell with only a good ten years left on earth with Cas and the rest of his family. Was it worth it? Maybe, but Dean was more selfish than he cared to admit. He didn't just want ten years with Cas. He wanted fifty. Maybe more, if that were possible. He wanted forever.
Castiel's stomach grumbled in reply before Cas could actually say anything. Dean smiled, stretching to kiss the top of Cas' head. "I suppose we should eat," Cas mumbled, pressing a warm kiss to Dean's neck before sitting up with a small wince. He stretched his arms, and then his back, and finally his neck. Dean watched his every move, mesmerized by how sexy this man in his bed was. He would never get tired of admiring his body and every time he thought about how Cas was really his, it made his whole face turn red.
"Alright, fine," Dean grumbled, shoving past the three of them to get to his bag of clothes. He couldn't win an argument anymore with the three of them teaming up against him. He grabbed a pair of pants and a shirt to sleep in from his bag, not bothering to wait for everyone to leave the living room before stripping down to put them off. Before he was completely changed, Sam and Jack had said their goodnights and trudged upstairs to get some sleep. Dean folded up his shirt and jeans, his hand catching on something in his pocket. He suddenly remembered Cas' tie that he folded up and put in his pocket. He grabbed it out, turning around to look at Cas, who was still in his regular clothes. "Here," he mumbled, stepping closer to the angel with a hesitant look on his face.
"Nothing," Cas answered, wiping the grin off his face. "The upstairs is clear too. We should eat something now. Dean's stomach is making odd noises," he teased, only making Dean's embarrassment worse. That's all they freaking did when they were all together. They ganged up on Dean just to embarrass him and Dean was definitely blaming Sam for all of it.
“Ellen, we’re really sorry, but we have to go,” Sam interrupted, shifting uncomfortably on his feet. “Someone we care about is in danger.”
Dean took the first leap, reeling Bobby in by the shoulders, wrapping him in a tight hug for a few seconds before they both pulled away. "Sam and me, we've been hiding out this whole time. When everything calmed down, we set out to find somewhere with more resources, ended up running into someone named Jody, and now here we are." He figured the sweet and short version was much easier than going into all the details about how they ended up here, and Bobby seemed to grasp it easy enough too.
Bobby hadn't changed much in ten years, Dean noticed. Most people would be different after surviving an apocalypse, but not Bobby Singer. He was still the same stubborn old man the Dean looked up to as a father figure. He still rolled his eyes when Dean said something absolutely stupid, and he still called Dean an idjit anytime he did something that Bobby disapproved of. The only thing different about the man was his wife, Ellen. Dean never thought Bobby would move on from his first wife, considering the horrible circumstances of her death. Bobby never talked about it and Dean never asked, just like they didn't talk about Mary. But now, Bobby was happy with Ellen. They had too much in common, the way neither of them took shit from anybody. They were both stubborn and they held out as long as possible, even in pointless arguments. It was amusing to watch from Dean's point of view.
“I couldn’t wait until we got home,” Cas admitted, not shy about it at all. Dean’s face was still burning just thinking about what they had just done, and meanwhile Cas was talking about it like it was nothing to him. The freaking virgin angel was handling this better than Dean.
“It was just a question,” John scoffed, puffing out his chest as he closed in on Cas, the two of them going head to head. Dean didn’t really want to break up a fight between his dad and his best friend, so he shoved a hand between them, gently pushing Cas behind him again. John’s angry scowl didn’t dissipate, but held steady as he continued glaring at Cas with a fire in his eyes. “Dean, you gonna just let him talk to me like that?” John demanded, his eyes jumping to Dean for defense.
," he practically begged. It had been years since Dean had done anything with another person. He'd jacked off plenty over the last ten years, especially when he had his own room at the bunker. Not so much anymore with three other people in the next room over, paper thin walls and doors with no locks on them. Somehow, that didn't matter to him now, with Cas' hands all over him.
They were only halfway back to the meeting place, Dean watching the toe of his shoes as he walked down the sidewalk, when he physically felt Sam tense up beside him. It was subtle, so Dean didn’t think much of it. But then Sam put a hand on Dean’s arm, his grip gradually tightening until Dean couldn’t get out of his hold.
The girl shifted on her feet, glancing at Jody with a scowl on her face. "Mom, let's just go. Clearly, these assholes are fine," she grumbled, turning away to walk towards the back door without another word. Dean shouldn't have felt good about embarrassing a teenager, but he couldn't help the little smirk on his face.
Dean swallowed another drink of water, accepting Cas' help to sit up in the bed. "The wall is down. We haven't lost anyone, have we? It's not safe here anymore." He had been out for a week, which meant there was a week with one less hunter out there to protect the innocent people John left behind. Dean had been thinking about them since he made the deal with Crowley.
Dean immediately saw Cas tense up out of the corner of his eye. Jack gave a small pout too, both indicating they didn't want to be separated from Sam and Dean. That was never the plan. Dean hated to let his father down, especially when he looked so excited to have his boys living with him again. But Dean wouldn't leave Cas and Jack alone, even if there was some supernatural barrier up to keep them safe.
Dean tried to find the words to respond to his brother, but Cas was still sitting so close. "He's fine, Sam," Cas answered for him, and Dean really appreciated it, even if Cas was the one to blame for his inability to speak. "Charlie gave him appropriate medical attention, stitched up the wounds, and he's out of commission for a few weeks until the wound is healed." Dean wanted to crawl into a hole or something because he could not understand how Cas was so calm and collected right now, unless Dean had just imagined that entire situation before Sam got there. What if it meant absolutely nothing to Cas?
Charlie took the stitches out next, which was a little uncomfortable, but nothing Dean hadn’t been through before. “If you can move your arm comfortably, I’ll allow you to go back to work tomorrow. But I want you to keep the sling with you so you can wear it when you’re not using the arm, got it?”
They grouped up right outside the gate, Jody in front of them, as if she were a tour guide or something. "This isn't really going to impact you guys, but I figured I should tell you, that way you can rest assured you're all going to be safe here," she started, turning slightly to gesture to the gate in front of them. "We have a sort of barrier here. A protection spell, if you will. Nothing supernatural can get inside. It protects the entire neighborhood, so there's no chance of anything happening to you while you're here."
Dean chuckled, checking the tape to make sure it still looked playable. "Sure, if this damn thing still works," he agreed, pushing the tape into the cassette player. He really wasn't sure it would work after years of gathering dust in the glove box, but surprisingly, the sounds of AC/DC soon started playing throughout the car. The smile that lit up Jack's face was contagious. "You like it?" Dean asked over the music.
Dean waved as he walked off towards his friends, smiling the whole time until Jack was no longer paying him any attention. He lingered for a moment, catching Claire's gaze accidentally. Instead of the murder eyes he expected from her, she smiled instead, a small gesture that Dean couldn't interpret. He returned it, giving her a small wave before getting the hell out of there, headed straight for Bobby's.
Dean had one more day of work before another day off. He needed to talk to Bobby and Sam and get a solid plan together. He had been careful not to talk to Sam about it while out hunting or patrolling, in case John happened to somehow be listening in. They needed to get together and go somewhere far away from the wall, somewhere John wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop and figure out their plan.
Cas was quiet for a minute, eventually turning to face Dean, bringing a hand up to rest on his cheek. “We’re going to get through this, Dean. All of us. Sam, Jack, the girls, Bobby, everyone. We’re going to be okay.”
It's Jo's turn to laugh now, a light sound that makes Dean smile. "They sound great," she argued, leading Dean off to the right, down a new path they hadn't explored yet. "I bet you annoy them as much as they annoy you, right?" she joked, making Dean roll his eyes.
Dean stumbled a little, but gained back his footing and stood his ground, even as she tried to push him. "Look, I know you're right, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about it," he complained, chuckling as she finally gave up on shoving him and instead crossed her arms over her chest with a small huff. "The second I go in there and face him, I'm going to forget everything I rehearsed in my head. I'm going to freeze up and piss him off even more. That's what I do, Charlie. I fuck things up."
"I-I'm not sure," Cas answered, his voice faltering. He struggled in Dean's grip, but Dean held on too tight for Cas to escape that easily.
"Would you consider keeping the spell up as part of our deal?" Dean asked in an accusing tone. He didn't think Crowley would be willing to give more than Cas' life in return for one soul, so he didn't ask.
"You'll like them," Cas promised, taking Dean's arm to drag him around to the car that had just pulled up to the gate, Jody in the driver's seat and Bobby in the passenger side. In the backseat, two guys Dean had never seen before. They all piled out and met Dean with smiles on their faces. "Dean, this is Jesse and Cesar," Cas introduced. "And this is Dean, our leader," Cas said to them, a proud smile on his face. It always made Dean blush when he talked about him like that, or when anyone really called him their leader, or their boss. He didn't want people to start seeing him like they saw John. He was wary of how he ran things.
Dean snorted, turning to a tie display a few feet away. "Yeah right," he answered, shaking his head. He wasn't about to strip off his pants in the middle of an abandoned clothing store just so Cas could make fun of how he looked in a suit. "Are you trying to objectify me, Cas?" he teased, running his fingers over a red tie, feeling the smooth silk between his thumb and index finger. It didn't feel the same as Cas' blue tie, which was still safely tucked away in Dean's bag at home. He wasn't sure why he kept it, but he did.
"Do you promise to tell me?" Cas grabbed a new bandage, pausing to look at Dean for an answer before putting it on Dean's hand.
Soon, class started, and Cas tried his best to pay attention. He kept his eyes on his teacher as she explained the rubric for the project they would be assigned today, but he kept hearing Dean and his friends laughing and joking around in the back of the room. He felt his hands shaking and he was beginning to feel a headache coming on. He just had to wait for partners to be assigned, then he could ask to go to the nurse. He could lay down for a class period, calm himself down, maybe put an ice pack on his head. He just needed to get away from Dean and his friends.
"He mentioned she's been distant lately," Dean started, trying to be vague as possible. Claire might not have come out to her family yet and Dean sure as hell wasn't about to come out to some random girl. "Said she needed someone she could trust to talk to and I think I could help," he explained, suddenly feeling a little nervous. What if she didn't believe him and then just told everyone he was a creep? Jody would kick his ass for sure.
Charlie left the door open as she walked back into the house for a moment, returning quickly with a set of keys. “Let’s take her to medical,” Charlie instructed, leading the way. Charlie set off at a brisk pace and Dean tried his best to keep up, but he’d been walking for hours with Kaia in his arms. By the time they made it to the building, his vision was starting to get blurry. He managed to make it into the back room to gently slip Kaia’s unconscious body onto the mattress before he collapsed onto a different bed, cradling his injured arm to his chest.
Somehow, Dean drifted off to sleep, despite not being able to clear his head of distracting thoughts. The sheer boredom just got the best of him and sleeping was a way to pass the time.
"You rang?" He shoved his hands in his pockets, as if this were just some routine stop for him on his busy schedule. He acted as if this were a normal day, just some minor inconvenience. "Your angel's looking a bit rough," he added, glancing down at Cas with a slight wince.
"I almost have it," she promised, wincing as Dean dug his heels into the mattress and tried to quiet his screams, though it wasn't helping much. He focused on Cas, on holding his hand, on those perfect lips against his skin. "A few more seconds," Charlie continued.
"Thank god that's done," Dean sighed, throwing himself back onto Cas' bed, all sprawled out with his hands behind his head, his legs spread out. "I mean, I'm glad we did the project, cause I got you, but I never wanna do that shit again," he complained, Cas moving closer to the bed as Dean talked.
"I'm well aware," Sam cut him off, the look on his face turning deadly serious. "I won't let anything happen to you guys."
This morning was no different, except Dean woke up before Cas for once. The sun shining through the window hurt his eyes, but he squinted his eyes to look at Cas, sleeping peacefully with his mouth hanging open in the most adorable way. Dean smiled, turning over on his back without looking away so he could stretch his good arm. They had gravitated apart some time in the middle of the night, but just like every other morning they woke up together, their legs were slotted together under the cover, keeping them inches apart. With a small sigh, Dean started prying himself away from the angel, making Cas groan and blindly reach out to grab at Dean's bare chest.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean grunted, throwing his head back as hard as possible, colliding with the monster’s skull with a sharp thwack. The thing rolled off of Dean in shock, at which point, Dean saw the werewolf start to lunge again. “Not so fast, asshole,” Dean growled, finally getting a grip on his gun as he pulled it out, shoving it into the werewolves chest. He didn’t waste any time releasing the bullet into the thing’s heart, watching the life leave it’s eyes as Dean shoved his gun back in his waistband, forcing himself to his feet. Jo was still standing off to the side, her gun down at her side. “Great first date, huh?” he laughed, still wincing from the pain in his arm.
“How’s the arm?” was the first thing John asked as Dean stepped into the room. The older man was leaning against the door, hands casually stuffed into his pockets, a natural smile on his face. Dean relaxed slightly. He knew his father well, even without seeing him for ten years. This wasn’t how he acted when he was angry or disappointed. This was John in a good mood.
"Cas? I'm home!" Dean called, shutting the door with a quiet click behind him. He flicked the lock over, in case Sam decided to just drop by without warning. Though, the last time he did that, he learned his lesson. Dean only felt guilty for a minute before bursting into laughter, chasing after Sam while yanking his sweatpants back up his bare ass. Sam didn't look Cas in the eyes for a whole week after that.
“Dean?” Cas mumbled, his eyes fluttering open. Dean froze, still sitting next to him, his hand on the mattress only a few inches away from Cas’ exposed skin. “Are you checking to make sure I’m breathing?” Cas teased, making Dean blush, knowing he’d been caught. He quickly averted his gaze to the mattress, only for a second, before he was looking at Cas’ hand, those long fingers, the way they twisted the fabric of the sheets as Cas stretched.
Cas trailed wet, hot kisses up Dean’s neck, stopping at the corner of his mouth as Dean pulled hard on Cas’ hair, his hips thrusting up off the bed. Without a hand to balance himself, he started to slip off the bed, but Cas’ strong hips held him in place, his hand pumping Dean’s cock in a steady rhythm even while holding Dean’s weight as Dean fucked into Cas’ hand. Cas crowded in closer to Dean, his crotch pressing against Dean’s thigh. Dean felt Cas’ dick hot and heavy rubbing on his leg, his hips only stuttering slightly as he touched Dean. The feeling of Cas hard for him while still jerking him off was inexplicably
When the bag was full, he joined everyone in the dining room, carefully dropping the bag next to Cas’ feet. Cas looked up at Dean with a questioning look, his mouth half full of rice. “What’s this for?” he asked finally.
Dean really couldn’t believe his ears. He’d understand wanting to stay because it had been their home for ten years, but to say they should stay to keep away from monsters? That was ridiculous. “The apocalypse made you soft, Sam,” Dean answered, shaking his head in disbelief. “We used to hunt monsters for a living. We saved people. A lot of people. Don’t you think there are survivors out there who could benefit from our hunting skills?” It wasn’t exactly his plan to go off hunting down all the monsters, but it was something to kill time. Something to save people, save the world from going extinct or something drastic.
As Cas took the front seat, Dean rummaged through his stuff in the back until he found a clean gauze from one of the few first aid kits they had. He grabbed it and some of the pain medicine before walking around to where Cas sat with the door open, breathing in the fresh air. “Thank you, Dean,” he mumbled, his eyes staring at the ground. “You saved Jack. If anything would have happened to him. . .” he trailed off, shaking his head.
, was the sentence Dean couldn’t finish. He couldn’t think about that right now, or ever. If Cas was gone, Dean didn’t know what he’d do. That couldn’t be the outcome here.
It didn't take long for the four of them to fall into a routine. Every week, Dean would take Cas out into town for supplies, teaching him a few things about self defense along the way. Cas was actually a strong fighter, but he wasn't as good at defending himself as he was at punching people's lights out. While they practiced defense and gathered food and other supplies day after day, Sam and Jack worked on cleaning the house, painting demon traps, and Sam even taught Jack how to cook different meals over a fire. It had been two months since they left the bunker, since the undead dropped off the face of the planet. Dean was hesitant to say it, but he was actually happy for once. Cas and Jack were two amazing people who fit right in with Sam and Dean. They worked well together, the four of them, which made everyone's life easier. Dean was used to it being him and Sam, which wasn't always easy. Now, living was a walk in the park.
Dean didn't believe a word Sam said because he was incredibly flustered, the same way Dean acted when talking about Cas. It was pretty clear Sam liked this girl, which made Dean smile. Seeing Sam so happy was a nice sight considering all they'd been through in their lives.
"Cas, fuck, you're gonna make me come," Dean groaned, lifting his hips off the bed in desperate thrusts, filling Cas' mouth as he drew closer to his climax. Cas felt his eyes watering, but it felt so good, he didn't care. "Cas, you don't have to-" Dean tried, his hips stilling against the bed as he pulled at Cas' hair, trying to get him to pull away, but Cas wanted all of him. He shoved Dean's hands away, sinking down to take all of Dean, swallowing around him as Dean came down his throat. "Cas! Oh fuck, Cas, that's- Ahhh!" Dean cried, fingers curling around the nape of Cas' neck. Dean mumbled a slew of other things Cas couldn't understand, but he knew they were all praises for him. After a few more seconds, Cas slowly pulled away, sitting up to wipe the saliva from his chin. "You're a fucking angel," Dean sighed. "A sex angel. So fucking good."
Cas’ face softened in understanding, one of his hands moving up Dean’s arm in a comforting motion. “You just seem worried. I know this situation isn’t ideal, but we have time-”
Jo met his eyes with a desperate look on her face before dropping her head to Dean’s shoulder with a groan. Dean laughed and patted her back to comfort her. They were just a couple of idiots in love with their best friends, and there was nothing wrong with that. They just had to figure some shit out.
“I didn’t torture anyone,” Crowley said, ignoring Cas’ shocked expression. “That is how she was given to me. I torture souls, not people.” Dean was more than confused, but he kept an open mind. He still somehow thought his father was involved, so maybe Crowley could be telling the truth. Then again, he was a demon, so probably not.
Charlie gave Dean a guilty look, like she was about to do something that would really hurt. "Cas, the best thing you can do right now is hold his hand," she said, still looking at Dean. "This next part will hurt like a bitch." She mouthed the words 'I'm sorry' but Dean wasn't sure what she was apologizing for. Maybe for sending Cas to hold his hand, or possibly for what she was about to do to his wounded arm.
"I've always been alone," Dean found himself saying, rubbing his hand over his face, pressing them into his eyes to will the tears away. His biggest fear used to be ending up alone and broken, turning into his father who cared about nothing except killing and revenge. He always had Sam, but that was different. Dean was still alone. He didn't have anyone to talk to- like he was now. He didn't have someone to hold him and tell him everything would be okay, and deep down, that was what he always craved. Even now, even after years of conditioning from his father to be nothing more than a loyal soldier, he craved that human connection.
He couldn't have guessed how long the drive took because he wasn't paying close enough attention. He just knew they were pulling up to a makeshift parking lot now, filled with different types of cars and trucks. There was a gate that led into what looked like a typical neighborhood. There were rows of houses in the distance, large buildings that looked like they could be schools or libraries. Dean put Baby into park, right next to Jody's truck. With a sigh, Dean dragged himself out of the car, everyone else following. They clearly wouldn't be able to grab everything out of the car, but Dean made sure to grab his own bag, the one with Cas' blue tie tucked into the side pocket. It held everything important to him, so he couldn't leave without it. Sam grabbed his bag too, and Dean handed Cas and Jack a bag with their own clothes in it in case they did end up staying tonight.
Cas didn’t move, his eyes lingering on John like he was about to beat the shit out of him. Dean would have let him if he thought Cas could fight John off, but Dean had been on the receiving end of John’s fist before and it wasn’t pretty.
"Is that any way to greet your guests?" Dean asked fondly, leaning against the doorway as the older man whipped his head around to meet Dean's amused grin. His eyes widened while he slowly sat his steaming cup of coffee back down on the table with a thud. Dean shrugged his shoulders, playing off his excitement as less than it was. Bobby was still speechless, just staring in shock. "Good to see you too, Bobby," Dean chuckled.
“Okay, I’ll get up,” Cas sighed, finally dragging himself out of bed to get dressed. Eventually, after a little more teasing and flirting, they joined Jack and Sam in the dining room for breakfast Sam had gotten from them. Sam teased them for taking so long, until Dean brought up Eileen and how late Sam got back from their date last night, which shut Sam up very quickly.
"Actually," Cas chuckled, all the nerves he had melting away as Dean's deep voice met his ears. "I have a few," he shared, grabbing his notebook and packet as he scooted closer to Dean. Now they were sitting side by side, their legs crossed as their knees pressed against one another's. Cas leaned into Dean's space, sharing his notebook with the different ideas. He started going over each one, giving the pros and cons as Dean listened, nodding and making approving noises every now and then. When Cas finished, he pulled away with a slightly red face. "So, that's what I came up with. We can pick whatever you want," he added, staring down at his handwriting in the notebook.
"That sounds horrible. I'm so sorry," Dean mumbled, wishing there was something more profound he could say.
"Wait, Dean," Cas called, but Dean kept walking, his footsteps heavy and thudding against the hard floor, the sound loud in his eyes as he drowned out Cas' voice.
"Of course I will," he promised, kissing Cas' cheek with a smile. "I'll be with Sam and Jo the whole time, so it'll be okay." Cas seemed to accept this answer, his shoulders relaxing a little as he slumped against Dean's good shoulder. A few minutes later, they were interrupted by the door.
“If angels are real, then that means God is too,” Sam realized, the dark circles under his eyes making him look like a completely different person. I hadn’t looked at him much in the light, but with the candles lighting up his skin, it was much more visible. “Why hasn’t he done anything?”
Sam sighed, his eyes raking down the last few aisles. "Let's check them together," he suggested, leading the way down an aisle for baking supplies. They checked both sides in silence for a moment, until Sam cleared his throat, like he had something to say. Dean glanced at him, raising an eyebrow in question. Sam awkwardly looked away, pointlessly moving things around on the shelf. Dean waited, impatiently eyeing his little brother, who clearly had something to say. The way he was hesitating, it was something Dean wasn't going to like. At least, that was how he normally acted when that was the subject. "I noticed you and Cas are getting along really well," he said eventually, avoiding Dean's eyes.
“But we’re alone,” Cas argued with an amused laugh. Dean cracked one eye open to see Cas’ smiling face, snuggling in closer to him. “I thought you said the next time we were alone, we could-”
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled, pulling their spare cover up to cover their legs. He wasn’t going to admit that Cas was right, but he was. And Cas knew it anyway. “Can we stay home tomorrow? We can lay in bed all day and I can kiss you all over,” he suggested, brushing a finger over Cas’ bare torso.
Dean grunted as he pushed himself back up on his feet, machete in hand. “Eat this, you asshole,” he snarled, lunging at the vamp with all his strength. He knew there were more, but he was only one person. He had to trust that Cas could hold them off until he could kill the others. He grabbed the front of the vamp’s shirt, swinging the weapon at his head. The vamp dodged it, instead throwing Dean into the wall again, knocking the wind out of him. Dean managed to stay on his feet, kicking the Vamp into the coffee table next to the couch. It landed on it’s back, the perfect position for Dean to kneel on his chest to hold him down and chop it’s head off in one swift motion. With one dead, he turned to face the others. He saw Cas fighting them off with nothing but his hands while Jack struggled to hold another one off his own neck.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas blurted out, before he could stop himself. "For the ride, and for- well, you know, helping me back there," he finished, his face a dark shade of red as he fumbled for the door handle. He pushed the door open and nearly fell out of the car, he was so shaken up. Just as he straightened back up, he realized Dean was coming around the car to help him, his hand grabbing Cas' shoulder without warning. Cas jumped away instinctively, despite knowing Dean wasn't going to hurt him. They'd been through this.
Soon, they were counting in comfortable silence after Cas gave Dean half of the inventory sheet. With the two of them doing it together, it didn't take long. Dean was on the last few items, which were unfortunately located in another cabinet on the ground, so he was on his knees, trying to keep his balance with the use of only one arm.
“I just found her,” Dean replied, closing his eyes again. Charlie continued cleaning him up, taking her time. “I don’t know how, but she was on the ground. I carried her back. Took hours, but I lost track of time.”
“Is that alright with you?” John answered, narrowing his eyes. He was ready for Dean to start a fight, but Dean refused to get into it with all of these people around.
"Only if you want me to," Dean coaxed, massaging his thumb into the muscle of Castiel's thigh. "It'll give you something else to think about." Hesitantly, Dean's hand moved to Cas' hip, squeezing gently. Cas gasped, fingers digging into Dean's arms, his dick unintentionally reacting to the touch. He'd never done anything like this before, like ever. He'd only ever jerked himself off, which he knew was going to be nothing like the real thing, with someone else' hand. He was nervous, being that it was his first time, but he couldn't help the excitement in his chest, replacing the panicked thoughts. But that was the point, wasn't it? A distraction.
Dean’s face was about as red as Cas’ was as they both realized how it sounded. “No, Jack,” Dean quickly corrected him. “His name is a mouthful. It’s just easier to say Cas instead.”
“I found it years ago,” Jo told him, staring off into the distance, over the surface of the lake. “The undead didn’t come here, so I spent a lot of time getting to know this area. I told a few people about it. Charlie, my friend Ash, and now you.”
Cas took the chair beside Dean's bed again, getting comfortable as he scooted closer, resting his arms on the mattress. "Did Charlie tell you the plan for the next few weeks while you're healing?" he wondered, hesitantly reaching towards Dean's hand but pulling away before making any contact, as if he thought better of it.
When Cas snaked his arm around Dean's waist to hold him up, Dean met the angel's eyes, licking his lips. His mouth was watering and he wished he could feel Cas sliding into his mouth instead of his fingers, but there really wasn't a good position for that in Dean's current state.
"That'd be great," John agreed, taking a seat in the recliner opposite the couch. "We'll go have breakfast with Bobby and Ellen, then the grand tour," he said, making Dean genuinely smile at the mention of his uncle.
"You boys are gonna regret this," John snarled, stumbling over his own feet as Sam gave him a push towards the back door. "I'm your father!"
Falling asleep in that huge, spacious, cold bed was nearly impossible for Dean, knowing Cas was just in the other room. He hated the space between them, the absence of warmth he didn't realize he needed until they came clean about their feelings for each other. He imagined it before, sure, but now he craved it. He hoped Cas felt the same desire, hoped the angel was laying on the couch, staring at the ceiling, imagining Dean laying on top of him, keeping him warm the way Dean wished Cas would for him.
"Great," John replied with a friendly smile, offering his hand out to Cas, who took it after a few seconds of hesitation. "It's great to meet you. Any friend of my sons' is welcome here. Glad to have you." He gave Jack a wink that made Jack chuckle, then leaned back against the counter again, crossing his arms over his chest. "So, I'm hoping you boys will want to stay here. We've got a nice system going. People have jobs, we have plenty of food, space to live, and it's the safest place around here. What do you say?"
There is no updating schedule, but I'll try to update every week! Generally, my chapters are pretty short, but I make up for that by writing so many chapters lol. Also sorry for any typos, I don't have anyone to read over my work for me!
"What happened?" Cas asked, his voice rough. He let Dean lower him back down onto the couch without complaint, his eyes staring into Dean's for an answer. "Did- this can't be hell, so where am I? Did Crowley take my soul? Am I still-"
Once they had been driving for about an hour, Dean found a secluded spot down a gravel road to park, covered by a lot of trees and bushes. Not that there were many people out there anyways, but Dean wanted to make sure they were going to be alone for sure. No people, monsters, or anything that could possibly ruin their night. Dean just wanted this to be perfect, since nothing else seemed to be going right lately.
Kaia slowly pulled away with wet cheeks, her eyes red. “What are you going to do?” she asked, hugging her arms around herself as if she missed the contact.
John sighed, glancing at Charlie, still being held by two men who were twice her size. She looked defeated, watching Dean with desperate eyes. “We asked around and we have reason to believe it was Charlie who took the missing medical supplies. She was the last person-”
"Hey, you're hurting him!" Dean yelled, panic setting in as he started to reach for Crowley to pry him away from Cas.
"Dean," Cas said again, his hand hesitantly reaching out to grab the sleeve of Dean's flannel, tugging slightly. "What's wrong?" His fingers twisted into the fabric of Dean's shirt and Dean could only stand there, staring intently at Cas' long fingers as they hooked into the dark fabric. He swallowed the lump in his throat, shaking his head slowly. "Dean, please," Cas tried again, his voice softer this time, more coaxing than anything. He was trying to pry it out of Dean, and maybe it was working.
“Charlie, stop talking and I’ll tell you,” Dean laughed, cutting her off. She frowned, sitting back in the seat as Jo wrapped an arm around her shoulders to console her fake hurt. “It was great. We just went for a drive and talked.” He didn’t want to go into the details for obvious reasons, even though Jo already knew.
After scarfing down the plate of food, Dean worked through the pain in his arm and started undressing himself. The pants were easy, but when he tried to slip off his shirt, as gentle as possible, it still felt like something was stabbing him in the arm. He cried out in pain, giving up as he stumbled back towards the bed, flopping down with tears pricking the corners of his eyes. He thought he might just lay there all day, until Cas came bursting into the room with a worried look on his face. Dean knew it was an inappropriate time to admire how hot the angel looked in his tight black slacks, button up shirt with the sleeves up to his elbows, and that blue tie to match his eyes. He knew that his arm was bleeding profusely and that the pain was making him see spots in his eyes, but damn, he’d gotten really lucky.
"What do we even do now?" Sam chuckled, smiling fondly at the way Dean pressed a kiss to Castiel's shoulder and held him closer. "I mean, John is gone. Our friends are safe. Do we just go back to normal? What are we supposed to do after the end of the world?"
“I’m here now,” Dean said with a long exhale, the guilt settling back deep in his gut. Cas must have been waiting for him to return home all night. What if he was still sitting in bed, wide awake, just waiting for Dean to get back? Dean hated thinking that Cas was suffering all because of him. “I’ll stay with her tonight,” Dean found himself offering. Despite knowing Cas was probably up waiting for him, he wasn’t ready to face him yet. He didn’t want to talk about what he was feeling, or what had happened with John earlier.
As soon as they made it through the door, Charlie was asking a million questions that only made Dean’s head spin faster. The girl talked a million miles per hour on a normal day, so when she was worried, that frantic tone in her voice made her words come flying out of her mouth even faster. “What the hell happened?” she eventually settled on, effectively glaring at Dean to make him feel small. She helped Cas get Dean into the other room with the beds and Dean all but threw himself onto the mattress before he could pass out from standing any longer. Charlie began poking and prodding at him and Dean was too disoriented to stop her. The only thing he was aware of was Cas’ hand in his own. That, and the pain.
Castiel's heart sank into his stomach as the guys in the back began yelling and whooping, making inappropriate sounds. Cas made the mistake of glancing back at his partner. Dean was red in the face, and not from embarrassment as his friends made fun of him. No, Dean was angry. He was angry that he was partnered with Castiel, and frankly, Cas wasn't exactly happy either. This was the worst case scenario. Cas was screwed.
Dean was starting to think he wasn't going to make it. He thought he might pass out before he got to Cas, but then he saw him. Cas was tied to the trunk of a large tree with tight rope, his head slumped forward like he was unconscious. Dean pushed his own pain aside and stumbled over to the tree, grabbing his knife out of his pocket to cut the rope. "Cas, can you hear me?" he asked, gently lifting Cas' head. He was definitely out cold, blood caked to his face and matted into his hair. "Cas, I'm here, I've got you," Dean whispered, even though Cas couldn't hear him.
Cas tightened his grip, glancing at Dean with an assuring smile. "You won't hurt me," he promised. That's what Dean had said to him that first night he agreed to stay. It had more meaning when Cas said it. Dean swallowed hard, his eyes back on the ground, watching his feet with every step. "It's not your fault," Cas said eventually, and again, the grip tightened. Dean took a deep breath. "Does this help?" Cas wondered, genuinely asking, genuinely caring about Dean.
Dean may have felt a little disappointment about not getting to spend the day with Cas, but he knew he was being clingy. He didn't have to spend every waking moment with the guy just because they were more than friends now. There wasn't even a label on their relationship yet, but Dean had already fallen too hard to think about looking back.
Dean groaned, frustrated that he picked such stubborn friends. Jo seemed to be just as unbudging as Charlie with the same stern stance and tight lips. “Fine, I have the perfect job for you,” Dean sighed, gesturing for them to follow him back into the building. They all piled through the door, including Sam, waiting for their task. Dean found a paper and a pen and started writing down everything for the summoning ritual.
"Tie his hands," Dean told them, watching as Sam and Bobby lifted John to his feet. John glared at Dean, or maybe it was directed towards Cas. He didn't seem like he had the strength to say anything. Sam held John up while Bobby went and found some rope to tie his hands behind his back. "We don't have much time left. We have to get him to the meeting spot."
“So this is my room,” he mumbled, looking around at the mess. He bit his lip for a moment, thinking to himself as he turned to his dresser and began digging through his clothes. He found a pair of plaid pajama pants and an old Led Zeppelin t-shirt and then closed the drawer, turning back to face the angel. “I thought you might want something more comfortable to sleep in,” he offered, extending the clothes out to Cas.
Cas smiled, slowly sitting up to stretch some more. Dean watched Cas’ shirt ride up even farther as the heat crept up his own neck, reminding him of all those suppressed feelings from when he was a teenager. He hadn’t thought about anyone really since then, so he couldn’t be blamed that the first attractive man he met was making him feel things he wasn’t supposed to feel.
"Thanks again," Jesse said as a goodbye, both of them waving enthusiastically as Dean left them to sort out their things in their new home.
Cas stepped closer, but there was still so much space between them. "I lied," Cas continued, making Dean narrow his eyes in confusion.
Dean thought it would get easier, being around Castiel. He thought those feelings in his chest would fade, that his face would stop turning a deep shade of red at the sound of Cas' voice. He thought he would be able to talk to him normally, even as Cas walked around the kitchen without a shirt on when laundry day came around. Dean swore those feelings were only because he hadn't been around anyone since before the apocalypse, but he was wrong. He still blushed when Cas laid down beside him at night on the cold living room floor. He held his breath when Cas' hand brushed past his own when they walked into town together. His heart beat hard against his ribcage when Cas practiced his self defense moves on him, sometimes shoving him up against a wall, or wrapping him in some kind of hold. It was something Dean realized he wasn't going to get over. He was attracted to Cas, whether he liked it or not. Would he ever admit that out loud? Never. Not willingly, at least. It wasn't much more than attraction, anyways. It had only been two months since they met, so he was sure that was all it was.
"Fuck," Dean growled, pulling Cas in for a kiss without warning. When Cas pulled away, Dean was grinning. "Yeah, a distraction would be nice," he agreed, lifting Cas' shirt over his head easily. Though he was nervous, Cas was definitely ready for this. He wanted to make Dean feel good, just like Dean did for him. Except, this wasn't really the position for a hand job, but he had other ideas. And he was pretty confident he could figure it out, even though he'd never done it before.
"Kinda," Dean answered with a slight shrug. "We're going on a date tonight. Bringing Cas and Charlie along too, though. It's nothing serious right now." He didn't want to make things sound too complicated. He planned on telling Sam about Cas soon, but he just wasn't sure when the right time would be. For now, he'd let Sam think Jo was still in the picture.
“I’m just saying, there’s something going on,” Dean said, keeping his voice even as he took a step away from John, who looked like he was seconds away from swinging a fist. “Look, I’m not trying to say you had anything to do with Kaia’s disappearance, but maybe you should look into it. Until I find out who did this, she’ll be under my protection.” He had to lie in order to calm his father down, but it was the right course of action anyway. If John knew Dean was onto him, Dean would never be able to dig any deeper. He didn’t want John on his ass while he was trying to figure things out.
“I can’t wait,” Dean said, laying his head on Cas’ chest, pressing a gentle kiss to his sticky skin. They were in no hurry to get back, so they stayed like that for a couple hours, talking about the future where they were free to be who they wanted. Cas smiled a lot more than usual, so Dean let him think it was possible, even if Dean didn’t think it could happen. He’d do anything to make Cas happy, but some things were out of his control.
"Damn it," he hissed, dropping what was in his hands to barricade the door. He was running on pure adrenaline now and he had blood coming from so many different wounds, he wasn't sure what was his and what was Cas'. He was more worried about whether or not the desk he had pushed up against the door would do anything to slow down the hellhounds. He had no choice but to trust that it would buy him some time. He had to finish the spell.
Cas chuckled, falling into the bed next to Dean, pulling himself in closer, so they were face to face. Dean rolled over on his side, reaching up to trace a thumb over Cas' cheek. "Dean, I don't think angels are supposed to have sex," Cas teased.
"No," Dean replied too quickly, rubbing the back of his neck as the heat crept up to his ears. God, he wanted nothing more than to be with Cas, but for many reasons, that could never happen. Not now, and not here. "Wait-" Dean mumbled, pausing until Cas looked at him again, both of them awkwardly staring at each other. "Do you. . . Is that what you want?" Dean managed to ask, though he wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer.
"I don't know," Dean admitted. "I guess it'll be a surprise." He hoped that even if he told Jo the truth (not about Cas, but that he didn't feel that way about her) that they could still be friends. He really did like Jo and he really enjoyed her company. He had no doubt that this date would be fun, which he didn't have often.
After two hours, though, the packet was only half way done. Their teacher must not have looked at the materials she put into the packet, or if she did, she was just evil. There was so much in there that they weren't going to be able to finish it and the model all in one day. Not to mention, after the two hours of working through the first half, Dean's stomach started growling loud enough to interrupt the peaceful silence.
"D-D-Dean," Cas tried, but that was all he could say. Suddenly, Dean's lips were on his, just pressed against them, not moving. Cas sucked in a sharp breath, surprised by the gesture, but it shocked him enough to pull him back to reality. Dean didn't pulled away until Cas had stopped shaking in his arms. "Sorry," Cas whispered, as Dean pulled him into a hug, holding him tight, which helped calm his nerves. "I'm sorry," Cas said again, and Dean responded by hugging him tighter, not letting up until Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's waist too.
"What are you looking at me for?" Dean wondered, his cheeks burning. He knew it was no big deal, showing affection like this in front of his family, but it still made him feel a little embarrassed.
Cas looked down at his outfit, grabbing the hem of the shirt to stretch it out while he stared at the old rock band on the front. "I like this shirt," he said simply, glancing at Dean, whose face was still burning with embarrassment, despite the fact that he was going for the opposite effect. "I can change if you want this back," he added, getting the shirt halfway over his torso before Dean instinctively reached out and grabbed it, straightening it back down over Cas' stomach.
“Positive,” Dean replied, standing up to collect the trash off the table. He threw the bowls away and put the dishes in the sink before returning to the dining room. Jack and Sam were deep in conversation as Sam tried to explain different kinds of monsters and how to hunt them to the poor kid. “I’m sure you guys are exhausted. How about I show you to your rooms?” Dean offered, saving Jack from another second of Sam’s endless knowledge.
“I’m terrified,” Crowley deadpanned, followed by a small sigh. “Here’s the problem, little Winchester. Your father and I have a little deal. He gives me souls, I give him safety from the supernatural. That little wall around his neighborhood, that’s all thanks to me.”
"I didn't," Dean said with a glare. "She asked me and I said yes, because what else have I got to do? I'm out of commission for the next few weeks, you and Cas are both still working, so might as well put myself out there, right? Dad's the one who set us up in the first place, so it'll make him happy."
"Dean Winchester," he supplied, unsure of what else he was supposed to say. He didn't have a lot of interaction with people these days. At least, not friendly interaction.
Cas' mouth was suddenly on him again, hot and wet and unrelenting. Dean was unraveling under his touch, somehow melting even deeper into the mattress as Cas took his sweet time tasting Dean, clearly enjoying it from the sounds of his soft moans coming from deep in his throat. Dean couldn’t even find it in him to ask for more, because Cas was giving so much already. Suddenly, Cas pulled away with an obscene, wet noise as Dean’s hips collapsed to the mattress. He hadn’t even realized how much he was moaning until he had to catch his breath as Cas’ weight dipped off the bed.
They ate in silence for a few minutes, but it was comfortable. Dean's mouth felt dry, despite the food he was shoveling in, and he remembered the bottle of water in the pocket of his jacket. "Here," he said, setting it between him and Cas on the empty step after taking a small sip. Cas eyed it for a second before picking it up himself and swallowing a gulp of water. Dean felt a strange feeling in stomach watching Cas wrap his mouth around his water, but he quickly looked away, staring down at his half eaten plate of beans.
Cas swallowed hard, dropping his hands back to his sides as Dean slowly did the same, taking a step back. "I-I think so," he admitted, his face suddenly red. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
Dean stood, holding the tube between his fingers as he sighed, hesitating. He was tired, but he was used to running on little sleep. Maybe, this once, he could allow Sam to drive, but he wasn't going to be happy about it. "Fine," he grumbled, handing the keys over. "But you're filling up the gas tank," he added, holding out the tube for Sam to take.
"Am not," Dean grumbled, slipping his hand off the back of Cas' chair as he moved around the table towards Jo. He followed her to the other side of the room, where they wouldn't be easily overheard by the others, though they were still well within Dean's sight. He leaned back against the wall, sticking his one free hand in his pocket. "So, how are you?" he asked casually, even though he was internally panicking because he knew what this was about.
Cas was quiet for a minute, but then Dean felt him kiss the top of his head with a small sigh. “I’m sorry, Dean,” he said sincerely. “I suppose you were looking for a distraction from the situation with Kaia and your father.”
“You’re doing so good,” Cas murmured against his skin, his breath hitching as Dean groaned around Cas’ thumb, dragging his teeth across the calloused skin. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this,” Cas continued, keeping his voice low as he moved to nibble at Dean’s ear, stroking his hand a little faster as Dean’s breathing became uneven. He could feel that familiar sensation in his gut as Cas talked to him. It wasn’t even anything incredibly filthy, but hearing Cas’ deep voice in his ear was sending him over the edge. “I’ve been thinking about touching you like this for so long, Dean.” From the other room, Dean could hear Charlie shuffling around counting inventory. The walls were thin, so Dean was really trying not to be loud, but it was hard.
Claire glanced at Dean, the hint of worry still on her face. There was a lot going on, despite Kaia’s safety. Claire knew that as well as Dean, but she clearly didn’t want to worry her mom. “Yeah, everything’s okay now,” Claire nodded, offering a small smile before stepping away from Jody’s hold.
Hey guys, I'm back! I had a very productive week and a half, finishing all of my finals, working, and moving into my new apartment. I finally have some time to write again!
Dean hesitated, glancing up to watch Cas' narrowed gaze as the man counted. He thought about ignoring this, but it was too good of a position to not tease Cas, at least. He slowly let his hand rest on Cas' thigh, just to get his attention. Cas froze, but didn't say anything, so Dean took that as a good sign to keep touching him. He gently massaged his thumb into the thick muscle of Cas' leg, gradually moving up to his hip where he squeezed, making Cas gasp.
Dean wasn't sure how he made it from the woods to the front door of that house with his bag on one arm and Cas on the other, but he did. He may have blacked out while running there, but when he came back to his surroundings, he was shoving the door open and stumbling inside with a pained groan, dropping the bag first before finding the couch in the middle of the room.
“Haven’t had much activity the past few nights,” John said eventually, walking a few steps in front of Dean, so Dean could only watch the back of his head when John spoke. “Still gotta check the perimeter. Wouldn’t want anything getting close to the walls.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, pulling her in closer for a brief hug. When she pulled back, it was with a smile on her lips. “Bring Claire in tomorrow before work. She needs to know Kaia is safe, too.”
Dean cleared his throat, feeling the need to make some kind of noise while he searched for a reply. What helped him sleep? Being alone, for one. Not having to worry about someone sleeping next to him. "My mom used to tell me stories," he said, instead of the first thing that came to mind. "Before the apocalypse," he added.
"Give it a few weeks," she scolded, giving him a knowing look, like she just knew he would be the kind of person to take it off as soon as he was out of her sight. "I'll make sure Cas knows not to let you use that arm. And you're done hunting for a few weeks too. Once the arm is healed, you can get back out there, but for now, you're docile."
Dean started driving, one hand on the wheel as he wrapped his other arm around Cas’ shoulders to hold him closer. “I’m perfect,” he answered, kissing the top of the angel’s head to reassure him. “I was just thinking about how much I love this car. It’s always been my one true home, since we always lived out of shitty motel rooms when we were kids.”
Kaia frowned, shaking her head. "Now that you mention it, I don't remember anything. The last thing I really remember was coming home from work and- and then it's blank."
When Cas finally fucked him, it was everything Dean wanted, everything he had been craving for the past week- for his entire life, maybe. Dean touched Cas wherever he could reach him, running his hands over the strong muscles of his back and squeezing his arms harder with each deep thrust of Cas' hips. He moaned Cas' name as Cas held him, kissing Dean's shoulder gently. When Cas wrapped his hand around Dean, he only lasted a few more seconds before spilling into Cas' hand. Cas swallowed the moan on Dean's lips with a kiss, then buried his face in Dean's neck as he came with a quiet groan from deep in his throat. Dean held Cas tight and whispered how much he loved him into the angel's hair.
Dean half expected Cas to come outside after him and demand to know why he had run out like he did, but the door stayed firmly shut. Dean was relieved to have a few minutes alone to calm his racing heart. He liked the quiet, especially since he hadn't really had a moment like this since he met Cas and Jack. He had no complaints about the company, but he forgot how nice the silence could be sometimes. So he sat there on the steps, leaning back against the wooden railing, his eyes closed as the wind brushed over his skin.
"Now, usually, I'd let you guys pick your partners for group work, but this project is worth a lot more points than our normal worksheet," his teacher was saying, her eyes scanning the classroom as she picked up a clipboard. "I'll be assigning your partners for this project, that way no one can get distracted by their friends." A chorus of groans came from the group in the back, making Cas shiver. He folded his hands in front of him, leaning his forehead against his fists, waiting to hear his name. His teacher began rattling off names, partnering people up left and right. Castiel heard every name he could have been fine with get called before his own name. "Castiel Novak," she said slowly, her pen moving across the clipboard to his partner's name. "And Dean Winchester."
"What's this?" Cas wondered, eyeing Dean's balled up fist with his head cocked to the side in confusion. Dean snorted, unfolding the tie before gently tossing it over Cas' neck, accidentally pulling him closer as he did so. They both blushed, Dean gulping as he realized how closer they were. "Where did you find this?" Cas asked, his voice low and quiet, too intimate for this situation to be comfortable. His hands flew up to grab onto Dean's, still holding each end of Cas' tie.
Jo and Charlie were already waiting when Sam and Dean reached the wall, a bag of supplies in Charlie’s hands. “Dean, your hands!” she gasped, moving towards him with a worried frown on her face. “What happened? Are you okay?”
“Don’t,” John warned, his eyes dark. Dean wasn’t even a little concerned about the look on John’s face, even though he knew it well. It meant he wanted to hurt Dean, but he was in no position. Dean was the one with a foot on his throat and a gun at his head. “Don’t bring your mother into this.”
“Oh,” Cas breathed, his eyes wild. He slowly licked his lips, staring at the bottle in his hand before looking at Dean again. “Yes, much better than talking,” he nodded, suddenly grabbing the front of Dean’s shirt to haul him in for a somewhat frantic kiss, which almost knocked them over. Dean chuckled into Cas’ mouth, his nerves starting to dwindle the more Cas seemed to be on board. “Wait, wait,” Cas mumbled, reluctantly pulling away, but still keeping a tight grip on Dean’s shirt. “In the car? It’s a little cramped in here, don’t you think?”
Dean stayed by his side, but dragged Cas closer to the demon, cautious the whole time. "Just heal him, and then we never see each other again," Dean snapped, reluctantly letting his hand slip away from Cas' arm.
Dean let out a small chuckle, his head dizzy with Cas’ touches. “For what?” he asked, sucking in a nervous breath as Cas sat up again, carefully dragging Dean’s underwear down his legs.
"I'm done talking about this, Sam," he said firmly, effectively shutting Sam up before he could get too personal. "I'm fine, okay? We're all safe here and that's the only thing that matters. I've got Bobby, you, Cas, Jack, and I'm gonna see Jo again soon, so it all works out, okay?"
“Because,” Dean sighed, his free hand gripping the edge of the chair as he forced himself to tell Cas. “I couldn’t punch my dad.” Cas didn’t say anything, so the silence settled again. Cas carefully pulled Dean’s hand closer, pressing his lips to the back of Dean’s hand, a kiss for each of his bruised knuckles. Dean watched, his chest tight and his eyes burning. “I really don’t deserve you,” he blurted out.
Dean kept his hand close to his gun, just in case. They walked slowly through the hallway, the floorboards creaking under their heavy footsteps. "The salt keeps ghosts away, right?" Cas asked quietly, close on Dean's heel as they checked the empty rooms for signs of life, human or not. There were three rooms upstairs and one bathroom, so it didn't take long to make a round. So far, nothing.
"I'm just getting the napkins," Cas answered reassuringly, before disappearing into the hallway. He treaded quietly, enough that Dean couldn't hear him return until Cas had opened the door again and clicked it shut behind him. After cleaning up the mess between the two of them, Cas trashed the soiled napkins and then laid down next to Dean, pulling the man against his side so his head could rest on Cas' bare chest. After a long silence, Cas sighed, running his fingers through Dean's hair thoughtfully. "It would be best for everyone if I returned to the couch at some point," he declared, but made no move to get up.
"This is good for today," Dean announced, leading Cas out of the store and back out onto the street. "Ready to head back?" He paused, glancing at Cas, who didn't seem to be paying much attention. He was scanning the street, eyes reading all the broken signs for each store, zoned out completely. Dean rolled his eyes, waiting patiently for Cas to snap back to the conversation.
Cas gave him a pointed look and Dean shrank back into his pillow. "Dean, it's been ten minutes and you're already arguing with me. I'm in charge right now, aren't I?" he said, waiting for Dean to give a verbal answer. Dean nodded and Cas only narrowed his eyes, not a good enough answer for him.
After a while, Dean heard Cas sigh softly and couldn't help but glance over at the angel, both of them still wide awake. Dean could see his eyes staring up at the ceiling in the light of the moon shining through the window. "I never could fall asleep easily," Cas admitted, breaking the silence with his rough voice. Dean shivered, but he pretended it was from the slight draft in the room. There wasn't really a draft. "What helps you sleep, Dean?"
"So are you," Cas retorted, his feet thudding against the floor as he stood up, filling the moment of awkward silence. "I'm strong enough for now. After what he did to me, to you, to all of the innocent people he sacrificed- I need to be there."
"Cas, I don't know if you can hear me, but you're gonna be fine," he promised, laying the angel on the cushions as he remained unconscious. Dean tried not to spend too much time fussing over him while the hellhounds were still out there. He made sure Cas was laying down with his head propped up to keep the blood from choking him to death before leaning over him to kiss his hair. "I'll take care of this."
"Wait, Jo- as in the girl who shot you?" Sam questioned, not angry, just surprised. Dean only nodded, wanting this to be over with. "Guess first impressions don't mean much to Dean Winchester," he teased, and Dean only rolled his eyes. "Did you ask her out before or after she shot you?"
Dean had been walking for a long time before he realized he had left the safety of the neighborhood. With all of his pent up rage keeping his mind occupied, he didn’t pay much attention to where he was going. He just wanted to get away. He didn’t want to see anything that could remind him of his father, and about how much he wanted to hurt his father. In all the years Dean had been alive, he never wanted to actually hurt his dad. He’d been angry before, but never like this. He never once doubted that he didn’t love his dad, despite what he had done to him. Now, all he could see was red when he thought about John.
“When his men brought me to him, I tried to escape,” she explained, her voice shaking as she relived it in her head. Dean felt bad for bringing it up and almost stopped her, but she continued. “He said what I did- what I am- is disgusting. They beat me until I passed out. I can’t remember what happened to me after that. It’s blank up until the moment you found me.”
The longer the silence stretched on, the farther they made it into the woods. The wind was picking up as the clouds expanded in the sky to cover the light from the sun. Dean felt a cold chill run down his spine as he snapped a branch under his foot, wincing at the sudden crack in the silence. Jo glanced at him, but her attention was quickly diverted to another sound, almost hidden by the sudden gush of wind.
"Sounds great, dad," Sam agreed, throwing a glance back at Dean, waiting for his okay. Dean nodded, following his dad and Sam inside, making sure Cas and Jack were still in tow. Jody and her guys left them alone as they entered the house, leaving just the five of them to talk. John led them into a large kitchen with a table that sat four. Sam and Dean took seats across from one another, Cas and Jack sitting beside them as John leaned back against the kitchen counter to face them.
"In the bedroom!" Cas called back. Dean followed his voice, stripping off his shoes and jacket before reaching the bedroom door. He slowly pushed the door open, his eyes landing on Cas in the middle of their bed, shirtless and wearing nothing else but a pair of tight boxers he had stolen from Dean months ago. "Hello, Dean," he greeted with a smirk.
"I'd appreciate that, Dean," Cas interrupted, settling a comfortable silence between them as Dean nodded, not sure how to respond. They finished salting the windows in the remaining rooms, which didn't take too much longer. After they were done, Dean turned to go find Sam, only to run into Cas who was standing much closer than Dean thought he was. "What kind of things can you teach me?" he asked, breaking the silence as Dean licked his lips awkwardly, taking a step away from the angel. He straightened out his jacket, just to have something to do with his hands as Cas waited for an answer, those blue eyes staring into his own.
"No big deal," Dean promised, keeping his head down. "Charlie here was a great tour guide," he commented, sparing a teasing glance at his new friend, earning him a sweet smile in return.
“I apologize, Dean. I didn’t know you were embarrassed about having sex with me.” Dean opened his mouth to respond, but honestly, he didn’t know what to say to that. Cas was genuinely worried that Dean was embarrassed, from the look on his face, anyways. Dean didn’t know how to explain that it wasn’t that he was embarrassed.
“Unfortunately, I know for a fact that it’s true,” Dean said, rocking on the heels of his feet while waiting for Bobby to say something. He just looked completely shocked.
“I found her, dad!” Dean shouted, grabbing his wrist to push his hand back to his side. John’s face fell, his mouth hanging open at Dean’s words. Clearly, he hadn’t expected that. It was all the proof Dean needed to know that John was involved. No innocent man looked that scared when goods news about a missing kid came up. “Yeah, I found her last night. She was passed out in the middle of the woods. Somebody tortured her and left her there to bleed out.”
"I'll be fine," Cas promised, stepping into Dean's space with two hands suddenly around Dean's waist. "We'll protect each other, like we always have."
"It's great!" Jack beamed, nodding his head in time with the song. Dean smiled, satisfied as he continued driving down the long stretch of highway, his fingers tapping the steering wheel as the songs played. He watched Jack every few seconds, his heart swelling as the kid slowly learned the words to the choruses in each song and began to sing along.
“Cas,” he moaned, spilling into his hand as Cas made a choked noise, still stroking Dean as he came too, riding out the high for a few seconds until they collapsed together, a sweaty, sticky mess. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s shoulders with a happy sigh. Cas kissed Dean’s shoulder before burying his face in Dean’s neck, seemingly no intentions of moving any time soon.
Dean laughed harshly, shaking his head. Of course it wasn’t a prison. Dean knew what it was like being locked up somewhere, unable to leave, being mentally and emotionally tortured, sometimes even physically when he didn’t listen the first time. Living here with John was horrible, yes, but it wasn’t as bad as that year of Dean’s life he’d never get back. At least now, he had Cas and he had friends.
John sent a glare towards Jo for running to Dean, but Dean stepped in front of her, blocking her from John’s view. “Dean, this doesn’t concern you,” John replied calmly. “Go home.” He seemed completely unfazed by Dean’s intrusion, but now that Dean knew who he really was, that didn’t surprise him in the least. John could sacrifice innocent people, like Kaia, and feel nothing. Why would he care if he was hurting Dean?
"There you go," Dean purred, plunging his fingers deeper into Cas' mouth, still jerking him off. Cas felt that familiar sensation in his gut, meaning he was getting close. He mumbled that around Dean's fingers, but Dean didn't let him talk and kept fucking his fingers into Cas' mouth as he pumped his hand around Castiel's cock, bringing him closer and closer to his climax. Cas couldn't help it, he was so close, his hips involuntarily left the mattress, fucking into Dean's hand. This time, Dean let him, his soft groans getting lost in the sound of Cas' panting and moaning, Dean's name on his lips every few seconds, the name sounding so misconstrued around Dean's digits fucking into his mouth.
A mischievous look passed over Jo's face, her arms falling to her sides. "Okay, you have my attention," she answered with a sly smile. "My answer depends on your answer to the next question."
"It's okay," Cas answered, his hand roaming over Dean's back soothingly. "I kind of like it. Reminds me of when I still had my grace." Dean hummed in response, laying his head against Cas' shoulder. For a moment, they sat there in silence, enjoying each other's presence. Eventually, Dean forced himself to get up and Cas redressed himself.
“Don’t worry,” Jo reassured her, squeezing Dean’s hand as she talked, as if she could sense his uneasiness. “Charlie isn’t letting her out of her sight. Cas is with them too. They’re both very protective, so she couldn’t be safer.”
," Ellen retorted, pulling out a seat at the table to join them. "You haven't seen each other in ten years and all you want to talk about is cars?" she wondered, staring at them accusingly as both Bobby and Dean shrank into their chairs. "Bobby, you've spoken about Dean and his brother more than anything else before they showed up here. Hell, I feel like I've known them my whole lives cause of how much you talk about them. Tell me there isn't anything else you boys can talk about?"
They moved to the dining room, Dean still in only his sweats as they sat next to each other at the table. Cas placed a plate of food and coffee in front of Dean as they dug in, letting a comfortable silence settle over them for a few minutes. As Dean groggily took a long sip of coffee, he suddenly felt Cas’ hand cover his own where it rested on the table next to his plate. When he sat his cup down to look at the angel, Cas was already staring at him.
“Aw, sweetheart, I’m sorry,” Dean cooed, wrapping his arm around her small frame. “We can reschedule in a few days, right dad?”
Bobby's smile grew, clearly on board with the idea. It eased the tension in Dean's chest by a ton. "I'd like that," Bobby agreed. Dean nodded, licking his lips to wet the dry skin. He was still nervous, despite Bobby's reassuring words. Another person now knew about him and Cas. That made three people, and there was a good chance Ellen had overheard everything from the living room, so maybe four people. Things were moving fast, but somehow, Dean was okay with it. As long as John didn't find out, as long as the people Dean loved were protected, this was good. He was taking big steps here, breaking out of his shell that John forced him into all those years ago. It felt
Kaia struggled to sit up, taking a pause to breathe before finally settling back against the wall in the same position as Dean. She rested her head against the wall, dragging her knees to her chest with a shuddering breath. Dean wished he could help her, but he wasn't in the best state himself.
Cas smiled softly, his fingers grazing Dean's knee for a moment until he gestured for Dean to scoot over, giving enough space for Cas to sit next to him in the bed. For a few minutes, they sat in silence, but it was comfortable. Dean thought he might be happy just being in Castiel's presence for the next few hours, as long as they stayed like this, side by side, their shoulders pressed together casually. Cas suddenly said something, but Dean had zoned out, focused in on the weight of Cas' body next to his.
Dean’s mind blanked for a moment, everything he’d been thinking about for the past week about finding this guy and the questions he had- it all went out the window. “Wait, how the hell do you two know each other?” Dean demanded, stepping away from Crowley with a disgusted expression on his face. This guy was weird, which Dean knew the first time he saw the creep watching him from a distance.
"Okay, Cas," Dean mumbled, watching the angel back away, only breaking eye contact when he had to turn around to grab his bags for the supply run. In silence, they set out like normal, walking the familiar streets into town where the strip of stores were located. They hadn't been in all of them, as some of them weren't really necessary, like the clothing stores, the pet stores, and there was even a sex store that Dean refused to even look at as they passed. Dean couldn't even imagine having to explain half of the things in that store to Cas, the clueless angel.
“Nope,” Dean answered with a sigh. “I wish I could’ve gotten closer. I need to know what they offered Crowley.”
“No, she doesn’t remember anything,” Dean admitted calmly. “But so much for keeping people safe, huh? This is your community, dad. Kaia was your responsibility and you let her get hurt. Stop preaching about how great you are when you allowed her to almost die.”
am so proud of you," he continued, reaching across the space between them to grab Dean's good shoulder, squeezing hard to make sure Dean was looking at him and really listening. "I'll always protect you. The last time, I let him take you, but never again. I won't let that happen again. So you let yourself be happy, damn it. You go be with Cas and don't think about the consequences, because the first time John lays a finger on either one of you, he's dead. Do you understand me, boy?"
“Your date with Jo didn’t go well?” Charlie asked, sanitizing her hands as she moved to sit on the end of the bed, facing Dean with a curious look on her face. “I just saw her this morning and she didn’t mention anything.”
John crossed his arms, clearly frustrated at the amount of times Dean had stood up to him since they'd been reunited. Dean found it just as surprising when he did it, but it felt good too. Like he should have done that a long time ago. It was small steps, standing up to him about Sam and about where he was living. Maybe he'd eventually work up to telling John about Cas, if anywhere were to happen between them. Then when John complained, Dean would tell him to suck it. At least, in a perfect world, that would be how it played out.
“Okay, come here,” Dean answered, gesturing for her to follow him away from the others. He took them outside on the back porch, where they wouldn’t be bothered. Kaia looked serious, so Dean wanted her to feel comfortable talking to him. “What’s going on?”
Dean suddenly sat up, leaning over Cas with a soft smile on his lips. "Really?" he wondered, and Cas nodded, unable to smile back at Dean with the same amount of enthusiasm. Dean licked his lips, seemingly hesitant as he leaned down, pressing their lips together. It was a short kiss at first. Dean pulled away, but Cas reached up and wrapped a hand around the back of his neck, pulling him back in. This time, Dean groaned into the kiss, his tongue teasing Cas' bottom lip, waiting as Cas parted his lips, letting Dean lick into his mouth. Cas never understood the appeal of french kissing until he had Dean Winchester's tongue in his mouth. Even with morning breath, Dean still tasted amazing, like nothing Cas would have ever imagined. He could have laid there in bed with him all day, just kissing him. But- he couldn't.
Dean gently ran his thumb over Cas' cheek, holding his eyes with his own. "I'm not going anywhere. I'll always come back to you, Cas. I need you to trust me."
Dean slowly turned around, his feet barely leaving the ground as he spun to face the angel, the tie hanging loosely in his hands. He met Cas' eyes, admiring that color as his hands moved on their own, without permission from his brain. He draped the tie over Cas' neck, pausing to pop the collar on his shirt. He watched his fingers work, slowly knotting the tie as Cas watched him, both of them basking in the silence. When it was tied, Dean carefully tightened it, fixing Cas' collar to complete the look. He wanted to move his hands away immediately, but he couldn't seem to pull away. Cas dropped the pants he had been holding onto, which was the only thing that snapped Dean back to the real world. He cleared his throat, taking a step away from Cas, his back smacking into the tie display.
"I know you said not to worry, that you're not mad at me," she started, catching Dean's eyes and holding them. He felt like he'd be a huge jerk if he looked away, even if it was awkward. "But I still want to make it up to you," she continued, a light shade of red tinting her pale cheeks. "Forget about John trying to set us up, or whatever. This is me asking, Dean. Do you want to- would you like to go on a date tomorrow night?" she managed to get out.
"Okay," Dean breathed, his heart slowing finally. At least he finally got this all out, finally got to talk to Bobby about it. The one person who's support mattered most, who could actually stand up to John if the situation arose. "It looks like it's getting kinda late. I should go meet up with Sam and everyone else for dinner. Maybe I'll see you over there?"
Dean swallowed his food, letting himself glance at Cas for just a few seconds. "Uh, yeah, that's probably the plan. We need to see how much food is around so we know how long we can stay here. Hopefully enough for a few months." He didn't want to keep driving unless they had to because finding gasoline for the Impala was not easy. He may have managed to get out of siphoning the gas this time around, but Sam wasn't always so easy to convince. "We can get a few good hours of sleep tonight and I'll check it out in the morning."
“We’d just be burdening you,” Cas argued, ignoring Jack’s answer. “That’s more mouths to feed. You only have one guest room, so we’d be taking up you and Sam’s space. I appreciate the offer, Dean, really, but I know you’re just pitying us. We’ll be okay.” It wasn't about pity. Dean never pitied them at all. He knew Castiel could easily take care of himself. He was an angel after all, so how could he not? That wasn't the point. Dean liked having him around. Him and Jack both. Sam did too. But how could he come out and tell them that after only two days?
"It'll be awesome, Dean," Charlie promised. "You get to spend time with your three favorite people!"
“I have more clothes,” Dean chuckled, digging through his drawers to find something for Cas to wear. This time, after he handed them over, he turned away to let Cas dress, since last time he didn’t have enough decency to look away. Besides, he needed to change his clothes too and he didn’t want Cas watching him either. He quickly put on a pair of sweatpants and tossed his t-shirt into his pile of dirty clothes. Usually, he’d wear the same clothes for a few days, but this one was covered in vampire blood.
At that moment, as if the universe felt the need to prove Dean wrong, Cas and Jack walked in the door holding plates of food. A small smile graced Cas' lips as he sat down on the couch next to Dean, setting the plate in Dean's lap. There was a normal amount of space between them, but it felt intimate after the events of last night.
After a second time of Dean banging on the door impatiently, Cas finally worked up the nerve to open it and greet him. For a moment, they stood there in the doorway. Cas was admiring Dean's green eyes and the way they matched the long sleeved green shirt he wore, complimented by dark blue jeans that hugged his legs in all the right places. Dean wasn't so much admiring Cas as he was studying him, as if there might be something wrong with him. Cas realized he was checking to see if something was wrong and quickly gave Dean his best smile, hoping it was enough to assure him he was fine.
“God, no, shut the fuck up,” Dean gagged, shoving her even farther way from him. “I was just wondering. . . if you’ve ever been into girls?”
“I figured that would be your answer,” Crowley sighed, shaking his head. “I guess I’ll keep the deal with your father. He’ll continue to sacrifice twelve innocent people each year. Fine by me.”
"What the hell are you talking about?" he snapped, keeping his voice down too, just in case Cas could hear them.
Jo’s red face said it all. She only got flustered like that when it was about Charlie. “I told her about my feelings for her, but not that I. . . you know, love her, or whatever.” She stared at her feet as they walked. “I didn’t want to scare her away.”
Dean eventually slumped back against a tall tree, the bark digging uncomfortably into his back as he sank to the ground. He had been walking for hours probably. The sun was close to setting, so it was late afternoon. Cas was probably going to be headed home soon, most likely expecting Dean to be there. Dean felt a pang of guilt knowing that he was probably worrying Cas a lot, considering the circumstances of him walking out in the first place. He just couldn’t go back yet because he knew Cas, or Sam, or
“You don’t give the orders around here,” John snapped, shoving Dean against the wall harder, the pressure on his chest making it hard to breathe. “Get the hell out of here before I-”
The tour took a couple hours, but John was thorough. He showed them all the different places to work, explained more about the supernatural barrier, and took them around the entire neighborhood before bringing them back around to their house. They didn't do much talking except for John, and Jack's occasional question, but that was it.
Cas chuckled softly, carding a hand through Dean’s bedhead. “It’s our day off, Dean,” he said, kissing the corner of Dean’s mouth.
“I’m so sorry, Dean,” she said after a moment of silence, her expression genuine. Despite what Dean’s father did to her, she still trusted Dean. He was a little surprised, but then again, she did see him as some kind of hero. Dean didn’t think so, but she did, so that was all that mattered. He had to keep her, and everyone else, safe. “How did you find out?”
"Cas, Dean said I could have this room," Jack shared, sitting on the bed as he ran his hands over the new bedspread. "It's the smallest, but that's okay. I get my own room. I've never had my own room." He was still smiling that contagious grin of his, making Cas chuckle as he leaned against the opposite side of the door frame as Dean. This all felt so domestic, Dean was starting to enjoy it. "Not that I minded sharing a room with you, Cas. This is just a nice change."
Dean narrowed his eyes, searching her face to see if she was joking. It didn't seem like she was. "We're still doing that? I thought since I'm with Cas now that we were just pretending?" He appreciated her help and willingness to lie to John, but he didn't expect her to want actual dates. They were friends, so hanging out wouldn't be so bad, but still. He was a little confused.
"Dude, I'm not going to hurt you," Dean said anyways, reeling away for a moment, until Cas froze, letting Dean slowly reach back to grab him. "What did I ever do to you to make you think I would hurt you?" he wondered, a genuine question.
“Since you asked nicely,” Cas murmured, slowly slipping his fingers out of Dean. The loss of Cas inside of him lasted only a few seconds before Cas’s slicked up cock was pressing against his hole. Cas gently dragged his hands down Dean’s sides, pushing in slowly as Dean breathed deep breaths into the pillow beneath him. “You’re so beautiful, Dean,” Cas whispered, a heavy hand pressed against the small of Dean’s back as Cas’s hips came flush against Dean’s ass. “I love you like this.”
Dean realized he probably looked like a crazy maniac and considering Jack was technically only like five years old, he most likely looked pretty scary. He took a deep breath, moving his hand to Jack’s shoulder to look him in the eye. “Don’t worry, kid. Everything is going to be fine. I just need you to go to Charlie’s and stay there until I come back. Got it?”
“Dean,” Cas whispered, his eyes shining as he looked at Dean like he was the most beautiful thing Cas had ever laid eyes on. Dean felt so overwhelmed, he completely forgot about his terrible idea of summoning Crowley as Cas held him. “If I lose you, that would hurt more than anything. More than
John visibly swallowed, shaking his head softly. “I had no idea, Dean. I swear, I thought she left on her own. Does she. . . does she know what happened to her?” he asked, the panic settling in his eyes. Of course, that was what he was worried about. If Kaia remembered, John could be in big trouble. Unfortunately, she didn’t, so John was in the clear for now. Until Dean could learn more, he couldn’t point any fingers publicly.
