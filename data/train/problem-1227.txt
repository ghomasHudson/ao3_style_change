Elizabeth caught a hiccup of stifled distress from Miss Darcy. She moved smoothly forward to the table, selecting a choice handful of cherries and, incidentally, shielding the younger woman from Miss Bingley’s scrutiny.
The King received him in the same room as before. Unmitigated black. That described the King’s garb and his expression, both. There was an officer standing off to one side; not restrained in irons but plainly under arrest, notwithstanding. The King gestured to him as Darcy entered.
“Mrs Annesley, do you think it’s true? I mean, that it’s really the Duke of Malham’s younger son who’s behind cutting the Great North Road and kidnapping the bishop?”
“So he has obtained some sort of librarianship with –” She boggled at the scrawl which followed, of which ”Lady“ and ”urgh“ were the only legible portions. ”With some great lady with Court connections? And so he proposes a reconciliation? How provoking of the man. Why could he not keep quarrelling with you, as his father did before?"
“So,” Lizzie concluded, her eyes dancing despite the horrors that she had just recounted, “ended the wedding night of the Lady of Zalona.”
“Come with me, now, to the Bishop of Zalona. I am bound to him in any event, but my message touches on your affairs, or so I believe. And sanctuary cannot be refused, to those in need.”
Elizabeth nodded, her heart to full to speak. Seated in the place of honour, in the forward-facing seat of the carriage, Miss Hooper produced a silver bottle from her reticule, dropped some liquid from it onto a fine lawn handkerchief and dabbed her temples. Elizabeth’s nostrils caught the sharp scent of peppermint oil.
A great shout went up from the rear of the convoy. Tillotson and Greene, the most accomplished poachers for five leagues around, must have managed to sneak up on the last two coaches, wedge their wheels and slash the traces while all eyes were turned to the barrier ahead.
“It is not Colonel Forster of whom I speak but of the regiment’s commander-in-chief, the Duke of Malham. My husband has had a hint from a correspondent in town, a reliable man, close to the inner workings of the Court. It would seem that the Duke of Malham stands on shaky ground at present. The King showed most cold to him at a recent levee. Many noted the Duke did not make one of the Royal party at Christmas morning Mass. It is given out by his people that an old tertian fever has flared up, but those who read such signs and portents daily wonder if the next step will be a summons to the Catiff’s Tower.”
) in his capacity as almoner to the shrine. He will forward it to you, of course. Get word to me instantly. We shall be staying
Having feared hysterics or sobbing, Jonathan found her cool assessment a blessed relief. “With one chance to make the shot, you’d not have been able to rely on a musket. A rifle-gun might have the range, but trust me, ma’am, if
In any event, the presence of the regiment meant every family in the district had put forth their best efforts to entertain the officers. They had seen far more of their neighbours than they could have expected, especially given the sombre season.
He took a deep breath, and told her everything, as he had heard it: the cardinal with the bee in his bonnet about illegitimacy, the opinion that mere propinquity of the reputed parents during the relevant time was not determinative of legitimacy in the offspring, the accident which had happened to that opinion aboard ship, up to and including the reconstitution – forgery, indeed – of the Papal seal, with a highly unorthodox addition to make up the bulk of the wax.
Her companion looked amused. “Why should you? At the time it would have been considered just a local tragedy – madness, a feud, a joint suicide, who knows?”
of his personal guard to escort it? Twice the escort he sent for Miss Darcy and this time through the garden of Gondal, not the wilds of the north. A cynical man might say it shows where his true priorities lie.”
His housekeeper’s voice was very steady. “If you’ll forgive my mentioning it, sir, your mother, Lady Anne, always loved the moors. And her favourite fruit was the pomegranate. I think such an arrangement would have pleased her more than anything else in the world.”
That girl, the one from the villa at Elbe had called his name, screamed out, “Giulio, Giulio” like some lovelorn
“You have my solemn word I shall not breathe a syllable of this matter. But what has this to do with the King sending forty troopers to Rosings? Miss Hooper is already in Gondal Town, and, besides, this is not the Great North Road. Surely there can be no danger of bandits
Suppressing a sneezing fit, Molly knelt, unlocked the trunk and groped down through multiple layers of childhood. Her fingers closed at last over the talisman. She exhaled, fingering its familiar shape. The woman to whom she might have brought it was dead these nine years: no help from that quarter this side of the Judgement. And were she
As if by way of apology, Lady Agnes glanced down at Molly, who had resumed her seat. Molly made a get-on-with-it gesture.
“For a poor relation?” The King’s tone was thoughtful. “You surprise me, Fitzwilliam. A most valid point indeed. My sister should arrive in Gondal Town by dinner time today. Perhaps I should consult her on how long she feels it may take before she can be properly attired for so auspicious an occasion. I shall order the ball postponed, to a date to suit. But – you
Not, in truth, that she was minded to object. The beauties she had glimpsed from the road proved even more enchanting as they approached the sea. The argosy itself, once they reached the quayside, was an imposing, towering beast, the port itself a bustling delight, full of exotic smells and sights. She found a convenient palm to give shade, and with Giulio’s help arranged Molly’s stool, stand and parasol to that lady’s satisfaction.
“That all went off very well, my dear. And now, I believe Mrs Reynolds was saying something about tea in the Blue drawing room.”
They could hardly have been there a quarter of a turn when a dull, booming roar shattered the afternoon. Then another. Mrs Annesley grasped Georgiana’s wrist in an inexorable grip.
“That’s as well, sir; we’ve a long journey tomorrow, once you’re married; it’s a good step to Gondal Town from here, and let us pray your aunt and uncle have yet to leave town for the summer, or it’ll be a longer journey yet. But I have the horses all in hand” – a nod to the ostler – ”and a dinner prepared for you at your lodging, for as you know, sir, it would be terrible bad luck for you and your lady to dine together or stay under the same roof on your wedding eve."
His valet, credit to him, had anticipated the summons. The clothes he had selected for Darcy were judged to a nicety for a gentleman of the first rank paying a call upon the senior branch of his family. That is, they were of self-embroidered silk brocade in the soberest colours and the most impeccable cut. All the proper accoutrements were to hand, including a plumed hat with fresh feathers and an ebony stick with a silver top. Darcy let it slide through his gloved hand so its ferrule thumped on the hall floor: he hoped the footman decoded the message.
“Thank you, my dear. Sometimes, you remind me so much of your dear mother. I recall when when she had her coming-out ball the Duke was there. He was
His account of Wickham’s early life and connections with the Pemberley family differed from Wickham’s own only in that Wickham had, if anything, understated the degree of interest the late Mr Darcy had taken in his young protégé. He had indeed treated Wickham as a second son, sending him to the University in white-steepled Zalona where, free from the constraints of home, Wickham had somehow ingratiated himself into a fast, aristocratic set, who inclined towards Prince James as the promise of all that was novel and fashionable.
The Gaaldinian nodded, and with an almost unconscious courtesy refilled the goblet from the wineskin lying, flaccid and mouth-knotted, at the far end of the table and handed it to Julian.
The expression on Molly’s face was like sunrise through spring trees. “It would be extraordinary were he not. While Queen Iphigenia lived, one might almost forget the Crown Prince of Gaaldine was his brother’s heir presumptive, not heir apparent. Her death in that sea wolf raid changed everything. Another year could see Mycroft of Gaaldine married with a son of his own and the Crown Prince one step removed from the succession. Such an event would give signal encouragement to the disaffected within Gondal.”
Harriet gestured meaningfully to Bingley, and then, he being unresponsive, to Jane. Her daughter, more familiar with the family signal-book than her betrothed, immediately rose to her feet and begged Bingley that they might take advantage of the cool of the day and stroll through the shrubbery towards the water-meadows before the picturesque early mists might have been burnt off by the sun.
The Surgeon-General eyed him. “Well, then we’d best hurry, hadn’t we? Give the salmon to your mess-mates, nonetheless, with my compliments. As I learnt at Vannstown, if the imminent fight is hopeless, at least it’s a comfort to meet it well-fed.”
He must make sure to spread the rumour as far and fast as possible once he had enough details to ensure Miss Georgiana’s credit and that of the Darcy family would be sunk beyond hope. His smile widened as he realised how apt a weapon his garrulous and indiscreet new mother-in-law was to achieving that task. And if his suspicions that Elizabeth had come to cherish designs – however hopeless – in Mr Darcy’s direction were true, how much more complete his revenge.
He let his eyes fall shut. They remained shut for what felt an eternity. They were still shut when he answered.
Miss Hooper’s letter did not, to Harriet’s mind, convey the discontent which might be expected from a woman who in one week had lost a trusted manservant and the most celebrated necklace in the whole of Gondal. Rather, Harriet felt, indeed, it exuded a certain quiet satisfaction, almost the air of one who had successfully put one over on someone in authority.
The gangway was down and two men in the act of disembarking; one a fresh-faced, boyish clerk with an armful of papers and his companion an older man, whose military bearing was slightly marred by a sort of stiffness about the shoulders.
“No, thank you. There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
The genius of her stratagem became clear with every moment of their tour of the house. Despite Charlotte’s broad hints that she should be allowed the bride’s customary prerogative of showing off her new home to her family, Mr Collins insisted on carrying out that office. The most scrupulous of inventory-takers could not have accused him of omitting the smallest chest or the most insignificant of platters. Only Charlotte’s intervention on the grounds that her sister and friend were drooping from thirst and hunger saved Maria and Elizabeth from a similarly exacting tour of the pastures and outbuildings.
Nonetheless, he was the only hope the incarcerated Georgiana Darcy had. And this time he was not going to fail in his mission.
was supposed to mean. No doubt the Crown Prince would expand on it if she enquired further, but equally without doubt she would in the process end up far better informed on the inward life of the Crown Princess’s physician and his relations with his family than either of them could possibly desire.
For a moment, Mama’s expression remained stony. Then, it broke apart in a broad grin. “Penelope, if only you could stay with us forever. You always lift my spirits when you come. Now, take my arm. Lizzie will introduce you to the Colonel and dear Wickham and I shall procure hot spiced wine, to stave off the risk of your having taken cold.”
Captain Lennox’s face changed. He stepped aside, and uttered a low-voiced command to the duty officer, who saluted and vanished.
Frances shivered, remembering the precautions the men of their own party had made when they, too, ventured the high passes between Gondal and Gaaldine. That had been high summer. But Charis must have set out with winter snows already on the peaks. Not a time for opportunistic theft.
Safety, indeed, appeared to be the watchword for her journey. Giulio rode on the box of the carriage and he and the coachman bore both pistols and daggers. Long guns rested along the coach roof. Her uncle, too, arrived accompanied by two well-armed servants.
Still, only fools looked to the past. It was as well Lyddie and he would be out of this place in less than a turn. There would be many opportunities on the borders, especially given what he knew. Also, given a delightful and energetic young bride, he would avoid many of his earlier stumbling blocks. His debts were cleared and the world was open before him.
It was too dark to see if the Bishop rolled his eyes but the studied restraint in his voice spoke volumes.
His upwards glance had not been lost on his cousin. He swivelled round on his chair and gestured towards the portrait. “Mother and daughter; such a speaking resemblance, would you not say?”
“Maria, please could you send this letter on my behalf to Longbourn? My husband may be looking for his second-eldest daughter so I wish him to know that Lizzie and I have departed on a pilgrimage to a certain shrine to the Virgin, not far from Gondal Town, to pray for a safe outcome for my unhappy youngest. Should there be any answering letter, not that I think it likely, I have directed it to go to Federico (don’t tell me you have forgotten
That day she had manoeuvred her family out of the principal parlour in order to leave Jane and Bingley together, despite Lizzie’s totally absurd attempts to prevent her. She had spent a nervous turn and a half upstairs in her room, with embroidery she had no spirit for, a book she had no interest in reading and a half-finished letter to Penelope, to which she added not a word, until the sounds of light, running footsteps on the landing outside alerted her to Lizzie’s presence upstairs. She opened the door a fraction, intending to ask if there were news, but the expression on her second-oldest daughter’s face as she passed on the way to her own room told her all she needed.
“I heard a little. I would like to hear more: now my fluency with the language has improved, perhaps I shall understand them better.”
From the way the boy’s eyes widened, the reward amounted to far more money than he had ever seen in his life before. He kept a protective hand over it, even as he stuttered, “But I didn’t find the lady. She’s been in Elbe all along.”
“His grace dived. Must have. I saw him surface, swimming. What I’ve heard, though, from two good men with their eyes and wits about them, was that Hebron
“Lydia, be reasonable,” Jane said. “How can you think of dancing, when we are in mourning for the King? And such recent mourning, too.”
would favour her late husband’s men. And the games were open to all the regiments and the prizes handed out with an open hand: ten thalers, twenty thalers, fifty thalers for third, second, first. So, also, is the the feast open to all the camp, and equally generously catered.”
“He notes that although I refused the Colonel’s suit, he confides that I cannot be unmoved at so barbaric a treatment of so loyal and long-standing a petitioner for my affections: the more so since he further confides that only my diffidence as to not having a fortune equal to the match caused me to refuse his addresses last time he made them.”
The stranger was kneeling on the window seat, wrestling with the fastenings of the casement. Julian’s mind flooded with incongrous memories. How often in the months since he entered this set had he had to advise visitors who failed to grasp the trick of it? He was across the room, his hand on the latch almost before he knew it.
she had read her daughter aright, surely just this once? Penelope, too, whose judgement was always so nice? Words tumbled from her lips, unstoppable.
Julian brought his closed fist down on the table of rough-hewn planks that was the cave’s principal concession to comfort.
“I must lie down,” Molly said. “I do not believe I am equal to dinner, though I shall ensure it is laid on the terrace at whatever hour you prefer. But do not let my weakness prevent your exploring the villa and its grounds, or further afield if you have strength for it.”
“Mama! Not so quickly! Or you’ll go off again. Oh, I thought we were going up Belmont too fast, but you
A shadow crossed the sun. He shivered: not, Molly thought, at a merely physical chill. His tone changed. There was something faint and fugitive in it, like a child crying alone in a high nursery for comfort that did not come.
How could she be so blind to a truth which, for weeks now, had been as much a part of him as his skin?
It was therefore a shock (and not a pleasant one) when, on arriving at the church one early September morning, she found not the tall, crane-like figure that she had been expecting kneeling before the reliquary in the side chapel but a small, round-faced priest with a dusty, dishevelled appearance.
As, indeed, here. Charlotte had known what Lydia was driving at before the last syllable was out of her mouth and yet here was Jane, never doubting Lydia to be ignorant of something every girl of their acquaintance would have had drummed into her since she was first out of leading-strings.
a spy had read her most recent letter, Elizabeth Duplessis must stand in sore danger of being taken up for treason. That it had gone directly from Miss Duplessis’ own hand via an intermediary not in the service of Lady Catherine took a load off her mind.
Jane’s face cleared, as she knew it would. Bessie Walnut – the very name had come from her infant lisping of a surname too hard to pronounce – had been their nursemaid, hers and Elizabeth’s. She would have been Mary’s, too, but two months before Mary’s birth Ben, the youngest footman, a shy, solemn young man with hands and feet far too big for him, had announced that expectations from a remote relative had unexpectedly matured, so he was able to realise his lifetime’s ambition of buying a run-down old inn on the road to Gondal Town, two leagues south of Meryton. More to the point, he had now found himself able to make an offer he’d been burning to utter these last three years. Bessie had accepted, and would become his wife in four weeks time.
Even double-timing up the steep hill with the sun at its zenith, Frances had enough breath to spare for idiotic questions. Inwardly, Jonathan commended her energy and deplored her timing. He jerked his head in the direction of their objective, the discreet gates some fifty paces ahead.
She looked very steadily at him. “And, if you will forgive me, you have just given a most telling illustration of what someone can expect, should they be the object of his wrath and within his reach.”
Julian made his voice very gentle. “Come, sir. The dew is rising, and we have contributed not a little to the discomforts of what can have been no easy journey. Come with me. We can talk later.”
For a moment she thought her own preoccupations had summoned him up, but no, Mr Darcy of Pemberley (
“Sir, there are many down there who will have similar stories. There are many camp-followers down there who have found themselves almost incapable of going on and then have found Lady Abruzzi there at their elbows with hot soup, clean linens and hope. Kill me here if you must, sir, to stop my treasonous mouth, but I acknowledge she has a grievance and that, in essence, the soldiers are correct. They
Rather shakily, she got to her feet. However outré the circumstances, she remained the hostess and it behooved her to check on her guests, who were distributed around the forecourt on an assortment of hastily rescued chairs, sophas, stools and benches. The Countess took in her daughter-in-law, wrapped in Molly’s blue and rabbit fur cloak, sitting on the edge of the raised parapet and whimpering quietly to herself. Deciding that was a problem she could safely leave for someone else to sort out, she crossed the forecourt to her niece who was now, she noted with amusement, wearing Captain Lennox’s dress uniform jacket around her shoulders.
She sat up, hair tousled, and let the necklace fall from one hand to the other, time after time, watching it with the fascination of a cat presented with a ball of wool.
“Please, do rise. And do be seated – oh, no-one’s put out anything for you to sit on. Please, could one of you –” (this was addressed to the attendant footmen) ”– find chairs for Mrs Collins and Miss Duplessis. Quickly, now!"
He adjusted his eyeglasses, polished them, read and read again. Her every nerve crawled at his delay. The courier had, on her order, been taken down to the kitchens, expansively fed and given their best ale. Nonetheless, an answer must be written soon, and if Clarence had a genius, it was for procrastination.
Princess Charis would have delivered that line as a self-evident truth. This woman sounded as if the power to exclude or welcome visitors was one which had only recently come into her hands and she still feared it might be snatched away.
be on Mrs Annesley’s mind. Caroline Bingley had been utterly ridiculous about it, as if they were all in danger of being murdered in their beds. Her clinginess and hysterics had become quite insupportable and ten times worse once Fitzwilliam left. Though, of course, if fear of them had hastened the Bingleys’ departure, she could hardly think badly of the brigands. Which reminded her –
It was reliably reported that her looming responsibilities had brought to a climax her simmering nervous complaint; that she had been seen grey, wan and trembling at Mass; that her house had been turned into a fortress from which only her most trusted advisors were allowed to emerge; that the State Ball, so often postponed, might suffer yet another delay were it confirmed the first lady of Gondal had entered a decline; that the Royal Physician had been summoned –
"How could her father permit such a thing? Quite apart from the matter of age, Traquair has neither rank nor fortune to recommend him, and such influence as he may once have possessed at Court–
“The Netherfield chestnuts remain fine, ma’am,” Elizabeth said. “They were putting on their spring growth when I left Meryton. But the current tenants did not come into residence until after All Souls’ Eve, and by then all the nuts had fallen. I do not know if anyone gathered them last year, or if they were left for the wild pigs.”
Her suspicion that Lady Catherine was not in the mood to render confidence for confidence was amply borne out by her ladyship’s next remark, which was
“Three days ago, I gave him permission to visit his married sister. She lives four miles past the South Gate, on the road to Charlescut Halt. I have taken Easter gifts there for her children. He remained until late: it was almost dark when he returned.”
Lizzie ducked her head. “Let Jane wear them tonight, Mama. I have my garnets, and Jane has only her little gold knots. They’re her colour, too.”
“So you will lower yourself utterly in the eyes of society, for the sake of affection and principle? No-one can say you lack determination. Or fortitude.” His lips twisted in bitter remembrance. "You remind me of someone. But that lady is hardly a model to be followed. I think you underestimate the impact on you of the fall from so great an estate as you have always enjoyed. She did and it cost her all she had.
The tall stranger uncoiled himself from the corner between the wall and the clothes-press. He had extraordinary eyes, Julian noticed with a shiver: of a sea-agate opalescence, focussed, at this precise moment, upon his night-shirted, flustered self.
Frances vividly recalled the dying firelight casting hollows and shadows across Lady Anthea’s face, and her restless hands twisting a big ruby ring round and round on her finger.
There had been fewer than half a dozen in the funeral party. The Queen and her remaining ladies made four. The cowering priest was the sole man present. Queen Felicia herself had read from the Bible in ferocious, beautifully precise Latin:
His people had made heroic efforts to turn the old, semi-derelict hunting lodge into a place where a Bishop might be welcomed. Julian’s own chamber saw evidence of solid, if crude, recent carpentry to repair rotten floorboards, and a similar smell of new sawdust and varnish breathed from the larger chamber reserved for the Bishop.
“You think so? For my own part, I believe it is a link – perhaps the last link – in the chain which drags us to war.”
“Shocking, I agree, how encroaching the whole family are. This was the dark one, you may recall, from last night – no, I forget, you were swooning with pain, how could you have remarked what any of the girls of the house looked like, especially since they were all so – not plain, precisely, apart from that gawky peering one, who had the head ache, but all so blowsy and unpolished. And so
If Elizabeth had cherished dreams of wrapping her aching feet in wet towels, and then taking her strained body to an early bed, they were forestalled. Mr Collins met them on the threshold, waving a note about his head and babbling so that it was almost impossible to take his meaning and, when she did, Elizabeth was taken aback to such a degree that she could not but speak her doubts aloud.
“Mama,” Lizzie murmured, though the new arrival had made no request to be introduced, “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.”
Some time later, Colonel Fitzwilliam and his aide-de-camp, Captain Lennox strolled out onto the stone terrace outside the officers’ mess. The air struck fresh compared to the stuffiness of the the mess, but the tumult arising from the camp – previously muffled by the mess’s thick walls – was less welcome.
How old was Mr Darcy: twenty-five? Twenty-six? Born into a great family within a country on the cusp of civil war or into the juddering aftermath of civil war narrowly averted. Harriet understood what he was trying to tell her, and no-one else was saying anything. Clearly it was up to her.
Which was doubtless true, but left Elizabeth wondering how many of them remained out there, up and down the country, still loyal and honest, but to whom?
If Papa had once been a passionate adherent of Queen Felicia’s cause, the ashes of that passion were cold past rekindling. But, it occurred to her with a stab of apprehension, if Mr Darcy was misinformed on the point, so too might be the King. Her most imprudent attempt to contact her uncle could then be seen in the worst possible light. Mr Darcy’s next words confirmed it.
Harriet eyed him distrustfully. True, the discovery of Giulio’s treachery had taken the Crown Prince’s idiotic plan to marry Lizzie precipitately to Mr Darcy completely off the table. Proceeding would have been tantamount to marching up to the door of the Caitiff’s Tower and begging the gaolers to admit them straight to the torture chambers. Equally luckily, that revelation had come before she had broached the business to Lizzie, though she could not acquit herself of having raised a few false hopes. But surely Mr Darcy might at least have contrived some words of apology or regret, or non-specific future hope, not the absolute silence which had prevailed for almost a month, as if –
Miss Duplessis, his own angel! Of course Mr Perry would have seen her working with the poor. It was one of those things expected of the proprietors of a country estate, but doubtless she would still have done it had she been a cottager’s daughter herself. Of course, neither he nor Caroline had lived in the country before, so it would be important to find out what was proper from one who knew all about it, to avoid giving offence. An excellent thought: it would promote friendship between Caroline and the two elder Duplessis girls, so much to be desired. Naturally the circumstances of their arrival had put Caroline at a disadvantage, the thing in all the world she hated most, but it could all be smoothed out now.
“So now it comes, does it, boy? You’ve softened me up, now you wish to break me? Doubtless your couriers are already on the way to Gondal Town, bearing your demands for ransom. Is that your game, hey?”
“My husband delights in his garden,” Charlotte confided to her as they passed for the first time beneath her roof. “He devotes hours to tending it.”
As she entered the private parlour of the inn, its grandest apartment, her first sight was her aunt’s face. Mrs Gardiner was all-too obviously struggling with mixed emotions: surprise, pleasure and wild conjecture as to what this honour could mean. Then she was face to face with Mr Darcy and he was requesting her permission to make her known to his sister.
She flipped up her voluminous skirts and sank, emphatically, to the rock in question. Taking her cue, Georgiana sank down next to her and began to set up her easel.
“James Moran is dead. I did not kill him, though if it protects the one who did I am happy to be blamed.” He paused. “I can, however, take the credit of returning him to his native land. And to his King. In a manner befitting both men.”
Gracefully, Lady Anthea inclined her head. “How unexpected to see you here. His Grace – we all supposed you to be still in the country. How may I assist you?”
"And so have you, my child. But not here. There is a south wind rising and war may spill across the borders at any time. You have family north of Gondal Town, I believe? Write to them. A woman needs her mother beside her at a time such as this. It is the natural order of things; not the fussiest of husbands or most overbearing of patrons can gainsay it. Go to your mother, my child.
“Indeed I can, and on the best authority. One of my husband’s business correspondents (Italian merchants, though the family is of Spanish origin, I believe) wrote to him recently. The poor man was quite distracted. His only daughter had been induced to leave her family’s protection and put herself into the power of one of the King’s inner circle, a lord with a terrible reputation, exiled for years by King Ambrosine. The Italian merchant hoped my husband might be able to reach out to send a message to his daughter so she knew her friends still cared for her and would receive her should she leave this lord’s protection. He tried his best, but all attempts to pass that message failed. In the end Mr Gardiner found himself confronted – positively confronted – by masked bravos with cudgels who made it quite clear what he might expect if he continued to stick his nose into his Lordship’s affairs.”
Mrs Reynolds jerked her head towards the window. “One of the gardener’s boys came running in with a message. There’s a party of troopers down at the South Lodge. Wearing the Royal livery, ma’am. They’d be here now, but the lodge-keeper’s wife begged them try her best ale and they were that hot and dusty with travelling in the heat that the officer gave them leave and very grateful they were, so Jim said. But they’ll be with us in under a quarter of a turn, and what are we to do?”
“As luck would have it, I came across them not five hundred strides up the road, ’cause one of them had to stop to fix his creel. A strap had split, and a sorry job he were making of it, too. Naturally, being as how I’d learnt my knots before I learnt to scratch my name, I hopped off my mule and asked if I could help any. I got the creel fixed – in truth, I could have done it in half the time, but I wanted to hear what they had to say, and very much to the purpose it was. He was on his way to Hunsford, too. The other two turned off on their different ways, and we went on together.”
For a moment, Darcy paused. He looked once again towards the groom and the stableman, who were now, apparently, considering the merits of a compress and getting somewhat excitable about it. He began to speak rapidly, still in the same undertone, so Charles had to strain to hear.
“Then, as a loyal subject, nothing would please me more than relieving the anxieties of the King. Provided I can do so without harm to my own honour or that of anyone else.”
“Now, here’s the two thalers we promised to give you for delivering the letter. Since we were overheard I don’t think you’ve got much hope of hiding them, though good luck to you if you bring it off. So this
The trees here had been cut down for timber eight years ago; not wantonly (for the Darcys had always been careful of their timber, which represented much of Pemberley’s wealth) but in a broad strip later replanted with saplings, which were now thigh-high and served as cover for all sorts of wildlife. They were, Darcy thought abstractedly, overdue for thinning. When all this was over, he would have to instruct his foresters.
she had managed to bring off the pun on “sold” as in “exaggerating the best points of a dubious horse” and “sold” as in “slave.”
Charlotte had intended to travel with her up to that point, so they could say their farewells at the last possible moment, but she had woken with a megrim. At the sight of her greenish face and drawn brow, her friend and her husband were, for once, unanimous in their desire that she return to her bed. Their parting under such circumstances was perfuctory. Though Elizabeth formed the distinct impression that Charlotte had something she wished to confide, all that was possible was a quick pressure of the hand, and a fervent, albeit low-voiced, wish that she might be safe, both on her travels and on her coming home.
She saw a quick flash of calculation in Wickham’s eye: the look, perhaps, of a man making a mental note on some unseen ledger. Elizabeth rushed on, to cover her slip.
He sounded like a man without doubt of the answer. That surprised Harriet not at all. Half a dozen treasonous plots had been uncovered since the accession of Prince James. She had seen the heads on pikes above the gates of the capital.
“Coupled with wormwood, to warn that the advice will leave a bitter taste in the mouth? Wormwood on its own, of course, would simply signal ‘bad news’.”
The luxury of tears, though, had to be postponed for a little. She reached for her writing case, and began a letter, the words tumbling over themselves as if coming from a well uncapped within her.
Harriet suppressed an obvious retort. Clarence was not deaf, save when he chose to be. His non-appearance must, therefore, be put down to his feeling unequal to company at this late hour. Further, he shrank from the messily physical, with a scholar’s combination of disgust and disdain. Anyone who presumed to think that Clarence, merely by virtue of his sex, was better suited to reduce a dislocated shoulder than the daughter and sister of Royal physicians was a fool, and an arrogant one, too, however magnificent his estate.
“Well, stands to reason you’d pick up a sight of queer trades, hearing confession day in day out,” Jonathan observed. “So tell us about your part in it.”
“Indeed not.” Elizabeth slid into place opposite Charlotte and reached for a roll. Their eyes met in perfect understanding across the bread-basket.
Harriet became acutely aware that she was no longer alone in the chapel. She barely slid her eyes sideways, but was conscious of the tall Prioress to her left, kneeling at the rail telling her rosary – a wonderful thing, that rosary, carved in a deep rich ivory, the beads marking each decade carved in the fashion of a musical instrumen: little fiddles, hautboys, lutes all complete.
The letter was handed over, the die was cast, and Elizabeth watched the carriage rattle away round the bend of the south-bound road.
“The Duke and Duchess used to bring the boys to stay at Pemberley, when I was much younger.” Georgiana spoke quickly, and rather at random.
Three years older, and with a soldier’s knowledge of the world, Colonel Fitzwilliam did not derive from this intelligence a perfect conviction that Georgiana saw Bingley as husband material. He contented himself by saying, “Charles Bingley’s fortune is new, but honestly got, by all accounts.”
The Earl had even commanded a regiment in his youth: had, indeed, formed part of the military escort for Princess Felicia when with one decisive stroke she had stopped an incipient civil war in its tracks by riding across two opposing battle lines to propose marriage to her royal cousin Ambrosine. He had shot with the late Duke of Malham and with Darcy’s father. If anyone knew Malham lands and the military conundrum they presented, that man was the Earl.
The words came stumbling out of Lady Agnes’ mouth. "N-nobody, your grace. Anyway, the second time Miss Hooper returned, she asked if Lady Abruzzi would give her the chance to take revenge and she agreed –”
One of those fine-drawn brows arched. “Nothing? The signet ring on your little finger would feed a peasant family for a year.”
For the first time, he saw the Surgeon-General momentarily disconcerted. “The Pretender preferred Traquair to the War Office?
Mrs Gardiner shook her head. She rose to her feet, opened the main door to the landing, and then, similarly, opened the servants’ entrance which was concealed behind a screen in one corner. Only once these precautions were complete did she resume.
“And so, Charlotte, we had to put up with all three of them for the best part of a se’ennight. Of all the boiling, Mr Bingley had the best reason for staying put. He needed to see his shoulder recovered from the abuse it had suffered and would not leave until Mr Perry assured him he was fit to travel. His friend Mr Darcy feared that one or the other of us would bewitch his friend were he to turn his back and so he
“Wherever you go, I will go. Your people shall be my people: your God, my God. Wherever death finds you, there will he find and take me, too, and we shall lie in the same grave. This promise I give you, I swear before that God. He may revenge himself three times over if anything less than death part you and me.”
“Whatever is afoot, it would, I think, be wise not to bruit it abroad. The letter spoke of Miss Hooper’s exhaustion, of her need for rest, seclusion and contemplation.” He frowned. “It is to be hoped she has not inherited her father’s constitution.”
“You talk big for a man with a blade at his neck.” The bravo’s sneer came from uncomfortably close to his left ear.
She rose to her feet, tucking the talisman inside her bodice. Time was running out and with it her power to make choices. Before the end, her brother would have mastery over the thoughts of every being in Gondal. A dry laugh, almost a sob, broke out of her. He was the cleverest man in the whole kingdom, subtle as the serpent and far deadlier, but she saw their Aunt Catherine in him, even if no-one else did.
“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”
The last few days had been trying. Even the prospect of tea and of having Pemberley to herself at last (except for Mrs Annesley, who did not count) failed entirely to soothe Georgiana’s ruffled spirits.
Could that doll have grown into someone who could credibly topple James of Gondal from his throne? The Gaaldinian thought so, at any rate, and he had seen her most recently. He had arrived out of the mist, as the Prince had told him his counsellors in these ventures would: without name, without rank, without anything save for a rectangle of cloth, tightly stitched in whitework, by way of passport.
had not spent the last twenty years trying (and mostly failing) to run a country estate on a shoestring, starting from a position of blank, town-bred ignorance. If he had, he would not assume that women knew nothing of butchery. Nor would he assume them unaware how thin the line ran between privation and plenty, even for minor gentry. The difference, one might say, between saving blood to make black puddings and wantonly letting it swirl down the drain. The difference between avoiding inconvenient truths in front of a daughter’s wealthy suitor and rubbing his nose in them.
The management of her guests took a great deal of planning. Mr Bingley, thank goodness, could be kept away from it all by having two footmen help him to the Blue Room where his valet could undress him and put him to bed.
Once again, Charles found himself feeling that a little less reserve on his friend’s part might conduce towards fewer complications all round.
The stuffed expression Darcy assumed in the face of such blatant flattery tempted Charles to giggle.
He half turned, to see her aunt and uncle ambling along some distance in the rear. He waved encouragingly towards them, but Elizabeth fancied he quickened his pace a little, as if to ensure that was he was about to say was heard by the two of them alone.
Clarence’s voice sounded as if he could barely comprehend what he had read. Harriet, despite having had half a turn to digest the letter’s contents, sympathised.
Much cheered by the day, she ordered a carafe of ratafia and retired to her study to finish the letter to Lydia she had started that morning. None of her previous ones had yet received an answer, but she calculated that the festivities of which Wickham had spoken, the funeral games for Colonel Abruzzi, must now have happened, or would have done so by the time her letter arrived, at least, and Lydia was not one to miss the chance to talk over the shade of a departed party, not even by letter.
“I am glad to hear it. But this is not the place to swap family gossip, but to create it. After all, it is not the first time that you have exerted yourself to rid me of a suitor. People may talk.”
The footmen responded instantly, but with a palpable air of discombobulation. Elizabeth suspected neither Lady Catherine nor her domestic staff had expected the visitors to be invited to sit in Miss Hooper’s presence. Furthermore, when the majestic silver coffee urn was wheeled in, surrounded by filigree baskets full of loukum and candied fruits, little pastries and spiced, stuffed dates, Miss Hooper smiled at the servants and told them they need not stay.
“I have too much faith in your judgment, Lizzie, to fear that you will fall in love simply because you are warned against it, so I can speak openly. Your friend Wickham seems a most interesting young man; had he the fortune he deserves, I could hardly suppose you could do better. But, Lizzie, you must know he does not have that fortune.”
“Madam. How fortunate it is that I should encounter you. I am bid by my colonel to present his compliments and heartfelt thanks for the hospitality you extended to him, to myself and to my fellow officers last night. Your servant, ma’am.”
“It risked troubling the Court. It was wise for her to seek refuge in the country immediately after news came of Reaching Beck, rather than stay to let rumours start. Such a deplorable sink of gossip, the palace. One has to contrive an escape from it, however one can. How went her stay at Rosings?”
Harriet sighed. “And my youngest daughter is within the hour entering into a patched up marriage with a man with whom she has been living this past fortnight. I agree. It seems we are
A clout from some blunt instrument early in the struggle knocked him insensible. After a long, blurry, nauseous interval, he woke properly to find himself in bed; a proper bed, albeit one located in a white-washed room with a small barred window and a solid iron-bound door. A store-room, recently repurposed into a holding cell, he guessed. He rather thought it might have last been used to store apples.
uncouth, but they are the truest and most loyal one could ever hope to find. Georgiana has grown up among them; our tenants would do anything for her. May I offer you refreshment? Tea, or lemonade, or ratafia? Military gentlemen, I know, are often partial to ratafia of a hot afternoon when their duties permit and Colonel Fitzwilliam, Miss Georgiana’s other guardian, has said that Mrs Reynolds’ ratafia is some of the finest he has ever tasted."
Mrs Annesley rose to her feet and walked to the window which commanded a view of the south drive. “Did they drop any hint of what their errand is?”
felt for her spouted forth in one overpowering torrent. To be fair, he expressed himself well: at least while he confined himself to the warmth and sincerity of his feelings. Once he veered away from that safe topic onto his sense of her inferiority, his expectation their marriage would be taken as degradation by all the principal part of his family up to and including the King himself; onto the personal and political obstacles he foresaw and the family feelings he would undoubtedly wound by his proposed course of action, Elizabeth’s initial regret that she must refuse him was overcome first by resentment, and then with outright anger.
“A couple of courtiers have a smattering. But you are correct in your assumption. It is not the most obvious language to learn and knowing it conveys little status.” He waited.
“My brother sent the cream of the capital’s crop to my bedside earlier this year. They muttered in Latin, bled me and made me drink foul draughts. I felt worse when they had finished than when they had started.”
What distinguished the step of that particular animal from all the other beasts of burden he had let pass, Frances never knew. Still, Jonathan leapt to his feet, and a moment later the ship’s boy from the

“A carriage accident? Oh, what a shocking thing to happen. Come in, come in and sit down. You must be frozen and so shaken, too. Girls, make space on the sopha. These are our new neighbours. Kitty: find Mrs Hill and tell her to have the maids prepare the Blue Room, the Yellow Room and the Ottoman Room. And to bring brandy – and tea – and soup – and cold meats – Oh, what a poor All Souls Night you have had of it so far, but let us remedy that. What may we have the pleasure of getting for you?”
spotted her quality, first of all the family but me. Oh, Aunt Catherine told us all about your youthful passion, and how cruelly your father and the Earl pronounced it must not be. I was travelling myself, of course, and no hint of the news was permitted to reach me, or there might have been a different outcome.”
Frances let her eyes fall shut, the better to allow her mind to float free. The Crown Prince’s voice continued, a low burbling counterpoint to her thoughts.
not leave while her brother was unavailable to act as her protector in this wild and lawless land. Or so, at least, she told us.”
“In a matter of such moment, I believe I need to return to the capital and convene a family council with respect to our next steps. You and your troop will escort me, at least as far as Deadholm Barracks. New orders may have reached there by now. Ready your men to leave at dawn. Oh and warn them; our departure is bound to give rise to surmise, but ensure no particulars of this message are bruited abroad.”
Mrs Gardiner smiled. “You should not assume, Lizzie, that conduct someone applauds in a play is likely to be welcome if translated into the domestic circle.”
Years of self-control gave Darcy the advantage. He nodded a brief acknowledgement to the King, then fixed the officer with a glare as cold and precise as he could command.
. A clean sheer plummet. No windmilling of arms. He made no attempt to break his fall. Ma’am, I’ve seen people go like that off battlements in a siege. But I’ve never known any
would be remembered. When a moor fire catches, nothing can stand before it, and the peat below ground smoulders and breaks out unexpectedly, even when the flames seem to have been thoroughly extinguished. So, too, runs gossip, and so it flares.
“But, leaving aside the past, should you not consult my niece before mbrangling your finances to such a degree? It is all but give out in Gondal Town that it only awaits the State ball for your engagement to Miss Hooper to be announced. You can hardly expect my niece to affiance herself to a beggar.”
“So, Musgrave, are you planning to take me in? Good business, that, I grant you. In Gondal Town, the King’s reward would buy you out of the Army, free and clear, and leave enough over to buy that village tavern you always talked of.”
Now both were tied to a Longbourn where their mother’s simmering resentment over her multiple disappointments all too often erupted into lachrymose outbreaks of self-pity, met with cutting sarcasm or speaking silence from their father. It was like walking through a powder magazine.
Before the waiting-woman had been peremptorily required to resume her place in the carriage, Hill had managed to extract from her a tale of fire, theft, high play and Royal disapprobation which (even after both Harriet and her housekeeper had applied generous quantities of salt to the narrative) left both of them somewhere between exhilarated and aghast.
“I understood you to say that she left the wedding party at her father’s request? Did her father say why he changed his mind? For surely, he must have consented to her being one of the party in the first place.”
The Crown Prince’s tone held a searing heat it had lacked before. “Whether Mycroft the First married the woman or not, David was our uncle; mine and my brother’s. Tell me, sir, what the penalty would be in Gondal for the cold-blooded murder of the King’s close blood kin? Of, say, yourself, or your sister?”
He reached inside his jacket, extracted a small black velvet pouch, and tipped its contents onto the low table in front of her. The ear-bobs rolled and sparkled in the sunlight that slanted through the high windows. The courtiers ‘oohed’ and gasped.
He dropped the contents of the leather purse onto the desk. The golden light of late afternoon slanted through the small-paned windows.
Holy Virgin, would she never be able to say it? Flora’s flower had been plucked, but not by someone who would have given the delicate care to the bloom which Harriet, given half a chance, would have supplied. Flora had been left with child. Whoever the father had been, he had disowned her. Flora had sought drastic remedies and paid the price.
Cold fury overwhelmed her. “Sir, I did not invite you to share your guilt – justified or otherwise. Details, if you please.”
“I am indeed. I know your good sense, Lizzie, and I am confident you will apply it. But now I shall leave you to say your farewells to Jane.”
The wine bucked up into her throat: sour and repugnant. She fought to keep her voice under control. “Your confidential man, Giulio, had not, therefore, any business in Belmont, three days ago?”
as much moment as the year the mill burned down, or the time wild pigs overset the Gouldings’ cider press.”
“The Prince had that confirmation from King Mycroft’s former confessor. Under torture. My informant felt very sure that the Prince had himself been present while the priest was put to the torment. That if he had not performed the deed, he had lent it his authority. And that his intent from the outset had been to extort the secrets of the confessional.”
All because that odious Mr Darcy had connections to the King. Well. He was not the only one with Royal connections. Since her talk with Wickham, Elizabeth had been thinking long and hard about her Uncle John. Her memories were old but vivid. He had been the one reassuring constant in the stormy turmoil of her childhood. Now he, too, was in exile.
“I believe your cousin, Miss Molly Hooper, said something to like effect. About intelligence and its failings, I mean.”
Though back then, most of her grief had been for the Colonel’s daughter, Ruth. Dear heavens, Ruth: pale, willowy, grey-eyed and silent. Harriet had been so very much taken with Ruth during that summer the Watsons had spent at Aspin Castle, where her father had been sent as resident physician to an elderly dowager. How heavenly that summer had been, once the Royal wedding announcement lifted the shadow of civil war from the land: a brilliant succession of balls, water-parties, picnics, fireworks and treasure hunts.
“As to whom, to anyone who would listen. As to what – I gather she and the other officers’ ladies had tea in the mess-tent with Lady Abruzzi. And from what the young and indiscreet Mrs Wickham heard over the tea-cups, it seems the sums Lady Abruzzi outlaid on comforts for the troops she won playing high. In the capital. At a private salon for selected ladies of the court. Managed by no other than Lady Agnes Traquair.”
“Sir, by the oath of my calling and by the dedicated blood of my heart, I shall not disparage those set in office over me, and in all cases the dignity of rank will be preserved. Sir!”
Bile rose in Charlotte’s throat. She recalled modest ‘Mary Arba’, sketching on the quayside at Elbe, one of three gentlewoman of Elbe enjoying a holiday by the sea. She recalled a warm, friendly voice, marred by a persistent dry cough. She thought of a necklace she had never seen, pictured huge square-cut stones in archaic settings. Pictured old blood turned black in each crevice of those settings.
“Then let that be a comfort, my dear. Anyway, I shall leave you to sleep, and trust that you feel better in the morning.”
“Good God! what is the matter?” He caught her elbow. “I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr and Mrs Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
His throat was parched from the privations of his journey. His tongue seemed swollen to thrice its normal size. Still with the same air of demented cheer, Sally picked up the Bohemian crystal jug (his own, most prized Bohemian crystal jug) and poured water into a chased goblet. He recognised the goblet, too. She held it to his lips, since his hands remained bound behind his back. He swallowed greedily, even as he squirmed at the indignity of it all.
Charlotte gave her all the assurances a friend could give, especially a friend on the brink of parting from home, who seemed acutely aware of the chasm which her marriage had opened up between her and the Duplessis family. However unlovely Charlotte’s husband, he was the heir apparent of Longbourn, and a more sensible woman than Mama would surely find the prospect of being supplanted by a girl she had known from the cradle more than she could reasonably bear.
Now she saw that quality again. She thrust the letter towards him. “Read it. Read it. We are to answer within the next quarter turn. And
The shock at her aunt’s unwonted sharpness must have shown on Elizabeth’s face, because the older woman stretched out a hand and patted her shoulder.
broadside. Mr Bingley certainly did not. His forehead smoothed at once. He even essayed a weak smile.
“I daresay its master would be delighted to hear his vessel flattered so. But it is not a galleon but what they call an
“Stories differ. However, most agree that some days before the proclamation there seems to have been a meeting between the Crown Prince and the man in question – or boy, rather, since he can be no more than seventeen, or eighteen at the outside.”
Elizabeth’s story of Mary King crossed her mind. Even at this desperate junction Molly could not repress a smile. “My brother is vain; it is his most profound weakness. Had he been raised in obscurity and suddenly endowed with the greatest estate in the whole kingdom he would ensure all those who had snubbed him over the years paid back every last arrear of civility.”
That he should put her rejection down to hurt pride at his manner of confessing his love, rather than a considered and rational objection to the idea of putting her life and happiness within his sole control: well, she had the experience of rejecting Mr Collins, and – disappointingly – it would appear there was a family similarity about these affairs.
“There’s no time left, John. Look after Thetis for me, please. Adair is the most generous of men, but I can’t take his gift into the places I’m planning to go.”
a port. Seamen cast ashore are not known to respect the niceties. Also, Elbe, in particular, is very close to the border. Were trouble to arise, the instigators could be secure in Gaaldine before six turns of the glass, even against pursuit. These men are smugglers born.”
“You have, I believe, got to the heart of the matter. I do not know who this man – let us call him ‘X’ – may be and I do not wish to prejudice your own views of the matter by describing how I have reached the same conclusion. But I believe at least two, if not all three young ladies may have been the target of X, that he uses gallantry rather than any other weapon and that at least one person in Gondal shares my suspicions of X and, moreover, is in
The house was of ample size, built less than forty years ago in what was then the best modern style. The original inhabitants had still been living there when Clarence first brought her to Meryton: Sir Vernon Hooper, widower, and his daughter, Molly, a mousy thing, so self-effacing as to be almost invisible. Quite a little prodigy on the harpsichord, notwithstanding. Harriet could still remember the tooth-grinding ache of sitting in one of the Netherfield parlours throughout an interminable tinkling afternoon, fighting the headache and nausea of pregnancy, torn between twin desires to strangle the priggish little brat and to run screaming into the shrubbery.
It had not. Matters of military policy had never concerned him. Even in the days of playing toy soldiers he had grown bored with the march and counter-march which enthralled his cousins, and instead sent picked men from his leaden legions on voyages of exploration into far lands in Africa and the Indian Ocean.
Lady Catherine had always spoke of her niece as “delicate”, which Elizabeth had mentally translated to “spoilt, sickly and cross.” Now she saw Miss Hooper in the flesh, she repented her hasty judgment. Miss Hooper’s pallor, the lines around her mouth, the violet hemispheres beneath her eyes and her thinness of face bespoke either intolerable stress or chronic pain. Attributing her current collapse to a cold caught on the road must be for mere form’s sake. The signs of persistent invalidism were too well-marked to be of recent occurrence. If only Elizabeth might summon Uncle John on the spot to make a proper diagnosis.
The apothecary pursued his lips. “I do not advise you to think of stirring far until we can be quite sure you have taken no internal hurts. Perhaps by the end of the week? The lady of the house told me I must make it clear to you that you need not the smallest scruple in staying as long as you choose, until you are quite well enough to risk travelling without undoing the good work of your recovery.”
She babbled, and knew she did: blame the negus and hope coming all unheralded out of blackest despair. Then her vision cleared. She took in the shorter man’s clenched, agonised silence, the odd hunch of his shoulder under his cloak, his lopsided walk.
The people at the villa on the hill had expressed neither surprise nor objection at Jonathan’s requests. No word had been spoken of payment for the two sets of clothing with which she had been supplied, or for the services of the expert seamstress who had altered them to fit. Nor had any question been raised as to why Frances found it necessary to dress both as a sober scion of a mercantile house and a frivolous French mademoiselle. Big Gertie’s signature on their letter of introduction entitled them to infinite discretion in addition to limitless credit.
“Since coming to Gaaldine I have met very few people who know more than a word or two of English. Save for our Legation, those have been sailors or traders. I have met none but you and the King at Court.”
“Rather the reverse, or so we hope. Conflicting accounts are swirling about, and I do not doubt fresher intelligence will already have reached the Palace, but from what one can tell there has been some serious estrangement between the King of Gaaldine and his brother, the Crown Prince. This week a proclamation in the pulpits and market-places of Gaaldine required Sherlock, Crown Prince of Gaaldine to surrender to his King’s authority within twenty-one days on pain of exile.”
"Without Pemberley, without my estates here, I would be a poor man – comparatively poor, at least. But I do have investments outside the three kingdoms, should I lose my lands within. Not much, admittedly, on which to support a wife and family: some few deposits in
Jonathan fell into abashed silence. She caught a fleeting blink of “Women. Who’d have ’em?” travelling above her head between him and Giulio and fought to repress authentic anger, no matter that she had devised the strategy herself.
His thoughts abstracted, the ending of the Mass caught him by surprise. He scrambled belatedly to his feet and followed his cousin out of the chapel. Still in silence, the two men turned right by common assent, pacing the gravel path which encircled the chapel until they reached the angle between a buttress and the chapel wall which had witnessed so many confidences over the years.
His sardonic tone woke a glimmer of humour in Darcy. “No? Well, should we say I lingered at Pemberley in the hope that I might offer hospitality should my
“Improbable as it sounds, it is possible to get used to us,” the Crown Prince said, still in English.
He had not intended to be importunate; he hoped he had not sounded so. “Sir, I thank you. But that was not the point I meant to make. What I can tell you is that from everything I have heard and those who told me of it were men of credit with no reason to lie, your sister and her chaperone were treated with utter respect and offered not the smallest suspicion of insult. Once liberated, I am persuaded my troops will swear that before any tribunal in the land.”
Charlotte’s face was equally enraptured, though with a tinge of melancholy which reminded Elizabeth of angels in paintings of the Last Judgment.
“Nothing of that sort. I find myself quite without appetite.” She rose resolutely to her feet. “Miss Duplessis, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.”
“Indeed he would. His mere presence, particularly if he could find disaffected noblemen to support his claims, could provoke civil war in Gaaldine, and make it impossible for them to look northwards at us.”
“In Elbe, I wish to present myself only in the character in which I was born: a gentlewoman of Gondal, accompanied by two friends of the same rank. Not as a noblewoman, nor as a member of the Royal family. I need sea air. I need tranquility. I
“The Lieutenant will remain here, under my housekeeper’s care. He needs to recover and, in any event, if others of his troop appear, whether by escape or release, he is the only man who can confirm that they are indeed his men, and not returning deserters or impostors.”
“I have, my lord, found it hard to sleep of late. But now my worries about my daughter are allayed, I find I could sleep the clock round. You, in turn, were delayed in Council until the early hours. No-one could accuse either of us of the sin of sloth, were we to catch up on our proper repose for an hour or five.”
She fell silent, rapidly reassessing the events of the last month. If Mr Darcy had left town for Pemberley the very day Lydia had married, then the crisis which had impelled him to depart without leaving any word must have been sudden, unexpected and of no small dimensions.
“I don’t doubt it either. James Moriarty adores his neatly turned aphorisms. That one has his stamp all over it. Inaccurate, of course. We could hardly have got Moran into the herring barrel in only four pieces.”
That was news but hardly surprised Trooper Musgrave. “The Black Lion got him, did it? Explains a lot. But anyway, sir, suppose I take the fish and report to the Sarge I’ve found the doctor he sent me to look for, and you go straight up to the house, to avoid running into anyone else from the troop. I’m not saying they’d recognise you, most of them being on the youngish side, though I’d not go bail for all of them, and certainly not for the sarge. But the only one of our troop up at the house is the officer, so you’re safe enough there.”
“Madam. When we reach Italy, it would do me great honour were you to consent to become my wife. I will ask the blessings of your family upon our union when we meet them.”
“While Mr Darcy’s father lived, the Princess would often visit Pemberley with her father. As a child she was open-hearted and amiable, notwithstanding her rank, and uncommonly fond of me. You cannot imagine the dismay I felt on hearing of her marriage to the Dark Prince of Gaaldine. If rumour speaks true, King Mycroft has long used his influence to soften and conceal the vices of his brother. Who knows what such a one reveals in the seclusion of the marital chamber? It would ease my heart if there were a way to let her know her friends in Gondal keep her in their thoughts and prayers. It is what the elder Mr Darcy would have expected.
The artist gestured towards her easel and Elizabeth, who had a goodly store of pre-prepared phrases honed over the years to soothe the vanity of women whose self-worth outran their talent, found herself for once at a loss.
She tossed the necklace so high it slammed against the coffered ceiling of the bedchamber, and then plucked it left-handed out of the air on the rebound.
“Let us go. No, thank you Lizzie. I collect where we are, now, and it is but a short distance to Maria’s house. I can sit quietly there to recover myself, in the shade, not out on this horrible hot lane. Give me your arm. Thank you. Now. Let us go back to the main street.”
Wickham’s eyes passed restlessly over the dance-floor, as if looking for someone. “Your cousin’s patroness is Lady Catherine de Bourgh, is she not?”
.” She was quoting someone, but whom? She grasped for an elusive memory, tone and stress suddenly came together and she remembered.
for three whole regiments, the best part of two and a half thousand men. This entire day can have cost Lady Abruzzi not a cent less than ten thousand thalers. Many noblemen of Gondal would consider that a good year’s income.”
Silently, she closed the door and leant hard against it, heart pounding, eyes wet with tears. Jane was to marry Bingley; there was no other news which could have summoned that expression of delight to Lizzie’s face.
. Next time I could see anything, his Grace was in the water – alive, I’ll go bail on that – and holding onto Hebron.”
Jagged thoughts of betrayal flashed through his mind. They said the new King was a subtle man; the very sort to let his prey think he had escaped, only to find at the last that he had been herded into the trap all along. But if that were the case, what hope had he in resisting?
Charles’ raised eyebrows invited further explanation. His friend looked up and down the stable block. Brock was still engaged in a tense, low-voiced convocation with the chief stableman over Sultan’s off-fore. Darcy dropped his voice even further.
That degree of philosophical resignation was not, it appeared, shared by her hosts. Elizabeth became uncomfortably aware of a muttered discussion between husband and wife on the path behind her, in which her and Maria’s appearance figured largely. Her exasperation with her cousin increased. This whole farrago was entirely down to his lack of forethought. Let him take the consequences, if only, that was, he did not then take out his frustrations on Charlotte. A flicker of recollection stirred. It had been an article of faith for longer than she could remember that in disputes between her parents Papa must be in the right. It might be an effect of the distance, or of similarities in pitch and tone, but for the first time it struck her that Papa arguing with Mama and his cousin chiding Charlotte sounded more similar than it was comfortable to contemplate.
Despite these precautions, they encountered no trouble on the road. Indeed, there was less traffic than Elizabeth had expected, even in Gondal Town itself. Those people whom they saw kept their heads down and walked with hurried, unswerving steps. Even when a young blade in a gig careered down the street, splashing everyone he passed, people did little more than glare.
“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.”
Satisfied all was under control, the Countess picked up her skirts and scurried in the direction of Lady Linton’s room.
put him quite beyond the pale. Thank goodness for Colonel Fitzwilliam’s indiscretion and Wickham’s confidences; they had protected her from any temptation she might otherwise have felt to accept him, despite her inherent dislike.
– had been the Earl’s sister, and the Countess had, smilingly, referenced “his Grace, my brother” in their conversation. And she, scrupulous not to encroach upon a family’s still-fresh grief, had taken that assertion at face value. What an idiot she had been. Vultures and shrikes the lot of them, and her beloved their prey.
He scowled. “I propose to let Pemberley to Charles Bingley, not to his sister. I have every hope that Charles Bingley – if it has not occurred already – will shortly be affianced to a lady who, if she is not the first choice I would have as the mistress of Pemberley, is nevertheless the closest possible substitute.”
The next meeting at Rosing following their departure produced the intelligence that Mr Darcy and his cousin, a Colonel Fitzwilliam, were due to arrive on their annual visit: an event in which their aunt took quite as much pride as if she had personally endowed Mr Darcy with his estate and fortune and promoted his cousin to his present rank herself. She seemed almost angry that Charlotte and Elizabeth had seen Mr Darcy frequently at Meryton and that Elizabeth had spent a week under the same roof.
With a jingling of harness and a blowing out of breath, the horses came to a halt. They felt the lurch of the carriage as the coachman jumped down, the creak and clank of iron gates opening and then the carriage turned sharp right, down an avenue overshadowed by umbrella pines and cypresses like black flames. Elizabeth leant out of the carriage window, inhaling great gulps of resinous, salt-tanged air.
She looked up at the full canopy of leaves above her, and across at the grass on the meadow, already the parched tawny of high summer. Six to eight weeks to see the harvest in and the store-rooms filled. So it was siege warfare he contemplated and on the soil of Gaaldine, not that of Gondal. James Moriarty was to be enticed to invade and, once there –
“It’ll have to,” McAllister commented grimly. “I can’t see many merchants sending their goods up and down the Great North Road once the news we’ve bagged a Bishop reaches Gondal Town.”
The game, once begun, continues all summer, extending to depictions of flowers sent in embroidery from Georgiana, and watercolours from Julian. It continues even through the difficult period of Papa’s illness, though the flower hues become more sombre as do the sentiments they convey. The language ends up having a repertoire of over a hundred symbols, noted by Georgiana in a little pocket-book with a lock. But then Julian is sent abroad to cultivate his mind and polish his languages and after that he is entered at the University in Zalona. By the time he returns to Pemberley the Princess’ party has been attacked in the high passes of the Skogull Ranges and Georgiana has no heart left for games and ciphers.
She gulped, but that news, also, had already reached her, and from a source no-one could accuse of gossip.
“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.”
Given the dearth of other possibilities, it was a mystery why Netherfield Park should have stood untenanted so long.
He halted a polite two swords-lengths away from the lady in the chair, bowed low, settled into an easy parade rest and prayed to all the saints neither she nor the bravo could
Frances could have said many things. But her life so far had been a narrow thing, like that of a bird’s in a cage, until her uncle had taken them on this grand journey and there died. Her mind had been expanded further since then than she could possibly have imagined.
But John, irony of ironies, had leapt to the obvious conclusion; that she had offered her honour to the King and failed to keep him longer than the night itself. A wanton, and, worse, a failed wanton. Not a conclusion he ever uttered, being a gentleman. Being a gentleman, he merely looked it, instead. Who can refute an unspoken accusation?
Charles felt his jaw gape open. His friend paid him no attention. He made a flat, final gesture with the edge of his right hand.
“It seemed unlikely, I agree. Especially given all that has been afoot. But people change, over time – Harriet, before we talk about my nieces, can I ask you one question and can you answer it in perfect frankness, as if we were girls once more?”
If the journey in company with Sir William and Maria Lucas had been tedious, this was insupportable. The leather of the coach interior was worn, peeling, and odiferous. As the day warmed up, the heat of the black cloak became insupportable but Elizabeth dared not throw it off. The lawyer read on and on, the old woman snored, the scenery jolted past, flat and monotonous and Elizabeth, long before they came in sight of the outskirts of Gondal Town, was heartily repenting her rash impulse. What, after all, could she, a girl, do where her father and uncle had failed? Even if she found Lydia, when had her youngest sister ever listened to her? What – oh, God, what was she even going to say to Mr Wickham, if she confronted him?
“Indeed not.” His face changed, becoming more serious. “Though perhaps it is unkind of me to laugh about it. In accepting my cousin as an adoptive daughter, my aunt took on the most complete disarrangements of her habits, and one with lasting consequences.”
to talk about what undignified asses you and Kitty were making of yourselves with the junior officers. That is, Mr Darcy tried not to talk about it and I was forced to be humiliatingly grateful for his forbearance.”
Next morning saw her changing into her finest morning dress, a procedure which was complicated by her cousin’s insistent urgings from the landing that she hurry herself, lest she make the party late, and that she omit not an iota of care in her preparation, lest the lack of attention to appearance be interpreted as a slur on the royal guest at Rosings. After one final struggle to dissuade Mr Collins from having the gardener’s boy accompany them in the character of a page, she and Charlotte were permitted to set off across Rosings Park, now adorned in all the finery which spring could lend it.
“Any particular house?” The other woman’s effort to sound nonchalant was a lamentable failure. Harriet leant across the rough boards of the wineshop table, scarcely noting that her sleeve dipped into a spilled puddle of Angrian red from the shared flask.
Charles felt his face flame red-hot. How typical of Caroline. How damnably typical. She had been hotter for Netherfield even than himself; its archaic furniture more than compensated for by its easy distance from the capital and the well-kept expanses of its pleasure grounds. She had, too, been badgering him to get something settled now, during the dead days of deep mourning for the King. She was bored; one could not organise parties of pleasure in the capital with mourning banners still hanging from every public building and the funeral not two weeks past. Opening up their own country house, albeit one simply on lease, would give her pastime as well as consequence.
Charlotte cast her eyes down at the grassy path. “Lizzie, promise never to breathe a word of this? At home, I mean. Either of our homes.”
Mary declared herself to have the headache and retired early, but Lydia and Kitty, boisterous and over-excited, took advantage of the occasion in full measure. Harriet, in two minds whether to be more irritated by Miss Bingley’s undisguised eye-rolling and knowing smiles at Mr Darcy or by the antics which had provoked them, retreated into aimless chatter: the surest defence against saying something she might later regret.
Peter made some sort of response, though he hardly knew what. Internally, his thoughts could be summarised thus:
That bit hard, and the pain did not ease. She spent the night tossing in her lumpy bed, sleep far away. Open or shut, whichever way she turned Mr Darcy’s face was before her eyes. A man who had once thought the niece of a country attorney and the daughter of a gentleman of modest estate beneath his dignity would never ally himself to the sister of a woman who had played the wanton with a soldier: a soldier, too, with whom he had the best cause for ancient enmity. All her hopes were sunk and Lydia’s folly had weighted their sinking.
“David.” Molly’s voice was flat and final. “He, like Tybalt, is dead. But you are wrong, sir. Loyalty does not end with death.”
He took it, broke the seal (that, too, was his cousin’s personal device) and read it through once, then again, striving to keep his face impassive. Of course, the footman would have been told to remark his demeanour and describe it.
Somewhere over to Julian’s right an owl called: a single sharp, sweet, note, repeated endlessly. His father had hated that call, he recalled with a sharp stab of unexpected pain.
Mr Collins positively glowed. “Indeed, my dear cousin. Invited to drink coffee at Rosings with the sister to the King himself. I can see how you must be overcome by the honour.” He turned to his wife. “Indeed, this is a compliment to you also, my dear. Lady Catherine has always had the nicest judgment of propriety. Many times, she tells me, she has declined to have a young lady introduced to her niece, because of some scruple as to the character of the young lady’s chaperone.”
“Sir! Here!” The shout sent game birds rocketing out of the undergrowth. Darcy’s head went up. He could see the soldier in the far distance, his arms windmilling frantically. He broke into a run, cursing the small trees which caught at his garments.
“In this murk, how will we ever find the ship?” Georgiana murmured to her companion. Mrs Annesley gripped her arm reassuringly.
She could not think his exactness of memory a mere fluke. But now another miracle was occurring: shyly, and with many promptings from her brother. Miss Darcy was asking her aunt if they might have the honour of meeting their party for dinner during their stay in this part of Gondal. She permitted herself the smallest nod of acquiescence at her aunt’s sidelong, unspoken enquiry, and the day after next was fixed upon. To cap the day’s wonders, Mr Darcy made a particular request that her uncle join him and the gentlemen of the party on the morrow, since a fishing party was in contemplation, and he understood Mr Gardiner to be partial to the sport?
“Cousin, Uncle, are you not both forgetting something? At this precise moment, I am the richest person in this room.” She favoured them both with a small, tight smile. “To be strictly accurate, my brother excepted, I am the richest person in this
The little priest looked solemn. “By a wise man, it seems. The Betrothal Parure – the necklace from which is on the road to Gondal Town at this very moment, and the ear-bobs from which were given to Miss Hooper by her guardian on her twenty-first birthday – comprises the finest diamonds the late Prince Gerald could procure. As with all such devilish baits, a tale of blood and crime is attached to every single one of the principal stones.”
“Quite the reverse, my dear, at least according to her attendants. She has gone off on a spring pilgrimage under the care of a widowed gentlewoman of unimpeachable reputation.”
Then the news came of the vanishing of Georgiana Darcy into thin air and half a troop of soldiers with her and the King was no longer interested in anything Giulio had to say to him.
Horrible visions of Georgiana fleeing to the Gaaldine border in the company of some apothecary or attorney, a desperate nose ahead of a forced marriage to one of the dissolute blades of the Prince’s set, shivered in front of Colonel Fitzwilliam’s eyes.
"The very thing! I have been wishing so hard for Jane to have a little distraction. Here, all our walks remind us of Bingley, and Mama –”
“I think your porter’s still arguing with them about college privileges at the front gate. Consider that quite a testament to your character. And pay for masses for the repose of his soul, when you are next in a position to command them. Well, man, what are you waiting for? Grab any money you have and wear shoes you can run in. Not boots. They’ll have all the gates covered. It’ll have to be the roofs. The mist hasn’t burnt off yet, thank the saints, so with luck they won’t spot us climbing the drainpipe. People never look up until they’ve looked in every other direction first. That’s because they’re idiots.”
The Governor had been removed from office and remained under house arrest in the capital. Even if his fault had stopped at negligence, Elizabeth assumed such would have been his fate. But had it been negligence alone? Uncle John’s correspondence, frustratingly, dropped hints but did not carry them through. Could there have been treachery? If so, who else might be implicated?
He nodded. “Indeed. We had planned to stay by the lake another ten days at least, but my cousin has been ordered south to rejoin his regiment unexpectedly and my uncle had not the heart to continue the party. To help him, I offered the hospitality of Pemberley for some part of his guests, and thought it as well to post on ahead, to ensure all would be in order for them.”
of adequate size, soldier, otherwise they would have successfully escorted Georgiana to her destination, rather than apparently vanishing into thin air.”
“I hope, Miss Elizabeth, that the strength of feeling I have detailed: a strength of feeling which has overcome such earnest striving for so many weeks and months on my part to conquer it, will induce you to take pity on me, and say those words which must make me the happiest of men.”
Those word rang in Elizabeth’s head throughout the day. In the end, they decided her. Making an excuse to leave their labours in the still-room, where the work of bottling and drying the bounty of high summer had to continue, no matter how many sisters might be astray in the world, she made her way indoors. Taking care no-one observed her, she crept indoors, changed into one of the plain, serviceable travelling gowns which had done such signal duty over the dusty roads of Northern Gondal and then packed, quickly, a travelling bundle. How fortunate she still had monies saved from her trip with the Gardiners: she had been planning to buy a remembrance of the trip but not found anything suitable before it had been cut short. Now, of course, the holiday had turned into something at once both impossible to forget and from which her memory flinched. No matter. The purse would pay her travelling expenses, at least. After a little thought, she also tucked her small reserves of jewellery into the sewn-in pocket of her stays, thrust the travel bag into one of the large covered baskets the Longbourn family used when taking charity to the cottagers of Meryton and district and stole out down the back stairs.
Damask roses. Yarrow. Basil. Deadly nightshade. A civil hint as to the direction of his walk this evening. Julian could, indeed, hardly have contrived this meeting without the help of Mrs Reynolds. In which case –
Elizabeth turned her head, to catch an expression of such exquisite relief on Charlotte’s face that her initial disappointment was swallowed up in guilt.
“What rank awaits Miss Hooper’s intended husband, do you suppose? No mere barony, surely. To conquer Mr Darcy’s pride surely only a marquisate or a dukedom would suffice. But can we imagine Miss Hooper as a duchess, or even a marchioness?”
“That being?” Charles was not sure he wanted to know. The bleakness in Darcy’s voice could have scoured the fertile wheat-plains of Grunador to bare, barren rock.
“So, Miss Duplessis, another splendid day, is it not? At times like this, one can see why they call this region ‘the garden of Gondal’.”
In the end, it took three wagons to bring the wreckage of the Darcy state coach back to Pemberley. The pieces were carried from the wagons by straining, gasping and, occasionally, blasphemous soldiers and deposited carefully inside the nearest barn to be examined at leisure.
It was like being in Papa’s study; Elizabeth felt that same sense of being set a puzzle to work out, with the fear of disappointing her hearer ever present. That last conversation with Colonel Fitzwilliam, mingled with recollections of Meryton dinner-tables with the officers present, floated into her mind.
Despite himself, Darcy found his eyes drawn to the portrait, to meet the melancholy eyes of his Aunt Elaine, Molly’s mother as well as the King’s.
The Bishop’s cherubic features creased into well-worn lines which, nevertheless, Julian did not remember. How could the Bishop have aged so much since he had visited Malham Castle to say a requiem for King Ambrosine and stay to a funeral dinner in the Great Hall?
All that occupied his mind was Georgiana: Georgiana taken by bandits in the wilderness. Into some dark, forgotten chamber of his mind the faint, dim recollection of a chapel intruded. Had he had leisure to think; had it not been Georgiana’s life and honour at stake, he could have managed better. He should have sent some sort of apologies, explanations: the very things at which he was so incompetent.
“Boy – can you even raise the ransom from your own resources? Or even half such a sum? A quarter of a million thaler: that is a fearsome amount. Georgiana’s dowry is only fifty thousand and the Pemberley estate is entailed. You can mortgage to the maximum, but you cannot sell. Can you raise the wind? Yes or no?”
to do in a country district. Nothing by way of entertainment rather than drudgery, at least, and of drudgery she was full to surfeit.)
Georgiana’s brow creases prettily. “I have one. Basil. Basileos, the king of herbs. So, in a composition, that would mean the King – or, I suppose, the Sultan, in Constantinople.”
For the next four days they saw nothing of the Rosings party, though Mr Collins, from his position in the front garden, overlooking the road, was able to report in minute detail the arrival of the gentlemen on horseback, their luggage trundling behind them in a coach. Sunday came, and with it church. The Rosings party were, as a matter of course, arrayed in state in the pew of honour.
One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane, he and the ladies of the house were sitting together in the front parlour when the party heard a coach and four approaching. Kitty ran to the window, and reported that neither coach, horses nor livery corresponded to those of any neighbours. It was, in any event, far too early for visitors.
“You are the Crown Prince of Gaaldine? So by my being here with you, whatever lies the King has told about my family, whatever accusations of treason he has levied against our name, are now rendered truth.”
Lady Agnes spread her hands in a gesture of bafflement. “What else? Lady Abruzzi, though she was losing, protested. She would clearly have liked to continue. But your– but Miss Hooper held firm and when her carriage arrived she walked out with her evening’s winnings. Lady Abruzzi stayed on, though.”
Five years ago. Pemberley’s grandest drawing room. Summer and the scent of roses drifting through the doors which opened onto the terrace.
“Anyway, some months ago, spies out of the Debatable Lands brought word that riding families long estranged had shorted their differences, and hatched a plan for a major raid come Pentecost. Early reports the raiders looked towards Gaaldine proved a feint. The raiders doubled back into Lestrade lands, burning and pillaging as they went. So out came his lordship from Castle Lestrade with what few men he could summon at short notice.”
The young man backed further into the cave’s shadows, uttering whimpers that would have shamed Julian’s best spaniel bitch (who had her now, back at Castle Malham, was she being cared for properly, did she still miss him and look for his return?)
Charlotte could not quite conceal a smile. “In any event, as we walked home across the park I ventured to observe to William the curious circumstance that I and Miss Hooper must have been neighbours, years ago, when we were both children. But he seemed so offended at the very thought – certain that I must be mistaken, that I must have confused some other Miss Hooper with Lady Catherine’s royal ward, persuaded that breathing any hint of my surmise in the hearing of his patron would be the ruin of us both – that I have not mentioned it since and William, I am sure, has forgotten all about it. But Lady Catherine has always made it clear I should not expect to be honoured with an introduction to her niece, when she visits her guardian. This invitation must have come from Miss Hooper herself and why would she have cause to know anything of either of us if she were
She rose from her bed scarcely later than dawn, exhausted but unresting, and so became the first member of the family to see the messenger ride in, bearing a letter in Uncle Gardiner’s familiar hand. It was addressed to Jane and Elizabeth jointly, and she paused for a moment, unwilling to open it without her sister present. But Jane had slept in for the first time in days, and Elizabeth thought that whether the letter brought joy or despair, Jane could face either better if rested. She broke the seal.
my niece’s matter. Go back to your own house, boy, and await my message. Oh, drop that flapping, Paterson. It’s not his uniform the King’s going to be interested in. Order my carriage brought round. And send a footman ahead. We must wait upon his Grace at the earliest possible opportunity.”
What an utter bitch Elizabeth was. Thank God he had never been serious about his hints of marriage to her.
“As you see.” Perhaps thinking that overly brusque, Darcy added, “His Grace visited Pemberley often in my father’s day, and always took pleasure in the place. When the time comes, I can mourn him better here than elsewhere.”
She raised her brows with an archness which, he suspected, she had learnt in the course of this last Season.
“Did your fishmonger friend have news of who has been frequenting Lady Catherine’s house?” Frances enquired, with a casualness she did not feel.
“Not in the general way, but the freight that has just left Rosings is enough to attract the gentry of crime from across the whole of Europe. They are taking a famous necklace, one of the three elements of the Betrothal Parure, up to Gondal Town so Miss Hooper may wear her mother’s jewels at the State Ball. It will go under armed guard from here direct to the strongroom below the Earl of Ula’s mansion so no thief, however bold, can possibly attempt it.”
"May I? Well, Miss Georgiana, this is a horrid tale, I warn you, so be sure to let me know if you wish me to leave off, but it fell about like this. In Italy, they say, a young man named Lorenzo, of a respectable, mercantile family, formed the most intense affection for a lady, Lisabetta, the only daughter of an Florentine noble of the most rigidly exclusive type. He would hardly have deigned to betroth Lisabetta to a Viscount; to one of the merchant class, impossible! But love contrives a way over the highest obstacles –”
“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.”
“Ah. The tedium of the importunate.” The King had not missed his reaction. “Tell me, coz, have you not found there is a type of person who, by all reason, should be overflowing with gratitude for the opportunities one has afforded to him, but who takes the smallest indulgence on one’s part as simply the excuse for endless further demands on one’s generosity?”
“Is it news any family would share? Not just Glenelden’s life but the Earl’s entire credit hung in the balance. From what I have been able to make out, letters were found in Glenelden’s chambers, suggesting a treasonous correspondence with Angria.”
“There are dry and heavy subjects his Grace and I must discuss. You two; entertain his young Lordship and hear all he has to impart concerning the Golden Horn.”
The King announced a water pic-nic in his sister’s honour, and various sycophants-about-Court rushed to compose (or, in some cases, blatantly plagiarise) reams of verses comparing Molly to, variously, naiads; mermaids; sirens; Thetis; Aphrodite of the sea-foam and, in at least one case, a rusalka.
“Lieutenant Brenzaida? I trust I find you in health – at least, so far as your recent privations permit?”
Elizabeth shuddered. Many were the tales of those who had entered the dungeons beneath the Catiff’s Tower over the long centuries since its building. Those taken might never appear again or emerge years later, broken beyond all mending.
“Tell her. Mama, tell Mrs Foster that it simply isn’t fair to take Lydia with her to Lake Elderno, and leave me behind.”
No, Elizabeth admonished herself with angry pride. Almost as if he would have liked to declare himself, had he had a competence of 600 thalers per annum and the legal connection such security would have allowed him to build up. Mr Darcy had rendered that impossible. As, of course, did her own lack of dowry. In this matter, there were faults on both sides.
if we are out much longer and I still have letters to write, taking my leave of our friends in the district.”
“Our one consolation for these troubled times is how many visitors from Gondal Town have chosen to linger in this part of the world this summer. In previous years, travellers have bypassed the district, to press straight on towards the Lakes, which are far more celebrated. Which is a very great pity, I believe.”
Her voice betrayed her on the last few words, for surely if William or Lady Catherine took an alarm of bandits even this last shred of freedom would be stripped from her.
Confronted with concrete questions, the officer stumbled through a moderately coherent account. A troop of twenty men, one sergeant, one corporal and a farrier. None of them heard from this last se’nnight. The messengers sent to Pemberley reporting that (save for a handful of deserters) the party had departed in good order accompanying Miss Darcy and her chaperone. Less than a day later, horses, carriage, passengers, troopers and all had vanished into the upland mists.
For a moment she paused. Out of the corner of her eye she caught sight of the ponderous form of her cousin Collins making his determined way in her direction. It decided her. She dropped a quick, assenting curtsey.
“Preposterous!” In this, at least, the guard commander could achieve sincerity. “What assurance do we have that he will honour his word?”
The bodies of the seven armsmen and two attendant ladies who had perished in the attack on the Princess’s wedding party had been brought home and solemnly interred in the Cathedral of SS Geraldine and Augusta. After the ceremony, Colonel Fitzwilliam had heard a first-hand account of the action from one of the survivors. The thought of plump, puppyish Lady Agnes caught up in that bloody horror made him want to retch.
Baulked of this comfort, she returned to Uncle John’s letter, only to find it a disappointment. With the passes opening both to Gondal and to Angria, and the rumours of war louder than ever, it stood to reason that the Princess’s advisor would be on his travels once more. He hinted that they might be taking a further diplomatic tour of the southern provinces of Gaaldine and that in consequence he feared he might be unable to write for some time.
Frances brushed her hand down her face. The gesture opened the sluice gates; she could talk at last.
She rose to her feet, keeping steady with difficulty. “I collect, Mama, that you said that the evening service in the Cathedral had the finest choir in all Gondal, and that it would be a shame for me not to hear it while I am in town? I daresay we will be returning soon to Longbourn so this may be the last opportunity I have. And I beg you, Mama, do not waste time wondering about whether or not I would accept Mr Darcy’s offer. No such offer will ever be made. I am persuaded that the King himself would be a more likely suitor for my affections.”
The corporal shook his head. “Have you eaten the food of the Borders? There’s a dish there they make from a sheep’s pluck, stuffed with oatmeal mixed with chopped offal – liver and lights and so forth – and heavily peppered.”
The way Giulio’s hand caressed the top of his poniard spoke volumes, but he obeyed. Jonathan watched with careful friendliness until he was on the other side of a closed door. The lady’s face changed the moment her servant was no longer there. Jonathan recognised her expression; he had seen its like plenty of times in green soldiers nerving themselves for a skirmish.
Elizabeth half-wondered whether the emphasis he placed upon “entertainments” was born out of astonishment that the word might ever take a respectable position in a sentence which also included “Rosings.”
"Georgiana Darcy has protection neither you nor – I strongly suspect – your brother imagines. As for yourself –”
“Not a suspicion of it, sir. The ladies behaved with great grace –Miss Darcy took pains to promise ransoms for all when we surrendered – and, to my mind, the Duke’s men would have been ashamed to show themselves lesser in the face of such dignity. And the Duke sent two women servants to attend them wherever he was taking them.”
Charles’s heart almost stopped. Darcy, so rich, so well-connected: of course he would entrance any angel on whom he chose to look.
“Can we stop pretending, ma’am? No – I’ll grant you don’t know who our high-placed traitor is, but you’ve given me first-class intelligence regarding them, nonetheless. And you must know, I’ll see it to the right home to follow up on it.”
Lizzie would win, no doubt; she had inherited her facility with words from her father, as well as her dark good looks. Lizzie, at least, could be trusted to lend the earrings to Jane, whom they suited so well, whenever it was most necessary for Jane to make an impression. Were she to make a present of them to her eldest, Kitty or Lydia would constantly demand them and Jane would yield every time and never get a chance to wear them herself.
“There is Mr Darcy in the wilderness outside.” Caroline fumbled with the window catch, and succeeded in pushing the casement a creaking few inches open. “Mr Darcy! Mr Darcy!”
“It is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Many months ago Mr Wickham revealed the kind of man you are. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you defend yourself on that point?”
“How did he show his bitterness?” Charles asked, when the silence into which Darcy had fallen threatened to engulf them both.
Harriet nodded. “If the King does set traps for us, there will be those in the district watching to see them sprung. Not a word, even to Lydia. I shall give it out that Lizzie extends her stay with Charlotte and no-one will trouble themselves to enquire further.”
“We’ll take you there. I am Georgiana’s brother. No, don’t waste your strength. Trust us: you are with friends now. Sergeant! Give me your six strongest men. The rest of you keep searching for the remains of the coach. As for me, I shall return to Pemberley.”
Fuming, he returned home to find a strange footman in the hall. Darcy recognised the livery at once: Moriarty family colours. He also took the point the livery was intended to send. James of Gondal was not approaching Fitzwilliam Darcy as his King and liege lord, but as a relative. The dissemblance made him queasy, a sensation which only increased when, ceremoniously, the footman handed him a note bearing his own name written in his cousin’s crabbed, unmistakeable hand.
the whole approach had been: he could have sworn he had been told in terms to seduce the Princess but now he looked back her name had never been mentioned from beginning to end.)
Charges hidden in the mouth of the gorge exploded. The night broke apart in fire and storm. All the horses tried to bolt at once. One wagon toppled on its side. A horse’s scream, like a soul in torment, rent the night. The horses freed by the poachers broke free, and stampeded into the dark.
“He wants a quarter of a million thalers, paid to him in bearer draughts drawn upon a number of specific banking houses. The provisions for handover, I confide, are proof against various forms of treachery we might attempt. Especially since Georgiana remains in his custody until the ransom is paid.”
Since Lieutenant Peter Brenzaida had, if anything, an even lower estimation of his own powers than the c/o’s, he could only share that regret. More especially, since the maximum strength the c/o could allow him was less than a third of a company: twenty privates of dragoons, one sergeant, one corporal and a farrier.
Mama sniffed. “Why you should waste your consideration on such a heedless, ungrateful girl is beyond me. But of course she may accompany you if you wish to take her. She is so headstrong that I don’t doubt that even if I were to say no, she would ignore me completely and go with you come what may. So have her and good riddance. But now, will you come inside? I am sure you must be frozen, and if you are both driven into your beds with fever and chills, who but me will be put to running up and down stairs at all hours with compresses and febrifuges? Also, Mr Wickham and Colonel Forster have arrived to pay a call. Colonel Forster is to be wed within six weeks and has come to invite us to the ball which the regiment throws to welcome his bride. Oh, why does everyone conspire to thrust their wedding plans into my face?”
“Charlotte,” Charlotte corrected, her backbone freezing at her own audacity. How wonderful that William was not here!
Papa said, in one of those precious, disjointed moments in the library. But when Elizabeth pressed him to define his terms, he would not, turning towards the window and looking out into the garden, where the blossom under the influence of a sharp south-easterly wind was counterfeiting the snows of last month’s north-westerlies.
Very, very gently (she was reminded, fleetingly, of a memory from childhood: the town blacksmith cradling a half-drowned duckling between huge hands and allowing it space near the heat of the furnace) the giant’s hands cupped both of hers.
And also Mama’s boasts to Lady Lucas about ‘Dear Mr Bingley, what a pleasure it will be to welcome him as a son.’ Holy Mother, did my entire family have a sweepstake on how badly each of them could behave last night? What must the district have thought of us?”
That day dawned bright and clear. Elizabeth looked forward to a walk through the woods which they had admired yesterday, before returning to the inn to dress for a late dinner at Pemberley. However, while she and her aunt and uncle were still at breakfast, a messenger arrived bearing two letters from her sister, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably sloppily.
do you see why Georgiana’s marriage is much on my mind? I would see her safely wed to a man of her own choosing before Prince James seeks to engage her in his stratagems.”
Lydia tossed her head; the firelight caught and flung back red-gold sparks from her soft brown curls. A sure way to captivate men, that. In Harriet’s younger days, she too had cultivated a repertoire of head-tosses and hair flicks, practising for hours in front of the mirror. If Jane failed to make an advantageous marriage, then Lydia would and save them all. Not too soon to think of it, either; Lydia would be fourteen next month. Following the Princess’s example, marrying young was all the rage. After all, what was there to wait for? The whole business was a game of chance. One might be as easily deceived in one’s husband at forty (look at Miss Bates and her so-called merchant sea-captain!) as at fourteen.
Lady Abruzzi was escorted to her carriage by a cheering company of the victors, all of them wearing the scarlet silk sashes with which she had presented them. The carriage vanished down the road in a cloud of dust. With a roar, all three regiments rushed towards the cooking pits, where two oxen plus assorted sheep, pigs and fowl had been roasting since the earlier part of the day. The hogsheads of wine and barrels of beer brought in by carters at Lady Abruzzi’s orders earlier that day were broached, and Lady Abruzzi was toasted three times and three times three around the campfires.
She gestured, feebly, with the hand holding the paper. “A – a moment. A moment of dizziness. I bent to pick this up, and must have stood up too sharply.”
Would he by any chance be a black-browed sneering bravo with a hell of a lip on him, bearing the scars of what must have been a nasty bout of smallpox, mainly on the left-hand side of his ugly face?”
And then, having collected them, he had taken them to the house with the walnut tree and handed them over and received in return more money than he had ever seen in one place before.
“At the most usurious rate. So. It will not surprise him if I do what he might do in my position. Gondal Town it is. I shall embrace my great fortune and with it buy you time. How long do you need?”
“Why?” Only after the word had been spilt, irrevocably, across this shuttered room did it occur to him that his question was outrageously impertinent.
Trooper Arthur Musgrave had had a bad feeling about this expedition from the outset and Trooper Musgrave’s bad feelings, when he chose to share them with his cronies in the company, were respected. That was what came of having the best part of a quarter of a century of service in Gondal’s army under your belt.
A slow smile broke over the Crown Prince’s face. “A good question. And one, it seems, you and I are the first to ask. Perhaps you owe that to being English.”
"Irrespective of my financial position, I would assuredly challenge such an announcement. I have never, in heart or word –”
Her little finger down, she balled her hand into a fist and brought it down on the table so hard the cups and dishes rattled. “And that is the belief we have to foster. You have to be seen as a man without any lingering shred of reputation, for you to have the smallest chance to redeem your honour.”
Giulio’s knees turned weak. "My lord I – I cannot say. It was a private party, hosted by Lady Agnes Traquair. Who attended, save that the invitees were drawn from the highest ladies of the court, I do not know –”
“I would know that he received seemly burial, and was not left for the carrion birds and beasts. And I would see his death requited. But first, tell me more exactly how he died. Everyone agrees you were there, though their accounts coincide on no other particular.”
“I’d give 500 thalers to be able to say different, my lady, but though I didn’t see either man go off the bridge, I spoke to those as did.”
The final straw came when a letter arrived, addressed to her father. Jane had instructions to open everything which arrived, and Elizabeth, recognising Mr Collins’ crabbed hand on the direction, craned over her sister’s shoulder to read along with her.
There was an odd, calculating look about his face, as if he were mentally sorting out what intelligence was his to share and what needed to be locked tight away, for the good of Gondal.
“Your attentive poets will surely see it as a most particular attention and may take – matters amiss – in consequence.”
Although she could not mention this to her aunt, that reflection was hardly calculated to recommend the scheme. Elizabeth fell silent, then when she retired at night made a few commonplace enquiries of the chambermaid. They had passed the fine Pemberley estate in the travels; from the glimpses she had seen through the trees it seemed a monstrous fine place. Was it true that it was owned by the King’s own cousin? Indeed, and were the family down for the summer?
“I cannot see Miss Hooper, daughter of Sir Vernon Hooper of Netherfield, in the role of procuress Royal,” she hazarded, by way of whistling in the dark.
“For,” he added with a hint of his old confidential air, as they walked in the garden at Longbourn, “I have it on the most excellent authority that his Grace the King intends the forfeit estates of the Duke of Malham to be the dower lands of his sister, Miss Hooper.
“Impossible! Mr Darcy has such influence over his friend he would never allow Mr Bingley to sully himself by venturing into the mercantile quarters of town, even if he knew where to find them.”
“Yes, pray come in. Mrs Reynolds; I trust my escort have been suitably accommodated? They are, I should make clear, not mine to command, though I am tasked with making suggestions as to how they should be deployed, based on the best local knowledge. Ultimately they answer to the King.”
“A carriage accident! Surely there was some grave mismanagement there. I have always advised my nephew never to travel except in the best appointed and maintained carriages and behind the quietest and best schooled horses, and I should expect his friend to do no less.”
Before he had time to do no more than gather his thoughts, a sharp series of raps sounded on the study door. For the first time his interlocutor turned to face him. His whole body held the frozen concentration of a hunting stoat.
“To the coast, of course. Holy Virgin forgive me for breaking my oath, but if you could manage to shift that fetching arse of yours before the ship either rots and breaks up or pisses off back to Venice, we’ll be breathing good Italian air by the time Sunday rolls round.”
“As matters stand, I would not happily see any relative of mine brought so near the King, still less a gentle, sheltered girl such as Jane. Mr Darcy is the King’s own cousin. The wife of Mr Darcy’s closest friend would, of necessity, be brought into the highest of Court circles.”
The Crown Prince blinked, as if for the first time realising that Frances was not some faceless recipient of his confidences (if confidences they were) but a person in her own right.
All Souls Night Ball at the Palace? The night the King had paused on the staircase and beckoned to the Queen’s newest lady-in-waiting with a meaning she could not mistake.
Mentally, she made a note against her next confession. But confidence as to the Elbe visit had been enjoined upon her and promises were also sacred to God. Her voice strengthened.
Mama took the news badly. What was utterly unexpected was how nearly Mama echoed Elizabeth’s thoughts in the garden.
She suffered him to lead her to a seat beneath the umbrella palms lining the harbour, Molly in careful, watchful attendance all the while. She sank, gratefully, into the shade.
His countenance opened into a smile. “I am happy you made her acquaintance. She has always lacked companionship; the companionship of sensible women near her own age, I mean.”
“For the moment.” That half-admission offended his soldier’s soul; he felt the need to amplify. “The Abruzzi affair cut deep. The man was well-liked. I have heard it said he never spent a life needlessly, nor one unmourned.”
From his expression, Harriet had known he was remembering Mama, and the terrible last weeks of her illness.
Molly paused. "My pardons. Charlotte. The morning is cool and early, we are both wakeful when our companion is not –”
“Lady Abruzzi? Arranging memorial games for the late Colonel?” Clarence Duplessis raised a sardonic eyebrow. “Let us hope she is not a student of Diodorus Siculus.”
That was when she had wriggled her small body into cover in the bushes, hoping no-one would find her until the party was over, praying she would not have to see any more of the guests mocking the Lucas family’s pretensions and inadequacies.
The broken-down cottage reputed to house a witch came into sight round the bend of the road. Charlotte expelled a long-pent breath. “Meryton, at last.”
Elizabeth’s knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue her aunt and uncle. She stammered some barely coherent instructions to the servant, he vanished, and her knees gave way. She barely managed to reach a couch before collapsing, unable to support herself.
"Word has it that it was not so much a duel as an assassination. And for the challenger to be preferred to Abruzzi’s command with his body barely cold –”
“Perhaps,” she essayed, “something could be contrived when Lady Catherine goes to Court? Perhaps when Miss Hooper returns to Gondal Town, her aunt will return with her?”
“If it’s Lizzie’s answer you’re worried about, as her Mama I am persuaded that if she really were set against accepting an offer from you, sir, she would have no hesitation in telling me. Or, for that matter, you. She always was a wilful, outspoken, headstrong girl. But I tried to broach the subject, and all I got was that she had no hopes of such an honour, which, as you will appreciate, sir, is as much encouragement as is seemly for any girl of character to give to a gentleman whose proposal is, as yet, hypothetical.”
“Did he not! Why, that was how he said his creel strap come to be worn through. Lady Catherine was entertaining her nephews for weeks together and nothing but the freshest for them, day in, day out. Not the King, of course, but two other nephews. One of them was a colonel in the Army
Charlotte smiled at her. “Lizzie, I have a confession to make. I suspect this invitation stems less from the personal qualities of either of us, than from an accident of geography.”
She smiled, and hoped it did not look like relief. “My aunt Gardiner – really, she is my mother’s cousin, but bears the title ‘aunt’ as a courtesy – sends welcome intelligence as to the latest fashions in the capital, and even more welcome advice as to how the effects may be contrived if one does not have an army of seamstresses at one’s disposal. My father’s sister, Aunt Phillips, we see almost daily, so she does not need to write. Though I do not doubt the tenor of her messages, if she did.”
shall rouse them, lest they think some addle-pated young buck is raising an alarm of fire in the hope of catching them between strand and sea.”
The snort emitted by the Crown Prince at that was so loud, Molly feared it could have been heard in the house.
The death of the elder Mr Darcy allowed the two young men to avoid even the appearance of acquaintance, save only for matters of business.
“No, ma’am. I believe they will still be at Lake Elderno.” The chambermaid shuffled from one foot to another; her next words came out in a rush. “They say that the Earl of Ula (he is Mr Darcy’s uncle, you understand) has made a great party down there, with balls and pic-nics and water-parties. His son commands a regiment and with all this war talk who knows where the Colonel may be by this time next month, or his men with him? Small wonder, ma’am, if his father makes the most of what little peace may be left to enjoy his son’s company, and his family comes to join them.”
She went, for a moment, very still. “Are you accusing Miss Elizabeth Duplessis of being herself a spy?”
“Paid! We – the troopers of the Crown – we haven’t been paid in months, and we’ll not see the thalers owed us for as long as Traquair squats in the War Office, spending
“No, I did not say that. But I am a little acquainted with her brother, Mr Darcy. We dined with his aunt when he came to Rosings with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, but before that I saw him at Meryton, my home town, when he was visiting his friend Mr Bingley. But he always spoke so warmly of his sister – tell me, please, no harm has come to her?”
He did not sound as happy about this as Elizabeth might have expected. Perhaps he had hoped for professional advancement from the rumoured campaign against Gaaldine.
"What can you get us? As you can see, my brother is injured. If you could dispatch a man to raise a physician –” the woman in the absurdly fashionable hoop skirts pleaded.
“In any event,” he continued rather later, “its ugliness shouldn’t have come as a surprise to you. Hadn’t you seen Crown Prince Gerald’s betrothal parure before?”
“Oh, so your Meryton diversion took in Longbourn as well? I trust you made my duty to Mrs Duplessis and to her daughters?”
She knew what she was seeing. And before she had been the wife of Clarence Duplessis, of Longbourn; before, even, she had been the maid of honour to the Queen, she had been the child of Hamish Watson, physician to the Court.
“No. I believe she may have had some such intention, but a man came, I believe bearing a warning for her to walk warily. She burnt papers in the bread oven, the day after.”
“Well, we cannot stay here to discuss them.” The Crown Prince had his head cocked on one side. “Provided I hear no word of refusal from Miss Duplessis we will see you at your lodgings at ten of the clock tomorrow. I shall bring the priest. In the meantime, we all have our duties to attend to; most importantly you, Darcy. We can’t have that rogue Wickham wriggling out of his obligations at the last minute.”
What she might have said to that was forever lost. From outside there came the sound of jangling harness and the shouts and laughter of men. Abruptly a giant of a man ducked into the church. Despite his surroundings and the presence of the priest, the new arrival seemed to be bubbling over with suppressed mirth.
"Your kidnapping me would precipitate war. War on my brother’s timetable, not yours. Whereas if I were in Gondal Town –”
Encouraged, doubtless, by the gold thaler Frances pressed into her hand, the chambermaid departed, wreathed in smiles. Nonetheless, she lay still on the bed, cucumber slices in place, for a good half turn before she could be sure the maid would not return.
The jewellers in question were precisely the kind of long-established, exclusive establishment to whom the adopted daughter of Lady Catherine de Bourgh might be expected to entrust her jewellery. Since such an establishment shunned the very idea of promoting their services, the fact they had a small team of skilled craftsmen who could, in a surprisingly short time, replicate most items of jewellery in paste with phenomenal fidelity to the original was information known to a select few. There were numerous reasons why such a service might be called upon, but since most were discreditable to the owners, absolute secrecy was the norm.
But at this last, even the busy tongue of gossip stilled, and the ladies looked sideways at each other, shrugged, and gave a little laugh at the absurdity into which speculation had led them. For, whatever rumour whispered, how could there really be anything amiss with Molly Hooper, first lady of Gondal, when it was patently obvious that her brother the King was in the best of spirits and that his temper only improved as the hour of the Ball advanced upon them all?
“We are quite alone here. And that is a thick door. So are the walls. Screams would not penetrate those barriers.”
“But with this news from Gaaldine – the Crown Prince estranged from his brother – surely the threat to Gondal is much lessened?”
Her own age. It shocked her to think that Colonel Fitzwilliam might think of her as a mere girl, though of course Mama always said that men were allowed to grow up more slowly than women, so it was safer always to think of oneself as the elder, when dealing with a male contemporary.
She blinked that thought away, and rose to her feet. “I should be about my packing. I need to be well on with it when my brother’s honour guard arrives.”
I admit. Yes, in a moment of madness, in an effort to preserve my credit in your eyes, brother, rather than turning to my man of business to extend funds to cover my losses, I had my personal man pawn a few of my personal adornments. I admit all that. But not
“It felt like dancing,” Elizabeth said, shortly. Lydia’s transports, after a night which had promised so much and in the end delivered very little, that little tainted, were altogether too much, especially to irritable spirits and a sluggish head.
The weather did nothing to cheer her depressed spirits. She tried not to think of the palms over Elbe waterfront. She tried not to contrast the city’s ordure, running in brown streams down the cobbles, with the sun-warmed sand along which she had walked only two days ago.
