“Yeah, sure. I
It was over in just a moment. Ketch slumped over, breathing heavily.
“What?” Sam looked again to the weight he had been levitating. “What else would I do? I’ve got telekinesis.”
The footsteps halted.
Sam's eyes searched between hers, looking for a crack in her defiant demeanor.
And then piled on
My Brother is coming, and with
"You don't?"
Cas: Sorry. We have a demon captive and it needed to be restrained. >:(  Have you heard of selkies? We found a colony.
“No problem,” Sam said, and gestured to Bris and Cas.
Cas ruminated on that. “It will be difficult, but yes, I’ll try.”

particular time. If he wanted, he could trace his mistakes back millennia, but that had been yesterday’s exercise. Today was for his recent ones.
“...all I have is this. The last of my brothers and sisters and the demons still loyal to me in Hell.” He snapped again, and the crowd vanished.
“More. These urges— I want to… I want to do nice things for them. Favors, and gifts. And I know they would enjoy them, but I… I get nervous. I get too nervous, and sometimes I can’t go through with it at all.”
The next piece will be a ficlet discussing what was up with Gabriel while he was missing and will contain answers for how the heck Sam got back to the fight. Then after that will be Part Six, the conclusion to this plot arc.
He was a strategian, a warrior, not an artist or a poet. As he sat on his own, trying to figure out exactly what he would say to Dean, he found himself coming up at a loss. He wished he could just say it, just tell Dean straightforward and blatantly, but that never happened to good effect in his research. One or both parties always ended up terribly embarrassed, or sometimes scared to the point of running away, prolonging everyone’s suffering. So as much as Cas wanted to make things simple, he knew that he couldn’t. This was something he needed to put thought into, something he had to get just right…
He didn't hear the other set of footsteps retreating sharply in the opposite direction.
He was cut off by a hard bite at his shoulder and his own drawn-out groan. “Oh, don’t you worry, baby," Steve murmured, "I’m gonna take good care of you.”
Sam stared at his brother, and shared a look with Direl.
Michael seemed to take careful stock of Gabriel. “Then why are you

he boomed, “Everyone out! Guard, behind!”
Still, though, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. No spell-circles in the sand, no tracks, no sulfur, no EMF.
I don't want yer pity,” Bris was pulling herself back. “We got out. I'm out. I'm free again.” She spread her arms and took a deep breath. “It's not the same as the ocean, but it's
Cas: I don't think it's the distance. It seemed different. Sadder.
Ketch raised an eyebrow at Dean. “What exactly are you worried about?”
Castiel was trembling, but it wasn't over yet. With that glow holding steady in his eyes, he turned his arm and he began to pull back. Sam slowly fell back to the bed, his face still pained, but his body settling.
“Well I certainly don’t know what you lot say about us behind our backs." She tilted her head, and her own gaze might have dropped to his lips. "So I s'pose you’re just gonna hafta ask.”
"Yeah, Chicago," Sam turned a tight-lipped frown on him. "You know, since the ID's are ready. I, ah— I brought them with. Thought the selkies might like to have them sooner than later. You know... as long as we're passing through."
The harshness bled from Castiel's stance, his eyes drooping sad and pained. He shook his head slightly, “Was there no other way?”
~*~*~*~*~
“Haven’t seen her in a while. Sorry.”
Bris stepped into the shower room in the bunker, setting her change of clothes aside as she ran the water to heat up.
freaked out to go over there. I mean it, it’s okay, you can stay here.”
Dean yanked his arm out of his grasp, “Fuck off, Sam.”
With that she spun on her heel and left the kitchen.
But when he reached their door, he paused.
Crowley took a short breath.
Dean smiled, a sharp contrast from only a moment before.
Now Sam was alone, going over their maps one more time, when Dean burst into their motel room. He slammed the door shut behind him and collapsed against it.
He ran up, ripped his blade back from her abdomen, and grabbed Sam and Bris under each arm. Hoisting them up, he barreled straight through the last of the demons to reach the fence.
He stared, fixated, waiting for her to turn to him, to make a signal, to move a muscle, to do
trusting y—”
“I almost didn't recognize you, Dean. You’re...” he raked Cas’s eyes over Dean in a way that made Dean's stomach turn, “smaller and… darker than I remember. Seems you’ve put yourself through quite a lot since I’ve been away.”
Not really one of your guys’ best moves.”

There we go, see? More itch-scratching.

As in—”
"Well— yeah,” said Sam, looking back at Bris. “Th-There was an accident. A-And they got lost—"
And then,
~*~*~*~
The corner of Rowena’s lips rose. She kept her eyes on Sam. “Now this first one will be easy, even a novice could pick it up.”
What he couldn’t talk about with Rowena didn’t just go away. He was strained. Bris was strained. But the source wasn’t something he could just fix. It was a person. Someone who had just come back from the de— from the Fairly Realms, and was still recovering. Sam couldn’t be mad at her just because he was a little uncomfortable, just because Sam couldn’t keep Bris happy.
“No, of course not. This isn't finished, not for me, not until you and your family are safe.”
Crowley rolled his eyes.
“What?”
I was treated when I helped you last time,
Sam smiled, but furrowed his brow at her, “Beefcake ‘til…?”
“Cas.” Sam stepped forward, placing his hand on Castiel’s forearm, lowering the finger he was pointing at Bris. “Did you know that Dean— ...what was going on with him?”
Where did he go wrong!
They fell into a tense silence. Castiel continued to stare at the side of Sam’s head. Sam resolutely looked out at the road.
I didn’t even think this was a
“No. No he can’t be, he
What, another stupid magic language we get to learn?”
They turned to see Direl of all people running after them. He caught up to them and dropped his hands to his knees, huffing for breath.
Rowena gave him an appreciative look, and it might have been the stifling heat, but Sam was pretty sure Direl blushed.
Sam ducked his head a bit. “I… might have kinda run here when Dean told me where you were.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Think about it, guys, a selkie and an angel?” Gabriel gestured between the two of them. “We're basically opposites.”
Sam grabbed Dean by the front of his t-shirt and yanked him around.
Sam offered him a strained smile. “Of course it is. Here, I’ll buy your next beer as an apology, alright?”
“The angel wouldn’t die!” one demon squeaked. “We shot him and shot him—”
“Looks like we gotta get outta here,” Dean said to Sam.
“Just ‘cause it’s an angel’s—”
Crowley rolled his eyes. He blinked out and reappeared with Cas.

Castiel closed his eyes, sighing with what seemed like realization as the chorus began.
“Oh,” Direl frowned.
Dean let his eyes drop shut with a sigh, long and low. “Great.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. "Just great."
“Yeah, man, just— I'm fine. Not going to ask you to ditch Zeppelin. Just enjoy the song.”
But as Dean headed over the car, Sam tapped his shoulder, asking him to stop for a moment, as there was something on his mind.
Dean's hand shot out, catching Ketch by the throat, and it was a wonder the mug didn’t shatter when it fell to the table.
“That’s what I’d like to know.”
“The hell are you talking about

Sam gave him a warm smile, “That would be great, Cas. I really appreciate it.”
“Zadkiel,” said another voice.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Yeah, okay, Mom.”

Castiel huffed, a short, derisive sound. “So I’m no better than Gabriel.”
~*~*~*~*~
“He means he’s got it, Cas,” Sam clarified.
He cleared his throat and ducked his head, “Geez, uh, think I could use a drink. You want somethin’, Cas?” He shook his hands of the soapy water and took up his glass still on the counter to make his way over to the liquor cabinet.
“But what?”

“A big city?”

Cas’s eyes were wide as saucers, his neck muscles pulled taught. His hands were shoved in his pockets and he was just staring, following Dean’s every move.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, clenching his jaw to the point of pain and trying just to breathe. This wasn't happening. This couldn't be happening—
“Um… Hey.”
Rowena watched her son carefully. Perhaps it was just the lack of furniture flying at each other, but something felt... off.

“Well, I’m not sure, really. It looks leagues better than a week ago, but there’s still...” She squinted, pointing with the blade. “Oh, that must be Castiel, there.”
When Dean finally called Crowley, he picked up on the first ring.
Even in the dark, Cas saw a blush creep up Dean's neck.
Cas nodded. Dean huffed.

Cas narrowed his eyes, “Perhaps if I heard the song again—”
Crowley roared. “But
“She kissed me!”
{Lose It - Oh Wonder}
They just stared at each other again.
The leather jacket rustled in his arms as he held it tight to his chest.
Continuing to use fingers of whiskey as shots, and aided by the fact he’d never actually gotten any dinner, Dean proceeded to give himself as much courage as he thought his jacked credit card could afford. But when he finally turned back around on his stool, he suddenly realized he might have taken too long. That guy could already be gone by now, got tired of waiting, and how many gay guys were even out here in the fuckin’ boonies anyw—
“No! Dean, what—?”
fell together.
the demon sighed. "Yeah, okay, this has been fun, but I need to go hit our actual target, so we're gonna get going now, okay?"
Cas tips his head and squints at him, “Dean…?”
Bris jerked upright, sloughing Inas's arm. “Why?”
“Why not? You’re bringin’ me along an’ he’s just as good with a knife as I am.”
“We’ll leave as soon as we get Dean up,” Sam tried to calm him.
As if sensing his gaze, the man turned from the conversation he was in, and landed his eyes right on Dean.
Castiel frowned even harder at the speaker.
“Did we not just listen to the same douche-nozzle? Because I know
stop.”
“Dude, it’s been like, two days,” said Dean.
Then he reached out and took it.
“God, I always hated that in gym class,” Sam complained as he looked at his red, rope-burned hands.

"Bees don't have parties. They have debates."
Castiel put a hand on his shoulder, shifting himself in front of Sam once again. “This

There she was, running right for the water.
“What?” said Sam. He glanced over at Ketch, “Could you give us a minute?”
“What, you had the hots for that Inas—?”
The horns screamed high and Sam jumped forward to join her. They flew around the library, arm in arm, making up some sort of dance of their own as they hopped along, Cas smiling and Dean openly laughing at them as they watched.
When Dean would come out from the shower room, like a cruel repeat of when he’d left that motel bathroom an age ago, Cas found himself drawn to the droplets that gathered on the tips of his tousled hair. He found himself wanting to count each one that fell down his neck, wanted to count them first out loud with his voice, and then silently with the tip of his tongue.
“What…?” Sam spun to Dean, "What did he
What does that mean?
“Nothing you say could ever be stupid.”
“Whaddo we even do?” Direl shot a harried look at Bris. “Do we— do we bow or— or kneel or—? Fuck, Inas never said—” He clapped a hand over his own mouth at his profanity.
“Little bro, I have
“So you want to bait them,” Cas said.
Dean glanced at Bris. Then at Sam. Then at Bris again.
He glared at her.
“No one is safe. Ever,” said Jo. “But if your Jack is the Jack I met… well he’s safer than most.”
She stared at Inas, reaching to give voice to her other reasons, all of the other reasons that this couldn’t work, if only she could find them—
His feet were yanked from under him so fast he didn't even shout, and he disappeared in a splash.
He was vaguely aware that this system may have to become permanent, depending on how this went down.
Sam leapt back, spinning around. “Damn it, Gabriel—!”
He was standing in the entrance to the hallway, an absolute rat’s nest of cords gathered in his arms.
mug of water.
But Bris was watching him, watched how stiff he was standing, watched his face as it twitched, watched his hand that came up to fist at his hair.
“Well, the lore’s never completely correct, there’s always parts it misses,” Sam took a chance and let his gaze move over her, “parts it interprets wrong,” he met her eyes again.
“Wha—” she looked around,
Over at the kitchen door, Dean holstered his gun and watched fondly as their crazy little family (and Direl) fussed over Sam, making sure he was really okay, wiping the blood from his neck and carefully checking his arm, all while Cas bristled at the notion that his healing abilities were being called into question.
“Let them—”
“I don’t belong out there…” Cas says. “I was a menace, a danger, everything I touched turned to ash in my fingers—”
“Nothing, Crowley.” Dean threw a hand out at the throne room, “I don’t
well see, that there's taken care of."
“Why not? Might be better for the both of us.”
Dean is taken a little aback. “Oh. Um... Fair enough.” He gives a nervous cough. “Well, I just— I just had some things that I should say. Things I wanna say. To you. If, um… if you wanna hear them. ‘Cause I’m not makin’ you sit here and listen to my crap, I just—”
There was no semblance of a bubble to be found. There was no way to return to the numb. Everything was upside down inside of Dean and nothing was going right, nothing even had the decency to
“Yeah, Cas—”
“This area was more heavily guarded when I was here,” Cas warned them. “We’re going to need to—” He stopped.
“Cas, that can't be—”
At first Sam frowned, his brows bunched as he hunched over his page. Then he sighed once again, his shoulders tensing as he remembered.
But Dean saw him turn to Bris, saw him grinning far too wide, and he heard the

The voices continued. Sam followed them to the top of the hill, his Demon Knife already drawn.
And Dean returned it, squeezing his eyes shut, fighting the burn behind them. He put as much as he could into this hug,
Sam took a breath and let his eyes shut. “Fine, Cas, I… I had a…”
Whoa, so let’s not think and just
“This isn't his decision to—"
Sebhin was guided to the shore and helped with her coat. The remaining selkies slipped into the water as a group, some supporting Sebhin so she could swim easier, while those assigned as guard, including Bris and Direl, swam around them, keeping an eye out for threats.
Dean gave a dry laugh, “‘Course he wouldn’t. ‘Cause he’s a cute hoor, right?”
Cas filled the silence in his wake, “Dean you’re terribly upset.”
"What the hell do you want, Dean? You don't want Hell, fine, who the hell would. I'll give you other kingdoms— people—"
“He didn’t need
Soon she was pulling him to the bed, and she curled into his chest as he enveloped her in him, wrapping her body so much smaller than his in his warmth and his comfort.
"You know, lass," they said, "sometimes you're so like your father I get chills."
The concern was clear on Sam’s face,

Cas’s eyes darted between hers, “No… no, Bris, that can’t be. He’s never said anything—”
“You—! Cas, you
she sighed. Then she pointed a finger at Cas,

He was right there...
“Yeah, but you haven’t
“Well—” started Sam at the same time Crowley, Direl, Bris, and Gabriel said “Yes.”
Cas leaned forward in his seat, “Do you need help with the interview?” he asked.
“Oh, nothin'. Be my guest,” said Direl. “But I done walked in on enough make-up sessions for a lifetime. A
Cas frowned at his beer. “Sure. Cheerful.”
He held out his hand to her. She looked between him and Rowena, and though Rowena's eyebrow rose, this time she didn't make any move to stop her. So Bris stepped forward, and when she entered the circle a lavender light joined the white, mingling and blending in harmony.
“Forget the Michael thing. Can you tell what direction Dean's...
“Right… I… just don’t think they’ll be too happy to see me, you know?”
“Demons,” he said, dropping his blade from his sleeve.
“Huh,” said Cassie. She exchanged a look with Jo.
“But that’s it, isn’t it? It’s all of it. It’s the souls. It all comes down to the souls in the end, doesn’t it?”
the angel cried. “Eliminating a human stronghold!”
“Cassie—!”
Cas didn't answer.
He made it up the stairs, started down the hallway, and— oh... holy cow. Maybe Sam had a point. If he couldn’t even get up the stairs without it feeling like Douglas was standing on his chest, maybe he really
Great, now his head hurt.
But what if Michael fucked it up?
Back at the cars, Direl was still pouting, and the sight was enough to put the grin back on Dean’s face. His ears would be ringing for days, but it was absolutely worth it.
Dean didn't return to it himself for another three nights.
The outside world whipped past in an indiscernible blur as Sam flew down the road. He’d found the highway on the other side of the park and was heading north. Or was he going east? All he knew was that they had to get as far away from that shit show as fast as possible.
Well fuckin’ hell, now I sees it! You're
Shit, shit, shit— "What—? No! Nobody escaped!" Sam backtracked. "We’re not prisoners, it was just an accident! Just an accident, a-and they got lost, and now we just need to reach the settlement to the south so we can leave and we’ll be out of your—"

And before Castiel could protest any further, Dean was already out the door.

“That depends on the context.”
“What?” Dean drew his chin back. “Why the hell not? You were ready to let
Before he could say anything, Dean took hold of the conversation.
Everyone turned to Dean. He didn’t flinch under their gaze.
“Who—? What? Cassy—”
The angel gave a cursory lurch, but found Crowley’s grip was sure, and fell still.
“Shut up with your fancy lawyer talk.”
Cas raised an eyebrow, but took the bottle. “Sam said he doesn’t want me drinking our liquor—”
“Dean gave you a mixtape?”
“There’s
Dean quietly laughs, smiling to himself as he raises his drink to his lips. “Remind me to tell you about it later.”
“My... unit?”
“Hey, where’re we goin’, Cas?”
“Jesus, dude, you gotta let that go.” Dean looked him up and down. “Yeah, ain’t no gatekeepers anymore, just us. So— I dunno— go live your life, or clean up this place, or whatever the hell you want, I guess.”

“Thanks, you don't have to,” Sam cut in, taking Dean by the arm and pulling him along. “We’ll just get going now. See you later, Direl.”
“I know that, Cas! I’m gonna—! I’m gonna figure something out.” He straightened up to face him. “I’m his
Wordlessly agreeing, Cas stumbled to the brick wall and started scraping at the paint with his blade. Dean went to another.
“I, ah, I knows you can’t promise it, but... I’d sure appreciate it if you never did that again, yeah?”
And why did he always get back up again?
“Goddamn it.”
That indignant defiance he was coming to know so well flashed in her eyes, and it took all he had not to sigh at her.
Then Bris shifted, her brow twitching together in a furrow, and she turned away, finishing her reach and snapping a dead branch off a pine tree and moving on to the next.
He pushed himself up and searched the sky, but there was nothing to see except the angry clouds that continued to gather, unhindered by the events below.
Talk to me, what h—”
They wait a beat before Dean rolls a hand, “Okay, bud, we aren’t all omniscient here, you’re gonna have to elaborate.”
Bris bared her teeth at him.
The Wikipedia article was next:
Inas huffed a small laugh, “Then I’d say you’re down one trouble.”
Cas actually smiles under his little onslaught, pulling back just enough to laugh.
“Yes, well—” Ketch took a sip of his coffee, “Oh, that’s splendid— Well, some of us don’t spend our evenings getting

“So… How you feelin’ since last night? Got everything… healed alright?”
Dean snapped up at the voice. Direl had just rounded the corner—
The others stared at Castiel for a beat.
And Sam and Dean found themselves entranced. For a few verses they just watched her with their jaws on the floor, certainly not noticing the carefully analyzing squint Cas was giving her.
“Wait!” Direl called, and ran in after him.

Familiar and… warm.
“You— You didn't—” Dean sputtered. “Even if you did— and you
Then another,
“It might take a while to get something together,” he continued. “If we can't get you all passports and visas we might have to... maybe arrange some kind of sea voyage. And if that doesn’t work, maybe there's a spell... um...” He pulled himself back, lost for a moment in planning. "But once we've taken care of this demon, find out what it was here for, I'm going to come back. I'm going to help you.”
Castiel stared at him in utter confusion.
He rolled again and roughly gripped Dean’s left bicep.
“No,” Dean stopped him. “No, not now, we have to get out of here. We have to warn them—”
He dropped his head to his hand. The other, holding the speaker, fell limp between his knees.
The idea that Bris was right, that Dean felt the same way as he did now, it overwhelmed Cas. To have these desires from afar was one thing, but to imagine they might be returned— Cas almost laughed. Then he did, a sharp bark at the notion that after all this time, after all of this time that he’d spent confused and upset about these feelings, Dean might have as well, both of them flailing in this ridiculous puddle of conflictions, thinking all along it was an insurmountable sea.
Asmodeus lurched in his invisible hold, but to no avail.
Bris turned to look at the two of them. She stared, then apparently registered what she was seeing and sprang to her feet. Wound forgotten, furious thunder in her eyes, she stared down the angel who had attacked Direl. Held by Crowley.
“What?”
For that one person who cares and even knows what I'm talking about: For the purposes of this fic, Crabtree Island is uninhabited.
“Bris, love?” Inas asked.
Now that in itself shouldn’t have halted the Dean-train in its tracks, but Sam was slumped over the silver counter, his head on his arms. Beer bottles, four beer bottles, and— shit— an empty fifth of whiskey stood guard next to him on the counter. Dean checked his watch. It was ten thirty in the morning.
Sure I will, when you have something helpful to say
"I— What?"
Sam chuffed and squeezed her hand. “Promise to do anything I can not to.”
lad. Certainly you can understand that?”
“She’s innocent!” Dean snaps.
There was an awful sound, a grinding from deep beneath the earth, mounting to such a level that Dean couldn't hear Sam anymore, couldn’t hear anyone anymore. He turned back to the gaping portal now lit with a sinister orange glow, and his eyes slowly widened, and he saw.
{Rollin' in the Deep - Greta Van Fleet}
Sam stared at where Gabriel had just been, his eyes darting between that spot and Dean. He jerked himself back and with a hop he sprinted for the other rooms, calling out for Gabriel, checking if he had just flitted to another room like before. But Dean knew that this was it. Gabriel was gone.
“I— um—”
Michael, Cas, we couldn’t stay there,” Sam said. “We couldn’t just stay there and wait for him to come back and—”
She turned from him and marched back up the stairs toward the doorway. “Now if ye don’t much mind, I’m gonna go get me a handle a’ whiskey an’ lie down for the next century an’ a half.”
“Virtue? What's that got to do with answering every question that comes my way?”
He relaxed under Sam’s touch, looked up into his face, and shakily nodded.
~*~*~*~
“Baby steps,” Sam said with a nod. “Yeah.”
Her face was brightening again, “Yes, darlin’...”
Dean raises his fist again, but the bloodied Dean just looks up at him, one eye swollen shut, gripping him tightly and pleading, “Cas—”
Dean spun at Crowley’s voice. “What the

The others just nodded in response, and for a moment the four of them silently stewed in their shared hatred.

Which was why, after they got checked into the Amber Run Motel, Dean suggested that they not, in fact, go to sleep right away, but instead go check out the nearby bar.

Bris turned back slightly, keeping her eyes on the ground. “She were never nothin’.”
One minute, Sam was sharing a beer with Cas, the next, he was reliving every single thing that had happened in Hell.
Bris became tight-lipped. Her hand twitched, squeezing Sam’s.
“It’s what we

to speak up—
“Great!” interrupted Dean.
It wasn’t like that—
Over the last week, a rare happiness had settled over the bunker, a contentment they didn’t usually allow themselves. Cas was looking better every day, Sam was basically holding steady, and Bris was fucking
Not that Cas got that memo. “I’m sorry, Sam, I only want us to be prepared. And with the threat of this alternate Michael looming—”
Sam shrugged. “Said I need to be patient,” he answered.
He squeezed her tight, leaning in to kiss the top of her head. Sighing into her hair, he said, “I’m sorry.”
Yes. That.
He scoffed over the ghost of a smile and bent over the basin to splash cold water up on his face—
With a quick smile at how easily he had gotten off from that, Sam set his own book aside and stood.
*I asked Cas what he wanted to listen to in the car, and he pulled out a mixtape— from
Oh, god, now he was babbling. Great, just what he needed right—
A sharp stab of bitter rage leapt up, threatening to burst from her. She took up her tumbler and tossed back a mouthful, smothering that response with this cheap American whiskey they were so well stocked on. She clutched the glass tightly in an effort to continue holding her tongue and allow Cas to go on.
“You know what,” Sam said, “when we get back, I’ll get that set up for you, too. Might have some downtime before we head into Hell.”

“Looks like
As one passed him, Sam caught a selkie’s attention to suggest, “Hey, um, you’re gonna want to keep that fire pretty far inland, otherwise the cops will come to break up the party.”
There was no Time in Hell. At least, that was what Crowley had always told mortals who asked. It was a faster answer than the truth. Because if what they had in Hell counted as Time, it was nothing like Earth’s. Here it was almost an entity unto itself, skipping forward or stalling as it pleased, collecting around whatever it might find interesting, or ushering the occupants of the realm through what it didn’t. So once Crowley had finished tying up the annoying loose ends of his partially-successful plan, he knew to take what he could get while he was settling back into his Kingship.
the demon rolled his eyes. “My kingdom comes under attack and you think I’m just gonna
Another shout from behind. Cas had his free hand at the monster’s neck, but its claws still dug into his other arm. Blood flowed into the sand.
He flipped the radio on and cranked the static as high as it would go.
“‘Night Charlie.”

, Sam," her hand followed his face, “I told you, it’s okay.”
Now they were speeding down the highway in heavy silence, only eased by the radio Cas had asked to be turned on.
“What?” Bris pulled her chin back. “A’course he's got a soul, he’s a person ain’t he?”
“Probably,” Sam answered. He winced.
As they approached, they quickly confirmed that there were no guards on the wall. In fact, as Dean jimmied the lock on the gate, there didn’t seem to be any guards at all.
“Stand tall, My child,” said Fate. “I require nothing of you. Your acknowledgement is plenty enough.”
“But she—!”
‘er! In
Sam slammed the book shut. Bris and Direl jumped.
and then—
“...Right.”
“Well hold your horses, now, I’m comin’, I’m comin’!” said the guest. They heard them hang up their coat, loudly sloughing off their shoes and hurrying over from the living room—
“Doctor

to, except—
“I know, right? I’m like, ‘Quit meta-ing, bitch’!”
What wasn’t normal was this storm in Sam’s mind.
A laugh leapt out Dean, and he finally cracked a smile. "You’re a shit liar, Cas.”
And Sam had been powerless to stop it.
me? Are you—?
“Don’t do that, you know what. Don’t take your bullshit out on Cas.”
If Sam didn’t know better, he’d say that Gabriel actually looked… a little scared of Cas. “I didn’t say anything!” he insisted. “You all heard Lucifer—”
“Hm? Oh. Yeah?”
She sat forward from the tree she had slept against that night, her heart in her throat, her breath coming in gasps. She squeezed her eyes shut and rubbed harshly at her face, as though she could scrub the visions of cage bars and the smell of stagnant water from her mind.
He shoved his hands in his pockets and kicked at a pebble. "Lord, what I wouldn't give to know what's goin’ on in the posh one's noodle, his heart's just so… banjaxed! Poor thing’s absolutely knackered! An' the other one..." his eyes grew round, "it's just somethin' else, I'll tell ya what. More wounds than light. And the light's the new stuff."
Dean harshly jerked back the slide on his pistol. “You should stay
“Same place you get off just standing there while it happened!”
Cassie smirked at him.
“Then why am I—?”
Not like we could afford it if we could even get it. Even our jacked credit cards won’t handle that kind of money and I don’t know if we could
Gabriel hesitated, but eventually he stepped closer, sitting on the floor across the aisle from her. He settled down against an upright support, ending up next to— but absolutely

His eyes twitched, and with a sharp intake of breath he shot upright, nearly knocking right into her. He twisted around, fingers clutching at a blade no longer in his hands.
How didn't he see that Cas would be hurt in Hell? That he should have never gone in?
“Oh, darlin’," she said. "I’m so sorry.”
“Unless you’ve aquired some new items in the past year I already know this bunker top to bottom,” Ketch said as he picked up Dean's mug once more. “It’s not as though I’m going to go snooping
As if she didn't have enough of that feeling lately. “Gonna help clean up,” she growled, and she stormed off.
He sniffed, wiping at his eye. “Well, um…” he tried. “Well— wait. If... If everything was still on track when Dean got me from Stanford…then…" Sam looked up at Fate. "Then what was the demon blood for? Azazel and his 'Special Children', what were we for?”
“I know,” he said.
“Well, um..." Dean's hand made a fist against his thigh. "Alright. Then I... I guess we’ve got another shot at it, huh?”
Sitting on top of the blanket, far enough from the edge not to fall off in the night, was a new plaid shirt. It was perfectly folded into an exact square, with the collar perfectly straight and unwrinkled. And sitting on top of the shirt, in a little plastic container, was a single slice of pecan pie.
Fragments and debris rained down on the crowd of demons in attendance. They slowly rose from where they'd ducked and swiveled to face the doors— or rather, where the doors had once been— and Asmodeus sat up straight in his throne. “What in blazes—?”
With a happy sigh, she stood, and offered a hand out to him. He easily took it and pulled himself up.
the files shuffling around in Cas's mind, and it made him smirk all over again.
“I… Crowley, I…”
business an’ it ain’t
“Yes,” Sam answered Cas, “and no, Dean, I’m not going to ‘take her down’! All she’s done is bring Crowley back!”
Sam frowns even deeper, though it's definitely tempered by love. As Dean's smile widens ever-so-slightly, he spins on his heel, and steps through the portal.
“Well then, not that I don’t want to dwell on such a snuggly, heartfelt moment, but shall we get this show on the road?” Crowley turned from them and moved toward the portal, pausing as he waited for Sam and Bris to pick up their duffels.
Bris nudged Sam with their clasped hands. “So, what, yer part of a secret society, too?”
Dean thought,
“—under the usurper.”
Dean guided Cas over him and they worked into a rhythm. Then Cas’s thumb caught on his head, and Dean groaned, Cas did it again, swiping through the precome leaking from the tip, and swallowed the moan that escaped Dean.
Sam waits again for Dean to respond. To at least fight. But he’s waiting for nothing.
Sam stirred. He immediately tried to sit up. Cas almost smiled at his determination, and put a hand on his chest to slow him.
But there was no way they could hear him now.
Sam held his phone to his ear as he poured through the pile of books on the table— everything on angels, malachim, devas, tenshi— Sam intended to leave no stone unturned on this.
I… god, it's been one night but— I already feel— I mean, I don't feel— I mean— I guess I’m more curious than anything—” his head snapped up, “not that I’m
And it almost worked. It almost drew Dean back out the way it had a few days ago. Any other time, this probably would have worked like a charm. But now, Dean couldn’t take it. Couldn’t take Cas’s attentions focused on him. Couldn’t take that smile peeking around the corner of his lips. Couldn’t take those
And again.
“Smile. Love it when you do that.”
a’course!”
Wait, he had passed a staircase.
Indignation finally won out over Direl, “I am
ready for Michael.”
The others went silent. Then Sam took a purposeful step forward. “
“It only seemed fair,” Cas answered his look. “To tell you a secret. You told me one.”
When Dean awoke in the morning, Cas still wasn't there, but there
“Then what in the hell is he?” Ballo jabbed the blade in Cas’s direction.
Sebhin grinned over her pain, “Thank fuck!” she strained, almost a whine, “Get the little shit out, eh?”
Someone stomped their boots on the porch, and they heard the front door open.

“Heads up, though, s'not jus' selkies out there. We got our

“Bris, that’s— that’s how I feel around him lately.”
The proper word for that look, that same fucking look from Sioux Falls, slammed into Dean like a goddamned truck.

He opened his mouth, but had to think about his answer.
“Yeah.” Sam pressed his lips together. Then he caught sight of the frown Castiel was giving him. “I know, man, but— He could have been... redirected or something. I mean,
Dean releases a shaky breath. “Well, ah… You’re welcome.”
“Okay…” Dean returned to his bowl. He added extra sugar to the egg mix.
“But— It shoulda burned with—” Dean's mouth snapped shut, stopping him abruptly. His eyes shut tight and he shook his head before he spoke again. “That's, ah... That's great Cas,” he said with a small, if not strained smile. "That's real great."
His frustration was fading now, his blinders with it, and he thought maybe he should go back. They had been so concerned, so worried, and he had brushed them off, focused on his own need to escape the way they were all looking at him. But just as he was about to turn back, a voice piped up beside him.
“But—” Direl tried.
“Well you see, Samuel, you’re a mite
“Right?”
“It doesn't
Sam and Dean maneuvered through the door carrying Cas. Direl followed them, guiding Gabriel in gently by the shoulder.
to be kidding me!” Dean shouted as Sam snorted and Cas tipped his head at both of them from the back seat.
witch, Sam, not a Borrower,” she clarified alongside a long-suffering sigh.
“But I—”
Cas’s hand shot to Dean’s shoulder, and he felt that wonderful, familiar rush that flowed through his very core as whatever bumps and bruises he might have had were healed by that soothing light.
“Yeah, I know you’re there, princess, get over here.”
“C’mon, Cas, we both fucked up with the damn grindylows. Share the stupid apology pie with me.”
“Yeah. His soul.”

As he watches, Adam discreetly comes up to Dean. “Dean?” he asks tentatively.

Dean turned back to him and shrugged. “I mean, I can go get that whenever. What you guys did today? Way better. Like a... a
“I… I don’t...” she started. She tried again, quietly, “I don’t know if I can handle it, Sam.”
“Come now, Sam, don’t say you’ve already forgotten me. I thought we had more than that.”
“Hey, thanks,” Dean said, nudging Cas.
Concern twitched around Sam's eyes, but he didn't ask further.
He threw up an open hand at her, his eyes lighting white, and before she could react she was jerked across the frozen gravel into his waiting grip. In a blink his hand was around her throat, his Knife was against her heart, and he loomed, tall and immovable, over her.
Sam shifted next to Castiel, his shoes crunching softly in the snow.
They came to another cross in the hallways, and Crowley stopped to face Dean.
Cas stepped forward. Dean reached out, “Hey, wait—”
this payoff.”
The solo climbed above him to its dizzying heights as he fruitlessly tried to blink through the rising burn behind his eyes.
to! We gotta—!
“Wha— Of course we did!” bursts Sam. “Cas, we haven’t stopped looking for a way to find you since you vanished!”
So many questions sent the necklace into overdrive, there was no stopping Sam’s tongue, “A rescue mission, we’re saving them, because I—” he bit his tongue so hard he tasted blood. That full truth would only put Bris in danger. “—because I care about them.
“Oh. Thank you.” He smiled at the unexpected praise as he shook his hair from his face.
But when he turned to leave, a grin spread across her face, and she shot forward.
She pressed harder on the hand against his chest. “This isn’t jus’ what yer…
“A history told by old men in towers has no place for us, for
Sam shut his eyes and rested his fist on the roof. “Are you guys still in Wilmot?”
Sam sputtered something unintelligible, reaching out to fiddle with his glass of wine. Bris looked over at him, and her eyes softened.
But before Dean could stammer his way out of that, Bris leaned forward and handed the cap to Cas, “Oh, no, I wanna hear this. Come on, Snapples, lay it on me.”
Jody and Donna did magic.
Dean gestured wordlessly to the shredded, bloodied clothes barely covering his healed wounds.
Sam got to his feet, surprisingly steadily now. He tried that deep breath again, and it felt like a summer breeze, hot and relieving.
interested in any type of conversation. There had been children’s toys inside and a playpen set up in the corner, so Dean couldn’t blame him. If a group of adults approached them now that they had baby Samwise? He probably would’ve acted the same.
We’ll see. Claire is in a mood tonight… pizza is a good motivating factor, though.
“Hi, I’m Kali Sharma.” A beautiful, mocha skinned woman stepped out of a sleek red car, looking far too put together in comparison to the rest of them. Her hand was warm in Castiel’s as he shook it and he smiled warmly back at her. “I’ve heard so much about you.”
Instead, he lifted his hand and placed it into Dean’s, ignoring the way a shiver went up his spine, the way Dean’s hand still fit perfectly in his, slightly bigger and warm where it wrapped around him. They shook twice, then Castiel pulled his arm back like it was on fire and turned back to the principal.
When he looked up, it was the last person he’d expected to see. Jo Harvelle was just as pretty and fierce as she’d been in high school, confident and cool in a way Castiel had always been jealous of. He stared as Jo asked, “Claire Novak?”
Dean twisted his fist over the head of Castiel’s cock and with a few more strokes, Castiel was shaking in his arms, spilling over his hand. They stayed standing close underneath the spray with Castiel’s head resting against Dean’s shoulder.
“Dean,” Castiel hissed a warning, glancing at Dean before turning back to Garth, Kevin, and the third man.
Dean thought about it, but he avoided talking to Gabriel if he could help it, and just the thought of getting the other man on the phone made him uncomfortable. So, show up and hope was what they were going for. At the very least, even if what was left wasn’t the flavor Ben wanted, it would still be a damn good cake.
It was difficult to stab their hearts with the Lifeless usually flailing and reaching for their meals, but stabbing their brains was even harder. The human skull protected them and resulted in a painful ricochet down Dean’s arm. If anything, all he knew from taking down the handful of creatures was that he needed a better weapon.
Dean groaned as his knot caught, locking them together. He ground down, reaching between them to wrap his fingers around Castiel's neglected cock, giving just the right amount of pressure to make him see stars.
“That sounds perfect,” Lisa replied, leaning against the railing. “Hey, Castiel? Ben is my priority… his happiness, stability. And I may be way out of line but… his father’s happiness is a direct connection to Ben’s. And… well, I think you two would make each other happy.”
“You’d have more sympathy from him,” Missouri quipped back. Dean looked and glared at her, the older woman completely unphased. He stared back in challenge for a few seconds, then sighed and looked away. Though he noticed the smirk on her face as he did so. God, he missed her just as much as the rest of the ‘spirits’...
Anna shrugged and pushed away from the chairs. “Your choice. Now, I bet Uriel’s back here…” She continued walking and Alfie gave a small sigh. Dean turned his head to look at the kid, raising a brow.
know what you’re doing.”
“You honestly believed I was going to leave you there to die?” Castiel hissed and Dean’s own eyes widened.
“But what if he’s not there, Cas? What if the city had fallen too far and it wasn’t safe? What if he’s gone?”
Dean’s heart was a fool, for it was doing backflips, excited that
“No,” Ben sounded disappointed and Dean made a mental note to maybe find a frog pond or something near them, “the counselors wouldn’t let us, they were afraid we’d kill them or something. But when we went for a campout the next night, we got to go fishing!”
. While part of him felt like a completely different person than he was six years ago, it was as if absolutely nothing had changed and he shifted slightly to look over his shoulder, making sure it was Gabriel he’d walked in with and not Balthazar.
“Looks painful, brotha.”
“Yeah, I gathered.” Dean smiled back at him and realized how small the hallway really was. There were only a few inches between them and Dean’s traitorous heart started beating a little bit faster. The sudden urge to close the distance between them was nearly overwhelming - be it Claire and Gabriel’s questioning, the orchard trip yesterday, or the fact that Castiel still set his very skin on fire… Dean wanted nothing more than to cross that line.
of a woman in labor was what Hollywood showed him, and he was sure that was less than realistic. Castiel had dropped down to his knees beside the bed and had the sheet covering Gilda’s body pulled up to her knees.
“Now,” Anna pulled back, clapping her hands together before she stood and grabbed Castiel’s bag from the floor, “you need to go and shower so I can figure out what you’re wearing for you date.”
“Please,” Balthazar answered, reaching forward to place his hand at the base of Castiel’s spine, leading him forward until they were standing side by side opposite the priest. Castiel looked down at the table, the first scroll catching his attention.
Castiel looked to the side, his eyes tracking a single firefly that was closer than the rest. Above him, he felt Dean shift slightly and knew he was looking at the same bug. "I wish..." Castiel whispered, then shut his eyes, finishing his wish silently. When he opened his eyes again, Dean was looking down at him with a soft smile.
“On it,” Dean answered back and shut his eyes for a moment, focusing. He had a job to do and he had to trust Jo would do hers
He had no idea how he got into this barn, nevermind who the stranger was or what he wanted. The fact that Dean still had his supplies hopefully meant that the man wasn’t a threat.
“You’re so infuriating! You just want to blame me for everything because you can’t take responsibility for your own actions-”
Dean’s entire body seized and he scrambled up into a sitting position, angling his back towards the table to face the man straight on. The man was wearing a long, tattered trench coat - the bottom of it tracked with mud. Though Dean’s own clothing had probably fared just the same. He had dark blue pants on and a plain white t-shirt to match. His face was streaked with dirt, too, but his expression was open and friendly. Dean stared right back at him. The man’s eyes were a striking blue despite the darkness of the barn.
“I understand. I can be there by tomorrow afternoon,” Sam said softly, clearing his throat. “Thank you, Sergeant.”
“Kids like to draw me pictures,” he said and flushed slightly. “Um, hold on.” He pushed open the door and Castiel stepped into the doorway, looking around the room.
Naomi’s eyes widened before narrowing, locked onto Gabriel’s face, and Castiel was just happy that look wasn’t directed at him. It looked just like Mommy’s look when they were having a wrestling match in the living room and knocked the plant off of the window.
He wiped his hands on his jeans as he neared the travel stop, slowing down his pace to survey the surroundings. There were cars parked haphazardly around the gas station, a layer of dust and bird shit covering them. From what he could see, the cars themselves were empty and other than a few crows hopping over the tar, there was no movement.
, Castiel his traveling partner.  The idea of going on alone made him cold, but the idea of begging or forcing Castiel made it even worse. “You don’t have to-”
Benny clicked his tongue as Dean stared, shaking his head. His entire being was swaying in and out of Dean’s vision, as if his entire body was like the waves of an ocean, constantly shifting and moving. He was unlike any type of spirit he or Sam had ever encountered before… He drank too much, way too much, before Sam managed to take away the bottle of Jack. It was the only explanation…
“I know,” Castiel answered, adding another finger and twisting them. “You feel so good.”
Meg’s eyes narrowed and Dean stared her back down, waiting for it. She didn’t disappoint. “So, you plan on breaking his heart any time soon? Cause, I got to tell you-”
“Do you think he meant to end the world?”
He still wasn’t perfect, some days he wanted nothing more than to say fuck it and head down to the liquor store. And despite what everyone said, part of him was staying sober for Castiel. To himself, his own life didn’t matter, but Castiel did. Ben did. He enrolled himself back into school, working on his nursing degree, and was drawn to kids, enjoying all the years he’d missed with Ben. Slowly, Lisa started to trust him again, to send Ben for afternoons and outings.
"I've long since made peace with what happened, Cas. And I've made peace with Balthazar, who was only a child as well. Sam and I had good lives, Ellen and Bobby took us in and raised us like their own; we couldn't have asked for anything better." Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's forehead, then brushed back his hair. "I mean it, Cas. Sam and I are happy, despite everything that happened."
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, they all looked up to see the main doors of the aforementioned building swing open. A group of three men were walking out laughing, and Dean felt himself tense up in surprise and alarm.
Castiel nodded, then cleared his throat. “I’m going to give you a free pass today, we both need sleep. In the comfortable beds we have at home. But we are going to be discussing this and there will be punishment.”
Still, every night they sat beside a small fire and ate together, Castiel taking first watch while Dean set up their sleeping gear. Castiel had yet to say anything about how close they slept now, and he sure as hell didn’t move further away when Dean laid close beside him, curling into Cas’ side to sleep. Maybe it was comforting just to be near another person, but Dean didn’t question it either when Castiel laid down to sleep with his hand on Dean’s leg.
“Blindfolded,” Dean added, stepping over Castiel to fall onto the couch. He pulled a pillow free and dropped it down, Castiel spluttering as it nailed him in the face.
Gabriel had been strangely quiet about the people in town, focusing mostly on what was new with his bakery, how Mom and Dad were fairing, and the new shops that were popping up around town in place of their childhood favorites. He’d helped Castiel tour houses for sale, and if he didn’t Facetime with his brother ever again, it would still be too soon.
choice?” Dean asked, then shut the car door, walking around the front to join Castiel. They didn’t need to be overheard by the retreating group. “It's… weird how trusting they are. Tell me you don’t think that this is weird! Hell, I could get into the freaking car and plow them down, you know?”
Castiel sighed and shook his head. “I’m sorry, Dean. I’ll talk to her about it. She shouldn’t be asking you about our… past.”
. Instead, Dean had carried their bodies to the master bedroom and shut the door, effectively making the upstairs a tomb.
Charlie looked up and smiled, turning in the bench so Dean could sit beside her. He didn’t hesitate when she offered up Samwise, taking the baby into his arms.
Dean turned in alarm to survey the rest of the room. They were all in the bunker’s main room, Castiel and his future self standing off with one another on either side of the map table, Sam sitting on the edge with a bag of ice pressed to his forehead.
“Mom,” Jack cleared his throat, his eyes darting from Dean to his mom, brow furrowing, “you need to rest. I’ll help Cas take care of Dean.”
- why would -” He growled in frustration and ripped the hat off his head before reaching back up and tugging at his hair.
Castiel and Anna looked down to the bottom of the stairs to see Balthazar with his arms swept out wide, wearing his full royal wardrobe. Castiel raised his brow, glancing over to Anna to see if she was as surprised as he was.
Lucas' eyes widened for a moment before a huge smile broke out across his face. Castiel nodded, clenching his hands into tiny fists as he shook his hands in excitement. "Yes! You
She raised a brow and huffed a sigh, then waved her arm out. “You going to just lay there? I can transport you that way, if you’d like. You’ll probably end up landing wrong, though…”
Castiel clicked his tongue, ignoring the sigh coming from his brother beside him. Lucas had already told him to stop three times, but he couldn’t help it. He was scared; not scared like he was when he woke up in the hospital the first time and couldn’t find Mommy, and not scared when they took him away from Lucas and Gabriel in the firetruck, but… a different kind.
“No,” he answered softly. “Not… that far. But the East Coast is pretty congested and-”
“I don’t have a mom,” the boy answered with a shrug, almost losing the rolls again. “Daddy is arguing with Claire about ‘propriate language in public.” The boy beamed back up at him and Dean found himself smiling.
He crouched down and pulled the bottom drawer out, scooping the sweatshirt that was folded awkwardly over the top. Beneath it were bottles of prescription medication, medical supplies, ammunition, and a letter.
Six years had felt like a lifetime, in a way. He tried not to wonder what would have been if Jimmy had still been alive. If he still had his twin, his best friend, would his presence at the Novak's home be welcome now?
“Are you excited?”
Castiel smiled and laid his head against Dean’s chest, listening to his heart beat. They laid together, their bodies slowly cooling and Castiel was just about to find a blanket when Dean’s stomach let out a loud growl. Castiel laughed, leaning up to press a kiss to the side of his throat before he rolled over him and off the couch. Dean groaned and reached for him, trying to pull him back in.
Castiel wrinkled his nose. "That sounds gross," he commented and Lucas laughed a little, nodding his head.
“I don’t know what I would have done,” Charlie whispered suddenly, eyes flicking back up to meet Dean’s gaze, “if we hadn’t found you. If we were still out on our own… I wouldn’t be able to do what Castiel is doing.”
“Walking away is brave, and it’s hard, and it’s really important, guys. You can’t get in the habit of fighting back with your fists, okay? The best thing to do with bullies is ignore them, because they get their power from thinking they hurt you.”
Sam raised an eyebrow and then smirked. “You know, our foster mom owns a pub in town and she makes the best shepherd's pie and honey cakes.”
“Shhhhh,” child Dean whispered loudly, pushing his finger to Mary’s lips as she did the same to him. Mary’s eyes were shining, her smile radiant, and it made Dean’s chest ache.
Castiel chuckled and nodded, releasing Dean’s arm, his fingers trailing down Dean’s skin as he pulled back. He went back over to the fridge and reopened it, looking over the contents. “Well… I have fruit punch, orange juice, water… and a few cans of Cola.”
"We are not yet mated, Castiel. And as far as our kingdoms will know, we mated on this night as we were supposed to. However, I am in love with another." Balthazar lifted a hand, pulling the soft fabric of his wedding tunic away from his neck and revealing the deep red mating mark against his throat.
“That’s very true.” Castiel laughed and there was a pregnant pause before he blurted out, “I’m in trouble.”
Castiel hummed softly, leaning over the map. “I’m worried about most of these cities.” He drew his finger across Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Pittsburg. “While we can theoretically avoid everything except Cleveland if we stay slightly north of them, something in my gut tells me that this entire area is going to be a hot zone.”
“The only thing I want in my vision is you on the floor, bloodied and beaten, after I kick your goddamn ass!”
Dean nodded and followed after Castiel. Jack placed his name card next to Kevin, and Castiel sat down next to him with Dean taking the third spot at the corner of the table. At the head of the table, a thick, handsome man was sitting, though his attention wasn’t anywhere near the newcomers. Dean followed his gaze and saw a pretty red-head helping a heavily pregnant woman over to the table, talking quietly to her.
Castiel could tell Sam about how hard they fought, they could share stories about Dean and Sam growing up, Castiel and Dean on the road… they would get along, Dean knew it in his very soul. And maybe Castiel would find someone in Sam’s camp, would get the chance to fall in love and…
“You look exhausted,” Dean whispered, reaching up to push Castiel’s hair back from his forehead. “Come on, I’ll get you something to eat and then you should sleep.”
The few stores he could see into that looked promising were thankfully empty of people and creatures, and Dean was able to refill his canteen, obtain a second back up of water, and a few more cans of food. He was damn lucky to find a pharmacy that hadn’t been completely ransacked and threw some ace bandages, gauze, and triple antibiotic ointment into his stash of goods.
Castiel looked up and met Dean’s gaze, something twisting inside of him at the raw
He watched as Claire pursed her lips, thinking. “Do you think Gabe will show me how to make those scones?”
As he came around the corner, he nearly slammed into a child who was struggling to carry a container of chocolate muffins, a bag of cookies, and a bag of sub rolls. He looked up with wide eyes, almost dropping the rolls until Dean moved quickly to adjust his arm load.
Meg had met Claire first after she took a position as the guidance counselor, and she’d tagged Claire as a challenge from day one. When Claire had wandered into his classroom, with her too-thick eyeliner and a ‘don’t fuck with me’ attitude, Castiel knew what Meg meant. Claire was
“I have no idea what the hell you two are going on about,” Charlie added in and Dean turned to her to give her an apologetic smile.
It’s a typical story of Omega meets Alpha and falls madly in love. And, well, the best way to tell a story is to start at the beginning.
Jack smiled and nodded, holding onto the wax like a lifeline. The two lit candles flickered and danced, an easy calm falling over them all. Finally, Jack spoke again. “My mom told me I would have to choose… that she didn’t want me to stay here in the house by myself after she was gone. I know most of the families have offered for me to live with them but…” Jack gave a small shrug, looking over at Dean this time. “I don’t want to stay with any of them.”
He grabbed two pies and a loaf of garlic bread, then organized the shelf of cookies until he felt it was safe enough to head towards the checkout. With a bag in hand, he just barely refrained from running out of the store, stopping dead the moment he stepped back outside into a wall of heat.
much trouble! And then, oh my God, Dad, you should’ve
"Dean, Dean
“Deal,” he laughed and clapped Gabriel on the shoulder. “No vomit, promise.”
“Are we safe here?” Dean asked, waiting for Cas to meet his eyes. “I mean, are we
The tears he cried did nothing to help the situation, but Dean was frozen against the kitchen counter, Lisa’s body growing colder in his lap and Ben’s already like ice beside him. It was clear that it would be seen as an act of defense, but he couldn’t bring himself to call 911. What would he say? How would he explain what he saw in Lisa’s eyes?
“Gabriel?” Castiel whispered, his hand tightening around Dean’s painfully. Then, he was suddenly gone, charging through the snow.  “Gabriel!”
“When I found out what happened, what the system
Dean gave a small smile, nodding his head. “I just wanted to help, I didn’t expect it to become a thing.”
“We can hear them in there, but the doors are barred on the other side, we think.”
Castiel snorted at that, nodding his head. Honestly, one of the reasons his parents hadn’t changed this bedroom over was so that they could enforce any significant others sleeping in the guest room instead - despite Amelia and Jimmy living together, they hadn’t been married, so sharing a bed was unthinkable.
Castiel turned toward the second person, his gaze unseeing and a steady, toothy grin spreading wide on his face.
That concern— of course— being Dean. As always.
She spread her hands toward him, almost in a beckoning gesture. Sam's eyes darted across her, over the unfamiliar features, his brow wrinkled and his lips twitching.
“All we
At least Crowley had been right about the guards. There were hardly any.
Dean raised it higher.
“‘Okay.’ Right.” Cas said, and moved on to the next injured selkie.
Dean stared Lucifer down, the lines on his face cutting sharply under the slowly strobing red lights.
~*~*~*~*~
Ooh-ooh,
Dean had said that he was more than his use.
“What the hell happened, Crowley?” Sam demanded. “Where’s Rowena?”
“A-and I know you and Donna might have to get in, so I’m leaving you the key, I’ve got a— a lock-box at the bank that you’ll have access to so—”
“Next time your ancestors create a secret labyrinth of a central base,” he huffs, “tell them to put in some damned ramps.”

Sam smiled down at the surprisingly strong selkie and did his best to hug them back with his hands still full of papers, “Hey, um, no problem…”
I dunno! He's upset! Even
off! You first, though,” he said with a smile, taking another drag off his new drink, whatever it was. This one was adorned with a lovely little umbrella.
“I—” Cas nodded, finally closing his eyes. “I know.”
He smiled as she approached him, a smile that Mary had come to learn meant he had just discovered something new, something wonderfully exciting, and she couldn’t help but return that smile before he could even mention what it might be.
Cas glanced uneasily between Sam and Dean’s quickly wilting figure. “I expected this would be a stealth mission.”
“I bent the rules of reality to get you back,” Jack says proudly.
them! I died a stupid death!”
He tried to shove his shoulder out of Cas’s grasp. It didn’t budge. “If I’m drunk, so are you!”
And she vanished.
As the three of them walked out the door, Dean turned back to Direl, “If we’re not back by sunrise, call the number under ‘Jody’ that I put in your phone. And if she doesn’t answer, call ‘Donna’.” He paused. “Actually, just call any woman's name in that phone and if none of them answer you’re probably fucked anyway, so… At that point you might as well call Garth. He’d probably get a kick outta you.”
talkin’ now.”
problem?”
“Castiel?” one of them said. “But—”
“I…” Cas dropped his eyes to the floor, “I’m sorry, I—”
She faced him, and Sam saw the tracks of tears on her own cheeks, saw the pain and fear in her eyes.
Sam looked at him carefully. “That’s… very level-headed of you.”
Dean growls.
He was a man of average height, with tidy, straight black hair styled perfectly above a brown, finely-wrinkled face, wearing a black suit, a short beard, and a bored, yet sour expression. He looked down at the markings on the floor, tutted at them, then brought his gaze up to the small crowd before him.
She followed the knife’s motion with her eyes. “A’course not, Sam,” she said.
“I see.”
A hand grabbed his bicep and he was quickly rising. “Whoa.”
Gabriel’s eyes flicked away. “Breaking his heart, duh! Dad’ll be downright Old Testament Wrathful if some asshat like Dean-o goes and breaks Cassy’s heart!”
Direl’s face fell. He leaned back, returning to his seat, “Right, erm... Sorry.”
“Like human eyes,” he amended, 'discomfort' having now been added to his list of known causes for reddening. “But multiplied on a scale your mind isn't designed to comprehend.”
“No, it’s—” she cut him off, looking between her hands and his. She dropped her eyes to the ground, “Sam, you're— Ye don’t hafta do this.”
Well, you’ve probably rested enough by now. Thank you for joining me in this little intermission, see you again at the end!

“And we
She leapt at him, and in his surprise he caught her on reflex. She wrapped her legs around his hips and took the back of his head in her hands and she crashed into him, and she gripped the back of his head and she pulled him in for a frenetic, bruising, haphazard kiss.
“The canal.”
Fate returned her attention to everyone else. “My apologies for my abrupt entrance,” she said. “It seems to be how you are typically greeted and I didn’t wish to alarm you unnecessarily.”
“You’re very welcome,” Rasul said with another polite nod. Then he vanished.
Cas frowned at him, “Why did you skip that one?”
This was for Fergus’s own good, she told herself.
“I been tryin’ fer

“Before that,” Dean interrupted. “She did somethin' to Sam a month ago. Put somethin’ on him. Made him all… Made him all…” Dean shook a hand near his head, not sure of what word he needed.

Bris turned back once Sam was through to the hall. “Get
"Fine. What did you do, then?" Sam asked instead.
Sam drew in a breath. “Well, you have us now,” he said. “Eight of us, maybe five of them. Do they know you’re coming?”
Ketch looked between Sam and Dean once more. He locked eyes with Sam and slowly said, “I'm going to put my hand in my right pocket.”
To Bris’s surprise, she found that they were in front of the bar again. Inas pulled ahead and reentered without another word.

By the time he turned around, Bris had already left. He sighed again, and started searching his drawer for a shirt.
This seems to cause Cas the greatest pain of all. “I
Then she shoved Crowley away, and lowered her blade.
Sam leaned forward in his seat. “So what did he say?” he asked.
Certainly nothing to do with the events of that morning on Earth.
“D’ye still...” she tried. “Do you still want it?”
Dean gaped in the doorway. He walked in a few steps, gingerly picking up a small box.
Sam, Bris, Cas, and Jody, completely unable to follow what had just happened before them, could only stare at the doorway after them.
"...Hey," Sam said.
The aforementioned ‘weird laceration’ was impossible to miss: a circular mark about a foot across with radiating gouges cut throughout.
“Is not to blindly follow,” Fate answered with finality. “You were not made to serve, you were

*Hey... you comin’ back there, love?*
“That was excellent, Sam, you’re gettin’ faster.”
But something was bothering Mary, something she needed to talk to Jack about. So when the boy got up to get another mug of water, she followed him over to the barrels.
“Great,” Rowena said, almost sarcastically as she looked up at Gabriel, “Fantastic. Alright, we need to get out of here—”
Castiel opened his mouth—
“I know, but—”

And from what? A fuckin’ mistake from his fuckin’ hip meds. Dean finished off his whiskey and silently hoped he wouldn’t end up like that if he got old. Bad hips and a billion pills to take just to kill you in your sleep—

Gabriel popped up, an eyebrow raised, “Thought you said he smashed one of Dad’s Tablets just to save Dean?”
Because soon, whatever conversation was happening around him shifted, and when Dean glanced up he found that Cas had come to join them, setting a bottle of Snapple, sans lid, in front of Bris. The lid had stayed in Cas’s hands as he sat next to Dean and eagerly read his little factoid to them:
Jack’s glare faltered.

“Sam!” the voice called again. Footsteps rushed toward him, he shut his eyes, bracing himself—
“Well pardon me if I ain't pussy-footin’ around anymore! You need help, an’ ye needed it yesterday!”
“Translation between English and Enochian is very difficult, Dean—”
“No! No— I mean, i-it’s fine. If you could just… not…”
Cas paused for a long moment before he answered. “Yes, I do, but you should go to bed.”
“Oh, but you have. As have all of you.” She looked to the others as well. “I have been with you from the start, in the turn of chance or through the closest escape, in the change of the wind— or perhaps—” she smiled at Castiel, “of a song.”
Cas fidgeted with the cap again,
“Hey,” Dean put a hand on his shoulder. “It’s gonna be alright, buddy. It’s a short trip, we’ll only be out there a little while.” He said it for himself as much as Cas, hoping that Cas didn’t pick up on it.
“Dean…” Cas took Dean’s hand and lowered it.
Cas had turned and was now facing them as the two approached the car.
“I couldn’t protect Jack, I could never protect Jack—”
“What?” Dean barked.
or a selkie pelt.”
Bris leapt at her afanc with a frenzied scream, aiming to plunge her dagger into its neck, but the creature flailed and knocked her with its snout. She fell, "Fuck!" but quickly jumped back to her feet.
She raised an eyebrow at him as they skirted a rosebush. *Oi now, when did you get so deep, Direl?*
Rowena, Sam, and Direl appeared in another hallway. Sam couldn't place his finger on it, but this one was different than the others. Gabriel’s grip tightened around Sam's neck, and this time he had to reach a hand up to adjust his arms.
“Whoa, easy there,” Dean groaned, putting a hand to his head. “Go slow for me, ‘kay?”
“Hey. I think found what took all the married women,” Sam said, keeping his voice low.
Having had almost a week to imagine exactly how this argument would explode, Castiel braced himself for the worst. Then Dean finally met his eyes and he said:
He could feel the heat of her blush under his lips.
Slightly disorganized, the selkies retreated, skirting the edge of the empty campsite. They ducked behind the trees as the witch continued to approach, still firing off a miriad of spells.
“Then I'll try again.” Cas pointed up at the dotted sky. ”They look like stars, but stars don't come in as many colors. Stars are white or red or yellow or sometimes blue, and some colors that you cannot see, but souls are any color they please, anything from within or without the spectrum visible to humans. Usually many all at once...”
“They're gonna kill me if I tell you anything anyway—”
In a breath Bris spun around and sprinted up the stairs, already calling out for him before she’d even reached the top—
And that intensity scared him.
“And you surely couldn’t, darlin’,” she smiled warmly at him.
The question almost fell from his lips right then— to ask what the fuck that look was about, to ask why he kept
“What
Castiel now wandered the bunker.
“Oh— No. Not at all.”
“Look at this,” he said as he lifted his mug to her, “I wanted to show you before the last attack but there wasn’t time.”
Claire stumbled a bit as she tried and failed to kick off her shoes. “Shit, right, um, lesbian! Maybe. Surprise!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean had held off on his usual beers this morning so he could really focus on Baby, but now, man, he just needed a drink. Something to take this edge off.
“And you actually think Dean would to agree to that?” Cas said, stepping forward.
I told you what I saw, and you did
He went over the conversation again in his mind, and soon came to the realization that Dean hadn’t become uncomfortable until Cas had greeted him.
"Because there's no
I just don’t do that.”
Castiel saw the cut had sliced across her bicep, right through a design that looked like a triquetra linked through with a ring.
“No, Cas, he
I gave up where your cell was, I even offered that knife—
Dean and Cas rushed back to Sam's room. Even still unsteady on his feet, Cas entered the room first, and Dean shut the door behind them— right in Ketch’s face.
A blue light flashed through the water. It spread like a ripple, but flew as fast as a shockwave across the surface.
Bris took a near-empty fifth off one cousin and accepted an old shirt from another. She rushed to rinse and fill the bottle in the creek, and ran back to Inas.
in silence. Complete silence. I mean— it could have been a trick or something. God, if it was a trick… I don't think Dean could have survived that.
At the fifth hour he stopped for gas. He avoided the drink coolers in the store.
Cas’s weak protests were drowned out by the boisterous tussle over who got to pour Claire a glass or keep it away from her. Dean won out though, sneaking her his glass and then asking for more for himself, and the joy contained in their knowing smiles was almost enough to chase away Cas’s guilt for a while.
And so the bunker settled back into a routine, of chores and learning and movies and meals, and Sam allowed himself to relax. Things were good for now, things were okay, so he did his best not to look this gift horse in the mouth, and tried to just enjoy it.
“Dean— Look. I-I know I’ve been... giving you your space, been letting you process everything and all, but— Look, did something happen?”
Back at the camp, with everyone healed, the fire restarted, and the liquor flowing freely, everyone gathered together to discuss what would come next.
“Yeah, I suppose we should,” he sighed. “But where do we even start?”
He raised hopeful eyes to Bris.

Crowley shook it slightly, still offering.
he informed her.
Over the course of the evening Dean taught Cas the basics of drink mixing. He figured out early on that Cas had a sweet tooth when it came to booze. They'd assembled the Irish Cream and made some Buttery Nipples, and Cas had enjoyed them greatly, but when they got to those Rum ‘n’ Cokes, Cas found those boring, and the bubbles tickled his nose.
“You’ve already got the keys," said Dean, "why don’t we meet back at the motel later?”
“Turn back!”
Castiel shut his eyes.
Shut up!
“I don't have to,” Dean cut him off. "Sam needs you, Cas, this is completely different.” He placed a hand on Castiel's arm and Castiel snapped to face him. “You just said it, we can't wait.”
“Oh! Here—” said Sam, springing forward before she could even lower her raised arm, and breaking it off for her.
“So you’re choosing, that
Castiel had flinched back, and now watched with his blade at the ready, his expression tinged with both confusion and horror.
She didn’t let go of his hand.
she dismissed him. "Don’t you worry your pretty little head over it.”
Bris stood with the phone in her hands.
“The… the, um—”
There was a rush of wings, and a voice, “So. You figured it out yet?”
“Don't even give me that, have you looked at yourself? You’re not going to be any use eith—”
Fifteen.
"No." She squeezed her eyes shut. When she opened them again, they burned with defiant determination. "No. I can do it."
Chuck paused mid-step. Then he turned, and faced Castiel again, that same, too-wide smile breaking out once more.

“Ah." Dean let his head fall to the floor. “Ow.”
And sure, that vampire nest had gone down fast, but that one that had gotten behind him—
Then he set it down on the island, and moved over to one of the upper cabinets near the stove. He frowned in concentration, searching through its contents.
All is quiet.
tired. So maybe we could figure this out later this...” Sam scrunched his face. “Wait, what time is it even? How long was I out?”
As he went, Dean leaned back from the computer to bark at his retreating back, “And put a damn shirt on!”
Cas needed the perfect song.
“Um, Cas—”
“Look, do we have, like, a secret handshake that we can prove ourselves with or something?” Dean snapped, clearly growing impatient.
“What even is this?” the witch stepped forward, out of breath and clearly annoyed. She was holding a spellbook that she hadn't had before. “I mean, what are you doing here? What do you even
He got some shrugs and nods in response.
they would be a source of comfort, but right now, she just didn't want any of it.
Rowena took her wrist, positioned her over the bowl, and quickly sliced across Bris’s arm. She hissed as the blade slit her skin and clenched her jaw as she bled into the bowl.
“I could do that.”
Whoa, I’ll rock you like the sea,
help you, now that we know what we’re dealing with.” Sam turned his phone to her, showing her an image of a medieval painting of an afanc. It had the snout of a crocodile, the body of a beaver, and was probably the size of a young grizzly bear. “Does that look right?”
“Well, what’s it say? Lay it on me, Snapples.”
“Yeah, no, not usually, no.”
“I doubt that.”
didn’t sign up for this.”
“It’s like, nine o’clock, calm down,” Sam huffed. He addressed the table where Cas, Bris, Gabriel, and Direl also faced him, and pointed at his screen. “So get this: there are some insane omens coming out of Texas.”
“Do you want me to leave, Cas?”
“Good morning, Dean.”
Sam tried to bite his tongue, but he was quickly coming to realize that never worked. “Because we know the person who might own the farm and he probably won’t like that we’re keeping you around.”
selfish."
“No, stop—
“Bris, I get it. I do,” Sam was saying. “You were just… You saw we were in danger and you got us out of there. Of course you did. And I…” He exhaled, shoulders dropping. “...I shouldn’t have gotten mad.”
Because it wasn’t.
Inas didn’t answer that. In fact, they went silent for so long Bris turned to look at them.
“Bris!" The man pulled her into a great hug. "T'ank God I found you. Thought you'd headed down south!" He spoke with an accent as thick as Bris's, yet somewhat rounder than hers.

“You gonna tell me what the fuck happened last night?”
Michael stared at Sam for a beat, incredulous. Then burst out a laugh, shaking his head as Dean’s shoulders bounced. Gradually, he trailed off, looking back up to Sam. The grin dropped from his face. “Oh. You were serious.”
Cas shifted minutely closer in his chair. “Whatever it is... I won’t be upset.”
Sam looked him up and down, eyebrow rising even higher. “Yeah, I guess. Sure.”

“Sam,” Bris smiled.

yes.”
"Hey, I know, man, I know," said Sam, resuming the movement of his hand, pulling Castiel back just a little bit more.
Wait...
“Then push me in the Pit!” Cas cried, his eyes jumping to the clouds. “Sam has another plan, we don’t need Michael! Just let me go, Dean!”
“Here,” he said, handing it to Castiel, “now it won’t run out of battery.”
“Can’t bring someone who’s not here, Sam.”
“Then you go to him.”
Dean went to Cas and dropped roughly to the ground next to him, leaning against the wall, still breathing heavily from the pain and the sprinting.
His hand glowed with grace and he tried again.
When they pulled into the motel parking lot, Sam hopped out and jogged straight to the door. He turned back, his hand on the door handle, “Give me just a sec in here, guys, hang out here. You can handle Direl, right, Cas?”

That he thought he could do things.
Chuck opened his mouth to speak, but paused in the motion.
“‘S jus’ remindin’ me… a’ the shit I can’t...” Dean slurred. He squeezed his eyes tight and turned up the volume of the replacement song. “Nevermind, Cas. Ain’t your shit t’ worry ‘bout.”
“Good.” Dean nodded as he turned around again. “Good.”
“What—? I—”

“I, um… So yer boy’s ‘round heres somewhere, right?” Direl fumbled, and turned to continue down the hall.

“What did you—” Cas began to turn around.
He ducked back down to grab a second one— "Oh, hang on...” and reached further into the back to pull out a flask.
“Yes, yes! Through you, I’ve been figuring all of this out!
What? No, that wasn’t—
He turned again, scanning for even the slightest movement.
Like a switch, Gabriel perked up, calling after him, “Hey, where ya goin’, Sammich?”
“Aye, but it’ll be over soon,” her aunt said as she scooted over to sit nearer Sebhin and pat the hand on her belly. “You're gonna pop any day now and then you'll get a whole new set a' aches to tend!”
“Whatever. Thanks.”
Oh, hey, here comes Plato—
Sam took a deep breath,
“That was always the plan, we only need him a little longer.” He looked over his brother. “Did he only just tell you?”
“So, what, he’s staying out there all night?”
This new twist in this urge wasn’t entirely foreign either, he’d experienced it some with April, and certainly with Meg. But it had never been like this. Meg had come close, but… It had never been so
“I do.” Sam bristled at her flippant tone. “What Asmodeus did, I’m not letting that happen ever again.”
Sam breathed shakily into a smile. He was, without a doubt, the luckiest man there ever was. “Then… Fuck... You do what you want.”
Direl grumbled sharply into his drink even as his cheeks reddened in embarrassment.
You can’t understand, okay? So just fuck off, already.” He turned from Sam to follow the rest of the group.
“Yes, Sam, I do believe you came here with a purpose,” she said. She turned that smile onto Castiel. “And might I just say how much I
Holy bollocks, was that…?
“You’re… You’re not…”
“He’s trying to give us the best chance of succeeding,” Cas countered.
Their friends entered the room and threw a boy to the floor in front of them. His clothes were even more ragged than those of the people back in camp, his black hair was terribly dirty, and his eyes were sunken and hollow. Those eyes darted around the room now, not holding anyone’s gaze, before they landed on Jack and flew wide.
Thought he’d need a shove, but, really it just took the tiniest nudge. Took a few weeks to really kick

“I— What?” That was certainly not how she'd expected
Um. Okay.” Dean stands a little taller. “Ah—
Sam's smile softened. “Yeah, I know, Dean. You, too.”
Dean sighed. “Cas...” He left his bag to cross the room, dropping a hand onto Cas's shoulder. “Come on, we’re gonna find Mom and Jack. We’re gonna find Lucifer. We’re gonna stop whatever that other Michael is doing. But right now, we don't have anything to work off of. You just gotta hang in there for now, okay?”
“You gotta quit sayin’ shit like that, Cas.”
He stopped, shutting his eyes against her tone. “...Yeah?”
“Of course he does! You heard him, he said so himself out in the—”
"South," Sam blurted. "We're looking for someone, someone we lost."

Dean was at his side, checking him up and down, gripping his shoulder to hold him steady. “What happened?” he demanded.
After a long while of roaming in silence, Bris chanced to think that this might not be so bad, that she might actually get away with just going for a nice walk with Inas.

Of course Dean had jumped in. Dean was human. And Cas hadn't taken any precautions to stop him.

“So. Wheres to next?” Direl asked cheerfully.
Dean scrunched his brow. His eyes narrowed as they darted around the concrete in front of him.
“Right.” Sam raised his hands to take off the necklace. “Hah, wish we’d found this years ago, this is going to be so much easier than—” He stopped, his fingers still wrapped around the chain. “...I can’t take it off.”
“They was just leavin’, Ballo,” Inas answered.

to be heard over the bar.
“Oh, My child—” Fate rushed forward, her arms outstretched. Unseen by Bris, Castiel threw a wing in front of her, blocking Fate’s path, but she simply walked through it, and bent down to fully envelop Bris in a tight embrace.
“They’ve just been around for a long—” Sam started. “Oh. Cas, I didn’t mean—”
Dean managed to blink. “What?”
“...just not the right time for this, darlin’,” the older selkie was saying.
he shouted in Cas's face.
“Oh you fuckin’
No, he had to give Dean more credit than that. Dean was one of the best hunters out there, the other being Sam, of course. No, Dean had a reason. Cas just couldn't see it.
Cas looked up at him, one eye swollen shut and the other fruitlessly blinking against the blood running into it. He glanced down, saw the gouge in Dean’s shoulder, and raised a hand to it.
Cas yanked his shoulder from Crowley’s hand, moving a few steps away.
distracting. Then at some point, Bris began humming a tune, and Sam didn’t recognize it but it tugged at her lips, hinting at a smile, and that warmed Sam all on its own; he was just so grateful that after the kind of discussion they’d had last night, she was still able to hum and smile.
Rowena spread her hands in response, her red lips sliding up into a prompting grin.
Dean took a deep breath.

Dean sighed through his nose, long and low.
“Hey, could you help me over to the bed?” He purposefully swayed for effect. “M'not feelin' so great.”
Dean shook his head again. "No."
But Dean wasn’t hearing Crowley anymore, too busy just trying not to fall to his knees with sheer relief.
Sam said slowly. “Well, I think we’re safe in that department,” he assured Gabriel, “from what I’ve seen I don’t think Dean could ever hurt Cas. Not on purpose anyway. You’ve got nothing to worry about.” He stood from his chair and headed for the hallway.
So perhaps she could be forgiven if she was starting to feel a bit… salty. Here she was, practically runnin’ the place by herself, and who got to sit on that damned throne? Her son. Her listless, wonderful, awful, beautiful, lackadaisical son.
Bris held them back tightly, finally allowing her tears to slip into their jacket.
Yeah, that was good. Casual. Normal.
“‘The— The Divine Essence of an Angelic Child’,” read Sam.
It was at times like this, like when Sam could swear he heard an actual growl behind Bris’s bared teeth, that he was most forcibly reminded that his significant other wasn’t exactly one hundred percent human, and was in fact, perhaps, just a little bit dangerous.
"We're not doing this in an efficient way," said Cas.
Dean winced and picked up his beer again, “Don’t apologize, Cas. You didn’t do anything.”
He heard Cas shifting, the rustle of fabric deafening in Dean's ears as Cas approached him.
“Hey, you want your coat back or not?”
Her gaze fell to his chest, and if it was possible, her eyes softened even more. But she didn’t elaborate on what she saw.
“Damn,” Simon rolled back over, “I don’t know about you but I could get used to that.”

*I shouldn't have left,* was all Castiel said.
“What? No, he isn’t a—”
Dean glanced at his watch. “Motherfucker, you were only out for like half an hour, max.”

“Hey, lookit there! It’s Dean the Hunter!”
He gathered his thoughts again.
“Leaving as soon as we can, yeah.”

Dean turned back to Asmodeus. “I saw you die—”
“Thanks, Cas,” he said over his shoulder.

Bris stared for a few steps before she collected herself. “Aliens?” she tried, her voice high.
“It was… It was my Dad’s fault,” said Sam. “He got your father killed. On a hunt.”
But he couldn’t concentrate on not concentrating. Even his veneer of effort was tiring today. And people kept trying to
Mary tore herself from Bobby’s hold and ran to Jack, wrapping his arm over her shoulders and trying to pick him up by herself. There was a flurry of legs around them, and others joined in the effort. Together, they managed to get him back inside the warding, and inside a tent.
The group got themselves a table tucked in the corner of the main room and ordered up a round of drinks. After finally getting around to introducing themselves—
"Thought I told you to get some rest?"
“Hey, what’s with you?”
“Fighting alongside hellhounds makes my skin crawl,” Cas said, not catching what Dean was actually worried about.
Castiel walked. And he walked.
As Dean started gathering dishes to the sink, Cas, still at his place against the counter, watched him and said thoughtfully, “That was the most productive discussion we've ever had.”
Sam's monster had gotten up again and was still making a break for it. Dean took a step to follow—
Your spirit up above, oh, (ooh)
"Oh. I came to ask you something," said Cas, abandoning his coat-patting.
They did manage to get the Blood of a Holy Man, so that was good. And Fruit from the Tree of Life, very good.
He turned down a little dirt road that they had definitely been down before. The wide expanse of empty farm fields stretched around them for miles.

It’s obvious! It’s practically
Sam winces, maybe that was too much.
Sam was pulled from his admiration of Claire’s work by Direl’s elbow colliding with his ribs.
“How could you let Dean be—!”
“Fine. But he’d be alive. And so would Sam and so would Bris and so would the remaining vestiges of my little brothers and sisters. So I’m gonna send you on ahead, and you’re gonna open up the Cage, and you’re gonna wait there on your own, and this whole thing will be fixed. Michael can do this by himself, no one else has to get hurt.”
Sam’s face went sharply dark.
-And here is my evergreen request that if you liked this piece, please share it, or share the series. My only wish is that as many people can read this as possible.
Dean swiftly shut the door behind him and locked it.
Dean stuck his tongue out in thought. “Okay.”
but, boy, was she fantastic. Everything he could ever ask for in a second-in-command. And, yeah, okay, it certainly didn’t hurt that she tasted a lot better than any demon he’d ever made.
“I enjoy all kinds of music.” Cas tipped his head at Dean. “Someone is there, trying to aurally show me a piece of their soul, and I wish to listen.”
“Look, I’m tellin’ yeh, Direl, this one just ain't for us,” said Bris.
She hated that nightmare. It always ended the same: With that woman coming to the cage. Singling her out. Pulling her forward so those demons could drag her, kicking and screaming to the barn—
“Why am I still not—?”
Crowley moved in even closer, “Are you afraid they’ll find out about the
I’ve been through this already and I’m here to help you, lass. And all I ask for in return is for your help when the time comes.”
"Look, I'll go out and you can—"

The banks of the river were steeper here, the creek cutting through the sharp hillside to reach the river. It wasn’t a particularly large waterway, but they were able to swim up a short distance before it became too shallow. The group hauled out there and the manic action continued.
With the milkshakes poured, they joined Sam at the TV and hunkered down to watch. After arguing about the way-too-many drinking rules Dean wanted to make, Dean looked down at his glass. Empty. He checked Cas’s glass. Also empty.
Sam turned, horrified, back to the bodies.
“Yeah.
“The demon who runs this farm!” the necklace made Sam answer. He couldn’t even resist it right now.
“You already know,” Cas said, busy kissing every inch of Dean he could reach.
Bris jumped a foot off the table, whipping around to find Inas now seated next to her.
Crowley was pleased to see that Dean’s eyes could indeed be widened further.
The camera pans, and we see the back of another person now standing in front of Dean, having silently appeared. Dean looks up, and there’s worried anticipation on his face as he says, “...Hi, Jack.”
"Sam—!"
“Great, so they’re going to be impossible to find,” Dean huffed. Then he perked up again, “Actually, we might have something for this.”
“Really. I’ll do it.”
He minimized the movie and pulled up another file, an episode of Scooby-Doo.
He looked to Bris again.
what?”
He carefully avoided the conspicuous pile of ash in the middle of the floor and crossed the room, staring a bit at Gabriel as he came to stand by Bris. Sam made room for him in their little circle— foiling Cas yet again.
I was born, born ready,
This might be a good time to let you know, my dear friend and reader, that this is probably going to be a six Part series. Probably even longer than that, but this first major plot-arc is six Parts.
Short-sighted idolaters, all of them.”
Sam held up his hands.
“Alright then,” Dean said, a bit more brisk than he intended, and pulled himself from Sam's loosened grip. He hurried up the last of the stairs and out the front door.
He nodded solemnly. “I understand. And know that I will do everything I can to earn that forgiveness.”
Dean turned to him.
“We followed exactly what she said—”
The front door cracked open and they both quickly schooled themselves to an appropriate somberness. From behind the small opening, a petite white woman peeked up at them.
“You're a selkie of age, don't you remember a time when magic was a common thing?”
Sam twisted his answer. “I am now,” he said, absently rubbing at his ringing ears.
Jack turned and ran toward the edge of camp
The clock read midnight.
“Bris, I told you months ago, we didn't have anything. She died— I thought she died— before anything could really—”
No one would hear him anyway.
“You said you owe me one. I assume you meant a favor and so I'm going to use it now. For this.”
Fortunately— despite what the lack of snow and
Dean couldn't see for shit, but he could hear. In the darkening depths of the river, the water was churning with the movement of something— lots of somethings— moving away from him fast. A swarm of grindylows was taking Cas deeper into the river.
“Well, sure, with the boys!” She slipped back into Gaeilge,
“Well ya see, the thing is, Dean-o... you don’t really
*Damn it,* he grunted, and stood with it in his hand.
Castiel knew that he himself had done wrong, had done so very much wrong in all of his existence.
Dean!?”
Her laugh sent his stomach doing backflips, and he couldn't have stopped his beaming smile if he wanted to. He slipped his arms beneath her and sat up with her, pulling her up into his lap where he kissed her, long and deep.
what you think of witchcraft, boy? Is that what you think of
Crowley appeared in the throne room immediately. Dean jerked back from him, sliding his hand up Cas’s arm to hold him tighter.
“I don't see how drug abuse—”
“Alright. I got one. But…”
He smiled down at them, stepping forward to loom over them. “I should destroy you sorry sons of bitches
had barely faded from the speakers before Sam had already leapt out of the car. He slammed his door behind him, visibly flinched at it, and had already grabbed the box of ID's and turned toward the path when Dean caught up and grabbed him by the arm.
I’m getting a head-rush from all the shit in there and I don’t even understand
She stopped in front of Sam and dipped her fingers into it, picking up some of the rusty, glowing silt. She reached up to Sam’s face, he bent down a bit for her, and she swiped around his forehead, drawing something he didn’t recognize there. Then her fingers nudged his chin up, and she ran a line from there all the way down his throat to his collarbones.
Sam brought out some candles, one shaped like a three and one like a nine. Only two candles, he insisted, or else they’d all die of smoke inhalation. From how small the candles were, Cas made the assumption that it was meant to be a joke and didn’t correct him.
Dean tried for a charming smile that probably came out a little faltered.
She tensed against him. “It’s... I guess… It’s jus' you been so… secretive about it.”
, really— when Castiel looked up from his lap.
Whatever you think you know, you don’t, okay? You don’t.”
“A simple yes would have done,” Crowley waved him off.
... ye wouldn’t be a
advantage you can get.”
And he wobbled.
She found him. At the table. Just standing over a book.
She rubbed the bar of soap into her skin with more force than necessary. No. Inas had told her to be happy. So damn it all, she was gonna be happy. Fuck Purpose. Fuck Fate. She was with Sam now, she was free of all that and weren’t no one gonna drag her back in.
