Something inside of Cas wavers. They're standing close enough to rub noses. Dean's smell--worn leather and whiskey, smokey gunpowder, ivory soap--rushes into him with every breath and leaves behind an achy kind of desire that he can't fully identify.
"Don't." Dean tells him softly. He takes Castiel's face in his hands and holds it as if it's some precious artifact from a long-gone era, something to be cherished. Cas closes his eyes and soaks it in as much as he can, knowing that he may die before he ever gets another chance.
"Cas?" Dean squints at the harsh lights in the corridor and rubs the sleep out of his left eye with the heel of his hand. His messy hair and rumpled clothes suggest a sleep that was far from restful. Castiel wonders what he'd been dreaming about but decides not to ask.
“You’ll understand somed--”
"You think I’m fuckin scared of you?”
Dean's expression turns to one of confusion as he waits for some kind of explanation, but there isn't one. There's just a heavy silence wrapped around them like a straight jacket, stifling and skin-tight. Eventually, he asks, "Go where?"
There's panic in Dean's voice despite his valiant effort to keep it in check. Castiel's insides writhe at the sound of it in much the same way a snake charmer's cobra dances at the sound of his music. "You and Sam are to stay out of this," he says firmly, shoving his guilt aside for the moment. "This is not a debate. We're not taking a vote. You will not look for me, you will not prevent me from leaving, and you will not attempt to summon me back here. If you do, I'll shatter every single bone in your bodies and cast you both down into the pit so Lucifer and Michael can squabble over your souls for all eternity."
"If you're gunna threaten me, you might as well throw me in the pit right here and now because there is
but don't know much about, somebody they have to be on their guard around.
Cas stays silent, allowing the Hunter to connect the dots on his own. It doesn't take long. He looks up just in time to see the realization bloom across Dean's face like a poison flower. "...You're not coming back, are you? That's the kind of goodbye you mean."
Cas is fully aware of
This time, Dean is the one that makes a move, and he does it without hesitation. He tilts the angel's head up, claiming his lips with a kind of tenderness that Cas didn't know he was even capable of. All he really knows for sure is that this moment feels like everything he's ever needed. For a brief few seconds, he is no longer an angel of the Lord. There's no mission, no guilt, no internal conflict. There's just Dean and all the love Castiel feels for him.
to share this burden with somebody else. He knows that all he'd ever have to do is ask and Dean would be right there by his side to help carry the immense weight on his shoulders, but he also knows that it wouldn't be fair to do that. Dean is a force of nature, a natural-born warrior, but he's also a human and humans are fragile things, even the tough ones.
Dean steps closer and ducks his head to catch his gaze. Castiel avoids it at first, but not for long. Some kind of strange magnetism takes hold and he's suddenly powerless under those emerald green eyes and the challenge within them.
--but the words won't come. They never do. There are so many things he wants to tell him, so many things he knows he needs to say because he knows Dean needs to hear them.
“It’s not a matter of trying. It’s a matter of risk.”
"Still with me, buddy?" There's a ghost of a smile on Dean's face, but the concern in his voice easily overpowers it. “Earth to Cas? Hello?” He snaps his fingers a couple times to bring Cas out of his own head, and it more or less works. The angel hesitates a moment longer, then shakes his head like he's got half an etch-a-sketch for a brain and needs to erase the train of thought he's on.
, Cas thinks as he drops his gaze to the floor. He can't bear to look into the Hunter's eyes any longer.
Besides, Dean has had more than his fair share of burdens already.
if you wanted to. You just won’t
Leaving Dean Winchester is never an easy thing to do. Castiel has tried more times than he can count by now, for a multitude of different reasons, but he's never quite been able to make a clean break. He always ends up taking little pieces of Dean with him, no matter how desperately he wants to be the one to stitch them back together and make him whole. Dean's soul was threadbare from the start--that went without saying--but Cas has been tangled up in it for years now, watching it slowly unravel, and he's beginning to fear that there isn't much left of the man he loves.
on playing it cool, and he sees right through it.
Dean gives a bitter, hollow laugh. "
is an entirely different person--a long-lost doppelganger, somebody they know
"What's going on?" Dean asks. He's carefully studying Castiel's face, no doubt taking note of each micro-expression he finds.
the tough ones, in Castiel’s experience.
, huh? Either you're being stupid on purpose or you've completely forgotten that what
"Let us help you, Cas. We'll figure everything out together like we always have."
It takes him a while to work up the nerve to knock, but there's no turning back once he does.
But Castiel is already gone.
' far as the Winchesters were concerned. To them,
Cas shakes his head again, even though he senses something deep inside of himself that would give
“I have to go,” he repeats, “but I wanted to say goodbye first.”
“Don't you
"How the fuck am I supposed to do that?”
Cas doesn't answer. He could stand there trying to explain it until the end of time and Dean still wouldn't understand. They'd just be prolonging the inevitable, piling hurt on top of more hurt until they buried themselves alive.
And yet here he is, standing outside Dean's bedroom and wondering how he could ever possibly tell him that he's leaving again.
"I...have to go."
, a voice hisses in the angel’s head, low and venomous. Cas isn't sure where it came from or who it belongs to, but instinct tells him that it's best to just not acknowledge it at all.
“I’m not sure,” Cas admits, “but you need to find a way.”
“No, I want you to
--do you understand me?--no motherfucking
“I know you do,” he tells him, fighting valiantly to maintain his own composure as he dries a few more of Dean’s tears, “And I wish I could.”
"What time is it, man?” He groans, “This couldn't wait till tomorrow or something?"
“Bullshit!” It comes out almost like a sob. “That’s complete fucking bullshit, and
“We could ask Jack.”
“What? Let me see,” Dean says, craning his neck around.
“You’ve done enough.”
“Yes, will Hell’s consent. Rowena was enthusiastic when I proposed the idea. She said she liked having her, ‘boy toys’ at her disposal,” Jack says with air quotes.
Dean wonders how long it will take to get to Heaven this time. As each second ticks on he waits for that tunnel of light, ready to sprint. At this point he’ll settle for no goodbye - He’s given enough already to last a thousand lifetimes. He just wants the pain to stop.
Sam connects the dots.
Dean clears his throat.
“‘Early stage’ is loosely defined. The sooner the blood is administered the better,” Sam continues.
“Whatever you tell him to do, he does the opposite, right?”
“I’ll text you his number,” Charlie says. “In the meantime, I gotta get going.”
It lasts for a moment, and then it’s ripped from him. Blaring lights, frantic voices. The whole world stings. It’s shocking and abrasive and loud. He can’t stand it. Then all at once, it retracts. He is soothed once again, and he is floating. It comes in bursts - existence interrupting his peace. Chaos and calm. He can’t tell if what he sees is reality or a dream. A voice asks him something. He agrees. White lights. Faces hovering over him. Faces he doesn’t recognize.
“No,” Dean says.
“This isn’t destiny, it’s bigger than that,” Jessica says grimly. “I don’t know how it’s even possible that you’re alive right now.”
“Tell me your idea,” Cas demands.
“Know what?” Sam demands.
“The file. It’s corrupted.”
“For now,” Jason says grimly. “Whatever this is, you have to handle it.”
“Dean help,” he cries out. The nothing aren’t letting up.
“I’m f-” There’s arguing on her end of the call.
“It’s too late for that,” Cas says, marching forward.
“Where can we find them?” Sam asks.
Jason looks at Dean like he’s stupid.
“Careful, it’s hot,” Sam says slyly. Dean crinkles his eyes in annoyance. He has a ringing in his ear.
“Will do,” Sam replies. He watches them leave.
“Say, Jack,” Sam says. “Do you think you could do something about…” He gestures at Dean.
Jason takes a moment to consider this. He looks between Sam and Dean. He turns to look at his house. He bows his head, takes a sharp inhale, and lets it out slowly.
Dean swallows hard.
“Dean, watch out.” says a gravelly voice above him. Dean looks up to see Cas swinging his angel knife at something behind Dean. Dean ducks and rolls out of the way, but not before he’s showered with - blood? Something black.
“Woah woah woah,” Sam puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Relax, we don’t have anywhere to be.”
“I think we can do something about that.”
“They think we’re partners in crime, on the run from the law,” Dean says with a chuckle.
“Forces greater than you or me.”
“Please call me Jason. Come on in, Dean.”
“It’s a computer,” Jessica starts.
“I’m just saying, we have God in our corner here. Maybe he could do something about Cas, or about your legs.”
Jack doesn’t join them. He doesn’t need to eat, so he stands off to the side, inspecting the objects on the shelves. Cas notices him alone. He places his plate on the table, and goes over to him.
“What are you doing?” Sam asks.
“Sweet.”
“Yeah he’s fine - what else did Patience see?”
“Huh… I guess you’re right,” Dean says, tapping the steering wheel. “Husbands in crime.”
“You mean Jack,” Cas says.
“Right.” Dean doesn’t look at him.
“You too, Sammy.”
“Of course he is. Did you think I wouldn’t save my own father?” Jack says.
“But it wasn’t a fight,” Rachel says softly. “Middle of the night, the guy showed up - just standing out there in the street. I thought it was gonna be really bad, and I think Beleth thought so too. But the guy just… snapped his fingers, and Beleth… Angela… She just went limp. She collapsed. Then before I knew it, the guy was gone.”
When they arrive at the bunker, Dean immediately takes a seat.
Dean flinches, turning his head and scrunching up his face. But he’s okay. Olivia looks down at the gun in disbelief, and Dean snatches it out of her grasp.
“I know it’s not ideal, but it could be a lot worse. The doctor says you got lucky.”
“Did you-?”
“What the hell happened here?” Sam asks.
It’s dusk. Sam and Dean sit in the Impala, eating burgers wrapped in greasy paper, gazing out the window at the house.
“It’s too dangerous to see him, given what we’re about to do,” Cas says.
Dean jolts awake. HIs back is sore. He pushes himself up and unscrews a pill bottle, then shakes two into his palm and tosses them in his mouth. He does the same for the second bottle, and washes them down with a swig of stale beer. His mouth is dry, and he’s still wearing his clothes from the night before. He pushes himself off of the bed and into his wheelchair.
“What do you want,” Cas asks her.
Sam huffs. He keeps his mouth shut the whole rest of the ride.
“Really?” Dean takes a seat, and blows gingerly on his drink.
“Not great,” Dean says.
“My pleasure. Good luck, you two,” she says.
“That doesn’t sound like a happy ending to me,” Dean says in disbelief. “I get killed by a random vampire? After everything, that’s what does it?”
“No, he’s alive,” replies Sam.
“There’s something in my back. It feels like it’s right through me.” Like his entire insides are carved out. With every beat of his heart, his flesh contracts around the spike - torturous pulses that drain the life from his body. Sam touches the wound. When his hand withdraws, it’s covered in a glistening garnet red.
“Okay, now what?” Dean shouts. He slaps an empty with his bleeding hand, and it recoils. “Oh, sweet.” With the knife, Dean makes a gash through his knuckles and punches through the nothings. Each one falls back sloshes into a puddle before disintegrating.
If Dean’s heart dropped before, this time it plummets. The color drains from his face. Sam straightens his back.
The pine tree next to Dean lurches. It splinters mid-trunk. Dean doesn’t have time to react. The top half of the tree comes swinging down above Dean’s head, and its spindly tip crashes into a tree on the other side of the path. Their branches hook together. The pine tree is caught mid-fall, forming an arch over the path.
“Jack! Boy, I’m glad to see you,” Dean exclaims.
Elsewhere, Castiel stands in a cornfield. The sky is bright blue above him, scattered with fluffy clouds. He crouches, and hovers his outstretched hand over the ground. A warm light emanates from his palm. Beneath it, youthful green leaves sprout from the dirt. Cas smiles. He slowly raises his hand, and a stalk grows, higher, until Cas is standing with his arm raised up straight and the stalk towering over him.
“What?” Dean mouths, pointing to his ear. “I can’t hear you.”
They are struck by a wave, but this time Dean embraces Cas. The wave covers the both of them, dragging them out to sea. When their heads reemerge, there isn’t a shoreline in sight. A pink horizon surrounds them, providing the illusion of an edge to an endless sea.
“I’m fine,” he says, glaring at Olivia. “Fucking psychos.”
Eileen is already on it. With a single motion of her arm, the bowl comes crashing onto the floor, and she stomps out the flame. It is left a sizzling black pile. Dean gasps, clutching his throat. He relaxes. The pain is gone. He snorts, then spits out a wad of blood and phlegm.
“... It’s not?”
“You’ve been very helpful, thank you,” Sam says.
“That he sacrificed himself for you,” Charlie says. “That he’s in Heaven now and he won’t talk to you.”
“Werewolf,” Dean replies.
“Your BFF,” Katie replies. “The angel, Castiel.”
“That’s the difference between you and me,” Jason says. “I know who my enemies are.”
“Well, these kids couldn’t ask for better,” Dean says.
“Thanks, Donna,” Dean says.
“That’d be amazing,” Sam says.
“I’ve done it before, too. It’s great, there’s no lag,” Jack continues. “But this one time, when I opened the movie download, the screen went black. I had to reboot the computer, and when I did, the file looked the way it does now.”
“Shut up, Kyle,” Dylan says.
“You coming?” Dean says, gripping the wheel. Sam gets in the car, and they drive away.
After some work, the room is covered in sigils.
He goes to his dresser, and opens the top drawer. Inside is a khaki jacket, with a hand print seared into the shoulder. Dean runs his own hand across it. He slots his hands between the folds and carefully lifts it up and out of the drawer. He buries his face in it and yells. The sound is muffled by the fabric. Dean leans forward, breathing heavily into the jacket, scrunching it up between his fists. It still smells singed. With a slow exhale, Dean pulls the jacket away from his face. He neatly refolds it, smoothing out the wrinkles, and returns it to the dresser. He closes the drawer.
“Everything I said, I meant. But that wasn’t fair to put on you. Not like that. I know that. I’m sorry. And everything before,” Cas continues. Another step. “I don’t want-”
“It’s funny. Admin kinda knows about it - we’re not allowed to, but they let it slide because it’s tradition,” Dylan says. “Angela wouldn’t tell me why she wanted to do it too. I just figured the girls wanted in on the fun. But then I hear that, like, 5 chickens went missing. Then I hear about bigger animals - pigs and stuff. We got a ton of slack for that. I knew it was her, but I didn’t want to rat her out.”
“Cas…” Dean whispers to the empty space before him. He grips the armrests of his chair and pushes himself onto his feet.
“Finally, a real case!” Dean exclaims, slamming his fist down on the table. He takes a victorious swig off coffee and spit-takes.
“I mean, I like research. I’m actually writing a book about hunting with my girlfriend.”
Dean is standing on a beach on a cloudy day. He’s wearing a green and blue Hawaiian shirt. Seagulls squawk overhead. White sand shifts and crunches between his toes, and the salty air stings his eyes. He smiles. How long has it been since he’s visited the beach? Too cold to swim, sure, but pleasant nonetheless. Before him, the ocean is expansive, and awesome in its original meaning. It’s waves approach, then retreat in a steady but unforgiving rhythm. Dean breaths in time with them (or they breath in time with him). The ocean doesn’t care if he lives or dies. Dean remembers, for once, what it’s like to feel calm.
They make the rest of the journey in silence.
“I want you to get better. Look, it’s not my fault a Winchester fell in my lap. I’m just minding my own business.”
Dean makes a show of pressing the button to hang up. Cas awkwardly lowers the phone from his ear.
“You gave up being an angel to stay with us?”
Dean grips his knife and slices through his palm. Blood drips.
“Who else,” Eileen says with a cheeky grin.
“Cas is right,” Sam says. “If the universe is hell-bent on killing you, I don’t want to find out how far it’ll go.”
Dean looks around at them. He feels happy, but not in the way that he used to in these situations. He doesn’t think about death. He doesn’t think about loss. He doesn’t even think about what he needs to do next. He just exists in the moment. He’s got a pizza slice in hand, he’s surrounded by his family, and he is happy.
Dean’s ears are ringing. He can just barely make out the sound of Sam’s voice shouting on the phone. Sam yells something that Dean can’t make out. It’s muffled. Dean doesn’t remember it being so dark in here. His vision fills with static. It loses color. He fades.
“Is your husband home?” Dean asks.
“You did it,” Charlie says.
“I’m gonna pick up some lunch. You in the mood for anything in particular?” Sam asks.
“No, I’ll be right up,” Dean says, hanging up the phone. He grabs a coat, and Miracle’s leash, and heads to the elevator.
“Sure, we kicked him off his ivory tower,” Dean adds. “Do you want an autograph or something?”
“You mean the computer virus?” Jack laughs.
“Jack,” Cas says. “I think it’s time to initiate the second part of our plan.”
“I’m not really a professor.”
Dean lifts the crowbar above his head and crashes it down against the box. It makes a thunderous bang. Sam cringes at the noise.
“Another beer, please,” Cas says to her.
“What took you so long?”
“Y’know, I overheard the guys at work talking about you,” Dean says.
“Maintenance at Harvelle’s Roadhouse, construction worker,” Sam reads. “Car repair… proficiency in guns?”
“I’m reluctant to do so. That would also still mean ending your story, in a way. It could kill you,” Jack replies. “But perhaps there is another way..."
“Hello Dean,” Cas says with a weary grin.
“Yeah, that’s about right.”
Dean can’t tell if he’s imagining it, but Cas looks different somehow. Handsome. It could be a certain flush to his skin that makes him look fervently alive. It could be the way his lips stay parted after he speaks, or the way the darting saccades of his clear blue eyes betray his air of steady determination. Or it could be that, for the first time, Dean is allowing himself to really look at him.
“Dean!” Sam calls out, rushing over to help him.
“What do you think?” Dean asks. Jason considers his position. Castiel is stronger than him. It’s not likely that he’ll win this fight.
“Not a word,” Charlie says, shaking her head and putting her hands up in a gesture of innocence. She mimes zipping her mouth shut and tossing the key over her shoulder.
“What are these?” Sam asks, pointing at the funko pops.
“Cas told me,” Dean continues. “That he feels… or felt… a certain way. Before he left.”
“That’s - okay. Fine,” Sam concedes. There’s no way Dean will let up, so there’s no point in arguing. Dean wiggles his head in contentment.
“Yeah, you guys are pretty creepy.”
Katie rolls her eyes. She lowers the gun to the floor.
“You’re gonna have to buff this out,” Roger says, knocking on a scratch on the side of the car.
“Just… what now? Y’know? No more demons, no more angels. We could keep hunting like the good old days, but -”
“What do you mean ‘was’?” Sam asks.
“I can handle it.”
“Beleth didn’t run off,” Katie says. “Someone was after him. He needed to become more powerful to fight him, and we helped.”
“Me neither,” Dean replies. He hides a smirk. They get into the car.
“It’s just… Cas, he…” Dean starts, but he hesitates. Should he tell her? If anyone would understand, it’d be her.
“I expect you to cut it out!”
“Right! Of course,” Sam says.
“I guess I was wrong,” he says.
“You told him that?”
“We broke up like a week before it happened,” Dylan says.
“You guys have questions?” Sam says to the group.
“Sleeping like an angel, right?” Charlie adds.
“You guys, I thought. But if not you, I have no idea. Like I said, very few people have access to this room.”
“Can’t end the story, end the medium,” Cas says.
“Is Jack here?” Dean asks. Before Sam has a chance to respond, Dean shoves him out of his way and marches way inside. The amulet glows brighter. Dean makes his way onto the balcony. He clasps the railing and looks down.
“What? No way. I should be the one to talk to the sorority. Besides, college chicks love me.”
“‘Sup,” the young man greets.
Sam enters the house. It’s humid and smells like body spray. He squeezes past a bicycle in the hallway as the young man leads him into the living room, where two other boys are hunched over on a ragged brown couch playing video games, accompanied by an upbeat soundtrack. When Sam walks in, the boy on the right slaps the other on the shoulder with the back of his hand.
“Okay,” Sam says.
“Well,” Jessica says. “In the original version of events, you give a long, beautiful speech about family, and die. And it’s super sad, but you go to Heaven, so it’s fine. And then, Sam, you get to live the rest of your life. You get married -”
“Excuse me, Mr. Winchester?” a lanky boy chimes in.
“Well sure, Sam invited me,” she says innocently.
Moments later, they’re in the car.
“Adda boy!” Dean cheers.
“He’s fine, he’s fine. Tell me about this vision - what did you see?”
“Hey Jason, how’s it hanging,” Dean greets.
“Anyway, I have a case in Manhattan,” Sam continues. “I’m thinking of heading out tomorrow.”
“Dean? What’s going on,” Sam says, wiping the sleep from his eyes. “It’s 5 in the morning.”
“Nothing, I just thought - I thought maybe I would feel something here, but I don’t. It just feels like any old house.”
Jack gazes melancholically at the cat-themed motivational poster on the wall.
“Exactly,” she says.
“No, I suppose I don’t,” Sam says.
“Thank you,” Cas says. Dean takes a sip. Cas chugs his.
They find a footpath on the other side of the road and follow it. Golden leaves litter the ground, damp from the recent rain. They are surrounded by towering evergreens. The air is crisp, and smells like dirt. Charlie swings her arms as she walks. Dean looks up. The tips of the trees form a halo, framing the steel-grey sky.
“Love him back?”
“Hello again,” Cas greets.
“Olivia, put the gun down,” Sam says, creeping towards her. Blood runs down her leg, seeping through the fabric of her jeans and pooling onto the floor.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Dean says in disbelief.
“Yeah, heroes, like you guys,” Jack says fondly.
“There has to be another way, Cas,” Dean says. “Me and Sam, we can help.”
“Jack?” Dean says.
Castiel takes a deep breath. He puts his hands on the stem once again, his palm glowing, and an ear of corn grows, fitting itself into his grip. He plucks it and peels back a section of husk. The kernels are plump and golden.
“Thanks, I could tell you enjoyed it,” Sam replies. He stacks up his notes.
They make their way up the stairs.
“It’s just, I have a husband. And you’re my patient! It wouldn’t -”
“The animal research department has had this problem for years - chickens getting stolen for initiation ceremonies - hazing. I don’t know why they decided to go bigger this time around. Boys will be boys, I guess,” she says with a shrug.
Dean takes a seat at the head of the table, next to Cas. He notices that Sam is no longer in the room with them.
“What happened after that?” Dean says gruffly.
Sam puts a hand out to block him. Cas swats Sam’s hand away and shoves him aside. Sam goes flying backwards. He lands a hedge.
“Exactly,” Dean replies. “I’m pretty sure he thinks that because he has more responsibilities now, that he’s all grown up. But he’s still just a kid.”
“I think that’s right,” Jodie says. “But did you and Dean know about this, right?”
After they finish their burgers, they stay for another drink. Then they hit the road, chatting and laughing along the way. Dean had forgotten, throughout all the drama and heartache and fear, that Cas is actually fun to hang out with. Seeing Cas now, loose and ruddy-cheeked from the beer, beaming at Dean as he makes some dumb joke about a movie Cas has never heard of, Dean can’t help but love him.
“Hey Dean,” She says in that sweet voice of hers.
“Dean. Dean, are you -” Sam asks.
It’s a few days later. Dean is alone in the bunker, once again, as Sam works a case a few states over. Dean is bored out of his mind. He’s been putting effort into his exercises at home, and they’ve been doing something, but not enough. He can stand for a few seconds at a time, but even then, he has to hold onto something. Looking for cases for Sam has helped pass the time, but it feels like online shopping with an empty debit card.
“Jack, wait,” Cas calls out.
The drive to a 24-hour diner nearby. A full moon shines overhead from behind thin, fleecy clouds. Other cars are sparse. Dean tries to watch the road. He tries. He looks over at Cas, who is staring at him with those piercing blue eyes. Cas doesn’t take his eyes off him. Dean tries to suppress a smile, but Cas can see this, which makes Cas smile. Dean furrows his brow, looking back at the road. This worries Cas, as though by smiling he broke some unspoken rule. That is, until Dean reaches out and places a hand on his thigh. Dean says nothing. He drives.
“Oh, he’s an angel!” Sam exclaims.
Sam comes home with a bruise on his cheek, a swollen nose, and a body that aches. Miracle greets him as he puts his stuff down. Following the noise of a TV, he finds Charlie and Dean on the couch together in the “Dean Cave”, watching Lord of the Rings. Charlie’s arms are wrapped around Dean, but she leaps up when she sees Sam.
“How, Sammy? How. Tell me, please. Because last I checked, our get-out-of-jail-free card was dead.”
“That’s good,” Jason replies. “Here, lie down.”
“It’s all about reaction time, girls,” Jodie explains. “Donna, you playing?”
“It seems that way,” Cas says flatly. The brothers’ faces light up, and together they tackle Cas in a bear-hug. The three of them fall to the floor.
“Pray,” Dean finished.
“As a leader, I have to mend the errors of my predecessor,” Jack explains. “It was through Chuck’s neglect that demons came to roam the Earth in such high numbers. There’s a difference between non-intervention and compliance. Castiel taught me this.”
“Castiel,” Jason says. “I have a life here on Earth. I have a family.”
“What?” Sam huffs, and looks around.
She beams.
“It was late, about 4am I think. I heard James crying in the other room so I went to check. And there was just, some guy there. Standing over the crib,” Hannah says. Sam and Dean exchange grim looks.
“Patience had a vision - she saw Dean get killed.”
“No. He pissed on the kitchen floor though,” Dean replies.
“I mean you and Cas. Living together, being together...”
“I have to finish what I’ve started. Of this much, I’m certain,” Cas replies, looking off into the distance.
“You know, Dean, you don’t need to -” Sam starts. Dean raises the volume and drowns out his voice.
“It all just happened so fast, what was I supposed to do?” Charlie groans in frustration.
“Yeah, finally.”
“We should get you to bed,” Dean says, as Cas continues to kiss him, humming in contentment. “You’re human now, and humans need to sleep.”
“It wasn’t that many times,” Sam protests.
“I’m a mechanic.”
“So Cas is the one who’s been rounding up demons,” Sam says. Jack nods.
“What the hell are you doing, coming to my home?” Jason hisses at them.
“It’s very engaging,” Cas adds. Sam laughs.
“Wait until he shows up, I guess,” Sam replies.
“Because he told you to,” she says. Sam swallows, glancing nervously at Dean.
“Weird thing is,” the officer leans closer. “The guy didn’t even take anything, and he didn’t leave a scratch on her or the baby. He was just there, in the nursery, and poof! Gone.”
“You know, you’re not house-bound. You can take him for walks.”
“Don’t do this,” Dean says sternly. “You’re not a killer.”
“I think I get what’s going on,” Sam says.
“I think it’s the other way around.”
“No, we really don’t,” Sam says. Katie rolls her eyes.
“Who’s this cutie?” she asks.
“Research, yeah, but not for a hunt.”
Dean takes a bite.
“Maybe they did before you were 40,” Sam retorts. Dean scoffs, offended.
“Dean are you suggesting - “ Sam starts.
“It’s good to see you.”
“Do you think you’ll be able to find her?” Dylan asks. Sam is half-way out the door.
“Because it’s his first class, and you want to surprise him. And you will.”
“This isn’t a sexual proposition,” Cas clarifies. Dean is both disappointed and relieved. “I’m weak. And I’m afraid. I don’t want to be alone right now.”
“I don’t cheat!” Patience protests. “You have a bad poker face.”
“I’m broken,” Dean blurts out.
Nothing. The room is empty.
“Do you know where I can find them?” Sam asks.
As this is happening, Dean fidgets. Sam notices this, but none of the girls do. The frayed ends of the knot hover just above his hands. He stretches out his fingers, straining. He pinches a strand between his index and middle finger, and pulls it down, his fingers climbing up the knot like a spider. He hooks his thumb through the knot and pulls it loose.
There is yelling from inside, and stomping. The door is swung open by a young man - blonde, wearing a grey t-shirt and sweatpants. He leans on the doorframe.
“This object, this room - it’s old. Only a few beings have access to it. It doesn’t always look like this. Sometimes it’s a notebook, sometimes it’s in a park, but invariably, everything that happens - everything important, at least - is written down, here,” Jessica explains.
Dean considers this point as Jason moves onto rotating his ankles. He’s conflicted. On one hand, Jack’s willingness to meddle in some affairs and not others is worrisome. Things playing out a certain way because God orchestrates it feels eerily similar to God sitting back and letting one thing lead to the next. On the other hand, it’s good that Jack is doing what he wants, not what Dean wants. John never gave Dean that luxury and, looking back, Dean may have been better off if he had taken it. Given the choice, maybe Dean actually would have become a mechanic.
“If that story wants Dean to die,” Sam says, pointing at the computer. “And he keeps avoiding death, maybe whatever corrupted the file original file is still changing things.”
“CAS, COOL IT,” Dean yells. Cas pays him no mind.
Dean freezes.
“As are you,” Cas replies.
“Cas, what do we do?” Dean calls out in distress.
“Hey, sorry about that,” Jodie says. “So what Patience saw in her vision already happened?”
“I haven’t,” Sam says, taken aback. “Have you?”
“So, you don’t control what is written?” Cas asks.
“Jason,” comes Cas’ gravelly voice. “You have to come with - Sam? Dean? What are you doing here?”
“I’ve written a resume before,” Sam says. “I’m helping.”
“When Dean was dying, you didn’t go for help,” she says.
“You could’ve warned me,” Dean says.
“You see, Cas has a family, too,” Dean says. “Us.”
“Jack, what are you doing here?” Sam asks.
Dean slides the box across the table. The rest of the group dig in. Jodie passes out paper plates, which most of the kids forgo, including Dean. Sam blots the top of the pizza with a napkin. Cas sees him do this and picks up a napkin to copy him, but Dean stops him - placing a hand on his arm and wagging his finger. Claire gets sauce on her face, which Kaia laughs at, so Claire smears sauce on her face in retribution. The other girls laugh, at which Kaia holds up her slice of pizza threateningly. Donna and Jodie don’t mind them - they, along with Eileen, are caught up in a story Charlie tells, about a shifter who transformed to look like Sarah Michelle Gellar.
“You are?” Cas asks.
A few students have gathered around Sam, holding their notebooks to their chest.
"Hello Cas! It's good to see you. Please, sit," Jack says, gesturing his open palm towards the red beanbag across from him. Cas reluctantly lowers himself into the chair. His knees come up to his chest.
“At least we know it’s on our side,” Sam says.
“What the hell? What’s wrong with my legs?” Dean looks frantically between the doctor and Sam. Doctor Khan’s expression is not reassuring.
“Sam, let me ask you something,” Dean says, leaning on the table. “Do you like hunting?”
“Okay - You said closing the doors to Heaven would kill the angels left on Earth, right? There’s no way Jason could stay on Earth as an angel.”
“Show time,” Dean says, opening the car door.
“Are you kidding? You’re really gonna leave me like this?” Dean roars. His hands grip the arms of his wheelchair. Jack notices the beer bottles, and senses that this was a bad time to drop in.
“Yeah, about that, do you think you could give me a hand?”
“A book,” Dean repeats, raising his eyebrows.
“Yeah, big baseball fan over here,” Dean says. She raises her eyebrows, and moves on.
“Yeah, really good,” Dean says, nodding as he chews.
“You mean how God wanted to kill us?” Sam asks
“The chickens?”
“Well, there was a break-in in a house not too far from here, a few days ago. Poor woman must be spooked. Hannah Williams. Between you and me, she’s a little nuts. She’s the one who started all of this ghost business.”
“No, with Cas. Tell him not to go through with this.”
“Well, I actually thought you could, y’know,” Sam starts.
“If Cas is smiting demons, we should be helping him,” Dean says.
It’s faint, and Dean can barely make it out, but Cas’ skin is glowing.
Jack rubs his hands across his face with a groan.
“Oh, oh I know,” Dean hisses. He glances towards the door where Hannah left. “It’s Cas. It’s gotta be. He heard my prayers and now he’s trying to get through. Why here, well, who knows.”
And then it does. It feels like slipping into a pleasant dream. It’s smooth, like drifting through warm water. It’s the sun, radiating on every patch of skin that had once been buried in the cold, wet desolation. It feels like being safe. It feels like being loved.
“You’re human.”
They tie up the loose ends. They get in contact with Hannah and tell her her house is safe. They tell the local authorities that they arrested the man who broke in. All is well.
“She played me like a damn fiddle.”
Dean grabs Rachel by the arm. He pulls her down, disarming her and putting the knife to her neck. Katie aims for Sam’s feet. A bang. She misses - the bullet ricochets off the ground. Sam looks down, expecting to see blood. It hits Olivia in the shin. She screams.
“Okay, but c’mon, it’s me.”
“Yeah, okay. Say ‘hi’ to Eliene for me,” Dean says.
“Yeah, people have been seeing, well, what sounds like ghosts. People appearing out of thin air. Get this - down in Lawrence.”
“Yeah that’s awful,” Sam adds.
“So you support Dean?” Charlie asks slowly.
Miracle bounds towards them and pounces on Dean, panting and letting his tongue loll out of his mouth. Dean mutters an affectionate greeting and squeezes Miracle’s ears. For a brief moment, he feels better. He cracks a small smile, but it quickly fades. He pushes Miracle off of him.
“Sure!” says Eileen.
Cas is hovering over sam. The nothing has encased him, up to his face. It’s beginning to cover his mouth, and he’s struggling to breath.
“No - this thing writes about me, too,” Jack says. “But exactly what is written does depend on who the protagonist is, which I do have control over.”
“What the hell…”
“And why are my legs still bust?” Dean says, lifting his leg up an impressive amount for “bust.” Sam thinks for a moment, and the realization hits him.
“I don’t think he’s gonna give you a choice,” Dean says.
Sam sets down his mug and decides to keep looking. He marches to Dean’s room and knocks on the door. Castiel answers. He’s wearing a robe, and his hair is wet.
Dean turns to leave.
“You think?”
“You look like shit,” Charlie replies. “What happened?”
“Yeah. He’s rebellious too.”
“We’ll be here,” Cas says.
But eventually he is rolled out. Outside, the stars twinkle, and cool air brushes against Dean’s face. It smells like wood burning, and stings his nose. A smattering of lamp posts illuminate the cracked gravel of the parking lot. Sam helps Dean into the passenger seat of the impala - manhandled again. Dean doesn’t want help, but he gets it. Soon they’re on the road.
“Woah, so I can’t die? Awesome,” Dean says
“That sounds very good, thank you Sam,” Cas says. He and Dean sit down.
“Demons were only the first half of the plan,” Cas replies gruffly.
“Thank you.” He swings the crowbar again, this time missing and hitting the concrete floor with a crack. Dust flies up. Sam coughs, covering his mouth with his sleeve.
“Hey,” Dean grunts.
“I have a son,” Dean replies. “A teenager.”
“Tired,” Jack replies. “My work isn’t easy. But this makes it worthwhile.”
“Get dressed, I’ll explain on the way.”
“I did,” Sam replies. As if on cue, Eileen emerges from the hallway lugging a huge, leather-bound book. Sam rushes over to help her.
“I don’t understand,” Cas says.
Realizing that he’s unharmed, Dean moves out from under the tree, towards Charlie.
Dean kneels to the floor, slowly. He glances at Sam, who has the demeanor of a man minding his business at a public urinal. He clasps his hands together.
“That sounds wonderful,” Jason says with a weak smile. Castiel sighs, and puts the blade back in his sleeve.
“We know that this whole ‘physical therapy’ thing is a front,” Dean says.
“How are you feeling?” Sam asks.
“We’re working on the chapter on witches now,” Eileen says. “And we stumbled upon a spell that might help heal you.”
“Sam?” comes Patience’s voice.
“Hey,” he says. “Are you Dean Winchester?”
Dean parks the impala in front of a bar – or what used to be a bar. The windows are boarded up. Graffiti covers these boards. Most of it is generic, name tags and drawings and the like, but towards the right, just below eye level, is a small, unicursal hexagram.
“It pays the bills,” Jason replies. “Look, I’ve got kids! I’ve got mouths to feed. And it helps that this is something I’m pretty good at.”
“Yeah it’s in the kitchen,” Sam says, glancing at the plate set out for Dean. Dean gives him a thumbs up as he turns and leaves. Sam follows.
“I am not your enemy,” Cas says.
“You look great,” Dean says.
“Hello my preciousss,” Charlie hisses. She laughs and pulls him into a bear hug.
“Okay. Fine,” Sam concedes. “I’ll meet you at the sorority house afterwards. But if I don’t show up -”
“I’m doing just fine, Sammy.” Dean lifts the crowbar above his head and swings down, hard. It hits the box square in the middle and bends into a right angle. Dean inspects the dent, then tosses the crowbar over his shoulder.
“I bet,” Charlie says. “I mean, the place is huge.”
They head out the next morning. It’s a long drive to Manhattan, but not worse than anything they’re used to. They pass low-top houses and empty fields - miles of dull yellow and green, scattered with the odd patch of anemic trees. It’s sunny at first, but clouds creep in overhead as the hours pass. Telephone wires up soar and dip. Dean traces them with his eyeline. There’s not much to keep his mind occupied, save for the music (Fleetwood Mac. Sam’s choice.) They pass a scrapyard, the odd stray tire, old trucks, and rusty warehouses. A few grazing cattle are a highlight of the trip. Eventually the streets become shorter - more residential, with more trees. Young people stroll along the sidewalks.
Dean’s face drops in realization.
They pull up in front of the main University building. Sam tosses Dean one of two blazers. They put them on, covertly fitting knives, guns, and stakes in every pocket or seam. They go up the ramp and flash their badges at a student who lets them in. Sam saunters up to the receptionist at the front desk - a fat woman with curly blonde hair and thick glasses. Dean makes sure to stay slightly ahead of Sam.
“Who’s writing it?” Sam asks.
At the table, the others finish their pizza. The girls return to their game of poker. They beg Eileen to join them, but Eileen knows better.
There’s an auto-shop in Lebanon, Kansas. It’s just off of a main road, so it’s easy to get to. It sits across from a church, wedged between a faded laundromat and the small, cream and brown house of an elderly widow. Strips of green grass frame the parking lot - a vase expanse, coal black from recent repaving and divided with stark white lines, where a 1967 Chevy Impala glistens in the sunlight. The shop itself has wide broad windows all across the front that expose a modest waiting room, lined with leather chairs and stacks of chunky tires. A bell jingles whenever anyone enters. Led Zeppelin plays softly on the overhead speakers. They’re connected by a jumble of wires to a cassette player behind the front desk – Apparently, the owner is very particular about their music.
“He’s in Heaven, safe. He’s taken on a creative project for the moment - I’m making some changes up there, and Castiel is one of the few angels who really understands humans,” Jack says. “Plus, he’s so much better to work with than the other angels. I don’t know how many you’ve met but they’re all kinda boring.”
“Can I come in?”
“I’m telling you - I looked him up on the web - no sign of him, nothing. Roger, it’s like he didn’t exist before this year.”
“That’s not why we do it,” Sam replies.
“It’s just a flesh wound,” Dean says with a weak grin. He glances around at the machinery and tubing attached to him. He tries to push himself up, and instantly regrets it.
“Well, in the past month, the animals going missing got bigger - pigs, horses, and then -
“Yeah, why do I feel like crap about that whole thing,” replies Dean.
It’s been two weeks since the scuffle at the barn. They’re in the bathroom, where Dean is sitting on the toilet seat as Sam rummages through the first aid kit. It’s time to pull out Dean’s stitches, and they’re not risking going back to the same hospital in case their insurance card fails and gets them in trouble. Besides, they’ve done this before - sewing up cuts with dental floss and whisky and picking them back out later. The first time Dean did it was Sam tripped and split his knee open while John was out. He had seen his dad do it on himself before, so Dean grabbed a needle and got to work, shushing Sam and telling him it would be okay. When John walked through the door that night, Dean’s blood was ice. John saw Sam’s knee, but didn’t mention it. Maybe that was his way of saying he was proud?
“What the fuck, Patience,” Claire yells, from a distance. “Awesome. Anyway, how ya doing?”
“I see that.”
She scribbles on a post-it and extends it to Sam. Dean snatches it.
Dean knocks firmly. A young woman opens the door, meekly. She’s blonde, with a slim face, and for a second, Dean’s heart lurches.  But he composes himself.
Charlie squints at him in suspicion.
It’s coming from one of the storage rooms. Sam opens the door a crack and peaks in. Dean is sitting there, hitting something on the ground with a crowbar.
“...cure for lycanthropy and vampirism. It must be taken from the specific werewolf or vampire who turned the human, and it has to be administered in the early stages of infection.”
They arrive back at the bunker, where Dean sees the table is covered with stacks of books. He checks them out- they’re all spellbooks, or books about witches. He turns to Sam.
“Well, here I am, still kicking.”
“SAM,” Sam hears in the distance. It’s faint, muffled, but undeniably Dean’s voice. Sam follows it to a doorway. Stairs to the basement. As he rounds the corner, he is met by the barrel of a gun, held by a girl - The same blonde girl who passed them by earlier.
“Look,” Jason says. “I have a family. I have kids. Just because Castiel is friends with the new God doesn’t mean he can boss me around.”
“No, listen. You have to hear it,” Dean grunts. He grabs Cas’ face in his hands, looks him in the eyes. “I love you, Cas.” The corner of Cas’ mouth quivers. He cups Dean’s cheek in his palm.
Sam runs over to give Jack a hug, then hesitates, wiping the flour from his shirt. Jack wraps his arms around his torso and squeezes him.
“I do.”
“I’m not a little kid anymore, Dean.”
“That’s what I thought,” Sam says. “And, I mean, you saw how it’s gone with me hunting without you. If you’re not doing it, I don’t want to either.”
“Hey Dean,” Sam scoffs. “How’s physical therapy going?”
Jack appears.
“Everything in my life. Everything I love, you’re trying to take away from me,” Jason says, his eyes locked on Castiel. “Well I know what you love. I should show you how that feels.”
“Oh my god - is Dean -?”
“Then shush for two seconds!”
“Oh, yeah. We’re a regular Bert and Ernie,” Dean says.
“Dean I think,” Sam mutters.
“Well you can have a slice when we’re done,” Sam says.
“Missionary?”
“Friggin awesome,” Dean replies. He straightens his blazer, sniffs, and makes his way towards the door.
“Nevermind.”
“Today is the one-year anniversary of your near-death experience,” Cas says.
“Hello Dean!” Jack calls out.
“I’m trying to do my job, but
“Well done!” Sam says.
“It shouldn’t hurt but if it does, let me know.”
“Look, you said you wanted to keep me out of danger, right?” Dean argues.
Dean stares grimly into the distance, where Miracle is leaving an impressive turd. Before Dean can protest, Charlie envelops him in another hug.
“Well it was excellent,” Cas says.
“Maybe someone else did.”
“Have you been listening to his prayers?”
“Hello?”
“Stevie, right? She’s a hunter.”
“Woah woah woah, paper? What are we?” Dean says.
“Es stultior asino. Latine non est magicae. Lingua est. Sunt consecutiones quod attinet ad stultitiam. Ego dabo tibi dolor!”
“Yeah I - Hey!” Dean says, crossing his arms. “It’ll be good this time.”
“No, this is news to me.”
“I’ll be back soon as I can,” Charlie says. “You can’t get rid of me this easily.”
“Oh? What did they say?”
“How so?” Sam asks.
Cas nods.
As this happens, there is an ominous crackle above them. Dean pays it no mind as he rolls forward towards Charlie and Miracle, but Charlie pauses to look up. There comes another crackle, louder this time, and the sound of shaking leaves.
“Thank you,” Sam says.
“Where am I in all of this?” Cas asks. Jessica shrugs.
“No way. I asked him to, he said no.”
“Oh, I don’t know... I’m about as slow as molasses in January.”
Sam and Dean walk into the house. Their house. It’s furnished differently, bits have been redone, but Dean can feel it. The last place where he felt safe, felt protected. It feels empty now.
“Help yourself,” Jodie says.
“Go ahead,” Dean says.
Sam is finishing up his breakfast in the library - pancakes. Across from him, a place is set: fork, knife, plate covered with another plate. Dean enters the room, and Sam stands. He tries to help him to the table, but Dean shoos him away.
“Have you been the one trying to kill Dean?” Sam asks.
“Why are they being so weird?” Dean mutters to Cas.
Dean kneels on a hilltop. Wisps of lush grass quiver between his outstretched fingertips, soft like hair. The sky above is an undulating lilac-grey mass, heaving like a living creature, while the air is thick and oppressive. Rain sprays Dean’s face. The droplets cling to his lashes and magnify the freckles on his nose. Fog hugs the city below like a blanket. Dull pulses of flashing lights and the distant beeping of cars shows signs of life.
“I am proficient!”
“Dude, we’re alone in the woods. He told you he loves you? What did you say?”
“I was close!” Jack says.
“Do you have any ideas?”
“Think about it,” he says. Miracle trots into the room. “You didn’t take Miracle out, did you?”
“Hi guys,” she signs. She’s wide-eyed in excitement. “Be quiet and follow me. Sam is teaching.”
“I don’t care about the other angels. I care about Cas. I can’t have him gone forever.” Sam raises his eyebrows.
“Well did you?” Dean asks. Cas smiles, and extends a closed fist. He turns it upwards, and opens it. Inside is a vial, full of grace.
“Uh, Dean?” Sam says, lifting the shirt up higher.
“That bad, huh,” Dean says. The waitress comes over with their burgers.
“Well, why are you here then?” Jason asks as Sam approaches.
“I know, Dean.”
“It was you and Dean - you were in a barn, it looked like, and this man, or monster I guess - he was wearing a mask that looked like a skull - he pushed Dean against something and it stabbed him, through the back.”
“No, I couldn’t get a good look at his face. He just vanished as soon as he turned around.”
“And she wouldn’t put out,” interjects the boy to his left.
“Who ya texting Sammy?” Dean breaks the silence.
“Yo Kyle,” the boy calls out to someone inside the house. “The feds are here for you.”
“Nah, man. I don’t swing that way. Or, I mean, I guess I do but…” Dean’s voice trails off. Jason raises his eyebrows at him. “But that’s. No. That’s not why I’m here.”
“Is this all… confidential?” Dylan asks nervously.
“Y’know, I taught him everything he knows,” Dean tells her.
“Do you take a lot of plot-important craps, Dean?” Jessica replies.
“Those were college students. Normal people. They didn’t know what they were doing. Imagine if it had been a demon or a vampire -”
“How are you handling that, by the way? Cas being gone.”
“Castiel is dead,” Dean says.
They do the pleasantries. She says the family can stay at her sister’s. They’re half out the door.
“Sam, is Dean dead?” It’s Claire’s voice this time.
“As if you don’t know,” Katie says.
“Good?” Sam asks.
“Waiting,” Dean says.
The metal door opens and Sam and Eileen come out, chatting and blissfully unaware. They see the body on the floor. Their faces drop.
The car ride back to the bunker is quiet. Sam tries to make small talk, ask Cas about his experience, but it falls flat. Sam sits shot-gun, Cas in the back seat. Dean doesn’t look at Cas. He can’t. He keeps trying to - glancing back - but each time his stomach lurches. At one point, he takes a peak in the rearview mirror, and he meets Cas’ gaze. It’s somber, almost pleading. Cas breaks eye contact first. Time passes, open road. No music.
“Do you need -” Sam starts.
“You’re injured, Dean,” Sam replies.
“He loves you!?” Charlie exclaims, grinning.
Dean pushes the hair out of Cas’ face, and firmly kisses his lips. When they part, Cas looks up at Dean with half-lidded eyes and a dopey grin. Dean swallows hard. He drags Cas to the hallway.
“Well, this thing works like a normal computer,” he says. “So a while back I decided to watch a movie.”
“It had been going really well,” Dylan explains. “She - we had disagreements. She said she was Christian and -”
“Dean…” Sam starts. Dean’s eyes water. He sniffles, clenches his jaw, and looks away.
“What happened to Eileen? I thought you were meeting her.”
“I don’t know, I didn’t know what to say.”
“But what? And why?”
“Sam told me about Cas,” she says. Dean’s heart skips a beat.
“Next time?”
Jessica takes a seat in the chair, and trails her manicured finger across the laptop trackpad. She scrolls up - there’s a description of their breakfast, just moments earlier, only when it gets to the point when Dean choked on his eggs, the letters jumble and fractals of color streak across the page, obscuring the text.
“No, it can’t be Jack,” Dean says. “He’s not like Chuck. He wouldn’t mess around with this type of thing,”
Birds tweet above them. A squirrel runs past.
“Dean?”
The three of them shuffle into the back row. They sit. Dean flips the desk down, and leans his arm on it. He glances over the shoulder of the frizzy-haired student next to him. She’s scribbling on a notepad.
“I have been working hard. Heaven has been long overdue for some changes.”
“I see.”
“Hey - no chick-flick moments, right?” Sam says.
Dean leads Cas. They round the corner into an alley, sidestepping an overflowing garbage can, and come to a dented metal door. Dean knocks rhythmically. There’s a clunk, and the door creaks open. Eileen pops her head out.
“Dean, watch out!” Charlie cries.
“So you expect me to apologize for what? Not dying?” Dean says.
“You won’t hurt her.”
“You lied,” Cas says.
“Sort of, but… textbook level. All of the knowledge of The Men of Letters, plus everything we’ve learned ourselves,” Sam says. ”I figured all these resources, our knowledge - It could be useful for others.”
“Sam and I are working on something together, actually. All of this -” Eileen gestures at the table “- is research for a book.”
“Okay, yeah, okay,” Dean says sympathetically. “There’s room for you here.”
“I guess at a certain point I stopped thinking that was possible,” Sam replies. “But you’re not wrong.”
“Of course. To stay with you.”
“I know, I just thought we should have a chat,” Dean says, gesturing with his head. “C’mon.”
“Dude, gross!” Sam exclaims.
“Well I’m heading out early,” Dean says, raising an eyebrow in suspicion. “Roger, you’ll make sure the place doesn’t burn to the ground?”
“Okay, so you said you could make it so we’re not the protagonists anymore, right? Maybe that would work?” Dean suggests.
With a thud, the vampire falls to the floor.
“Yeah, I guess they are.”
“The one a year ago,” Donna chimes in.
“He sounded upset that you have been choosing not to visit him.”
“You’ll be fine,” Jodie says. “Get your butt over here.”
“I don’t need a babysitter,” Dean says. Sam sighs.
“No.” Dean hugs the laptop against his chest.
“Maybe Angela is gone for good,” she squeaks. “But Beleth is strong. He can come back. Maybe all it’ll take is one more sacrifice.”
“HEY-” Dean starts. Sam stammers, but he realizes there’s no point. He rolls his eyes and hands it back to Dean.
“Okay, great. Now what,” says Katie.
Cas stands in the middle of the street. He looks exhausted. Hair is plastered to his face. Dean approaches him.
“No - I mean the nothing. They guard the empty. When they found out I was trying to escape, they followed me here.” Cas ducks and slices the nothing through the middle. Dean dodges a blow but gets smacked in the face with something wet, like a belly flop. He gets knocked back, but lunges forward and slices off an extremity.
“She’s a reaper,” Sam says.
There it is.
“Nope,” Dean says, drumming on the table. He checks the clock.
“Oh.”
Sam takes a seat next to Dean. He sets the laptop down on the table, opens the laptop back up, and starts clicking and dragging and typing.
“So, you’re fully human now, is that right?” Sam asks, scraping the eggs onto their plates. He places the plates in front of them.
“Let me do it,” Dean says, extending his arm.
Dean looks around. For the first time, this prayer truly feels like talking to nothing. How many times has he done this now, with no results? Cas isn’t listening. Maybe now is a good time to give up hope on that front. He pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs, bowing his head again.
And it’s over. God is dead, the Earth is safe. And yet every morning, Sam and Dean wake up. They check the news. They check the blogs. They call their contacts. Nothing. A few cases pop up here and there, but they’re always people. The monsters - they don’t make a peep.
With that, Sam leaves. As soon as the door closes, he bolts across the street. He bangs on the door of the sorority house. No answer. He tries the doorknob. A click. The door creeps open. Sam marches through, leaving it wide open behind him.
Sam clenches his jaw, trying to maintain his poker face. His chest tightens. He made the wrong choice of house. Sam takes a deep breath, then nods and stands up.
“You’re sure,” Castiel checks. Jason nods, propping himself up on his elbows.
“What do you mean?”
"Have the couple meet with the ex-wife. Inform them of their options, and let them discuss. Should they decide to stay together, offer them counselling. If not, add the vestigial wife to the dating registry," Castiel says.
A woman in a white coat walks in.
Sam shrugs. In the other room, there’s a bang, followed by the sound of Eileen cheering.
"Now, we leave,” Sam replies.
“To keep up appearances,” Jack says. “In reality, I am God. I am omniscient and omnipresent and unimaginably powerful. But here, with you guys, I’m just… Jack.”
“You’ll see,” Sam says.
“Excuse me, ma’am,” Dean says. “Agent Singer and Agent Kripke, FBI.” They flash their badges. The officer squints at the badges, then squints back at them.
Cas’ hands glow a buzzing red. The corncob explodes. They are showered in popcorn. Cas looks around, embarrassed, and composes himself.
“I’m telling you, we don’t know anything about this,” Sam says. “Even if he could bring her back, we don’t know where he is.”
Dean saunters over, wiping black grease onto the towel draped over his shoulder. His hair is neat, and the creases under his eyes are from age, not stress. He wears a navy, short-sleeve button-down with the auto-stop logo, over a white t-shirt. A black cord hangs around his neck, at the end of which are two charms: a brass horned head, and a glass vial filled with a glimmering pearl-white substance.
“And we are partners, in a way,” Cas adds.
“I’m sorry,” Jack says.
“Hello! I didn’t expect to see you guys here,” Jack says.
“Now, untie Sam,” Dean demands.
Back at the bunker, things are tense. Night turns into day turns into night, and Dean refuses to say a word to Sam. It’s not Sam being overbearing that bothers Dean. What bothers him is the fact that he’s right. On a good day hunting is dangerous; On a bad day it kills you. But what if it does? That was always the plan, anyway. Going out in a blaze of glory. Or maybe it would have been better if he had bled out on that spike.
“We didn’t kill her,” squeaks Rachel through snotty tears. “It was her idea to summon him. Do you think we wanted this? She was our friend.”
“Is this a resume?” Sam asks.
Sam rolls his eyes and places the gun in her outstretched hand. She pockets it. Sam puts his hands in the air in defeat. The girl grabs him by the back of the neck, holding the gun to his head, and ushers him down the stairs, slamming the door behind them.
Cas’ fear and panic grows to such an intensity that it comes out the other side as calm determination - His eyes glow. His hands glow. His body glows. There’s a gentle wind.
“What part of shut the fuck up don’t you understand?” Katie cries. “Rachel - show him what’s what.” Dean’s eyes widen and he clenches his jaw shut tight. Sam struggles against his restraints.
“Well, you see how that goes and let me know,” Dean says. He pops a tape in the tape player and plays it too loudly.
It’s evening. The sky is red. Sam and Dean linger by the car, across the street from the physical therapy office, watching as the last patients of the day leave. The parking lot becomes sparse as one-by-one they drive away. Dean trains his binoculars on the building. He can see people inside, but he can’t see Jason. Maybe it’s his day off?
“What things?”
“Goodbye, Sam,” Cas says with less certainty. Sam nods, and makes a thin-lipped half-smile.
“Don’t worry about it, kid,” Dean says, ruffling Jack’s hair. “Sam, you planned this?”
Katie makes a show of pulling out the gun that she had taken from Sam, and putting it on the floor as well.
“I don’t buy it,” Dean says.
“Patience. Hi.”
“Really?” Dean says, trying not to get hopeful.
It’s Thursday. Sam and Dean are in a waiting room, sitting on scratchy red chairs. A fast food advertisement plays on the television. Dean flips through a trashy celebrity magazine. Sam bounces his leg, glancing between Dean, the door, and the TV.
“I don’t know. What I do know is that it’s accurate. Or it was, until…” she trails off. “Look at this.”
“Do you not see that this isn't feasible? I know you want to hunt, but you’re in no condition to be putting yourself in danger like that.”
“A mechanic! So you’re big on cars.”
“You did it!” Eileen exclaims. “I guess practicing 20 times last night was worth it.”
“Dean…”
“Somehow I don’t believe you,” Katie says, lowering the gun to point it at his feet. “But I know how to get the information I need.”
“Great stuff,” Dean says.
“I didn’t want to say. I was scared.”
“That was close. You’re really lucky.”
“I’ve been worse.”
“It kept me up all night,” Eileen mutters to Cas.
“Howdy Sammy,” Dean croaks. The pain in his back is dull now, and he feels sleepy. It’s the kind of grogginess that one gets after sleeping in on a winter morning. Sam sighs in relief, and cracks a half-smile.
“Who else has access to this room?” Cas asks.
“Hey!” Sam says.
"Cas, have you ever seen a lion chase a zebra?" Jack asks, leaning forward and pressing his fingertips together.
“Dean.”
“It doesn’t sound like it,” Sam says. He stands up to get a look at Dean’s computer screen, at which Dean slams the laptop shut.
“What?” Dean barks over his shoulder. He’s already halfway out the door.
“Cas, I’m God,” Jack says. “I don’t make mistakes.”
“To who?” Sam interrupts.
They diverge paths - Sam to the left, Dean to the right. Sam approaches the fraternity’s door, but waits to ring the bell. He turns and watches Dean, rolling up to the sorority house. Half-obscured by the spindly branches of a tree, the door opens, but Sam can’t see by who. Some words are exchanged, and Dean disappears into the house. Sam turns back around, and rings the bell.
“Hey Jack,” Dean says. “How’s it hanging? I know you’re probably really busy… y’know, being God and all. Sam and I just… miss you! It wouldn’t kill you to call every once in a while - Okay fuck this.” Dean slaps his hands down on his knees.
“It’s been a year since you were liberated from your narrative confines,” Jack explains.
Sam glances at Dean. Dean is staring out the window, arms crossed. Reflected in his eyes are the white streaks of streetlights, zooming past.
Cas pauses to think.
“She played both of us,” Cas says grimly.
“Patience, that already happened.”
“Yeah, ‘67,” Dean replies. “What do you drive?”
“Sorry, I think we got the wrong -” Sam starts.
“Yeah, I’m sure,” she says sarcastically, not looking up from her notes.
There’s a click.
“We had to bury her,” Olivia says.
“Dean,” Sam says, slapping his shoulder. Jason exits the building.
“I might,” Sam replies. “It’s late. Why are you still awake?”
They sit together, huddled on the couch. Dean passes Sam the popcorn, but pulls it back quickly to take a handful for himself and shove it in his mouth. Sam scoffs at him and gently takes the bowl, watching Dean’s indulgent, puffed-cheek chewing. Dean is happy, for the first time in a while. The thought of Cas, the sting that comes with it, is mellowed. A kernel of popcorn gets stuck in Dean’s teeth.
, Castiel?" His voice is a little louder now, a little more forceful. Dean almost never says his full name like that and it sounds all wrong coming from his lips. He's always just been '
“Cas, don't be stupid. Please don't be that fuckin' stupid, man. You've..you've got us, remember? You don't have to—I can—”
He's seen Dean do this over and over, mostly when talking to witnesses. Over time, it just became a force of habit—one Castiel is fairly certain he doesn't even realize that he does. anymore. Doesn't make his stare any less uncomfortable, though.
"I'll watch over you for as long as I can " he whispers.
"Well?" The Hunter asks in a low voice, his mouth twitching into a grim, humorless smile. "What's it gunna be? You gonna make a move or not?"
call just another Monday at the office."
Or that it's for good this time.
talk to me like I’m a child,” Dean growls. Another tear escapes and makes its way down his face. He barely notices.
“What exactly am I supposed to say, then? Do you want me to lie to you? Do you want me to tell you everything you want to hear even though we both know it’s meaningless?”
"I am spectacularly aware of that, yes. However, the answer is no, and it will
means in this context, but that isn't the kind of move he makes. He surges forward and kisses him instead, half-expecting Dean to recoil or shove him off. He doesn't, but Cas has no idea what to make of the way the Hunter looks at him when he pulls back. "I shouldn't have done that," he murmurs, taking a few cautious steps backward. "I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking, I didn't--"
