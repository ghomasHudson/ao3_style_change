Cas looked at me with soft eyes and I blushed when I realised how that sounded. The last truth Cas spoke to me was that he was in love with me.
Anguish, fear, rage, I couldn’t even vanquish them in myself, never mind anyone else.
After hanging up with Sam, I return to talk with Helen and Jackie while waiting for the Sheriff to finish getting his statement.
“Siobhan, the information Crowley gave you, what was it?” Dean asked
Alt Dean looks up too, “Of course, Dean please join us”
I can see Michael asking me about going to the lake.
I reach out to shake his hand saying, “I thought that was his name”
“Works for me” Dean laughed and pulled her in for a bear hug.
I can’t wait any longer, “Jackie, can we………………….”
On that note, we sit down to eat the pizza, making plans for every outcome.
“You get to Michael and I’ll see to the other boys” my voice slurs a bit with tiredness as Cas and I hurry down the stairs.
I know that you are probably pretty mad at me right now. I’m pretty mad at myself too. For everything.
“Cas” Sam said “I think you need to talk to Jack. He’s really hurting over Siobhan leaving. He really loves her.”
We returned to the waiting area in silence. Jack and I were holding hands, giving each other moral support.
Cas looks after the boys while I clean the kitchen. Once I have everything loaded into the dishwasher, I wipe down counters, the table and sweep the floor.
I turned to Cas and said “Wow, I’m batting 1000 here, aren’t I?”
Scrubbing my face, I smile wearily at her, “Thanks Sarah”.
After that we take a turn on everything though I rain-checked on the Ferris Wheel to the delight of Sam who teases me mercilessly.
The former angel turned, and when his eyes landed on the wet sheets, he flushed an even deeper red.
Now it was Dean’s turn to be surprised. Had it really been two months already? Well, seven weeks at least. He hadn’t realized so much time had passed.
“How did..? But you- How did you...?”
“She ran away when she turned seventeen, got herself emancipated, and hasn’t spoken to her family since. She’s doing great now, though. Last time I saw her she was an executive at a place that designs furniture, and she sells her artwork on the side.”
His fist connect with the strange man's jaw in a loud, wonderful crack. He was please to see the surprise and pain flash across his features. Refusing to let up, and trying to instill fear in his prey, Dean followed him where ever he swayed, continuing to deliver painful hits that caused resounding crunches and cracks, as well as grunts of pain. Despite that fact that Dean was crazed with bloodlust from the mark, he could sense a supernatural power similar to his own in this man, an angel, he realized, and why he didn't fight back was confusing, and infuriating.
Despite the teasing, Dean felt the last bit of tension leaving his body. He and Castiel weren’t sick or cursed or weird. This might be the most normal thing to happen to the two of them.
“Damn it, Cas, stop crying or I won't be able to.” Dean laugh out.
Castiel could tell that Dean was crying, he heard it in the blond's voice, but he only held his hunter tighter. Tears clouded the angel's eyes as well.
"Hello, Dean." He said as he stood in the doorway.
“I don’t want to have sex with you.”
Sam nodded and thanked him before going back and sitting down across from his brother and the angel.
Cas hummed to let Dean know he heard him, but his hands were moving down again.
“Alright. Alright, I got this,” he told Cas. “I’ll wash these and get you fresh ones while you shower. Just leave the robe outside the bathroom and I’ll grab it on my way.”
He had known that Sam wasn't repulsed or anything like that by him and Cas, but now he knew just how much his brother accepted them for it. Even though Dean and Cas could take care of themselves, it did mean a lot to him that Sam had stood up for them so quickly and violently. He smiled.
/“This ain't a song for the broken hearted! A silent prayer for the faith departed. And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd, you're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud!”/
“Whatever.” Sam interrupted. “No way hoe-th is a word.”
“What is this stuff?”
Dean had made some selfish choices in his life, but he would never ask Castiel to give up his home and his grace just because Dean didn’t want to lose his best friend. He’d had nothing but time and chances to tell Cas how he felt about him, and maybe try for something more, but he’d feared losing what they had. He’d convinced himself having Cas around was good enough. That he could settle for loving the angel from afar. But faced with the reality of losing Castiel forever, Dean had felt hollow and cold inside.
“Dean,” Castiel asked after a few minutes of silence.
He was looking tired, so Dean gestured for him to climb into the unintentional nest he’d made. Once Cas was settled, Dean sat at the foot of the bed.
“Yes!” Dean says, maybe a little more eagerly than he’d intended. “Yeah, I do. It makes me feel, y’know, close to you.”
"Okay." He rasped out. Clearing his throat, he tried again. "Okay, Cas." He nodded.
“It basically just means someone who’s not attracted to anyone. Sexually, at least. Some asexuals still feel
Sam gently pushed the door open and peered inside. He saw Dean flopped on the couch, a dejected look on his face, flask in his hand.
He pulled Dean under the spray with him, pulling him close until they were pressed together from chest to knee. Cas tucked his nose into Dean’s neck, right over his mating gland, and breathed in deeply.
to change his sexuality. That he loves and is happy with Dean just as he is.
Cas shook his head.
“Alright, look. I know you don't like talking when something is wrong,”
“No! No, not in that way,” Dean says quickly. “I- Look, Cas, I thought it would be different with you. I thought if I just kept trying, things would get better. By the time I realized they wouldn’t, I didn’t want to mess things up.”
“When I walked out of that river, I didn't remember a thing. Who I was, what I had done, nothing. Not even you.”
Dean’s tried not to think about Maggie since that day because he doesn’t want to think too deeply about what happened. But now, he wants to be honest. With Castiel and with himself.
“Yeah, if him and Cas were together..." Sam trailed off, he knew how it felt to lose someone you love like that. Had Dean been in love with the angel? It would explain a lot, he was acting very similar to how Sam had been after Jessica died. Sam needed to talk to his brother, whether or not Dean wanted to.
was enough for him.
On the day Cas had picked to fall, it had surprised Dean to learn the process was boring. Two angels he didn’t think he’d ever met, whose names he wasn’t able to pronounce, had shown up to help. Apparently, it was more of a ritual than he’d thought, and far nicer than when Metatron had cut out Castiel’s grace. They had needed some of Castiel’s blood, but they had used grace to acquire it. About a vial’s worth appeared in the old stone bowl they’d brought, mixing with other substances Dean didn’t recognize.
Dean was shaking his head before Castiel was done talking.
Dean could tell Sam was becoming a little exasperated with Dean’s paranoia. In a brotherly, good-natured, ‘you’re-an-idiot’ sort of way. He was maybe a couple of minutes away from rolling his eyes and calling Castiel himself.
“Sam? Sam! Come on, let's get this over with.”
Now Sam was even more curious. Dean had finally admitted that there was something wrong, and whether or not he'd been evasive, that was progress. Sam wanted to push his brother for more info, but the truth was, if Dean didn't want to talk, he wasn't going to talk.
“We’re gonna want wet wipes too. Maybe paper towels. Uh, I think that’s it, other than condoms, obviously.”
“I don’t know, Cas...”
"I almost killed you. I almost killed Cas." Dean said, mostly to himself, sounding terrified at the prospect that the blade had made him lose control like that, forget everything except the need to kill. Sam squeezed his brother's shoulder to steady and calm him.
Dean shrugs again. “Wasn’t planning on it. If you’re hungry, we got your disgusting raisin cinnamon bagels from the store yesterday.”
, just... strong. I could smell you as soon as I was out of the garage.”
It was rare the Winchester took any time off. Mostly, his bosses would just flat out refuse to let him work some days, telling him he needed a break. Bobby was famous for that. He owned a junk yard, and as often as Dean was allowed to, he worked there, gutting cars out, salvaging anything useable for Bobby to sell.
“Another panic attack?”
“You think he needs a doctor or something?” Dean asked when he realized it was 3 in the afternoon and Cas was still in his room.
Dean nodded.
“Trust me, I will.”
“Cas, if you have to convince yourself you want something, you probably don’t want it. If you don’t want to have sex, then we won’t have sex.”
Castiel doesn’t answer immediately, but Dean doesn’t panic. He knows that Cas’s hesitation is only because he wants to find the right words, not because he’s unsure of his answer.
"What do you care?"
Castiel continued to rub firm but gentle circles over that spot. At the same time, he settled Dean’s dick on his tongue and
Sam was pissed. Some of that was because of what the angel had done to him, made him remember Hell and start hallucinating about Lucifer, but mostly it was for what Castiel had done to Dean. He had lied to him, betrayed him, he even threatened to kill him at one point. How could anyone do that to someone they love?
Man, he needed Charlie to come to visit soon. He’d take a road trip with Sam and Cas to see her, but she moved around more than they did. And unlike them, she didn’t have a home base.
Cas nodded.
They had just finished up a job in the “most physic town in America”, and all they wanted was to leave. Stuff like this was just too... normalized here. It was weird, working a job in a town of believers. They'd hardly had to lie at all. It was unnerving to say the least. Deception and fraud were hardwired into them by years of posing as various employees. Everything from carny sweepers and local journalists to Homeland Security and the FBI were par for the course for the Winchesters. Rolling into a town were they could practically announce their real job just felt wrong.  They saw some weird things on their job, but this much weird in one town was just...off putting. It gave the brothers the creeps. It just wasn't normal.
Sam frowned again.
A pained look replaces the frustrated one on Castiel’s face, but he doesn’t interrupt.
Dean squeezed Cas's hand gently, knowing his fallen angel could feel it. He wanted to tell Cas to stop talking like that, that they would find a way to help him. But he didn't, because there wasn't. There was no way to weasel out of this one. No angel would help Cas, not after everything, and no demon would deal. Dean knew. He'd tried.
A tear slipped down Castiel’s cheek and soaked into the pillow, but his smile never wavered. He nodded and pulled Dean into a kiss. It was clumsy and a little off-center because they were laying down, but Dean didn’t care. It was more perfect than anything he’d imagined over the years.
Michael stares at Cas for a moment and then he moves towards him and places his hand on his cheek. Cas stays perfectly still as Michael seems to study him.
Sam and Eileen have a similar reaction to mine when they see the lake and the surrounding scenery.
I took both of our cocks in my hand, the sensation of them side by side had us both groaning.
After all the crap that we have endured and got through, the sheer number of times I had lost Cas, buried him, mourned him and this is where we end up. I don’t know if my brain can understand it.
Arael pours her essence into the woman’s body. She can feel every muscle, ligament, blood vessel, every organ as she settles herself in. The feel of her vessel's heartbeat fascinates her.
SIOBHAN
With what felt like superhuman effort I manged to open my eyes and stared up into a pair of beautiful blue eyes and a pair of beautiful green eyes. My boys.
Maybe it wouldn’t have worked out and he would have lost his best friend, so he said nothing.
I jerk my head to Cas at that, “Cas, what are we going to do about the kids. If he got to Jimmy, he’s already scouted the place; he knows how important they are to us. We can’t leave them and yet……………………… Damn it, Cas. Everything I touch turns to fucking ash. And Jimmy is paying……………………….”
Donna pats the hand that holds her, “It’s ok” before looking back at Dean and Sam.
Castiel asked “How do you feel?”
Dean came back into the room after hanging up with Jody.
CASTIEL
They were initially coloured a forest green, but Dean changed them to blue.
He came back with a delivery docket and said, “Looks like it came from Dodge City.”
I followed Rowena to the kitchen, sneaking glances at her every couple of steps.
“I don’t how to thank you for doing this for me, Dean. You too Cas. I know what I’m asking isn’t easy”.
Smiling into his face, I ask “Yes Cas”.
Too frantic to do anything fancy, I make my way in between his legs and take his cock in my mouth down to the base, before sucking back to the top. Its sloppy and messy, and probably not the best I could do, but Cas doesn’t seem to care. I know he just needs to forget about this horrible day. I cup his balls and squeeze lightly eliciting a groaned “Dean please”.
“Together” I whispered
“Siobhan, I have already had this out with him. I think I was convincing” Cas said in that innocent way he does
He doesn’t want to be touched. Got it.
I saw Cas narrow his eyes at her, but he followed me to the kitchen. There we found Sam and Jack with Siobhan sitting at the table.
It's a sweaty, sandy, slightly sunburned but happy group on the journey home. Everyone is eating ice cream cones that will hold us until we have dinner.
When he joins me, he reaches his hand around my neck and pulls me close to him, leaning his forehead against mine. Staring into my eyes, he says “This is a wonderful idea, Dean, the boys are so excited”
“Dean, how is Cas, really, how’s he doing? “Sam asked
Laughing I turn to greet Eileen, pulling her in for a hug before I pick her up and swing her around. I can hear the boys laughing at her squeals.
We leave the room together and climb the stairs to our bedroom.
He wanted both of them again.
Joseph won the contest of the film choice with Despicable Me. The movie had us all howling with laughter (and more than a few tears from Sam) and was just what we needed to end the day. After it was over, there was one more surprise and it was from Michael.
Interrupting Alt Dean, I said, “Yeah I’m sure it’s one of those you had to be there situations, so again, what can I do for you”
“This better bloody work” she said out loud to the empty room.
Dean cups Castiel's face and edges his tongue into his mouth, their kisses getting heated again when Dean feels Castiel’s hands on his bare ass.
Suddenly his face appears above me
“Siobhan, I meant what I said about how I felt about you. I didn’t lie. But when we lost you in the Empty, Dean and I, well, we comforted each other and well, it turns out that Dean loves me the way I have always loved him, but that didn’t negate my feelings for you.
She muttered the last part to herself, and Dean frowned.
Before he finished his sentence, the hunter spun on his heal and took off running. Sam only paused a moment, looking between the man and a rapidly disappearing Dean. It only took him a moment to start chasing after his brother, leaving a very confused old man standing in his doorway.
the pancakes. You know you’re just gonna put more fruit all over them when they’re done, anyway.”
The bar was a little more upper class than the ones he could usually afford. Smooth, black wooden flooring and a flat black counter top was highlighted by hanging lights with silver shades and deep red, fake leather covering the stools and booth benches. Despite it's upscale look, it still had that beer, peanuts and sweat stench to it, like most of the bars he went to did. Dean didn't mind. It was almost comforting, in a way. Kinda like cheap motels. If you've seen one, you've see 'em all. It gave him a sense of familiarity when he moved around all the time.
“I think I’d like that. Will you join me?”
But now, those two days were over. Dean had to work the next day around noon, so he had to leave in the morning. And he wasn't sure when they would get this chance again.
Dean gulped, not sure where this was going. He was actually quite proud that when he spoke next his voice wasn't as shaky as he felt.
Thankfully, Bobby chose that moment to enter the room. He strode in, shot gun in hand and started rifling through his makeshift desk. He continued to do so as he spoke, periodically looking behind him at the angel.
Against his chest, Castiel shudders through another breath, but he doesn’t cry.
“It's Enochian.” Cas supplied.
“All you need to know that this might not be common, but it’s totally healthy. Nothing is wrong with your alpha friend, or his omega,” Charlie reassured.
"It didn't work out. So, I took a souvenir."
“I... I know omegas usually spend their heats having sex with their mates...”
“He passed out about an hour ago. You should wait until morning to talk to him.”
“Right, and that’s still a hard no from you?”
Cas squeezed his eyes shut, trying to stop his own tears, even as he felt himself cling to Dean more.
He doesn’t know what he’s asking for. He hates how distant they are, and he wants to go back to how things were before.
Dean sat back down and listened until he thought Sam was gone, then he stopped trying to hold it in. A loud sob forced it's way out of him like a punch, and his whole body shook with it. He wailed into his hands, trying to muffle the noise. Hot tears streamed down his face and dripped off his chin and nose. Another sob hit him full force and he doubled over as it erupted from him. He sat on the edge of the bed, his whole body vibrating with emotion. He knew he should feel rage and hate, but right now all he felt was loss. It settled deep in his chest, making a home behind his ribs. He could feel it, heavy and making it hard to breath, like a weight dragging him down deeper and deeper into despair. His mouth opened on a silent scream of pain, and for once he let himself cry. The tears ran down his face and wails and sobs shook his body. His head ached and his sides hurt, but still, the tears continued.
He settled back down and pressed a delicate kiss to Dean’s inner thigh. This time, when Dean let out a wavering sigh, Cas knew it was arousal, not nerves.
“So you know what it is?”
Dean wouldn't abandon Sam with their dad. He was a nasty drunk, and likely to take a swing even when he wasn't drinking. Dean had to be there to make sure he didn't go after Sam. He couldn't run away like Patrick had.
"What did the doctor say?" Cas asked, his tone serious.
Bobby stood and was about to make his way to the stairs when he felt Sam grip him by the arm. He turned and saw the younger of the two brothers watching him, looking slightly panicked and leery.
"They are quite talented."
Dean squeezed Cas tighter, hiding his face in he angel's neck. When he spoke next, it was mumbled into Cas' skin.
“I told you I love you so much it scares me. I was terrified if you knew the truth, you’d pull away like she did. I couldn’t... I could watch that. Couldn’t watch you stop loving me.”
Dean smirked, but let it slide without comment.
Dean worries again about Castiel being distant tonight, but Cas puts all his worries to rest the moment he lies down. Castiel settles onto his side and raises his arm, inviting Dean to fit himself into the familiar space there. The moment Dean tucks his head under Castiel’s chin and feels strong arms wrap around him, he feels right for the first time in days. His eyelids feel heavy, and he knows tonight he’ll finally sleep.
He feels like crying. Never in all his years of hunting did he ever see himself settling down. It just wasn’t possible. Any time he’d gotten close, with Cassie and then with Lisa, something happened and he realized it was selfish to drag civilians into this life. Or use them to pull himself out. Hunting had been his life since he was four years old. He couldn’t shut it off.
“And what, Bobby? What do you want me to say?” he snapped. “That he pulled me from Hell and rebelled against Heaven to help me? That I trusted him completely? That he threw it all away like it didn't matter, like I didn't matter, to work with some demon? That I still miss him anyway?"
Dean sighed, feeling more and more useless as his every attempt to help was shot down. He didn’t
“Scenting you,” Cas said, like that was the most normal thing in the world. “I was curious. Humans don’t produce pheromones, but since you are reacting to mine, I wondered.”
“I honestly thought you knew. You’d spent time with Jimmy while I was in Heaven. You must have noticed he was an omega.”
Dean's voice cracked a little when he mentioned the angel's name. He looked down and away quickly, clearing his throat in an effort to cover it up. If Sam noticed, he didn't say anything about it, just continued to pack the trunk of the new piece of shit car Dean had stolen while the Impala was on lockdown.
Dean nodded. It made sense.
“Him. Bobby, it's Cas!”
Dean wished for another shot. He didn't correct the use of the word 'her'.
Dean sighed, rubbing his free hand over his face. Things had to make sense soon because he felt like he was going insane. It didn’t help that Castiel smelled so unhappy and so in heat. It was upsetting his alpha more.
For as gentle and careful as Castiel is, he can be impatient with certain things. Like getting Dean naked. He pulls back after only a minute, pulling Dean’s jeans and underwear off in one go. His eyes fall on Dean’s cock, which hasn’t filled in the slightest. Before he can offer to help with that, Dean rolls onto his knees and crawls toward the bedside table. While he roots around in the drawer, he can hear Cas pulling his own clothes off and dropping them to the floor. As his hand closes around a half-empty bottle of Astroglide, Dean feels himself float further and further away.
“Something like that.” Dean finally said.
going to a doctor!” he roared, sure if he looked in a mirror right now his eyes would be alpha red.
Castiel grins and gets into the bed properly. Dean takes a moment just to watch, thrilled to see Cas back where he belongs. It wasn’t only the bed that felt empty without him here. It was the room, it was Dean’s entire life. None of it made sense without the dorky former angel here with him.
“You’ve locked yourselves in your room every night since you two got together!” Sam said like he thought Dean was lying.
He felt eyes on him, knew he was being watched even as he looked anywhere but at who he was talking to. He risked a quick glance to his side and saw the look he was getting. One that was so full of adoration and devotion he couldn't handle it and looked away again.
“No, whatever you were calling Bobby for you can tell me.”
“Then please be honest with me, Dean.”
Castiel nodded.
“What?”
Dean held the head in place as the body fell away. He felt good, /really/ good. His body was practically humming with satisfaction. He would have loved to stay as he was for a while, hearing the sound of blood dripping into the floor, seeing the blank, dead look in the headless man's eyes. Then, as if a sudden rage filled him, he would drop to the ground, soaking himself in the pool of blood now surrounding him, and he would beat and hit and stab the blade into the dead body, making sure it was dead. By the time he was done, the walls, the ceiling, and he himself would be dripping wet with someone else's blood, stained deep red.
“We're trying to help you, son.”
Sam was at a loss for words. How could he possibly explain how complicated this all was, if Castiel didn't remember a thing?
“I want to take care of you.”
“Okay, I’ll get you some food. Will you be okay without me for a couple minutes?”
The hunter rolled his eyes at his drunk friend, but still smirked. Who would have though Cas could be a fun drunk?
Gently, because he knew this was new to Castiel and that he'd so rarely been touched with good intentions, Dean’s hands settled on Castiel’s hips. The light pressure there stilled Cas, and he’d looked at Dean with confusion.
There was no answer at first, and Dean was about to walk away and try later, when he heard a groan. It wasn’t loud, but it was loud enough that Castiel must have made it on purpose. Dean took it as an invitation and quietly cracked the door open.
Concern showed clearly on Sam's face as he watched his brother over the roof of the car. Dean sighed and ducked his head, breaking eye contact in favour of staring at the sidewalk.
“The dude won’t talk to me for more than 5 seconds! I haven’t seen him in two days.”
“Okay?”
Dean shakes his head, grimacing at the thought. Castiel sounds so disgusted with himself, and Dean doesn’t want that.
“About Cas.”
"We were trying to see if the shape-shifter you and Sam killed was following any sort of pattern."
“… and you don’t like that?” Dean asked, frowning.
Dean found the shirt sitting at the top of the pile of shirts in Cas’s wardrobe. Arms loaded with what he needed, he returned to the bathroom where Cas was still drying his hair.
Dean was laying on an old, beat up couch in the cabin. One leg dangling off the side, his foot flat on the dusty floor, the other leg flopped over the arm rest, dangling awkwardly and swinging lightly. His outside arm cradled his head, while his other was busy lifting a flask to his mouth.
“I think that you two were together, and that you loved him.” Sam said finally. It was about as accurate as he could get.
"You're lucky I don't help him drag your ass out into the parking lot and finish what he started. Get out of here now." Doug's voice was measured, but he didn't sound calm.
Cas obliged. His hair was already plenty wet enough, so Dean asked him to pass the shampoo.
Castiel blinks. Then blinks again. Then his frowns deepens.
Sam wrinkled his nose, annoyance colouring his scent. He pushed on calmly anyway.
About two hours later, everyone, even Cas, was smiling and having a good time. The brothers shared a few funny hunting stories they had, making Cas laugh and grin at them.
Dean focused his attention on the man across from him, knowing that the man beside him was trapped anyways.
Dean looks around for anything else he can clean, but the entire kitchen is spotless. They could probably eat off the floor safely.“I guess... I don’t know where to go from here.”
“Is... kissing alright?” Cas asks. Dean can hear the hope in his voice, but he can also tell Cas is trying to sound neutral. He doesn’t want his desires to impact Dean’s choices. He is one of the most selfless people Dean knows, and that is saying a lot.
Castiel huffs and Dean can’t tell if it’s from amusement or frustration.
But today it cleared Castiel’s head enough that he remembered his earlier decision to talk to Dean. He pulled back, though he didn’t go far, just enough that he could look Dean in the eye and keep those distracting lips at a safe distance.
The man in the camouflage vest swallow nervously. He wasn't totally sure the giant in front of him wouldn't take another swing, and his nose was already causing him great pain. He squeezed past Sam, who still didn't move, or stop glaring. His fists were still clenched. Sheepishly, Gary walked over to Dean and Cas. He couldn't meet the glares he got from either of them, not to mention the looks he was getting from the other people in the bar. He deciding instead to stare at the floor or the walls.
“You break my heart, kid.”
. He took Castiel’s hand and pulled him out of the kitchen.
Dean decided to call it a night and try to figure out how to get the angel and himself back to the cabin. He didn't trust Cas to mojo them there, and the last thing he wanted was for them to end up in Egypt or something. Yeah, he didn't want to wake up tomorrow on the sphinx. He thanked Beth once more when he paid for the drinks. He had to use of of his fake credit cards this time, because yeah, Cas had had a lot. Dean then hauled a stumbling Castiel out to call either Sam or Bobby for a ride.
Dean can hardly bear the thought of losing Castiel. Even back then, before they both got their heads out of their respective asses, the idea of Cas leaving him forever hurt almost as much as the idea of Sam leaving.
“Don’t worry. Omegas in heat give off very strong pheromones that trigger a protective instinct in alphas. You’re probably feeling a little of the effects from being so close to me.”
Gary either didn't hear him or didn't care, because he continued his belligerent assault.
With the fear of infidelity and the confusion of learning Cas was an omega behind them, Dean could shift his focus to something else. Beginning with the fact that Castiel looked like he hadn't showered or changed his clothes in a while. And given that Dean hadn’t known to prep for this, they had none of the supplies he would need for a heat.
“Yeah, because I was scared if you knew the truth, you’d leave!”
“Cas, this right here? This is the best part of my day.”
Sam nodded, still looking a little stunned. Dean felt bad, but he knew if he stuck around any longer to explain, it would just make him more anxious to get back to his omega. And if Sam said the wrong thing again...
The older hunter groaned, he didn't want to talk to anyone right now, or anytime in the foreseeable future.
“Just give me a minute and then I’ll return the favour,” Dean said, blinking slowly up at the ceiling like he wasn’t really seeing it yet.
“Yeah, no problem, Cas.”
They had been driving for an hour or so, the whole time the Winchester had been trying to figure out how to approach the subject without being too direct. Emanuel wasn't being much help. Whether or not he remembered his life before, he still didn't understand uncomfortable silence, and never attempted to break it, thus giving Sam an easier opening to start his questions. So, finally, the older Winchester had bitten the bullet and just jumped right into it. He needed to figure out what had happened to Cas.
Cas is stubborn, but he takes the hint and gets dressed.
“Well, I know this beta who’s ace. When she came out, her family sent her to a bunch of doctors because they figured something was wrong with her. They even gave her drugs to induce a presentation, because they thought she was just a late presenting omega.”
“Do you mean as a friend?” he finally asked tentatively.
“I had to do something, Dean!” Sam wasn't about to back down. “You weren't eating unless Bobby made you, you were drinking more in a day then he does in a week, and you barely slept! You're my brother, I'm always gonna try to help you, and I'm certainly not going to apologize for it!”
It was then that the wannabe bikers broke out of their shock and rushed to help. Two of them went to help the leader, while one tackled a swaying Castiel to the ground.
He planned to let Cas do his thing and just stand nearby, letting his smell keep the omega calm and happy. Cas had other plans.
“Relax, Dean. I told you, no one ever forced me. Alphas are aware of the strength of their urges and are careful to make sure the omega is willing before getting too close.”
“Dean-”
“Hey, Beth. Uh, this is Cas.” Dean gestured toward the angel. The blond bartender turned to look at the man in the trench coat beside Dean. She smiled warmly at him.
Cas sighed and sat back down on the bed.
“I need you to understand, Cas, you are so much more important to me than sex. No question, I’m always gonna pick you. If that means we just keep doing what we’ve been doing, that’s okay with me.”
The low rumble of the Impala filled Dean's ears as he steered his baby onto the road. Sam sat in the passenger seat, looking out the window through the dark at the cemetery they were leaving.
He grabbed the heat pack from the microwave and Cas’s tea, hurrying out of the room before he bit Sam’s head off again.
Dean was still confused, but this was the longest conversation he’d had with Cas in four days, and he counted that as a win.
The last seizure had been the worst so far. For a while there, everyone had been pretty sure that Cas wasn't gonna pull through. It had been too hard for Dean to stay in the room, seeing Cas, his Cas, spasming like that and struggling to breathe. He'd told Sam and Bobby to stay with him, then charged into another room in Bobby's house. Any room, he didn't care, just somewhere he wouldn't hear the pained grunts and spastic flailing.
Bobby heard the annoyance in Dean's voice, as well as the added weight he gave to the words when he said he could take care of himself. He almost sounded... defensive. He decided it was time he spoke to the oldest Winchester himself.
Sam hesitated. What had the angel been to his brother? A boyfriend? A lover? Any word that came to mind didn't seem right.
“But you said-”
"I have nothing to do. I would like to go with you, Dean."
Castiel grinned and turned his focus back wholly to his task. He’d never done this before, to Dean or anyone else, but he was eager to learn. Not that Dean was offering much help. Each new thing Cas tried was met with encouraging moans and gasps and stuttered breathing.
Dean realized he had let that slip. He also realized that he didn't care. Clearly whatever he was drinking really was effective.
Laying back down on the couch upstairs, he finally gave in to the urge to blackout, sinking into its warm oblivion.
Sam sighed in relief, knowing that at least for now Dean was mostly his normal self. His brother stayed where he was on the floor, holding Cas upright until the cuts on his face started closing and the swelling began to go down as the angel healed his vessel.
Castiel still looks upset, but he’s looking at Dean again. There’s so much hope in his eyes like he wants to believe what Dean is saying, but part of him is holding on to the conclusions he reached this morning. Dean is determined to sever the thread tying Castiel to the thought that he’s done something irredeemably awful.
“This is great. You built a wonderful nest, omega.”
“Uh, in the meantime, you must want some fresh blankets, huh? Do you think I can move you to that chair for a minute so I can change your sheets?”
“Is there anything else I can do for you?” he asked, letting his breath tickle over the spot that made Cas shiver.
"Bobby call with a few new leads. There's been some demon activity in South Carolina he said we should check out. Might have something to do with Crowley, he's been busy now that he decided he's king of Hell."
Sam shook his head.
“Yeah, I guess.”
Gary didn't know how to react. He held a hand over his bleeding nose, looking around for someone to help him. He looked to the guy he had been taking to, a buddy of his. The other man nervously looked between his friend and Sam.
“Mmm, this is perfect, thank you. No, I want to see if they go away on their own. They aren’t too bad right now. I think your presence helps.”
"Cas, I've done horrible things. People have died because of me."
“Bobby thinks there might be a small nest of vamps holding up in a barn a few miles north of town.”
“Yes.”
“I don’t want to go through that again, Dean. I don’t want to lose you to secrets or lies. We’re supposed to be honest with each other. We’re supposed to be a team. But that only works if we want it to.”
He put on a relatively fresh shirt, one that at least it didn't have any stains on it or an overpowering odour, different jeans and his boots. Sneaking down the stairs and across the room as quietly as he could, he then headed outside, careful not to wake Bobby or Sam.
Cas' eyes stopped roaming when he saw what was on the bed. He'd seen it last night, but in his reverence in seeing Dean again, his mind had dismissed it before he could really process what he was seeing. In a crumpled heap, dangling halfway to the floor, was his trench coat.
That Cas is reading at the kitchen table means he was waiting for Dean, proving that he’s no longer avoiding him.
But Castiel sets a closed bottle of Astroglide on the nightstand and moves off the bed. When he returns, this time laying beside Dean, he’s wearing his boxers. A warm hand settles gently between Dean’s shoulder blades, rubbing soothing circles that help him relax.
“Nah, nothing ever happened between us,” Dean said. “This was later. Just before you got back. I met a guy named Rico at a bar. He was grieving too, just lost his wife of 10 years. No kids, no other family. His wife died when a lone vamp broke into their house. We hunted it down together and after... That wasn’t a relationship, that was just...”
Knowing I was colouring slightly, I said, “Yeah, I thought you might not have, Cas. Its fine”
Dean looked at both of us and said “I’m going to help Jack with the third trial”
Huffing a laugh, I ask him, “Am I not too heavy?”
“Rowena can’t give me exact figures, Dean but the bottom line is this needs to be done and I need your words” Siobhan said
“Well, that’s a great idea?” Rose exclaims “I would love to do it myself, but I suck at gardening”.
Sam shrugs, “We flew and rented the car at the airport. We were needed here.”
It’s hard to look Cas in the eyes; he looks so hurt, so confused, “Cas, we can’t force him to stay with us. Maybe what he needs is some time away from us. Time to grieve”
Remember him smiling as he ate pizza in the sitting room and watching telly and saying a few words to Joseph.
Keith and Nicholas both chime in, “Yeah Dean, can we?”
I bent down and kissed him on the mouth, nibbling and sucking on his bottom lip, savouring the little gasps that came from his mouth.
Still using Meg’s image, the Entity strolls up to him and says, “Well, I think that was just a misunderstanding. I’m here to rectify that”
Sam can’t take his eyes off Dean, and Dean is starting to get pissed, “You stare this much in your own time?”
He raised his head a little but still wouldn’t look at me, “Will you stay? I think I need you to stay”
Miracle runs past me and jumps onto my bed.
“Alright, alright, that’s enough from the love birds” I said prying Cas away from Sam. “Let’s get you to bed”.
My eyes are burning in my sockets as I get out of bed. Besides not sleeping, I don’t think I took my eyes off Cas all night. He grounds me and won’t hear of it when I try to blame myself for not calling Helen earlier.  He reminds me that Jimmy has lived with his father’s moods for a long time and knows the warning signs, and what he was seeing from his Dad over the last couple of days didn’t raise any red flags with him.
Dean felt horror and anger build in his gut. Presentation inducing was illegal now in most states, but it hadn’t been that way for long, and there were still places that did it. The drugs were dangerous, occasionally even lethal. Especially when given to someone who had already presented.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said, pulling the hunter into a kiss.
The next bag held the odds and ends they had needed. Wet wipes, their own can of Neutru, and some painkillers specifically designed for heat relief. No tea or heat pads, but Sam had probably left those in the kitchen since they had to be prepared in there.
"One more fit like that..."
Doing his best not to trip, the hunter carried the bags down the stairs. He spotted his brother leaning over the maps table with Cas sitting beside him. The two were talking and making marks on the grid, Dean wasn't sure why though. As far as he knew, they weren't on a case.
“Hmm?”
“Yes, Sam?”
“No, nothing.”
“We’ve been together seven months, Dean! Were you ever going to tell me?”
“Nothing’s wrong,” Dean says, but he knows that doesn’t sound true. He’s literally shaking with relief now that Cas has his boxers back on.
Dean scoffed. Sam made it sound like it was so easy.
The next Saturday was a fairly lazy day for the boys. The bunker was quiet and calm for a change. Sam was making lunch in the kitchen, Cas was in his room reading, and Dean was leafing through the local papers. He was still willing to drive across the country for a case, but it was nice to have one nearby. Even if it did make it a bit harder, 'cause there was always the risk of someone recognizing them.
“I didn’t see it like that, Cas.”
“How could you? After what the last guy did? What if that happened again? You would let some sorry bastard take on what was happening to me?”
” Dean’s eyes flick to the clock on the wall, shocked to see it reading 11:46 am. “Wow, no wonder you were up first. Why didn’t you wake me?”
Dean’s arms, his back, his hair... places Cas could touch in everyday settings, anyway. Not that he didn’t enjoy whatever Dean was willing to give him, but he felt selfish just lying there, receiving all the attention.
“You haven’t enjoyed sex since before your time in Hell?”
“Alright, I'll start making calls. See if anyone knows about a genuine healer.”
“More? What? You mean together?”
Castiel laughed.
make an appearance to grab some food or a cup of tea, he was sweaty and flushed, wrapped only in a bathrobe.
"Get out of here." Sam told him. It was clear this man knew nothing, he was just a middle man in a really shitty deal.
He ordered three more beers, and glanced back to the booth. In his absence, Dean had slid over closer to Castiel, and he had his arm around the angel's waist. Sam couldn't hear what his brother was whispering in the angel's ear, but whatever it was, it was making Cas smile and blush.
And now his hunter was awake and undoubtedly had many questions. Castiel realized Dean was somewhat in shock, and it was probably best if he started this conversation for him.
A guilty look crosses Castiel’s face, and his gaze drops to his coffee.
There was another silence for a few minutes, before Emanuel spoke again.
“I found out the best way to get to him is through the woman he lives with, in Colorado. I found out where they live, went to pay her a visit. Emanuel wasn't there, but I spoke to her. Told her I was going blind. That was the truth. My right eye was burnt out."
Bobby smiled. Underneath his gruff exterior, he really was a big softy, and he was glad Dean had someone. He still didn't completely trusted Cas again yet, but he was going to work on that, for Dean's sake. If Cas was really serious about being sorry and trying to make up for it, it wouldn't be too hard.
“Sir? The bar is closed. Did you forget something here?”
“Dean, no one on this planet is happier than Cas right now. I can’t remember the last time he wasn’t smiling. If he wasn’t a beta, I’m pretty sure he’d smell like sunshine 90% of the time.”
Sometimes, Dean thought about that time. Before the Apocalypse and angels and the demon blood and his forty years downstairs. Hell, even before Sam had gone to Stanford. He thought about those years. In comparison, they seemed so easy now. The hunter wondered if, given the chance, he would prefer to go back to that innocence. If he would rather have never met Cas. If everything he felt now, the pain, the betrayal, the confusion, the hurt, the abandonment, the... insignificance, if they outweighed the love, the acceptance, the friendship, the forgiveness, the happiness, the safety the angel had given him. Even if it had all been just for a short while. He didn't know.
“What was in the box? What was in the box?”
“Okay, um. I can’t believe I’m gonna ask this, but what is knotting exactly?”
“He was healing the sick, fixing the crazy, stuff like that. Naturally, I though something wasn't right, so I decided to check it out.”
“I- yes. It just seemed... you don’t mind, do you?”
Now, Cas applied his limited experiences to relaxing Dean. He started by running his hands up and down Dean’s back, sides, and arms, encouraging blood flow to help the muscles relax more. Once Dean’s skin felt warm, Cas began his dedicated work. Almost meticulously, he encouraged Dean’s muscles to relax under his touch, unwinding knots that had been there for years. He watched with satisfaction as the tension drained out of Dean slowly, leaving him half-asleep on the bed and letting out pleased
It was more a statement than a question. Dean sighed and took a few steps closer to the bed.
Slowly, he nodded, wiping his eyes again.
Dean cast a quick glance at Cas, who was still swaying back and fourth, staring at the ground. The hunter quickly decided the angel wouldn't be much help if this turned into a fight. Which it looked like it was going to. He looked directly at the leader.
Dean exhales as tension drains from his body. Besides Cas leaving, his next biggest fear had been Cas not understanding. Explaining why he’d chosen to lie for months was difficult for Dean, but he couldn’t imagine trying to understand it from the outside. Especially while dealing with everything else Castiel has been feeling through this last week.
Cas nodded.
The hunter paused at the sound of a second, new voice. As Dean whipped around, he moved out of the way just enough for Sam to see Castiel standing in the entrance. His brother growled, and left Sam for the time being, turning to fully face Cas.
boyfriend. I don’t have to know.”
“Look, let me grab a pack just in case-”
The smile quickly left Baldy's face and he took a blind swing at Dean. The hunter blocked it easily, he had seen it coming, before landing his own upper cut to the guy's stomach. The biker doubled over in pain. Taking advantage of the position Baldy was now in, Dean grabbed his head to keep it in place, before swiftly bring his knee up and hitting the guy square in the jaw, knocking him out cold.
noises.
The younger hunter felt a twinge of sympathy for the stranger. Hunting was a dangerous job, anything could happen. Matthew kept talking.
“I- Yeah, I do. I don’t want to stop that either.”
Fingers followed the muscles of his back, palms skimmed his ribs, nails raked over his shoulders until he was moaning into Dean’s mouth and rutting slightly against him, their boxers becoming slick.
Plus, Dean was pretty sure the poor guy had picked up his first flu. For the last two days, Castiel had locked himself in his room. Dean assumed he was just sleeping, because when he finally
Cas' voice was calmer and soft when he spoke again
Dean nearly smirked as a memory of Castiel popped into his head.
Whoever was calling paused, obviously not recognizing the voice on the other end. It finally replied.
Dean wishes it were that easy. That it was a simple argument about whose socks went where, or who let the milk go bad again.
The unknowing angel shook his head. His voice calm as ever when he replied.
The smile I’ve named “My smile” is what I'm rewarded with as he says, “Sorry Sam” before kissing me thoroughly. The boys are giggling, and Sam’s, “C’mon guys”, are not enough for me to stop him.
Cas shrugs shyly, “Surprise me”.
Eileen gasps and clasps her hands to her face, clearly delighted, while Sam laughs and claps his hands.
“Lord above Dean, I can hear you coming” Sam laughed as I came into view. Eileen was sitting at the table laughing at what Sam had said, not having heard said stomach talking.
I opened my eyes and with tears flowing I told a stunned Castiel what I saw. “The boys don’t know, do they?” I asked him. He didn’t have to answer, I could tell by his face.
Cas sits down beside me again and I look at him. “Thanks for that Cas”.
Leaving the shop with my purchases, I have a longing to see Cas even though I’m barely an hour out of his company. Man, I have it bad, and I don’t care.
Tongue swirling around the head of his cock, I feel Cas’s legs start to shake as he gasps, “Dean…………. oh Dean………please………. I’m………Dean”.
I looked at the hand on my shoulder and followed the arm to the face of its owner.
I bent my head to look at her, “What, it was more about the fact that he thought I was in a relationship with Cas”
Jimmy pipes up, “How about at the beginning?”
SIOBHAN
“Sammy, say something” Dean said
Rowena's smile widens at that while I'm just more confused.
Jimmy shakes his head, “No, Da……..the demon smashed it”
Looking around watching my family brainstorm the end of days with Rowena and Naomi, I felt a lightness in myself that I had never felt before.
The man that exits the car is tall, with light brown skin and a face that would not look out of place in a Doctor Sexy episode. Rounding the car to greet us, he holds out his hand to shake Cas’s hand first before shaking mine. His smile is wide, welcoming, and professional but I can't help noticing that his handshake seems to linger with me.
…………………………………………………………………………………………..
“DEAN, CAS seriously”
Jack sighs before he whispers, “Not long more.”
If something develops between us, it couldn’t be half-assed.
I jump in before she can, “Cas and I are great, thanks. We’re a “tight” team” I said grinning wolfishly at him, and I really enjoy watching him blanch at my innuendo.
SIOBHAN
A couple of hours later, our little party is in full swing. While I man the grill, Jackie and Rose have joined us, sitting next to Sam, Eileen and Cas. Keith and Nicholas are playing “fetch” with Miracle, Joseph and Michael are playing cards on the ground unsurprisingly at Cas and Eileen’s feet.
Sam and I spoke for another few minutes about the boys before we turned the conversation to the training of the hunters and Eileen before we hung up.
Eventually Jack said, “I thought they needed an Archangel to make new Angels.” “Well she’s not a full Angel but she’s part way there.” Castiel answered
After showing us the boys’ rooms, Sonny heads up towards the attic and shows us our room.
“Ok we need answers” I said “And they can only come from Naomi. Jack can you determine if an Angel is telling the truth”
SIOBHAN
That did it. My cock jerked in Cas’s hands and I came hot and hard, as it mixed with Cas’s on his belly. Not able to hold myself up any longer, I collapsed down beside Cas, my face on his chest.
Ok this was a very bad idea.
The adults take it in turns to play with the kids. When it’s Sam and Eileen’s turn, the decibel level rises exponentially. Dean and I raise our heads from the blanket, groaning, to see Sam holding Joseph high above his shoulders before launching him towards the centre of the lake. The squeals and resounding splash echo around us.
I turned back to Naomi and asked her what had been done to me. That from what I had heard I had more abilities than the average Prophet, not to mention the trip down memory lane with Dean.
“Dean, stop,” Cas says, pulling me in for a punishing embrace, “Stop. This is not your fault. We are going to find this Walker, and we are going to deal with him. And we are going to mind these boys until Sonny is back on his feet, ok.”
Turning to Keith, I wish I had something more positive to tell him, “Keith, I know it sucks right now, but no matter what happens, you have a home here, ok”.
“And who’s this?” Sonny asks looking behind me into the car.
I run into the house, glancing into the sitting room on my way to the kitchen when what I see has me barking out a laugh. There, sitting on the couch are the four boys waiting patiently and Cas sitting in the armchair.
Dean, he was furious. I don’t blame him.
“So she latched Crowley onto you?” said Sam “I can’t believe he’s back.
He then returns the favour, washing my hair and my body. We were both starving for each other’s touch. It’s been nearly a week since we had this. Too long.
I turned to find everyone had crowded around behind me.
As I turn to introduce Cas, my counterpart beats me to it, holding out his hand for a handshake he says, “You must be Cas. It’s very nice to meet you”
……………………………………………………………………………………………
“So anyway guys, the reason I was calling is we’re organising a hunt with some other hunters across the country in Athens, West Virginia. There’s a big nest of vamps that need to be taken out. Eileen and I are leaving tomorrow. It'll take two days to get there, another day to coordinate taking out the nest, and a full day to clear it fully out. Anyway, Eileen and I were thinking we would swing by on the way home. We could stay for the weekend. What do you think?”
“Cas, I don’t understand, there is nothing Dean and Sam wouldn’t do for you, why didn’t you tell them.”
Here in his own thoughts, he could admit how much he had missed Siobhan over the last two weeks. Even though he couldn’t be with her, he enjoyed being around her.
It happened so quickly that the boys thought they had lost their hearing. No more whirlwind or lightening or appliances exploding. Just deathly silence. Siobhan was lying on the ground, her eyes closed and curled in a foetal position.
Jody’s eyes narrow at Dean but widen as Donna walks past her towards the men.
I look up at Cas as he pounds into me, backlit against the night sky. He’s tanned and sweaty, his hair is dark and completely wrecked, his eyes are blown jet black and his lips are bruised pink, but he’s never looked more gorgeous. My Angel.
Dean asks Sam, “What’s the point of Heaven if you can’t overindulge every now and again.”
Twenty minutes later I arrive in the town of Fallsburg. Its slightly bigger than Hurleyville and nobody knows who I am here. There’s also a Walmart, where I can find everything I need.
Later on that evening, a new episode of Star Trek Discovery is about to begin when Michael sits up straight on the beanbag he had been reclining on, just as we are settling in front of the TV. Turning fearful eyes to mine and Cas, he jumps up and runs over to us.
“Are you sure about this, it’s not too late to go back to Sam and help him with the training of the new hunters”.
I walk down to meet her and give her a hug. “Hey Robin, it’s good to see you”
Taking a shaky breath, I told him what happened. “Rose was right. You hid a lot of your feelings from me, and it must have been so hard to do. I know how I feel about you Cas and if I had to hide these feelings and still be around you all the time, it would have been torture. I don’t think I could have done it.
One minute they're standing in Dean’s backyard near the lake, the next, they’re standing in a beautiful garden. Dean turns in a circle taking in his surroundings.
Sonny blew out a breath, “Well on a scale of 1-10 it’s about a 6, which isn’t too bad, but the treatment they want me to try will floor me, so if I want to get better, I have to give it 110%. My sister lives in the city and she said I can stay with her while I’m going through it, but Dean I can’t give up on the kids, I can’t let them down. I was hoping you would know someone that would be able to help out, keep the doors open, just until I’m on my feet again”.
Dean can relate.
“She’s having a nightmare” said Sam.
I called Castiel’s name before he could leave. He turned and looked at me expectantly “Who’s Naomi, Castiel?”
Jody lifts Donna’s head from her chest and wipes the tears from her face. As they draw comfort from each other, a new voice says,
I laughed at that “Sonny, you have no idea”.
“Dean” Sam roared “Let’s go. Rowena’s expecting us”
I watch as Jimmy puts them on the locker beside the bed furthest from his.
“Cas” Jack said. “Of the two plans, this one has the better chance that we all survive. But we don’t have a choice. We are in a war against God. We’re lucky to have one chance against him, never mind two. If this plan doesn’t work, we still have the backup plan. Me blowing up God and Amara. Which means I still need to do the third trial.”
I nodded then I burst out laughing. Big belly laughs that came from my toes.
Cas takes their bags out of the bed of the truck and we all enter the house together.
Climbing into bed that night, Cas was already asleep and snoring softly after his afternoon of hard work. With Miracle at my feet, I lay on my side watching him until my eyes grew heavy and I fell into a deep dreamless sleep.
I looked over at Naomi. She was looking at Rowena in my arms as if she couldn’t understand it. Yeah well, it was her loss.
He loved her humour, her sarcastic wit, even the fact she swore something fierce (she had stuck her tongue out at him and said “I’m Irish” when he pointed this out to her) but what he loved most about her was the way she treated the boys.
He talks about how he hates going back to school with everyone knowing where he’s been and why.
Cas’s face softens at that, “Then I was in my right to invite people to stay. It will be good for us to have guests. We have been a bit in each other’s pockets lately. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it as well. If you let yourself.”
“I think I only got the basic package in the Angel department” I teased. At his puzzled look I said “I’m still not back at full power”
“Dean, Eileen and I were talking, you know what to do now, you know since Chuck is gone and Team Free Will is alive and kicking”.
Jack nods, “It can, but I’m surprised he is planning on it. If he does this, everything will be wiped, including the residents in the Empty. It is not just the keeper of the Empty and the residents there; it also draws its strength from the Angels and Demons that rest there. It will leave itself very weakened.”
I hurry after Cas, but he has already disappeared. Man, he can really move. Reaching his bedroom, I can hear him inside.
“C’mon you have to know. You are working hard at building this new system with the hunters and yet you drop everything for me, when Cas and I need to vent. We are extremely grateful. And now Cas…………………….I………….Sam I………………….I love him, I really fucking love him and it’s so new and so fucking much………………...but it’s so right………...it feels so fucking right………………...why the hell was I fighting against it for so long”
Sam cleared his throat and asked me what I had been dreaming.
CASTIEL
Scrubbing my face, I shake my head, but answer, “I will be”.
“Dean, the dinner is burning. Sorry I distracted you” Cas said smiling at me
That by killing the Entity will give us not one army, but two to fight against God, if Rowena is really your friend now, do you not think she would want to help?”
Sam pipes up, “She is not lying. From the minute we left last time, Eileen has been planning this trip back.”
As I run onto the landing on the boy’s floor, Sam hops out of his room, trying to get his boots on, and together we run down the remaining stairs and land in the foyer.
Ten minutes later, I find out.
“When has this life ever been fair, especially to us” Cas replied
I didn’t know how much time had passed, when I found what I needed. I dove towards it into Naomi’s mind. I felt her resisting again, but I pushed through and there I found everything we were looking for.
“Yeah and Rowena knocked me across the room” Cas told her
So, I explained everything to Rowena how we needed her to do the spell to help Siobhan kick start her mojo.
Sam, Dean fighting monsters, fighting each other, Castiel with wings fighting alongside them, Lucifer, Hell, Purgatory, Death, Life, God………….. so many images told in a story, a lifetime worth and then it stopped, and I was staring into green eyes and I could hear people shouting my name, shouting Deans name before I fell into blissful darkness.
I got up off the bed and I stood there stunned trying to wrap my head around what he had just said. “The opposite!!!” I said, “Then Cas why??”
“That’s amazing” said Jack “So everyone is happy”
My face is pressed down into the mattress and Cas is pounding hard into me and he’s still hitting that sweet spot that has me still leaking from my cock. My orgasm feels like its lasting forever.
But Cas stalked off around the house with the bag of fertilizer over his shoulder leaving Rose and I grinning after him.
Monday dawns on our usual routine. I send a text to Sam first thing to check in with him and to let me know how the plan for the nest is shaping up.
“Dammit Cas, don’t be sorry. Just give me a chance to respond” I said.
Cas is like a kid in a sweet shop. He has this big goofy smile on his face, and he peppers Sonny with questions about the different types of chickens, what they eat, how soon the eggs are laid. Sonny's in his element answering him. He's clearly delighted with Cas’s interest.
And I hate that Joseph, with his cheeky smile and beautiful nature, has no one to go home to.”
She stops to chat for a minute before I tell her we have to go, “Hopefully I haven’t ruined them for their dinner or Rose will have my hide”.
He was always shouting at Cas these days.
I shrugged, “Few calls, nothing major, you?” pointing to the phone in his hand.
Sam makes his way around the truck to get his hug from Joseph after he finishes squeezing the life out of Eileen.
“Jerk”, Dean grins.
Jack looked at me and lied straight to my face “She wouldn’t say”
“Sam called me and told me what happened. I didn’t know, I swear about Siobhan’s son. And for what it’s worth, I don’t think Naomi is lying about this plan, but we need to be sure. First, I need to speak to Siobhan.
I nodded, then cleared my throat
I know what she’s asking about. Now that the adrenaline has petered out, I’m left with a tired weariness in my bones.
“When do you want to leave?” I asked
The rest of the evening, we spend with the boys. We play games and listen to what Cas and I had missed over the last couple of days until, eventually, they are drooping with tiredness.
Whether it’s the words or the tone they’re spoken with, it distracts Sam from his grief. Raising his head from his son’s shoulders, he looks at Castiel, “It’s really you, Cas.”
Cas and I sneaked along the corridor to the shower room. A shower was definitely in order before we went back into the others.
After I was done, and a nest of butterflies had taken up residence in my stomach, I walked to the door and opened it. Both Cas and Dean stood up and walking towards them, I held out both my hands. Each took a hand and I walked them back towards the bedroom.
“Good, listen when you’re finished eating can we do a few mental exercises, I really feel the information is coming so much easier now.” I asked
“Yeah. But she only found out recently that he was killed deliberately so nothing would get in the way of her role in the end game. So please Jody give her the benefit of the doubt. She’s actually really looking forward to meeting you guys” I said
I squeezed his hand.
Whispering a “thank you” to Cas and kissing his cheek, I stood up and approached the bed and sat down beside Siobhan.
“Everything OK?” I asked
In the town, there is a lot of activity around for a Sunday. Shop owners are hanging lights and banners on their shop fronts, along with baskets of flowers, others are up on ladders stringing lights across the street.
Hearing me huff a laugh, Cas looks over at me questionably, “Well, I know what we are doing tomorrow.”
Jimmy winces, “I saw them when they came in, Dean they both looked……………. what happened”.
Now I was subjecting myself to another torturous experience. Am I a masochist in this life?
Dean snorts a laugh, “Yeah, unfortunately, they are”
Later on, after the housework was done, Cas and Rose took off into Hurleyville, the boys were allowed some free time outside and Sonny and I went into his office to go over some more of the rules and regulations.
But it was the intense feeling of power that stopped me in my tracks. I saw Jack stand up and turn to me and as he did, his eyes blazed like fire.
The words burst forth from me in a rage, “I want to kick the shit out of someone Cas. I haven’t even met this kid yet and I want to find every one of those fuckers that hurt him and eviscerate them. I want to throw them into a nest of vampires and watch them tear those fuckers apart. I want…………gggrrrrrrrr. I want to hurt them so bad”.
I point at Eileen “You set up for the movie, Sam you get the beers, and I will make the popcorn”.
Sam blurted out “Cas did you get a haircut?”
Running his fingers along the bookshelf in the research room, he spotted an old book, its bindings worn and frayed. He pulled it out and, on the front, it said “Deus Caelum” Latin for “Heaven’s God.”
Putting her down, I breath out shakily, “Yeah, pretty much”
Giving the woman behind the counter a tight smile and mumbling that I forgot my wallet, I make my escape.
on his lips.
Smiling while handing it to me he says, “You might actually finish this one”.
No sooner are we in the office than Sam is grinning at me, “Now that is worth all the crap we’ve gone through lately”.
It's then that the Deputy speaks up, “Well maybe not everyone. No gay stalls here for you boys”
“And you, how are you getting on, how’s Eileen,” I ask
“Yeah, I do. He’s a good kid, hell a great kid” I said smiling.
Shoulders slumped, I answer him, “Yeah and no. Michael and Cas had a bad day”.
Sam couldn’t be more transparent if he tried, “Sam, for the love of Jack, spit it out? What’s on your mind?” I asked him.
Arael was putting the finishing touches to a small lake at the bottom of the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, a mountain range in the southwest of Ireland and replicated here in this small part of Heaven. An old Irish man’s soul is on its way, and this is what will greet him when he arrives. A piece of home right here in Heaven while he waits for the rest of his family to join him.
I looked over at Rowena and asked her when we could start.
Sam looks surprised, “Yeah, I mean, I’m kind of shocked here. I know Heaven’s time runs differently but a hundred years. Doesn’t he have time for a visit?”
Bobby nodded.
Sam had half expected some sort or recognition from Cas at hearing his brother's name, but when there wasn't one, his heart sank a little further.
He sighs, but Cas is just as stubborn as he is, maybe more. This isn’t something he’s going to let Dean brush under the rug to be forgotten.
There were tears in Dean's eyes when he turned back to Castiel, but he did his best to hide them behind his anger.
“Got it.” the redhead rasped out. Dean nodded, before slowly letting the guy up to help his friends.
“Oh. Then what’s up? Did you forget to add something to the list?”
“No, I...” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, not sure how he was going to explain this to Sam. “Actually, I need to take something off it.”
“Dean... you know omegas sometimes say things in their heat that they might regret later, right?”
“Are you gonna tell me why?” Sam says around a yawn.
“Hey Bobby, what's up?”
“Hey, jerk!” Sam said playfully as he entered the room, trying to lighten Dean's mood.
“It’s late. Or early, I’m not sure.”
Though he had never said so, Castiel was pretty sure Dean had gotten in the habit of wearing so many layers when he was young to hide things he didn’t like about his body. And even though surgery and hormones had alleviated a lot of that discomfort, Dean’s wardrobe choices had changed little. He still dressed in layers of flannel, with dark shirts underneath. Not that Castiel would complain. They looked good on him.
“Wow, that's...wow. How...? Why did you think they were dead?”
After a couple of hours in the firing range, where they were finally seeing some progress, Dean couldn’t stand it anymore. Castiel was human now, and he was living here indefinitely. With Dean training him, there was a lot of physical contact, but it was strictly professional. Platonic. And that distance was killing him. Being so close and yet it meaning nothing. He wanted his touch to have gravity and purpose. Dean wanted Castiel to know he was here, with him, because it was what he wanted most.
“Relax, Sammy, we’re doing fine. That’s not why I called.”
“Not like that,” he adds quickly. “I mean things like this.” He holds up their clasped hands. “You a pretty touchy-feely guy, Cas. If we’re within two feet of each other, some part of you is touching me.”
“Dean?” Castiel whispers before he can drift off.
Beth nodded.
Dean pulled out his wallet and dropped a ten on the table.
Castiel watched Dean carefully, ready for anger or confusion. He knew this wasn't exactly the best way for Dean to find out he was still alive, but he hadn't been able to stay away.
wrong with Cas and he is
Cas set the empty plastic bags in a drawer with the others and pushed it shut, standing back up.
“Yes,” Cas said, the word barely more than a whisper, and strained enough to make Dean grin. He seemed to get a lot of enjoyment out of seeing the effect he had on Castiel, constantly smiling at each new sound, each subconscious movement he could coax from Cas’s body.
The Winchester stood up and stretched, pausing to let the head rush hit him. They were becoming more and more frequent lately. Lack of sleep and all that. After unsuccessfully trying to rub the spots from his eyes with the heals of his hands, he headed down to the main level to find food.
No matter. The bunker had dozens of rooms with beds in them. Once Dean had tossed the sheets and robe in one washer with extra soap and lots of hot water, and the comforter and pillowcases in another with a gentler, nicer smelling detergent, he went back to Cas’ room.
When Dean joins him on the bed, sitting so he can lean back against the headboard, Cas takes his hand again. His fingers are still so soft from years of grace healing every wound instantly, but Dean can feel the beginnings of calluses forming. All those hours digging up graves and learning to shoot are wearing on his body like an experienced hunter.
, but, um...”
He wishes they could just keep doing this. The kissing is nice, and he loves how Cas traces the muscles in his back delicately, like he’s touching something precious. He doesn’t even mind Cas moaning against his mouth, or the breathy noises that escape him when Dean finds a particularly sensitive spot on his neck. But it’s the anticipation of where this is leading that kills his enjoyment.
"There is nothing wrong with that, or them! It's close minded people like you," Sam now pointed to Gary. "that have a problem!"
There was anger is Dean's voice. Cas nodded, but he was confused. Why would Dean be angry?
“The Men of Letters only took alphas.”
Castiel’s voice cut through Dean’s realization, slamming him back to the present. He looked on the verge of tears, and Dean didn’t like that at all.
“Yeah, well. It’s happened before.”
“I don't know what do, Bobby.” Sam sounded exasperated and tired.
"That's my brother and my best friend you were talking about."
"What I said... at Magnus' mansion-"
“Effective.”
“Hey, Dean. I just got here, and the place is kinda busy, but I’m moving as fast as I can, alright?”
The angel of Thursday leaned on Dean as they all stumbled into the bunker. Once Sam was sure Dean and Cas were both okay on their own, he made his way down the hall to his own room.
“Hey. Where were you? You left your cell here.”
"Hey." Sam called back, still staring at the table. Castiel on the other hand, stood up and followed the Winchester into the other room.
The only light in the room came in through a high window, a breeze gently cooling the air within. The barely there light of the moon lit the cabin bedroom in a soft blueish hue, just enough light to make out the shape of the two men tangled together on the lumpy mattress.
“Are we good, Cas?”
“Uh, first was Jill. I met her a couple of weeks after... after Sam killed Alistair.“
“Dean?” Castiel asked, his voice almost a whine.
Dean smiled. It wasn’t as intense for him, but even he hated the idea of Cas being away from him, even for 10 minutes. But the idea of sharing a shower made his alpha practically purr.
Dean shook his head.
and tensed as if he expected yelling, or worse. Instead, Castiel had waited until Dean looked him in the eye, and gave him a reassuring smile.
“Allow me?”
to Cas, and it had taken months before it felt normal to say. But Cas needs to hear this stuff, and there isn’t much Dean wouldn’t do for him. Even though it feels like his blush is going to tattoo itself on his face.
“You can take my shirt off,” Cas said, moving back in for another kiss before Dean could ask if he was sure.
“Would it make you feel better if we talked about what I don’t want?” Dean asks.
Dean’s ears have gone so red it looked like he’d been in the sun for hours. He was slouched over in such a way that his 6’1” frame looked small, smaller than Cas, which was a very strange sight.
“Yeah, Sam never was much of a cook. Want me to whip us up a decent batch?”
“I left after that, obviously. And I didn’t try again until Lisa. You know what happened there. She was the longest relationship I’d ever had, and it went to shit slowly and then all at once.”
When he wasn't working there, he was at the Roadhouse, doing whatever the Harvelles needed him to do. Some days it was dishes, others he mopped the floors and cleaned up the kitchen, or wiped tables down and took out the garbage. After he turned eighteen, some night he even worked behind the bar, serving drinks. He liked doing that the best. Not because he was particularly fond of the actual work, but because he could make a lot of money in tips.
“You’re going to Heaven to talk to an army of angels. That could take a while” Jody said
Sarah places a hand on my arm, “Dean stop, relax. Michael has bonded with Cas. It’s amazing really. But not unheard of. Michael feels safe with Cas. I’ll show Cas what to do and how to do it. I’ll be coming out every second day to clean and look after the injury. Cas won’t need to do that”.
A gasp behind me had me turning around. I looked at Jody, but she was looking out the window at Jack and Siobhan. Facing each other on the porch, hands joined and eyes blazing they looked otherworldly, it was no wonder Jody was shocked. Even I wasn’t used to it yet.
“YES” Rowena said with a grin on her face.
Siobhan felt adrift.
I was still laughing walking down the stairs.
Rose’s face blanches, “Oh my god, you’re Sarah. Jackie is always going on about you. Only for the fact she swore you were straight as a die; I would have been sickeningly worried and jealous”.
“She really does” Sonny laughs as Rose swipes him with a dish cloth, “She even killed an ivy plant, and those suckers would survive an apocalypse”.
“Siobhan” Castiel said looking shocked. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you”
“Ah crap, please Rowena, just spit it out” I said
I grin and say “That’s Miracle, I did mention her, right?
The Entity sits itself down in the chair beside Oberon’s throne before looking up, “Do you have any wine?”
Cas snorts, “My fiendish plan is foiled”.
“Morning” I said making my way to the table to sit next to Cas. He's looking a bit bleary eyed himself and I wonder what he remembers of last night. I feel my face pinking up at the thought. To cover up my discomfiture, I pinch Cas on the arm.
“Alright, alright” I said, joining them before hurrying up to meet up with Eileen and the boys.
“I couldn’t sleep” I replied. “I contacted Naomi and she brought the research, just like she promised. It’s hard going trying to understand some of the text but there’s fascinating stuff in here too. Did you know that the dinosaurs were an experiment?
I turned to Jack and said “Jack, my coat, behind you”
Robin snorted a little, patting me on the shoulder, she said, “I don’t know if I believe you Dean” waving to Cas as she went into the house.
“I hurt all over,” she said “But its bearable. Now, I just want to feel clean.”
Taking a deep breath, I knock softly on Michael’s door and wait until its opened by Sarah. Her strained face mirrors mine, I’m sure.
Cas turned to me, his face wet from tears and that puzzled look on his face, but I continued “Or if you want, you could come with me”.
We both look over towards the door, and there's Joseph peeking out with a big grin on his face.
“You be good for Dean, Cas and Rose you hear, but more importantly, you be good to yourselves. Now I know this is a big change, especially for you Jimmy but I wouldn’t have Dean and Cas here if I didn’t trust them. But even so, I’ll be giving each of you my phone number so you can call any time ok. If I don’t answer, leave a message and I’ll call back”.
“Absolutely Dean, thank you”, Sonny replied.
His skin is tanned from working outside all week which makes his eyes even bluer. I can’t seem to look away.
When we get to the treeline, I hold out a hand to stop Cas. Standing hidden among the trees, we take deep breaths to even out our breathing. The last thing we want is to frighten the boys. Surveying the surrounding landscape, all looks quiet, but there are too many places for anybody to hide.
I looked at Sam and everything in me balked at his suggestion.
Dean nods his head, “I know. I think this is Earth. That looks familiar”, pointing towards the range rover with the Sioux Falls Sheriffs Department logo on it.
“My parents?” I asked not sure I wanted to know.
Her “Hi” which came out a bit croaky was the best sound in the world.
When Donna lets Arael go, Jody hugs her and says, “Welcome to the family.”
At dinner that night, Jimmy is a bit subdued. I’m not much fun myself. Giving the boys the night off from cleaning the kitchen, I shoo them out to enjoy the summer evening before stacking the dishwasher.
The buzz of my phone interrupts my musings. Looking at the number, it wasn’t one I recognized. Answering, I hoped I wasn’t going to regret this. Yeah, no such luck.
Jody reaches for her and pulls her into her arms, “Shush honey, we got to see Dean again, and we know that Sam ends up with his brother. That’s more than we had a few hours ago. And we’ll see them again. We will”
“Sam told me” she replied laughing
“Are you sure?” I called over to her
Michaels big eyes are taking in Cas’s face, “I sensed you, Cas”
I turned to Jack “Whenever you’re ready”
Rose called the boys in to help with the housework.
Jimmy’s eyes fill with tears as he says, “Goodbye, Dean,” and then Helen is driving away. The boys and Cas come down off the porch waving and calling goodbye.
It was a full 24 hours before Siobhan became fully awake. Her bandages had been changed every two hours with the four of them taking turns. Dean and I were with her when she woke.
“Póg mo Thóin Dean”.
Making my way over to him I ask, “Do you play?”
“Say what” I asked but I thought I had an inkling on what he was talking about.
A huffing sound over our shoulder breaks us apart, but Cas doesn’t address it. What he does address is the uneaten dinner sitting on Jimmy's table.
My stomach knots and my heart sinks, dreading what she will tell us.
“12 years”
“They had to cut Siobhan’s clothes off of her and I know she wouldn’t…………Jack trailed off
“Jack, the letter is private, it’s for Dean and Cas. I shouldn’t have read it. But apparently, she has feelings for both Dean and Cas and left to not come in between them.
Rosario is wary but finds she’s not frightened, merely curious.
SIOBHAN
Scrubbing my face with two hands, I lean forward in the chair, “Cas, all they listen to all day is parents trying to bullshit their way out of why Jonny is sporting another black eye or a broken wrist, or why the kid looks like he hasn’t eaten in a month. We need to come across confident and prepared. We can’t give them a reason to doubt us or we’re done”
The words just tumbled out of me in one long rush and now I paused teetering on a precipice, jump back or tumble over
She said it deadpan that had us all laughing, and I was looking forward to the rest of the evening.
I raised my eyebrows, “He talked” and Cas beamed at me with a nod.
I looked at my phone “Its 7am”
His eyes so like Cas’s, gazed at me unblinking but he nodded once. Feeling like I had achieved a major victory, I gave him the best smile I had.
Telling Jimmy about the baby monitor, I make it clear he is to get me if he’s worried about anything. I then lock up the house and make my way to the attic.
Cas and I speak about each of their personalities, their little quirks, the funny things they get up to, and I know I’m gushing a little over Jimmy from the looks that are being thrown my way. After I finish telling them the story about the walk on the beach with Jimmy, I can’t help the sigh that escapes, “I’m going to miss him”
Sam laughs ruefully, “Well if you had said anything else to me, I probably would have, but I saw you, Dean, when we were there, you loved that farm, loved Sonny, though you tried to hide it, and I know now how hard it was to leave back when you were a teenager. I’m not surprised you’re doing this”.
“What is it?” I asked
Cas’s tongue swirled in the shell of my ear, his hot breath panting, “You are so impatient” but he pulled his fingers out gently and batted my hand away from his cock, lining it up against my hole.
I don’t know why I believed him because everything he was telling me was just too fantastic, but I did.
Turning to look at the surrounding land that’s lush and wild with flowers, oak trees lining the perimeter of the property, I took a deep breath of late spring air, then turned to the man behind me.
Coming here, I had been trying to make my life a bit easier, more settled. Right.
Rowena started the incantation and threw the first of the ingredients into the pot. The smell of incense and cinnamon filled the air, as Rowena continued her incantation. I saw her throw another two ingredients into the pot, when the liquid in the pot started to shimmer and rise.
Dean.
Too busy smiling at Sam, I didn't see Eileen until she was clamped around me. Eileen may be a tiny thing, but she packs a lot into a hug that has me bending down and picking her up for the second time in a few minutes.
I was first through the door of the cabin. The girls were still up, and their glasses were full.
Cas just nodded still staring down at me.
There I said it.
“Thank you, Jack, thank you for Cas” I whispered to him still feeling so overwhelmed.
Alt Sam speaks up, with that smarmy look that never seems to leave his face “Is there any other kind?”
After Sam and Eileen leave, Cas and I sit up. Cas stands up to pick up our shirts. Handing me mine he says, “Wow that was good hearing on your part Dean. I didn’t hear them until the last second, I barely had time to get our shirts off. But it worked perfectly”
Michael always answered me when asked a question, but he had never initiated a conversation until now.
“Stop” I said. “Stop that now” I said going over to him and holding him by the shoulders “A date is a way to get to know someone, but we know Siobhan. We have had meals with her before, had long conversations, it’s just the nature of our relationship that has changed. Tonight, we catch up on each other, talk, laugh. We just enjoy each other Cas. That’s what it’s about.”
Dean sees the two girls look at them uncertainly; Dean rushes to reassure them, “Sorry, it’s just the longer we are out of Heaven, the blurrier the memories. Have to really concentrate on remembering”
I looked at him in surprise, “What did I do?”
I blew up “You stupid, crazy, exacerbating man….Angel whatever. Dean and Sam love you for you, not what you can do for them, Jack too. You have to tell them.
Sitting up in the bed, as the door opens, it takes me a second to process that it’s not Rose but Jimmy standing there.
Folding my hand around his, I wait until he looks up at me before speaking, “I’m sorry about what happened yesterday, Michael. I’m sure Cas has told you that too.
Naomi left me sitting there, trying to catch my breath. I felt I was doing that a lot lately but for crying out loud, I’m just a secretary thrown into this crazy supernatural world. Of course, I had to catch my breath every now and then.
It’s been two weeks since I stopped looking for someone to run it for him.
Alt Dean is now face palming behind Cas and it would be funny if Cas didn’t look like he would smite me where I stood, if he still could.
“Well well, what two handsome men you bring me Sonny, makes me almost sorry I don’t bat for your side” she said with a wink at us.
The air grows charged, and I curse myself. No one who knows this life has a happy story, “My sister. She……………………..”
“Dean it took hours for the spell to work and the Entity had all that time with her…”
Sonny and I both stared at Cas in disbelief with Sonny quickly turning to glance at me questionably, but Cas was staring at the boy with a completely bland expression except for that million-dollar blue stare until the boy actually started squirming “Ah no sir……no ah it wouldn’t”.
“Dean” Sam said “You and Cas, really?? You’re happy”
She's looking over my shoulder towards the door, but my question brings her attention back to me “Oh no everything is fine”
But in my head, I can see Jimmy laughing in the front seat of the Impala.
“Dean stop it’s me. Its Cas” I hear whispered softly.
I replied “I know”
I could hear Siobhan and Cas whispering to each other and I remembered the evening before. Even before the confession that had torn his soul apart, he had done it again, lost his temper with Siobhan. He was going to lose her if he kept this up. He could lose both of them.
But that day, Cas changed me too.
Outside, I nod at the deputy before making my way to the seating area opposite the nurse’s station, ignoring the look of concern from Jackie, who’s stationed there.
I wake before Cas in the morning, finding Jimmy’s eyes watching me before he glances away. I whisper, “Good Morning to him”, before shuffling off to the bathroom, grabbing my overnight bag to clean myself up for the day.
Damn Dean for seeing too much but then he always did except for one thing.
Helen smiles slightly at that, “I only took over his case on Friday evening and I’ve met him only a couple of times and yes, normally I would say your right, but the boys sang your praises here on Friday, I thought you should know that. And they are all good boys here, they’ll be gentle with him. Yes, I think this will be a good fit for Michael. With your permission, he’ll be here tomorrow. We will be transporting him straight from the hospital. He should arrive here about two in the afternoon”.
Michael tilts his head at me, and I smile wider, “The song you’re humming”
“You’re welcome Dean” Jack replied, and I swear I could feel his smile from where his face was buried in my shoulder.
“Who’s hungry?” I asked
“I think I can manage to feed a couple of extra people Dean” she gripes
Sam went towards the door but stopped. He turned and came back and pulled me into a bear hug.
I scrub my face with my left hand, my right hand still enfolded in Cas’s. He's an anchor while this rage boils inside me.
I then reached down and pulled Cas’s shirt from his pants and pulled it over his head. Both Dean and I stared at him. Well, he is a beautiful man.
“So, the black eyes didn’t do it for you?” Dean shot.
“Dean, it’s ok, you don’t have to explain. Growing old together implies a lifetime commitment- It’s ok if that’s not what you want” Cas offered, looking down, crestfallen.
“Cas?” he called softly.
Cas tilted his head and shot Dean a quizzical look.
He pulled his head back to watch the look that came across Cas’ face when he came. So damn gorgeous. So damn hot. And that was enough to make Dean come just then. Cas sensed him tensing. He splayed his hands over Dean’s ass, gripping tightly as Dean raised and thrusted, his body planked over Cas, giving way to a powerful orgasm.
“I know. Good thing you like dick though.”
“Jesus Cas, just say you wanna fuck. God,” Dean fussed, and threw himself back on the bed, his palm to his forehead.
“Just don’t confess your love for her right before the Blob takes you away forever,” Dean cracked, as he sauntered over to the stove.
“No. Really?” She mocked, as she looked toward the three faces around the table, all of them looking guilt stricken.
“Do you get it now?” Dean murmured.
“I know, I know, shut my cakehole. But honestly, stop being so sickeningly sweet then,” she retorted.
Dean threw up his hands, one holding the spatula, in the air and whined, “I cannot be expected to work under these abysmal conditions.”
“Me too,” Jack agreed.
A quiet smile slowly curled itself up on Cas’ lips.
Dean bore down and planted a burning kiss on Cas’ lips, his tongue darting between them. When Cas mercifully opened to him, two tongues wrestled each other achingly, licked at lips, pink and plump from heavily making out. Lips smashed together until they quivered, begging for more. Cas’ hands slipped down over Dean’s ass, gripping it tightly. Dean groaned in pleasure again as he thrust into Cas’ hips.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Hmmm. Human colloquialisms can be a hard concept to understand,” Cas said thoughtfully. “As for you…”
“C’mon, let’s go,” Dean said resolutely.
“I know I would love to watch you do some naked cooking, but I think we would break Sam and Eileen. And I don’t even want to think about the girls or Jack,” Dean chortled as he pinched Cas’ nipple.
Cas looked up, hearing Dean, then he chuckled too.
The vial was a clear quartz crystal with neon blue light inside. It was about the size of his pinky finger. Dean pulled the vial to his lips and kissed it before letting it fall in the cleft between his pecs.
“Hey!” Dean hollered, a smirk on his face. “Who’s being gross in front of the children now?” He chastised.
“Don’t! Do not believe those faces!” Dean pleaded, and signed frantically.
They stayed that way, grinding against each other, working each other into a slick frenzy. Dean hitched Cas’ leg over his hip. Cas tickled his fingers down to the small of Dean’s back and grabbed at his hips, pressing him tighter against his writhing cock. His hand trailed the muscle back up to Dean’s shoulders, then hugged Dean tight as they ground into one another. Dean found the sweet spot on Cas’ neck, using his tongue to trace firm infinity symbols, sucking and kissing at it wildly, wanting to leave his mark on Cas. He was Dean’s.
“Fine, take his side,” Dean mumbled, mimicking Cas’ statement. And then, under his breath, “Giving me the head tilt and the eyes.”
Since Jack, Sam and he had found a way to deal with Chuck, balance had been restored, and the world put back. Everyone Chuck had snapped out of existence, Jack had resurrected. Jack said he wouldn’t be a hands-on God, but he wasn’t just going to leave Cas in the Empty. It had been Cas who’d been instrumental in instigating Heaven’s redesign, after all. It had been Cas who’d taught Jack about life, about family, about love.
"I prefer the term oblivious. Less dumb, less ass."
“I could smite you, ya know,” Jack muttered.
Cas reached over and squeezed Dean’s hand.
“Why didn’t you ever say anything, Man?” Dean asked incredulously, running his fingers through his hair.
“Oh, I’m up!” Dean huffed.
It was deep into autumn of 2021, when Dean awoke from another nightmare in a cold sweat. He instinctively reached out for Cas to reassure him it was only a dream. Cas was there, peacefully sleeping, taking in soft, quiet breaths that Dean was relieved he could hear. He rested his hand lightly on Cas’ chest just long enough to feel his heart beating before pulling it back. Maybe Dean’s body had been still while he dreamt this time, if his mind was not. Maybe Cas had finally gotten used to Dean’s night thrashing and pained wails, and stayed asleep this time. Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to it.
“I just want you. But I want to make sure this is what you really want.” Dean lifted his eyebrows, and looked Cas in the eyes. “Is this what you really want?”
Dean pulled Cas into a huge hug, their cheeks pressed into the other’s necks. He held Cas until he relaxed his arms around Dean. Neither realizing it, they started to sway, ever so slightly. They stayed that way for a while, drifting, warm and content. Dean rubbed Cas’ back, trying to soothe him, trying to infuse his feelings for Cas into Cas. He wanted Cas to understand, to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt that Dean loves him, Dean’s in love with him. He’s Dean’s person, he’s Dean’s heart, his soul, he’s Dean’s everything. Cas is Dean’s home. Dean drank him in. His smell. His form. His heft. His skin. His heat. His heartbeat. It was so easy to get lost in him, swept away. When Dean felt like Cas had let the worry drain from him, he stepped back from their hug, sliding his hands down into Cas’.
Jack and Claire burst with laughter.
Just then, Jack pounded his fists on the table.
“In the beginning, feelings were new to me. I didn’t know what I was feeling, not really. I certainly didn’t understand it. Later on, I was never sure if you felt the same, and the fear of rejection or alienating you kept me from saying anything. I didn’t want to lose your friendship. After my deal with the Empty- Well, I couldn’t say anything on the off chance that you’d reciprocate. So, I contented myself with just being near you,” Cas explained.
“10-4, Good Buddy,” Dean confirmed, as he bent over to Cas’ neck to return the favor.
“What kind of a love fest did we just walk into?” Eileen signed as she spoke.
“I think we need to take more of our clothing off,” Cas said breathlessly.
“Are you truly good or are you just saying that to avoid talking about it?” Cas looked him directly in the eyes.
When Dean finally pulled the Impala into the gravel patch outside of the bunker, it was almost 11 o’clock at night. The sky was clear. The stars were out. Miracle was chomping at the bit to check out his new digs. Both Dean and Sam were exhausted, and Dean’s nerves were shot. He was trying to keep himself calm by reminding himself if Cas wasn’t there, he would go on. But he didn’t want to go on without Cas. Round and round with his emotions he went. Like a bad joke on the side of a cereal box, it was a vicious circle.
Dean had pulled Jack into a hug, kissed the top of his head, and said, “I love you, Kid. Thank you.”
Cas was always a great weapon as an angel, but he’d turned into an awesome hunter, and Dean loved working with him. They’d both noticed that together they moved as one fluid unit. Where one was stumbling, the other was there to catch the fall. It felt pretty great, even on the days without Sammy, to know the guy he was fighting side by side with had his back no matter what. Dean was that for Cas too.
“This is my grace, Dean,” he said.
“Cas? C’mere.”
Dean rolled back onto his left side, and got his blankets situated around him. It was 5 o’clock in the morning, but they’d had a late movie night last night, and Dean knew neither of them were about to get up at the ass-crack of dawn.
If he stopped to think about it, the dream wasn’t all bad. The dog. The pie. The vamp-mimes. Even the highlight reel of Sam’s life. But the Empty taking Cas? That still scared the Hell out of Dean. Never getting to tell him how he felt, that he was loved? That shook him to his very core. Telling Sammy goodbye while they both ugly cried? Like a knife to the heart. Dying on a rusty nail? What the actual fuck! John fucking Winchester living right next door? Anger rose in his throat and his hands at the thought. Not seeing Cas again in Heaven? That killed Dean the most.
“I love you, Cas,” he whispered dreamily. “I always have.”
Cas was sprawled out in one of the comfy chairs in the library. His trench coat and suit jacket had been neatly arranged over the chair beside him. His sleeves were rolled up over crossed arms, and his feet were propped up on a captain’s chair he’d pulled out from the table. There was a hitch in Dean’s throat when he saw him. Cas’ head slumped over onto his right shoulder. He’d fallen asleep.
“I had the dream again,” Dean said nonchalantly.
“Ya, ya, I’m down,” Claire said.
There had been a tearful goodbye to Sammy. Afterward, Dean went to Heaven where he got to have a bad beer with Bobby, and his father lived just down the road. In the meantime, Sam vacantly went on about his life with a blurry wife. The two had a kid in overalls with “Dean” obnoxiously emblazoned in bright yellow on his front pocket. There had been a photoshopped picture of Sam, Dean, and their parents front and center on the mantle. Sam got old and wore a bad wig before dying, then met Dean in Heaven.
The bunker had become a safe place to land for any hunter. They were always welcome to stay as long as they wanted, and to come and go as they pleased, as long as they did a daily check in. Nowadays, the bunker was always a bustling hub. Claire and Alex were frequent visitors. So, were Charlie and Stevie, and Bobby. Donna and Jody visited when they could too. Hell, they even saw Rowena and Ketch every couple of months. She’d done a spell to bring Arthur back from the dead, since he’d already been in Hell anyway, and they’d been happily dating these many months. Krissy had been spending a lot of time with Jack when they were both around. Dean had actually described it to Cas as cute. And Jack...Well, he was just busy being a kid, taking in everything he learned like a sponge.
“Awww, boo!” Jack hissed.
Cas stirred slowly. When he opened his eyes, they immediately found Dean’s own staring back at him. Cas pulled his feet back from the chair they’d been propped up on.
“Good thing I love you mooks,” Dean said cattily, trying not to sound happy about it.
Dean rolled his eyes and pointed his spatula at her.
“I do, Dean.”
“Getting to know you over these many years together has added another layer, and I started to long for you, not yet realizing that I was in love with you. By the time I had surmised my feelings for you, I didn’t believe you felt the same. It was only after I made the deal with Empty to save Jack, that I really started to wonder if you loved me in return. But not wanting to give you up, I could never tell you the truth. It became an impossible situation,” Cas finished.
Dean gaped, eyes wide, and for a moment Cas thought he might yell, or tell him to leave, or punch him even, but then, his gaze softened. He swallowed hard, and covered Cas’ grace, his own hand resting gently atop Cas’.
Dean groaned and rolled his eyes.
“Well, I wanted to wake you up. That was the needy part of me, the selfish part of me. But I guess the stronger part of me looked at you lying there all peaceful, and I wanted to let you stay that way. I still put my hand on you to make sure you were real and breathing. God, I never want to lose you again,” Dean let out a heavy sigh.
Cas, who was standing in front of Dean’s desk, said, “I’d like you to try the thing you’d like to try, but I think we’re also going to have to have a conversation. So, perhaps some sort of compromise, or maybe both options?”
Worst of all, he hasn’t touched Dean all day, and Dean is realizing how accustomed he became to the hugs, the kisses, and the casual contact. Without it, there’s a physical ache in his chest. Castiel wasn’t even this distant when they were only friends.
The ex-angel only grabbed a fistful of the hunter's shirt and pulled himself up more. His lips brushed against Dean's ear, in a way that probably would have been intimate had the person doing it not been drunk and uncoordinated.
“Then you need to have a complicated talk with Cas. Look, Dean,” Sam says as he butters his unholy breakfast bagel. “This is what relationships are. A lot of hard, uncomfortable conversations. You’re always gonna hate them, but you have them so you can get to the good moments. Letting shit fester never ends well.”
“Oh? Okay, what’s up?” Charlie was still cheery, but her tone turned more serious.
They were about halfway through when a loud coughing nearby startled the ex-angel. He jumped closer to Dean, right into him actually, before forcing himself to calm down.
Dean shook his head, though he knew why Cas would think that. Benny was the closest friend he’d had in years. They fought together for a year, trusted each other with their lives. You can only do that for so long with someone before they become important to you.
Sam nodded. It made sense. Emanuel, Cas, whoever he was, was still an angel, of course he could heal people. The fact that he didn't know who he really was, or what he had done... That was a more difficult topic to broach just yet. Maybe Cas would remember when he saw Dean? A nagging voice in the back of the hunter's mind traitorously whispered; “What if he doesn't?” Sam tried not to think of that possibility. How would this affect Dean if he found out Cas was alive, but didn't remember anything? Would he get worse?
“Is this a leftover angel thing?”
**********
“We watch Netflix, make out, play games- speaking of which, we gotta teach Cas how to hustle. The dude has an unbeatable poker face.”
“Dean.” Sam supplied, watching the angel out of the corner of his eye for a possible reaction. There was none.
“Why I still have his trench coat.”
“Really?” The tentative hope in Castiel’s voice made Dean’s heart ache.
Dean finishes rinsing the elements and sets them on a dishtowel to dry.
“I don't feel like a bad person.” he finally said.
“......Alright.”
He wasn't quite sure what had caused his brother's new behaviour, but he was concerned. He knew Dean better than anyone, and he knew something was seriously off.
"Cas?" Dean asked in a shaky, scared voice. "Cas, oh god. Cas, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Dean hesitated.
“Wait. Hoe-ah-th?” Dean asked, directing his question to Cas, his ears and cheeks reddening futher with embarrassment. He should have recognized that word instantly. Thankfully, Castiel didn't look hurt by the hunter's slip up, he only nodded to confirm what Dean had already figured out.
For now, Cas abandoned the visual feast before him to crawl back up along Dean’s body. When their lips met, it was like the touch breathed movement back into Dean’s lungs. He exhaled, and his hands came up, holding Cas in a tight hug.
Dean shrugs. “It was years ago.”
