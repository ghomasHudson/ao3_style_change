— Сломана левая ключица, — достал из чемоданчика плазменный скальпель, вскрыл плоть, силовыми щипчиками соединил смещенные части перелома и приварил кости.
And a diamond tiara. On his chest hangs in a dim gilded chain that the locket... this COP in the face changed and became to crowded for her, and we followed him. Came up, introduced himself, and the COP casually asks about the locket. As the Senator explains, they say, this locket was given to her by her brother.... Well, the policeman and posted what I knew. The Senator was indignant like, what are you talking about. Well, I also added, and the General said that it was his daughter. Well, we probably would have fought, but here in Windows and doors rushed the men in black uniforms. Began shooting, crashing, everything is overcast with smoke. A complete mess. Police have pushed, snatching the revolver. I fell to the floor. General near me. All this commotion lasted for about an hour. Then everything calmed down. Rise up from the floor, looking around. The General sits on the floor, no,  - the old man closed his eyes, remembering — he stood on his knees near the officer. This guy was killed. Two shots to the chest. And in his left hand was clutching a medallion with a dangling chain. Hand rested in a pool of coagulated blood ejected from the body of the Senator. I took out the locket and took himself, and the General both buried next to their relatives. There you are, granddaughter.
— Rúguǒ wǒmen shāle tā, jǐngfāng jiāng zuò zài wǒmen de wěiba! (If we kill him, the police will sit on us!)
— Это совершенно неважно, — отмахнулся Дайсуке, — только ты не думай, что я тебя оставлю на попечение этот парня. Я тоже стану твоим телохранителем.
— За лейтенанта не беспокойся, — ответил Дайсуке, — я передал ему весточку. Я… думаю, что Мик сейчас пытается освободится от наркотика, введённого в него. А поскольку наркотик новый, то и реакция на него может быть необычной…
Мик высадил Снежану на остановке, проследил за её посадкой и двинул на работу. Не успел он отъехать, затрезвонил мобильник. Мик включил громкую связь.
— Мик! Вставай! — Дайсуке тянул приятеля наружу. Мик не сопротивлялся. Он был никакой. Дайсуке снял с себя куртку и завернул друга в неё. Мик приоткрыл глаза.
— И что? Некоторые частные ищейки этим и занимаются. Сменишь вывеску и все, — Мик улыбнулся, — подумай, потом скажешь, что надумал. Пока, — и пошел вниз, пробираясь меж камней.
— Понятно, — Лу повернулся к трем вдрызг пьяным типам, сидящих за дальним столиком, — давайте выметайтесь.
— Он там спит или отсутствует? — Макс посмотрел на Мика, — что делать будем? Домой пойдем или дверь вышибем?
— Я телепортировался к Джорджине, а потом спрятался между мирами. Мне надо было подумать, что делать дальше, — ответил Мик, — проблемы были таковы, что я не мог вас бросить на произвол судьбы, но вернуться я тоже не мог. Я подумал, отдохнул и начал проводить расследование. И тот тип, похожий на китайца, вовсе не китаец. А кто он? Трудно сказать…
— Nǐ wèishéme bǎ tā dài dào zhèlǐ? Kěyǐ shā sǐ tā (Зачем ты привез его сюда? Можно было прикончить его там).
— Нет, — глухо ответил Мик, — я… просто побуду один, — сглотнул, — через пару часов я начну работать.
- Corner of Palm Street and Elm Avenue. And exactly in the wastebasket find the corpse. This is not only a corpse and skeleton. Without a head,-Steve stared at Mick`s-, like this case.
- Drop your weapons!!!! -  type, raising the gun - and then everyone here will take! I have a hostage!!
— Но тебе бы пришлось туго, — закончила фразу Снежана, — а что это было, когда нас стала пожирать энергия элементов? Я помню твои крылья и сверкающий свет…
Сонота вскочила на ноги и подошла к маленькому холодильнику рядом со стойкой. Она открыла его, достала лоток и принесла отцу.
Descended, but already there is all and Sundry — experts, police, CSU. Max passed the Chinese patrol and went to the car. On the step sits Mick, from a nose blood flows, and look otherworldly. Max snorted angrily and began to wipe away the blood.
— Вижу Мика, — сообщил спустя пять минут, — только он очень плохо просматривается. То ли спит, то ли без сознания.
— Моя дочь пропала! — всхлипывая, сказала полная женщина в наглухо застёгнутом сиреневом плаще. С плаща текло, оставляя на полу лужи.
Мик по-прежнему вел себя насторожено и дико. На все расспросы Макса он не отвечал, мгновенно замыкаясь в себе.
Лейтенант пришел раньше всех. Он выглядел встревоженным и как только очутился в участке, велел дежурному позвонить ему тогда, когда придет детектив Макс Тански. Макс тоже пришел рано. Перед ним пришли Карл и Джерри, но они быстро ушли. На них висело дело о бытовом убийстве в небоскребе на Априкот-стрит. Ребята они были дотошные и в скором времени рассчитывали закончить.
А через год. Я уже вышел в отставку и генерал в отставке тоже. И приглашают нас на какой-то благотворительный вечер к некому сенатору. Мы туда приходим и видим полицейского, мужа Сноу. Он то ли в охране, то ли телохранителем, я не помню. Вечер начался. Выходит сенатор и его супруга. Господь всемогущий — Сноу! Вся такая строгая, красивая и непреступная. И в бриллиантовой тиаре. А на груди висит на тусклой золоченой цепочке вот этот медальон… Полицейский этот в лице изменился и стал проталкиваться к ней, а мы за ним. Подошли, представились, и полицейский как бы невзначай спрашивает про медальон. А сенатор объясняет, мол, этот медальон достался ей от брата.… Ну, полицейский и выложил все, что знал. Сенатор возмутился типа, что ты мелешь. Ну, я тоже добавил, и генерал сказал, что это его дочь. Ну, мы бы, наверное, подрались, но тут в окна и двери ворвались люди в черном обмундировании. Началась стрельба, грохот, все заволоклось дымом. Полная неразбериха. Полицейский нас оттолкнул, выхватывая револьвер. Я упал на пол. Генерал — рядом со мной. Весь этот переполох длился где-то около часа. Потом все успокоилось. Подымаюсь с пола, оглядываюсь. Генерал сидит на полу, нет, — старичок прикрыл глаза, вспоминая, — стоял он на коленях около этого полицейского. Парень этот был убит. Два выстрела в грудь. А в левой руке был зажат медальон с оборванной цепочкой. Рука покоилась в луже свернувшейся крови, вытекшей из тела сенатора. Я медальон вынул и себе забрал, а генерал похоронил обоих рядом со своими родственниками. Вот такие дела, внучка.
— «…в некоторых местах новых городов на Новой Земле находят некие артефакты, принадлежащие давно вымершей расе жившей на этой планете. Я был свидетелем того, как рабочие, строившие дом, выкопали из-под земли стелу метра два в длину и метр в ширину. Она была сделана из неизвестного металла и блестела так, как будто только что вышла из рук кузнеца. Я внимательно осмотрел её и увидел, что она покрыта неким подобием клинописи. Но в тот момент я не знал этого языка и поспешил передать стелу в музей „Исчезнувшие Цивилизации“. Через некоторое время я нашел способ прочесть надпись на стеле. И там была история о чудище Гу-ЧиЗхуЗай-Юйянь — Де-Хехинг или Куа-Хи-аан. И чудище это имело алтарь свой, до которого надо было пройти портал. И если от Новой Земли под углом 90 градусов провести линию, а потом от той планеты под углом 45 градусов еще одну, и от третьей — по 36 градусов третью, то четвертая планета будет та, на которой живет чудище. И имя ему — Пожиратель костей…».
— Недалеко от фабрики патрульные пятнадцатого и двадцатого участков нашли пять тел. Они были разбросаны на территории расстоянием в три квартала. Двое — в квартирах. Вооружены — первый — французской 7,5-миллиметровой винтовкой FR-F1, второй — 7,62-миллиметровой M24. Один засел на чердаке, второй — в пустующей квартире. Обоих сняли при помощи М16. Двое на улице. Вооружены — первый — полуавтомат HK PSG1, второй — российским ВСС «Винторез». Этих убрали при помощи M500. И одного нашли в машине. У него был пистолет пулемет Ingram MAC-10, и пристрелили этого умника из Colt Python 357 Magnum. Сейчас пытаемся установить, кто это был…
Flared sconces over the bed, and Mick have clearly seen the three letters on the reverse side of the medallion – S. A. M.
На улице было мерзко. Мик вырулил с подъездной дорожки на шоссе и поехал в Лос-Анджелес. Он всегда выезжал с запасом времени. До города километров тридцать, и в городе пробки, несмотря на рань. Потоки воды перехлестывали через дорогу, срываясь со скалистого обрыва. Джип уверенно преодолевал все эти препятствия.
Когда эти люди скрылись из виду, ребята спустились к сгоревшей хижине. Они стояли и плакали. Потом Дайсуке нарушил молчание.
- Okay, - Mick hung the raincoat on a hook and went upstairs. She opened the shop, sat down at the table and opened the folder with the case of skinned skeletons. So its rest and found. The Lieutenant patted Mick`s on the shoulder, but said nothing, and Max brought mug of tea.
- Hell, - Mick craned his neck and looked at Jamuel`s, — call an ambulance, maybe he's still alive, and don't forget the experts to call.
— То-то же, — Дайсуке потянулся, — сейчас я позвоню хорошему человеку и посмотрю, что я могу еще для тебя сделать.
Из Джорджины выплеснулись серо-бело-черные ленты и закрутили её в плотный кокон. Потом кокон растаял и…. Джорджина была одета в белоснежный пеплос до земли. Пояс — черный, кольца, держащие пеплос на плечах — серые. Прическа — высокая, пепельные волосы заплелись в косы и собрались в высокую башню. Джорджина сомкнула правую ладонь, и в ней соткался жезл. Длинный, выше Джо, на конце шар из трех полумесяцев — черного, белого и серого. Джорджина стукнула жезлом об землю, и крикнув:
- Everything can be... - Mick has left from the direct answer, - two hours before the meeting. Went to the station.
- But Jen didn't call me. I was a little concerned. But it's been three days and Jen is not the hearing, not the spirit. I, naturally, called Catarina, and it turns out that the girls didn't come home, both of you. Then I met Katarina. We live in neighbouring streets and, after discussing the situation, went to the house where the party was being held. And the mother of Snoopy Laluka, the guy in the house, which all this was carried out, also do not know. He and Snoopy had disappeared.
— Ладно, — еле слышно проговорил Дайсуке, — спи. Когда проснешься — твоя еда будет ждать тебя на столе.
The boys sat down and stared at the Lieutenant. He laid on the table a lot of holography and invited their investigators to see them. They began to watch. Fifteen minutes later, the Lieutenant asked cautiously:
— Зачем? Я виноват, что бросил вас и исчез, но больше этого не повторится. Хотя может быть, я и исчезну, только ненадолго, — Мик приоткрыл один глаз, — не успеете соскучиться.
— Полиция Лос-Анджелеса. Детективы Меллоун и Тански, — ребята сунули под нос типу свои удостоверения.
Мик выбрал мясо на косточке, чай и один пончик с черничным кремом. Макс ограничился парой гамбургеров, картошкой фри и кофе. Сидят, едят. Никого не трогают. Закусочная маленькая, народу мало. Обстановка не притязательная, фон что-то пищит за стеной, на визоре — новости. Сидят парни, только челюсти шевелятся. Жуют. И только Мик стал чай пить, а Макс свое кофе допивать, прямо в стекло витрины со всего маху ГРУЗОВИК! Неизвестно куда он целил и, вообще, куда водитель ехал, но эта огромная махина снесла полстены и пять столиков, что оказались на пути. После чего уперся в стойку и остановился. Но все, кто за столиками, погибшими под колесами, сидел, остались живы. Мало того, они сидели и жевали, пребывая в шоковом состоянии. Макс смотрел на Мика. Тот допивал чай. Грузовик пролетел за спиной Макса, и до сих пор там стоял.
Раненых — пятнадцать человек, включая двух официанток. Парни сидели на приступке скорой. Вернее, Мик сидел, а Макс стоял рядом.
Дайсуке и Макс прибыли на место встречи раньше всех. Они расположились на морском кране, вооружились тепловизорами и стали рассматривать окрестности.
— Не знаю, — растерянно ответил Джек, — и это мне не нравится. Ладно, — Джек принял решение, — всем внимание! Входим в ресторан!
- Is a thousand enough for you, in small denominations - decided Mick, considering the paper. One pile, which was exactly one thousand as hundred-dollar bills, he gave Snezhana, and took with him five hundred. Closed the safe.
— Лейтенант Старки! Это вы? — из глубин большого кресла раздался скрипучий голос, звук которого заставил Мика вздрогнуть.
- The case itself is simple and I think I shouldn't interfere in it, but the motive these Chinese are very, very unusual.
— Один момент, — Кабаяши встал и ушел в направлении служебного выхода. Через пару минут вернулся и положил на стол стопочку черно желтых визиток. Мик взял одну в руки и внимательно осмотрел. На визитке была нарисована улыбающаяся черная курица, державшая крыльями желтую ленту, на которой было написано — «Свежее мясо от братьев Чанг по доступным ценам». С обратной стороны стоял адрес — Сурф — стрит. 114.
— Да? — Мик посмотрел по карте. Они подъезжали к очередному ломбарду, — ты бы себе кого-нибудь здесь нашел?
Когда скрипение Макса достигло крещендо, Мик повернул машину к обочине, остановился и вылез под дождь, в чем был — черная кожанка, черные джинсы, черные берцы. Макс заткнулся и теперь молча взирал на то, как Мик проходит вдоль машины и опирается о передний бампер. И тут откуда-то возник голос, слегка хриплый, но очень сердитый:
— Ты, моя милая, ввязалась в свистопляску. — Джорджина провела пальцем по серьгам. — Но вы с Миком похожи. Он тоже ввязывается в страшнейшие свистопляски. Но я тебе помогу. У тебя есть адрес.
Дайсуке сел. Макс включил свет и посмотрел на своего гостя. Тот был одет в черную куртку, джинсы, берцы. Бородка воинственно торчала, черные глаза внимательно смотрели на Макса.
— Привет, Мик! Привет, Макс! — поздоровалась Джо, — мы пришли, как только получили сообщение от Дианы. Можно вас поздравить. Вы только что закрыли дело о пропавших людях и человеческом мясе в ресторанах! Статья выйдет в утреннем выпуске.
— Просто замечательно, — Мик потянулся к куртке, достал голографии и разложил их на столе, — сможете кого-нибудь тут опознать?
— А вот тут и начинается его странные пристрастия, — улыбнулась Джо, — во-первых, он себя считает истинным арийцем в черт знает каком поколении. Во вторых, каждый год в один и тот же день, в один и тот же час, мистер фон Зибельрштейн уже десять лет верит, что если он будет заниматься сексом с молоденькой чистокровной арийкой, то, в конце концов, он на выходе получит реинкарнацию Адольфа Гитлера.
— Да вот какое дело, я тут услышал, что тебя ЗАКАЗАЛИ. Да и никому-либо, а Голго 13. Вот такие дела, Мик! Ты кого-нибудь узнал?
- Yeah, the style of the drunken crane, holding in the paws of a drunken pig and pickled snake in its beak.
Got up, washed, shaved, ate, and went to work. The work was fun. Mick came when Carl was preparing to talk about his scary complicated investigation.
- They are gone, — said Mick, — this morning found her, - Mick was postponed holography Ruddy, - only as a skeleton. Skinned and fresh.
— Щетина отрастет, — улыбнулся Мик, — по легенде Джека, я нигде не работаю… А неработающий человек не бреется.
— Слушай, а у меня есть предложение, — Мик поднялся на ноги и посмотрел на Дайсуке, — переходи с той стороны на эту. Я тебе обеспечу удостоверение, и будешь работать частным сыщиком.
— Конечно, молодой человек, — старушка пронзительно посмотрела на Мика, — второй этаж, квартира четыре. А вы, как я погляжу, из полиции?
— Шерл?! — Джо встряхнула Шерлока за плечи, но это не возымело действия. Тогда она достала из пустоты длинный шприц с чем-то и ловко поставила укол в локтевой сгиб.
— Вот как? — повторил Мик, — значит, бесплатно? Хорошо. Только позволь тебе напомнить, что у меня могут быть неприятности…
— Не очень. Барт как мог, воссоздал портрет этого азиата, но получилось паршиво. Под это описание подходит пять азиатов. Трое умерли, один находится в космосе, а последний проживает в Чайна-тауне и отзывается на имя Ли Ху Хунг. Знаешь такого?
— Знаете, — Иванс встал, поставил на огонь чайник и принялся собирать немудреные харчи, — возьмите меня с собой.
— Дорогая моя, я занимаюсь язычеством еще со школы, — покровительственно ответила Джо, — я все знаю.
Мик спал или сидел на скале, разглядывая в бинокль равнину. Дайсуке и Макс тренировались, чистили оружие и обсуждали планы. Место было тихое. Спокойное. Свежий воздух давал возможность подумать о вечном.
— Нет. Дядя… раздобыл его, играя в карты, — племянница задумчиво уставилась на парней, — куб… был… живым. Если вы понимаете, о чем я.
— Интересно, — бесстрастно ответила она, — но тут нестыковки. Понимаете, я думаю, что капище стоит неправильно, поэтому все, что тут происходило, не имеет силы. На этом месте вообще не стоило делать. Вот на пять метров левее, видите там, у дубов верх ярко-зеленый, а нижние ветви засыхают, проходит разлом. Так вот разломы, дают силу заклинаниям, а тут ничего нет.
— Dàgē! Bù! (Брат! Нет!)  — закричал второй. Пока он что-то делал, Мик этого не видел, а Макс подошел к нему и развязал. Мик вскочил на ноги. Китаец стоял над чернеющим провалом в полу и что-то кричал, потом он развернулся. В его руках тускло блеснули лезвия нескольких ножей:
Margaret was a small, plump, where necessary, a girl with curly blond hair, green eyes and jaws bow.
— Мясо вкусное, сладковатое на вкус, мне понравилось оно, просто богом так дано. Я котлетку съел одну и в нирвану так нырнул, захотелось мне еще… — тип стал раскачиваться и нести вообще несусветную чушь. Из всего текста четко было слышно слово «котлетки».
Дайсуке вернулся в город на первой попутке. Опять пришел к дому большого босса и болтался рядом целый день, не спуская взгляда с двери. Ночью, когда к большому боссу пришли гости, Дайсуке последовал за ними.
In the lobby showed a pseudo ancient old woman who the old lady was not at all. Android class "O". The androids of this class have been focused on the role of butlers, nannies and any such profession, in which the older you look, the more impressive. Pseudo old woman was sitting in a big easy chair and enthusiastically knitting. She was dressed in a simple black dress, all closed. On the skull cap, from under it knocked out gray curls.
— Ладно, мы здорово уклонились от темы нашего сюда прихода, — Джо посмотрела на Иванса, — когда мы сможем получить информацию?
— А служба внутреннего расследования решила по-другому. Все. Мне безумно жаль, что Мик погиб, но на этом я прекращаю расследование.
— Ну, теперь он канцелярская крыса в бюро. Звонит и говорит — проблемы у тебя, лейтенант. Я спрашиваю — какие? А он мне — заказали твоего детектива. Которого? Мика, говорит, заказали. И не просто заказали, а наняли очень крупного специалиста в этом деле, — лейтенант подошел к столу, нажал пару кнопок на виртуальной клавиатуре, и над столешницей развернулась голография. Азиат, скорее всего японец. Лицо непроницаемо. Квадратный подбородок, но с ямочкой. Прямой нос. Сжатый рот. Черные глаза. Взгляд суровый, пронзительный. Черные брови — у переносицы широкие, к вискам — узкие. Как раз брови домиком.
— Да, — отозвался Мик, лежа на другой скамейке, — только, ты заметил, что из тридцати пропавших, пятнадцать просто пропали, а остальных до поры можно было встретить в ресторанах, а потом они резко исчезали.
— Потому что эта вещь идет по нелегальным путям и вскоре будет куплена воротилой из Чикаго. Но эта вещь сыграет определенную роль в судьбе Мика. Он вспомнит.
— Ой. Бедный, ты, наверное, испугался и переживал за меня? Прости. Мне надо было позвонить тебе, да руки никак не дошли.
— Ты же — Мик Меллоун? Правда?! — сероглазый был в полном замешательстве. В его глазах плескалась жалость и растерянность.
22 января выдалось тихим и теплым. Мик вышел в коридор и посмотрел в зеркало. Оттуда на него взглянула небритая физиономия. Очень небритая, с четырехдневной щетиной, со свисающей на один глаз челкой. Мик довольно хмыкнул и осмотрел свою одежду. Синяя мятая рубашка, черная куртка-безрукавка с неоновым метеоритом на спине, черные джинсы и берцы. Цикл преобразился в нечто крутое и зловещее. Но на самом деле цикл никак не поменялся, он просто поставил очень хорошую иллюзию. Мик надел черные очки, вывел цикл и поехал на встречу.
Разговаривая, парни выехали из гаража полицейского участка и отправились по заданному маршруту. Барт предоставил всю информацию, извлеченную из кристаллов, но момента убийства на них было, зато очень четко можно было различить импозантного азиата в дорогом костюме. Данный тип всегда держался так, что его лицо проглядывалось крайне плохо. Он был и на записях из музея, и на записях из особняка. Барт сказал, что над установлением личности этого типа он поработает. И поэтому парни отправились устанавливать путь похищенных скульптур до попадания в музей и частную коллекцию.
— From what side to look, — said Mick, — the state pays us for that we had to clean the city from those whom the state does not pay for the dirty work. Although... there are people there, who also live in the contentment of the state, only one does not advertise it.
— Потому что мы — обыватели! Если террорист нас увидит, он ничего не поймет, а, увидев людей в форме или с выправкой спец агента, может занервничать.
— … я тебе вот что скажу, Снежана, — продолжила разговор Джо, — я поняла, куда тебе надо, — она вытащила блокнот, — 3151842544 — 8113151114117611619121 — 2211814811315141951, «где святой Андрей и святой Пол встречаются». Значит так, Caeahdbedd — Haacaeaaadaagfaafaiaba — bbaahadhaacaedaiea
— Пока нет, — ответила Снежана, — пусть пообвыкнет у нас, а потом я найду, куда он больше подходит. Но, посмотри, — она перевернула медальон обратной стороной верх, — что тут нацарапано.
Mick went to the car and felt that Max, deliberately or accidentally, touched his back with his hand. Without turning around, Mick said:
— Ну, ты и смельчак, — Мик улыбнулся Берту и, распечатав показания, подсунул на подпись, — проверь и подпишись.
- A couple of days, - replied Mick and began poking around in black garbage bags. At the top, nothing was. The usual garbage, but the bottom... Mick found two longer bags and pulled them out.
— Да. Я перекачала их на кристальный диск, а потом на свои серьги, — Снежана сняла свои сережки и положила их на стол.
Не успели парни проехать пару кварталов, опять случилось непредвиденное. На тротуар перед маленьким филиалом резервного банка выскочил растрепанный тип в кожаном костюме. Он размахивал ружьем и волок мешок. Ребята ехали мимо и увидели все это. Мик направил джип на неизвестного, тот резко обернулся и выстрелил в лобовое стекло, но пуля чиркнула по стеклу и улетела в некуда. Тип, бросив мешок, стал пятиться. Пятился, пятился и, развернувшись, рванул в неизвестном направлении.
— Ты ранен, — Макс держал друга за плечо, — полежишь в больнице, —, но тут Макс почувствовал, что температура тела напарника стала повышаться. Перевел глаза на рану. Кровь, текшая из раны, стала пузыриться. Мик закатил глаза, и по его телу прошла судорога. После неё Мик обмяк. Макс вновь послушал сердце. Оно билось. Рана подсохла и как бы затянулась. Мик вдруг затрясся в судорожном кашле. Макс перевернул его лицом вниз и немного приподнял. Мик кашлял, кашлял и, наконец, выплюнул багровые сгустки крови. Оперся об асфальт и измученно улыбнулся напарнику.
- "Hmm," - thought Mick, - "Daisuke had brought someone. And that someone is very confident, but dangerous as well. Like a wild animal, like a tiger. Yes, tiger. Who is he?"
— Затем, что вас надо было выводить из игры. Я забрал у вас оружие, разрядил его, приготовил ваши рюкзаки. Я рассчитывал, что вы побежите мне на помощь, но когда сообразите, что оружия у вас нет, притормозите. Вы так и сделали.
— Мы тут не одни, — ответил Макс, — в метрах пятистах от нас, стоит человек. На нем отражатели. Он светится холодным голубоватым светом.
— Я не помню, — растеряно ответил Мик, — я… не был в Лондоне. Вы меня спутали. Да, вы меня просто спутали. Парней по имени Мик много в городе.
— We're confiscating... of video of this object, -  that Mick put out his hand over the crystals,  - the Manager allowed.
— Особо опасных веществ мы не обнаружили, а вот качество продуктов нас смущает. Мы ВСЕ изъяли. Теперь ваша очередь.
— А я, пожалуй, начну собираться на работу. Сегодня к дождю прибавился ураганный ветер с океана. Надо пораньше выйти.
— Что это у тебя за гость был? — поинтересовался лейтенант, прищурив синие глаза. По фактическому возрасту лейтенанту было далеко за семьдесят, а по нынешнему — выглядел лет на сорок. Он, в принципе, мог выглядеть гораздо моложе, но хотелось авторитета. И поэтому сорок лет были для него нормой. Тем более практически все, кроме Карла и Джерри, выглядели как будто только что закончили полицейскую академию.
А в это время Шерлок и Джон проводили проверку в космопорте Города Ангелов. Удостоверения у них были, всеми подписанные и с большим количеством важных печатей. Проверка заключалась в следующем — парни изымали сыпучие пищевые продукты из рациона пилотов и пассажиров. Сахар, соль, сухие сливки — все, что Джорджина обозначила, самым подозрительным катализатором. Потом это должно было вывезено за город и испробовано в качестве взрывчатых веществ.
And Mick and Max arrived to the factory of the Chang brothers. There reigned the confusion. People in protective suits epidemiological darted back and forth, measured, folded samples. The staff headed by the owners tried to defend the products. The cops inside were not allowed, and they went to wander around the neighborhood. After a quick inspection of the site was a ravine, and ravine - black bags, and bags of bones. There were many of them. Max called experts. Those came and looked at the dice, unloaded the van and left. The boys returned to the main entrance. The lab was preparing to leave, noticing the detectives, came to a little astronomy type.
— Статический шар — в бой! — взлетела в небо. На спине Джо раскрылись два белоснежных крыла. Стало видно, что на ногах у Джо типа греческих сандалий, а пояс имеет две ленты почти до подола. Свет застыл, вместе с обломками.
— Круто мы разделались с этими типами, — сказал Макс, попивая кофе, — и отчасти благодаря тебе. А куда тебя унесло из хижины?
— Then I'm with you,  -  decided Max, -  one is not supposed to leave you in the lurch. Only if the Chinese should not find, I want you to Park next to the Parking lot or the bar.
Извиваясь как гусеница, Мик боднул китайца с ножом. Тот отступил, Мик боднул его еще раз. Китаец нелепо взмахнул руками, обо что-то споткнулся и рухнул навзничь.
The precinct was quiet. The guys went straight to the expert in audio-video materials. Unlike typical programmers, Bart Snor looked very intelligent. Such a high, six-foot fellow with brown hair, mustache, eyes and quixotic beard. His clothing consisted of quite an indeterminate color sweater and black jeans.
— All elements got out for a nice day, -  replied Max, gradually regaining the form, -  that order as valid?
— А. Ну, да. Держать друга на мушке, у меня вроде как не было, нет. Было. Но там по договоренности. Мы с Люпен пару раз стрелялись, но там другое дело. Потому что револьвер и вальтер — это ближний бой, а снайперская винтовка — первый раз. И мне было так плохо, когда я увидел в оптическом прицеле тебя…
В участке было тихо, только лейтенант шуршал бумажками в своем кабинете. Когда Мик проходил по коридору к лифтам, его насторожило выражение лица дежурного офицера. Оно выражало тревогу, и в его взгляде была жалость.
Допрос китайца закончился только к часу следующего дня. Лейтенант посмотрел на своих замученных детективов и велел им выметаться.
— А у него было дело и пришлось пообщаться с дядюшкой Вонгом. Консенсуса они не достигли, Роджера вышвырнули. Роджер вернулся на закате дня. Вставил телохранителям, забрал дядюшку, приволок на самый большой небоскреб и пригрозил — не скажешь, что мне надо — упадёшь, и хрен тебя соберут… Дядюшка Вонг пошел на попятную и всю информацию Роджеру выдал. Теперь он очень вежлив с тринадцатым участком, то есть с нами. Сам мог заметить, все перестрелки и разборки китайцев происходят где угодно, только не на нашей территории.
— Да, после того, как мы забросали хижину гранатами и кумулятивными ракетами, там даже тараканы сгорели.
— Мне кажется, что дядюшка Вонг имеет в этом деле интерес. Если мы и пойдем в Чайна-таун, то своими силами будем искать этого товарища.
— Мы разрабатываем торговцев «Радужными Снами». Сейчас они продаются маленькими пакетиками, похожими на пакетики Скиттлс, но недавно мы узнали, что в город должна поступить очень большая партия наркотиков. Около десяти тон различной дряни. И в Управлении решили, что лучше всего переловить всех наиболее значимых торговцев и заменить их оперативниками. Все бы хорошо, но кто-то слил информацию, и мы не смогли поймать первого. А потом и остальных. Один раз — провал — может быть случайность, но когда это повторяется с каждым разом… Естественно появились подозрения, что в наших рядах завелся крот. Глава управления велел мне заняться кротом параллельно с основным расследованием. Через четыре дня 22 января будет встреча с русскими наркоторговцами в ресторане «У Бабушки». Туда пойдет один человек из управления, — Джек замолчал, посмотрел на Мика, — и я бы хотел, чтобы пошел ты.
Приняв решение, Снежана вскочила на ноги и понеслась к выходу из парка, глазами ища блюстителя порядка. Но как назло никого рядом не оказалось.
— Ты его знаешь? — Макс сердито уставился на высокого, прикидывая, стоит ли ему вмазать или все-таки арестовать.
- I'd like to start to get ready for work. Today the rain has increased to a hurricane from the ocean. Need to go out earlier.
- Jen sized me. Thin, like your father. Brown hair, bobbed. Was dressed in blue leggings, a thick blue sweater, his father brought from Norway, black platform boots and black jacket — pouters. A — iPhone blue color, black purse. She has green eyes, snub nose and plump lips. Missing one tooth on the upper jaw.
— And he was dealing and had to talk with uncle Wong. The consensus they reached, Roger had thrown it. Roger came back at sunset. Put the bodyguards, took the uncle, brought in the biggest skyscraper and threatened — not to say that I have — will fall, and hell you're going... Uncle Wong went back on their word and all the information Roger gave. Now he is very polite to the thirteenth portion, that is, with us. He could see all the shooting and disassembly of the Chinese people happen everywhere, not only in our territory.
— Да это Мик Меллоун, — ответил за напарника Макс, — но я думаю, что вам стоит уйти, пока я вас не арестовал.
— Я живой. И он не тронул тебя… — торопливо добавил Шерлок, — честное слово. Но они, — Шерл оглянулся на преступную парочку, — замерли…
— Не-а, — Снежана помотала головой, отчего коса, которую она заплетала на ночь, хлестнула по воздуху, — не то и не другое. Вроде Америка, Калифорния. Двое — девушка и парень. Он — полицейский. Его звали Майкл или Майк. Она с белыми волосами. Её имя — Сноу. Они познакомились на дороге. Он ехал, а она мерзла на шоссе. Влюбились, поженились и переехали в маленький домик. А потом она исчезла, но до этого Майкл подарил ей вот этот медальон, что я купила. В домике случился пожар. А через некоторое время Майкла пригласили на какой-то вечер, и там он увидел Сноу. Но им не удалось поговорить. На здание напали. Майкл был убит, а Сноу пропала.
- Yeah that's the thing, I heard that you ORDERED. Yes and no, but Golgo 13. There you are, Mick! Do you know someone?
— Ми-и-ик!!! — заорал Макс, — ЭТО ЖЕ ОБРЕЗ!!! С такого расстояния выстрел из него превратит тебя в решето!!!
— А это ты? — Карл улыбнулся, — возвращаться я не буду, потом прочтешь. Это ублюдок, после предъявления улик, во всем сознался. В общем — сперва он был ласков с женой, но после пятерых детей решил, что с него хватит. Запер жену в комнате, но когда ему хотелось, он её навещал. И после некоторого времени, придя к ней, он обнаружил двух детишек — девочку — двух с половиной и мальчика — трех лет. Этот тип просто рассвирепел… он убил их… и набальзамировал…
— There should be, — edifying Max said, — stop and I am starving. All the sores from the patient's stomach...
— Okay, grandpa,  - Snezana nodded, - what do you say about this thing? — she took off my backpack and pulled out a locket.
— Ясно. Одна пуля в левое плечо. Стреляли в спину. Вторая — в правый бок, с той стороны улицы или из машины.
— Как только доедим, — Мик тщательно пережевывал креветку, зажмурившись от удовольствия. Потом, как бы что-то вспомнив, открыл глаза и, посмотрев на Кабаяши-сенсея, сказал, — Вам привет от Тойши — сама.
— Прекрасно, — сказал некий представитель ЦРУ, почесывая реденькую бородку, — у нас завелась террористическая группировка. Ну, что же, мисс Скотт, придется вас послушать и начать с вами сотрудничать.
— Хорошо, — послушно ответила та и двинулась вверх по широченной лестнице, которая вела на второй этаж.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
— На вас запредельный висяк, — лейтенант отпил кофе из кружки, — утром звонили возмущенные наследники и сильно ругались.
— Думаю, они травились этим мясом и в поисках того, кто бы мог облегчить их страдания, либо умирали под забором либо…
- Yes, but there are times when the help of the enemies are as invaluable as the loyalty of friends... And uncle Wong and Auntie Tsubasa the most useful people. And Big Brother Bosasa and see what  did there Juan.
— А это как раз и есть тот приз, который назначили за мою голову, — фыркнул Мик, — четыре миллиона долларов.
— Китайцы, дядюшка Вонг, мифическое чудовище — много информации, но абсолютно не нужной, — Макс откинулся на спинку сидения, — и еще речи про какую-то угрозу…
Sherlock, the quick little bugger, is slogging through the dank tunnels of the London Underground when Lestrade tracks him down. He grabs him by the shoulder, which is stupid because the cloak flares up, sending a jolt up his arm.
“I ripped his throat out. He got too close, grew cocky. The only weapon I had was my own teeth, and I had to bite deep or the others would have heard him. I made a mess.” It had been a last second decision; a moment where his will to live overpowered everything else.
Helios squirmed at his side. She had grown feathers from her back and tail, scales pushed from her legs, but she couldn’t seem to force the shape. John shook, feeling her distress. Helios had never had trouble making a shape once they had seen a picture of it. His door flew open, filling the room with light.
“Good day?” Sherlock asks with a quirk of his brow. He sets his case down carefully and pulls one of the containers open. Its filled with rice, noodles, chicken, mushrooms, and beef and broccoli; like someone had emptied an entire chinese menu into the box.
He stands up with a suddenness that startles Mycroft and Lestrade. They turn to stare at him with identical looks of curiosity. “I know where he is!” John says, already heading for the door. He doesn’t have an address exactly, only a feeling, a deep seated certainty of which direction he needs to head.
The source of the clapping comes from behind them. Agent Smith is leaning against a tree at the edge of the woodline. “I give you boys points for style, no one has ever tried something so idiotic before.”
Something  about the way the man says ‘Jim’ brings Sherlock’s attention to the man’s right arm. His sleeves have been shoved up to his elbows, showing row after row of acid green markings.
Jones had been the one assigned to John when social services brought him in. Jones had seen the new mythical creatures book that smelled like smoke and had heard how Helios had settled. “You know I’ve seen a lot of kids’ daemons settle. They always settle much too young and their forms always tell a story. Do you know what story Helios tells?”
Sherlock isn’t sure what he expects the other boy to do, but its not offer him his most prized possession back.
“It is rare that the Agents are sent out in teams, a strong working relationship with a demon servant can mean the difference between life or death,” Agent Smith answers.
They are rare things, summoner’s cloaks. They have to be earned by years of study and practice and are brought into creation by the summoner themselves. A sentient piece of clothing with the sole purpose of protecting their owner. No one but the summoner can wear their cloak. Lestrade can feel the power in its weave, and wonders at how a kid could have produced such a thing.
He knows what he needs to do, clear as day. Sherlock reaches out, fingers sparking with power. The mark fights, but he’s expecting it, redirecting the attack with a flick. The flower pulls from the skin like yanking a plaster, leaving behind a dark smudge.
“Alright then,” Lestrade reaches into his pocket and pulls out his athame. The blade is longer than most ceremonial blades, but his weapon has never really been for ceremony. “Let’s investigate shall we.”
Sherlock doesn’t even have the decency to appear startled. He gives a derisive chuckle. “I assure you, I knew that before we arrived.”
Also I finally started back up at school so chapters will be more sporadic. The university decided research papers would a great addition to the curriculum.
Lestrade yanks his phone back. “A class 7 attempting a class 10 summoning, it is the natural assumption.”
They make their way slowly around the bay, keeping an eye out for the Singapore guardian. On the far side, a merlion statue stands at the edge of the bay, shooting a stream of water from its stone mouth. There is a group of tourists out front snapping pictures.
Sherlock leads him unerringly to a small corner shop that smells like and entire spice market has been dumped atop it. He sticks his head through the door and shouts, “Mycroft,” before pulling back and making Greg stand at his side in front of the shop.
“This was the bullet,” Lestrade says, holding up a glass vial with the bullet suspended in solution. “Its from an M-9 handgun.”
Bill shrugs. “She started getting morning sickness and took the test. The doc is pretty sure she’s about 6 weeks along, but we haven’t had a quant or an ultrasound done yet so it's hard to tell.”
Lestrade blinked owlishly. He had noticed the black shape draped across the man’s shoulder, he assumed it was a cat or a huge lizard of some sort, but closer inspection revealed the daemon to be a small dragon.
“One of my agents was captured and held for two weeks. When we were certain he was dead, he was dropped on the steps of the Diogenes Club missing a kidney and part of his lung. The man was held awake and blindfolded while this Sebastian expertly removed the organs for transplant. This suggests a level of patience neither Moriarty nor the old Moran possessed.” Mycroft had not been certain until this moment that he was going to reveal the newest information about the man, but if he could not impress the danger on Sherlock he could at least put Dr. Watson on his guard.
Henry worries the stained napkin, avoiding eye contact. “I w..wa..was really young when I b..b..bonded. I d..do..don’t remember my vision, b..bu..but we touched and the m..ma..mark was there. Lime green and s..ss..ssso beautiful.” He picks at his already tattered right sleeve, a habit then.
“Killed his daemon with a poisoned needle, man dropped dead with a heart attack,” a smug voice responded from the vicinity of the man’s neck.
The removal of his shirt revealed the newly formed mark on his right arm. It was a startling pure red against Sherlock’s pale skin, red, meaning love and passion or danger and excitement. John had a pretty good idea which one theirs stood for.
Hamish watched the blood splatter in scope, the way Haddock jerked and slumped sideways in his seat. The tell tale red splay against the white siding of his house.
“Right of course,” Lestrade sounds about as sure as Sherlock does. He tucks the gun into his pocket. Which is when Sherlock realizes that Lestrade has a gun of his own. It is a handgun similar to John’s, but a smaller, sleeker model that Sherlock often sees hidden about Mycroft’s men's. “Dr. Franklin, you are under arrest, will you come quietly?”
The pain is like nothing John has ever felt before, and for some reason all he can think of is the night Helios settled, the night when she became something unheard of to save him, and now when she needs him he can’t fucking move!
Another four days after the lobectomy, Hamish started to prep for surgery. He didn’t have any intention of cutting into the man a third time, and he didn’t need too. Carson cracked.
John’s face lights up with a smile, wide and childish. For the first time, Mycroft thinks, he looks his age. “Thank you,” he grins, snapping his fingers to add to the magic. He doesn’t conjure a tree, but he does fill the room with the heady scent of pine mixed with cinnamon and cider.
The building looks like every other pretentious government building Sherlock had spent his life trying to avoid. The entrance is oppressive dark brick surrounded by towering white columns. The inside is pale marble marked with the Vision Center seal of the all seeing eye.
There is a white clothing box sitting on the top of his stuff. It hadn’t been there before. He pulls it out with care, but there is no sense of malevolent magicks. There is a plain card -just folded cardstock- taped to the lid. He tugs the tag off and flips it open. Neat loops of familiar cursive fill the card. He recognizes the handwriting, of course, Mycroft.
Lestrade knows Sherlock doesn’t mean anything by it, the kid just wants to prove his deductions and solve the case, he knows this, but can’t stop his anger from bubbling up. “You are not,” he snarls, “my One.”
John is just dirty and suffering from a headache, the cool water from the cup is soothing and helps the scratchy sourness of his throat.
It takes hours for the head runner to veer off into a proper cavern. They break off to prepare the temporary base, the soldiers move with a sort of silent grace. Blocking off the entrance and checking the area for traps.
“I lost my mind,” was all he could answer. His commander had shown him the pictures when they had forced him to sign his release paperwork. He didn’t remember any of it.
The Golem’s mouth opens in a soundless cry as it dissolves, the clay falling off in clumps, mixing with the muck below until there is only a mess of wet clay.
John looks startled by that and starts to push himself up. His arms are shaking and can hardly put any weight on his broken one, he seems to be moving by force of will alone.
Mycroft shakes his head, “Moriarty wants to play a game, he has been moving Sherlock around the board for months. This move makes no sense.”
“I can’t even argue with that one, I’ve been up to my ears in paperwork ever since the first bomb. That mess at the pool seemed to multiply it ten fold. Which seems to be mostly your fault,” Lestrade grinned, shooting a playful glare at John.
There is a man standing at the edge of the light, and Lestrade has no idea how he got so close without making a noise. His face is in shadow, but his eyes spark with the silver-blue glow of the Fae.
Stone sprays in all direction, Mycroft has to open the brolly to absorb the blows. Rocks clatter to the ground while the chamber fills with a rasping sound like sandpaper. He lowers his protection slowly, the room is filled with dust, clogging his lungs, and momentarily obscuring the guardian.
“Alright, I will, I swear, but you need to lay back down.” Lestrade pushes gently at his shoulder until he falls back into pillows, too exhausted to put up a fight. “I’ll go right now okay, I’ll find him.”
“While I know torture when I see it, I do not, in fact, possess the ability to read minds,” Jim ran his finger along the last cut, it had been the deepest and trailed off down his chest instead of staying a line.
“Are you here for Sherlock, that boy never answers the door,” she remarks with motherly exasperation.
“Christ, really? Today is not my day,” John tsks, looking down the tunnel. He looks conflicted, glancing towards the roar of the crowd and Sherlock.
Mycroft watches as John’s face shifts into a confused mix of hope and devastation. Silence reigns across the garden as they digest the information. It is the sort of silence that he loathes to break, but they have a mission. “Do you know anything about the Guardians that have gone missing or the creatures that may be causing it?”
Their shields, casting magelight down the path, makes the shadows lengthen. John stares into the abyss and feels...calm. The world slips away, there is only the darkness and the battle before him.
John stood there. He was in a horrible black jumper and cargo pants. He had an illegal rifle slung over his shoulder and his hair was more grey than blonde.
He walked a convoluted path to a little café about four blocks from New Scotland Yard. It was a long walk, but it did wonders for calming the twitchy, confined feeling.
“Captain,” Sgt Murray calls from behind, drawing their attention. “I talked to Colonel about er…” he gestures in their direction.
After a rather strange fight in an alley, John and Sherlock found themselves in Irene’s parlor, with Irene being very,
Hamish nods, taking a moment to force moisture back down his throat. “I… please…uh… their families, please return them to their families.” His voice comes out raw and scratchy like an old man.
John wakes with a gasp. He doesn’t remember the dream that woke him, but he has a sense of vertigo, like he had been falling. He takes a few deep breaths before sitting up. There are the beginnings of a tension headache building behind his eyes, and his ears feel shoved with cotton like they need to be popped. Once he has sorted himself and catalogued the surprising number of aches and pains, he gets the distinct feeling he is being watched. He is.
“I can’t tell him the truth,” Mycroft stands, straightening his suit. “Come along, it seems we’re going to Ireland.”
“Foolish creatures,” Balor’s voice is a rumble, a thrum of sound that is more felt than heard. The hut shudders, ripples extending outward as the boards shake and tremble. “You’ve brought me a lovely snack mortal.” With a clatter the hut bursts open, cracked like an egg to reveal the demon king.
He can see sparks of power on his desk, hints of color from the potion making and other enchanted objects. His violin glows a fiery orange, streaked through with hints of navy. A flash at the corner of his eye, draws his attention to his chest. Peering down, his body is obscured in flares of cerulean and sapphire, splashes of silver flashing along the edges.
So when I first started this story Sherlock wasn't going to show up until Chapter 12 or so and Lestrade was suppose to be a cameo, and this was originally chapter 3. The drawing of the Fomoir was actually the first drawing I did for this story, and I was so pleased with the results that I ended up drawing John and then Agent Smith. After that it just seemed silly not to continue writing on this story, so really this chapter is the reason I decided to pick this story back up again.
“He sent me to convince you to go home actually,” Greg snarks, “but since we both know that’s never going to happen, I’m here to lend a hand.”
“Yeah,” Lestrade nods, “they would have noted it when he was processed. Let me make a call.” He makes a series of calls as they make their way back to Mycroft’s house, sounding more and more frustrated as he slogs through the bureaucratic nightmare. He is parking the car when he finally pulls his phone away. He sits in silence, staring blankly at the dark screen.
“Yeah, yeah,” Lestrade gestures for him to sit back down. “You don’t have to do anything, just sit still.”
Sherlock turns away, teeth clenched. “Not well.” He takes a deep breath, “fever, chills, nausea. He’s been in bed almost since we got back.”
They took a cab back to Baker Street, Irene accompanying them. She sat in between them and John tried very hard not be jealous of how heavily Sherlock was concentrating on her.
- With Golgo I agreed. His observation post half a kilometer. His call sign is EAGLE. Your – DOVE, my – SPARROW. I carry out surveillance, walking in the shadow of Mick, do you agree, who and how will conduct Mick`s.
- You prohibitively cold case, - Lieutenant sipped coffee from a mug, — in the morning called perturbed heirs and heavily misused.
— А! — Люпен махнул рукой, — изумрудный цилиндр надежно заперт в сейфе. А я хочу к нему приобрести братика… Дом надежен. У босса есть личный телохранитель. Один был, но был убит в драке. А нынешний пришел из неоткуда. Невысокий такой бритый тип. Владеет ножом как бог. Один взмах… и ты на небесах. Шар стоит в спальне босса. В специальной комнатке. Ну, ты со мной?
— Может эти китайцы и не причем, может, мы туда зря едем, но вдруг… Нам надо проверить все версии. Мы не уверены, что убило эту девушку и остальных.
— Нет, они не спрашивали о японце, — Дайсуке посмотрел на Макса, — они спрашивали о темно-русом парне с серо-голубыми глазами и черным браслетом на правой руке. Ничего не напоминает?
Мик посмотрел в зеркало на свою заспанную физиономию, вздохнул и принялся чистить зубы. Потом он побрился, ополоснулся и побрел в кухню. Кухня была на первом этаже, а они спали на втором. В холодильнике было много чего. Запасы пищи оставались аж со свадьбы, а свадьба прошла в Рождество, 25 декабря.
— Nǐ wèishéme bǎ tā dài dào zhèlǐ? Kěyǐ shā sǐ tā (Why did you bring him here? You can finish him off there).
Шестое июля выдалось дождливым. Серые свинцовые тучи медленно ползли по небу, сбившись в одно громадное месиво. Дождь лил со всех сторон, и ветер закручивал тяжелые капли в бешеный ритм жгучего фламенко.
После хаммама не хотелось думать не о смертях и не о скелетах, но работа есть работа, и поэтому ребята двинулись дальше. Путь их лежал в редакцию LA Times, а именно к Джорджине Скотт.
— Мик, — Дайсуке мягко прервал своего приятеля, — послушай. Я приехал сюда и привез этого парня не для того, чтобы сказать, что тебя кто-то заказал. Я… — Дайсуке запнулся, потом продолжил, — я… нанял этого парня, чтобы… он стал твоим ТЕЛОХРАНИТЕЛЕМ!
Кабаяши — сенсей долго вертел и рассматривал материалы, потом отложил шестерых. Только в разные кучки. В первой были девушка японка, пропавшая пятого ноября 2055 года, афроамериканка — 08.06.2055 и латиноамериканец — 09.10.2055. Во второй кучке — Снупи, Рудди и Джен.
Джо и Шерлок предпочли остановиться в гостинице Radisson Blu Daugava. Это была шикарная пятизвездочная гостиница в стиле хай-тек.
- And what of it?  We just ask,- Mick said, leaning on the table Max`s,-we need facts and we don't even know who our victim!
— Меня зовут Элис Протил. Я — домохозяйка. Мой муж — коммивояжёр, он крайне редко бывает дома. И я воспитываю свою дочь практически одна.
— We go to the gallery of modern art on 252 S Grand Avenue, may be we will be able... that I can find out.
— Про товар не говорят, — согласился Дайсуке, — а вот про нового главу Лос-анджелесской группировки якудзы говорят.
— Я тебе верю. Возвращайся к своему спутнику, а я домой поеду, — Мик двинулся к останкам некогда большой машины — фары разбиты, стекол нет, шины спущены, все в разводах и пятнах ржавчины.
- Hello! - Pathetically exclaimed the little round man with a black crest on the head –wha-at fa-ate?
- Why do we put so much effort into looking for the key to the door leading to another dimension if they still opened it?
Макс мыл руки. Он уже решил поговорить с Миком о том, что его беспокоило, как вдруг пол под ним затрясся, зеркало треснуло, а сам Макс, не удержавшись на ногах, упал на пол. Он ушибся, но не отключился. Тем более непонятное явление длилось несколько секунд. Вскочил, бросился к двери. Но она не поддавалась. Что-то заклинило её. Что-то снаружи. Макс осмотрелся. Окно. Он увидел окно. Стекло покрылось трещинами, но рама осталась цела. И оно находилось на уровне его роста. Макс вцепился в подоконник, подтянулся, выбил стекло и вывалился в палисадник. Вскочил на ноги и побежал к центральным дверям. Но… их не было! И не было шикарной машины! И отсутствовал весь фасад ресторана! Макс почувствовал, что ноги стали ватными. Он ошалело смотрел на это, не чувствуя, что текут непрошеные слезы.
But the hosts were not, and a tiny Chinese woman worked as a shop assistant in a small shop at the factory. Everything else she was very shy. Guys barely won from her the story of the factory. But the end of the conversation she ceased to be afraid and brought them a lot of meat products. They thanked her and went to the police station.
— Your head will not be here, - about Mick`s sat down  Chinese with swollen eyelids,  - you will disappear.  Brother, give me the knife.
Mick chose the bone-in-meat, tea and a doughnut with blueberry filling. Max was limited to a couple of burgers, fries and coffee. Sitting, eating. Not bothering anyone. Little diner, little people. The decor is not pretentious, background something squeaks behind the wall, captain — news. Sat the boys, only the jaws are moving. Chew. And Mick was the only tea to drink, and Max  coffee directly in a glass display case with all the fluff TRUCK! No one knows where he was aiming and, in General, where the driver was driving, but this huge fountain was demolished a half, and five tables that got in the way. Then leaned on the counter and stopped. But everyone at the tables, dead under the wheels, was sitting, was still alive. Moreover, they sat and chewed, being in a state of shock. Max looked at Mick`s. He was drinking tea. The truck flew behind max, and still stood there.
Lou went to her room. Mick drank tea and threw glances at the stairs. After half an hour he heard steps. Some belonged to Daisuke, the second... the Second is an unknown, very confident.
— Спасибо, — ответил Голго, при этом в его глазах мелькнула какая-то искорка, быстро погасшая. После этих слов Голго неуловимо сдвинулся в темноту и… исчез.
— Что-то давно твоих убийц не было слышно, — Макс открыл дверцу мини холодильника, достал яблоко и стал его грызть.
Вечером 28 января Макс подъехал к своему дому в полнейшей темноте. Глубокая ночь. Над горизонтом стояли обе луны. Еще один день поисков прошел бессмысленно. Шансы, что они найдут парней живыми, уменьшались с каждым днем. Официально искали только Харуху, поскольку Мик, по легенде Джека, нигде не работал. А о поисках Мика знали только трое — лейтенант Фред Косторович, детектив Макс Тански и детектив Джек Скотт. Макс был зол, но оперативно схватился за обрез, как только сигаретный дым достиг его носа.
-  Let's go back, Mick,  - said Max, putting his hand to the partner on his shoulder, -  it's cold and damp.
- The cooker blew up today, when I warmed up Breakfast. Scared the whole family. I guess I need to see a doctor to handle.
— Я бы с вами не сотрудничала, но на кону жизни моих друзей и родственников, поэтому я вам сразу же скажу. Я работаю с этими двумя представителями Британского МИДа, — Джорджина показала на Шерлока и Джона, — информацию вы будете получать не каждый день, а тогда, когда я сочту нужным с вами поделиться. Защита мне не нужна. Если она мне понабиться, я вам сообщу. Если произойдет то, о чем я вас предупрежу, но вы не среагируете, то я перестану сотрудничать с вами и выйду на более высокий уровень. Сенат или президент.
— Меня два года не было, а ребята про них ничего не рассказали? Мда. Бонзаза. Даже не знаю, как его назвать. Он — все. И жрец Вуду, и король дискотек и тип, который может достать все…
Столик, который они облюбовали, стоял так, что можно было видеть весь зал и часть улицы. А их загораживала декоративная колонна и дерево в кадке. Цены были высоковаты, но один раз в год можно было сюда наведываться.
— Все это очень хорошо, — Дайсуке улыбнулся, — и мне крайне лестно. Ладно, я согласен. А теперь я поспешу к приятелю, а то он, не ровен час, решит что-нибудь с собой сделать…
On Sunday came the Snezana. Nash showed her some services, and now she was going to get to the FBI files.
— Непорядок, — тяжело вздохнул Вонг, — а насчет шара могу сказать… Мы его боимся. Вещь жуткая, иная и опасная. Если мы с ним свяжемся, у нас будут смерти, а мы их не хотим.
Полицейские вошли в цех. Слева возвышалась стена, из которой выходили две движущиеся ленты конвейера. Одна шла поверху и уходила в огромную мясорубку, от мясорубки шла вторая лента с готовым фаршем, она проходила упаковочный аппарат и попадала на склад готовой продукции. Вторая лента шла ниже, проходила печь, затем рубку, потом упаковку и на склад.
— Не суетись, — Мик посмотрел по сторонам и заключил, что хозяин, видимо, в ресторане, — пошли, давай.
— Макс, ты понимаешь, мы ничего не сможем сделать. У нас связаны руки, — лейтенант пододвинул Максу официальную бумагу.
— Да никак, — Джо положила голову Шерлоку на грудь, — они уже пять лет это делают, но, увы. Расплодили истинных арийцев штук десять, наверное. А нового Гитлера так и не видать.
— Ну, … скажем так, что у него крайне интересные пристрастия. Я писала о скандале, связанного с ним.
— Там же Мик! — воскликнул Макс, хватаясь за кобуру. Но его оружия там не было. Дайсуке проверил — его магнума тоже не было на месте.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
— А вот для этого я вас и будил, — ответила машина, — Мик вышел прогуляться и был похищен двумя неизвестными китайцами. Как только их машина свернула со стоянки, я поехал следом. В моей памяти заложено восемьсот разных способов маскировки. Я проследил за китайцами до этого дома. Смею сообщить, что я уже вскрыл замок и дожидаюсь вашего пробуждения.
Субботнее утро отвечало всем законам подлости. Оно было ярким и солнечным. Мик проснулся в десять, и весь день посветил уборке дома и сада. В час Мик позвонил Максу.
Роджер был счастлив. Он без лишних разговоров собрался и отвял в сторону Маленького Китая. Через полчаса все близлежащие участки были завалены жалобами китайского населения. Сдались полиции все, кто имел трения с законом. И они все умоляли избавить их от страшного рыжего монстра.
— Я подозревал, что одними снайперами тут дело не кончится. Меня мучали неясные предчувствия, и я остался в городе. От своих информаторов я узнал о встрече и тоже пришел туда. Заходить не стал, вел наружное наблюдение. К вопросу — ЧТО ТАМ СЛУЧИЛОСЬ? — я не знаю. Знаю только то, что те разговоры, которые вы слушали, были фальшивкой.
- One day we came to the man, saw the meat. This is the third day after the visit that guy was. He asked him to prepare. I tried to stop him, but in vain. He had a bite, and the next day he came again.
- Unfortunately, beer and alcohol, we found, can only tea to offer, -  said Mick, putting the packages on the nightstand.
— КБР сказало нам… мне, что Мик погиб при выполнении своей миссии. Тело, однако, не нашли. Хотя при том пожаре… погибли многие, в живых осталось всего десять человек.

— Посиди пока тут, я сейчас, — поспешил вслед за Миком. Догнал на лестнице, которая вела от дверей бара на улицу. По жестяной крыше над лестницей стучали капли дождя, сквозь решетку задувал ветер, а по ступенькам текла вода.
— А мы с вашим другом будем зарываться в тлен веков, — радостно возвестил Гюс. Он был в шортиках легкомысленного цвета и  разноцветной майке.
- What are the skeletons? He skinned them brutally and seem alive. But samples. You know, and the rest — they're weird. Two — exactly what the animals, but we have no such data. And the second two — presumably, — Margaret nervously looked around and whispered,  - I think... they  people!
— Извини, родная, — Мик, наконец, нашел голос и слезы. Он не рыдал в трубку, просто слезы катились сами. Слезы радости, — как же так получилось, что ты не в самолете?
— …тебя надо будет доставить на место встречи, — озабоченно прищурил серые глаза Джек, — только как?
Голоса затихли. Джо присела на каменную скамейку и обхватила голову руками. Она так глубоко задумалась, что не услышала шагов и подняла голову только тогда, когда кто-то погладил её по голове.
Sineglazka spoke in the name of Sayoko Nogami. Huge skinhead type in a camouflage suit and sunglasses - Falcon. Girl in pink suit with brown eyes and brown hair Raicy Nogami. And another girl with blue eyes and long black hair that shone in the sun blue – Mickey.
Послышались шаги. Мика крепко и болезненно схватили за волосы и потащили в комнату. Мик удивленно стал озираться, очутившись в комнате. На стенах по всему периметру стояли ГОЛОВЫ. Нет, они не были сушеными. Они были, может законсервированными, а может заспиртованные, но они ВСЕ были НАСТОЯЩИМИ! На всех лицах застыло страдание.
— Qù cānguǎn, kàn kàn shìfǒu yǒu bèi liú xià myaso.Esli zhuānjiā jiāng jìnxíng dì shísān jiè pàichūsuǒ. (Сходи по ресторанам и посмотри, не осталось ли мясо. Если осталось, отнесете экспертам в тринадцатый полицейский участок)
The cabin was quiet and warm. The boys quickly warmed up and dried out. Mick touched the wheel and the car moved on. Next stop: "Golden Dragon" restaurant Cantonese cuisine. It was located on hill street. Usually very lively China town was empty today. Mick parked the car near the entrance, and they ran under the protection of the giant Dragon statue. The statue swayed.  Can certainly holographic version to put, it would be cheaper, but the Chinese people are thorough. Mick and Max went to the restaurant. It was empty.
А Джо села за компьютер. Клочок бумаги, который нашел Шерлок, был маленький и мятый. Фамилия незнакомца была полустерта, а имя неразборчиво.
— Есть надо, — назидательно сказал Макс, — остановись и давай перекусим. Все болячки от больного желудка…
— Понимаете, его ранили в той драке, … и его кровь попала на этот проклятый шар. Мик говорит, что он чувствует зов шара. Я не знаю, что это такое, но думаю, что Мику может грозить опасность.
Затем появился Джерри Рифл — маленький приземистый, черноволосый, черноглазый. В оранжевом дождевике. Он кивнул Мику и проследовал к своему столу, где тот час же погрузился в работу. Через пару минут пришел его напарник — Карл Браунинг. За два года, пока Мика не было, Карл стал выглядеть достойным представителем нордической расы. А с его классическим профилем можно было играть в кино, героев-любовников.
— Затем, что появилась информация об алмазном шаре. Может нам удаться его перехватить, пока… не появились новые трупы.
— Ты! — срываясь на хриплый вопль, заговорил генерал, — ты испортил НАШ гениальный и потрясающий план. И когда я вернулся, ничего не было. Наших активов не было. Я был зол. Я был в ярости, и я решил отомстить тебе. Я не знал, кто ты, но я наскоблил четыре миллиона и нанял его, — генерал ткнул пальцем в Голго, — но он вернул мне эти деньги буквально через пару дней, и я выложил в спайснете свою просьбу, — генерала била истерика. Он трясся и судорожно загребал пальцами воздух. Потом он как-то внезапно посинел и свалился с кресла. Каори и Саеко осмотрели генерала.
- Thank you, -  broke the silence Mick, — you missed me. Commendable. You don't have to risk anything. This is my destiny. I love my friends and try to make them feel comfortable...
- It seems that Yes, but only with him or with someone else, I don't really understand. He travels to Los Angeles from Switzerland. I'll call you when arrive.
Новая Латвия особо не отличалась от того, что осталось на Старой Земле. Единственное, что было новым, так это дома. Наследство советской эпохи все благополучно оставили за бортом переезда и настроили того, чего хотели.
— Нет. У меня к тебе просьба, Дайсуке, — Джо достала блокнот и ручку, — значит так. Существуют семь кристаллов метр на метр — цилиндр, звезда, призма, конус, шар, куб и пирамида. Соответственно — аметист, лазурит, изумруд, рубин, алмаз, агат и сапфир. Тебе требуется найти данные по всем из них. Где они, у кого и их характеристики. Сам не рискуй. Погибнешь, Мик этого не вынесет. Действуй крайне осторожно и с минимальным риском. Подкупай, если надо.
The second, which Mick didn't see what was handed first. First and shoved it under the nose of Mick`s. The knife with wavy cutting edge.
— Потому что он хотел вывести нас из игры, — объяснил Дайсуке, — я же говорил тебе, Мик не даст нам умереть. Даже сейчас, он присматривает за нами и спасает нас.
Max went up to the second floor, walked to the table and saw that Mick`s yet. A bad feeling arose in his soul.
— Так — так, посмотрим что тут, — развязал и заглянул, — полагаю, Макс, ты бы не отказался от сладкой мести?
— А что вы от меня хотели, право слово? Сижу спокойно, никого не трогаю, — беспокойно осматриваясь, сказал тип, — жду, когда мне принесут мои котлетки, котлетки, котлетки…
— Мик! — прохлюпал Дайсуке, не подымая головы, — я как понял, что любое отклонение пули могло стоить твоей жизни, так и напился.
БУМ — дверь вспучилась и разлетелась шрапнелью. Два цикла метнулись в дыму и пыли, словно темные призраки. Несколько человек, находящиеся в ангаре, схватились за оружие, но были срезаны очередью. Циклы затормозили рядом с сидящим человеком. Окровавленный, грязный, руки скованны наручниками и замотаны колючей проволокой, на ногах тоже проволока. Дайсуке соскочил с цикла, вытащил лазерный резак и в несколько взмахов разрезал путы. Человек, сидящий на полу, стал заваливаться на пол. Дайсуке спрятал резак, подхватил человека и подсадил его на цикл Макса. Спереди.
— Когда ты перевоплотился в хранителя в измерении Y, Грааль исторг из себя святую энергию добра. Она вошла в наши сердца и изменила нашу силу. Потому что, это был настоящий Грааль, а не то выморочное порождение больной фантазии внешних воинов. Если помнишь, сила лже-грааля давала принцессе силу только на некоторое время.
Джорджина и компания вышли на некую компанию под названием «White sugar man» (Белый Сахарный Человечек). Они выиграли год назад тендер на поставку продуктов питания в аэропорты штата и никаких нареканий и жалоб на них не поступало. Компания была небольшая, крепко стоящая на ногах. По требованию Джорджины была проведена аудиторская проверка, но она ничего не дала. С финансами все было в порядке. Но Джо знала — в этой компании что-то неладно. И она пошла ва-банк. С помощью ФБР и ЦРУ она устроила на работу Джона Ватсона. Это замечательное событие произошло в середине апреля, и теперь Джон исправно поставлял сведения. Однако (Джона устроили водителем) сведения эти были обрывочны и не несли никакой информации.
— Ну как зачем? Похищенные скульптуры являются самыми большими драгоценными камнями, значит, ювелиры и ломбарды могут что-то знать об них…
— «Кажется, с Миком что-то не в порядке», — подумал Макс, — «он ведет себя как-то неадекватно. Вот идиот! Мика ранили! Поэтому он такой заторможенный! Эти выхлопы…». Тут он понял, что шум от перебранки водителей затих. Посмотрел на перекресток — там уже никого не было.
— I... going back to my conversation at the restaurant... I'm not jealous of you. I'm just afraid for you, - Max sighed, - I lost my family and first partner. And that led me to a personal madness. ... I wandered lonely, restless... and didn't know why. I... longed for death and did not want to live. And now... you. And I want to live... for your friendship... — Max was silent, having no words to Express what he had accumulated for two years. Mick was silent. Bottom fought the waves, kicking up foam caps and crashing in the salty sea-spray of diamonds. To the horizon stretched the ocean. Changeable shining in the sun, shimmering blue, then black, then sapphire-green. The horizon was cloud. The ocean there was black. Max looked at the water and cursed himself.
— Равны нулю. Если они узнают, что захватили копов, то… все. Поиски станут бесполезными, — Джек отхлебнул из чашки, — лейтенант, вы мне позволите поработать с Максом?
- What do we have?  - asked the tall girl. She was black with a blue sheen short hair. She was dressed in a high skirt, jacket and shoes. All blue, - we know that Melloun actually has chases Golgo 13.
He walked down familiar roads, roads that would barely change in the years to come. New Scotland Yard is a bright shinning thing, and he stands in front of it and marvels until he has to leave or risk drawing attention. He walks by the Tesco his Dad always used. A cab will plow through the front window in a few years and it will take them ages to fix it, but it’s still the same.
“No, he was looking for proof of witchcraft,” Sherlock grins. “He didn’t find anything, of course, a bird daemon is hardly proof of magic, but he has been working his way through the city looking for a witch.”
John summons his second gun with a flick of his wrist and continues shooting down the Fomoiri clawing at the shield. “They’re water based demons, right?” he asks, spinning around to shoot one of the creatures creeping up behind them.
Angelo brings their dinners over with his usual boisterous way. The food is fantastic as always. They eat in companionable silence for a time, a near miracle considering the table contains two Holmeses. The food is filling and they all wind up with takeaway boxes, but agree to dessert as well because even Sherlock can’t turn down Angelo’s Tiramisu.
“That little shite, I can’t believe he knocked our best fighters out so easily,” a rough voice snarls.
“Alright, alright, take that one,” Lestrade interrupts before Sherlock ruins his own element of surprise. The man in question is already shooting his sword a curious look.
“This is Chinatown,” Navamas tells them, “but you have not had proper Sing food until you have eaten at a hawker stand, la. The one here is very good.” She leads them to a building that looks rather nondescript on the outside but the inside is stall after tiny stall of food. It is a maze of food, filling the air with spices.
Hamish is certain that he isn’t widely known as Moriarty’s right hand man, but he had made his rounds enough that these boys could know of him. He gestures behind him, “No harm done, off with you.”
“May I help you?” comes a wavy voice to their right. The man is tall and reed thin, with a mess of long brown hair. Judging by how wide his pupils are and the slowness of his blinks, Lestrade suspects he’s quite high, hemlock most likely.
“I don’t know if I would say rare,” Mycroft answers, pulling off his coat, “but unless the castor is quite powerful the spell is rather useless.”
“Did she?” he preens, feathers fluffing. He shakes his head, “O‘course she did, tha King knows all.”
“Ah, quite,” Mycroft almost sounds like he’s chuckling, there is certainly a lightness to his tone that had not been there before. “I simply wanted to wish you a belated Happy Christmas. Have you been well?”
Mycroft wants to know how he accomplished it, but knows better than to try and pry that information from him.
Lestrade gulped. Kid’s daemons could do amazing things; sometimes they changed into something that could protect their charge. He knew that children that suffered trauma usually had daemon’s that settled early. But John was so young, could hardly be four or five and his daemon had more then changed to protect him. She had shifted into a giant beast and had burned the threat to cinders. Helios looked about 2 meters long and a meter and a half high. Her wings stretched even longer, held high around her charge like a shield.
“Now, we don’t want to send you into the field without so much as a by your leave, so you both will be expected to train for a three month period. John has been trained, but never working with an agent. By the end of the training period if you have not passed the requirements then your position will have to be reassessed,” Moneypenny pauses, as if to stress her point. “You both will be sent to our base in Ireland tonight to begin training, your situation will be… explained to the university.”
Greg starts talking about the first case that comes to mind. There is a new crime boss in the area thats been controlling some of the local gangs and has been running illegal gambling rings in the tunnels. They have been trying to gather intel from some of the local homeless, but no one is willing to talk.
John remembers getting into the cab, but not much else until he wakes up a few hours later with a pounding headache. His mouth is dry and his throat scratchy, but he calls out, “Helios?”
John’s grip on his gun is steady, his aim sure as he shifts his weight. “No,” John says, “I’m really not.” And then he shoots Moran.
“You’ve settled yourself quite well into his ranks, Moriarty would certainly trust a man that does not hesitate to kill and torture,” Mycroft commented, a brow raised in contempt.
Mycroft loses track of how long they dance, hypnotized by the fluid movements. When John settles back at his side, landing lightly on his toes with a rustle of feathers, it feels as if an instant and an eternity has passed.
“Oh, ta,” John flushes, because he does have a headache, and it’s been getting worse. He sips the tea and finds it to be a vanilla camomile, lightly sweetened with some very good honey. John’s always been a purest tea drinker, earl grey with a splash of milk, no sugar and coffee much the same way, but he is pleasantly surprised by this cuppa. “Oh,” he murmurs and offers Sherlock a sincere smile.
While John could not see his own eye, he had a perfect view of Sherlock’s, which is when he realized that the man’s left eye was suddenly a very familiar dark blue; familiar, because he saw it in the mirror every morning.
At Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson brought them tea and biscuits while Sherlock pulled eight laptops of varying design out of every corner of the flat.
Mycroft nods, effecting an air of polite embarrassment as he moves towards the platform, inwardly cursing his luck. He knew that non-Hindu were not allowed in the temple, but had hoped it would not be guarded. Not for the first time, he wishes John was here. With his wings displayed, they would have been allowed into the temple without question. No one would bar a Devas from a place of worship, Hindu or not.
“Careful,” Smith says, looking down to where his shadow has split again, blank eyes squinting up at him. “That wasn’t all of them.”
“Right,” Lestrade says, and with nothing else to do, follows the directions. The building has that stuffy government feel, but there is no sign that indicates where, exactly, he is. The first office on the right, however, does hold one Mycroft Holmes. Lestrade only met him briefly, but he looks exactly the same - three-piece suit and all.
Six years ago Greg had met his bond mate in the sort of encounter that usually appeared in romcom dramas, and along with Mycroft Holmes came Sherlock. It had been a strange transition to suddenly be responsible for a twelve year old, even more so when that kid is Sherlock.
Sherlock shot him a look, clearly sensing his mood. “I think it is best for John and I to return home.”
Helios stepped next to her human, head held high. Her scales had grown dusty and her tan fur had grown dark with mud, but she was no less magnificent because of it.
Sherlock scowls, and in pure spite, leads Greg at a jog through the winding crowds of people. He takes obscure back roads on a maze-like route to Little India. The whole area has the faint whiff of curry and the tiny shops defy the dreary London weather in a riot of bright colors.
John has seen dead bonds before, it’s hard not to as a doctor and a soldier, but he’s never seen anything like this.  Dead marks fade and lose colour, sometimes they look inflamed or have black lines, Henry’s looks like a
There is a burst of gunfire, Bauza ducks, straightens, and fires his own burst. “Piece of crap,” he growls, glaring down the road.
Lestrade has seen enough trances to recognize the signs. He looks heavenward and wonders why in the world he decided to let a kid he barely knows crash on his couch. He feels a sharp tug beneath his breastbone, ah right, that’s why.
Sherlock and the man are running through the dark, London streets together. They share adrenaline fueled glances, eyes bright against the night.
“Harry, what did they do to me?” John swallows back tears as he points to his leg. His left knee looks fine, but beneath that is a network of silver metal merged with skin. It looks like something from a sci-fi show.
John put down his rice, a rather frightening grin spreading across his face. “That, is what we were waiting for.”
He can’t see well in the red light, his arm looks black and ripped apart, but a careful prodding with his fingers tells him it is not nearly as bad as it looks. He has a series of shallow cuts along his arm with only two being deep enough to maybe need stitches.
Of course, the man wanted him to come to the station and ‘explain’ his deductions. As if it wasn’t obvious. Though, Mrs. Hudson had stolen his skull, perhaps he could use Lestrade to bounce ideas off for a while.
“Bill that’s great news!” John can feel the smile spreading across his face, wide and exuberant. He’s only met Anne twice. Once right after Bill bonded, when he was still showing off Anne and the the loyal yellow level two mark curled around his wrist. The second time he saw her had been at the wedding, and he had spent most of the time hiding in the back with the rest of Bill’s Army mates. “How far along is she? I just saw you three weeks ago.”
“Dull,” Sherlock sighs, he hates when cases are solved due to sheer luck rather than any sort of intelligent pursuit.
John looked at the soldier; he had to be at least forty, one of the sad percent of the population without a bond. He knew the Army had a high percentage of people either without a bond or a black one.
“Well that will be hella useful. Bauza speaks Pashto and Murray is passable at Dari, but I got assigned Spanish and still only learned that by the skin of my teeth,” Z grins. He opens his mouth to say something else, but there is the scuffle of feet down the hall. They both shut up, straining to listen.
“Well, I’ll just have to go a show them how wrong they are,” Sherlock stands in flurry, drawing his coat to him with a flick of his fingers.
“The evidence supports the ruling, Sherlock. I can’t fight this without evidence to the contrary, it’s above my station,” Lestrade sighs.
This one was a blast to write, and I'm pretty pleased with the illustrations, though If anyone would like to draw Mycroft all nervous and uncomfortable in an Army uniform, you'd make my year. ;P
Sherlock is already sitting at a bench outside, chatting with the man. He’s holding himself in a relaxed, sort of slumped, posture John’s never seen before. He also appears to be sipping a pint that has apparently appeared from nowhere.
“Java and Cambodia are gone. I felt their loss as if it were my own. Their energies shredded and put to darker purposes. You’ve seen it already, haven’t you? The demon that twisted the tiger and made it hunt my people as prey.”
Molly steps up to the man first, the bloated body from this morning. “We identified him as Brian Lukis, a travel Journalist, and I looked into what you asked Greg, he did just get back from China last week.” Molly’s nervous nature falls away as she works.
Sherlock stands and deposits Bluebell in John’s arms. The rabbit makes an affronted squeak. “Couldn’t go without my blogger,” he remarks with a smirk.
“You’re kind of an odd duck aren’t you?” Johns asks as he looks over the pictures pinned to his wall, different murders from London. Sherlock has been collecting unsolved cases for when his contract ends in a year and he can return home, some of the cases he has even managed to solve abroad.
Hamish can feel the sharp eyes tearing him apart, but he ignores it. Putting the groceries in the kitchen next to John’s bags. The table is laden with chemistry equipment, and Hamish can see the remnants of a fungal experiment.
“Oh ay, Paul you crazy blighter, calm down. You don’t go slammin the door like that ya great bull,” Pete huffs, but moves to the only TV in the bar. It's showing different plays from the weekend games, with subtitles running across the bottom. He flips to the news and turns the volume up a few notches.
When the final drop falls, the muddy solution sparks, flaring with green light and developing an oil slick sheen along the top.  It makes his room smell like fresh cut roses.
Lestrade followed Sherlock as the man tracked through the streets of London like a bloodhound. Riddell has a fantastic sense of smell, but Lestrade had never seen anyone track like Sherlock Holmes.
“How did your robbery case go?” John asks after savoring a bite of Angelo’s fresh baked bread, the crust has a nice bite to it.
Mycroft looks over at him, hair sticking in all directions and lips starting to blue. His clothes are clinging to him, he looks like a drowned rat. His shoulders start to shake, lips twitching.
Agent Smith goes his own direction, heading for his connecting flight to Boston. He doesn’t give them so much as a backwards glance. Mycroft doesn’t know if his feigned disinterest is because he trusts them to accomplish the mission without further input, or he just doesn’t want to reveal their connection. Mycroft rather suspects it is the latter.
“The hell it ain’t,” Bill scoffed, rolling John over so he could look at his shoulder wound. “Your burning up,” he muttered, pulling the jumper down to show the bandage. He only tore the corner of the bandage down, expecting to find pus or blood poisoning. Instead, he found the wound had taken on the healthy white shine of fresh scar tissue. There was barely any redness and no pus.  “John… it looks fine.”
John has only been on the London Underground a few times, but it was nothing like the station Navamas leads them to. The station is bright and clean, and some clever magic has made it smell like fresh rain and spring growth. The train is spotless, and while the station is busy, there is no rude crush of people rushing in and out. Though John is amused to find a similar voice telling them to ‘mind the gap’.
Lestrade lets the tension bleed out of his shoulders even as he steps into the flat. He feels better just knowing Sherlock is out of the fray, at least for now. The scent of blood gets stronger as he makes his way to the back of the flat. There are no sounds indicating a struggle, which doesn’t bode well for Van Coon.
“They will speed up the trial, this case already has a lot of publicity. They’ll call you to testify,” Lestrade comments.
Wide-eyed, Mycroft constructs a shield just as the creature crashes back to the floor, claws lashing out. The talons scrape across the shield with a piercing screech, sending up sparks.
Hamish woke to the touch of fingers along his back and warm breath against his ear. It took him a moment to remember his surroundings. The adrenaline fallout from the day before had given him a deep sleep.
“Very much so, you’ll fit right in.” Moriarty sipped his tea, seemingly unconcerned about poisoning. “Ex-military, sniper.”
So for those that have never read any of my other stories, I actually was in the Army and deployed to Iraq, which is part of the reason of why I put Mycroft in a US unit instead of a British one. I was in a support unit, so I based the combat maneuvers on what I remembered from basic training.
“I am not a damsel in distress, I am capable of defending myself, I’ve been doing it for over thirty years now,” Sherlock scowls.
Sherlock pauses the video right before Moriarty smashes the glass. “He is exactly where he wants to be. He’ll stay put.”
“Sherlock is the best detective in the city, tell me who took her and we may be able to get your daemon back,” John offered, since threats seemed useless.
Sherlock was momentarily startled by the defense, he had long ago deduced that Sally had an older brother, but had not realized the man was a soldier. Interesting.
There is a shout, a language he doesn’t recognize, before a spell barrels through the car. Verdant spellcraft knocks into the ceiling before jamming straight down, shoving the monster into the floor and the flames. The fire flares back to life, licking across the tiger’s protection. It must find a chink in the armor because the beast howls, roaring in rage and pain.
“Oh, shit,” Lestrade fumbles with his phone pressing call as he slides into the car. The line rings and rings and rings. It clicks off and another text alert sounds.
In the storm and the sand, there is only the two of them, bond mates soaring for the first time. It is a test of trust and strength and, in their case, a bit of madness. Sherlock watches John’s strong back as he levels his flight, barely avoiding a building, and thinks about sharing his London with a man that would fly in an Afghani dust storm with nary a hesitation.
“I,” Lestrade hesitates, looking towards the door. Sally’s right, he’s being selfish. “I’ll fix it.”
Sherlock leaned against the side of a police car. His shoulder still ached with a dull throb, but he could feel the pain fading.
Two weeks. It isn’t that long. Not in the scheme of things, but the passing of time drags into eternity. John spends his days working with Smith, learning new spell craft and helping with paperwork. He spends afternoons with James, sneaking out of the barracks for flights in the subway.
“Excellent as always, John,” Dr. Cohen remarked as she walked by. She didn’t quite reach five foot and looked funny weaving through the elevated lab tables. “What kind of cancer did you think this one was?” she asks, holding up a slide that had given him some trouble.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes. He had done some study of Visions, but they were private things. Very little was written on their actual content.
“12 is just where the scale stops recording, I know,” Sherlock looks down at the mark, still floating in the air. “I can do this, runes are my speciality. I can change it if it makes you feel better, but we’ll have to move quickly, the castor will feel it.”
Agent Smith awaits him at a maintenance door, which would look inconspicuous if it wasn’t reinforced steel with three sets of locks more than normal.
Third, If you are confused by the sudden change of scenery, this story is designed in sets of two. First two chapters following Mycroft and John, second two following Lestrade and Sherlock. Hope that isn't too confusing, it'll make more sense as I get more chapters up.
Mycroft huffs, hiding a laugh. “Yes, most don’t realize. Their minds just marvel at the beauty and slip right over the oddity. This is the current shrine of Tianlong.”
“Older woman, she’s been here for ages. First name Carol, last name unknown, daemon recorded as a snowy owl. Cause of death appears to be strangulation,” Lestrade clucked. “I’ve seen her around before, nice lady.”
With both Uriel and John gone, James had demanded to be allowed into the Agent training program, and they had finally conceded. John thinks he may be following in James’ footsteps soon, but he’s still reeling from what happened in Singapore.
The light overhead flickers, the room dimming as the wall in front of them seems to warp, the walls rippling. Sherlock has a sudden wave of vertigo, his stomach rolling with discomfort.
“Captain Watson,” he grins, pulling his hand out of his pocket to give a little wave. “Haven’t seen you since Maiwan, long time.”
“This castle is home to great deal of sprites and spirits, they are generally benign, but I would be careful all the same,” Agent Smith warns. He gestures for them to follow, and he takes them on a twisting route through the castle. The first floor is beautifully decorated, all rich tapestries and gleaming oak. It’s like nothing John has ever seen.
“No, no, look,” Sherlock huffs, gesturing at the body. “Mrs. Harrow was poisoned, powdered belladonna in her coffee. Her neighbor, Mrs. Williams, uses small doses of belladonna to treat her arthritis, she used a deadly amount this morning to kill Mrs. Harrow. Belladonna’s first effect is paralysis, she could not move to call for help.”
Flustered, Hamish stands and started pacing along the far wall, suddenly looking very much like Sherlock. “I am, sort of. John was my biological parent anyways, I barely remember him. I was raised by Sherlock.”
Jim pulls his clothing off with out seduction, merely throwing the pile into a corner and pulling Hamish into the shower.
“Sherlock get out of here, you idiot!” John shouts from the cage. He clangs something against the bars, but the beast’s attention does not waver from its new prey.
John narrows his eyes at his mate, giving him a suspicious look as he probes the bond. “Aha, Molly’s autopsy,” he grins.
Fresh sunlight is a blessing. John doesn’t think they’ve been in the caves more than a few hours, but the air had been oppressive, the stench of sulfur clogging his every breath.
The next day, Greg is in such a good mood he takes them out for lunch, he and Mycroft fight the whole time about the money. Only when Greg announces that the successful raid got him promoted to Detective does Mycroft conceed.
James shakes his head at having his words thrown back at him. “I haven’t given up, not exactly. I’ve just decided to stop looking.”
Since, John isn’t shooting him (the browning is tucked against his back) Hamish assumes Mycroft hasn’t shared his picture yet. Good.
His palm is unmarked, and Lestrade is rather curious what this man’s gift is. His only visible bond is a green familial one, that he suspects connects to his brother. “I’ve been keeping an eye on him since we met, but I promise to try and keep them out of some trouble.” Lestrade takes his hand, and gasps when a jolt shoots up his arm and his sight is blinded with splashes of colour. He stumbles away from the grip, his heart pounding as he tries to get air into his lungs.
Lestrade blinks rapidly, Sherlock can practically see the rusty gears turning. He pulls out his phone and clicks over to messages. Sherlock watches him go from slack sleepiness to a full body wince.
“Sally,” Lestrade glares, because you should never joke about losing a bond mate, even if she can’t see the strength of the bond Sherlock shared.
Mycroft finally concedes. Taking up chopsticks in one hand and a spoon in the other. He eats the laksa fastidiously, wrapping the noodles in the chopsticks and balancing them on the spoon. It’s ridiculous, but he seems to enjoy the soup, or at least he finishes the bowl. He’s even more reluctant about trying the crab, but John convinces him to at least dip the bread in the sauce. Mycroft eats with the bread held delicately between two fingers.
“Come on,” Sherlock snaps, grabbing Greg’s arm and dragging him back to the main road. He needs to leave because he’s furious, but also to prevent him from asking why.
“Thank you,” Mycroft says. “I apologize for my rudeness in summoning you, but it was of the utmost importance.”
Finally, Mycroft manages to drag him away. Their room is simple compared to the spectacle of the lobby; two queen beds and a small seating area. He manages not to flop himself on the bed in exhaustion by sheer will alone. John has no such compunction and throws himself onto the bed hard enough to bounce a few times. “What do we do now?” he asks, voice muffled.
Sally had been there when Lestrade had met his wife, a woman with a single black bond. Their marriage had been a combining of two lonely people trying to fit into shapes that were not their own. Sally had also been there when his wife had cheated on him. It was only a month later his Vision struck, a decade late, and attaching him to a man that could only be dreamed up in books.
John has to stifle a grin, the pink is a terrible stereotype, but he can see how strong the bond is. The lines of the three levels are thick with interlocking signs for Faith and Endurance and don’t show even a hint of infection. “Takes all types I suppose,” John says, thinking of the marks on his own arm, symbols for danger and adventure.
“Unfortunately, scrying for the Guardian always just points to the whole of the Hudson River, not all that useful.” Mycroft had memorized the map of Central park on the flight over and walks with confidence in the direction of the Bethesda Terrace and Fountain. “You’ll like Bethesda though, she is an angel statue, so I imagine she will be helpful. The inspiration for the statue should make her inclined to assist us as well.”
He resisted the urge to curse; of course he shouldn’t have known her name or profession. Irene Adler was hardly the sort of woman a poor Army Doctor would run across. “I’ve heard whispers, it wasn’t a difficult leap,” he said, trying on the arrogant scoff his father was fond of.
Lestrade whistles, low and impressed, but not surprised. “Class 12 might be the highest rank, but they are not so rare that this Wu couldn’t be one, and we both know that power levels are the most variable in 12.”
The crime was at a collection of council estate flats in a bad part of London. The whole place was awash with lights. The LFB were already there, their fire engines having been called in first when a fire had erupted in one the flats.
“I went to Florida where her husband was on death row for murder,” Sherlock grinned. “One of my first cases. “
“You want to go to wherever you just saw? It scared the hell out of you, don’t deny it,” John scowls. He can tell how shaken Mycroft is, the room reeks of fear, he can taste it on the back of his throat, sharp and coppery like blood.
Sherlock slips into the car, the engine starts with a roar and they are soon on the road, Baskerville fading behind them.
Mycroft sent Sally a sharp look, but did not comment, he had learned long ago that it was best to let Sherlock handle his own verbal battles - most of them anyways. “Another case solved.” Mycroft looked smug, as always, like he expected Sherlock would eventually cave to taking government work, foolishness.
“I have no patience for this right now, but I swear to god if you two aren’t at Baker street at 0900 tomorrow for a proper statement then I’m throwing you in jail for obstruction, got it.”
“Not exactly,” Q points at the stone in John’s hand, “that is Azurite, ‘stone of the heavens’ it will help filter your magic so you can use it for healing. Angels have extraordinary healing abilities, but their magic is so pure it actually causes harm to all but their One. With one of these stones, however, the magic can be filtered and used safely. Each of these stones is a healing stone, but are each a little different. They will all respond uniquely based on your own magic so I`m afraid I can’t give you much of a guide.”
“You made enough for an army. I don’t want toast, but I do want coffee,” Sherlock straightens to his full height, which is impressive for a fourteen year old.
At the sound of fingers snapping, john squeezed the trigger. He didn’t have time to verify the hit. He turned his sights to the other sniper and fired off two rounds, just in case.
John, and to a lesser extent Irene, watched in awe as Sherlock managed to use each computer in rapid succession. He seemed to be using soul search websites. John had never been on one himself, since until recently he thought he didn’t have a soul mate. The sites were for people that had their vision, but didn’t have any luck finding their match. It was usually a result of weaker bonds, but occasionally people in Irene’s predicament searched for missed connections on the sites.
“So, I’ve been told,” Hamish smiled, enjoying himself. The last few months had been stressful, being around an old friend was nice, even if she didn’t know who he was.
He washed Helios first. It was an effort squishing her into the small tub, but they worked together to get the dirt from her coat. It took an entire bottle of shampoo and conditioner to get it back to its proper shine. Her feathers were in disarray, and John had to spend an hour with them sprawled across the room while he preened them back into place, linking the primaries so she would be able to fly once more.
John scratches the back of his head, looking embarrassed. “I keep the base of my wings sort of out of sync with this plane. It kinda itches, but it’s better than ripping all my shirts.”
Sherlock makes a curious noise and kneels down to look, his fingers a hair’s breath from touching. “Car accident, IED,” he mutters.
The next morning they go their separate ways. Sherlock wanders, mapping some of the less known regions of London. He stops on occasion to play and busk a few pounds, but he’s too jumpy to linger more than a few songs.
John nibbled at the rice like he was forcing down gruel, eyes fixed on the news as the women droned on about the Euro.
Lestrade sighs, “This will come back to bite me.” He looks over to find Sherlock ignoring him, kneeling over the circle with a fist full of evidence bags. He touches his pocket and finds his own bags missing. “Did you pick my pocket?”
“It’ll take time, usually we would use a horse or a larger animal, but we don’t have any readily available and she will be able to produce more antibodies faster than using a larger animal,” Stapleton says, stepping over to him.
Sherlock ignores him. “I don’t know how you haven’t found the gambling rings. All you have to do is follow all the blood thirsty men in suites wandering about the tube. They certainly stick out. The matches have been nightly for over a fortnight now, have you just been sleeping through them,” Sherlock drawls.
“Administering a localized anesthetic,” Hamish answered, just as he stuck the needle into the muscle on his lower right side.
John shakes Sherlock off his sleeve so he can hold his hand. His cheeks flush with embarrassment, but he nods in agreement. “Okay,” he murmurs, suddenly shy.
“I do not,” John squeeks. He leans forward, ready to launch off the platform, a good tussle would probably help his mood. He’s teetering on the edge when a chill works up his spine. He turns to the door, knowing that Agent Smith must be on his way. The man is a powerful mage, but it is not his magic that draws John’s attention. It’s the demon that lingers in his shadow. The dark magic grates against his senses, leaving a bitter taste at the back of his tongue.
“No, well they discourage it of course, but no I could have left. I had just been wandering around the streets of London for a year or two I think, I don’t remember much.” John swallows hard, staring at the fire. “I remember searching, a constant ache, but with no real direction. When MI6 found me they didn’t give me much of choice, but honestly I’m surprised someone worse didn’t whisk me away first.” He sighs. “Every time I thought about leaving I’d get a horrible ache in my chest that I needed to be there, so I stayed.”
He earned the grades to get into Saint Bart’s, but money did become an issue. Even with financial aid, he found himself working two separate jobs and sharing a postage stamp flat with four other people.
Sherlock’s voice is muffled into the carpet, but Greg has long been an expert at Sherlock translation. “I thought it would be less boring than London.”
Sherlock hears the grind of creaking metal just before a form slams into his back. “Get down, you sodding idiot,” a voice yells in his ear as a small body presses him into the linoleum. It hurts, Sherlock can feel his primaries getting twisted in all directions. He wants to elbow the - surprisingly British - soldier in the face, but the whole hospital is ringing in alarm. There is a distinctive whine of an impacting missile, a sound Sherlock would know anywhere, and the building is roaring with destruction.
It was a good haul. John put the apple in his pouch and ate the cheese in large bites as he walked. He shared a breadstick with the homeless woman, Carol,  in Hyde Park. She was at least sixty and had been staying in the park for over ten years. Her Daemon is a handsome snowy owl named Sage, who spends most of his time sleeping on her shoulder. Carol used to be a college English teacher and John enjoys arguing over the daily crossword with her.
Hamish had to play this right. “I can ensure you he is no threat, let the government understand you mean business.”
“Well, let’s go get them.” Gabriel flexes her hands and strange, twisted blades appear, both ends curved like a scythe.
John Watson is holding four heavy grocery bags and is surrounded by three thugs with knives. Judging by their appearance, Hamish deduces the thugs to be the last of a crime ring Sherlock and John put into jail a week prior.
“It must have taken some effort to circumvent my security,” another voice said. The man sounded overly posh, but John didn’t recognize him, though he suspected it was one of the hostages.
“Mummy?” Mycroft called, taking a closer look at the small numbers on his brother’s wrist. They read six years and eight months. For a moment, Mycroft felt an irrational surge of jealousy.
he is called again, though this time the voice echoes in his mind, a calming balm against the torment of his thoughts. He opens his eyes to find John pressed against the far wall, he has his hands out in front of him like he doesn’t know what to do with them. Sherlock takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly, he runs his hands through his hair and finds the wild curls sweat slicked to his brow. “I was dreaming?” Sherlock says, it sounds like a question.
At the far side of the room, beside two filing cabinets, he finds a door with light filtering under the jam. The bond flares, golden light flickering behind his eyes as he steps beside the door, careful of his shadow. Sherlock is here, finally.
Each step closer to the Dean’s office, sends a warning flare across his senses. With his scores tucked in his bag, he is well aware that it is not the Dean that wishes to speak with him.
John is sitting in the kitchen, listening to Mycroft and Lestrade trying to put together the CCTV footage from when Sherlock disappeared, when he feels the bond spark to life. A flare of golden light flashes behind his eyes and he suddenly knows,
He turns back to Sherlock, and as he does, pulls his wings into the corporeal plane with him. He lashes out with one wing, stabbing the primaries directly through the center of Sherlock’s aura. It has to hurt, he knows, but there is no other way.
“Only something to do with Sherlock would have you fretting so much. What did he do this time?” Greg asks, approaching his bondmate.
Henry jolts, curling his arms around his chest like he expects to be hit. “M..M..Mr. H..H..Holmes,” he greets, shoulders shaking.
Sherlock can relate, he’s not sure how he feels about it either. “I can’t hear you anymore,” he murmurs. He can’t, the pulse of constant thoughts in the back of his mind is gone. He can feel the bond still, the cord tying them together, but it hurts now, like a splinter buried in his limbic system. If the antidote works, then the infection will go away and the bond shouldn’t hurt anymore, but Sherlock might never be able to hear John’s thoughts again. When they had first bonded Sherlock though the constant feedback was irritating, but now, with the knowledge that he is once again alone in his own mind all he can think is, ‘I don’t want to be alone again.’
She has a point, he knows she does, but Lestrade feels like he can believe this kid, and he always trusts his gut. He holds out his hand, “Detective Sergeant Lestrade. Can you prove any of that?”
The newscaster has a stunned look on his face, looking at the camera, but mostly likely reading the cue cards scrolling beneath. “It’s been a strange day for tourists this afternoon. At the Tower of London a man broke the case to the Crown Jewels. He did not attempt to steal them, however, police found him sitting on the throne wearing the jewels. Officials are baffled by the reasoning behind this case.  More of this story to follow.”
The bar erupts in a riot of comments and opinions, but John doesn’t hear any of it. He’s focused on the picture of the culprit currently on screen. Of a man in his mid-thirties with dark brown hair and a small build. He’s wearing a white shirt and a Union Jack hat over a swarmy smirk. The man is Jim Moriarty.
“Wrong!” The voice is sudden and sends a spike of alarm across Lestrade’s senses. He stands, spinning to face the newcomer.
He spends the hour attempting to read a treatise on fae bonds, but is too wired to give it any proper attention. When the timer finally goes off, he pounces on it. The solution has now taken on a color reminiscent of muddy grass.
Getting back to the wall, took him shooting five men in the head, and taking a shot to the shoulder, but he made it. He gave Wiggins a chance.
A Devas is what I figured would be the Hindu equivalent of an angel, they are similar to demigods as far as I understood.
“Come on, you said you wanted to come,” Greg tells him, a phrase he has been repeating for three days now.
“Oh dear,” Seb sighs, going back to his chair. “It appears you can’t. No problem, I have no doubt your man will find you, working bond or not. We are very similar your Captain and I, he will come.” He slices another piece out of the apple, and holds it out, resting between his thumb and the blade. “It will just take a little longer. Apple?”
Allowing his mind to work on a separate problem, Sherlock spent his time in the morgue with his riding crop for an old cold case he was working on.
“It’ll be okay, Sherlock,” Lestrade says, though he doesn’t know if he believes it. “Where is your mate? I’ll send a car and an ambulance.”
Billy and Gary are shifting nervously on their seats as Lestrade flips through their books. John is pretty sure the detective isn’t even reading the books, but he hums every  once in awhile and it makes the two even more nervous.
“She really is a good detective,” Lestrade says with a shrug. “Come on then, I have something to show you.” He leads them to his office and pulls up a couple of video files on his computer. The first shows the vaults opening in the Bank of England, the only cause what seems to be a computer glitch. The second video is of the security going down and the gates opening at Pentonville Prison, apparently caused by the same computer glitch. The last video is of Moriarty.
Sherlock watched him, reading as much about the man as he could from the callouses on his fingers to the way he held himself. It was uncomfortable, being in the tiny room with no idea what to talk about, so, as usual, Sherlock broke the silence with the first thing that popped into his head. “You know, in older times we would have celebrated the bonding by taking first flight,” he mutters.
“Two someones, though it was indirectly. Lets just say it is in my best interest to see the man and his network six-feet under,” Moran said, rhythmically clenching his fist. Its a habit John has when agitated, Sherlock wondered if it was a military habit.
“Its a living,” Sherlock shrugs while handing over a pound note. “I’m looking for some information.”
Mycroft scowled, crossing his arms over his chest in irritation. “Meaning we were right, it could not possibly have cast those spells.”
“I don’t know what I’m looking for here, Sherlock,” he mutters. He thinks about sending the message across the bond, but even the thought makes his head ache and thinks better of it. He is pretty sure that with their bond Sherlock is already getting echoes of the pain, he’d rather not send the whole thing to his mate, just to ask a rhetorical question.
John and Bill had found the pool the moment they settled in London. There weren’t that many pools to choose from, and once Sherlock had posted about Carl Powers on his website, it didn’t take a consulting detective to confirm the location.
“What!?” Colonel shoots out of his chair. “Absolutely not. Neither of you are allowed on missions that haven’t been signed off by a one-star or higher.”
So Mycroft sits on a blanket in the middle of the park while reading a book, but really spending the time keeping an eye on his wayward sibling. Sherlock seems unaware of his dwindling Timer, or at least desperately trying to seem unaware.
Finding who had broken into the bank to leave a strange message, proved to be far more exciting then he expected.
Every one in the world is born with one half of a Soul Metal, the other half leading to their soulmate, but while living on the dangerous streets of London, the Holmes brothers have other issues to worry about.
John can feel the tension of the situation building in his chest. He wants his arms free and he wants desperately to get off the ground, but he doesn’t want to be taken away and beaten for answers like the others. It selfish, but true and the fear keeps him awake at night, when he should be grabbing a few hours of sleep like the others.
The poor girls are shaking, scared stiff, and incapable of even screaming. Though they whimper under his focused gaze.
“Is that what it is always like, so...loud?” Sherlock asks, it was almost like his own thoughts, mid-deduction.
Gabriel shrugs, “Probably, but they won’t do anything about it. They’ll just caulk it up to...mythos’ eccentricity or something.”
Charles Knight had been a biochemist with his PhD work in hormonal responses in pair bonds. He’d been a lead researcher in the lab that had existed before Baskerville became a military installation. Which is where he had meet Dr. Franklin over twenty years ago.
She takes a sip of her coffee and the scowl lessens. “You are so lucky you got that break in the robbery, or you would have never made Sergeant.”
The blond boy is shirtless now, revealing the the knot work of scar tissue on his shoulder. He would need a closer look at the wound to be sure, but it looks like John took care of the wound himself, cauterising what must have been a gaping hole with some sort of burning metal. He has different coloured bruises running along his ribs and arms, but there aren’t as many as Sherlock would expect for a boy that had won twenty fights in twenty days.
Sherlock stands nervously to the side, hands shoved in his pockets to keep himself from fidgeting. The arm that is revealed when they strip off John’s shirt probably looks worse than it actually is. Dried blood covers his skin, flecks fluttering to the ground when Stapleton starts looking at the gash.
“Show yourself,” John snarls, flicking his wings open to cast light on the creature. The angel’s glow reveals muscled flesh, the same dark red of its aura. It’s claws, curved talons like a  bear, gouge into the street with each lumbering step.
Unfortunately, the young man in the grey suit does feel the removal of his wallet from his back pocket as Sherlock slips by in the crowd. The man spins and grabs his arm, the grip is tight, but not bruising.
He starts with the dry ingredients. Pounding them into a fine powder with the pestle, careful not to let anything spill from the bowl. Once powdered, he adds the fresh blooms and works them into the mixture. The added moisture from the fresh cut flowers helps to work the mixture into a thick paste.
They take a cab to New Scotland yard, where Lestrade and Sally are waiting for them. Sally looks as unhappy to see them as ever. “Biggest crime wave of the century, I’m hardly surprised you are involved,” Sally snaps at them, John can practically hear the implied ‘freak’.
“She’s just sick,” the man snarls. He steps up to Helios and grabs her by the scruff. She snarls viciously beneath the muzzle, but can barely move.
He was working through his laptop search when it happened. John’s mind was a continuous chatter of background noise, he had mostly learned to ignore it, but he would have to be dead not to realize how jealous Irene was making him. It was the chatter that made it so hard for him to notice that John had left the room. Since the man was actually embedded in his mind it was as if he was always there.
Smith sighs, shoulders dropping. The room returns to a normal temperature as his shadow fades. “I know, John, but I’m not going to put you in training, not yet.”
“I’ll check on him, just hold on.” John scoops up another handful of crystals, hurrying over to the other man. He can see the rise and fall of his chest, but his curse marks are worse than Mycroft’s. John runs his fingers over the blackened flesh, infusing purifying energies through the stones. The marks fade slowly, clinging to their host. John removes everything that he can, but the taint clings to the man’s lungs. John can only hope the healers on base can take care of the rest of it.
“Well,” Mycroft sighs, watching her trail disperse. The once glowing blooms of the garden have dimmed to nothing, leaving only the fading scent of magnolias. With the dragon gone, the lengthening shadows of the garden seem rife with unknown threat.
When he turned to John, he shoved more of the packaged bandages in his wound, and wrapped the whole thing in a green cloth that looked like something straight out of WWII.
“It will have to be,” Sherlock murmurs, rubbing at his marks, which has started to give off heat like a sunburn.
John stumbles forward and slips into one of the large metal cages, the rounded bars bite into his knees as he falls through the entrance, but he ignores it in favor of slamming the door closed behind him and  latching it shut. The beast is an instant behind, slamming against the bars and snarling so viciously, gobs of saliva hang from its slavering jaws, splattering the cage floor. It tries to reach between the bars, but it’s paws are too large and only screech uselessly against the metal.
The lady gives him a curious once-over. Lestrade knows that Sherlock looks even younger than he is, but the kid has the otherworldly look of a mythos. He can tell from her expression that she comes to same conclusion and dismisses the idea that he could be a human child. “Yes, I teach wheel throwing and some hand building. Shelly Behling. I’ve been here, god, 14 years give or take.”
“Should we go to my CHU? I don’t have to share it,” Sherlock suggests, he can tell by John’s socks that he shares his quarters.
Lestrade shakes his head, “That isn’t a good idea, he’s in maximum security lock-up, and you know he’ll just screw with your head.”
His movement shows one the objects he had been studying. “That’s mine!” Mycroft says, startling John. He strides over to the table and runs his hand over an leather satchel, covered in hand-tooled runes.
Usually a bond mark was only made of two symbols, a combining of the traits brought into the union. The mark on Sherlock was an interlocking spiral of knowledge, danger, loyalty, justice, healer, scientist, protector, scholar, and some John didn’t recognize. After the fifth swirl of symbols, the mark continued in unconnected tribal-like circles that ended in a double sunburst on Sherlock’s shoulder.
John very much does not like the lab with everyone gone. It is eerily quiet, the only sound the soft buzz of the fluorescent lights. It reminds him of the hospital in Afghanistan, sure the hospital was packed after a convoy went wrong, but mostly it was quiet. The hospital also had a habit of leaving the least amount of lights on as possible to save power. The similarities make the hair on the back of his neck stand up.
Hamish wasn’t about to risk a taxi ride with blood on his sleeve. He took a staggering route back to his flat, carefully avoiding the CCTV.
“You alright John?” Uriel asks, resting her chin on her forearms so she can look up at him. Uriel’s voice is soft and melodic, the sort of tone John imagines people actually mean by the phrase ‘voice of an angel.’
“No,” Sherlock says tightly, “there won’t be anything to see.” He turns sharply and heads out the door.
Sherlock knows not to show fear, that it would only encourage the bully, but his violin was the last gift Mummy had given to him before the crash. Not only was it a reminder of a better life, but it was a source of income that Mycroft and he desperately needed. “You're right, I should have, why don’t you take my earnings,” Sherlock suggested, pointing at the open case. Mycroft always claimed he had no tack, but Sherlock knew how to employ diplomacy when absolutely necessary.
He tries to shake the feeling off as he steps through the main lab. His footsteps echo loudly in the large room. He pauses over the PCR equipment on a bank of cabinets. It is a brand he recognizes from school, and sits next to a very expensive machine for gel electrophoresis. “DNA and RNA work, but on what?” he ponders aloud.
Lestrade opens his mouth to ask what the hell he wants then, but closes it with a click. If Sherlock doesn’t need help from the ‘police’ then that means he needs help from Lestrade specifically. That can only mean one thing. “What did you do,” he growls into the reciever, “I can’t heal you, you know.”
For the amount of work put into it, the Army pays pennies, but when you live in the barracks and have no bills, saving money is easy. John was not married, does not have kids, and we assume does not own a car. In five years of service alone (and I'm assuming he probably served more) John should have something like 100,000 pounds in his account. Now you might say he used it to pay for college, but the Army is dying for surgeons, they would have taken care of his student loans, no problem. (For reference I was the second lowest rank in the U.S. Army when I was in Iraq, making something like 18,000 a year before taxes. After 10 months in Iraq I left with close to 20K in my bank account. Its mostly gone now because I bought a house, but honestly John. )
The next day they take Murray away for a few hours and when he comes back, he’s a bruised mess and his breathing sounds even worse.
“I’ll have all the proof Mrs. Hudson needs if I can just find…” Sherlock murmurs, dashing off the trail and into the swampland.
Sherlock’s face twisted for a moment, and John got an absolutely disturbing vision of Mycroft, before the thoughts settled. John could hear the whirl of deductions as Sherlock flicked his gaze over the women and then Mycroft. The thoughts were barely formed, snatches of words too quick to follow.
“It will be all right,” he says, and thinks it has to be, because he finally found him. In all the world, Sherlock found his perfect match in the form of this small army doctor, and he is here, standing with him, holding his hand. If that could happen, if, in all the world Sherlock could find John, then maybe he is a little optimistic after all. Maybe, just maybe, he has some hope.
Mrs. Hudson was ecstatic to see him and spent some while telling him about her dreadful time in Florida while they waited for the scones to come out of the oven.
“Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson were both bitten by the hound that caused your…” Dr. Stapleton waves vaguely at Henry’s arm, “If I can’t synthesize an antivenom soon then they very well could die. If you would be willing to donate plasma apheresis it would greatly help.”
The crime scene is on Chester Square, the sort of high end flat that has wards wrought from gold. Even he is stopped at the door, the spellwork is excellent, pricking at his skin and nearly bringing his wings to the surface.
“Hello,” John calls as well, and with a furtive glance around the Terrace, pulls his wings from their portal.
Something about the way he says it ‘a fan’ lights up his mind palace, but he pushes it away. He’ll examine it later. “The venom, Doctor, where is the antidote?”
Mycroft held in a curse only through years of practice. Sherlock looked very interested. “The leader was attempting to break into a human trafficking ring in London, this was Moriarty’s message to the rest of the gang. The three girls were dropped off at the police station not long after.”
“A Golem,” Lestrade mulls it over. “Yes, that would be possible, but a sculpt that large would take a class 9 at least. That seems like a lot of effort to kill someone, we don’t have an ID yet though, maybe he was important.”
It takes John a long time to realize his meaning. The thought is… “That’s not,” John runs a trembling hand through his hair. “That’s not possible. Boston still stands, a Guardian remains as long as their city does.”
“Bit of a headache,” he admits, rubbing at his temple. The flash on his palm distracts him. He pulls his hand away to look at his palm, where a glowing blue rune of the justice scales are now etched. “I don’t bloody believe it,” he’s honestly awed. Nearly forty-years old, and he meets his soul mate in the older brother of his obnoxious consulting detective.
Sherlock stumbles before turning. “I can explain to them what happened. They’re idiots, they won’t realize he was left handed.”
Tianlong resembles a tapestry come to life, a serpentine figure resplendent in scales of gold and silver. Her body moves in hypnotic twists and turns, never pausing. She turns to them with eyes of liquid gold.
When John fires his first weapon it feels completely natural. His breathing is calm and even, his wrist is strong, taking the surprising brunt of the backlash. Of course, he misses completely, but he calmly takes aim, steadies his grip, breathes, and shoots. The second shot hits true and so does the third and fourth. He doesn’t have to fire the fifth.
John reaches for them instantly, drawn to the pure white glow shimmering off them. “What are these,” he asks, picking up a flat brown stone with white and black striations running through it. It burns against his palm, but it is a pleasant heat.
Lestrade had looked surprised, he certainly expected the bond to take or he would not have suggested it.
John had to watch his Mum fade. He was old enough to remember when she was warmth and love and home, but he was also young enough that he could not leave the flat as she grew to be sadness, pain, and heartache.  Unlike his sister, who, at 16, fled the house after her Vision and never came back.
John knew they had to be careful, if an officer spotted Helios then John would get dragged off to an institution without so much of a by your leave. There had been a homeless man off King Street with a feathered adder, it wasn’t even a proper mythical creature, but the police had swept him off the street and into a mental health facility.
“Aren’t there hospitals a little closer?” Greg asks, because he’s almost positive they already passed one.
John and Mycroft sit huddled together over the tray between their seats, the mission files laid out for review. “I just don’t understand how a guardian just disappears,” John sighs, pulling one of the pages filled with pictures towards him. The pictures are all of various statues around Boston, taken in places the statues definitely shouldn’t be.
“Bluebell is the only live mammal I’m currently working with, but she will work just fine for this,” Stapleton says, going over to the wire cage. She carefully holds the rabbit down and injects the venom into the thick fur at the base of her neck. “It will take time for that to work through her system and produce the antibodies. For now I think I have a solution for your arm. It’s just the ulna that is broken correct?”she asks, turning to John.
Sherlock couldn’t face him, could not stand to see the pity on his brother’s face. He shook his hand off, “Its for the best.” He slammed the door on his way out just because he could.
There is warmth in his chest, comfort. A sense of security. He’s safe, but no, the feathers twist, curling inwards. Gold turns to rust, white bleeds black. The brilliant wings burst in unholy light, feathers exploding in all directions.
Greg wonders how this public school kid wound up living rough, he carries himself like he should be dressed in Savile Row best, not thrift store throwaways. “That’s hardly four blocks away. I’ll make you a deal. Introduce me to your brother, I’ll tell him what you’ve been up to, and we won’t have to get you processed at a station. How’s that sound kid?”
“Carol, the woman in the park you were seen meeting with, she was murdered,” Lestrade needed to get everyone back on track.
RPG: Rocket Propelled Grenade (Those launched in Iraq and Afghanistan are usually old cold war stuff stolen from Russia, and it really is a surprise when they actually manage to blow up)
“Sorry, I just really need to…” Lestrade shrugs out of his jacket, pulling his wings forward in the same movement. He’s careful not to flap, there is hardly any room and Sally would kill him if he disturbed the papers. Still, he manages to carefully stretch them, finally scratching that itch that has been bothering him since they left the crime scene.
“A fae?” Lestrade gives Mrs. Hudson another look. She certainly has a magical aura, but he would guess magi not mythos.
John could take the hint. Sherlock needs to think - away from him. They have practically been living in each other’s pockets since Baskerville, really since they met. He understands the need for solitude. John gives Sherlock a reassuring smile. He reaches out and takes his forearm. There are about three layers of clothing between them, but he still feels the bond spark up in response. “If you need me,” John says, tone firm, “Call.”
Bauza takes lead, with Z and Murray not far behind. Harry is just behind them with John following as closely as he can with Don hopping at his shoulder.
When the time is up, they walk into the Visionary. The room is blank, white walls with a white floor and a bright light shinning down on it all. Sherlock feels pain build behind his eyes, his heart beat speeds with the knowledge that soon he will be seeing scenes of the future.
Lestrade sends a series of text messages to Sherlock to make sure he is alright, but the idiot detective isn’t responding and he is not at Baker Street. He does receive a message from an unknown number that say “If brother has green ladder, arrest brother.” The text makes zero sense, but its exactly the sort of thing Sherlock would send. Sure enough, the woman does have an older brother that, for whatever reason, owns a green ladder.
Sherlock’s eyes widen, “Of course, how did I never notice? Stupid. You’ve been pulling a 30 centimeter knife out of your pocket, no sheath, nothing. You’ve been summoning it every time.”
“Q pod, hmm, what number?” Sherlock asks, checking the man’s hands. They were washed, but there are clear signs of blood beneath the fingernails, he had tried to stop the bleeding.
He stands, walking to the other side of the body, no one stops him. “These jeans are well worn, a favorite pair, but not dirty. They were washed recently, same with the hoodie. He gestures to the faded symbol on the shirt, interlocking triangles set as a star. “That is the sigil for the Summoner’s College of London, judging by the wear and the staining on his fingers, he has been training for at least 2 years.”
“God, yes!” John agrees slipping into the car. His arm gives a twinge of complaint as he settles. The printed cast has been working wonderfully, the plastic case making bathing much easier than a traditional cast, but it is so light he often forgets he is wearing it. He looks at it now, the red cast obscures his soul marks, but can’t hide the black left over from the bite. Dr. Stapleton’s shot had done it’s job, the worst of the spider-web marking has even faded. The marks under the bite were permanently scarred and blackened, but the rest of the marks had taken a strange black outline.
He could see the snipers now, settling into position along the pool roof. There were only two of them, thank god. John set his sights on the one furthest from him, but did not fire.
Lestrade stays silent for a long time, but finally he sighs. He claps Sherlock on the shoulder, flinching when the collar moves, but the coat doesn’t sting him. “You can’t get emotional about this. The cases, they can’t be... personal.”
The light gleams gold, like sunlight on steel. He’s drawn in, peering closer and closer at the speck until his eyes burn. Tears stream down his face, but he feels like if he could just get a little closer, see a little more, than he could find his answers.
Mycroft moved the tip of his brolly from side to side as he contemplated what to share with his brother. “ Two months ago, a body was found outside of a Chinese gambling ring, gutted with a hunting knife. The body was confirmed as Sebastian Moran, Moriarty’s head sniper and one of the men from the pool incident. The man in that picture took the name when he started to work with Moriarty; however, he is very much a different sort of threat. The original Moran was prone to gambling and bouts of rage, an easy target.”
John was an orphan, than a doctor, than a soldier. He’d be damned if he let this mad man separate him from his daemon. He pulls against his cuffs until he feels his thumbs pop out of joint. It barely stings compared to everything else. He frees himself from the cuffs and pops his thumbs back into place with the ease of a trained doctor.
Sherlock wanders the halls. There is a dog barking in the distance, a sound that would have once brought him joy now sends his heart skittering. He turns away from the sound, goes deeper.
It was broad daylight, making a place for the poisoning harder to find, but judging by the cab’s turns, they were heading for the warehouse district.
“She wasn’t making much sense, started talking about the Lotus and a...Who...Wu, something like that,” Lestrade tsks, frustrated.
When they take Z, he looks nervous, but still strides out of the room with all the grace one can with their hands chained behind their back. He returns with a broken nose and a limp, but gives them a bloody grin when he’s chained beside Murray again.
Sherlock pouted, he hated being told he was too young for something, but his Mummy’s eyes looked sad, best to ask more questions later.
He actually can’t see the second set all that well, but he has a perfectly good view of the first. Where the bullet had pierced him in the middle of his coverts, the feathers that had survived the fire are now black, the color radiating outward like an infection. His shoulder looks even worse. The jumper Mycroft had given him had probably saved his life, but even it stood little chance against fiendfyre. Beneath the burnt wool, the wound is still open and weeping black pus, the surrounding tissue angry and inflamed. Black marks radiate out from the entry and towards his back, the first edges of his scapulars already tainted. It isn’t spreading, he can tell that much. Whether it was Mycroft’s healing or the ascension, the infection has been stopped in its path, but the remnants, John knows, are permanent.
The man tries to adjust his aim to John, but he is already on him, kicking him straight in the nose as he crashes into the sniper’s ledge. There is a scuffle, John takes the butt of a rifle straight to his temple, but manages to grab the weapon before another hit can crack his skull.
Sherlock is clearly stunned. He stares wide-eyed at Mrs. Hudson, mouth open in slack-jawed amazement. “You would, we could...I’m sure there is a more suitable bondmate.”
Mycroft pulls the last of the power stored in the brolly and runs -as best he can- for the door. The noise had attracted attention. He can already hear the shouts in the distance. He can’t cast the illusionary spell from before, but with his sight pulled to the forefront, he just manages to avoid detection.
They make their way down the train slowly. John takes the lead, Witness at the ready. The passengers are surprisingly patient, sitting and waiting after helping those that had fallen. Glow-globes in a rainbow of colors fill the cars, casting the floor in a strange twist of light.
“What?” Lestrade startles, shooting him a look. “I...well I have no idea honestly. I sort of assumed he was one of those people that just didn’t have one.”
“The most secure holding cell we have, not that it will do much good considering,” Lestrade answered, disgruntled.
Sherlock practically claws over his shoulder to snatch the phone. “They closed the case! They ruled it an accident!”
“Could you use me?” Sherlock asked, rolling up his sleeves. His mark is still marred and the skin is flushed and hot to the touch, but the creeping black lines haven’t grown any larger.
It takes five days for them to be back on their feet. By then Lestrade has left, returning to London and Scotland Yard. Billy and Gary are surprisingly accommodating, giving them a discount and bringing them bowls of minestrone soup when John and Sherlock are too exhausted to even go downstairs.
Mycroft collapses, splattering his clothes with mud. He can feel the warm muck sinking to his skin, but doesn’t care. His magic is drained, the channels of his focus scraped raw. “Neither can I,” he admits.
He must have said something useful, because Sherlock shoots up with a surprised exclamation, “Oh!” He presses a series of numbers on the pad and pushes the door open with a triumphant grin.
John sat on the arm of the chair, completely unaware of the domestic scene he presented beside his brother. “This new one is more dangerous?”
Q avoids looking at Mycroft directly, a flush of color spreading across his cheeks. “I...ah...I’m not sure. I haven’t reached its limits yet, but I know the wood will give a warning if you store too much.” He fusses with the second object, a small black pouch with a drawstring. He tilts the bag on it’s side and a collection of different stones tumble out.
Sherlock watches John for a moment, before his whole face brightens. “Oh!” he exclaims, “OH!” He grabs John by his shoulders and spins him around. “It’s the Daemons, they were all birds!” He leaps over to one of the dusty arm chairs in the room and pulls a handbag from beside it. The bag is old and torn and looks very familiar.
Barrymore lets out a huff, “Twenty-four hours Mr. Holmes, not a second longer.” He marches away from them at quick-time, each step a punctuation of his irritation.
They work together to carry the dog down to Stapleton’s lab after informing Major Barrymore about what had occurred. He was incensed that a member of his staff had experimented behind his back, and moves quickly to have the power fixed. The hunt for Dr. Franklin, however, reveals nothing but his emptied lab.
John joins between Ruiz and Smith, his magic completing the protections. He pulls Witness, aiming both guns down the cavern.
After a few days Lestrade is so confused and frustrated that a dark blue cord of desperation suddenly appears from his chest and stretches across London. Lestrade is stubborn, but not an idiot, he breaks down and makes the call.
“I was wondering where you got off to, Seb. I’m afraid Haddock’s associates were none to pleased to scrape his brain matter off the wall.”
“The freak got a gun turned on him when he confronted the killer,” she growls, furious. “Lucky for that idiot, his mate jumped in the way and took the man down before he even knew what happened. He broke the killer’s wrist in the process, but other than that everyone is okay.”
Sherlock is instantly curious, which is of course when Mycroft tries to change the subject, “Where is Mr. Hawthorne? I need to speak to him.”
Lestrade belatedly realizes he’s pulled his wings out. Twice in one day, he needs to get a grip on himself. In the bedroom his wings, already large, look massive, filling the space and blocking out the light from the window. He pulls them back in, disappearing them with a thought. The look Sherlock is giving him makes him feel like a cad. He takes a deep breath, “I’m sorry.” He sighs, “I overreacted. That just isn’t... you just can’t say things like, okay? Besides, hardly anyone knows what I am.”
Stapleton remains calm in the face of his tone. She seals the container and stands to face him. “This poison was developed to remove bond marks, it did not pose much of a military use, but Dr. Frankland insisted it could have future use.”
“Sorry,” he murmurs, running his fingers along the lapel with a whisper of a drying spell. The coat is spelled to repel water, but hours under snowfall is a bit beyond the spell. During the walk back he contemplates the build of a stronger weatherproofing spell. Or a potion, perhaps with pooka fur, hmm.
The line beeps, Mycroft having hung up on his end. “Shite,” Sherlock growls, slamming the phone down. He stomps up to his room on principle, and lets his door slam when he realizes Mycroft managed to evade the question. Who is John?
John took control of the matter swiftly, holding Sherlock’s head in place so he could properly deepen the kiss.
John went to the nearest hotel and used some of the money that had been collecting in his account to rent a room. The kid at the front desk, glared at both of them, but he couldn’t say anything when the card went through.
The older man curses and brings his knee up. The blow hits John in the groin, making him curl up in pain. “Little whelp, you should learn to respect your betters,” Moran snarls, bringing his knee up again to crunch against John’s nose.
“Mission?” John asks, not keeping the anger from his tone. “I thought we were training for a couple of months.”
John scuffed his boot, feeling a blush build in his cheeks. “Yeah, that was me,” he licks his lips, “but my sister got caught during a food raid, I never should have let her go. Never should have let them put me on the helicopter, but I had to make sure the other kids were okay.”
“Christ!” Lestrade jumps, “Wear a bell or something.” He holds up his phone, “They identified the body. One Carl Powers, age 18, a class 7 Summoner and second year student at the Summoner’s College.”
Sherlock takes the chain with shaking hands. He gulps as it unravels, revealing a small golden ring, its band twisting in a pattern so familiar, Sherlock would know it in his dreams. He unhooks the clasp on his own chain and pulls both rings free.
The call to Mycroft takes a while and involves a great deal of arguing, but in the end, it is agreed that Sherlock can have 24 hours access to the labs. Which shows, as if John didn’t know, exactly how important Mycroft actually is.
“I think it is time I turned in for the night. It will be best to do the summoning tomorrow when we are both better rested,” Mycroft says, pushing away from the desk. His back cracks as he stands.
“A Mythos created when an animal is possessed by a demon that feeds on anger. Once the Ilimu consumes enough human flesh, it is capable of shifting its shape at will. The more powerful of them are capable of transforming into any creature they consume. The Ilimu we saw was only just beginning its transformation.”
“It’s a law, brother mine, and if you ever want to work with the police than you need your vision posted in the archives.”
John stares out at the bay for a long time. There is a knot in his chest, squeezing and painful. Mycroft stays at his side, silent, waiting.
Navamas leads them to one of the many tables filling the floor space. “Sit, sit. I bring you a proper feast.”
“Hmm,” John hums, “they taught us all sorts of different things at the Compound. I can’t use any of the Summoner’s arts, no Angel can, but it’s still good to know.”
John released his arm, with an overriding need to see his own mark. He tugged off his jumper and undershirt, slinging them to the side. Though they had shaken hands the normal way, John was surprised to find his mark on his left arm. It was a mirror of Sherlock’s, except the sunburst on his shoulder encircled his bullet wound.
John is only allowed a brief glimpse before Sherlock and an older man slip through the lab door. Heart pounding, John darts down the hall and returns to class.
“Detective?” Mrs. Hudson calls, looking worried, despite her greying appearance, and the strain clear on her face.
“Shit,” he snarls. “Fuck!” he growls, kicking the door jam, promptly forgetting his worry about Mrs. Hudson. He runs into the bedroom, grabs his gun, an extra mag, and his jacket before stomping down the stairs at full speed.
“Hardly a surprise,” Sherlock coughs out, “You even grew tired of dear Seb, even though the marks on his arm say he is your match in every way, you still tried to get rid of them. You were the the reason Dr. Franklin started working on his serum again, he had let it go after Charlie’s death.”
With a shiver, John sends most of the towels fluttering off the bed, whoops. “But we can stop it can’t we? They aren’t released yet.”
“We were in..in..inseparable, Da would take us on walks on the m..m..mo..moors,” Henry twitches strongly on the last word, like a flinch.
Sherlock cusses up a storm, kicking up rocks in his frustration. “That moron!” he snarls. He should go after him and shake some sense into him, but he did his job, he repaid his debt. Its not his fault if the idiot doesn’t listen. He contemplates going after him, maybe helping him out with whatever madness the boy is getting involved in, but decides against it.
Agent Smith holds out a business card. It’s thick white cardstock and completely blank. Mycroft takes the card and feels the sharp pulse of a psychic impression. It is forceful, but benign in nature, so Mycroft allows the barest lowering of his shields. The information the card relays is a series of images and the firm knowledge that MI6’s base of operations is located in a series of tunnels hidden in the London underground. He also gets an impression that he should go there tomorrow at 0600.
Mycroft was in the kitchen fixing a cup of tea, which was possibly the strangest thing John has ever seen.
He takes a seat on the mat in front of the statue, crossing his legs in the extremely uncomfortable method he had studied before coming. He unties the small package he had acquired in town, a small offering of sweets. “I hope this works,” he murmurs, placing the offering in front of him.
Sherlock left the bed with care, not wanting to wake the sleep-deprived soldier. The kitchen was its usual mess, but the kettle was clean and he found two cups that hadn’t held body parts, at least not recently.
The demon laughs at their mad scramble. With a wave of his hand a barrier forms in the tree line, circling the lake. They’re trapped. “I think I will try my meal roasted,” he taunts, and starts to unwind the cloth covering his brow.
“I suppose not, but you two shouldn’t have gone harrowing off without back-up! How hard is it to tell me what is going on?” Lestrade yells at them. Now that the adrenaline is wearing off, his headache is getting worse. His gift is going haywire, he can see connection lines all over the place, everything from the slimmest fishing line to the massive thing binding the two idiots before him.
“Well Z would have stayed in forever, but he met his bondmate and it was all downhill from there. I’m not sure who decided to give that man a license for a bar of all things, but he seems happy,” Murray shrugs.
“I don’t know why you are insisting on this ridiculous farce when you are clearly exhausted, but fine. And please do refrain from calling me kid, my name is Sherlock.”
The others are bored, much like John himself. He sighs, swinging his legs over the perch for a better seat. There’s no class today, their teacher off doing who knows what, though they had been told that Agent Smith would be dropping by. John briefly considers convincing the dour-faced man to take them to the range, but Agent Smith could only be visiting for one reason, Introduction.
John lingers on the platform, on the edge of the precipice in more ways than one. He tips over, wings extended. His muscles pull, a pleasant ache that guides him in a lazy circle to the ground. He doesn’t mean too, but he’s showing off. The glide shows the full extent of his impressive wings. He pulls them back for a clean landing, feathers arching in a display of white and gold.
Mycroft jerks, like he’s been slapped, eyes widening. “Oh! Yes we were kidnapped, a man broke into the house and drugged our tea. My security detail was expertly dodged in between shift changes. The planning involved was military, it wasn’t Moriarty's doing.”
John can only imagine what a severed level three bond for the majority of your life would do to one’s psyche, it certainly explains the ticks.
“They are you know, out there somewhere,” John taps at the feather closest to him, where the golden tip has taken on a silver sheen. “Please don’t give up.”
There is magic in the wood, as there is in all Stradivarius instruments, and it reaches out to him now in response, a haunting tone all of it’s own. He runs his fingers over the smooth wood, leaving impressions of his own magic behind. It is a soothing ritual.
Sherlock busied himself preparing a cup, so he did not have to see Mycroft’s smug face when he entered the room.
“Mycroft!” John shoots, kneeling at his side. “What did they do to you?” he breathes, hesitant to touch. His face is bruised and swollen, black curse lines slithering beneath the surface.
“Course I did,” John sighs, leaning into her hold. His sister is alive! When she moves back a bit he can tell she has lost some weight. Her cheeks are sunken and her eyes are dark with lack of sleep, but she looks relatively okay. “What happened?”
Sherlock leads the way like he knows exactly where they are going. Greg guesses he must have memorized to map online or something. They go down to the basement level, which is as creepy as Greg expects considering it contains the morgue as well as the research lab.
“Don’t move,” Lestrade orders and slips back under. Affixing a bond to a family name usually requires the head of the household and a ceremony, but Lestrade can force it if he pushes enough power into it.
It takes him longer than he would like, every passing moment is more time Sherlock is stuck with Moriarty’s mate and possibly Moriarty himself. He curses himself for telling him about the kidnapping. It is his fault the man broke out of jail.
“Brought some greasy noodles,” he yelled, pushing open the door with his shoulder. He could hear the news droning on in the background. John had been watching the news nonstop since they had left the hospital.
Lyons flicks his gaze around, obviously trying to catch sight of someone higher ranking to deal with the politics.
Lestrade takes in the scene. The victim is a young male, no older than twenty, just a kid really, in a ratty hoodie and jeans. He leans down, checking the bottom of the shoes. “There’s a bit of ink on his soles, stepped past the barrier circle I reckon.”
He shakes his head, mane sending droplets of water in all directions. “I do not. There have been whispers in the dark, but I have yet to hear the name of the creature that has been absorbing Guardians.”
He goes straight to Mycroft’s house, not bothering to call ahead. This isn’t a conversation to have over the phone. The cabbie speeds the whole way there, clearly driven by what John can only imagine is a murderous look on his face. John has worked himself into such a mood, that he might have actually kicked Mycroft’s door in if it hadn’t opened just as he reached it.
He gags at the sight. The walls are lined in chains, but only three of them are holding bodies. The body to his right is beyond saving, an unrecognizable smear. It takes him a moment to recognize Mycroft. His chest is bare, left only in the tattered remains of uniform pants. His boots are long gone, bare feet a riot of leaking wounds. His arms are chained above his head, the fingers on both hands are clearly broken.
The main room of the Met was swarming with Sergeants and Detectives going about their day, but the entire room seemed to halt at their entrance.
“It isn’t a guarantee you know. Just because two people are born with the same...trinket when they are born doesn’t guarantee eternal happiness.  Honestly, we hardly know each other and I’m a mess, seriously. This leg, my scars, I have nightmares that leave me screaming. Why would you want that? Why would anyone?” John could feel his heart clench, he did not want to be saying these things. There was a reason why he had only managed to talk to a therapist once, but he figured if anyone deserved the truth it would be the person that was supposed to be his other half, guarantee or not.
