“In the end, the Church of England inherited it all, didn’t they?”
Mrs Hudson, who led him into our flat, was already displeased by the disruption. She had just brought us an early dinner. I had looked forward to a few minutes of peace with Sherlock, indulging in our landlady’s excellent cooking, which convinced even Sherlock to drop everything and come to the table. I had put out proper crockery, opened a bottle of wine, and switched on the radio for some background classic music.
Without further delay, it's time for the canon (!) rimjob in "The Canterbury Tales" to get the Johnlock treatment. Last time to turn around, as from now on the rating is for a reason^^
Now, most people acted as if they were not even Good Ones. That with fire came demonic power, the Gates of Hell wide open. That someone like Sherlock Holmes, whose gifts abounded with skills foreign and strange for mortals, was a freak. They needed him, but they feared him more. With each passing day, they believed in him less.
“Who wants to know?” Dr Neil asked.
Sherlock Holmes had been born on a Wednesday under a scorching, burning sun, long before the first God. After the Prophecy of Revelations, the Jinn had been given a choice: convert to Islam or live their lives as heretic demons. Obviously, Sherlock had chosen
John watched his face in the mirror as he spoke, staring at his sensual lips.
"It's normal. You have other concerns on your mind,
“With a lot of swearing. Or, if I don’t do it immediately,
The newspaper on my lap reported the release from police custody of a known criminal, Tobias Organ, arrested some days previously for the murder of Max Zimmermann, a moneylender, who was shot through the head in his small apartment in Murrow Street. In the end, there is insufficient evidence to charge Organ with murder. Even the police thought him clearly capable of it.
Here, they had no cliffs that looked almost the same as the Cornish coast. Here, it was not the flattest and missing hedges as it is so iconic for England.
Because his work is almost as strikingly beautiful as the man is himself.
She showers them with her very own brand of affection, and oh, her boys need it. Nice words, and how they flourish! They both have a sweet tooth, and while Sherlock keeps his secret well-hidden to the outside world, he cannot hide it from her.
Yes, I do know that it's September, but who wants to be normal? And I don't know about the region you live, but here, it's rainy, foggy and grey all day long, hence, one needs some cheering up. Further, sexytimes with Holmes and Watson is aways a goer, isn't it?
“You will regret not being dead, Holmes!”
“You are not very sympathetic to this unfortunate woman.
Ashamed of my weakness, I got up. About ten policemen surrounded me, mocking faces. Fortunately, Lestrade was not among them.
t mistaken when he deduced our Baker Street Irregulars would win in under an hour.
When we have seated ourselves on the sofa in front of the fireplace, tumblers filled with good whiskey at the ready, Watson turns to me.
"By this snow?" I continued, surprised by this reserve towards me. "Dr Lewis won't be here for a good hour. If Miss Parker isn’t opposed to it, I can take care of her."
“Thank you, doctor. Yes, you’re quite right.” He stopped, clearly planning the next sentence in his head. A habit all too understandable: it did not fit well with men to the only rule with the mind. Yet we have to master our emotions. “I can’t live without knowing what has happened to him, Watson. I have taken it up myself to bring light into this mess.”
SHERLOCK HOLMES’
It has been close for two weeks until Christmas, and as it seemed: Sherlock Holmes' plan works well.
John Watson's deductions abilities are tested on a Victorian-era ivory sex toy.
The next voice was of his father:
“I can search for the biscuits; otherwise, you will disturb my experiments. Look out for nitrite acid. There was a little mishap yesterday.”
"Yes, Mr Holmes. And now I have told you everything that my professional conscience has allowed me to tell you. I can't do anything more for you, gentlemen."
nowadays.
The ride took almost half a day, and I could hardly imagine a time when one could make the trip in under five hours in the future. Already the trip on the Southern Western Railway from Waterloo Bridge took close to three hours. Oh yes, I had time to indulge in my private fantasies, and I was grateful that the newspaper I pretended to read I could drop in my lap when I got carried away, and that I was travelling with the most observant man in all of England unless it comes to matters of the heart concerning himself.

HOLMES: When he made a snatch for this one. Now that we have your little memorandum book, Professor, do you think of anything else you would like before Billy goes?
“Landsbury Charles: born April 23, 1843, in London. His father is Sir Henri Landsbury, an officer in the English army. His mother is Mary Jane Winslow, daughter of fruit and vegetable wholesaler James Winslow.
“Thanks, Sherlock. I’m fine, so no need to molly-coddle me.” Watson knows he sounds harsh,
Halfway conscious, John grabbed the smartphone and started typing.
Who might write and about what and to whom...?
In a corner, we found the former doctor. I thought Sherlock would be more subtle, but he almost headed immediately in his direction after having scanned the crowd.
Lestrade’s face, which had been red from the frost outside, had kept its colour, now from rage.
"It sounds like a statement, you know?" Holmes still amused himself by increasing the redness in my face. I looked away.
“Not answering my questions.” John sounds stern. He has to. One has to keep a clear head, and it has always been his part. That he never wanted it is irrelevant.
"An organized gang?"
When looking over Sussex's countryside, you could not be sure until the language gave it away if you were not on the continent. As lovely as Belgium was, Sherlock Holmes was no Poirot.
I huffed something unintelligent and offered Lestrade a brandy. He gulped it down, clearly distressed.
It wasn’t difficult.  The figure had stumbled over something, a stray bit of rubbish or brick.  As he jolted to a stop so did they, automatically, and although Sherlock recovered his surprise quickly and kept going, John knew it was his own reaction which gave them away.  An actor, he was not.  Seeing John’s startled expression and then his admittedly terrible attempts at looking away like he
sat in his pyjamas on a Friday night, curled up on the sofa, trying to talk quietly enough that Mrs Hudson wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop, and talking about a boy to what would probably qualify as his best friend if he was the type of person who had best friends.
“It’s Sherlock alright?!”  So much for toning it down.
"My- You know what my feelings are!"
“So what’s wrong then?”
.  “We could still turn around.”
“And what’s that?”
“Yes,” was the reply, a short glance over to John before his gaze returned to the bookshelf, haphazardly filled with various stacks of books yet to be properly sorted or which were being pulled down.
“Yeah I bloody noticed.  It’s like having a fucking omen following me round the streets.”
Unhelpfully the car also came with Mycroft attached.
“We could power most of Europe with the amount of cake you eat.”  It was not his best but he was rusty after all.  He had not had the unpleasant experience of his brother’s company for some time.  This was not aided by the fact his face was mashed into a pillow as a result of him lying on his front.
Page after page of sketches and drawings of himself looked back at him.  One of him hiding a laugh, several of him at rugby, scowling, drawing, arguing, and (Sherlock’s personal favourite) the soft look he reserved for when Sherlock said something accidently sweet without realising.  All captured in pencil and even a few in ballpoint pen.
He paused by a corner sofa, considering the space of the room and Sherlock slid up next to him.  Considering how this mess started and the fact he did not want to be kicked out of (another) shop, John eyed him cautiously.  The pout was back.
There were three doors leading out of the room, the one he’d just come from, a wooden one on the far-left of the room and one directly in front of him, with frosted glass that looked like it led to an office.  If he had to bet, he would guess Sherlock had headed to the office first but there was also the possibility he was going to walk in on the manager and somehow have talk his way out of it.
“No.  But you already knew that.”
“And you know how they’re all connected,” Sherlock continued, still scowling as he moved to the opposite side of the desk.  Adrenaline had kicked in reflexively when he heard about the case and was built up with no avenue of release so he began to pace.
symbol.
Sherlock just huffed.  John sighed.
"Hello John," he said, smiling at him and John's heart rate sped up at just the sound.
And, by some miracle, John actually listened.  A hand caressed him and his head fell back.  As John’s mouth touched him, a guttural moan ripped out his throat.  The hand John had left on his thigh squeezed in response.  His feet arched and his toes scrunched into the carpet.  The feeling was like a pulsing coursing throughout his body, the epicentre thrumming in his stomach.  His focus was narrowed down to the points where his body met John’s.  Experimentally, he rolled his hips, just slightly further into the wet heat of John’s mouth.  John inhaled sharply and then moaned, sinking down further, and
Well, it was nice for a bit anyway, John thought as he went to go see what his mad genius was up to now.
“We’re going to need the database,” Sherlock said without looking.  “Please,” he added, an afterthought.
“We have been working from the idea that the Council limits have been breached and the fact they didn’t know this.  But we only have evidence for half of that statement.”
Who?  Wait, you’ve called me that before.
“Why not?”
“So we should-“
Decision made.  Date imminent.  Panic contained….for now.
Sherlock swallowed and the taste of John, although not strictly pleasant, had him shivering.  John slumped back onto his knees, trying to avoid crushing Sherlock’s chest as he struggled to get his breathing back in check.  While he waited for John to return to him fully, Sherlock rocked his hips back and forth against John’s arse and soon John was rocking with him.  He sighed at the feeling and leant back against the pillows, shutting his eyes as heat pooled in his stomach.  He then whined as John moved away, rolling so he was pressed up against Sherlock’s side instead.
It took him a moment to realise John was talking to him.  For a while his mind was shockingly blank until he caught Molly staring at him, frantically mouthing the words “Thank him” behind John’s back.
He coughed and said, at normal volume, “I’ll be fine.”
“Doesn’t look unimportant.  You should let a Healer look at you.”  It would be touching if he wasn’t obviously evading something, shifting on his feet as if to bolt back down the stairs.
“Hoisted by your own neatness Mallory,” Sherlock said.
“What?” she said, turning back to tea and pointedly inspecting the counter tops.
“What?” he snapped.
) and nervously carried on while questioning his own sanity.  The boy noticed Sherlock’s respectful gaze and grinned, before retrieving a battered looking notebook, scribbled something and turned it to Sherlock.
Everyone jumped and turned.  Stood in the doorway was a young man in black tracksuit bottoms and matching zipped hoodie, spiky brown hair and a wild look in his eyes.
“I’m sorry,” John said before he could say more.
Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever been happier in fact.  University had given him a freedom he hadn’t experienced before, given him the space to do what he wanted so long as he completed the necessary deadline pieces, which surprisingly, were sometimes interesting.  Another plus was that he could keep an indistinct schedule, sometimes appearing in lectures, sometimes electing not to go, making it easier to evade Mycroft’s constant interference.  This, along with his ever increasing knowledge of London’s backstreets and alleyways, provided a working map of both respectable and not so respectable areas that he could access for his own purposes such as his increasing desire to actually be allowed onto a human crime scene.
“I believe the exact words were ‘Favourites are a stupid concept based on environmental and social pressures and stimuli’ but also secretly it’s blue.”
Lestrade waited until they were out of the station and part way down Baker Street, out of the ear shot of other Guards, before he started talking.

was obvious.  In fact, it didn’t even register on the system.
Jasmine, clearly seeing him floundering, bounced up to him and began introducing him to people, often with the title ‘Sherlock’s John’.  This intro often caused people to pause and do a quick, silent assessment of him from head-to-toe.  After the fourth time, Jasmine seemed to clock his confusion and laughed.  “They’re just curious is all.  We’ve all been dying to meet the ever mysterious John,” she teased.  He wondered what they were thinking when they looked at him.  Was he what they were expecting?  Probably not.  Did they like him?  That remained to be seen.  Most people made nice small talk with him but then again they did that with every person.  The only person he’d conversed with properly all day was Jasmine, and he wasn’t sure whether this was because she genuinely liked him, pitied him, or just didn’t want him ruining her party by being grouchy.
One of the thugs launched at Sherlock.  Sherlock scrambled backwards and, with his back to the wall, kicked the aggressive angel in the face.  The angel reeled, holding a bloody nose, and Sherlock darted into John’s eye line, this time in front of him.  As far as he could make out, he hadn’t been injured, moving fast enough that the other guy couldn’t grab him.  But what Sherlock was unaware of was that this placed him in direct line of the other thug.  The second man had prepared an attack, and was ready to pounce.  John saw him lunge and, with alarm, saw something glinting in his hand.  Weapon.  Sherlock jumped back, losing his footing and falling to the floor, exposed and vulnerable.  Without conscious thought, John pushed a wave of energy out, causing the lights to flicker and dim momentarily, and knocking both the henchmen and the club manager (who had yet to speak a word) out cold.
Sherlock
“Ugh, never mention my brother again, the thought of him makes me physically ill.  You’re turning people into heroes again,” Sherlock warned.
He didn’t feel that lucky.
“John?”  Oh yeah, Kate.  John had completely forgotten that he was only supposed to be getting a drink and returning to a conversation.  Kate looked concerned.  “You leaving?”
GCG was at his table.
If he ever made it through this house.  Had he taken over the entirety of East Kensington?  He knew Mycroft shared his disdain for other people but this was taking the piss.  When he had found and successfully navigated the stairs without falling down them, there was another corridor to trudge down to where he presumed the kitchen was, based on the tread pattern and normal layout of this style of accommodation.  As he rounded the corner, he called out, “Is this house compensation for something brother m-”
"... come here to make love?" Holmes asked with a drawn smile, completing for him the rest of the sentence, pretending to act nonchalant, but feeling a hint of bitterness in his heart "Well, this is not exactly true, don’t you think? I find it not all that different from Baker Street, with the only differences that this is not the house we live in. Yet, we share the same bed here "
“I cannot accept money from you, Mr Landsbury. You are just a mean person. Do you think I have forgotten the torments you inflicted on your uncle?”
Last but not least,
hear the joyous and amused laugh of the lover who clung to him.
"My God, " I couldn't help but whisper. I was running against time and God only knows if I had run out already. Robert was sent for Inspector Stanley. Accompanied by the cook and Mary-Ann, we rushed out into the park, white with snow.
Landsbury The colonel got up like a madman and ran into his office. Fearing some misfortune, I followed him. But Landsbury only wanted to find Ms Nordon's references. He began frantically rummaging through the files neatly stored in his desk drawers. He threw them on the floor, reminding me of Holmes in his relentlessness to find the information hidden in his documents. Soon the room looked like the Stock Exchange after a session, with the floor littered with papers. The colonel sat down in a large padded armchair, overwhelmed.
Thanks to everyone who left kudos & comments.
And yet, it was them: Sherlock Holmes and John Watson in Baker Street. Sure, Sherlock cheated because he had observed the police officer outside, but he was a gambler and a showman, and he knew his role and played his part.
“Just like Mrs Hudson and I are friends of yours, so we like to have a warning. Should I treat our ever-patient landlady to a nice cream tea somewhere posh? Mycroft gets the bill, naturally.”
As we entered the parlour and shut the door, Cartridge said: “Watson, I’ve been worried about you. I didn’t even know if I would find you here.”
around a fruit lorry, which had unexpectedly back out of a side street.
Our rooms were now boiling and since I was forbidden to be near the window, I lunched over my books, dropping crumbs in the creases of Grey’s Anatomy and feeling restless.
“You awake…?”
"The colonel still has a bad temper. I will not like to anger…"
She looked at him as if surprised to see that he was still there as if they had not been sitting five feet apart for two-and-a-half hours.
John Watson was no Sherlock Holmes. He remained, as Sherlock had put it so nicely once, an idiot. Yet, he had never received insults like Anderson or Donovan or Wilkes or all of John’s ex-girlfriends.
John had been battling with his sexuality since he hit puberty. What he desired was forbidden, or so he had made himself believe. The aftermath of the war had put a strain on his libido. Some nights, self-love had been literally self-abuse.
to take him, face-to-face, for the first time.
While we were wandering through the empty streets of London, Holmes conversed out of the blue about the hypocrisy of Christmas: "They claim that it‘s all about love and forgiveness, and yet? For one day and one day only, the upper-class care that the poor get a meal in their belly, and the day after? They don
Our client crashed his fist on the table. His drink was in danger of spilling.
I’ve suggested to Dr Watson that he should pick a new hobby, but he chose Scarlet.
"That’s why I came straight to Baker Street. Will you help us?"
HOLMES: Have you any suggestion to make?
My partner reached over in his enthusiasm, grabbed me by the shoulders, and kissed me.
“Sorry, old boy, I did not want to say... I did not mean what I said. You know that I not only come here for that reason, don’t you?”
“He would have liked it, John, wouldn’t he? God, he would hate it.”
John’s eyes scan the wall around the picture. It’s some flower. If John was asked, he would probably guess that it’s a rose. Hell, what does he know! Sherlock would say something poetic about it. Like the rose is something extra. That the world doesn’t need the flowers as we cannot eat them, and yet, they’re beautiful. Or, he would insist that one shouldn’t forget the bees. Sherlock loves bees, as they are fascinating creatures, or so he says. John simply would listen to him and insist that he, Sherlock Holmes, is a fascinating creature, too.
“Don’t wait for me. I’m going to have to tell Jessie as soon as possible. She’s going to be excited.”
“I told him, obviously.” Scarlet’s reply sounded not unlike Sherlock 101 towards police stupidity. “Sherlock asked me to give him a hint. Mycroft and I were against it. The plan was perfect, but Moriarty was correct on this account: Sherlock Holmes has a heart. He should have burned it.”
"Sadly, no. But the gentlemen from London have arrived. These are Mr Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson."
WATSON Certainly — but why not there, in 221b?
“I’ll show you,'' Holmes says to the boy.
Sherlock does the only thing he can think of:
WATSON’S
Tired of running up against that wall of arrogance, Holmes stood up and bade me follow him. “Well, Mr Arbucklehurt, we will not waste your time any longer. I wish you a good day. Come along, Watson.
Holmes walked over to Mr Arbucklehurt’s desk. He put both hands on the back of an armchair. “Three wills? This is amazing.
It's almost ten when the bell of 221c rings. John is cranky. He wants to utter "piss off," when he spots the takeaway box on his doormat.
Suddenly, on the left side, on a small forest path, a black carriage came out of the woods. It was at full speed, its horses racing.
WATSON (
“Mrs Hudson, I’m back from the concert!” He cannot stop himself: he kisses her on her cheek. There might be even a little twirl involved.
“Yes, I told him the love story, John. It was bittersweet because Jones knew that, unlike the first tale, there was no possibility for his father to come back. He knew he was alive, but would not see him again. To search for him—and considering their age, the chances are slim anyway—would endanger their freedom. I will not lie: for a moment, he wished for an alternative, that he was a victim and not a criminal in the eyes of the law, but he is an adventurer, also in the end, it was love that motivated him all the years to search for him. This was why I was almost certain that he would choose the truth. He continues his quest out of love, so he could face the truth; after all, he is his father’s son.”
high on the cliffs.
Oh, yes, love had found Sherrington Hall. Or maybe it had been the other round? Who cared?
It is not a dark and stormy night. It should have been,
A short exclamation and some rustling in the kitchen brought me back. I rushed to the room, only to stop dead: Holmes was fighting with what I suspect to be a picnic blanket. There was a basket as well, full of sandwiches, a bottle of wine, some fruits and some baked goods. What were the odds?
Suddenly, the fog in my brain cleared away to a horrific clarity. My pulse picked up. Could it be that I cracked it? That I, unassuming John Watson, have solved it all? Instantly, I went into action. It was almost as if I could hear my dear Holmes famous line, ‘The Game is Afoot’.
I wished I had come up with the line, "You smell like sex... with humans." "That is maybe because I like fucking them", but nope, all theirs.
Up there, I finally released a full breath. Arriving here, in Sherrington, had solved nothing. The melancholy overwhelmed me once more. I missed Holmes and his violin, or his sudden wish to stroll through the park, our arms linked.
"There was a nephew, but they haven't spoken to each other for a long time. Mary! Do you know what became of the colonel's nephew? "
Just like John’s, as his heart wants to beat once more. John wants to listen to Sherlock's play forever. So he has to stay alive.
Soon Holmes stripped off his clothes and put them on the unfortunately unrecognizable corpse. Finally, he approached me: “The second carriage is stopped right next to our pram. It can no longer ride, but the horses are virtually unharmed. There is Robert's corpse near the car.”
Stamford is a jovial man, always smiling and grinning. He got fat with age, as he says about himself, as married life suits him well. Soon, he will welcome his first grandchild.
WATSON: Like a torch?
This assumption carefully crafted by myself was incorrect on two counts. The first was rather obvious, as Holmes himself had said prominently once that he would be lost without his Boswell. We shared everything as we had done for decades on 221b Baker Street. Our partnership was a fixed point in a changing age, and while the world was on fire, we two remained; however, and this was the second wrong assumption: Holmes and I lived not in Sussex but in a lovely seaside town called Sherrington in Dorset.
“I have discovered the secret of life.”
It is a tough life in the year 1230, but it is what it is.
Holmes read an article circled in red and his eyebrows rose in amazement.
“Machiavellian! He hoped that young Mrs Nordon pushed to the limit, did something desperate.”
WATSON: The journal of Doctor John H. Watson: general medical practitioner, humble servant of Her Majesty’s armed forces, co-inventor of the Vigour Horse-Action
“Yes, that’s something different. It’s a natural and very common reaction, sir. The music is already setting the mood, the sudden darkness, and don’t forget the cross.”
While we prepared for the Christmas festivities—and Holmes even put on some mistletoe—unknown to us, the ever-loyal wife fulfilled the master plan of her murderous husband...
WATSON (
His laptop, even; was this his mug? What were the odds?

going fast enough actually to end his life.
"Perhaps you think you are scaring me, Mr Holmes?" asked the lawyer mockingly. "I have been handling the interests of the Landsbury family for a long time. I know the Colonel well. He is a friend."
Once arrogant, he elaborated now:
.) Oh, that is too bad. What did you lose?
Daylight welcomed us. A fine rain had settled in. We found ourselves in the back garden of the house. While I pitied the poor state of the property that used to be my childhood home all those decades ago, I made the mistake to let Holmes out of my sight. Hearing a crash and the silent cursing of my companion, I rushed to find him. I discovered him in a hole, holding his ankle. It took me far too long to help him out of it.
, sir. "
There is a rush of excitement when a case is closed. Even today my Holmes cannot stop to amaze me, and yet, he admitted it to me: some things are irrational and cherished for it. Our love is the best example: it simply is.
I wanted to say, "look in the mirror, my love, what do you see?" And I sensed the reply, his, not mine - which would have been:
Mrs Hudson is pleased when he blurts it out half an hour later: “Oh, Sherlock.” She wipes away some imaginary tears. “I’ll bake a cake! That’s something to celebrate.”
[Stage whisper: Who will experiment on that sex toy with my doctor in our bedchambers soon --- for science, of course? When the curator is gone, I will write a telegram to my brother Mycroft immediately after that someone from the Diogenes club bids anonymously for us. The Game is Afoot!]
"Obvious." Sherlock Holmes snorts. "The shoulder wound is easy - the way you hold yourself, your actions, the favouring of your left side. As for your limp, you forget it when distracted. You're not accustomed to being lame, so it's a recent injury. If it had occurred at home, you would never have left. If it had been from the labour, you would have been given other duties, you wouldn't be travelling. So, wounded by misadventure. Hunting? No, unlikely. You don't have the stature for it. My brother has it. You're both nothing alike. So, in battle or an altercation."
WATSON: I see. Well, yes, maybe I was a little hasty there. After all, this one seems to be for a female and we are both males. I know the sex toy we use as well as the one doctors can prescribe the fairer sex in need. A vibrator it is called. Great success for treating hysteria. However, my knowledge from three continents makes me hardly a professional. I might even mention that you came virginal to my bed and... Do not scoff, Holmes. I just am pointing out the facts. You always say that it is vital to have all facts at hand beforehand. Therefore, let us revise the circumstances. Therefore, while we were out, we had a visitor who did not leave a calling card but left behind a mysterious thin length of ivory with a curious curve at the end.
“I AM THE CEO OF A WORLD-LEADING COMPANY, MR HOLMES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’RE ACCUSING ME OF?”
“Why didn't they kill her right away?” I asked.
"Maybe…"
“Yes, Watson, exactly! But the thief was never found.” My Holmes was looking so proud; I had caught something important, hadn’t I? It was quite intoxicating. I could not get another kiss as a reward, but it was a rush of adrenalin no less.
No, all John Watson needed was a miracle, but as he was no idiot, he knew he would not get another one.
And with an energetic step, Mr Landsbury left the inn. Mrs Nordon had relapsed into her apathy, and I wondered what Holmes was doing once more.
Miss Parker had changed and was now wearing a light green dress. She had changed and was now wearing a light green dress. Her hair was pulled up into an elegant bun. A thin golden pendant shone on her chest. She was charming. One might even call her pretty. Her pregnancy was not yet visible.
“A war?” John asked and Sherlock shook his head.
“Right. Three. Two-”
“Their own fault.  You see, John, they had a prime example of a reformed Fallen right here.”  Moriarty pointed to Sherlock as if he was a prize on a game-show.  Sherlock, for his part, felt sick.
He sank into the chair.  Waited for the third.  And the fourth.  And the sixth.  And the ninth.  Eleven results.
“Better?” John asked.
“Hnnnnnnnnn.”
He’d sent them out to track down Raz the night of the Fall.
“I will try to, I promise.”
Sherlock picked the thread of the blanket around his knees.  “You didn’t know me back then.  I was not what one would call a model citizen.”
“Not giving up.
“You’d never get anywhere if I wasn’t.”
“You can’t be serious,” he stated as Lestrade walked into the office, coffee in hand.
“Course I will,” John said, and there was a large part of him that truly believed he would.  There was a small part however, deep down, that wondered.
“If we solve the case, we find John.  It’s clearly all linked together.  Whoever’s behind it knew I was getting close and wanted to distract me from the case.”
“You are such a Drama Queen.  But fine, come help me with this.”  With the two of them working together it took less time than John had anticipated which felt like both a relief and a disappointment.
.  That’s a bit not good.”
“While you two are arguing over your stupid bet, let me through.  Obviously neither of you are going to be of any help.  Come on John.”
John sighed and followed, equally as slow, keeping one eye on the stairwell.  Sherlock gasped slightly and John swivelled, mind already flicking through possible life-threatening scenarios.  He then gasped as well.
“I have a project, I need to get done and I was going to do it last week but I was stressed out and busy and I know this is really short notice but would you be free to please help me out this afternoon?”  John’s normally calm even tone had descended into a garbled chaos as he panicked.  After their initial shoot they’d hung out a few times, usually with Sherlock telling John about the more daring cases he’d been on, and John retelling stories of mischief from his childhood.  It was strange at first, having someone who actually listened and cared, but now Sherlock couldn’t imagine life without him, even branching out into talking about other aspects of his life which he was sure were dull as hell but which John seemed to enjoy.  This was a terrifying realisation but one he’d been good at suppressing so far.
Lestrade either didn’t hear or didn’t care as he led them towards the far side of the alley, where a small group of people were gathered around the edges of something.
“Sherlock is that-?”
Oh.  Not where he thought the conversation was going.  Spies sounded familiar.  In fact, didn’t John say he liked spies last week, liked the drama of them? (Any idea of how they’d got onto that topic escaped Sherlock- weekend plans maybe?  A film marathon?).  But wait did that mean-
“John,” Sherlock huffed, trying his best to squirm against John’s hand but found it impossible.  He didn’t even notice John’s grin which was quickly hidden as he mouthed the crease at the top of Sherlock’s leg, too lost in the heat rushing through his body.  Sherlock groaned, hands twisting the sheets beneath him.  If he could just shift his hips slightly more to the left-
made him stop.  He held very still, as if debating something, before turning back.
His eyes flickered forward to the other chair.  He had been tempted to move it into his room but the idea of touching anything in the flat was abhorrent.  Everything was in exactly the same place as he had left it that morning and that’s how it would remain.
John leaned facing the bar, whereas Sherlock faced out to the crowd.  John tried to catch the eye of the staff but they were busy at the other end of the bar so he settled in for the long haul.  “Right.  So what we thinking about this?  Bomb threat?”
It was this certainty that made him finally move from his hiding spot.  The dramatic reveal was worth it to see John’s double take and jaw drop, and he preened slightly under the attention, making sure his quick movements made his coat flair out behind him.  His smirk must have given away John’s obvious appreciation as he shook himself and grinned sheepishly in response.
John looked up at the approaching footsteps and smiled when he saw him which was a good sign.  Maybe.  More data needed.
And there was Sherlock.  Which was a whole other thing entirely.
jealous of the dog.  The sign off was what tipped him over the edge.  Not from the company or a generic greeting but something that showed he genuinely cared.  Sherlock for once agreed with Mrs Hudson.  He had to meet his dog walker.
“You brought him up!”
As Sherlock had taken off almost immediately, John was a few steps behind the entire run back.  This gave him the incredibly perfect view of Sherlock’s arse, and this was when he knew he was in trouble.  Almost as soon as they were through the door Sherlock had turned, they had pulled each other in and were kissing passionately.  Sherlock used his taller frame to back John up against the door and if John hadn’t pulled back to state “Bed. Now,” it is likely the two would have been caught having sex in the hallway.
The sound of a mug hitting a coaster dragged him from his phone.
“Molly!  Just the person we need,” Sherlock said, flashing a smile.
“Correct,” he conceded.
about being excited.  Do you know how rare this is?”
“Yes,” he whispered back.
“Well that was-”
The owner of the room was getting sloppy, as it didn’t take him long to pick the lock and use his powers to dismantle the hidden protections.  If only he was around to gloat at.  It was
“Still getting out of trouble I see,” Raz said, looking disdainfully at Sherlock.  “The fuck are you dressed as?”
He was attempting to wrestle his mat onto the top of the pile when a voice he had become very familiar with over the past half hour spoke just behind him.
“It’s fine, really.  I hope you made it to your photography class on time,” Sherlock said.
He sighed.  “By using it as a bargaining chip.  I could probably get them to grant you asylum,
Also I swear this was not supposed to be this long- I couldn't seem to make the boys stop chatting. Next time: a date!  An actual date!  Cue boys hyperventilating, the longest Saturday known to man, Angelo's, and after Angelo's...
He wondered about Sherlock’s reach.  Were the entire staff at Bart’s beholden to the Fallen angel?  Was it a building-wide secret?  There had to be some sort of system in place, surely, otherwise everyone would know.  Or did Sherlock only lurk about when no one else was there, Bart’s very own ghost.
“How’re you coping with it?”
“The best I can hope for next to you,” John said, once again distracted by looking over Sherlock’s body.  Up until he’d taken this case Sherlock hadn’t thought about it much.  It was transport, a way of getting from A to B, but not something to be appreciated on its own.  He wasn’t sure what the etiquette was in this situation, so he just stood there watching John watch him until John shook himself again and nodded towards the doors.  “Shall we?”
Sherlock rose to his full height and sighed again.  “Once again you miss the obvious Sally.  One you had the frankly idiotic thought that I was going to simply tell you, just so you can make irrelevant and inaccurate assumption about me based on an alarmingly insignificant amount of data.  Two, you would have realised that I wasn’t a Beta merely by my smell if you had bothered to notice,” he shoved his wrist under her nose, allowing her to take a cautious sniff before snapping it away again and shucking his coat sleeve down.  “Odourless, suggesting a distinctive scent, not found in Betas.  Three, you would have realised that these eyes don’t belong to this body at all.  I suggest you visit the morgue Detective Inspector,” he directed towards a shocked looking Lestrade who had just appeared in the doorway.  Sherlock began to stride out the room but before he made it out the door he spun back to look at Sally.  “Also please tell your friends at the Yard to either become subtle in their appalling attempts at extracting information so I can ignore them or better yet, to cease entirely in this pointless endeavour.”  With that he marched out the room and hadn’t said another word on the matter.
"Sherlock do you know- oh my god!"  A tall boy with scruffy bleach blonde hair had fallen through the door and was currently looking proud rather than mortified.  Irene stood close behind him and was still smirking.
As he looked were bid, John saw what the others had.  It was less noticeable in the crowd of other marks and with the glare street and shop lights, but sure enough, there was a small, bright yellow symbol on the wall.  It was further along than where the original symbol had been.
“No,” Sherlock said, his shoulders dropping.  He felt drained.
“No,” Sherlock said slowly, drawing out the o.  John hated this stupid guessing game charade they had to go through but it made Sherlock happy to show off he was the cleverest in the room.  Or driveway.
It wasn’t even that unusual, especially in London where many people worked odd hours and it wasn’t even every day.  Finding a walker was surprisingly simple, even though Sherlock made sure the agency knew just how last minute he may have to ring in.  Apparently there was someone who was ‘just perfect’ for that kind of work, all he needed to do was text and everything would be taken care of.  Sherlock couldn’t help but feel sceptical but that may have just been the thought of leaving Gladstone with a stranger.  However when the call came through about a new case, he didn’t have time to waste interrogating dog walkers and so threw the lead at Mrs Hudson, fired off a text and then tried not to worry about his beloved pet.
“You expect me to join you after you do this?” Sherlock asked.
“No.  But John is,” he answered quickly.  Then, brain catching up with his speech, he added “He’s a lot easier to live with when he’s happier.  Less slamming of doors and noisy tea making.”
“Clever,” Sherlock whispered.  John shot him a look.
“John, I need you to remember everything you saw.”  Sherlock’s voice was low and soft and so very, very close.
“Oh for-” John titled his face up, while dragging Sherlock’s head down to push their lips together.  For all the movement was demanding, his lips were soft and gentle, allowing him to move if he wanted to.  He froze for half a second, surprised, and then pressed back hesitantly.  He was hyper aware of every sensation, the sound of their breath and lips sliding, the flutter of eyelashes and press of noses, chastely holding hands but clinging on to each tightly.  Then John titled his head slightly, deepening the kiss.  Sherlock gasped and the whined as John pulled away first.  “I loved you then, I think, looking back on it,” he said.  “But I know I love you now, definitely.”
“I will once again remind you that I am a low-level Council employee who may use resources with the utmost discretion.  It does not grant me the ability to be omnipotent,” he said, picking imaginary lint off his jacket.
He nodded to the seat across from him.
“You assume correct,” Mycroft paused over his reply, his mouth open as if he was going to continue.  His brother rarely hesitated so obviously and it immediately put Sherlock back onto a knife edge. This was what he had been waiting for. The confirmation that all was not well at 221, that something had gone wrong, that he’d missed something, that he would have to leave again and not return.
“Sounds great.  Oh and if you’re looking for something other to do than being chased down alleyways, there’s a party on Saturday, supposedly
"So I was right?"
What make you say that?”
“Me and Harry don’t get on, never have really, and I am the youngest.” Sherlock smiled at the confirmation of his guess.  “But Harry is short for Harriet.”
“Got lost?” John asked as Sherlock continued to peer at the tiny building marker that denoted where the Guard Officers were.
“I don’t feel obligated to.  My
Lestrade didn’t meet his eye and instead addressed Sherlock’s left ear.  “Certain individuals.”
Lestrade was staring determinedly out of the window.  He had been staring determinedly out of the window for five minutes now.  He knew this because when he was not looking out the window, he was staring at the clock in his car, wiling time to go faster or for there to be a bank robbery, or for their suspect to leap out and attack them or
"Ever!"
“We need your help.  But, once you know this information, you can’t un-know it and it could put you in danger.  You okay with those odds?” Lestrade asked.
Sherlock had stopped and appeared to be consulting the map of the surrounding area posted near the stairs.  This was odd on many accounts, mainly because Sherlock often boasted of having an encyclopaedic knowledge of the city, and many places beyond.  It was a skill he had enchanted John with one cloudy afternoon when neither of them had anything better to be doing than wandering around, diving through side streets and back-roads, all with Sherlock pointing out oddities, like a deranged tour guide.  “Arson destroyed this building two decades ago, you can tell by the panelling.  There was a hidden library down those steps, shame the woman moved on but it was getting too popular.  You can get to Paddington from here without seeing a single door.  Best Vietnamese take-away in the city.”  (John could verify this last point.  It was pretty amazing.)
The receptionist coughed politely.  “Um, I’m afraid John isn’t scheduled to work today and there’s no record of him covering another shift.”
“I really want to kiss you,” John said, and looked as startled as Sherlock felt at the confession.  Clearly, he didn’t mean to say it out loud, but Sherlock wanted to reassure him he didn’t mind.  It was then he noticed they had both leaned in while Sherlock was making his deductions and he was actually within kissing distance.  His heart beat picked up and John was licking his lips in a way that was entirely too distracting and-
The woman didn’t look up from her nails as he approached.
John resisted the urge to sigh.  “I’d forgotten about your lack of culture.  It’s a kids book.  About a multi-coloured elephant.”
John sobered slightly.  “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“Please,” he said, eyes locked onto John’s.
“You were out of it for a bit, didn’t think it was safe to let you hit into lampposts.”
“Well he’s always been a bit of a vigilante type has Jake.  Thinks he’s bloody Robin Hood,” Oli said, sounding bitter.  Sherlock glanced up.  Bitter about being left out rather than being shocked at crime element.  He’d have to tell Victor to get better friends.  He went back to his list.  Not many noticeable names but a few would certainly be big news.  His eyes hit the last name.
“All right Sherlock and what brought you to that assumption?” he said, wondering what had given Sherlock that idea.
John swung round instinctively at the sound of his name so Victor couldn’t see his expression as he stared at the child-like Sherlock, long coat partially covering the jumper he swore he would never wear and his jeans from yesterday thrown on in a rush, hair rumpled and a face that bore the signs of a mild hangover.
He still felt flat, battling against the thing struggling in his stomach, rising into his chest.  However once sparked, it was not easy to contain.
“I believe you were just repeating the word John over and over again.  Flattering but you can see why I wasn’t enthralled.”
Living with Sherlock Holmes was...strange.
And so here we are.  The final curtain.
Sherlock smiled.  “It came in lime green as well.”
“Okay, I’ll talk it through.  I’m looking for a guy’s missing right arm.  Next thing I know a Fallen’s wandering around with a singular arm that’s not his own.  I know I’m not the greatest detective,” (here he ignored the Fallen’s scoffed “Obviously”), “but I don’t think this is looking great for you.”
) but it was the tiniest hint of relief he noticed, in the slight fall of John’s shoulders, in the way he slumped ever so slightly after hearing Sherlock’s voice, that’s what kept Sherlock speaking.
So now here they were.  Stood across the walking aisle, arguing over furniture, neither willing to yield to the other.
Sherlock was quiet and looked serious and John was just about to tell him to forget all about it and run for his own door when Sherlock replied.
“I think that’s his way of saying Thank You,” John said fondly.
“According to you, one of them may be a kidnapper with a homicidal streak.  John would kill me if something happened to you.”  The last sentence made something in Sherlock flutter.  Not-John remained oddly silent in his peripheral vision.
“You understand why I’m worried?” Lestrade asked Sherlock.
Sherlock would have argued that John would have to look at his own shorts before commenting on anyone else’s, but he didn’t want to derail the conversation just yet.  He chose to explain his career.  “When the police are out of their depth, which is constantly, then they call me.”
Of course it was the magazine that did it.
“Me and Victor?” Sherlock asked incredulously.
Tall was John’s first impression.  The figure was stood, straight-backed, unflinching, which made him seem towering.  That and the ridiculous coat, a woollen, flowing, swishy coat.  His next impression was the phrase “Tall, Dark, and Handsome,” only for a moment before he remembered he was a professional on a job and he should not be checking out a shadowy stranger in an alleyway while he was trying to scare off some stupid kids.
“You may be the maddest person I have ever met.”
“Sherlock what do you want?  I do actually have a job you know.”
) or this was all true.  Including the disappointment.
Most saints were arseholes.  Turns out naming a building after someone makes them even more unbearable than their canonisation.
“Then why not just say that?  Over-talking can be a sign of guilt you see, the conscience tying itself up in knots trying not to get caught and to wrestle the bad feeling down so it doesn’t leak into your voice.  Maybe you did it yourself.  Seems plausible, you knew the victim, you said he was quiet, knew he didn’t have many friends, and who knows, the system makes mistakes sometimes, maybe a psychopath go through, maybe this is all a front and you have body parts under the floorboards, is that it?”  He’d advanced on the poor woman as he began his tirade, blocking her in.  She had gone from protesting to wordlessly mouthing, clearly terrified.
“Don’t you have your kid half the time?”
“Knew that anyway.  Number plate.”
.  His breathing became erratic, each one escaping with a whine or a gasp, and the feeling in his stomach grew tighter, and tighter, and tighter.  His toes scrunched in the carpet and hands fisted in the sheets as he tried to keep control, but it felt like he was being wound up and up, his stomach clenching and then-
“Thanks Greg,” John said, yawning.
Sherlock, while being annoyed at most of the human population for existing, adored dogs to the point that he would walk the long way back from campus simply to say hey to the dog that sat by the gate from 5-6pm every day.  Also Irene had found doesthedogdie.com bookmarked on his phone, despite his insistence that all films were stupid.
A floor below, Sherlock unclenched his hands from the sheets, rolled over, and tried to do exactly the same.
Sherlock had interacted with humans before, knew about their habits and needs
Hello again.  I don't know what to say other than these past few weeks have been crazy, plus I kind of lost my inspiration for a bit so that's why it's taken so long for this to be written.  It will be finished though, I swear! I feel a lot more like writing now so hopefully the next chapter won't be too long behind this one.  I'm aiming to finish it before I start Uni in late September so fingers crossed! Hope you like this chapter and please if there's any mistakes or constructive criticisms please tell me! They help so much.
the tie.
“If you’re giving out compliments you must be fucking desperate.”
“You think he’s faked it?”  Sherlock shrugged.  “But why still drive a taxi?  Doesn’t seem to be dreaming very big.”
“So why ask for mine?”
Before either Irene or Victor could retort there was the sound of movement on the stairs.
The angel’s head shot up at the sound, startled at the sudden noise.  His mouth fell open slightly, mirroring Sherlock’s own surprise.  They stayed locked in their positions.  Sherlock couldn’t force himself to move, or blink, or breathe.  All he could do was look.  Look and wait and hope, hope ferociously that he wasn’t dreaming, that this was real and John was here and it wasn’t a dream, it wasn’t...
No, he was here for a case.  Now all he had to do was act like it.
“Yeah, I’m just-I’m just going to go.  I hope you have a nice night,” he attempted to keep his voice steady.  Judging by Kate’s expression he wasn’t doing so well on that front.
Suddenly he did not feel in such a good humour.
This however, was a progression on his old way of life.  Something new though, was the acquisition of a
“I tell you things all the time!” John protested.
“Thought you’d solved the case and handed it over?”  Sherlock resolved to never share anything with Molly ever again.
Sherlock shrugged.  “You know how picky they can be about these things,” he said, picking the fluff off his dressing gown.
Sherlock had many answers to that question and yet none felt appropriate to say at that moment in time.
“Why are
Raz ambled over to sprawl on the sofa.  He reached into his pocket and produced a piece of paper, scruffily folded into four.  “I think the question is, what do I get for it?”
“Sorry about that.  He can be a bit, well,
That and his perceptiveness left nothing private.
“Hang on.  That rings a bell,” Lestrade muttered and there was a pause and clicking noises as he searched. “Fuck, that means you’re all the way near South Croydon. Right, give me a minute.  You sure you can hang tight for 30 minutes?  40 tops.”
He made a half-hearted attempt at a shrug.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“It’s a possibility,” Sherlock said, looking serious too, but with an edge of excitement which was missing from John and Lestrade.
“They choose victims from the tube lines.  Scope them out somehow, know their routes, then land close enough to follow?” Lestrade said, nodding as he worked through it.
“Have you been upstairs today?” he volleyed back.
Mycroft sighed one of his ‘why do I have to deal with this?’ sighs.  “It’s only for one evening.  I’m sure even you can manage that, and London isn’t simply going to implode without your presence.”
“You said they knew you were close.”
Sherlock stopped and stared at him.  It was clear someone had told but which one?
“What do you think you’re doing?”
It wasn’t that John couldn’t see some benefits to the human life.
The taxi pulled up outside a posh office building, its exterior mainly glass reflecting the image of the opposing skyscraper.  John felt acutely aware of just how scruffy he looked as several heads turned towards the two teens.  He followed behind Sherlock as they strode through the standard, modern reception, past the curved lines of the front desk and glass coffee tables and straight towards the elevators.
John Watson was missing.
“Look, you might have given up, but I haven’t so you’re going to have to put some effort in.”
knew what his voice did to him and he really did not want to have this moment publically on show.
The advice added an extra edge to an already stressful day because today was the day John had decided to bite the bullet and ask Sherlock out.  Casually.  In a totally non pressured environment.  In fact, maybe he would just feel out if Sherlock was interested in dating.  At all.  With anyone.  Specifically blondes who happened to like photography and lived across the hall from him.  Just you know, hypothetically speaking.
He was going for coffee with his gorgeous neighbour and was going to explain his project to him.  This was fine.  He could do this.  So long as he remembered how to breathe.
“Sherlock, I am so sorry.”
“I felt that was implied,” Sherlock said, turning his head to hide his own smile.
“I shouldn’t have started teaching you to observe,” Sherlock muttered.
“John?”
“Greg, one, that’s really weird.  Two, your manslaughtering drug dealer just tried to attack Sherlock.  Maybe we want to prioritise slightly.”
“Maybe you shouldn’t leave your stuff around to be taken,” Sherlock shot back.
“I told you, you can’t keep on sneaking round here.  My boss is getting suspicious,” she said with a sigh but John couldn’t help notice she hadn’t said they couldn’t use the room.  Living with Sherlock had made him a quick master of the technicality.
This chapter is about 5700 words so is the longest chapter I think? As ever, kudos and comments are gold dust, but even just reading it warms my writers heart.  Enjoy!
John wasn’t convinced but he also didn’t want to be fired and lose his only means of income.  “Look, just let Lestrade know what you’re doing.”
, the heading declared boldly and underneath were photos of a range of students all collaged together, like a more realistic version of a university brochure.  He recognised a few of them, but that wasn’t what made him stop.  His face was front and centre, his photo one of the larger ones in the piece.  He’d expected John to use one of the more serious takes, but instead, his lips were curled up in a rare, genuine smile, eyes crinkled at the sides with laugh lines.  Was he really
After fighting their way to the bar and subsequently fighting their way out, they went to go sit down.  Each chair had a little place name and Sherlock both hoped he would be sat next to John so he could avoid the tedious conversations that were bound to happen, and hoping John was as far away as possible, so he wasn't inclined to be
He scoffed, leaning his head against the window.  “Molly, your own romantic entanglements appear to be clouding your judgement.”
John was stood outside the restaurant, glancing up and down the road, not expecting Sherlock to appear out of the side street opposite.  He had to pause before crossing, hidden in shadows, just to calm himself.  John looked handsome, but Sherlock could have told you that without looking at him; John would look handsome in a bin bag.  Luckily, he’d chosen actual clothes for this date and was wearing a navy button down (good call on the purple, wouldn’t want to be identical) under a well-worn bomber jacket and jeans that sent Sherlock’s thought to the positively
Her shoulders dropped.  “He hasn’t turned up then?”  Sherlock shook his head.  He tried not to think of the hours that had passed since his disappearance, tried not to think of statistics and likelihoods of injury and worse, tried and tried, but when had his brain ever listened to him?  Everything just took too much
He’d walked a few steps into the hallway before he realised Greg was not with him.  He turned around to see him in the doorway, with a concerned look on his face.  “Has anyone ever told you you’re a strange man Watson?”
“I can’t ask that of you,” John said, shaking his head.
Sherlock- was slumped against a person who could only be Victor
“Is he...broken?” Lestrade asked.
, this is also an important discussion, is it not?”
“Hi,” John said, stretching out the vowel.  Lestrade’s sigh made him wince.
He sighed and trailed a hand down his chest, kneading it with the palm of his hand.  At the contact he whimpered involuntarily, the sound dragging itself out of his throat.  Part of him wanted to stay in bed, to flip over and rut against the sheets, to continue the fantasy, but the thought of anyone (*cough, nosy landladies bringing tea upstairs cough*) overhearing was too embarrassing.
Instead of replying Sherlock leant in for a chaste kiss.  John tried to follow him as he pulled away but Sherlock kept only their foreheads in contact so he could add “I missed you too, you romantic idiot.”
John paused.  “So, no worrying about the creepy guy phoning me about you?”
“It might not be him,” he said, still staring at his palm.
“Wouldn’t be the first time I skipped, plus it’s for a good cause,” Sherlock said, following John’s lead.
“You think Mike can help?” he asked. They still hadn’t gone out for that catch-up, despite texting a little and although John wouldn’t say he was avoiding Mike, he was almost definitely avoiding him.  He supposed he could point to his flatmate and shrug in a ‘Well you know living with him is a full-time job’ way.
Lestrade nodded back.  Looked over to Sherlock.  Looked back.  Narrowed his eyes.  “You’re not sleeping with him are you?”
help?”  Sherlock then took a sip of coffee as if he hadn’t just boxed John into a corner.
“So curious you decided to put money on it.  How tasteful of you,” was the muttered reply.
“Hey,” Sherlock said, pressing a small kiss to John’s lips and forehead.  He suddenly felt exhausted.
Lestrade shrugged.  “If his souls registered, it should be fine.  Part of the reason the others can’t get down is because their souls don’t match their bodies.  Wait,” he turned to Sherlock scowling.  “How do we you’re actually Sherlock?”
The puzzle that had kept Victor occupied while he wandered around the freezing cold park was why.  Why had he disappeared?  He’d been acting a bit odd at yesterday’s party (well, what Victor could remember of the party anyway) and Sherlock had lost him for a while until he was spotted chatting to another group of people.  Between then and now Sherlock had somehow managed to lose his beloved and was now frantically running around with a search size the area of the entirety of London.  Now if you asked Victor, John had probably either a) gone out for something or b) was passed out on someone else’s floor but as a good friend here he was, wandering round a freezing park and-
"Literally. Or St Andrews." Sherlock was grinning, and I shouldn’t mirror him. Alas, I did. I switched to what I hope is a more professional voice.
): You have seen fit not only to reject my proposals but to make insulting references coupled with threats of arrest.
"Please leave Mrs Nordon alone," I cried, not liking his tone and regaining my combative mood. “She will let you know her to answer in a few days.”
One more time I witnessed the depth of loyalty and love which lay beyond that cold mask. Holmes' clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and I observed that his firm lips were shaking. And the cold wasn’t to blame alone. I always cherished whenever I glimpsed a great heart and a great brain, and yet, while I stood by the statement that it would be worth a wound, it still hurt a lot this time.
“Something like that. Has the bastard ever told you how he convinced us to let him work on
“I wouldn't have allowed myself, Inspector.”
“But you do...”
There is nothing more delicious than finally sodomizing the great detective to incoherence.
"Couldn't it be Adèle herself?"
His “Good evening” is more a question than a greeting, and it hits me almost as much as his broken voice. Where is his commanding air? His
His hand had found mine again, and with it, my fear vanished. With him so close, I could only see the adventure of wandering through a secret passage. Even if I had been lost, Holmes would always find me. He would me lead to the light, or more accurately, in this case, to the small library. Apparently, the tunnel led to the main house as well.
“To me, Mr Holmes?” Our client seemed surprised. Mockingly, he said, “If you like, but if a comment of mine has given you a lead, detective, I want my share of your salary!”
The tone was rising between us. I could not see how to calm down my companion, or how to change his mind. Holmes sometimes had those incomprehensible quirks that were difficult to counter. Silence fell again over the living room, now even deeper, more hostile. I paced back and forth in our living room, while Holmes pretended to dive back into his reading.
"Sir Robert Noberton is not an unknown name for us," I said, resuming the conversation sometime later.
From afar, I
There is some violin playing to end the night by Sherlock, which is more than some string-pulling.
“You know very well that Mrs Nordon will inherit nothing. The colonel certified to me he had disinherited her.”
Fuck, the wall is made of bricks.
“A strong drink is in order,” Watson says, still shaking his head.
"She deceived everyone and unacceptable."
A part of his mind knew that he should have been at his house, to celebrate Christmas with his wife, but the desire to see Holmes had been too strong, so that evening he had invented an urgent case and told Mary that he probably he would not be home until tomorrow morning.
In my youth, I would never admit such things. Neither how much it pleased me to be of service, nor to comment on his attire. Or, I should clarify: not without altering it for the public.
The response is immediate: The sound is throaty, guttural, and utterly genuine.

My reply to him echoed my inner state: “No, I do
“I insist, Watson. There is no reason at all why risk your life.”
It happens by accident, as most things in life are not planned, not staged, not calculated, but real, and it works.
The driver smiled, but his eyes were hidden behind the black sunglasses once more, and John could not tell whether there was any humour in that smile.

"Everyone is a master to someone," he tells Watson. "As you are convinced that I am yours, I will be it."
We could not leave Sherrington without him visiting it at least once. It could have been risky but the cold January weather played in our favour: the locals had stayed indoors to not face the chilling wind. We, wrapped up as warm as possible in thick coats, hats and scarves, were enjoying the outing like adventure-seeking young men or newlyweds, and we were, weren’t we?
Naturally, our discussion turned to Afghanistan and India. We talked about the nightly fighting in the deep valleys, the natives that we could not see and who appeared like ghosts in the camps at night,… and always we returned to whether it had been right to invade their countries.

221b had been a comfort and a safe harbour when I returned from the Afghan campaign. Even most common folks would have laughed out loud by that admission, as Holmes was anything but a balm for distressed nerves. Yet, it proved correct what someone had once said about me: I had needed exactly that, a man who kept me on the toes, challenged me day in day out (and not only my patience), and who had given me purpose in life.

I could see that he was still suspicious. Yet my mind was in shambles.
“Doesn’t the bible say that love is the most important thing? Like, isn’t that the message of the New Testament? 'Faith, hope, and love, and the greatest of these is love', so how could love be a sin?

Sorry, sir, I’m not a regular churchgoer, but I live happily with this man who’s all for logic. You cannot have it both ways. Unless you don’t follow God’s word but a man’s interpretation of it. And frankly, what I remember from bible studies at school, years ago mind you but I doubt it's changed, is that God is a rather forgiving guy. Rainbow and all, which is from the Bible, Old Testament even. And his son dined with sinners and instructed his disciples to do the same, so well… love is kind.”
There was wonder on Sherlock’s face, the mouth shaped into a heart, and so much sentiment interwoven in his voice.
like home.
The old cook smiled, tenderly. "She sneaked up on me to get some. She wasn't allowed to eat sweets between meals. The colonel was quite strict."
"He is worthless, but he is a Landsbury. That's right, a Landsbury in Crevecoeur Hall..."
She was more than a landlady or a housekeeper, and she proved it again on that day as she switched over to a mother figure in a heartbeat. Instantly, she says, “I’ll bring some biscuits.” On her way through the door, she promised a cake, “but just this once, mind you, to celebrate.”
If Sister Mary knew what she wears proudly in Sunday Service… Oh, the irony! It makes the two lovers giggle like schoolboys.
I have booked an appointment with Ella already. It was, however, too late to prevent three missteps.
It was a few days after the third advent, and it seemed as if Christmas would be cancelled. I wanted to take courage and ask about the upcoming festivities, and most, unfortunately, it collided with Holmes' temper.
The cook had cried.
The detective did not expect such a gesture from the staid and rational doctor, who usually always maintained his self-control. Only once had he really seen him without brakes, but he had no desire to get him drunk again; he usually liked Watson much more, even if that had been a decidedly intense and revealing experience.
In her defence, she had said that she had woken up early because May itself had seemed to say, “Wake up! Get out of bed! Spring has sprung!”
When Holmes pulls his finger out to retrieve the salve again, Watson cries out of protest.
"Me too, Sherlock. And yet, everything else would be strange, wouldn’t it? Sherlock Holmes without a John Watson?"
“Please sit down and calm yourself, sir. Let Mr Arbucklehurt continue reading the will.
With growing surprise and suspicion, I saw Holmes start and maintain a conversation. He mentioned the surrounding countryside, so beautiful and peaceful compared to London, but also quiet and lacking real entertainment. Soon he caught the interest of Miss Parker. It didn’t take long, and the two were chatting like two friends about shopping, fashion, and the latest shows. The young woman seemed to
Sorry that the cliffhanger isn’t revealed yet, but I think/hope you can forgive me as a special day needed a special chapter.
Our landlady, Mrs Hudson, was already planning. Only yesterday she had turned us out of Baker Street for her annual house cleaning. All too willing, we had found refuge in the British Library. For hours, Holmes had been studying some Old English documents. Later we had visited a tearoom which might be queer but a secret delight for Holmes. There he could observe customers who differed significantly from those who frequented the pub, for instance. Last, they offered the most delicious muffins, and Holmes had encouraged me to indulge.
John Watson is Sherlock Holmes' North Star. (Post-TRF)
John had come back to London after being shot in the shoulder, and that he survived should have been a miracle enough, however, what good was surviving when one scarcely had means to live another week? His nerves were too shattered to guarantee a full night’s sleep. He had woken more often than not with the sound of gunfire ringing in his ears. Recently, he caught himself thinking about ending it all with his illegal service revolver. Apparently, posttraumatic stress disorder was far worse than all the warnings made it out to be.
It had been a good afternoon, which had John reminded of the days of their past. It had lulled him into some false sort of safety: stupid, foolish.
“Very well, Holmes, but...”
"Exactly, Sherlock. Can you tell me which poison it was too?"
Watson’s face burns, and he whimpers and rocks back against his fingers, desperate for more stimulation. However, he listens to the master’s orders: John Watson’s fingers stay away from his cock.
Any little thing that you have, that you want? No! Ah, I am sorry, that is all, Billy.
THE END
"She ate it in the evening too? With her herbal tea?"
And without answering, the young dandy left the study, slamming the door. The two servants looked at each other, worried by the turn of events. Only Mrs Nordon, still in shock, looked more dead than alive.
In our line of work, we have encountered many secrets, and some of them I revealed to the public. Depending on the client or the culprit, we have shared our knowledge with the police. We
comes to one’s mind, obviously. There, we let the criminal go because he did it out of love. Why would it here any difference? Because they were men? That would make me a hypocrite, as I love you as a lover and not just as a friend. The crime is only a crime by society’s standards. I hope that one day it will be no crime anymore. However, I do not think that we will be alive by the time that day arrives. Therefore, it is up to us to choose. “
In the end, we needed little. “Take what you need,” I said to him, “my love,” and my lover whimpered and thrust.
Watson and she had just settled down for breakfast. It is not even 8 o’clock yet.
I hated myself horribly for not predicting it, but could I have? I am not Sherlock Holmes.
Maybe I should compose something for him, Sherlock muses.
stuffing his clothes into a bag, he made a mental note to go on a shopping trip soon. They needed to stock up on lube and condoms. He grinned, a bit smugly, and tossed his trademark jumper in the washing bin.
the everyday life of modern London. Rush-hour was slowing down, but the stream of tourists was peaking, cabs looking for a fare and public transport running 24/7. A maelstrom of noises, the sound of home.

It’s half-past one on the dot when Sherlock Holmes eyes the left-over lasagne suspiciously, and John Watson inhales the same dish with gusto. The company by proxy makes Sherlock give the lunch a try, and he surprises himself that he finishes most on his plate.
HOLMES’S
There followed a pompous and uninteresting speech on the technical details of making the will, mortgages and guarantees...
“So many questions, my dear Watson! You will have the answers when you have Robert in front of you.
However, John is fed up with maybe and hopefully someday. He knows about forever in limbo, and it has to stop.
“Madam, you ask a lot. There can be no question of that." Mr Landsbury's gaze turned compassionate. He seemed genuinely sorry. "It's up to me to carry the title, madam. Society will never accept that a natural child inherits such an old and respected name as Landsbury. Understand me!”
Landsbury smirked and leaned the barrel of his rifle harder on my chest. Missed.
CURATOR: Sir, I need your help...
Welcome back to "it takes two (to make a thing go right)"!
John phrased it neutral. He is sure, though, something seemed to shine through because the irritation from the driver’s face softens into understanding and empathy.
“She's losing blood.”
“You forget his name, but not that Greg works for New Scotland Yard?”
"But what happens if Adèle Landsbury disappears?"
“You want to see this or not?
It cannot be undone that my mind is failing me.
Jones’ voice was raised at the end; his outburst did not go unnoticed by the surrounding people. There were some looks, so we hastened to rein each other in. He took a sip of his drink to settle his emotional state. As I took a breath to control my piqued curiosity.
Simultaneously a “You know him?” and “He’s disturbing my lab time!” like two kids trying to tell on the other first.
“It wasn’t my fault you know,” he said defiantly.
“Because life isn’t fair!”  The shout echoed around the empty station.  “You could be great Sherlock, but your loyalty to this place and these people is
“I told you!  I told you and you looked at me in that
“Ah, you’re the man that keeps snapping photos of this one.  Lord knows how you can work with him,” Victor said, dramatically sighing.  Sherlock rolled his eyes, equally as dramatic.
(It might have been because of the wink).
"Hi John," he said again.
Right.  Photo-shoot.  Sherlock just a friend.  He could do this.
He still had to sign some paperwork however so he strode over to the desk.  When in doubt, be overly confident and hope it intimidates people into not yelling at you.
“It’s about him isn’t it?”  Greg’s voice was carefully neutral but John could still hear the anger buried underneath.
“Not one of the angels remember?”
There was also the other problem.  Because there always was.
“How could you possibly know all that?” John asked, eyes narrowed and his expression neutral.  Dangerous, so dangerous, but the deductions were already there, in plain sight.
“Yeah, well you’re into all that experimental shit.”
He recoiled.
“Fuck, John,” was all Sherlock could say as he writhed under him, head tossing from side to side, unsure whether he wanted to press in or roll away.
he thought.  Apparently he wanted to see how far he could push his confessional luck.
“Sherlock you coming?”
“Sounds intense,” Sherlock laughed.
The door to the flat was already open, offering a full view of the sitting room. He tried to calm his wildly beating heart.
“Nothing.  Just, us against the rest of the world.  As always,” Sherlock said with a small grin.
“Okay, good.  Now why have you hid my phone?” John asked, moving to wrap his arms over Sherlock’s shoulders and locking at the back of his neck.  Trapped.
“Bit nicer than my flat,” John said from behind him.  In his haste to sequester John away in the flat away from prying eyes, he hadn’t realised his focus had left John trailing him.  He didn’t seem to mind though, looking around at what he could see in the shadows created by the streetlights.
Mike laughed a little.  “Well you have to admit it looks a little suspect.”
“Yes, hello.”  Now he was in Sherlock’s presence he had apparently forgotten how to talk.  Luckily Sherlock didn’t seem to be listening, already striding towards the door.
Their task was simple. Find a tube station. Check to see if there was a symbol near the tube station.   Send Sherlock the location.  If it seemed fresh, scan back through the footage until you found the person responsible for tagging the wall.  Clip and send to Sherlock.
“You can’t know that.  Not psychic remember?”
Sherlock had totally read those trashy mystery novels Victor kept buying.  This was uncovered after a night out when both boys could be found in the living room yelling about the plot point to X novel in the something or other series.  Neither girl could really remember but the point was hearing Sherlock yelling “But cats don’t just murder people without motive Victor!” was worth the hangover.
“Now care to explain why you were late on this fine morning?”
“Of course.  Don’t you?”
century maiden.  Normally Sherlock would be averse to any suggestion he couldn’t look after himself, but if it meant he could have more contact with John he was not above pretending to faint and having John carry him.  He did not know when he had lost his dignity but apparently it was long gone by this point.
“No.”
John bit his lip to stop himself laughing.  He ran his hands down so he was rubbing Sherlock’s arms so he could get a better look at his eyes.  “Sherlock Holmes, are you drunk?”
The receptionist nodded.  “He would need to use his key-card to get back here and sign-in, it would flag on our system.”
John replied tightly.  “We had literally 5 minutes to ourselves Mycroft and there were other concerns.”
However, before Sherlock could send a very inappropriate text explaining, in detail, why it was rude to kidnap one’s brother’s boyfriend, there was a creak from upstairs.  Grey eyes flickered upwards.  So hiding then.  He scowled.  What purpose could John have in hiding?
“I need to speak to Jake.  Now.”
“Okay, so, ex-army Captain and doctor, used to play rugby at some point, probably would have pursued it further but the military got in the way.  Shot in the left shoulder, you had a psychosomatic limp at one point, but the exercise fends it off.  Oh, and you have a brother you’re not close to.”
Lestrade considered this and nodded.  “Good call.  So we good?” he said, tilting his head towards Molly.  Sherlock nodded.  “Great!  So Molly, can you run this?  We need to see who it belongs to.  Not to overstate things but the fate of the Earth may rest on it.”
“Tell me what?”
“Either John is there or Moriarty.  If it’s John, excellent.  If it is Moriarty he needs to pay for what he’s done.”
“Trust me.  It’s relevant to the case I assure you.”
to happen, whatever it was.  After a while, every time his master past the coffee table he stroked Gladstone’s fur soothingly.  He was happy to help.  Perhaps he could convince his master tummy rubs would also help?
Sherlock watched him leave, then returned to his chair, turning the paper over and over again between his fingers.
“I’m not staring,” John answered automatically, despite the fact he emphatically was staring.  There were very few times in the day that he wasn’t staring at Sherlock, though he justified this by telling himself it was to avert disasters before they happened.  Sherlock tilted his head to stare at John staring.  John, caught, stuck his tongue out, eliciting a small smile from Sherlock.  In retaliation, Sherlock winked at him.  They grinned at each other, until the sound of the door on the other side of the glass swung open and shut.  Yep, he was definitely adorable.
“Sherlock we’re trying to solve a crime, not create one,” Victor teased, while patiently watching the door.  Sherlock relaxed next to him, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible.  The few people on the street seemed to rush past, barely glancing at the two teenagers hanging around.  After a while, a boy rounded the corner of the street, about their age but a few inches shorter, dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie.  He’d walked up to the door and opened it before turning to Victor.
"Hand on my heart, it was not me," John said, actually putting his heart to his chest.  "Mainly because I was on the losing side and was happy the bastard fell."  Sherlock giggled and John desperately wanted to hear that again.
The door swung open.  Sherlock was dressed down in a plain white t-shirt and black skinny jeans which John thought would look lovely strewn across his bedroom floor.  He then quickly dismissed that thought because he felt it inappropriate to ask his neighbour for a favour while picturing him in a compromising situation.
They watched each other for a few minutes, curled up together, both smiling madly.  Sherlock lent in to press a small kiss on John's lips and John rolled onto his side to meet it properly.  When they broke apart, he slung an arm around Sherlock's shoulders and pulled him partially on top of him.  Sherlock responded by throwing a leg over John's and wrapping himself securely onto John's side like a limpet.
Fantastic.  The one thing worse than having nothing to do was having to do something.
He turned to where the girl was still cowering and realised why she hadn’t run; there was a huge gash down her leg.  Still concealing himself, he called out to her in his best ‘bedside manner’ voice.  “Hey.  Umm, he’s unconscious now.  You should probably ring an ambulance and the police.  Do you have a phone?”
was interesting.  John’s ploy worked, and Sherlock was dragged back from the edge by his own curiosity.
“Thanks Greg.  Seriously.  Talk to you later.”
“Yes.”
This was every sensation possible happening simultaneously.  His head was both being pushed around in the G-Force machine used to trial astronauts while also being stabbed by tiny needles.  He couldn’t feel his limbs and felt like the air was an oppressive substance pushing down on every inch of his body.  Even the thought of trying to move seemed on par with not only climbing Mount Kilamnjaro but single-handedly pushing it the circumference of the Earth to return it to its current position and
Sherlock sighed dramatically as if he was tired of being so put upon by other people and spun to look at him directly.  “You cannot remain in that temporary housing block forever.  I need a flatmate to split rent with-”
: I had indeed suffered a short setback. Jones was rather startled. Seriously, Holmes, how long do we want to continue this charade?”
We get a second chance, all thanks to honey.
Jinn was as if one was burning alive. There was a fire in their hearts, and they wish to please people, to bring joy and hope into their lives.
"The father of the child is the colonel himself. He is so in love with her he will marry her. But from there to conclude that it was the young woman who set up a plot against Landsbury for this purpose and that she eliminated Adèle to inherit... I do not believe it!"
Months passed. It was with pleasure that Sherlock Holmes and I rediscovered the softness of Baker Street and the first heat of spring.
When Holmes asked about Jones, I told him of Jones’ personal quest to find his father’s dead body and of his hobby of treasure hunting. I could hear myself getting sentimental, and I will be mocked by Holmes any minute now. He surprised me: “Excellent, Watson. You didn’t have another attack today, dear?”
“Whatever gave you that idea, Mr Holmes?” Mr X inquired.
The stranger looked at us expectantly. As the silence dragged on, he cleared his throat noisily, and then added, “I am [name], the CEO of X.”

Miss Parker, lying on the bed, observed my entrance with astonishment and concern. Her face turned livid. Harshly, she questioned Mary-Ann about my presence. I tried my best to reassure her by explaining that Dr Lewis was on his way. She gave a faint smile and waved me over. Mary-Ann remained by the door, watching my every move carefully.
"Here you are at last." She smiled.
John was sitting in the kitchen. It was still early, not even eight yet.
I am telling all of this—while having still a rambling tendency as if I were a young lad, narrating all and nothing about the events at school—to highlight that my confusion about the situation was fueled by two points: I still weakened state and my; so I assumed; unrequited love for Holmes.
With the years, Holmes even let experiments or a case rest for the day to join me earlier, or at least rest for a few hours. Therefore, I was terribly aware of his absence.

“So... how do you do it, then? You switch people or...?”
He smoked his pipe so vigorously that his face grew even redder. That he drank coffee today instead of tea, I put down as an eccentric way to express his displeasure.
Rapid anguish seized me. Was it another body?

when he had to leave. I’m deeply sorry but Sherlock begged me to not tell anyone, especially you, John.”
Detective Stanley was thrilled to see Holmes again. He was sitting in front of the fire, a cup of tea in his hand. Immediately Mary-Ann came to his service and offered him some cakes.
"We will talk about it at the police station. Forward."
“Bea, Beatrice, my sister.” And the young girl had the nerve to roll her eyes.
“Mmm… I recall one or two moments in which you leapt.”
MORIARTY: Do you imagine that your friend the doctor and your page boy will soon return?
John had prepared tea while his partner had showered. He had discovered some scones in the pantry, courtesy of Mrs Hudson. The jam had looked questionable, but they would go for brunch soon, anyway.
I could barely rescue my buttered toast.
"And what do you think happened then?"
I nearly composed a heated reply when I spotted the gleaming eyes of Sherlock Holmes. I played along. “Well then, I recommend you take another turn in the delightful cold and wait until I am finished to join you for a nice stroll through the park. What do you think, Holmes?”
HOLMES: Billy.
“Maybe, Watson, maybe… Unless it's part of a plan…”
Scarlet smiled, looking proud as if she was a pleased teacher whose student finally solved a complex puzzle.
“But my men are supposed to have searched the entire perimeter. We would have found the girl if she had stayed in Crevecoeur Hall.”
If I put a hand on his back for a millisecond, and if he leant in the touch for another millisecond, who was going to see it?
Could my partner be right? Was this magnificent young woman a formidable schemer? Or was she nothing more than an unfortunate victim of the backbiting of others?
“I will not let myself be fooled, Mr Holmes. You will not strip me for this woman. My uncle died because of her. I will know how to make your throat.”

Seeing the disastrous effect these cheeky jokes had on Mrs Nordon's nerves, on the verge of tears, I saw fit to step in and bring her back to the inn.
"Because Colonel Landsbury, my uncle, can only have written the letter in a moment of madness. I have testimonies from the house staff. All of them agree the colonel has had neurasthenia since his daughter's abduction. He wavered between anger and utter despair. Didn't he kill himself? Hence, he wrote this letter to Mr Holmes in a daze.
For having never been here before, Holmes appeared to have a lot of local knowledge. Normally, I would admire his dedication to the case. More than likely, I would have praised him by now if this was any other day or any other case. Instead, I felt irritated. I should be the one guiding Holmes for once, I should introduce him to my past, I should not be the one who followed and dragged around like a chess piece in some elaborate game of his at worst. Never in our long partnership have I found us on such unequal footing. It was distressing, and if I dare say it, heartbreaking in my mind.
“Frankly, I don’t know if it has a title. The pianist is called Sherlock Holmes.”
The car was a 1926 black Bentley, one owner from new, and that owner had been the cabbie. He had looked after it. Not that this was obvious to the casual observer. They saw, for instance, the half-open Plexiglas barrier was covered with notices warning the passenger not to smoke, telling them much to pay to the various airports. What they assumed to be the recorded voice of somebody famous who reminded them to wear the seatbelt was indeed the driver himself.
"John, you're still wondering why we ended up here?"
“You’re right, Anderson. I mean, just look at Holmes’ muscles! What a powerful neck and chest he has! And eyes as sharp as a hawk’s! And what a great complexion. He doesn’t need to use any of that fine Portuguese makeup or anything to hide any blemishes!”
friend by now. Our pasts forged a bond between us, and even though I did not know how deep the waters were, I trusted him. So far, all his recollections had passed Holmes’ test, and it was not Jones’ fault that my mind played tricks on me.
For a second I considered telling him everything, but my school friend decided for me, as he said: “John, see here, yesterday you prevailed unto my friendship by confiding in me matters which as a journalist I thought more than worthy of publication. Have I known that you would deceive me...?”

Words are living things. They have personality, a point of view, and their own agenda. And I know we need to let the ghosts rest. Our old life ended when we came to Sherrington in 1919.
HOLMES: Possibly not.
“Watson, John..
When I entered the room, which had been the private paradise of me and my lover for many months now, a surprise was waiting for me.
“Mr Holmes! I was despairing.”
“It's okay." I smiled. “We have the time.”
No one, except the seagulls, was here. I was alone.
“Tell me about Sherrington,” I replied. To distract me, her or something else I could not put my finger on, I tried on my old role as Holmes' assistant. “Who lives here?”
In the soon-to-be-published version, I penned down that Holmes offered me tickets to the opera as an apology.
HOLMES: The gentleman I am pointing out to you with this six-shooter desires to have us get something out of his left-hand coat pocket.

His most precious memory was the one in the drawing-room. London was falling into turmoil. The rip had been opened, and Jessica had been locked into a nightmare. It was a literal nightmare. And yet, they’ve always functioned in scenes of danger.
Holmes, engrossed in the notes, did not so much as look up when I abruptly announced my intentions to retire.
The play itself drew material from Conan Doyle's published stories "A Scandal in Bohemia", "The Final Problem" and "A Study in Scarlet", while adding much that was new as well. As the plot was largely taken from Doyle's canon, with some dialogue directly lifted from his original stories, Doyle was credited as a co-author, even though Gillette wrote the play.

Instead of finding a note that showed the first letter of the days of the week with S for Saturday underlined, it read:
“I see,” replied John, British-polite. “Tomorrow I will telephone.”
He took off his hat, revealing some grey hair dotting a shiny skull. At my request, he took a chair and sat down beside me. Holmes joined us.
“What else should I do?” I replied, touched to the heart by those words out of Holmes' mouth.
Instead of undertaking his morning rounds as he used to do as a Rugby player in his early twenties, John hobbled across the room, heavily leaning on his cane, forbidding himself to think about how he came to the injury or how his shoulder looked without clothes nowadays. On his other hand, he had a mug of tea and an apple, both of which he put down onto the desk. Sitting down, he opened the drawer on the desk to get his laptop. He reread the entries of his blog, telling that this would pass, that his stay in this strange world was limited and finite.

father were best friends, but they were more than that: they were lovers. I cannot say exactly for how long, but I assume for many years. I do not know what tipped them off, but in the end, they abandoned their old life and start a new one together. Mrs Jones was right: there was never another woman in her husband’s life. I think she knew or at least suspected what was going on. Hence, her reluctance to talk about it and discouraging her son to investigate his fate. Your grandfather staged his death, natural causes, so no investigation. Then, five days later, the good friend, David Jones’ father, disappeared with the carriage. That is crucial, Watson. It was important that not only the man vanish, but his transport also must not be found. Now, they had transportation. A dead man could hardly board a train, and here, getting new passports is nearly impossible. No, they needed to go to London. It is the melting pot of a nation where one can reinvent oneself. Maybe they are still there, perhaps they travelled overseas, they have most likely passed on by now. Hopefully, they lived long and happy.”
“Cartridge called. He’s seen an article...”
As he read the few lines, Stanley's eyes widened. Finally, they landed on Holmes, bewildered. The latter made a gesture of denial. No, he was not the author of this message.

“But they're going to charge Robert with the crime, Mary-Ann. I left the corpse in evidence. It was no small task. Then I ran to stand behind a tree a good distance away to shoot down the survivors. But I wasn’t quick enough. And the night…”

People should stop and stare at them, Baker Street bustling with people, noise and smell everywhere, but London continues to exist as if today is a regular day.
Well, back to you, Dr Watson. Your new professional title is as promising as it’s intriguing: Consulting Detective Assistant. Can you elaborate a bit about its meaning?
When I woke the following morning, I was not as refreshed as I wished, and probably needed for today’s activities. Dreams had plagued me during the night, or had they been memories? I could not tell.
Holmes walked past the couch to the open window of our cottage and held up the drooping stalk of a rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never seen him show any keen interest in natural objects. However, I mused, it made sense that Holmes would be interested in flowers as they are essential for bees. Just seconds ago he had presented me with the magnum opus of his golden years. He had picked up the volume from the table and read out the whole title,

like an ice sculpture, we caught the culprit in the act: our client. Jacob Marley had hired us to find her, but out of sinister motifs: he wanted his daughter and his ship back while getting rid of the unwanted son-in-law who knew too much of his business.
"The colonel will not like it, but I will allow it, Mr Holmes." It was almost as good as an apology, and I know Holmes preferred this white flag over some shallow small talk.
THE END (is it?!)
The first two or three miles we were silent. Cautiously, not only concerning the speed limit, we sat in our seats. Not once, another vehicle has crossed our path. What a difference to the buzzing metropolis of London, the melting-pot of our nation, getting more crowded every passing day! Not only because of this, I wished to retire to the countryside. After coming home from the war in Afghanistan all those decades ago, I had been drawn to the capital; now, at the dawn of a new war, all I wanted was to find shelter.

"The bottle seems pretty meaningful to me."
“No, the colonel won't accept the truth until it is shown to him.
According to the young detective, the mastermind behind this crime had come up with a way to press the drugs into a form similar to a carrot. The cool environment worked as a natural freezer for this special party drug. When no one was looking, a culprit could snatch up the carrot and blame the melting snow, children or animals.
The night was tense.
“Why do you want to sleep in my bed?”
My friend replied, a tad too eager to be polite: "Then, pray to tell, Mr Marley."
John saw the need in him, how he tried to battle against his
Outside, we found Robert pulling a horse out of the stable. It was a beautiful beast, black and with powerful hocks, but quite jittery. Concerned, I observed how my companion approached the coachman. I didn’t like this manoeuvre one bit.
HOLMES (
"What about the rest of the household?"
Looking around, some burden is gone. I could deduce myself that this must be the room David Jones’ father had seen my grandfather the last time before all hell broke loose. Here, he must have had sat in his armchair by the fireplace, ordering a brandy and an excellent cigar, and waiting until the house became quiet to meet with his lover in secret, both probably counting the minutes until they would start a new life. They both knew that it would be a rough sea, but they had hoped that the tide would turn in their favour. Not even Holmes knew if they had made it safe, but love means trust, and hopefully happy endings.
“It must be said that I was so surprised to learn that my uncle recognized your child. He's a man I've never liked, always so picky about honour. I couldn't imagine…”
“There are simply no references, Watson. She's been playing with me from the start. So
found himself at a dead end. He despised Mr Marley. Countless times he caught himself contemplating either taking his own life or that of his demons.
The man — who even activated audio and video — was the leader of the London base. Instantly, Sherlock put on the persona of an overexcited fan.
The obvious went unsaid, but not unheard.
John had just urged Scarlet to drink a cup of tea when Mrs Hudson announced herself with a knock.
“Well, it certainly deceived me,” I said. “But was it really necessary for me to be incarcerated for the duration?”
"Yes, but I wanted to draw your attention to a disturbing fact."
I took off my heavy coat and the scarf, which I had worn to counter the harsh temperatures outside, and placed them on the rack. We had added it to the Spartan furnishings of the room shortly after we had started our relationship because the bed, and most other furniture, was used for something else.
If I were to be the romantic everyone accuses me of being, I would pen something like,
We probably would not have retired here together if not for the tale I privately call
When I sat in my chair by the fireplace later, I mused that it had been perfect.
"A competitor of yours, I imagine. He was quicker than you at sniffing out the woman’s true motives."
While Greg’s face showed recognition and grew alarmed, Sherlock’s remained blank.
Their daughter had found the medallion in the garden while playing with Toby. Apparently, it had hidden in some common fern, around the spot where Sherlock wants to set up the beehive. Together, they searched for the companion piece and found it behind the antique mirror.
Dawn approaches far too soon and too late.
When the door closed behind us for some stolen hours, I wasn’t all that unhappy with myself.
At the table, eating buttered toast and drinking tea, Watson inquires about my plans.
for a drink or two.
Holmes nodded. The inspector explains, not without taking back an anise cake: “We did indeed find the little girl's coat and a blanket in the vault. The servants formally recognized him. My men searched the area badly. Last, Adèle lived there for a few days under the supervision of someone. The coachman, without a doubt.”
Mr Holmes has also emphatically stated that he will do everything to end this scandal.
From somewhere, John heard his voice again,
“Oh, hello!” She greeted us absent-minded, already in scrubs and the scalpel in hand.
THE END
Sherlock remembers remixes. He, who always loved to spot patterns, creates his own. There ought no same leitmotif in different etudes, but who says that you cannot create their own?
“It's all decided. I refuse!” Mrs Nordon said in a tone that admitted no retort.
“Mr Nordon exists, I've found him.”
his belt.
“What do you need?”
It was still snowing when we made our way to the London dockyards. The streets were deserted. Not even a carriage was passing by. They would not pick us up as passengers, anyway.
He wears red leggings with latticed shoes that go high up his leg and a light blue shirt that fits him smartly. On top of this, he wears a surplice, the long white tunic that parish clerks often wear.
Mycroft would
"So what? It's cold these days. It's not unusual to make a fire."
WATSON: I think we can safely assume that this sex toy...
HOLMES’
"You have too much imagination, Doctor Watson. I'm a simple person. I know criminals and Mrs Nordon is one, without a doubt. That she entered Colonel Landsbury's service under a false name already seems sufficient to me. I'm just waiting for his confession to take the case to the judge."
I gained more riches in life than I thought I would. I achieved a great career; I solved many mysteries, including that of the fountain of youth; and I made friends, one in particular.
Holmes nodded affirmatively. He introduced me, but the coachman did not seem to be interested in my presence.
It ended with death: the informant whom Holmes wanted to meet in the disguise of Basil outside the tavern was killed before he could utter one word. The seconds during which I saw his figure falling, my eyes fixed on Holmes in the hideout, were one of the most terrifying experiences in the whole endeavour. I didn’t hear a sound, so I couldn’t be sure that the killer wouldn’t strike again and this time aimed for my companion. There were four meters between them, and what a difference it made.
“Oh, yes, Watson. His confession today
I was baffled.
"And if…
“I should stand up and leave immediately. Yet, one is accustomed to your personality and peculiarity. Good for you.” Holmes looked stunned for a minute, yet he offered no explanation or apology. Instead, he seemed to wait for me to continue. I reined myself in, but only quiet. “As you have already
Our family are adventurers, as well as our loved ones. We always search for the unknown because we know that love will find us. It might take a while but with a changing time so changes the sea, and the tide is always turning. It is our nature.
And because I - no, we - can, we kiss some more.
Please watch over
After all, it has been over one year already.
The statement streaked me immediately as odd. As did Cartridge’s whole demeanour.
“That’s a skull.”
“We can still be brilliant, John. And we have to be. We owe it to Beatrice and Jessica.”
The inspector was stunned for a second, then thought better of it and left.
"She's a good person. Hard worker, she is always nice and smiling."
“What about you, Watson? I, personally, don't like war. I
We could have been carried away, and oh, how I wished to explore our bodies further, but it was a new morning and I needed closure.
The End
“How do you know about my family?”
"But it is to be suspected that your daughter is with him, is it not, Mr Marley?"
“Mostly thefts from lock-ups.” She could not hide her smirk in time. “Seriously. Your Holmes could read the weekly crime report in the paper if you do not believe me. About thirty offences a year, pretty much all minor. We’ve never had a murder.” Her expression turned grave.
"Do you know, Watson, why the fire was lit in Adèle’s room the night she disappeared?" Holmes asked bluntly.
"How easy it is with you. If I had known…"
“It is… in a way. Just why Holmes? If Mrs Hudson would do it…”
Sherlock heard their daughter's laughter and glee. He looked up, his eyes finally meeting his husband’s. Both men smiled. He could never hate it though, he just could not bring himself to utter the words, "I love it, I really do, all of it, our life, Rosie, you," so easily. It was easier to swear and to hear the fond comment "bloody drama queen" or "you wanker" instead. It was their language, and at last, it was their shared life.
The second one was that I pitted Gregory Lestrade, who had appeared at our doorstep some twenty minutes later.
“Yes, I do. Please, Sherlock, please.”
, Holmes, as it is
I want to dance with him for the last time, but Watson is too weak. So we sway in the moonlight. I am mostly carrying his weight.
Further, it makes little sense to retire where everyone goes if you want to escape them. Who could promise them they will not walk into a client, some journalist turned blogger as a part-time hobby, or God forbid former colleagues from Scotland Yard?
“I was in the shower this morning and I thought of you,” he said, his mouth unwilling to explain further.  John was a smart man however.
It turned out that Barry Faber did not have many people in the afterlife he called ‘friend’.  This suited some people and, in this instance, made everyone’s lives a little easier.
“You want to know what I dreamed of?” he asked quietly, and Sherlock nodded, pausing.
“Don’t worry, I let the landlady know we were coming,” he said, rifling for something in his pocket.
“I had a good time John,” Sherlock said, seeing through him in an instant.  “And I was going to say if you ever needed another model, I wouldn’t mind helping out,” he said, blushing slightly.
“S’fine,” Sherlock said with a shrug.  Shards of glass, pieces of wood, and dust fell down as he shook out his wings and ruffled his hair, Lestrade helping dust down his coat.
“Love you too,” John mumbled sleepily.
“Come on, Greg’s inside.”  She led them inside, past a black door that was near identical to its neighbours, and down the hallway.  Through the dark he could see furniture covered in tarpaulin suggesting this was formerly someone’s home but the walls all a blank white.
“Nice try but no.  Now leave.”
“I will not be bullied by two teenagers.  What do you want anyway?”
Sherlock couldn’t help the feeling of pride when he looked into to what once was the upstairs bedroom but was now a veritable mini-forest.  Perhaps it was because he knew it made John happy, which in turn meant that Sherlock made John happy by creating the room itself.  He squashed this feeling however when he realised he should still be annoyed and so switched back to his scowl.  John was stood blocking the doorway, his big, round eyes and jumper making him look the picture of innocence.
"It's actually happening! I'm so proud! Right Irene, round everyone up, we'll move this to my place.  Have fun, be safe kids!"  The boy called Victor shouted at them like he was their mother, then ran out the room, shepherding Irene in front of him and slamming the door shut again.
“How do you know it cuts out?”
“Well it’s been ages since we’ve been able to meet up and I’ve missed you like crazy so I got Bill to switch shifts with me and decided to come and surprise you.  Be all romantic or whatever,” he added teasingly, cupping Sherlock’s face.
“How could I?  You want me to get you anything while I’m there?  New femur maybe?” John said as he walked towards the lifts.
ever again.
“I know.  But you have to admit it was a shocking shade of pink, and although that has a lot of meaning for us, I feel we don’t need it as a centrepiece in our home.”
“Nah mate.  Ain’t worth my head to go gossiping to you.  Plus, you’ll know everything, soon enough.  That is, if you stop digging.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly looked around at the three other techs also in the lab.  Then she yelled “Guys I need to room!”  Sherlock was startled that everyone listened but Molly just shrugged.  “People are sort of scared of me.”
“You ran away after the club that night,” John said, defending himself.
“Go on dear, or he’ll just start yelling again and we’ve already had complaints from next-door about the noise,” Mrs Hudson said, ushering him towards the door.  He was about the ask “what noise” but thought better of it.
Sherlock was running after the culprit.  As usual there was no time to wait for Scotland Yard but he was sure they would catch up.  Eventually.
“You’re stuck with me now.  Maybe one day I’ll be able to do that mind-reading thing you do and I won’t have to ask these questions.”
“It doesn’t mean anything!  But yeah, I’ve been considering someone for it,” he said, twirling his fork around his pasta with extreme focus.  Mike simply raised an eyebrow.  “It’s the guy across the hall from me okay?  You happy?”
Even when Mrs Hudson called up to announce a young man was here to see him, by the end of the fortnight, he could barely rally the energy to be pleased about it.  It was probably useless anyway.  However, he did manage to prop himself up.
Interesting.
“Sherlock! Thank you so much for this, you really...” John trailed off as he realised where Sherlock was stood, leaning on his room’s door.  “You alright? Didn’t set anything on fire?”  At the lack of immediate response John admonished with a “Sherlock!”
When Sherlock had first rung he was annoyed but unsurprised considering the other boy’s social graces.  It wasn’t the first time and he was sure it wouldn’t be the last but
With Sherlock’s dramatic declaration and exit, John had assumed the next part may include some running, jumping, general catching of bad guys.  A chance to play action hero.  He was even more intrigued when, on chasing after Sherlock and asking him what next, Sherlock simply jumped into a cab and said “Shhhh. Thinking.”
“I never said that.”
Greg didn’t leave it.
Beside a sudden acquisition of gym-etiquette knowledge, Sherlock had just about managed to meet all the instructors on the rota and although he would happily arrest most of them for crimes of being overly enthusiastic and overall idiocy, none of them had actually committed the crime he had been sent after.  Well, he’d arrest them all except Ivan.  He was not afraid to admit he was a little scared of Ivan.
“That young man left then?”
Fuck.  That
Upon hearing John’s voice, Sherlock launched himself down the rest of the stairs and barrelled straight into him.  Locking his arms around John’s waist, he began nuzzling John’s neck with a contented “John,” slipping from his lips.
“That’s how you see me?  Really?” John said, not only trying to deflect the rather on-point question but also partially curious.
The fairytale couldn’t last forever after all and reality thundered back in.  All that was needed was a lightning bolt to enlighten him to the truth and now his world, so bright recently, had taken on a shade of grey.
When he had slumped into his own chair, he figured Sherlock had had enough time to process.  John had made a deduction of his own, which he was very happy about.  “Which underground station does it relate to then?”
“But you already know what’s killing them.”
“The Guards will have verified it you know,” Molly said, even as she did as bid and logged into some software.  Sherlock scoffed to demonstrate just what he thought of the Guards ability.
“I need excitement too,” Sherlock said.
"Text him."
“Indeed, your very own precious Council. I was here entirely legitimately in fact.  Not something I ever want to do again, far too easy.”
Sherlock’s door opened.
Mycroft was not inclined to play along.  “Yes, please do sulk.  I find self-pity is the most productive emotion.  But, when you decide you would like to cause more havoc in my life, you are needed downstairs.”
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes and they both turned their heads slightly.
Sounded like the whole gang was coming then.  John wondered how hard he’d get hit if he started calling Greg’s car the Mystery Machine.
“I’m good thanks.  What about you?  I see things with Greg are going well,” he teased.
“I was just going to say that I was going to ask you something, you know, before the whole criminal-attempting-to-stab-you incident.”  Sherlock nodded.  John scratched the back of his neck again, this time nervously.  There were different types of neck scratches.  Sherlock had them documented in his mind palace.  “I just wanted to ask, and you can say no, like I won’t mind, well I will mind but I promise not to be weird about it, and this probably breaks like six different codes of my contract, but then again you know the whole member of staff being arrested thing is probably a bigger problem, but I just wanted to ask, if you would maybe want to, I don’t know, go out, some time?  With me.  Obviously.  Not at the gym.  Like as a date.”  John said the first section without taking a breath and then ground to a juddery halt.  He had aimed most of this speech at his shoes, the front desk, his shoes again, the wall opposite, and Sherlock’s left ear, before finally quickly locking eyes, looking mildly terrified.
"It made me feel more at home," he replied, a small smile curling up before he looked up at John. Saw the way he frowned and moved his mouth into that scrunch he did when thinking or deliberating.
he had solved the case.
Sherlock sighed dramatically and launched himself around the sofa.  “His thinly veiled question was do you know who killed him?”
John worried if he had pushed too far.  They hadn't actually stated what this was and although Sherlock was clearly planning a next time (oh thank god there was a next time), that didn't necessarily mean relationship.  Luckily though, Sherlock hummed in agreement.  "What did you have in mind?"
“John.  Yes.  Safe?” Sherlock scowled at them as if this was explanation enough.
“John.”  Strange, how a name so normal could suddenly feel so different.  His eyes kept flickering over to the scene before him, eventually landing on a brick precariously balanced over rubble.  “And a Fallen, named Moriarty.”  He spat out the name.
.  There was only one other explanation.  Lestrade was going to have an aneurysm.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Really John be serious.”
“Hmmm,” Sherlock mused.  “Might be tricky.  You really have been awful.”  If he lunged he could probably snatch it from his hands.  He’d only get one shot but he could be very wily when required.  Raz seemed to notice his calculations and gripped the paper tighter, holding it further away.
“Oh John, it’s as if you expect it to stay that way,” Sherlock grinned, let go of John and launched himself down the stairs.  A few minutes later John heard crashing and the clinking of glasses.
“So nothing’s going on with Victor?” John was still frowning but he no longer looked angry.
As he made his way through the buildings and up the stairs, the walk seemed to stretch on far longer than usual.  Had they accidentally moved the hall buildings further away when he wasn’t looking?  Were they now in Scotland?  Was Sherlock interested in Scottish people?  Should he attempt the accent?  No, that was ridiculous.  Or was it?  No it was.  Definitely was.  God he was freaking out.  He took out his keys and started messing with them, something to keep his hands from twitching.
“You can go home, if you want.”
While John was distracted ruffling the dogs ears, Sherlock took him in.  Ignoring the fact that the first thing his mind screamed was 'cute', the next thing was military.  But what was a soldier doing walking dogs in Marylebone?
Lestrade was taken aback by the question.  If it didn’t have to do with the case, Sherlock seemed uninterested in finding out about the personal details of anyone other than John.
was enough to make his head hurt.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.  “It’s sturdy.”
“Tosser.  Though because you remember me, I expect a birthday present this year.  Unlike last year.  You know, when you forgot.”
“Mycroft get out.”
John and Lestrade both resisted the urge to roll their eyes.
“-Oh come on.  This one’s easy.”  John swallowed awkwardly.  He lifted his arms to show what was under his coat.  Twisting around his body was a writhing purple energy.  Primed.  Deadly.
"Sherlock, are you okay?" John said slowly, as if speaking to a skittish wild animal, trying to appear unruffled.
“I imagined your hands on me,” he said and grabbed one of John’s hands, forcing him to shift his weight, and dragging it down his chest to his groin.  John’s eyes were locked on his and Sherlock noticed a hitch in his breath as his hand brushed Sherlock’s tented trousers.
“I haven’t hid your phone,” Sherlock said, a touch too quickly.
"Afghanistan or Iraq?"  John flinched.  Sherlock belatedly realised he probably should of alerted him to his presence.
“Well, I heard you’d got a new case with Greg, the gym one and-”
Okay, admin over, enjoy!
“Lock,” John whimpered and the strain in his voice must have betrayed how close he was because Sherlock stopped.  From the way his eyes slammed shut it looked like he wasn’t far behind either.  John whimpered when Sherlock lifted up onto his knees which quickly changed to a gasp as he trailed feather light kisses down his face, his neck, his chest, until he was right at the top of his jeans.  He groaned slightly as Sherlock sat up and there was only minimal contact because he was aroused and could be contrary if he wanted to be.  He propped himself up on his elbows to half-glare at him but he was too far gone for it to be really effective.  Sherlock looked up at him and he must have looked like a wreck because that’s how he felt but Sherlock seemed mesmerised for a second.  John broke the moment by nodding and lifting up his hips, and closed his eyes at the feeling of Sherlock taking his jeans off and throwing them to the floor to join their shirts.  His opened his eyes as the room stilled for a second and looked up at Sherlock quizzically.  Sherlock looked very pleased with himself which really should have given John a clue.  He then leant down and, without breaking eye contact, grabbed the boxer waist-band by his teeth and pulled them off of John.  And then, the bastard winked.
“All in good fun I assure you.  Wouldn’t matter as much if you just told us.  Come on, Alpha?  Omega?”
He turned to look at the Fallen.  It was the first time since their argument that he’d looked Sherlock in the eye.  He seemed to be searching for something, his eyes scanning John’s features.  He looked almost...sad?  John frowned and in response so did Sherlock, until John realised that he was looking for a sign they were okay.  John smiled.  He was still a pissed, yes, but they were okay.  For now.  Sherlock smiled back and his shoulders released some of their tension.
Sherlock rolled onto his back to glare at his not-housekeeper.
He exited the bedroom confidently.  He then turned tail and grabbed the purple shirt.
“Lawyer?” John asked with a raised eyebrow but his eyes said he didn’t believe it.
Sherlock paused for a second.  He was looking at John as if he had just announced he was going to drink the Thames.  “
“Do you think Gladys murdered Mr Faber?”
"Afghanistan.  How did you-?"
“And have you?” she asked bluntly.
His scandalised tone only made Sherlock giggle more.  “Hysteria might be setting in,” he managed to stutter out.
to be here with my boyfriend, although he appears to have run off somewhere, as always.  What about you?”
“What is it?” John leaned in.
This wasn’t his bedroom.  This wasn’t even a bedroom.  It was a living room.  But not his living room.  Where the hell was he?
“And you think
“The fact you hate working with the Guards.”  He almost laughed.  “Come on Sherlock.  Cut us some slack, I’m really trying to help you here.”
John just shrugged in response.  “I said it was weird.”
“Worried about me?”  It was John’s turn to tilt his head in confusion.
Don’t think about him.
“Yeah, you may want to tell your body language that.  There are advantages to your constant nagging about observance you know.”
Sherlock ran through possible options: either 1) John was downstairs with Mrs Hudson (unlikely, he would have heard them as he walked in), 2) John had been kidnapped by either his brother (highly likely) or, 3) John was upstairs which meant that John was hiding or upset (unknown likelihood).
, he justified to himself,
“I prefer to text,” Sherlock said, pocketing John’s phone.  That was the last he’d see of that then.  Presumably it would be drafted into an experiment of some kind in the near future, but that was a problem for future John.  Currently, of the two people he texted, one was currently on his way here and the other was stood before him.  At first he thought the suddenly narrowed eyes were on him, before he realised they were looking beyond him to the creature on the floor.  He was surprisingly quiet for a suspect, not even struggling anymore, just breathing quietly.  Waiting.  John knew better than to relax his grip.  He had landed heavily on his bashed up shoulder which was protesting violently and he wasn’t sure another flying tackle would have the same effect.  The suspect’s eyes were on Sherlock, surveying him, particularly lingering on the wings.  Maybe he thought that Sherlock would help, that he could use the fact he had those wings too as a bargaining chip.  He was about to get a surprise.
“Don’t worry dear, he’ll be back at some point.  He keeps strange hours our Sherlock.”  John began to deny both that he was waiting for Sherlock to appear and that he was in any way ‘ours’, but Mrs Hudson had already disappeared into the kitchen again.  Selective hearing appeared her specialty.
“You ready?” John asked him, mischief in his eyes, but before Sherlock could ask he was suddenly falling through the air onto his bed.  He was about to protest but John giggled and crawled on top of him, capturing his lips again.  They awkwardly wriggled up the bed which had them both laughing at the ridiculousness of it, until they were actually on the bed properly.  Sherlock rocked up from the bed and they lazily rubbed against each other, John teasingly backing off when Sherlock’s gasps grew ragged.
Jake shrugged.  “Could be any of them.  That’s partly why I agreed to let you look.  I thought if you were as good as Victor said you were then you could help us pinpoint who it is.”
should have been easy.
“He doesn’t seem too damaged.  No use trying to change the past.”  Sherlock’s eyes lost focus at the last sentence, the words turning inwards.  John was about to challenge him, and insist a medical professional examine Raz’s back, when Lestrade interrupted.  Whatever internal battle he was waging seemed to be resolved, or rather, he had a plan to resolve it.  Lestrade liked plans.  They made sense of a world which had recently turned bizarre.
Sherlock smiled.  “That’s why I’m my own boss now.  Can you tell me about your boss?”
When he did, John was grateful for the pause.  He was frozen, mesmerised.  Unwinding was not Sherlock’s speed.  But there, in the middle of the floor, he looked
As John had stated many times to himself, this was all a trap.  He knew it was a trap.  Sherlock knew it was a trap.  No one should be surprised by it being a trap.
) and he would smile, the one smile that he saved for John, the one that was his alone.
It took a moment to work out what he was looking at.  On the screen was a map of the streets they had just been down.  Lines traced over the most of the streets, a tangle of criss-crossing and well-worn tracks.  Sherlock definitely shouldn’t have access to this.
Initial impressions were of a short narrow room that could barely qualify as a corridor, brimming over with stacks of alcohol on rickety shelves.  Plastic wrapping was everywhere, half opened packages shoved into rough piles as the drinks were put out as quickly as they were selling.  Clean-up clearly started after customers stopped badgering the bar staff and they had three minutes of quiet to themselves.
A truce had been called over 221B.
.  What brings you here?”
“Hello.  Lestrade’s house, Molly speaking.”
“Hi, I’m Victor.  Nice to meet you,” Victor said, sticking out a hand.  John shook it because he was polite dammit but couldn’t help comparing Victor’s soft palms with his own scarred ones from hours fiddling with camera equipment.  He was floundering for something to say.
Finally, I hope you all enjoy this final chapter and I really really hope it was worth the wait!
“Hi Sally,” he said.  John knew exactly two things about Sally Donavon.  One) she worked with Lestrade in the higher profile cases.  Two) she did not approve of Lestrade inviting John onto crime scenes.  One of these would make the next bit difficult.
Sherlock glanced at him, breaking the weird staring competition he was engaged in.
“What do you mean?” Molly asked.
There was supposed to somehow be more plot in this chapter, really pushing us into the action.  Then I started writing a month ago and the chapter got a bit busy and then I got a bit busy and basically it's a month later than the last chapter, I've somehow written 5k words and we're still not at the part I wanted to be at.  If this carries on I expect the next chapter to be about 9k long and featuring at least *gasp* two plot points! :P
“I know Lock.  I know,” John breathed, the endearment falling from his lips easily.  His hands lifted to mirror Sherlock’s, running across his cheeks and petting his hair.  It was a check as much as a comfort, confirming their presence to each other.  He kept up a refrain of “I know” and “It’s alright”, his voice shaky but calm.  Sherlock couldn’t work out why he was making shushing noises until he felt a whimper rise up in his own throat.  He clung on to John, his entire body shaking uncontrollably.  The only thing keeping him upright was John’s arms, an anchor in the storm of his own emotions.  He couldn’t say how long they stood there.  It could have been seconds, or minutes, or day, or months.  All he knew was that eventually his breathing levelled out and he could finally take in the solid weight of John against him in a way that didn’t make him want to sob violently.  It was this awareness that led him to realise he had partially collapsed into John which, although comforting, also meant he was clinging on very tightly.
or something," Sherlock continued and John halted his travel plans.
“You can ask.  I don’t mind,” Sherlock added, although his mouth twisted and he put the biscuits down.
“By sticking his fat nose where it doesn’t belong.  And using powers he shouldn’t have to leverage me out of the Other Place.  Not entirely sure why.”
The most annoying thing was that Molly seemed unaffected.
“Seen anything?”
“Hi,” Sherlock said, trying to stop his smirk from falling into a beaming smile and failing miserably.
Because, once upon a time, his own results had also come through as ‘No results found’, until he’d gone through the long winded process of registering.
“Only for you my love, only ever for you.”
“Um, sure, I’ll see if I can go,” he tried to smile in a way that conveyed something close to interest.  Thank god he’d had a lot of practice at it.
Sherlock thought of the last name.
I just wanted to say thank you for everyone leaving a comment- they've really made my week! :D I wanted to get this chapter out for you all and have had a lot of fun writing it so I hope you enjoyed.
“John?” said a deep, roughened morning-voice.  John’s face lit up with a beaming smile as a sleepy Sherlock froze on the stairs.
.  It was only as he walked down the street that his paranoia kicked back in and he reassessed if he had actually been talking to Mrs Hudson at all.  Either way, they had certainly captured her mannerisms and had given him his marching orders.  He was certain John, and answers, were not in the flat.  That left him with one more solution.
, flickering between different experiments, web searches, tv channels, composing.  Then there were the crashes where nothing was of any interest at all.  His mind slowed and stagnated, until the only thing of comfort was to pluck listlessly at his violin and wait.  Just waiting.  Constantly waiting.  Repeat this rollercoaster cycle ad infinitum.
“Sherlock?  You want to get up?  Bit of a time sensitive situation going on here.”
.  More…blindingly furious.
it.  He'd ordered his drink from a bored looking barista, although having worked in coffee chain himself he couldn't blame her, and was looking around the place and there he was.
“What were you glaring at?” he asked casually.
“You need to listen to your alarm!” Mike said, shaking his head.
“Oh for- Sherlock Holmes.  Listen to me.  You will go on this date.  It will be a little awkward and mostly nice and you will spend most of the time oscillating between thinking he’s real cute and wondering if he think you’re cute which, spoiler alert, he totally does!  You will be fine.  Now say it back to me.”
It was regular Thursday, or at least, it was to start.  Sherlock had been called in, in order to help with a possible robbery at a boutique.  Lestrade wouldn’t have bothered but the particulars of this exact case were at least a strong 7 if not a 8 which was a lot better than some of the more recent cases which had either been dismissed or ignored.
“Come on, we’re all just curious.”
.  His cock remained stubbornly hard.
“I said nothing,” Mike said politely
Greg was not, as the other two seemed to think, stupid.  And he knew the sight of two people falling for each other when he saw it.  It might do them both good, so long as they didn’t destroy each other on the way round.  Quite sweet in a way.  Definitely a good story by the end of this, if they would actually recognise what the other was putting out.
“I don’t recall ever sounding like a bear with a sinus infection.”
He was seriously contemplating texting Lestrade and telling him that he really couldn’t take the case after all because his brains were literally going to drip out of his ears from the dullness of it all, when the phone rang.  He stared at the skull, contemplating answering.  It wouldn’t be anything interesting.  It never was.  He was going to have to live with being bored for eternity because everything was boring and dull and hateful and-
He expected Sherlock to have already retreated to his room, so was surprised when he nearly collided with him at the top of the stairs.  The shock made him inhale and god, Sherlock smelt amazing, and his shirt was so soft, and he looked up, and Sherlock looked down and it was that moment again and he was going to-
He didn’t hear the banging at first.  He had his headphones on, blasting music, trying to focus on the stupid report he had to write up which he had left to what felt like the last second because he was an

He finally stumbled (
It was still empty.
, it would be chaos otherwise.
, there was a set of double doors.  Closed obviously, the decay of age welding it shut as much as a lock would.
“Would you like me to go?” John sounded utterly casual.  What Sherlock could not hear however was John’s internal debate about whether Sherlock actually did want him to go or was just asking out of politeness?  What if Sherlock was embarrassed by him?  John knew, in the abstract, that he wasn’t

happened, just so his worry was justified.  However, if he had spotted the trap, then so had Sherlock, and he was still willing to go into the building.  This was not a glowing recommendation of safety but if he was willing to get himself into trouble, then he would need back-up and that consisted of John and…John.  He could text Lestrade.  It surely couldn’t be counted as interfering in a case when the case fell on to your doorstep and invited you to look by name.
John floundered, confused about how this had fallen apart so quickly.
“He didn’t tell you?  Sofa’s bad for your back anyway old man,” John said grinning.  Technically in the spectrum of forever they were the same age because, you know,
“What about the wings?”
Sherlock shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Move to the countryside, open a farm shop,” he said teasingly.
“We only have your word for it Sherlock, we need to get it verified before you can question suspects, and we don’t have that sort of time before we would need to release Raz.  You stay here, you listen,
.  He clenched his jaw and forced himself back into the present.
“Yes John.”
“Weird?  Not horrifying or gross?  Just weird?” Lestrade questioned as they began moving again.
All of the difficult parts could wait.  For now, this.
“John calm down.  Breathe.  Of course I’ll help.”
He took the opportunity to stop staring a John like a lovestruck fool and turned to Molly.  “With who?”
“Look at me.”  He looked.  It was quite the sight, John kneeling in front of him.  All except for the small frown on his face.  “We can stop, if it’s too much or you don’t want to or-”
.  Languid, loose and yet graceful, rolling from one movement to the next.  He was in control but compelled by the beat.  Although John knew he was looking, always looking, it seemed as if Sherlock was entirely unaware of his surroundings, as if they’d melted away into the generic music.
“Oh, I love the museum.  So it’s not a station anymore?”
Sherlock marched past them, with John throwing them a half-apologetic shrug as he went to follow.
interesting, some odd detail or a person of note but alas no.  The people, despite their gym fixations, were boringly ordinary; a lawyer, an IT consultant, a student, and an amateur athlete.  Another dramatic sigh went unheard, Mrs Hudson’s selective hearing kicking in as usual when her tenant was being particularly difficult.  He didn’t care anyway.  His perfectly valid concerns (or whinging as Mrs Hudson called it) were met with talk of how he couldn’t expect serial killers to turn up out of thin air and how he should be happy,
“You believe it will be John?”
Instead of responding, he said “You’re not allowed to do that,” pointing to the gang dozing on the floor as if the other angel might be confused as to what he was referring to.  Annoyingly, he just huffed a short laugh and then turned as if to walk out the alley.  So, on impulse, John added, “And how the hell did you know about my shoulder?”
Then Sherlock said “Oops,” still clutching his lock-pick.  It was not the best weapon he could have chosen and was not remotely intimidating.
Victor was just about the bloody well tell him what was going on when, in a blur of coat and hair, Sherlock rounded the corner only to freeze at the sight before him.
He was still smiling as he handed it over 45 minutes later.  Sherlock studied it for a moment, and John wondered if he’d judged it wrong, but then Sherlock’s lips tipped into a smile as he looked curiously at John.
John released him, and he would swear he didn’t whimper, he would

going to say something…” Sherlock said but Dimitri remained unmoved.
The Guard side of his brain, the one honed in combat, was decidedly not happy about something.  John scanned the scene again, trying to figure out the reason he was suddenly on edge.  He stretched out his left hand until the knuckles crunched, then scrunched his hand into a fist again.  In his right, he clutched his phone.  He stood straight and stilled, as if he could slow down the world for easy viewing like the footage earlier so long as he stopped too.  The buildings opposite had fronts of glass so no symbol there.  But his gaze kept on jumping over something, as if there was a glitch, a jump cut just behind the railings that surrounded the stairs to the tube.  What
Don’t think about him.
It does not taste good.
John scowled, unhappy with the image of Sherlock facing their captors alone, especially with the equivalent a raging hangover.  He was a good fighter with his wits about him, but they’d outnumber him and overpower him easily.
John rolled his eyes.  Bossy as ever.
“Go on a lot of adventures?”
"J-John. Please," Sherlock whined, his eyes scrunched shut at the teasing.  His hair was messily haloed around his head and his lips were red and kiss-bitten.  He looked absolutely gorgeous and John couldn’t deny him anything.
Sherlock had to plan.  It was the only way this was going to happen.  Saturday was chosen as the optimal day and one-by-one, he eliminated the distractions.
“Great idea,” Molly agreed and the three of them hurriedly scarpered from the house for a few hours, leaving the boys to their reuniting in peace.
For closure.

“Sally please.  Just trust me,” Lestrade said, already backing up so they could slide through.
That was John’s main sensation and to be fair, the only thing he really cared about.  Hunger, thirst, that could all wait because right now he was so comfy that he could reasonably never leave again.  Wherever he was.  Where the hell was he?
“Yeah.  Similar stuff to last time, few new things.”
.  The reason he survived wasn't luck, it wasn't divine intervention, it was whatever they'd done to him.  Bigger wounds couldn't heal completely, hence the mess that was now his shoulder but smaller marks could disappear within hours and sometimes even minutes.  The rest of the official story was fairly true.  He had been rescued almost by accident by an elite team who were storming the base anyway.  His shoulder had been infected but it was mainly a reaction between the hospital drugs and whatever was in his system.  He had returned to England with a psychosomatic limp, a cover story, and a will to ignore the fact anything had changed.
Sherlock’s look gave a damning answer.  “It’s never twins John.”
John coughed and covered the awkward air with another question. “Why a detective?  Why not just join the police?”
The text back came through as he was yelling at the forensic department.
“Oh really?”
"I do remember.  You split acid on the counter top because the volleyball team walked past the window.  It saved me from being kicked out."  Why Sherlock remembered this but did not know the current Prime Minister, John could not answer.
Sherlock lifted his head up to look at John suspiciously.  He might have looked more intimidating if his hair didn't look so wild.
“Yeah, sorry.  Incident last night.  I’ll be right there,” he said, dragging himself from the table.  The prospect of going up the stairs was upsetting.  Nearly more upsetting than being fired for not showing up.
“Slowly.  In fact, John, we’re getting out.”
“And I don’t want you to make a hasty decision that you’ll end up regretting.”
They heard John ask “What bet?” before they were out of earshot.
“-And because I won’t let you rent by yourself,” Mrs Hudson chipped in.
John released his hand from Sherlock’s grasp only to wrap them around his neck as he considered.  “I think we can give it a good go.”
.  Ugh, even the word.”  Sherlock threw his head back dramatically.
He considered the hypothesis.  Was Sherlock a colossal dick?  Yes.  Would he gladly hit him round the head and yell at him a bit?  Absolutely.  Capable of cold-blooded, premeditated murder?  ...No.  Probably not.
.  If he said something and the Fallen happened to be there, then he could get in trouble and John couldn’t let go of him just yet.
