John had so many things to say and ask Sherlock. Thoughts and questions ran through his head.
"But come on, I'm a cop, what are you afraid of? Besides, the patient is a great friend of mine, practically like a relative."
He craned his neck and saw the name of the caller "Lestrade".
"I don't give a damn, Greg, leave him alone."
Someone was staring at him. Towards the bottom of the avenue were some large dumpsters thrown against the wall. Ran towards them, running over towards some policemen
"We have to go to the hospital this afternoon, they want to awaken him up from his induced coma."
"Nothing at all."
"He got a bang on the head, Greg. What do you expect him to do: give you a full sketch of the attacker?"
The car arrived at the scheduled time.
John sat down at one of the stools, away from the middle-aged man, and ordered a whisky.
Sherlock's fingers tried to twitch but he was still too weak and groggy from the drugs. The open eyelid moved around.
"No, it looks personal. Like the animal that did this to this poor guy was upset about something and wanted to teach him a lesson."
Dr Lewis seemed to think about it for a moment.
John was trying to clear the mans airway, after having undone the first few buttons of his shirt. Didn’t care if some popped off.
So no he didn't regret leaving as far away from him as possible at all, and no, he wouldn't admit even under torture that he actually missed her. Terribly.
"Ah. Yes, yes, certainly."
John turned around and walked out without looking back, not even waiting for Greg to go out with him.
"Who did it? The assumptions we've made aren't entirely wrong. I'd say something personal. And you know, Sherlock is very quick to attract people's hatred and annoyance. It wouldn't be the first time he stepped on the wrong people's toes."
He followed the sedan with his eyes until it got lost in traffic.
"I'm sorry Mr. Holmes but we are competent and we are already giving him the best care. Your brother cannot be moved in any way or he may not survive. When the surgery is over he will be in an induced coma for a few days. This is necessary to allow the haematomas, especially those in the head, to heal, and because otherwise he would not be able to stand the pain. Is that clear?" Dr. Lewis pulled out of Mycroft's grasp and stiffly adjusted his gown.
Mycroft's face went from angry towards ready to incinerate anyone who came within his reach. If he had been almost normal colour before, now he was purple and the vein in his jugular was throbbing, almost as if it would explode.
John noticed that there was a woman behind Mycroft, she must have been in her late forties, she was thin, not that tall and wore her dark brown hair perfectly combed back in a tight bun. She was wearing a blazer with a knee-length skirt, everything in strict dark colours. With a worried frown, the woman adjusted the thick glasses that were slipping off her pointed nose. She looked nervous. In fact, John didn't envy her at all. Working for Mycroft must be one of the worst jobs in the world.
"He doesn't answer me."
"Well you blamed him. For your wife, I mean."
In fact, Mycroft had an expression worthy of one of the worst killers on the market.
"It's better if you don't make him talk." Dr Lewis intervened.
"You need to come to the car park in Marble Arch, the one behind the tube station."
There was Mycroft. Always looking gloomy, like one of James Bond's villains who is ready to destroy the world. He was with his secretary, the same one as last time, always in a dark suit and standing as stiff as a pole. Both were leaning against one of the windows. Then sitting next to each other, there were Mrs Hudson and Molly.
"Ah, sure, now it’s convenient for you to defend him! I don't recall yesterday you were of the same opinion."
"Actually, that is not allowed..."
John gave Greg a bad look.
Sherlock opened the only eye he had left. Well wide open so to speak, there was only a slit with black underneath, staring at him from under his long lashes.
John cursed mentally. He knew Greg was right. They needed him, this case was too brutal to leave the culprit on the loose. Every minute that passed someone innocent was in danger of dying such a horrible death.
He pulled down the collar of his shirt with two fingers, horrified. Multiple stripes of different shades of dark purple stood out on his neck.
"What happened to you? Can you tell me?"
John could see his jaw twitching. Sherlock tried to remove his hand, but he couldn't move. A big tear came out of the eye.
He spoke to one of the secretaries sitting in front of a computer, who immediately let him through.
The corridors were long and there were doors spaced on both sides. There were no windows and the ceiling lights were dim. There was a strong smell of disinfectant products.
"He needs to get oxygen therapy in a hyperbaric chamber. His left lung has collapsed and it will take time to get it back.
Silence, stillness. He just looked at him.
"Greg?"
All in all it didn't sound like such a bad plan. John nodded.
"Here comes the evening flight. Let's ask the control tower for permission to land," he put the spoonful of mush into the little girl's mouth, which she opened with squeals of happiness while clapping her tiny hands.
"You tried, didn't you," John guessed, watching the rather personal way in which Sherlock had taken his statement. The detective flapped his hands, but he looked slightly surprised that John had worked him out so quickly. He slowed down slightly, his rage fading.
The taller boy rolled his impressive green-grey eyes. "Well, the fact that they're not here means that someone must have taken them. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, so I came to see if the police were still insisting it was an accident even though the missing shoes point to murder."
secret documents. And if we can – "Ah!" I hook a jemmy out of my pocket and under the floorboard that had sounded hollow when I tapped it; sure enough, with a bit of wiggling it pops free, revealing –
I venture a half-smile. "Here."
A thunderous
"John, please," the detective replied dryly. "We are about to interrogate an undertaker about an assassin, contain yourself."
The detective turns back to him, his fine-boned face incredulous. "Why not?"
"Oh, yes," the detective snorted. "Your acting skills are irresistable."
Sherlock complied, his own mind racing while his body froze uncomfortably still. Kirsty had died within moments of the swarm attaching itself to her. By those standards, he should already be dead, so he couldn't count on having time. Relying on the Doctor having some alien way to save him went against every fibre of instinct he had. There must be some logical way to get rid of the shadow.
the list in any way?" he asked resignedly. Anderson made his usual noise of disgust at the ease with which his DI trusted "The Freak". Sherlock glanced at him scornfully.
John cleared his throat. "Well," he said slowly. "I think that's our cue to leave."
At the sound of the high, vulnerable voice, John groaned and thumped his head on the table. Sophie carefully placed her tray on the bench beside his and frowned down at him.
Sherlock gave him a slow smile and peeled himself away from a column to the front of the stage. "
John's smirk flickered at the sound of the false name – so minutely Sherlock would almost wonder if he imagined it were he not so adept at reading microexpressions. He hitched it quickly back into place and continued the relentless massage up the base of Sherlock's cock, watching his legs twitch helplessly. "Talk to me," John murmured softly. Sherlock moaned, remembering John's assertions that he would have made her come before he considered taking her.
"The owner loved these," Sherlock observed, staring at the shoe intently. "Scrubbed them clean, whitened them when they got discoloured, changed the laces three – no,

John sighed. "How many cups of that stuff have you had this morning?"
John nodded. "Yeah. Why, do you have him too?"
, who had looked at him like John used to and drawn him into the game so eagerly.
He'd read over the script when Will proudly handed it to him, and the proposal had been perfunctory enough that he had remembered it.
Fitzherbert's pudgy face purpled slightly. "Flesh-eating creatures that hatch from trees?" he repeated incredulously. "On
why they always look at me like I'm something disgusting? Because they're
His flatmate pauses for a moment, the breath leaving his lungs in a prolonged whoosh. Then he looks up at John. "Sorry," he says quietly, so quietly that John doesn't hear it over the steady suburban traffic and only understands the word because he can read it on Sherlock's lips. John shakes his head. After another moment of staring blankly at the white front door, Sherlock takes a deep breath in and turns away. "Let's go home for a bit, I can't think with all of this noise."
The arm around my shoulder lifts as Mrs Hudson gets up. "Of course, dear. Good luck." She stops at the door and turns back, looking hesitant. I raise an expectant eyebrow. "So…" she says gently, as though she's not sure how I'll react to her question. "You didn't like it when John kissed you, then?"
Then, without warning, Sherlock sat bolt upright. His chest expanded and contracted sharply, a gasp of fright as though someone had lit a fire under the small of his back. John almost fell off the bed in the sudden flurry of movement, shock radiating ice through the warmth in his extremities. "Sherlock, what -"
"So, Mrs St. Claire," the detective addresses as though nothing has happened, "what can I do for you?"
The boy followed his steps, clasping his hands in front of his bosom wistfully.
to look at. John stepped away from him to kick off his pants and caught his breath at the sight of the young trainee standing naked in front of him, his hands fluttering at his sides as though he was trying not to cover himself up. "God, you're gorgeous," John told him. He smiled shyly.
Sherlock made another show of reluctance, but finally relented with a muttered,
Ben let out a helpless whimper. "
The Doctor shook his head with the tiniest of regretful smiles. "No," he corrected. "It's a perfectly rational fear of the things that live
"Please tell me Mrs Hudson is out," John panted when Sherlock finally pulled away.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow, sending a slightly worried glance in John's direction. Billy swallowed laboriously before gesturing at his companion. "This is Emilia," he introduced. "She was orphaned last year and we look after her now - she and Lizzie were watching the downtown trade streets an' they saw him."
he cried with almost sarcastic joviality.
John raised an eyebrow. "Neither is Lestrade," he rebutted, allowing the taller man to stride off down the hallway. "Technically, you started it."
The woman tilted her head to one side in her typical expression of frustration when Julien forgot trivial details about clients and customers
Sherlock looked back at him, crestfallen. "Let him go, John," he said quietly. "She's not here."
He made another joyous step towards his companion as though to embrace him again; Ben stepped backwards to avoid the gesture at the same moment as Hermia and Demetrius entered. John quickly grabbed the boy and placed a finger to his lips.
Their Antonio stood stunned, as though speech was beyond him.
Lady Brackenstall? Shouldn't it have been obvious that she was an impostor?"
was something completely new. It wasn't like anything he'd done before. And I'd be very surprised given how popular it was if he didn't attempt to replicate the formula. Perhaps with a stronger lead more suited to you."

John blinks himself back to reality. "You're so pale you kind of draw the eye," he admits as casually as he can. "You're like that reflective stuff on high-vis gear. Next time I jog at night I'll just take you with me, shirtless." His heart stops at the vision. Sherlock smirks.
sorry."
John reached down to his own clothes on the floor and turned the arms of his shirt the right way out, not seeing the hurry. "Other than the fact that a corpulent grandmother was in it instead of a Lady?" he retorted. "Not particularly."
Finally, when Sherlock was panting heavily through his nose against John's cheek, his flatmate broke the kiss, sucking briefly on his neck instead. Sherlock could feel him trying to catch his breath, his thin, swollen lips resting against Sherlock's skin. "Well," John murmured into his neck, his tongue darting out to lick the beginnings of sweat away, "this is certainly the point at which I would suggest we move to somewhere more private."
The man shied away from him. "The manager's not here," he said helplessly. "No-one is, it's too late in the day. There's just us."
John pulls off his jumper as they step back into the sunlight. He's aware that the jumper pulls his shirt up with it and exposes his midriff for a moment. He looks at Sherlock when he surfaces, and his grey eyes are fixed on someone's window-box on the terrace. John wonders if he's imagining the faint pink tinge in the detective's razor-sharp cheekbones.
"And you just never stopped," John finished, frowning at him.
John wakes Sherlock up ten minutes later by slapping him in the face.
," he scolded. His voice clearly stated that he wouldn't tolerate argument; it was a voice that made the carefully-conditioned soldier in John stand up straighter as though itching to salute.
He fell silent as they caught up with the butler, who stood in what John presumed was the study door, watching them with shrewd eyes. Sherlock returned his gaze almost sullenly, clearly communicating that whatever was being discussed was not going to be discussed within his earshot. John smiled slightly. "My Lord's office is through this door," the man said without acknowledging Sherlock's silent reprimand, opening the heavy door to reveal a fastidiously neat study, dimly lit despite the large window backlighting the huge desk.
"John?" Sherlock sounds nervous, but John finds himself unable to speak to reassure him that he's incredible, in fact he's so beautiful that words just shrivel up and die. He grips the detective's shoulders instead, guiding him until he sits down on the bed with a
Sherlock hummed. "I suppose we can hope that the trauma from this murder will stop her for a while," he mused.
I vault off the sofa and am accosted by a sudden wave of nausea and lightheadedness; I sit back down abruptly and put my head between my knees. If this goes on much longer I'm going to have to eat under my own steam and admit to myself that John doesn't care about me as much as I thought he did.
This had the consequence of pushing John's weight harder into Sherlock and his face into Sherlock's neck; Sherlock laughed. "Yes, like that. Maybe one at a time, though."
Charlotte blushed slightly. "I was in a relationship for a while," she said, turning away and draining the glass of violently red liquid. "Since it ended I haven't felt like going out. Tonight I sort of decided I was ready to put myself out there again."
Sherlock shifted, the flattered smile widening. "Elementary," he dismissed self-consciously. "It's written all over your body, in your clothes and your posture and the way you style your hair, it's just that nobody ever
John nods, frowning. One can almost see the cogs grinding behind the skin of his forehead. "Maybe –"
John quirked a smile at the casual way in which Sherlock scorned the need for beginning actors to audition: he didn't imagine it would have happened very often for him. The way that Ben told it, the detective could have walked into any part in London after only a few performances for people to see what he was like. Usually only relatively unknown actors had to audition, before they were snapped up by a company or the theatres grew to know them well enough to offer them parts without auditioning them.
"Sherlock." Greg approached, and John could see as the poor man jumped when hearing his name called.
The voices sounded agitated, from the tone, they were arguing. Lestrade made to go and check, but at that very moment the sliding doors at the end of the corridor swung open and Mycroft Holmes steps in.
"What the fuck is Sherlock's coat doing here?"
"I'm really sorry, but it’s an order from high up."
Didn't give a damn. Tried desperately.
In the morning, when he woke up, Rosie was sleeping next to him. He did not even remember that he took her from her cot. After a kiss on the baby's head, he left her still asleep and went into the kitchen, leaving the bedroom door half-open in case she woke up.
"Greg, I don't think we need to belabour the point, I don't-"
"So..." said the detective. The peace was over.
"Very good." Dr Lewis took the small torch out of his breast pocket and pointed it at Sherlock's eye to make sure that he was responding well.
He left the spoon in Rosie's matching saucer and picked up the phone.
He had turned his back to Lestrade so couldn't see his face and read his expressions.
"John is that you? What the hell is going on?"
Waiting for time to pass seemed to John an eternity.
"Yes Lestrade?" he replied almost in an excited tone. The idea of leaving the house to help with a murder case basically made him happy. Okay it was a horrible thing to think about, however he would give anything to use his brain for a moment in anything other than trying to get a baby's crying to stop.
"Hey Greg, it's John. Listen... have you heard anything?"
Both men walked at a brisk pace.
"Are you waiting for someone?" the woman asked John and Greg.
John sighed.
I leave my Facebook and my Instagram
They waited. To their right and left were more corridors.
Now it was that look that made him feel guilty.
"You're blaming him? Now he brought it on himself?" interrupted John. Increasingly annoyed.
The torment and guilt were consuming him.
"Highly likely, yes."
They went up to the same ward as the day before. Mycroft and the others hadn't arrived yet and Dr Lewis wasn't there either.
"No I won't take a breath! I don't want to breathe or relax or stop! I've already lost my wife. I don't want to lose Sherlock too! Again! If you're joking at this you're an asshole because I'm not having any fun at all! I've been through this before and I'm not going through it again and if you think I could have even thought about hurting him then shoot me because I'd rather die than have to put up with any more questions like that!" It had been the longest speech he'd given in months, and he felt like he'd run a marathon. He was out of breath and his hands were shaking.
After all that had happened, he couldn't bear to stay there any longer. In that house, with that constant, everlasting presence. He felt as if he'd been stabbed in the back. Like a betrayal.
"Have you heard from him again?" the detective's sudden change of subject had left him surprised, it took him a few seconds to realise what he was talking about.
"Do you know who is on the form as the patient's emergency contact?"
"Hello? Sherlock?“ asked Greg, strange.
Thank you to everyone who has come this far and to those who have decided to start this story. I hope to continue entertaining you in the best possible way! I know that in these difficult times, where hundreds of thousands of people are stuck at home, a little distraction can be useful. I must say that concentrating on writing is helping me a lot. Even a simple kudos or comments left behind is important <3
"Mycroft, I think you're going a bit too far..." Mycroft's anger and threatening finger moved to point at Lestrade.
He helped her back into her seat.
"I'm trying to understand."
"No." he cut it short, hoping it would end there.
"Finally! See, did I tell you or not?"
There were red seams...
Mycroft and Molly were still staring at him with rancour. He supposed that if they could, they would choke him to death only by the strength of their thoughts. Maybe not, but they were definitely trying.
thanks to all the people who have followed me so far, you're special! and thanks also to the people who are helping me, really if you're reading, thank you with all my heart for your patience and support!
John went back to the alley, retrieved his coat and phone, which Agent Ward had made sure to pack carefully, and returned to Lestrade.
Policemen in neon yellow vests stopped his taxi and he got out, having left a twenty-pound note with the driver, who was happy to keep the change. He showed his card, and the good officers let him through without a word. It was a dreary autumn morning, a warm drizzle covered the city. The sky was white, covered with clouds. As always.

He was turned on his stomach so he couldn't see his face.
"I know things are not great between you and him, but sooner or later someone would have come to you for an explanation. Anyway, you can't be the culprit. Your hands are too clean. No scrapes on your knuckles, no scratches to the hand or the arms. These are things that for people like you and me would have immediately jumped out."
"No." Greg replied.
The broken and cut cheekbones had been patched with small transparent suture patches.
It took John a while to make sense and understand the meaning behind those words. No, actually, he didn't understand them at all.
He got down on his knees, next to the victim. He began to move the locks of hair completely covered in blood that had stuck to his forehead.
"I'd say everything is in place here: the internal haematoma is absorbing."
"It's me, Mycroft, your brother. Do you recognise me?"
"I'm sorry." He simply said.
"I can end your career in less than a second, I just need a snap and poof, goodbye pension, goodbye badge. Pray, pray the worst won’t happen." Greg straightened his back and assumed that uncompromising expression he got when one of his people did something stupid or some suspect tried to screw him over.
The car left him right in front of the entrance to St Mary's Hospital.
"I'll be waiting. Hurry up." he didn't even have time to ask Greg who the dead guy was because he'd already ended the conversation. He sighed and stood up letting the chair legs  scrape across the old linoleum floor. Then he leaned over and planted a kiss on Rosie's little head. He loved the smell of her. He could smell her all the time when she fell asleep on his chest.
The nurse made a forced smile.
He dropped everything, much to the policeman’s protest. Wasn't thinking about anything.
If the smell of disinfectants outside is strong, it was even stronger inside, but he was used to that.
Sherlock's head was covered in bandages, held together by a net that completely hid his curly black hair underneath.
"Still can't talk, huh? Look, then why don't you write it down? Any details will be fine."
"But the question remains. - resumed Greg, who wouldn't let go of the speech.
It had taken him forever to spend his lunchtime. Obviously, he hadn't touched any food: just a cup of tea, which had even made him nauseous. Too much anxiety.
John sighed.
"Hey, hey, calm down. You know I have to ask these kinds of questions. Anyway, no I don't think it was you. Obviously."
It was supposed to be a simple apology speech, but it felt like the hardest thing he'd ever done in his life, even harder than going to war.
The eyebrow had a deep cut and there were abrasions on the forehead, probably due to the impact with the asphalt. The cheekbone was an insanely yellow and purple in colour.
John waved him off and watched him walk away towards the car.
Thank you for your extreme patience.
"Are you kidding?" even Lestrade's tone was full of disgust at such viciousness. He bent down so he could get a better look.
The detective had changed his gloves, then turned the garment in his hands, inspecting it.
"Yes, Dr Lewis, to see the patient in 216," Greg interjected.
"Then you may come in." Said the nurse.
"Come on! - Greg spread his arms wide and then let them fall. - What the hell is her problem? I'm a cop with a badge and you practically live with Sherlock! What is she afraid of?"
"I don't know, then why take away his papers?
A man in a white coat came through the corridor on the right, he was in his sixties, with short grey hair, broad shoulders, stubby-fingered hands. A wedding ring on his left ring finger. John labelled him an ordinary man. He wore beige ribbed trousers and dark orthopaedic loafers. He must have been married for several years, given how worn his wedding ring was, and surely he had all his children already grown up, perhaps working around the world. He looked like one of those old-fashioned doctors, who had been in the profession for at least 30 years. Clean. Customary.
"Wait here two minutes while I check," the nurse trailed off.
Damn it, Sherlock. He was all John could think about.
With infinite slowness, he lifted the only eyelid that was still free enough. His eyes were bloodshot, and a black pupil was staring back at him.
Dr Lewis kept telling him to breathe, giving him directions on how to do it; they went on for a few minutes like that before he succeeded, and it was excruciating to listen to.
He put the free one on top of his friend’s hand.
The journey seemed to take hours, instead of a few minutes. They parked in one of the hospital's reserved parking spots. Being a detective inspector at Scotland Yard had its advantages, like always finding a parking space.
That struck him hard.
"It's OK." he gave a few affectionate taps on the old woman's back.
"We-ha... I think maybe we know who the victim is."
John began to feel anger. He couldn't have fallen so low... And Greg to give him rope... But the alternative was much worse.
Many thanks to the people who left me a comment and were kind enough to offer their help! I hope it was worth it and sorry for the wait!
John Watson, had put as much distance as possible between himself and 221b Baker Street. The decision that had prompted him to pack up was very simple: Sherlock Holmes.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I'm telling you it's personal."
The doctor also put the other hand on his and squeezed it.
Sherlock looked at the doctor, then nodded barely.
"No need, John. I've already told you. I don't have anything to investigate at the moment. I understand your eagerness but I wouldn't know what to do with you. Look, I'll call you back tomorrow, OK? We should hear something from the hospital."
The elder Holmes acted as if he didn't exist.
"Well, that wouldn't be bad… If Sherlock doesn't do it, who else will. Sometimes I think I'd like to have his memory, but then I also think it’s not worth the trouble."
He made coffee and drank it. The power of caffeine was enough to take away the headache caused by the alcohol taken the night before.
Greg had come over to talk to the oldest of the Holmes brothers.
"Do you have any idea?" the ex-military doctor shook his head.
John wasted no time.
"We need to look for the people he's been chasing for the last few months. - He concluded.
"But there's the investigation -“ John complained.
Sherlock tried to move but without success, tried to see but could spot no one: he was squinting the only eye he was able to use as if he wanted to focus on his surroundings.
John thought about it.
"You two!"
"It's all right. I'm not going anywhere." John took his hand and saw his iris become shiny. He felt Sherlock's long and lean fingers tightening on his hand.
Before anyone could add anything else, there were sounds of people yelling loudly outside the surgery area.
Jumped on one of the ledges and climbed using all his might. The lid was still lifted, so he only had to lean inside. Peeked into every corner, until he found what looked like dark cloth rolled up.
They had to pull him off almost by force and get him down.
The right side of his face was swollen, his eye was black and the size of a golf ball, and on the side of his lip there was a large split that left his teeth red with blood. The right side was a little better.
Then John decided to get closer. He walked over to the bed on the opposite side.
"Hey Greg, cut it out," John replied, looking at the man the wrong way.
"Agree." took the phone and unlocked it. Hadn't deleted his number from the phone book, but had blocked it, so now unblocked the contact, and pressed the call key.
"Do you understand what I asked you?" Sherlock nodded again.
John was surprised at those words. "Why? I thought you were keeping everyone on the case."
"Where did you find this!" screamed in despair. The rain seemed to be heavier than before. The officer pointed to the dumpster.
Tore the phone out of the poor officer's hand, and trembling, carried it to his ear.
At least she was hungry.
Now everyone in the room was staring at him and John wished he could disappear instantly.
THANKS TO
John snorted out in exasperation.
John shrugged.
"What's going on???"
"Oh, John" she whined.
This explanation was not enough to calm John's anger and indignation.
"It's going to be hard for you to see him after everything that happened."
John was about to walk away without retorting, but something was holding him back. Or rather, someone was. He lowered his eyes. Sherlock's hand was still tight in his.
"Shut up." he growled at the detective.
Dr Lewis reached out a hand towards Mycroft, who gave the poor doctor a nasty look instead of being polite. He was about to lower his hand, which was still in mid-air, but luckily Greg intervened and shook it firmly.
John swallowed it, and it was so painful that tears gathered in the corners of his eyes. No, it couldn't have been.
He stared at himself in the mirror on the cabinet above the sink, hating himself. No, he despised himself. Mycroft was right. If he had stayed with Sherlock, nothing would have happened to him, because he always had his back. Instead, he had abandoned him. The person with whom he had shared everything. Even Mary would have been ashamed of him. He ran his hands over his face and through the hair. Then he turned on the shower and took a long, cold one. At least his brain would remain awake.
Greg was still standing, exactly where he had left it before, and he was confused.
John didn't understand anything.
"If my brother dies... -it was John who was wishing to die at that moment. - I will find you guilty! And I swear, I will spend every moment I have left to live, making your existence a living hell. I'll take away everything you love, you'll have nothing, not even a lousy job as a garbage man. You'll end up hanging out with Sherlock's homeless, misfit friends, and I promise you, I'll make sure no one even gives you one pound."
"Yes, I am."
"If you understand what I'm saying and can see me, please nod your head."
"Are you two in that bad shape?"
"He had a tube down his throat all this time: you have to give him a chance to recover. In fact, I'd say visiting hours are over for today," he said.
Meanwhile John had gone back to attending to the victim.
Molly looked like she wanted to kill him and Mycroft's gaze was no different. The only one who seemed happy to see him was Mrs Hudson, who immediately got up from her chair and went to hug him as tight as she could, sobbing into his shoulder.
Once outside, he took a deep breath and felt cool air fill his lungs.
"What do you mean, he's purposely refusing to talk?" Greg didn't take the information well.
Sherlock's muscles seemed to slightly relax, but he was clearly uncomfortable.
"Sherlock, it's me. Can you hear me?" he asked with apprehension, but Sherlock's expression looked terrified.
"Wow. Are you still that mad at him?"
He picked up the phone and called Lestrade; it took him a while to answer.
"What do you want me to say?"
Heads will roll. That I can guarantee."
Greg huffed.
“Damn it! There’s so much blood. His lung must have been punctured."
"What do you mean, maybe that's why it bothered someone."
if you want you can follow this link to get the full story, I know some people don't care to use the automatic translator. you don't need to be registered, but comments are more than welcome.
"I get it."
"See?" John touched those marks with his fingertips.
"Do you realise what's going on? And you waste your time making assumptions like that about me! Do I look like an animal to you! I left so I wouldn't have to get angry with him again!" by now he was shouting more than talking.
"I think it's his choice. The swelling caused by strangulation has decreased and the airways are open: the glands have gone down. If he doesn't exert himself, he can talk."
Put his ear close to the victims heart. Gasped.
"Ah no, don't give me the silent treatment. Say something."
John couldn't even talk.
Dr Lewis cleared his throat.
Mycroft Holmes approached as if he were marching in a military parade. It meant no good, you could tell from his infuriated expression.
Sherlock Holmes was right in front of them. Lying in bed, almost whiter than the sheets. Cables and pipes were coming out everywhere, various machines were connected to him.
He drank it all and ordered another, and then another.
John Watson did not particularly like running now that he was "retired" from the army, but at those words had literally flown.
"Excuse me, Mr Holmes, but as I have already explained, your brother cannot be moved. He is too weak and even a draft could make him worse and cause him pneumonia or worse. Is that what you want?"
"Come on, don't look at me like that, tell me something. I need to know."
"Easy, easy, like that.
"It's going to be all right," he repeated almost more to himself.
Lestrade was screaming his name but hadn't even noticed, he had thrown himself out of the side avenue of the parking lot, where the cops were doing the surveys and now staring at him as if they had just seen a three-headed dragon.
John let out a slight sigh. He couldn't blame him. Could only try not to provoke Mycroft in any way.
When he got home, he asked the babysitter if she could stay longer and went to bed.
So are the broken ribs. The hematomas on his head have reabsorbed but we still have to make sure that his brain functions are not compromised.
Sherlock grained his eye: a sign that he understood and, more importantly, recognised the voice.
"No chief, I found it in the dumpster outside."
Lestrade handed him a pair of latex gloves. He slipped them on and placed a hand under his body, turning him over.
"I'm John Watson. That is, Dr. John Watson. And detective..." he didn't know why he'd had to add that last bit of clarification.
"You are in the hospital, Sherlock. I am your doctor. Dr Lewis. And you are at St Mary's in London. Do you understand what I'm telling you?" At those words, his eye moved in search of the person the voice was coming from, so the doctor stepped into a spot where he could be seen.
"Fuck!" he jumped to his feet so fast that Lestrade had dropped everything in his hand and was about to pull out his gun.
A special thank you to my beta and translate. thanks to you now fortunately these chapters will be better!
"John I said enough. Take a breath."
He couldn't get back on his feet after what she'd told him. And Sherlock must have got the message because he hadn't been seen or heard from again.
"Come on, I know you remember. I need it, I can settle for a little for now..."
A whole week had passed and John thought he was going crazy. He hadn't received any calls from the hospital or Greg. He lay awake at night. Sifting through everything he could remember about the crime scene, and Sherlock... Yeah, Sherlock.
"Ah, yes, right, the ambulance. What about before?”, Greg was going to insist until he got a satisfactory answer. “I mean before the ambulance… Like… The night before. Do you remember what you did?"
"What? What do you mean actually dead?. He had no pulse!"
And Sherlock was there, looking at him, or rather staring at him with his still black and red-circled iris.
"Hey, Sherlock. You look good today." Greg stepped forward, approaching the bed.
"It's normal, he had some bad head injuries. He might not recognise you, at least for a while. We have decreased the internal haematomas, but it will take some time." the doctor said.
Greg asked him if he wanted a ride, but he shook his head.
"Are you trying to provoke me or something?"
"I promise I'll be back this afternoon."
"I think they tried to strangle him."
Much love
After a while, a nurse dressed in white, pushing a cart, came in and entered Sherlock's room. She came out after about ten minutes.
His hair was smeared with blood and stuck together, at least one head wound was visible. What must have been a shirt of some shade of blue was torn in several places, underneath there were other marks, it was all a mess of bruises, swelling, and bleeding wounds.
"I'm here. Can you see me?"
thank you for leaving a comment! <3
Mycroft arrived at that moment, followed by Molly and Mrs Hudson.
Lately, however, she had regained her appetite, slept through the night and the crying had dropped dramatically. A sign that things were getting better. They were going to get better. They had to get better, for each other. Of course it didn't mean forgetting Mary, he would always talk to her about her mother, he was sure of that. But now they had to make another life for themselves, away from those who endangered them.
Everything else was covered so he couldn't quantify the damage, but he guessed it wasn't any better.
"Please."
Greg grabbed his friend by the shoulder and shook him hard, forcing him to look at him.
"We have to intubate him and he has a collapsed lung, we drained him before he choked on his own blood."
"Well we don't know much yet, we need an autopsy to know. But I think they beat him to death." Greg's tone was almost resigned, as if the violence he had to deal with every day wasn't enough to make him realise that the world was an evil place.
Very slowly that same eyelid lifted. The poor eye was still darkened by the broken blood vessels, and it seemed as if they had never been that clear blue eyes that John remembered.
ran in the direction of the flashing lights. The ambulance was still there.
"Hard to say with his face in this condition, but I'd say... mid-thirties. Give or take a year."
With his head down, he walked along the empty pavement.
"Any ID?" Greg shook his head.
Shit... He didn't mean it that way. He wasn't mad at him. Not like before. He didn't answer, though.
John thought he could easily pass for a corpse if it wasn't for the chest rising and lowering slowly and the sound of the machine confirming with each beep that his heart was still beating in his chest.
Dr Lewis checked Sherlock's throat and neck.
John almost cried for relief at those words but choked it all back.
"No Ward, the Queen! "
"Give him time and he'll tell you everything."
Greg didn't tell him they were coming, but he should have thought it of himself. It was normal that they were there.
They had to pull him up on his back, and now that he was without tubes, he was fumbling breathlessly like a fish pulled out of the water and left on the quay to struggle.
"Yes, we heard." replied Greg.
Sherlock moved finally his arm and hand, brought it to his throat, touching the bandages with his fingertips, then up to his chin and his lips. His expression changed. It looked as if something was choking him: he was trying to get the breathing tube out.
After a few more minutes, Sherlock’s breath seemed to have become regular, although the doctor’s experienced ears could hear gasps every time he inhaled.
He really felt like he was abandoning him every time he left, just as he abandoned him a year ago.
"Fuck... What's going on with, John? John look at me."
He couldn't even look him in the face after Mary's death. And yes, he had even hated him for a while.
I have made some changes and corrections to chapter one, it should now be fine and understandable!
Greg signalled to follow him. John stared at him confused: Dr Lewis had already gone inside with Mycroft, but the detective kept signalling to move, so he followed in.
“Excuse me Mr. Holmes," Dr. Lewis interrupted, in a low, intimidated tone.
Now there was a new stain of fresh blood along with the old one.
He was dressed to the nines, a smart tailored suit, shiny new shoes, a dark blue trench-coat over his jacket and an embroidered fine wool scarf.
John took a deep breath.
If the rest was a mess, his face was virtually unrecognisable.
Sherlock shook his head imperceptibly.
He climbed into the back seats without uttering a word, not even a "good morning" in the direction of the driver, whom he did not even know.
"Police is investigating, and I would like to interview the patient if you don't mind." Greg replied.
Rosie squeaked excitedly at those words. Sometimes John was convinced she understood him even though she was only a few months old. Absurd.
https://efpfanfic.net/viewstory.php?sid=3966840
Sherlock opened his good eye and scrutinized him from head to toe. There was no expression on his face, his lips were stretched in a straight line.
"I'm sorry." he said again and released himself from his grip.
"So can we still get in? I am a policeman, and he's a doctor." He pointed to John, who gave the nurse a forced smile. She seemed to think about it.
This whole situation was absurd. Sherlock needed a quiet, stress-free place, while the exact opposite was happening.
The rain and moisture had soaked in his bones. He hated the rain.
"What are you still doing here!" shouted.
"You can't throw me out, I'm the police and I'm doing my job."
And Greg knew very well where it came from.
John gave him a dirty look to which the detective replied with a smirk. Knew he was hitting in the right places. Bastard.
Greg blinked confused.
I also have some ideas floating around in my head about possible future spin off chapters for when this main story is over! so work goes on!
Lestrade ended the call. And John was left alone with his thoughts again.
The left eye had been covered by a large square patch, while the right one was a yellowish colour and had deep marks under the lower eyelid.
Sherlock tried again to move his fingers.
He called his attention with a “Hey Greg" and raised a waving hand. The detective looked up from his notebook and signalled for him to come closer.
"Alright." John felt frustrated and wanted to cry in anger, but he couldn't help it.
"Don't think I won’t hold you responsible!" he snarled through his teeth, then turned his gaze to John, who flattened himself against the wall, wishing he would disappear.
https://www.instagram.com/lady_norin/
Of course he wasn't, he was used to it by now, in fact he almost felt a sort of insane pleasure in putting himself in mortal danger. But he knew what he was doing. He made decisions for himself. Before.
"What's up, anything new?"
John found Greg waiting for him at the reception desk. This time, they did not enter the surgery department but took the lift. They went up to the second floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dr Lewis put the needle cap back on the syringe and placed it on the cart, then he turned around to check the equipment and the IV. John had to move over to let him pass and go talk to the others in the room.
John stared him straight in the eye. Lestrade wasn't a stupid man. He understood right away.
hey, I'm really sorry for the very long wait, as always translation times are very long, not because I abandoned this story. I wish I could update even several times a week, but these are the times, plus I hope that at least now it's a good writing compared especially to the first two chapters which at this point are horribly translated , I did it this job
"You." he hissed, pointing a finger at him.
"I'm Dr. Lewis," he extended his hand, and John shook it.
"Visiting hours are over. Come back this afternoon when you’re calmer."
John grimaced but continued to examine the victim.
"I have to get back to the operating theatre, I suggest you go home, I'll call you when there's any news." and with an impassive face he disappeared down the corridor he had come from.
It had been a difficult time for everyone, and Rosie had also felt the effects. Being only a few months old didn't stop her from missing her mother.
hi everyone! sorry for the wait! in the future i hope to be able to post at least twice a month! i know it can be boring to have to wait so long, i'll try to organize myself somehow.
Sorry it took so long! Above all, I apologise for not having published in December. With the holidays in the middle, I didn't get organised in time and so I didn't make it, but I didn't forget this story! In fact, the writing is going very well, I'm on chapter 14!
Memories of their last encounter were creating his personal hell. In fact, he was sure that was what hell looked like. He was being punished for the horrible way he had treated his best friend. But if it really was his punishment, why was Sherlock the one who fared worse?
"No, no that's alright, I'm worried too and I'm not getting anything out of it here."
Mycroft, for his part, gave everyone present a murderous look and turned on his heel, leaving the hospital exactly as he had entered it.
"Wait... are you accusing me of something??? Do you think I'm the one who did this to him???”
"All right." the detective replied.
"What the hell? I can't leave without any answers! He can't talk but maybe he can write!" complained Greg.
"Fine, I think. The nurse said she gave him antibiotics and painkillers.” this time it was John who answered.
The other voice answered.
John didn't decide whether he would get drunk or not. After all, he didn't mind having his mind clouded for a few hours, but on the other hand, he would have to... go back to the hospital the next day. To Sherlock...
"But you know..."
Julien brushed some imaginary dirt from the front of his shirt. "That's quite all right – Molly, did I hear?" he interjected. She turned back to him quickly, like a jumpy rabbit who didn't know which way to look. He extended a delicate hand. "I am Julien."
Sherlock hitches the staff up in his hands and walks a few metres back down the beach. "Here," he begins, drawing a line across John's footprint path. "You were born. You had a childhood full of love. Your parents loved you and cared about you. You and Harry hated each other, but it was
I'd considered and accounted for the fact that I might react, that I might want more contact, but not like that; my reaction to such a small, simple and unhygienic point of contact was so unexpectedly strong that it scared me, and breaking it off and avoiding a repeat was the natural reaction.
"Do you want to –"
Sherlock still imagined it happening like that, imagined – to help him fall asleep after the disappointment of coming down from the high to an empty room – that John would climb into bed with him, wrap his arms around him and spoon him with his lips underneath Sherlock's ear to whisper things like
Sherlock squeezed him tighter. "I promise," he replied. "Everything I need, I can get from you. We've proven that today." He paused to kiss John's neck gently. "I love you, John."
and then at Stamford, fishing for an introduction.
The shadows had begun to fluctuate, shifting around like the dappling of sunlight through trees on the ground, creeping up the walls. At the renewed sound of the Doctor's voice, the movements became more frantic, more hurried. "A part of your swarm has attached itself to a friend of mine," the Doctor continued, but broke off abruptly at the frenzy from the swarm below.
Sherlock!" he hisses, pulling at the detective's arm. Sherlock doesn't move. It's as if there are memories of his own burning in the grate, and he can't decide whether he wants to dive in and save them or let them burn.
It hadn't been until dinner that he'd realised what one of those potential uses might be. John had been facing away from him, laughing with James Potter about something to do with the recent Quidditch match between Hufflepuff and Slytherin that had meant something important for Gryffindor's chances in the Cup, and Sherlock – as had become customary when John was not looking at him – was staring at the back of his head and trying not to let Potter see quite how badly he was in love with the Keeper.
from the other side of the room, a muffled curse, and then a flashlight flickered to life. "Often enough that there are always flashlights in the basements, I suppose," Marchbanks said from behind it. "I don't really know. I don't come down here often."
from trying to catch the murderer!"
"What about your parents?" John felt something itch at his skin like a chill without temperature. He held back a shudder as Jim repeated the casual shoulder-movement.
Then he froze, his breath caught and halted in his chest, and his heartbeat stuttered and then started to race in panic.
Sherlock's gasps gave way to helpless pants as he writhed under the hologram-John's hands and lips, the latter having given up on his own pleasure for the moment to focus on the First Officer's, trailing kisses down his stomach and finally pressing a chaste peck of his lips onto the tip of Sherlock's erection, making him shudder.
Sherlock laughed weakly. "Never better," he assured him. "I happen to have an excellent doctor."
"No," I say stubbornly, feeling my lower lip pooch without permission. Everything seems to be crashing down around my ears; if he gets the book off me and sees the writing, he'll know it's his and he won't understand my need to keep something of him around, he'll assume I'm just making trouble for the sake of being difficult. Panic catches in my throat.
Sherlock smiled tightly at Tom's apologetic expression. "Well, that clears that up," he said cheerfully.
about the whole thing worried him. He was handling it almost as though… almost as though he'd been
John grinned. "Do you?" he asked, though he had no doubt.
else?"
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
"Probably not," the Doctor said, eyeing the display window looking onto the forest. "But I don't think you can be too careful. Best to keep everyone out. I'll give you the direct line to the TARDIS. If you ever have any problems with them again, call me."
"I can't blame you, I suppose." The two of them watch as Sherlock runs around the same tree three times, looking more and more crazed by the minute, obviously on the brink of some major discovery. John chuckles. "Does he feel the same?"
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
Sherlock kicked him under the counter, and John shut up quickly. "I believe it is, yes," the jeweller said proudly. "Anne Boleyn. She was Her Majesty's mother, after all, despite her execution."

John frowns. "Try what again? The running leap from the door to the bed? You're welcome to try anytime I'm not
"Why have you been arrested?" he asks without ceremony.
John thinks, a smirk forming on his face as he regards his flatmate. "Yeah, we'll come," he says happily. "If it's no trouble, thanks, Hannah."
Sherlock looked at Hannah and Marchbanks. "We're fine, except that the lights have died. They came on at first and then they sort of flickered and went out – but we found a torch, so we can still see to some extent. It'll just take a bit longer to –"
, hold on, we need…"
John smiled at Donovan as she put down the child she was holding. He didn't miss the piles of fresh vegetables on the kitchen counter; he wondered how often the two of them visited this house and, not for the first time, what it was that Lestrade actually
Bradley clapped him on the back so hard his face almost hit the table. "You know us," he said cheerfully. John sent him a silent
"Jesu,
tonight. Do you think he'll like it?"
Then, astonishingly, he chuckled.
"You two okay?" Kirsty called back, raising an eyebrow and making it quite plain that she didn't really care whether they were okay or not.
Sherlock nodded; John wondered for the first time where Billy and his gang actually lived. "Go and find Constable Lestrade," he ordered. "Tell him to meet us at the house. He can bring Donovan if he must. By the time you get there we ought to be back as well. "
He almost walked into Sherlock as he finally left the stage, standing close to the door and fidgeting slightly. "Sherlock," he hissed as he recovered his balance without falling back out of the door.
John coughs. "Okay, you're overdoing it now," he says quietly, patting Sherlock's knee. Lestrade stares at them for a while. "Sorry, Inspector, do continue."
But the other man stood his ground, looking down his prominent nose at the detective. "No, it isn't," he maintained. "Her Majesty's interest in this case is irrelevant to its conclusion. It will only distract you from finding her."
done while she was with us, which it looks like it was."
There were more windows on the next level, and plush rugs in rich reds stretching over the floor and squishing pleasantly under John's shoes. A few of the doors along the corridor stood open, revealing bookshelves and science laboratories and what looked like a medical exam room.
Panicking properly now, I snatch it away from him. "Because it's
Sherlock gives him the usual condescending look. "Not absolute, Lestrade. I told Miss Turner the truth, it wasn't McCarthy. Come on, it looks like rain."
"My Lord had no complaints about my service, and so always treated me well," the man replied, as though the suggestion that Lord Brackenstall might have treated him with the same dismissive violence as he apparently treated his wife was offensive.
He looks thoroughly confused. "You think this was done
"So, Jim, you're what, fifth-form? Did you know John before you came to Islington?"
The taller man threw a rich purple waistcoat across the room with another growl of frustration. "I'm going to be late," he said, finally lifting a wad of papers high with a
The play dragged on like an applecart with a loose wheel, but eventually John found himself in the wing, watching Ben deliver his final monologue. To his credit, the young Goodfellow had given one of the best performances John had seen from him, despite the distraction of the rest of the fairies. John couldn't help but think that Sherlock's presence in the audience had spurred him on; the detective had watched attentively as the two of them tripped and stumbled around each other, and John was a little embarrassed that his new friend had watched
drew definite attention from the entire hall. John cringed.
"But there shouldn't
"I've done it before, you know," the Doctor said finally, his fingers tapping a tarantella on the tabletop. "I know what you're going through. A while back I got into a bit of a mess with a religious group called the Silence – they – well, long story short the only way to get out of it was to fake my own death, right in front of my best friends." He looked slightly wistful for a moment. "So I ran. I ran, and I kept myself busy, and I didn't look back. I consoled myself with feeling wretched by telling myself they were better off without me."
Sherlock scrambled to obey, climbing onto his bed on all fours, turning to throw John a terribly clichéd provocative look over his shoulder. The doctor snorted. "Don't tease," he commanded, delivering a sharp slap to Sherlock's rear that was dulled by the fabric of his trousers. No-one had ever tried to hit Sherlock in a sexual way before and he had never understood the point of pain-play. He wondered suddenly whether John, with his hitherto unexpected knowledge of BDSM techniques, might be able to explain it to him. "On your back," John continued. "Hands above your head. Keep your eyes on me."
John doesn't hear what he says next, but it makes Alice St. Claire's mouth drop open in surprise and then it's the woman who turns and flees, leaving Sherlock to slowly, almost
Heat swept through him in waves like a fever, making him dizzy; he was pressed so tightly against Sherlock that he couldn't breathe and it still wasn't close enough. He knew his own body well enough to know that his lips would bruise in the morning from how desperately they were pressing themselves together, and couldn't help but hope that the younger man's pale skin would also be red and sensitive, that every time he formed words he would be reminded of this moment. He forgot about Molly, forgot about their stupid argument, forgot about everything except how badly he had wanted this for how long, how many inappropriate daydreams and lingering glances had led them there and how incredible it felt now that they had reached the revelation.
Sherlock blinks a few more times, glancing up at the man standing in the doorway. "It… seems so," he says finally. After another minute's pause he whips out his phone and starts walking. "Come on, John," he tosses over his shoulder.
John lifted an eyebrow; Sherlock had almost sounded wistful. "What are the things that are?" he asked, wondering if he was pushing it.
My father had a daughter loved a man,
her jewellery?" he asked, stepping intently closer to the butler.
She's right, of course. I need to apologise for the things I said to John, to let him know that I wasn't as angry as I might have sounded and that I

right that it couldn't be chance. She
The undertaker was a grubby little man with a round, bald head and startlingly blue eyes; he blinked at them from behind the counter as Sherlock flung open the shop door with his usual dramatism. For a moment it looked as though he had been struck dumb; then his face rearranged itself into an obsequious smile as he took in the richness of Sherlock's dress. "How can I help you, gentlemen?" he asked slimily.
to imagine John doing it, finding someone good-looking who was willing to indulge a kink that sent others running, so eager to be affectionate that he would trust them without knowing more about them than their first name. He wasn't willing to examine the flicker of jealous anger that the thought sparked in him. John just
"You're not
"The name is Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street." In keeping with his usual brevity, despite his hitherto dormant nerves screaming at him, he clicked out an insouciant wink and waved at Stamford on his way out. "Afternoon!"
They repositioned themselves, Sherlock's cock bobbing endearingly against his stomach as he wriggled up the bed. John wanted to take it in his mouth, but Sherlock was reaching for him, pulling their mouths together, and their groins realigned so neatly that the idea went out of his head in favour of frotting against him, every inch of Sherlock's skin hot and slick against his. "Oh, God," John moaned, trying to lever himself up onto his elbows but not wanting to lose the heat of Sherlock's chest against his own. "Oh, God, where's my wand, hang on…"
"What do you want?" Sherlock snapped. John was slightly gratified to see a flush high on his friend's cheekbones and a thoroughly displeased downturn at the corners of his mouth.
Did you actually have a reason for calling, or did you just want someone awake to talk to?"
even though he'd never wanted anyone before, and there had been something almost
He tries not to pout, then realises Sherlock is out of the room anyway, and lets his lips fall into the expression. "I'm good for more than the occasional ejaculation of 'brilliant!', you know," he ventures.
Molly's face fell. It had been months since they had last lost a crew member on a landing expedition. "Very good, sir," she said softly instead, and turned to leave.
"So are you going on Saturday?"
he asked impatiently. He understood how nothing else, no hobbies or pursuits seemed nearly as interesting as talking about his imagined lover. What could he possibly hunt that would bring him the same joy as Sherlock's shy smile?
Bill nodded again. "Yeah," he repeated.
"Oh, well, that sounds far more interesting than mine. I just moped around home," she replied brightly. "Well, I should probably head off – my Classics class is on the top floor of the other building. It was nice talking to you, John!"
. I couldn't believe it when they came up with a course called
John gasped as though he had not been expecting to hear his own name and folded into Sherlock, shuddering and
Theatrically, Carl took his hand off the younger boy's arm, leaving him to slip slightly down the wall before he regained his balance and tugged at his shirt coolly to straighten it. John rewarded the bigger boy with a bright smile as he sauntered off, making sure to bump shoulders painfully with him on the way.
, Sherlock?"
The Constable didn't look surprised to be cut off so rudely, merely glancing at John in mild interest before answering. "We came back for a routine follow-up and Lady Brackenstall had disappeared. When we interviewed the butler, he told us that immediately after her husband's death, Lady Brackenstall gave all the servants the day off, and none of them have seen her since – even when she dismissed them, she'd locked herself in her bedchamber. I took a missing persons report, and -"
he insisted. The man executed a cursory bow and swept offstage, throwing an incredibly judgmental look over his shoulder at the two of them. The detective had drawn one arm up to clasp the other elbow over his chest, a gesture that made him look unexpectedly vulnerable. John's chest twinged at the sight of him, and he instinctively rushed forwards to close the gap between them. A bystander cleared his throat gently, and it hit him like a slap to the face. It hadn't really occurred to John that there would be other people on stage while they did this scene, their most intimate together. Come to think of it, the last time the two of them had run it, it had barely occurred to him that they would be performing to an audience. He had been so caught up in the sheer pleasure of
" John replied, gesturing towards the still-sleeping Bottom with donkey's head affixed. Sherlock shuddered and hugged John tighter, as though to paint over the memories of Bottom with ones of Oberon.
He kissed him again just to cement the knowledge in his head: Viola and Cesario was a confusing enough duality by this point that the audience wouldn't even know whether they were supposed to accept this relationship or not, but they
he snarled back.
The landlady shrugged and shook her head;

The umbrella continued to swing idly closer to the wood of the doorway, as though Mycroft was playing a game with himself to see how close he could get it before it made a noise. "

he continued, in the same almost uncannily quiet tone.
"Have you heard of the Vashta Nerada, Mr Fitzherbert?" the lanky alien asked, leaning back in order to read the manager's name from the block in front of his desk. "They're flesh-eating creatures that hatch from trees, and you've managed to import an entire swarm of them from Earth in your oxygen forest. You need to stop people from going in there or more people are going to die."
John…
To John's surprise, the room they're led to in Downing Street is full of people in suits idly conversing with each other over tea, coffee, and a delightful-looking selection of biscuits. Sherlock looks as though he can't think of anything he'd like
John tries not to be hurt by the sharp dismissal. "You're welcome," he says softly. The taller man either doesn't hear him, or pretends he doesn't.
Will called his name from across the bar, beckoning to the two of them. He now had one arm around Ben and the other around his drink; John grinned and lifted a hand in acknowledgement. "We should go and sit with them," he said reluctantly. He'd been rather enjoying having Sherlock more or less to himself, his lips slightly loosened by the ale. "Will probably wants them to see how great we are." The detective smiled ruefully, so John lifted his mug in a final toast. "To showing off," he said brightly.
John shifted uncomfortably at the use of his Christian name as Sherlock narrowed his grey-green eyes at him. "I have to focus on the play, Master Holmes, or I will be out of a job," he said finally. Sherlock smirked at his brother as though in triumph.
with them, it would prevent them from rehearsing together the way they had planned. "No," Sherlock said firmly, causing John to look up in surprise. "I can't go to Sussex now. I've just committed to another play."
John freezes. The kiss only lasts for a moment but it sends a wave of something icy crashing down his spine, lighting his whole body like the Vegas strip before Sherlock pulls away, still smiling softly.
drift away and the detective's fingers start to loosen their death-grip on John's leg beneath the table. Sherlock's exhale is blatantly loud in the new bubble of quiet between them. "How much longer do we have to stay before we can leave politely?" the detective asks.
Called
John stares after him, mouth open. What was that? Is Sherlock
Mycroft shook his head helplessly. "We dismissed him," he replied, sounding horrified. "One indiscretion too many. Her Majesty wanted to have him executed, but…" he closed his eyes reluctantly. "I persuaded her that he may be useful in the future."
John hummed agreement. "I've never really understood the appeal of that approach to domination myself. Not that I'm claiming to be an expert, but I had a girlfriend who liked it once and it really didn't work between us."
me," Sherlock backtracked, in a tone of voice that suggested the exact opposite, slowing his steps so that John didn't have to trot to keep up and turning to look at him. "You just don't know enough about this kind of work to make the claims that you were making with Lestrade."
"Our next movie-marathon," John answers, picking up the bag and tossing it at Sherlock for easy access. The detective pours out the four films onto his lap, sitting up and putting his feet up on John's knees.

Sherlock's eyes flickered up to John, his engrossed frown returning. "Then we had better join him," he replied, fishing a coin out of his pocket once more. "Thank you, Billy. Coming, John?"
In his defence, he was so tired that first day that most of it didn't even register. In fact, he's pretty sure it first happened the day before that one, and he hadn't noticed over the slight buzzing noise in his ears and the distinct feeling that Sherlock's latest taxidermy experiment had gone wrong and the detective had accidentally stuffed
Not that the French boy noticed. He was busy.
"Because there's
he began, and Sherlock pushed himself away from the desk eagerly.
Sherlock snorted. "Of course not," he said dismissively, earning himself a reprimanding look from his brother. "He didn't strike me as stupid enough to come and see the man who's investigating a crime he was responsible for. And his concern for Lady Brackenstall was genuine. I'm more worried about the couple that she left with." Lestrade frowned. "I assume you got their name?"
"This is terribly forward of me, and I
John laughed, wondering whether Robert, who put out the quarto announcements, had been there to see Sherlock's double-take. He knew most actors by name and most likely would have laughed to see the detective's reaction to Will Shakespeare's last-minute name change. "I never said it, but I agreed with you," he admitted. "He could probably tell. I don't want people to think it's just
He looked up in surprise, having almost forgotten himself that the point of this conversation had been to convince Cesario to woo someone else on his behalf.
Molly Hooper had always had a bit of a hopeless crush on the First Officer: hopeless because Sherlock knew about it and had never once acknowledged it beyond the occasional winning smile when he asked her to do something. John knew that it wasn't Vulcan to entertain ideas of romance, but he wasn't sure that Sherlock was a sexual being at all; he'd never asked, quite naturally, and although being the Chief Medical Officer meant he knew that the First Officer possessed working and surprisingly human sexual organs, it was entirely possible that he hadn't inherited any kind of libido to go along with them.
Sitting beside one of the empty seats was a boy Sherlock had never seen before, smiling softly at him. His expression was almost eerily calm and collected compared to the riot of pubescence around them; Sherlock's eyes automatically narrowed as he looked the stranger up and down. He was very distinctly French, upright and poised, immaculately dressed with fastidious care – gay, but comfortably so. He met Sherlock's gaze steadily from vivid green eyes, his plush, sculpted lips curving up in a slight smile. The bones of his face stuck out elegantly, his jaw square and his cheekbones so sharp as to be almost serrated. Sherlock swallowed. How did the boy know his name?
Sherlock Holmes?" he repeated stupidly. Surely there couldn't be more than one Sherlock Holmes in London. He took the proffered hand and shook it eagerly. "John Watson, Lord Chamberlain's Men. I must admit this isn't how I expected to meet you."
Just when I'd discovered how comforting it was to be beside him while he slept and finally managed to express in conversational terms how much I admire him – I suppose it was only natural for him to take that as a sign that he should take things further, especially when he's been almost completely focussed on 'seducing' me for so long.
Mycroft, too, seems to grow impatient. "The matter is easily cleared, Robert," he says calmly. "Go and fetch the box, and check."
to understand her case instead of going straight to Mycroft and his people to tell the Queen that she's safe."
The chef arrived about ten minutes ago, quietly tipping the rice onto the hot-plate and tossing it around with his spatula. Everyone else ignores him, but when he looks my way I give him a tight smile. This is probably why he chooses me as his first victim and I will never make eye contact with a chef again.
John's stomach was in his throat, tearing itself to pieces with worry. If Sherlock was correct about the dimensions of the coffin - which surely he must be, as the longer John considered it the more incredible it seemed that the detective could have missed it in the moment - then it was very likely they were already too late, and the longer it took them to get back to the coffin made the odds yet longer. After what had transpired the previous day they could hardly barge back into the house immediately. Even if Sherlock was correct they could still be in legal trouble if the case against Peters went to trial. It seemed so selfish that they had lain there for so long, dozing in and out of peaceful sleep while a woman's life hung in the balance.
you want from me?"
"Yes, well. One look at that carpet and I knew someone had been in here," Lestrade says severely. I look at John out of the corner of my eye in time to share a knowing smirk with him. "Sorry to have wasted your time, Sherlock," he adds, smiling apologetically at me.
He took a deep breath as though calming himself down, then straightened defiantly.
although it must have been close - John fully expected Will, at least, to interrupt them before they finished the scene, but Sherlock had insisted on beginning it and John had been excited enough about it to go along.

John felt himself flush. "Right. Um." He cast around the room before lighting on the detective once more, and the objects he held in his hand. "The curtain fringe," he said hesitantly. "There must be other things in the room they could have tied her up with that wouldn't make such a big noise as pulling the curtains down, surely. That's just… showing off."
John shook his head. "They can all be explained away - not everything can be perfect, Sherlock."
" he cried, picking up the mouse and scrolling frantically through the code. "
"Okay," John said quickly, relieved. "We could meet… say, Saturday, 11 o'clock, at… where's good for you?"
John laughed and crawled his way back up his lover's body until their noses were almost touching. Sherlock's hand wrapped itself firmly around the back of John's neck to pull their lips together again, drowning him in the kiss and the taste of both of them combined. His other long-fingered hand stroked its way down to John's bare behind and squeezed, pulling them together and
"You…" John stops for a moment to process this. "You learned the Imperial March for my birthday?" Sherlock shrugs. "That's… that's really sweet, Sherlock."
"To what would you be referring, Margaret?" he asked, carefully keeping his voice over-the-top cheerful. She rolled her eyes and left without elaborating. He pulled a face at her retreating back.
he assured him, stepping forward once more, at once soft and earnest.
The corner of the Doctor's mouth turned up as he looked at the evidently efficient secretary, like he reminded him of someone. Fitzherbert looked unimpressed. "I want you to take this man down to the basement to look at the water systems that feed the oxyforests. Take a security team down with you, make sure he doesn't touch anything. I still don't trust him."
The door behind them banged open with all the theatrics that could only be attributed to a teacher; sure enough, with a world-weary grunt, the flabby, sweaty shape of Mr Gibbon waltzed into the room, brandishing a spiral-bound exercise book and crushing the arms of students leaning beyond the narrow confines of their desks. Sherlock pressed slightly closer to Julien de Richelieu to avoid being bulldozed; the French student chuckled lightly.
, perhaps he and Holmes ought to discover what they were like together before they saw the script and had to make serious decisions.
Sherlock stopped them when Billy indicated they had reached the street, cutting himself off in the middle of another biting insult to Lestrade. "Billy, Elizabeth, you two wait one on each side of the street. Make sure you're not visible from the door."
Our belongings, the evidence of how perfectly we work together,

John's hand got caught in Sherlock's hair and pulled, the doctor's hips rocking up against Sherlock's so that he could feel the stirring of his groin, and then suddenly there
Also, I'd just like to point out that while Joseph Grieg was originally a representation of my darling flatmate, I am in no way attempting to imply that the man I have devoted so much of my life to takes advantage of/sleeps with his underage students. Or even the of-age ones. Not even the really gorgeous ones like Sherlock. He apologises.
The detective shrugged lightly, looking away again. "It didn't even occur to me not to go for that entire afternoon, and then… a friend of mine laughed at you wanting to meet me, like there was no chance that I
