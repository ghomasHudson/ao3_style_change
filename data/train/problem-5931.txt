But as Bucky thought of Tony, other more hidden desires threatened to surface. When he thought of how protective Tony was or how he took care of them. How he could be so commanding at times. When he called them boys…
Howard had gotten up from the workbench. “What are you doing here?” He’d repeated. “I heard you were nearly killed after being hit by a truck. Then I heard you were at home recovering.”
“You just performed for them,” she said, looking taken aback, “or what was left of them. The 107th was attacked weeks ago. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against them and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the 107th. The rest were killed or captured. It’s been quite the mess in the aftermath. Troubling reports…I’m sorry about your friend.”
Tony and the boys are finally getting to the historical parts of history. The changes this brings will be felt by all of them. In the present Steve tries to talk Bucky down after his episode, and he receives help from an unexpected source.
Steve smiled and grabbed the lock. Tony watched as it crumpled in Steve’s hand like aluminum foil. “Ready?”
“You made him a better person,” Bucky said, breaking the silence of the kitchen. The only other sound was the sizzling of bacon and the stirring of the waffle batter Steve was making.
He opened his eyes and saw the man laying next to him, sleeping peacefully. His brown hair was disheveled, but Bucky was certain his looked worse after…God, he’d had sex with Tony, amazing sex. Which only goes to show that sometimes Steve was wrong. He had taken a huge chance in kissing Tony, but it had paid off. He had thought he could keep his feelings to himself, but he soon realized he wouldn’t be able to keep up the charade much longer.
And Bucky remembered. Steve had been the first to call him Bucky not long after they’d met in grade school. He actually
Bucky moaned as he felt the hand around him squeeze tighter, and his eyes rolled back as he choked. “Ah, yes!”
Bucky nodded happily at the thought. A warm bath was something he hadn’t had in months, since he’d left for war really, and it was usually part of the pampering Tony and Steve gave him on special occasions. As Tony and Steve pulled away, Bucky saw something pass between the two of them like an unspoken agreement, but he figured he’d learn about it soon enough.
The soldiers lunged, but they weren’t fast enough. Steve’s use of his shield along with his kicks were lightning fast. The HYDRA soldiers tried to deflect with their clubs as Steve knocked them around like ragdolls before throwing them out the back of the truck.
“Your mine, Tony. This is mine.” He said as Tony felt the head of his dick push against his hole. Steve applied some more pressure until he breached the ring of muscle and entered him. He didn’t stop his thrust as he continued in one long, slow slide into him.
The door closed behind Steve’s retreating figure, leaving Tony alone with nothing but his thoughts, and that did nothing to comfort him. He ran over everything that had happened since he’d woken up…Was it really just over a half-hour ago? The stress made it seem much longer than that. He didn’t even want to think of the stress Steve and Bucky had been dealing with these past few days. He couldn’t. It would only add too much to what he was already feeling.
“Do you really think I would have been able to stop him?” Steve asked seriously because he had tried to talk Tony out of it.
Bucky blew out a breath before saying, “Yes, when I first got to Europe. Thankfully, we took a boat to cross the channel the first time. It took longer to move the grunts that way, but it was easier than arranging air travel. Guess that means we’re important now if we’re flying,” Bucky said bitterly.
“Like him? Ehh…” Tony wobbled his hand back and forth, “But yeah, I trust him. He’s saved the world a couple times. He’s earned it.”
Steve wasn’t familiar with the term, but the description sounded right enough. Steve got off on every moan Bucky made. It was a heady feeling knowing he could give him pleasure like that, and sharing that with Tony? Listening to the things Tony said as he’d softly dominated Bucky made Steve just as aroused as when he said those things himself.
Steve sighed. “I don’t think he’s ever had to use it. All the times he and his gang have gone after people, they usually just rough ‘em up and leave. I don’t think they expected Tony to kick their asses.” And he had. It had been surreal to watch.
After what felt like an eternity, Bucky finally spoke, and he heard the emptiness of his voice. “I’m not sure if I’m worth all this, Steve.”
“This is to help you, and no one here will ever punish you for not understanding something or saying no to something. I promised Steve that I would help,” Stark looked to Steve before he met its eyes again, “but not if this overwhelms you. If you allow it, I’m going to try to work quickly and help with some of this pain today. If you want me to stop, tell me, that’s alright and I will stop.”
He’d also accepted that he would be alone and hoped that with enough work, his love for Steve and Bucky would shift to a more appropriate form of affection. He couldn’t risk otherwise.
This wasn’t the tingly, almost useless feeling of oxygen deprivation. It was a cold numbness that sometimes spiked to a painful intensity before eventually going back to numb, and it wouldn’t go away. Tony knew that it was somehow tied to Bucky. It was the only thing that made sense. In the four years that Tony has been here, this has never happened. Not once. Suddenly, just when Tony knew it was time that Bucky was due to be tortured and experimented on, his cursed hand decides to start acting up?
“I get why Steve hates bullies so damn much. You’re pathetic. Beating on someone half your size just because you can, so you can feel powerful.” Tony’s grip tightened. “Do you feel powerful now?”
“Actually,” Tony said, voice hardening, “you can’t treat me without my consent. I do not consent to this. I am of sound mind, and despite what you are trying to say, of sound enough body to decline staying here. Unless you can provide an up to date x-ray image that proves them necessary, you will remove these casts and arrange for my discharge from this medical facility. If you do not do so, Steve will be sent to every lawyer I know and will return with them so that I may formally begin a lawsuit against you and this hospital.”
It was a pity that Tony wasn’t able to change too much because if he could, Howard would turn into a footnote in some history book. Oh well, as much fun as that would be...
He felt like a warped puzzle piece that didn’t fit in with the picture the others created. They were bright and cleanly cut while he was a murky grey with frayed edges. He wanted to lock himself in his room with Steve and just hold him as the soothing silence covered them like a blanket, but that was a cowardly thing to do. Bucky was a lot of things, but he was no coward.
“I could suck you off,” Bucky offered, a little lost. “I’m good at that. You could fuck me, too, if that’s what you wanted.”
Where were all of these men disappearing to? Aerial reports had stated that massive stretches of land had been burned through, but they’d also stated the amounts of smoke from fire they’d observed wasn’t large enough to explain the burned earth.
He only had to exist without mass to do it. That got his mind going through quantum physics equations as he walked through the boroughs of New York.
Steve looked back to Tony, who gently smiled at him, and grabbed his hand, lacing their fingers together. “No,” he said, returning the smile. “I’m not complaining.”
The wall is full of…metal people? Observation determines them the Ironman weapons. There are several, each with varying details. But they are…interesting? It looks at the face plates. Smoothly crafted, non-expressive, functional. It looks at the chest piece.
“I can’t tell you.” Tony told him. “If I say anything it could change something, and this is one thing that I can’t risk changing. Like I said, your work is too important. Can you get me in? As a technician? A consultant? Fuck, I’ll sweep the floors if I have to, but can you do it?”
Even then, Steve had seen a spark of something in Bucky’s eyes as he’d looked at them. It had reminded Steve of that same amazement Bucky used to have when they were young.
Tony’s chest moved forward against him as his arms circled Bucky, holding him sweetly as his hands ran along Bucky’s back. Bucky shuddered and buried his head into Tony’s neck as he felt himself begin to cry silently. Tony made soothing sounds next to his ear as he held him, knowing words weren’t needed in this moment. Bucky was crying, but it wasn’t just because of the horrors he’d gone through. He was also crying with relief at being here and joy that he’d survived long enough for Tony and Steve to find him.
The smoke around them was thick as they saw the strange blue artillery fire continue to destroy the last of the retreating Germans.
“You just lay there and get comfortable, beautiful,” Tony said breathlessly, “because I have a feeling this could end up taking a while. It’s what you need, right? Nice and slow and sweet…”
Steve actually believed him. The man was hardened from his job, but it was obvious he cared about the loss of life. Steve, however, couldn’t believe that this was the end of it. He couldn’t, not Bucky.
Holy Shit! Tony’s eyes flicked back up to Steve’s who was looking like he could come at any moment. He watched as Steve bit down on his bottom lip like he was trying to regain control of himself. Tony’s own control was slipping. He was painfully aroused, not having had sex in almost a year and suddenly feeling every damn minute of it. He hadn’t gone longer than six months without sex since he was fourteen.
They had somehow managed to arrive to the army camp late. So late, in fact, that Steve had been needed to help the crew set up for the show. Hell, Tony had even pitched in just to help move things along and keep his mind occupied. Not that it worked. It was kind of difficult with a constant reminder to his problems attached to his body.
The one named Steve still looked sad. Sad blue eyes. “Ok then, we just need to wake up Tony. I think he fell asleep waiting for us. Then he’ll be able to help you. Alright?”
Steve looked at him gratefully as they felt the truck slow to a stop before it began moving in reverse. Only a second after the truck docked, Steve’s senses must have picked up on something because he raised his shield in front of them. The flap was pulled back by a soldier, and Steve wasted no time in using it to smack the guard so hard he flew from sight.
“You accused his people of giving their country away,” Bucky pointed out. “You said that to a member of the French Resistance.”
, and work on it until it could fly. If Bucky wanted a flying car, Tony would give him one. With missiles and a link to JARVIS.
. I know we’re not normal, but I have to be,” he gasped, “have to be seriously fucked up to be like this. How can you wanna touch me after that?”
They were both panting roughly, probably desperate to move since Steve was impaled on Bucky. Tony moved forward, taking himself in hand and lined himself with Bucky’s ass.
It was a woman, a beautiful woman. She was bending forward towards the viewer. Her dress was half unbuttoned, and her large chest was all but falling out the top. Her hands were cupping each side of her breasts and pushing them together, nice and tight. On the edge of the picture was very clearly a man from the waist down. His pants were open. A long, hard cock held tightly in his fist.
, he internally agreed. He looked at Bucky and said, “When I said I’ve been a daddy, I meant you. Just you. When I told you I liked it, I’d only realized I liked it because it was you giving me that name. You’re the only one.”
Stark grabbed the tool again but didn’t approach it. He just kept looking at its face. “Now, if you’re ready, I’d like to start by opening the plate by your shoulder.”
James was down to a thin, white sleeveless undershirt. Lean muscles from hard work corded his arms. He stopped when he noticed that he and Steve weren’t alone. His eyes met Tony’s, and his mind reeled. They were the same shape, the same color, but they were so different from the eyes Tony had been looking into for the past six months. The shadows were gone, along with the haunted look that had so plainly spoken of pain and loss and guilt.
“Several when you arrived. There was damage to your entire body. We’ve retaken different images over the course of the past four days.” Abrams hesitated then said, “Each new image seems to contradict the previous one. From organ damage to bone regrowth to tissue repair, it’s as if the x-rays came from different people or were done weeks apart. Nothing about your injuries or recovery can be explained.”
Sometimes when he looked at Steve, Bucky would get this feeling like he was so close to something, to the reason behind everything, but the harder he tried to grab on to that thought, the further away it moved into his mind. It was like trying to grab smoke.
“Well, I fail to comprehend how a common repairman with no credentials could have the nerve to presume that he would know more on this subject than me!” Howard bellowed in return. His red face pulled into a mixture of anger and contempt. “Since you’re obviously looking to feel useful, you should take the elevator two floors up. I hear there’s a typewriter that needs fixing where the records are kept.”
“You and your mouth, Barnes, I swear,” Tony said as he got up and brought their plates to the sink. “You could talk a nun into doing burlesque. Damn, I almost forgot the wine!”
As he approached a large group of people all talking quickly in worried and angry voices, he paused to take in the scene. Mr. Flannery who owned the bookshop saw him and called out, “Did ya hear, Tony? The Japs attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii!”
“Twice her age? She’s the same age as me.” Bucky said as he cocked his head. “Wait, how old are you, Tony? I just realized we never asked.”
“Not at all,” Abraham smiled, eyes still shrewd as he motioned to begin walking. “You are even welcome to join me if you do not mind the company.”
“Well, their either too far away or too dead,” Tony reasoned, “so I say we go find some pizza instead. All of this emoting has made me want something covered in grease and cheese. Maybe washed down with a soda.”
For one very weak moment, Bucky almost wanted to forget everything again because reliving Tony’s pain this way, knowing how doomed they all were, was nearly too much to take.
“That’s actually a good point.” Natasha said, almost impressed as she looked at the archer. Then she looked back to Steve. “How much has he changed? How long has he been there?”
That had truly been the first time he’d met Tony in the present, when the music had stopped and everything grew quiet. Looking into those warm brown eyes, that was the moment Bucky had met Tony Stark, and everything after in this room had been alright. He may not have been able to appreciate or understand everything that moment meant in the months that followed. He may not have known what the man would one day become to him. He may have struggled to care, but that didn’t matter. Tony had cared. Tony had always cared.
“But why?” Erskine asked with true fascination. “Why be a simple repairman? With your intellect and knowledge, you could do anything, become anything. The world could be yours once again.”
Even though this was killing Tony, he still took a moment to memorize Steve’s face. He wanted to remember that hope, the light that still shone from eyes that marked the last of his innocence. Because Tony knew that it would soon be gone, and Steve would never look at him that way again. Tony knew it.
Steve’s arms tightened around him as he laid another kiss atop Bucky’s head. “When you’re ready, you tell me what you can, but don’t tell me more than you’re comfortable with. I told you no matter how long it takes, or what it means for us, I’m gonna be here with you. I’m not giving up on you, Buck.”
They’d stayed up a little longer, gently teasing Steve about his rumpled hair and clothes (along with the fact he’d had to go change said clothes because of the grinding action he’d received). It had been nice, fun.
“I’m still hard.” Steve said dumbly because it was very evident that Steve’s erection hadn’t flagged at all. “Is that normal?”
“You’re fuckin’ amazing, Buck.” Steve grunted as he pushed back in and started a rhythm, going all the way down each time. Every few thrusts he would pull back, and Bucky would suck in a breath before taking Steve all over again. It sounded wet and filthy with Bucky moaning around the dick in his mouth.
“Yes,” Tony nodded with relief that Steve seemed to accept that. “I told you that I intend to follow you anywhere. Even though I can’t finish it right now, it just makes me feel better working on it. I can’t fully explain why, but I have to do this, Steve. I have to,” Tony all but pleaded with him to understand. He needed to have this ready.
That had been a few months ago, and the soldiers from some of the other groups had been reabsorbed back into what was left of their units. Bucky, Dugan and the rest were now back with a newly formed 107th as they made their way through Italy. It was getting colder at night. If this was the European autumn, he didn’t want to think of the freezing conditions they’d be facing once winter arrived.
See? Steve was smart enough to recognize what an idiot Justin Hammer is! Tony chuckled. Stupid Justin Hammer. The “ex-wife” story was always brought up within the team for a good laugh when Rhodey came to visit. The first time he heard it, Steve had laughed until he had tears in his eyes. He had a nice laugh.
Tony knew it was unfair of him to blame the poor doctors for this, but he really didn’t have any other option. He couldn’t let them keep him here just to satisfy their curiosity, especially now, it was almost time. Bucky would be home in little more than a week, and he would only be home for a short three weeks before he was shipped out. Tony knew this because he remembered that Bucky left the day after the Stark Expo, and Tony had to be there.
Tony was going out of his mind, and he didn’t really know what to do about it. The trip had taken forever. First, that awful boat ride on the slowest ship in history. Tony had tried to use the time working on his new era-appropriate gauntlet, using tech he’s been able to salvage from his watch, but it was slow going. His future technology was too sophisticated to be compatible; he just didn’t have the tools he needed.
Yes, I'm a day early! I had a very productive weekend. Finally conquered chapter 9 before continuing and finishing chapter 10. Go me! A lot happens this chapter. Fluff, smut and a bit of action too. Tony and the boys are starting a new year with a new direction to their lives. This chapter is the catalyst. So for all my fellow recovering Game of Thrones fans, be warned. Winter smut is coming. Just not this chapter LOL.
It was nice, he thought. It reminded him of the night of Thanksgiving after he’d woken from his nightmare and shared his pathetic story with them. The support surrounding him on both sides, the affection that was so palpable he felt like he could literally breathe it in. But now it was laced with something else, something he had a hard time defining.
“Equally good choices. Remind me to introduce you both to AC/DC and Black Sabbath. There’s a chance you might not be hopeless after all.” Tony said taking another large gulp of coffee. He needed to fully wake up. Besides having to deal with Strange soon, he needed his wits about him to deal with the two 95 year-olds who put underwear models to shame. Not that he was looking.
When she was gone again, Tony looked at them. Letting his cool façade slip a little, he voiced his growing anxiety. “I hope this isn’t too much. I know it’s different than what you’re used to, and I’m trying hard not to go overboard. I just wanted to take you out and show you something new. I want you to enjoy yourselves.”
The second part of the story was really a gift to myself. I needed some team bonding fluff. Besides, I wouldn't write Steve having the team help make a meal and not show their dinner conversation.
walking in on us? Those big brown eyes in shock when he sees how good you are to me. I know you get off on the thought of being watched, being heard. He heard you that night, too. I think he was just as hard as I was listening to the filthy things you said and did to her. It was so hard not to come listenin’ to you with him right there when I know how good you feel. You sounded so fuckin’ amazing. I wonder if he liked your sounds as much as hers.”
“Before any of you try it,” Tony growled at the remaining three, “take one step towards me or the kid, and I’ll break this piece of shit’s arm.” To get his point across, Tony twisted and pushed the wrist out while pressing down the shoulder joint firmly. Joe starting hissing in pain. “I know,” Tony almost chuckled, “it’s pretty damn effective, isn’t it?” Natasha would be so proud of him right now.
“Well yeah. That and Byrne is one of the few men stupid enough to fool around with the butcher’s wife.”
Yesterday Bucky would have grunted and said something like “It’s fine.”, but today he felt that Steve deserved a better answer than that. For fuck’s sake he had made this whole damn meal from scratch just for Bucky.
“Once I escaped, however, I began to question that belief. What if this man was right? Could I really risk not knowing just to hold onto my own certainty that science was all there was to this universe? Could I risk such a man acquiring even more power? No, I had to be sure, so I began to look, to see more than what my eyes and mind told me was real. I read many books, some of them so ancient that their languages have died, but I was able to learn enough.
“Clint,” Natasha’s voice cut through his rambling. “None of this is our business. We have a friend and teammate who is still missing. That is what we should be focusing on.” Her voice softened as she turned to Bucky. “We’ll get him back, Bucky. One way or the other, we will not stop until he is home. Don’t worry about him not loving you. Stark can be a lot of things, but he isn’t stupid, and only an idiot would throw away what you clearly had in the past.”
It was enough to overwhelm him, enhanced or not, and that was all on top of everything he had done and gone through since he’d woken up over twenty hours ago. Steve just tried to take it in stride. If these men could find the strength to follow him and march, he would do his best to accept the responsibility they’d given him. Even though he still wasn’t sure why any of the other more experienced officers hadn’t taken command.
“Right. Try it again.” He said before snapping at the man working behind Steve. “No, Harvey, the banners go the other way. Use your head! This isn’t complicated, people. We have a show in less than seven hours! Rogers, from the top!”
It had all vanished when he’d seen Tony and Steve waving at him across the way. They had looked so happy, something he remembered reflected his own joy at being home. Tony had never looked so ruggedly handsome as he had with his thick, trimmed beard and the light pattern of bruises that were almost healed. They’d gone out for dinner at their favorite restaurant, and Bucky felt a pang in chest as he now thought about how his old friends were no longer living. He’d gained and lost a lot of friends in the course of one day. At least, that’s how it felt.
queer? If you want to identify as that, then you can. But not in that tone.  There are a lot of people who don’t fall into the role that this society says they should, but there is nothing shameful about it.”
Steve kissed him. “Of course I do, love.” He said when he pulled back. “I love you trusting me like that and making you feel good. I always have. But with Tony, he’s so good at everything, ya know? And he can be so commanding, so I can’t help but wonder what it would feel like to have the attention of someone like him focused on me. Does that make sense?”
Feeling slightly silly at the overly formal nature of this, Steve put his right hand in Thor’s slightly larger one.
“You’re pretty cocky for a guy who thought Led Zeppelin was a failed military experiment,” Tony sassed back. He had really enjoyed being the one to introduce Steve to the awesomeness that is classic Led Zeppelin. It doesn’t mean he still won’t tease the super-soldier about it.
Steve nodded helplessly until he felt Tony’s fingers pull free from his mouth. He sucked in a breath then panted, “Yes, sir, please!”
“Tony!” Steve gasped blindly as he heard the familiar drawl of his friend’s voice and saw the blurry image of him approaching in an alleyway.
Once that was done, Tony stepped forward and signed for everything. “Any charges for service or meals will be taken care of by me. Just add it my account.”
He was desperate, very desperate. It would only make him fight harder to keep them. He could figure this out. He could save them.
Tony heard fumbling followed by a crash and a curse before the door was suddenly pulled open. He looked up into Steve’s red-rimmed eyes before the now taller man pulled him into a bone crushing hug. Steve was shaking as he practically carried Tony through the doorway and into the room, somehow managing to close the door behind them as Tony gasped, trying not to breathe too deeply and break a rib.
As they walked past a tent that was obviously for medical triage, an ambulance pulled in honking its horn. Men rushed up before it had come to a stop and shouted orders as they opened the doors and began offloading wounded men on stretchers.
Tony chuckled. “A lot of new things can, I suppose. Give it time, you may change your mind, but the label isn’t important. What we are to each other is.”
Barnes stared at him. For like, a little too long. Tony was beginning to regret involving him in the conversation when he finally answered, “I like Steve’s choices, but I also liked
“I couldn’t leave his side after what happened to him,” Tony said truthfully. Steve and Tony had finally been able to tell Bucky everything that he’d missed in the time they’d been apart during one of the breaks they’d taken from marching.
Bucky laid in the recovery bed, completely still except for the slight rise and fall of his chest. The events of the past three hours replayed in his damaged mind. When Steve had collapsed back at the sanctum, Bucky had actually been scared. With Stark having gone missing, the unknown reason for Steve’s episode had made him panic. He supposed that his concern for Steve shouldn’t have surprised him, but it kind of did.
Bucky just nodded, still looking at his juice as conversation began to resume. He couldn’t say why it was so hard around the others still. He knew they were good people. He knew they wouldn’t hurt him. He knew on some level they wanted to help him. But…
This was really beginning to feel like a job interview, Tony thought as he said, “Besides English? French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian and Latin.”
Tony was fucking milking him. Steve’s dick was slick with pre-come that spread from Tony’s moving hand. His poor prostate was in a constant state of stimulation and varying amounts of pressure. He wasn’t going to last. Just like he knew Tony wouldn’t stop once he came.
Tony began moving as he took his first step toward the bedroom. “Steve,” he called, and when the younger man turned to face him, Tony cupped his hands around those delicate cheekbones and jaw to bring him in for a kiss.
“To be fair they were right about that,” Tony conceded, “but I’d like to believe I’ve gotten better about it in the past couple years.”
They arrived just in time to see Tony break the first guy’s nose then knock him out. Tony rolled on the ground, delivered punches then spun around to throw another guy
“Well, when we make it back, I’ll try to remember to buy him a cheese basket.” Tony said. “He obviously can’t get enough of the stuff.”
Steve turned to look at him, then put the bowl down beside him and moved the bacon from the burner. “What?”
Steve shook his head, “No, thankfully no one else was hit. You pushed Mr. Russo out of the way at the last second. He was a little bruised, but he’s going to be alright.”
Tony blew out a deep breath and forced his hands and feet to still. The stillness lasted six seconds. “Fuck this, I need a smoke,” he said and grabbed the shoulder bag that he’d been traveling with and started rifling through it.
Howard’s eyes lingered on Tony for a moment more in disbelief that Tony had sidestepped his insult with such indifference before looking at Erskine. “Yeah, doc. That should be fine.”
Tony let out an impressed whistle. “Wow. I’ve only made a few appliances out of spare parts. I can’t imagine creating something like all this.”
Tony softly kissed the back of his neck. “How about a bath, Sweetheart?” He asked against Bucky’s ear.
OK, so Tony had channeled Samuel L. Jackson’s performance in Pulp Fiction for the last guy, but at least he didn’t shoot them like the character he was imitating. “The path of the righteous man…”
Bucky lifted his eyes, and Tony thought of how vulnerable he looked. “Tony, I…I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do.”
Steel that had blushed at the faith shown in him by Tony, and that was…Well, Tony didn’t know what that was. It certainly wasn’t adorable, and if his stomach fluttered before he looked back down to the gears he was checking below Barnes’s elbow, it was surely because he was hungry. Right?
And how the man could go from choking Bucky with his dick while talking dirty to this shy, sweet boy was just one of Steve’s charms. Tony smiled and kissed his cheek again then turned to Bucky, who’s breathing had settled and had turned over to his side to look at them.
They quickly moved into the brightly lit factory floor, and this was going to be tricky, Tony thought. People were moving all around them, working or patrolling. They crouched and moved between pieces of equipment as they made their way through the room until they came upon a table with glowing munitions. At least, that’s what it looked like to Tony before his glasses informed him what it was made of.
“Then just answer this,” Tony said because he was honestly getting pretty freaked out about what he was hearing. “What exactly is wrong with me? What are my injuries?”
“It’s the eyes,” Tony told him seriously. “No one can say no to Steve’s puppy dog eyes. I think it’s one of those superpowers he has now.”
“I know, baby.” Tony sympathized as he rubbed a thumb over the back of Steve’s hand. “I know how hard it is to be separated for a long time from people you care about. It’s why I worry so much about the two of you. Being alone is painful.”
The boys had continued with their tradition of gifting him with Isaac Asimov. Apparently, they were able to get their hands on that year’s April and May editions of Astounding Science Fiction. The April edition held the short story
Not that they had spent much time speaking to each other since then. Tony wasn’t hurtful about it, but he really didn’t have it in him to keep up the pretense while he was trying to get his head back on straight. He’d never spent so much time pretending to sleep in his life. It hurt to be around them, and at the same time he was so desperate for them that he couldn’t turn them away when they caught him awake.
Steve leaned closer to where Tony lay on his lap, and Tony tilted the paper so they could both read.
“They can feel things very intensely,” he told them. “Emotions like joy, usually having a sense of euphoria.” That actually sounded kinda nice, Bucky thought. “Their capacity for pain is also affected, and they are no longer able to judge their tolerance for it reliably. As the top, Steve, it is your responsibility to monitor that.”
“Good things, I hope?” Tony asked before looking at the other guys. “So, fellas. Now that I’ve dotted some i's and crossed some t’s, what’s say we find a place to put your gear?”
“No, they didn’t tell me anything,” Tony said as he started rubbing his hand. “I just know. I know it, Steve, and I—we have to find out what happened.”
“Thank you,” he said sincerely before adding a touch of humor. “You give pretty insightful talks, did you know that?”
Tony struggled to remain respectful as he stood up for himself against the grumpy colonel. “I missed your smiling face?”
“On my way to Bleeker Street in the Village. Want me to pick you up some those chocolate cranberry muffins you like?”
Tony moved forward and kissed his forehead, running his fingers through his sweaty hair. “That was incredible, sweetheart.” He ran his fingers down the back of Bucky’s head to the nape of his neck, staring at his flushed skin and sleepy grey eyes. “So gorgeous.” He whispered.
Tony joined his steps immediately, but Phillips’s voice rang out. “Stark, I still want to know what the hell you’re doing in my camp. Enough of your crap.”
Steve was touched and awkwardly humble when Tony admitted he should be their official leader. It made the most sense, Steve’s name would go further than any of theirs in terms of public opinion, but it wasn’t the only reason. Although he was technically the youngest Avenger, Steve had proven time and again that he was a master strategist and could lead the fight in any battle, no matter how hopeless or desperate. Tony was Iron Man, but Steve Rogers had an inner core of steel.
He placed the bills in Byrne’s hand, “So don’t ever let me see you around here again because I will make sure it is the last time I see you.”
“Is it wrong that I don’t want him change?” Bucky asked. “It’s like he’s starting to spiral, and I don’t want to lose him because of it. I need my Tony back. We both do.”
Tony shrugged. “I enjoy penetration. It feels fantastic if the top knows what they’re doing. Submission, on the other hand, is different. Trust is a big part of it, and I have rarely fully trusted someone, even my partners to that degree. I have submitted to a point, but it’s really that my top would need to
“Steve,” Tony began as he blew a stream of air across the hot liquid before he took a sip, “your presents are the blue ones. Bucky, yours are the red.”
“Thank fuck,” Tony sighed as he ran a trembling hand through his hair. His nerves were shot. He’d heard the poor health stories, but this was different. This was real. Terrifying. He didn’t know how Steve lived like this, under constant threat that any minute his body would betray him, and he might die from it.
Bucky sighed as Steve stretched out next to him. After a few seconds, Bucky laid his head back down on Steve’s lap, and he felt the blonde fingers return to his hair. The soothing gesture helped to release the remaining tension he felt.
Tony’s mind raced as Bucky’s words pierced him, and he remembered treatment of homosexuals who fell under the wrong sort of legal attention during this time. Jail was the better of the options they’d be faced with. Those institutions were a nightmare. He would die before he allowed that to happen to any of them. He watched a tear fall onto Bucky’s cheek.
He never complained about his weaknesses. What was the point? It wouldn’t change anything, and it would only prove that he was, in fact, weak. But sometimes Steve wondered what it would be like to just wake up and feel good, healthy. What would it be like to not constantly ache or have to worry about asthma or getting sick because he’d gotten caught in the rain.
Tony kissed him, letting his lips linger before resting his forehead against Bucky’s, mimicking their first embrace. “My sweet boy. You can call me daddy or sir or whatever else you want to when we’re together. I love you.”
There was a knock at the door. Steve and James were still looking too stunned for words so Tony went and answered. It was the delivery boy from the butcher shop. “Excellent! Bring it through here.” As he led the boy to the kitchen, Steve and James hadn’t moved. “Just set it down there.” He pointed to the nearly overloaded little table.
Bucky made a choked sound when he finally bottomed out. This was always a good set up for his sweet boy. Steve covering him with his body as he was stretched open around Bucky’s cock, and Tony filling him, giving him praise. Too many sensations for him to think or worry about anything as he was surrounded by the men he loved.
Instinct had almost made Tony give some mouthy remark. He didn’t do well around government bigwigs, but this wasn’t Nick Fury or creepy Senator what’s-his-face. Philips didn’t need Tony, and he could kick his sorry ass to the curb anytime he wanted to. So Tony smiled politely and said, “I’m smart enough to be useful.”
Tony and Steve stood in silent anticipation as they waited at the bus station for Bucky to arrive. All around them were other people waiting for their loved ones and friends to return home after the months they’d spent away at army training. There was an excitement shared by everyone there as they saw the bus approaching.
“Very true,” Dugan said. “We were once sent out to capture a town. We took it, held it for three days before we were ordered to leave because supplies couldn’t reach us. Two weeks later we had to fight to retake the same town. We lost good men doing it, too.”
Tony walked away without a backwards glance. The key to a good lie was confidence, and Tony knew the man had no say over Steve’s personal anything in the first place.
“I’m glad,” Steve answered as he lowered himself back to Tony’s mouth. He felt Steve’s hand leave his stomach where it been helping to prop Steve up, and he figured he was petting Bucky’s hair as he praised him. “Your doing so well, love. Just like I told you to. You look so sexy between his legs.”
They weren’t able to go back to sleep after Bucky finally calmed down. Eventually, Steve decided to move them from the floor. When Bucky didn’t show any signs of objecting, Steve bent down and pulled him up before leading him into the living room. It was surreal to interact with Bucky this way, but the events of the night had obviously taken a lot out of him, and the brunet looked lost in his own thoughts.
“If I remember correctly,” Bucky said as he rubbed his face against Steve’s chest where his head lay, “it was my job to call you out on crap. And I love you, too, punk.”
“He didn’t need to prove anything to me,” Steve said, and Bucky just stared at him incredulously. Steve finally sighed and admitted, “Alright, I know he did. I’m a hard-headed, stubborn, self-righteous prat when it comes to my opinions, and they don’t change until I’ve learned better.”
The others nodded and began to move away, but Steve said, “You know, you can call me Steve. I don’t need the title.”
Philips’s face was the definition of apathy as Tony stared at the frown lines that dominated the colonel’s features. God, had the man ever smiled once in his life? “Son, a roll of toilet paper can be useful, but that doesn’t mean I have one on staff.”
I just want you to keep in mind that this would be the climate that Tony and the boys are living in. Constant updates about the destruction, the loss and the war that is now here.
“Perfect,” Tony murmured behind him right before he pushed into Steve. Steve groaned at the stretch and the feel of the hard ridge on the head of Tony’s cut dick . It was so good. Tony filled him, and Steve just let go at the feeling. He didn’t want to think about anything but this.
Tony smirked at that before he made his way across the yard to the command tent. He prepared himself to eventually argue with the man who had always made it abundantly clear that Tony was not wanted or needed. He needed to remind the man how useful he could be and had already been. He needed to show Phillips that he was wrong about Tony, and maybe, just maybe, they could find some way for Tony to keep helping Steve and the war effort. He also had to watch his mouth.
One of the truly wonderful things about Steve and Bucky was they never really questioned all of the money that Tony seemed to have. They just knew he’d made more than them when they’d lived together, and he had because of all his jobs. But…
“I’m sorry, Stevie,” he began, but Steve cut him off with a kiss. It wasn’t heated and didn’t last long, but it was enough to stop Bucky’s downward thoughts.
He hadn’t had to worry so much about food since Afghanistan. Or the Mandarin incident, but that was just because that kid Harley was too lazy to make a sandwich.
Bucky was right. Life wasn’t fair, and it was hard most of the time, but that didn’t mean you were allowed to stop trying. Because if you tried hard enough, you might finally make it to the other side of forever.
money. People all over the country have jobs and steady pay because of this. Steel and manufacturing plants are now employed to capacity to keep up with the supply demands. Shipyards are in full production along with automotive plants to make boats for the navy and vehicles for the army, then there’s the planes for the air force. Farmers are able to grow more crops and sell their harvest to be sent overseas for our soldiers and allies. This is only the beginning of that.”
It’s not that Tony wanted to be dead, far from it. He had too much to do, and he couldn’t leave Steve and Bucky. He had to help them. Still, the thought of his healing capabilities added to the fact that his aging appeared to have slowed, if not stopped altogether, added to a growing sense of dread that lurked in the corners of his mind.
But that’s not what had sent Tony over the edge. Able to think clearly now, he knew that his own lust had less to do with Marie and had been more about Bucky and Steve. The sounds and words Bucky had spoken were seared into his mind. He wanted to watch Bucky using those sinful skills on a willing body, maybe hear his own name spoken in that low rough voice. The look of Steve so turned on had made Tony want to wreck him even further. Slowly take him apart until he was moaning louder than Marie. Begging Tony for more as if he might die without it.
Tony did his best to gently suck at the head as he caught his breath. Then, he heard the wrapper being torn from a condom. Steve leaned over him between his spread out legs and wiped at the tears on one of his cheeks. He hadn’t realized that many had fallen.
Tony knew the thing was probably old, not that he could really judge because everything around him looked old. He decided he was just going to turn it off when he had an idea. Looking through the drawers in the kitchen, he found a basic tool kit. Tony smiled as he held the screwdriver in his hand. Finally, something that felt familiar.
“You can yell at me, Buck.” Steve said as he hugged Bucky against him once more. It meant a lot that Bucky cared enough to raise his voice and confront Steve. “If you’re talking sense into me, you have to yell. I’ve been told that I’m pretty thick headed.”
Erskine smiled in that kind way of his. “Forgive me for saying so, Tony, but your story is too unbelievable for me not to believe you. Why would you create such a story if it was not the truth, especially if you wanted to gain my trust. Besides, I’ve seen your technology since then. No one evil would possess such things only to not use them as they worked as a repairman.”
Steve was quietly removing Tony’s shoes, but it was Bucky who answered, bringing back bandages from the bathroom.
He turned to the others. “You speak of alternate timelines and the effects of changing your history, but it is not so with this. You mortals cling to your science, but you know nothing of magic, which is a science to itself. Stark cannot alter the course of anyone’s true destiny because it was already written when the spell was cast. The minor events of one day to another cannot change fate. He could try, and he would fail, for that is not the purpose of this spell.”
Steve continued to lead them to the door as he explained the direction they should make their escape, telling the men to give them hell on the way out. It was something Tony doubted they would have a problem with.
“You’ve never treated me like I was weak.” Steve repeated. “I don’t want you to hold back if we’re together.” How much would he want? How much could he take? Bucky had always joked that Steve liked getting hit. Steve didn’t really, not if it was getting punched in the face, but he did always push himself to his limit.
“They should,” He told her in a mock serious tone,” I started that rumor myself and would be disappointed if people didn’t believe it.”
Tony shrugged. “Well, this is one of those things that I can’t make and wouldn’t even try without the fire department present.”
But his chest, that was a horror show. That shrapnel had made the first marks across his ribs and upper torso. Then, the makeshift magnet Yinsen had implanted to save him. Yeah, having your ribs and sternum cut away without anesthetic sucked. It also left a roadmap across his pecs. After the fiasco with the fake Mandarin and Killian, Tony had had the reactor removed, and though he didn’t regret it, he sometimes missed the soothing glow that had been a part of him. Unfortunately, the surgery had been extensive, leaving Tony’s chest…ugly. Like an autopsy of someone that was hit by a car, incision marks and webbed scarring started from just below his collarbone to a few inches above his naval.
“That was not wise of him to involve you, mortal.” Her eyes narrowed as she sneered, “If Clea’s husband believed you could aid him, he is a bigger fool than I imagined.”
“Then she don’t deserve you.” Bucky said seriously. “You said you were feeling better so we’re going out. You’re not gonna hide in this apartment.”
It turns out Bucky could. His instructions were easy to follow, and he moved effortlessly through the steps, showing Tony exactly how to let his partner know what he wanted them to do.
watch the way Steve’s running shorts hung low on his hips. The material clinging to that sculpted ass, the fabric a deep contrast to the brilliant white of that tiny fucking shirt…
They all looked accusingly at Steve and Bucky, waiting for an explanation. Bucky was confused by their behavior, and it took him a few moments to realize what had happened. He and Steve had gotten so used to the new memories constantly being pushed into their minds and hadn’t paid the new ones much thought because they’d been focusing on the discussion. When Bucky thought about the newest memories, he realized what Clint was asking about.
He pulled back and turned his head to address the space above Steve’s shoulder. “Yep, I’m fine. So why don’t we call it a night now that the nightcaps have run out? It’s late, and we could all use a good night’s sleep.” He did his best to fake a yawn. “Sleepy, and hey, now that I’m on the mend I can move back to the couch so you can have your beds back.”
He heard their murmured replies, “Of course, Tony.” “Sleep as long as you need to.” He dimly noted their exit as he laid there and let oblivion claim him.
Bucky nodded slowly, obviously fighting against the haze of liquor. “My dad was always drinking. Everyday. It didn’t matter if it was Christmas or your birthday. He got mean after he’d drunk enough. He’d drink away half of his paycheck sometimes.” Bucky’s voice turned bitter. “I hated him for that. He cared more about his fucking liquor than taking care of my ma and sister. I hated that more than when he’d take a swing at me.”
Tony thought about what he was going to do now. He didn’t know what Umar’s reasons were for sending him here. She’d just said it would be easy to get to know Steve and James better, and now through a series of events he was living on their couch. Was it coincidence? Fate? Was this a pocket realm she created, and all of this was fake? Tony didn’t think even she had that kind of mojo, but he could be wrong.
Tony grabbed his chin and turned his face back to him, pressing a soft kiss against his lips. “No, you’re beautiful, baby boy. Look at that smooth, pale skin, and now I can see how far down that blush of yours goes.”
Steve sniffed as he looked at Tony, gripping him this side of too tight as he tried to control his emotions.
That racism Bucky and his friends experienced was a very real thing. (The right shade of white) At this time in Brooklyn, the Irish, Italian and Jewish populations had exploded with immagrants that had come into the country in the past few decades. Many "english" Americans did not approve of them. Sadly enough, they did not approve of each other. There would be a Jewish side of the street and an Irish side, for example. They held onto prejudices and stereotypes of other nationalities.
“No gals for us, right Sarge?” Dum answered for him, and sometimes it was uncanny at how perceptive the man could be when he usually went out of his way to be an idiot. “I’m a lifelong bachelor, and Sarge here’s been known to play a little fast and loose. What about you, Jones?”
“Are you kidding?” Tony asked. “I have to give you something? Being in my presence isn’t enough? This is extortion Steve, and I’m both very impressed and disappointed that you’re capable of that.”
“Well, I wish him the best.” James smiled then turned to start breakfast as Tony finished dressing. The smell of eggs and toast was very welcome to Tony’s stomach. The potato soup Steve made last night, while very tasty, seemed long gone. He normally didn’t each much, or regularly, but Tony figured the stress was giving him an appetite. That, and the knowledge that this could be his last meal here.
“Yes, they are.” The other man said before knocking back the last of his whiskey and standing. He moved over to a map board a few feet away, and Tony now saw that the previous HYDRA base was marked off the map. The Colonel stared at the map for a long time.
It was a power play. By all rights a younger man should have addressed him as Mr. Stark until told otherwise by the man nearly twice his age. By deciding to use Tony’s first name, he was practically shouting
He still worried, though. There were so many things Bucky could do that would ruin this, so many things that could make Steve realize that he was making a mistake.
“…is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men,” Steve finished for him. “Ezekiel 25:17.”
“But why?” Bucky asked before he quickly continued. “I mean you can if you want, but you don’t need to.”
Bucky was grumbling, but Steve could see the happiness in his eyes when he took it before laying down and using it as a small pillow. He saw as Bucky curled in on himself with his back against the tree and his head close to Tony’s legs, and Steve was reminded of a scared wounded animal the way he made himself so small. Steve had never been one for hate, but as he looked at that scene and remembered what Bucky had gone through, he could feel it in him.
At some point, his Daddy had grabbed a bar of soap and began to slowly wash him. Steve gently grabbed his chin to turn his head and kiss him fully. The feel of the other man’s tongue controlling the kiss along with the gentle cleansing of the soap in careful hands was relaxing him further, and he wanted to let go, but he knew he couldn’t yet. He wanted to enjoy this moment.
“The same eyes,” Erskine corrected but kept his tone light. “You have the same eyes. It’s a remarkable coincidence to be sure.”
Steve’s eyes were filled with emotion at the newly formed memory Bucky shared, but he still chuckled softly. “Go figure that the first thing he told me to learn to make was spaghetti. It’s his favorite food, and obviously required more than tomatoes, salt and pepper which I learned the hard way. Once we’d started living together when we were older, I’d began to wonder if Bucky hadn’t been trying to teach me how to take care of him.”
That just cut him deeper. He hadn’t been taking care of them at all. He’d barely touched them in the past week, and none of it had been particularly romantic or sexual. Without them knowing the reason behind it, he would have just appeared to be ignoring them in all the ways that mattered. He’d never deserved them less than he did right now.
Tony delivered a firm slap against the right side of his ass in repayment, but the only result was a long moan from Bucky.
“I’m hurt, doc.” Tony turned to grin at him. “You know just what to say to hurt me. You’re hurtful and mean.”
“Your right about that. Most of it would make a sailor blush before having the need to go to confession.”
Bucky almost whimpered as he kissed him, squirming beneath him, and Tony could feel him trying to rub himself against his leg. Tony deepened the kiss, sucking on Bucky’s tongue as his other hand moved down Steve’s chest and across his stomach. Tony claimed Bucky’s mouth as he finally wrapped his hand around Steve, causing the man to buck up into his fist, groaning.
Tony lightly smacked at the hard length jutting from Bucky’s hips as his other hand moved down to tug on his sac. “Yes, what?”
It was Francesco who had commissioned Steve’s first, second and third paintings for his restaurant when he’d learned that Steve was an artist. Steve had been beside himself to finally be able to use the skills he’d learned in school and paint quality work for a patron. Tony and Bucky had encouraged him to go to other restaurants and advertise his abilities. He’s done many paintings for various places, along with a few murals (one of which was on the wall behind them) and sometimes window art for special occasions. He was getting paid well for it too, or at least it was much more than he used to make.
Tony smiled. “Since when has that ever stopped me? Besides,” he said as he ran his fingers over Steve’s cock, making him gasp in surprise and look down. “It doesn’t look like you’re finished.”
Tony added, “That’s perfectly alright. The term daddy fits into what Bucky wants from me, and what I give him; caretaking, protection with a sense of authority, even the spankings. You can call me Tony or whatever else feels comfortable at the moment.”
That caused a small smile to form on Tony’s lips. “That’s because half of the equations are incomplete.”
Bucky made a choking sound around Steve’s dick then whimpered. Steve’s hips jerked from whatever Bucky’s throat did as he made the noise.
Steve was taken aback at the title and respect he heard in their voices and saw on their faces. He’d meant that as a joke, that silly Captain America was here to help. He didn’t think they’d take him seriously. Men around them whooped as those closest to Steve clapped his back saying, “I can’t believe you made it outta there.” “You’ve got some nerve, man.” “Crazy American bastard!”
Tony shrugged flippantly. “It’s all good, doc. Really. I had worked myself up so much over this meeting, and it was all for nothing. Yeah, Howard’s an egotistical jackass. I guess the same could be said about me, but after that conversation, I know that I’ll be able to handle him. He’s not the Howard I grew up with, not yet. It’s…” It was rare that Tony struggled to put his thoughts into words. “It’s something I know I can deal with. Howard taught his lessons well, and unfortunately for him, I can beat him at his own game now. He can’t…He can’t get to me like he used to.”
“Do you know what they want us for? I mean the candidates.” He thought he was just being given the chance to be a soldier. Tony made it sound like so much more. “You said he was selective.”
That’s like Tony Stark, celibate. Maybe the laws of physics could be changed more easily than he’d thought, because the natural order of Tony’s universe was breaking down as he stared at the risqué photo.
Steve just jumped down and began unlocking the cells, and Tony internally groaned before jumping after him. Just because he could heal didn’t mean this wasn’t murder on his knees, and they still had to find Bucky.
Everything about the commandos is cannon. Hoped you enjoyed a little more backstory about our supporting heros! And no, I don't condone chain smoking like Tony to deal with your problems, but this was the forties and everybody smoked. Besides, Tony can't get cancer anyway. I'm not that mean. Also, I have nothing against Peggy Carter, but Tony kinda does when she looks at his Steve. Don't touch Tony's boys!
“Pretty well, actually.” Steve answered, looking slightly confused. “They said they were glad she’d gotten to play and could make it up to them later. I just got out of there as fast as I could without being too rude.”
And of course, that jackass Jacobson flapping his mouth excessively the whole way across the continent. Tony should have pushed him into the Atlantic when he’d had the chance. Not really, but it was fun to think about. At least the man had kept his senses and not spoken directly to Tony in any way, shape or form. He was keeping to their…. agreement, for lack of a better word, and Tony believed they were both benefiting from it. He really did. Tony had promised the man that as long as he pretended Tony didn’t exist, Tony would be a silent guardian angel and make sure that nothing
. Steve took a breath before he began a running leap off the platform. His muscles easily pushed him into the air, and he was soaring across the distance farther than what should have been possible. His body had done exactly what he’d wanted as he steadily landed onto the other side of the walkway.
Tony watched as the man packed his meager belongings then wrote the letter. “Be sure to tell her you’re sorry. Not for leaving, but for not doing better by her and leaving sooner.”
Bucky was actively searching through the crowd. “Where did he…? No, goddammit!” Bucky cursed and a small group of young ladies next to them looked scandalized. He turned back around, “Pretty sure I know where he’s at. You comin’?”
“Of course, Tony.” Erskine answered with a smile before turning to Howard. “I will come by again tomorrow, and we can go over the data from the generator test together if that works for you, Mr. Stark?”
He met Steve’s eyes and was stunned by the look of gratitude he saw there. Tony knew Steve often felt like a burden to Bucky, and it usually ate at his pride being a grown man that relied on his friend for so much knowing the weight it put on Bucky’s shoulders. Tony had relieved Bucky of that weight and let him feel taken care of for once in his life. Steve mouthed a soft ‘thank you’ before he turned back to his friend and put his hand on his shoulder.
Bucky nodded and closed his eyes. “Those scars, Jesus, he said there was scars, but I didn’t imagine it was that bad. How did he survive that?”
“No trouble at all.” Michael waved it off. He was good man who worked hard for his family, and from what Tony had seen, he was a good father to his children who seemed to adore him.
“Yup, ya want something?” He walked into the kitchen that shared a wall with the bathroom. “We got eggs and bread, for toast.”
“Well, either way,” Steve said, “after we’re done eating we’ll get back to work. Bucky and I can join if you need us. We’re not going to stop until we’ve found a way to bring him home.”
As the days passed, Tony was learning to cope with his panic and fear. Some moments were easier than others. It wasn’t too bad when he was busy working or talking to people around the neighborhood. He’d always done better with something to occupy his mind, and it was as true now as ever.
Once he was in bed with Steve lying next to him, Tony felt his body relax. He gently draped an arm over his younger partner and cuddled as close as his bruises would allow. He sighed, “Finally, just you and me.”
So Tony had put down his soldering iron, went up to his penthouse, showered and dressed to impress. Though his clothes may not be magical like what Strange wore (stupid magic cloak, it’s really not
“So beautiful, Steve,” he said between heavy breaths as he moved. “Wish you could see the way you bounce on his cock. You take him so well.”
Tony watched as Bucky turned before heading over to the enlistment office. Tony hurried around through the crowd to a side entrance to make sure this was happening correctly. His heart was pounding. He’d already told Erskine this was the night, but Tony couldn’t really tell him much more than that because he didn’t have anything to tell. He was going in blind. If Howard had known how Steve met Erskine, he’d never shared it with Tony growing up, and he sure as hell didn’t bother to ask Steve when he’d come to live in the tower. Looking back on that, Tony really has regrets.
Tony chuckled. “Yes, I do.” He started toward the bedroom to grab a nice change of clothes. “But you have to admit it’s kind of touching that he cares so much, especially since I’m about eighty percent sure he knows about us.” Tony thought on that number. “Eh, make that eighty-seven point five percent sure.”
