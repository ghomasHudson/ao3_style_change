“I guess you saw the scars on my back.” Dean pauses for a second and Cas is afraid of what is about to come next but he doesn’t want to interrupt the Winchester.                                             “They tried to get statements of us how good they treated us. They wanted us to criticize our conduct of war and I guess just break our will. They- they- just, waterboarding, beatings, all that kind of crap until we got put back into group cells or solitary confinement. Nearly all the Boys of my unit died over there. I heard their screams until they just got quiet someday.”                                                       Dean tries to regain his voice, tears now streaming down his face.                                                                      “I don’t know how often they just took two to ten of us and just killed them, right where they were, in front of us, because they apparently were no good use anymore. I lost count to all the days I woke up with the thought of being with you only to be pulled back into the like blood and sweat smelling reality, in that fucking shit hole.”                                            Dean hisses, tears still streaming down his face and Cas can’t do anything besides pulling the now shaking man close against his chest and buries his face in Dean’s hair like he did the past few days.                                                                                “I don’t know how I got out. The only thing I remember is waking up in this damn hospital and a big bandage covering my whole back. I was in there for some time before I insisted on going home.”                                                                             Dean whispers and buries his face into Cas shirt trying to regain control over his shaking body. Cas feels the urge to apologize to Dean but he knows how stupid it is. An apologize won’t help much anyway.
“Dean, do you want to marry me?” The Winchester tries to find his words at first. Confused by the question. Adrenalin shooting through his veins, blurring out all the other sounds around him, the question of the man in front of him is repeating in his head again and again and again.
He feels like he deserves it, the pain, all of it. He swore himself that he would protect Jeremy with all cost but he couldn't because he was drowning in his own pain, didn't even think about his friend after getting back home.
“It- my Dad, right after I stayed at yours for a week the first time.” Dean whispers and Castiel nods lightly.
“Man these are comfortable as fuck.” Dean smiles, Cas sits down onto Dean’s lap and kisses the Winchester’s forehead.
“Dean you should eat something.” Jess carefully insists but Dean just shakes his head. “I’m not hungry.” he still smirks but he stopped fooling everyone a while ago, if they ever believed it anyway.
“Wanna get up?” Cas wants to get Dean out of bed so he can give him the present he bought two years ago after Dean wrote him that they were about to get home which eventually never happened. It was the last letter he got from Dean who was supposed to arrive at home some days later but his unit disappeared in a sudden. “No, let’s stay in bed.” Dean whispers but gets up eventually. Cas stays in bed for another minute before he follows Dean into the bathroom.
He is about to lie down when he realizes that Dean is shifting in his sleep, a bad dream. Cas carefully shakes Dean to wake him up. At first nothing happens but after a second Dean flinches, his eyes snapping open and he presses his back against the wall, trying to move away from Cas. “Dean, it’s me.” Cas whispers but moves back a little, not wanting to scare Dean even more. “It’s not real right?” Dean whispers, tears in his eyes. Cas shakes his head and leans a little closer to Dean. “Stop doing that to me.” Dean whispers still scared and Cas tries to understand what he means. “Dean what-““Stop doing this!” Dean yells at Cas who flinches back a little before he moves forward and cups Deans cheeks between his hands.
They just got onto the main road when Cas decides to ask Dean about what happened the past years. “You wanna talk about it?” he asks carefully not wanting to upset Dean in any way. “Not really. They said I could get someone to talk-“ he stops and keeps staring out the window. Cas turns the radio down a little before he turns to Dean again. “You think it would help you at least a little?” the Dean he knew would shake his head and start laughing about how Cas could think he’s crazy and that he should just shut up. But now he just shrugs his shoulders. “You don’t expect me to go see a therapist right?” he asks with a whisper and Cas shakes his head instantly. “No, I don’t expect you to see a therapist. I don’t even expect you to talk about it. I just think that talking about things that upset us helps. It helps me. And I want you to know that I’m always there for you and you can talk to me about it when you’re ready, even if it takes you decades, I’ll always be there.” Cas gets quieter at the end and Dean just nods. The music stops and a thanking speech, dedicated to all the soldiers who were in Vietnam, fills the car which makes the Winchester turn off the radio in a rush.
“We don’t have to go if you don’t want to.” Cas whispers before he turns onto his side and pulls Dean’s body against his chest so he can relax his now tensed muscles.
“Good morning Dean.” Castiel comes into the living room and sits down in front of the sofa Dean insisted on spending the night on. “Morning.” he mumbles and slowly sits up. His head is pounding but it gets better after a seconds and he looks at the Novak in front of him.
Castiel carefully opens the door to the bedroom, not wanting to wake Dean up but the Winchester is awake, back pressed into the corner, Sam must’ve moved the bed against the side wall, and his legs pulled up against his chest arms tightly wrapped around them.
“That the guy you’ve been here with the past few days?” Dean shakes his head. He tries to lift it but only manages to let it rest on his arm. His mind starts to get flooded with memories of the war mixing with memories from before and after and he has to really try to keep his breathing under control. He’s not gone far enough to just get a panic attack in a bar full of people.
“Cas.” he can hear Sam’s voice right when the younger brother sits down next to him. He wasn’t paying enough attention. He should’ve been more careful.
Sleep deprivation is one of the methods they got him to talk but now there is nothing left to talk about.
“I think you should call that Chuck guy in the morning. He can help?” “Yeah? With what exactly Cas?” Dean pulls away and the warmth disappears from Cas’ side.
The Novak’s scent is still in the sheets and the Winchester just hugs the pillow trying to imagine Cas lying next to him.
“I-I found him on the bathroom floor, he- he was lying in his- I’m sorry I should’ve done something Cas. I- I should’ve known.” Sam cries and buries his face in the palm of his hands and Cas can’t do anything but try to sooth the younger one by rubbing small circles on his back.
He finishes taking pictures and moves to the desk to open the upper drawer. He looks at the folded paper with ‘Castiel’ written on it and takes it out.
“Dean, don’t you think it would be better for you if you stayed here for a little longer. At least until your-” “Until I’m what Sam?” Dean nearly yells and stands up. “Until I don’t get nightmares anymore? Until I don’t get flashbacks of them fucking torturing anymore? Until I stop missing Cas? Or wait,” Dean has a light smile on his lips now, “until I’ll stop wanting to kill myself?” he got awfully quiet at the end and Sam can’t help but stare at his brother in horror. “Guess what Sammy,” his voice is only a whisper now. “That’s never gonna happen. Excuse me, I gotta pack my bag.” Dean leaves the room and Sam kind of just folds in on himself, helpless and out of ideas.
“Dean, please open the door or I will pick the lock.” Cas tries again and hears the click of the lock a minute later. The door opens and Dean steps out. His eyes are red rimmed and he looks completely beaten down. “I’m sorry.” Dean whispers and Cas just pulls the Winchester into a tight hug. “It’s alright.” “You shouldn’t have to take care of me.” “Dean, really. I can do it.” Cas pulls out of the hug and looks Dean up and down.
“Good morning, slept well?” both men nod and the doctor sits down in the plastic chair Castiel opted to sleep in a few hours earlier.
But as soon as Dean starts scratching at his wrists Cas catches them not caring if the Winchester is fine with it or not.
Cas just sits there, staring at Dean who started shivering and mumbling quietly, too quiet for Cas to understand.
Cas is unsure if he should ask Dean about driving and with this thought the picture of Deans scarred back gets back into his mind. He really wants to ask Dean about that but he is afraid that the Winchester will lock himself in his mind even after he just got a lot more talkative.
“I think I’ll drive back home. Or find an apartment for myself if C- if he doesn’t want me in the house or something.” Dean states at one dinner a week into Cas being gone. Jess and Sam both drop their forks and loo at each other in worry.
Cas drops the clothes he was wearing the day onto his bag which is leaning against the closet before he lies down next to Dean and moves closer to the Winchester right after turning off the light. Dean buries his face against Cas’ chest before he closes his eyes and slowly starts to fall asleep.
“Hello?” he asks while closing the bedroom door behind him. “Oh, I’m Misses Forester, I’, it’s important for Dean to know.” “You can tell me, I’ll tell him when he’s awake.” Cas reassures the woman completely aware of the fact that he’s lying. “I have to inform him about the death of- my husband, Jeremy Forester. I know he was a good friend of Dean. That’s what he always wrote in his letters” Mrs Forester pauses for a second. “He came home a few days ago and died in the hospital last night.” Mrs Forester’s voice gets thinner with every word. “I am deeply sorry. I’ll tell him for sure. Thank you for calling and best wishes to you.” Cas says quietly and hears Mrs Forester sigh. “The funeral will be on December twentyseventh. I’ll let you know the exact time and place. I’m sorry for calling this late.” Cas could swear Mrs Forester started crying and Cas feels a lump building up in his throat. “Please don’t apologize Misses Forester. It’s alright.” Cas reassures her before they wish each other a Merry Christmas and hang up.
He swallowed the lump in his throat. “A couple of days ago, I was visiting the souls, making sure everything was okay and that renovations were on schedule. And they are, Anna is very time-efficient and the angels listen to her and-.”
But, Jack didn’t laugh. His smile disappeared and was replaced by a guilty grimace. “Zayn, I didn’t mean to.”
“Dean,” Sam scolded from his place. “So, Cas, other than that, does that mean that you’ll stay here with Jack?”
“Right. Angel. Got it.” Dean chuckled, sounding a little nervous. Awkwardly, he reached out and patted Castiel’s arm again and squeezed it, lightly. “Good night, then, buddy.”
“Yesterday,” Sam answered, helping himself to a generous amount of salad. “We were pretty beat so we ended up sleeping until noon.”
He took the few steps towards his partner, who was putting the meat in the freezer, and pecked his cheek in appreciation.
Dean was sprawled on his bed on top of the covers, mouth ajar with drool dripping out of one side, and surrounded by empty beer bottles.
Castiel tilted his head in Jack’s direction, not saying much and allowing Dean to make his own conclusion. It took a few blinks and some squinting but Dean immediately understood. His eyes widened and then he grinned, looking proud.
Jack winced, feeling embarrassed all of a sudden. No one else’s parents around him were taking photos.
Kelly and Gabriel agreed, of course, as well as Castiel. When Michael’s gaze landed on Raphael, the latter appeared to hesitate, still looking unsure if this was a good plan.
“I mean… it was high school. There were hierarchies and peer pressure. It was hard to make friends when you were always the new kid. But, I liked learning. History and science were my favorite subjects. I even went to college and was gonna go to Law School but… well… things happened.”
“When the Empty took me, it made sure to make me suffer. The angels and demons in there all relive their worst regrets and I definitely remember all of mine. The things with Jimmy and Claire. The Leviathans. Mary and Jack.” The angel avoided his eyes. “You and Sam.”
Dean knew he was a douchebag. There was no use denying it. He knew about his anger issues. He knew about his tendency to blame the people around him for everything that went wrong in his life. And he knew that he treated Jack like shit when all the kid wanted was his love and approval. His pride prompted him to plug his ears when Sam tried to tell him. He should have realized that no matter how many good memories he had shared with Jack, no matter how many times he called Jack his kid, he knew that his stupid anger had affected the way Jack saw himself in Dean’s life.
If this is Hell’s way of torturing him… showing him his brother and Castiel and making him believe he’s alive only to take them all away again… damn them all.
Then, Dean and Eileen had taken him shopping for school supplies – a new backpack, notebooks, pens and paper, a lunchbox, and new clothes. It was surprisingly fun shopping with them, Jack had never done it before and the experience was memorable. Dean was very good at picking bargains.
Dean cradled his coffee close to his chest. “Park sounds good. It’s still pretty early so we’ll head out in a few hours. Gotta wait for Miracle to wake up and feed him, too.”
Jack looked down at his feet, wiggling his toes against the grains of sand. Luckily, this was all in his subconscious so he didn’t have to clean up when he left it. He wondered if he had time to make a sandcastle.
Sam then opened the laptop in front of him and began to type. “I actually looked up some high schools in the area and made a list for you. How far they are from the bunker. The classes and programs they offer. Sports teams. Any scandals. That sort of thing. You can take a look and see which one is a good fit for you.”
By the time they all decided it was time for bed, no one could move. Nonetheless, they all managed to push themselves up from their seats to help clean up. Jack did the dishes while Claire dried. Kaia and Castiel wiped the tables. And Sam and Dean gathered the trash.
“Yes, well, a note that says, ‘I have to go. I’m sorry’ doesn’t exactly do much to assuage the panic your mother felt when you didn’t show up for dinner. Jack, you can't just leave without telling anyone where you are. Things are still delicate in Heaven, you know that. If this gets out to the other angels, we don’t know how they’ll react.”
Castiel patted his cheek, gently. “You don’t have to apologize. I know my shortcomings and I’m glad you told me.”
The song mentioned during the dance is "You and Me" by James TW. I was listening to the song one day and realized that it was a Destiel song so here it is.
If the outside of the school was chaotic and crowded, the inside was even more so. Jack had taken a tour of the school with Sam and Castiel when they enrolled him but the building had been empty then. Now, he could barely recognize the halls.
“I’m Agent Page, this is Agent Jones.” They both showed their FBI IDs. “We’re here to talk to you about your daughter… Kelly.”
He was definitely going to ask Casey and Zayn because he was so confused right now. But, first things first…
Was he really content with just this for the rest of his life? Hunting, drinking, and hooking up? Living in the bunker? Alone? He didn’t want to be alone. Not anymore.
At that, the couple finally burst into laughter. The heaviness of their conversation was finally lifted with that one joke and Jack felt pretty proud of himself. A bond had been formed between the three of them.
“S-Sometimes,” Jack hiccupped, as he raised his head to look at Castiel with hurt and hardened eyes.
As if realizing that they weren’t gathered in the library for a social call, Jack settled down. He chose a seat next to Castiel, who was standing at the head of the table. Beside Jack was Dean and across from them were Eileen and Sam. It was almost like a replica of Castiel’s own meeting with the archangels and Kelly. Since when was he the type of angel that headed meetings?
He watched in amusement as Dean reached Jack and started talking to the boy. They both subtly looked at the curly-haired girl before Jack was responding, possibly explaining his side. A few hand gestures and more talking later, Dean slapped Jack in the back before heading back to Castiel. Meanwhile, the boy appeared to swallow, shook his arms, and lowered his head to each shoulder, before determinedly walking towards the girl.
Castiel let out a sigh. “I can’t… promise. But, this is what I’ll do. I’ll talk to your mother and the archangels and explain the situation. I’ll tell them everything you told me.”
He stared down at all the plates arranged on the table. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles, and chocolate chip pancakes.
“You know, if you want some alone time with Cas, now’s your chance. He’s in the kitchen stirring the pizza sauce for the next two hours. He’s all alone in there. He could probably use some company.”
Castiel filled a new cup quickly returned to his side. “Where’s Miss Johnson?” he asked, handing the cup over.
From where he stood with baby Castiel still in his arms, the angel caught Dean’s eye and he nodded. For a moment there, Dean thought his brain must have short-circuited again at the sight.
Garth laughed a little and turned to the other twin, who had found Eileen fascinating. “The other is Sam.”
Meanwhile, the girls and Jack created their pizzas into masterpieces, courtesy of Claire who proposed the idea. Jack made an angel, its body made up of pepperoni, his wings from peppers, and sausage for a halo. Claire made a wolf, making it mostly out of pepperoni and adding a moon made of sausage. And Kaia’s pizza was a flower, with petals made from mushrooms, leaves from peppers, and some sausage for the center.
Also, a heads up, I will not be updating for a while because I will be going on a well-deserved vacation so there won't be much time for me to write. But, as soon as I'm back, I'll get cranking so I ask for your continued patience!
They paused at the gate. The sun shone brightly down on them as it always did. It was never nighttime in Heaven.
It sounded so well-rehearsed, as if he had gone over this speech in his head over and over, waiting for just the right time to talk about it.
Instead, he found himself putting down the box of pasta by the counter and sitting across from his brother.
He was in bed. At home. Lying on soft sheets and pillows. The sun streaming in from the curtained windows.
“No, we were thinking of moving to somewhere that’s not the bunker. Maybe an apartment… or a house. We haven’t really decided. But, uh, Dean doesn’t know, yet. I haven’t had the chance to bring it up.” The thought of his brother reminded him why he hadn’t talked to him about his plans. “Honestly, I’m kind of worried about Dean.”
“No way! It’s your first day of high school! You need the energy!” Then, he shot up from his seat again. “Speaking of that, I made your lunch.” He walked over to the counter and picked up the green and white striped lunchbox sitting there. “I made you two BLT sandwiches and there’s a juice box in here, nougat, and a jug of water. For God’s sake… I mean, your sake, Jack, do not forget to drink water, you hear me? We don’t want you coming home dehydrated.”
Dean slowly walks back into his motel room having to gather all the strength he has left now to not just fall to the ground and never get up again.
“Misses Forester called last night.” Cas whispers not knowing how to tell Dean. “What is it? Is Jeremy back home?” hope flickers in Dean’s eyes and Cas has to look away, not wanting to see the hope disappear from Dean’s eyes. “Cas?” Dean’s voice gets forced and Cas closes his eyes.
The moment they enter the living room they breathe in the smell of bacon and pancakes, Christmas music is running in the background quietly.
The older Winchester actually leaves first thing in the morning. Quiet and refusing to eat like the day he and cas first arrived on their doorstep. He promised he’ll call but Jess and Sam both know that he probably never will.
Cas sighs and looks at Dean’s peaceful looking face. “I love you.” He whispers before he slowly falls asleep too.
“Dean,” he rasps and swallows once, twice. “I might not be able to relate to you, but after you told me of your diagnosis I read some things and tried to understand. And it really hurts me when you talk like this but I can’t blame you, I don’t have the right to do it and I don’t want to. There are ways to get better, therapy-” “I ain’t gonna see a shrink Cas. Not gonna happen.” “You’d rather throw away everything than have someone help you work through your past?”
Cas suddenly pulls Dean upright so he is sitting in front of him and pulls the Winchester into a strong hug.
“I won’t ever leave you Dean.” Cas whispers, his lips trailing over Dean’s. “I won’t let you go through this alone. I won’t force you, but always remember that I’m here for you no matter what.” Dean lets his forehead rest on Cas’ shoulder, his body filled with relief.
Deans head lies still on his arm while he tries to get the pictures out of his head.                                                     There’s blood, everywhere, on him, next to him, too much, the screams started surrounding him again bringing back the never ending fear and he can’t stop it.                                              The nausea creeps back and he heaves his too heavy body over the toilet once again before the scenery in front of his inner eye changes.                                                                      It's him and his closest friend sitting in one of the shacks, backs against the wall, bars in front of them, dividing them from the rest of their unit.                                                     All the other soldiers who've been in their cell too died over the past months, one by one, got killed or starved to death.
“Jess?” Cas asks, his voice thin and shaking which makes Jess look at the man in front of her. His face is twisted in pain and his shoulders aren’t as upright as usual.
And if he’s honest he is afraid of being left alone and even if he tries not to think about it he sometimes catches himself thinking about the fact that he should’ve died instead of Jeremy. Jeremy helped so many people, never hold a gun in his hands but still, they’ve killed him and Dean wasn’t able to do anything to help the one person he should’ve helped.
He's not sure how he got on the floor, how his hands got covered in black sludge. He thinks he's trying to clean it. Off of his hands but mostly off of him. He's wiping it off his shirt and he moves to his face and it's still seeping out of his mouth and he tries to clean it but he's just spreading it more and he can't breathe and
Dean doesn't say a word, just goes to pick up the quilt and ignores the shoes sticking out and lets Sam help him carry it to the car. He ignores the worried looks that he knows his brother is giving him and the tears that are flowing freely down his mother's face. He ignores everything and doesn't say a word until they're back at the bunker and then all he says is "We're burying him."
Everyone Chuck had blipped out of existence came back. It turns out they weren't really completely gone, just in a sort of cosmic limbo until Chuck hit the reset button, which Sam, Dean, and Jack had stopped him from doing. When they'd stopped him, the clocks turned back and everyone got put exactly where they were before, doing whatever it was they had been doing and oblivious to the time that had passed for the two hunters and the nephilim.
"Dean! We've kinda been calling, you know," Sam said as he started down the stairs. "It's not Billie, it's Chuck. And everyone's gone."
His voice was raw and quiet in a way that made Sam pause. That's when he noticed Dean's eyes were rimmed with red and glassy, and they were looking at Sam but not really seeing him. Any relief Sam felt was replaced with dread. Then Jack asked,
. Cas was on his goddamn deathbed and Dean still couldn't fucking tell him that he loved him. And now he'll never get the chance.
Sam's hands are on his shoulders, trying to pull him away but there's no need because suddenly Dean jumps back and then he's throwing up his meal from that diner.
They sat there like that for a few minutes, neither of them saying anything. Surprisingly, Dean was the first to speak.
, but he also wanted to see Cas, and Eileen had already texted that she was fine and not to worry. She could be at the bunker by the time they got home anyway, so they could meet there and all be all be safe and
Stevie simply offered him a fist bump, not much of a huggy person like Charlie was, before handing him a large gift bag. Dean looked inside to find two bottles of wine.
“I… I don’t know. But, I just want… something… We don’t have to label it or anything. I just… want… something.”
“He’s here,” Sam said from behind Dean, his knife at his side. He was looking at Castiel like he could see all three of his true form’s heads. “He arrived three days ago. What the hell is going on, Cas?! We thought you were dead! Why did Jack run away?!”
“It wasn’t your fault, you know that, right?” she finally said in a much gentler tone. “It was all Chuck. And we’re all back now. So why are you taking all the guilt and responsibility for what happened when it was all Chuck? You told us we were family and, sure, it took me a while to get on board with it, but that’s how I see you now… the older brothers I never wanted but still love.” She smiled with so much affection at him that it made Dean’s chest hurt. “So, why would you think we would hold all that against you?”
The drive was mostly silent. The radio wasn’t even on. Dean was too antsy to turn it on, his brain primly stuck on the fact that they were being called into Jack’s school and it was only the second week. Jack wasn’t a troublemaker so he must have gotten hurt or… something. Did all it took to bring down a new God was by sending him to high school?!
It was a silly notion, of course, because no matter what he had done in the past, despite all the bumps and many, many, many trials that came along their way and tested their bond, Dean always came through for him in the end.
The sounds of shuffling reached their ears and they straightened up just as Mrs. Kline returned, followed by her husband.
Dean mumbled something that sounded like, “Leave me alone, Sammy” before turning on to his stomach. He was snoring again in seconds.
Sam cleared his throat. “Do you want some frozen yogurt?” he asked, before mentally kicking himself.
“Of course not!” the angel scowled at him before turning back to the kid, who was now looking a little embarrassed. “Why don’t you try on the rest of what you have, Jack?”
She was wearing a dark yellow sundress, a wide-brimmed straw hat, and black flip-flops. The beach was one of her favorite heavens. Jack often found himself here when he visited her and preferred this one the most. The spa ones were always awkward so he would either ask if she could please switch them to another location or offered to just come back when she wasn’t in the tub. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case today.
(Sam and Eileen still lived at the bunker, finding it more convenient with all the resources they needed for hunts. When they weren’t on the road, they would come to dinner.
They made their way to the front door. Sam grabbed the knob and pulled it open. Behind him, Dean must have paused because Sam heard him speak to the couple again.
Sam was getting frustrated now. “Then, what is? Are you worried that I won’t like them? ‘Cause as long as they’re not a bloodthirsty vampire or something, I’m cool with it.”
Sam felt himself smile as he looked at it, imagining himself living there with Eileen, sharing a life together. Dean could easily visit. Castiel and Jack, too. And it was close enough to the bunker that he could drive there if they needed anything.
The kid looked up as he approached and smiled. “I missed it here,” he stated. “Too often, when I was making my rounds around Earth, I was invisible. It’s nice to be noticed again.”
“Dean, please, I’m not an idiot.” Sam fixed a glare on his brother who looked away from him. “The last year wasn’t easy for you. We almost lost everyone again. We lost Cas and Jack was gone. You weren’t coping, Dean. And whenever I tried to talk to you, you would deflect or change the subject. You were always drinking. You almost died at that barn, remember?”
Dean sighed. “I don’t know, man. I mean, it’s not like we had any type of brotherly relationship, ya know? Hell, he has more of a relationship with Michael than he ever did with me and Sam. But… can’t help but think that despite all that… he’s still our brother.” He leaned back in his seat, sighing again. “I guess after we went to see the Klines to tell them about Kelly, I’ve been thinking more about the people who got involved in all our shit. Including Adam.”
“Back when Billie was chasing after us, he had the bright idea to summon the Empty to cash in on a deal he made to get Jack back,” continued Dean, sounding lost in his own memories. “And that bastard… his happiness was me. Loving me. Or whatever. He told me all these great things about me. About how I’m more than dad’s blunt instrument. About how he learned to love because of me. How ridiculous was that?!”
Other kids and their parents were stopping in their tracks to watch him now. Some pointed at Jack. He could feel his cheeks and ears reddening in embarrassment and turmoil. The movies and T.V. shows never went over this!
With a happy grin, Dean helped put the rest of the groceries away. He didn’t need to start cooking until after lunch.
It would have been adorable, if not also sad. Dean wondered why they’ve never let Jack interact with more hunters his age. Or, at least, younger hunters. (‘Cause he’s four, there were no four-year-old hunters as far as Dean was concerned.)
The crooked smile flashed at him struck him dumb on the spot, unable to move or think coherently. “Hello, Dean.”
“Yeah, they are! Fast little rascals! I can barely keep up with them these days!” Garth sounded proud and Dean couldn’t help but share the sentiment.
He had everything he needed laid out on the map table, arranged in an easy-to-reach-and-grab order. Tomorrow was Christmas Eve and they were all driving down to Sioux Falls to spend it with Jody and the girls. He had cookies all baked and packed in a Tupperware box and ready to go. And, now, he was supposed to clean his guns.
The hunter wasn’t normally this touchy and affectionate. Castiel wondered if the food and alcohol he consumed contributed to this.
“Hey, I’ll talk to him, don’t worry. We’ve been planning for months and I’m not backing out or changing my mind, okay?”
The hunter visibly swallowed but gave him one last nod before exiting the kitchen, hitting the doorframe with his shoulder by accident.
Jack smiled. “I like it. Dean thought I might have a hard time, he worries a lot about me. But, I think I’m doing okay.” He paused for a second, contemplating if he should tell them. “Actually, last week, I got detention. I punched someone.”
“He did do a good thing,” he agreed. “I know I should be disappointed as the parenting books say. But, how can I when he did the right thing? Though, he did use his full strength when we specifically told him to watch himself.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Klein, what we’re about to tell you is confidential information. And… we regret to inform you this so close to the holidays but… it’s important that you know the truth. You deserve the truth.”
“It gives you both a chance to be more involved in my school life,” he had told them as part of his persuasive argument to get them to say “yes” (he learned the phrase from a friend on the Debate Team).
Jack wracked his brain. Zayn liked a lot of girls. At least one in each of his classes. He didn’t seem committed to them, though, but Jack knew very little about dating rituals. He was only, technically, four years old, after all.
Dean never thought he would be one of those dramatic parents that burst into tears when their kid achieved something. But, right now, he felt like he needed to sit down and take it all in.
He gestured with his chin to where the teacher was now talking to a tall, dark-skinned man, who seemed much more receptive to her interest.
Dean simply flashed him a look, lightly patted Jack on the shoulder, and followed his brother out, Miracle at his heels.
Castiel settled back in his seat, as if getting ready to tell a very long story. So, Dean also leaned back, trying to get comfortable.
“You’re our guests,” Dean replied, frowning. “You can just go back out there and relax. Cas, can you bring the beer and soda out? There’s chips too if anyone’s hungry and wanna pre-game.”
Meanwhile, Sam was absent. He had gone on a hunt with Eileen so that left Dean and Castiel to chaperone. Jack had asked them to, practically begged. Apparently, a couple of parents bailed at the last minute and they needed new volunteers to replace them. So Jack volunteered them.
Sure, he knew Castiel was a good dad but Jack was practically grown and so was Claire. Yet, the angel looked comfortable and at home with a baby in his arms. Maybe he started off a little awkward about it earlier but looking at him now, he looked like a pro.
Fat load that did him, he still stayed in the life as an expert, got caught up in Dean and Sam’s mess, and died, anyway.
Castiel’s eyes widened in shock before his gaze turned soft and smiled at the baby. He looked touched at the revelation. Meanwhile, baby Castiel decided to explore the face of his brand new friend, little hands patting the stubbled chin, cheeks, and nose.
He paused, suddenly thinking about Dean because truth be told, Dean was not okay. He was far from okay. But, Jack had a lot more important things to take care of than worry about them. So, he refrained from talking about Dean.
The kid, already dressed in casual clothes and was seated on one of the beds as he waited for them to finish getting ready, nodded with surety.
This was the longest Castiel had ever talked about Jimmy. Dean knew that the man’s death was Castiel’s largest regret but he never talked about it. Not like this. So open and vulnerable.
Castiel held a hand out and the dog padded over to sniff at it before licking his palm. The angel smiled, grateful for the gift of trust from the animal and offered him some gentle pets.
With the exception of Sam, the rest of them picked up the remaining food as well as the tray of cheap plastic wine glasses they bought at Walmart the other day.
I also want to give a shoutout to my new friends and beta readers over at The Profound Bond discord!
“Then I’ll teach you. And while you’re still learning, you can do other stuff for him. We can take turns driving him to school and picking him up. You can help him with some of his homework.”
What did it say about Dean when he realized he was so used to Garth’s affections that he barely flinched? (Werewolves, man!)
With Castiel happily clutching the bag of their purchase next to him, they made their way to the clothing store where Jack and Sam had gone to. They found his brother sitting on a chair outside the fitting rooms, looking at his phone. He looked up as they approached.
Jack looked up and stared again in the direction of the teenagers. “The responsibility,” he replied. “Everyone expects so much from me. And if I make a mistake, the whole world will suffer.”
Now, it was only a matter of deciding on where to go and what major to take. Back at Stanford, he had been a political science major with a minor in English. He only had a few credits left to graduate and head off to Law School but, of course, Dean’s arrival and Jess’ death had disrupted that. It wasn’t like he could call Stanford and ask for his records since, technically, Sam Winchester was legally dead.
“Oh. I see.” Castiel placed his hands over Dean’s on his stomach, patting them gently. “Well, everyone was hungry and eager to eat.”
Castiel glared at the clear plastic bag of non-organic tomatoes in the hunter’s clutches. Why Dean was choosing to be stubborn, he had no clue. The ones Castiel had picked out were clearly the superior breed but Dean balked at the extra dollar in the price tag. It wasn’t like they didn’t have the money, they were still using Charlie’s magic credit cards. So, he wondered if Dean simply fought with him for the sake of arguing. And pride. Definitely pride.
She spun around with a sarcastic smile. “I knew you had ulterior motives! I’ll get you for this, old man!”
“Sure!” said Stevie, picking up a hand turkey, decorated in pink and blue glitter. “Wow, I haven’t made one of these in forever! Yours are pretty cool, Jack. I like the colors.”
So, the following Monday, over a bowl of “Crunch Cookie Crunch” cereal, he watched as Castiel painstakingly prepared a mug of coffee. Jack knew it wasn’t for himself – Castiel’s own mug sat across Jack’s glass of orange juice.
“I had a new purpose, Dean.” Castiel couldn’t look at him, his gaze set firmly on his shoes. “I’m the angel with a crack in his chassis. I always made mistakes. I always failed. With heaven. With you. Even with Jack. So when he brought me back from the Empty and gave me the task of rebuilding, I had a new purpose and I was useful again. I couldn’t leave because it was important for me to fulfill my duties to make up for my failings.”
He turned his attention back to his son. “Yes, let’s take a look, shall we?” He tilted the laptop in his direction so he could read.
Castiel smiles and it shoots an arrow right at Dean’s heart as he’s reminded of the last time he saw that smile.
“Not right now,” he amended, smiling in reassurance. “I just mean… in the future, you know. But, only if you want.”
Tears began to flow and the distraught boy angrily swiped at them with his knuckles, sounds of distress emanating out of him. So innocent. So childlike.
“That sounds reasonable,” he agreed. “And it will prepare me for when you and Sam return to hunting.”
Raphael’s vessel was his last female one. When asked about his choice by his brothers, he simply responded that he had grown fond of this human and her body was the most comfortable he had found himself in. The woman had also died when he died and her soul was now in Heaven. He visited her often and, without any context, you would think the two were simply twins, reuniting. His time in the Empty had definitely mellowed him out. He was less combative and more willing to listen, now.
So, Dean just shrugged and checked the time on his phone. “We can go after lunch. Cas should be back by then. Sound good?”
For the first time since the meeting began, Michael finally spoke up. Everyone turned to him, surprised but also expectant.
Castiel smiled and stood up. He leaned over to press a kiss to Dean’s temple. “I’ll leave after dinner. I’ll send Jack to let you know when the food’s ready.”
The boy’s innocence made Sam chuckle. God or not, at the end of the day, Jack was still just a child.
Dean took one last sweep of the kitchen to ensure everything was fine before bounding up the stairs to the bedroom. He swapped his pajama pants for sweatpants and tugged on his worn brown leather jacket over his sleep shirt. (He could shower later.)
“For what it’s worth, it’s an honor to love you, Dean. I don’t need reciprocation to know that. And I’m happy with our friendship.”
A bell buzzed from somewhere, interrupting him. The first bell. He still had to look for his homeroom.
The rest of their ice cream outing went without much incident. They even took a selfie together, with all three of them. Then, Castiel had pointed out another chocolate smudge on his face but this time, he simply pointed it out and handed Dean a napkin so he could wipe it away, himself. And, before heading home, they bought Sam a large-sized cup of Rocky Road. (Dean wanted to get him a small but Castiel insisted on getting the largest size in compensation for them forgetting him at home.)
Despite being a supposedly omniscient God, Jack had no clue what was going on. But, he wasn’t worried, merely curious. So, just like they discussed in his Biology class, he continued to observe them for the entire week, hoping to come up with a hypothesis and possible conclusion.
Nonetheless, Sam reached over and turned off the lamp before lying down and tugging the blankets over himself. He shot Dean one last look before sighing and closing his eyes.
Whoa, he really sounded like a dad. Something stirred in Dean’s stomach and he wondered if his lactose intolerance was back.
Flashing a small glare at him, Castiel obeyed and slid into Baby’s passenger seat. Dean turned the ignition, maneuvered the car out of the bunker’s garage and they were off.
Taking a deep breath, Dean headed up the stairs, his heart pounding with adrenaline. Whatever was on the other side of those steel doors, he was ready to shoot it. He could feel Sam following behind him, armed with his knife. He signaled for Jack to stay where he was as their last backup, just in case.
So, upon finding nothing to read on the fourth day, he turned to Dean on the fifth day with a request to visit the local library. Castiel could have flown there, himself – he had his wings now. But, he also liked spending time with Dean. And Dean liked driving. It was a win-win for both.
After breakfast, they all piled into the Impala. Dean was driving, of course, and Castiel in the passenger seat, given the rare privilege of shotgun. In the back, Jack was squeezed in between Sam and Eileen, his backpack tucked in between his legs. His stomach was fluttering with butterflies – he wasn’t sure if it was nerves, excitement, or both.
Less dramatic than he thought but, at least, for once, he wasn’t saved by some outside power he had no control over. Just by human beings. That’s fine.
“I’m getting older, Cas. I don’t have many years left in me. Hell, I’m surprised I made it this far. But, even with all that, it doesn’t feel like I’ve lived at all. But, these last couple of months, with you and Jack, playing house or whatever… I finally realized what I want.”
He did think about retiring. All the time. Especially nowadays. But, he wasn’t sure yet. He wasn't confident he could completely leave the life. But, it was a nice thought.
Tearing his eyes away from the dog, Sam scanned the grass. He found his brother yelling instructions at Jack, who had a baseball glove in one hand and a ball in the other. Dean, too, was wearing a glove. Sam watched as Jack threw the ball. It fell on the grass, a few inches from Dean, who picked it up.
He didn’t dream, not really. He didn’t even need sleep anymore but he liked doing it. He remembered the early days of his birth, how much he liked lazing around in bed in the morning and how comfortable and warm it always made him feel. He had thought back then that that must have been what the warmth of a mother's hug would feel like. And, just like back then, he missed her now.
“Of course, I’m still angry, Cas! You disappeared for a year! And when you came back and I asked you why, you didn’t exactly give me a straight answer!”
The conversation was pushed to the back of Dean’s mind, soon forgotten after his chore of cleaning his guns followed by the simple pasta dinner Castiel had managed to concoct. Then, he and Sam were roped into binging a T.V. show with Jack, something called “Shadowhunters” that involved demons, vampires, werewolves, warlocks, and Nephilim. (They laughed at the inaccuracies... until Jack asked for a tattoo. They made him swear not to get one until he was 18.)
Castiel made his way down the halls to the room that was previously used by whoever was in charge to receive and answer prayers. Jack preferred to listen to prayers outdoors, surrounded by trees, grass, and bees. Even the angels he assigned to hear and answer prayers didn’t like using the room so they had to use it for something else. Now, it served as a sort of board room for important meetings.
So, even the strict and uptight woman wasn’t immune to Jack’s charms. Well, if he could soften the heart of witches like Rowena who ended up as the Queen of Hell, he could do the same to a school principal.
Without a word, Dean stood up and walked off to look for ties. He found a rack of neckties nearby and, going through them quickly, he picked out a couple of slim black ones – plain, dotted, and striped. He walked back to the fitting rooms and found Jack still standing there, waiting.
“Everyone who has been resurrected… their next death is their final death. No more resurrections. No more cheating. If I die tomorrow, Jack can’t make deals to bring me back nor can he use his powers. I would belong to the Empty, forever.”
Hanging up, he took a deep breath to try and calm himself. There was no reason to panic. Sure, his grandparents were looking for his mother and his last conversation with them didn’t exactly go well and they believed she had something to do with her disappearance (well, he technically did but not in the way they were thinking)… but there was no need to panic.
Jack nodded. “I sped up my aging when I was in my mother’s womb. I can do it again but in reverse. I would much prefer to start high school from the beginning.”
Behind him, Sam snorts. “You spoil her you know! She wouldn’t leave me alone when I was doing the dishes!”
He hoped he wasn’t visibly vibrating as he maneuvered Baby into the garage, itching to finally be home. Beside him, Sam was talking about resting for a day or two before getting things ready for Thanksgiving, since Dean had insisted on a huge dinner with guests and everything. Dean would worry about Thanksgiving another day, he just wanted to go in, already!
Dean anxiously ran a hand through his hair. What he really wanted was another drink but he didn’t want to be too far gone. Not with Castiel here. Not when they’re finally talking about this.
The nearest park to the bunker had the best view of the sunrise and sunset. So, naturally, Sam picked that as the place to be whenever he was out running.
“Mom said she was in the softball team when she was a teenager,” said Jack, excitedly. “She tells me a lot of stories about her childhood. She had a horse for a little while!”
His phone pinged with a text and Sam reached out for it, thinking it was Eileen asking about the links she sent.
So, he didn’t know why he was so surprised when Dean got to his feet, announced that he and his new friend were leaving, sent Sam a wink, and disappeared out the door with the woman under his arm.
Zayn shut his locker door and flashed Jack a strange smile, his eyebrows wiggling. “You know… she has a little sister who’s a freshie and-.”
Jack ran away from Heaven. God ran away from Heaven. The last time that happened, Dean’s life went to shit. And it was happening all over again. What was up with Heaven’s royal family and running away from their responsibilities?! They were worse than Prince Harry and Meghan Markle! At least those two weren’t next in line to rule when the Queen kicks the bucket. (Don’t ask Dean how he knew all this. They had a lot of free time lately, okay?!)
Sam glared at him before turning back to Jack. “As I was saying, if you have a hobby or a subject or sport you’re interested in, most likely, a school will offer it as an activity.”
Their conversation turned to lighter topics. Well, as light as talking about vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and wendigoes could be. But, it was nice. Talking to Charlie about everyday hunter things like they were discussing the weather. Dean, somehow, found himself talking about Jack, how he was doing in school, his friends, and his after-school activities (baseball, Drama Club, and, yes, Robotics – the kid was all over the place).
So, for the first time in months, Jack made a difficult decision. He decided to use his powers on his friend.
Dean helped himself to some cereal and Castiel took his place across from them. They ate breakfast in silence, Jack and Dean munching on cookie pieces and Castiel sipping his coffee. Jack subtly watched the hunter and angel from the corner of his eye. Aside from the brief flirtation, they were acting fairly normal for the most part.
“They’re giving you a year, Jack,” he said, solemnly handing over the scroll that listed everything the archangels and Kelly agreed upon.
“I don’t know exactly why every time I’ve died, I always returned in Jimmy’s form. But his body was comfortable to me in a way that Elizabeth’s never was. He… He’s angry with me, you know. That night he died, when he begged me to spare Claire, I felt his anger and his sadness and his disappointment. It continues to haunt me now every time I look in the mirror. Jimmy and Amelia have been in Heaven for years now, yet, I have not had the courage to visit him.”
“This is Miss Picoult from John Adams High School. I apologize for the disturbance, Mr. Campbell, but Mr. Kline wasn’t answering his phone and you’re next in Jack’s emergency contacts.”
“Sometimes, I wish I had never sped up my growth, that I had been born an infant instead of… of this!”
“I’m sorry Dean. I lo-” “Stop! Fucking stop it!” Dean whisper yells since his voice is still gone before he turns around and walks back to the Impala, gets inside and drives away without looking back. Not noticing how Castiel finally lets himself break while watching the Impala disappear in the distance.
He actually stays in the car for a while after pulling up in front of his home. He wouldn’t say he was scared but he definitely didn’t want to run into his father. But knowing his luck this will probably be what’s going to happen.
The Novak wants to kiss Dean, show him how much he loves him but his sadness turned into anger so he just keeps standing at the door. “Cas-” “No.” he shuts the Winchester up and scans his boyfriends body, or at least what’s not hidden from the sheets.
Cas doesn’t know what to say to Dean to make it alright again. “No one leaves! Not me, not you! Did I make myself clear?” he yells and nods lightly. “And you deserve to be here as much as everyone else!” he keeps yelling, suddenly damn angry at the Winchester. Angry and really lost. He doesn’t know what could actually help Dean. He tried everything over the past week, everything he could do. And Dean seemed to get better, to get back to his old self and Cas should’ve realized way earlier that it was an act. And he did, he thinks but obviously not enough. To egoistic to admit it, and that’s where it got them.
Dean slowly walks to the living room with the sofa and Cas takes a glance at the clock in the hallway. It’s only quarter past three at night and he sighs. He can’t leave Dean alone but he should really get some more sleep.
“I failed.” Cas slowly whispers and looks up at Sam. “A friend he had over there died and I just told him. I actually promised to tell him but now he’s like this again.” Cas started crying and Sam pulls him into a short hug.
“Cas.” Sam sits down next to him, his long, shaggy, brown hair looks like he just got out of bed, though Castiel knows this is not true. He must’ve been up for quite some time now. The seventeen year old lets his head fall forward which leads to his hair falling over his eyes making them invisible for Cas.
“Dean?” he asks hesitantly. Maybe the Winchester really just needed a little space, something he can’t deny him.
“Dean I think that talking to a professional would help-“ “I ain’t talking to these douche bags.” Dean hisses and Cas shakes his head. “But Dean it-“ “No Cas. I promise you I will talk to you and I’ll work it out with your help but please, please don’t force me to see a therapist. It’s the last thing I wanna do.” Dean begs, his eyes filled with tears and Cas lets his head drop so his chin rests on his chest.
“I don’t like how they make me feel?” Dean whispers and turns back to face the ceiling. “Wanna go to the doctor to get it checked out?” Cas asks confused but he can sense Dean shaking his head. “No, they’re working perfectly fine, and that’s the problem. I’m not sure I wanna get better in that sense. Yeah, that suicidal stuff is shit but I’m quite fond with the sadness Cas. It’s-” Dean stops himself and sighs. “Sorry, I’m oversharing.”, “No, Dean. Stop it. You are allowed to open up to me, I wanna help you and even if it’s just listening to you. But please stop beating yourself up for ‘oversharing’.” Cas actually air quotes and the Winchester smirks at that.
“Sam?” Castiel finally manages to rasp out and the Winchester nods. “I’m leaving. I can’t do this.” he whispers, shame burning inside him. He failed Dean. He promised he’d be there for him but he never thought it would be this bad. The older Winchester isn’t even himself anymore and it doesn’t seem like there’s anything left of the Dean he met years ago. Nothing left of the man he fell in love with. And he can’t blame the Winchester. But he can’t watch the man fall apart further.
He doesn’t even hear Sam coming into the room trying to calm the Novak. “Cas. C’mon breathe, man.” Sam manages to uncurl him which seems to make the breathing a lot easier.
Cas has been waiting for what feels like hours until the nurse tells him to go take a look after Dean. He goes through the long and grey hallways of the hospital until he reaches the room Dean is in. He still doesn't really know what is going on in Deans mind and he plans to ask the Winchester, just not right now.
Cas would love to not have to talk to Dean about seeing some nice therapist but he can’t keep watching him like this.
“Please. I’m worried.” “Just go.” his voice seems higher but more raspy and Cas shakes his head until he realizes that Dean can’t see him. “No.” “I just- just gimme a minute.” it’s just a little above a whisper now and the Novak isn’t sure if he should just pick the lock. Something he did way too often in his life already.
“Hey, everything’s alright.” Castiel whispers and sits down next to him. He reaches out to touch Dean and comfort him but he just flinches away and curls up more on himself.
"Dean?" Cas asks again, fearing the worst but Dean smirks a little. "Man don't even think that I tried to off myself, can't let your cute little ass alone, huh?" Cas grins a little too but doesn't really believe the Winchester though he at least doesn't think it out loud and flinches a little when the doorbell rings and Sam jumps up. "I got it!" He opens the door and leads the ambulance inside.
The snow is silencing all the sounds of the city and is now lightened up in what seems like amounts of different colors, but mainly a comfy golden light which reminds of Christmas and winter days in the living room in front of a crackling fire.
“Then help me understand at least a little. You can’t bury your feelings until you break down.” Cas tries to avoid that Dean already had plenty of breakdowns over the past days.                        Both of them remain silent until Dean opens his eyes again and just stares at Cas for a moment. “You wanna know what happened?” he asks in a quiet but serious voice and Cas nods slowly a lump building up in his throat making it nearly impossible to talk.
“He fell asleep. And the nurse told me to get some fresh air and look after you. She was right you’re really not looking good.” “I’m alright Sam, I’m not the one we should worry about at the moment.” “Cas. I know this shit affects you, like a lot. And I know you need someone to listen sometimes. And I know that it’s usually Dean who listens but since he can’t right now I’m here.” Cas nods a little and is about to say something when Sam interrupts. “Don’t treat me like a kid. I know I’m not an official grown up, but with that asshole of a dad I think I’m more grown up than some twenty year old.” Cas just nods again.
“You managed to come home too.” he looks wasted but not as bad as he did the last time Dean has stayed away for a week. “Yeah.”, “That’s all? No explanation?”, “I thought Sammy told you that I stayed with Cas?” his father just shakes his head and disappears into the living room again. Dean takes this as his clue to quietly get upstairs into his room.
Dean presses his back against the wall behind him, fear in his eyes and Cas moves back, realizing he’s the reason Dean is scared.
Cas let’s himself fall back onto the bed, his head landing on the pillow and Dean keeps kissing him until both of them need a short break to catch their breath.
Because he fucked up. Because he couldn’t stay. Because he couldn’t be there when Dean needed him the most. Because he thought- he doesn’t even know what he thought. Probably some selfish thing. And it didn’t get them anywhere. It just got Dean in a wooden box six feet under.
“We’re on our way.” Cas answers Jess and smiles back at Dean. “How are you feeling?” Cas moves closer to the Winchester who shrugs his shoulders. “Not as crappy as yesterday.” “We won’t head to Manhattan today. We’ll go there for New Year’s Eve if that’s okay with you?” Cas whispers and Dean smiles and nods in agreement.
Dean remembers the two long days they got him to stay awake until he couldn’t do it anymore and had to get waken up by a bucket of ice water.
He takes out another flannel and puts it on. It’s a little too big but it’s comfortable and smells like Dean which is strangely calming right now.
“You shouldn’t have left Dean alone. He shouldn’t be alone.” the Novak mumbled, not looking at the Winchester. He only spared him a glance when he saw movement out of the corner of his eyes and accepted back the joint.
“Cas, what happened?” she stands up and stops next to Cas who just looks to the ground in front of him.
“Sammy? You here? You have to leave before they hurt you.” Dean whispers, pain and fear like a hunted animal in his eyes.
“When do you plan to head to Manhattan?” Jess interrupts the silence and Sam mouths a thank you to Jess for beginning a non-forced conversation. “I think we’ll head off in two days so we’ll be at the fune-“ Cas stops and shots a worried look at Dean who still stares into nothing, never touched the food Jess offered him. “So we’ll be there on twentyseventh.” Cas gets quieter at the end and all three of them flinch when Dean jumps up in a sudden and slams his wrists onto the table.
PANTING they pull the blanket over their bodies after they put their boxers back on. “Oh my god, Cas.” Dean whispers, out of breath, with a huge smile on his face and Cas chuckles lightly.
“When is the marriage set?” Cas asks after they finished breakfast and Jess smiles at Sam before she answers. “We plan to marry next summer.”
None of them expected Dean’s returning to turn out like this. They knew it wouldn’t be easy but the man who came back isn’t the same as when they said goodbye at the airport years ago.
“Tell me how I can help you and we’ll work it out.” “Just be here. I know how much of a stubborn asshole I am and I hate chick-flick moments, so just be there for-“ Dean stops and Cas know how difficult it is for the Winchester to admit that he needs someone to be there for him. But it’s a good sign. Dean starting to be that stubborn asshole, how he describes himself, again.
“Hey Dean.” his voice comes out raspy and he just sits down crossed leg in front of the grave. “I thought I’d- I’m sorry.” he just whispers before taking off the dog tags and breaking one of them off. He puts the necklace with now only one dog tag back around his neck and then starts digging a small but rather deep hole with his hands and puts the tag in it before he closes it. “I forgot to give them back to you, I’m sorry.”
“Maybe we would’ve found something you wouldn’t have to go this far.” “Don’t pity me Castiel. Don’t do this. I don’t need pity or something like that. I am very well aware of what I did and I wish I would’ve succeeded.” “Don’t say that Dean. Just don’t.” “Great, first you want me talking and now that I am you can’t bear to hear the fucked up truth. I am sorry that you love me. I am sorry that I probably hurt you but yes, Cas, I very much wanna die!”
Dean pulls himself closer against Cas’ chest and buries his face against Cas’ shoulder, lightly moaning before he kisses Cas’ neck. Cas moves his lips over Dean’s chest before the Winchester pulls himself closer against Cas and continues kissing Cas’ neck. The Novak moans and Dean smiles into the kiss.
He moves right next to Dean who nods and Cas moves closer until Dean can bury his face in the crook of Cas’ neck and shoulder and Cas starts stroking one hand through Dean’s hair until the phone starts ringing. The Winchester sighs but Cas gets up before Dean, leaves the room while and picks up.
The nearly finished drawing lying on top shows the front view of the Impala and Dean smiles a little at Cas who carefully wraps his arms around Dean before he lets his head rest on Dean’s shoulder. The Winchester grabs Cas’ hand and folds his fingers with Cas’ who starts kissing Dean’s neck softly and the Winchester leans into the kisses. “Thank you Cas.” He whispers, still looking at the drawing of his beloved car. “For what?” Cas stops kissing the Winchester for a brief moment. Dean smiles a little before he answers. “For this. The house, just everything.” he whispers before he pulls himself out of Cas’ embrace and steps into the bathroom. “I’ll get your bag out of the car, okay?” Cas asks through the closed bathroom door and receives a quiet ‘yes’ from Dean.
“Dean, hey, come on.” Cas’ voice is softer now and he slowly starts caressing Dean’s cheek a little to get him back into reality.
Even after the fireworks finished both stay silent, not wanting the peaceful moment to end so they just keep staring at the golden glowing city.
CAS lets Dean sleep until he’s finished packing everything they need for the road trip. When he enters the bedroom to wake Dean up he finds him awake already, sitting on the bed, the box with all his old records in it, on his lap, a slight smile on his lips. Cas leans against the doorframe and watches Dean slipping through the records. The Winchester suddenly looks up at Cas and his smile grows wider but the Novak has to realize in sorrow that it’s still not fully reaching his eyes.
“And Castiel?” the doctor asks right when he is about to leave the room. “Yes?” “No heavy topics the few days. Just try to get him to relax. I know he doesn’t want to be forced into the mental health facility but I’ll have to if he’s not cooperating. So try to concentrate in lighting him up and leave the heavy stuff for his sessions with Miss Vallens. He’ll have two of them today and tomorrow and a last one in two days.” “I can do that.” the Novak just says before he goes back to the waiting area to wait and contact Sam with the news.
Dean feels empty and cold in a sudden so he stops the running water, grabs a towel and steps out of the shower aswell.
“Merry Christmas both of them say and Sam points at the breakfast and the golden glowing Christmas tree. “This is our present for Christmas. Sam says before his and Jess’ hands fold together and a new beautiful silver ring is on Jess’ ring finger.
How is he able to comfort him when he just lost his brother. How can he comfort the guy who got his brother killed.
“Thank you so much.” Dean whispers unsure what else to say, still watching the glowing of the city from where he has one of the best memories with Cas.
But Cas can’t stop looking at Dean’s back. He still remembers the clear, freckled skin showing off his muscles. Cas starts to trace the thick, pink lashes with one finger which makes Dean shiver a little. “Sorry.” Cas whispers, regretting it immediately and about to pull his hand away when Dean leans into the touch. “Don’t. Stay, please.” the Winchester whispers and Cas moves closer, wraps his arms around Dean’s torso and presses his chest lightly against Dean’s lightly tensed back before he starts kissing Dean’s neck.
Cas finally moves again though his limps feel nearly too heavy. He goes back to the dining room aware that Jess is still there unknowing of what’s actually going on.
The sound of the bathroom door locking was like a gunshot to him, deadly and unbelievably loud. He gets out of bed in an instant and seems to be standing right in front of the door in less than a second despite the knowledge that it must’ve taken him a little more than a second.
They step out of the cat after a brief moment of silence and are now looking directly at the Manhattan skyline. The sky is dark and light snow is dancing through the air shimmering in a bright white because of the city lights before it finally falls to the ground, building a thin layer of white and untouched snow.
“What have I done, what have I done, what have I done, what-” “Dean! Hey! Look at me!” Cas yells and lifts Dean’s head a little to look into his eyes.
“But I don’t know what I’m supposed to talk about Cas.” Dean pulls his wrists out of Cas’ grip and moves his back against the door of the Impala, at least not about to leave the car anymore.
“I’m doctor Smith, I’m the guy who stitched you back up. Anyway I talked to your brother and friend here last night, and I’m gonna tell you the same now.”
The Novak starts to run his hand all over Dean’s muscled back and freezes. He can feel the thick thumbs of the scars even through Dean’s shirt, how comes that he didn’t notice before?
“I’m sorry.” he chokes on the words and Sam tightens the hug a little. “I know. Please don’t let it eat you up.” “How can you not hate me Sam?” he pulls back not understanding anything anymore. “How can you not hate me? How can you not hate the guy that got your brother there?” he yells and points at the hole next to them. Tears stream down his face and he has to collect all his strength to keep standing.
Dean heaves himself back onto the drivers seat of the Impala and rests his forehead against the steering wheel. He doesn’t even know where to go now. Cas really doesn’t want him and he can’t just go back to Jess and Sam and annoy them.
Dean soon leans into Cas’ touch and let’s his head rest on the other man’s shoulder, still not believing all this is happening for real, not after what he experienced the last years. He tries not to think about what happened and to just enjoy the view at the most beautiful house he’s ever seen.
“What was that?” he asks after he heard Dean say something but couldn’t understand what it was. “I- I don’t want you to see me like this.” the Novak chuckles a little before he smiles. “Dean, I think I’ve seen you in way worse conditions.” “I don’t care. I’m sorry you need to take care of me.” comes the quiet voice out of the bathroom.
“Cas, please stay.” Dean whispers pleading and Cas nods. “I’ll just grab something to drink. I’m back in a second.” Cas strokes his hand through Deans hair before he hurries to get a glass of water to get back to Dean as fast as possible. He sets the glass onto the nightstand next to the photos and the record player, lies down next to Dean and pulls him closer, not thinking of Dean’s new habit which is to keep his back against the wall at all cost. Dean tries to push himself back against the wall and Cas releases his grip as soon as he realizes what he’d done and moves closer to Dean who just buries his face in the crook of Cas’ neck, silent tears running down his cheeks. Cas kisses Dean’s head over and over again to calm the Winchester down until he finally falls asleep.
“Dee?” Sam whispers and shuffles closer to the bed. The older Winchester slowly opens his eyes and attempts a smile which looks more like a grimace. “Heya Sammy.” Sam sits down on the bed and hugs his older brother, looking like he’ll never let him go again.
He walks back to his car and realizes he hold his breath when he sits down behind the steering wheel again and breathes out.
The door opens in a smooth movement and Jess is standing in front of Dean who just stares at her. “Dean? Oh my god!” she sighs and wraps her arms around the Winchester who is slightly confused.
“Wanna go to bed?” he still thinks that if he talks too loud he will scare Dean. The Winchester nods and lies back down, back pressed against the wall and Cas hopes that Dean will someday tell him what happened.
“I- Cas I’m sorry. I fucked up and-” “It’s not your fault Dean. And I want you to know that this is not your fault. But I can’t do this.” the Novak has to hold back his tears when he looks up and into Dean’s face. His eyes water and it’s visible how he desperately tries to keep that ever existing mask on his face.
The Winchester looks at the ceiling for a while before getting rid of his socks, jeans and flannel and actually lies down to at least get some sleep.
Sam stood there in awe for a moment, not quite believing that it was truly finally over. Then, with light in his eyes for the first time in years, he turned to Dean, smiled, and said,
getting home, filled with the unmoving traffic of wrecked and abandoned cars from when the whole world had disappeared.
Sam burst through the bunker door, Jack on his tail, and relief flooded through him when he saw Dean sitting at the war table.
"Cas... didn't answer," Jack said, and Sam tightened his grip on the steering wheel. They just needed to get back to the bunker. Then the four of them could figure out what to do.
The one misplaced comfort Sam took in God's return was that it meant Dean and Cas were alive, despite the fact they weren't answering. Sam knew Chuck wouldn't kill any of them, not yet. They were the stars of the show after all, and Chuck wouldn't want to ruin his storybook ending.
So they do. Sam says something profound and thoughtful about friendship and brotherhood and loyalty. Mary says something about how he was like a son to her. Dean says nothing, because he
It sounded like an accusation, but there was no heat behind it, none of Dean's usual anger. There was only grief, and Jack looked like
The bottle shatters against the wall before he even realizes he threw it. It must have splashed him, because his face is wet now. And the shards of glass must have cut him through the heart, because it hurts. More than it's ever hurt before
The apologies fall off of Mary's lips as Dean storms back to his room and slams the door loud enough for the whole bunker to hear. It's the first time he's admitted it out loud (it's the first time he's admitted it to himself).
Sam whipped around to look at him. "Jack..." Somehow Sam knew the answer before the question left Jack's mouth, and making Dean say it was more than cruel, but Dean just shook his head and gasped, like he was holding back a sob.
It doesn't take Mary long to tell him. Sure, she feels guilty and needs to get it off her chest, but there's more to it than that. It's been four days of silence from Dean. He hasn't spoken more than a few words to Sam, even less to her. He's mostly unresponsive, and wholly drunk all of the time. She wants a reaction from him, needs to look him in the eyes and not just see them glazed over. She knows it won't go well, but maybe he'll at least
The barn is dark. The air is cool. The ground is hard. They need to go home. At least, they need to go to the bunker. Dean's not sure it will ever feel like home again. He doesn't say a word, just gets up, starts looking for something to cover the b- to cover him. Doesn't say a word, just takes the old quilt he finds and starts to wrap him. It's moth-bitten and too short and it's not fair because someone so pure didn't deserve this ratty blanket and this black goo and this altogether messy de-
"Dean, I need to tell you something." He ignores her and keeps walking. "It's about-" "Mom. Not now." "It's about Castiel."
When he's done, when he's got more of a handle on himself (when he turns his hunter's brain on and turns every emotion off), he takes inventory of the room. Sam and Mary are talking quietly, glancing over at Dean, tears in both of their eyes. Ramiel is gone. Crowley disappeared. Cas is-
So Chuck had taken Cas too. A pang of sadness clutched at Sam's chest, his defenses momentarily overtaken by all of the loss. Charlie, Bobby, Donna,
Dean looked like he was about to respond, but when he opened his mouth all that came out was a choked sob. He swallowed and ran a hand over his face, looking up at the sky to try and keep his tears from falling. Sam, feeling helpless, turned to a devastated looking Jack, who pulled Sam aside and explained the deal Cas had made with the Empty. Some parts of it didn't make sense, like why the Empty would take Cas when it had, when things were pretty much the furthest they could be from 'happy.' But Sam understood now why Dean never seemed relieved when they had found a way to save everyone. Because to Dean, the person who mattered most was still gone. And for the first time, Sam didn't have a clue how to protect his big brother.
She tells him everything. About working with the british Men of Letters, about her mission, about the double-cross, about Ketch. About why their angel is dead. And she waits.
Sam handed his phone to Jack, who sat in the passenger seat. "Try Cas," he told him, and Jack, who had been wordless since the silo, just nodded.
He finally looked at Sam and his face crumbled, tears now running freely down his cheeks. And he repeated it, barely a whisper,
He's downed half a bottle of beer before he even makes it to the bed but it's too late because all of a sudden, he can't keep up the front anymore and he feels everything all at once.
“You wouldn’t mention me if it’s nothing, Dean. We’re trying to be more honest with each other, remember?”
Dean opened his mouth to answer but then, seeming to change his mind, shut it again. He shook his head and got under the covers.
Even though he knew the sun wouldn’t affect him here (or even out there in the real world), Jack still appreciated the gesture.
“Is there anything we can help you with, Dean?” Castiel asked, already taking out the groceries and arranging them neatly on the counter.
“I did. She told me it was a mistake and that I needed to fix it. I was honest and told her that I didn’t have jurisdiction over Hell, Rowena did. I could review the case but… Rowena told me he was in there for a reason. He had committed several unforgivable atrocities when he was alive and felt no remorse for them. Although he truly loved his daughter, his sins couldn’t save his soul.”
And, of course, Miracle followed him to his room. That dog had found a new favorite and Dean wasn’t sure if he found it cute or traitorous.
Miracle jumped down to the floor, looking at him expectantly. Smiling at him, Jack stretched and got to his feet.
With a fake ID in hand, Dean helped him get a library card under the name “Castiel Kline”, the same name he used when they enrolled Jack. Less confusion that way. And his first library book haul, as Sam had called it, was made up of all of J.R.R. Tolkien’s works. Dean wanted to show him the movies but Castiel wanted to read the books first so he could make comparisons.
But, there was a possibility that, after many months of inactivity, he was losing his touch as he didn’t register the presence behind him. Not until familiar arms wrapped themselves around his waist and a chin tuck itself onto his shoulder.
Overall, good food and good company made for a great day. Dean was practically skipping as he made his rounds to check on all the rooms, albeit slowly since he was still really full.
Chuckling, Sam got to his feet and stretched, feeling his muscles uncoiling. “Fine. It’s late anyway.” He pinned Dean with a serious gaze. “So, you’re okay with me moving out? And school?”
“I had a really good week,” he told her, knowing that his prayer was reaching Heaven. “I didn’t get in trouble like I did last week. And I’m getting used to everything now. I really like school, mom.”
He dropped his duffle on a chair on the map table before lifting his arm to rotate it. The pains and aches from the long drive were finally settling.
No Destiel moments in this chapter but there's a lot of talking, apologies, and brothers and father-son moments.
Surprised, Castiel turned back to look at his friend. Dean wouldn’t look at him. Granted, he was driving, but not even a glance was sent his way.
Dean really hates it when Castiel is upset. He’s like a puppy who got kicked. And who kicks puppies? Monsters, that’s who.
And, sometimes, even Jack popped in to say “hello.” Castiel always kept a box of Cookie Crunch cereal for him in the pantry.)
Ever since Jack took on the powers and responsibilities of God, he could feel the presence of his great aunt. At first, Amara had been surprised to see Jack in the little space she called her own in his subconscious. Her last memory, after all, was of her brother Chuck absorbing her into himself. She did not expect to see anyone again.
Castiel patted his shoulder again before they both turned back to the laptop. As he watched Jack read through all the information, excitement emanating from him, Castiel felt at peace. He knew he was right exactly where he was supposed to be.
He would confess that when he made the choice to help Kelly and her baby, he never thought of himself as a father. It wasn’t like he had a good role model when it came to fatherhood. He barely knew his own and he and his siblings were abandoned before Castiel even saw their father's true face.
By now, Castiel was aware that it was sarcasm. So, he simply hung his head and waited for the wards to go down.
The blaring in his ear was a piercing sound that was not to be ignored. Groaning softly, Jack reached out with an arm to turn it off. He laid in bed for a minute or two, just blinking up at his bedroom's plain ceiling.
Castiel suspected, a little, that although they respected her, the archangels may also be a little intimidated by Kelly.
Jack’s voice was so low that Sam almost missed it. He finished up his text to Eileen and sent it out before giving Jack his full attention.
Raphael was openly frowning, his eyes hardened. Michael had his stoic mask on but his lips were pressed into thin line. Gabriel looked calm but his fist on top of the table opened and closed in various intervals. And, Kelly was clearly worried, her hand occasionally jumping to her lips to bite at her nails.
Staying up all night, bleary-eyed as he clicked and scrolled all over the internet. He made it to the very last page of the search results and still got nothing.
“Kelly and Jack have no remains,” Sam said, as gently as he could. “But, she left these. It’s only right that we return them to you.”
Subtly, Dean reached out and squeezed the angel’s wrist since his hands were full with a 6-pack case of beer in one hand and a liter of Coke and a bag of potato chips in the other.
It took a few seconds but, eventually, the gold faded from Jack’s eyes and guilt replaced the previous anger.
She beamed at him as he handed her phone back, feeling the prick of guilt for using his powers on her.
“Um, I don’t know.” Jack’s fingers played with the end of his fork, his waffle now a sad mess as it drowned in sugar and syrup. “I didn’t really think this far ahead. It was sort of… out of the blue.”
So, when he appeared at the beach, she had given him a hug in greeting, which he eagerly returned, missing the warmth of her affection.
Dean made his way to the kitchen, pausing for a moment at the entrance to watch his partner put away the groceries. But, never one to miss a thing, Castiel turned to him and smiled.
As he walked down the hall to his room, he spotted Castiel, Claire, and Kaia standing outside Jack’s room, wishing him a good night. Castiel leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Jack’s head. Kaia hugged him and Claire slapped his arm. Then, the boy entered his room and shut the door behind him.
Dean took them to a popular ice cream chain in the town center. He got himself a cup of chocolate ice cream, Jack got strawberry on a waffle cone, and, after much deliberation and indecisiveness, Castiel got a cup of pistachio.
“But, then, I wouldn’t have had the means to save you. And if I had the choice to go back in time and do it all over again, I still would choose to save you using the deal. That’s how much I care about you, Dean. That’s how much I… I love you.”
With a little skip to his steps that he would deny if anyone asked, Dean led the way to the front doors. Outside, they stood in silence, waiting for Jack.
Taking several more deep breaths, Jack managed to calm the butterflies in his stomach. They were still fluttering around but not quite in full force. He sent a quick prayer to his uncle Gabriel, letting him know that it was his first day of school and to please let his mother know that he was fine so far.
Jack stood perfectly still, used to Dean, Sam, or Castiel tying his tie for him. They should really teach him how to do it himself, at some point.
Maybe it was all the close calls with death. Living to see another sunrise is a blessing to every hunter, but apparently, for a Winchester, it was practically a miracle.
Castiel welcomed it, wrapping the tiny woman in a friendly hug. She looked as lovely as she ever was. Her hair was shorter than the last time he had seen her, reaching the tips of her shoulder now.
Castiel hummed in agreement. He couldn’t think of a proper response, either, his mind still reeling as his lips tingled with the need to know how Dean tasted.
The peeler almost slipped from his grasp and sliced his hand if Dean hadn’t stopped it on time. “What?”
“It was alright,” Zayn answered as he opened his own locker and getting his things together. “Wish I didn’t have practice today, I just wanna go home and chill. You got plans?”
“That’s only part of it. And, that was at the beginning. He loves you like you’re his. You know that, right?
Claire stuck her tongue out at him before she disappeared. Chuckling, Sam grabbed the basket of Bess’ rolls and some serving utensils before following them out. The mac and cheese, green beans, cranberry sauce, and gravy were still on the table so they would have to come back.
“Is Jack here?” Dean repeated, unamused as he lowered his gun. “No ‘Hi, hello, how are you? Sorry you thought I was dead but I’m actually alive’? What the hell, Cas?!”
Sam was waiting for him there. His brother looked strangely nervous, shuffling on his feet and wringing his hands. He seemed to be doing that around Dean, lately.
His hand itched to grab the whiskey bottle and pour himself another glass but he couldn’t, he wanted to at least be partially sober to hear the rest of this.
Fairy tales often depict step-mothers as evil. But, if Dean became his step-father, Jack wouldn’t really mind. He wasn’t lying when he told Dean that he didn’t think the man would want to be his father. So, calling him his uncle had been the next best thing. But, sometimes, in Jack’s own imagination and fantasies, Dean would be his father. Sam, too. They raised him, after all. It wasn’t a perfect relationship and they had a rocky start. But, Jack loved them both as much as he loved Castiel and his mother. They were his dads, too.
Dean managed a small smile, unable to meet her eyes. So he fixed his gaze firmly on the potatoes. “Yeah… yeah, she did.”
Friends. Jack had friends. Living, breathing, human (and not snake) friends who were his age (sorta) and were worried about him.
Castiel's chest ached in disappointment at himself. “I don’t know how to cook, Dean. You know this.”
He ends up staying at the hospital for several weeks. And true to his word, Castiel doesn't leave. He’s there when Dean wakes up and still there when he goes to sleep. Sam is also there most of the time but now that Dean is awake and is, for sure, going to live, according to the doctors, he goes back to the bunker to make sure Miracle is fed, watered, and walked.
“That’s good to hear,” Dean replied, pulling away and slapping the other’s shoulder. “We figured, you know, no apocalypses… no big bad out to destroy us for once… why not, right?”
And, just like that, Dean sped out of the kitchen, muttering something incomprehensible under his breath.
So, when Dean woke up gasping from another nightmare, his hand reached out to his bedside table for a bottle of beer or gin or whatever he managed to get his hands on that day. His fingers only met air and when Dean turned his head to look, he loudly groaned in disappointment to find nothing there. His bedside clock, however, boasted in bright red colors that it was only 4:15am. Yet, he was feeling wide awake.
“So, they don’t allow dogs inside,” Sam explained as they strolled down the sidewalk. “Why don’t you guys take a walk around? I won’t be long.” He looked around and spotted an iron bench wrapped around a tree. "We’ll meet at that bench, okay?”
“It makes me happy seeing him like this. Everything that he went through… everything he sacrificed… I’m glad it was worth it.”
Well, the next few months would be interesting. Sam just hoped that Dean got his feelings in order before Castiel had to leave again.
Jack shrugged. “I know. And I want nothing more than to tell them who I am. But, I know I can’t. And that’s okay, I’ve accepted it. But they deserve to know about mom.”
Dean raised his head again, his eyes squeezed shut, as if he was in pain. “What about hunting? Are you still gonna do that?”
They all turned to her, the sole human soul among them. In the past year, while getting to know their new God’s mother, everyone saw how formidable of a woman Kelly Kline was. Lucifer may not have realized it when he impulsively chose her to bear his child but she was one of the reasons why Jack was the kind and gentle soul he was. He also had a bit of that fire and stubbornness Kelly was displaying to them now. She was not to be left behind when it came to helping her son.
Castiel resisted the urge to groan but he did close his eyes to take in a calming breath. He could always feel his resolve weakening when Dean was involved, and a year apart hadn’t changed that. It was a risk coming here, in the first place, but only a very select group in Heaven knew that Jack had left. It was his mission to return him.
Sam swallowed and cleared his throat. “Kelly was under our protection and she had her baby. A boy.” He allowed himself a smile. “She loved him so much. More than the world. More than herself.”
Kelly smiled up at him. “Just make sure he eats his vegetables, especially broccoli. And watch his sugar intake, he’ll get diabetes before he turns ten at the rate he's going with them.”
Dean and Sam finished the rest of their sandwiches before leaving the Dean Cave to get ready for their day out. By the time Dean walked into the War Room, Jack and Castiel were already waiting. The kid was bouncing on his feet, excitedly texting (his friends, most likely, or Claire as they had gotten close since her and Kaia's visit). Castiel watched him with fondness. While they waited for Sam, Dean made sure Miracle had water and some food, in case he got hungry while they were out, and laid out a couple of dog toys for him.
In no time, Jack finished his worksheet. He put his pencil down and stretched, loosening his muscles. Sitting for so long always made everything ache, strange enough. But, it’s a nice kind of ache. It made him feel more human.
That question seemed to catch the angel off-guard. He was staring at Dean like he’d grown three heads or something.
After the incident with Dylan the bully last week, they had become “official friends”, to quote Casey. She even accompanied him to detention those three days. The teacher watching them was the school librarian and she was fond of Casey, so she let the teen hang around. Jack didn’t understand why detention was a punishment, though. He was able to finish his homework and study for his History test in relative quiet.
Back at the motel they were staying at, they stripped out of their dirty and soot-heavy clothing, took turns in the shower, and got ready for a night out at the nearby bar. Dean had insisted on celebrating and since his brother was in high spirits, Sam didn’t complain.
“Hey, Cas. What the hell's been going on in Heaven?” Sam’s voice was filled with worry. “Jack’s different. When I was talking to him earlier, he sounded... sad."
He most likely lost Dean. The love of his life. He lost him because of how selfish he was, because of how he couldn’t deal with the Dean that came back. Because he wanted normality or at least thought that this was what he wanted. And he fucked up. Fucked up everything.
“How long haven’t you taken them?” Cas whispers after a while and hears the Winchester turn onto his side, his back to the Novak. “Dean, please. This only works when we’re honest with each other. “I haven’t taken them since I’m back from the hospital alright?”, “So a week?”, “Yes, Cas, that’s what I just said.” Dean hisses and the Novak rolls his eyes at that.
The shower is still running and the water is already getting cold when Sam knocks at the door, he’s been waiting for Dean and Cas for an hour.
Then he picks up Dean and carefully carries him up to the backdoor to lay him onto the bench in the back.
“Cas, Dean, breakfast is ready. And Merry Christmas.” Cas wakes up by Jess’ soft voice and he looks to his right to see Dean slowly opening his eyes before he smiles at Cas. “Merry Christmas.” They whisper nearly in synch before Dean presses a soft kiss onto Cas’ lips.
“Drive careful.” he hugs Cas again shortly before the Novack gets into the Impala, puts her into drive.
“I told you to stay in the car.” Cas hisses at the Winchester who’s still standing outside and looks like Cas really surprised. “Sorry, Dean, I shouldn’t- I’m sorry.” Cas whisper but Dean just smiles lightly and follows Cas into their room. This room is bigger than the last one and the walls are made out of the same old wood as the rest of the house. The bed is standing in the middle of the room and Cas looks at Dean. “Wanna move the bed to the wall again?” the Winchester doesn’t answer and just stares with unfocused and scared eyes at something that isn’t really there. “Dean, hey, Dean!” Cas yells at Dean who finally blinks and looks at Cas with tears in his eyes.
He promised himself to stay the same he was before, to not let them change him in any way. But he broke and they made him break this promise he gave to himself. And Dean Winchester usually never breaks his promises.
The next few hours go by in blur of emptiness and the urge to just drive the car against something. But he makes it to some crappy motel to spend the night at.
They finally stop at an old but comfy looking motel next to the road. Cas asks for a room while Dean stays In the car still listening to the radio. “I got a room. Wanna grab our bags and get some sleep?” Cas asks, excitement in his voice and Dean nods with a short grin before he gets out the car and grabs their bags.
Even though he is still angry he can feel some kind of happiness take over and it makes him, well, happy.
Cas hesitates for a brief moment but then he goes back into the room and lies down next to the now asleep Winchester. He has to tell him for sure but it’ll make everything even worse. He got all the letters of Dean, he still has them in the drawer of his desk. Dean always wrote about how nice it was to have Jeremy at his side. Someone he felt safe with. He usually finished his letters with ‘send all my loving to my baby’. Telling Cas a simple but everything meaning ‘I love you’.
“Dean.” Sam whispers and the older Winchester looks up at Cas. “I’m sorry.” the Novak mumbles not able to look Dean in the eye. “I think it’s better if you just leave now Castiel.” the older Winchester rasps out his face hidden in his hands and the Novak just turns around. The front door falls shut and lets Dean flinch.
He looks up and lets the few raindrops the clouds are still spilling drop onto his face, mixing with his tears and cooling his hot and reddened cheeks.
“You couldn’t have known Sam. There was no way you could’ve. I mean it.” he can feel Sam nod a little and lean a little closer into the hug.
“He told you, didn’t he? He told me he did.” “I knew about his diagnoses, yes.” “Good. Now some check ups.”
“Woe Dean, can’t remember that you ever cooked something that actually tasted good.” Sam smiles and takes another bite of the pasta. “Such a gentleman Sammy.” Dean chuckles and smiles at Jess who observes the interaction of the two brothers with a smile on her lips.
They just sat on the sofa until Sam came home. Jess made something small for dinner, they ate in silence and the just went to bed.
Cas still tries to calm Dean’s breathing but every time he tries to touch the Winchester a little more to pull him into a hug and comfort him Dean flinches and moves his back against the door of the Impala, trying to fight Cas.
