Nemiah glanced at him over her shoulder, “Looks like you’re not talking about my love life anymore.”
“Right,” Dean mutters, tone clipped. Cas glances over at him to see Dean’s features morphed into something akin to disappointment. He doesn’t understand why.
Dean walks over to Cas, gently guiding him to his feet, “Let them take the vessels away, Cas. Give him his last rights.”
"It's alright, sunshine," Dean smiles at him, pointedly ignoring how many times he has let that nickname slip off his tongue in the past few days. "I'll be more careful next time."
"We're gonna get you to someplace warm, alright?" Dean asks, not knowing why he keeps trying to make conversation with someone who's half an inch away from death.
He didn’t stop the tears from falling because he didn’t care, and to make it better, he knew Cas didn’t care. One day, he would learn to love himself for
“Mornin'," Dean chose to make his grand entrance at that moment. "Why didn’t I get an invite to the family meeting?”
"I hear you." Cas said, and all hopes of him objecting dying then and there. "Also, you will be travelling to Italy in a month."
Sam broke into his apartment and woke him up at seven in the morning and told him they had somewhere to go. Dean almost rolled over and went back to sleep but Sam looked so excited and slightly nervous that Dean complied.
Using the momentary distraction, Castiel swung as hard as he could, the sharp slice of the metal through the air followed by the sound of a clean cut being made. The splatter of blood on his neck was followed by that of two bodies hitting the ground. Cas pried his eyes open against his own will, panting as he took in the sight of
“I’ve got a whole gram of tranquilizer in there, Cas,” she whispers, her disapproving scowl rather pronounced under the golden light of the fire currently swallowing the forest. “If this doesn’t work, I don’t know what will.”
“That’s the problem with the shit we do,” Dean sighed. “Murder looks like suicide, suicide looks like an accident and a wendigo attack looks like some bear gone wild. We can’t rule out anything just ‘cause it
Later, he’d watch Cas sit down next to him on the bed of a no name motel in Bumfuck, America, patching up Dean’s and his brother’s wounds while ignoring his own bleeding cuts, and Dean would think
"I would never." Dean said, and to prove his point, he stepped on Castiel's right foot, because his boyfriend had the maturity of a twelve year old. "Oops."
“I’m so happy for you guys.” Dean couldn’t help but me more proud, his little brother all grown up and building a life for himself.
There were no fireworks or serenades, no applause and no expectations. It was imperfect in the most perfect way. Cas’s lips were chapped and warm against his, so were the hands holding his face so delicately like he was made of glass. Dean’s heart burned and skin tingled, every fiber in him screaming
She gestures towards the couch and Dean settles down, Cas pressed up right next to him, not a spot for Jesus between them. Dean clears his throat.
“The hell, Cas?” Dean ripped his arm away from Cas’s hold. “You just let her drain you? What were you thinking?”
He has no answers to give Cas. No explanations, no excuses. Cas means the world to him and every second he spends next to Cas kills him slowly. It shouldn't hurt this much, not when he knows he doesn't deserve it. He's not drunk enough to grab Cas and kiss him but not sober enough to process everything he has been feeling for Cas since that barn in bumfuck, Illinois.
"I'm just wiped, alright?" Dean ran a hand over his face, the other gripping the wheel tight. "You know how Cas is. He just asked us to get over there quick and hung up."
"Hey, it's not that bad," Dean says defensively, but keeps the topic of the pros and cons of human existence for another time. "How did you lose your grace?"
“Is he though?” Dean asks, “We can’t babysit him in heaven, Bobby. He’s gonna end up...” The rest of the sentence refuses to make its way out of Dean’s mouth.
“Dean, he’s alright, trust me.” Cas cups his face, the look in his eyes making Dean want to run for the hills.
In that instant, if there was one thing Castiel knew for sure, it was that he would trade a billion lifetimes for this one single moment.
Cas guides them both down to sit on the floor and Dean lets himself be held, wanting to wrap himself around the feeling of Cas until his mind stops buzzing. Cas shares the silence with him, running his fingers through Dean's hair until all he can do is melt against the touch.
Another pained groan followed and Sam was stretching himself to his feet, blinking down at the corpse. "Good riddance, bitch."
"I'll catch up, Benny." Dean met Castiel's eyes, who was leaning against the table a few steps away from him. Benny gave him a look but walked away, rest of the others following along. As soon as the room emptied out, Dean crossed the distance between him and Cas in a few long strides and fell into his friend's arms.
“Believe it or not, I know how to drive,” Sam twirls the key around on his finger, a shit eating grin on his face as he backs away towards the door. “Oops, almost dropped it.”
His opponent roars out a laugh, and Castiel notices the younger man next to him watching him carefully as though he can see right through Castiel’s ruse. For a moment he thinks the stranger is going to rat him out, but the man simply keeps watching Castiel.
“Right,” Dean scoffs. Even the ringing of his own blood in his ears is louder than ever, all the air in the room suddenly not enough for his lungs. “Just leave, Castiel.”
"Nah, man. I'm good." Dean lies through his teeth. He's ridiculously hard but he's not doing this for himself. "We only have a few hours before we have to hit the road."
"My brothers and sisters…," Castiel begins, voice trailing off into a whisper, a thin line forming between his brows. "I remember being injured in the war...I can't remember what happened…"
“Olivia and Madeleine were running a fundraiser for the church the night they went missing.” Dean says, “Her friend Jane went missing the very next evening on her way back from school. Her backpack was found half a mile off the spot where Olivia was grabbed.”
Dean’s about to have a coronary right in the middle of the fucking library and Cas is the one to be blamed for it. There is a part of Dean that would give anything to believe Cas’s words—to gather it up and store it close to his heart as a hand to hold onto for the rest of his miserable life. It just seems too unreal. Yet, Cas is here, holding Dean in his arms and saying all these things with such conviction, and Dean doesn’t know what to do with everything Cas is giving him.
Dean snags his phone and heads to the kitchen, pressing down on the green button. Sam's form becomes visible on the screen, Eileen right next to him.
Cas pinches the bridge of his nose, “Alright,” he sighs. “And, Dean? Try not to look so ecstatic while you’re at a crime scene.”
“Hey, I’m not saying it’s a bad thing,” Sam said. “You being nice to him must help, especially after everything that went down last time he was human…”
"Let's keep looking then," Dean says, and adds for good measure, "Don't get me wrong, it's not because I want you out or anything. I just thought you would wanna go back to your family…"
"These are where the wounded soldiers are treated." Cas says. "There are more than I anticipated. There must have been an attack recently. "
"It sounds like the school system is excruciating," Castiel nodded in agreement, peeling off the layer of flannel Dean was wearing while Sam gathered the first aid kit to stitch the rest of the wounds.
There were those days too, when he thought about how easily he had been disposed of by the same man who ripped and clawed his way through Purgatory to find Castiel. Those were the days he would blink away the burn behind his eyes until he was too tired to be awake.
The residents of the neighborhood were all gathered around in the party hall, a situation appropriate grimness on their faces even while they chit-chatted and drank gathered around in small groups. Dean rolled his eyes and scoffed because two guys were dead and “cheering up” was the last thing anyone should be doing.
“There is a death certificate issued under the name Robin Brown two years prior,” Cas says, brows pinched as he stares at the screen. “That does match with the time we believe the spirit first appeared.”
“This isn’t funny, Dean,” Cas wretched his arm away. “I need some air. You can join me outside if you want,” with that he walked away, leaving Dean blinking in confusion.
"The sheriff's not much farther than us," Sam pulled up the files, "She lives next door to one of the victims– The Bettelheim, but the wife has gone quiet since...you know."
Sam exhales deeply, "You're gonna be okay, just get back home earlier. We'll spend Christmas together, that should cheer you up."
Charlie gasped, "That's it, you're officially one of us." She exclaimed. "Took me years to get him to call me that. Also, he's told us a lot about you. In fact, he wouldn't shut up."
Cas would call it. Cas would say what they did was their choice and there was no one to blame. But it didn't matter because Dean was angry at Cas too, because Cas had no right to be so good to him. Dean's heart was too rotten for all those gentle words but Cas kept giving and giving like it was worth it.
"You could take a vacation sometime." Dean said. "Maybe you could come with me to Kansas for Christmas break after we get back." He stirs the pot, not looking at him. "I mean, if you want to."
"You’re not a grunt, Dean," Cas said, and continued without elaborating, "When are we getting lunch?"
Cas pulled back, cupping Dean's face in both hands. "You did amazing, Dean. From what I have heard about Naomi, she has even lesser emotions than my father, and that says a lot. If she vocalized her impression then you know you did well."
"Yup, you got me," Dean chuckled, reaching out to ruffle his hair. Castiel bat his hand away, smiling despite himself.
“I was gonna say too good to not be hung up on someone,” Justin shook his head with a forlorn smile. “But, I guess it’s all the same.”
"I'm more than okay." Dean lies, though only partially. He wants Cas like he wants air, but Dean is not the kind of guy who deserves to breathe. He wants to do this for Cas, give himself over to Cas until he breaks enough to not feel anything anymore.
Under the passing light of the streetlamp, Castiel watched Dean’s eyes turn warm and tender, only for a frown to interrupt his beautiful features, “I don’t want you to die,” he murmured, as though this conversation was a secret to be shielded away from the world.
Castiel stands to his feet, and pats Tamoah’s shoulder on his way out, “You should meet Dean sometime.”
“I’m gonna take all seven.” He muttered, shoving them into his suitcase. Charlie put her phone into her pocket and walked over to Dean.
“I’m self sufficient, thank you very much,” she retorts. “Besides, you’ve done enough for me and Ivan already.”
"Sex is not the way to do that, Dean." Cas leans his forehead against his. "Not when you're hurting like this."
"That was Jimmy's choice, not mine," Castiel mumbled, tugging his hand away from where Dean was holding the sleeve of his trenchcoat.
"I know all languages," Cas throws him a split second glance, only to turn back to Eileen. "How are you and the child doing?"
"We'll go over to the morgue to check out yesterday's vic," Dean dried his face on a towel. "Then maybe interview everyone who was there yesterday. It's the only lead we've got."
Dean tries not to shudder at the thing twisting and twirling in his palm. He closes his fist around it, willing away the tears threatening to spill, "Thanks, Cas. I'll keep it safe."
Dean should have pushed him away, should have told him to go. But not another apocalypse would have made him want to leave the comfort of Cas’s arms. Dean had always been the one shielding his brother from a fire and then another. He was the one jumping in front of someone of the vamp or ghoul of the day. He was always the sword and the shield. For the first time since his mom died, Dean knew what safety felt like being in Cas’s arms. It wouldn’t be long before the adrenaline crash jackknifed into his skull and he’d regret a lot of things including his own existence, but right now Dean knew he was safe. Cas had assured him he was.
Dean looks to Eileen for help, desperately asking her to pull out the listen-to-me-because-I'm-your-wife card. Sam opens his mouth but Eileen beats him to it.
"Hey," Dean calls softly, still somehow managing to startle Cas. "Shower's the last door down the hallway."
"Got one of my own now, don't I?" Dean grins at Cas, ignoring the empty weight the words leave on his heart.
"You're right," he said finally, voice barely a whisper. "You did pull me out of an emotional hell. In a way, you still do."
“Moreover, it’s a rather bold accusation to make.” Camael says. “If we point fingers at each other blindly, I’m sure that will damper the morale.”
“Fine, I’ll go shopping then,” he rolls his eyes, no heat in it. He raises a brow at Eileen, “Aren’t you a little bit too pregnant to be walking around?”
“Bie me, ol mah.” An unfamiliar voice mumbles incoherently and Castiel frowns, the language not being a part of the thousands of languages he speaks.
"Jesus, Cas," Dean groaned, turning to hide his face in Castiel's neck, and he let him this time, knowing how much Dean struggled to accept compliments.
Sam rolls his eyes, "You've been to hell." He reminds, helpfully. "Anyways, the guy was divorced. Wife lives in Montgomery."
“What were you expecting?” Dean snaps, “For us to kiss and make up just like that, ignoring all the crap I did and everything I made him go through?”
“I did have my reason,” Dean chokes out, sounding as though he’s trying not to get angry. “I’ll explain it to you. All of it-”
Sam was usually the patient one while dealing with interviews but even he was getting antsy after waiting for nearly an hour to talk to the sheriff. Finally after another ten minutes, the door swung open and a woman walked out. She was young for her position, but looked like she had seen her fair share of shit. Her brown eyes zeroed in on Sam straight away and he couldn’t help but squirm a little under the scrutiny. He walked over to her, thanking every God that was listening for Dean not being here.
Dean’s three seconds away from smashing the remote on the floor when footsteps come echoing from the hallway. Cas pauses at the door, tilting his head at the screen.
Dean mumbled a goodnight, crushing down the part of him that desperately wished Cas would ask him to stay, even if for another minute. He recalled the times when Cas, in his whole 'Holier than thou' demeanor, sat at the edge of Dean’s bed in some dingy motel room and kept his nightmares at bay. He wanted nothing more than to be there for Cas in the same way, but honestly there was no chance Cas would want that. If it weren’t for Dean, his friend would still have been an angel who wouldn’t have had to deal with nightmares. Being a Winchester, even an honorary one, meant sacrifices for each other if they wanted it or not, and Cas too ended up roped into their shitty bargain of a life. At least, Sammy didn’t have to bear the guilt of hurting another member of their little unit, and Dean had enough space in his little chamber of regrets to shove in the guilt of stripping Cas off his grace. The sanity he gained through Cas’s sacrifice, as selfish as it is, doesn't seem so worthy in that moment.
"Uh, yeah. Cool," Dean sputters, inwardly slapping his own forehead. "Don't forget to grab your coat, it's snowing a lot today."
“That’s stupid, Cas.” Dean takes a step closer, “You don’t need to do squat if you don’t want to. What are they gonna do, kick you out of the baseball team?”
“Shh, relax.” Dean whispered, a hand coming around to wrap around his cock, pumping slow strokes, which resulted in anything but relaxation. Castiel’s head was swimming in the euphoria of Dean’s touch but he willed his muscles to relax.
"Awh, you got me a gift," Dean grins as he extends his palm for Cas. Something cold and solid lands in his hand, and he looks down only to have his breath get caught in his lungs. "Cas, this…"
He tried to school his features before responding, not knowing how well it was working. “You shouldn’t have done that, Cas.”
"Well, there isn't much we can do about it as long as we're living in a capitalist society," Castiel fixes Jaime with a look, telling her to be more encouraging. "So, good job, Ivan."
Until the nurse comes to collect the baby away for her check up, Dean holds her close to his chest. She sleeps peacefully no matter whether it's her mother or her uncle holding her. Eileen naps for a whole of twenty minutes before Ella starts the
"I'm fine, Cas," Dean turns to him with a weary smile. "You think we can afford one more quick trip down there?"
Just as one of Eileen’s contraction induced scream ends, Sam rushes in through the door, eye wildly scanning the hallway.
“If it weren’t for Andrea, I’d think you were flirting,” Dean grins in an attempt to lighten the mood. If brooding about what he can’t have was the plan then Dean would’ve just stayed at home.
He jumped when a finger grazed against his cheek. Dean might have noticed as he snatched his finger back faster than it came.
Cas emerged from the bathroom as if on cue, dressed in a dark green button down and black jeans that stuck to thighs snugly, and Dean about invented nine new swear words. Cas’s thighs, and his entire immovable object of a body was like a holy revelation to Dean, and he never wanted to burn that damn trench coat more for hiding it all away.
Cas rolled his eyes, even as he stared at Dean with a fond smile as though they weren’t at each other's throats ten minutes ago. “We’re not in Hogwarts, Dean,” he said.
"We are trying to eliminate a threat that is Raphael and everyone under him. Rescuing Sam Winchester is part of our duty as humanity's protectors, and that is exactly what we are going to do." Castiel grits out. "If anyone has any suspicion regarding where my loyalties lie, you can walk out of this room and join the enemy forces right now. But remember, I will be the one to hunt you down."
“Dean, ahh, yes,” Castiel gasped, dropping his head back as Dean’s strong hands helped lift him up and pull him down again and again.  Dropping forward against Dean, Castiel kissed him desperately.  Pressing into Dean brought the added element of friction to his aching cock as it was trapped between them.  Castiel was too caught up in the fullness of Dean inside him and the way he was rubbing along Dean’s stomach to maintain the pace properly.  Dean noticed and squeezed his arms around Castiel, pulling him forward and then thrusting up into Castiel rapidly.
The incredulous look on Sam’s face, was the only warning Dean got before Sam’s exasperated outburst.
Castiel ran a hand through his messy hair as he slowly took Dean in, dragging his palm over his chest and biting his lip as Dean filled him up.  This was what he needed.
Though he was determined to do so, Castiel had been unable to find and rescue Dean’s friends.  Crowley had hidden them well, no doubt with angel warding.  By the time Castiel caught up, Dean had found Ben and Lisa, but things had not gone smoothly.  Castiel appeared to Dean in the hospital where he was sitting at Lisa’s bedside.  It reminded Castiel of when Dean had sat next to him, watching over as Castiel healed from Sam’s attack.  Dean had said Castiel was important and he found himself wondering if it was still true.
It didn’t take long to put the necessities into place. Sam didn’t get tired. He never slept. Night was the perfect time to move forward with his plan.
Cas starts to take his legs out of the stirrups, but Dean stops him, abruptly deciding he’s not finished. He squats down and licks into Cas again, tasting himself while Cas sighs contentedly and pets at his head.  Dean saves a little warm cum on his tongue to kiss back into Cas’s mouth, before he helps him free his legs, affectionately rubbing his feet and shins in the process.
Dean speeds up his hand, twisting his wrist the way he knows Cas likes it. Cas raises his hips, tries humping upwards into dean’s slick latex grip but he can't get the leverage he needs with his feet in the air and it only makes him frustrated.  Still, Dean knows Cas is getting close—he can tell from the way his body slowly tenses—so he works his cock furiously for another minute before completely letting go.
They ate and Bobby looked for suspicious activity on the police database with Sam’s tablet.  Castiel decided to search the town, but realized he was blocked from his power.
He pulled into Castiel’s lawn, the house standing out among the others from the lack of decorations. Cas answers the door on the first knock.
Waking up to an empty bed after knowing there was a warm body next to him all night long was disappointing as it was relieving, because the warm body wasn't just anyone. The body belonged to someone who Dean loved, someone who sat with him through his nightmares, rubbing his back and murmuring reassuring words that felt wrong to his ears. Dean's mood only plummeted when the first thing he saw after stepping out of the motel was some dickhead leaning against Baby.
"He's way out of your league anyways. Put a ring on him before it's too late." She snorted, and Dean knew the moment was over. "You're only a three."
"Woah," the man grabs his arm before he can fall on his ass. "You alright there? You look a little pale."
“I should have been more careful,” Cas murmurs, his voice cold and distant. “I should have stayed... this is unfair…”
“Alright, that’s enough,” he mutters, pushing past her. “I will be outside when you feel like going home.”
“We’re not sure, Commander,” Camael says, looking scared out of his wits. “I was on my way back from
"He was someone I looked up to, someone who I could depend on," Cas says. "He told me I was different, and asked me to embrace it when the time came, I'm not sure what he meant but the war happened and..."
The flight ㅡ to his friend's dismay ㅡ lasted another two hours before the Captain announced the landing. Dean looked incredibly pale, lips muttering something inaudible.
Nadia rolled her eyes, turning to look at the ocean with a smile on her face, the setting sun highlighting her features beautifully.
“I practically live here,” Nadia replied, gesturing down at her pajamas. “I hate seeing her like this. She used to be so full of life…” she ducked her head to rub her eyes. “Dammit.”
Dean swallows, eyes burning as he clutches the wheel tighter, trying to shake himself out of the morbid turn the conversation has taken. Cas always knows the right things to say and Dean wants to pull over and bury himself in the man's arms. The ache pokes and prods at his chest harder each time but he doesn't do anything. It's better this way.
Dean chuckles, extricating himself from Cas and sits up on the bed. Cas mutters something under his breath that vaguely sounds like his name. Dean leans down, pressing a kiss to Castiel's temple, earning a soft sigh from the man beneath him.
They said their goodbyes, and Sam managed to duck down to kiss Nadia’s cheek, straightening up to see his brother grinning at him like he had won the lottery. Dean’s resolve lasted three whole seconds before he sing-songed “Sammy’s got a crush!” as they left the door, and Sam elbowed him hard enough to make his brother yelp.
“You can call me for anything, not just cases,” Cas says, balancing his phone between his ear and his shoulder as he pours himself coffee. “How are you? How is everyone at the shelter?”
The truth is, Dean has thought about so much more than just a beach vacation. He has thought about kissing Cas on the rooftop of his office in Chicago, the city lights stretching far and wide around them, the glow having nothing on the bright smile painting the angel's face. He has thought about taking Cas to watch the stars, their hands and legs tangled as they stare at the sky, back resting against the hood of the Impala, to press kisses down the stretch of warm skin on Cas' neck in the backseat; to kiss him at the movies and to hold his hand at the goddamn farmer's market.
Shaking himself out of his thoughts, Castiel keeps driving, for letting his ghost linger around in his own past is never a good idea.
If Dean was able to pull Cas towards the ladder and up to the exit, it was only because Cas allowed it. Dean knew how strong Cas was, how he wouldn’t be able to make him budge if Cas wouldn’t let him. He took it as a sign to keep going.
It was always busy at Harvelle’s Roadhouse. Although the sight of it would make you think the 1800s haven’t passed yet, with wooden planks and corrugated iron seemingly being the only building materials used for the interior. Though you couldn’t find a single hunter who would complain about it. After all, this was one of the few spots a hunter could put his feet up after a long day of hunting monsters. That was a figure of speech of course because Ellen would kill said hunter were he actually to put his feet on a table.
Boys are busy talking in this chapter and they're not done yet, so I hope this was interesting enough.
“Dean,” Castiel said lowly, with emphasis, before he was forcefully kissing him and Dean fumbled to drop the tumbler he had been holding onto the table at his side.
“Okay.  I have no idea what Sam said to you… during that.  But he was a soulless asshole, so it’s probably safe to assume that everything he said was a lie or purposefully cruel.  He was
Trying to ignore the cloying words Dean was murmuring—words Castiel was confident the hunter would likely never utter on his own—Castiel drove the thought of killing this fae creature, right now, in the car, from his mind.  To do so would risk damage to the car and possibly to Dean if they crashed.  As it was, Dean wasn’t technically in danger at the moment.  He had already been infected and that was the only harm the ghancanaga really caused.
They got up to leave and Dean stole Castiel’s beer, downing the last of it so it wouldn’t go to waste.  For some reason it hadn’t seemed like a strange idea until Sam looked at him with his eyebrow raised.  Well, whatever, it was perfectly good beer. When they got  back to the motel, Dean invited himself and Cas into Sam’s room.  He wanted to play poker with them both, but Sam opted to waste time on his laptop.  So Dean settled for teaching Castiel how to play blackjack, which the angel grasped annoyingly quickly.  When Dean lost his fifth hand in a row he heard Sam snicker and wondered if the angel was cheating.  He’d have to play again with Cas sometime and see how he did then.  If he was really that good, they might have to make a special trip to Vegas.  Taking an angel to Sin City, yup, nothing wrong with that idea.
Then Castiel was gasping Dean’s name and desperately kissing him, hand low on the hunter’s stomach, holding him close as he rocked erratically into him.  Hurtling forward one final time, Castiel came with a shout, pressing into Dean and clinging to him.  His hips stuttered and slowed jerkily, as he panted into Dean’s back.
“You don’t have to explain, man.  It’s fine.  I’m glad you said something,” Dean gave Castiel a small smile.
Sam glanced at Dean before he responded, “Well, you can be the one to stab him then, Cas.  You’ll have your angel blade and I’ll use our iron sword.  Bobby thinks that’ll work too.”
Sam had only been gone a few minutes to wash his hands in the bathroom, but when he got back there was a  beer for each of them at the table.  Castiel was dutifully drinking his and watching Dean every time he brought the bottle to his lips.  The waitress came, smiling at each of them as she set a tray with a dozen shots on the table.  Dean hadn’t wasted any time while Sam was gone and he smiled wickedly across the table as Sam frowned at him.  The waitress took their orders, smile faltering when Castiel requested nothing.  It was sort of amusing, considering Dean had slid four shots in front of each of them.
“I understand, Dean.  There were things I didn’t know how to say to you, that I clearly should have.”
“Shit, that’s good, Cas.  Get back up here,” Dean growled, tugging at Castiel, who crawled up and kissed him.
Dean could feel Cas softly touching his neck and heard a whispered ‘thank you’ as he finally drifted off.
Castiel’s reaction had jolted Dean out of his sleepy, grogginess, but he was thinking some coffee would do him wonders right about now.  And a shower.  A hot shower would be great.  Dean froze at the knock on the door, he recognized it as Sam’s.
Castiel wasn’t sure he cared for the scrutiny.  The sound of footsteps on the stairs signaled Sam’s arrival from the basement.  He caught Castiel’s eye and blushed a little, looking away, but Castiel hardly noticed.
“Yes.  I spoke with Dean.” Castiel shifted his gaze to Sam and if it hadn’t been such a bummer of a situation, Dean thought the overtly concerned expression on Sam’s face might have been comical.
“Dean.  I want…,” Castiel began breathily, and Dean waited, feeling a thrill of excitement that Castiel was verbalizing wants.
“That’s the same damn ransom note that Crowley handed me.  You know that, right?” Dean spoke angrily over him.  “Well, no, thanks.  I’ll find them myself.”
“I know that doesn’t normally deter you, but try to control yourself,” Castiel said without lifting his eyes from his tablet.
Allowing the shifter to get closer, Castiel was prepared the next time the iron came whipping in his direction.  Ducking slightly Castiel brought his arm up to block the impact.  It struck him too close to his wrist and Castiel felt the bone break and his skin sear from the heat. Ignoring the pain, Castiel caught onto the iron with his other hand, yanking it down with all his strength and even letting himself fall to his knees so he could throw his weight into the movement.  It was enough to pull the shifter off balance and he tumbled down across the flames, breaking the ring.
Dean was getting a terrible headache.  He didn’t know what to make of any of it.  His traitorous mind was insisting that Castiel must like him and he suddenly remembered Uriel saying the same thing ages ago.  Well, yeah, okay so Castiel liked him, that was obvious.  They were friends, they had to like each other, he reasoned.  Besides Castiel saved him from hell, saved his ass and Sam’s several times.  The dumb angel was always helping him, had rebelled against heaven for him, Christ he had friggin’ died twice for Dean…
“Just you wait,” Sam says as he hurriedly gathers his things and leaves the room. Confused, Dean leaves too.
The angel was still dressed in his new clothes and Dean thought he looked friggin’ sexy, but then Dean thought he looked sexy in his regular outfit and in Dean’s clothes and in nothing at all.  Dean casually carded his hands through Castiel’s hair, tangling his fingers in the dark locks.  Dean loved the angel’s uniquely Cas scent and how he tasted like no one else.  The feel of Castiel’s lips parted around his was so fucking perfect.  Dean really didn’t know when he had decided that, but it didn’t matter, he just wanted to keep their lips locked.
Dean was going for another beer when he realized the second cooler had sandwiches and he grinned appreciatively at his brother.   Sam really had planned the day out well, Dean thought as Castiel returned to his side.  After a few more missed opportunities that involved replacing bait, Castiel managed to reel in a fish on his own line while Dean reminded him what to do.  His fish was even smaller than Sam’s, but Cas seemed pleased as all hell and Dean couldn’t stop grinning at him.  He was such a dork.
When Dean stumbled upon Castiel’s prostate, the angel fell back against the bed and writhed under Dean’s touch.  It was awesome and Dean committed the spot to memory, pressing the pads of his fingertips upwards to hit it again.  Castiel whined Dean’s name and trembled.  Maintaining the pace of his fingers, Dean quickened the movements of his mouth, sucking hard and fast.  He could tell Castiel was close, so Dean tried to keep up the rapid motions.
They spent another hour or so driving north.  Dean dismissed the idea of stopping somewhere to eat since he would be the only one with an appetite.  Instead, he pulled through the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant for burgers to-go and while he was waiting at the window he texted Sam to say they were stopping for the night.  After Dean got his meal, he pulled in at the next motel that looked like one he and Sam would normally choose.
Stumbling slightly, Dean shook off Castiel’s hand from his arm and the angel moved in front of him again.  Bill had cursed at the non-reaction he got from Castiel and he jabbed the pointy end of the broken pool cue at him.  The angel let himself be struck in the arm as he stepped towards Bill and punched him definitively.  The man’s head snapped back at the impact and he went down heavily.  When Castiel shot a dark look at the third man, he took a step back.  He hadn’t really seemed very interested in fighting as far as Sam could tell.
“I guess so, if sons of mine are keeping company with some supernatural monster,” John said.  “Why don’t you give us some privacy,
“What was I supposed to do?” Dean raised his voice.  “Let T-1000 walk around, hope he doesn’t open fire?”
Without taking his eyes off the road, Dean shrugged.  “Sounds good to me.  What, did you think I was lying?”
“Take it easy, Cas. I got you.” Sam stretched and pumped his fingers in and out. He glanced towards Castiel’s face which was hidden from his view against the cement floor.
Toying with ideas for his next move, Dean decided to trust Castiel to tell him if he didn’t like something.  Dean was slowly kissing Castiel, sucking his tongue and lips as he laid his hands on top of Castiel’s and gradually raised them above the angel’s head.  He had gone slow to give Castiel plenty of time to object.  Dean broke the kiss.
He was safe.  In that moment, Dean knew he was gonna kiss him, he really was, it didn’t even fucking matter that Sam was right there.  Dean took a couple quick steps forward and pulled Castiel into a tight hug.
“Usually don’t see ya down here until Dean is,” Bobby said, sitting across from Castiel with his mug of coffee.  “Everythin’ all right?”
Castiel shifted his attention towards Dean as Bobby folded the paper away, focusing on his breakfast.  Dean was grinning broadly at Castiel, who twitched his lips into a brief little smile, before Dean’s eyes returned to his food.  If Castiel was smiling at Dean while he poked fun at him, then Sam could take it as a good sign.  He just hoped Dean was talking things through with Castiel.  Obviously, the angel was very willing to forgive, Sam just hoped Dean was actually making the apologies.  He was a little concerned that Castiel’s fondness towards Dean might blind him to the fact that Dean had been a real jerk recently.
The angel took it upon himself to find other ways to surprise Dean however, as he found out later that morning.  Dean had just stepped from the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist when Castiel was suddenly in the bathroom, startling Dean and throwing his arms around Dean’s neck to hurriedly kiss him and press him up against the counter.
Unfortunately, their friend was undoubtedly out of control and Sam reluctantly admitted to himself that they had to do something.  Castiel couldn’t be allowed to continue in the same vein, the body count was getting too high.  When he approached Dean and Bobby about it, they agreed, and their quick brainstorming session led to one feasible option—they had to bind Death.
Bobby got the first of the action and as soon as his bobber dipped infinitesimally beneath the surface, Castiel alerted him to the fact by saying his name in an exuberant whisper.  Dean wondered if he would have shouted it if they hadn’t told him that it was important to be quiet.  Bobby waved Castiel over and let him try his luck, talking him through trying to set the hook so he could hopefully reel a fish in.  They weren’t successful, but Castiel’s excitement over that first nibble had them all smiling.
Confused, the hunter blinked at Castiel, then he remembered that the last time Cas tried to say he loved something Dean had cut him off and responded jerkily.
“Care to explain what the hell that was?”  Sam demanded, waving a hand back towards the door.  “Were you really just threatening my dad?”
“I’m no longer preoccupied with the war in heaven.  I can allow myself to be… distracted,” Castiel finished deliberately, giving Dean a meaningful look.  Dean raised his eyebrows, cottoning on.
Castiel remembered the day he’d gotten his orders, not unlike many others he’d followed, blindly, before. And yet, he never did manage to oblige to this particular one. Since the first moment he’d set foot in the city, long before the walls held angel warding, he had been doomed to fail.
Despite the differences, it still felt horrible when Fake Castiel was killed by an angel working for Raphael, who had followed them to that warped reality.  The whole thing had rattled Dean, even though it wasn’t
important.  So it matters.  And besides Sam is my responsibility, if he’s capable of—of attacking people he knows, it’s kind of a problem.”  Dean’s hand had found the back of his neck and he ran it forward through his hair before dragging it down his face.
Dean caught Castiel’s ass with both hands, giving it a squeeze. Then he turned Castiel around and pushed him so he was bent over the table.  Castiel propped himself up on his forearms while Dean grabbed the lube and then admired the view.
Cas lets him look in his ears and mouth, playing along when Dean uses the tongue depressor and tells him to say, ‘ahh.’  He obediently keeps his mouth open when Dean decides to slide his finger past his lips in the name of science.  First one finger then two, pressing them against Cas’s tongue and slowly mapping out the inside of his mouth until Cas grows impatient with the exploration and sucks them both in further.
Sam marveled at how a man with a broken wrist could still be so cocky, but he should have been more focused on Dean, who immediately ducked under Castiel’s arm and proceeded to punch the large man in the face.  Unable to punch back, the man grabbed Dean’s shirt with his uninjured hand and kneed Dean in the gut.  Dean doubled over a little at the impact and the man stepped back, still holding Dean’s shirt.  Overbalanced, Dean tumbled into the man and they both went down in a heap, grappling together.
“Nothing.  Sorry. I just—I don’t know what I’m doing here,” Sam sighed, briefly covering his face with both his hands, before he smoothed them through his hair, tucking the too-long strands behind his ears.
And okay, Castiel wasn’t wrong, but it was more than just that.  Dean couldn’t let these souls kill the angel.
, so Dean instantly feels a flutter of happiness.  Maybe this suckfest is just another fucking nightmare he can put to rest. It would explain the increasing dread he’s been feeling over one little ghost and how she’s been able to be all over town.  Without thinking twice Dean grabs at the lapels of Cas’ coat  reeling him in close for what’s sure to be the main event of this doomed dream.
Fortunately, Castiel showed up to tell them it hadn’t been a dream at all.  At least that cleared up one thing, but Sam definitely still had questions and knew Dean likely did as well.  With a pang, Sam remembered that 50,000 people had been on Fate’s list to kill, including Ellen and Jo and everyone that was somehow or other alive due to the ripple effects of the ship not sinking.
After his conversation with Dean, Sam felt fairly certain that Dean was thinking of Castiel as more than just a friend.  He had expected Dean to get angry, but his brother had also been stammering and blushing through his denials.  If he didn’t love the guy, he must have at least been in agreement that Castiel seemed to love him.  Sam wasn’t sure what it meant, if angels could love romantically, but Castiel had often proved himself to be different than other angels.  Sam wished he could have spoken to Dean about it sooner, but he had been angry with Castiel for lying too.  It all seemed unimportant compared to what Sam now remembered.  He wondered how Dean had managed to stay upset with Castiel through it all, but his brother had never been one to forgive breeches of trust easily.
When Castiel went to Dean, the hunter was torturing demons for information on Ben and Lisa.  The scene was disturbing to Castiel, though he had seen Dean torture demons before.  The garage smelled strongly of blood.  Conflicted, Castiel remained hidden, uncertain of what he was going to say.  He didn’t have long to reflect on how to approach Dean though.  The demon had escaped the devil’s trap and quickly got the advantage over Dean, hand at his throat.  Castiel didn’t hesitate, he knew the panic of not being able to breathe too well.  Smiting the demon took but a moment, and Castiel could only stare at Dean, willing words to come to him.  The hunter spoke first and he was clearly still angry.
An Aerosmith tape he hadn’t listened to in forever came booming over the speakers and Dean decided it was a decent choice.  Of course, when choosing from his collection, it was impossible to go wrong.  By the time the fifth song rolled around Dean remembered exactly why he hadn’t listened to this particular tape in a while.  He glared around at Sam who was trying to keep a straight face as the opening notes of the song ‘Angel’ played over the speakers.  Dean ejected it before any of the lyrics were sung.
Silence fell between them and Dean studied Castiel, noting the exhausted quality of his expression.  The angel had not closed his eyes yet, content to stare at Dean until he fell asleep.  A thought had occurred to Dean, as he reflected on the kiss and he felt silly, but asked anyway.
“I’m going to check your lymph nodes,” he says, raising his hands to Cas’s neck and gently touching both sides with small circular movements of his fingers.  As Dean carefully caresses Cas’s neck he gets a bit caught up in staring at his lips.  Usually when Dean stands so close like this, fingers flitting over Cas’s pulse, thumb dipping into the notch at the base of his neck, he’d be ready to dip in for a taste.
Dean made for the door and Castiel followed him, edging through the crowd.  Exiting the bar, the crisp, quiet night air felt welcome after the warmth and noise inside.  They climbed into the Impala and Castiel watched Dean start the car before speaking.
Castiel continued to tenderly brush his hand along Dean’s back and kept it up long after the hunter had dozed off.
“I don’t know, Sammy.  Just different.  I mean…not like himself.  Different around me—or us,” Dean was looking exasperatedly at the ceiling and shrugging, holding his hands spread in front of him, trying not to spill his coffee.
The light was still on and it was closest to Castiel, so Dean flung an arm over his eyes, rather than ask the angel to turn it off.
“Cas.  Look, I was wrong.  I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have done that,” Dean said, lifting his hand from his hip and waving it in a small placating gesture for emphasis.   “I know you’re pissed.  I get that, but maybe we could just, I dunno, forget it?  Go back to the way things were, ya know?”
He installed a lock on his bedroom door, but he didn’t really expect to need it.  Apart from that… incident, Dean had always respected his privacy.  It was just for a little peace of mind.  Now he could continue sleeping in the nude without having to worry.
“Look Cas, you need to lock this up now.  I don’t know if you have,” Dean paused, steeling himself to say it, “feelings for me or a weird angel crush or what, but whatever it is, it ain’t gonna happen.  So, I’m sorry if I confused you, but you gotta drop it.”
He’s got enough memories of kissing that it’s awesome. Almost feels real, and Cas is fucking kissing back so it’s automatically turning his nightmare into a wet dream. Now when Dean wakes up he's half hard and able to drop off again relatively easily. Which is a helluva lot better than waking up screaming and sweating so he’ll take it.
“Yes,” Castiel agreed at once and Dean smiled around his cock, before pulling it with a pop from his mouth.
Dean still had no idea where Cas was going with this—stating facts everyone already knew.  He shrugged off his jacket, throwing it on top of Castiel’s, and waited.
At the moment, Dean was just content that he was able to provide some level of comfort to his friend.   His attitude and actions concerning Castiel had been pretty shitty recently and Dean hadn’t known if they would be able to get past the damage.  It was such a normal defense for him to rely on his anger in situations he couldn’t control.  It was a way to shield himself from hurt and Castiel’s betrayal had hurt like a bitch, especially since Dean hadn’t seen it coming.  Still, he shouldn’t have clammed up and kept Castiel at a distance.  That certainly hadn’t helped anything.
“Dean, I haven’t told you yet, but…” and Dean braced himself for the worst, trying to keep his expression controlled.
The angel was still looking exhausted and was leaning against the door of an old truck.  Dean felt an urge to force Castiel to go lie down for a while and rest, but he quickly buried it.  His urges had gotten him into enough trouble already.
Dean couldn’t help jerking forward into Castiel’s touch.  He needed the contact, the friction, and Castiel was finally giving it to him with long, slow strokes.  Maintaining the pace, Castiel kissed Dean deeply and possessively until Dean was moaning into his mouth.  Curiously, Castiel cupped Dean’s balls, fondling them and squeezing gently, experimentally, before he returned to his previous efforts.
have been a fucking nightmare after all. And thank Zeus (yup, not God, not anymore, he gets plenty of credit already that he doesn’t deserve) for that because Dean distinctly remembers kissing Cas recently and it, weirdly, feels a lot more real than when he normally wakes up, more vivid maybe, like a memory instead of just a quickly fading dream that leaves him feeling good.
Dean ran a hand through his hair and evaluated himself.  Maybe he hadn’t really thought this plan through.  He pulled off his soaked shirt and wrung it out, tossing it to Castiel and opening the trunk.  He was busy looking for a clean shirt when someone wolf-whistled from across the street.  Dean turned to see a group of what were probably high school kids loitering in front of a convenience store.  He wondered if it was more serious or mocking, but found he didn’t care.  Slipping his dry shirt on, he took the wet one back from Castiel and wrung it out again, before adding it to the trunk.
Dean brought his hands up to his face, rubbing his heels against his eyes.  He could probably have handled that better.  None of it made sense to his sluggish brain.  There was no reason why he would have kissed Castiel, the guy was his friend, a good friend, really his best friend, but that was it.  Dean didn’t play for that team.  He must have just been hornier (and drunker) than usual and Castiel was the only one around.  How long had it been since Lisa?
The vagueness of Dean’s sentence had confused Sam briefly, before he realized Dean was talking about the lube without actually saying the word.  His brother wanted to know what else would upset Castiel and that was a hell of a question.
Sam and Bobby had started talking, but Castiel’s thoughts were too muddled to pay much attention to what they were saying.  He could probably ask Sam to change into something else, but the thought was so inane, he dismissed it.  Much of Sam’s clothing looked similar, it was asinine to be so perturbed by one specific combination of apparel.  He was an angel and this outfit could not hurt him.  Nor could the man wearing it.
“Yeah?”  Dean was acutely aware of his heart beat quickening as blood rushed in his ears and heat flushed his neck and cheeks.  Now this was just ridiculous.  He was acting like a friggin’ teenage girl.
There was no reason for Dean to object, because Castiel’s proposal was exactly what he wanted, but he didn’t want Castiel feeling obligated either.  Castiel must have sensed Dean’s hesitation, because he looked slightly less confident.
Cas thought that once he had understood, he would stop thinking about them, but he doesn't. He starts wondering what he would do if he would to mark his flesh like this. He doesn't know where this is coming from, but it's always present.
They don't talk about it anymore, but Cas can't shake it out of his mind for days. He wonders if someone dared Dean to do it too, if he touches the Orion constellation in his right arm or the compass wind rose in his shoulder and thinks about that person like Sam does.
Dean doesn't explain anything, doesn't show the new anchor sitting on the inside of his arm to anyone but him. Cas doesn't know if he cares so he doesn't tell him, but anchor tattoos mean stability, peace, strength, determination and passion, some things that dean wants and some things that dean already has but ain't aware of. Cas thinks he understands the feeling, the want of something to focus amidst of chaos, the controlled pain and the mark that stays.
“I want to.  It felt good when you did it,” Castiel murmured keenly, his fingertips at the top of Dean’s jeans.
Even though Dean was afraid of what it meant, it was hard to keep his thoughts off of Castiel.  He thought of the features of Castiel’s vessel.  Dean had always known that the angel was pleasing to the eye, but he had never really thought of Castiel’s appearance as appealing.  He knew now that it was—despite the fact that Castiel was clearly a man. Which was weird. But the messy dark hair and piercing blue eyes of Castiel’s face were in Dean’s dreams.
Dean could feel Castiel’s orgasm as it ripped through him and the angel tensed and shuddered while Dean fucked him faster, loving the clenching heat surrounding him.  He jerked Castiel until the angel had nothing left to give and he dropped his head back against the bed.  Then Dean kissed the corner of his mouth and hooked his elbows under Castiel’s knees, pressing the angel’s thighs closer to his pliant body.  Dean plowed into Castiel, rocking him along the bed and making him moan.  Castiel clung loosely to Dean, as the hunter thrust wildly, lost to the smooth glide and hot pressure.
Castiel had seemed briefly incensed, but the moment passed and his voice became calm and thoughtful once more.
Stepping around Sam, Dean went back to playing nurse, rubbing burn salve on the two welts on Castiel’s front side, before he tilted him forward and fixed up the burn on his shoulder blade that he must have skipped earlier.  Then he was examining Castiel’s head, assessing the injury there. “You’ve got so much hair it might be hard to stitch this one,” he muttered.  He shifted the icy towel against Castiel’s head again.
“Give him a break, Sammy.  I doubt we’ll be in another bar fight anytime soon.  And like I said they were trying to make trouble—you can’t always talk your way out of things.”
Dean spoke briefly with the medical examiner while Castiel seemed to be sniffing the bodies.  Dean tried to convey a look that said, ‘cut that shit out’ but he wasn’t sure if he was successful.  So much for assuming Castiel would be more adept at acting normal around dead people.
The bathroom door opened and Dean looked around from where he was stretched out across the bed. Castiel draped his stained attire across the chair by the table.  He had donned Dean’s clothing, as suggested, and Dean thought it was a little unfair that Castiel looked better in his clothes than he did.
Finally, Castiel got it, or if he didn’t understand the connection, at the very least he seemed content to be kissing.  He slid his hands around Dean’s waist, pulling him gently closer.
Castiel knew Dean liked his toast buttered and ‘regular’ coffee seemed like a good option, though he thought Dean usually asked for ‘black.’  He hoped he made the best choices.  Castiel paid and waited until the food was ready.  Walking outside with the bagged containers in one hand and the hot coffee in another, Castiel appeared back in the motel room.
When Castiel came to them for real to explain the dream, Dean just tried to act normal.  There was plenty they had to hash out, so it was pretty easy for Dean to go with the flow and pretend he hadn’t initiated an intoxicated kiss with an Angel of the Lord.
But Sam had tightened his arm gripping Castiel’s waist and while still thrusting, tilted the angel at an angle so he could stab the knife at Castiel’s chest striking him just below his collar bone, but close to his arm. Castiel had been caught off guard and he let out a yelp and his whole body lurched in Sam’s grip. The wound wasn’t as deep as the one in his leg, but as the freshest injury it demanded his attention.
“There isn’t much to tell,” Castiel looked away.  “No new information, at any rate.”  Castiel was looking uncomfortable.  “Discussion of the war in heaven…  I worry it might take a while for me to explain it satisfactorily and I have to leave shortly.”
As the day grew warmer and shifted into the afternoon, Dean peeled off his outer layers so he was just in his t-shirt, enjoying the breeze on his arms.  The fish action had slowed down, but Castiel kept his eyes on the lake and their lines, waiting.
“That’s it, sweetheart, get my dick all nice and wet for your ass,” Dean encourages, unnecessarily, since Cas’s lips are on him immediately, so eager to touch that he’s swallowing Dean whole.  Dean pushes forward slightly, meeting Cas’s mouth with a steady pace of thrusts as Cas’s impatient hands grab at his ass and urge him forward. It’s so hot and wet and wonderful, that Dean can’t help but grab at Cas’s hair, dragging him impossibly closer, lips and tongue busy at the base of his cock.
Sam noticed Dean was blushing too, while holding a pair of his own boxers.  Strange.  It wasn’t like Dean to be embarrassed by a little nudity.  Dean hadn’t moved to start anything, so Sam shrugged to himself, bent over and started to undo Castiel’s belt.
“Woah, Cas. It’s not like that at all,” Dean began, deliberating how to begin correcting this thought.
Conscious of the fact that he hadn’t done much for Castiel yet, Dean grabbed and pulled at him until he had the angel’s lips on his.  Clutching his hand around Castiel’s cock caused the angel to lurch forward and gasp against his mouth.
“You got a bit carried away, don’t you think, Cas?  Dean probably could have handled those guys on his own.”
The Velcro rips loudly as Dean removes the cuff.  Moving back to the counter, he draws a little smiley face on Cas’s chart and picks up the doohickey thing for examining ears.  He’ll have to look up more doctor lingo if they ever do this again.
Sam was uncoordinatedly getting up from where he had crashed against the wall.  He seemed unharmed and Castiel returned his attention to Dean who had a hand covering his face.
Dean turned away from the angel and Castiel knew he was dismissed. The conversation was over.  He had failed to explain himself and Dean wasn’t interested in his reasoning or his pleas.
“Thought the three of us could have a movie night?  Maybe order some pizza instead of going out.  You haven’t had Cas try pizza yet.”
“Wash up. I need you to do his stitches.” Surprised, Sam looked at Dean questioningly. “C’mon, Sam. You know you can do them better than I can.”
The hunter blinked.  He didn’t think he had ever heard Castiel ask for the time—his internal clock was unshakably accurate.
Even though Sam was glad he remembered what he had done to Castiel—it was for the best—he hated how vivid the memories were.  It seemed to be that way for a lot of what he had done while soulless.  It was almost like watching an unsettlingly real film with all the 3D effects he never wanted.  He could smell the damp warehouse, the smoke and blood, he could hear Castiel’s pained noises while he struggled to act like Sam wasn’t hurting him, he could see how ruthless he had been.  He could recall every cruel thing he had said, he could see Castiel’s fear and defeat.  He remembered feeling powerful, justified, and satiated.
Cas does, leaning back with his palms flat on the sanitary paper.  Normally Dean would be tempted by all that warm inviting skin, he wouldn’t waste any time, sliding his hands up and down Cas’s sides, his lips kissing across his torso, but he resists.  As a doctor he has to keep things clinical.  Dean moves slowly across his chest and down his abdomen, listening in different spots.  Touching gently, he examines Cas’s stomach, prodding at arbitrary intervals.  Dean gets a little distracted when he notices Cas’s cock twitching slightly as his fingers press lower.
. Dean would be expecting a different reaction from him. Sam tried to school his expression into one of concern.
“Yes, Dean.  In the past I let you know when I didn’t like something.  I still will, but if I say I’m okay you need to trust me.”
After a minute of gasping, Castiel focused on Sam above him and said haltingly between breaths, “No. Sam—you need—ughhhhh.” Castiel let out a small groan this time as Sam reached back and pressed against the knife with his palm, forcing it even further into his thigh.
“Shut up, Sam.  With Cas healing me all the time I can eat whatever I want,” Dean said, taking a generous bite of bacon.  Chewing, he continued, “’Sides, hunting will get me before food will.”
“I’m not opposed to conversing with Sam, but I don’t always have something to say.  What would you have me talk about in regards to that topic?”
Just like that, Naked Cas was suddenly Dean’s new normal.  Castiel worked inconsistent hours and always from home, so Dean was often coming in the door at the end of the day to find Castiel reading naked on the couch, sitting naked at the table, pacing naked on the phone.  Always naked.  Dean’s early attempts to be polite were soon forgotten and he let his eyes roam.  The more he looked, the more certain he was that he liked what he saw.
“You gotta look at me, man,” Dean caught Castiel’s gaze and stared evenly at him. “You gotta level with me and tell me what’s going on.  Look me in the eye and tell me you’re not working with Crowley.”
“Hey Castiel. Um…maybe this is pointless.  Look…I don’t know if any part of you even cares, but, um, I still think you’re one of us, deep down.  I mean, way, way, way off the reservation, but,” Sam sighed.  “Look, we still have till dawn to stop this.  Let us help.  Please.”
Throughout the years, Bobby had always been supportive, so Sam was unsurprised when he agreed to Sam’s proposed pact to keep aware of situations that might trigger difficult memories for Castiel.  There had been a potentially teary moment afterwards where Bobby had pulled Sam into a hug and reassured him that he wasn’t to blame.  Bobby seemed to agree with Dean that Sam had been off the rails in a bad way when he was soulless.  It was good to hear it again from someone else and Sam hadn’t realized how much he needed the hug until Bobby had forced it on him.
Thinking of the wrongs he had done, Sam suddenly found himself hoping that Dean had helped Castiel through all the crap Sam had inflicted on him.  Of course, Dean sucked at Feelings, but Sam suspected that his brother might have made an exception for the angel.  Before the current mess they were in Dean and Castiel had seemed like friends, good friends even.  It sort of surprised Sam how connected the two of them seemed to be sometimes and Dean must have felt close to Castiel—he wouldn’t tolerate long intense looks like that from anyone else.
“Shit, Cas, you’re still all shaky. C’mere.” Dean moved the same arm to wrap it around his shoulder and Castiel scooted closer into Dean’s embrace.  Sighing, Castiel rested his head on Dean’s shoulder, while Dean rubbed his arm through the thin dress shirt.
Castiel was looking much better than he had the day before, but there was still a tired quality to his features.  He had cleaned up his clothing though and was looking much more like himself, which made Sam glad.  The waitress brought them all coffee and Castiel a water, though he hadn’t requested any.
Castiel had been busy sucking at Dean’s throat and he recognized that the angel was kissing over the same area that the ghancanagh had been earlier.  That was fine with Dean.  If anyone was gonna be leaving marks on his neck, it should be Castiel.  Groping at Castiel’s ass with one hand, Dean worked the other one through the angel’s hair, gently holding him against his neck.  Slowly, Castiel inched his fingers up Dean’s spine and over his shoulder blades.  Then he was firmly gripping Dean’s biceps and he swiftly switched positions with the hunter, so that Dean was between the angel and the door.  Somehow Castiel’s displays of power never failed to turn Dean on and he swept forward to claim the angel’s mouth, seeking out his tongue.
Wasn’t that reassuring.  Castiel was angry and he definitely seemed to be enjoying being so powerful.  Dean realized, guiltily, why the angel would be so satisfied that no one could hurt him, why he would be angry with Dean, after all the apologies Dean had refused to accept.
“Uh, yeah. Yeah, Bobby. I’m okay.  I just…”  Sam wasn’t sure how to finish his sentence.  He had seen Lucifer.  He had been talking to him and it had seemed so real. Fortunately, the devil was no longer in sight.  Sam took a steadying breath, uncomfortably aware of Bobby’s analytical gaze.
“Yes.  Fine.  Let’s just move past it, continue as roommates,” he suggested as Dean nodded in relief.
As Dean looked down, numbly, at his friend, the wounds and blood on his face disappeared and Castiel’s eyes blinked open as he inhaled.
There was silence again and Dean let his eyes drift closed, trying to ignore the fact that Castiel hadn’t moved and was likely still staring at him.  A car door slammed out in the parking lot and Dean realized he better fall asleep soon, before people were waking up and it was too noisy to do so.
Dean was just standing next to Castiel.  He was holding a towel, probably full of ice, against the side of Castiel’s head.   It seemed unnecessary to Sam, he suspected it would have stayed in place without Dean keeping it there.  Castiel’s eyes were closed.
“With your new look, you fit right in with the suburban dad crowd, Cas,” Dean  teased, smiling at Castiel, who did not return the amusement.
He did note that the stab wound seemed to be from a regular knife and not one of those distinctive, triangular angel blades.
Castiel took the movie a little too seriously at first and asked occasional questions in an attempt to make sense of it.  They ate the pizza (Castiel took one bite and then Dean finished his slice) and Sam and Dean competed to see who could go the longest in a row catching popcorn in his mouth.  Sam was pretty sure he won since Dean started cheating by throwing extra popcorn in Sam’s direction to try and mess him up.  When Dean tossed a piece to Castiel, he caught it easily in his mouth and Sam felt happy that they were all smiling together.
He looked over at Dean and noticed how he was staring at the treetops, in search of the bird that had just made a sound above them. Castiel was about to advise him to look where he was going, as roots lifted from the ground every here and there, when before he could reach out to help, Dean’s body was dropping to the floor.
The angel downed them like they were water, and Dean who’d been drinking for hours, before, was having a hard time keeping up.
Dean’s eyes spotted one small metal box, totally wrapped up in duct tape, with no indication as to what it was or where it was from. “Cas, check this out.”
“I guess that means I can go back to Heaven,” he waited for the inevitable confirmation. Dean was okay, there was nothing left for him to fix here, no reason to stay.
Dean’s mind was going 75 in a 45 zone, racing with about as much shit as it could possibly hold before giving out. There was Cas, somewhere, looking for information on where they were keeping Gabriel. There was a war about to burst. There was Gabriel, probably being tortured right as he was thinking it. And there was Dean slamming the door of his car with way more force than he needed to, rushing to get inside the house, gather his things, and head to the Command Centre in the middle of the night, to get ahold of the only known weapon capable of killing angels.
He wasn’t in control anymore, basic instincts had taken over, all his blood was being pumped to his extremities, urging him to move, to run, to get the hell out of dodge, leaving his brain, and his mouth, with not enough oxygen to make him think things before he said them. Dean hadn’t even been sure about it, but now it was out, like a huge zeppelin between them, and there was no use, no time, to try and rail it back in. If this was it for them, he might as well get it out.
Like he’d forgotten what it was like, to have fun, to just hang out with someone, with nothing to hide, nothing to hold back.
Gabriel stepped closer to Dean, who didn’t even flinch and reached a hand for his shoulder, patting it somewhat patronizingly. “You’re doing the right thing, kid.” Dean tried a smile at that, but it was faint at best, like he was trying to believe him.
“Oh that’s super, you’re saying, either way, we end up like exterminated vermin? No that’s great, thanks for the heads up.” Dean rolled his eyes.
Aunt Ellen and his uncle Bobby weren’t actually his real family. It was just common for hunters to have little to no family members so most of them stuck together within the walls of the city. Hunters refer to close friends as family, or as Bobby often put it; “Family don’t end with blood.” Though whenever Dean asked about the meaning behind that, Bobby would usually hurry to change the subject or brush it off. Of course, not everyone inside the wall got along nicely so they were divided into families about the same size as families outside the walls would be.
“Dean, you’re tired, you should rest,” Cas said with that slightly concerning tone that Dean didn’t know if he found it annoying or if he actually kinda liked it in the angel’s voice.
“I’m not fond of wasting hours behind my laptop doing boring research, Dean. You just refuse to do it.”
to anyone, to defeat the whole purpose of the mission by putting you in danger. I have already messed this job up beyond repair, now would you
“No, no you’re right.” It did make sense, but Cas sounding it out did nothing for his laughing fit to stop. “I guess, but you’re going to love it, boy scout’s promise!”
Castiel didn’t know exactly what he was looking for in the cabin, but if there was any chance of getting to talk to Dean this would be it. He was well aware that he could just appear in one of Dean’s dreams to talk to him, but the thought of intruding his personal space didn’t seem like a good idea after what had happened the previous week. So, all he could do was wait, and hope that when Dean would come back to the cabin, and on top of that, that he would want to talk to him. He’d wait.
Dean’s eyes closed at the intimate touch, his veins ignited by the angel’s touch. He didn’t really know what to say to that, his first reaction was to play it off as a joke, but he wasn’t sure he could trust his mouth to form actual words. His heartbeat found refuge in his throat as he felt the shifting of weight, he opened his eyes as a reflex and his heart beat so fast he thought he would spit it out.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Anger rose inside Dean, his hands reaching for the iron bars.
“It’s customary for an angel to own an amulet, it has to do with our grace,” Cas seemed to catch himself before sharing too much information because his mouth turned into a thin life before he spoke again. “We don’t acquire them in Heaven, though, it’s not created with us.”
Already used to the new routine he and Cas shared, the first thing Dean did was walk over to the table. He flipped open
boy toy for that matter, what’s wrong with you?” He tried to sound offended and nonchalant, but he was guessing Jo could see he was just full-on blushing.
Dean’s eyebrows nearly shot off his damn forehead, “you mean to tell me that you’re still a virgin?”
Dean raised his eyebrows, his younger brother had a point though. God, why did it feel like everyone around him always had a goddamn point these days?
“You wanna take a picture, Bobby? It’ll last longer” Dean smiled sarcastically, but he didn’t dare look at the older hunter for more than a few seconds. If there was one person he had real trouble lying to - it was Bobby. Dean didn’t know whether Bobby had seen John at all today, or if someone might have told him that John looked like he had gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson. If that were to be the case, Bobby would definitely be wondering how Dean was still able to walk, talk and breathe.
“Can I try something?” the angel asked. Dean nodded, as he was one hundred percent positive that he could not make any comprehensible sound right now. Dean’s brow furrowed in confusion when Cas moved away again, turning to lie on his back, and immediately Dean felt the lack of Cas, the cold embracing him.
“Private rooms are 100 dollars an hour, and to dance for both of you at the same time it’ll be an extra 50.” The bartender recited bluntly “No touching without the girl’s permission, and no kissing them. Whatever you ‘wanna do between yourselves has to be in the backrooms, got it?”
“The blades,” Castiel started, afraid Gabriel would lose focus before even beginning. “they have to have come from Heaven.”
“More often than not these days.” He stated as he frowned at Dean’s arms. “You going to single-handedly fight this war, boy?”
Well, that was until Sam came back downstairs later to start his, by now, question routine. Dean was having none of it and tried to ignore him by humming the lyrics to ‘physical’, but that only bought him a few minutes.
talked to Sam about his non-sexual endeavors in bed, it was just something that didn’t exist. Dean shifted uncomfortably on his feet, he had never felt more exposed than he was at the moment.
“Michael’s grace.” Dean explained, “it’s the only way we can get out when I get in there.” Then, he explained exactly what Sam had told him.
, he thought. “Leaving,” he raised his voice, jaw clenched, and brow furrowed. The lines across his forehead deepened, and he balled his fist by his side. His heart thumped in his chest and his lungs felt tighter again. He could feel the burn behind his eyes, prickling.
Through the large rectangular windows on the side of the building, one was able to get a glance at what was happening inside. A group of around thirty hunters sat at a wooden table in a large hall. On the inside, the walls were covered by what looked like an arsenal. Guns, knives, bats, hatchets, crossbows, basically anything a hunter would consider a weapon was proudly decorating the hall. The group of hunters was chatting noisily until a man entered the room and took a seat in the middle of the table.
“Good, because I need you boys on the same team. We’ve caught wind of a new lead, a possible angel sighting near lake Lacua.”
“Yeah, not from a dude,” Dean asserted, suckling at his cockhead before backing off to tongue the slit.
“Why?” Castiel walked towards Death, clearly irritated.  “Because I dared open a door that He shut?  Where is He?  I did a service taking His place.”
Seemingly concerned by Sam’s dramatic reaction, Castiel tried to reassure him.  “Dean apologized last night for not talking with me.  He was confused because he thought I was a man.  But then I kissed him and it was much better than before because Dean was sober and I wasn’t startled.”
Castiel thought about Sam very purposefully that night.  He observed the hunter through dinner, evidently staring too much, because Sam twirled his fork on his plate and pushed his food around before asking Castiel if anything was wrong.  Afterwards, back at the motel, Castiel wrestled with the issue and attempted to see things from Sam’s perspective.  He tried to imagine how Sam might be feeling, but it was a challenge.  It was still a struggle to identify his own emotions sometimes.
“Yeah, uh, I heard you.  That’s, uh, you remember.  Well, good, I guess, cause you’re still feeling okay, right?”
They crossed the street and walked a couple of buildings away, loitering in front of a laundromat.  Sam pretended to be on his cell phone and he told Castiel not to stare directly at the café.   Leaning up against the wall next to Sam, Castiel turned his head downwards, while periodically casting his eyes back up the street.
