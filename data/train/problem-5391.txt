Tony shrugged, but wouldn’t meet his eyes as he finished unwrapping Steve’s hands. He let out a hiss of sympathy at the blood before grabbing the wet towel and softly patting at his knuckles. “When are things not wrong?”
Steve searched his face for a long minute, before he seemed to find what he needed and softened, a pleased smile on his lips. “Of course, Tony. Whatever you need.”
Tony had met his gaze, just once, enough for those dark eyes to squint at him with an indecipherable expression before looking away.
“Sort of,” Nightmares were transient and fleeting. In the waking world, they could be ignored, but his memories were what haunted his dreams. Perhaps it was worse, knowing he could never forget. Steve looked down at their hands, marveling at how focused and gentle Tony could be, his tanned fingers wiping a towel against Steve’s lighter skin.  “I just don’t like to sleep.”
“Okay nope, we are doing you first then you can help me,” Tony tugged and shoved until Steve was sitting cross-legged on the floor facing the couch so he could rest his arms on the seat of it. Tony unceremoniously plopped himself behind Steve and then promptly froze, his hands hovering over those wings he’d coveted for so long.
Steve stared at the ceiling, back straight and stiff as he lay on the bed. Stark tower had top of the line technology, but his enhanced hearing still picked up the light ‘plink’ of rain against glass, muffled by the windows. The quiet sounds blurred together, until they resembled the rushing roar of water, the coldness of the ocean and the choking dread he’d felt as his plane dived.
And not just any art, it was the one he’d drawn of Tony sleeping on the very couch they were sitting on. Tony had an arm slung over his eyes, mouth half open and tempting. The glow of his arc reactor gave the scene a nice glow, a soft blanket of blue.
“Sorry, just ignore that. Natural reaction to being groomed, you know how it is,” Tony’s laugh was just a little too sharp.
Once he figured out how tags worked, though most of the ones on Tumblr seemed to be useless, he was able to follow some blogs. Many of them were scenic art blogs, some were character studies of various cartoons that seemed to be popular.
“Hey, it’s alright,” Steve spoke from somewhere behind him, a warm palm settling between his wings and on his back. “Anytime you want to stop just say the word.”
Steve shook his head, reading between the lines. Tony had lived with his trauma longer than Steve had. He had tried and true ways to cope. This was less about Tony needing comfort, and more about Tony trying to offer Steve some company. “You didn’t need to go out of your way to check on me.”
Tony let out a scoff at that. “Well Cap, if you have the luxury of being able to sleep, you should take it.”
about this. Had apparently put some weight on grooming Tony’s wings. Clearly this meant more to him than he was letting on.
“You’re alive now,” Tony’s voice was a whisper, a breath of soft air against his ear, and maybe that was what broke him. In the end, all it took was one man and a kind heart.
Tony glanced around the large living room, a little lost as he stood there in his sweaty undersuit, his wings messy and dragging on the ground. The Avengers had all paired off for grooming after a long battle: Natasha with Clint, Bruce with Thor, and it left Tony alone. He didn’t blame them, he wouldn’t want to touch his wings either.
Tony raised a brow, a brief contemplative look crossing his face before it smoothed out and he grinned, easy and friendly. “Of course, have at it. Just make sure you get all my good angles.”
Tony shoulders pulled up, his fingers tightening on Steve’s for a moment before relaxing. “The rain reminds me of Afghanistan. Water in general reminds me of it. Being waterboarded wasn’t exactly a walk in the park.”
Steve truly did want to groom him, which was an odd thought on its own, but Tony didn’t dwell on it. He tried to relax his body, breathing forcibly steady as he counted in his head.
It didn’t help. Really, there was nothing that Steve could do about the cold and the persistent nightmares, but if he didn’t try something he was afraid he’d really snap. He stood there, eyes unseeing as he stared into the dark closet. He clenched, then unclenched his fists, trying to steady the tremble in them.
Tony’s eyes were half-lidded, exactly like his art, but the insecurity was entirely new. Maybe that was what broke Steve out of the daze he’d been in, the fact that this was
Steve didn’t draw himself into the art piece, because he knew that if he did, his feelings would be written all over his face. He’d watched Tony more than the actual movie, burning the sight of him happy and comfortable, illuminated by the flashing scenes of the movie, into his mind.
“Sort of,” Tony sipped at his whiskey, eyeing Steve carefully. “It’s kind of in a more romantic context. We’re a pretty big ship.”
“I’m not interested in pushing you into anything you don’t want,” Steve sounded slightly appalled that Tony would ask that of him, and he was glad Steve had such incredible control over his wings because he knew they would be flared out in response to his emotions.
He created an account after some deliberation and left a nice comment. It had been difficult to decide on a username, but one of the first lessons Tony had given him was not to use his real name online. The thought of Tony had inspired his username.
It had been a risk to upload this, Steve knew that, but he truly didn’t think Tony would see it. He’d gotten careless, and his feelings were splashed all over his art in full color.
“Nothing!” Steve yelled out, just a little too loudly if the look Tony shot him was any indication. “But maybe we can look at someone else’s art? How about franzwcoffee?” Steve offered up the name rather desperately. Franz was someone Steve had interacted with several times in his comments section. They seemed to be a fan artist too, but not one he’d had the opportunity to see the art of. He’d planned on doing it soon.
“If I sleep, I might not wake up again.” It hurt to say out loud, and Steve felt the words choking him as they left his mouth.
Tony turned towards the voice, his wings perking up in recognition even though he immediately shoved them back down. He’d been blocking the doorway, and he moved to the side to let Steve step in. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the domestic scene before focusing on Tony. Steve’s wings were neat and orderly, a mix of dark blue and black that lent them a dangerous look. To put it simply, they were very attractive wings, and Tony knew he wasn’t the only one that coveted them.
It was true, Tony had tried once on the roof. Had tried to do the traditional dance that courting couples engaged in, but he’d almost fallen to his death and it was only JARVIS’ quick intervention with an Iron Man suit that had saved him.
“Everything?” A hitch in his breath, a hint of vulnerability. Tony always wore his heart on his sleeve.
Steve watched in awe as art after art flew up on the screen. There were some really talented people out there. “Wow, so you knew about this?”
When the silence stretched between them for too long, Tony realized he’d been lost in thought and still hadn’t responded to Steve’s generous offer. His eyes darted over to the languid pile of Avengers, drowning in the happy feelings that came of mutual affection and caring touches, before settling on Steve’s impeccable wings. They were straight against his back, almost standing at parade rest, as if they too were soldiers waiting for an order.
“It’s fine, Tony. I already healed,” Steve protested weakly even as he reveled in the way Tony handled him so gently. The skin-to-skin contact felt nice. It made him more aware of his body. Grounded, rather than floating in the gaping maw of the freezing ocean.
“Yeah,” Steve responded, whisper-soft as he tugged his hands free from Tony’s. His skin was clean now, a little damp against the chilly air, but unmarred. It was almost like he’d been purified by Tony’s touch, changed for the better. He flexed his hand, feeling the pull of skin. His body could heal the injuries, they could purge the scars, but his mind remembered every bit of pain he’d suffered. “Sometimes I wonder if this is the dream. This new future with heroes and villains, magic and technology, and that I’m still in the ice.”
“I’d rather we keep each other afloat,” Tony’s hand cupped his cheek, tilting his head up until he could meet Tony’s eyes. “How about it? Wanna be my sexy lifejacket?”
His voice was firm, more sure than he felt as he crossed his arms and felt his nails digging into his skin. His wings were tense against his back, trembling in either fear or anticipation. He couldn’t tell, but he’d bet money on both. There was a light touch against the back of his hand and he stared down at it, dazed, before looking to the side and meeting Steve’s earnest eyes.
“You know, if this were a high school au I’d be sliding you a paper asking ‘Do you like me? check yes or no.’” Tony murmured against his lips and he couldn’t help breaking the kiss, a laugh bursting out of him.
“Ideas,” Steve repeated, voice whisper soft. Tony’s pose was deliberate, his outfit too. Steve remembered now how he’d drawn Tony like this, in one of his earlier ones. Tony leaning against a table like he was now, with a come hither look. If Steve looked up, he would see-
Steve mouth dropped open in surprise, his wings rustling in what seemed to be a nervous gesture. “If you want, but there’s not much grooming that needs to be done. The serum usually takes care of everything.”
“Do you?” Steve challenged, never one to back down. Always pushing forward. “You can just go in there and ask them to help. We wouldn’t mind.”
He traced the lines on Tony’s face with a soft finger, smudging the charcoal and adding shadows to his already distinct features.
When Steve only raised a brow at him, he sighed and loosened his stance, trying to show that he was serious. “Look, that’s different. I just…” Tony ran a hand through his messy hair, grimacing at the way sweat had matted it down. “I don’t know, I guess I just needed a little push.”
Tony’s brows scrunched together and he stared at Steve before they softened into understanding. “You slept for decades.”
“They might ship us, but they’re probably just seeing things that aren’t there,” The twist of Tony’s mouth seemed sad, bitter somehow. His fingers were tight on the glass. Steve didn’t like it.
That night he uploaded his first art onto Twitter, Tumblr, and any other social media he could figure out. It was a piece with all the Avengers, during one of their movie nights. They were sprawled out on every available surface, Natasha looking exasperated as Thor yelled at the screen, Clint drooling onto her shoulder, Bruce with both hands raised nervously in an attempt to placate the thunder god, and Tony with his head thrown back, eyes tightly shut as he laughed.
“Not like that,” Tony sighed, and he cursed under his breath for a moment before clearing his throat and meeting Steve’s gaze head on. “I would like you to groom me. Please.”
He stayed silent, and it was enough for Steve to let out a sigh, shoulders slumping and wings dipping. “If you don’t want me to, that’s fine.”
“You don’t have to,” Tony’s words were halting, tripping over his tongue as his wings rustled sharply.
“Yeah,” Tony let out a slow breath, relieved when the elevator door opened with a ‘ding’ and he could step out into the open space of his workshop. “I know, but you want to.”
JARVIS’ quiet addition of ‘the Captain speaks the truth’ only made Tony splutter. “I am not that bad.” He frowned, a bit petulant.
But that’s what art was for, wasn’t it? To say what can’t or couldn’t be put into words. To speak to those in the past, present, and future, and hope that somehow they would understand what he wanted to convey. It only took him a week to grab a sketchbook, unused to the quality of the pages and the crisp edges, and put pencil to paper. He’d never been one for hesitation, preferring to face his fears head on, and this was no different.
“Oh yeah, fanfictions are the best. Seriously, ever wanted to read a story about yourself and the rest of the Avengers fighting robots? Fics are your best bet.”
Drowning was one of the worst ways to die. Nobody ever talked about it, but it wasn’t the water that killed you in the end. It was the cold. The cold that shocked you into taking a deep breath, the cold that seeped into your pores and numbed you to the point of complacency.
“Sarah here was just telling me about your father’s fiftieth birthday,” Tony says coolly, making Steve blush.
He’s always been adventurous, so he’s willing to try anything once.  Whether he ends up liking it is an entirely different story.  Some acts are too uncomfortable for him; too intimate to engage in with people he doesn’t know that well.  Tony values his personal space, and quite frankly, after having so many exes who have tried to kill him, he can’t really be blamed for being a little reluctant to get close to people.
“But it’s true!” Tony shot back. “You’re worth it to me, Steve.  Even if you and I never speak again, it would be worth it.  You deserve the world, and I’m going to do my damn best to give it to you.”
Tony looked down at the pile of splintered wood in disbelief.  Admittedly, the conversation wasn’t going where he wanted it to go—where he
It ended only moments later, but Steve kept close so they were breathing the same air.  Pressing their foreheads together, Steve cupped Tony’s jaw with a hand, thumb brushing against his cheek.
So Steve may have staged a little intervention later that night, politely requesting that Tony go see a doctor to make sure that the excessive amounts of sugar weren’t affecting his body. Tony agreed, but not without a dramatic sigh and roll of his eyes. The next afternoon, he had walked into the kitchen with a very smug look on his face, and slapped a piece of paper in front of Steve declaring that he had a clean bill of health.
Tony ignored him and got to his feet.  “C’mon, let’s get some pizza.  I’m starving, and I’d bet good money that you are too.”
As time goes on, the notes increase in frequency.  Tony’s glad that Steve’s hidden them in places that Tony is usually alone, because he feels his goddamned face light up like a bonfire
“You know you can always come to me if you need anything, Tony,” Steve responds, his voice uncharacteristically shaky.
Steve was vaguely aware of the high-pitched moans that escaped his mouth with every deliberate thrust Tony’s cock inside him, and he might have been more self-conscious of it another time, but all he could think about was how unbelievable it all felt.  His hands roamed over Tony’s back and down the corded muscle of his arms before settling on the sheets.
Steve cupped Tony’s face and brought their lips together.  He gasped when Tony swiped his tongue across his bottom lip and deepened it.  Steve felt the near-painful grip of Tony’s hands as they clutched their shoulders and tried to find some sort of leverage; Steve was sure that man would’ve been on the floor if Steve’s body wasn’t pinning him to the wall already.
Steve found Tony looking out the expansive window of their room with a cup of coffee in one hand, and a room service cart piled high with breakfast food next to him.  His dark, sleep rumpled hair was a sharp contrast from the fluffy, white bathrobe he had tied around his waist.
movie (he didn’t care what Steve said about them because they were cinematic masterpieces), and he was even more pissed that the Fantastic Four were off exploring in another dimension, but all of the trouble was worth seeing a sweaty, half-naked Steve standing amidst the rubble in Hell’s Kitchen.
Tony checked himself over, spinning in place a couple times before looking back at Amora. “That’s it?”
“Keep going,” Tony pleaded.  He wanted Steve to come and to know that he had been the reason for Steve’s pleasure. “Still feels good.”
He was pleasantly warm, thanks to the sleeping body next to him.  It wasn’t the first time he had woken up with someone in the same bed, and certainly not the first time he had woken up with
They stand awkwardly for a minute or two before Tony clears his throat and speaks again. “So… why me?” he asks.
Steve peeled Tony’s jeans open, drawing Tony out from beneath his boxers. He glanced up and caught Tony’s gaze as he dragged his thumb around the tip of his cock to the base, rubbing in the rain that made Tony shiver as it hit his rapidly heating skin.
It wasn’t until Steve went away that Tony realized how much he had come to depend on Steve in the few months they were together–and no, he wasn’t talking financially, but rather just… well, Steve’s presence.  Tony loved being around him; he loved getting phone calls and text messages from him; loved waking up with him and loved falling asleep in his arms every night.
“We love each other,” Steve said, desperation evident in his tone.  “Isn’t that enough reason to stay together?”
“It’s not your fault,” Tony replied, his exhaustion evident in his voice. “I know we should be used to situations like this by now, but I can’t.” He turned on his side to face the other man. “I can’t not worry about losing the few friends I have.”
“Or Thor and the balloon animal guy in Central Park,” Hill said. “The sugar is fine,” she added, after tasting the batter.  “I think it needs more vanilla, though.”
“How is he?” Tony asks, trying to sound as passive as possible.  He knows he doesn’t do a good job of it, if the twitch of Natasha’s mouth is anything to go by.
“Then it’s settled,” Bruce interrupted, giving Tony a look that dared him to say otherwise. “Steve’s going with Tony.”
“No,” Natasha says remorsefully. “It’s probably at the bottom of the river somewhere.  We'll have to scrounge up some equipment to look for it.”
The calls come in regularly after that.  Steve’s lucky he’s in such high demand that he can afford to be more selective, and Hill doesn’t care so long as she gets her fair share of the profits.
It took a while for Tony to come down from his high, and when he did, he realized that Steve had stopped moving.  The man was carding his fingers through Tony’s hair and peppering kisses along his jaw, murmuring praises into Tony’s skin.
Steve cupped Tony’s face with his hands and looked him in the eye. “Tony, you are the single most important thing in my life.  We could be a billionaires, or we could be homeless on the street, or we could be living in a cramped studio apartment above a Chinese restaurant that doesn’t have hot water half the time–”
It isn’t until about two months into this arrangement that Steve explicitly asks Tony if he wants to stay the night.  Tony nods dumbly and they fall asleep together, and have lazy morning sex that puts Tony in a visibly good mood for the rest of the day.
So Tony talks about what he did after Steve left for work.  He talks about what he had for breakfast (oatmeal and berries), and an article in a scientific magazine that he, Bruce and Hank had gotten into a heated debate over.  He talks about his plans for a new suit of armor, the upgrades he made to the quinjet, and the forty-five minutes he spent on his hands and knees picking up the hundreds of nuts and bolts that Dummy dropped on the floor.
“And risk you biting my head off for waking you up?” Steve said with a scoff.  He’d done that once, and Tony hadn’t spoken to him for a day. “No thanks.” “I’m not that—Okay, maybe I am that bad,” Tony amended.
Tony climbed onto Steve’s lap, pressing his hardening cock against Steve’s own. “What do you think?” he asked huskily before leaning forward and kissing Steve again.
Steve picked up the puppy again and held it out towards Tony’s face. “I dare you to say ‘no’ to this face, Tony.  Come on.
Tony is married to the only man he’s ever been this crazy about, and all he can think is: “I must have done something spectacular in my past life because there’s no other logical explanation for you ending up with
Tony grunted, the sound swallowed by Steve’s mouth crashing down onto his own. He scrambled for more contact, arms slinging around Steve’s neck and shoulders. He parted his lips and swept his tongue out against Steve’s in an invitation Steve took no time at all to answer. But it ended as quickly as it started, and Tony absolutely did not whine when Steve abruptly broke the kiss, pressing their foreheads together as he panted against the engineer’s mouth.
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve said. “I know you didn’t exactly come here for a vacation.”  The invitation had come out of left-field—going to Paris together wasn’t exactly normal, not for two friends anyway—but Tony hadn’t wanted to go alone, and the team had assured Steve over and over that they could take care of things on their end for a week.
“Complicated?” Sam offers. “Yeah, I get it.  You look like you have something else you wanna tell me, though.”
“You thought what?” Tony asked quietly, heartbeat a hammering staccato. He searched Steve’s gaze and then smiled a bit sadly. “You thought I’d changed my mind,” he supplied.
"If you had to choose between me or cupcakes, what would you choose?" Steve asks, watching Tony remove the paper liner of one of the baked goods.
“No, it’s… That’s more than okay.  Whatever you want.  I trust you,” Steve said breathlessly.  He leaned forward, capturing Tony’s lips in another kiss.  “How do you want to do this?”
“I’m entitled to a little fib every now and then,” Steve says playfully.  He parks the car and takes the key out of the ignition. “You ready?”
The fact that Steve truly believes he isn’t important to Tony hurts, and Tony knows he has no one to blame for that but himself.  Tony’s spent his entire life building walls to keep others at a distance, believing that he couldn’t get his heart broken if he didn’t let anyone near it in the first place.
“I don’t see when you had the time considering you were asleep for almost seventy of them,” Tony quipped.
The slow, careful sex is undoubtedly the best that Tony’s ever had in his life, but after a while, Tony realizes that Steve has a kinky side.
“Then why?” Tony asked, the question catching on a tremor in his voice. His hand dug into the shed door and he finally met Steve’s eyes with his own frustratingly-damp gaze. “Why couldn’t you let me know what was wrong? Why did you leave me?”
Tony’s brain kicked in a few seconds later, anger spiking hotly down his spine. He took off after Steve’s longer stride, not stomping like a child, thank you very much, as they rounded the side of the house to the small wooden shed out of sight from the porch.
“The typical work day involves a break every now and then too,” Steve chided. “Besides, just because this is far from your worst doesn’t mean I won’t worry.  I know you’re important and have a million and five things to do, but you still need to take care of yourself.”
“Steve,” Tony said softly, and when Steve looked up he immediately noticed the worry etched into the striking blues of Tony’s eyes.  It wasn’t the first time Steve had ever seen that look on Tony’s face—years of Avenging and near-death experiences made it a pretty regular occurrence—but it wasn’t until relatively recently that Steve learned that
However, he wasskeptical as to how to go about the process.  It wasn’t as if he had been very active in the dating pool himself: he and Pepper didn’t exactly get together under conventional circumstances, and none of his relationships before that didn’t exactly end well.
Tony, however, had never sought solace from a bottle, instead choosing to immerse himself in his work.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, his voice much softer than before.  He moves towards Tony, but stops a few feet away.
Prompt: Have you ever thought about tony being in bed watching steve sleep telling him how much he loves him in a really soft whisper. every night before bed, because that's the only way he can get a good night sleep.
His new body ensured that he would never get sick again, but being out on the front lines in enemy territory in the dead of winter with only a shield strapped to his back wasn’t exactly a happy memory.
of himself in public with various attractive models and actresses and the like hanging off his arm, that’s all they’re ever doing.
Talking to Steve was easy.  Listening to Steve was easy.  Sharing space with Steve, eating meals with him, watching television with him, leading the team with him—it was all so second nature that Tony felt like he had been doing it his entire life.
"How was it in any way idiotic?" Steve asks, his voice rising. "You're seriously running away now because I told you ‘I love you?’  Honestly, what were you even expecting to get out of this relationship?”
Steve didn’t move, even as the first droplets of rain water began to fall onto his head. Tony grudgingly sidestepped him to open the door, but Steve continued to stand there, arms full of the chopped wood.
“Steve’s not going to be happy if he sees you doing that,” Bruce commented. “Again.” “Where is he anyway?” Tony asked, curiosity getting the better of him.
But while the reasons for keeping their relationship under wraps may have held water two years ago, Steve wasn’t sure if they were even relevant anymore.
“Since it apparently means that much to you, I will,” Steve promised.  He opened his door to exit the room, but walked directly into Thor’s broad chest instead.
“We talk.  We communicate,” Steve says. “We need to be completely honest with each other from here on out.”
It’s obvious that Steve’s pulling out all the stops when he sucks on a particularly sensitive spot on Tony’s neck and unceremoniously shoves a hand down his pants.
The place is extremely crowded, and it takes Tony almost twenty minutes to find Steve, who’s chatting with a bunch of kids Tony recognizes from around campus.  Steve sees him and immediately makes his way over.
Steve yawns but still manages to nod.  He finally lets Tony go after a few moments and lays back down on the pillows. “M’always happy with you.”
Tony pops the cookie into his mouth and makes a sound of approval. “I don’t know if I should be flattered they know my favorite foods, or a little creeped out.”
Steve’s hands cupped his ass and pulled him closer, and Tony groaned into Steve’s mouth at the sudden friction.  Steve took the opportunity to deepen the kiss, his tongue plunging into Tony’s mouth and leaving him a writhing, wanton mess on Steve’s lap.  They quickly helped rid each other of their robes, discarding the offending material on the floor.  Tony grabbed hold of Steve’s wrists, pinning them to the bed as he kissed his way from Steve’s jawline to his neck.
“I saw some footage of you in the news,” Tony says, gesturing towards the muted television.  “How’d you manage to get your hands on a pack?”
Tony looks over and sees that Steve’s entire body is practically vibrating with tension. “Are you all right, Steve?”
Steve is vaguely aware of his lips moving, but his throat feels drier than a desert. His hands are shaking, and the lights above them feel a hundred times brighter than before.
Still, the press had always hounded him like a pack of wolves, and Tony chose to embrace it— he’d rather give them something scandalous to talk about than have them prying into the more personal details of his life.
?” Tony asks incredulously. “You do understand how difficult that is in our line of work, don’t you?  For all of us.”
"The one and only,” Steve replies with a grin.  "Shall we?“ he asks, gesturing to the chair he had pulled out for him.
Tony was ready for the paparazzi.  He was ready for the stares he’d get while walking down the street, and the murmurs of the other kids in his classes.  He was ready to deal with being photographed while out in public with Steve, and ready to answer the ridiculous questions from prying reporters.
“Steve,” Pepper started. “The PR team is already handling it.  They’re doing whatever they can to try to smooth this all over.  Of course, this isn't the most ideal way to finally make your relationship public, but—”
Steve visibly tenses as he tries to find the right words.  ”Tony was…” He clears his throat and inhales deeply before trying again: “Tony was more than…” Steve hears the crack in his voice when he says Tony’s name and feels the tears welling up in his eyes.  He feels Thor gently squeeze his shoulder in reassurance, and he musters up the courage to try again. “Tony was my best friend,” he finally says. “He knew me better than anyone, and I…”
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony said. “I mean, two people alone in a strange city—it’s easy to get caught up in the moment.”
, on the other hand?  He’s someone who lives the same kind of life that you do: he fights alongside you, protects you, is protected
“You know what? It’s not going to be all of this chocolate that’s going to give me cavities,” Hill said before popping another small handful of chocolate chips in her mouth. “It’s you two.”
time!” Steve exclaimed, scandalized.  He couldn’t remember how that particular conversation had come to be, but it had happened on of the first nights the team had been together.  Steve had accidentally opened a link in a spam e-mail he had received, and the team had never let him live it down.
But Steve had heard of Tony’s offer to fly Phil to Portland to see his cellist friend, and Pepper had told him about the ‘giant bunny incident.’  He knew that Tony had worked day and night to ensure everyone at his company could keep their jobs after shutting down weapons manufacturing; he knew about all of the work the man did for Fury before he got full-time ‘Avenger’ status, and knew that the team that found Steve in the arctic almost two years ago was funded by none other than Stark Industries (he also learned that Tony had been vehemently opposed to Fury’s fake 1940’s recovery room set up).
“You had every right,” Tony replied.  “I’m sorry too—for not telling you, I mean, not for saving you.  I’d do it again.”
“Sorry I’m late,” Tony greeted as he took a seat across from him.  He pocketed his sunglasses and then stole Steve’s coffee, grimacing at the bittersweet taste of the dark roast.  Steve didn’t understand why people couldn’t just appreciate the taste of a good, black cup of coffee, but he pushed the sugar bowl in Tony’s direction anyway.
Sam gets back from a week-long mission in South America with Clint and Natasha, and all he wants to do is kick back with an ice cold beer.  The last thing he expects to see in the living room is Steve and Tony, asleep and tangled up on the couch, looking far too close for it to be even remotely platnoic.
“Steve, is there any particular reason you’ve been frequenting that quaint little café around the corner?”
newspaper.  Both papers had pictures of Steve and Tony from the night before with headlines suggesting that their relationship was anything but platonic.
Tony looks up at the commotion and sees Steve storming straight towards him, bypassing all other SHIELD personnel.
Steve couldn’t help himself—he leaned in and kissed him square on the mouth, relishing in the blush that spread across Tony’s cheeks when he pulled away. “Not a dream.”
“Great job, Thor,” Clint said when Thor arrived to help him and Natasha, “because what three unarmed Avengers need are even angrier superhumans enchanted by Asgardian magic.”
“Yeah… doesn’t mean I have to like it,” Tony grumbles.  He watches as Steve picks out a sleek, gray tie that goes wonderfully with his blue shirt–his blue shirt that clings to every dip and curve of his body–and it’s absolutely
This time, there was no rush; no unanswered questions; no wondering what would happen between them after.  Steve loved Tony and Tony loved him back, and all of this was just the beginning for the two of them.
They stand there for a few moments, smiling dopily at each other.  Tony suddenly opens his mouth to say something more, but his body visibly stiffens, and that’s when Steve can faintly pick up his voice—his younger self’s voice—asking Tony where he is.
“Let me,” Steve said, breath hitching and hands traveling down to Tony’s sides and settling on his hips. “Let me do this for you. Please.”
So Steve may have staged a little intervention later that night, politely requesting that Tony go see a doctor to make sure that the excessive amounts of sugar weren’t affecting his body. Tony agreed, but not without a dramatic sigh and roll of his eyes. The next afternoon, he had walked into the kitchen with a very smug look on his face, and slapped a piece of paper in front of Steve declaring that he had a clean bill of health.
Tony looks up from the contract in his hands to see Steve sitting across from him at the table, tapping away at his phone.  There’s a nearly-empty coffee cup by his elbow, and a sketchbook opened to a half-finished drawing of Tony’s hands, and Tony realizes that Steve’s been sitting there for the better part of the hour.
“Cap here used to draw for the comics,” Tony chimed in.  Steve glanced over at Tony to see that the other man wasn’t even looking at him. “He even helped write the stories of his own comic book during the war.”
, too,” Tony reasoned. “I’d be more than happy to provide you with some books.  I know sex education in the 40’s wasn’t as good as it is now.  I mean, not that it’s that great
Tony has absolutely no intention of living the rest of his life without Steve, but recently, the actual topic of marriage seems to cross his mind more and more frequently.
He doesn’t even want to know how the hell she knows.  Thor slips out of the room with some excuse Tony doesn’t even hear because all he can focus on is Steve, who is fixated on his own phone.
“Right.  I probably should’ve factored that in,” Tony admitted sheepishly. “I’ll rework the schedule later.”
“Washed up ashore, a mile from the Triskelion.  We found him right after the last helicarrier went down.”
Steve didn’t know what it was exactly that provoked him to utter his next sentence.  Maybe it was something in the salty California breeze?  Or maybe it was the full moon above them, but Steve did know one thing: “I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”  Because he did.  He realized, lying there with Tony in his arms, that there was nowhere else he’d rather be; no one else he’d rather be with.
“Aren’t you supposed to get down on one knee? Give me some big emotional speech or whatever?  Sweep me off my feet and kiss me passionately?”
“That night was a mistake and I shouldn’t—I’m just really sorry, okay?” Tony said. “I’ve been a total jerk and nothing can excuse me for that, but I’m sorry.”
This time Tony’s eyes nearly bug out and he turns impossibly redder, stuttering, “Uh... That’s—I mean, what—”
Natasha leads him down the hall and into a relatively large room.  The security guards at the doorway pay her no heed when she walks in, but they eye Tony guardedly when he brushes past them.
“Yeah.  I know you have meetings all day, but it’s our last night here,” Steve explained. “You said you really wanted to go to that restaurant over by—”
And if he got JARVIS to record parts of it for their own private viewing pleasure later on, well... no one needed to know.
“Do you really have to go all the way to Japan?”  Tony is most definitely not whining.  Nope. He is a grown man that most definitely does not whine.
"I don't think we should see each other anymore.  We shouldn't have... this was a bad idea from the start."
Peggy gets a job at a prestigious company in Europe, and they break up a week before graduation.  Steve’s heartbroken, of course, but he eventually gets a job as an illustrator for a magazine. The pay sucks, but he and Bucky find an affordable apartment close to his office, so that makes up for it… slightly.
With JARVIS’ help, Steve does some digging.  It’s strange, after all, that someone as loud and show-offish as Tony Stark could be so easily embarrassed by a little bit of PDA.  He finds story after story of Tony, and realizes that while the man has photos upon
“A few weeks,” Tony sighs. “Thor brought back some magical mead from Asgard that only gets you as drunk as you
.  Steve’s had sex with other people, but it doesn’t take long for him to realize that nothing could have prepared him for sex with Tony.
Admittedly, it had taken a bit of time for the two of them to finally got over their egos and actually start
Based on his track record, Tony was surprised he and Pepper lasted as long as they did, and that’s what scared him the most.  Pepper was definitely not like any of the people that Tony had previously dated, and for a while, he had honestly thought they would last.
The rest of Tony’s evening had turned out to be quite enjoyable.  After their dance, he and Rumiko had ducked out of the party and spent the rest of the night talking in the park and sharing a box of cupcakes from
Tony falls silent after the remark, but Steve’s too preoccupied with his bladder to think twice about it.
Of course, Steve’s at the same restaurant with a couple of his teammates, and being the perfect gentleman that he is, stops by and says ‘hello’ before leaving.
“Not really.  We could go to a cheap motel in the middle of nowhere for all I care.  I just want to be with you.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony said, making his way over to the en suite. “I’ll see you tonight for dinner?  I should be done around five.”
could have anyone you want.  The reason why the media dismissed those dating rumors so quickly is because they didn’t believe that you would stoop so low as to date someone like me.” “Why do you always say things like that?”  “Because it’s the truth,” Tony said.
“But you’re supposed to be having a fun time gallivanting around the city; not waiting around for me to finish with my meetings every day.”  He stirred in a couple spoons of sugar before finishing the coffee in one long gulp.
Prompt: "inexperienced tony goes on a date with somebody who gets real handsy and winds up fleeing home, where he runs into steve while he's in the middle of freaking out. steve is like WHOA WTF NEED TO CUT A BITCH and assures tony that no there is no reason why he should put up with that and that he was totally right to ditch them"
The thing is, the entire thing is absolutely ridiculous. They’re making Steve get into unnatural poses and forcing him to make these absurd facial expressions, and Tony would normally be very amused by the situation, but he’s too busy being super turned on by the image of Steve smoldering at a camera in a suit that costs more than his college tuition.
Steve weighed the pros and cons of the situation: he could stay home and mope about Tony and his gorgeous, sophisticated date, or he could go out and watch his friends make drunken fools of themselves while delaying the aforementioned moping for at least a few hours. “Okay, fine.”
“It’s nice,” Tony replies when he’s righted up again.  He’s still seriously baffled by the abrupt change in topic, but he presses on anyway: “I used to hate this kind of stuff when I was kid. It reminded me of the dance lessons my mom forced me to take when I was younger.  But I actually like this jazzy, big band stuff a lot now,” he admits.
“I already apologized,” Steve growled, hackles rising as Tony started shouting again. It was like the engineer couldn’t have a rational discussion. At least the rain was cutting through all of the tension in the air. “I didn’t realize I needed to ask permission to look for my friend. Or do you want to collar and track me like SHIELD did?”
Tony pushes himself off the bed and takes the few steps over to where Steve is standing.  He playfully swats Steve’s hands away from the tie and sets to finishing up the knot himself.  He takes a moment longer than necessary to run his fingers over the smooth silk before taking a step back and surveying his work.
beautiful,” Steve says as he watches Tony harvest a few lilies and put them into a vase. “You really outdid yourself this year.”
: Get. The hell. Out of. My way,” Pepper seethes, and the reporter slinks away without another word.  She pulls Tony into the safety of his dorm room, slamming the door shut and locking it, but they can still hear the reporters in the hallway.
Tony doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve this compassionate and thoughtful man in his life; he isn’t even sure if he’s really is worthy of the his love.  What Tony does know is that he’s going to spend the rest of his days making Steve as happy as he’s made him.
Tony’s jaw clenched, Steve’s words echoing in his mind as he watched as the blonde tossed the torn log onto the growing pile.
Even now, as they’re standing in the middle of the dance floor, Tony is hyperaware of Steve’s hand in his, and he idly wonders what it would be like to brush his thumb over Steve’s finger and feel the smooth metal of a ring there.
“You have nothing to prove, Tony,” Steve assures. “You’ve showed the world countless times, that you’re an Avenger through and through.”
“I fell in love with an incredible man,” Steve answered earnestly. “The most incredible man I know.”
“Yeah, I’d never do that.  I’m perfectly fine with giving you all a place to live and building awesome toys for you at no cost, y’know.  It’s cool,” Tony said, grinning ear to ear. “You’re lucky I’m a billionaire.”
Natasha and looked at him pointedly. “Stark’s going to kill you.” “I’m fine, thanks for asking,” Steve said wryly.
“Or maybe you’re totally gone for that brunet who works behind the counter,” Bucky says as he walks through the door with a stack of folders in hand and a cup of coffee in the other.
Tonight, Steve lay in bed after an unusually quiet day.  He had spent the morning running errands, visited kids in the hospital after lunch, and hosted the monthly game night with the rest of the team.  He and Tony had retreated to their room after a game of Monopoly that nearly ended in a heated shouting match between Logan and Jennifer Walters. After a couple hours of some very enthusiastic and very athletic sex, Steve had announced he was going to sleep, while Tony had retrieved a tablet and caught up on the work he had missed that morning because of… well, more sex.
“Is there a rule that I don’t know about that says I have to spend every minute of every day with Tony?”
“You framed it?” Steve asked the next day, after noticing the sketch hanging by the bots’ charging stations.
Tony shakes his head and furiously fights back the wave of tears threatening to fall. “I’m not worth it.”
"You buy me ridiculous gifts, we go out to dinner almost every night for the past two months, and we spend practically every spare moment together!” Steve exclaimed. “Of
Everything was bigger, faster and louder—overwhelming for Steve’s heightened senses—but none of it was necessarily
Steve settled back against the headboard. “Look, I appreciate what you’re doing for me, Tony, but what if we picked this up tomorrow?” he suggested. “I don’t know about you, but I’m kind of beat.”
Steve took a tentative step forward, but Tony moved back as well, and seeing him back away hurt.  “I love you,” Steve said quietly.  If he knew this is what the conversation would evolve into, he never would have brought the subject up.
But the real draw that sex has is the feel of another body against his, because there aren’t any other acts that allow two bodies to get so close to one another.
“Tony,” Steve said, relief washing over his face.  He reached out and brought Tony in for a bone-crushing hug. “I’m so glad you’re back.  You didn’t respond and—”
“It is, but you can quit acting like this wasn’t your end-game all along,” Steve says.  “I know for a fact you aren’t that drunk.”
“I don’t think an hour constitutes as actual notice,” Sam said. “All of this moping wouldn’t happen to involve a certain genius-billionaire-philanthropist, would it?” “And here I thought I was hiding it so well,” Steve said dryly.
With one last stroke of those gorgeous wings, Tony stood and stretched a bit, taking in the ache of his own messy wings. Steve followed suit, but a bit more slowly as the shivers of pleasure went through his body. It only took a minute before he was turning to Tony, eyes bright and eager.
“Fanart,” Tony waved a hand and a screen pulled up in front of them. He shoved at Steve until he reluctantly moved over and they were both snug on the couch. “See, people are fascinated by us and they tend to draw us to kind of…let out their feelings I guess.”
Tony’s lips twisted, an echo of a smile, though the tight lines at the corners of his eyes showed his true insecurities. “I know that.”
“Captain America and Iron Man?” Steve couldn’t help but ask, a hitch in his voice as he pressed closer, trying to ask what he didn’t know how to put into words.
“How do they…” Steve struggled with words for a moment, trying to remember the terminology. “Is it possible to ‘upload’ physical art onto the internet?”
“I waited too long, and in the end, I never did get to dance,” Steve’s voice was pained, and it made Tony finally turn and face him, wanting to comfort. Steve’s hands were limp on his lap, and when he met Tony’s eyes it was filled with something that took Tony’s breath away.
Steve smiled, and decided he wouldn’t mind uploading more pieces of his life, if it meant others would appreciate it just as much as he was. He wanted others to see the Avengers as more than protectors, but as people.
“Yes, if you would like I can scan your art pieces. They can be uploaded with near accurate colors.”
There was a small pile gathering next to him, and he considered keeping them and laying them out on his bed. Make his bed a nest that would smell like Steve. He had to shake himself out of those thoughts. Absolutely not. Nope, he wasn’t going to even start down that road.
The man was just so dynamic and alive. The way he interacted with his bots, his brilliance as he waved a hand and like magic, bright blue screens would surround him. He was like a performer on stage and Steve was constantly overwhelmed by how amazing he was.
He sighed and got out of bed, a shiver running through him as the trickling of rain felt like water on the back of his neck. The serum ensured that he was rarely affected by the weather, but that was physical.
Steve tilted his head, and in that moment, his piercing eyes reminded Tony of a bird of prey. “You know, it’s not that they don’t want to include you. They know you feel uncomfortable being groomed. They don’t want to pressure you.”
“If you want,” Tony replied just as soft, his hands coming up to rest against Steve’s chest. “I would be yours too. Sounds like a fair deal, yeah?”
By the end of it, Tony felt like he was high, his thoughts floating above him as his wings stretched and moved without his permission. There was a sharp intake of breath from behind him, and it wasn’t until JARVIS let out a nervous ‘Sir’ that Tony tuned back in.
“Oh,” Steve breathed out, clutching his sketchbook a little closer to his chest as he felt something warm take hold in his heart. That was…well it was certainly a gesture of trust. He’d had a rocky start with Tony, and that was why he had wanted to make sure things were still good, that he hadn’t messed it up with his stubbornness. They were similar in a lot of ways, and their mutual inability to compromise led to arguments more often than not, but he truly did like Tony.
They stood there long enough for Steve to give a shake of resignation, wings standing strong again as he turned to go, when Tony’s wing shot out and blocked his path. Before he could second guess himself, Tony jerked his head towards the elevator, not meeting Steve’s eyes.
It wasn’t. In fact, it would probably be uncomfortable to be groomed there with all those hard surfaces and sharp metallic bits, but he needed to be in a place he felt secure. He led the way, and there was a beat of silence, maybe surprise, before he heard footsteps following him. He could also feel the curious gazes of the Avengers following them out, and he resolutely looked to the side of the elevator as they stepped in.
That was not the reaction Tony had expected. Mostly, he’d expected a swift but firm rejection. Maybe a lecture on why any sort of relationship between them was a bad idea, but Steve’s voice was…it
“Right, of course. Dinner. Let’s eat,” Tony straightened up, shoving one hand into his pocket and reaching the second out to take Peter’s hand. “Try holding my hand when you cross the street this time. As much as I love pancakes, I’m not sure how much I’d enjoy my son being squished into one.”
Steve’s heart ached for the boy in front of him and couldn’t help but try to steer the conversation some place happier, if for nothing else than to take the sad look off his face. “What are you drawing there? I heard you and Ned talking about superheroes, is that red and blue one you?”
“That’s understandable, but have you ever considered not leaving him on his own so often?” Tony froze the second those words left Steve’s mouth.
With every time that Steve happened to be in Tony’s presence, it seemed less and less appropriate to start an argument over the way he was raising his son. As it happens, the day after witnessing a six year old call out his own father in daycare feels just a bit too early for any of that.
“I said no! Lemme go! You’re stupid an’ dumb!” Peter continued to hurl insults and tiny fists at his father, even as Tony glanced over at Steve, nodding to the door.
“Yayyy!” Peter cheered, standing up from his dad’s lap and bouncing across the couch cushions. “Jarvis can you turn the TV back up? I like this episode, in this episode Mikey hasta, um, he hasta help April when she accidentally sees one of the ninja dudes who is-”
“Ok, Cookie Monster, I’ll get your dang sweets for you,” Tony teased, leaning over to poke at Peter’s ribs and make him laugh. “C is for couch, so meet me over there and we can watch something while we eat.”
But, every so often, a shot of whiskey or two after his pride and joy was put to bed didn’t hurt. Again, it was a holiday!
Tony looked awfully smug from where the blonde could see him in the corner of his eye. The urge to decimate him with an extensive list of all of his faults as a parent grew tenfold. It would be so easy to act on his petty urges and end this man’s whole career.
“That’ll be all, Mr. Stark,” she gave him a saccharine smile before sitting back into her seat properly and opening the folder up across her lap. The genius tried his best to pay attention to her briefing, lest he face her wrath.
"Ok! I'm up!" Tony groaned, clambering to his feet and glaring to where the windows stopped their impromptu rave. "Got your message loud and clear, J. Someone better be dying."
“Carry me. Daddy gets tired too quick, says ‘m too big,” The tired boy mumbled, continuing to reach up towards the blonde.
Usually I'm a chapter ahead, but since I was busy last week I had to write all of this in five days and between work, summer projects, and the fact that this if the longest chapter I've written yet, I didn't get this done on time. Hopefully we'll be back on schedule next week! Thanks for reading
The board was itching for another shiny, new piece of tech to release to the public at a ridiculous price anyways. No matter how many times Tony insisted that the phones and tablets he was making didn’t need improving upon, those money hungry dogs were always pounding their fists on the table for more and more. They had no respect for the durable, long-lasting tech he was producing.
“Uh-huh, yeah,” Tony murmured, only distantly hearing the babysitter speak to him, as the room around him faded in and out of focus. “And how did he...how did he come up with this?”
“Yes, you do. It’s the look you get on your face before you make a snide comment like the slimy bastard you are. It’s the slimy bastard look, and I want it off your face effective immediately.”
“No, I’m super strong and also I can heal, like, super fast. Besides, once I get him with my super-webs, he’ll be all tied up.”
“Stubborn bastard probably hasn’t realized it yet,” Bucky muttered, rolling his eyes like it was a regular occurrence for him to talk about his best friend’s less than stellar self-awareness in relation to dating. “If you ever get him alone, you should ask him out.”
“You’re no fun, Rhodey bear,” the Stark huffed, hopping up from the couch and to the elevator. It was Valentines Day afterall, and he felt as though a good drink was in order. A gift to himself. “I’m so scared up here! It’s lonely in this big tall tower, and you never come visit.”
“Please, call me Mr. Hogan,” the man grumbled, reluctantly shaking the blonde’s hand. Steve didn’t take it personally, he doesn’t think he’s ever once seen the man smile.
“Peter, are you happy?” God, that sounded lame. This was stupid, feelings are stupid. Tony didn’t know how to do this. Stark men didn’t do emotions.
It wasn’t until Barnes was out of the examination room and JARVIS confirmed he was in the elevator down to the first floor lobby that Tony buried his face in his hands and groaned loudly.
The other two men quieted down. It wasn’t often they got a genuine response about how Steve was feeling so they didn’t want to push him away.
Staying idle made Steve antsy and he found himself with a surplus of free time after coming back from the army.
"Uh...Mr. Stark, we-uh," the poor lady behind the desk glanced to her coworkers who seemed just as speechless as her. "Peter Parker is your….son?"
Steve had the pleasure of hanging out with them one night and nearly called the cops when he saw how hostile they were towards each other. Bucky, who had been living with Steve at the time, was honestly shocked when the blonde asked him if he needed help cutting off ties with Sam.
“Well, aren’t you just a precious little boy scout?” Tony teased, rolling his eyes. “I don’t do pleasantries so I’ll leave you four to make nice while I go grab my last few things.”
It wasn’t long before Steve burnt himself out and Agent Carter and the Colonel ordered him into going back home. They gave him the paperwork for his Honorable Discharge with twin sympathetic smiles and put him on ice, so to speak. He was benched.
Pepper sighed, a surefire sign she was just going to let Tony make bad decisions on his own. “If you say so. Goodnight, Mr. Stark.”
“What the hell? Where is all this insightful, understanding attitude bullshit coming from?” Steve made a face like his best friend being reasonable was a personal slight against him.
“That’s JARVIS, silly!” Peter looked at his father as though he were crazy. “I don’t know what his body looks like, but I’m pretty sure he’s orange.”
"Daddy!!!" Peter screeched, knocking his chair over in his rush to get out of it and then practically launching himself at his father.
Before he could ponder that any further, his phone buzzed from where it sat in his pocket. A glance at the screen told him it was Pepper calling him.
“Peter likes you, and it’s obvious you like him too. It’s hard to introduce the strange, new person you’re dating to your son. If it was someone Peter already new and liked though…” Natasha trailed off expectantly, allowing the artist to fill-in the blanks. “Just something to think about.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Peter bolting across the parking lot to his motorcycle. His father called after him, reprimanding him for running out in the street like that, but the boy was already too busy fawning over his teacher’s bike to care.
Of course, that didn’t stop Bucky from falling, quite literally, into the enemy’s hands yet again. Although this time he had been announced killed in action. Rogers had seen the lackey who shoved him off of the speeding train into oblivion with his own eyes, and even his stubborn demeanor couldn’t bring someone back to life. His friend’s death had forced him into fighting even harder. He was convinced if he was stronger, had done better, he might’ve been able to save the man who had meant the most to him.
“Betty, what do you think we’re doing today?” he asked, pointing to the blond third grader who had been raising her hand and sitting quietly for her chance.
“Hey, kiddo. How was your day at school?” Tony asked in a decidedly Not-Tony-Stark-From-TV tone of voice.
“Sounds exciting,” Steve smiled. Why had he been so nervous about getting dinner with these two? This was going fine! There wasn’t any tension or animosity between the two and they were all talking, maybe this would be a good thing. The blonde’s friends were always bugging him about going out and doing something new. This was going just fine.
“Have you been experiencing any delays, lagging, or malfunctioning in the arm in the past month?” Tony asked, popping the maintenance panel off of Bucky’s arm and peering down into the tangle of wires and moving mechanical pieces that lay underneath the chrome exterior.
“Yeah, yeah. Go ahead, I’ll be there in a hot minute,” Tony gave a big show of sighing and acting put upon, but as soon as Pepper turned to get the elevator along with Happy and Natasha, he sent a fond smile her way.
Rogers noticeably softened, giving the first grader a small nod and a smile. “It’s almost Friday, you can go ahead and take all your projects home.”
Peter giggled and shoved his dad’s hand away from the page. “No, that’s mama,” the six year old informed him, voice softer than it had been just a few seconds prior. “Ned said when his grandma died that she went upstairs to heaven and now she watches over him and his family. I don’t know about heaven or nothin’, but I think that mama is probably watching over me like the sun or somethin’.”
“Oh! Right, the babysitter thing,” Steve muttered as he pulled his phone out from his back pocket and handed it over to Tony.
The teacher seemed to deflate a little bit at that. It was like the fight had flew out of him the moment his mother was mentioned. He knew his best friend hadn’t purposely brought up his mom to antagonize him, it was more that he was disappointed in himself for letting his protective streak take him over like that in the first place.
“Hello, my dear Ms. Potts. However may I be of service?” Tony set his drink aside, leaning against the bar. Natalie turned to collect her papers off the coffee table in front of the couch in an attempt to give her boss some semblance of privacy.
As asked, JARVIS went silent. That didn't stop the AI from projecting bright flashing lights onto the window screens and blaring loud rock music over the speakers, jarring Tony out of bed.
“He was watching my rugrat, for christ’s sake,” Tony sighed. “What are you trying to pull here, Barnes?”
“Yes, very,” Pepper sounded smug from her end of the call. “And I assume Natalie will be watching over Peter while you’re gone?”
“Uh, ok?” Pepper instantly sounded stressed again. “And just WHO will be watching Peter while you’re gone for three days? You better not be planning on taking him to LA with us.”
“Noooo, I mean da-skies like Transformers: Autobots in da-skies. It’s like when someone wears a costume and then pretends that they’re somethin’ else.”
"Woah, mom?" Bucky was suddenly interested in the conversation now. No matter what he said otherwise, he lived for digging into other people's business. It was a bad habit. He was working on it. "I figured his mom was just that CEO lady Stark's dating."
“I don’t know about all that,” Steve’s laughed nervously, flushing as he shook his head. Since when did a little flirting make him such a wreck?
“You’re such a card, Nat,” Steve muttered half-heartedly, otherwise occupied with all the thoughts swirling around his head. “See you this weekend for a movie at Sam and Buck’s?”
“They are kind of creepy after hours, huh?” Tony mumbled over the rim of of his drink. There was something nagging at the back of his mind, something that told him she was lying.
“Isn’t that funny,” Tony hummed, what are the odds he’d just so happened to pick the dynamic duo out of the Howling Commandos. “Think they’d put me in the middle of a super-good-looking-soldier sandwich if I asked real nice?”
“Can you carry his bag for me? Thanks,” Tony was already outside the classroom before the teacher could respond.
“We’re doing watercolors today,” Betty answered, reaching towards the tiny plastic pallet in the middle of the table.
“It’s what I live for, Mr. Stark,” She tried to bite down on a smile, looking down to the tablet in her hands so she could hide in her strawberry blonde hair.
He brought his food to the table but before he sat down, he made a show of humming and stroking his chin in thought. Back into the kitchen he went to pull out another, slightly smaller, plate and filled that one with food as well.
Tony carefully tugged the mechanic’s shirt sleeve down over the gnarled mess of scars littering the skin above the robot arm, he was done checking it out anyways. Sometimes it was hard to remember all of the horrors the veteran before him had experienced. The man did a good job of pretending he was ok, of snarking back with Tony and putting on a brave face every time someone moved too fast around him or brought out a new tool or instrument that he didn’t recognize or recognized all too well.
It would have devolved into a full panic attack if Peter hadn’t made noise from where he was his on his tiptoes trying to toss the box of cookies into the pantry to his left. There was a small crash as his son literally launched the box to the highest shelf and knocked what sounded like three cans off of the shelf in the impact. He poked his head out from the pantry to look around suspiciously, trying to guarantee nobody had heard his fumble, and that’s when he noticed his father sitting not ten feet away at the counter. Tony must have looked worse than he thought because Peter ran to his side immediately with a worried frown that looked out of place on his chubby little face.
The teacher nearly jumped out of his skin before letting his menu drift back down to the table and responding. “Couple of months now.”
“Tony, could you relax for just three minutes, here?” Pepper groaned, whacking the arm holding his phone with a manilla folder. “Nobody likes a helicopter parent.”
“What??? No! How could you say that?” Steve gasped, practically clutching at his pearls in horror as his face started burning. “Babysitting! I’m babysitting his son for the entire weekend, not ‘boning him.’ I can’t believe you!”
“When have I ever been stressed about anything?” The genius was glaring at Steve now, arms folded across his chest as he tapped his foot. He was practically vibrating with how much he was fidgeting. “Certainly not when I had an entire multi-billion dollar company forklifted onto my shoulders at eighteen. Not when my previous business partner tried to murder me in cold blood. And definitely not when I’m ditching my son to take a two day trip to California for a series of boring ass meetings. Who says I’m stressed? I honestly find the claim rather preposterous and I-”
Tony set his briefcase on the counter and immediately began to dig through the fridge. “So how did things fare here in the big apple while I was MIA?”
As soon as his beloved son was laid to rest (After three chapters from one of his Magic Treehouse books, jesus kid.) he had found himself in front of the couch, and calling out for JARVIS to look into anybody by the name Steve Rogers currently living in New York.
“Righty-o, let’s hit the road. A-Team ready to roll out?” Tony called out as he came back from his bedroom, strapping on a rather high tech watch to his wrist.
None of that was needed though because as soon as he realized that, when Steve asked a question, he would listen to the answer intently, the first grader had a hard time staying quiet. Hell, he had kept chatting with the teacher through the entire class until he was picked up by a grumpy looking man he called Happy.
Steve rolled his eyes, placing the menu to the side. “We’re getting off topic. I’m just saying, it was an inopportune time to let this guy get his just desserts. If he ever shows his face again I’m really going to give it to him.”
Peter slid into the room on unsteady socked feet, a tupperware container of cookies clutched in his tiny hands. Thank God for small mercies and well timed child interruptions.
“Are you always so delightfully eloquent and well-spoken like this? I gotta say, it’s enough to charm the pants off even a flighty ol’ broad such as myself,” the billionaire drawled, fluttering his eyelashes. “I asked Peter what he wanted for Valentine’s Day and his list of demands were to build a big lego basketball with his pal from work and to go get dinner with ‘Mr. Steve.’”
“Natalie Rushman, Mr. Stark’s assistant, it’s so nice to meet you,” Natasha interrupted Steve, sticking her hand out for him to shake. Her eyes bore into him, daring him to say a word. “So, you’re the person who took my babysitting gig.” she joked, all saccharine smiles framed with candy apple red lips, it was leaving the man with a toothache. This wasn’t Natasha, at least not the one that he knew.
“I’ll say,” Steve huffed, shaking his head. He didn’t quite know what to do with this new knowledge.
“You’re right, you’re right,” Steve admitted with a sigh. “It’s just that Peter is such a bright and amazing kid and it makes me upset that his father is going to miss out on all of that. I mean, you should just hear the stuff he talks about once he realizes someone is actually listening! He just needs attention, something he doesn’t get enough of at home and-what are you doing? Get that look off your face.”
“I’m here to pick you up, buckaroo. It’s time to go home,” Tony said softly, resting one hand on his son’s shoulder.
The rest of the dinner went well. The three got their meals and Steve had to admit that despite the obnoxiously loud atmosphere of the diner, they made some damn good cheeseburgers.
As soon as Tony reached for Peter and lifted him out of his chair, the six year old was instantly wriggling and screaming like he was being attacked. Despite the first grader being small for his age, it looked like a struggle to keep the livid boy contained. Especially since the genius wasn’t all that big himself.
“They wouldn’t dare. The press KNOWS about the restraining order,” Tony hissed, staring in bewilderment at the screen before him. It was a grainy picture, but not so fried you couldn’t make out Tony himself holding one Peter Parker. The boy’s face was obscured by the branches of a tree, thank god. Peter was reaching out towards Steve, who had his back turned to the camera and was only half in frame, the picture had obviously been taken last second before Tony took his son home after art.
“No, it’s fine. You’re right,” Tony muttered, folding his arms and staring at the granite counter top on the kitchen island. “Your delivery could have used a bit more polishing, but you didn’t lie. I’m never around Peter any more. Not enough to know what it is the tyke’s interested in, anyways.”
From outside his classroom window he could hear the school bus brake’s squealing in protest as they pulled up to the main entrance of the building.
Half the kids in the room raised their hands, barely holding back from just shouting out the answer to the whole class. Steve picked who he thought raised their hand up first.
“Ah-ah-ah, Peter’s friend. I’m still very dedicated to my life of solitude and I have a strict ‘no fraternizing with the parents’ rule.”
Tony had just turned the heat off the stove and pulled plates out of the cabinet when he heard soft footsteps echoing from the hall. A glance behind him gave view to a messy mop of sleep tousled brown hair sneaking past the couch in the living room. Then before he knew it, there was a decidedly less grumpy, but still wary looking, Peter lurking in the corner of the kitchen.
“I like mint chocolate chip,” He said confidently as he scribbled onto the paper children’s menu with the provided crayons. “Oh, but also strawberry ice cream. And vanilla. Also the kind that comes in a box and tastes like girl scout cookies. Oh, and-”
Peter came running back to the table, falling to his knees behind it. After a couple seconds, the head of his favorite stuffed animal poked up above the surface of the table.
“That’s Ironman, another hero Peter made up. He’s a super cool billionaire who made the suit from scratch and goes around New York, helping Spiderman save the day,” Steve explained with a shy smile. “I suppose you can guess who he’s based off of.”
“I’m sorry, that doesn’t sound fun at all. Do you want to talk about it?” The art teacher tried leaning down a bit, to catch his student’s eye. It worked, the kid glancing over at him and softening just a bit. “No Valentines at all?”
“You weren’t there! He was giving me these big sad eyes, and if I said no, I would have felt like a total monster-”
“Yeah, but we got you out of your head, didn’t we?” Bucky grinned slyly, trying to punch out at his best friend despite the fact that the blonde still had a firm grasp on his arm.
This would be such an easy thing to sweep under the rug, to never discuss with the teacher. The last thing Tony wanted to do was have Steve quit on him and have Peter miserable over business trips all over again. The last month had been almost a complete 180 from the cranky boy throwing tantrums in the parking lot of the aftercare building, it would be a major setback to get rid of the blonde now.
“I do not! You’re reading into this too much,” Steve's face went red as he folded his arms and glared down at the table.
With that, a crowd of excited elementary schoolers kicked out of their seats and rushed towards the hoard of craft items. All the students except for one, that is.
Even as his eyes drifted over towards the young couple in the corner booth of the diner and how their young kid looked at them with stars in their eyes.
"And you must be Mr. Rogers," Tony drawled, looking the teacher over. "Although I gotta say, I expected more sweaters and khakis and less long legs and rippling muscles."
“Set an alarm for five thirty. I want to pick Peter up from Aftercare since our weekend plans have been otherwise postponed,” Tony instructed as he stepped into his bedroom, tugging off his suit jacket and carelessly throwing it to the floor.
After whittling down the list considerably he had happened upon information on one Captain Rogers from the 107th infantry. He was a man of many feats, a highly decorated officer who’s done a good bit for the country. Not that many would know that.
Tony Stark may be impulsive and brash, but for all he made poor decisions with good intentions to blow up in his face at a later date, he was still too smart to take Steve at face value. Sure, the guy was sweet and polite and had an entire army of elementary school art kids nipping at his heels, but there was something more to him.
“Enough of that. I know you didn’t invite me to the park so we could hug it out,” Natasha raised her eyebrow at him. “You want to talk? Let’s talk.”
He gave it another five more minutes before kicking the stopper out from the door and letting it fall shut so they could begin.
It had been a business trip better than most, but Tony was exhausted. He couldn’t wait to settle down with his son on the couch and veg for the next two hours after dinner. At least that was the plan until he saw the mess strewn across his living room.
“I’m sorry. How about I pick you up from school this week to make up for it, huh? How does that sound?” he asked, tugging his son closer in for a hug.
“It’s not too surprising seeing as it’s only been a year or two since you shutdown the weapons sectors,” She nodded in a placating manner as the elevator doors opened and they both stepped inside. “And I’m well aware of the feelings directed towards our new clean energy initiative, seeing as I’m the new CEO and there’s at least one entitled, old man per meeting who tries to convince me to start producing missiles again.”
Steve never did get his answer because in the next moment, Tony surged up to press another kiss against his lips, and they were lost to the moment. But that was okay, because there would be many more and this was their happy ending.
Steve blinked before he leaned in close, lips pressed together in concern. He knew he had his “Captain face” on, as the team liked to call it. “Is there something wrong?”
Tony was standing there, looking casual as can be in a hoodie, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his worn jeans. He rocked back on his heels when he met Steve’s eyes, a tired scrunch of laugh lines as he smiled. “Want some company?”
It was good to remember, because then, they would never die. Not as long as they lived on in his memories.
Tony didn’t trust himself to speak so he just nodded. There was a beat of silence before he felt steady fingers comb through the base of his feathers.
Steve’s eyes were distant as he stared over Tony’s shoulders. “I don’t remember much from my time in the ice. Just the cold. But some days, I can feel it pressing down on me. I imagine that’s how dying feels like, caught in the moment and helpless to do anything about it.”
It wasn’t always like that though. When he first started living in the Avengers tower, the sketchbooks Tony had bought for him went untouched. He couldn’t bring himself to draw those he had lost, because then it truly was like looking at memories through a hazy film, their features fading with each day he was awake in this new world.
“They even got my moles right,” Tony pointed to the small scattering of moles on the underside of his arm, ones that Steve had studied extensively and had a weak spot for. “If I didn’t know better I would think they knew me or something.”
Turns out, he wasn’t the only one that enjoyed drawing the Avengers. He found his first fan account on the ‘Instagram’. JARVIS had said it was for photos, but an account called monii.anoo seemed to use it to post stylized art of the Avengers.
Steve practically manipulated Tony’s body until he was in the position Steve was in. Steve seemed to be in a really good mood, and Tony was struck by the realization that it wasn’t the grooming he’d received that had him so chipper.
“Right,” Tony rolled his eyes before pushing and shoving until Steve obediently sat down on one of the benches. Tony grabbed a fresh roll of bandages and a towel before he filled a small basin with water. He sat himself down across from Steve, both of them straddling the bench.
Steve paused where he was coloring in his blue eyes. This one was a medieval au, and Steve was the dashing prince on a horse. Tony was the stable boy, and he was looking up at Steve with a flirtatious smile, a hand resting on Steve’s thigh as he leaned against the horse.
“Steve Rogers and Tony Stark,” Tony’s voice was firm, pulling away just enough to meet Steve’s look. “Just two unfairly attractive guys who like each other.”
You see, back in his day (and yes, he knew that if he said that out loud Tony would never let him live it down. It’s why he only said it in his head or in the privacy of his room with God and JARVIS as his only witnesses), everything was handwritten or manually drawn. Sure, mass production had been on the rise, but it certainly wasn’t wasted on frivolous things such as art.
“This is not about me,” Steve seemed like he was gearing up for an argument, his lips downturned in displeasure and a hint of frustration. “I didn’t want to- this wasn’t how I wanted it to happen.”
“Oh,” Steve breathed out, his free hand twitching at his side. He wanted to comfort, but he wasn’t sure how, not when he was barely functioning and lost in his own traumatic memories. “The rain sucks, doesn’t it?”
A thought occurred to him then, and he felt his wings go slack with horror. “Are you telling me that you haven’t asked any of us to groom you because you thought you didn’t need it?”
Tony was working in front of him, and since all Steve could see was his back, he couldn’t gauge how Tony felt.
“Unfairly attractive, huh?” Steve chuckled, almost drowning in the happiness he felt. He pressed a kiss against Tony’s mouth then, cutting off whatever joking remark Tony was likely to say. He was grateful that Tony knew what he was really asking, and had met him halfway.
. Tony knew he was more vocal than Steve was, but his wings were much more damaged and any sort of grooming helped ease the pain, just enough for every touch to be a rush of relief. He whimpered and groaned through each stroke of Steve’s fingers, and let out whines of pleasure as Steve coaxed his molting feathers out from where they hid.
And yeah, Tony knew all about it. Knew about Aunt Peggy and how they had been so close to courtship.
For a while, Steve was content doing what he’d always done, and that was sketching the people he loved. To immortalize them through art and shade their features with steady, reliable charcoal.
It was painful. He didn’t expect something clearly created out of love, these fics and fanart, to give him so many emotions. Steve rubbed at his chest, a frown on his face as his eyes flicked over to his open sketchbook. He’d never really drawn himself, preferring to study others.
Tony for his part seemed a bit sheepish about throwing Steve into the deep end. Honestly, it was a miracle Steve had not encountered any of the more risqué fanarts, but apparently JARVIS had been screening his online searches ‘for his sanity’. There were no such restrictions in Tony’s lab which led to their current predicament.
Thor rested a blanket over Tony's shoulders, his expression somber. Steve couldn't even raise his head to thank the god, but Thor seemed to understand. Rhodey came to sit on the arm of the chair, his hand rubbing circles into Tony's bony spine.
Tony couldn't help it. He broke down into his own peals of laughter, dropping his briefcase off near the door and going to pick up Peggy from his husband's arms. “Oh my
here has something to lose. Buck has the kids and the team, Scott has his daughter and Hope, Carol has Brunhilde...” Steve sighed once more, shaking his head. “I'm trying to do good by everyone here-”
All Steve had wanted since day one of moving in with Tony was to be worthy of the man's love. He worked and fought and sweat to earn it. And he
,” Steve croaked out, feeling one of his knees give way. He scrambled over to his family, and Pepper pulled Peter back while Rhodey grabbed Peggy tight to his chest. “Tony?” Steve croaked as he sat in front of his husband, one hand on Tony's pulse and the other on his burnt cheek. “Tony,
“No, Tony, no-” Steve hushed his husband, kissing Tony's forehead. “It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault but that purple bastard's-”
Peggy looked down at her Cheerios, poking around a bit before picking up as much of a handful as her baby fists could muster. “Good job, princess! Now you've just gotta-
, Margaret,” he choked out, hysterical tears welling in his eyes, “We aren't going to be able to send you to day-care, are we?”
Bucky would be lying if he said he wasn't a little startled at that. The last time Peggy had an accident was when she was eight and Steve had been MIA on a secret mission for nearly a month. Tony had been a wreck, and Peter- God bless him- had somehow managed to keep a cool enough head to help his father and little sister. So when Peggy said she had an accident...
Sam was blushing and bristling when Bruce started up the machine, and then the man disappeared. As Bruce was counting down the seconds to Sam's return, Steve leaned in close to Bucky. “What was
For a minute, Tony was silent. He mulled over everyone's words, his chin dipping down to stare at Steve's fingers interlocked with his. And then, Tony's face tilted up, and his once-dead eyes were blazing even stronger than Carol's had been. There was no force of suns behind his eyes, only a fearsome vengeance and undying love of a father present in his gaze.
I have the last chapter, the Endgame chapter, written. And I've reordered the chapters to have this one as the second and the previous one (Tony and Steve meeting back up) as chapter 3.
“Water,” Rhodey was suddenly at the couple's side, his hand resting on Tony's back. “Someone get the man some fucking water.”
Tony was quiet for a long while. His hands, shaking terribly, raised up to touch Steve's arms. He opened his mouth, then closed it, then opened it again. When Tony tried to speak, only a low, dry gasp came out.
“Tony...?” Steve rasped, his throat suddenly dry. “Tony, where- what-” The soldier shook his head, then reached out and gripped his husband's shoulders, pulling the other man into a firm embrace. Cautious of Tony's weakened state, Steve burrowed his face in the crook of Tony's neck, one of his hands going up to thread through the man's hair. It was longer and dirtier, greasy to the touch.
I'm thinking about writing a fic with Rhodey and Bucky babysitting their godkids (because of course Peter and Peggy are their godkids), but if you have any ideas then pLEASE LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENT SECTION! :D I LOVE GETTING WRITING PROMPTS!!
Steve watched, in awe, as the stones moved by themselves onto Tony's hand, a myriad of lightning and color lighting up the man's arm. Steve was immobilized by fear and awe, afraid of what he would see next, but unable to look awake.
His hands were shaking as he collapsed to his knees, eyes wide yet unseeing as he stared at the ground. His heart didn't drop to his stomach, and tears didn't come to his eyes. His chest was so tight, so
“Cap!” Clint cheered from across the hallway. He waved one hand in the air, the other wrapped around a mug of coffee. “Good morning! You're up early. Didn't you just get back?”
“Can we have that for dinner tonight?” Peter asked, spraying crumbs everywhere when he spoke through his mouthful of sweets. Tony made a mental note to change the kid’s bedsheets later, there was definitely a quarter of a cookie spilling down Peter’s shirt and onto the bed he was sitting on.
“Aww, did you miss us, Stevie?” Bucky teased, kicking his feet up on the coffee table. “If you wanted to see me that bad you didn’t need to make up an emergency for it.”
After a crying episode like that one on Sunday, the genius had thought his son had gotten all the upset out of his system.
He'd only been half paying attention to her explanation so when he approached the art room, he was immensely grateful for the bright, garish sign hanging on the door. Only stopping for a second to ponder what kind of cardigans an old man with the name 'Mr. Rogers' was parading around in, he shoved the door aside. His eyes zeroed in on his son, who was currently sitting at the table and drawing something that looked suspiciously like the Millenium Falcon.
Then three years later there were pictures from troops stationed in Russia of an enemy sniper with shaggy, brown hair and a Hydra symbol on the back of his uniform. Even through the scruff and the dark bruises under his eyes, Steve could tell right away that, somehow, that was his Bucky.
Steve was currently as far into the supply closet as he physically could get, sorting through stacks of construction paper and sorting it into color coded piles. He wasn’t hiding, wasn’t stalling as he heard a brief knock on the door frame! He wasn’t!
Steve glanced over at the newest addition to their group, a tiny first grade boy who he had seen run off the bus into the gym a couple times before he had shown up to his art room a couple weeks ago.
“No. I’m not going with you!” He yelled back, jerking his shoulder out of his father’s reach and angrily scribbling onto his paper with a crayon.
“Stop it, you’ll make me blush,” Bucky scoffed, grinning down at the genius. “You’re such a flirt, Mr. Stark. I bet you say that to all the grumpy, brainwashed amputees around this place.”
The group of children who, more often than not, chose art over gym were starting to trickle in through the door and he greeted them from where he was grabbing the cups of paint brushes off the back counters.
Steve peeked his head up over top of the table. Sure enough, the billionaire was back in his class room, standing awkwardly next to his son. Tony looked a bit hurt at the lack of reaction from his kid, but not surprised. The teacher couldn’t help but wonder what had happened since Friday to make Peter so cold towards his father.
Jeez, he was laying it on thick. But damn if he didn’t feel guilty enough to fold like a deck of cards.
Steve wanted to scream when he saw Thanos with the gauntlet. His mouth opened, his hand reaching out, but nothing more than a gasp emerged from his lips.
Steve didn't know how long they all stayed there, the silence echoing around them. Soon enough, the sound of Steve's heart beating in his ears, the sound of blood pumping through his veins, became deafening.
. She reached a shaky hand towards her father, and Steve let out a distraught cry as he saw the ashes of her skin fading up and away, twirling into the air. “Pa-Papa-” Peggy gasped out.
“I did...” Steve drawled out as he poured himself a cup of juice. “But FRIDAY said that I would want to see what was going on in the kitchen. So what's up, Nat? Sam? Cl-”
“Oh, please,” Clint rolled his eyes. “You should hear some of the stories Bucky tells about Steve. He sure was a trash-mouth back in the day, apparently.”
The AI didn't reply, but allowed the darkness to filter away through soft white lighting. Bucky looked at Peggy, inspecting her to make sure she wasn't injured-
“N-No,” Peggy all but whimpered, shuffling in her sea otter-themed pajamas. She rubbed at teary eyes, her lower lip wobbling as she looked up at her uncle. “I- I had an a-a-accident...”
when she says my name first!” Clint held his phone closer to Peggy as the baby grabbed at her hair, frustrated that her uncle was holding her back from her breakfast. “C'mon, princess, just say 'Clint' and we can go on with our lives. Cllllll-int.
“Okay, okay, okay,” Steve spoke to himself as he slumped out of his and Tony's room, dragging a hand down his face. “Papa's coming, baby.”
That drew a giggle from the girl, which Bucky counted as a win. “Okay, waffles it is,” he sighed in faux disappointment. “Blueberry or chocolate-chip?”
It was sad that the statement didn't take Steve by surprise. After two years, he had lost hope in finding his husband and son. Hell, he had lost his best friend and daughter already- they had turned into ashes right before his eyes. And there had been no sign on Earth of Tony or Peter, so Steve had... all but given up. It sounded terrible now, with his husband in his arms- malnourished and broken, but
Sam was kneeling over in his chair by then, doing his best to breathe through the hacks of laughter. Natasha was grinning at Clint's misery, stroking her hands through Peggy's fuzzy hair. “Good job, my little star,” the woman crooned as she kissed Peggy's head.”
“Yea, yea, squirt,” Clint took a sip of coffee. “Keep up the hard work and you'll be chattier than your Dad soon enough.”
Bucky thought, paling as he noticed the blood staining the crotch of the girl's pajama pants. It took several moments of internal panicking about where and when and
Portals began opening up all around, dozens of them with hundreds of heroes pouring out to meet Thanos's army. Steve choked when he saw his son swing out of a portal with the rest of Rocket's crew, flipping onto his feet with narrowed eye-lenses. Peter glanced up, saw his father, and
“Jesus,” Steve groaned, collapsing against the counter-top. “I swear, Clint, I'm gonna shove your arrows right where the sun doesn't shine.”
Bruce seemed to be faring a little better than the others- only a little. He seemed just as in shock as them, but still managed to limp over to where Steve had collapsed, Natasha holding the soldier's shoulders in a vice.
The engineer's eyes seemed to clear up from their deathly glaze when he realized they were sitting inside the Compound. His head swiveled as he searched the room for-
Strange's voice had Tony turning to look at him, his heart growing heavy. “There was no other way,” Strange rasped out, shaking his head slightly, before he too faded to ashes right before Tony's eyes.
“Well,” Sam chimed in, “Peggy's in her mimicking phase, and she's only just learning how to talk. You'd best watch out, Clint.”
Whirling on his heel, turning away from Thanos and Thor, Steve was stricken by the voice of his best friend. Bucky looked confused. Steve watched, completely and utterly helpless, as Bucky reached for him and
“Well,” Sam managed to right himself long enough to say, “Looks like she's gonna be taking after Stark after all.”
They managed to limp back into the Compound, Steve nearly carrying Tony inside. Vaguely, Steve noticed a blue-skinned woman dragging behind them, assisted by Natasha. Carol got inside first- she seemed to be the kind to rush in to things head-first- and pulled over a lounge chair. Steve helped Tony to sit and crouched in front of the man, holding one of Tony's hands in both of his. Bruce went to the med-bay to grab a first aid kit, ordering Thor to grab blankets for Tony and the blue woman. Clint dipped out and then reappeared with more water and a few granola bars, but Steve highly doubted Tony would be eating any time soon.
?!” Steve demanded as he crossed over to his daughter, picking the baby up out of her seat and cuddling her to his chest. He narrowed his eyes at Clint, scowling. “Want to try to explain
Clint winced. “Yeouch. Yea, I remember when Cooper was that age...” The archer's eyes looked his teammate up and down, and Steve could tell he was debating something. Finally, Clint sighed heavily and started waving Steve off. “Go on, Cap, go back to bed.”
“Gone.” The word was poison on Steve's tongue, bile rising in his throat as the words he had fought against for so long lifted from his lips. “She's gone, Tony.”
. Sure, he was an asshole at times, but his charm more than made up for it. Not to mention his genius, his respect for his teammates, his love for his family...
Steve's breath was hitching now, on the verge of panic as it threatened to push him over that cliff.
He had gotten back from a mission earlier that morning, stripped of his armor, kissed his husband, and fallen into bed. Only a few hours later, he blinked awake to the sounds of Tony shuffling around. “I'm taking Pete to school,” Tony told his husband, kissing Steve tenderly. “Peggy should sleep for a little while longer.”
Clint whirled around towards the baby, a grin overtaking his features. “Did you just say my name?! Guys! Guys! I think she's trying to say 'Clint'!”
Clint jumped and all but covered Peggy's face with his hand, drawing an unimpressed glare from Steve. The man was leaning against the kitchen door frame, hair damp and a towel wrapped around his shoulders.
kinds of side-effects, and he had always been protective of Peggy, even before he was comfortable being in charge of her. “You feeling okay?” He asked, reaching forward to feel her forehead. Was having a fever another side-effect? Pepper always complained about being too hot during her time of the month. Peggy
A heavy sense of dread filled Tony's chest, and he whipped his head around to see his son stumbling towards him.
Tony barked out a defeated laugh, shaking his head. He then turned to Carol, any confusion he may have about the woman's identity was momentarily forgotten in his stupor. “And how the fuck do you suppose we get them?”
Steve had snatched up a spatula and was swatting Clint's head, chasing after the archer when he hopped up and tried to escape. Peggy was squealing happily and clapping her hands as her Papa chased her uncle around the kitchen, cursing all the while.
“Yea, squirt,” Bucky piped in. “Maybe I can order in some pizza for lunch and we can have a movie-marathon kinda day.”
When the archer put out some Cheerios for Peggy, the baby began bouncing in her seat and chanting, “Ba ba ba bababa!”
Maybe there was some credit to this social media thing. It was certainly a way to share art with a wider audience and interact with people at the same time. That thought stuck with him as he went down to the workshop that night, a daily habit that Tony seemed to encourage. Though Tony tried, Steve still wouldn’t let Tony see his art. It was too personal, and more than a little embarrassing that even though he did draw the other Avengers, a majority of his sketchbook was filled with Tony.
“We don’t have to,” Steve’s tone was gentle, and maybe it was that show of kindness that made Tony relax, his arms dropping down to his sides and breaking the touch. “You’re in control here.”
He groomed the wings thoroughly and with a single-minded focus, until he was finally done and the wings looked even more perfect than before.
“I wasn’t-,” Steve’s protest was cut short when Tony crossed the gym with a determined stride and grabbed his hand. He froze, a different kind of warmth filling him as he watched the way Tony’s eyebrows scrunched together in concern, a displeased twist to his mouth completing the picture.
Steve wanted to keep it all to himself, this side of Tony that other people rarely got to see. He paused, fingers stilling where he’d been perfecting Tony’s goatee. Steve tilted his head, studying his own art in a way he hadn’t in a long time. He wanted to keep Tony to himself, but at the same time, he wanted others to see that Tony was more than just Iron Man.
Steve knew Tony was only joking, but he still spent the evening trying to perfect the dip of Tony’s back, and the way his hair stuck up at odd angles. By the end of it, he had a rather stunning image of Tony bent over the table, muscles highlighted by scattering sparks. Steve stared at it for a long minute, trying to ignore the clear affection that shone through every stroke of his pencil.
Peggy whined as she sat up in her crib, making grabby-hands towards Clint as the archer approached. “Hiya, princess,” Clint cooed to the baby, only succeeding in making her whine more. “Alright, alright, don't get your diaper in a bunch.” Placing his mug to the side, Clint reached down and picked up the baby, tossing her in the air a bit. Peggy's whines quickly turned to giggles, and she babbled relentlessly as Clint cuddled her close. “You are so lovable!” Clint chirped, kissing her chubby cheek. Peggy only giggled more, one hand reaching out to pat her uncle's face. She was clearly intrigued by his morning stubble, because she began babbling louder and rubbing her little hands up and down Clint's chin. “You hungry, baby?”
She wasn't supposed to be here. She was supposed to be back at the palace, hidden away behind the strongest doors and highest towers of Wakanda. But, even before Steve turned to look, he
“It was a three day conference in Las Vegas. I doubt it was as bad as you were letting on,” Pepper huffed as she took her former employer’s elbow and led him to the elevator.
