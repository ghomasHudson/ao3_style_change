“How?”
“Oh how lovely, you came with all those people. Are your dudes going to get a picture with Santa too?” She nods enthusiastically.
“Wave bye bye to uncle Sam” Cas told the twins and they both waved their little arms excitedly.
Cas flops down face first on his bed. The weight of the last few days holding him down and he silently wonders if it was all really worth it. All the secrets and lies? In the end all they did was cause him heartache.
Castiel wasn’t blind, Dean was a very attractive man and the first time they’d met he’d gotten so flustered that he could barely speak. Dean didn’t seem all that impressed with him after that and then the first project they worked on together was a complete disaster. Well, technically the project wasn’t a disaster, it had come out great. Dean’s impression of Castiel on the other hand...  The presence of the unfairly attractive man turned Castiel's brain to mush and he thought it would be a good idea to show off his skills in a vain attempt to impress him. In retrospect he could see how his actions may have made him seem arrogant and controlling. And with every subsequent project they worked on together it just seemed to get worse.
“We should do it again sometime.” Eileen says confidently. She’s never really been one to beat around the bush and she likes Sam.
He're a recipe for cream cheese sugar cookies. There's a frosting recipe on the website too but I alway do a cream cheese frosting on cream cheese sugar cookies so that's what I had Dean do.
“That wasn’t our first kiss was it?” Dean asks slowly. Cas shakes his head, unable to meet Dean’s eye’s again.
“Sam are you there?” His dad’s voice booms through his laptop speakers.
“Dean, are you afraid of Santa?” Cas tries to hide his smile. His big tough husband, afraid of Santa Claus.
“Your memory is back.” Cas says, just as confused.
“And we love you too Miracle.”
“What’s going on Dean?” Dean hesitates and looks at Cas. Silently asking if he can tell Sam what happened. Cas nodes.
“Because we had no future!” Cas shouts. “Our relationship was going nowhere and as much as it hurt to let it end I like that I thought it would be best. This way we could move on and you wouldn’t get hurt. You hated lying to your family and I knew that if we continued as we were you’d eventually come to resent me. I was trying to save us the heartache of a messy breakup. Which would have been made even worse by the fact that we couldn’t talk to anyone about it.”
“That’s ok, I think I might have an idea.” Dean tells her and starts tapping away at his phone looking for a store that would have what he wants.
“I just spoke to her last week.” He says in disbelief. “We’re having family dinner tomorrow.”
“No he didn’t kick me out. I left.” Dean grumbles.
“Whatever.” Clair grumbles and stabs at her food aggressively. Dean and Cas share a look.
“I miss you too,” Dean tries not to cringe at the chick flick moment “and Eileen. Maybe next year we can plan something.” He tries to compromise.
Dean looks around the parking garage and then suddenly smiles and points up. Sam follows his gaze and catches sight of a surveillance camera.
“You hate Santa?” Jack asks in disbelief.
“You’re leaving?” He asked and Cas could clearly see the poorly covered disappointment in his eyes.
“How did you know I wanted Cowboy boots?” Dean lifts his foot for emphasis. “And how did you know my size.”
“You never said that art exhibit thing was a date and you didn’t tell me he was moving in because you were in a relationship. You told me his lease was up at his old place and you made it sound like he was just staying with you until he found a new place.” Sam argues.
His wardrobe hasn’t changed much, a few new items but nothing unusual. He finds a sweatshirt tucked in the back of his closet that looks vaguely familiar but he know’s it’s not one of his. He picks up the sweater and finds a box underneath it.
They part ways soon after that and Dean drives home with a smile permanently stretched across his face. He’s even forgotten why he’s mad at Sam.
“It’s not too bad. I was just a baby when they died so I don’t really remember them.” Eileen explains and Sam feels a pang of sympathy.
“Hi mom.” Dean smiles and gives his mom a quick side hug. “This is Cas.” He gestures to the man behind him.
“I don’t know what you want from me Char, the guy’s about as interesting as a fence post. He has no decorations in his office, his secretary could only tell me about his tie collection, which is also pretty pathetic, and he’s too self absorbed to talk to anyone else in the office. How am I supposed to find out anything about him. Let alone get him a gift?”
“My turn.” Ellen says after seeing the look on Dean’s face. He silently thanks her for saving him. She doesn’t know why he’s stopped dating but she knows when something is none of her, or anybody else’s, business.  They all turn to Ellen as she tells a funny story about Dean sneaking one of her pies out of the fridge last thanksgiving. He’d been caught and forced to help make a new one that he wasn’t allowed to touch.
“So, someone or something is using Christmas songs to kill people?” Dean asks around a mouth full of food a while later.
“That’s what I thought when I spoke to my mother last week. Don’t blow off your parents for me Dean. I’ll be fine.” Cas sits up and wipes at the fresh tears before they can fall.
“Yep, it’s almost our turn.” Cas smiled down at him.
“Yeah” He says loud enough for his mother to hear. She opens the door and peeks in.
“Maybe” he said with a grin. Clair wanted to face palm. Her dad was gonna be in so much trouble with Santa.
The shrill ringing of his phone makes him jump and knock the box off the bed. The contents scattering across the floor and the tie falling limply at his feet. For a moment Dean looks at the offending device and sees Jo’s name flash across the screen.
Cas wakes the next morning to the sound of someone pounding on his door. He groggily stumbles through the apartment and wrenches it open, ready to smite the person on the other side.
------------------
It was just a light peck on the lips. He didn’t even think about it. It just happened. Just like that, and it felt so natural. He turns back to Cas with an apology already forming on his lips. Cas is staring at him with a shocked expression but his pupils are blown wide and a pretty blush is painted across his cheeks. Dean’s seen that look before. He knows he has, he can’t quite say where he’s seen it but he knows what it means. He’d be willing to bet money that the same look is on his face as well. He takes a step closer and pulls Cas into another kiss.
“Yeah I was trying to give you guys space it looked like a monster of a project and Dean was really stressed about it being worth fifty percent of your grades.”
“No, I’ll be fine. You can go.”
The rest of the evening goes a lot smoother and Mary makes a note to ask Sam more about this Cas person when Dean is not around. She didn’t fail to notice how defensive her eldest got when the subject was brought up. John didn’t miss it either.
“I want to believe that you’re exaggerating but I know you're not.” Charlie sighs, “So if it’s not Becky, who else would make you grimace like that?” She taps her finger to her chin.
He hadn’t realised just how much he missed getting random memes during the day and his traitorous mind started to wonder if the memes meant that Dean remembered him.
“Wanna grab lunch. I’ve got an hour and I’m already halfway to your place.” She says and Dean knows that means he doesn’t really have a choice in the matter.
When Sam and Eileen get back from their hunt later that night they’re surprised to see a plate of colorfully decorated Christmas cookies on the table. Eileen grabs a couple before following Sam to his room. He may not be a fan of eating sweets late at night but she is.
“What?” Cas splutters. “Of course she’s a girl Gabriel. What else would she be? A...a... bumblebee?” Cas panics internally trying to remember everything he’d said to his brother that could possibly tip him off to the fact that he was dating a man.
“Are we thinking witch or angry spirit?”
“Please Dean, I need you.” Cas mumbles against his skin and it breaks his resolve. He pulls Cas into a deep kiss and rolls to pin him to the bed. Cas groans and bucks his hips up against Dean.
“I’m not really a genius.” Cas mumbles and his cheeks go red. “And of the two of us I’m the least intimidating.”
“Your little one? Is there something you haven’t told me?” Dean looks at Sam in shock.
While Sam ties his shoes Eileen returns their skates. When she gets back to him the bleeding has mostly stopped but there’s blood all over his coat and gloves.
“I know, I know. I just-- I’d never forgive myself if I allowed them to do this and it ended up scaring them for life, ya know” Dean sighs.
“How am I supposed to know. You’ve known them longer. That’s why I was asking you in the first place.” Charlie drums her fingers lightly on the keyboard, not pressing them down hard enough to type anything, just making a light clicking sound.
He takes a sip, still facing away from the other people in the room. As much as he loves Sam and Eileen he can’t really stand to be in the same room as them for too long. They’re getting their happy ending and he’s happy for them. He really, truly is but that doesn’t make it hurt less. Every time he sees them share a drawn out glance or gently bump shoulders when they’re walking side by side, his chest aches just a little bit more. And it’s even worse when they notice him looking away when they’re having a moment because then they get these pitying looks, and they try to do things to make him feel included. Like they’re worried about him feeling like a third wheel or something.
“Yeah, well, normal people anyways.”
“Well, well, well,  look who finally came home. Hot date tonight Cassy?” He smirks and flicks off the tv.
Cas runs his hands through his hair and takes a step away from the door. He could just leave and no one would know. He could text Sam and say he had a last minute emergency.  But what  if Dean is here?  He wonders. Cas has wanted to see Dean again since their impromptu movie date Not Date he reminds himself. He pushes his finger against the doorbell before he can talk himself out of it and then proceeds to panic until the door opens to reveal a very handsome Dean in a dark blue button down with damp hair and a small bit of shaving cream just under his ear.
“She had tickets to see a show with some friends. I didn’t want her to have to cancel at the last minute. I’ve only had like…” he pauses for several seconds “four vodka tonics or maybe six?”
“Why would I do that?”
Cas peers at the cookies on the tray as Dean pulls it out of the oven.
“Just a little” Cas grimaces. “I can carry my stuff Dean, you don’t have to.” He tries to take his bags from Dean.
“What was that?”
“I don’t bite you know, and I showered this morning.” Dean says, as if he can’t think of any other reason why Cas wouldn’t want to share a bed with him.
“And you waited until now to tell me. Actually you didn’t tell me, you told Charlie.” Sam says angrily.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, it’s not that simple.” He sighs. “She sustained a pretty serious head injury and she doesn’t really remember me. I mean I guess she remembers me in a way, we had a few classes together before we graduated and he remembers being classmates but he doesn’t remember dating me at all. And when we ran into each other at the movie theater he sat next to me and it felt just like it did before. It was almost like things had gone back to normal but he still doesn’t remember me.” Cas lets it all out in a rush and doesn’t realize that half way through he’d forgotten to use female pronouns. Gabe catches it but chooses not to comment.
“Sam, how many kids did this guy have?” Dean’s still looking at the stockings hanging above the fireplace.
“Dean?” Sam shouts as he follows after his brother.
“Dean the dragon shoots fire out of his mouth!” Jack says in awe.
“That’s ok, I don’t need gifts but I did bring a gift for you. Well I guess it's for you and Sam in a way, but mostly for you.” Jack smiles at him mischievously.
“Frozen?”
“Why is that box moving?” he asks.
“You have nothing to apologize for honey.” She strokes his hair and he buries his face in her shoulder. They stand there for several minutes until Cas takes a deep shuddery breath and gently pulls away.
“Castiel ordered pizza.” Chuck tells him and then eyes Dean suspiciously. “Out of all of them I thought it’d be Michael that was secretly gay.”
“By Sam. See you next week.” She gives him a kiss on the cheek and then leaves. Sam watches her drive away with his hand pressed to the spot her lips had touched.
“Ok everyone, so our table really only seats four comfortably but you’re all welcome to sit in the living room if you’d like, make yourselves comfortable. Plates and forks are on the counter just grab what you want and find a seat.” Sam instructed.
“Ok kid now put the mixer on low and keep going while I add in the rest of the wet ingredients.” After all the wet ingredients are mixed together Dean slowly starts adding in the flour, salt, and baking powder while Jack mixes.
“OK, what’s your wife's name sir?” She starts typing and asking questions about Eileen and who her doctor is and then tells him she’ll get a nurse to show them to a room.
Jo is there soon after and the box is forgotten while the two get lunch and chat about the two years Dean is missing. It’s nice and Dean is thankful for his friend for thinking of him. It’s not until they’re getting ready to leave that Dean sees a flash of blue eyes and dark hair and his thoughts turn back to the secret hidden in his closet and the feeling nagging just below the surface. Something is not right in Dean’s world and he has no idea what it could be.
Sam’s girlfriend seemed nice. She’d come over early to help with the cooking and set up. She and Sam would joke about things that had happened in the few months they’d been dating but Dean had no idea what they were talking about and he felt it was insight into how the rest of the evening would progress.
“Cool see you in a few.” She singsongs and then hangs up. Dean hastily gathers the box and it’s scattered contents and stuffs it back in his closet where he found it. He’s not sure whey he’s keeping it a secret but he knows he doesn’t want Sam to accidentally find it. It’s private and the things inside hold some kind of importance to him, even if he doesn’t remember what that might be.
“What are you crazy kids up to?” Dean asks and Sam knows he’s lost his chance to get away. He reluctantly follows Eileen into the war room and Dean’s gaze immediately zeroes in on his busted up nose. He looks at Eileen and gestures toward Sam.
Cas turned to see a tall man with familiar eyes standing over him, he was holding a coffee cup in one hand and a cup of juice in the other.
“Oh, does he have a crush on this girl then?”
“What name did you decide on?” He asks and the small hand wraps around his finger in a surprisingly tight grip.
“Dean” Sam starts but Dean cuts him off.
“You wanna grab dinner?” Dean stands up and pats down his pockets to make sure he has his keys and wallet in a way that says ‘I’m going to go get food so decide now if you want to come along’ and then Sam’s phone rings.
“Dude, Adler talked about your genius non stop before you were hired. Hell, he still talks about you constantly. I might have been a little intimidated when we were working on projects together.” Dean doesn’t know why he’s admitting to that last part but the look on Cas’ face makes it worth it
“We’re done actually. When we got there Daniel, that hunter we met in tulsa a couple years back, he was already there, He’d caught wind of it the same time we did but he was closer so he beat us to the punch. We decided to just turn around and head back home. I was actually calling to see if Jack wanted anything from the burger place in town. Figured we stop on the way back but if you guys are out we can just get something for the two of us and head back to the bunker.”
“You like orange juice.” Cas argued. He knew better than to try and reason with an emotional four year old but Jack was a pretty level headed child most days. And he truly did like orange juice, he was just tired and cranky from being woken up too early.
She’d been trying to get Dean and Novak in the same room for the past five months and it had never worked. Dean flat out refused to let her set him up with anyone so she’d resorted to deception to get him to the coffee shop whenever Novak was there but he’d either miss her call, or he’d answer and believe whatever bulshit reason she gave for needing him to come down to the shop right at that moment, and he’d end up walking in just moments after the other man had left. She’d even tried on multiple occasions to have him be in the coffee shop before Novak showed up, the guy stuck to a pretty regular schedule so they could normally anticipate when he’d show. But Dean had had to leave because of an emergency at work or with his roommate and one time he’d ran into a woman who spilled her coffee all over him and while he was in the bathroom cleaning up Novak came in and ordered his coffee and left. Charlie almost pulled out all of her hair on that day.
“Oh” Dean nods and they sit awkwardly for a second.
This is the meme Dean sent if you wanted to know.
“Dean” Cas starts and he can sense the argument coming.
Gabe’s on the phone still but he motions for Cas to come take it. When he does he hears his father’s voice on the line and Fresh tears well up in his eyes. Gabe takes a calming breath and wipes his eyes while Cas talks to their father. He goes to the kitchen to start a pot of coffee and rummages through his brother’s fridge. He’s not actually hungry but it’s something to do and in the back of his mind he acknowledges that he hasn’t eaten anything since the night before and Cas probably hasn’t either. After a few minutes he settles on heating up some leftover pizza and taking a slice to Cas who nibbles at it for a moment before abandoning it on the coffee table.
“So, back in June” Garth started. “Dean came over to my place with Benny and Sam and . . .” He giggled.” And they were all dressed in bikinis. Like barely any coverage at all, tiny, women’s bikinis, and they were all smashed. Apparently they’d lost a bet to Jo and they had to go knock on a stranger’s door and say trick or treat. I’d just moved in a few weeks prior so they didn’t know it was my house.” Garth giggled some more.
“I think I just saw Hannah enter, you should probably go give her a number.” He tells her and she immediately starts scanning the crowd, spotting Hanna talking to Becky.
“Well, your mother is.” John says and Mary gives him a light shove.
“I don’t like it.” Cas mumbles petulantly.
“According to the witness, yeah.” Sam nods “He said after she handed it to him he freaked out and dropped it and then she collapsed. She was dead when the paramedics got there.”
“Dreams?”
“Now, the bait.” He presses on Dean’s name to make the call.
He wandered through the toys isles at a complete loss when a young woman finally took pity on him.
“Miracle?”
“Sam!” He yells and his uncle grunts when the full force of the excited child lands on his lap.
“Two years ago yeah. But you barely even flirt with women when we go out anymore.” Sam’s words don’t really come as a shock to Dean. He’d been getting tired of flirting with women all the time. They really just didn’t do it for him and he found the constant pretending exhausting. Maybe two years of that finally just wore him down.
“Jack, why don’t you go help daddy with breakfast and Clair and I will meet you downstairs in a minute.” Cas plucked the boy off the bed and set him on his feet in the doorway. He gave him a light swat on the bottom to get him moving then he turned to the sullen little girl hiding under her covers.
Cas’ family on the other hand was extremely religious and believed that homosexuality was a sin that one needed to repent of. Gabe had fallen away from the faith during college and so had Cas, but their older brother Michael and his wife were still very devout and so were their parents. Cas and Gabe still went to church with the family when they were home visiting and they tried not to throw it in their parent’s faces that they didn’t share their beliefs.
There is indeed a very serious train situation when he gets to the address Cas gave him. When he’d said the tracks covered the living room and dining room he forgot to mention the kitchen and hallway as well.
Their image comes back and he can see them squinting at the screen. Then he sees his brother in the background and waves him over.
Dean doesn’t pick up and while Charlie is having a meltdown over his uncooperative brother Sam finds himself suddenly taking over the cash register, again, because Jessica has disappeared in the back to get more straws. Just in time for the other source of Charlie’s annoyance to place his order. Sam’s ready to key in the man’s usual order when he hears his least favorite word come out of the guy’s mouth.
“I’m fine, just hanging out in my dorm waiting for the snow to let up.” Sam gives her an unconvincing smile.
“Ok,” Dean scrubs at his face and then gives Cas a smile, “Ok.”
“Don’t play innocent with me. I know you’re not that naive.” He gets right up in Cas’ personal space but the angel doesn’t back down.
“Dean…” Cas sighs. “I didn’t say anything because at first I was angry with you. We’d made plans and then you just disappeared. I thought you were breaking up with me and then I found out about your accident and I felt guilty for being angry. After that I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t just call you and ask to hang out because two years ago you didn’t even know my name and I doubted you’d feel comfortable inviting a stranger over. And then when I came over for dinner with your friends and family I knew you wouldn’t want me spilling our secret in front of everyone. I couldn’t get you alone for long enough to tell you.”
“Are you stealing some of my cookies.” The jolly, yet slightly familiar, voice asked and her dad quickly dropped the cookie he was holding. He turned to the owner of the voice, someone Clair couldn’t see, and gave a smirk.
“That’s practically the definition of a dinner party Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah?”
They sing Jingle Bells and then they’re instructed to sit further back on the stage while one of the older classes tells a story. Then Jack’s class is asked to stand again and they sing Silver Bells. Later that evening when they drive back home Dean will comment on how good the bells sounded when the children used them in the songs, and how good they all were at holding their bells still while they were singing. Jack will tell him about how many times the teacher made them practice and how they’d even been late to recess once because some of the other children wouldn’t stop messing around.
After a few hours of research Cas closed the laptop and looked at Jack. The kid’s nose was buried so deep in a book Cas wondered if he’d found the secret to life, or something of great importance.
“Uh, yeah, everything’s all good. Why don’t you lock the door after we leave and then run on back to bed?” Sam gives her his most reassuring smile.
“What’s the hold up?” He asks.
“And what gives you the right to make that decision for me?” Dean seeths.
“Course not. We should get going though, if we don’t want to be late.” Dean motions for Cas to go get changed and then tells Sam they’ll be there to pick him up in a few minutes. While Cas is getting dressed Dean Calls his mom.
“Alright, I think I got it.” Dean groans and stands up, stretching his back and observing the tree with a slight tilt to the right. He frowns but decides that it’s as good as it’s gonna get. Who cares if the tree isn’t perfectly straight?
He slowly pulls the paper away from the box, careful not to tear it and then lifts the lid and a shy smile stretches across his face.
They visit a few more stores and Sam helps Jack pick out some christmas gifts for Dean and Cas and they’re about to leave when Jack asks if he can borrow Sam’s credit card. Sam hands the card over easily but when he asks Jack what he needs it for, Jack just tells him he’ll meet him at the car and takes off in the opposite direction.
“Yeah it’s a machine that plays records, kinda like an old cd player.” Sam tries to explain, not realising that Jack doesn’t know what a CD is either.
“Daddy, can Dean come to work with us. I promise we’ll play extra quiet and not make a mess.” Jack looks up with pleading eyes and reaches up to grab a hold of the man’s arm.
“No, just went to a movie.” Cas mumbles, hoping for a miracle but knowing his brother wouldn’t let it drop that easily.
“Ruin it?”
“Should we be mad about her getting out of bed and spying on us after bedtime.” Dean whispers while the kids rip into their presents. He’s got his arms around Cas’ waste from behind and his chin resting on his shoulder.
“What the hell are you talking about? And why are you leaving? Dean!” Sam yells after him. He looks at Cas for an explanation but Cas still won’t meet his eyes. Dean whirls around and glares at his brother.
“What was the address again?” Dean drives baby slowly down the street trying to see the numbers on the houses.
“Should we reschedule with Sam and Eileen?” Dean asks but before Cas can answer the doorbell rings.
“Friend? Like an actual friend or a ‘friend’ friend?”
“Elvis?” Sam nods “Blue Christmas, blue dead guy, could be a coincidence but we should check out that record player later tonight.”
“Nothing happened Gabe. Just having a bad day.”
“You can go find a place on the rug. Mommy and I will just be back here with uncle Dean and uncle Cas.” She runs over to an open space and plops down.
“I don’t think Cas has ever met Cassy.” He says.
Dean takes a step back to observe their work. It’s almost perfect but there's something missing. Then his eyes focus on the top of the tree.
“Was this playing when you came downstairs or did he have music playing on a different device?” he points to the record player.
“I’ll tell you if you tell me who has my name.” He bargains but she just shakes her head,
“No, of course he doesn’t think that. You didn’t know and he probably didn’t want to talk about it anyways.”
Later that night they go back to the first victim’s house and they do find a hex bag in the record player. They search the second victim's house but don’t find anything until Sam remembers that her boyfriend said the music was playing on her phone so they break into the evidence locker at the police station and find one in her purse. It takes them considerably longer to shovel enough snow out of the third victim’s room so they can get to the alarm clock. Sam pops the battery out and finds the hex bag stuffed inside the clock. After that they go through each victim's lives with a fine toothed comb to try and find any connection but they’re unable to find any leads.
“My parents are gone too.” Sam blurts out. “I mean, just uh… I know how hard it is on the holidays.” He’s babbling and he can’t stop. He used to be good at this but ever since Jess he’s lost the ability to not be awkward around beautiful women.
“Do you not like that term? Do you prefer partner?”
Jess: I know you said you were flying out to see your parents today but I’m guessing you probably ended up in the same boat as me and your flight got canceled.
“Might as well give these deviants what they want. It don’t have to be anything special, just a quick peck between friends.” He reassures her. She screws her eyes shut and pushes up on her tiptoes to plant a quick kiss to his lips. The kiss lasts less than half a second but they both pull away with red faces and look anywhere but at each other. The party guests all cheer and then someone asks if they can cut into the pie yet and that’s when they learn that the pie has disappeared. In the middle of all the excitement Dean had snuck in behind Benny and Charlie and grabbed the pie but his attempt to make a clean break with it was thwarted by Castiel. Dean offered him half the pie for his silence and after a very short, like, almost nonexistent, deliberation he agreed and the two of them snuck out the back door with the pie and two forks.
“Deal.”
After Cas left the other guests started to taper off too, leaving Dean and Sam to tidy up before heading to bed. Sam only managed five minutes after the last guest left before asking Dean about New York again.
“Yeah, I’m free next saturday. My Santa job will be over after this week so I’ll have my weekends back.”
“What one can I get for…” He counts the bills and then digs out some change and counts that too “three dollars and fifteen cents?” He asks and Jack deliberates for a moment. He settles on a picture that’s mostly light green with a few patches of dark green and brown mixed in. The man takes the picture and looks at it closely.
They sit there for nearly an hour, lost in their own thoughts, before Gabe speaks again.
It’s been six weeks since Dean’s accident and he’s finally falling into a comfortable routine. He goes to work in the morning, has dinner with Sam most nights, goes out on the weekends with Benny or Jo. He even met a nice girl named Cassy one of those weekends. He took her out to dinner and while she most certainly wasn’t his type he could appreciate her sense of humor and beautiful smile. She was exactly the type of girl his parents would expect him to bring home.
Cas calls them to dinner a little while later and Jack whines about having to put away his toys until Eileen turns it into a game. Sam smiles at how easily she connects with his nephew. He knows he shouldn’t be surprised she works with children at Cas’ school so obviously she’s good with kids.
While he examines the fabric he has a mental image of Castiel grabbing hold of it and pulling it’s wearer in close for a messy, desperate kiss. He can imagine what it would be like to have the handsome man hold him hostage with the fabric looped around his neck. Again, it seems more real than just a fantasy, as Dean winds and unwinds the tie around his hands. He gets lost in the fantasy of what he and Cas could do with that tie and he feels himself growing hard at the mental images being conjured.
“Well you could start by getting them gifts this year.” Charlie pulls up amazon to show Cas how to order gifts online instead of going out in the holiday crowds.
“Yeah” Sam smiles and he’s about to tell his dad to tilt the screen again when he sees Dean reach forward and do it. Finally he can see their faces. His mother beams.
“Ok you got me, I had some of that cheese quiche that’s in the fridge and I didn’t take any lactase before so I’m a little gassy.” Dean tells him.
“Of course. Where do you live? Do you need anything?” Cas rattles off his address and dismisses Dean’s offer, stating that he just needs Dean. They end the call so Dean can drive without distraction and Cas makes his way back into the living room.
Bobby woke at the crack of dawn to a child shouting excitedly as his bedroom door was flung open and suddenly an energetic five year old was bouncing on his bed. The kid was lucky Bobby didn’t start shooting the second he burst through the door. Dean ran in after his brother and tried to pull him away from Bobby. He knew the dangers of waking a hunter in such a sudden way. Sam would not be deterred though.
“She doesn’t always agree with Charlie's shenanigans. She won’t stop them but she also won’t lie about them. I’ve learned that if I ask her she’ll tell me the truth.” Dean says and then pats his stomach with satisfaction.
“But they forgot these.” Donna says and she holds up the lube and cards. Sam groans and Charlie laughs. Then they debate if Cas knew what some of his gifts were implying or if he was completely clueless.
“Are we…” Dean pauses unsure of what question he’s trying to ask. “Was there something going on between us?”
“Yeah, but you didn’t look too happy with the name you got so who is it?” She sits on the edge of his desk and gives him a conspiratorial smile.
Dean knows he’s not being overly paranoid because he knows Sam and Carlie and some of the shit they’ve tried to pull in the past. He glares at them and wishes he could read lips so he could figure out what they were saying. Carlie points at something just off to Dean’s left and Sam looks up with a smirk. Dean turns to see what they’re looking at and catches sight of Sam’s friend Castiel. He’s met the guy a few times but hasn’t really gotten the chance to get to know him. He even though he was kinda cute, in a weird, socially awkward kinda way. But the guy didn’t seem to like Dean very much. He’d stop talking when Dean joined the conversation and he’d all but glare a hole through Dean’s head whenever they were in the same room.
“Or, Cas can just come here this year. If he wants to that is. I know you said he wanted a quiet christmas but it would just be the four of us so it wouldn’t be that bad.”
“Since when?”
“No, you said you liked card games when you were growing up and you like sex. I just thought you might find them useful.” He says it so innocently and Dean thinks he’s gonna have to have another talk with the angel about appropriate behaviour with friends.
“I was still sharing an apartment with my brother and it was quieter at Sam and Dean’s apartment with Sam gone most of the time.” Cas explained. Garth sympathized with how loud he knew Gabriel could be.
“Shit, sorry Sam.”
“Merry Christmas!” Dean cheers instead of answering his question. He sets the box in front of Cas and there is clearly something trying to get out.
Cas raisis an incredulous eyebrow. “Right”
The original plan was for the four of them to go out to dinner and leave the kid with a sitter. Cas thought Eileen would feel more comfortable doing a double date instead of going by herself to meet a man she doesn’t know. Sam reluctantly agreed, comforting himself with the knowledge that he would at least have his brother and brother in law as a buffer if he and Eileen didn’t hit it off.
“I love you too Cas” Dean smiles and kisses him some more, until a small energetic animal forces her way between them so she can get attention too.
“Alright, on one condition. No one mentions my love life or lack thereof. Deal?” Cas holds out his hand and Kali shakes it.
“Um, why is there a tree in the middle of the war room?” Jack asks. He’s squinting at the light and running his fingers through his sleep tousled hair. Sam wonders how the kid slept through all the arguing and general comotiong of putting the tree up.
“Well not if you put it like that.” She shoves his arm. “Invite him to dinner or something.”
“I don’t remember my mom, Dean was about Jack’s age so he has some memories of her but I was too little. We lost dad a few years ago.” She puts a hand on his shoulder and they sit in companionable silence for a moment.
They’re all startled by a loud peal of laughter and they turn to see Jessica doubled over, holding her stomach.
“Can’t that wait a few days?” Cas grumbles.
“What?” Dean’s face scrunches up in confusion.
“Come on I’ll explain in the car.”
“Sam it’s so good to see you.” Garth cheerily threw his arms around a tall man. Cas’ head jerked up at the familiar name and then swiveled around looking for the man’s brother, half hoping to see him and half hoping not to. The disappointment when he didn’t catch sight of green eyes and freckles was a lot deeper than he was willing to admit.
“Wait, how many people are coming to this thing?” Dean calls after him but Sam is out the door before he finishes his sentence.
They find themselves bundled up in comfy clothes, watching A Christmas Story and sipping hot chocolate twenty minutes later. Even Cas has dressed down for the occasion, in a pair of sweats and a shirt he borrowed from Dean. His grace isn’t as reliable as it used to be so he decided not to use it to dry his clothes and when Dean offered to throw them in with his laundry and then handed Cas something dry to wear he didn’t object.
“Should I change?” Cas tries not to look too embarrassed. He’d wanted to make a good impression the first time meeting Dean’s parents but Dean doesn't seem too concerned about it. Maybe he read the situation wrong. He was pretty sure that Dean told Sam about their relationship on the phone earlier. He’d stupidly assumed that that meant he was meeting the Winchesters as Dean’s boyfriend.
“I don’t know Charlie. It seems like we’re leaving too much to chance.”
“Mary leave the poor boy alone, he’s almost as red as a tomato.” John chides through a mouthful of steak. Mary just rolls her eyes and looks at Dean expectantly.
He hadn’t.
“I wasn’t ‘guilt tripping’ him. If I wanted to do that I would have reminded him that I told him to come out on the 21st instead of waiting until the 24th.” She argues. Sam can see his brother roll his eyes behind her back.
“Daddy can Dean come play with us this weekend?” Jack asks a few minutes later. Cas considers the request. He doubts an attractive guy like that, would  want to hang out with him and his kid on the weekend. They barely even know each other but for some reason Jack has connected to him. Jack is a friendly child and he is not shy at all but it’s weird for him to latch onto one person like this. Usually he’d be saying hello to everyone in the coffee shop but the second he sees Dean it’s like no one else exists.
Jack looks around in wonder as he and Sam walk into the brightly lit building. There’s a massive christmas tree in the center of everything and christmas music is playing cherrily through the speakers. Sam grabs the kid by his coat sleeve and directs him away from the major walkways. People rush past them in every direction carrying shopping bags and prodding distracted children to keep them moving. Much like Sam is doing to Jack.
“Alright, but you’ll call if you need anything?” Gabe hesitates at the door.
“That’s why I put it at the far end where there's not a lot of room, and I didn’t put any other snacks on that end so there’s no reason anyone would be near there until after I bring out the pie. And we’ve already established that those two will be first in line. As soon as I step back I’ll point out the mistletoe hanging over their heads and then we’ll use peer pressure to make them finally kiss.” She ends her monologue with a maniacal laugh and then catches sight of Castiel coming through the door.
“It just seems so fast. We’ve barely had any time to process.”
After Sam has been gone a reasonable amount of time and Dean’s sure he’s not going to come back for anything he might have forgotten, Dean wanders around their apartment. He looks through their  movies and sees a few titles he isn’t familiar with and a few titles of movies he remember seeing previews for but he doesn't remember them coming out. He makes a mental not to watch those and then moves on to snoop around the rest of the apartment.
The next Saturday rolls around soon enough and Sam and Eileen show up with their little one in tow, ready to go meet Santa. Mary bounces over to her cousins singing a garbled version of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and the babies giggle at her from where they’re strapped into their carseats.
“It’s not a puppy is it? I don’t think Miracle would like sharing the attention.” He tries to make a joke, in a failed attempt to shove the hope further down, but it sounds forced.
“I wasn’t trying to drag him out of the closet that wasn’t my intention and I’m fairly certain my parents already know. But you have to admit he’s been miserable lately and I saw Cas the other day getting coffee and the dude looked like hell.”
Bobby nodded at her suggestions and then caught sight of a little rocket ship. He remembered how excited Sam got about that cartoon with the alien in it. So he grabbed that and thanked the woman for her help. On his way to the check out he saw a display of candy and small toys labeled ‘Stocking stuffers’ and quickly grabbed a couple stockings and some candy to put in them. He remembered his mother setting out their stockings when he was a child. He briefly wondered if he should get a christmas tree too but decided against it.
Cas turns over in bed and reaches out for his boyfriend only to find cooling sheets. He groans and cracks an eye open. Sunlight is filtering in through the curtains and illuminating the empty space next to him. He gropes his nightstand for his phone to check the time. It’s just after seven; way too early to be awake. Cas sits quietly to see if he can hear Dean anywhere in the apartment. There's a light hum of voices coming from the living room but they’re too low for Cas to make out what they’re saying and he can’t tell if it’s Dean talking to someone or if it’s the tv. He strains his ears to hear and there's a shuffling sound followed by a small whine. Cas’ eyebrows scrunch together in confusion as he tries to place the sound then he hears the door open and close.
“Yeah, I know that. It’s just a saying kid. Just keep an eye on things around here will ya?” Dean grumbled and then he and Sam left.
“You’re the only one who thinks that. All of our friends constantly complain about how 'disgustingly domestic’ we are.” Dean says, quoting their friend Crowley.
“Is that your only concern?” Cas asks.
“No, you know what? Now that I think about it I think you’re right.” Benny looks like he just figured out a tough riddle as a wicked smile spreads across his face. “About two Fridays ago you were humming Begin Again while we were working on my truck.”
“Hey you should come over and have dinner with me and Gabe tonight.” She nudges his shoulder while they wait for the elevator.
“How are you feeling?” Dean asks. Cas grunts in response and sits up enough to prop his chin on Dean’s chest.
--------------
“Um, yeah he was listening to that record.” The boy tells him “Why is that important.”
Dean nearly has an aneurysm while he stares at the proffered cup. Sharing popcorn is one thing but a drink is a completely different thing altogether. It’s so . . . intimate in a way, like, Cas’ mouth has been on that straw and if Dean takes a drink then his mouth will be touching the same straw. And yeah, Dean thinks, some people share food and drinks with their friends but he never has. He can maybe justify it with a boyfriend or something but not with a friend. He wants to though. He really fucking wants to. So he takes it and sips it, he doesn’t even know what kind of soda it is, didn’t even think to ask.
“You don’t like my gifts?” Cas gives him an earnest look that is obviously fake.
I had no idea where I was going with this story and I stayed up way late writing it. sorry in advance if it's a little disjointed.
“You’re late, Sam will be here in an hour.” Cas admonishes him.
They spend the rest of Sam’s break getting acquainted and somehow Sam gets talked into inviting Jessica to dinner with Dean, Cas, Charlie, and Charlie’s girlfriend Dorothy. She doesn’t even hesitate when she accepts his invitation.
“Of course.”
“Oh, you did?”
“How did you get it all packed up so fast? It’s barely even nine” Sam asks.
An elf taps him on the shoulder, gaining his attention, and hands him a slip of paper with a number and the name Dean scrawled across it. There’s a small note at the bottom that reads ‘let me explain’ Cas looks up and catches his eye, giving him a short nod.
Dean walks over to the tv and switches it on and is pleased to find that A Charlie Brown Christmas is playing.
“Wonderful! Have you been here before?”
“We both did.” Cas yawns again and stands up, Dean follows his husband's example and gingerly extracts himself from the small bed.
“I don’t know if now’s the best time to say this, seein’s how we just got done fucking, but I love you more than I ever thought I could love another person.” Dean says shyly after breaking away from the kiss. Cas’ answering smile is blinding and then they’re kissing again. Hands grasping at exposed, damp, flesh while tongues explore and legs entwine. Things are starting to heat up and Dean’s sure he’ll be ready for another round soon.
“Your friends are always welcome. We’re having Meatball subs, will that be ok for him?”
“That was the idea.”
“Dad you turned off the video” Sam tries but still nothing. He closes his eyes and takes a steadying breath through his nose. His parents really aren’t that old; he doesn’t understand why they have such a hard time figuring out video calls.
“Oh, ok.” Dean blushed. Cas’ fingers twitched, wanting to brush against the heated skin across Dean’s cheekbones. He forced himself to turn away from the man and walk out into the living room to bid farewell to the others.
The rest of the holiday goes off without a hitch and when it’s time for Dean and Cas to go back home Sam gives them each an extra long hug. Eileen makes them promise to come back and visit when the baby is born.
“But what if he doesn’t want to be with me?” Cas cringes at how ‘high school melodrama’ that sounded.
“She would be furious.” Mr. Novak says and Dean knows he’s not talking about the maid. “She planned it so perfectly and I ruined it.” Tears start to slide down the old man’s cheeks and Dean awkwardly pats him on the shoulder.
“Is she alright? Do you need a ride to the hospital?”
“Memory loss Sammy.” He said in way of explanation, pointing at his head for emphasis. Sam turned the question to Cas. Shit shit shit. Cas mentally cursed himself.
“You sure? Cause she really won’t mind if you come over. Actually she’d probably insist on it.”
Dean feels ashamed with himself when he feels the familiar tingles and hardness in his pants. This is not the right time for this. He tries to tell his dick to ‘cool it’ but the tratorous thing won’t listen, and Cas isn’t helping things as he rubs his erection against Dean’s thigh.
“Oh I don't want to intrude on your evening.”
The party was just starting when they got there and Cas immediately went over to congratulate Garth. They chatted for a few moments and then Gabe suggested they give some of the other guests a chance to speak to the couple. Cas knew it was really Gabe’s way of saying let’s go find some food and from the cheeky grin Garth was throwing their way he figured he understood too.
Once Cas is fully caffeinated and everyone has finished their breakfast they head to the store to pick up Sam’s order and then they stop to grab all the unhealthy snacks Sam and Eileen don’t normally keep in the house. Dean insists on the snack if they’re going to do a movie marathon and Sam only argues a little bit before giving in.
“Hey guys, I gotta run and pick up Madison, her car’s been acting up. Why don’t you guys get the table set and well be back in a few.” He says as he grabs Dean’s car keys and rushes out of the kitchen.
“I think I may have found us a case” Sam is scrolling through his tablet when Dean enters the room with some sandwiches and beers. He sets them on the table in front of Sam and leans over his shoulder to look at the screen.
“So what do we know about this guy?” Dean asks as they drive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah.” Gabe nods and then a moment later “You ran into her?” Cas sighs and then nods..
Cas stands in front of Dean’s door with his finger hovering over the doorbell.
“Is it really bad there?” She asks him.
“Promise.” He gives his brother one last hug “See you tomorrow.” It’s barely even five minutes after his brother leaves that there's a knock at the door.
“If I tell you then you’ll be upset and we’ll have to live in two houses and we won’t have christmas together ever again and--and I hate Santa!” She sobs and buries her face in her arms. Her parents and little brother stare at her in shock.
“I have no idea, I would take a tissue sample and run a toxicology report on it but he’s still frozen. I’ll have to wait till he thaws.” Sam pulls on a glove and gently prods at the dead guy's hand. He pulls his hand back, startled at how cold it feels.
Eileen runs out of the house when she sees them pull up and Dean wraps her up in a big bear hug. After he lets her go she hugs Cas just as tightly. She’d missed them just as much as Sam had.
“Yeah, those are DVDs.” Sam rolls his eyes.
Sam thanks Charlie profusely for the blender and Jack swings around a realistic looking lightsaber. Jack piles 12 neatly wrapped packages in front of Dean. Each of them numbers 1-12 and Cas tells him he has to open them in order.
“Good. We had a christmas pageant last week before we set them all free for the holidays. My class sang Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer and we made antlers out of construction paper. It was a lot of fun.”
“Are you going to help me look for a hex bag? We’ll get done a lot faster with both of us looking.” Sam gripes while he swipes his hand across the bottom of the chair.
“We took Mary when she was about their age. She loved it.”
“Kelly wasn’t my wife, just a very good friend.” He explains but doesn’t go into more details.
“What?”
“I’ll see, it’s kinda late notice though.” Cas grimaces.
Later that day he’ll berate himself for just accepting a drink from a stranger like that. A drink for his kid no less. It really was stupid and recless but he’d been so flustered and taken off guard. He was just happy there hadn’t been anything harmful in the drink. At least, not that he knew of. Jack was fine, not ill or anything so it must have been fine. Cas groans and thumps his head against his desk. Kelly would have never let her child eat or drink anything offered to him by a stranger.
“Are you ok?” She asks with a barely concealed smirk.
When they get back to the bunker a few hours later Sam tries to sneak past the rest of his family but Dean catches sight of them and waves them into the war room. Eileen immediately complies even while Sam pretends he didn’t notice and tries to pull her down the hallway.
“I did have to get you this though. You deserve it, we all deserve it.” He adds cryptically and Dean’s mind immediately goes down a forbidden path. His heart speeds up and his traitorous thoughts bring up ideas of Jack bringing Cas back. He shuts those down as fast as he can. He knows if he lets himself hope it will only hurt more when he’s wrong.
“I could be persuaded to make an exception.” She gives Sam a flirty wink and he almost chokes on his drink.
“Come in, come in. Meet the newest member of our family.” The four men hover around her bed and Dean is the first one to reach down and gently stoke a tiny hand with his finger.
“Ok, yes, I was going to ask what I should get Dean.” Castiel decides to just be blunt about it. There’s no reason to hide it from her.
They do a few more laps around the rink and then Eileen announces that her fingers are freezing and she’s starting to get a cramp in her foot. And Sam can’t help but smile at her bluntness. The woman isn’t afraid of telling it like it is. He offers to buy her a hot chocolate at the cafe they passed earlier and she quickly accepts.
“Come on Cas lets get you set up in the guest room.” He’s glad to finally have a moment alone to ask Cas what’s wrong.
The third time they see the man Cas turns away from Jack to place his order at the counter when the child takes off toward the door. Cas isn’t fast enough to get a hold of his hand but when he turns to follow he sees Jack skid to a stop in front of the drink swapping art connoisseur. The barista clears her throat and he quickly finishes his order, keeping an eye on his kid. Jack is bouncing around the man while he waits in line and instead of looking annoyed he’s chatting animatedly with the kid.
Cas and Dean just shrug and when Sam takes a moment to actually think about it a lot of things start to make more sense. The shared suitcase, the coffee cup, Dean going to watch Cas’ students perform.
“Yeah, uh, she’s nice?” Dean says and it sounds more like a question than an actual statement.
Gabe: Nope
They sat in Dean’s car and ate the whole pie by themselves and they didn’t feel guilty about it either. Dean knew Charlie had been up to something and it didn’t take him very long to piece it together once he saw the trap for what it truly was. He knows if Benny hadn’t interfered he would have been the one stuck under the mistletoe with Castiel. When he explained to Castiel the other man didn’t believe him. He thought it was too far fetched but Dean had texted Dorothy and asked her point blank if that mistletoe was put there to trick him into kissing Castiel she said yes.
“Oh that poor boy.” Mary gasps and then tears start to build in her eyes. “Why didn’t Dean tell me? I could have… I … We just prattled on about stupid things and the whole time he was dealing with that. He probably thinks we’re all insensitive and rude.”
“Nobody does.” Gabe pats his brother’s shoulder “But it is what it is.” and with that he leaves Cas alone to wallow in his misery.
“It’s like you have a sixth sense for food.” Sam teases him goodnaturedly.
“You’re not Santa.” She tells them in a very matter of fact voice. Sam whips around at the small voice and freezes. At least she didn’t scream, Dean thinks.
He’d heard a lot of things about Castiel Novak when they’d hired him the year before. Supposedly he was some genius in the advertising world who had multiple degrees in psychology and cinematography and who knows what else. All those fancy degrees made him the hot commodity among advertising agencies because, not only was he creative but he could come up with visually stunning ads and commercials that targeted specific demographics.
“It’s just dinner Cas. I can see them later.”
“Welcome to the family Dean-o” Gabe grins and then starts rummaging through the fridge. “What’s the plan for dinner?” He asks.
“Dean I’m putting you on speaker, Sam’s here.”
“Yes.” Jack nods but Dean gives him a suspicious look.
-----------------
“I loved you Cas!” Dean blurts out, he’s not sure why he said it but he knows it’s true. “I may not remember loving you but I know I did. Hell, I still do, I can feel it deep in my bones. It’s the one thing I’m sure of in this crazy, jumbled, mess of a life.”
“Thanks Cas” he says as he admires his new boots. Then someone else tells him he has to model them for everyone so he hops up and struts around the room, striking poses sporadically. He plops down in his chair a moment later and catches the way Cas is looking at him before he looks away.
The message from Cas was short and Dean felt the stupid grin stretch across his face.
“Oh uh…” Cas doesn’t know what to say to that. Maybe Dean didn’t want him to come over.
“Mom?” Dean says before she can hang up.
“Dean the Santa has probably dealt with lots of boneless children. It’s actually a pretty common malady in young children” Cas quips and Dean gives him an unamused look.
“So what are we going to do about his new wish?”
“Great!” He says a little too fast then: “I’ll give you a call sometime.” he tries to say a little more calmly.
Cas holds up a dark blue tie with little yellow bumble bees on it. Everyone else looks a little disappointed when they see it and Charlie even gives Dean a ‘you seriously got him a tie?’ look but Dean just mouths ‘later’ at her so she knows he’ll explain when they’re not surrounded by coworkers.
“I can’t tell you what to get him. That’s cheating” She tells him with a mock serious face.
“Wow Sam tell me how you really feel?” Dean is angry now.
The had tentative plans to go out again the following Tuesday and Dean found himself dreading and excitedly anticipating the date. On one hand it would get his mom off his back about finally settling down, and give him a distraction from his, not so chaste, thoughts about a certain blue eyed man. But on the other hand he knew that it wouldn’t really change how he felt about Cassy. He still didn’t want anything more than friendship with her and he hated using her as a cover. It wasn’t fair to either of them. Still, he called his mom and told her all about the lovely girl he’d gone out with, knowing it would make her happy.
“I’m sorry Dean. Earlier they asked me all these questions about how we met and if we had any special plans for while we were here and then Sam asked how long we’d been dating and that was when you came in the room and I didn’t get a chance to warn you. I’m so sorry.” Cas babbles.
“You have?” Cas asks shocked.
“Tammy? The cashier at the Safeway?”
“Oh did he?” Sam asks with raised eyebrows.
Dean tries to hang back to ask Cas what’s wrong but his little brother excitedly starts telling him about a prank war he’d had with his friends the day before. Dean gives Cas a ‘what can you do?’ look and follows Sam into the kitchen.
“I forgot.” Dean shakes his head and scoops the boy up into his arms and tickles him.
“It could be connected to an object, that could explain how it’s moving around.” Dean points out. “Dude why is the tree lit up in an empty house?” He pokes at one of the ornaments hanging on the branches.
Cas stands rooted on the spot, staring at Santa. He’s finally matched the voice with a face. He’s not sure if he should be creeped out with the whole situation or if he should wait until he’s spoken to the man before he decides how he feels about it.
“I’m not leaving you Cas. So either I tell my parents I’m not coming and I stay here or we both go and have dinner with them.”
“Yeah dude, it’s not every day you get to work with a marketing genius.” Dean chuckles.
“Trust me Sam. I put the mistletoe just above the snack table and as soon as I bring out my famous Raspberry crumble pie those two will be the first ones there. The plan is foolproof.”
“Then where did Cas sleep?” Sam didn’t think his brother would be rude enough to force his friend to sleep on the couch but maybe he was wrong.
“Thanks” Cas says but the man just shrugs it off with a bright smile.
“Would you?”
He walks into the kitchen and sees Dean crouched behind the island muttering to himself.
“Santa?” Jack asks.
“Dude everyone else told me who they had, it wasn’t hard to figure out what name you drew.” Charlie says as she pours herself a cup of coffee.
“I’ll see you guys next weekend” Sam waved back and then disappeared out the door.
“Yeah, sorry by the way, about your wife.” Dean says and Cas gives a sad little laugh.
“Look Cas, it's a dragon!” Jack shouts and points at a large dragon to the left, the radio plays music and sound effects as the lights flicker and change to make it look like the dragon is moving and then suddenly fire shoots out if it’s mouth.
“Ok, yeah. I like that.”
Bobby searched through the camping and fishing section of the store and found a pretty decent tactical knife and a whetstone. He was pleased with himself. Dean would like it now he just needed to get something for the little one.
“Talk to him?” Gabe offers. Cas scoffs.
John had dropped off his boys three days ago while he tracked down a werewolf. They’d been having fun playing in the snow and watching cartoons but their dad still hadn’t returned and it was Christmas eve. Little Sammy asked Bobby if Santa would be able to find them this year. Dean stepped in when Bobby didn’t seem to have an answer and told Sammy that Santa would try to find them but sometimes it was hard when they moved around so much. Bobby felt bad for the kid who, by all rights, should still believe in Santa himself. But here he was knowing Santa wasn’t real and doing his best to not spoil it for his brother.
Castiel’s day had been long and exhausting, but at least his shift was almost over. He was just about 6 months into his residency at the Boston Medical Center and life as an intern sucked. The workload and hours were kicking his ass and the chief resident, Anna, pushed her interns harder than the other residents at the hospital. But Cas knew that he was paying his dues now and that Anna’s methods were there to make them better doctors.
“Yeah, that has to explain it, I haven’t gotten laid in a while, i just saw Cas, who was always fucking fantastic in bed, and my brain just put two and two together,” Dean said out loud, needing to hear the words to believe the lie, “Shit, ~Castiel~ not Cas”.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, well, I didn’t. Still living in the same place… Do you remember how to get there or  do you need directions?” Dean replied, feeling the tension build in the car between the two of them. “I can always call Jo to come get me, she’s coming over later anyways and  I’m sure  she could get off work early-”.
He was feeling so much that he wanted to cry to express it. This was a man that, despite the hell he had been through, loved more deeply than another he had ever met. Everything he did was drenched in love for those close to him. This was a man that had secretly applied to jobs in Boston after Cas had been accepted to his dream medical school only to plan an elaborate evening to surprise Cas with his job offer at a local school. Dean wanted to move halfway across the country with him.
“...on thanksgiving…” Dean said in a voice barely above a whisper, dropping his eyes away from Charlie.
Dean sat in stunned silence. All of the thoughts that ran through his mind earlier were wrong, he hadn’t expected Cas to apologize to him. Dean resigned himself to a life of partial happiness as long as it meant never losing a partner. He fell under the assumption that he wasn’t worth anything and didn’t deserve better than this lot of life. And here was Cas bursting at the seams to make this up to him. He sat there, with Cas to his side, quickly trying to piece together a reaction.
Possibilities and questions swirled around his mind, he needed to figure this out. Hopefully Cas would be free when he got home, but how would he bring this up?
“Whatever you say, man,” Dean said, laughing to himself as he lowered himself down into Cas’s car.
“Of course, Dean” Cas responded, his voice gravelly, dripping with lust.
“Dean,” Castiel squeaked out, his voice cracking and watery, “that was beautiful, I don’t know what to say.”
Gabe left Castiel’s key on the counter, locked the door from the inside, and left.
The man was distracted enough by Dean that his grip on the boy loosened and he was able to slip away and run back to his mom. The man panicked a little as he realized that his only leverage was gone. His eyes darting from side to side trying to come up with his next move.
“You want me to go to a party with you tonight?” Cas asked, pointing at his own chest.  “Have we met? I don’t really go to parties, mainly because I’m not asked but still.” He shook his head and turned back to the papers sitting in front of him.
“Eh, it's alright I guess, it means that I don't have an excuse to miss family meals on Sundays. But enough about that, you said your name is Castiel? Like the angel?”
“And you know, he was right, Jo. I couldn’t even make it up the steps to the front door without getting so dizzy that I almost fell back down them. And there is no way I would have made it up those stairs” - he gestured over his shoulder towards the front door- “anytime today without his help. He essentially carried me up them and made sure that I got back in here safely.”
“Ok, Dean where to?” Cas asked, turning away from Dean to grab his seat belt.
Dean sat silent for a moment, letting his words fill the room. He watched Sammy for a minute as his expression changed, he watched his brother’s shoulders lower as the tension left them, his jaw slackened, and he sank back into the couch cushion.
Perfect, I will be seeing you tomorrow then, did you want to pick the place since I picked the day?
“Ah bu-”
Castiel knew that today was important, that he needed to think about what he was going to say. They were meeting to catch up but he couldn't just walk in there and “Hi, how have I been? Oh you know, just feeling like a piece of me has been missing until I saw you bleeding in my emergency room a couple weeks ago and now that you’re here I feel whole again.”
“Don’t drop me,” Cas whispers against Dean’s lips before going back to kissing him.
“Gabriel?” Castiel called from the living room, “Are you here already? I wasn’t expecting you for another 10 or 15 minutes.”
Cas gasped at this confession and Dean pulled his hands back out of Cas’s grip. He fumbled for the warmth of Dean’s hands, he searched for the grounding weight that was this man’s hands in his own. He looked up at Dean and saw acceptance painted on his face.
Perfect, I’ll see you then. I’ll be the one on the crutches :P
“Dean?”
“One hour Mister! 11:30.” - she tapped her wrist and raised her eyebrows at him - “then you gotta get outta here and patch things up with Dr. Sexy In-Training!” She smirked and quietly left the room, closing the door behind her.
Gabriel sat on the bed next to his brother, holding his bouncing son in his lap. Tucker turned towards Castiel and held his chubby arms out towards his uncle. Castiel seemed to wake up from his disconnection and flashed a bright, albeit fake smile at his young nephew.
“Oh my god, of course, Dean. I didn’t mind it at all, I did feel more inclined to actually pay attention yesterday since I knew we were going to be talking about it. And anyone who is willing to buy me a honey latte as payment is all squared up in my book.” Cas said, picking his drink up to take a sip. An involuntary moan escaped him as the sweet rush of caffeine entered his system.
“That has to be somewhat nice, not being that far from home?”
“Well, welcome welcome, Meg is in the living room watching TV so we can hang out in my room?” Charlie nodded her head towards the room off to their side.
“Nothing, Cas, everything’s peachy, can’t you tell?” Dean replied, his eyes rolling before moving to throw the empty can in the recycling bin.
The image in front of him blurred and fell out of focus, he could still smell the burning rubber and sweet fragrance of coolant from the other car. He could barely make out his mom’s face, her blonde curls. The rest of this memory was fading, slowly being replaced with something else.
Before Dean could protest any further Castiel had produced a wheelchair seemingly out of nowhere and had whisked him out of the room and down the hall to get a cast.
“Yeah, Dean, what’s up?” Castiel asked, relieved at the turn around in the man’s demeanor.
“Oh, ok. I’m not sure what I thought I heard but I guess it's cool that y’all met up. It’s been a while.” Sam replied, his tone even and unaffected. Dean breathed a sigh of relief, if Sam had caught his slipup, at least he didn’t draw attention to it.
“I can’t believe I didn’t know it was this bad, Cas,” Sam said, dropping his head into his hands. Cas stopped in his tracks and took in a sharp inhale, Sam had called him Cas again.
Happiness is in the being.
“You know my boss?” Castiel asked Sam, his eyes squinting and his head tilted to the side.
Castiel walked over to his dresser and opened the bottom drawer. In the very back, hidden behind wool socks and hats stored away for winter, was one t-shirt, one pair of sweatpants, and one small, black box stuffed in the pocket of the sweatpants.
As he stepped out of the shower, Dean remembered Castiel’s request for coffee. Well, this seems as good a time as any, Dean thought drying himself off. He grabbed the towel off the hook on the back of the door and quickly wrapped himself up to shield Sam’s sensitive eyes as he crutched back to his bedroom. Dean collapsed onto his bed, grabbing his phone.
Cas looked up at Dean with a puzzled expression, his eyebrow raised and the blue’s of his eyes sparkling in the candlelight. He took Dean’s hand and allowed himself to be pulled into a tight embrace. Dean took one of Cas’s hands and wrapped it around his waist. He took Cas’s other hand into his own, wrapping his free hand around Cas’s waist, and pulled him in close. Dean swayed them along with the beat of the music and the gentle lull of Smith’s voice. He placed a tender kiss on Cas’s forehead.
“What?” Castiel lifted his head, swallowing hard.
“Beans? What beans?” Dean said, glancing around the room, firmly keeping his gaze on anything besides Charlie.
“Do you not think you’re worth saving?” Cas stepped towards Dean and grabbed his face between his hands.
Dean opened his mouth to respond, his eyebrows raised so much they nearly disappeared into his hair and his heart rate increased, but Cas lifted a hand to stop him.
“Well, I for one, think that teaching history is exactly what you should do. It might sound boring to someone but if it makes you happy and excited and you’re passionate about it, then fuck them!” Cas said, flipping his hand to brush off the haters, “Fuck anyone who makes you feel bad about what you love. And? Let me share a secret with you.” - Cas leaned in over the table- “teachers are fucking hot.”
“Castiel, you either take this shit elsewhere or you get the hell back to work, we have patients to see and no one wants to hear you air your personal drama in the hallways,” Anna said, not taking her eyes off Castiel.
THANK YOU for bearing with me here. I'm so sorry for not posting more frequently but life is weird and obstacles keep popping up. I have every intention of finishing this fic, it is not abandoned, it is not orphaned. Thank you to each and every one of you for your comments and kudos, more chapters are coming even if it takes me a while to get them to you <3 <3
Cas then grabbed the bottom of Dean’s shirt, lifting it off over his head and tossed it on the floor next to their bed. He ran his hands over Dean’s chest, taking in the landscape of muscles and scars, his fingers lightly lingering over Dean’s waist as he tilted his head up to continue kissing Dean.
“Like THE Dean Winchester? Shit, how is he doing?” Gabe asked.
She told me that she hoped that you would feel the same way about her someday, that she was never that close with her own folks and that she would love to be an “Official Winchester”. Her words, Sammy. An Official Winchester. A member of the family.”
“CAS!” Dean said, cutting Cas off and grasping Cas’s hands in his own. “It’s ok, I just had a small breakdown over wanting to be a history teacher so I think we’re a little more than strangers at this point. I don’t mind you asking.” A small smile formed on Dean’s face, putting Cas at ease.
“Uh yeah man you sounded not great on the phone so I rushed over here,” Gabriel yelled back as he rounded the corner into the living room, chucking his coat over the back of the nearest chair.
Castiel blinked rapidly, his mouth suddenly dry. This mystery voice knew his name, but he easily could have gotten that from the caller id. His breath hitched as he realized that this stranger pronounced his name correctly. His head was spinning, desperately trying to piece together who could have been on the other side of this call. What man would have Dean gone to?
“I’m sorry,” -Castiel reached out to lay a hand on Dean’s arm- “I didn’t mean to overstep-” He looked down at his hand resting on Dean, shock resonated through him. He couldn’t believe that he was touching him, why had he thought this was a good plan? He is in the middle of apologizing for overstepping and this is what he does?
No, this called for some finesse. He thought back to the day that Dean invited him to that halloween party, when he was going to lay out his feelings in that coffee shop on campus. As he remembered sitting in that booth across from Dean, he admired the fearlessness of his younger self. He scoffed as he realized that college-freshman Castiel was really going to blurt out that he was madly, deeply in love with his best friend and that he could not hold it in any longer. What he wouldn't give for some of that bravery now.
Before Castiel had a chance to start a full argument with his fellow interns about substance addiction in Boston, he heard his name being called across the ER.
“You know where I live,” Dean quips.
“Well,” -Gabe readjusted in his seat, he sat up straighter and folded his hands in his lap- “I can’t talk about what Dean went through, but you, Cas?” -Gabe noted the flicker in Castiel’s eyes as he recognized the nickname- “You could not have stayed in the situation that you were in.
“Cas asked me to come home tonight and I think I’m almost ready to go back. I’m just really tired and I was wondering if I could take a quick nap here? Like an hour? Would you wake me up and make sure I get on my way home tonight?” Dean asked, squeaking out his request, weary of her answer.
Cause if we don’t leave this town, we might never make it out -
Castiel’s train of thought was derailed as soon as Garth pulled the gurney out of the back and the heart-achingly familiar face of Dean Winchester came into full view.
“Why do you not think that teaching is impressive? Or important?” Cas asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
Dean remained silent, his anxiety growing into anger, burning in his stomach. He clenched his jaw, his brain twisting itself into knots as he tried to figure out how to respond to Cas. Dean squeezed Cas’s hand once more before pulling out of his grasp. He pulled his knees into his chest and wrapped his arms around them, gripping his forearms tightly.
we meet a new pal!
Dean maintains eye contact with this guy and slowly raises his hands to show him that there was nothing in them. He sidesteps across the sidewalk until he’s between the man and the woman.
“Dean Ross Winchester! Look at me.” Cas said in his “Angel of the Lord” voice, as Dean liked to call it. Dean stopped pacing and looked at Cas
“Well honeybee,” Dean said, wrapping his left arm around Cas’s waist, pulling him closer. “We made it. Here we are! We’re in Boston! Beantown!”
Dean paused on the sidewalk, watching this event unfold trying to decide what his best course of action was. After only a few moments of deliberation, Dean resolved to confront the man. As Dean approached the man, Dean quickly realized that there was something off about him; his eyes wouldn’t quite focus on any one thing, he was switching from picking at his right forearm with his free hand and all of his actions seemed to be very erratic. He was acting like a junkie coming down and in need of another hit.
Dean sniffled and rubbed away the tears that were forming in his eyes again. He looked up at the clock on Charlie’s nightstand.10:24 pm. Charlie let him in around 8 and he sat on her bed trying to work out whether two and a half hours had been enough time to work himself up to facing Cas again.
“Dean, look at me” - Charlie took Dean’s chin in her hand and tilted his head so that his eyes met hers. - “if this is what you think is best for you tonight, then of course. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.”
“DUDE!” -Dean reached across the table and smacked Castiel once on the shoulder- “That’s not ‘near’ the top of your class, that is the top of your class! Congratulations!”
Dean, out of breath, looked over at Charlie with tears in his eyes and found that she didn’t look surprised in the slightest. He furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to ask-
Cas closed the space between them and slid Dean’s jacket off of him. He turned and rested the coat on the back of the armchair. He took Dean’s hands into his own and pressed a light kiss to the backs of both hands.
“I know, baby, I’ll try to work on it.”
It was November in Boston and Dean was able to spend his Thanksgiving in his favorite coffee shop without the usual hustle and bustle. His pea coat, hat, and scarf hung up on the coat rack by the door, Dean was enjoying his cayenne pepper cappuccino by the small electric fireplace in the center of the shop. He looked up from his laptop to see Meg and Jo on either side of the counter playing a game of paper football. The shop was slow but Dean was glad that Meg decided to open her shop at all that day. Usually she accompanied her boyfriend, Alfie, home for all holidays but the two were in the middle of a fight and they decided that they should take a break this holiday and cool off. Jo was still in town because she knew that Dean didn’t have any plans and wanted to make sure that someone was with him for Thanksgiving. Dean appreciated that his friends were still concerned about him, and he knew that they meant well, but he was quickly growing tired of the constant streams of babysitters that were in his life. Regardless, Dean was thankful that Jo didn’t travel back to Lawrence this year. While he was doing better, he agreed that he was nervous at the prospect of spending a major holiday by himself.
Dean’s voice cracked on the last word and he looked down at the ground as his resolve broke and tears began streaming down his face. Charlie’s smile disappeared as she realized that Dean was crying on her doorstep. She quickly pulled back from the window, grabbed a blanket off her bed, and raced down the stairs. The entire way down, she tried to piece together what could have happened. Did something bad happen to Cas? Or to Sam?
Dean sank further into the sofa, wanting nothing more than for this moment to end. Neither man knew what to say to each other, leaving the apartment in thick anticipation. After several, long minutes, Dean cleared his throat.
“Ah Sam, “ -Castiel looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath, he looked back at Sam and leaned forward so his elbows rested on his knees, “I hear you. But I don’t-”
“Dean” Cas said, stepping out of Dean’s harsh grasp, “I just mean that this is too much to ask of a teacher, this shouldn’t be part of your job description. I think you need to report this to someone.”
"Yes. I remember."
"Yes, I understand that. My body can no longer process that much-"
Castiel gave Dean another blank look, not following. His eyes narrowed skeptically.
Castiel let his head fall forward, looking down at the floor, his chin tucked to his collarbone in defeat. He gave his head a little shake.
"I hate being human." Castiel hissed in frustration. It took Dean aback; he was used to his unflappable angel friend, Castiel. Who stood perfectly straight and always wore a suit and tie. Who flitted around of his own accord on invisible wings and played everything real close to the vest.
"Dean…"
"Okay…" Dean said, stepping over to stiffly sit down next to his friend. "Can you, uh…Tell me where it hurts?" Christ. He felt like he was a pediatrician or something trying to tease out a diagnosis from a five-year-old. He kept that thought to himself.
"This…This is candy." Castiel concluded.
Dean's ears strained out into the dark, listening for the intruder. His head snapped over at the sound of a timid knock on his door, followed by a muffled, gruff voice. "Dean."
"Yes, Dean. Thank you." Dean could tell by Castiel's face that he still had more on his mind. He lifted a hand and gave his shoulder a gentle pat.
Over and over, at Dean's and Sam's urging for Cas to get a good night's sleep, Cas had angsted to them that he thought it was a waste of time. That he was used to millions of years straight of having a boundless source of energy. That laying down and not moving for eight hours a night seemed like a complete waste of his life. Inevitably, of course, Castiel would crash, either sitting down at the table or the couch, and sometimes, blessedly, actually in his room and in his bed. His schedule now seemed to be that he'd force himself awake for a day or two, and then crash like that for seventeen or so hours, before repeating the cycle.
Dean blinked, moving to one side to allow Cas to step into his room. Castiel shuffled over to the bed, sitting down on the edge gingerly. "Uh…What do you mean 'something is wrong with you'?" Dean asked, one eyebrow quirked nearly to his hairline with confusion.
"Cool it, it's medicine. For upset stomachs. Come on, there's a bottle in the kitchen." Dean said, already departing from his room.
Dean smiled as he heard Cas shuffling along behind him, standing quietly as he rifled through the kitchen cabinets for the bubblegum pink bottle. He leaned on the counter patiently as Castiel inspected it.
"…Is that why I feel this way?" Castiel murmured softly. "When I was an angel- that would have been nothing…I thought I could-"
Christ. "Okay- Remember a couple years ago, when Famine was out and about making everyone in town crave their deepest desires?" Dean prompted.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. "I can talk to Sam about preventing this in the future tomorrow, but my stomach is uncomfortable right now…" he tried to explain.
Dean cracked his door open, squinting out at Cas in the lowlight of the bunker's hallways at night. "Cas?" he grunted. "What's up? It's like…fuckin' three AM. You should be asleep."
A silence settled over them then, standing alone in the bunker's kitchen, lit only by the orange light above the stove. Dean was the first to break the quiet. "Ya think you wanna head back to bed? If you're still hurting in an hour you can come back here and get another dose."
Dean shook his head, taking the bottle and flipping it around to show Cas the ingredients. "Just medicine. I bet you could drink the whole thing and be fine, honestly. Humans use this stuff all the time. We give it to kids, give it to dogs."
Dean chuckled. "'s not magic, Cas. It takes like, I don't know. An hour to set in?" He grinned fondly when Castiel rolled his head back on his shoulders in frustration. His grin died on his lips at Castiel's next statement, however.
"That's the rub, ain't it?" Dean commented after a few moments of stunned silence. "None of us asked for this. We're all just out here trying to make the best of it."
"I see…" Castiel didn't sound completely convinced, but he let Dean pour him a capful of the pink sludge. He gave it a cautious sniff and wrinkled his nose. "The bottle said it would taste like bubblegum," he huffed accusingly. "This smells like chalk."
"I'm not the best to talk to about this, but I could ask Sammy to give you the portion control speech in the morning. Does that sound good?" Dean offered gently, his face open and sympathetic. He could barely imagine experiencing a stomachache for the first time at, what, four hundred million years old?
"Gimme a minute. And you ate cheeseburgers into the hundreds?"
This was part of why Dean was surprised. Cas had eaten quite rapturously at dinner that night, so Dean figured he would have no trouble falling asleep with a nice, full, warm tummy. Of all the things that Castiel struggled with now that he was human, food was thankfully not one of them. He was timid with new tastes, as was to be expected, but he had no trouble at all with eating when he found things he liked. It was likely the only part of being human that he enjoyed.
Ever since Cas had become human, finding a regular sleeping schedule had been difficult for him. It wasn't uncommon for either Dean or Sam to shuffle out to the kitchen for water or a snack deep in the middle of the night to just find Cas sitting at the table, looking at his hands, eyebrows knitted with thought.
Dean caught Cas before he began to spiral again. "Hey- Look here, buddy, listen to me," he urged, nodding encouragingly when Cas looked up from his slouch, his eyes open, deer-like. Lost.
…Uh. You're damn right there is. In any other situation, Dean would have laughed at the absurdity of Castiel waking him this deep in the night to quite bluntly talk about his issues, but he saved it. He could see that Cas was in pain.
"I think you're still the best angel out there. And you're far and away the best one I know."
What could Cas be wanting at nearly three in the morning? Dean gave a low groan. "Coming…" The timid knocking ceased, and Dean rubbed his eyes and tugged on a pair of pants before answering the door, not wanting to greet his buddy Cas in his underwear.
Oh. Dean realized all at once that Castiel didn't have a hankering for an explanation of why his stomach hurt. He had come to Dean for help. Dean bit his lip and quashed the warm fuzzy feeling blossoming in his chest back into the little box where he kept all his squishy, tender emotions. When had the latch on that old thing come loose?
Dean looked over in surprise. "I could ask you the same question." he murmured. "How could you deal with always having someone over your shoulder telling you what to do?"
"…How do you do it?" Castiel whispered. "My- My entire life I've had an express purpose. I've had someone to tell me what to do, where to go. How do you deal with this freedom?"
With that, Castiel threw back the little capful of medicine like a shot, just like Ellen and Jo had taught him. Dean grinned fondly, taking the cap back to wash it in the sink as Castiel wrinkled his nose. "That is unpleasant." he grunted, licking his lips to get the taste out of his mouth. He mumbled his thanks when Dean brought him a glass of water, leaning against the counter as he slowly sipped at it.
Castiel paused to think before lifting a hand and placing it on his middle, right where his belly was the softest. "Here is the worst- but it is…Radiating up through my chest and into my throat. It stops at my tongue." he murmured, his voice tight with restraint.
Now, his human friend, Cas, stood in his kitchen in a ratty old t-shirt and pajama pants, barefoot, his face twisted with brand new sensations of discomfort. Cas opened his eyes, staring past the ceiling beseechingly.
"Y'know," Dean continued. "Not for nothin', but I think you've been doing a damn good job at this 'free will' thing." He ignored momentarily how Castiel looked up at him in surprise. "Who else could say that they practically invented freedom for their whole species? I think you've got plenty to be proud of, Cas."
"My stomach is still upset…" Cas murmured as he set the glass down.
"I don't see what that has to do with-"
"You can't do shit like that anymore."
"I'm not an angel anymore, Dean."
But now Castiel stood before Dean, looking a touch pale. His usual ram-rod straight posture was a little more hunched than normal, his eyes were crinkled up at the edges with discomfort, and his mouth was pulled into a slight grimace. "Dean, something is wrong with me."
"Yes, Dean. Thank you." Castiel whispered, staying still for another few heartbeats before pushing off the counter, shuffling off down the hall on quiet feet.
“No problem, Dean,” Cas whispered back, letting his eyes linger in contact with Dean’s until Dean broke it. Dean shifted uncomfortably in his seat and before he knew it, the words were leaving Cas’s mouth.
“Dean? Did you hear me?” Castiel asked, placing a hand lightly on Dean’s shoulder.
“How did it get this bad? How did none of us see it? I can’t believe no one was there for Dean while he was going through this,” Sam asked. He picked his head up and looked at Cas, disbelief evident on his face.
“There’s still time, Captain. Hell, there will always be time to do so. You just have to try.” Dean told the Captain, nodding at him with a sorrowful smile.
“Sew! A needle pulling thread!” The children sang together, Dean joining in as well. “La, a note to follow sew. Tea, a drink with jam and bread.” He smiled at them and stopped playing on the guitar, listening to the kids.
Krissy looked surprised and smiled happily up at the boy. “Me? Why?”
Sister Kelly smiled as she looked at Mother Abaddon. “Oh, how do you solve a problem like Dean?”
“Mr. Winchester, I don’t know how much the sisters have told you....” The Captain said back at him. Dean shrugged; they didn’t really say much to him. Just that a sea captain needed a governess for his seven children until September.  “You are the twelfth in a long line of governesses who have come to look after my children since their mother died.” He explained as he looked around the house, walking around Dean. “I trust that you will be an improvement on the last one, she stayed only two hours.”
“What?” Krissy asked excitedly.
“Me!” Kurt at up.
Dean thought for a moment and looked down at his lap for a moment before he looked back up at her. “No, Mother, but I-I pray and I try and I am learning! I really am!” He said with a small smile. He really did like it at the abbey but he always wondered if he’d like it somewhere else.
“Dean?” The Reverend mother asked, pursing her lips. That man was too much for a bunch of nuns too handle, even if some did like him.
Abaddon chuckled a little and smiled at Dean, “The Lord will show you in his own good time.” Dean’s eyes widened as he looked at the Mother, sighing. He’d never get an answer, at least, not from her.
“That will bring us back to-”
Gabe took a breath as he looked at Mick. “You and Castiel are like family to me.” Although, Cas was his actual brother. “That’s why I want to see you two get married. We must keep all that lovely money in the family.” He teased, Mick giggling softly.
Claire nodded, “We don’t even know how to sing.” That… might influence my idea about singing now. But Dean was determined to persevere.
Krissy listened to him intently. “Timid and shy and scared are you, of things beyond your ken.” He sang as she leaned into him a little. “You need someone older and wiser telling you what to do.” Of course, Rolfe thought he was the best candidate to do so. “I am seventeen, going on eighteen. I’ll take care of you.” He promised to her.
Dean walked through the outside corridors. “What will this day be like, I wonder.” He sang timidly as he opened the gate to the abbey, pursing his lips. “What will my future be, I wonder.” He leaned against the gates as he looked to the sky. The Lord will help me see what I need, won’t he?
“My heart heart wants to sing every song it hears.” Dean sighed and looked around still before he walked to some slim trees, smiling as he walked slowly through them, admiring them with his eyes too. “My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise from the lake to the trees. My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies from a church on a breeze.” Dean leaned against a tree for a moment, looking up at the birds that lay on the branches.
Krissy tilted her head, something she definitely got from her father. When she was much younger and he was much happier. “Why not?” She asked innocently.
April smirked and looked at Abaddon, “Exactly what I say.” Except, not too keen on the actually liking Dean yet. “He climbs a tree and scrapes his knee; his trousers have got a tear.” She sang to the mother.
“Me and Kristen were trying to get to know each other better tonight, Captain.” Dean said, winking at Kristen before he looked at the Captain. Krissy nodded as Dean continued, “Although, I believe it’s much too late to go into all that. You heard your father, children, go to bed.”
Abaddon shook her head and sighed, “How do you solve a problem like Dean? How do you catch a cloud and pin it down.” She looked at the abbey walls.
Brigitta tilted her head, “Why not? Don’t you think it’s ugly?”
“And the little ones just want to be loved. Please, Captain, love them, love them all.” Dean said desperately, tearing up a little. Damn, did this remind him of his old home…. Castiel looked surprised at Dean. He hasn’t seen another man tear up like him before. “I am not finished yet, Captain.” Dean told him anyways.
“I am sixteen, going on seventeen.” Krissy nudged Rolfe with a smile. “I know that I’m naive.” She admitted, shrugging with a small chuckle before she took Rolfe’s hand. “Fellows I meet may tell me I’m sweet and willingly I believe.” Rolfe smiled at that and chuckled too.
“Do Re Mi.” The children repeated.
“Now, when I want you, this is what you’ll hear.” The Captain started to blow on the whistle again to demonstrate.
Castiel pursed his lips before he said to his children, “Don’t go away.” He walked to follow Dean. “Winchester. I… behaved badly.” He felt suddenly nervous as he talked to him. “I apologize.”
Dean ushered the kids around the city, pointing at certain sites. They would never get old; they were so beautiful. He quickly made his way to the market and grabbed some tomatoes; he’d buy them later but he wanted to show the kids something.
The children looked a bit disappointed with his reaction, but with the amount of times Dean was in the forest, he knew how to handle and not be afraid of frogs. “You’re very lucky, with Fraulein Helga, it was a snake.” Frau said. Now those, Dean was very afraid of those.
Krissy said, nodding, “I was out taking a walk, and somebody locked the doors earlier than usual and I didn’t want to wake everybody up. So when I saw your window open--” She paused and watched Dean for a moment, sighing out of relief. “You’re not gonna tell father, are you?”
Krissy held her hands together in front of her, “I am sixteen goin on seventeen, innocent as a rose.” She twirled then sat on a bench inside the bungalow. “Bachelor dandies, drinkers of brandies, what do I know of those?” She shrugged innocently.
Castiel looked up at Dean. “You were right though. I don’t know my children.” He stepped closer to be by Dean, even though the other man was on the stairs and he wasn’t.
“You know, you’re much less of a riddle when I see you here, Castiel.” Mick said as he leaned into Castiel’s arms.
Rolfe got off the bench, he was about to fall because of how much Krissy leaned towards him. “You are sixteen, going on seventeen. Baby, it’s time to think. Better beware, be canny and careful. Baby, you’re on the brink.” He patted her back softly, Krissy smiling up at him.
Rolfe smirked as he crossed his leg over the other. “You wait, little girl, on an empty stage,” He began to sing to her. “For fate to turn the light on.” He nodded at her with a smile. “Your life, little girl, is an empty page that men will want to write on.”
Dean’s eyes widened and he gasped, “Seven children!”
Mick sat down next to Gabe, “What happened, dear?”
“No.” Gabe agreed, “He’s rich.” He joked.
“And during dessert, always blow your nose.” Kurt teased.
“It’s very easy to like Dean.” She smiled then her eyebrows furrowed as she thought. “Except when it’s...um, difficult.” The sister said.
“Well, what?” Mick rolled his eyes, blowing out the cigarette.
Dean started to walk on the path, his eyes soft. “I’ve always longed for adventure, to do the things I’ve never dared. Now here I’m facing adventure....” He looked over at the city, his eyes admiring the little house on the hill. “Then why am I so scared?” Dean almost whispered. He loved the idea of adventure, to do things he’s never done before. It’d be so exciting!
Novak looked at him and tilted his head. “Well what about these?” He asked.
Mick smiled, flattered, “Oh?”
“Expect for every meal.” Sister Katherine chuckled and smiled at them.
“But it’s so wrong!” Dean protested. It reminded him of another home he knew before the abbey. He shook his head then looked back at Frau.
“I know what you expect, Mother! And I can do it!” Dean pleaded again, clasping his hands together, nervously. “I promise I can!”
“Of course it does! You try it.” Dean told her with an encouraging smile. “What things do you like?”
Dean nodded at him, “Yes, Captain.” He had nothing to hide anyway, he was an open book to most and usually said what was on his mind.
Castiel hummed softly as he looked at Mick in thought. “Lovely. Charming. Witty. Graceful. The perfect hostess.” Mick smiled, flattered. “And…. you’re gonna hate me for this…. In a way, my savior.” Castiel admitted to him.
“You may go in now, Dean.” She said softly, rubbing his shoulder for a moment as she smiled at him. Dean gave her a gentle smile back as she went inside the office. He was called there many of times before but each time seemed so much worse than the last, he was so nervous.
“He’d out pester any pest, drive a hornet from its nest.” Sister Sophia said with a small laugh.
“Oh, how do you solve a problem like Dean?” They all sang softly this time, almost out of sadness and discontent this time. Then they heard a door slam and all their heads turned to the sound.
“You will see to it that they conduct themselves at all times with the utmost orderliness and decorum.” Novak went on as if he didn’t even hear Dean. “I’m placing you in command.”
Castiel kissed Mick’s cheek then looked at him with a smile. “Are you trying to say I’m more at home here, among the birds and the flowers and the wind that moves through the trees like a restless sea, hm?” He asked Mick with a wink.
“What?” Dean asked.
Mick laughed softly then looked out at the lake again, sighing happily. “I do like it here, Castiel.” He said happily. “It’s so lovely and peaceful. How can you leave it as often as you do?” He asked him.
Dean smiled, ruffling Marta’s hair as he told them, “Now, put it all together.” They all started to sing together, “So Do La Fa Mi Do Re So Do La Ti Do Re Do.” Dean smiled back at the kids as he sat down on a bench. “Good!”
Dean nodded, “A deer, a female deer.” He smiled.
The Captain’s children were on a boat, Dean rowing it back to the house. The kids were having fun which mattered so much to him. Some of them were even singing happily.
“Good evening, children.” Dean said to them, looking at his seat before he sat down. He discreetly took the pinecone off his seat, looking to the children again.
Marta sighed, wiping her eyes, “Nothing.” But then the other girls started to cry as well and The Captain looked surprised.
“Dean.” Abaddon said, narrowing her eyes at him.
“Well, I’ll see that you get some material. Sooner rather than later.” Novak said with a thin smile. “Now, Mr....” He looked back at him.
“Please, Rolfe, send me a telegram.” Krissy begged softly, pleading with her eyes up at Rolfe. She stepped nearer to a tree, smiling. “I’ll start it for you. “Dear Krissy….”” She went to sit at a bench, waiting for Rolfe to continue it.
The children started to sing the words, each of them standing up from the bench as they sang. Dean stood too, joining in on it. He wrapped an arm around Jack and took Brigitta’s hand with a big smile as he started to walk into the city.
Dean rolled his eyes internally, crossing his arms. He may be a nun but he was still his own man and he definitely did not go by the rules of this house. “Captain?” He asked as he was about to leave. “I was wondering if, before you go, I could talk to you about some clothes for the children. For when they play.” He told him.
The Captain didn’t look directly at Dean in that moment. He wasn’t exactly sure why, maybe it was because he was in his night clothes. “You are obviously many things, not the least of which is repetitious.” The Captain observed.
“Franz, who delivered it?” Krissy asked the butler. She really wanted it to be one special person.
Castiel chuckled, “Yes, it was. Wasn’t it?” Mick laughed a little at him, rubbing his shoulder with his free hand. “More at home here than in Vienna, in all your glittering salons,” Castiel teased Mick, nudging him. Mick was quite the pampered Baron, might be why he felt so comfortable being more feminine. “Gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne, stumbling about to waltzes by Strauss I can’t even remember. Is that what you’re trying to say?” Castiel asked him teasingly.
Dean watched them with a gentle look in his eyes before he looked down at his hands and sighed. Perhaps he argued with Cas a little too hard. Gretl then gave some white flowers to Mick, smiling at him.
Gabe shrugged, “How else could I afford it?” He sighed and looked around the house grounds. “Oh, I like rich people. I like the way they live. I like the way I live when I’m with them.” Gabe ate his strudel happily now.
“I didn’t.” Castiel rolled his eyes as he started to walk away from Dean.
Dean shrugged and gave her a small smile, “Some people say that God likes to bowel and the sound of the thunder means he knocked down some pins.” He explained.
Dean thought for a moment and pursed his lips. “To find out what is the will of God and to do it wholeheartedly.” He answered back. He wasn’t the beat at following rules but he did listen sometimes to what the nuns have told him.
“Yes! Although they have the other clothes I made them too. But they had a fuck ton of fun in them.” Dean smiled at the Captain, nodding at him. Now, Dean swearing in front of Castiel, he did not expect.
