“Ah, well, I watched your October tarot reading, and it fit the pattern I’ve seen this month so far, and-”
“Me too.”  Dean pushed off the ground and held out a hand to Cas.  “Come on, Crazy Town, let’s find some food in this shithole.”
‘In the first light of dawn all my household gathered round me, the children brought pitch and the men whatever was necessary. On the fifth day I laid the keel and the ribs, then I made fast the planking. The ground-space was one acre, each side of the deck measured one hundred and twenty cubits, making a square. I built six decks below, seven in all. I divided them into nine sections with bulkheads between. I drove in wedges where needed, I saw to the punt poles, and laid in supplies. The carriers brought oil in baskets, I poured pitch into the furnace and asphalt and oil; more oil was consumed in caulking, and more again the master of the boat took into his stores. I slaughtered bullocks for the people and every day I killed sheep. I gave the shipwrights wine to drink as though it were river water, raw wine and red wine and oil and white wine. There was feasting then as -there is at the time of the New Year's festival; I myself anointed my head. On the seventh day the boat was complete.
“Nah, I’m good, just permanently blind in one eye, I’m good.”  But he laughed, and made Cas agree that he was just joking.
“Of course.  I write them longhand during class and then I type them out that night.  It’s a useful study technique.”
Sam thought for a moment.  “How do we summon at a crossroad?  We leave offerings, but also a token to show who’s calling.  Maybe we need to be more transparent.  Let him know for sure that it’s us and not Crowley or, or some other freak who happens to have his number.”
“Calm.  That’s real funny, Cas.  Like I’m supposed to be calm, like I’m supposed to be perfectly okay with my brother and, and, and my best friend or whatever, just casually summoning my ass?  I’m a demon, I don’t belong here!  Just send me back to Hell.  Now!”
“Cas.”  Dean took off his seatbelt so he could turn and fully face Cas.  Even propped his leg on the seat oh-so-casually,
Cas and Dean had already stowed their bags and were in the front seat, steadily plowing through Krispy Kremes, when Sam and Jess strolled up.
was a woman of low birth, the natural daughter of someone. They became acquainted during the summer the Winchesters spent in Lyme. The year his sister eloped. Had he stayed near Alex that night, as he had promised Father so faithfully to do, instead of allowing himself to be charmed away by a pretty face and eager hands, none of this would have happened! To this day, of course, he blames himself for everything: for Alex’s unhappy marriage, for Emma’s ignoble station (and her mother’s), for allowing the family to fall apart under such circumstances.
When Chuck heard the words of Dean he called to him from heaven: ‘Dean, why are you cursing the woman, the mistress who taught you to eat bread fit for gods and drink wine of kings? She who put upon you a ‘magnificent garment, did she not give you glorious Castiel for your companion, and has not Castiel, your own brother, made you rest on a 'royal bed and recline on a couch at his left hand? He has made the princes of the earth kiss your feet, and now all the people of URUK lament and wail over you. When you are dead he will let his hair grow long for your sake, he will wear a lion's pelt and wander through the desert.'
The prefect’s jaw goes rigid at the word.  “Yes.”  But he tilts his head and scrunches up his eyes.  “Wait, you’re muggleborn, too, though.”
With his arm slung over Cas’ shoulder, Dean turned his face towards the far end of the pool, at the lovebirds who were very clearly conspiring against them.  “Now, Jess is the least of your worries.  She’s a prankster, no doubt, smart as the day is long, but she’s small.  If she starts giving you a problem, you just start hiding her stuff up high where she can’t find it.”  He laughed.  “Last time I drove Sam to school, she was moving in down the hall.  She tried to start shit with me, and uh, well, I’m not gonna tell you what, because, um.”
“Krispy Kreme,” he rasped with all the enthusiasm he could muster.  Which was not much.  He inhaled the scented air escaping the vent and sighed, if not happily at least contentedly.  “Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel --- GILGAMESH: The hero of the Epic; son of the goddess Ninsun and of a priest of KULLAB, fifth king of URUK after the flood, famous as a great builder and as a judge of the dead. A cycle of epic poems has collected round his name.
Castiel realized he was staring open-mouthed. He shook himself. Sure, a good ASMR video could be hypnotic, but he felt bewitched.
“Wait until after the sun has risen, or you’ll be in darkness until noon.  Claire should leave around midday if she takes the same route.”
would do.  Maybe if Cas fell asleep before him, he’d give that a try.  Sam smiled and shook his head and followed the others inside.
Dena bowed and did as her Queen commanded.  But she sincerely doubted there would be rest with the specter of Crowley hanging over her head.
The Winchesters have only just come to live at Elysium. Dean is in a plush bedchamber, adjacent to Castiel’s but not connected as they often are in those stately homes. Dean can feel the heaviness of sleep weighing on his limbs and yet he cannot submit to it. Even as exhausted as he is after the day’s exertions, even with the weariness of travel and long confinement in the post-chaise, even with the joy of reunion with the longed-for Novaks, something gnaws at his mind. The house is too still, too quiet in the daylight; and now under cover of dark, strange creakings and moanings fill his ears. The ancient trees scrape their gnarled fingers across the mossy stones below his window, groaning against the chill of the north wind. But it is the feeling of a presence, not malevolent but omnipresent, which braces Dean’s eyes against sweet repose.
“It’s not what I expected.”  He swapped it out for the other cup and drank deeply.  “Ahh. Much better.”
Ash waved off any further discussion and went back to her maps.  “All in the past.  I’m happier here anyway.  From all accounts, Dena came back changed.  I probably wouldn’t know her now.  Ah, here it is,” she added, flourishing a map of the valley.
The Impala’s tires spun on the gravel before catching and peeling out.  Sam had no idea where they were nor which direction to go.  He turned right, hoping for the best.  He fumbled with the GPS and tossed it to Dean.  “Here. Set it for me.”
It is after one such revel that the tired hosts and their sisters (the younger ladies having retired some time earlier) lounge together most indecorously on the sofas so lately abandoned by indolent chaperones, when they are startled to hear visitors announced. Almost before they can shift to make themselves presentable, who should enter but the younger Winchester brother, accompanied by Miss Morningstar!
“It’s fine,” he muttered through a mouthful of food.  He gulped his coffee and swallowed the last of his pancakes before turning his eyes to Dean. “I’ve actually never had a good nickname before, so um.  I like it.”
He glances now to Sam. Though his eyes are like fire, his voice is made of ice: “Where were you, brother?”
He turned red and dropped his eyes to his hands, folded in his lap.  “I, um. Clarence is a pseudonym, ma’am. My name is Castiel. Cas.”
And Dean?  Dean hid behind his sasquatch of a brother and barely felt a drop.  He held his hand out and gazed up into the sky.  “Gee, is it raining?  I thought I felt a few raindrops!”  He had enough time to laugh at his own hilariousness before Sam scooped him up and deposited him in the pool alongside Cas.
“Yeah.  Yeah, of course I do, I just, this is all new to me.  It’s gonna take more than a day to wrap my head around the idea that my little brother is leaving the nest, alright?”
“Yes, I believe it did.  The money came from a side project he headed during college.  Apparently it was quite lucrative.”
He nodded.  “Good.  Yeah.”  He dumped some ketchup out onto the plate and shoved a few fries into the puddle.  “Okay, I got one: DC or Marvel?”
He went to the forge and said, 'I will give orders to the armourers; they shall cast us our weapons while we watch them.' So they gave orders to the armourers and the craftsmen sat down in conference. They went into the groves of the plain and cut willow and boxwood; they cast for them axes of nine score pounds, and great swords they cast with blades of six score pounds each one, with pommels and hilts of thirty pounds. They cast for Castiel the axe ‘Might of Heroes' and the bow of ANSHAN; and Castiel was armed and Dean; and the weight of the arms they carried was thirty score pounds.
“Yeah, but that was more than just watching me and a kid play an amateur game,” he said, gesturing at the table. Cas’s smile widened at Dean’s words and Dean found himself leaning a little bit closer.
“Don’t worry, here’s your sad excuse of an omelet.” He pushed the plate toward his brother and watched in disgust as he dug in. He turned away from the travesty in front of him and tucked into his decent breakfast with enthusiasm.
If he had a new neighbor that he was expected to try and actually act like a real human around then it would definitely need to wait till tomorrow. Which meant navigating this hallway without ending up on the floor. He pushed off from the wall and started treading past the mountains of boxes and had almost made it when his elbow knocked against one of the stacks and almost brought it down on him. He threw his arms out and caught the box that had toppled off the top, sending him staggering into his apartment door.
“Uh, thanks.” Dean pushed around the last bit of his pie on his plate. There was an opening in the conversation, an opening that had made itself known several times for Dean over the years. He’d never taken it before but now, sitting with Cas, he found the leap wasn’t so terrifying.
“Right,” he agreed, and Cas smiled at Sam and Dean while he thanked them before bending down so he was on the same level as Jack.
It was almost 6 o’clock and the sky had long gone dark when Dean shut his apartment door behind him. He threw a stir fry together and then crashed on the couch, already reaching for his phone.
It came as a surprise when the long-awaited knock did come. Dean looked up, confused, until he caught sight of a clock. Somehow two hours had passed, and Cas was right on time while Dean was halfway through relabeling his spice rack. A second knock roused Dean from his shock as Sam came out of his bedroom, his arms loaded with textbooks. He took one look at Dean and rolled his eyes.
“You seemed to be interested but I thought you might need some encouragement,” he said with a rather cheeky smile. Dean could only shake his head, smiling helplessly at the man before him.
It may have been the slight disturbance of Dean talking or the sound of his father’s voice, but it was at that moment Jack sat up, rubbing at his eyes before he caught sight of Cas.
Dean’s week started off badly.  At this point he was beginning to wonder why that surprised him anymore.
“Uh huh.” She eyed him for a moment before she shrugged. “You can tell me about it tomorrow after I kick your ass.”
“I…I always liked baking.” The words felt like they were caught in his throat and for a moment he regretted speaking. A handful of seconds later he heard a rattle of a plate and then a warm weight fell on his shoulder. He looked up to find Cas staring at him, his blue eyes dark and knowing as though, somehow, he understood Dean’s reluctance to put into words what had lived for so long inside of him. He had never brought himself to explain even to Sam the truth of his time away. Returning home had meant shelving it, to help Sam, to help the business and Bobby, and if Dean sometimes lay in his empty bed at night wishing for a different life, then that was his burden and his alone. But now, with Cas watching him so earnestly in the dark, the words seem to rise from his chest, waiting for him to open his mouth before spilling into the air between them.
“Well, in that case—and I get it if you say no, but did you want to come to dinner tonight? My brother and his girlfriend are hosting dinner and a couple of our friends are going. There’s plenty of room for you.”
“Uh, fine,” he muttered, glancing down at the box in his hands to avoid that intense gaze. “Sorry.” He held out the box in question and the man took it though he didn’t look away from Dean.
A dry laugh caught his attention, and he looked up to see Cas’s eyes crinkle in a wide, breathless smile.
“About what happened last night…” Dean’s voice trailed off as he stared at Cas’s bed, a mess to prove that Cas had indeed being tossing and turning. The blanket had been thrown back across the bed and Dean stared at it long enough for Cas to frown at him and lift a hand slowly before lowering it again and instead calling to Dean.
“Take that back,” Dean said harshly. Charlie stuck her tongue at him as she dumped several bags on the couch. One glance revealed them to be full of decorations.
Dean eyed the man who was grinning broadly at Cassie who was now turning to the Italian woman. She shook her head before he even opened mouth.
“Ah,” Dean hesitated as he glanced over at Cas. “Have here.” Anna grinned but thankfully didn’t say anything and Dean shuffled off to find a table.
He jumped behind the wheel of his impala and drove over to the café. The roads were empty and the streets reminded him of a ghost town. He saw no one as he drove through the centre of town and when he pulled up at the café, there was not a single soul in sight. He checked the time and saw that he was early and decided to wait in the car where it was at least warm.
“I’m rather tired,” Cas said, his voice louder in the hallway than Dean was expecting after the last few minutes. Belatedly Dean realised that Cas hadn’t slept well, if at all, last night and looked half dead on his feet now.
“It’s his day off,” the server said and Dean looked up to see the red headed waitress smiling at him.
They spent another hour in the arcade as Jack led them to the classics of Pac-man and Space Invaders before they moved onto the more modern dance games. Dean was delighted to learn that while Cas had him beat in the games that required fast reflexes and apparently a knowledge of physics, Dean was faster on his feet. Where Cas stumbled through the moves, Dean managed to keep up easily with the beats. Jack laughed from the sidelines until Cas conceded defeat. They both took it in turns to lose to Jack and while Dean knew he was losing on purpose, he wasn’t too sure about Cas.
“Only if you want me asking you,” Dean warned, and Sam shook his head. He backed off, though, as Dean put a pot of coffee on and closed his eyes once more. Behind his eyelids all he could see were Cas’s eyes as they widened and darkened with what Dean thought must have been interest. His stomach lurched as heat seemed to spread through his chest at the thought.
“Goodnight Dean,” Cas said finally and Dean watched helplessly as Cas vanished into his bedroom, the door closing firmly behind him. Dean stood there for another minute and stared at the door before he turned, picked up his bag and headed for his own room.
Jack led them past the still broken elevator and to the staircase, where he held out a hand. Cas immediately took hold of it before glancing at Dean.
“Eileen and I share some classes,” Sam explained, and Dean bit back a laugh at how obviously uncomfortable his brother was. There was a long awkward pause before Dean realized Cas was still standing next to him and Eileen’s gaze was now drifting towards him.
“Ah, Chicago,” he said, quickly swallowing a bite of pizza in order to answer. Dean took the opportunity to snag another slice for himself and settle back.
“Are you volunteering to taste test?” he asked, and Dean choked on his coffee. He looked around in time to see the amused smirk on Cas’s face.
“I said good night,” he said and Dean could definitely tell Cas was far from relaxed as his voice became brittle and tense.
Dean stepped up to the counter which was surprisingly empty. In fact, he realised looking around, the coffee shop was relatively empty. Cas moved forward and greeted Dean at the counter.
He was busy mixing the pancake batter when he heard the jangle of keys and the apartment door suddenly opened.
And then Cas was squeezing his hand once more and tugging very gently. Dean looked up and found Cas looking at him with his eyebrow raised slightly.
“Off you go, then,” he said and Cas rolled his eyes at him before returning to the counter. Dean watched him go, his chest almost uncomfortably warm and his cheeks starting to ache from his smile.
“Hello,” she said as she came to a stop beside Cas. “You must be Dean. I’ve heard so much about you. I’m Kelly, Jack’s mom.”
“Now we all have flowers,” Jack announced, and Dean looked down to see the half-crushed flower sticking out from behind Jack’s ear. He bit back a laugh and caught Cas’s eye instead. Whatever had been bothering Cas earlier seemed to have vanished and now he smiled openly at Dean. A sudden jolt in Dean’s stomach forced him to look away as he cleared his throat.
The controls had already been handed out and Benny, Stevie, Charlie and Maggie were battling it out on screen while the others looked on. Dean felt the tension that had settled in his shoulders relax as the others laughter filled the room.
“Of course, don’t despair,” Castiel teased. Dean slowly straightened up and watched the two for a moment as they smiled at each other. Castiel then turned, as if remembering Dean was there and Dean found himself on the receiving end of that warm smile once more.
As it was, Dean managed to avoid Cas until Thursday morning. He had just left his apartment when Cas came out of his own apartment sans Jack and immediately smiled at Dean. It was only small but it felt as though all the air had been sucked out of the hallway as Dean scrambled for something to say.
Dean sat down and pulled out his phone automatically, though his gaze didn’t leave Cas. He flipped his phone over in his hand a few times before he put it down and leant back in his chair. He watched as Anna, while passing Cas a fresh crate of milk, say something to him which caused Cas to turn around, his gaze searching the café. When he spotted Dean he smiled and Dean’s fingers let go of his phone completely and returned the grin.
“Yes,” Dean said, ducking his head to avoid her gaze. He could feel her stare all the way down the street until they reached the bakery. “She’s annoying but mostly harmless,” he explained to Cas who looked mildly alarmed at the sudden censure directed at him.
Dean hesitated for a moment and then lifted his coffee awkwardly to thank her. He could see her grinning but for the moment embarrassment had yet to reach him. It looked like he’d have to get coffee again on Wednesday. He had time to practise being a mature adult then by preparing a better apology.
“What?” he snapped, before glancing around for Jack. He found the boy by the couch where he was carefully putting down his backpack.
He smiled as he sent it and hoped that maybe he’d receive a quick reply. He was startled when his hone buzzed only seconds after he put his phone down.
It wasn’t long after that that an impromptu dance floor was set up. Charlie, Stevie, Jo, and Ash quickly claimed it as theirs, and Donna gleefully dragged Dean out onto it after he lost to her over another round of shots. It turned out that neither of them were very good dancers. Donna was laughing too hard to put much thought into her moves, and Dean had had enough that he was edging into drunk territory. A sudden twist caused him to lose his balance and he grabbed hold of Donna’s arm to hold himself up. She was giggling as she propped him up and Dean grinned at her as Sam spun Eileen around next to them.
‘We can’t continue like this here,’ he said and Dean finally glanced at the two separate chairs in the room and winced as he realised what Cas meant.
“He must have terrible taste, then,” Dean joked but Cas made a disapproving noise in the back of his throat.
“Have a good afternoon guys,” Alex called after them as they left. “Oh, and Dean?” Dean winced and looked back to see the teenager waving her phone at him with a shit-eating grin on her face. “Jody says hi.”
He turned around and hurried down the hallway. As soon as he was out of sight of Cas’s door he broke into a sprint which he didn’t slow down from until he’d reached the garage. He managed to slink past Bobby with less caustic comments than he’d expected and he was soon back at work.
“Okay, what the hell is up with this moping schtick of yours?” Jo demanded, but Dean shook his head. There was no way he was going to tell her. She’d tease him before calling Charlie, who was the last person he needed knowing about his fucked-up feelings.
“I can’t thank you both enough,” Cas said, breaking Dean out of his thoughts. He shook his head, determined to focus on the present, the present where Cas was smiling and looking at Dean softly and was one hundred percent unavailable.
“Okay, so I shouldn’t have messaged them but it was just a joke.” Dean winced at the weak excuse and looked up to see Charlie shaking her head.
“We’re gonna have to play pool,” he finally said, and Cas laughed in delight. The sound seemed to draw Jack’s attention as the little boy left his game and reappeared by the table.
It was his eyes that caught Dean’s attention most though. They were a shocking blue unlike any shade Dean had ever seen before. His eyes were narrowed with concern as he approached. It was only then that Dean realized the man was talking to him and he quickly refocused.
Dean felt his lips twitch and he leant back in his seat and finished off his sandwich while watching people walk past the café, shopping bags in gloved hands.
“Rest in peace,” Ash said as the screen went dark, and Dean sighed and scrubbed at his face before turning back to his office. He changed out of his coveralls and grabbed his bag and a folder in which he kept a hard copy of the garage’s finances.
“I don’t know how late I’ll be. It’s all very last minute but the library said they’d had their usual staff call in sick and decided to put me on earlier than planned.”
“I understand if you don’t want to. I can take him with me to the library. I’m sure they won’t mind too much,” he rambled even as he started to turn away. Sam shot Dean a classic bitchface and Dean quickly called out to Cas before he could leave.
“That,” Dean said slowly, as if he were about to announce some groundbreaking news and, in Dean’s opinion, that’s what was happening. “That is Han Solo.”
“Whoops,” she said. Dean looked around to find the whole room biting back smiles as they stared at him. A sudden heat in his cheeks caused him to duck his head even as Sam started drawing attention to the time.
“There’s also this for you.” He hurried back into his bedroom, ignoring Sam’s protests as he grabbed a roughly wrapped present from the top of his dresser. He tossed it onto the counter beside their half-eaten breakfast and poured himself another mug of coffee. “Happy birthday, bitch.”
“Seriously, Dean. If you don’t want to talk about it then we won’t. But will you come to dinner? I found a new meatloaf recipe and I need a guinea pig.”
“I’m sorry, alright? I forgot that we’d organized the renovations to start this week, otherwise I would’ve given you a heads up.”
“What the fuck?” Dean twisted around and saw that he had tripped over a cardboard box. A quick glance around the hallway revealed dozens more like it stacked against the walls and scattered on the floor. In his exhausted state it resembled a minefield more than his hallway and he couldn’t figure out how he was going to cross it to his door.
They finished off the pizza in comfortable silence. With Jack no longer sitting between them they both seemed to gravitate to the middle of the couch until their shoulders were brushing with every move. They watched as Jack started pulling things out of the boxes and stacking them in piles that must have made sense to him, although Dean couldn’t discern any sort of pattern.
Dean’s good mood crashed around him as he was once more swamped with guilt. Though, as he watched the door swing shut behind them, he wasn’t quite sure what he was feeling guilty for.
“Oh.” Dean didn’t know what to say and so he shuffled off to the side to wait for his coffee. A few minutes later the queue had dispersed and his coffee was ready. Just as he was turning to go the red head called out to him, winking as she said, “see you on Wednesday.”
Dean looked up after a while and was shocked to see almost an hour had passed as he’d perused beewatcher’s account. He’d long since finished his dinner and he quickly closed twitter and put his phone down. What did he care if one person couldn’t appreciate a joke – one that Dean hadn’t even started. That was on them.
Dean’s hand slipped free of Cas’s hair and Cas grumbled a little until he realised that Dean was now pushing at his trench coat. He let go of Dean long enough to push his coat off with enthusiastic help from Dean, along with his jacket before he grabbed hold of him again. Dean’s hands couldn’t seem to stay still as they moved over Cas’s back, hotter now that they were separated only by the thin material of Cas’s shirt.
“I’m glad you thought so…” his voice trailed away and it took a moment for Dean to catch on but when he did he grinned and almost knocked over his mug in his rush to respond.
Dean’s heart gave a leap which resulted in what felt like it lodging itself in Dean’s throat which might explain the almost choked noise he let out when he realised what Cas meant.
“How old is he?” Dean asked, suddenly unable to breathe properly and desperate for a change in conversation. Cas was silent for a moment and Dean could feel his gaze on him but, thankfully, Cas allowed the change.
“His fairly small for a cat, we think he was the runt of the litter. He’s a tabby,” Cas explained as he followed Dean.
“Uh, hi?” Dean glanced over at Castiel who smiled at the boy before he glanced at Dean. His smile slipped when he saw Dean’s confusion.
The remaining glow of their afternoon was fading from Dean’s mind leaving him feeling cold and sick. The apartment building came into view and Dean managed to avoid another conversation with Cas as Jack roused himself enough to ask Cas about dinner, which led to Jack rambling about mac and cheese until he drifted off again.
Sam wasn’t wrong though, he thought sourly. He’d managed to get almost all the housework done already and he still had a couple of hours before Cas would arrive. If he slowed down now, he’d start thinking about what was coming and that was the last thing he needed to do. If he started thinking he’d start panicking and build everything up in his head and why the hell did Cas agree to this? Surely it wasn’t a way to say thank you for yesterday? But what else could it be? It’s not like Cas was interested in him. He had a family, and he didn’t come across as the kind of person who would ruin that. Even if he was, Dean was the last person in the world worth that.
It was the thought of Kelly’s wrath that prompted Dean to speak quickly, though he still hadn’t thought through what he needed to say.
“He’s seen New Hope now,” Dean said. His voice was far more defensive than he’d intended, which seemed to amuse Charlie.
“What?” he asked, his mind still half on his phone until the scent of something burning registered. “Shit!”
As Dean locked up the apartment, he was so on edge he felt like he might actually puke. He glanced across the hall but Cas didn’t emerge.
“That’s life, I suppose,” he muttered. It was quiet for a long moment as Dean forced himself to finish off the pie that now tasted like ash. Cas’s hand squeezed his shoulder once more before it slowly slid down Dean’s arm until it stopped just above Jack’s head which rested in the crook of Dean’s elbow. Dean’s plate was empty now and he stared down at it to stop himself from staring at Cas’s hand. Instead, he focused on the warmth that bled into his skin from Cas’s hand.
“Don’t question it, Cas,” he complained. Cas’s frown was soon directed his way but he didn’t say anything more. Dean found himself too distracted to continue his reprimand at the sight of the slight furrow that appeared between Cas’s eyebrows. He turned back to the movie and shoveled another mouthful of pork in to keep himself from doing something truly stupid like reaching out to smooth that furrow with his thumb.
“It’s okay,” Castiel — no, Cas — cut in. “I just wasn’t expecting it. No one’s ever called me that before.”
He quietly laughed to himself when he found him recognising more songs than he’d expected to. beewatcher had certainly taught him something. And speaking of beewatcher, Dean glanced over at the coffee machine. He had been prepared to see Duma or the angry blonde standing there but was shocked to see Cas pouring out lattes. He had a red Santa hat sitting crookedly on top of his head which left Dean smiling.
Donna’s smile slipped as she caught sight of something over Dean’s shoulder which caused Dean to turn around. He was instantly met with the sight of an angry looking Cas. His blue eyes were narrowed and his lips were pressed tightly together. Despite the obvious anger in his face, Dean still ached to reach out for him. He didn’t say anything, but instead met Dean’s gaze for a few seconds before he turned away and walked out of the diner, Kelly and Jack following behind him. Kelly looked worried, and Jack looked back and slowly waved to Dean, as though he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to.
“My babysitter.” Cas headed over to the door and Dean drifted after him, helpless but to follow him.
, he thought as his mind went blank. The man, possibly the Jack whose box was now in Dean’s arms, looked to be about Dean’s age. He was only an inch or so shorter than him with broad shoulders and dark hair which was standing up in all directions as though he had been caught in a storm.
“I know,” he said. He hesitated before continuing when he saw what looked like hope in Cas’s eyes. “But if you want some help, I can come with.”
“What about you brother?” Dean asked hesitantly. He’d tightened his grip on Cas’s hand as he spoke and was now rubbing his thumb soothingly across Cas’s fingers.
Jody hummed. “Pretty sure she’s not the only one,” she said. Dean looked away until Jody put her hand on Dean’s arm.
“Okay then, Friday night,” he repeated. His own lips curved up into a small smile as he stared at Cas. A sudden clunk caused Dean to whirl around only to find Jo wearing a shit-eating grin as she stared at him.
He sighed and turned to flip over the pancakes before grabbing a tissue from the bench and wiping up the spill. He stood up and found Sam watching him with an eyebrow raised from across the bench. Dean scowled, his defenses rising automatically at the sight of an expression Dean associated with Sam meddling.
Eventually they pulled apart to breathe and Dean panted, leaning forward to rub his nose against Cas’s. He laughed when he felt Cas smile again though his laugh quickly turned into a yawn which caused Cas to laugh in turn.
‘We’ll get a new one,’ he murmured and Dean startled, his head swinging round to stare at Cas before looking back at the television.
For a moment, Dean’s hands were empty, and then he was sliding them into Cas’s hair, finally tugging on the wild dark locks as Cas groaned against his lips.
He glanced back at the counter, however, when he’d reached the door. Luck was on his side. Or at least a little. The waiter had re-emerged without his apron on and a sandwich in one hand. In his other hand was his phone which he was frowning down at and so he didn’t see the half wave which Dean abandoned upon realising the waiter wasn’t going to look up. His cheeks were feeling rather hot when Dean turned away and shoved the door open.
They stood in silence. Dean waited at first for Cas to say something but when it became obvious that he wasn’t going to he searched his mind for something else to say. Cas’s shoulders were still tense.
Jack’s bright, young voice cut through the din of the Roadhouse, and Dean turned around as a pair of arms wrapped around his legs.
“We need to move quickly,” he said, and Balthazar’s grin vanished. Instead he looked at Cas apologetically.
“Uh, I’m actually throwing Sam a birthday party. On Saturday, at the Roadhouse,” he stuttered out. A brief look of confusion crossed Cas’s face before it went blank. Dean winced as guilt like acid burned in his stomach. He knew he should stick to his original plan, but he found that he couldn’t stand seeing that expression on Cas’s face, let alone being the one responsible for putting it there. Cas’s frown was something that Dean didn’t want to be the cause of even though, deep down, he knew that nothing could come of this. Nothing should come of this. “You wanna come along? I’m sure Sam would love it if you were there.”
“Tea, perhaps?” he suggested. Dean knew Cas was right; they would need clear heads for this discussion, so no matter how badly Dean wanted some liquid courage he pulled out two mugs and set about making them tea. He pulled out the box of tea bags that he had hidden behind a box of cereal that was more sugar than anything else. It had been the only place he’d known Sam wouldn’t look.
“Maybe we should slow down,” Cas said, and Dean bit back a groan at how rough Cas’s voice was. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply for a moment before he pushed himself upright.
Lord Novak should hesitate, but he does not. He slips his hand around his freind’s upper arm with nary a thought, as easily as a lady with her favourite gentleman. If he notices that Mr Winchester stands a bit taller, that he straightens his shoulders somewhat at the attention, Castiel says nothing.
Then he called to the man Castiel, he called to the child of the gods: ‘Why have you come so great a journey; for what have you travelled so far, crossing the dangerous waters; tell me the reason for your coming?’ Castiel answered, ‘For Dean; I loved him dearly, together we endured all kinds of hardships; on his account I have come, for the common lot of man has taken him. I have wept for him day and night, I would not give up his body for burial, I thought my friend would come back because of my weeping. Since he went, my life is nothing; that is why I have travelled here in search of Death my father; for men say he has entered the assembly of the gods, and has found everlasting life: I have a desire to question him, concerning the living and the dead.’ Cain opened his mouth and said, speaking to Castiel, ‘No man born of woman has done what you have asked, no mortal man has gone into the mountain; the length of it is twelve leagues of darkness; in it there is no light, but the heart is oppressed with darkness. From the rising of the sun to the setting of the sun there is no light. Castiel said, ‘Although I should go in sorrow and in pain, with sighing and with weeping, still I must go. Open the gate I of the mountain:’ And Cain said, ‘Go, Castiel, I permit you to pass through the mountain of MASHU and through the high ranges; may your feet carry you safely home. The gate of the mountain is open.’

“Shh.  Not yet.”  He turned it up and sang along.  His voice grew somewhat stronger in the final verse.  “‘
“Right.”  They listened in silence for a minute before Dean asked, “So, uh, why this then?  It have special significance for you, or…?”
Castiel felt slightly less justified in thinking Dean a liar when he saw ImpalaASMR post a new video.  He didn’t feel any less disappointed, though. He clicked play.
“Yeah well, not fun.  Figure of speech.  Don’t ever tell anyone I told you this, but I guess it feels good to have someone to talk to.”
“None more satisfying,” Dean replies with a grin. “Not far from the orangerie, within a reasonable distance of the house for the convenience of making a picnic, good deeply shaded walks to keep the young ladies cool and cheerful. There may even be fruit in the old strawberry beds. And- more to see,” he concludes clumsily but with an arch look.
More than anything, though, it was just … fun.  None of the other participants seemed concerned about the potential awkwardness of digging one’s crotch into their partner’s hair.  When Dean traded places with Jess, Cas felt uncomfortable for ever considering the sexual implications of the game.  At least until Dean threw barbs at him about the hot blonde straddling him.  Cas decided his best recourse to that was to slice at the water with his palm, splashing a sharp stream directly at Dean’s face.
“Stop.  I don’t wanna know.”  He wiped off the straw with his fingers and passed Cas the cup.  “Try it again.  With human tastebuds.”
“WHOA whoa.”  Dean took it away from him, poured him a sensible amount, and managed to not laugh when Cas drank it as a shot and immediately recoiled.  “Okay, you’ve had your liquid courage. Spill.”
“He is- the apothecary is with him now.” Tears fill Jo’s eyes and she glances at Castiel. “I’m so sorry, I fear that I am to blame!”
Sam passed him the box of pastries he’d picked up at his first refueling stop.  By the time he’d made it back to the car, the hangover twins had passed out again.  No breakfast for them.  “He’ll want the bear claw, but the others are fair game.”
“Yep.  Tell you the truth,” he added, lowering his voice conspiratorially, “I dropped out of high school.  Had to work. But my brother, man,” he beamed. “My brother Sammy is, like, the smartest kid you’ve ever seen.  I thought I was gonna have to work myself to death to pay for his college, but damn if he didn’t get a full ride!  So I figured, I had all this money saved up for him, maybe me and my GED should go to college, too. Better than sitting around watching porn and feeling sorry for myself.”
Dean laughed.  “Dude, Cas, you don’t have to buy my groceries.”  He smiled at the cashier, the full force of his charm on display.  “This whole basket is mine; my friend here doesn’t even drink beer.  Can he have the total without it?”
Sam could almost not stomach the stars in Cas’ eyes.  He cleared his throat to get Cas to hold out his arm so he could finish bandaging him.  The dorks ate peanuts and gummy bears and jabbered on like a couple of lovestruck middle schoolers, and it made Sam grin.
“He needs to know he’s needed.  We have to give him a reason to come home. And I believe the phrase is, ‘The more, the merrier.’”
Remembering something that Miss Novak had relayed to her prior to the ball, Jo brightens. “Assuming that he does not come to an understanding with her beforehand, we may soon have nothing to fear; Miss Morningstar has been summoned home! Her father has deemed her stay at L’Enfer to be quite long enough, and he wishes her to return to La Cage.”
Amara went into her room, she put on a dress becoming to her body, she put on jewels to make her breast beautiful, she placed a tiara on her head and her skirts swept the ground. Then she went up to the altar of the Sun, standing upon the roof of the palace; she burnt incense and lifted her arms to Chuck as the smoke ascended: ‘O Chuck, why did you give this restless heart to Castiel, my son; why did you give it? You have moved him and now he sets out on a long journey to the Land of Lucifer, to travel an unknown road and fight a strange battle. Therefore from the day that he goes till the day he returns, until he reaches the cedar forest, until he kills Lucifer and destroys the evil thing which you, Chuck, abhor, do not forget him; but let the dawn, Becky, your dear bride, remind you always, and when day is done give him to the watchman of the night to keep him from harm.' Then Amara the mother of Castiel extinguished the incense, and she called to Dean with this exhortation: ‘Strong Dean, you are not the child of my body, but I will receive you as my adopted son; you are my other child like the foundlings they bring to the temple. Serve Castiel as a foundling serves the temple and the priestess who reared him. In the presence of my women, any votaries and hierophants, I declare it.' Then she placed - the amulet for a pledge round his neck, and she said to him, ‘I entrust my son to you; bring him back to me safely.’
“You made it to class.”  Cas had watched him slip into the classroom just as the professor turned off the lights to begin the lecture.
Miss Morningstar encounters Lord Novak and Mr Winchester as they exit the labyrinth, clearly deep in conference.
A small smile lit Cas’ face.  “Well, yes.  Is there anything more appealing to the Dean we knew than love?”
Noon came and went with Sam still at the wheel.  He figured he could make it ’til two or three, at least as far as the next blip on the map.  A short nap helped Cas shake off the night before, and he crawled out from under his coat to keep Sam company for most of the early shift.
Jo does not scruple to say the first thing that enters her mind. “She is made to be a wife, Sam,” says she, “a dull creature, a colourless weed. There are thousands of ladies like her, content to wed and breed and never enjoy a laugh for anything, and to raise their daughters to the same cheerless fate. I am not that sort of woman, Sam. And Miss Novak less so. She is more akin to a hothouse flower, unique and interesting, and though lively, she is delicate. Not physically, perhaps; her heart is easily bruised. I protect her, and in return she offers me the novelty of her company. And our freindship is as good as a marriage, Sam.”
On the third morning after the ball, as Miss Morningstar is again announced as a visitor to Chevrolet, Dean begins to wonder if perhaps his brother is not seeing too much of Ruby. After the visit, he invites his brother and sister to walk with him to Garrison House, knowing full well that Sam will have no interest in attending, and knowing also that his sister will not be detained for an instant from such a request. Miss Novak, you must understand, is a shameless collector of gossip, or perhaps she is merely a collector of shameless gossip. On the morrow following any ball, the lady of Garrison House, though not an active participant in the talk, is sure to know all of the most scandalous, the most salacious gossip between Hampshire and London. Jo quickly discovered this talent in Miss Novak and took to calling on her at every opportunity (and there were many, for their brothers were nearly inseparable). Not a fortnight after their first ball, Miss Novak had developed a decided fondness for the wild little Winchester sister and found in her a willing audience. Jo found in Anna a steadfast friend, and a pleasing one at that. They both soon found their own happiness quite intertwined.
“Right,” Dean nodded, his chest swelling with some emotion he didn’t want to think about too closely. “Good. We—I’ll see you then. It’s at four,” he added.
Castiel caught Dean’s eye as they brought the last box in — yet another box of books — and quickly reached for his phone as Dean stretched out his back.
“You okay, man?” Sam asked and Dean seconded his concern as he got a better look at Cas. He was pale and while his hair was dishevelled and he’d clearly been in bed all night, the shadowsunder his eyes spoke of a restless night.
Without saying anything, Dean grabbed hold of Cas’s bag for him and Cas looked around at him, his eyes wide and more awake than they had looked all day. Dean attempted to smile at him but could tell it looked as awkward as it felt by the frown and look of concern that crossed Cas’s face. Dean huffed out a quiet “come on” before turning away and following Sam, who had already left the garage and the ensuing awkwardness. He could hear Cas following him through the bunker and though none of them had said anything it was obvious they were all heading for their bedrooms and calling it a night.
He cleared his suddenly dry throat. “Your turn,” he said gruffly and waited for Cas to hit the puck.
“Sorry, I need to just…” he trailed off awkwardly and gestured in Charlie’s direction. Without another word he left, striding away into the crowd of friends and family, a heavy weight resting in his stomach. He ducked away from Charlie and looped back around to the bar where he finished off his beer and started on the second that had been meant for Cas. He glanced back over to see Cas reach Kelly’s side. He looked around, frowning in confusion as he passed her a drink before he bent down to pass a juice to Jack. Dean kept his head low, and eventually Cas gave up. With a disappointed look on his face, Cas followed Kelly and Jack to a nearby table, and Dean resolved to stay away for the rest of the night.
He forced himself across the hallway and into his dark apartment. Sam was still out at a study group and so there was no one to judge Dean for falling back against his apartment door like the jilted lover in the rom-com movies that Dean definitely never watched. He shut his eyes, exhaustion washing over him once more and he let his head fall back.
They finally reached their floor and were just approaching Cas’s apartment when Dean’s door suddenly opened, and the brunette Dean had seen that morning stepped out. Dean’s eyebrow rose as Sam appeared in the doorway and visibly bit back a groan when he saw Dean.
Before he could say anything, however, Cas was already speaking, a small smile gracing his lips as he stared at Dean.
“Right,” he said, the sudden change in conversation throwing him and he had no idea where to go from here. He looked down at their hands and realised that for Cas to go to bed Dean would have to let go. For something that he hadn’t been doing for long at all, he found the idea of letting go almost unbearable.
“Ah, yes,” he managed to spit out. The barista smiled at him, his eyes crinkling in the corners and fuck it wasn’t fair. Dean glanced behind the barista but he couldn’t see the red headed waitress anywhere.
“Sam came back two hours ago. He’s in the room next door – there’s some food leftover if you’re hungry,” he explained and Dean relaxed. He stretched and decided that food could wait until the morning. It was only then that he remembered what had woken him up in the first place.
“Here,” Cas’s low voice caused him to look up and he took hold of the plates that Cas was holding out with one hand. In the other he wore an oven mitt which held the pie tin. The delicious aroma of apple and cinnamon filled the room as Cas sat down and set about cutting out a couple of slices. Despite his mouth watering at the smell of the pie, Dean forced himself to wait until Cas had taken a bite.
“Stay close,” Cas warned before Jack slipped off to a ball game next to the air hockey table that he was determined to win. He turned back to Dean who waved his air hockey goalie at him in a silent challenge. Cas smiled and waved at Dean to start, which left Dean biting back a smirk. He’d spent hours in this arcade first as a kid with Sam and then later when he’d come home with Charlie. And air hockey? This was a game he was awesome at.
He was grateful that Claire and Kaia chose that moment to arrive and he spent several minutes teasing Claire over her grease-stained plaid shirt before she pointed out that they were wearing similar outfits.
“Yeah, I’m a mechanic over at Singer’s Garage,” he explained. For some reason this made Cas frown and Dean suddenly felt wrong-footed. Surely Cas wouldn’t be a snob and look down on Dean for his job. An awkward silence fell and just as Cas was opening his mouth to say something Dean cut in. “I’ll see you later.”
“Oh well,” she said instead of pointing out any further how childish he’d been. This was why Charlie was his favourite, Dean thought. Sam would have continued to make Dean regret his actions and twist it until Dean felt guilty and obliged to apologize. Charlie just moved on.
‘Hey Ellen, something virgin for Alex here,” Dean called to the bar. Alex rolled her eyes, but accepted the brightly colored drink Ellen passed to her before moving off to a nearby table where Maggie and Kevin sat.
“I’m sorry for thinking you’d cheat,” he blurted out, and Cas turned to look at him. There was a small smile on his face that grew as he watched Dean turn red.
“I thought you and Kelly were married,” Dean said through gritted teeth. He stared down at his tea, unwilling to see the look of confusion on Cas’s face for a second longer.
“I can spare another minute,” Dean said quickly. Cas’s smile widened and Dean decided then that he had made the right decision. Cas led him to a nearby apartment door, saying over his shoulder how Jack must have been on his way home. He opened the door and entered the apartment, leaving the door open for Dean who slowly came in behind him. The space was neat and tidy. There were a lot of books and on a desk by the window lay a pile of notes beside a laptop. There was a large tv with a decent collection of movies and a small kitchen that came off the lounge area.
‘Right,’ he said and shuffled his feet, his body swaying away from Cas for a moment before he settled back next to Cas, closer than before so their arms now brushed. Cas cursed himself for holding the bag in his right arm as it restricted his ability to reach out to Dean now. He could move the bag but he figured too much movement may startle Dean into moving away. It always felt that way.
The moment his shirt was gone, Cas’s hands were on Dean, mapping out all the bare flesh in front of him. He gently squeezed his waist before he ran a hand up his chest until it brushed the edges of his tattoo. He didn’t hesitate before he leaned forward and pressed a kiss to the very centre of the anti-possession symbol. Dean gasped above him and Cas smiled before pressing his lips against his skin again. He slowly kissed his way up to Deans collarbone and gave it a gentle nip and then Dean’s hands were in his hair pulling him back up before he kissed him, hard and fast, leaving Cas panting.
“So, we’ve got a few people coming today, right Sam?” she asked and Dean’s hackles instantly went up. Charlie had never managed the art of being subtle when she wanted information. Sam looked confused as he shrugged.
It felt like a cold bucket of water had been dumped over Dean. He looked up in time to see a pretty brunette approach them. Dean recognized her instantly from the photo in Cas’s living space. Kelly.
Across the now crowded hallway the door to apartment 15 stood open for the first time in Dean’s memory. He had lived here for three years and had never seen anyone in there. But now he could make out a deep voice from within and he fought back a groan.
It's here!!! My fic for this year's Pinefest. I had so much fun finally bringing this story to life out of the murky recesses of my to-be-written list. A big thank you to my beta reader
“We got the drinks all ready,” he informed Dean. Even though Dean hadn’t felt like smiling, Jack cheered him up far too easily.
The pizza arrived in a timely manner and soon enough Dean found himself laughing at Jack’s antics as he insisted on dividing up the pizzas himself. A minor mishap involving melted cheese later they were settled down once more and Dean finally decided to breach the silence.
A quiet chuckle from his left caused him to look around. Jody was grinning around the lip of her beer bottle as she turned away.
‘Cas, Cas, Cas,’ Dean’s voice was breathy and wrecked and a shiver went down Cas’s spine. He pulled back long enough to take in Dean’s flushed face and hooded eyes before reality crashed over him and he groaned, leaning forward and resting his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“Mostly westerns, but I also like Vonnegut.” Castiel nodded encouragingly and Dean could feel his embarrassment leech away. In its place a small, warm kernel of pride took up residence in his chest and he sat up a bit straighter. “I also tried Tolstoy. Took me ages but I eventually got there.”
His bad mood followed him throughout the day, no matter how he tried to push it down. No one said anything at work, though Bess did watch him warily, and even Gordon kept his mouth shut during the day. Sam picked up on it when Dean came home that night, much to Dean’s regret. His head was pounding, a headache born from his constant internal flow of criticisms at himself, and he had no tolerance for any of Sam’s prodding.
Dean looked back over at the bathroom door and wondered why Cas hadn’t woken him up. It had taken a while but he’d convinced Cas to come to him if he had problems and the last couple times he’d had nightmares Dean had found the ex-angel knocking on his door in the middle of the night. And now he’d locked himself in another room without looking at Dean.
“Hey kiddo,” he said, looking down at the beaming boy. His blonde hair was a mess but his smile was blinding as he looked up at Dean.
He looked up when he heard footsteps and saw Cas approaching with his lunch and coffee. He smiled up at him and Cas’s answering smile calmed him more than he thought possible. He cast a thought towards his phone which he, after a moment of hesitation, locked and placed down on the table.
The box now in Castiel’s arms made more sense and Dean smiled, shifting the box slightly to ease the weight off his forearms.
“Yeah, she is,’ he said to his shoes before he looked up, his gaze fierce as it narrowed in on Dean. “As is Cas.”
“You’re welcome,” spoke a familiarly rough voice. Dean looked up to see the barista standing there, smiling at him with a plate in his hand. “Do you like cinnamon by any chance?”
Dorothy dropped onto a stool at the counter and pulled Charlie closer until the two were leaning against each other as they watched Dean attempt to save the bacon. By the time Dean had admitted defeat and scrapped the bacon, Charlie had snagged his coffee and had almost finished it.
“So the little man had to stay home?” Dean said as he turned away. The diner door swung open again behind him as he grabbed hold of a beer and twisted the cap off.
“Are you sure about letting Jack watch this? There is some fighting in it,” Dean asked in a low voice, and Cas frowned slightly.
“Why did you come back?” Cas asked quietly. His grip on Dean’s shoulder hadn’t lessened, and Dean leaned into it now, being careful not to disturb Jack.
Dean’s breath caught as Cas moved closer, his grip on Dean’s hands tightening until their knees were pressed together on the couch. He wanted to respond, but his tongue felt like it was too large for his mouth and the words wouldn’t come. The look in Cas’s eyes had effectively stolen his voice, and his words, gentle and sincere, left his heart pounding.
“I love pancakes,” he announced as he rushed into the kitchen. Dean saw Sam roll his eyes, but he moved away and let the subject drop much to Dean’s relief. Dean allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and let the sudden shock of seeing Cas again wash over him before he forced himself to push it all down and turn to the young boy who was looking at the pancake batter eagerly.
The afternoon flew by as he got into the rhythm, and with no other altercations between Benny and Gordon he started to relax and trust that the day was salvageable. In hindsight, he should have known better.
The final Monday before Christmas was hectic and despite knowing Cas wouldn’t be at the café, Dean needed to get away from the garage. He struggled through the bitterly cold streets that were full of last-minute shoppers before he finally reached the café. Inside was busy but Dean navigated his way through the throng expertly and waited in the queue, humming along with the Christmas music playing on the radio.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it, Dean.” Dean could feel his cheeks warming. “I thought it was perfect festive snack.”
He looked around and saw the exact moment Cas spotted him. The barista looked as if he was training someone new; a young girl with blonde hair twisted into a braid. She looked rather angry and resentful as Cas tried to explain something concerning the milk. He stopped talking, however, when he saw Dean and Dean knew he’d made the right decision in coming in today. A smile lit up Cas’s face that was clear from across the room and Dean smiled back. The young girl caught sight of this exchange and rolled her eyes.
“What am I? The news bulletin?” Dean turned back to the stove to avoid Sam’s eye, but he could still feel it on the side of his face. “You met them now, anyway, so what’s it matter whether I told you or not?”
“Gross, Dean,” Sam complained as he claimed his pizza box and grabbed one of the chairs next to Maggie. Despite liking pepperoni, she seemed determined to back Sam up in his devotion to the disgusting pizza. Dean could only shake his head at them while waving the uneaten half of his pizza slice in her direction. She rolled her eyes and pointedly took a slice of veggie pizza.
Cas lifted his hand to brush the hair off of Jack’s face. While Dean mourned the loss of Cas’s warmth on his arm he couldn’t help but ache at the look of unabashed love on Cas’s face.
Now that Cas was missing his coats, the layers Dean was wearing caused him to grumble until Dean reluctantly let go of Cas to return the favour, stripping his jacket and plaid shirt off but Cas’s hands were at the hem of shirt before he could pull him back in. He pulled the shirt up, his hands skimming Dean’s stomach which caused him to laugh. Cas glanced up, his hands pausing for a moment and looked at Dean. His hair was a mess and his lips were a dark red and swollen. His cheeks were flushed and he was smiling at Cas warmly causing Cas’s stomach to flip. He pushed at the shirt once more but Dean grabbed hold of his wrists with another laugh.
“Seriously, don’t worry,” Dean shrugged it off. “I didn’t exactly have a party planned or anything.”
There wasn’t much of a queue today and Dean was quickly being served. A glance out of the corner of his eye confirmed that the barista was back, his hair as messy as ever. Dean took a deep breath before turning to face the coffee machine.
“Sorry,” Cas whispered and Dean looked over at him quickly. He couldn’t read the expression on Cas’s face but Dean shook his head silently.
“I thought… last night…” Cas trailed off and Dean froze, casting his mind back as best as hecould. It was fuzzy at best, exhaustion smothering everything he could remember until it all slipped away into darkness. He could remember collapsing after a brief shower and he vaguely remembered something about mice. Everything after that became a blur though he had an odd feeling that something soft and warm had touched him.
They were silent for a long moment as Charlie watched Dean crack the eggs into the bowl and beat them with his handheld mixer and Dean refused to look up. He felt jittery, as though he’d been caught breaking one of his dad’s rules.
They worked in silence as they slowly swept the whole building. Dean was starting to worry that the cat may actually have slipped out onto the street and judging by the way Cas’s shoulders slumped, he suspected Cas was fearing the same. They went up that stairs to the next floor and Cas let out a startled noise. He took off down the hallway and Dean quickly followed. He rounded the corner in time to see Cas dropping to his knees. A small tabby cat trotted over to him and started purring when Cas started patting him. The noise it was producing was much louder than Dean had thought a cat it’s size could. He slowly approached them, smiling when he saw the cat leap into Cas’s arms. Cas slowly stood, cradling the cat against his chest. The cat looked rather smug, Dean thought.
“Shut up, I’m hilarious.”  But the cockiness melted away under the glare Sammy gave him.  “Come on, Sammy, it’s not a road trip without a little brotherly bickering.  Huh?”
An owl called ominously in the dark; Dena shivered.  “If you’re sure, we’ll break camp.  We’ve had a quiet few days since you left, everyone’s rested and fed and as healed as ever.”  Cas said nothing more, and presuming herself relieved of the watch, she busied herself by making more brew and packing all the provisions but a few biscuits for the others to eat on the march.  She pulled down a few garments cast on branches to dry and folded them into her own pack.  She debated dousing the fire and decided against it: Tracy would get a bit jumpy if she awoke in the dark.  No wonder, really, after what she’d been through.  Kidnapped by knockers, dragged into the mines, left down there to-.  Dena shuddered.  No, the fire stays lit.  Better to leave a false beacon anyway.  Maybe.
“Red-eye, black, and an americano, room for cream.”  While he waited for his total, Dean looked around at Castiel.  “Hey, are you sticking around?”
Upon her next letter to Miss Novak, Jo spills her concerns for him. Has Anna heard anything by way of explanation for the sudden departure of the Winchesters?
“Oh.  That,” Dean mumbled.  He fingered the thick pink scar running from his wrist to his elbow, and held out the matching one on his left arm.  “These cost me a month in a psych ward.  You can’t ever tell Sammy, though; I told him it was an accident in the salvage yard.”  Cas frowned, his baby blue puppy-dog eyes boring into Dean’s soul.  “I don’t know if I was actually trying to kill myself; I really don’t remember.  But apparently I called Benny at some point, because he broke into my apartment and found me before I-  He said I was drunker than he’d ever seen me, and that’s saying something.”  He chuckled, a dark, sad sound.  Cas stayed silent.  Dean really didn’t want to talk about this, but there was Cas, just
She gave a half-smile and threw her hands up in surrender.  She dug out a small tumbler and reached over her head for a bottle.  “‘Fine.’  I get it.  I can’t fix what ain’t broken, but a finger or two of this’ll take some of the pucker off that puss.”  She slid it to Dean.  “On me, hon.”  She winked at Cas with a cryptic nod towards Dean.
Suddenly feeling much warmer, Dean made his way to an available table at the back. He watched everyone moving around for a long moment before he felt the urge to pull out his phone. He glanced over at the coffee machine once more as he waited for twitter to load but didn’t catch the barista’s eye again.
“You need to hit it harder,” Dean explained, and Cas frowned at him. “Like this.” He hit it back to Cas and watched as the other man followed his example. “See,” he smiled. “Just like that.”
They both headed towards the staircase, bypassing the still broken elevator completely. They descended in silence as Dean desperately tried to think of something to say, but his thoughts were scattered as Cas’s elbow kept brushing his. He finally figured that, as lame as discussing work was, it would be better than this silence when Cas spoke first.
Cas agreed, and they set off. It took Dean almost the length of the first block to realize that they were both still holding Jack’s hands. He looked over at Cas who had been noticeably quiet, but Dean couldn’t think of anything to say to break the sudden awkward silence that hung over them. Thankfully, Jack didn’t seem aware of this and began babbling about the flowers. He stopped to pick some more, finally letting go of Dean’s hand as he bent down by the same patch of weeds as yesterday, and when he straightened and held out his findings Dean didn’t bother arguing with him. Cas raised an eyebrow when Dean, without thinking, put the weed behind his ear. Dean flushed, realizing what he’d done and reached up to take it down but a warm hand on his wrist stopped him.
“Oh, hi Jack,” he said. Disappointment crashed over him and he knew the smile he aimed at the boy probably looked as fake as it felt.
The next day went smoother than Dean was expecting. Donna was back at work, and Dean didn’t even bother to stop himself from hugging her. Ash’s friend Andy rocked up during Dean’s lunch break and explained how his contact was actually his old workplace that owed him. Dean finally caved when he glanced at the pile of papers that covered Bess’s desk, and Andy agreed to swing by later that week to install it.
They wandered back to the apartment building as Cas mentioned to Dean how different Sioux Falls was to Chicago.
“Bad dreams, maybe?” Sam asked, lowering his voice even further and Dean looked around at him. Ever since Cas had fallen his nights had been far from peaceful. While he managed a few hours of sleep a night, about four nights a week he’d wake abruptly due to bad dreams and be unable to go back to sleep. At first he’d refused to discuss what it was he saw in those dreams but after a particularly bad night Dean had found him in the kitchen and slowly Cas had caved and told him a little of what he’d dreamt. A tense, halting conversation where Cas sat on the edge of his seat later and slowly Dean had put together an idea; a thousand dead, familiar bodies and a blank mind.
“The decent coffee I promised,” he said holding it out. Dean took it and under Cas’s watchful eye, took a sip.
“Why?” Jack asked and Dean looked over to see them both looking at him with almost identical confused frowns on their faces. He quickly swallowed down the feeling that threatened to rise out of his chest and spill out of his mouth.
Jack shuffled over so Dean could sit down next to him and he did, feeling a twinge of regret that Jack was in the middle. Ignoring that, he picked up the remote as Cas started handing out their dinner. Jack took his container of wontons with glee while Dean immediately fished out a mushroom dumpling. He would never admit it to Sam, but the mushroom ones were actually his favorites. He knew if his brother ever found out he would have to deal with Sam repaying him for all the comments Dean had ever made about his rabbit food diet. Cas, on the other hand, had looked eager to try them when Dean had sheepishly mentioned them.
Dean stared at him, unable to think of anything to say in the face of such blunt honesty. Cas continued to stare at him, but his cheeks were slowly darkening.
“Apparently the movers' workday was over and so they left half an hour ago,” Castiel explained. Dean frowned as they made their way back into the main room.
He waved as he left and Dean raised his hand, still holding the spatula, to respond but Cas was already gone and now there was pancake batter on the floor.
So, it was with a steadily increasing headache that Dean pulled into the parking lot of his apartment building thinking only of a hot shower, a beer, and dinner. In whatever order they presented themselves. He let his baby idle for a moment before he shut off her engine and, ignoring the ache in his legs, forced himself to get out of the car. It was thankfully only a short walk to the entrance of the building, and he had started to relax and allow himself to think of the shower that awaited him four floors above him when he saw a sign that caused his mood to plummet once more.
“Yeah, but that was on Benny’s shitty X-box. You have a way better system on which I will destroy you.”
“Dad says that weeds are flowers that people judge,” he argued, causing Sam to laugh once more. Dean felt his own argument waver. Looking down into the little boys face he couldn’t help but think of Cas the other night. Unlike most people Dean met, Cas didn’t seem to judge him as merely a dumb mechanic. Dean sometimes thought even his own brother assumed Dean wasn’t that smart, and maybe that was partially Dean’s fault for hiding his own interests for so long, but the fact that Cas had never made those assumptions had warmed Dean up to the guy a lot faster than he thought possible.
“Look, Andy wouldn’t screw me over,” he said, leaning forward slightly. “He’s a good guy and he has a lot of connections.”
“I –” Dean’s throat was too dry, even if he could find the words he doubted he’d be able to actually spit them out. Something along those lines must have registered in his face because Cas’s expression softened with sympathy and then, slowly, he lifted his hand until his fingers were brushing the back of Dean’s hand.
. Dean had been too busy to check his phone as he’d rushed to get ready for work, cursing how cold the morning was and dreading just how chilly the garage was going to be. As such, it wasn’t until his lunch break that afternoon that he actually saw it.
Later that night, as Dean lay in bed texting Cas goodnight, he thought what he’d tweeted wasn’t a lie. It truly had been the best Christmas he’d had in a very long time. Easily the best Christmas, he thought, his lips still tingling hours later from Cas’s kisses. Even if the goat was still standing.
Thankfully, Sam was unaware of what had occurred. His brother had been so wrapped up in preparing for the return of classes for his second year of law school and his shifts at a local bar that he hadn’t even noticed that they had new neighbors. Which was good. Dean wouldn’t have to put up with Sam’s crusade of neighborly gestures nor the bitch faces his brother would send him when Dean begged off those same neighborly gestures. It was bad enough that he had to put up with Charlie’s teasing when he’d explained the situation to her. He definitely didn’t need his moose of a brother chiming in.
“How about we leave the decorating until tomorrow?” Cas asked but Jack didn’t relinquish his grip on the frame.
“No,” Cas reached out and grabbed his arm. Even through the several layers Dean was wearing he could feel the warmth of Cas’s hand. “I told you alright but I’ll say it again. You’re not dumb. You were just working with different information.”
Cas let go of the ascot and wrapped a hand around the back of Dean’s neck while his other hand gripped his shoulder. He wasn’t sure how long they stood there, lips moving against one another’s until Cas dared to part his lips and press harder against Dean. Heat was building in his stomach and it only deepened when Dean’s lips parted.
They began to descend the stairs and, after a brief explanation to Dean, they began to lift Jack up on every second step. He cheered each time they did it. By the time they arrived in the lobby Dean was breathless and his arm ached a bit, but there was a smile that was threatening to become permanent on his face.
“To not die, Cas,” Dean responded to his latest question with a grin as, with a final blow, Cas’s avatar died. Cas’s answering smile was bemused, but he still appeared to be entertained. The pizza boxes had migrated to the floor as they were emptied, and the one that had rested between Dean and Cas had long since joined the pile. The space between them had disappeared quickly as Cas leaned in until they sat with their shoulders brushing whenever one of them moved. Dean was trying not to focus on how close Cas was, but it was very difficult when he was smiling at Dean like that.
As he entered the garage, his coffee already half-gone, Dean felt his phone buzz. He managed to pull it out of his pocket after a moment of fumbling and he felt a grin tug at his lips when he saw what it was.
“I think I understand now,” Cas said with a small smile. Dean tried to distract himself by focusing on the game at hand and hit the puck hard down the table, watching gleefully as it slid past Cas’s hand and into the goal. He danced on the spot for a moment, the way he did when he played against Charlie, before remembering that it was definitely not Charlie currently watching him. He looked over in time to see Cas biting back a smile and he felt his cheeks heat up.
None of that, however, was what finally convinced Dean to see the night through. It was the memory of surprise on Cas’s face when Dean had given him the nickname, as though he’d never had a friend before. Despite everything that Dean had gone through he’d always had a friend he could turn to. He couldn’t imagine not having that support. And that’s all this was. Two friends hanging out. Hell, Sam would probably be there, too.
At five thirty Dean was doing a final sweep of the service area when Bess suddenly called out to him, and he rushed into the foyer to find the ancient computer that he had been meaning to replace had finally given up.
Jack started fidgeting not too long after that, and Sam quickly suggested a walk over to the nearby bakery. It was technically too early for lunch, but Jack’s face lit up and he rushed over to the door which led Dean little choice but to follow.
‘Cas, what? What is it?’ Dean’s voice rose with worry and his arms tightened around Cas, holding him rather than clinging to him though. They were both breathing heavily and Cas waited until his breathing was back under control, trying to ignore how badly he wanted to continue and instead he pulled back to glare at Dean.
“Can I have that?” Cas’s voice broke through Dean’s doze and he jerked awake and blinked around blearily until he saw Cas gesturing to the remote by Dean’s side.
Dean’s stomach roiled, and he felt as though he would be sick at the gratitude on her face. Not even a two minutes ago he’d been lusting over her husband and now she was thanking him for looking after him.
“It was nothing, Cas,” he said, his voice a bit gruffer than he’d intended. It didn’t seem to bother Cas, though Sam looked at him oddly.
“Some stuck-up prick who can’t allow anyone to find joy in a Christmas tradition,’ he said shortly. Dorothy leaned over to look at Charlie’s phone and suddenly laughed.
“Well, Cas suits you,” he said impulsively. For a moment he thought he might have crossed a line but then a bright, gummy smile lit up Cas’s face. Dean smiled even as his chest tightened.
At first it was gentle, just a press of their lips, but then Cas inhaled deeply and Dean found himself being kissed within an inch of his life. Cas had one hand on the back of Dean’s neck and the other gripping his shoulder tightly, pulling him in until Dean was practically in Cas’s lap.
“What do you read?” Castiel asked. Dean looked over and could practically see the enthusiasm radiating off him. Yeah, Dean could see how he would be a great librarian.
“I’m sorry,” Cas said in a rush as Dean looked up at him. “Patience was unavailable and I didn’t have anyone else to call. I considered cancelling but…” His voice trailed away and Dean’s traitorous heart gave a particularly hard thump at the hopeful look in Cas’s eyes.
A group of women sitting nearby cast him a dark look which Dean returned as he hastily made his way to the counter.
They didn’t speak again aside from occasional comments from Jack until Obi Wan and Luke entered a bar looking for a pilot. Dean sat up straighter and could feel a smile already tugging at his lips.
Dean cast a quick look over at Castiel, but the other man was frowning in concentration as he listened to whatever the person at the pizza place was saying. He knelt down so that his face was level with Jack’s. The boy was still staring at him.
He went to bed early that night, dreading the party the next day, but found he couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t quiet his thoughts and there was a loud banging out in the hallway. He considered getting up to investigate but it passed after a couple of minutes and soon everything was silent once more. He lay there for a long time, staring sightlessly in the dark. His chest ached, and he refused to think on why. It was bad enough how empty the bed felt beside him.
‘You better,” Ellen warned before moving back to the bar. There was a sense of awkwardness in the air which Charlie quickly broke by teasing Sam about Eileen. Dean felt a rush of gratitude toward her as he tried to collect himself. Today was about Sam, he reminded himself.
“Freak,” Dean called out to his retreating back. After sparing a moment to put a record on Dean set about cleaning up the dishes from their breakfast. He took his time, allowing himself the time to continue his moping without anyone around to judge him. It was only once the counter practically sparkled that Dean shook himself out of his funk and turned his attention to the cake.
Cas fell silent at that and Dean, his heart aching, leaned in further. He could sense there was more that Cas wanted to say, but he honestly didn’t know how much more he could take. Cas’s voice had become softer than ever before, and Dean felt as if he was about to come flying apart at the seams, his heart racing ridiculously fast for someone who was merely sitting down and holding hands.
“Yes. When the others left, he was upset. Like how I get when I’m really sleepy. He’s not upset now.”
Another week passed before Dean was forced to confront his growing feelings for Cas. He woke most mornings reaching across the bed as the ghost of a warm mouth and hands faded from his mind before he rather grumpily began his day, often casting a look at the door across the hall as he walked past. He honestly didn’t know if he wanted the door to open or not, but every time it didn’t he was left with a pit of dread and disappointment building in his gut. The anticipation was killing him.
“Oh, this just gets better and better,” Dean muttered. He looked around just as Jo arrived with his burger and a raised eyebrow.
Sam shut his eyes and took a deep breath before looking in Dean’s direction. The woman followed his gaze and glanced between Sam and Dean.
Once they were settled under the blankets, Dean twisted onto his side and reached out to catch Cas’s hand in his once more. He could just make out Cas’s face in the dark and he could no longer resist, not with Cas so close and warm and inviting. Dean shuffled forward so he could lean in to kiss him but his aim was off and he caught the corner of Cas’s lips instead and Cas laughed, his chest shaking and his lips pulled upward and Dean could feel Cas’s smile against his cheek.
The puck flew back and forth between them for a bit before Cas suddenly hit the puck sharply and it spun past Dean’s hand and into the goal. He looked up in surprise and saw the smug smirk that flashed across Cas’s face and understanding hit him.
“I wasn’t able to finish today’s report,” she explained while Dean dragged the monitor forward to check the cables at the back. After a few minutes, Dean bit back a curse and leant back in the desk chair.
Cas looked up at him then, his face still unreadable as he stared at Dean in silence. “I called you sweetheart and fell back asleep. That’s why you’ve been so quiet today.”
It was only after the crowd dispersed that Dean realised he’d forgotten to ask for his coffee to go. He sank back in his seat as he realised he was going to have to chug his coffee, probably burning himself in the process before fleeing.
“Another thing my dad and I disagreed about,” he admitted, looking down. To his surprise, Cas reached out and took Dean’s free hand in his own. Dean stared down at their hands as Cas’s long fingers wrapped around his own.
“Yeah, just running late. This could be them now.” Jody looked over as the door swung open again and Dean turned to look, a snarky remark about Claire’s latest look ready, but he froze when he saw Cas come through the door instead. That familiar pair of blue eyes swept over the room before settling on Dean. A warm smile lit up Cas’s face, and Dean felt an answering smile curve his lips without his permission.
Despite the rather boring nature of their job, Dean found himself having fun as he and Castiel carried boxes into the apartment where Jack stood on the couch and directed them to the different rooms. Aside from being cute Jack seemed to be determined to win Dean over and bounced around him. At first, he’d been mostly silent but by the time they were done he was jabbering away about the long drive he had mostly slept through that morning and the pigeons he’d spotted during the lunch break. Dean bit back a laugh as Jack, now starting to flag a little, started chattering about how excited he was to make friends at his new pre-school.
“Alright, alright, we get it,” Jo said, stretching her arms above her. “Leave the lovebirds alone.” Charlie and Maggie giggled and Dean felt his flush deepen. Even the back of his neck felt like it was burning. He avoided everyone else’s gazes as he got to his feet and picked up the empty beer bottles around the room. He refused to look in Cas’s direction, scared of what expression he would find on his face. Best case scenario would be innocent puzzlement, worse case scenario… Dean honestly didn’t know. What was worse, disgust or interest?
‘The ascot,’ he nodded at it and Dean’s hand fell away as though it had been electrocuted. ‘It suits you,’ he repeated as the silence lingered for too long and for a moment Cas could have sworn that Dean’s cheeks darkened but then he moved, turning away from Cas and walking towards the television.
Stevie looked amused by her girlfriend's antics, though ultimately chose not to join in. She winked at Dean as she passed him and said, “Are we expecting a certain blue-eyed cutie to show up?”
“A flower for you,” he announced, and Dean was left with no choice but to accept it. He looked down at the we—alright, flower, in his hand and wondered what he was supposed to do with it now. Jack seemed only too happy to help him out there, though. “Like this,” he said before pushing another bruised flower behind his own ear. He smiled and stared expectantly up at Dean.
Cas paused and stared at Dean for a moment before nodding, as if in agreement. “Will we see you tomorrow?”
The couch cushion hit Sam in the back, and he whirled around, indignation causing his face to flush. Serves him right, Dean thought savagely as he reached for the second cushion.
“I – yes,” he managed to say before Cas’s answering smile blinded him. He stumbled forward as Cas tugged him into his room, the door closing behind them with a gentle click. The air suddenly seemed heavier, the room smaller and Dean couldn’t meet Cas’s eyes anymore. He felt as if he couldn’t breathe and he tightened his grip on Cas’s hand, trusting Cas to not let him go.
“Dean!” He waved cheerfully with the hand that Cas wasn’t holding, and Dean felt a reluctant smile pulling at his mouth.
He could hear Cas moving around the kitchen; the slight squeal of the oven door that he kept forgetting to oil, the rattle of a draw and the slight clink of plates. Dean looked down at Jack once more and felt a small smile pull at the corners of his mouth as he listened to Cas. The boy’s mouth had parted as he slept, and his eyelids flickered as he dreamt. Dean’s chest warmed as though something molten was running through his veins, filling his heart until it felt like his chest was going to burst open.
“You didn’t,” he almost shouted and Cas stopped. He didn’t turn around but considering the circumstances Dean couldn’t really blame him. He was just happy that Cas had stopped. “I was just surprised.” His voice was still strained but at least he’d managed to get it back to a normal volume.
She held out a hand and Dean moved automatically, shaking it despite how blank his mind had become. She had a pretty smile, and he could see the resemblance between her and Jack. She moved back to Cas’s side as Jack detached himself from Dean’s leg. They made the perfect family picture, Dean thought. Cas had turned to look down at Kelly, offering to get her a drink while Jack bounced next to them, beaming up at the sight of his parents reunited.
“I’ve never been good at baking or cooking,” Cas admitted. Dean let himself look over at him, and Cas shrugged with a small, rather self-deprecating smile twisting his lips. Dean wanted to smooth it away but forced himself to be still. “I’m not very good at following instructions.”
Cas watched him with a fond look on his face before he joined him. He slowly slid under the blanket and for a moment they lay still before Dean hesitantly reached out and took hold of Cas’s hand.
The café itself was half full despite Dean having arrived at the tail end of the lunch rush. He quickly joined the queue and then pulled out his phone. Amongst a calendar reminder, a message from Charlie about their upcoming Star Wars night and a message from Sam, there it was. He grinned before stepping forward to place his order.
“You look like crap,” he said bluntly, too tired to care and a part of him wanted to get a reaction out of Cas. His face twitched as though fighting back a scowl and then the moment passed. Instead, he tilted his head slightly and stared at Dean with more curiosity than before. It was quiet between them for a long moment and Dean shifted, starting to feel uncomfortable.
“Aren’t you?” he asked and he took a step backwards, towards his room where his bed was still visible through the doorway, without letting go of Dean’s hand.
“My brother calls me Cassie sometimes to be annoying, which is his primary character trait, but other than him no.”
It must have been a couple of hours later when he was jostled by someone moving his feet which pulled him sharply out of his oddly blurred dreams, something warm and soft beneath his fingers and a blur of blue that was painfully familiar. He jerked to the side, away from whoever was looming by the side of his bed, his hands immediately searching for his gun but he stilled when Cas’s voice broke the silence.
Friday arrived in a whirl of nerves and anticipation. Dean had spent Thursday night baking snacks in advance for Cas, trying to bury his anxiety under a pile of sugary confections. By the time he was done he had a delicious looking apple pie to share with Cas as well a plate full of lemon meringue cupcakes.
“No problem,” he managed to get out. He stared at Cas for a long moment and found his gaze slipping, almost unconsciously, down to Cas’s lips. They looked soft and inviting, and it took a lot for Dean to drag his gaze back up to Cas’s eyes. He wasn’t sure but it seemed as though Cas’s eyes had widened a little, and his smile fell away. Dean swallowed harshly and gestured wildly towards his apartment.
“You ready to tell me what all of this is about?” she asked, and Dean hesitated. He knew, logically, that he could tell Charlie and that she wouldn’t judge him, but the familiar guilt and shame that he’d live with for years had returned to strangle him, and he forced a smile that felt fake.
“So, what happened with all the boxes?” Dean asked, desperately searching for a change of subject. The warm flash of interest that was heating up his cheeks and stomach might have been pleasant in any other situation but for the problem that one, he barely knew Castiel, and while that might not have generally been a problem for Dean, if they were going to be neighbors it probably wasn’t a good idea to hook up and go separate ways awkwardly in a few days. Secondly, Castiel’s child was still bouncing around in the doorway.
By the time Dean had left his apartment for work on Monday morning it had been a full ten hours since he’d followed beewatcher back. He wasn’t sure what they were really doing but after listening to the last song beewatcher had sent him, he’d been unable to stop smiling for a full minute. The smiley face beewatcher had sent him left Dean feeling giddy for a moment before he’d laughed at himself. A bloody emoji and he was smiling and blushing like a twelve-year-old. This was getting out of hand.
As if he noticed Cas’s eyes Dean shifted on the spot nervously, one hand reaching up to tug at the material as though to pull it off. His gaze fell away from Cas’s face and instead was fixed on the two recliners in front of the mess that once had been a television.
It was only when Jack suddenly leapt to his feet and bounded back over to them with what looked like a heavy frame in his hands that they shifted. Cas leaned forward to see what his son had found, and Dean twisted to the side slightly so he could face them both.
Suddenly a hand caught his arm and spun him around. Dean’s head snapped up only to see the barista standing in front of him. Dean froze, staring at the other man who held up his hand.
It was quickly decided that they were done with the park and Jack was eager to see the rest of the town. Dean led them out of the park and, after ensuring that Jack was holding onto their hands once more, they set off for the center of town. Dean showed them the main shopping strip, complete with a bookstore for Cas and the Roadhouse. He could see Jo in the window, but he ducked his head and hoped that for once luck would be on his side. The last thing he needed was this getting back to Charlie. He steered them across the road and pointed out the way to his garage before they stumbled across an old building that looked as if it had seen better days.
Dean glanced down and after a moment, he turned his hand. Cas wasn’t moving, waiting for Dean to make the choice. Dean took a deep breath and, without looking up at Cas, he reached out and slowly slipped his fingers in between Cas’s, bringing their palms together. A long moment passed and then Cas squeezed Dean’s hand gently and Dean felt his shoulders relax. He glanced up and found Cas watching him, something painfully vulnerable in his face. He hated seeing it there – the idea that Cas could be scared of Dean, of what he could do to Cas was too much – and so he did the only thing he could think of in order to get rid of it and reassure Cas. He tightened his grip and squeezed Cas’s hand.
An hour later they’d finally persuaded Jack to leave the playground after chasing after him and an embarrassing minute where Dean attempted to go after him on the play equipment itself. He managed to free himself from the tunnel while Sam almost collapsed from laughing too hard. The bright side of this was Jack appeared to have finally worn himself out and Sam actually carried him back to the apartment.
“Nothing,” Sam said, raising his hands in surrender. “I was just wondering when you were going to tell me we had new neighbors.”
‘Slow down there, cowboy,’ he said, his smile widening and Cas sighed. With a bright grin Dean let go and reached up to where the ascot was still tied, the fabric now creased from Cas’s grip, and he pulled it away, letting the material float to the floor where the rest of their clothing lay. Dean then shot Cas a grin before leaning in and giving him a quick kiss, enough to melt away Cas’s frown. He then reached down and squeezed Cas’s hands before he grabbed his shirt and pulled it off.
The waiter was in fact the barista and was currently focused on the list of orders in front of him. He was frowning in concentration and Dean couldn’t stop himself from smiling at the sight. The man’s hair was just as messy as last week as if he’d been running his hands through it. Dean watched him work for a long moment, wondering if his hair was as soft as it looked and if he could mess it up even more when a polite cough interrupted his thinking. He looked around to see it was the red headed waitress who was grinning at him with his lunch order in her hands. Dean felt his face flush as she placed it in front of him.
What was also ridiculous was how embarrassed Dean still was over the events at the coffee shop. He’d decided that he’d go back for a coffee today and apologize for acting like an idiot to the stupidly hot barista and then leave. Then he could get over himself and actually eat lunch without making what was probably stupid cow eyes at the man.
Dean quickly saved the photo before flicking over to his messages. He replied to Charlie first, confirming his availability for tomorrow nights Star Wars event. He then clicked on Sam’s name and, having ignored his brothers demand for Dean to return his Harry Potter book, Dean quickly attached the photo and began compiling a brief message.
“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable,” he said, his words cold and stiff and Dean scrambled for something to say, something to fix this as Cas turned away.
Everyone else was starting to settle down around the living room with their pizzas and beer and Dean snagged the box with the bacon supreme in it and turned around to find Cas right behind him with two beers in hand. Silently he held one out for Dean to take.
“What are you doing up this early?” Sam asked blearily. He pushed his overgrown hair behind his ears as he eyed the plates Dean had just served up. Dean fought back the urge to offer him a pair of scissors.
He ordered his lunch before snagging a table near the window where he pulled out his phone. He cast a glance around the café, scrumptiously trying to spot the waiter from last week. For a moment Dean didn’t think he was here as he could only see two waitresses moving amongst the tables, including the red head. He then heard a bell and turned to where the coffee machine stood. And there he was.
“So where are you from, Cas?” Charlie asked from her spot on the couch. She was jammed in the middle, with Stevie’s arm around her shoulders and Jo sprawled out on her other side. Benny, Sam and Maggie had commandeered the chairs from around the table, and while Sam set up the first game of the evening the others all turned to look at Cas.
“And there’s Mariah,” he said softly, glancing back at Dean who felt as if the ground had fallen away from him. His fingers twitched towards his phone and he pulled it close before suddenly leaping to his feet.
“If that’s your thing,” he said stiffly, his head lowered as he sifted flour into the bowl. Charlie hummed behind him, and when he looked up to grab the eggs he found her staring at him with a shrewd look on her face. Dean’s stomach jolted unpleasantly as though he’d missed a step going downstairs.
Jack insisted on trying to play a mini basketball game, which he consistently lost at until Cas shepherded him and his teary eyes over to an air hockey table. Dean pretended to play badly as Cas held Jack up so the young boy could aim properly until he tired of winning.
And attached to the post, as was customary, was a full audio clip of Michael Bublé’s ‘Cold December Night’.
“I’d like that,” was all he said, but Dean’s stomach flipped at the uncharacteristically shy expression on Cas’s face.
Christmas Eve dawned white and cold and Dean wondered if they would indeed receive a white Christmas. His thoughts drifted to his phone but he chose to ignore it until lunch time. When his break rolled around he left the garage determined. He’d regretted leaving yesterday but he’d needed time to wrap his mind around beewatcher and Cas. But now he was eager to get back to the café. He turned around the corner and saw the building up ahead but was startled to the twinkling fairy lights in the window display were turned off. His heart plummeted in his chest but he forced himself onward.
“You study?” Dean asked slowly and Cas looked up from his lunch. Dean couldn’t place the expression he was wearing but there was something careful in the way he looked at Dean and Dean’s heart thudded.
“Good job, kiddo,” he said, ruffling Jack’s hair as he walked past. He paused after a few steps, realizing what he’d done, but when he looked over he saw Jack beaming up at him. Cas’s lips were also turned up. “You ready to watch Star Wars?” he asked instead.
