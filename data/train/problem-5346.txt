“I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Afterwards, Forrest teaches him how to dumpster dive.
am? I listen to you because I trust you. I care about you.”
“Great! It’s next Sunday at four. I hope to see you there,” Neal said. “I gotta run, gotta pick my daughter up from gymnastics. Dean, I’ll catch you later?”
Cas spreads his hands. “Either the other side is gearing up for a massive attack, or they’re finally getting ready to admit defeat.”
She reaches into her pocket and tosses something across the room. Dean catches it without thinking and opens his hand: Hex bag.
He hooks Cas by the waist suddenly, making him trip closer and catch himself on Dean’s chest. For the first time, Cas cracks a smile.
Only Cas could raise his head that slowly, look that beaten up and still give Dean an unimpressed glare.
“Very ready,” Cas declares. And like it’s nothing, he steps closer and kisses Dean softly under the morning sun.
Cas pulls his hoodie closed, hugging his arms around himself. “Charlie turned the thermostat on full blast.”
Cas shrugs. He opens his mouth to tell her it’s OK, to drop the subject and go back to the show, but something has him turning toward her before he can stop it and folding one of his legs beneath himself on the couch.
When Mrs. Olsen woke up, she swore she didn’t remember anything.
He ignores him. Cas and Miracle look at each other and creep to the end of the hall, where they can hear Dean at the front door, talking to someone—arguing. When it doesn’t abate after a minute, Cas tells the dog to stay quiet and follows him up the stairs.
“Dean!”
Dean looks at him and takes a slow, shuddering breath. His shoulder nudges Cas’s when he sits back, the line of his back curving as he leans against the bar. Perhaps Dean’s simply not the hand-holding type; his fingers brush up Cas’s slow and trails his wrist on their way to settle on the back of his neck. His thumb trails up past his hairline when his hand splays and squeezes. A strange feeling is settling in Cas’s chest, warm and new. It burrows out a nest in his heart and makes a home.
“There wasn’t that much room inside.”
“What’s up? You’re up and at it early today,” Neal said.
He leans in an inch closer, presumably to drive home his glare. Then he blips out. Dean slumps against the wall, breathing harder, as soon as the grip on his lapels vanishes.
,” Cas snarls, and Dean’s hand is there on his shoulder lightning-fast.
“Me and Bobby get sick of each other,” says Dean. “We talked...uh, the whole time.”
“I don’t want you to. I’m very busy, Dean, and I have more important things to do than come flying down here every time you stub your toe.” Staring right at him, Cas spears another cut of steak on his fork, eats it. “But if I’m already here, then there’s no shame in asking me for my help.”
too serious with his fantasy roleplaying—our LARP thing,” Dean clarifies, noticing the mystified look on Cas’s face. He takes Cas’s joint, angles Cas’s face toward him and presses over onto Cas’s pillow to breathe his smoke back into Cas’s mouth. Smiling, apparently pleased, Dean kisses him softly.
“Of course not,” Dean says impatiently, “but at least your brothers and sisters don’t have a clear shot to kill you. No, it’s better that you’re safe at home.”
“Is this pot? Are you growing pot?” Dean demands.
“I know you do. It’s—Never mind.”
“I don’t think of it like that,” Cas says, tilting his head. “Making time for you matters. You’re important to me, Dean.”
“Cas is...special,” Dean offers. He touches Cas’s leg. “Not to mention being very
“They make fuzzy penguins now, Dean. Evolution is incredible.”
“That wasn’t real, Dean,” he says carefully.
Lisa’s gaze lingers on him for a second—just a beat, barely noticeable at all.
“You know what,” Dean whispers, while Cas is squeezing his hand and eagerly learning trivia about snow leopards, “maybe you
They look at each other for a long minute. He wishes he could parse the look on her face.
Charlie’s putting nachos in the oven when Cas returns to the living room and its connected kitchenette. She flips the TV to some show that, from what Cas can easily surmise, features a beautiful woman in tight clothing who fights demons in the South.
He cannot believe he let this guy live in his house without ever watching a wrestling match. He wants to take him to watch a real one someday, maybe when Gunner Lawless is back in the nearby circuits. Cas should only see the best of the best. But at least Dean can pop his cherry with some classic reruns.
“But Dean—”
“How would you feel about taking a trip to Wichita?”
Dean nearly falls asleep on the couch. One minute he’s engaged in a lengthy backstory about Harrison Ford, although he’s yawning through it, and the next he blinks and Leia’s in a completely different outfit. Dean sits up straighter, rubbing his eyes.
Dean reties the string on the fraying
will make me feel better,” he says, scowling. “This is what I do, Lisa. It’s who I am.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean mutters, and goes to rescue his man from the mind-boggling human phenomenon that is an Elvis Presley record.)
Cas’s laughter is the only thing more robust than his silence.
Benny unties the couple while Dean and Cas fan out to hold the perimeter. The cannibal demon finds them minutes later (“Which came first?” Dean jokes while they’re dodging a series of psychic attacks with the goal of getting Cas close enough to burn the motherfucker out of his body, “The freak or the freakier?” Cas does not find this amusing.) and puts up a hell of a fight. Every time Cas feints, Dean sees him clutch a hand to his lacerated ribs. The demon teases Dean about missing him at the A-list parties down in Hell and while he’s getting his jabs in, laughing at the stricken look on Dean’s face, Benny tackles him from behind and slices his head clean off. While the decapitated demon is gasping on the floor, Cas stalks over and puts his hand to the vessel’s face. When he’s done, there are two large black holes where his eye sockets used to be.
For his part, the kid seems really psyched that Dean’s there at all. He sits right next to him at the table, edging out Castiel, who shoots Ben little glares while he’s sighing his way around to sit across from him instead. Dean nudges Cas’s foot when he sits down.
“Stop it!” Sam shouts. “No! Stop it. No.”
She touches his cheek. He leans into it for a second, so shortly that she might not notice at all.
to. He’s seen Cas try to manipulate people, it doesn’t work. He’s very blunt. With Dean, very unapologetic. If he wanted to torture monsters, he’d try to make Dean understand first—or just tell him to piss off, in his own lily-white, rude but proper way.
In the meantime, Dean’s house blooms. It gets its first coat of paint a little under a month later; it’s a dark, respectable stain that Dean thinks gives it a lot of character. He hustles pool for the money to trick out his router like he promised Cas, and those earnings leave a little bit left over for furniture too. A decent paycheck plus bar scams is still not particularly sufficient to cover all of his renovations, but he’s making progress piece by piece.
Cas’s big eyes flick up to look at him again, wide and blue even in the dark. He doesn’t smell like Jimmy Novak’s cologne anymore, but he does smell like Dean’s aftershave and his own favorite brand of citrus and honey bar soap that he packed for the road trip. It makes for an interesting blend. His cheeks are flushed, Dean can see it now that Cas is out of direct moonlight.
“For me to, uh...show up uninvited,” he explains, stepping back in his eyeline and right into his space.
“I’m fine.” But he has to take a few deep breaths, just to remind himself that he can again. “Thanks for the rescue.”
“What, me and—?” Dean busts out laughing. “No way, Cas, it wasn’t like that! It—Lisa and I are just
Cas sighs, looking down at his hands twisting together on his lap as he tries to find the words.
Dean grabs Cas’s other side to help the woman supporting him, who looks like she’s straining after all this time. She glances at Dean’s face and starts muttering faster.
He gets up and starts pulling open closets at random. Honestly, he has no idea where anything is in this whole bunker if it’s not his bedroom, the kitchen or the bathroom. Nowadays he barely even spends time in the library unless they’re working a case, although Dean hasn’t been taking a lot of those lately either. He doesn’t want to venture too far from the bunker anymore, because of Sam.
“Movie,” he counters. “I don’t have time to watch you run through all your worst pickup lines with every poor woman at the bar.”
“Hey,” he calls.
Cas digests this frowning into his beer. He comes to see the fallen angels as beneficial—in this instance—and looks up with his stance resolved.
“I...I’m sorry,” he says, confused. He didn’t expect Dean to say something relevant. Where’s his righteous indignation now? “I’ve been distracted…”
He freezes. Sets the whiskey bottle down. That’s a voice that he hasn’t heard in a very, very long time.
“Cas says it’s cool if I join you guys,” Dean says. Cas carefully does not look at Charlie, whom he can feel looking at him.
Then Anna Milton’s face looms suddenly out of the dark. She appears so suddenly that Dean sways, pulling up short.
sign erected beside where Dean parked the car. It illuminates his cheek, his jaw, his pretty eyes as the moon shifts in and out from between the clouds, and Dean is caught up briefly in how blue they look—like diamonds, shining. He knows it’s just a trick of the light but he can’t help pulling Cas’s shoulder until he shuffles in, close enough for them to share breath on the dingy double bed in the middle of nowhere, Kansas, USA. Dean used to be such a man of the road. Truck stop America just isn’t his home anymore, but he’s starting to learn that
The bell rings and Crowley appears at the threshold of the shop. Cas looks down but he spots them immediately.
He gestures to the empty spot on the bed, and Cas nods. They’re so close on the narrow bed that their knees, practically their whole thighs are touching and Cas looks down at the space between them quietly for a minute before glancing up at his face, but Dean’s still looking down at his hands, playing with his bottle cap.
“I didn’t lose my faith because of you,” Cas says quietly. His eyes raise and trace Dean’s face, who takes a long time to notice and look back. “I prefer to think that I simply...redirected it. Found something better to worship and believe in. I found free will—and to love as an act of that. You, and Sam, and Charlie. I don’t regret that, and I do think that’s a kind of faith.” He smiles and concedes, “Perhaps not the traditional kind that you’re more used to.”
“It’s not easy for me like it is for you!” Dean bursts, spinning around to face him. “I don’t...I don’t know how to do this. With you.”
Dean looks at Crowley; then he looks at Cas. Cas tilts his head at Dean, his brow furrowed to indicate that he doesn’t think this is a good idea. Dean looks him for a long time before he sighs.
“Are you sure you can’t stay another hour?” Lisa says, glancing up at the night sky. “I think it’s supposed to rain soon.”
. And he doesn’t want him to pull away, the way Dean can feel he’s seconds from doing if Dean doesn’t assure him that everything’s OK.
“I don’t,” Cas calls. Dean glances over in time to see Cas shrug off the side of the shed and come join them by the treeline. He shakes his head, then sticks out his hand to Benny. “I suppose I owe you an apology. I still believe that you’re an untrustworthy, bloodsucking abomination who should be eradicated from the face of this earth—but you saved Dean’s life today. So thank you.”
“Huh,” Dean murmurs to himself. “Dude’s watching
“You think,” Cas says in a voice like crackling lightning, “that this is
“I know,” he says, trying to breathe. He watches his hands on the kitchen table. “But I didn’t go looking for this, it came to me.”
The streetlight on the curb flickers overhead when he steps over the curb. Lisa’s front porch is dark.
Neal half-jogged back down the driveway, still waving at them over his shoulder. Dean rounded on Cas as soon as his balding head disappeared around the bend.
,” she stage-whispers.
“Nearly,” Dean sighs. “I should be home in a day or two. Listen, man...How you feeling?”
Cas stiffens. “I know that.”
“You defecate in a plastic box outside.”
“And he’s not coming back,” he concludes.
The story’s clearcut: Two days ago Mrs. Olsen of Arcadia, Indiana woke up just like every other Wednesday morning. Her husband went to work while she tended to their garden. She read a book; she made dinner. When her husband came home, they had a nice meal. He cleaned up after them. Then while he was loading up the dishwasher, Mrs. Olsen clobbered him over the head with a golf club, dragged him to the front yard, hitched him to the back of their station wagon and drove in circles over their gravel driveway for twenty-eight and a half minutes. Then she backed over him—twice. She took a shower and went to bed like it never happened.
“What the hell are you doing, Cas?” he asks, looking over the spread canvas bemusedly.
Dean shifts around the car, getting into a better position to attack. The vampire comes up to the other side of the trunk, hands up but face weary.
religiously but only recently started making Dean and Ben deal with it too. Dean knows why, but he doesn’t feel like delving into all of it so he just lets it happen. Then Ben leaves for school and Lisa for work; Dean tries to pull his weight around the house with chores, yardwork, looking for jobs too—he can’t crash there rent-free forever. Ben goes to his room for homework after practice, and Lisa comes home shortly thereafter and gets started on dinner. Dean should probably take over that job for her.
“Wait a minute. I know you...You’re Hannah,” Dean says. “Cas’s new BFF.”
They hit Walmart so Cas can fill up on underthings and bathroom necessities, and he picks up a few candles and journals for his room. Dean stops asking what the hell he’s doing sometime around the big poster of the lights of New Delhi that Cas throws in the cart. They’re supposed to be inconspicuous with their illegal funds, meaning they’re not supposed to spend too much at once, but Dean seems unwilling to blame him for a couple of impulse buys when he’s trying to build a life from the ground up.
“I work very hard to keep you alive, Dean, I would appreciate some consideration for my handiwork.”
“Well I’m sorry, but those days are over.” Dean shakes his head. “From now on, I’m the first person you call when things go sideways. OK? I should be the first number on your speed dial.”
It’s natural, and that’s the distracting part; that, and how this close, uninterrupted and mainlined, he can smell
new.”
“We could go out,” he suggests.
Cas drops his hand as he leads the way into what must be the head honchos’ tent. There’s a map spread out on a table with tacks clustered by color, which six angels are surrounding and talking in low, urgent voices, with Hannah recognizable among them. Cas comes to stand at a space at the head of the table.
He loads burgers onto buns, and without a word, Cas swaps out for an empty platter when the first one is full. He catches the back of Dean’s apron as he’s passing around him, deftly retying it tight enough to stay knotted.
“Buddy, just try to keep me out of a good bomb-making group project,” Dean laughs, shaking his head. Then he looks around at them all and sobers. “Look, where he goes, I go. I’m not letting Cas get half-dead for a blood spell without somebody around watching his back.”
“I’m not playing, Dean,” Cas says, stepping dangerously closer. “They’re my family.”
“So I’m supposed to come down and babysit you through your trauma? Little human?” Cas says, in that dark and serious voice he uses that Dean pretends doesn’t zap his spine straight. Cas steps forward, and Dean trips closer to the wall. “I’m not your therapist, Dean. I tried to help you. And you said no.”
He and Charlie retire to Cas’s room afterward the movie’s over, resolving that they have plenty of time this weekend to watch the rest of the ogre franchise. Cas fishes some snacks out of the kitchen and comes back to find that Charlie has unloaded a board game from her bag and spread it out on the floor.
“Fucking monsters,” Dean mutters.
“Hey there, Charlie,” he says after an awkward beat, pulling her into a hug.
Dean looks stricken for a split second before he rearranges his features into deliberate calm. Yeah, Cas has seen those signs before too. Right now, he’d estimate that Dean is 80% hot air. “We’ll...steal what we can, then, I don’t know—Maybe some of the leftovers survived and turned into a sapling or something. We’ll grab that, and we’ll even kill the son of a bitch as a bonus to you.”
“If you must.” Huffing, Cas opens one eye. “Do we need to feed you?”
“OK,” Cas concedes, though he’s frowning. “Call me if there’s any trouble.”
“You still have a go-bag,” Cas observes, watching Dean from the middle of their bedroom. Dean glances up from throwing the last few essentials into the duffle that he keeps stocked with his weapons roll in the closet. “Do you plan on picking up and leaving again sometime soon?”
But he offers Dean the first hit from his bowl, which he takes; Dean seems to like the music more after he does, swaying side to side while he eats. Cas watches him for a minute, feeling warm, but he stops when Dean asks him what he’s looking at.
Hannah watches him for a long moment. Then she and the other one disappear.
“I don’t know.” Dean yanks on his sweatshirt, prompting Cas to look at him. “What do you want to do?”
“Dean!” she says, sharper. “Do you really think that’s what I’m mad about? A little bit of broken glass?”
“I’ll do ya one better,” Dean says. He leans the crutches against Cas’s bed and then reaches down, helping him to his feet first. Dean steadies him with a hand low on his back, eyes flicking over Cas from up close as though the proximity will help him assess his condition. “Man, you are all busted up.”
He’s never made chicken pot pie before, but it seems applicable for a barbecue; Jenny squeals when she hugs him and Neal whispers that Dean’s in the good books when he pats him on the back in hello. Cas is a marble statue by Dean’s side, awkward and immobile.
“Great,” Dean says. “I’ll be back tonight.”
“Starved,” he says, and is surprised to find that’s true. He wouldn’t have thought—Well. Maybe he thought that something should be different, but his body was his body was his body that liked carbs. “Is there coffee?”
“I know that,” he says.
The night comes on faster than expected: It’s like he blinks and looks up and there’s the darkened sky, right where the sunlight was just blinding him through the front windshield. His hand is cramping, he realizes. He doesn’t know for how long. His back hurts from sitting upright in the same position for so long. His stomach aches, from not enough food or not enough drink or more phantom pains, maybe, from the graveyard. From the—Fuck.
“I don’t care about some random strongmen that I’ve never even heard of,” Dean tells him. “I just can’t believe that you’ve never heard of Kurt Russell.”
“I thought,” says Cas, getting heavily to his feet, “that you were doing better.”
“I don’t want to talk about it!” Dean snarls. “So what, you thought I’d need someone to stay up and talk about it over coffee?”
“Lisa, there’s clearly a case.”
Hannah isn’t watching Cas. Instead she’s scanning the room, her face all business again. She points to one of the sewing boxes that’s slid halfway beneath the couch.
Cas arms slide around him, one over his shoulder, the other on his waist. He feels Cas kiss his shoulder, nuzzle his forehead into his back.
“No, probably not. I imagine it would take quite a lot of marijuana,” Cas muses. “I was just, um, looking for the extra soap.”
And then it’s not just him: It’s Mom, and his dad, and Bobby too, and then others—all of the people he should have but didn’t save. Who he let die for him instead. They start closing in on him, just oozing out of the walls and reaching for him, reaching—He covers his eyes, and this is probably where he starts saying Cas’s name aloud in his sleep, but in the dream he just cowers and—
“You didn’t fall alone, Cas,” he whispers.
He’s only got a fraction of the time he wants before there’s a crash, and he wakes up with a start.
“I’m not worried about me!” Ben stands up with a loud scrape of his chair against the hardwood floor. “What if something happens to him when he’s out there all alone?”
“Dean…”
Dean sleeps poorly, but at least he finally sleeps. Even though Cas doesn’t, Dean finds him nearly identical to how he left him last night, lying on Dean’s chest with his face close and blank. Cas keeps watching him for a long time after he wakes up, running his finger down Dean’s cheek.
“What the hell happened?” Lisa demands, pushing him suddenly back. “I saw the kitchen and the yard, and I thought—”
. If we purify Sam’s blood—”
She beckons him inside. He glances back before disappearing. Cas turns on Crowley as soon as they’re alone.
“I have friends!”
Dean has afternoons where he doesn’t talk a whole lot, and they often leave him alone but sometimes they just crowd around him and do something else in the same room so he can tune in if he wants to. Today, Lisa compliments the yard when she gets home, and he helps Ben with his homework for an hour before he goes out to check on Baby, right on schedule.
He picks up the phone as he’s walking out, leaving Dean alone in the middle of his room, sitting on his bed.
Charlie can handle a lot more weed than Cas, so he doesn’t bother trying to keep up. He’s seen what happens when humans overdue alcohol and has no interest in finding out what the marijuana equivalent is of a blackout and brutal hangover.
Charlie doesn’t wait for him to figure out what the means; she flicks the paper and it sails across the table and hits Cas square in the forehead. While she loses a hold of herself laughing, he levels her one of his patented extra-strength frowns: He’s got plenty of practice putting up with Sam and Dean all day long.
“Let’s just do the spell,” Cas says, glancing between the both of them.
Dean’s laughter against his cheek doesn’t seem to think this is a very compelling argument. Neither do the fingers plucking away his weed and crushing it into the bedside table without a care in the world for their security deposit.
“And you thought I wouldn’t give up Heaven for this,” he sighs, shaking his head. He strokes Dean’s hair with intent, making him look up. Speaking directly to Dean’s lower lip, Cas adds, “I’m sorry. Your blinding self-hatred just seems minisculely ridiculous in this moment.”
“What did you bring the human here for?” one asks.
But the sun dawns, same as it always does. Dean went to bed so early last night that he’s up as soon as it rises, and not just because the birds are really, really loud from out here. Dean opens the padlock on the door and steps out into the early morning sun.
“Well hello to you too,” Dean says at last. “How have I been doing, you ask? Well thank you very much for checking in on me! I’m good, except my best friend keeps going super-ghost on me for months at a time—”
Dean swallows. The tears ebb enough that he can catch his breath.
“I was here when the earth was created and I’ve watched over it ever since,” Cas says, which Dean ignores because remembering all the millennia that Cas sat on his ass while the planet ran wild pisses him off, and Dean doesn’t want to deal with it right now. “I very much doubt you could take me somewhere that would surprise me.”
Dean gapes at him. “Yes, I must!”
Cas shrugs. “It’s possible. I was tricked, but I still had a hand in making them fall. Now that Naomi’s dead, I’m not sure if anyone knows that.”
“Yet when I try to make time for you, you get mad,” Cas finishes.
“Really?” Cas is in front of him, quiet as a rumor as quick as one, too. He studies Dean silently, maybe a little judgmentally. “So you’ve been taking the melatonin?”
“OK. Done.” Cracking his neck, he adds, “All this decorating crap is making me feel like a chick, can we watch TV or something instead? I need to get my testosterone on.”
“I have a family too,” she says.
When he’s picking up the tipped over box, Dean catches him looking. The look he gives then makes Cas shrug off the door (phone on speaker so he can hear if the kind wife to the rude woman returns) and get close enough to unofficially pass into his orbit.
He hears the door slam into the opposite wall, still struggling fruitlessly to move, instinct telling him to chase her. Cas’s favorite, most familiar voice shouts his name in the distance. The door slams closed again, and then Cas is looking through a sea of fallen books at Sophie on the floor, Dean on top of her with a stranglehold on her neck, his knee trapping one arm and the other held fast by Dean’s hand.
“Did you...need something?” Cas asks eventually, when he catches on that Dean’s too
“You’re not a dog, Dean.” He rolls his eyes—a very human gesture. Dean would be more worried if he didn’t spend all his time in his old stomping grounds, rubbing shoulders with Heaven’s baddest war criminals. “I’m just here to ask you to keep it down while I’m out there handling
“Are they yours?” Cas retorts, annoyance prickling along the back of his neck at her line of questioning, though for no reason he can discern.
“But let me guess, you would do it again and again if you got the chances?”
“It was,” Cas says, and Dean glances up and his gaze must see something there, because it holds.
“Thanks for having my back in there,” Dean starts.
“They won’t need me for another couple of days at least,” Cas says as Dean’s putting in the last one. “I don’t know if you had any plans…”
“You’re human now,” Dean says eventually, bending to get back to his task. He stretches a butterfly bandage over Cas’s neck, knuckles bumping the underside of his chin. “You need to take better care of yourself.”
“I’m fine, Ben.” His hand’s shaking.
Cas glances behind him, at the windows. “I don’t know. Maybe it was a front…”
“Stop,” he grits out, feeling Dean’s hand on his shoulder.
“That’s enough, Ishim,” Hannah snaps, throwing her arm out to block his advance. “We don’t harm Dean Winchester.”
Dean breaks out first in a jog toward the sound of her voice, and then a run. He still can’t see, and he’s tripping over his feet, but the woman’s plea is loud and unbroken and it’s impossible to deviate off-course no matter how many times he stumbles. The closer he runs full-tilt in her direction, the high-pitched shout gets clearer and clearer, until it coalesces into a distinct yell. Subconsciously Dean recognizes that the words are staggered, that she’s
“Look, boys. I’m trying...to do better.” He swallows. “Just give me a chance. Please, just give me a chance to do better.”
“Must you?” Cas asks, trying to duck away from the cotton ball that’s nearly touching his eye.
Dean waggles his eyebrows. Cas rolls his eyes.
Dean turns toward him with his eyebrows raised.
“Dean,” Cas says around when they’re passing the state line back into Indiana. It’s late, edging from Sunday night over into Monday morning. “May I suggest something? I’m not sure if it’s a good idea.”
Dean snatches her phone.
“Of course.” He likes Charlie very much, he’s decided. She seems genuine and kind. “What is it?”
He steps closer in one fluid motion, and it’s enough to box Dean in against the side of the house. Dean glances at his face and then away, scowling. Cas tips his head in just such a way to press even further into Dean’s headspace.
“The hell do you know about painting?” Dean asks.
“We’re in,” Dean says, holding out a hand for Benny to shake while Cas glowers at the side of his face. “But we’ve got our eye on you.”
“Shhh,” Cas admonishes. “I’ll celebrate my victory later. You can teach me how to make pot brownies.”
“Tell me you want this, Cas,” he says, his voice quiet and croaky, shaky but grounding. “Just...tell me you want this too.”
“I didn’t say you did,” Cas counters. They stare at each other again, waiting for the other to break first.
“I guess.”
“Realigned?” he repeats, because it’s better than the other word he can feel sticking in the back of his throat.
Charlie frowns when he’s edging his way out of the room. She whirls around on Cas.
“I don’t understand what you’re trying to say,” Cas tells him finally, frustrated, like he always gets when he thinks Dean’s talking in circles on purpose. Sometimes Dean just really doesn’t know how to translate his heart to his mouth.
“Yeah, crazy, right?” Dean says, bumping him with his shoulder. Cas smiles. “What dumb son-of-a-bitch would go from Heaven to
“Dean…”
They talk strategy for awhile. Claire reaches for a second beer and Cas smacks her hand out of the air.
“You saying you did this all for me?” he says, aiming for a joke but Cas can see right through him: He means it and it’s painful for him to even think it, hence wrapping it in layers of irony. Cas curls his hands into the front of Dean’s t-shirt.
“Charlie?” he calls.
Neal whistled. “You were right, Dean, this guy is hilarious! Tell me you’re bringing him along to the barbecue.”
“What alley?” asks Cas. He takes the hand Dean offers to pull him up.
toast every single morning for the rest of his life, so they were on a trial basis with Cas branching out his culinary attempts.
Cas looks at him, nodding his head once.
It should be a traditionally easy kill, silver blade to the heart, no big deal. Cas doesn’t sleep much the first night Dean’s gone—tosses and turns the second, third and fourth night too. Not being able to instantly heal himself is awful. Knowing Dean’s alone on a case is awful, too.
Lisa’s expression cracks down the middle, and she says, “It’s never too late,” and her voice is overloaded with something that Dean can’t take too close a look at.
“It’s not?” Cas scanned his work seriously. “Yours was much...straighter.”
“What?” Her jaw’s clenched. Dean frowns, tilting his head to look at her.
“You’re not gonna start talking about how beautiful God’s creations are and shit, are you?” Dean asks.
Dean chokes for a second on his steak.
“Are you satisfied?” Cas asks dryly.
He shifts closer to Dean on the bed, and now he’s the one leaning over Dean; his hand hesitates over Dean’s heart before landing hard beside his shoulder. Dean swallows. Without thinking, he reaches up and pushes his fingers through Cas’s hair.
“What’s up, Mom?”
room four or five days out of the week. Now Cas sits beneath the blankets, not on top of it, but otherwise it’s the same sight as usual: smile warm, TV on and the space closest to the door left empty for him.
“Hey guys,” he says, coming back into the living room a few minutes later. “That was Garth, he’s got a case that’s only about an hour from here. I’m gonna swing by and check it out, if—if that’s OK with you, Charlie.”
“I’ve never popped somebody’s weed cherry before,” Charlie says. “I especially didn’t think I would get a chance to devirginize an
sharing his bed with him,” Cas says, rolling his eyes.
The door bangs open, but Sam’s jeans are in the way so he can’t see who’s just come in. Sam jumps out of the way and then just—turns and books it down the hall. That’s weird, too. Dean looks up just as two large hands come down and wrap around the air near where Dean could feel the great beasts breathing as they ripped into him.
“Make it later.”
After a local movie theater grabs Cas’s attention with some film about animals, they double back to get the car so he can store his jar and ditch their weapons in case the theater has metal detectors inside the doors.
“Neither am I,” Cas interrupts with an edge.
When she opens the front door, he’s struck by how she’s more beautiful than he remembers. She’s more vibrant. Her hair looks silky and for a second all Dean wants is to run his fingers through it, but then the impulse flickers out and the rest of the day floods back in, and he chokes on his next words.
“Jesus Christ, just throw me back in Hell already,” Dean mutters, while Cas nods at a family passing on the trail. This incline is insane. Give him a few rounds with a demon any day over this.
“Are you alright?” he asks, letting Dean take his hands but just standing there, studying his face. “How are you holding up?”
the age she tries to look (red leather jacket, one braid in the side of her hair, smudged eyeliner on her bottom lids so the world can see she’s damaged, they run by cases like her every other week) but she acts like it, doesn’t she? She’s smart like it, can handle anything like she’s older and just as mature.
Cas says nothing for long enough that Dean glances up, only to find him just standing there looking at him.
They glare at each other for a minute, steady. A strange, light feeling raises in his chest like a filling balloon and it’s—easier, Dean realizes. It’s an argument about something besides Gods and Devils and the fucking Apocalypse. Dean breathes out. He leans back in his chair.
“I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings,” Cas sneers. “Time works differently for us. When you’ve been around as long as I have, a month seems—”
“When are we closing tonight?” he asks.
“Was he mysteriously missing all of his
In the warm afternoon heat, Dean strips down to a grey undershirt and hauls the large glass pane into place. It’s heavy without an extra set of hands but sweat’s been blooming along his hairline for hours already, so Dean barely notices the discomfort at this point. The sun stripes through the living room windows, freshly installed, and paints him all over with searing hellfire and fresh energy. If he can finish the living room today, he’ll be nearly done with the structural part of building. All that’ll be left is more wiring, furniture and paint.
“Cas…”
“Is he old enough to drink yet?” Dean asks. “Kid’s growing like a weed.”
“You think,” Cas says in a voice like crackling lightning, “that this is easy for me?”
“Samandriel!” he shouts, when the anxiety starts spiking all the way to his hands and he can’t control his need to run anymore. “I have to go see what that was! Can you finish these sigils?”
“Maybe I will take you up on that hasty escape,” Dean tells Hannah, backing up toward the door.
...that’s…” he says, in that blustering way that makes Cas want to kiss him, but he has to let Dean let it out first. Charlie’s losing her shit. “I’m an adult. Shut the fuck up.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, and he made them drinks but he’s barely had any when he sets the glass down and puts his hand on Cas’s good knee. “Stop talking about the bar and look at me.”
“Yeah, we’ll see,” he promises. “Look, I gotta go. I’ll talk to you soon...Yeah. Yeah. I’ll let you know about Saturday. OK. Bye, Lisa.”
“I came back here when I didn’t have to,” the vampire reminds him. “I could be halfway to the state border by now.”
“Oh,” he repeats, his voice coming out gruffer. He sits up straighter and watches his fingers clench around the stem.
“I don’t want you to baby me, Cas,” he says, quieter. Dean licks his lips. “But...it might’ve been nice to see a familiar face.”
Cas’s hand, covering Dean’s and pushed into the pillows, clenches twice. His lips brush Dean’s chin when he raises his head.
He can still be helpful; he can still set things right by giving Dean what he needs on a silver platter, just like he always has. No, no, that sounds like a bribe set to make Dean care about him too, but he doesn’t need to try so hard. He already knows that Dean cares more about him than he can stand to admit. But it still feels good to give him what he wants, to have the answers when he asks for them. This is why it doesn’t undermine him when his brothers and sisters call him selfish: He knows he isn’t. Loving Dean is an exercise in thinking less about what he knows or thinks is right than he ever has in his long, long life.
“Don’t
“Let him go. Just leave it,” Dean murmurs in his ear, jostling him toward the door. Other diners are starting to stare.
“You know I’m always here for you, right?” says Lisa.
He stares off into the middle-distance—watching the road but not really seeing it. The car bumbles over the line into the next town, and Cas blows out a big breath.
“I was merely being nice to your friends, Dean,” said Cas, levelling him a look. “You don’t go out nearly enough.”
young,” Charlie says. “She’s in this bar.”
“Yes, the human part of me is gone. That’s true,” Cas murmurs—thoughtfully, he thinks. His big blue eyes find Dean’s and settle. His fingers clench even tighter. “But you showed me the path to righteousness before, Dean. I’m confident you can do it again.”
When Dean ducks inside, the room’s overflowing with blinding light. One angel is standing beside Cas, gripping his arm to keep him upright while he bleeds over the bowl and muttering their spell with him too. Everybody else has abandoned the table. They’re taking defensive blows, all facing the big bundle of light glowing sunshine-golden in the far corner of the room.
Dean gets a hand underneath himself to push up, ready to leap back to his feet. His gun’s close by, and Dean grabs it and aims—the siren dives for cover but Dean gets it in the leg. The siren screams and drops to his good knee, and Dean tightens his grip on the bronze blade; he’s nearly ready to launch himself across the room but the door slams open before he can do it. Dean and the siren both look up.
“So what do you do up there besides fight your holy battles?” Dean asks. He pauses. “
The man’s eyebrow arches.
Sure enough:
Cas shakes his head. “Yes. Especially me.”
“What about what you’ve done, angel?” Crowley asks as he stands, too. “Sorry.
He’s serious, so Dean knocks their elbows together and agrees; and then he gets up to get them another round of his preferred fare with more ice. He pours Cas a double, although frankly he’ll never catch up to Dean. Last time he went on a bender it took a whole liquor store to keep him hammered—literally. Oh, how the mighty have settled.
“Yeah, and look how that worked out,” Dean snorts. He pulls on Cas’s sweater until he comes close enough to wrap his arms around, nuzzling warmly into the back of his shoulder.
I want?” he asks.
Dean drums his fingers on the steering wheel to focus on something besides not looking at Cas, but he can’t help sneaking a glance or two in that direction. Cas is entirely still on the passenger side.
Dean pushes him down into the pillows.
“No.” Cas gestures across the room. “I’m here with my friend.”
It’s true; she trotted right up to the backseat of the borrowed car without any fuss whatsoever. Miracle barked when they got back to the bunker and stuffing his set leg in the front seat of a car was worth it for the excited way she waited at the door like she knew she was coming home.
“You know I do,” he says finally. He looks at Cas, and something he sees there seems to hook him, make it linger. Dean’s mouth opens slowly, like he’s trying to find the words, although when they come Cas imagines they were supposed to sound more casual like the tone implies. “You remember Purgatory, don’t you, Cas? That seem like some shit I’d do if I didn’t care about you?”
“I told you not to tangle with a witch!” he growls. “What were you thinking?”
“Dean,” he tries again when he looks up. Cas licks his lips. “I want to apologize for being short with you yesterday.”
“Claire and Alex will be staying in the adjacent room,” Cas says, failing to hide how his breath is catching. Dean smiles, fingers creeping more boldly.
” He pauses, notices Dean looking at him. “What?”
For a moment he can’t make himself climb out of the car. What if she lets him in? Suddenly the thought is just as terrifying as it was comforting. Dean doesn’t know how to live in the suburbs. He doesn’t know how to drive Ben to school or sleep in the same bed as a woman more than two nights in a row or get through a whole day without thinking about Sam. Today he hasn’t even managed to last through one hour.
“Oh.”
“Well, you know what I mean,” Charlie says, waving her hand.
“Yeah.”
“Sure am,” he replies.
“They were torturing him, Cas,” he says, trying in vain to pry Cas’s hands off him. “What was I supposed to do?”
He strides across the room and pulls Sam into a hug. Sam huffs a laugh into his shoulder and pats his back, then pulls him closer.
“I wouldn’t put it like that,” Cas murmurs, leaning down to shut him up.
“Because this is a gay bar,” Cas says, arching an eyebrow, “and because sometimes people are attracted to me.”
“Do not compare us to Hell,” he says, eyes getting all squinty again. “We’re trying to put things back straight. Create a better world order.”
Dean quirks one eyebrow at him and then leans down to sink another two balls in a row into the same corner pocket. Teaching Cas how to play pool is a slow-going affair. He hopes that, eventually, they can both hustle at the same time to double their rewards per night. Cas seems very determined to stay the freeloading trophy boyfriend.
“What’s weighing on you, Dean?” Cas asks awhile into their game. Dean looks up.
“It’s none of your business,” Cas snaps when he’s pushed a third time, knocking Dean’s arms out of the way, yanking him in by the jacket and slamming him into the wall hard enough to knock out his breath. “What are
“Yeah, because that sounds just like you.”
“Hello, Dean,” he says, nodding minutely. “The kitchen light has been dealt with.”
“Jesus Christ.” Dean rolls his eyes, turning away from him. “Don’t go all Doctor Sexy on me now.”
“Yeah, well unfortunately wanting something doesn’t make it so,” Dean says with more bite than he intends. He takes a moment, closing his eyes, doing deep breaths like Sam used to bug him to try. “Just...just stay here until you’re better, OK? No running off and doing something stupid. You’re gonna get yourself killed.”
“I don’t think—” he starts.
The broken wheel on the desk chair spins a half-circle in the air again, then jams. A pause. More cursing, then a screwdriver tinkering with the joint. The wheel spins and cuts off with an awful grinding sound.
But when it gets darker, after they’ve cleared away their dinners, everybody sits around the fire eating apple pie. Cas lingers near the seat Dean’s settled into beside Bobby until he eventually can’t avoid Alex beckoning him over eagerly, probably to fill her head with more cosmic injustices and truths too fucked up for most people to handle. Then again this girl was apparently rescued from a vampire cult who used her as a free buffet for many years, Stockholm Syndrome thrown in for free, so maybe she’s the best person for Cas to latch onto here; she’s the least likely to suffer a mental breakdown under his absolute intensity.
“Yeah? Well that’s my call to make,” said Dean. Truth was, he hadn’t felt like going anywhere that wasn’t strictly necessary, like work and the supermarket, for a very long time. Jesus Christ, he had a regular
Dean’s drumming on the steering wheel along with the last song on his second-favorite road trip cassette as he pulls into the driveway. His gaze trails on the side mirror as he puts it in park and while he’s hauling the garage door shut. It snags on the gate to the yard, too, as Dean lets himself in and shuts the door behind him; he makes himself a sandwich, slicing clean through a baguette that Lisa’s had on top of the fridge for a week in change and tearing through some deli beef he found with the other sandwich stuff in the drawer.
“Almost, huh?”
He throws the covers off himself and goes to rinse his mouth from the gummy sleep feeling, splash water on his face to erase the tear tracks that are drying faster than the nightmare can slip away from his conscious memory.
Cas finds himself very sorry to say goodbye to Charlie. She hugs him tight and promises to see them both soon, and then all too quickly their long weekend with her is over. Cas and Dean start the three hour drive toward home.
Cas can’t help it; he breaks into a smile. The way he says it sounds a whole lot like
His voice is round and heavy with fond familiarity. Anyway, this part never cost Cas anything.
Dean’s never seen advanced spellwork up close. He’s never seen anyone work magic like this: He’s not sure what he expected, since most of the witches he’s tangled with play with low-level party tricks. But Cas slices through the palm of his hand. All together, the angels begin to chant.
kind of restorative state, even if it can’t be sleep. Dean just blinks at the ceiling in the dark for over an hour before he’s fed up.
“Good morning, Dean,” he murmurs, fingers stroking the pillow marks Dean can feel indented on his cheek.
. In the nightmare, though, the hellhounds don’t stop. Dean screams and screams and mauls the floor until his nails are bloody, until he finally wakes up.
Jesus Christ.
“I’m not a duck, Dean,” he says, pulling his hand off of Dean’s shoulder. He squints at the ground for a long moment as though gathering his thoughts; and when he looks back at Dean, it’s hard and unyielding as the stone Dean once thought that angels were made of. He watches Cas shake off the clay with clear, earnest eyes.  “You taught me what love
He sits up and sighs, shutting his book.
“...and more than the day before that, and the day before that,” Cas says, because it’s true, and because Dean is a little funny after all: Eyebrows halfway up his forehead, not sure where to put his hands. He settles for balling them in the bed on either side of Cas’s head.
The clouds are greying out the sky when they turn back onto the highway and leave Indianapolis in the rearview mirror. When Dean glances back at the edge of the parking lot, Benny’s already gone back inside.
“Then I don’t know.”
Dean draws as fast as he can without smudging the sigils beyond usefulness. When he reaches the second corner, he hears a scream ring out from the center of the encampment—where Cas’s boss tent is standing now.
that way, Dean! I can’t get over my humanity because it’s an inconvenience to
He gives Dean a meaningful look. Dean frowns, relaxing his stance slightly to size him up.
“Please!” Sophie gasps. “I
to go to Heaven, he usually just bitches and fights his way there. Cas seems bent on the pleasantries of visiting his...home. “Seriously?”
Dean glances up and clocks his position, readjusts his grip on his machete, and pivots his stance to face the monster head-on.
They talk shop for a little while, finding a possible lead for Dean to check out in the morning. Cas’s eyes start getting heavy during a long debate about whether Dean should buy a new butterfly knife; his old one’s getting dull, and he would rather replace it than spend the time to sharpen it. Cas sighs, making a mental note to do it himself when Dean gets back.
Thankfully the film picks up after that because they switch to footage of sharks tearing into a bunch of different species of prey, and it’s all fairly gorey. Cas is bubbling with new facts by the time they step out into the harsh afternoon: The wind has turned frigid in the intervening hours, and Dean’s very glad they moved the car.
“You did manage to find a place of your own,” says Cas, glancing around, gaze lingering on the hotplate.
He means it, but still. For a minute, Dean doesn’t move, and Cas glares at the pavement.
The café isn’t far from the bunker. They roll up twenty minutes later and, aside from a minor incident with Cas and the crosswalk and almost running into oncoming traffic, they make it to the shop unscathed. Dean gets a plain black coffee, Cas tries some cherry thing that Dean thinks tastes like cough syrup. Cas has never had that, but he definitely agrees that the coffee is bad.
underneath the faint, lingering ozone. Cas seems to love the movie, although at one point he jumps hard and grabs Dean’s flannel in reflex. Dean warms from his chest outwards all the way to his fingertips. He rubs his thumb against Cas’s shoulder, comforting and slow.
“I did it because I’m intending to convey good will and affection through positive touch. Nonverbally,” he concludes. He inclines his head; this is not the full truth, but then Dean doesn’t always handle it well when he has it. He tends to…over-fixate on individual words. It’s merely effective that this excuse also lets Cas carefully step around what he knows Dean is really asking. “I hoped it might provide some measure of comfort.”
“You didn’t call out for me, but you were
After they eat, they stay and watch the game on TV and have more beer. They’re not expected in Cicero until it’s time for an early dinner, so Dean orders mid-afternoon nachos when happy hour rolls over them and even convinces Cas to get into them too. Human or something even better, you can’t go wrong with ground beef and melted cheese. Cas apparently has a massive liking for jalapenos.
Cas watches him just a little too closely, gives him The Full Cas: The squint, the head tilt, standing so close it’s hard to take a breath without getting a little bit of him too. In the very beginning—the very,
“No.” Cas shakes his head. “That’s not what I meant.”
“Yes.” Cas crosses his arms. “All of us...all the angels. We’ve had our wings clipped. And my...” He swallows, looks away. “My grace is gone.”
“It’s the angels,” Cas says. “It’s time.”
“I don’t, Dean,” he says, shaking his head slowly. “Not anymore. Not for one second. When I chose free will…”
“Cas, Castiel,” Dean elaborates impatiently. He must squeeze her neck again because she gasps, clawing at his arm like a wild thing. “Are the angels out looking for him, too?”
“Aren’t all the angels?” Sophie says. “Newsflash, Rocky, the Gates to Heaven got slammed shut. Everybody fell, that means
“We should order a pizza,” Cas says.
Cas is, as usual, there when he returns to his room—
“Oh yeah, Dean mentioned something about that,” Charlie says. She makes a face. “Sorry about all that falling from grace stuff.”
“But?”
“Big enough to take down Raphael?”
“Fine,” he says, flicking his eyes over Cas. “Go put on a jacket. It’s November, for crying out loud.”
“Sam would be...so pissed if he knew we were smoking in the library,” Dean says, coughing in between breaths.
“I highly doubt it,” Cas says. “Can you help me—Get this—?”
“All the same, you seem to do better after I come to stay.” Cas studies his face, although what he sees there, Dean has no clue; he honestly has no idea what his own expression looks like after a steadfast declaration like that.
“I beat my old high score on Minesweeper,” he says after a minute’s thought. He hasn’t moved much today, it’s hard to recall doing
Dean pauses. He shrugs and goes back to what he’s doing: affixing a rather large and ugly painting onto the wall. Dean puts it up. Realizes it’s upside-down. Puts it back.
“OK first of all, stop calling yourself a teenager, alright? I am not your dad,” Dean says. “And second of all, you opened Purgatory, man! You tortured Kevin! I mean, up until three weeks ago, you were literally running Hell. We’re not just gonna let you hop right on over to Team Free Will because you drank a little blood. I mean, who hasn’t?”
“What?”
By some coincidence, Cas found that show about the young, annoying medium that Dean passed out to many months ago in a similar-looking motel room, feeling very much like he does today. Dean grins into his drink when he sees what’s on. Cas doesn’t look at him, just watches the show with his face in that patented squint, looking as though he has a thousand and one criticisms in mind. Dean doesn’t say anything either, mostly watches Cas and pretends that he isn’t.
It’s been a long day in the car, and although Dean has missed hitting the road with Baby for longer drives, he and Cas started getting on each other’s nerves around hour number five and that was all the way back at sunset. It’s long been dark when he pulls the car up the driveway, and the house is cold. Dean goes right to the thermostat when he gets in and Cas takes the opportunity to snag first shower.
Dean murmurs his name as he lowers them both down to the bed. Cas curls closer, nose nudging his, crowding into his space. Dean’s hands find the warm skin beneath his thin t-shirt, the solid muscles there. He just feels at first: Touching, caressing, and then his hands spread out and he uses the grip to pull Cas closer. His mouth opens beneath Dean’s with a gasp.
don’t appreciate human marvels.”
“Oh great.” The siren gets to his feet and slowly turns around. He’s taller than Dean, which is saying something, and dressed like pretty much everybody Dean’s ever met at the farmer’s market that Cas has dragged him to a couple of times when he happens to wake up in time on Saturdays. Finding out his best friend was a closet granolahead had really sucked; fucking 2014 seems alarmingly possible now. Hippie stoner attitude and dubious orgies and absinthe, oh my. This siren is nearly as nauseating to look at. “I don’t suppose I can convince you to go five miles down the road to the nearest Kroger?”
“Uh...Thanks, I guess.” He pauses, feeling like the air is thick with something that's making this uncomfortable. Like there’s something that he should say but he doesn’t know what it is. “How’s the war effort going?”
“Yes,” Cas tells him, and Dean looks up. “I would make all the same choices, Dean, good and bad, if I had to go back and do it again. Because it made the world safer for everyone.”
Dean rolls his eyes.
A guilty fire has begun to burn inside him. Sam needs him, he does; and he should have been there for him. He owes it to Sam, after all, he’s half the reason Earth is so much safer now in the first place. Only monsters and powered-down angels and a few straggling demons left, oh my.
, darling.”
When Dean pulls into the driveway, Lisa’s car is already crowding up the garage.
Although the living room is just four walls connected and not even blocked off from the kitchen, Dean’s well aware that he needs bad cartoons to stay sane. He hooked a TV up in the middle of the room and just ran an extension cord from the closest outlet, and dragged in a couch that he found curbside a few streets away. Dean sprawls out in the middle of the ratty old thing, forcing Cas to crowd into a corner.
“Sam,” Cas breathes, relieved. Sam’s sitting up on his hospital bed, smiling in his direction.
“Which means you’re in danger. You know, maybe it’s a good thing that you’re benched for now. The angels are still on high alert out here—”
They throw a game in the younger ones’ favor first, then a few parents corral the kids over to the other side of the yard so the adults can go head-to-head, full contact. Dean’s team wins by a landslide, mostly because of a killer takedown when Cas somehow gets his hands on the flag, promptly panics and freezes in place, and Dean tackles him all the way into the bushes.
“I’m glad we’re friends now, Charlie,” he tells her seriously.
show, but the angels keep showing up trying to use me as their own personal FM signal! They think I’ll lead them to Metatron.”
Charlie has a pristinely clean, orange and blue bowl with little stars drawn all over it. Despite Charlie’s repeated warnings that Cas be very careful and take his first hit slow, he still ends up inhaling too sharply. He’s pretty sure he’s going to cough up a lung onto Charlie’s living room floor, but he doesn’t; and when he comes to, Charlie is laughing.
Benny sticks his head in over the table.
He passes the kitchen on his way to the study.
Now, Cas easily fits the second piece of wall (or the bare bones for one, anyway) against the first, dressed in a plain white undershirt and a pair of jeans that need a belt to stay up. Dean finishes drilling and steps back to assess.
“Your friend seems awfully busy,” he notes.
“Me too, I guess,” Dean says. “Like you said, one day I just looked up and realized what had always been there. And I couldn’t hold it in anymore.”
“Yes, Dean,” he sighs exasperatedly. “I suppose.”
“No, I mean, I’m still a virgin.”
“You know, I don’t understand you,” Dean says, shaking his head at the floor. Cas
“You’re hungry,” he deduces, geniusly.
And getting better—he drops the tape and pulls Dean back with him, and they silently agree that he should push Cas backwards into his sheets. A rush of air punches out of him like he took a much heavier fall.
He scoffs. “I don’t eat that many sandwiches.”
“I...didn’t realize we were still calling ourselves that,” Cas says.
“Well yeah, sure. But it seems deeper than that. I don’t know,” Dean says, shaking his head. “You don’t seem very angelic lately, that’s all.”
“I thought I was doing very well considering I’ve never had the occasion to do that with a woman before,” he says.
The cabin is pretty deep in the woods about an hour out from home base, and Dean manages to drive up pretty close to it. He’ll have to walk maybe twenty, thirty minutes to get the rest of the way there.
OK. And it’s obvious, suddenly, the thing Dean has to say to let Cas know it.
“And she hurt my friend,” Cas growls.
It’s not that Dean doesn’t miss Bobby. It’s that he
“Alright, alright, alright.” Dean’s hand lands on his shoulder and rubs circles into Cas’s sleeve. Unsurprisingly, the touch instantly calms him down; Dean has his pull over him, oh yes, even now. Even when he’s not the most important thing in the room, he still is. He always is. “What do you really want, Crowley?”
Dean ducks his head.
“Let’s go,” he says by way of announcing his presence.
Dean stares at him as he comes back to the table.
“Does it bother you?” Dean asks as Cas lifts him over a branch he didn’t notice, with one hand on his elbow. “That Jimmy’s dead? He’s dead, right? He’s not still attached to you like a burning comet?”
“I said—”
“We’re making a bit of a road trip,” Dean concedes. “I get antsy going out of state when I’m not packing any heat.”
When he passes her to toss the broken glass, she grabs his shoulder and pushes him, turns him around to look at her.
He gets the last lock then and they’re awash in the smell of spilled beer and leather and cigarettes, which is pretty much how Dean always smells anyway so it doesn’t really bother Cas, although the intensity coming from Rocky’s is a little much when it first hits like a brick wall. A small woman with a big knife in her belt catches their eye and says something to the bartender, and then Dean turns around and a smile breaks across his face like sunrise spilling over the night ocean waves.
“You can’t control it!”
, did you?” Dean says, forcing himself to be dismissive. Rolling his eyes, he steps around Cas to get at the thread, glancing over his shoulder to ask, “Have you been spying on me again?”
Dean should probably break his stare at some point, right? This is probably getting weird.
He put his hand over hers on the table.
“Dean,” Cas hisses.
“I could...use a drink,” Cas says, and promptly goes deadweight again.
Back at the bunker, Cas hauls everything into the arboretum to sort through at leisure. He unloads the plant stuff first, making his usual rounds; leaving the bunker is hard and it’s harder to convince Dean to go out of his way to pick him up anything from a store he isn’t already planning to visit. Cas is learning how to take care of other living things by himself.
He doesn’t like being around so many people, but appreciates the one-on-one with this woman, Alicia, who’s funny and talks about her twin brother with clear love shining through. When she’s enjoyed her tour of the place and lost to Dean at a round of darts, Charlie comes back over and hones in on Alicia immediately. Dean slots in beside Cas and kisses him softly behind the ear when he shuffles around to get more juice.
It’s a short nap, just a little under an hour. But it’s enough for Dean to dream.
“I hope you’re here to make my day,” the vampire says, barely lifting his head enough to spit out some blood.
“What are you doing here?” he asks, calmly he thinks; but Crowley flicks his gaze over Cas as though he’s a bug that’s crawled its way into their conversation.
the reason that I’m no longer welcome in so much of Heaven!”
“Actually, I was under the impression that we were a little bit more than that,” Dean chimes in from behind him. They both turn around and find Dean poking his head out from the room, looking strained and anxious, his voice all scratchy. “Cas, would you come in here?”
“You know, I’m not trying to baby you,” Dean says, fingers poking around the edges of it. “Head wounds are serious business, man, I just wanna make sure that you’re alright.”
“And what about
“You can stay here while you sort some things out,” she tells him, “but starting today, you need to start looking for somewhere else to live.”
When Lisa answers the door, a cannonball of shaggy black hair ducks underneath her arm and barrels into Dean’s chest at approximately ten miles an hour, strong enough to knock him back and nearly off the top step if Cas didn’t catch him with a subtle hand on the small of his back.
“Oh.” Cas lowers his arm, looking disappointed. “I just came to see how you were doing.”
“Guns don’t work on me,” he reminds Dean as though he didn’t learn that lesson the very night they met.
Jerking his head, Dean says, “Cas, we’re going to Wyoming.”
First, Dean stops by the nearest CVS. After rummaging through Lisa’s frankly pathetic first aid collection, he decided to stock up on useful shit at the drugstore—and not just because his shoulder really hurt something fierce this morning, but also because he needs to refill what he keeps in the trunk.
“Dean, stop talking.”
“Yes,” he says, his eyes closing briefly. “Why then? What changed? I mean, why
Dean glanced up and saw he was smiling, a rare joke; Dean watched indulgently as he circled around to this side of the workbench. Casual as anything, Cas touched the plank to steady it while Dean sliced along the penciled line.
“Why was he stalking you?” Ben asks.
When Cas fell to Earth, he learned immediately about bad things: Cold and hunger, using shaded parks as bathrooms, what knives feel like on skin and how it travels up your arm when you’re the one doing the stabbing, being tired, being tired and not being able to sleep. Being very awake, with all the hours of the day in front of you. Using the bathroom and police sirens when you’re doing twenty in a forty-five. Lust.
’s human! And that’s your big hang-up? That’s what’s got you acting like a damn hermit? It’s pathetic.”
“Yes, and used up the last of my grace to do it,” Cas says, sucking in a sharp breath when sitting up straighter tugs at his lacerated ribcage. “Not that I could heal this anyway. These are cuts from an angel blade.”
“What?”
“He didn’t survive, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean’s heart goes cold. Not for Jimmy: He knows what words Cas is dancing around, what surrounding circumstances led to Jimmy’s demise. “What Lucifer did, it was on an atomic level. I think...I
“What is it?” Cas asks, his eyes flickering over Dean’s face. “Something’s on your mind.”
Lisa presses her lips together, looking him over; then she shrugs off the door and envelopes him in a warm, tight hug. Dean’s startled at first, but then he wraps his arm around her back and squeezes her to his body. It goes on for longer than is perhaps customary at the end of a dinner party. Lisa smiles when she steps back and cups his cheek in one hand.
“I am just...worried about you,” Cas says, taking deep, audible breaths. “You have a tendency to rush into things half-cocked, especially when you’re upset.”
There’s not much whiskey left, and they finish it in silence. They play a half-hearted card game afterwards, and Dean fiddles with a Queen while he talks Cas into a detour to see an arboretum about an hour and a half west, if they shift their plans with Bobby a little later tomorrow. He figures Cas would like that, and Dean just feels like seeing him smile. If he can’t do much right, at least he can still do that.
Charlie set up the pull-out couch for the two of them, but they don’t get a chance to use it. Around six, when they’re trying to teach Cas how to play Call of Duty: WWII, Dean’s phone starts ringing against his hip. Charlie coaxes Cas into another round while Dean takes it in the other room.
“We’ve met several times before,” Cas informs him. “I was at your soccer game two months ago.”
It makes Dean wonder if he can culture Cas about other things.
As soon as they finish dessert, Dean starts making his excuses. Cas, perhaps as punishment for Dean convincing him to wear a nice blazer for the occasion, hasn’t taken off his jacket the entire evening; but he does hold out Dean’s coat for him to shrug into at the door. Lisa’s frowning.
“Gross, Cas. That’s gross.”
Dean takes a step back, giving Cas space to think. Running his hand through his hair again, he examines the canvas.
army, Dean,” Cas says. He doesn’t quite roll his eyes, but he manages to look exasperated as he turns his gaze on him. “But yes, I suppose it is.”
The head rolls off a foot or so away. It’s leaking ghoul juice all over Lisa’s pristine green grass.
“What?” he asks.
“You’re also my best friend,” Dean breathes, offhanded. His lips bump along Cas’s jaw and underneath it. “And we’re alone ‘til morning.”
Dean glares. Cas looks him up and down and stiffly says, “I like your...skirt.”
Tonight the hellhounds only have him for a few minutes before there’s a blinding white light in the front room. Dean turns his head. Huh. That doesn’t usually happen.
“In your words,” Cas said, twisting the tie around his fingers and using it to pull him closer. “I believe we can find something to pass the time…”
Dean laughs. “Oh, would you look at that. Lesbian ghouls. Who says we’ve seen everything?”
“You're getting your sleeves all wet, Cas,” Dean says after awhile, which is when he looks up and realizes Dean’s silently watching him work. His head tilts. “Come over here.”
Dean catches his wrist as he’s pulling away, keeps Cas close enough that he can turn his head just so and kiss him for real. Cas leans his forehead against the side of Dean’s. He kisses his cheek and slides back into the passenger seat, and Dean shifts into drive.
Here’s the part that Cas was fighting so fiercely against: Dean swallows a bottle of sleeping pills and lays down on their bed with his arms splayed out. Cas sits by his side while Dean’s falling asleep.
But for now, Dean and Sam are drinking those beers and trading stories about their childhoods. Sam likes the one where Dean ditched him all afternoon, acted like a dick and long story short he ended up apologizing and telling him it was them together, them always. They carved their initials into the car that day, just kids. Dean likes that story too, but it’s too sappy to take top spot for him and he always ends it by telling Sam to shut up and when’s he going to change into his skirt, anyway?
“There,” she announces, whirling on the others behind her. “That’s the weapon.”
Dean drops the gifts to the couch in horror.
!” and throws Dean across the room with one flick of his wrist. Dean hits the dungeon wall and crumples. In the same second, the door flies open with a deafening crash.
“Do you want to play poker?” Cas asks, glancing over his shoulder at him. He notes Dean’s state of half-undress and looks away.
“Then what did you mean, Cas? ‘Cause I’m starting to think that you didn’t think this through at
“Of course. Like Sam found another way?”
“No hot jerky this time,” she notes, accidentally ringing him up for the habanero twice. “No Combos either.”
“You’re the one who spends every day wandering this place!”
“Like a front door. Well, through the secret back door,” Dean says, shooting Cas a smirk like he does whenever he makes a dirty joke, but as usual Cas doesn’t get it. “It’s less conspicuous than going off the side of the road.”
“Yes,” Cas says. “So get this—”
When they climb in, Dean doesn’t immediately pull off the curb. Key in the ignition, they sit in the dark for a moment and listen to the radio playing on low. Dean looks at the steering wheel. Cas looks at Dean. He seems to know that Dean’s thoughts are especially loud, because after awhile of the same love song playing quietly on the radio, Cas cups his far cheek in one hand and coaxes him closer, and he presses his lips to Dean’s temple. He lingers there, sweet.
“I’ll come back later,” Cas assures him. “They have a lot to set back in order first before I can be of any use.”
Lisa kisses him on the cheek when she leaves for work today, whether because she’s glad that he’s home safe or because she won’t see him until late, he doesn’t know. He really is trying to give what he can because he doesn’t like feeling like a freeloader: He spends the morning out in the yard, pulling up Lisa’s failed garden and replanting it with bulbs he found when he was clearing out the garage last week; Lisa knew he got nervous leaving Baby out on the curb all the time in those first few days.
“You don’t even know him, Dean.”
“Yeah.” Dean sniffs, wipes his eyes. “Whew! Shit. I didn’t mean to get all weepy in a burger joint.”
He mimes the flapping of wings with his hands. Cas bristles.
“Dean and I are still working out the details,” she says, this time cutting
He tries to say something, grits his teeth against the pain in his ribs instead. He thumps the floor as hard as he can from this angle to let Dean know he’s still alive.
Squeezing him around the middle, Dean asks, “You would do that?” with his voice pitching suggestively and he laughs harder when Cas digs his fingers into his sides. He’s not awake enough for banter; getting comfortable again, Cas is just going successfully back to sleep when it happens again, and he sits up heaving a huge sigh.
Cas’s eyes are steady and sure. Stormy, but resolute.
“Not gonna make much progress on the house with unstable support like that,” Neal commented, running his finger down the jagged line.
“Every day,” Dean agrees, nodding. “Every goddamn minute of every goddamn day.”
like that when you were in love with somebody. If you were willingly vulnerable with someone, and not just in the biblical sense.
Whatever it is makes Hannah hiss at him and unsubtly step on his foot.
The club is brightly lit with cool tones and very, very loud. Cas never realized how extraordinarily head-splitting bars were before, in part because Dean prefers quiet, cheaper places and in part because as an angel he didn’t notice it so much, busy paying attention to several other dimensions and the Winchesters every time.
“Dean?”
“You have no idea,” he says, equally engrossed.
“She had a family thing and had to go,” Charlie says. She pushes her phone at him again. “Blonde cheerleader. What do you think?”
Dean’s swinging a beer from one hand and dressed down in sweatpants now, and Cas instinctively scoots over on the bed so Dean has room to sit down next to him.
Ben scared of him.
“We can sand it down later,” Dean assured him.
“Cas!”
Cas’s hand is making soothing trails through his hair; thankfully this doesn’t make them stop. “Yes?”
can’t?” Too quick to step away, Cas grabs him by the shirt and yanks him close. He’s practically growling when he says, “Up until I met you, I spent
“You can’t check back in, dumbass,” he says indignantly. “You’ve just been stabbed! Like, a
Cas sighs and gives into Dean; he knows a losing battle when he sees one. Besides, moving his mouth to Dean’s mouth is more telling than he could ever be, and so he turns his head and he lets Dean know how much he loves him.
This gives him pause.
“What?” Cas said. He shook Dean’s shoulder. “Dean.
He nods. “Yes.”
Dean’s head jerks. “No. My friend Cas asked me to come pick something up for him.”
“And you...want me to come with you?”
“Yeah, yeah,” he mumbles. “I’m not gonna lose it if you leave me alone for a couple of minutes. Go.”
“I’m fine,” he says for the millionth time. “Look!”
“The same reason I do everything,” Cas says. His eyes roll back to Dean. “The war.”
Dean stares for so long that Cas looks down to see if he’s spilled beer all over his Mickey Mouse tee with a neck so relaxed he’s positive the Winchesters have been passing this back and forth since one of their many high schools, at least. The fabric is almost unbearably thin. At least there’s no tears, although he suspects that has more to do with nimble threadwork as he fingers a stray yarn poking out of the hem. Dean lifts his chin as Cas is contemplating his ability to sew, and whether he’d give him a crash course. It might be nice to have a hobby that has to do with his hands.
“Coming from the man who has a crisis of faith every other day with an
“You know, I’m still not used to having to come find you,” Dean says, and Cas jumps, turning around. His eyes go wide. Dean ducks through the doorway and inside and scans the ceiling that’s leeching fake light; Dean finally bought those artificial bulbs he needed to let this garden flourish. “I keep finding myself praying. I forget you can’t hear that anymore.”
favor this year by opening a giant hole in the floor to swallow him whole.
He used to think that made it...not real, somehow. He defaulted to Cas because Cas was
“Hey now, I’m trying to help!”
“Why are you so hellbent on disbelieving me?” Cas demands.
“So,” Benny says. “What’s the verdict?”
Dean sways further into his arms, and Cas pauses for a fraction of a second. Then he squeezes Dean tighter, and presses another deliberate kiss just behind his collarbone. Cas’s first two fingers find his chin, and he turns Dean’s face toward him, leaning in, mouth just hovering near; and it’s Dean who reaches to grab the side of his neck and pull him in the rest of the way.
,” Cas implores. “Are you alright?”
“What I told you in the basement. That was true,” the monster starts. “My nest tried to kill me years ago for running off with a woman. They killed her. Or at least, I thought that they did. Turns out they just turned her as one last
“When I told you that I was in love with you,” Cas clarifies.
. He suspects already that he sat on this vampire news—three
“We’re caging him,” Hannah says. “Go! You’re only getting in the way.”
This time, when he gets to Heaven, he follows the road with Cas’s voice flickering on the radio again but it goes smoother without anyone on his tail. He takes a hard left when Cas says he’s come to the appropriate turnoff and Cas knows, then, where to find him: He appears in that holy tax accountant getup and takes Dean’s elbow, and then they’re out of Dean’s personal Heaven and over in corporate instead. In Cas’s line of work, corporate is a dense forest with a deep fog encroaching in from all sides of the encampment where Cas has brought them right inside the inner limits. In the distance, a mansion lit up dark purples and blues rises up out of the fog.
According to Dean, the appropriate things for Cas to bring on a simple hunt are four guns (hidden in various places on his body), two retractable knives, an angel blade up his sleeve and Chrysler Building-sized amount of celestial firepower. From what Cas is surmising as he watches Dean get ready from the doorway, the appropriate things for Dean to bring to a meeting with the disgraced ex-King of Hell is about two guns, an angel blade and a skyscraper short of that double-standard.
“You guys seem like you’re having fun,” he says, standing so close he’s practically trapping Cas in the hallway.
“Mom!” he shouts. “I’m late, I’m late!”
“I know. I still wanted to do it, Dean. For you,” he says. “That’s why I opened Purgatory and shut down Heaven...although it didn’t go down the way I expected it to.”
“You are acting like an ill-mannered child,” he mutters in a low, mocking voice. He perks up when sees Samandriel pass. “Hey pipsqueak! Do you have any angelic food around here?”
“That’s OK. You have a very good reason.”
. Cas gained permission, not a filter.
“I suppose,” he sighs, more because he doesn’t want to talk it about any longer. He remembers he has a half-gone joint in the ashtray and digs his skull-and-flowers lighter out of the drawer. “Maybe it’s all good news. If the angels are focused on going after Metatron, then they’re not going to spend their energy trying to find me.”
“So you’re human now,” says Dean when they’ve settled a little. “That means…”
“I didn’t want space!” he shouts, and bites his tongue hard enough to make him wince.
“Yes.” Cas frowns. “I hear it’s polite. And it’s cold out here.”
He takes his drink and goes away.
—his mind just keeps shutting down and asking to look at the ceiling for a few hours until he inevitably slips into a nap.
The waitress comes back with a bloody mary for Dean, who’s decided to indulge since he’s been cutting back just slightly the past couple of weeks, disliking the roiling discomfort of hangovers without all the amenities of home, like a fridge for cold water and a bathroom sink that doesn’t put him face-to-face with the dark night. Having to puke in a port-a-potty or public YMCA shower sucks too.
“I do have that tape, by the way,” Cas says, leaning over him to get it out of the drawer.
“Why?”
can’t handle that.”
“I just want you to be safe,” she says, her eyes big and shining. “Okay? And that means ground rules.”
“That’s awesome,” he mutters finally. “That’s really freaking awesome.”
“Excuse me?”
Cas’s face goes stony and he gets up, pushes her aside and slams the siren back against the wall.
A flash of teeth—Dean’s smile, pleased at Cas’s dig in a way that’s threatening to make itself at home in the center of his ribs. Already that feeling has started a blazing fire and warms its hands by their bedside every night, in disbelief after years of thinking he wanted this alone.
He ushers him inside, looking around up and down the street to see if anyone’s watching before he shuts the door. Once they’re alone, Cas turns around and walks into the living room.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean mutters under his breath. “Lis, how far is Arcadia from here?”
“You’re here because you’re human,” Cas realizes.
“Not bad, man. Not bad at all.”
“Tough break,” she says, clicking her tongue sympathetically. “You could...tell him you like him.”
“Dean,” he rumbles. His voice seems lower, maybe just because Dean’s ear is right against his throat when he kisses underneath Cas’s jaw like this.
“Will Ben—?” he asks minutes later.
“Nah,” says Dean, munching on more cold french toast. Cas watches in mild horror as Dean soaks his bread in syrup until it’s dripping with it. “He’s all bark, no bite anymore.”
He skips the next song on the mixtape, a Zepp track he’s heard one too many times as of late. The spare seconds of silence between songs makes the rustle of air more obvious than it would otherwise have been. Without turning around, Dean says, “Hey, Cas, what do you—
“I believe that nice-looking man was hitting on me,” he announces gravely.
“Dean,” she says carefully, and the hope in his chest closes up like a big metal door sliding in front of his heart. Dean doesn’t have any room for more disappointment, not tonight, so he just nods.
them. Cas can also do some pretty freaky things with his grace. It doesn’t hurt that he can read Dean’s mind while they’re going at it either.
“That’s good news, right?” says Dean. Heart sinking, he makes himself tack on, “Do you have to head out and, you know, deal with it?”
Dean glances up, brows furrowing together.
“Amnesiac woman kills her husband…” Dean mutters, jolting forward in his chair. Lisa turns around, and he gestures behind at the TV. “Lis, can you turn that up?”
“OK. I want to show you something.” A smile threatens to overtake him, but as usual he wins over his impulses. “Let me check your leg first.”
, literally the first night they met
The siren’s compound is more like a cabin in the woods, but that’s just too fucking easy. It’s definitely got wards up the wazoo, and not just the anti-angel kind. Dean scans all the potential entryways and exits, memorizing them down pat. He never realized how much he relied on Cas to zap his ass out of harm’s way until the possibility was off the table: At least with a siren there’s no chance they’ll accidentally swap spit (again), so he’ll be safe from the most irritating aspects of monster fighting i.e. uneven supernatural powers. There
know anything about what’s going on here?”
“Would you stop arguing about fucking cartoons with me, man? I’m trying to tell you something,” Dean says over a third beer and an extremely tempting pile of mozzarella sticks. Cas did not know fried food could be so incredible. “I—I found out something. Well, Krissy and her friends did. They were on a case last week and she ran into a couple of angels.”
raised.
“Oh. Awesome.”
The side street where he left the Impala is coming up, but ahead, someone it takes a second to recognize is rounding the corner already.
is on. You’ve been bugging me to watch it.”
, Sam said once,
“Why don’t you tell us why you came to town?” Lisa says, overly polite. Oh, Dean is so in trouble later. He doesn’t want Cas to field this one either, though.
“Please don’t hold me still like that,” he says stiffly.
“What the hell are you doing, Dean? Trusting a vampire?”
“What?” Dean asks. Like a confused animal, he kisses Cas again short and sweet, begging for a response because he’s been faced with sudden withdrawal. The urge to soothe him rises and crests.
“So you’re, what? Gonna watch movies all night?”
It’s dark out tonight, plenty of stars but almost no moon. The streetlamp on the curb is the only flickering light, and it’s been on the fritz lately: It washes Cas’s face in light, then he’s hidden again. The shifting shadows change the lines and angles of his face, over and over turns him into someone new.
Dean hangs up and shakes his head at them.
Dean reached a hand out, and after shooting him a look, Cas came around to his side. Dean grabbed his jacket to pull him closer when he came in range. He put Cas’s hand on the saw where it would be safe—“Not that a power saw could hurt you, right?” Dean asked, half-hoping Cas would confirm whether that was true just to satisfy his curiosity—and the other steadying the plank; Dean touched his back when he moved around to show him how to guide the wood. Cas kept glancing at him every couple of seconds, which made him a pretty shitty student. He didn’t wait long enough for Dean to step back or pull his safety goggles off the top of his head, and Dean ended up jumping out of the way, spitting out sawdust. He didn’t have time to steady the wood, either; Cas cut a big jagged line clean through the best log they had.
That made Cas smile, and his hands landed on the tie Dean was wearing. Classic fake-reporter getup for an akurra case they worked last week near the northern state border.
“I’m not.”
“Could you just, like,
“Bloodsuckers,” Dean says. “Twenty miles that way. Are you in or are you out?”
He focuses more closely on screwing in the light. Cas helps him down with a hand on his elbow when he’s done, and Dean hauls the ladder over to install the lights along the front lawn that will go on automatically when they detect motion. They go down the row together, shuffling the ladder along the line.
“OK first of all, don’t say anything
Cas hesitates before he puts down his pool cue, and turns around in Dean’s arms. They’re standing so close that their noses are almost brushing. Cas grips the front of Dean’s jacket and pulls him in.
Dean sneaks a look at him.
“I’ll be back soon,” Cas promises.
“I heard that you hunted,” Cas says.
Dean’s hands drop to his lap. He studies Cas’s face, eyes darting all over it from inches away. Cas watches back and focuses on even breathing.
out in the hallway?” Sam asks after a moment.
The early autumn is chilly enough that his car isn’t baking in the sun, despite how long it’s sat out underneath it. Dean throws their stuff in the trunk and holds Cas’s door open for him, because he still looks smug and happy every time he slides into shotgun and Dean kind of likes seeing that up close.
“Sorry, I’m—Sorry,” Dean gasps before he can say anything else. Cas frowns, leaning away, but he’s sitting on the other side of the bed so he can’t go very far. Dean runs a trembling hand over his face and finds the strength to sit up a little bit more. “Were you busy this time?”
“Dean,” she says, surprised. She sounds just like he thought she would. “Oh, thank god! Are you alright?”
Dean sizes him up one last time. Maybe he’s going completely senile in his semi-retirement, but Dean wants to believe him. Benny’s right, he didn’t have to come back, and he didn’t have to tell Dean about the angels’ plans either. This could have just as easily ended in a fight. Dean wrestles with himself about it, and then he laughs disbelievingly, shaking his head.
“I have time to myself, is all I mean.” Cas pauses. “I’ve never really had that before.”
In the ensuing quiet, Dean can’t look him in the eye: He glances at the pavement, then the back wall, then the car. Then back at Cas’s face. He’s just watching Dean. He should get that confused look tattooed on his face, Dean thinks with relish.
“Tell me what I gotta do to lock this place down,” Dean snarls.
“I told you, I’m taking it up with Jody this time,” Cas tells the girl. “No! You already went over this with Dean—You’re going to turn eighteen soon, Claire...Yes, I know. Claire!...Fine. Call me when you arrive at Kaia’s. Goodbye.”
A horrifying vision of Cas from 2014 appears in Dean’s mind. He’s already this close to buying a drug rug every time they go to Walmart.
“Sometimes, I do think we’re two halves of a whole.”
“I’m going to have to pass,” Dean says. “Sorry. Got to do some reading on a vamp thing that Garth put me onto, so…”
Dean’s smile is huge, climbing onto the bed.
“Well I didn’t bring you back here to flirt with you, sweetheart,” she purrs. Sophie’s gaze flicks over him and seems to find something lacking; her upper lip curls delicately into a sneer. Cas crosses his arms.
“Cash or credit?” she drawls.
“I assume I don’t have to tell you, your brother would want you to be happy,” Cas says.
“Don’t get all up in his business, sister,” Dean says. “It’s better than you guys picking pointless fights for all of eternity because you don’t have anything else to do.”
Cas frowns.
Dean tires as they’re finishing a third movie. It’s very late by now, and he’s yawning every couple of minutes. Dean shuts the TV when the credits roll, patting Cas’s thigh as he gets up.
There’s apparently no need for Cas to join the conversation, so he doesn’t; he hums idly to show that he’s listening and flips another page in his book. Dean’s probably halfway down the hall before he shouts—he curses—something slams. Mind turning over, Cas sits up in his chair and shut his book, instantly on high alert but—
