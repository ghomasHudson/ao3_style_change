Sherlock found his companions again to be Hermione and the Longbottom boy, who was exclaiming with joy as his toad plopped onto his lap. The boy next to him was a talkative one of average intelligence by the name of Dean. But all the jabbering between the other three ceased as the boats began to move.
After that complete disaster, the blond boy had retreated to the back of the line where even the hulking fellows that had accompanied him didn’t follow after such a public spurning.
Peppered with kisses and shoulder claps— none of which he understood at
Magic wasn’t too bad after all.
. There always is. That someone who understands you— who isn’t just like you, but will fit into your life like a puzzle piece.” She paused again with the briefest of glances to his father with warmth in her eyes, “And that person will make all the difference. With that person— those people, the rest of the lot will simply melt into the background.”
He hadn’t taken that well.
His mother and father pulled him aside and rapidly gave him their love, and continued to remind him to eat properly, do his best to be polite and write often. Mycroft was however, completely ignoring the exchange as his eyes bounced over the crowd of people. Searching for someone clearly but who? An enemy no doubt. He could hardly imagine his brother having actual friends.
His mind flying out of control, Sherlock found it hard to climb out of bed and get properly dressed. He dressed in his best dress clothes, cleaned and pressed by his mother the previous  morning. If he looked closely enough, he could see the fine stains of tears along the folds of the pants.
can push me into a house,” he puffed slightly, chewing his last bits of strawberries
While the other boys blew out their candles, the room only lit by the warm fireplace against the back wall of the large room, Sherlock let the light die out of its own accord. While watching the wax drain down the sides of the candle, his thoughts drifted him into a sleep filled with wonderful depths of the color blue.
Other than some bit about a corridor that would lead to horrible death, the entire bit seems rather silly. Third floor corridor did he say? Wonder where that would be.
He watched the rain tap against the windowpane, his breath fogging the cold glass as his chest breathed evenly, in and out. On the surface, one would expect him to be perfectly relaxed, but you could never rely on his exterior for his emotional well-being. He almost laughed at the thought.
They were
Taking his usual spot at the Slytherin table, Mycroft gave his complementary nods to other purebloods of importance, Cassius Warrington and Marcus Flint among them. He expected there would be an influx of several new Slytherin students as many heirs of the sacred 28 were now of age to enter Hogwarts. He was both intrigued and a bit sick about this fact. More chess pieces to move.
Meeting
Not for the pride in socializing like normal boys his age, and not even really for the books.
His theory was that in order to survive the years to come, he would need observations on hand of his fellow students. Names, deductions that he could use to fire back at any overly friendly folks or some of the more nefarious types. He made a particular point on noting Mycroft’s muggleborn friend-- a relationship he would be sure to keep a particular eye on. Anything he could learn concerning his brother was sure to help in the future.
“William?” Mother’s voice was quick and sharp, staring at him from across the table in a rather dissatisfied fashion. He
He would be here for a while.
“I will
Mycroft ignored the mirror comment entirely, “I don’t like my name shortened,” he quipped as he pulled himself into the carriage after Gregory, squeezing in next to him to avoid Irene’s nefarious advances. She didn’t seem the least bit upset by this however, taking it in stride and running her fingers through Anthea’s golden brown hair. He ignored the action all together and focused his attention on the shrinking boats below him as they neared the castle.
He quickly gathered an assortment of useful books for her to read over the next two months before they would board the train, assuring her as the pile grew higher, that he would personally get them for her out of his allowance for the month. She rather aggressively protested it—
As his mother glided up the steps into the bank, the door whisked open and  a goblin at the entrance bowed deeply with some sort of murmuring along the lines of
A crisp, white parchment envelope labeled to
Why Gregory Lastrade and Mycroft Holmes we’re friends at all, let alone best mates, was beyond him. Gregory was a quiet type, much like himself, but he had an infectious humor and in his element was quiet the extrovert. He loved sports and was quiet average on most subjects, save Defense Against the Dark Arts. That was his best subject. He also had an eye for people. While Mycroft was nearly his complete opposite. Regardless, like magnets, the two rarely separated, the nature of their friendship even a mystery to themselves.
By the sound of his mothers
“Superior if you ask me but sure. A nightmare,” he rolled his eyes, flopping into the chair in proper form and taking sullen bites from his bowl.
The pen clicking stopped.
As the afternoon ended the pair exchanged farewells with the promise that he would regularly owl her for updates on her studies, and his own, until they arranged to meet at the train. She seemed quite pleased with herself in finding someone companionable so quickly—
He couldn’t help but wonder what would life be like as a true muggle? What would he be doing with his life?
Mycroft gave him a scathing look and attempted to disregard the comment all together. “I don't wish to encourage him to push himself into my social life at school Gregory,” He paused for a moment as he stopped to stand in the line of students loading into the carriages. “He needs to find a place of his own here.”
He had done his best to attempt to listen into Hermione’s conversation— she was as much speaking to herself as anyone else in the room as her companions were completely silent, and only the Longbottom boy was hanging on her every word. Forgotten his name by this point. Did it start with an M?
for Merlin’s sake! Shouldn’t he be concerned with dating and all that lot? Or at least studying something mildly interesting.
He found the most vacant spot among his fellow Ravenclaw students and watched as the Longbottom boy from the train was sorted into Gryffindor— that floored him completely. He had bet completely on Hufflepuff. The next name of note was the Malfoy boy he had met in the entrance way before they entered the hall. He had quickly deduced that the boy had his eyes fixated on who whispers said was the famed Harry Potter, obviously intent on gaining his friendship.
He had simply told the boy to stop trying to be a mold of his father and start a life here as he would want it to be. That and that disastrous display of complete arrogance and absolutely not a drop of savviness that being a Slytherin required, the green would not be a good fit for him.
had finally went home, with
Never.
“My dear boy,” she whispered back, soothing her hand over his hair, “Not everyone will. You will find some people who just can’t understand you,” For a brief moment she paused and he began to feel quite dejected at this. “But, there will be
for Christmas holidays. He didn’t think it was quite Christmas yet but he hadn’t been really counting the days anymore.
She took his hand quite taken aback by his very
Which he wasn’t. Not in the slightest.
She sat back with that with a sigh, but didn’t take her eyes off him for a moment until the carriage lurched to a stop. He knew that Irene would be no good for Sherlock. She was a curious girl, with lightning sharp wits and incredible cunning. Her ambition was not for herself however, but more to find out how to make each person dangle like a puppet. That’s where her interest in Sherlock would be— how to make Mycroft dance on a string.
and a barely masked sigh he assumed he had failed.
Being the true disaster at organizing that he was, his trunk had been a bit of a mess until his father woke early, sending him to eat his morning breakfast while he organized the rest of his trunk. It was a very superficially cheerful meal, his mother fixing his favorite breakfast, eggs and waffles with maple syrup. He indulged her in guessing what his house would be; after his father joined their meal, they both began to tell him wonderful stories that he did his best to listen to— moving staircases with faux stairs, the plethora of photographs that would travel from painting to painting— the different ways one would have to access their house common room. It was all too much, and not enough at the same time.
She didn’t answer for a bit, only ruffling his hair. “I am proud of you Sherlock. You did well today. I dare say you made a friend.” That last bit was paired with a cheeky grin.
Not that his mother knew about that bit.
The rest of their ride was quiet and Sherlock found himself focusing intently on the way his mother gently rested her arm around his shoulder, her head laid just enough against his own to feel the comfort of pressure. For just a moment, in the comfort of the enclosed cabby, the car just slightly vibrating from the movement down the bumpy road, all there was to see was a family; a father and eldest son chatting about a boarding school the cabby couldn’t possibly understand, and a mother and her youngest boy enjoying their last few moments together before Christmas Holidays.
“Oh that’s right,” Irene exclaimed with a grin, turning her attention away from Anthea with a glee shining in her green eyes. “We finally get to meet the youngest Holmes.”
He answered with only a nod in response to which she raised her eyebrows even higher with a tilt of her head that was
He felt true warmth then. The first he had felt in a while and slowly but surely the tears began to slow to a stop, his stained face drying. They were quiet for a while. Just laying against one another in comforting, companionable silence. “Will you read a bit more?” He asked quietly.
Mycroft’s eyes snapped back to him at that. Hit a nerve then? “I’m sorry I haven’t the slightest what you mean.”
She had used his name. The name he preferred.
He had been under that sweaty, dark hat for nearly twenty minutes it seems as the Sorting Hat continued to argue with him at length.
He placed himself between Anthea and Cassius, Irene taking the spot directly next to Anthea and gave her the majority of her attention during their wait for the new students. A curious relationship, the two girls had. It was a deep bond surly, but a very different, coy relationship that few girls seem to share. He chose not to focus on that and instead began to play his newly developed favorite past time.
Hermione and Longbottom re-entered the compartment— the boy in a near sobbing state. Haven’t found the toad then. Hermione patted his back lightly before returning to her seat beside him, murmuring words of encouragement to the boy. At this point neither he nor the boy across from him had spoken a word. The one action he took the entire ride was in fact to lower the window, letting a cool breeze into the compartment, shuffling his well placed blond hair, his deep blue eyes not wavering from the passing landscape of the British Isles.
He may have Hermione. By the size of her letters alone he gathered that she would be most interested in forming a friendship, but he doubted quiet highly that they would be sorted into the same house.
He had spared only a glance at her parents—
“Well,” he laughed dryly, “at least Professor Dumbledore can respect my proper name.”
Obviously he was quite bad at that bit.
He mentally noted the fact and fixed his attention to the doors of the Great Hall, swinging open wide for the throng of first years lead by Professor McGonagall, Hagrid bringing up the rear. Near the tail end of the students he spied his brother, again in arms length of the bushy haired girl. He was followed by a quiet obvious Muggleborn boy who seemed to walk with a slight limp, leaning heavily on what appeared to be more of an old stick than a walking cane.
“Better change that to half a month,” John smiled and Sherlock hummed.
“I don’t seem to recall,” Sherlock said, almost too innocently, “It was quite the break-in…now, I need your hands,” he walked out of the room with Greg sighing behind him.
“Yes,” Greg said as if just remembering, “Some friends of Thor’s will be by about lunchtime, New York Time.”
John mumbled sleepily as he was pulled from sleep. While everyone was more or less on Eastern Standard Time, John had a rather rough day yesterday. John blinked as Sherlock walked around the bed towards the door, “Sherlock?” he asked, looking at the clock on the side table, “What are you doing up at this hour?”
“Sounds familiar,” Loki looked at Thor smirking.
Mrs. Hudson giggled, “I think Sherlock’s come close to smacking Thor with that hammer of his,” she stated, “Poor Sherlock has difficulties with people who don’t use their brains, but he knows it’s not particularly Thor’s fault. Loki, however, Sherlock has been able to get along better with. He’s even started explaining how to create a Mind Palace.”
Sherlock nodded and stood up before walking out of the flat. John looked at his nephew and moved some of his black hair behind his ear. Loki’s eyes opened slowly. And his eyes were green. John smiled, “Hello Loki,” John said, “How are you doing?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Just because I love John does not mean my mind is going to be illogical,” he stated, “I state my deductions on what information I have. John has yet to show me that his knowledge and skills have been matched. So, therefore, I must conclude that the Agent’s chances are quite high.”
“And how did Vé tell you to handle it?” Frigga asked.
“Thank you, Thor’s friend,” John glared at Thor.
John gave Frigga the Tesseract, “When you do return,” he stated, “Could you ask Heimdall about a man named James Moriarty? We just need to know if he’s dead.”
“Hello boys,” Mrs. Hudson smiled as she discarded, “Dinner should be ready shortly. Your mother is an absolute
John and Sherlock both raised an eyebrow, “You would have to move this entire building, Mrs. Hudson,
“Lady in th…Excalibur?!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed shocked.
“No…” Coulson said slowly, “But no one without access is able to get in. We would know if the code was hacked.”
John raised an eyebrow, “Thor,” John held his forehead with the hand not holding Mjolnir, “I love you, I truly do, but you did not get your mother’s brain. What color are your brother’s eyes?”
“Was your brother not the older?” Sherlock questioned.
“That was one time and you saw right through it,” Sherlock stated.
John turned as Mycroft walked up the stairs before returning his full attention to his injured nephew, “Mycroft,” John acknowledged.
days. Any less and the spells could disappear before they’re completely finished causing him to return to how he was before. Am I understood, Fury?”
“Would you have preferred being woken up at three in the morning New York Time?” Greg raised an eyebrow before walking out, “Goodnight!”
Thor winced, “I’m…honestly still not sure where Father was going with all that,” Thor stated.
“Does
“Since when is Thor ever on time?” Loki snarked.
New York was in complete chaos. Aliens. Magic. Gods. Nothing made sense. But the giant light beaming down onto Stark Tower caught everyone’s attention, “Oh what now?!” Tony yelled from the circle he and his newly formed team somehow formed.
Thor huffed, “Glad to have you back, Brother,” he mocked.
Greg and Coulson did as told. Greg glanced at the pancakes as Sherlock’s text came to mind.
“I’ve read up on you and your friend,” Tony stated.
This wasn’t how they expected things to go, but it is what it is and while John could easily move them all back, he’d rather not play tug of war with a building and S.H.I.E.L.D and Tony Stark on the other end. That would just become an endless loop and would just be quite tiresome and annoying. John took the mug Sherlock handed him. They shared a look and Sherlock just nodded, obviously coming to the same conclusion. They were in New York now. And they were just going to have to deal with it.
“No,” John stated, “You’ve actually improved and
Sherlock didn’t answer as a flush was heard. John deadpanned while Loki facepalmed, “THOR ODINSON!” John yelled.
“Honestly, Sherlock,” John stated, “Only you could start off searching for a lost cat and wind up stopping a bank heist,” he, Sherlock, Loki, and Thor walked into the building, “Why did you even want to find a lost cat? Have you started smoking again?”
“Please!” John called.
Frigga smiled as she sipped her tea, “I see,” she said calmly, “So Vé’s Courted noticed Vé was getting antsy with my arrival approaching and decided to distract all three of them.”
John walked passed their guests with Loki, “Where’s Thor?” John questioned.
“To tell Loki once he was old enough and let him sort it out himself,” Odin grumbled.
“Five in the morning in London, John,” Greg sounded downright giddy, “But we’re not in London.”
“Jane!” Thor boomed.
John and Sherlock just stared, “You really want close eyes on us, don’t you?” John deadpanned, “Fine, but be warned. Sherlock is stubborn and his mother is even worse.”
“I thought Fury didn’t know about us till New York?” John questioned.
John rolled his eyes, “I’m not all-seeing,” he stated, “I can tell you how Loki’s mind became controlled, but not why.”
John gave Sherlock a look, but dropped the matter, “Fury is obviously going to shoot for moving us,” he stated, “Did I-”
Thor groaned, “The…others will be here in an hour or so…” he stated.
John glared before smirking as Greg yelped and loudly fell down the stairs. John looked at his calm nephew, “What?” Loki asked, innocently.
Sherlock huffed, “It’s for an-”
“Threats on my life?” Tony questioned.
Sherlock nodded and stood up, “Thor,” John looked at his oldest nephew, “You may stay and see your friend for a few hours, but you are to return to my residence before dinner, understood?”
“My lab,” Sherlock stated.
“And what did you do?” Frigga asked.
“Wha-” Sherlock’s question was never finished because the two were suddenly gone.
“Going to be perfectly honest,” Sherlock stated, “Think I stuck them in that jar of acid a week ago.”
The elderly lady smiled, “I’ll make sure the press and possible clients are pushed away,” she walked away.
“Thank you Thor’s other friend,” John said, “I will learn all your names later. Now, Thor, why in heaven’s name did you, for
what you can do, I’m pretty sure he’s going to finish that list by month’s end.”
Sherlock stood up, “I’m making coffee,” he stated, “Want some, John?”
Sherlock hummed, “How old, exactly, are you, John?” he asked.
bring yourselves and the Tesseract to my house. Am I understood, Thor?”
?” he asked.
Well, dead silent until Thor whimpered, “That your dad, Pointbreak?” Tony questioned.
Sherlock hummed and sat on the arm of the couch by Loki’s head. John took Sherlock not saying anything as a cue to continue, “While I disagreed with my brothers, our father agreed,” John said bitterly, “I had no choice, but to join my brothers. Whilst claiming the Realms, Odin, somehow, fathered a daughter. He never did tell us who her mother was,” John gripped annoyed, “She was given the name Hela. Hela Odinsdottir. She grew up within the wars.
Mrs. Hudson opened the door, smiling, “Hello,” she grinned at the Avengers and Nick Fury, “John should be back soon. Sherlock’s here though. Upstairs and I’ll bring tea,” she then walked away from the door.
Bruce had on a rather large sweater and followed Mrs. Hudson with his eyes. Everyone soon walked upstairs, “Brother, dear,” everyone looked towards the kitchen, “Why is there a
John snorted, “That’s the slowest I’ve seen you, Mycroft,” he stated, “Do tell Mrs. Hudson we’ll be back. Thank you.”
John hummed and slowly removed his hands from Loki’s head, “As I stated before, I’ve never held any interest in ruling Asgard,” he stated, “I’ll defend it to my dying breath, but I’ve always favored healing and magic. When Vili and Odin started claiming and conquering the other Realms, I was against it. It didn’t matter how they tried to sugarcoat it for me and the people. It was
Loki walked out of the room. He looked more relieved after talking with Coulson, “You can take your Courted, Uncle,” Loki stated, “I can flash myself.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John said.
Sherlock hummed, “I thought Hungary was too easy,” he stated, “Guess that’s why.”
“Why?” Sherlock questioned, “You would be a good king.”
“Wait…” Mycroft stated causing everyone to look at him, “I threatened a god?!”
Sherlock snorted, “I suppose that explains why I never found more cameras in the flat after I became internationally famous,” he smirked.
John chuckled, “Suppose we may want to thank Mycroft for that,” he stated, “Now, back to what I was saying before, Love. Did I miss anything important on the list? Now that Fury
“Move you?” Mrs. Hudson questioned.
Meanwhile, up in Asgard, Frigga was
“I might,” Mrs. Hudson stated, “What for? I know Sherlock has been experimenting with acids lately.”
“That doesn’t give your brain the right to go on vacation,” Loki stated.
“I’m aware,” Sherlock smirked, “The pancakes closest to your usual seat, have, not only the blood substitute but also quite a bit of laxatives,” Fury paled, “I would reckon by the amount you’ve eaten, they should be kicking in right about…” Fury’s stomach made a horrible noise, “Now,” he smirked as Fury ran for the door, “May I have your assistance now, Lestrade?”
All the Avengers, including Hulk, glanced at each other. John snapped his fingers and Loki was suddenly beside his brother. Loki glared and went to move, but was stuck, “What?!”
“Taser?” John raised an eyebrow at his nephew, “Should I be worried, Nephew?”
After a few minutes, John was sitting beside Loki on the couch, Mycroft, despite Sherlock’s glare, was sitting in John’s chair, and Tony, Steve, and Bruce took the chairs from the kitchen. After a few seconds, Fury spoke up, “What happened?”
John stared at the spot that his friend once was before walking into the kitchen, “Uncle,” John looked at Thor, “I…wanted to request a favor. Since I’ll be staying here on Midgard for a while.”
“Who the hell was on the United Kingdom watch?!” Fury exclaimed as he stormed by the two of them.
“You have it,” John smirked, “We didn’t hide anything from the public. Whether or not they believed us or not is their decision. Everything on Moriarty is on the blog. Call it an unofficial report.”
John hummed, lying back down on his pillow, “No toxins,” he mumbled.
“Fuck.”
Thor made a face, “Uh…” he said.
“What if I made the job interesting?” Tony asked.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John stated, “Do you happen to have any scissors?”
John sighed, “Loki is not Asgardian by blood,” he stated, “While most of the Nine Realms gladly accepted the peace Odin delivered, one was still rather bitter about all the war. Jotunheim. They declined peace and continued to war on Asgard. I willingly fought in that war,” John lifted Loki’s head and looked at the back of his neck, “Odin found Loki as a babe. Abandoned,” John suddenly glared, “While Odin took him in…he had planned to use him as a
Thor looked down and handed his hammer to his uncle. John took it easily, “Eyes up,” Thor did so, “Now…” John tossed the hammer once before smacking his other nephew in the head with it, sending him flying into Stark Tower, “Was that so hard?”
“Ask your brother,” John stated, “You said an hour until your friends arrived, yes?”
Thor winced, “I didn’t-” Thor cut himself off when John held his hand up.
.  I’ve never liked war,” Sherlock made a face and John chuckled, “I may fight in it, Sherlock, and I
“So…Loki was under the same thing as Barton?” Natasha asked.
That’s what made John lose it and join his nephew and Tony on the floor. John calmed a few moments later, “Never change, Love,” John wiped a tear from his eye, “Never change.”
“He…” Thor suddenly blushed, “…Told me to do what I do best…” he sagged.
“Err…yes,” Sherlock stated.
“Learn to use your brain,” Loki deadpanned, “Or a door for that matter.”
“My brother can’t raise a potted plant, let alone two boys meant to rule two kingdoms,” John stated, “I’m beginning to doubt my declining the throne.”
“How long have you been here?” John was dreading the answer.
Loki flinched, already having an idea that he did something bad, but John glared so hard that Mycroft almost gulped and Sherlock smirked. He’s loving this other side of his boyfriend, “
“Yes…now, what color were your brother’s eyes just now?” John asked.
“But you love me,” Mycroft smirked.
“You bloody madman,” Mycroft walked out of the kitchen.
in the refrigerator?!”
tracked you during your little Network rampage. He never said anything because he assumed Fury knew because it was basically public England knowledge.”
“Please,” John stated, “We’re going to be crowded in a few moments.”
Sherlock smirked at his brother as he walked with his boyfriend and the Americans.
John snorted, “Asgard and Midgard years are quite different,” he stated, “On Asgard, I am as I appear, but Midgard is something else entirely. I estimate I’m about 2,600 current Midgard years. Your kind like to change your calendars quite often.”
Frigga nodded, “I just wanted to check on you,” she stated, “Vé will make sure you’re taken care of,” John mumbled something under his breath and Frigga chuckled, “And Thor, dear,” Thor looked at his mother, “Behave and actually learn a thing or two.”
“Let me rephrase then,” Mycroft stated, “How many
John held his hand out without stopping his combing of Loki’s hair. Thor gave the glowing blue cube to his uncle, “Thank you,” the cube suddenly vanished, “Now, my window.”
It was dead silent until Mycroft snorted, “Welcome to the Holmes Household,” he stated.
“I’d like to know why you’ve brought him to London,” Mycroft stated.
“I’ll know when we’re home,” John stated, “You have thirty minutes Thor. Am I understood?”
“Hungary?” John questioned, “Why would he want to know about that spot specifically?”
The door opened and only then did Clint and Steve run into each other. John looked at them, cutting himself off mid-word to Fury. He shook his head, “Agent Coulson will be fine,” he stated, “Fully healed, but he’ll need to remain on bed rest for two days,” he gave Fury a look, “And I mean two
“Language!” Steve yelled before jumping off the roof.
, just has never had the materials or reason to do so.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and gave his boyfriend a look. John raised an eyebrow at him. Sherlock nodded and stood up, “This way,” Thor slowly stood up and followed Sherlock into a room.
“I rather like my head on my shoulders, thank you,” Sherlock deadpanned.
“What?” Sherlock looked at John confused, “John, if you’re wanting to go to New York, not even Mycroft would be able to-”
John sighed, “I’ll look her up and see if we can’t find her phone number,” he stated, “She’ll have to wait till Fury decides to move us or not.”
Mrs. Hudson brightened, “Ever played Rummy?” she asked.
Hulk jumped on an Alien Whale and began to smash. Clint and Natasha glanced at each other. Natasha jumped on an alien hoverboard as it went by and threw said alien off it, “Get the Tesseract,” Clint said to Thor as he aimed an arrow.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Ignoring emotions or not, I’ve always disliked you,” he stated.
Sherlock hummed, “Should I warn and inform Mrs. Hudson?” he asked.
“That’s…wait, wait,” Tony shook his head, “You researched me.”
Loki blinked, “I…did something bad, didn’t I?”
“Quite the sum too,” Greg smiled, “I’ll just get John to get you up then,” with that said, Greg left.
“Knowing Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson stated, “He originally found something easy for him that wouldn’t take more than an hour, but then they will probably run into something much, much higher on Sherlock’s Interesting Scale and he’ll forget the first thing he was doing and the reason he was out in the first place. The new case will have John’s own morals take over and he’ll forget why he was trying to get Sherlock back home. Loki will probably be a mix of the two and completely forget as well, or remind them of your arrival. I don’t particularly know him or his brother very well. Thor, quite honestly, probably forgot your arrival as soon as he ran out the door,” Frigga chuckled and nodded, “So, I’d give them arriving back by dinner and seeing you before panicking. Or, of course, Loki may remind them and they’ll be here in an hour or so.”
“Well,” John smiled, “He doesn’t seem to mind the Asgardian need and delight of adrenaline rush.”
“…The people wouldn’t respect him other than a Prince…” Odin muttered.
“He didn’t,” Greg smirked, “But Coulson was the Handler of those two. He wanted to know why the building blew up if it wasn’t them. He researched you both
“Really?” Mycroft asked Sherlock.
“Where is Loki?” Fury asked.
Thor looked at the window, “Ah…how…do I fix this?” he asked.
Loki smiled softly, “It’s been…confusing,” Loki admitted, “But everyone I’ve met so far appears to be understanding.”
. Goddess of Death was what she became. She was only 13, Sherlock. Frigga explained that she, herself, feared her own stepdaughter. She wanted me there to remind Hela and everyone that Odin was not the original successor to the throne. He was the youngest of three.”
John hummed, “Thor, Mjolnir,” John held his hand out to the blonde.
Mrs. Hudson came up with tea and blinked, “Boys?” she questioned, confused then looking at the groceries on the ground.
“That’s what I deleted….”
Sherlock just stared out the window for what felt like hours before he groaned and fell back against his pillow and pulled John’s over his face. It was too early (London and New York time) for this shit, “I know you’re still on the line, Lestrade,” Sherlock lifted the pillow slightly, “You have five minutes to get here and explain before you have John and Mrs. Hudson on your arse,” Sherlock turned as the door to the room opened.
“I’ll explain once your brother and his new friends arrive,” John stated, removing his hand.
“Ehh, I can read some writing on the wall,” John said, “Might improve later, but right now, I wanted a change of pace,” he ran his hand over the back of his nephew’s neck, “Anything?”
“He has most of it,” Greg stated, “Or…I did,” Greg smirked, “The only issues he’s actually having issues with is the people of your Homeless Network that I didn’t know about, but his UK Team are to find all of them. A punishment of sorts. And since he had to move the entire building anyway, he figured asking Mrs. Hudson would be a moot point,” John opened his mouth, “I tried to warn him,” Greg argued, “But he, apparently, doesn’t listen very well. Anyway, back to your list,” Greg stated, “Move this entire building, Mrs. Hudson,
John relaxed, “Yeah, I know,” he stated, “Still sorry though.”
with a panicked look on his face. I think he knew there wasn’t actually going to be a battle.”
Loki huffed, “How many myths are you associated with?” Mycroft asked.
“No,” Sherlock stated, “New York is under attack by aliens,” John went wide eyed, “And apparently Norse Mythology is real.”
“What if we moved you both to New York?” Fury asked.
“Do you want to try my patience for a
“…What the hell did we just enter?” Tony muttered.
“Hi Mother! When did you get here?”
Thor pouted, “Uncle was already mad at me,” he stated.
Frigga smirked, “Forget something, Vé?” she asked as she calmly discarded while setting her cards down face up, “Gin.”
“Much better than I expected to be honest,” Mrs. Hudson stated, “Sherlock is usually one to only believe logic. He, as he put it, deleted all emotion. I think it was like pulling teeth for John to get that man to admit to himself that he loved him,” Mrs. Hudson sighed, “So the fact that he’s just rolling with this is both shocking, but also sweet. Sherlock actually cares greatly for John if he can just ignore all the logic that he clings to.”
“And if we do all that?” Fury asked.
healing her husband, “One would think you’d have learned to listen to your brother, Dear,” she stated.
John grabbed Sherlock’s shoulder, “Then I’m about to break your Mind Palace, Love,” he stated.
“Green,” Thor said instantly.
should Jotunheim attack them again,” he took a deep breath, “I shouldn’t have just given my brother a warning and advice. I should’ve taken Loki and hightailed it out of there,” John sighed and gently set Loki’s head on the couch again, “I don’t know why I trusted my brother to raise children. He failed miserably the first time. And now I need to clean up his mess. Again!” John groaned, “I’m basically Odin’s Mycroft.”
“What devices do you see on me?” Sherlock questioned, “While you are big in the US, Mr. Stark, you are not that big in the UK. The only thing that made big news overseas is your being Iron Man. And even that was a fleeting story. Barely even perked my interest. Everything I just stated was all learned by observation.”
“You’re the one who woke us up at midnight time here,” John snapped.
Sherlock appeared to be trying to comprehend this. John chuckled, “Did I just now break you, Love?” he asked.
, that if I had taken the throne, I would have joined them. Hela was only ten Asgard years,” Sherlock looked neutral, but then again, Moriarty, they’re pretty sure, did the same thing, “After the funerals, my passing the throne formally to Odin, and his Coronation, I introduced my brother to my friend and fellow magic user, Lady Frigga, and then I completely disappeared. I wanted no more to do with the nonsensical wars my brother was causing.
“Has been flushing our toilet for the past thirty minutes,” Sherlock stated, “Would someone please pull him away?”
“Go back to sleep, John,” Sherlock stated, “I just realized a marvelous revenge plan against Fury,” a smile wormed its way onto his face.
“Your idea of interesting and mine are two completely different things,” Sherlock stated.
Greg blinked as he walked into the S.H.I.E.L.D briefing room. While his job was always set, he was still required to show up for morning briefings. What he wasn’t expecting, however, was a table full of pancakes, “Uh…” Greg looked at Coulson, “Uh…this normal?”
Hiding Rosie’s face in his shoulder, John flipped off Sherlock with his free hand. Sherlock did not disappoint in his response.
“You two . . . Trouble.” He pointed an accusatory finger at Sherlock before glancing down at his daughter. “You’re both
“Case?”
More broken, yes, but in their brokenness, they fit together perfectly. Every time they shattered it was hard to forget that singing completion that swept him off his feet when they came back together, entwined in ease and loveliness.
“John . . . you’re crying.”
Never again.
He’d heard this vow once, and it had been both salvation for his soul and poison in his lungs depending on when he’d thought about it. Now, it was a salve on his burns and cuts and gunshot wounds; it was beautiful in that it soothed Rosie as well, for he felt her relax against them, drained from her emotional expenses and ready for bed once more.
Then it was strained,
It was that exact curly-haired problem that caused John his current strife.
He did no such thing.
And so maybe that meant he would risk his heart breaking, too.
“You called me ‘Dad,’” he said softly, reverently, petting back her hair. “Did you know you did that?”
“No, don’t lie to me—we’ve had our rows, Sherlock, and not the kind one has with a bastardly piece of machinery.”
It was rare, this. Rare, but routine and lovely and harmoniously quiet.
A bullet pierced the sky, the ground, the world—as each bullet did. Always would.
The detective sighed in defeat. “Fine. We’ll start with a mind playhouse, if you think her so incapable.”
It was the opposite, and it was
Perhaps that is the beauty of them, the ever-hungry veteran doctor and the deceivingly fragile detective; in their cores, they are survivors, with mismatching wounds and jagged, venomous edges. They bare the scars of different battles, and yet, within each other, a mirror is found; a reflection of that which is loveable on equal grounds with that which is evil.
And there it was—that innate feeling that he could somehow hold Sherlock’s pulse in his hands, place it within his heart and listen to it as a calming melody before sleep came to take him. John knew that, if he asked, Sherlock would find a way to capture his heartbeat in a glass case for John’s viewing pleasure, or trade the rest of his heart’s pumps for a few of John’s—he’d command a mountain to move in John’s name and force it to smile while doing so.
A disastrous thud sounded from behind John. With a hand braced at the back of Rosie’s head and his feet planting themselves firmly in anticipation, John looked back to see . . .
Yes, it would seem that John Watson never felt more real, more tangible in his skin, in his body, than when he was touching Sherlock Holmes.
“Lestrade told me the entire department had been unable to make a break. I thought we had a serial killer on our hands. God, at least some sort of sadistic deviant.” Sherlock looked at him sidelong, dejected and worn down like a librarian that hadn’t seen their bed in weeks. “John, this is hardly a
Until his knees were up against a stiffer, darker leather; until he felt metal beams dig into his shins; until he saw the imperfect skies of the heavens in eyes that never stopped moving, calculating, thinking.
“Incorrect; not entirely unfounded, but . . . not entirely true.” John could only focus on the man’s words if he was staring at the distinct fleck of chocolate among the drained blue of Sherlock’s eyes, so he zeroed in on this mark that was gorgeous in its abnormality. “I do not hate my heart so much as I do not understand it. I sometimes do not know why it hurts, or in what manner it
“You’re a good father,” Sherlock said. “Let’s not ruin that by standing around like a half-wit, yes?”
Rarer still are the victims of life who find each other.
“Dad!”
“You are a marvel,” Sherlock breathed in a way that meant he wasn’t thinking about filtering his words.
“Have I ever told you that it’s the same for me?”
, they said.
And then it was tied again, some would argue stronger than before.
Sherlock, master musician though he was, never made a more beautiful sound than when he was laughing. It was the melody of the wind on which birds flew, the tumble of the oceans as they crashed their percussive heartbeat against the shores. John wanted to bottle up that sound and take it everywhere with him, if not to loose it into the world and risk losing it, then to merely carry it around and know it was there.
Sherlock was trying to control full-bodied laughs and failing entirely, loosing his chortles and snorts into John’s shoulder. “I’ll have to try that next Easter,” he said between gasps.
“I just mean that—I’m glad. That you’re good with her. Because I can’t— I don’t want— Living without either of you isn’t an option, I’m afraid.”
“I thought— You were—” Rosie’s voice, wet with tears, was nearly incomprehensible. “I had a bad dream, and I thought you were . . . hurt.”
all good, and that patched things up, but it didn’t
Sherlock pulled back quickly, glowering in a way that had John wrestling back a smile. “Cut off my arm instead. I can work without that. Not the slides.”
That had always been true. It was just the ease with which he accepted it that had occasionally come into question. But not anymore, because Sherlock balanced him out—the hot air that rose when the cold air dropped, the promise of smoke when fire seared the ground, the moon that sometimes hung around during the day to banter with the sun.
And so he took another step.
God help him.
“Is Sher—” Rosie caught sight of the man she’d wanted to see, and her lip began a great wobble in her effort to hold back tears. She was out of her bed in an instant, throwing herself at Sherlock’s legs and holding on like a frightened koala.
Rosie beamed while her father considered the murder of his flatmate. “Sherlock!”
Saving Sherlock was bittersweet, for the instincts were not his own; reaching for his gun, feeling the trigger against the pad of his finger like the poisonous lips of a forgotten lover, zeroing his vision down to the mark—they were engrained in a place John could not reach. Everything else, however, was John: waiting until Sherlock was invariably in danger so as not to draw blood where it was not necessary; wanting to save him because Sherlock was a startlingly fresh breath of air in London’s stifling haze.
“She’s just a girl in my class,” Rosie murmured. “Didn’t think much of it.”
The mystery of the human body was the first thing to be taken from John Watson.
You experience the ground-shattering thunder of a firearm going off for the first time, and you are unable to sleep for days; you lose a loved one, feel their death in your soul as if it were your own, and you are helpless to find that piece of your heart once more; you say the wrong thing, have a bad thought, and suddenly you are the bringer of your own demise—the causer of your own destruction.
In the kitchen, up against the spot where the coffee maker had once made a short stop in its trek across the counter, John stopped Sherlock before the latter could get too far.
He hated it most of all when a well-dressed, sardonic bastard mapped out the timeline of his pain with perfect precision.
are you doing?”
“You’re no different, John.”
So John stood, and he braced his foot in the ocean, waiting to watch himself disintegrate into the roiling waters.
“She called you—”
“Has something happened?”
No, not somewhere; right behind the dip of his waist, moulded to his shape like a sheath to a blade. Because Sherlock’s touches were not
Rosie came running up to Sherlock in her nimble manner. She tripped only once, but it was enough to send John’s heart into a frenzy. He couldn’t tell what she was trying—
“She . . .” Sherlock grinned, pressing it into John’s hair. God have mercy, why hadn’t they been doing this the whole
Rosie was properly scolded—or embarrassed, judging the way she was fiddling with Sherlock’s housecoat. John thought there wasn’t a more perfect sight in the world; his daughter, all golden hair and light pinks and greys in her clothes, sat in the lap of his . . . Sherlock, all sleek blacks and blues and browns.
Fake deaths and drug problems notwithstanding, John had known Sherlock for the better part of a decade. He knew when those eyes, coloured like the London sky, were pinned on him, even when he couldn’t see it for himself. It was the same in reverse—there was no one in all the world who knew him like Sherlock Holmes did.
“I think I’d remember a name as stupid as that.”
Sherlock needed no explanation. “John, we both had perfectly good parents. You want to know what happened to us? Let’s make a list. The Holmeses: three emotionally stunted children, varying in occupation from government official to consulting detective to loosely insane criminal mastermind; The Watsons: two slightly damaged children, one being an adrenaline-addicted, veteran soldier and the other an emotionally unavailable drunk.” He brushed his violinist’s fingers along John’s jaw, and within that touch was a world’s worth of fragility and strength both to be learned from and shared. “We will love her. We already do. And John, if she somehow becomes a terrible combination of all five of those things, we will work through it.”
That tether was cut.
His leg was the loss that pierced his heart the fiercest—unless you were John, of course, and could catalogue how decidedly
Rosie received two kisses, one on each temple from two different pairs of lips, before she was allowed to sleep in peace.
After two flights of stairs, they enter the hallway. Sherlock leads the way to Boone’s cell and stands looking in through the bars.
“Yeah, it does.”
This time Sherlock broke the kiss. John fixed his eyes on him again, a bit nervously. He had responded. Something was about to happen.
Eye contact can have strong effect. They’re both thinking about the same thing, and they both know they’re thinking about the same thing. The fall. A scream. Laying as still as possible. A desperate hand searching for a pulse. A pained voice,
He bounds up the steps, into the kitchen and over to the fridge, quickly locating the vial he spotted earlier that morning. Fixing a careful grip on it, he heads back downstairs, a little more slowly this time.
“No, but you have wasted police time and caused your family unnecessary pain.”
“John.” Sherlock closed his eyes briefly, the tears spilling over. “I will always be with you.” He bowed his head further, his nose almost touching John’s. “I’ll never do that to you again.”
“Rosie has expressed an interest in mugs,” he tells her. “She might like to look at some of yours.”
John still didn’t know what emotions he was seeing in Sherlock’s face, but for what might have been the first time, he realized he
“So you think Neville is alive?”
“It rained yesterday,” John murmurs sleepily. “Won’t the blood have washed away?”
John placed his other hand over the heart Sherlock liked to pretend he didn’t have. The strong beating from within continually assured him that this was real. Sherlock was real. And with each beat, life began to flood back into him, filling every part of him that had been vacant only an hour before.
John snickers.
Very slowly, his mind started to catch up.
“The man you know as Boone is actually Neville St. Clair. He faked his death. There was no murder. You can let him go.”
(not there)
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. “John… I’m so sorry.” There was so much pain in his voice, just like there had been during the phone call. “If there had been any other way… any other way, I would have…”
“John,” Sherlock repeated, more urgently. “Are you okay?”
“Nope.” Sherlock turns around as they reach the bridge, amusement clear on his face. John stops abruptly to avoid crashing into him. The detective reaches into his pocket and pulls out his little magnifying glass, holding it up triumphantly.
This case is based off of The Man With the Twisted Lip
Not get married? Then again, he never really did get married in the first place. Not officially. And Rosie would have complicated things. Ditching Mary at the altar would have been messy.
Yes. Contemplative. That word could describe Sherlock in any situation, really.
“Couldn’t resist that bit about his nails, though, could you?” John remarks.
“Four days ago, a passerby reported a man acting suspiciously by this bridge. The police found Hugh Boone there, indeed acting suspiciously. He seemed to be having some sort of fit. Staring over the railing and hitting his face. Took him in for questioning, photographed the scene. All they got from him was his name.
His footsteps aren’t the only sound echoing through the flat. As he approaches the kitchen, he can hear another pair of footsteps.
“You little trickster.” John chuckles, and Rosie giggles louder. “Are you ready for breakfast?”
He tries to speak, but Sherlock interrupts.
Sherlock grinned down at him.
John kissed him again with the same intensity. He started to shake again, but he ignored it and held their faces together, still at a bit of an awkward angle.
“All right.” John sits in his chair, leans back, and looks at Sherlock expectantly. “Walk me through it.”
The sigh from Mycroft was so dramatic that he might as well have been right there.
I love you, Sherlock. I…”
Stars.
Lestrade’s jaw drops.
“You asked for one more miracle.”
John carefully closed his hand around Sherlock’s wrist, almost afraid that if he held on too hard, he would disappear.
“Hmm?” Sherlock places one of the slides under the microscope. “Say what?”
“I don’t know.” John shrugs sheepishly. “They kept exchanging glances.”
“What-“ John put his hand to his forehead again, pinching more skin between his fingers than he thought possible. “You’re
In the sitting room, Sherlock is walking in circles, softly speaking deductions to himself. His gaze passes over John in the doorway, and he momentarily snaps out of his mind palace.
Losing the smirk, Mycroft nodded once and turned. John followed numbly.
Laughter still in his throat, he leaned a little further and gave Sherlock a quick peck on the lips.
John found himself clenching his fists again. All he wanted to do right now was punch Mycroft. After all, Mycroft had gotten them into this mess. If Mycroft had just kept his mouth shut and not fed Moriarty all that information…
“Since when have you cared about fun?”
“The game is on.”
“Hmm,” is all Sherlock says.
John takes a moment to search his eyes, both wondering how Sherlock could possibly be unsure about his happiness and knowing exactly why.
Run and never look back?
He starts to turn his head away, but John keeps his hand steady, and Sherlock refocuses his eyes.
If his mind was truly empty, he would cease to exist, wouldn’t he?
Sherlock smiles softly at the way John’s hair is ruffled with sleep. There’s nothing wrong with the way John works so hard at his hair these days, but well… as Mrs. Hudson would say, it ages him. Not as much as that godforsaken mustache had aged him, but still… paired with his much more defined wrinkles, John’s appearance has changed quite a bit in the last couple years. Not that Sherlock’s hasn’t. But Sherlock’s never been one to pay too much attention to his own face.
“Who needs a blog post?” John jokes. “I’ll just take a picture of this when we’re finished and leave the readers to figure out what happened themselves.”
John’s eyes go wide, and he looks between Boone- no, Neville St. Clair- and Sherlock with amazement. This, he understands, is why Sherlock keeps him out of the loop about the final pieces of a case, and why John lets him. All for this moment. All for the
“Dreadful,” Sherlock goes on. He turns to face the two guards standing at the door of the holding cell. “Is this how you treat your prisoners?”
Sherlock pauses with one hand on the door to the stairwell, with John just behind him. He turns to find one of the guards from before speed-walking to them.
“Don’t. Be.” His throat constricted, but he forced the last word out. “Dead.”
“It’s not,” Sherlock concedes. “The titles are meaningless in the grand scheme of things.”
“Before you go in there,” he murmured, “I need to make sure you understand that not a word of this is to be mentioned.”
“Well.” He chuckled. “Now people will definitely talk.”
“Thank you, John.”
Slowly, dejectedly, John turned away from Mycroft and entered the void again.
Sherlock
Neville St. Clair stares at him, his battered mouth opening and closing like a fish.
didn’t think there would ever come a day when Sherlock would be teaching him to waltz. But here they were, and John wouldn’t have it any other way.
Before the cab has even come to a full stop, Sherlock’s already out of it. John just shakes his head and pulls a few bills out of his wallet. He already knew this would happen.
With that, he climbs into the cab.
“It was only a reference point. Do what you will with the information provided.” Sherlock glances quickly at John before speaking to Molly again. “Sometimes you just have to take a chance, because the chance is gone before you know it.”
He was really beginning to cry now, but it couldn’t stop him from continuing to plead.
Unsure if it’s a question, a statement, or if he’s getting ready to say something, John turns his head slightly up and to the right. Sherlock gives him the same sideways glance, his expression warm. Serious, but content.
“How is that any better?” John demands.
“Having you both here again. Seeing you find your footing again. Just… living our lives.” She gives him a warm smile. “Life goes on, doesn’t it?”
With his head resting on John’s, Sherlock watches as Rosie shoves a few blocks under his armchair, and peeks under it, giggling. He smiles softly, then turns his head to press a gentle kiss to John’s hairline.
“Seriously?”
But minutes pass and John remains without distress. Sherlock relaxes, but he still doesn’t move. He lets his eyes wander to John’s left hand, the ringless finger.
John shrugs, his arms crossed in front of him. “Any ideas?”
With the phone to his ear, he sighed loudly, then snapped, “What do you want?”
“Back to the bridge,” Sherlock answers.
“That guy who was just here. He’s not a sociopath. Or a psychopath, or a criminal mastermind. He’s not living a double life.”
Sherlock pulls away just enough to see John’s face.
As Sherlock searches for somewhere this new block might fit, John suggests another title with no intention of actually using it.
Two hours later, they’ve all wound down. Sherlock and John are back upstairs with Rosie in the sitting room, the fire crackling softly in the fireplace. Rosie is calmly playing with her blocks, all spread out between the armchairs. Every few minutes, she brings a random block over to Sherlock and John, who have settled on the floor a few feet away, building their own structure with the blocks Rosie keeps giving them.
“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,” Sherlock reminds him cheekily. “Today we’re eliminating the impossible.”
“I don’t need to know
“Call Greg.” He pulls the slide out from under the microscope and begins arranging all the equipment he’s used into a somewhat orderly fashion. “Tell him Neville St. Clair is alive, and that we’ll be by to explain everything as soon as we pay a quick visit to Boone.”
“I know.” John closed his eyes, breathed in and out, opened them again. “I’ll tell her today.”
He asked this gently, with deep concern, and John just didn’t know how to answer. He didn’t know how to process any of what had just happened. One moment they were doing a purely educational waltz, and the next, they were here, trembling hands and tingling lips and pounding hearts.
“Sherlock!” With a hand against his shoulder, John leaned his head on Sherlock’s chest, gasping for breath. “Oh my god… Sherlock…”
“Well, I’ve been examining the photos of the crime scene, and I’ve picked up on a discrepancy. We’ll have to go by to inspect it again tomorrow.”
Sherlock complies, holding Rosie up like an airplane with careful gliding movements as they walk down the stairs. She squeals with laughter, and John follows, unable to contain a small smile. The first couple of times Sherlock had done this, it made John nervous, but now he trusts Sherlock with his daughter completely, and finds himself looking forward to watching this little ritual the two of them have.
The bandages removed, Sherlock observes split knuckles, then slowly turns the hand over to see the palm. A few small scabs near the base of the fingers. The higher up on the fingers, the worse the scabs. He turns the hand again to see the fingertips, and finds them rubbed raw, two fingernails broken, infected wounds.
Sherlock met his eyes.
“Yeah, I am,” Sherlock responds lazily, continuing up the steps without slowing his pace. “Ask Greg Lestrade.”
“Yes.” He peers into the microscope, searching for antigens. “Yes, you did.”
“Hmm.” Sherlock switches out the microscope slide with the bridge blood for the one with Boone’s. “Mocking us how?”
“Well, yes.” The more John goes on, the more silly he feels. “But I feel like a lot of it was in response to things we said and did.”
their lips slamming together again and again, at various intensities and angles, their hands and arms fumbling, struggling to hold each other closer despite already being chest to chest, desperate, desperate indeed, desperate to get back all the time they had lost.
“But?” John knows well enough that there’s always more.
Sherlock really was full of surprises since his return. Not that John minded. It kept him on his feet.
Go to the aquarium first instead of Mary. Try to talk Sherlock down. If all else fails, not blame Sherlock. Or maybe… maybe just say one last meaningful goodbye to Mary before it all plays out.
“Just grabbing something,” he calls out, taking quick strides toward the stairs.
In the kitchen, he finds John and Rosie at the table, a plate with pears and another with orange slices between them. Sherlock watches as John feeds Rosie a bite of pear, then grabs an orange slice for himself. Rosie finishes chewing the pear and starts babbling for more.
“Three days ago, Neville St. Clair was reported missing. That’s when we come on the scene. Asking around, family, friends, when and where last seen. Leads him right to this area of town. Time checks out that he would be on this bridge just before the call. Later that evening, Neville’s coat is found washed up on the shore, but no body.”
“Sure.”
When John comes back to the sitting room, Sherlock’s left his mind palace.
Boone gasps in pain as Sherlock begins to peel off the bandages. Sherlock makes a conscious effort to be more gentle, knowing that if one of his two ideas is correct, he’s not dealing with a murderer.
On the contrary, Sherlock couldn’t seem to stop talking. He was saying something now about how he figured out thirteen different ways things could have gone once he was on the roof.
John wasn’t sure how long he stood there, hiding his face as if he could hide from what he’d done. It probably wasn’t more than a few seconds. Sherlock never wasted any time.
Sherlock let him sit for a moment, as he sank into the oxymoronic river of his feelings. Waves crashed all around him, temperatures ranging from bone-chilling cold to blissful warmth, some of them gentle and others dragging him violently across the shore and into their depths.
The conversation with Lestrade goes by in a blur.
John barely has time to raise an eyebrow before Sherlock is at the door, saying, “Come along, John.”
Pain consumed him. He clutched Sherlock’s coat again and began to shake his head, almost subconsciously. “You were dead on the ground! Your head was covered in blood! You…”
They kiss again, and again, and again, each time sweeter than the last. They find each other’s faces with their free hands, their other hands still linked between them.
His voice was close to monotone, despite the reassuring words, and he tripped over a few of them. He paused for a moment and cleared his throat. When he spoke again, his speech had improved, but he still sounded like he was rattling off deductions.
And that was all they could say. Over and over.
“Mr. St. Clair, am I right?”
Sherlock reaches out to accept another block from Rosie, which he carefully places at the highest point of their structure.
“I- I don’t understand,” John stuttered. “How- you…” He continued to stare at Sherlock, his eyes wide and his breathing ragged. “I
“He wouldn’t have had time.” Sherlock begins rattling off information again. “He was found on the bridge and immediately taken in for questioning. So the question remains. Where is the body?”
He stops and looks straight at John, who slowly blinks, his eyelids getting heavier.
“Sorry- what?”
“To fall from that bridge into the river, he must have drowned if the impact didn’t already kill him. But Scotland Yard has been searching for his body for a few days now and there’s no sign of it.”
He didn’t go back with Mrs. Hudson. He couldn’t bring himself to go back to 221B. Couldn’t stand the hollow feeling that haunted him in Sherlock’s absence.
“Go on.” Sherlock hands him the glass, and John takes it, eyeing him suspiciously. “Go look at the wood and let me know what you find.”
“Hi!”
But then Sherlock shifts his eyes just a little and finds himself looking at John, and John looking at him. They both immediately avert their eyes. Sherlock pauses his speech for half a second- what was he talking about? Oh yeah, Neville’s hands- and chatters on, unable to stop himself from sneaking another glance at John, who apparently chose that exact moment to do the exact same thing. He doesn’t look away this time.
“Can I ask you something, John?” Sherlock murmurs.
“How are you, Molly?” John asks, hoping his face has returned to its normal color.
“Plane!” Rosie insists.
“You…”
short.
John dropped his head between his knees and gritted his teeth. Then he got to his feet.
“Of course, it’s entirely up to you,” Sherlock states. “Just thought I’d let you know that he’s a nice person who seems to genuinely like you.”
“Spare me.” The buildup was fun, but Sherlock’s not playing anymore. “Your fingers are all scraped up and splintered, you were quite desperately scratching at the wood- but not because you were falling to your death. No, your mistake was that you scratched away from the edge. Enough to fool Scotland Yard, but not enough to fool me. Thought you had a little more time, so you tried to bash up your face a bit, make it unrecognizable. You weren’t as successful with that as you wanted to be, so you picked a fight in the intake cell. Next day, you’re reported missing, but by that time no one can recognize you by your face. They trace your presence to the bridge, find the marks, remember the suspicious man, giving them a potential murderer, search the river, find your coat, it checks out.
