“Oh, are you here about Caleb? Because I called Agent Worley to let him know that it was all a misunderstanding — I left a voicemail. Caleb came home yesterday afternoon. He’s in his room right now … grounded … but I can have him come to the door if you’d like. CALEB,” she called up the stairs before Dean could stop her.
The hunter pulled out his phone and brought up a list of local shops that sold bait and tackle. Simmzy’s was the name of the closest one.
When they arrived, their first stop was at the County Sheriff’s office, though their conversation with Sheriff Dillon yielded little that was of use other than where they might find the only witness to the victim’s sudden and mysterious disappearance.
“But it’s more than that. Dean … it’s almost like whatever took Angela knew we were here … knew we’d likely find this car and report it to the police.”
Dean sighed and pulled his phone out of his pocket. All arguments aside for why he didn’t want to pull Sam in yet, Dean knew his brother could track down Melly’s information faster than he could. In the meantime, Dean could hit up the bait shop.
Dean, not really. And a real moment like this one felt even more impossible now than it ever had before. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been under the djinn’s spell, but he knew it had likely been close to a day. How much of that time had the djinn been draining his blood? He wasn’t even sure when he’d been taken. Was it in the woods with Melly? Or back at the police station, or perhaps even earlier?
The hunter plunked down onto the bed to take his boots off the rest of the way from a safely seated position. As he fidgeted with the laces, he asked Cas, without meeting his eyes, “So, um, I know we’ve got work to do tomorrow morning, but … would you want to watch a little TV or something first? While I get some water in me?”
“I’ll follow you.” And with that she turned on her heel and walked briskly to the Sam’s non-descript back up car.
“After Lucifer stabbed you, I wrapped you in a sheet and I burned your body and buried your ashes. And I can’t  … I can’t do that again Cas. I barely survived doing it the last time. I mean it, I practically tried to die. If Billy would’ve let me, I would have,” Dean finished with a shout.
“Damn it Cas,” growled Dean, hearing Cas’ voicemail message yet again as he pulled into the small town on the edge of the national park.
Dean came out of the bar and — now Cas was sure he was imagining things — cast his friend a guilty glance before tossing him the keys to the Impala. “Would you mind driving us back?” he asked.
“It’s just … nothing I do can change any of this. Literally, even when I try to do nothing, things still go wrong. How do you win when the game’s rigged by friggin’ God himself?”
It was a testament to how wrecked Sam was after killing Rowena that he hadn’t seen through Dean’s glib attitude yet, or at least hadn’t called out his forced smiles and humor for the mask they were.
Apparently getting out of bed and out of the bunker hadn’t been a magic bullet to dissipate the depression that had kept him half comatose for much of the past several weeks.
Still moving in a dream like state, Dean’s feet practically floated down the stairs. He gazed at the sturdy steel chair in from him, bolted to the ground, and at the leather restraints on the arms, legs, and around the back, his mind not quite able to process what he was seeing.
“Yeah, well, this is my mess Sam. And yeah, it is my fault. I’m the one who was a dick to him. I’m the one who let him walk out that door.”
If so, it wasn’t fair to Dean, or to Lee, Cas tried to tell himself. Dean and Cas were friends, good friends, family even. That was more than Cas likely even deserved from the hunter after the various ways he’d disappointed him over the years, he thought glumly. And Dean deserved to be loved. He did deserve to be happy. If they could find a way through this Chuck situation, maybe Dean could find some happiness here in Texhoma. His dream loop when Michael had possessed him had been about owning a bar after all. Dating a bar owner would probably be a close second. Maybe, Cas thought, this was a door out of the life opening up for his friend.
Dean retreated back into his room, shutting the door. He set the new box of cereal on top his dresser and lay down on top of his unmade bed, not bothering to cover himself with the tangled blankets beneath him, not even bothering to face the TV that had been on for the past three days straight.
For his part, he planned to apologize for anything and everything Cas needed him to apologize for. But would Cas accept those apologies? Could he forgive Dean?
Which is how, during her time yelling at Dean, trying to get his attention, she’d seen exactly what he’d been doing cooped up in his room all those days. Or really, what he hadn’t been doing — which was anything. Sam hadn’t realized just how bad things had gotten. Yeah, he’d been dealing with his own stuff, but after Cas left he should have known that Dean would be totally wreaked.
Dean sighed. Now that Jack was gone, it was probably pointless to hope that Cas might actually come live with them for real. Dean’s presence in the Bunker had never been enough to draw Castiel for more than a temporary stay. Which, yeah, that stung. Actually, it made Dean’s chest downright ache when he thought about it for too long …
Occasionally in the past he’d allowed himself to imagine a moment like this — those fantasies in fact going further, physically, then he’d allowed things to go tonight. But he’d never imagined Dean saying those words. He’d never dared hope, even in his wildest dreams, that this precise moment was possible.
Because Sam was wrong. Dean wasn’t acting like this because he thought nothing mattered. The problem was that everything mattered too goddamned — or Chuck-damned, actually — much. Every
“That hunt … it was a bad one, Cas. It was this cult in Alabama, sort of a witchcraft thing without any real teeth to it. Except they were trying to change that. They …” he paused, rubbing his hand over his eyes, “They were sacrificing their own kids to this demon. How the fuck does somebody do that?”
This ending seems to easy, huh? I promise, it will make sense! Let me know what you think. Comments and feedback could help feed my muse and keep this thing going!
And so they laid down, each on their own side of the queen-sized bed, each carefully avoiding touching the other, and fell asleep.
As the bar slowly emptied, Dean made small talk with Sally and Lorna, and Cas observed Dean. It was peculiar, but as it got later, Dean seemed to seek out Cas with his eyes more often, as though checking if he were okay. Cas wasn’t sure what to make of it. Could Dean have picked up on Cas’ growing melancholy as he watched Lee’s subtle flirting? Cas hoped not … he hoped it was just Dean’s concern over Cas’ newly human state.
Dean seemed at a loss for words. And come to think of it … he hadn’t tried to kiss Cas in a while. Not once since Cas had woken up actually.
Dean looked over at Cas and smiled. A real smile, one that transformed his whole face and made his emerald eyes sparkle. Cas reached out and ran his fingers through the hair on the back of Dean’s head before he pulled him closer and brought their lips together again.
The truth of Cas’ words punched the fury right out of Dean like a blow to the stomach knocking the wind from his lungs. “Of course I forgave you Cas,” he said, his tone suddenly going quiet. “And I’m sorry I never said it before, okay? I’m sorry. And yeah, sure, I was angry. It was easier to be angry, to let you walk away, than it was to keep worrying about you every minute of every damn day. I couldn’t lose you Cas. Not you, not after everyone else.”
The last thing he had ever wanted was to feel like a burden to the human. Dean and Sam had enough to carry. The fate of the entire world had been placed on their backs, time and time again. He’d always hoped to be able to help shoulder a bit of the weight, never add to it.
He’d watched Cas follow Dean around for years, seen the angel’s mission transform from Heaven’s plan to Dean Winchester’s plans. And ever since Dean first broke Castiel’s heart, back when he’d tried to say yes to Michael the first time around, Sam had realized this went far, far deeper than mere friendship or camaraderie for the angel.
“Your turn,” Dean said, grinning broadly and smacking Cas playfully on the ass. Cas jumped a bit, despite it being at least the third time Dean had done the same thing this evening. The hunter chuckled, and it occurred to Cas that maybe his jumping was the reason Dean kept smacking him.
And no one at B’s had seen anything … though as it turned out Angela wasn’t the first person to leave town after last being seen there. It made sense. The bar was a bit outside of town, no other buildings around, no traffic cameras. It would be a good place to abduct someone without drawing attention.
Sam knew Dean had been struggling. Locking himself in his room, trying so friggin’ hard every time he came out to appear chipper … could Dean have been more obvious?
And that just made Dean even more of an asshole. Sam needed him. Not just on this errand to sift through Rowena’s possessions, the leftovers of the life that Sam had been forced to cut short. And not just to “save” Eileen, if that was even the right word. It wasn’t. There was no saving her now, just as there had been no saving her when that hellhound came for her. The best they could do was offer her a little island between the two hells she was facing. He wasn’t naïve enough to think that trapping her in a crystal would bring Eileen any peace. But he hoped it might give her oblivion, an escape from pain into nothingness.
Soon Dean was curled against his side, his head resting on Cas’ shoulder, his breathing growing slower and steadier by the minute. Several minutes passed, and Cas — who thought the other man was asleep — was surprised to hear the hunter mumble something incoherent.
Dean felt like his blood had suddenly frozen. He’d been thinking basically the same thing, but to hear it stated so firmly and quickly by Cas … it felt like he’d just been dumped by someone he’d never even been in a relationship with.
He approached the glowing spot slowly, and was unsurprised when his light illuminated an angel blade and a small glass vial among the pile of IV bags, syringes, and rope.
Cas’ brain spun, part screaming at him to run, part telling him to trust Dean, part just trying to figure out what the hell was going on.
“You don’t have to sleep on the floor Cas. I mean, not if you don’t mind just sharing the bed. I promise, I’m not going to try to seduce you or anything just because you know I’m bi now.”
killing you. And it’s only going to be easier for him now. There’s nothing he could throw at me and Sam at this point that could hurt us as much as losing you and …. Damn it Cas, I burned your body,” the fire was back in full force in Dean’s voice now.
Lee … now there was another puzzle. Seeing him had brought back a lot of memories, most all of them good. He made Dean nostalgic in a way he hadn’t been in a very, very long time. In other circumstances, Dean would have been all over Lee. But the truth was, as much attraction as there still was between the two of them, Lee wasn’t the one Dean wanted. Dean was exactly where he wanted to be right now, and if that made him a hopeless idiot destined for a future of lonely pining, so be it.
“Alright, we’ll take it,” said Dean, unable to keep the frustration out of his voice. Could anything about this hunt go
“Wait, wait, you just, drove all the way here to help me with a simple djinn hunt?” Cas was still feeling bewildered. Dean wasn’t telling him something. This was
He’d go after Dean in a minute, but first he had three bodies to take care of before some passing civilian noticed. Sam turned with a sigh, then froze.
He’d push the last few people he loved away. But to do that, he couldn’t think about Rowena or Eileen or any of the others they’d already lost. When he did, he remembered the pain … and it made it too hard to turn off his feelings and stop caring about all of them … his friends … his family … the world.
“Um, yes. I’m sorry Sheriff Roy. I’m not really up to visitors just now. I’m still not sure what happened. Last thing I knew I was talking to a mother about her missing child. Then I woke up here.”
“I know … believe me, after all these years I’ve figured that much out at least. But never getting to talk to him about it? And how everything went down in the end with him making the deal to save me … I guess I let his advice get in my head anyway. Lee was only the second guy I’d ever actually been with, and there haven’t been any since.”
Two chapters in one week to make up for the long break! Might even be able to give you a third this week. :) Oh, and I added new tags...
“There’s no dust or pollen on the driver’s side door frame, the steering wheel, or the gear stick. Almost like they were recently wiped clean.”
“Well come on over and join them! I’ll get you a beer,” said Lorna, grabbing Cas’s hand and pulling him over to the table where Dean was sitting — a bit closer than seemed normal — to Lee.
“What might be nothing,” all the cheer had suddenly left Sam’s tone, as though it had never been there. The question was serious, more a demand for information than a question, really.
When they at last broke from the tree cover into the parking lot, Eileen turned to Sam and said, matter-of-factly, “Give me the keys. I’ll drive your car, you drive Dean’s.”
“What?” asked Dean, caught off guard by the comment. They didn’t talk much about when Cas had been human before. The subject made Dean feel guilty as hell so he never brought it up. And Cas had never seemed very eager to talk about that period of his life either. “What do you mean you have ‘plenty of experience’ sleeping on floors?”
Case pinched the bridge of his nose. He tried to sort through his feelings as the car rumbled to life and backed out of the parking space. His emotions were all so … loud, now that he was human again. Which just made him more anxious about the drive — and the days — ahead.
“Yes, of course I’ll stay if that’s what you both want. Nothing would make me happier,” said Cas with a relieved smile.
Sam’s glaring at Dean now. He felt bad about the anger that entered his voice, but he couldn’t help it. Dean hurting the people he loved in an attempt to save them … it was an old freakin’ story and Sam was over it.
The anger was slowly but surely turning inward, as it always did. His thoughts distracted him enough that he was surprised when he stopped the car to realize he hadn’t driven to B’s after all. Instead, he was in the parking lot of Swayze’s.
“I’m afraid I don’t think there is a fix Dean, but … it’s okay, actually. I generally don’t mind being human. It has its advantages.”
They spread out and entered the tunnel, feet moving as quietly as possible. The first branch they encountered was a dead end, the next, was blocked from what looked like a long ago cave in. In the third branch they found what they were looking for.
, with a smirk. Four sets of eyes glared at him, and he quieted back down with a frown. Lee’s good mood seemed to have evaporated completely.
“Why are you Mr. Velcro all of a sudden, huh? You couldn’t get away from me fast enough after Harlan.”
Then a pair of strong arms encircled him, stopping his fall. Cas leaned heavily into Dean, into his warmth and the familiarity of his smell, so unlike the sterile hospital scents they had just left behind. He rested his head on a flannel clad shoulder as the world slowly stopped spinning.
“Dean,” said Cas, placing a hand on the hunter’s chest to stop his momentum as he leaned in for another kiss.
Cas stirred against his side, sighed contentedly, then abruptly froze. He’d evidently realized where he was and who he was currently plastered against.
Looking back towards the building Sam grinned as well and shook his head in amusement. Eileen was shockingly emotionally well-adjusted for someone who enjoyed the job as much as she did. He wondered, not for the first time, if that was a product of having wrapped up her personal revenge story neatly and cleanly. It wasn’t something he and Dean could relate to. Their “revenge” had merely opened the door to exponentially more grief. Some days it was hard to even remember where it all started. Things had been so simple when they thought their family story was just about the hunt for one demon.
between them again. But, despite his efforts to be respectful of what Dean called his “personal space,” Cas seemed to just be getting on the other man’s nerves.
Dean moved out of Cas’ line of sight and over to the door, where he leaned out and called down the hallway to the nurse’s station.
“Are you crazy? This is pure angel grace. Even just this tiny bit is like handling a nuclear weapon. We don’t even know how to put it back, or whether he needs to be conscious for it to work, or anything.”
“Let’s start with the scrapyard. It’ll be easier to check than the lake. If the car really is sunk in the lake we’d have a hell of a time finding it.”
“I’m Agent Plant, FBI,” said Dean, showing her his badge. Melly immediately relaxed letting the door open a bit wider.
Dean’s thoughts were cut off abruptly once again by a sudden drop in temperature in the bunker’s kitchen.
. Sam would obviously be there, probably engaged to Eileen. They’d all live in the bunker together, and they’d only hunt run-of-the-mill monsters, no angel-demon-apocalypse shit. Nothing to do with Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory. Their Charlie would be alive again, and their Bobby. So would Mom. Jack would be just a regular teenager, alive and doing regular, if awkward, teenage things. And Cas … well Cas would obviously be there, living with them in the bunker, maybe even in Dean’s room …
It seemed pretty clear to Dean, from the way that the angel had gotten all formal and quiet after realizing this was all really happening, that Cas was still pissed at him. Which Dean had to admit was fair. It stung like hell, but it was fair.
“Well thank you for checking in sheriff,” said Dean. “You’ll be the first on my list to call if Agent Worley remembers anything more. I’m afraid he’s been a bit confused. We haven’t gotten any useful leads at this point. Seems he was rather dehydrated. Might have had some blood loss even, though the doctors aren’t sure. It’s all a bit of a mystery currently.”
As soon as Dean’s flashlight illuminated Cas, hanging by his hands and looking deathly pale, the hunter was running for their friend, all attempts at silence forgotten.
Sally nodded and accepted the glass of water Lorna brought over to her. She gave one to Dean and one to Lee as well.
“That’s right. Well, if that’s all then?” said Roy, standing up and ushering Dean out of his office before he could ask any further questions.
A body drained of blood then hidden in the lake, submerged well enough that it took dredging to dislodge it. There was definitely a case here, one Cas had been working. And it wasn’t about the Green kid, it was about Shane Coogen. Something the sheriff had conveniently forgotten to mention.
And then there was Eileen. Sam had given Dean a quick call to let him know the spell he’d found at Rowena’s apartment had worked. Eileen was alive, flesh and blood alive, again. The sheer relief and joy in Sam’s voice had made Dean’s eyes prick with tears. It had been so long since they’d had something to be so happy about … since
Dean froze for a moment then looked at Cas with something in his eyes that Cas wasn’t sure how to read. “I’m so sorry Cas,” Dean said softly, the words gentle though his voice was rough with an emotion Cas couldn’t decipher. “I was angry, and I was pushing you away. But I never should have sent you there. Not with him.”
“I think it’s the only move I’ve got, Sam,” Dean said, his voice quiet and tired, his eyes wet again.
doubles available?” Texhoma was seriously middle of nowhere. What the fuck could have practically the
I will not abandon this fic! It will get finished! Thank you to everyone who is sticking with me and reading this one still. Life has been rough, depression has been kicking my butt a bit this fall. But things are getting a little better and I'm trying to get back in healthier routines and back to writing. I've gone back through the story and ANY TEXT DIRECTLY QUOTED FROM THE SHOW IS NOW UNDERLINED. Stylistically, it's a little distracting. But the ex-academic in me needed to credit the words that were not mine.
On the long car ride to Wyoming, after he had thoroughly lost the argument that Eileen should sit this hunt out, Sam had continued to fill her in on what had happened in the world during her time in Hell. And she had filled Sam in on some things he hadn’t fully noticed in the bunker. Some things about Dean, to be specific.
As soon as they were sure they were alone, Eileen took sentry position, insuring no one would enter the cavern without them knowing.
There were far more of the former than there should have been in a town this size, even a wilderness town popular with hikers. And the later were suspiciously similar in their shared vagueness — drownings, overdoses, even suicides were listed as causes of death, but very few seemed to have been confirmed with a formal autopsy.
Dean wanted to take some solace at least in the fact that Cas had dreamed of him. When Dean had been under a djinn’s spell, he had dreamt of his family mostly whole … his mother alive, Sam engaged to Jess and finished with law school, him with a girlfriend, and apartment, and a real job — one that didn’t involve scamming credit card companies and ganking monsters.
Cas took a deep breath, knowing before he said the words that he would probably end up regretting them …
“You think?” asked Dean. His tone considering but lacking the worry that Cas was beginning to feel. “So someone we’ve talked to since we’ve been in town, yeah? That’d be the sheriff, Angela’s sister, Sally, the staff at B’s, or maybe someone who overheard us at Swayze’s …”
“She, uh, got better. One-time thing. A spell Rowena was working on. Sam found it and finished it … anyway, that’s a story for another time. The djinn, do you know who it is? We’re thinking the sheriff, but we don’t know for sure.”
“Fanfiction research,” answered Sam. “We were trying to determine what plot lines were most popular in the
“Maybe,” replied Lorna. As she walked into the back of the bar, she called over her shoulder, “I’m not the type to go hiding cars anyway, so what do I know.”
“Hey Dean,” said Sam coming around the corner and giving Dean a quick clasp on the shoulder before moving past him to Cas, who Sam wrapped in one of his smothering sasquatch hugs.
Cas felt the corners of his mouth rise into a soft smile as a warm feeling spread through his chest.
“No worries there Dean. Your timing actually couldn’t be better. We’re closed Wednesday’s for inventory. You and me have the place to ourselves. How bout I pour you a beer and you take a load off, huh?”
“Fight? What fight? You said you needed some R&R to try to recharge your grace, but then I got that call from the sheriff with you playing FBI agent …”
And then there was the fact that, for the first time, Dean could just sit, inhale deeply, and enjoy this smell — without risking a confused angel or a bemused little brother asking him what exactly he was doing.
Dean turned, silently motioning that he’d take point. Sam and Eileen nodded, both already holding their blood streaked machetes. Whatever they might find in the mine, they were ready.
“Dean, think about it. He tried to discourage us from coming here to look for the car. He also claimed not to recognize Angela’s photo when she was one of his regulars …”
“No, not anywhere near here anyway. If I’m right that it’s the sheriff then we don’t want to make it that easy for him to track us.”
before. Even when he’d come closest to ending it, with the Ma’Lak box or after the last time Cas died when Dean had recklessly stopped his heart on a ghost hunt, he’d still been doing the job.
Cas smiled. This was more than he could have let himself hope for. Before he realized what he was doing he’d reached out and placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Almost as though the hunter had been waiting for a sign that it was okay, he leaned across the bench seat wrapped Cas in a hug with both arms. “I missed you Cas.”
“Okay, I think that’s all for now. Here’s my card. Please, call us if you remember anything … anything else at all, alright?” said Dean. “Even the smallest detail could help.”
But more immediately he felt himself relaxing into the feel of Lee’s lips on his, the slide of their tongues against each other’s, the way Lee’s hands were roaming over his body …
“Took you long enough,” Dean snapped at Sam, before turning to Eileen and immediately shifting to a smile and a gentler tone. “Hey Eileen good to see you all … alive again.”
Dean still looked concerned, and he was opening his mouth to say something more when a woman’s voice rang out from across the room.
“You alright Sally?” asked Lorna, and Cas’ attention snapped to the blonde woman the men had been harassing.
“Sam, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Cas quickly said. “I don’t think it would work out the way you want, if Dean and I tried to pretend … that.”
“Okay, well … Eileen and I are going to pick up some pizza and beer, celebrate you being back home,” Cas felt a wave of warmth at the word, “and then after dinner, we had some ideas about the Chuck situation that we wanted to run by you and Dean. You are staying, right? Because you know, it didn’t feel the same without you Cas. And Dean will probably never say it, but I know he feels the same. We want you here.”
And if Dean hadn’t been so hungover he probably would have noticed Cas in the passenger seat before he slid in the driver’s side door. As it was, Dean jumped so hard he hit his head on the roof and sloshed hot coffee over his hand.
“What’s the matter there Cas? I got something on my face?” said Dean. Cas blushed and looked away, though Dean’s voice sounded oddly pleased rather than irritated.
Cas’ stomach dropped. “Sure,” he replied, turning to go out the door. As it closed behind him he caught a glimpse of Lee leaning forward to kiss a startled Dean on the lips.
“Already?” asked Dean, worried that this was too soon. It had only been maybe 10 hours since he’d carried Cas’ unconscious body into the ER. What kind of cut-rate insurance had Sam faked for Cas that had him getting kicked out of the hospital already?
Cas understood, of course, that sexuality was spectrum. But he’d never seen Dean express interest like this in anyone who wasn’t in an overtly female appearing body. It was actually one of the things he’d been briefed on about Dean in the early days … the hunter’s very healthy, and very hetero, sexual appetite. In fact he’d been instructed to choose a male vessel so as to reduce the likelihood of his accidentally distracting the Michael sword.
Dean sat down in the chair across from Roy. “My partner was working a case here. Hadn’t shared much of the details with me yet. I’m just getting back from vacation, you see. We were supposed to rendezvous today so he could fill me in, but he never showed.”
“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” said Lee, grinning with a big, bright smile once again. “’Specially if it means I get to see a bit more of you while you’re here.” At this Lee’s eyes flicked up and down Dean’s body, so quickly as to almost make you question if it had happened. But Cas was pretty sure he did
“What is up with him?” asked Eileen, concern lacing her voice. Sam wondered just how long she’d been in the bunker, how much of their lives lately she’d observed while trying to get his attention.
Cas meanwhile was still staring at the space the hunter had just vacated, trying to figure out what was going on.
“Take it easy, man. They’re dead. All three of them. Danger’s over. It’s just us now. You got here in time.”
When Dean opened his eyes again, they were dry, glassy, and blank. He turned and shuffled slowly back to his room.
“It was a brief conversation really,” she replied. “We were both waiting for the sheriff at the station. When I heard he was an FBI agent, I asked him if he could help me find Caleb, because Sheriff Roy, he never takes anything I bring to his attention seriously.”
It was far from a perfect plant. But there was nothing left to try … and nothing left to lose that he wasn’t already going to lose anyway.
Cas looked at Dean’s profile for a moment, considering the sad set to his friend’s mouth, and the resignation in his eyes. He thought carefully before responding, “Thank you for trusting me with your story.”
He’d thought his leaving was for the best. Dean had been so stuck in his anger and guilt, and Cas had assumed his presence was nothing more than a reminder of those they’d lost.
Had Dean saved him? No, that didn’t make sense either. Dean hadn’t even known where he was. Neither had Sam. And there was no reason why Dean would have suddenly come looking for him. Unless maybe they needed his help with Chuck? Something had come up that they needed an angel, even one as weak as him, to accomplish? … Perhaps.
Cas stared at Dean as the other man drank his coffee. He knew he shouldn’t, but the years old habit was hard to break and the disorientation Cas felt after waking in his friend’s arms was enough to bring it back full force.
At this dream-Dean barked out a laugh, “Okaaaayyy Cas. How many liquor stores did you drink this time.”
Grand Tetons … that fit. It’s beautiful country. The kind of place he’d imagine Cas choosing to go. Much better than flat Rexburg, Idaho, the sad Gas N’ Sip town Cas ended up in the last time he’d gone off on his own with no plan and no mission.
“You call the sheriff, let him know we found the car. I’ll go to B’s, see if anyone there’s acting shifty today.”
Sam jogged to catch up with him. “Hey, Dean, are you sure you’re okay? Cause last night you seemed sort of, um, upset? After Cas shot down that idea Eileen and I had?”
, Sam realized with bewilderment as he pushed himself to his feet and walked slowly towards his brother, the way a person might approach a wounded animal.
He’d always admired humans’ ability to feel so deeply, to love so completely. It’s one of the reasons he’d told himself that this world was worth falling for. How ironic then that this very capacity for love would be the thing he’d hate most about his slow decent towards mortality.
Style note: UNDERLINED TEXT IS QUOTED DIRECTLY FROM THE SHOW SUPERNATURAL. I've found that I like writing within cannon, as in actually IN it, either weaving through it to flesh it out and answer unanswered questions, as I did in my first fic "Hunger is Not a Crime," or to do a combination of that plus a fix-it, as I'm doing here. But the remnants of the academic and comp. teacher in me make me feel twitchy taking parts of the show's script without crediting them. Because I use italics for emphasis within my own writing, I've chosen to use underlining to indicate when the words are taken from the show rather than from my imagination. I know it is likely a bit distracting, but I needed to go back and make this adjustment for my own peace of mind, so I hope y'all can forgive me and that it does not prove too annoying! On the plus side, between needing to cite my sources and having taken an unconscionably long break in writing this one, I'm going back and BETAing my own work one more time with the advantage of several months of distance. Yay for less typos!
Cas looked more baffled than ever, his head cocked to the side. “What? … Dean, you do realize that makes absolutely no sense.”
Dean, slightly calmer now, checked Cas’ vitals then turned to meet Sam’s questioning gaze. “I think he’s going to be okay for now, but we should get him out of here, fast.”
And if Castiel had been a full-power angel, then Sherriff Roy likely never would have gotten the jump on him …
After the two friends settled into a booth, Cas filled Dean in with more detail on his conversation with Angela’s sister and with the staff at B’s. The food arrived and the talk shifted to how the fishing had been Idaho.
Dean swallowed, nodded one small, tight nod, and shoved the vial back into his pocket. His tone was flat as he replied, “Good thing Sam wouldn’t let me put it back in you then.”
How low were Cas’ batteries that a freakin’ djinn had gotten the jump on him? And Dean had sent Cas into literal hell just weeks ago.
“Yeah, we found it in the djinn’s cave. Sam’s theory is that the djinn needed you to be human for your blood to be useful so he siphoned off the last of your grace.”
He sighed in relief, letting go of a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, to find Dean sitting on the hood of the Impala, waiting for him.
God was going to take away each and every person they cared about, in the most painful ways possible, and there was nothing Sam or Dean could do about it.
But as Dean’s soft lips continued to press against his, more gently now, Cas decided he didn’t care. He started to kiss back, reaching into his mind for memories of what he’d learned about this from that kiss with Meg, from his time with the reaper, April, and from his strange psuedo-marriage during his time with amnesia.
Dean had gotten on a long explanation of the differences between classic and modern cars, and as he and Cas strolled through the scrapyard, Cas could almost pretend they were just out for a walk together. Dean was in his element here, pointing out different cars and explaining the intricacies of automotive mechanics. It was maybe even better than if they had been strolling through a park.
Dean’s heart sank a little. “Let me guess, there’s been a lot of missing people around here recently?”
Things seemed okay between him and Dean now. Or at least they were headed in that direction, he hoped. He’d stay and do whatever he could, whatever was in his limited humanly power, to ensure Dean didn’t despair again.
“Yeah, just, it makes sense, trust me. So I’m thinking I’ll check out some bait shops. And then the sheriff told me Cas was interested in this missing kid, Caleb Green, only he wasn’t really missing. The mom was just freaking out cause the kid was running late getting back from a camp out, but that’s all it was. He turned up that afternoon. Doesn’t really sound like our kind of thing, but if Cas talked to the mom, Melly, then I should check them out. Could you track down their address for me?”
“Is that seriously what this has been about? You’re trying to protect him? You’ve got to be fucking kidding me, man. He’s as much a part of this as we are. He’d want to be here.”
“He’s losing power Sam. I know you’ve noticed it too. And he’s the best chip Chuck has to play against me, against us.”
As Sam pulled into the parking lot, the moon was just rising over the tree line. Night had already fallen, but at least with a nearly full moon it wouldn’t be
“We’d just lost Rowena,” countered Dean, his voice rising in volume again. “She was the most powerful witch maybe ever, and she was at the top of her game. If there was anyone, anyone in the whole universe, that wrote her own rules it was Rowena. And she
Now that he’d finally accepted it, all of it, he had to also accept that Cas simply did not feel the same way. He’d made that very clear once again last night.
The kiss deepened, becoming rougher once again as a decade of pent up passion poured between Castiel and his human.
It was different than anything Dean had experienced before. Cas’ muscles felt firm beneath Dean’s hand. The stubble on his chin was scratchy against Dean’s chest. The leg slung over his own was oddly heavy. It had been so long since Dean had held another man in any way that approached this sort of intimacy. And even then … a boy in one high school … Lee … he’d never fallen asleep with either of them, never woken up in their arms.
As soon as Sam fished the keys out of Dean’s pocket, Dean somehow had the Impala’s rear door open and was sliding both himself and Cas onto the leather bench seat.
“I’ll mention it next time I see him,” said Dean, and it was all he could get in before Caleb was once again talking over him.
He was sure he was imagining things. But as the song ended and the singer stepped down from the stage, Dean was more and more sure.
He wasn’t sure. To have his real life blend so seamlessly with his dream world … the djinn must be a very old one, very skilled in the tools of its kind.
camping. And we were being safe. No one drove. The fire wasn’t even that big. No one else’s parents freaked out and went to the police when they weren’t home at the crack of dawn. You always jump to the worst conclusion. I’m surprised you didn’t have them dredging the lake or searching the mine, even though you know I wouldn’t camp in that part of the woods.”
He’d regretfully broken away from the kiss at last, his eyes meeting the hunter’s. And oh, what he saw there! The relief and fondness for him, Castiel, former warrior of heaven and, as Dean had made clear the last time they talked face to face, chronic-fuck-up.
“Well, uh, um, okay then?” said Dean, blushing a little harder. The jealousy Cas had been feeling earlier came roaring back at full force as he watched Dean fidget and scuff his boot on the floor like a teenager.
Dean turned and walked to his room, not trusting himself to remain composed in front of the warm reunion. Much to his chagrin, his eyes were starting to feel a bit damp.
God had rigged the game — rigged his and Sam’s life. There was no way Dean could beat the house this time.
mused Dean. He followed Roy back out front, trying to decide whether the sheriff’s behavior bordered more on suspicious or just plain asshole.
was the solitude of his room, the numbing familiarity of cartoon reruns, and another box of junk cereal that was going to do nothing at all to fill the empty chasm that had opened up inside him swallowing his ability to feel, to desire, to strive … but it would give his hands something to do. Give his body something to focus on while his mind slid over the sounds and color coming from the television.
“Of course, agent,” said Roy. “I don’t mean to disturb you while you’re recuperating. I was just so relieved to hear over the scanner that you’d been found. We were all worried, down at the station, after your partner came in looking for you.”
No, the look of horror (now firmly in place) was for himself. Sam had come so close to dying … again. And it was Dean’s fault. He’d let Sam come here without backup, to the apartment of possibly the strongest living (until recently) witch anywhere in the world.
The closest Cas’d ever come was when Jack was with them. Though Dean knew that was really about Jack. The bunker was Jack’s home, so it became, for a time, Castiel’s home too … or at least his home base. Somehow the angel had never really settled in.
“Of course,” said Roy, “I’ll leave you to rest then Agent Worley. I hope you feel better soon. Do let me know if you start to remember anything more.”
She slapped each of them on the back in turn and took off across the parking lot, calling over her shoulder, “Come on, night’s not getting any younger.”
Cas’ condition and the guilt for it were Dean’s to carry, both literally and figuratively, Dean felt. He assumed Sam had guessed as much when his brother eventually stopped offering, despite Dean’s gradually slowing pace and increasing number of stumbles as they neared the trailhead.
“What was that?” he asked, his mouth quirked into an affectionate grin. It had been so easy, so natural, to fall into this physical intimacy with his friend.
Dean hung up abruptly, snapping the old flip phone shut before he could completely lose control of the situation.
By the time Roy finally walked in nearly an hour later, Dean was openly fidgeting in his seat. He sprang up at the sight of the sheriff.
“Brothers … yes,” said Cas. Dean wondered if he imagined the faint tone of — was it resignation? — in Cas’ voice.
As soon as they were through the sliding doors, Cas grabbed the chair’s wheels, skidding it to a halt. “I can walk by myself.”
The hunter closed his eyes, his knuckles white as his hand tightened around the small crystal bottle.
“It’s okay to relax Dean,” said Lee, leaning against the bar next to him. “It’d be okay for you to relax a lot more than this. If you wanted to stay … take a break from the life. See how it suits you.”
“Lee and I were just holding each other and kissing a little and then my dad stumbled in,” continued Dean, “and he started yelling at Lee to ‘get your fucking hands off my fucking son.’ I was 26, so it’s not like I was a kid or anything. But Lee did have close to ten years on me. You wouldn’t know it looking at him now though — the man’s aged better than I have. But anyway, I’m sure the age difference maybe made things even worse for my dad.
The SUV had left at some point while Dean was in the station. In the large SUV’s place was Honda Civic, and clearly visible behind the smaller car was a gold Continental.
And it turned out what they really needed protecting from was him. But if he didn’t care, then Chuck wouldn’t have any reason to hurt people in order to hurt Dean.
“Well, open it up. Put it back in him,” came Dean’s urgent voice from darkness. Sam swung his light up to illuminate his brother’s face, causing Dean to squint and look away. “Watch where you’re shining that thing, wouldya?”
“You are not coming with me Cas. You’re barely out of the hospital, you don’t have your grace, so no, you’re staying here and resting.”
“Cas, for the fifth time, this is Dean. Listen, please, I know you’re mad at me. You have every right to be mad at me, I get it. I do. Just … if you can do this one last thing for me and then … well, then if you never want to talk to me again that’s fine, I’ll understand. But please, just call back just this one time Cas. … I need … just … please. Call me. Alright, bye.”
“Earth to Cas. You in there buddy?” Dean asked, giving Cas a worried look from the other side of the table. “You were totally zoned out there for a minute. I had to try, like, three times to get your attention.”
I apologize it’s taken me this long to update after chapter 1. I jumped the gun in starting to post this one. I know where I want the story to go, but it’s proving surprisingly difficult to get it there. There’s so much cannon baggage to work through.
“Sam, I’m good, really I am. I know I’ve been off my game majorly lately. That’s why I just need to get out of the bunker, on my own. Clear my head a bit.”
Dean and Lee looked at each other. Dean arched an eyebrow and Lee smiled and nodded. The two men stood up in unison and waded through the crowd to the source of the disturbance. They found two men, rough looking guys in biker leather, hassling a younger and very intoxicated blonde woman. She was saying “no” loud and clear and the men were not taking it for an answer.
Whatever his reasons for coming here might be, Dean felt drawn inside. He found himself opening the Impala’s door and, once again with having consciously decided to, he was moving towards Swayze’s. Towards Lee.
had been so happy. Dean didn’t want to bring him down from that just yet. And after all, Eileen surely was still resting. Sam needed to be there to care for her as she adjusted to not being a ghost anymore.
But even when things were at their worst, whether it was Leviathan or the Mark of Cain or the year after their dad died, Dean had kept putting one foot in front of the other. He’d always managed to get the job done.
Sam sat next to Dean, knowing the best move here was to wait for his brother to start talking on his own.
“If you continue to insist I get out of the car I am not above calling Sam to tell him what you’re really doing Dean.”
“I know Sammy, I know, but what am I supposed to do?” Dean’s voice broke completely, tears flowing freely once more.
And Dean was still flying high enough on his own feelings of irritation to turn and walk away. He stomped back to the Impala, slamming the door and turning the key in the ignition with more force than was necessary, unable to even bring himself to think something consoling towards his Baby for the rough treatment.
“You know,” said Sam, his voice growing thoughtful, “that’s a thought. If we could play it right. But what ending would be satisfying enough to change Chuck’s mind?”
Roy came out the back entrance and moved swiftly towards his car. Conveniently, he had parked in a dark corner of the lot, far from security cameras or any other cars. Sam supposed that was the result of being a monster living among men. The urge to hide never quite went away. And right now, it worked very nicely in the hunters’ favor.
No … even if it hurt Sam, hurt their relationship more even than Dean sending Cas away had, Dean couldn’t help Sam with this. Not with Eileen. Not with the “milk run” to Rowena’s place. He just couldn’t.
Fortunately, however, Cas’ plan seemed to have worked … perhaps a little too well. He’d had to half carry dream-Dean from the car into the building. Still, Dean’s ardent fumbling had failed to progress any further, so Cas supposed this was a win.
But the cabin had been bad, even by Dean’s road tripping standards. The roof looked like it had a leak. The whole place had a dingy feel about it, despite the recently used cleaning supplies he’d found in Cas’ kitchen. There wasn’t even a TV. And there were almost no possessions to show that Cas had been staying there. All Dean had found was a tackle box with a few lures and hooks in it, an old fishing pole, and few books that had seen much better days.
The three hunters moved carefully down the trail, flashlights aimed low to ground. When they found the mine 40 minutes later, Sam heard Dean breathe an audible sigh of relief. He couldn’t help but agree. None of them were exactly seasoned hikers, and they were totally unfamiliar with this terrain. It felt like a miracle that they’d been able to navigate the trails in the dark.
And he couldn’t quite quell the feeling of hurt that Dean had hidden this aspect of himself so thoroughly from him. Sexual preferences simply didn’t bear any moral significance to Cas — or to anyone in heaven. He had no reason to fear judgement from an angel. Did Dean really think Cas, whom he called his “best friend,” would judge him?
Dean watched the reunion, schooling his face into as close to a neutral expression as he could manage when his heart felt like someone was squeezing it in their fist.
“Yeah, I’ve got a location on where he was staying. I’m heading over there now. Then I’ll swing by the Green’s. The bait shop guy knew Cas, called him Clarence. And get this. The last day anyone saw Cas? A body was found in the lake. Drained of blood.”
“How ya’ doin’ Cas?” drawled Lee, reaching out to shake Cas’ hand, “Any friend of Dean’s is a friend of mine.”
And Cas had the ridiculous thought — absurd really, because it would never happen — but he couldn’t help thinking that he didn’t want their first time to be less than real.
cute. It made sense that the angel would go as budget as possible on accommodations. He didn’t have many assets as far as Dean knew, and he hadn’t been using the credit card Dean had given him after the last time Cas had been human.
“So he was here fishing?” Dean asked … it was a lame question he knew. Of course Cas was here fishing. This was a bait shop after all. Dean had already guessed that anyway. But still, it was a hard thing to picture. Castiel, warrior of heaven, sitting quietly by a lake waiting for the fish to bite. He sort of liked the image though. Cas doing something so human, so peaceful. Something just for fun.
The mood was quickly shattered when they finally stumbled upon the beige Impala. The doors and tires had been removed from the vehicle. Someone had gone through some effort to make the car look like just another junker.
Ninety minutes later and Dean had checked every motel in town. At each reception desk Dean flashed his FBI badge and a photo of Cas, but no one remembered seeing him.
He wasn’t even mad at Cas really so much as he was angry at himself. Cas was here. He was sticking around, and that should be enough. It was Dean who was messing things up, yet again.
“I know you saved me, Dean. I know because that’s what I would have wanted to have happen. It’s okay. Really.”
This drive felt exactly like what Dean imagined sitting next to an ex after a very recent and very bad breakup would be like.
“I didn’t realize, not that it matters at all, but I just always assumed you were heterosexual. You’re very … enthusiastic, in your pursuit of women that is. I’d never seen you pursue a man or reciprocate one’s advances … that’s all.”
“Do you remember anything else from that night?” asked Dean. “Any people who were watching you and Angela a bit too much? Or any strange sounds or smells, like rotting egg maybe?”
But there was more to it than that. He’d never woken up with someone he cared about as deeply as he did Cas. He’d loved Cassy, sure. And Lisa too. But he hadn’t known them the way he knew Cas. And they hadn’t known him the way Cas knew him. The only person he’d ever loved as intensely as he loved Cas was Sam, but that was completely different. As many times as he’d told Cas he was like a brother to him, Dean knew it wasn’t true. It had never been true. He’d been falling for this mysterious, powerful, compassionate being, slowly but surely, ever since that day Cas sat beside him on a bench and confessed that he had doubts. Dean had realized then that Cas wasn’t so different from himself after all, and the vague attraction he’d felt since that staggering moment when Cas first revealed himself in the barn had begun to crystalize into something more.
It was becoming harder and harder to form any coherent thought at all. When the sound of the office phone ringing cut through the fog, Dean was surprised to find Lee’s hands deftly unbuckling Dean’s belt and reaching for the button on his jeans.
Though perhaps … did Dean prefer for Cas to think he was heterosexual so that there could be no confusion on Castiel’s part as to what their relationship was — and, by extension, what it would never be?
Covering ground they’d already walked, and being less cautious with their lights, they made better time. They were back at the Impala in 25 minutes, even with Dean shifting Cas from his arms to his shoulders then back every few minutes. Sam had offered to carry Cas more than once, but each time Dean had just shoved past him with a grunted, “I’m fine.”
, thought Dean. Cas might be pretty new to being a human but he wasn’t born yesterday. The former angel surely knew that two platonic friends did not usually wake up embraced in one another’s arms.
“You must be Eileen. I was happy to hear of your resurrection,” said Cas, extending a hand. Eileen shook it with a smile.
Dean should feel more relaxed by now. Except for the whole a-djinn-might-bust-in-any-time-now factor. And also the fact that, when Cas did wake up, Dean was not at all sure how the conversation was going to go.
“No, that’s … that’s alright. Sheriff Roy already updated me on Caleb’s situation,” said Dean as Caleb Green himself finally made his appearance, loping down the stairs. Dean gave him a small wave and an apologetic nod. “I actually wanted to talk to you about my partner, Agent Worley.”
Which, when your best friend just almost died and you’re expecting their would-be-murderer to come walking through the door at any moment? Yeah, easier said than done.
“Yeah, but he wasn’t having much luck with it. Kept at it though. Said a friend of his had recommended it, told him it was ‘meditative.’”
Too soon the Impala was pulling into the scrapyard. Cas and Dean dispensed with the FBI schtick for the time being, posing as two ordinary friends looking for a part for one of their cars. They ambled through the aisles, checking for Angela’s car which ,Cas had been amused to learn, was an early 2000s Chevy Impala (“It’s
“Sam?” Dean called out as he walked into the bunker, rolling out neck and shoulders stiff from the long drive.
, Dean thought to himself, giving in to the dark mood that was beginning to once more eclipse this golden moment.
“Hey Cas!” said Dean, smiling up at him, clearly a bit intoxicated. Which, given Dean’s drinking abilities, meant he’d overindulged quite a bit more than he usually would during an active hunt.
, he thought. His internal monologue wasn’t even bitter. It was just stating a fact he already knew. Dean, fucking up again. Story his life.
Dean turned to Sam and said, real respect in his voice, “Sam, I know I’ve said it before about other chicks, but this time I mean it, marry that woman.”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you! The nurses told me your stats were looking really good, so I’m here to start the discharge process.”
Dean could feel his hands clenching into fists. He wasn’t sure if Cas’ comment was a dig at him or at Sam, but layered on top of Cas’ repeated accusations against Lee, despite Dean vouching for the bar owner, it was too much. Dean needed to put some distance between them before he blew up completely.
The intimacy of the moment, despite the crowd around the two men, made Cas feel like an intruder. He shrank backwards to give them more space.
“Yeah, the trunk smells like bleach. Like someone was trying to make sure no evidence would be here for the police to find. Seems like more effort than the typical monsters Sam and I hunt.”
“I’m not going to do anything stupid Sam. But I’m not waiting for you either.” An image of Charlie, her bloody form crumpled in a bath tub, flashed through Dean’s mind. He shuddered.
“Um … sure, of course,” came Cas’ befuddled reply from the other room as Dean shut the bathroom door.
He’d seen Dean depressed. Hell, he’d seen him suicidal, and more than once. There’d been the time he decided to say yes to Michael, back during the OG Apocalypse. And there’d been the more recent time after Dean finally had said yes to Michael — the whole plan to seal himself in a magical box and get dropped into the ocean in order to keep Michael from escaping his head. There’d been the crossroads deal too, the death wish that started it all …
Despite his worry that Dean might read his emotions accurately, Cas found himself feeling a bit better as, minute by minute, Dean’s attention shifted more towards him and away from Lee.
“Wait … no way Sammy. We are not pretending to be an item,” sputtered a panicking Dean, remembering their previous — and quite unsettling — findings when exploring the
In the meantime, he liked wearing Dean’s clothes. They were a little big on him, but they carried Dean’s familiar scent. When he ran his fingers over the old, worn flannel, Cas could almost imagine it was Dean he was touching. All in all, wearing the other man’s clothing was, in fact, rather thrilling…
“Yeah, you can definitely walk by yourself,” said Dean, his chuckle vibrating through his chest to Cas’ cheek, which was pressed firmly against the hunter.
If Dean couldn’t protect the people he cared about, then the only thing left to do was to try to care less. In fact, he could try to stop caring at all.
“Happy to be of service,” said Dean with an easy smile. “Actually, I think my friend Cas here and I were looking for you. Are you Angela Sullivan’s friend?”
Dean thought, conveniently forgetting for a moment that his badge was counterfeit and he, in fact, showed no respect for the feds either.
Dean stared at him, trying to process this information. Of course he’d known that Cas must have been homeless for a little while. But Cas was, well, Cas. He’s smart and resourceful and tough as hell, er, heaven. Dean had just believed he’d find a way to get by. He’d had to believe that, when the alternative was helping Cas and alienating the angel who was keeping Sam alive.
He’d wanted — above all else this last, long decade — to see Dean happy and safe. Nothing had changed that mission. Nothing ever would.
His friend’s breathing was steady and deep. He was still asleep. Dean lay completely still, worrying over how he should play this when Cas woke up. After last night’s conversation he felt more nervous than ever about accidentally giving away how he felt somehow.
“We need to get Cas somewhere safe where we can monitor him first, make sure he’s definitely going to be okay.”
Cas slowly became aware of bright lights around him. Then a beeping sound entered his consciousness. But even after his eyes flickered open, it took him a solid minute to put two and two together and realize he was lying in a hospital bed.
Sam had been on the other side of the room, having a somewhat frantic conversation with Eileen, half sign language half spoken words.
“You mean Lee? Or his friend? Lee is the owner is this bar, and does a fair amount of the singing in it when he gets a mind to. And the other fellow I guess is an old buddy of his.”
Cas wondered, before saying, “To be honest, after you sent me into hell with Belphegor, I wasn’t sure.”
Turning to Sam, the smile left her face. “Is Dean okay? I just saw him in the hallway. He looked upset.”
,” Dean said, raising his eyebrows and giving Sam a face that he knew, even in the middle of the expression, made him look like a total asshole.
He sat in one of the vinyl chairs Charlene had gestured at, noting that not a few of them were occupied. In Dean’s experience, small town sheriffs went one of two ways. You had ones like Jody, who took their duty to protect and serve extremely seriously, and then you had those who were in it for the authority, who tended to think they were above the job and the people they were meant to help. It was starting to look like Roy was the later.
A warm pressure was on his chest, his hand resting on firm shoulder that rose and fell with gentle breaths. Dean found himself disoriented for a moment …
“And you … look I knew your power was fading. I’m not blind. I’d seen it for a while. And I’m sorry I couldn’t talk to you about it. But Cas … how many times have you died for Sam and me? Huh? How many of those times were you a fully charged angel? Chuck
“What?” Cas was absolutely still, frozen by Dean’s words. Dean couldn’t tell what the emotion was behind Cas’ question … Confusion? Disbelief? Anger?
But the other discomfort — the heightened emotion and the way he felt loss, loneliness, anger, and sorrow not only in his mind but physically —
The burning body, which should have been a stinking mass of charred flesh and bones (burning fresh corpses was
He wasn’t sure if he could have done anything much to help, but he was kicking himself for not having tried. The last time Dean had lost Cas he’d killed himself after all — temporarily, to be fair, but it was still reckless. Sam couldn’t help but feel like he should have been watching his brother more closely, no matter that Sam was also dealing with losing his mom, Jack, Rowena, and then basically Cas, same as Dean had been.
Cas’ gold Continental to be exact. Parked beneath a large pine tree, the car was covered in a layer of yellow pollen, suggesting it had been there for a day at the very least.
“Listen, you know he didn’t want to be found, wasn’t answering your calls. It might just be that. But he’s not staying at any of the local motels. And I found his car, parked by the sheriff’s station. Only the sheriff said Cas had come and gone. I don’t know Sammy, something here just … I don’t know. Anyway, I’ve got a couple leads. I’m thinking maybe Cas might have been doing some fishing—”
Dean checked Cas’ pulse and breathing again, then found himself sitting with the angel’s cheek once more cupped in his hand, staring at his friend’s sleeping face.
But Cas knew that this time, finally, things were too broken to ever be fully put back together with Dean. He wanted to be angry at Dean … the real Dean, not the dream Dean who was doing some very talented things with his tongue currently. Cas could not be further from angry with dream-Dean.
Sam turned back to Dean who had cut Cas down and was cradling the angel in his arms. “Come on Cas, wake up. I need you to wake up,” the blond man muttered. Sam stood still, struck by the tenderness of the moment, the gentleness with which his brother held their friend despite the desperation that was clear in his tone.
Yet for all the hurt he felt at the hunter’s expense, when Cas thought of Dean what he remembered most clearly was the man’s pain. Dean, Cas knew, had a tendency to react like a wounded animal, lashing out at those closest to him when the weight of it all became too much to bear. It certainly wasn’t the first time Cas had been on the receiving end. It was the first time, however, that Cas had felt no hope for things improving.
“I’m, um, sorry … about drinking this much on the job. I’m not sure what came over me. Just not thinking clearly, I guess,” mumbled Dean.
Dean had only a second to register the “F.B.I.” scrawled on the tape on the back of the phone before he pulled himself into character.
Dean walked over, Cas still cradled in his arms — a position Sam knew not even a strong man like his brother could sustain for very long.
“Lee and I used to work the occasional job together, back when Sammy was in college and I was working with my dad,” said Dean by way of explanation.
, thought Dean, remembering Cas’ behavior in purgatory. And it’s not like Dean needed anyone to tell him risking his life had been a dick move towards Sam. He was well aware of it. Just another of the ways he’d fucked up in his job as Sam’s protector.
And then Dean was kissing Lee, or Lee was kissing him. Dean didn’t know which it was nor did he know how he kept getting from point A to point B. He felt drunk even though he hadn’t taken a single sip of the beer Lee had pressed on him.
witches, these three no less than 95% of the rest of those he’d met, even if they hadn’t been spewing any bodily fluids around when he arrived on the scene. Well, other than what Dean’s witch-killing bullet was responsible for splattering on the wallpaper in the hall.
Cas stiffened, seeming to realize he’d let more slip in his remark than he’d intended to. “I was human and on my own for the first time ever. I took me quite a while to find a way to access money, and even then, lodging is expensive. It was more economical to sleep on the floor in the Gas N’ Sip store room.”
“That must have been difficult, all these years never being able to share a part of who you are with those closest to you.”
Dean was the bravest human Cas’d ever known in all of his long life. The hunter’s strength of will had bested both heaven and hell. To imagine him so utterly defeated shook Cas to the core.
Sam turned to Dean, who was awkwardly trying to work the Impala keys out of his pocket without setting Cas down. “Little help here?”
, Dean realized. He’d never told Cas all the things he’d meant to say after Sam kicked Gadreel out. Yeah, there’d been the whole painful blow up with Sam, then Dean going off with Crowley to get the Mark of Cain, and all the shit that came afterward. He’d been a little … distracted. But still ...
Dean stopped, holding the chair steady as Cas got to his feet and quickly realized he may have spoken too soon. The edges of his vision darkened and his head spun. The floor was getting closer at an alarming rate.
“If this conversation is making you uncomfortable, Dean, we don’t have to talk about this aspect of your life.”
“Okay,” said Sally, wiping her nose on her sleeve. She followed Lorna to the front of the bar as the other woman helped her call an Uber.
And to think, his beer muddled brain — and how much beer did Lee give him to get him that drunk anyway? — had worried about somehow betraying Cas by flirting with Lee.
At the end of the day, maybe it was just too easy to slide back into the lifelong mindset of Dean being the strong older brother, the rock that kept the Winchesters going.
“It’s uh, you know, a little early for a drink. Even for me, heh,” Dean replied, laughing nervously.
Love changed you. It made you vulnerable to changeable people. It could make you hurt in ways you didn’t know were possible.
“We’re not sure what it means. I hung up immediately. Fortunately I was using a new burner — I didn’t want Becky to have one of my primary numbers, for obvious reasons — and I smashed it right away. But anyway, Chuck went to a fanfiction writer and expert for some reason. So I think it might actually lend credence to the theory Eileen and I have been working on. You see, when we couldn’t reach Becky, we started doing some research.”
Dean’s instincts, honed over decades of hunting, were screaming at him that something wasn’t right. But his mind and body were both fighting him. He felt like he was going to be sick, and he stumbled to his feet in search of the bathroom. Only when he got to the dark hallway on the far side of the bar, his eyes caught on a padlock on a supply closet. Why hadn’t he noticed that last night?
Dean groaned. The sound of a cell phone cut through the mental fog he’d been numbly floating in for the last few hours.
“Alright Sherriff Alden Roy, where are you …” Dean muttered as he typed the name into Google. “Gotcha!” He pulled up a local news story from a small town in western Wyoming.
“Whoa, cowboy,” said Lee, with a chuckle, as he beat Cas to grabbing Dean’s arm and helping him regain his balance. “Maybe hold off ‘til mornin’ at least?”
Cas had fallen back asleep shortly after Roy left the hospital, the run in with his would-be killer having exhausted what little energy he’d regained.
“Listen, how about you go talk to Angela’s family. Hear from them whether or not they think the Sheriff is right, that Angela might have just run off in search of brighter lights and bigger things. I’ll go check out this bar, Swayze’s, and see if Angela’s friend Sally shows up.”
Cas smiled a bit at that. He hadn’t thought anyone would even notice when he’d disappeared into the djinn’s lair.
Dean’s voice broke Cas out of his moment of reverie. He pulled sharply away and nearly fell all over again. “Hey, sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it,” said Dean, looking hurt as he caught Cas by the elbow to stabilize his friend.
Getting my momentum back on this one! The "Golden Time" events aren't quite wrapped up with Sheriff Roy still on the loose. Lots still to be said between Dean and Cas, and I plan to take this fic through at least the next episode, "Last Call." Thanks for sticking with me! Let me know what you think in the comments.
“I’ll be fine, Dean. I am not a child who you can tell to stay behind. I am a millennia old being who can and will make my own choices.” With that, Cas broke his stare. “Now, where are we going.”
Dean pulled out a newspaper clipping with Angela’s picture on it, and slid it over the table to Lee, their fingers brushing for just the briefest moment … but not brief enough to escape Cas’ notice.
“I appreciate that, Dean,” said Lee, his eyes going soft as he added, “I’d say the same about you, you know?”
“We should go fishing together sometime,” said Dean, his mouth still full of bacon and eggs, “I could give you some pointers.”
He and Cas carried their bags into the room and looked at the single bed. “I’ll sleep on the floor,” offered Dean, “You’re still recuperating.”
He hadn’t been willing to call it love until Purgatory. Searching for Cas in that literally god-forsaken place, he’d known his desperation went far beyond camaraderie or friendship. But Cas was too important to lump his feelings in with the countless one-night-stands, the basis of his previous understanding of intimacy. So he’d continued to bury the truth, hiding it even from himself.
“Alright then,” Dean continued, crumpling up his napkin and tossing some bills on the table, “back to work.”
He still hoped they could have a life after their long saga ended though, if it ever ended. Maybe a life with Eileen in it …
“So Lee,” Dean went on, “last thing I want to do here is drag you back into the life, like, at all. You got out and that’s amazing. Most people I’ve known …” Dean paused, wrestling with some emotion, one Cas was pretty sure he could guess, “… not many hunters get that. And just … I’m so happy for you man, really. This is amazing and you deserve it, you really do.”
He wasn’t sure Dean realized how deep it was for Cas, but given the fact that all those long soulful stares went two ways … well, Sam had his suspicions Dean didn’t realize how deep it went for Dean either.
Dean grabbed his coat and headed out the door as well. Fifteen minutes later he was walking into Swayze’s, where an attractive brunette collected his cell phone, explaining it was the roadhouse policy.
But it had seemed a small price to pay for the intensity of the emotion, for the purity of it. The way he cared for Dean in particular was like nothing he had ever experienced in his very, very long life. Not his love for his siblings, not even his love for his Father compared to it. Castiel knew that was the most dangerous aspect of this love, but he had simply never cared before.
. “Angela wouldn’t of left me there like that. She was a good friend, the best friend anybody could ask for. And what they’re saying about her, that she skipped town without telling anyone, she never woulda done that. She loved me and her sister and her other friends; she wouldn’ta made us worry like that!”
“And, uh, there’s another thing. Something you should know,” Dean was almost stammering now as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a faintly shining vial.
choose to stay, Dean had never lost hope that Cas might one day decide to really settle down in the bunker.
“Shit, that’ll be my whisky distributor,” growled Lee, brows knit in irritation. “To be continued,” he said, smiling at Dean in a way that looked damn near predatory. Dean felt a shiver run down his spine, and not in a pleasant way. “Give me 15 minutes.” And with that, Lee disappeared back through the swinging doors leaving Dean pressed against the bar with his heart racing and his head spinning.
It was a long walk from the house rented by Angela Sullivan’s sister to Swayze’s … especially since Cas took a detour to stop by B’s Sugar Bar on the way — the bar Angela had disappeared from — before swinging past the motel to change into the t-shirt, flannel, and jeans that Dean had told him earlier he could wear.
“Castiel, I don’t know if you can hear this — you being unconscious and not having your grace and all. But if you can hear me, then please, just wake up man. I have so much I need to tell you. So much I need to apologize for. You can’t die not knowing how much you mean to me, Cas. You just can’t. Please, just wake up. Come back to me Cas.”
Dean just hoped Sam hadn’t guessed the other reason for his reluctance. If he handed Cas off to Sam, then Dean wouldn’t be able to personally check to make sure Cas was breathing each time he shifted positions. He already felt half-crazy with frustration over his uselessness. If any more of this situation got out of Dean’s control he was afraid he’d lose it completely.
He sighed wearily as he stumbled toward the old gold Continental. Cas’ foot caught on an exposed tree branch, pitching the usually graceful angel forward in his exhaustion … only to be caught by a pair of strong, familiar arms.
Just look at the mother of that missing boy, desperately begging anyone who would listen to believe her that her son was in danger, to help her find him. The pain in her large, brown eyes was almost too much for Castiel to look at. He didn’t know how the sheriff could respond so coldly to such unadulterated feeling.
“Lee, what about the wreckingyard?” asked Lorna who had walked up just a moment ago, unnoticed by Dean and Lee, both of whom gave her a slightly startled glance. “
He meant what he said. Cas had every right to pissed as hell. After Dean sent him into Hell with Belphegor … after the things Dean said to him when he got back …
Sure, his love for the Winchesters had never been without its share of heartache and pain. He’d learned years ago in a dark alley, with Dean’s blood on his hands and an anger he scarcely recognized as his own coursing through his grace, that loving humans was a dangerous and uncertain thing.
Cas knew the feeling that exploded inside him, but he was unprepared for the intensity of it. Jealousy. He did
“I know you love him Dean. And after losing Mom and Jack,” here Sam found his own eyes becoming moist, “He’s the only family I’ve got left too, you know, other than you. But even if this was going to keep him safe, you can’t do this to him, you just can’t. For Christ sake Dean, after Gadreel I thought you’d figured out that you can’t just go making these kind of calls.”
Looking up at the stage he was stunned to see Dean Winchester singing a duet with another man, a man he seemed to know quite well …
“Anyway, the song,” said Dean, turning back to Cas. “It’s one my dad used to like to play before hunts.”
Finally knowing why they had lost everyone they ever loved didn’t change a thing about the situation. Since learning the truth, they’d already lost Jack and then Rowena … not to mention suffering a double loss with Kevin and Eileen, learning that their friends weren’t even “safe” in heaven where they belonged, that they were instead literally doomed to an eternity in Hell … all because they mattered to the Winchesters.
Dean remembered he’d told Cas about fishing, how relaxing it could be. He’d told the angel they should go sometime, and Cas had seemed to like the idea.
to go wandering off alone that time. No, that had been Dean’s fuck up. And Cas had nearly gotten killed by the Rit Zein. If he’d died that night, lonely, depressed, in enough pain to draw the killer angel like a magnet … it would have been Dean’s fault. Every struggle, every terrible thing Cas experienced out there on his own as a human had been Dean’s fault. It’s something Dean never let himself forget.
For most people, it would be the body burning in the middle of the posh apartment that would evoke this look. Or being the one responsible for setting it on fire. Or at least being responsible for another body in the hall, blood still trickling sluggishly from the fresh bullet wound in the young woman’s chest.
As Dean sped east towards Kansas City, Rowena’s apartment, and Sam, Castiel sat in a police station to the west, poring over local maps and a stack of reports on missing persons and accidental deaths.
And so they found themselves being bustled through the discharge procedures until, suddenly, Cas was sitting in a wheelchair being pushed out of the hospital by Dean.
Dean knew it was almost definitely useless to be praying to Cas. But it couldn’t hurt. Plus, it made him feel a little better.
He and Eileen headed to the garage while Cas wondered into the library, idly picking up a book from one of the tables and flipping through the pages without actually registering the words or images.
Cas said to the dial-tone of the disconnected phone line before slamming the handset back onto the receiver a bit harder than necessary.
“I’d never not come find you if I thought you needed me Cas. No matter how angry we get with each other. You’re my best friend. You’re my brother.”
of the graveyard variety), or maybe there was something green to it, like the wind blowing through a summer field.
“Dean, I know Lee is your friend, but it has been a long time since you knew him. We have to consider …”
“He wasn’t at the campsite he told me he’d be at,” Melly said, shifting her attention back to the supposed FBI agent as she explained. “Hadn’t been there at all in fact. A family had been camping there all weekend — they told me when I went looking for him in the morning. Turns out one of the boy’s older brothers got a keg and they were all drinking, unsupervised, in a field — with a bonfire no less.
Dean dropped his forehead to Cas’, continuing to half whisper desperate encouragements. Tears were falling from green eyes onto Cas’ face now. When Cas’ eyes fluttered open, Sam felt sure for a moment that Dean was going to kiss the angel. Something about the way Dean held him, the look of relief in Dean’s eyes … it just felt inevitable. Which caught Sam a bit off guard. Not like he hadn’t suspected Dean’s feelings went beyond platonic, but he’d never felt so sure of it before.
“Right,” said Dean, clearing his throat as he realized he was the friend. “Did he … did he seem like it was working? He seem relaxed?”
Because that conversation? It was the last thing Dean wanted right now. Not that there was much of anything he
“Well, so, I was thinking,” said Dean, sounding crestfallen for some reason, “we could swing past your cabin, grab your stuff, then maybe stop at the bait shop on the way out of town?”
Now was probably the time Sam would be expecting him to crack a joke, ask Cas indignantly what was so wrong with him anyway. But he couldn’t because he already knew all too well everything that was wrong with him. He knew how ridiculous of an idea it was that Cas could possibly love him that way … the way that Dean was finally ready to admit to himself that he loved Cas.
Dean drummed his fingers on his legs, tapping out the rhythm to Metallica’s “Enter Sandman.” Soon he was humming along.
“Hmm, no, I don’t think so,” said Lee, just as Lorna walked up behind him with a glass for Cas and another pitcher of beer for the table.
was stalking tourists and the occasional townsperson was the conversation he’d had with Andy at the bait shop that morning. If he hadn’t happened to ask Andy why he was so upset, he never would have known that Shane Coogen’s body had been drained of blood. Because that seemingly key detail had somehow been left out of the official police report.
Dean was giving him a confused look. “The cabin? You were in the old mine. Sam and me, and Eileen, we came and found you. The djinn got the jump on you somehow.”
“That’s not…” Dean began before stuttering to a halt. He tried again, “I never said you weren’t useful Cas. I just said you need to rest some more, okay? It’s not just that your angel batteries are drained. You’re not even at human 100% right now, not after that much blood loss just two days ago.”
If Sam hadn’t been nursing a hangover of his own, he would have pressed Dean further about where exactly he was going, which would have seriously compromised Dean’s plan to give Sam and Eileen some space — and to get some for himself. It was a lucky thing Sam and Eileen had overdone it themselves last night with margaritas. Sam was just too damn perceptive. Like that comment about how Dean had been “upset” last night … He wondered how much Sam had noticed or guessed at. Given how hopeless Dean’s own situation was, he’d prefer Sam not know anything about it at all.
“When you find Clarence, can you have him give the shop a call, just to let me know he’s okay?” Andy called after him.
Thirty minutes later, Sam walked about of Rowena’s apartment with a single garbage bag of ashes and the first of several boxes of magical texts and supplies.
The crowd was thinning out now that the action was over and half the room was trashed. Cas looked up to find Dean searched the room with his eyes. When he spotted Cas, the hunter let out a breath he seemed to have been holding and made his way over to his friend.
And really, wasn’t that just adding insult to injury? As an angel, he didn’t strictly need to breathe. If he’d been at full power, he wouldn’t even need his vessel’s heart to be pumping blood nonstop through this body.
“Nah, I think we’ll stay a bit longer,” said one toughs. He and his friend, both of whom had quite a bit of body mass on Lee and Dean, moved to stand side by side, smirking at the other men with a
He’d never admit it to Cas or Sam, but he’d always liked knowing — after he met the angel — that there was someone listening to his prayers. Someone who actually gave a shit about him. It wasn’t about faith. He had lost that, if he ever even had it, long before he’d learned the truth about Chuck. It was more about knowing he was never completely alone in the world. Even when Cas didn’t come, Dean had known the angel still probably heard him. And that had been enough sometimes.
So he’d do what he needed to do. He was Dean-Fucking-Winchester after all. He’d been to hell and back, multiple times. He’d saved the world at least five times over. There was nothing he couldn’t do if he put his mind to it … even this.
Sam was just finishing his recounting of the djinn hunt when Eileen joined him and Cas in the map room.
“Okay, okay,” said Sam, fumbling his keys out of his pocket and nearly dropping them in the process.
was the reason for his ethical dilemma. The kissing was one thing. But sexual intercourse with dream-Dean felt like it would be crossing a line. Real-Dean wouldn’t like it anyway, Cas was sure.
He tried to calculate the right pressure in his arms to convey friendly camaraderie without suggesting anything intimate. It felt awkward, and Dean seemed to register that as well. He pulled back, his face once again unreadable. Though Cas almost thought he saw a glint of hurt in hunter’s face before he gave Cas a tight smile, opened the door, and stepped out of the car.
Which made the fact that Cas couldn’t take things any further with him very, very frustrating, even if it was Cas’ choice.
“Will do,” said Dean, standing up and exiting the room, though not before he’d grabbed another beer from the fridge. He was even more glad that he’d found a possible hunt now. He’d get the Impala packed tonight while Sam was distracted by Eileen and then leave first thing in the morning. But first he’d drink this beer, and maybe swing by the library to grab a bottle of something harder too.
Cas’ head cocked even further to side, as he squinted at Dean, his mouth open slightly in a look of utter disbelief. Now it was Cas’ hands that were clenched into fists. “Dean, if you’d succeeded … what it would have done to Sam. And to me when I was resurrected …” he said through gritted teeth
“You’re not in your room” Eileen stated, sounding surprised and frustrated all at the same time as she appeared on the other side of the table.
“Then he wouldn’t have woken up at all probably. We don’t know what happens if we uncap this bottle, and we’re not going to find out unless he’s crashing, okay?”
Because that was the thing Dean was more painfully aware of than ever before. Cas was important. Cas was Sam-level important. And even if Cas never forgave him, Dean needed Cas in his life. He needed to know where Cas was, know he was safe.
“Oh, it’s not you … or, well, not exactly. You see, I very much like kissing you. But I’m afraid you’re not real.”
, thought Dean. It had just felt so good to hold Cas. So reassuring. But Cas’ reaction … it had hit Dean like a punch in the gut. Maybe things really had shifted permanently between them. Yes, Cas was back at the bunker, but he was so reserved. Their friendship, or whatever it was that was between them, seemed as broken as Dean had feared.
Cas turned and left the office, his breath speeding up as he felt his chest constrict in an uncomfortably painful — and increasingly familiar — way.
Was he dead? No … that didn’t make sense. If he was dead, he’d be in the empty, not in heaven, so Dean shouldn’t be here.
What had that been anyway? Dean was not usually the sharing type, not without a whole lot of little brother pestering anyway. And had he really drank that much the first night on a hunt? What was going on with him?
Now, having to watch Dean hurt both himself and Cas in this stupid and probably futile attempt to protect their friend … it was too much.
“He uh, he died, actually. It’s been, 13 years ago now. But he died doing what he loved, what he was good at. And he went out on a big win. So, you know …”
“Of course not Dean, that would be … that would be ridiculous. We’re friends, family even,” said Cas, his voice going a bit flat.
“Oh,” said Cas, hoping he didn’t sound too disappointed. He didn’t want Dean to think it was about Sam not waiting by his bedside. He knew Sam had more important things to be doing. And he
“It’s not like that,” Dean snapped. He’d been too late to save Charlie. He couldn’t even think about being too late for Cas. “Just get me that address, okay?”
If Castiel had been a human hunter, even one as skilled as Sam or Dean, he likely would have left the station by now. It generally wasn’t advisable to hang around investigating a monster when the monster was in a position of authority and must know you were closing in on him.
Losing Jack, then Dean and Sam — the last by Cas’ own choice, for he had felt it necessary for a clean break — Cas had begun to think he’d never feel anything but this leaden sadness ever again.
So maybe this was still a part of the djinn dream? Last thing he remembered he’d been curled up in bed with dream-Dean, wishing it was the real-Dean he was holding in his arms. How could he have gotten from there to a hospital with no knowledge of how it happened? Did time jump like this in djinn dreams? If it could, it was the first he was seeing it. But he hadn’t been in the dream for that long, so it was possible this was just the first he was experiencing the phenomenon?
As Roy reached for his door handle, Sam leapt from behind the nearby dumpster and slashed his arm with the lamb’s blood coated knife. Roy let out a hiss, and suddenly his eyes glowed blue, as did the intricate patterns of tattoos that suddenly covered his skin.
“Between the lake and the old silver mine,” said Melly. “The mine is supposed to be toxic, and there were these mountain lion attacks there a few years back. It’s near where they found the Coogen boy just the other day actually. That part of the forest is just bad news. All the locals avoid it.”
That segued Dean and Lee into a long story about antics they’d gotten into on one particular hunt and John’s often frustrated but mostly amused reactions.
“It’s, uh, a story for another time,” said Sam, who had gone an even deeper shade of red. “Back to the topic at hand, I tried to call Becky, but she didn’t answer her phone. Chuck did.”
I'm back! I will finish this, I promise. Life has been even more chaotic than usual. Hopefully with the kids' school year underway now things will fall into a bit more of a routine soon and I'll have more headspace available for Dean and Cas. I had planned to have more apologies in this chapter but the boys were telling me they just weren't ready yet for too deep of a heart to heart. They'll get there though. Next up in the story, a canon-divergent AU "Last Call."
“I know,” she said, “We’ll find him Sam.” She carefully signed the words as she talked. He had the feeling she was slowing down her motions so that he could catch them all and maybe remember some.
“It’s Thursday,” Charlene told him, as though that was supposed to mean something to Dean. He raised an eyebrow. “Thursdays the Sheriff picks up his dry cleaning.”
But Dean had seemed genuinely happy to see him wake up. None of the anger or accusation that Cas had grown used to recently had been detectable. Which Cas did not have an explanation for.
An hour later, as Sam and Eileen waited for Roy’s body to finish burning, Sam recounted the dreams he’d been having — he and Dean killing each other, over and over again, each death bloodier than the last.
Dean dug his lock picks out of his pocket and fitted them into the padlock as though he were in a dream. It was a heavy-duty type, but even in his befuddled state Dean’s practiced hands made quick work of it, the mechanism clicking open seemingly through muscle memory alone. Opening the door, Dean was surprised to find, not a supply closet after all, but a dark staircase winding down into the building’s stone foundation.
Sam sighed in frustration, “Yeah, fine, I get it Dean. We just need to be careful. Like I said, if you get yourself killed trying to save him, Cas is never going to forgive either one of us.”
“You do have it though, the djinn antivenom or whatever right? I found a local butcher and got some lamb’s blood for the knives.”
“No,” said Andy, but added, “usually we don’t find ‘em soon enough to have that clear of a picture though.” He shuddered and took a slug from the cup on his desk. “Every time I close my eyes I see him, all white and nothing but skin and bones. How do you forget something like that.”
Dean turned back to Sam, “The only reason I waited for you, by the way, is that you have the djinn juice.”
“How about we get you a glass of water and give you some time to calm down, and then we can talk. Sound good?” said Dean, gently.
Cas’s stomach rumbled reminding him, once again, that he was human now and that, yes, breakfast would be a very good idea.
“So worst case it’s a nest of vampires,” Eileen said, strapping a lamb’s blood coated machete to her leg. “It’s not like we haven’t all single handedly taken out a next of vampires before, right?” She stood up and smiled brightly at the brothers who were both giving her a fairly wide-eyed look.
In the folding chair beside him sat Dean, the afternoon sun glinting off his dark blonde hair as he rattled off a long story about a pool hustle gone wrong, interrupting himself every now to chuckle. When he did, the skin crinkled around his green eyes. He looked so happy, so … light. The weight of the world for once, at least, lifted off his shoulders.
“Well take her to that coffee place you like then. After you get me the Greens’ address. There’s no need for you to come out here. Not yet. I’ll let you know when I find out more.”
“They call it Destiel,” chimed in Eileen. “There were way more love stories about you two in the recent stories than all the other types combined. WAY more.”
Eileen was staking out the sheriff’s office from across the street. Sam, having ascertained that the sheriff was not at his home, was staking out the hospital. Dean was standing guard over Cas, though he was doing his best to look like just another worried loved one sitting at a patient’s bedside.
“Yeah, heh, yeah, I think you’re probably right about that,” said Dean, looking embarrassed. “I’d, uh, better be going, back to the motel you know. Cas and me, we should get an early start tomorrow.”
Cas held dream-Dean close, listening to the hunter’s snores as warm tears rolled from blue eyes into dark blonde hair.
“Anyway, Lee and Dad and I … we’d done some hunts together in the past. Actually, I’d, uh, I’d been tipping off Lee on where Dad and I were hunting so Lee and I could meet up when we were in a similar part of the country. I’d see him on and off, over, probably about a two span. It didn’t take too long into the first hunt together for us to figure out we were both attracted to each other. Dad didn’t notice. He was drinking even heavier than he had been then, with Sammy off to college and him starting to find out things about mom’s death I guess.
“Dean’s been going through a bit of rough time,” Sam explained. The three sat down at the table, as Sam caught Cas up on the revelations that Chuck was still active and that Lilith was back on the board, as well as filling him in on Dean’s reaction.
Now it was Sam’s turn to blush. Eileen coughed, choking on her last swallow of beer. Dean thumped her on her back. Still, it took her a minute before she could get out, “You didn’t tell me that part.”
Which was why Dean was now struggling in the Impala — strategically parked between a minivan and an unconscionably large SUV — to change into his fed suit. “Getting … too old … for this shit,” he grunted as he awkwardly shimmied the black slacks up his legs.
Dean shook off his irritation, not letting himself consider what it might mean. He cleared his throat, “Could you tell me what you and Agent Worley spoke about?”
“Yeah,” said Dean softly. Cas was too lost in his own head to notice the sadness behind the single word.
Cas. He was sharing a bed with Cas. At some point in the night they must have each moved towards the other in their sleep because they were now cuddling in one another’s arms in the middle of the bed.
“I don’t mean to pry, but … just in case it ends up being relevant at some point while we’re here, um … you and Lee … you seem like you have some history. More than just going on a few hunts together …” he trailed off, unsure how to finish his thought.
“Sorry, but no. Just the one single. The local roadhouse, Swayze’s, is real popular round these parts. Folks drive from all over for the live music and whatnot there, especially for two-for-Tuesday. Some of them plan ahead and book a room so they have someplace local to crash. You’re lucky I even have the one single actually. Just had a cancellation.”
The cashier, Andy his name tag said, was looking down, frowning and rubbing the back of his neck. “It’s just that a few days ago we found a local, Shane Coogen. Nineteen-year-old kid. I’m a volunteer firefighter, so I was one of the people doing the search after Shane’s girlfriend reported him missing. We ended up finding his body when we started dredging the lake. And … well his body was drained. Seemed like there was no blood in him at all. Even with him sitting in the water for who knows how long, you could still see the way everything was kinda …
“Yeah,” said Dean, taking another drink and shuddering. “Yeah that one was … what happened to those kids … it was hard to forget.”
Dean hung up and reluctantly left Cas’ car, walking over to the Impala and sliding into its driver’s seat instead.
wondered Dean, his forehead furrowed in thought. He didn’t want to waste time, but he didn’t even have an address yet for the Greens.
“Good morning, dude,” said Dean, having decided the best route was to play it cool, like this was no big deal. “Apparently we’re both cuddlers. If we share a bed again we should probably sleep with a blanket between us so we don’t accidently smother each other in our sleep.” With that, Dean rolled out of bed, stretched, and walked toward the shower, calling causally over his shoulder, “Hey, would you mind getting a pot of coffee going? My head’s killing me.”
Dean kissed Cas’ jawbone then his neck as one hand worked, once more unsuccessfully, to undo his belt buckle. Cas noted that Dean seemed to finally be running out of energy, the kisses growing lazier, the roaming hands less goal oriented.
Cas being gone, Dean having so much time to do nothing but ruminate, then his panicked thoughts when he couldn’t find the angel … it had all brought certain feelings — ones that Dean had previously kept locked in a deep dark closet in his subconscious — up to the surface.
Cas walked over to the Impala in a daze and leaned against its hood. He tried to sort through his feelings about Lee, though it was hard to collect his thoughts. His whole body felt numb after seeing the former hunter kiss Dean. He did not have a good feeling about the man. But was that just his jealousy and hurt clouding his judgement?
“Sure,” said Dean, grabbing the last of the meat lover’s pizza. It wasn’t often that Sam agreed to order what he called ‘the cholesterol special,’ and tonight Dean hadn’t even had to ask him to!
“I wanted to say … just … thank you. For coming to find me in Idaho. I know how angry you were at me, and it meant a lot to me that you’d come search for me like that. And I don’t think you heard me, in the car the other day, that I missed you too. A lot.”
“You’re plenty useful, Cas,” said Dean, giving Cas a look the former angel couldn’t interpret. “And anyway, you don’t even
“Sam and Eileen are already on their way back to the bunker,” said Dean, “Sam said to tell you he’s sorry he couldn’t visit you in the hospital. With him taking out the sheriff, we figured it was best if he didn’t show up on the security cameras. But don’t worry about your car. Sam’s driving it back, and Eileen’s driving back the one they brought out here.”
Eileen had spent a solid week trying to get their attention before she finally managed to manifest herself visibly in front of Sam. She hadn’t meant to invade their privacy, but she’d been in Hell for a year and was a lost soul on the run. She was desperate.
Which is why, instead of trying to find a way to wake himself from the djinn’s dream, Cas was sitting by a lake, fishing pole in hand, Dean — or an approximation of him anyway — seated next to him.
Dean wondered. Andy went on, “He was usually the first costumer here in the morning. Real early bird Clarence. And he’d usually chat with me a bit before he headed to the lake.”
“Yes, that’s part of it,” answered Cas, staring out the window but unable to appreciate the bright, clear morning that stretched around them.
There were no motels within an easy walk of the station. If Cas had driven here, he would have driven away too … unless something happened to him either in the station or between it and the car … unless something
But instead of leaning closer, Dean froze. It looked almost as if he had to consciously stop himself from closing the distance between his face and Cas’. He lifted his hand and cupped Cas’ cheek in his palm instead, a sob catching in his throat at the same time his face broke into a smile. His wet eyes beamed at the angel, who looked only vaguely conscious and very, very disorientated.
So tell me I'm not the only one that was picking up serious sexual tension between Dean and Lee in that episode. Totally unacknowledged as always, but also totally there! Next chapter is actually mostly written. I'm on a roll; I've been looking forward to writing these scenes. I'll try to get that one up in the next few days. The new tags can give some extra foreshadowing in the meantime.
He should probably call Sam. This had turned into a hunt after all, and Sam would want to know about Cas, would want to be there for Cas. But …
And healing Caleb had drained Cas’ grace practically to the dregs. He couldn’t even feel its flicker currently. All Cas could do was wait and hope it would partially recharge one more time.
Being human again, Cas supposed he’d need to buy some clothing eventually. He’d ask Sam if he could use one of the brothers’ cards. Or maybe he’d ask him to show him how they managed to get the cards to begin with. The revelations about Chuck had pretty much torn down the last of Cas’ moral scruples about small sins like fraud.
